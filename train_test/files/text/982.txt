Objective: This paper uses observational data to explore what dietary constituents might be responsible for
associations between energy density, energy intake and weight status among free-living individuals.
Design: Cross-sectional data on 5783 Chinese adults (aged 20 ± 59 y) from the 1991 China Health and Nutrition
Surveys were used to test for associations between energy density, energy intake and weight status, controlling for
age, sex, height, activity level, smoking status, urban residence and income. Pearson correlation coef®cients were
calculated to identify nutrient intake correlates of energy density. Replacing energy density with its nutrient
correlates (3 day mean estimates of fat, protein, ®ber and water intakes) in the models predicting energy intake and
overweight status, the independent effects of speci®c nutrients were investigated.
Results: Energy density was positively and signi®cantly associated with energy intake and overweight status.
Energy density was signi®cantly correlated with every nutrient examined, although the correlations were weak for
most variables except water intake. Only water intake behaved consistently across analyses. It was negatively
correlated with energy density, negatively, signi®cantly and independently associated with energy intake as well as
overweight status. Despite positive associations with energy intake, fat and protein intake were not signi®cant
predictors of overweight status. Fiber intake was strongly and positively associated with overweight status.
Conclusions: Of the nutrients examined, only water intake appeared to explain the effects of energy density on
energy intake and overweight status.

Introduction
Although high-fat diets have been linked with hyperphagia
as well as overweight status and obesity, the causal
mechanisms underlying this relationship have not been
elucidated. In recent reviews of the clinical andaor epide-
miologic literature, several authors have concluded that
hyperphagia related to high-fat diets cannot be attributed
simply to the fat content of the diet (Poppitt, 1995; Prentice
& Poppitt, 1996; Bray & Popkin, 1998; Willett, 1998).
Poppitt (1995) writes `recent evidence from both animal
and human studies has shown that over-consumption on a
high-fat diet is not due to the fat content per se, but rather
in combination with the high energy content. It is only
high-fat, high-energy foods, not high-fat foods alone that
lead to hyperphagia'. Efforts to pinpoint the causal factor(s)
have been confounded by the effects of energy density and
nutrient colinearity.
Prentice & Poppitt (1996), in their review of all long-
term ( b 24 h) diet manipulation studies, conclude that
changes in energy density appear to be crucial to the
control of energy intake. When the energy density of all
experimental foods is manipulated, the obligatory change
in energy density is directly related to change in energy
intake. `When selecting an energy-dense diet, individuals
readily consume a suf®cient weight of food to maintain a
high energy intake. However, when selecting a low energy-
dense diet, individuals appear unable to eat suf®cient
weight of food to maintain a high intake and consequently
energy intake falls. The management of weight mainte-
nance andaor weight loss may be achieved by eating a diet
of low energy density (p 169)'. Results from existing
clinical studies of covertly manipulated energy density

(Spiegel, 1973; Garrow et al, 1978; Stubbs et al, 1998;
Stubbs et al, 1995a,b; Lissner et al, 1987; Kendall et al,
1991) show a positive association between energy density
and weight change. If energy density consistently predicts
energy intake and weight change, what then is the under-
lying mechanism?
Identifying the mechanism(s) underlying the consis-
tently observed effects of energy density on energy intake
and weight change is complicated by the amorphous nature
of energy density. Unlike speci®c nutrients such as vitamin
C, the structure of energy density is not a constant. Energy
density, the energy content per weight or volume of food,
has many determinants (energy intake, total bulk, volume
or weight), and can re¯ect a spectrum of diets of different
compositions. The above referenced studies of energy
density have involved qualitatively different experimental
diets, produced by the addition or subtraction of water,
arti®cial sweeteners, thickeners, andaor butterfat to liquid
diets, or by altering the fat, pasta or vegetable content of
solid diets. Although not reported in most studies, the
intended dietary manipulation (eg subtractionaaddition of
fat) necessarily caused shifts in the macro-, micro- and non-
nutrient pro®les of the experimental diets. Lissner et al
(1987) report shifts in macronutrient composition from
30 ± 35%, 12% and 55% of energy from fat, protein and
carbohydrate, respectively, on the medium-fat diet to 15 ±
20%, 13% and 70% of energy on the low-energy dense diet,
to 45%, 10% and 42% of energy on the high-energy dense
diet, respectively. Using thickening agents in their dietary
manipulations, Stubbs et al (1998) found signi®cant
changes in water and ®ber intakes, as well as protein, fat
and carbohydrate intakes. Since any of the component
alterations could ultimately be responsible for the observed
effects, it is not clear what mechanism mediates the effects
of energy density. Studies that alter energy density by
altering only one dietary component at a time are needed
to tease apart the effects.
This paper uses observational data to explore what dietary
constituents might be responsible for associations between
energy density, energy intake and weight status among free-
living individuals. Nutrient correlates of energy density are
included together in multivariable models to evaluate each
nutrient effect holding the other nutrients constant.
Methods
Data
Cross-sectional data from the 1991 China Health and
Nutrition Surveys (CHNS) for adults aged 20 ± 59 y were
used for this analysis. The CHNS was designed to study
factors affecting individual food choice, nutrient intake and
nutritional status, with a focus on dietary patterns asso-
ciated with nutritional de®cit or excess. The sampling
frame and survey methodology have been described in
detail previously (Popkin et al, 1995; Paeratakul et al,
1998). Trained Chinese interviewers obtained detailed
individual-level diet data via 24 h recall for three consecu-
tive days as well as household-level information on
changes in food inventory. The household-level data was
used to estimate individual consumption of edible oil (Guo
et al, 1999), as well as to cross-check the diet recall data. In
addition to the dietary data, information was available on
age (y), gender, income, urbanarural residence (according
to the Chinese census de®nition), smoking status (past,
never), height, weight and physical activity. Body weight
and height were measured on each individual by trained
health workers. Physical activity was determined based on
regular daily occupations, and recorded as a multilevel
variable (very light, light, moderate, heavy). Very light
activity was characterized by working in a sitting position
or as an of®ce worker; light activity as work in a standing
position; moderate activity as work carried out by drivers or
electricians; and heavy activity as the work of farmers. The
activity variable was designed by the Chinese Nutrition
Society to re¯ect total energy expenditure, and intended for
use in calculating the Chinese RDAs. The variable sig-
ni®cantly predicts energy intake and weight status among
Chinese adults (Paeratakul et al, 1998). The CHNS follows
human subjects approval procedures that have been
approved both by the University of North Carolina
School of Public Health and Chinese Academy of
Preventive Medicine human subjects protection committees.
The 1991 food composition table (FCT) for China
(INFH-CAPM, 1991) was used to calculate mean daily
energy and nutrient intakes from the food consumption data
for each individual. Energy density was calculated by
dividing the reported mean energy intake by the total
grams consumed. Energy intakes from all of the foods
and beverages included in the 1991 FCT were included in
the calculation of total energy intake. As the FCT and
associated CHNS datasets only include a few beverages
(milk, coconut juice, sugarcane juice, spirits, beer, wine,
champagne and brandy), the energy intake estimates in this
paper speci®cally include energy from foods, milk, coconut
juice, sugarcane juice and alcohol. The mean water and
®ber (non-starch polysaccharide) intakes were expressed
per unit of energy intake to distinguish between diets high
and low in these nutrients. Body mass index (BMI) was
calculated as weight (kg)aheight (m2). Subjects were clas-
si®ed as normal or overweight using the World Health
Organization BMI cutpoints of 18.5 and 25.0 (WHO Expert
Committee, 1995). Undernourished subjects (BMI ` 18.5)
and subjects with missing data were excluded from the
study sample (n  5783).
Statistical analyses
Effect of energy density on energy intake and weight
status. Separate ordinary-least squares (OLS) regression
models were ®t to evaluate the relationship between energy
density (kJag) and mean daily energy intake, and energy
density and total amount of foods consumed. These models
controlled for age, gender, income, urbanarural residence,
smoking status, activity level and height. Height was
included in the models as a proxy for body-size-related
dietary requirements.

Crude and multivariable logistic regression models were
®tted to test for a positive association between energy
density and overweight status. Again, age, gender,
income, urbanarural residence, smoking status, activity
level and height were included in the multivariable
models as covariates. Energy intake was not included in
these models, since it is intermediate along the hypothe-
sized causal pathway between energy density and over-
weight status. In epidemiologic analyses, it is considered
inappropriate to control for intermediate variables (Roth-
man, 1986). In an additional model, the total amount of
foods consumed, a potentially independent factor regulat-
ing energy intake, was also controlled. If determined by
visualalearned portion size cues or limitations of stomach
size or gastric emptying (Hunt, 1980), the total amount of
food consumed may lead to overweight by a causal path-
way independent of energy density. Given that the amount
consumed correlates with energy density, this potentially
independent determinant might confound the association
between energy density and weight status. Holding constant
the quantity consumed, the additional model focuses on the
effect of qualitative differences in the composition (energy
density) of reported diets. The total amount consumed was
not included in models predicting energy intake, since
energy intake is the product of this covariate and energy
density, (g consumed)*
(kJag consumed).
Nutrient ± energy density intercorrelations. Given that
previous researchers have reported shifts in fat, protein,
carbohydrate, ®ber and water intakes with changes in
energy density (Lissner et al, 1987; Stubbs et al, 1998),
these nutrients were identi®ed as potential correlates andaor
determinants of energy density. Each of these nutrients
contributes to energy intake or to the bulk, weight or
volume of the food consumed. Poppitt (1995) has shown
that the fat content of foods listed in the McCance &
Widdowson food composition table varies directly with
energy density. Figure 1 illustrates that the fat, carbohy-
drate, protein, ®ber and water contents of foods listed in the
1991 Food Composition Table for China also vary with
energy density. To determine to what extent the overall
nutrient intakes (the nutrient content of the whole diet as
distinct from the nutrient contents of speci®c foods) line-
arly covary with energy density in this sample, Pearson
correlation coef®cients were calculated.
Although the following analyses focus on fat, protein,
carbohydrate, ®ber and water intakes, we realize that these
nutrients may serve as proxy measures for other nutrient
correlates of energy density. Macro- and micronutrients are
known to correlate with energy intake and the quantity
consumed Ð greater food consumption leading to higher
intakes in general (Willett & Stampfer, 1998a,b). Nutrients
and non-nutrients that are correlated with energy density
may be represented by one or more of the selected
nutrients, eg fat-soluble nutrients by fat intakes, and
water-soluble vitamins, minerals and electrolytes by water
intake. To get a sense of between-nutrient intercorrelations,
Pearson correlation coef®cients were also calculated for
other available nutrient intakes.
In recognition that high-fat, high-energy (HFHE) diets
have been an important and controversial focus of research
on appetite regulation and weight control (Bray & Popkin,
1998; Willett, 1998), the nutrient pro®les of observed
HFHE diets were examined and compared with diets
lower in fat and energy. Diets with fat and energy intakes
above the 75th percentile for this sample (32% of energy
and 13 080 kJ, respectively) were compared with diets
medium in fat and energy (MFME: 25 ± 75th percentile
for both nutrients) and diets low in fat and energy
(LFLE: ` 25th percentile for both nutrients).
Effects of nutrient correlates of energy density on energy
intake and overweight status. Next, the OLS and logistic
regression models with energy density as the main expo-
sure (described above) were re-®tted with energy density
replaced by its nutrient correlates. Fat (percentage of
energy), protein (percentage of energy), ®ber (gakJ) and
water (gakJ) intakes were entered as independent variables
predicting energy intake and overweight status. Carbohy-
drate intake was included in these models by default as the
reference category. The models are essentially what Willett
and Stampfer (1998b) refer to as `multivariate nutrient
density models', which are useful for the study of the
effects of several nutrients simultaneously. These models
examine the effects of speci®c nutrients holding other
nutrients constant. Model speci®cation was chosen so as
not to violate model assumptions as well as retain clear
interpretation of the results. The nutrients were entered as
untransformed continuous variables, since the nutrient-out-
come bivariate distributions did not violate the model
assumptions for linearity. All nutrients were rescaled so
that their minimum value was zero and the reference
category for these models was diets with the lowest
percentage energy from fat and protein, lowest ®ber and
water content. The reference category, thus, consists of
diets high in carbohydrate, low in protein, fat, ®ber and
water. Explicitly, a one-unit increase in fat or protein intake
in these models necessarily implies a shift in diet composi-
tion of a 1% decrease in energy from carbohydrate. Since
®ber and water intakes are not energy-yielding nutrients, a
one-unit increase in either of these nutrients does not imply
a shift in energy from carbohydrate. Model coef®cients for
water and ®ber intake re¯ect the comparison between diets
high in carbohydrate, low in protein, fat, water and ®ber
and diets high in carbohydrate, low in protein and fat, but
higher in water or ®ber. Age, gender, income, urbanarural
residence, smoking status, activity level and height were
included in the models as covariates. Lastly, to replicate
previous analyses of fat intake and overweight status where
nutrient covariates were not held constant, protein, fat and
water intakes were dropped from the full model predicting
overweight status.
The Stata statistical program (StataCorp, 1999) was used
for all of the above analyses.

Results
Descriptive sociodemographic and dietary intake data are
shown in Table 1. Overweight subjects consumed sig-
ni®cantly less energy and total grams of food. The diets
of overweight subjects were higher in energy density
with a P-value of 0.06. On average, overweight subjects
had higher fat, protein and ®ber (as percentage of
energy) intakes, and signi®cantly lower carbohydrate
and water intakes than normal-weight subjects. Consis-
tent with current knowledge, overweight status was
associated with older age, female sex, urban residence,

higher income, non-smoking status, and reduced activity
level.
Energy density as predictor of energy intake and
overweight status
The mean (s.d.) energy density of foods consumed by this
sample of free-living Chinese was 10.7 (1.8) kJag (or 2.6
(0.4) kcalag). Energy density was positively and signi®-
cantly associated with energy intake. Adjusting for age,
gender, urban residence, income, smoking status, activity
level and height, a one unit increase in energy density
(kJag) was associated with an increase in energy intake of
305.7 (18.2) kJ (see Table 2, model 1). To further illustrate
this effect, the difference in predicted energy intake for
subjects at the 25th and 75th percentiles of the energy
density distribution (9.5 and 11.9 kJ, respectively) for this
sample was 734 kJ. Energy density was also negatively and
signi®cantly associated with the total amount of foods
consumed (g), controlling for the same covariates (model
2). The results from sex-speci®c models did not differ (data
not shown).
Crude and adjusted odds ratios (OR) were calculated to
estimate the effect of increasing energy density on over-
weight status (see Table 2, models 3 and 4). For a one unit
increase in energy density (kJag), the crude likelihood of
overweight increased by 4% (OR 1.04, 95% CI 1.00 ±
1.08). For a one unit increase in energy density expressed
as kcalag, the crude likelihood of overweight increased by
18% (OR 1.18, 95% CI 0.99 ± 1.39). Adjustment for age,
gender, urban residence, income, smoking status, activity
level and height increased the OR to 1.06 (1.01 ± 1.10)
when in kJ units, and 1.26 (1.05 ± 1.50) when energy
density was expressed in kcalag units. Energy density
appeared to be even more strongly associated with over-
weight status after also controlling for the total amount of
foods consumed (OR 1.09; CI 1.04 ± 1.05 per unit kJag or
OR 1.44, CI 1.17 ± 1.76 per unit kcalag).
Correlations between energy density and speci®c nutrients
Energy density was signi®cantly correlated with the fat,
protein, carbohydrate, ®ber and water content of the diets
consumed (see Table 3). While total fat intake was posi-
tively correlated with energy density, the other four nutri-
ents were negatively correlated. The strongest of these
correlations (r  0.91) was observed between energy den-
sity and water intake (see Figure 2). The remaining nutri-
ent-energy density correlations ranged between 0.10 and
0.20. Not surprisingly, Table 3 also indicates that fat-
soluble vitamin E and cholesterol covaried with fat
intake, and water-soluble calcium, potassium and vitamin
C correlated with water intake. Table 4 shows the nutrient
pro®les of diets varying in fat and energy composition. The
HFHE diets differed signi®cantly from the lower fat
and energy diets in several respects. HFHE diets were

Speci®c nutrients replacing energy density in models
predicting energy intake and overweight status
Models 1 ± 4 were re®t with fat, protein, ®ber and water
intake variables instead of energy density as the main
exposure (see Table 5). Results are presented for both
sexes together, as the results of sex-speci®c models did
not differ and sex interactions in the combined model were
not statistically signi®cant. Multicollinearity was not
observed in the multivariate nutrient density models (var-
iance in¯ation factors ` 10). Models 1 and 5 (Tables 2 and
5) explained a similar proportion of the variation in energy
intake (adjusted R2 % 17%). Controlling for age, gender,
height, activity, smoking status, urban residence, income,
fat and protein intakes (as percentage of energy) were
independently, positively and signi®cantly (P ` 0.10 for
protein) associated with energy intake. Water and ®ber
intakes were negatively and signi®cantly (P ` 0.10 for
®ber) associated with energy intake.
In both models 7 and 8, holding the other nutrient
intakes constant, water intake was strongly, negatively
and signi®cantly associated with the likelihood of over-
weight status. Expressed in gakJ units, the estimated
magnitudes of effect were huge. Expressed as gakcal, the
effects of water intake on risk of overweight status were
OR 0.14 (95% CI 0.04 ± 0.42) and OR 0.06 (95% CI 0.01 ±
0.21) for models 7 and 8, respectively. A 1 gakcal lower
water intake was associated with a 16-fold increase in risk
of overweight status. Subjects at the 25th percentile of the
water intake distribution (with water intakes of 0.15 gakcal)
had a 45% greater risk of being overweight than subjects
with water intakes at the 75th percentile (0.24 gakcal).
Contrary to expectation, ®ber intake (ga100 kJ food con-
sumed) was strongly and positively associated with risk of
overweight status. Controlling for the other nutrients and
covariates, fat and protein intakes were not signi®cantly
associated with the odds of being overweight in this
sample. When protein, ®ber and water intake were dropped
from the full model, the effect of fat intake on overweight
status remained non-signi®cant (OR 0.99, 95% CI 0.98 ±
1.00, P  0.08).

Discussion
This study contributes information about nutrient intake(s)
that might mediate the consistently observed effects of
energy density on energy intake and weight status. To
brie¯y summarize the results: in this sample of Chinese
adults, energy density was positively and signi®cantly
associated with energy intake and overweight status.
Energy density was signi®cantly correlated with every
nutrient we examined, although the correlations were
weak for most variables except water intake. When
energy density was replaced by its nutrient correlates in
models predicting energy intake, fat and protein intake
appeared positively associated with energy intake, while
®ber and water intakes were negatively associated with
energy intake. Despite their signi®cant or almost signi®cant
associations with energy intake, fat and protein intake were
not signi®cant predictors of overweight status. Contrary to
expectation, given the negative correlation with energy
density and energy intake, ®ber intake was strongly and
positively associated with overweight status. Water intake
was the only nutrient to behave consistently across ana-
lyses. It was negatively correlated with energy density, and
negatively, signi®cantly and independently associated with
energy intake as well as overweight status.
In an attempt to understand how dietary energy density
exerts its effects, we took advantage of detailed multi-
faceted data from the CHNS to examine the big picture of
energy density in a single sample of adults Ð how energy
density covaries with the quantity consumed, various nutri-
ent intakes and weight status in a single sample of adults.
To date, this is the only study in free-living individuals of
the effects of energy density on both energy intake and
weight status that also controls for relevant covariates.
Prentice & Poppitt (1996) report the existence of associa-
tions between energy density and energy intake in data
from the Cambridge Family Food Survey and the MRC
National Survey of Health and Development, but do not
show these results, and explicitly state that the associations
were not adjusted for activity or body size. There is no

mention of age, smoking or social class. These authors
report ®nding no signi®cant relationship between energy
density and energy intake in two of the community data
sets they examined. Marti-Henneberg et al (1999) found a
signi®cant correlation between energy density and BMI in
adult males, but not in females in Spain. Given that the
estimated effect of energy density on weight status changed
by as much as 22% (from OR 1.18 to 1.44) when control-
ling for covariates in this study, it seems that known risk
factors for overweight status may confound unadjusted
effect estimates. Cox and Mela (2000) report correlations
between BMI and energy density for some methods of
calculating energy density, but not others. Confounding
bias or differences in the types of data used to calculate
energy density may explain divergent results across studies.
As energy density increased, the grams of total food
consumed decreased for this sample population. The results
suggest that, holding all other variables constant, the total
amount of food consumed decreased with increasing fat
content, but increased with increasing water and protein
content. These results are not entirely consistent with the
clinical ®nding of no signi®cant difference in weight or
volume of food consumed with experimental diets of
varying energy density (Prentice & Poppitt, 1996). The
apparent compensation in the amount consumed, while not
large enough to eliminate the effect of energy density on
energy intake, might be related to portion size cues or to
regulatory mechanisms. Subjects consuming higher-fat
foods may have consciously attempted to eat less. Indeed,
the signi®cantly lower energy intakes and total grams

Energy density, energy intake and overweight status

consumed among overweight subjects may indicate under-
reporting for this group.
Although a possible source of error, under-reporting bias
should not materially alter the present results. If subjects
under-reported consistently across all foods, they would
have under-reported both the numerator and denominator
of the energy density variable (both the energy and the
grams consumed), and the error would cancel out. If, on the
other hand, overweight subjects disproportionately under-
reported foods higher in energy density, the effect would be
to weight the energy density for the whole diet towards
lower-energy-density foods, reducing the observed energy
density, and thereby weakening any association between
energy density and overweight status.
Energy density signi®cantly predicted overweight status
after adjusting for known covariates, including the total
amount of foods consumed. Age, gender, activity, body
size, socio-economic differentials, portion size, stomach
size- or gastric-emptying-related factors do not explain
away this association. Energy density appeared to be
associated with energy intake and weight status in this
large free-living population as it does in more restrictive
clinical settings.
As expected, all of the nutrient intakes examined were
signi®cantly correlated with dietary energy density. Energy
density directly covaried with fat intake and indirectly
covaried with water and ®ber intakes. Considering that
protein contributes to total energy intake and is positively
correlated with fat intake, the negative correlation between
protein intake and energy density was unexpected. The
weak correlations between energy density and all of the
nutrients, except water, were also unexpected. These
unexpected results may be related to true aspects of
Chinese food consumption patterns (ie protein may
be consumed with energy-dilute foods such as vege-
tables), to measurement errors or limitations of the food
composition table.
The between-nutrient correlations and between-diet
comparisons of nutrient pro®les illustrate the complex
nature of this nutritional epidemiologic problem. Energy
density covaries with a spectrum of nutrients, making it
dif®cult to pinpoint which nutrient is responsible for the
observed effects. Nutrients covary with other nutrients,
again making it dif®cult to interpret the effect of a parti-
cular nutrient. Is one nutrient acting as proxy for another?
In this paper, fat-soluble nutrients were found to covary
with fat intake, and water-soluble nutrients to covary with
water intake. Thus, theoretically, before ruling out potential
roles for such nutrients, it would be premature to conclude
from the present results that fat or water intakes mediate the
effects of energy density.
The models in this paper essentially examine the effects
of water and water-soluble nutrient intakes holding con-
stant fat and fat-soluble nutrient intakes, protein and ®ber.
Consistent with the literature on HF, HE diets (Poppit,
1995, Prentice & Poppitt, 1996; Bray & Popkin, 1998;
Willett, 1998), high energy intakes were not attributable to
fat and fat-soluble nutrient intakes in this study.
Given the strong positive association observed between
®ber intake and overweight status, it is unlikely that ®ber
intakes explain the protective effects of energy-dilute diets.
Water intake and its correlates are left as the most likely
candidates for further research. Clinical studies of water
incorporated into foods and satiety provide support for a
key role for dietary water intake (Rolls et al, 1999).
The results of this study ®t well with the data on water
incorporated into foods. The water intake variable used in
these analyses was calculated from data on foods and
energy-yielding beverages consumed over a 3-day period
for the purpose of studying energy intake, nutritional
de®cits or excess. This data was carefully cross-checked
against changes in household food inventory. Despite the
detailed quality of this data, information on water intake as
a beverage may be lacking since this non-energy yielding
nutrient was not a focus of this survey. The only beverages
included in the survey were coconut juice, sugarcane juice,
milk and alcoholic beverages. The water intake variable
used for these analyses is more representative of food water
intake than of total water intake. According to results from
Rolls et al (1999), the available variable may be the
biologically relevant exposure, however. These authors
found that consuming foods with a high water content
more effectively reduced subsequent energy intake than
drinking water with food. Although a preload of soup
decreased subsequent energy intake, a casserole containing
the same ingredients (type and amount) that was served
with water did not affect satiety. Cox and Mela (2000) also
report that energy density calculated from all food, milk
and alcohol (the same components as the variable in this
study), excluding other non-alcoholic beverages was sig-
ni®cantly associated with obesity.
Energy density appears to in¯uence the regulation of
energy intake and weight control even under covert condi-
tions when portion size cues or learned behaviors are
circumvented (Spiegel, 1973; Garrow et al, 1978; Stubbs
et al, 1998; Stubbs et al, 1995a,b; Lissner et al, 1987;
Kendall et al, 1991). The underlying biological mechanism
must therefore involve regulatory processes. Although
speculative, the tight regulation of water intake, hydration
status, and water metabolism may be involved in regulating
dietary intake. Unlike fat intake, which has been shown to
be poorly regulated (see Prentice & Poppitt, 1996), water
intake, hydration status and water metabolism are tightly
controlled at several levels by osmoregulatory mechanisms,
the renin ± angiotensin system, intracellular signaling cas-
cades, and gene transcription (Yancey et al, 1982; McMa-
nus & Churchwell, 1994; Haussinger, 1996; Burg et al,
1996). That water metabolism is a function of osmolytes
may explain why water incorporated into foodsasolution
has a different effect from water intake alone. Future
studies might examine how energy density and energy
intake vary with vasopressin levels.
In conclusion, this observational study explored the
effects of nutrient correlates of energy density on energy
intake and overweight status among Chinese adults. Of the
nutrients examined, only dietary water intake appeared to

overweight status. The generalizability of these ®ndings to
other populations may be limited given the relatively high
carbohydrate and low fat intakes prevalent in China. Long-
itudinal studies are needed to con®rm the associations
observed in this cross-sectional study.
