Abstract
Valproic acid is a broad-spectrum anticonvulsant that has also gained attention in the psychiatric
setting. With respect to safety, valproic acid may induce a seemingly rare condition,
hyperammonemia, which can induce a wide variety of symptoms ranging from irritability to
coma. The proposed mechanism of hyperammonemia involves depletion of carnitine and
overproduction of a toxic metabolite, 4-en-valproic acid, both of which impair the urea cycle
and thus ammonia elimination. Carnitine is a commonly used antidote for acute intoxication of
valproic acid, but is not a therapeutic option for management of chronic adults with adverse effects
related to valproic acid. We herein report a case involving a woman with epilepsy who developed
hyperammonemia after a change in her anticonvulsant therapy. She reported increased seizures
and gastrointestinal disturbances. Her ammonia, valproic acid, 4-en-valproic acid, and carnitine
levels were monitored. Her ammonia level was elevated and her carnitine level was at the inferior
limit of the population range. She was supplemented with carnitine at 1 g/day. After 1 month, her
ammonia level decreased, her carnitine level increased, and her seizures were better controlled.
Carnitine supplementation was useful for reversal of her hyperammonemia, allowing her to
continue valproic acid for seizure control.

psychiatric setting as a mood stabilizer.2 It is
usually well tolerated, although hepatic
function impairment necessitates tight
control in children.3 VPA has also been
associated with metabolic disorders leading
to weight gain and occasionally with hyper-
ammonemia. The latter may develop asymp-
tomatically or lead to encephalopathy.4,5
The prevalence of symptomatic hyperam-
monemia caused by VPA is unknown, and
the condition is thought to be rare in adults.
However, in a study carried out by our
group,6 almost one-third of adult patients
(8 of 28 patients) developed ammonia levels
higher than the reference range, although
only one of these patients exhibited
unequivocal symptoms (encephalopathy).
L-Carnitine (LCAR) is commonly used as
an antidote in acute intoxication with VPA,7
but its use in chronic treatment is reserved
for the pediatric setting.8
We herein report a case in which VPA-
induced hyperammonemia during chronic
treatment was reverted by the use of LCAR
as adjuvant therapy.
Case report
A 42-year-old woman had an 18-year his-
tory of seizures. She was a current smoker.
In 1995, she first developed focal somato-
sensory seizures (paresthesia in the right
limbs); these evolved to dysphasic seizures
and loss of consciousness. Neuroimaging
revealed a left temporoparietal arteriovas-
cular malformation. Her primary pharma-
cological treatment was carbamazepine
(600 mg/day) and VPA (1500 mg/day);
however, the seizures persisted. The carba-
mazepine was stopped and lamotrigine
(LTG) was added at 300 mg/day. After
several months of treatment, the patient
presented with increased seizures, cephalea,
and nausea and was referred to our service
for monitoring. Her hepatic and renal func-
tion was normal. At that time point, she was
receiving 1500 mg of VPA. Her morning
trough VPA level was measured using a
previously described validated high-perfor-
mance liquid chromatography (HPLC) tech-
nique with minor modifications,9 and her
2-propyl-4-pentenoic acid (4-en-VPA) level
was determined using the same technique.
Thirty microliters of internal standard (octa-
noic acid) was added to 1 mL of plasma.
A Phenomenex Luna CN 5 mm column
(150 Â 4.6 mm) was used for the stationary
phase. The mobile phase was a mixture of
potassium phosphate monobasic (40 mM,
pH 3.4) and acetonitrile (90/10) pumped at a
flow rate of 1.5 mL/min. The column com-
partment was kept at 36C, and the wave-
length detection was 210 nm. Under these
conditions, the retention times of the ana-
lytes were 3.8, 4.9, and 6.8 min for 4-en-
VPA, VPA, and octanoic acid, respectively.
The HPLC method was linear between 1.1
and 133 mg/L for VPA and between 0.78
and 16.5 mg/L for 4-en-VPA. The within-
day and between-day precision (coefficient
of variation) for the low, intermediate, and
high concentration of both analytes was
<15%. The accuracy at the same concen-
trations was within 92% and 108%. The
blood ammonia concentration was deter-
mined with a Cobas c311 (Roche
Laboratories), and LCAR and its acyl
derivatives were quantified using liquid
chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry
(LC-MS/MS). Extraction was performed on
3.2-mm filter paper disks punched out from
dried blood spot specimens using 100%
methanol solution containing the internal
standards. The internal standards used were
the Cambridge isotope internal standards
NSK sets A and B, which contained the
following stable isotopes: acylcarnitines
d9-C0, d3-C2, d3-C3, d3-C4, d9-C5, d3-
C8, d9-C14, and d3-C16. The extracted
samples underwent derivatization with 3 N
butanolic HCl at 65C and were finally
reconstituted in an acetonitrile/water
(50/50) solution containing 0.02% formic
acid (mobile phase). The samples were

analyzed with HPLC-MS/MS (Dionex-AB
Sciex 3200 triple quadrupole) using the
precursor ion spectra of 85 m/z.6 The results
are depicted in Table 1.
The LCAR levels were minimal accord-
ing the population reference ranges10 and as
evidenced by a high acylcarnitine/LCAR
(ACYLCAR/LCAR) ratio of >0.4, which
is a good biomarker of LCAR deficiency.11
Because of the patient's high ammonia
concentration (>94 mg/mL), LCAR was
added at 1 g/day. The patient was then
monitored 2 months later at the doctor's
request; the results are shown in Table 1.
With addition of the LCAR, the ammonia
level decreased to within the reference range.
The metabolite concentration also
decreased, while the LCAR level increased
after supplementation, as expected, from a
borderline-low concentration to a normal
value.10 Finally, the ACYLCAR/LCAR
ratio decreased due to resolution of the
LCAR deficiency.
This study was conducted in accordance
with the principles of good clinical practice
and the Declaration of Helsinki and was
approved by the Ethics Review Committee
of the Faculty of Chemistry (Uruguay). The
patient provided written informed consent
for publication.
Discussion
VPA has been on the market for almost 40
years now. It was initially considered to be a
safer alternative to first-generation anticon-
vulsants and free of serious side effects.
However, some reports have associated
VPA with fulminant hepatitis, a Reye-like
syndrome, and encephalopathy. Although
hyperammonemia has also been reported,
little attention has been paid to its preva-
lence. One report stated that up to 50%
of patients taking VPA developed
hyperammonemia, although they were
asymptomatic.12
With respect to its pharmacokinetics,
VPA is highly protein-bound and undergoes
extensive liver metabolism. During its elim-
ination, VPA follows three main routes:
glucuronidation (50%), b-oxidation in the
mitochondria (40%), and o-oxidation
(10%); the latter leads to formation of a
toxic metabolite, 4-en-VPA.13 This metab-
olite impairs the function of carbamoyl
phosphate synthetase (CPS), which cata-
lyzes the conversion of ammonia in the
first step of the urea cycle.14 Consequently,
the ammonia level rises. However, this is not
the only factor affecting ammonia elimin-
ation. In the b-oxidation pathway, VPA
must cross the mitochondrial membrane
via the carnitine shuttle, as fatty acids do.
LCAR depletion may occur in patients
receiving high doses of VPA or who experi-
ence acute intoxication, which may in turn
result in less b-oxidation of fatty acids
(including VPA), less acetyl-CoA produc-
tion, and decreased synthesis of N-acetyl
glutamic acid, an allosteric activator of
CPS.15 As b-oxidation decreases, o-oxida-
tion of VPA is favored and higher levels of
4-en-VPA are formed, which enhances CPS
inhibition as described above.
A well-established risk factor for hyper-
ammonemia in the neurological literature
is the combination of VPA with other
antiepileptic medications, particularly

phenobarbital, phenytoin, and carbamaze-
pine. The mechanisms of action are thought
to be related to an increase in the production
of toxic VPA metabolites because all of them
are inducers of the o-oxidative pathway.16
Case reports have also raised the possibility
that hyperammonemia results from an inter-
action between the effects of VPA and
topiramate17 and VPA and LTG.18
In our patient, no VPA or ammonia
monitoring was performed while she was
taking carbamazepine and VPA. LTG is
mainly eliminated by glucuronidation and
competes with VPA for this metabolic route.
The addition of LTG may have enhanced
deviation of VPA metabolism to oxidative
routes favoring the production of 4-en-VPA
(by o-oxidation) because b-oxidation was
impaired by LCAR depletion.19 All of these
processes in combination could have led to
the development of hyperammonemia, the
consequences of which (seizures) are difficult
to differentiate from the pathology itself
(epilepsy) and that can be misdiagnosed as
therapeutic failure instead of an adverse
drug reaction related to the use of VPA.
Hence, seizures might be seen as the final
step of the excitatory symptoms of hyper-
ammonemia due to the increase in glutamate
neurotransmitter synthesis.20
Exogenous supplementation of LCAR
has been proposed to prevent the develop-
ment of hyperammonemia. In Uruguay,
however, this strategy has only been applied
in the pediatric setting. Collectively, the
available evidence provides a reasonable
argument for the role of LCAR supplemen-
tation in certain cases of childhood-onset
epilepsy.21,22 However, well-designed stu-
dies of LCAR replacement therapy in chil-
dren with epilepsy are still needed. LCAR
supplementation was useful for resolution of
our patient's VPA-related adverse drug
reaction. This is important knowledge for
clinicians, who might otherwise change the
therapeutic strategy in such patients.
LCAR supplementation not only favors
ammonia elimination but also restores
VPA metabolism to normal routes, increas-
ing b-oxidation and thus decreasing
o-oxidation and therefore 4-en-VPA forma-
tion. The metabolic ratio decreased after
LCAR addition. This can be explained by the
higher impact that the decrease in carnitine
has on the kinetics of 4-en-VPA, which is also
a fatty acid. The ACYLCAR/LCAR ratio
also decreased and was maintained within the
reference ranges reported in the literature.11
The ammonia level also returned to the
reference range (25­94mg/mL).
Wide variation exists in the doses and
routes of administration of LCAR, making
it challenging to identify the optimal dosing
strategy.23 A dose of 1 g/day was proposed
as the initial dose in the present case, but as
the patient's condition improved, this dose
was maintained as long as the VPA treat-
ment continued.
The patient's renal and liver function
remained normal despite her elevated
ammonia, VPA, and 4-en-VPA levels.
Monitoring of the ammonia level is
advisable in adult patients undergoing
chronic VPA treatment, and LCAR supple-
mentation could be a solution to this VPA-
associated adverse drug reaction.
The main limitation of this study is that
the case report included only one patient.
Despite the usefulness of this intervention,
more patients still need to be studied to draw
stronger conclusions.
