Introduction
Idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension
(IPAH) is a complex condition with multifacto-
rial pathophysiology. While new developments
regarding epidemiology and therapeutic options
in IPAH are being reported [Hoeper et al. 2013;
Humbert et al. 2010], one important question has
emerged over the years: how does a sex difference
in the incidence of this disease reflect disease
severity? Identified as the earliest modifier in all
the epidemiological studies, IPAH occurs pre-
dominantly in females [Badesch et al. 2010], with
incidence of 1.9- to 10-fold higher, depending on
a specific subtype and registry of patients [Pugh
and Hemnes, 2010]. With regards prognosis, the
influence of sex is reversed [Shapiro et al. 2012].

Abstract
Background: Many studies have highlighted sex preponderance in idiopathic pulmonary
arterial hypertension (IPAH). It is well established that there are differences in exercise
capacities in the two sexes but how much of that difference reflects on disease severity or
correlates to markers of severity in the two sexes is still not clear. Right heart catheterization
(RHC) and cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) have been widely used for assessing
functional capacity, prognosis and treatment response in IPAH. We aimed to investigate the
`sex-specific' CPET parameters in relation to hemodynamics in IPAH.
Methods: Data were retrieved from 30 males and 53 females [mean ± standard deviation (SD)
age: 39.6 ± 17.2 and 37.5 ± 12.0] stable IPAH patients who underwent both RHC and CPET at
Shanghai Pulmonary Hospital from 2010 to 2016. Univariate and forward/backward multiple
stepwise regression analysis was performed to assess the prognostic value of CPET and
hemodynamic parameters.
Results: There were no significant differences in clinical variables between men and women.
Peak workload, peak oxygen uptake, anaerobic threshold (AT), peak minute ventilation, carbon
dioxide output, O2
pulse and oxygen uptake efficiency slope were significantly higher in men
compared with women (p < 0.05). Several CPET indexes correlated with hemodynamics.
Pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) and cardiac output (CO) were distinctly different between
the sexes. Peak end-tidal partial pressure of CO2
(PET
CO2
) was an independent predictor
of PVR elevation in all patients and in men. Peak maximum oxygen consumption (VO2
) was
independently predictive of CO decline in all patients and in men. Only peak O2
pulse was an
independent predictor of increased PVR and decreased CO in women.
Conclusions: Even after adjusting for age, body mass index and World Health Organization
functional class, different CPET parameters correlated with PVR elevation and CO decline in
men and women differently, which could potentially better predict severity in men and women
with IPAH.

Both the French and the US-based registry
[Registry to Evaluate Early and Long-Term
Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension Disease
Management (REVEAL)], characterized prog-
nostic indicators and concluded that males have
worse outcomes [Benza et al. 2010; Mathai et al.
2015]. In recent years, many studies have already
demonstrated sex affects some signal pathways in
the development of PAH [Kandhi et al. 2015;
Mair et al. 2015; Wallace et al. 2015], although
the majority of studies demonstrate effects of sex
difference on cause, treatment and survival in
PAH [Martin and Pabelick, 2014]. The hypoth-
esis we propose is that sex differences exist in the
prognostic assessment indexes of the same test
method. However, to date, there is no clear con-
sensus of whether sex difference has an impact
on alteration of exercise capacity, metabolism,
ventilation, cardiovascular and gas exchange
parameters in patients with IPAH. Gas exchange
measurements during cardiopulmonary exercise
testing (CPET) must be looked at with regards to
cellular respiration and how cardiopulmonary
mechanisms are coupled to it. Most IPAH
patients have gas exchange limitations attributed
to an impaired vasodilator response of the pulmo-
nary arteries to exercise [Tan et al. 2014]. CPET
describes the underlying physiologic abnormali-
ties associated with the hypoperfusion of the pul-
monary vascular bed in IPAH [Oudiz et al. 2006],
which has been used to gain insights into exer-
tional abnormalities in patients with PAH for
decades. Exercise limitations in PAH are the
result of dysfunctions from various physiological
systems and CPET has been used extensively
for evaluating these dysfunctions. This is central
to some recently published important reviews
[Pinkstaff et al. 2016; Babu et al. 2016].
Usefulness of CPET owes to its ability to uncover
abnormalities in the VO2
cascade [Sherry et al.
2016]. Additionally, CPEt allows reproducible
assessment of functional capacity and treatment
efficacy in patients with IPAH [Wensel, 2002].
There are massive differences in CPET parame-
ters between healthy male and female subjects,
but whether these differences are replicated in
patients with IPAH is still unclear. In addition,
whether different CPET parameters can predict
outcomes in male and female patients with IPAH
is also unknown.
Thus, the objectives of the present study were to
explore whether sex difference has an impact on
alteration of CPET parameters in patients with
incident IPAH and to correlate CPET measure-
ments with hemodynamic variables as measured
by right-heart catheterization (RHC).
Methods
Population study
From May 2010 to February 2016, 83 patients
(30 males, 53 females) with incident IPAH, aged
more than 18-years old, were evaluated at
Shanghai Pulmonary Hospital, Shanghai. The
diagnosis of IPAH was established according to
the most recent pulmonary hypertension guide-
lines, specifically, by the presence of a mean pul-
monary arterial pressure (mPAP) > 25 mmHg
and a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure
(PCWP)  15 mm Hg, as assessed by RHC
[Hoeper et al. 2013]. Patients with PAH associ-
ated with a definite cause, such as connective tis-
sue disease and congenital heart disease, and
those with portopulmonary hypertension, chronic
pulmonary obstruction, chronic pulmonary
thromboembolism and pulmonary hypertension
due to left heart disease were excluded. We also
excluded patients with acute or chronic illnesses
that might influence hormonal metabolism (i.e.
acute or chronic infections, chronic autoimmune
diseases, previously established primary endo-
crine disorders), and patients receiving any hor-
monal treatment (thyroid hormones, anabolic
steroids, corticosteroids) or drugs that markedly
inhibit hormone production, either at the time of
the study or in the past.
The study protocol was reviewed and approved by
the Ethics Committee of Shanghai Pulmonary
Hospital (Ethics Approval No.: K12-089).
Written informed consent was obtained from each
patient for inclusion into the study and prior to the
performance of any study-related procedures.
Assessment of patients
Patients underwent RHC and a 6-minute walk
distance (6MWD) test within 3 months of each
patient's CPET study, their World Health
Organization functional class (WHO FC)
and N-terminal Natriuretic peptide type-B
(NT-proBNP) were determined. RHC was per-
formed following standard protocols [Jing et al.
2011]. The 6MWD test was performed accord-
ing to American Thoracic Society guidelines
[American Thoracic Society, 2002], and a Borg
P Yuan, T-X Chen et al.
journals.sagepub.com/home/tar 137
dyspnea score was determined immediately
after the 6MWD test. Immediately prior to their
CPET studies, patients had standard pulmo-
nary function tests.
Each patient performed a physician-supervised,
standard, progressively increasing work rate
CPET to maximum tolerance on an electromag-
netically braked cycle ergometer. The protocol
comprised of 3 minutes of rest, 3 minutes of
unloaded cycling at 55­65 revolutions per min-
ute (rpm), followed by a progressively increasing
work rate of 5­15 Watts (W)/minute for PH
patients and 20­25 W/minute for the normal
subjects to the maximum tolerance, and 4 min-
utes of recovery [Sue and Wasserman, 1991].
Pulse oximetry, heart rate (HR), 12-lead electro-
cardiography, and cuff blood pressure were mon-
itored and recorded. Minute ventilation (VE,
BTPS), maximum oxygen consumption (VO2
,
STPD), carbon dioxide output (VCO2
, STPD),
and other exercise variables were computer cal-
culated breath by breath, interpolated second by
second, and averaged over 10-second intervals
[Sue and Wasserman, 1991]. The anaerobic
threshold (AT) ratio of oxygen pulse (O2
pulse)
was determined as previously described
[Magalang and Grant, 1995]. Exercise, meta-
bolic and cardiovascular capacity were expressed
as workload, VO2
, O2
pulse and HR respectively.
Ventilatory efficiency during exercise was
expressed as VCO2
, VE, the ratio of VO2
/VE,
VE/VCO2
(oxygen uptake efficiency plateau)
OUEP, oxygen uptake efficiency slope (OUES)
and the slope of VE versus VCO2
over the linear
component of the plot of VE versus VCO2
[Shi
et al. 2016]. Gas exchange efficiency was
expressed as carbon dioxide elimination/oxygen
consumption (RER) and end-tidal partial pres-
sure of CO2
(PET
CO2
). The rate of VO2
increase
during unloaded cycling was expressed as the
mean response time (MRT) for a monoexpo-
nential curve fit to the second-by-second VO2
measurements during the 3 minutes of unloaded
cycling [Sun et al. 2001]. If the first breath VO2
equaled the 3-minute VO2
, the MRT was consid-
ered equal to the duration of the first breath.
Statistical analysis
Results are expressed as mean with standard
deviation (SD) or medians (and interquartile
range) for continuous variables and absolute
number for categorical variables. The sample size
and the power were analyzed by NCSS-PASS (©
Copyright 2011 NCSS LLC., Kaysville, UT)
version 11.0.7. Comparisons were performed
using Student's t test or Mann­Whitney U test,
for continuous variables and chi-square test for
categorical variables. Correlations were assessed
using Spearman's rank correlation coefficient.
To determine the strength of the association
found between hemodynamic and CPET varia-
bles found to correlate with IPAH at univariate
analysis, we performed forward/backward multi-
ple stepwise regression analysis with hemody-
namic variables as the dependent outcome. We
forced age, body mass index (BMI) and WHO
FC into the models to adjust multiple regression
analysis. p values < 0.05 were considered signifi-
cant. The main analysis was performed using
SPSS (Statistic Package for Social Science,
Chicago, IL) version 19.0.
Results
Patient population
Demographics, baseline and hemodynamic data
are illustrated in Table 1. There was no difference
in BMI between the two sexes and age was almost
matched with mean age of 39.6 ± 17.2 years in
males and 37.5 ± 12.0 years in females. A total of
83 patients had WHO FC reported at diagnosis.
Yet there were no differences in overall WHO
FC between the two groups. Men and women
had similar absolute 6MWD and NT pro-BNP
levels and mean right-arterial pressure (mRAP),
mPAP, mean pulmonary capillary wedge pres-
sure (mPAWP), pulmonary vascular resistance
(PVR), CO and mixed venous O2
saturation at
diagnosis were also similar between the two sexes.
The differences of the treatment between the two
sexes were not found either.
Sex differences of cardiopulmonary exercise
testing parameters in patients with idiopathic
pulmonary arterial hypertension
CPET results are presented in Table 2. Peak
workload and the metabolic parameter, that is,
peak VO2
and AT was significantly higher in male
patients with IPAH. Male patients also had higher
peak VE and peak VCO2
. OUES, representing
gas exchange indices, was also higher in male
IPAH patients than females. Peak O2
pulse, one
of the cardiovascular parameters, also showed sig-
nificantly higher levels in males than females.

at AT were not
significantly different between male and female
IPAH patients. Figure 1 contrasts key CPET
measurement differences and frequencies between
the two groups.

related with PVR in females only. Only VE/VCO2
slope had significant positive correlation with
PVR in all IPAH patients as a whole or in male
patients when comparing them as three separate
groups.

at AT correlated positively with CO
in male IPAH patients. Meanwhile, peak VCO2
and peak O2

nificant negative correlation with CO in all IPAH
patients.
Factors influencing pulmonary ventilation rate
and cardiac output
Significantly correlated variables were entered
into stepwise multiple regression analyses to deter-
mine the strength of each individual parameter to
predict PVR elevation. As shown in Table 5, for
the whole 83 IPAH patients, the model 1 adjusted
by age, gender, BMI and WHO FC, peak PET
CO2
was an independent predictor and explained
12.2% (R² = 0.122) of the variation in this meas-
urement. In male IPAH patients, model 2 adjusted
by age, BMI and WHO FC, peak PET
CO2
was
the independent predictor accounting for 19.8%
(R² = 0.198) of the variation. In the females,
model 2, peak O2
pulse was the sole independent
predictor of PVR, separately accounting for 15.5%
(R² = 0.155) of the variation.
Peak VO2
was the sole independent predictor
of CO decline and accounted for 18.7%
(R² = 0.187) of the variations in this measure-
ment for all IPAH patients (associated model 1)
and 37.5% (R² = 0.375) in male patients (asso-
ciated model 2). In female patients, model 2,
peak O2
pulse was the sole independent predic-
tor of CO accounting for 15.5% (R² = 0.155) of
the variation.

Discussion
CPET's increasing credibility is reflected by the
fact that major guidelines for the treatment and
management of PAH have endorsed it [Galiè
et al. 2016]. Evidence since the last 2 decades and
beyond have already established that there are
differences in exercise capacities between the two
sexes [Astrand, 1956; Astrand et al. 1973; Bruce
et al. 1973]. Also, work efficiency in humans is
relatively fixed for a given work task as well. While
race, body build and genetic predispositions can
all influence exercise capacity, how a differently
reduced exercise capacity between the two sexes
reflects impaired hemodynamics is still not clear
[Wasserman and Whipp, 1975]. It has been well
established that VO2
/kg fairly represents meta-
bolic demand. Both peak VO2
and VE/VCO2
slope and their predicted normal for a particular
patient would be fairly accurate in terms of their
predictive ability [McLaughlin et al. 2013;
Schwaiblmair et al. 2012]. The current paper per-
haps is the first to report that a relationship
between CPET parameters and PVR as well as
CO exists in IPAH. Sex differences of CPET
parameters have received far less attention than
hemodynamic parameters in IPAH. We hope this
paper will serve its purpose of trying to reason
why the difference in exercise capacities affects
hemodynamics in a particular disease spectrum,
in this case, IPAH. Although being an initial
small sample study (n = 83), several CPET
indexes reflected `sex-specific' differences and
some of them were able to predict PVR and CO
independently.
There were no significant sex differences in
WHO-FC, 6MWD, NT-proBNP or hemody-
namics at the time of diagnosis and treatment in
Table 4. Correlations of cardiopulmonary exercise testing parameters to cardiac output in patients with
idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension.

our study, but higher trends of mPAP, mRAP,
CO and 6MWD in men were visible, implying
that men with IPAH have relatively lower pulmo-
nary vascular function, yet higher cardiovascular
function and exercise ability. Thus, sex may affect
the hemodynamics in our study. The REVEAL
Registry indicated that male PAH patients
categorized as New York Heart Association
Functional Classification I-II (NYHA FCI-II),
had higher mPAP, mRAP, CO and 6MWD at
diagnosis [Shapiro et al. 2012].Their results are
not completely consistent with ours. One possible
reason is our small sample size, while the REVEAL
Registry included 2969 patients, which is a large
sample study. Another possible reason is that they
classified patients differently, that is, patients in
our study labeled as IPAH, are classified as IPAH,
FPAH, CTD-PAH, CHD-PAH and other asso-
ciated PAH subgroups in the REVEAL Registry
[Shapiro et al. 2012].
The actual values for all CPET variables were com-
pared between the two sexes because predicted val-
ues are often adjusted for some factors, that is,
sex. Jarvis and colleagues demonstrated that dif-
ferences in muscle mass, fiber type or the way
energy production takes place in the two sexes in
healthy humans, suggesting male IPAH patients
demonstrate higher metabolism and ventilation
compared with female patients [Jarvis et al. 2011].
Our data indicate that exercise capacity, metabolic,
ventilatory and cardiovascular parameters, the four
key aspects of any CPET, were all higher in male
IPAH patients than in females. As described above,
perhaps a larger muscle mass, as seen in males, is a
reason that male patients probably have better car-
diovascular and exercise pliability. The role of sex
hormones in causation of IPAH may be another
key factor as well when interpreting these sex differ-
ences. Sex hormones, especially estradiol and its
metabolites, may affect metabolic enzymes, some
signal pathway and epigenetics in cardiopulmonary
vascular systems [Kandhi et al. 2015; Mair et al.
2015; Wallace et al. 2015]. In either case, severe
limitations are seen with cardiopulmonary function
in female patients with IPAH.
CPET with gas exchange measurements has the
potential of noninvasively grading the severity of
exercise limitation, quantifying the hypoperfusion
of the lung and systemic circulation, and assessing
responses to treatment before overt right ventricu-
lar failure, and PAH is evident even at rest [Wax
et al. 1999; Wensel et al. 2000]. Pinkstaff and col-
leagues go even further by making class recom-
mendations for CPET, for diagnostic evaluation

(Level B, Class IIa), prognostication (Level B,
class IIb) and determining therapeutic efficiency
(Level C, class IIb) [Pinkstaff et al. 2016].
The continued PVR elevation in IPAH due to
progressive pulmonary vasculopathy, limits blood
flow through the lung and thus through the body,
thereby impairing aerobic regeneration of ATP.
Therefore, more work is done anaerobically at
relatively low workloads and decreased cardiovas-
cular reserve. Thus, a wide range of correlations
between CPET parameters, and PVR and CO
were seen in all patients in the present study. Not
only due to sex difference, different body struc-
tures, or because PVR is the product of mPAP
and CO, but also because men may have higher
baseline mPAP, mRAP and CO [Lahm et al.
2014; Shapiro et al. 2012].
Along with gas exchange inefficiency and meta-
bolic abnormalities, exercise and cardiovascular
function are also impaired, which contribute to a
decline in CO in IPAH [Guo et al. 2015; Tan
et al. 2014]. Peak VO2
, as a metabolic parameter,
assesses the subject's maximal exercise ability and
the maximal compensatory ability of the circula-
tory system to raise CO [Sun et al. 2001]. The
decreased PET
CO2
in IPAH or cardiac failure
patients is considered derived from the ventila-
tion­perfusion mismatch and the increased ratio
of physiologic dead space to tidal volume
[Matsumoto et al. 2000; Yasunobu et al. 2005].
Peak O2
pulse, as a cardiovascular parameter,
likely reflects a progressive reduction in peak
stroke volume paralleling disease severity with its
progressive decline [Sun et al. 2001]. Although
the number of female patients was 1.33 times the
number of male patients in the present study, the
multivariate analyses of all patients showed simi-
lar results to that of men, suggesting that all
patients perhaps have more severe gas exchange
inefficiency and metabolic abnormalities than
cardiovascular abnormalities. Multivariate analy-
ses also indicated that peak PET
CO2
and VO2
were associated most with PVR elevation and
CO decline in male patients with IPAH. These
results demonstrate that men may have worse gas
exchange efficiency and metabolic abnormalities.
Peak O2
pulse can be considered as independent
predictor of PVR elevation and CO decline in
female patients, suggesting women may have
worse cardiovascular dysfunction. Interestingly,
peak PET
CO2
was an independent predictor of
increased PVR in all patients, while peak VO2
was
also an independent predictor of CO decline in
such patients. However, the exact reason why
men and women had different results on multi-
variate analyses needs to be further explored, and
whether sex hormones contribute to this also
needs further research.
IPAH patients included in this study were small,
and without further PAH subgroup classifica-
tion, that is, FPAH, CTD-PAH, CHD-PAH.
Therefore, the sex differences of CPET variables
are valid only specifically for IPAH patients for
now. Because CPET variables may be abnormal
in patients with other PAH subgroups, the
independent predictors of increased PVR and
decreased CO perhaps could be reflected by
other CPET variables in those disease groups as
well. In addition, other factors, that is, race and
genetic predisposition, could influence meta-
bolic, ventilatory and exercise capacity, but were
not considered in the present study.
In summary, our findings suggest that several
CPET indexes showed `sex-specific' differences
and some of them could also predict PVR and
CO independently. Further validation of these
sex differences are needed from larger samples of
PAH patients to determine if sex hormones con-
tribute to the difference in CPET variables.
