Introduction
As of Hering's time, complementary afterimages--afterim-
ages1 henceforth--have been modeled as illusory mental col-
ors resulting from adaptation of the visual system (Bidwell,
1896; Goldstein, 2010; Jones, 1972; Palmer, 1999; Purves &
Beau Lotto, 2002; Wilson & Brocklebank, 1955; Zaidi, Ennis,
Cao, & Lee, 2012). Although several neural mechanisms
have been suggested (Bidwell, 1897; Field et al., 2010; Hofer,
Carroll, Neitz, Neitz, & Williams, 2005; Kelly & Martinez-
Uriegas, 1993; van Boxtel, Tsuchiya, & Koch, 2010;
Wheatstone, 1838; Williams & Macleod, 1979; Zaidi et al.,
2012), the exact locus of such an adaptation is still vague
(Bidwell, 1896; Craik, 1940; Frey & von Kries, 1881; Hering,
1878; Jones, 1972; Mach, 1897). Remarkably, scientists and
philosophers have provided biased and imprecise reports
based on color opponency (Byrne & Hilbert, 2003;
Churchland, 2005; Goldstein, 2010; Hurvich, 1981; Jones,
1972; Lycan, 2002; Mach, 1897; Macpherson & Platchias,
2013; Palmer, 1999; Schwitzgebel, 2011; Werner & Bieber,
1997), and only a minority of accounts have considered the
complementary nature of afterimages (Bidwell, 1897; Geisler,
1978; Livingstone, 2002; Livitz, Yazdanbakhsh, Eskew, &
Mingolla, 2011; Pridmore, 2008; Wilson & Brocklebank,
1955; Zaidi et al., 2012). Finally, the notion of complemen-
tary color varies from author to author (Anstis, Vergeer, &
van Lier, 2012; Goldstein, 2010; Hurvich, 1981; Livingstone
& Hubel, 1987; Zaidi et al., 2012), and it is occasionally con-
fused with that of opponent colors (Livingstone, 2002;
Tsuchiya & Koch, 2005). Most of the debate has been based
on red/green contrast and occasionally on yellow/blue.
However, opponent colors blue and yellow (unlike green and
red) are also true complementary colors, in the colorimetric
sense--as opposites on a line through the white point in the
Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage (CIE) chromaticity
diagram (as defined in 1921 by the CIE). Therefore, as blue
and yellow endorse both the complementary color model and
the opponent color model, they are not relevant here. In con-
trast, red and green have been key.
This article provides empirical evidence that challenges
current models of afterimages and backs up an account of
afterimages as locally filtered RGB perception based on com-
plementary colors.2 It will not address positive afterimages
which appear to be based on different neural mechanisms.
In perceptual neuroscience, a widespread model of after-
images--the opponent model henceforth--maintains that, in
response to a prolonged colored stimulus, the visual system
adapts and generates an illusory complementary hue (Bidwell,
1896; Gordon, 1991; Jones, 1972; Palmer, 1999; Wilson &
Brocklebank, 1955) as predicted by Hering's opponent color
system (Churchland, 2005; Geisler, 1978; Goldstein, 2010;
Kelly & Martinez-Uriegas, 1993; Macpherson & Platchias,
2013; Palmer, 1999, Table 5). In this regard, the neuroscien-
tist Stephen Palmer (1999) summarized,
Each hue produces its complementary hue in the afterimage. The
complement of a hue is the one located in the opposite direction
with respect to the central point of [Hering's opponent] color

A Perception-Based Model of
Complementary Afterimages
Riccardo Manzotti1
Abstract
Complementary afterimages are often modeled as illusory Hering opponent hues generated by the visual system as a result of
adaptation. Yet, the empirical evidence suggests a different picture--Complementary afterimages are localized RGB filtered
perception based on complementary color pairs. The article aims to bring to the fore an ongoing ambiguity about red/
green afterimages and then to address all cases of complementary afterimages. A simple model of afterimages based both on
empirical data and the available literature is reconsidered and discussed: The afterimage color A depends both on the color
stimulus S and on the ensuing background color B as estimated by the relation, A = B ­ kS.

space. Thus green's complement is red, black's is white, and
yellow's is blue. (p. 106, emphasis added)
The opponent model articulates into three points:
·
· Afterimage hues are predicted by Hering's opponent
color system.
·
· Afterimage hues are a function of the stimulus only.
·
· Afterimages are illusory additions generated by the
visual system.
The opponent model of afterimages has never been uni-
versally accepted, but it has reached huge popularity--both
in university textbooks and in philosophical and scientific
articles (Brindley, 1963; Brown, 1965; Byrne & Hilbert,
2003; Churchland, 2005; Goldstein, 2010; Gordon, 1991;
Hurvich, 1981; Johnston, 2004; Jones, 1972; Lycan, 2002;
Macpherson & Platchias, 2013; Palmer, 1999; Robertson &
Sagiv, 2005; Schiffman, 1996; Schwitzgebel, 2011;
Tsuchiya & Koch, 2005; Werner & Bieber, 1997). The
acceptance of the opponent model of afterimages is likely
due to three factors that originate in the 1960s (Lang, 1987;
Pridmore, 2011): Hurvich's revival of Hering's opponent
color theory (Hering, 1964; Hurvich, 1981; Hurvich &
Jameson, 1957; Jameson & Hurvich, 1961), the findings
about the alleged neural underpinning of color opponency
(Daw, 1967; De Valois, 1965; Svaetichin & MacNichol,
1958), and the popularity of multistage theory of color per-
ception that combined RGB and color opponency (De
Valois & De Valois, 1993; Solomon & Lennie, 2007). Some
of these findings are currently under scrutiny (Pridmore,
2011; Romney, D'Andrade, & Indow, 2005; Stoughton &
Conway, 2008; Valberg, 2001).
In fact, as early as von Helmholtz's influential work, a
model of color afterimages based on complementary color
pairs has been put forward (Bidwell, 1896; Frey & von Kries,
1881; von Helmholtz, 1924): "A sharply defined negative
after-image of the complementary colour will be seen then
on the grey ground. Thus the after-image of red is blue-green
[cyan]" (von Helmholtz, 1924, p. 254, emphasis added).
Since then, several authors have emphasized the role of com-
plementary colors as regards afterimages (Pridmore, 2008;
Valberg, 2001; Wilson & Brocklebank, 1955), although their
view has not gained the same popularity. In this spirit, here I
present experimental results in contrast with all the above
three points of the opponent model. Such an evidence will
support a different model of afterimages--the subtractive
model henceforth--to the effect that
·
· afterimage hues take place in RGB space rather than
in Hering's color space;
·
· afterimage hues depend both on the stimulus and on
the background; and
·
· afterimages are not illusory additions, but localized
RGB filtered perception.
On the basis of such an evidence, a new model of afterim-
ages is put to test. The key hypothesis is that the afterimage
hue is estimated by the relation:
A = B S,
-k
where S is the stimulus one stares at to induce chromatic
adaptation, B is the background against which one sees the
afterimage, and A is the color one afterimage.3 A caveat: B
is not the background surrounding the stimulus, but the
background one stares at after the stimulus (like the gray
ground in von Helmholtz's text). All colors are expressed
by RGB triplets.4 The model suggests that, by modifying
spectral sensitivity, in a stimulus-shaped local area, the
visual system filters off the stimulus hue from the back-
ground, thereby revealing hues that would not be visible
otherwise. The model predicts different afterimage hues
from those predicted by the Hering-inspired standard
model but consistent with complementary-based models
(Pridmore, 2008; von Helmholtz, 1924; Wilson &
Brocklebank, 1955).
Consider Figure 1, if S is saturated red (1,0,0), B is gray
(½,½,½), and k is, say, ½, then the color one afterimage is A
= (½,½,½) - ½ × (1,0,0) = (0,½,½), which is unsaturated
cyan (cyanish gray). It is a prediction that conflicts with the
opponent model, which predicts a green afterimage (C)
rather than a cyan one (D). Such a difference allows us to
contrast the two models.
Results
Experiment 1: Red­Green Versus Red­Cyan
An entry way is the red/green complementary afterimage in
which allegedly a red stimulus should produce a green after-
image and vice versa (see Table 5, and Figure 6a and 6b).
Subjects stare at a red stimulus for 20 s and then afterimage
a color against a gray background for 5 s. Immediately after-
ward, the subjects are shown a green and a cyan square side
by side, and asked to assess which of the two hues is more
similar to the previously experienced afterimage. In such cir-
cumstances, the opponent model predicts a green afterimage
(Table 5), whereas the proposed model predicts a cyan after-
image. Remarkably, 99% of subjects reported a cyanish
Manzotti 3
afterimage following a red stimulus, and 95% a magentish
afterimage after a green stimulus (Table 1). Subjects' reports
contradict the standard Hering's opponent color model and
are consistent with the proposed model.
Experiment 2: Background Dependence
The previous experiment is consistent with the suggested
subtractive relation (A = B - kS) as long as the background
(B) is achromatic. What if the background is colored? To test
the dependence on background hues, the previous setup has
been applied to a number of combinations of color stimuli
and colored backgrounds. The empirical outcomes are
checked against both the Hering-inspired standard model
and the proposed RGB filtering model (see Table 2 and
Figure 2). While the opponent model predicts that a given
stimulus should produce the same afterimage regardless of
the background, the proposed RGB filtering model predicts
that the afterimage color should depend both on the stimulus
and on the background. The experimental results align well
with the outcome predicted by the proposed RGB filtering
model and conflict with the opponent model (Table 3).
Remarkably, if different backgrounds ensue, the same stimu-
lus leads to afterimage different hues.
For example, after a red stimulus (Figure 2, bottom row),
the opponent model predicts afterimaging green against a
magenta background, and the subtractive model predicts
afterimaging blue--96% of subjects reported afterimaging
blue (Table 3).
Experiment 3: Complementary Afterimages of
Negative Images
Complementary afterimages of negative images offer fur-
ther empirical confirmation. I used a version of the Spanish
Castle illusion in which viewing a hue-inverted image ren-
ders a subsequently shown achromatic version of the image
in vivid color (Sadowsky, 2006). Consider the four images
in Figure 3. P is the original picture; S is a negative version
of P--Each RGB value is changed into its opposite; B is a
grayscale version of P; BN is a false-color version of P. In
this case, P provides value and saturation, and S provides the
hue.5
If one stares at the negative image (S) and then shifts the
gaze to the grayscale image (B), one will be bemused to tem-
porarily see the colors of the original image (P). Is this a proof
that one sees illusory hues the grayscale image does not have?
Not necessarily. An alternative explanation is the following.
While one stares at the negative image (S), the visual system
adapts, that is, it becomes desensitized to S's color compo-
nents. Then, when the gaze shifts to the grayscale image (B),
S's colors are filtered off from B's colors. The grayscale
image (B) contains all color components in equal measure.As
the negative of a negative is the original, the original image
colors remain (P). Likewise, the complementary of the com-
plementary of a color is the color itself. Thus, the grayscale
image (B) contains the original positive image (P), and one
perceives P's colors thanks to localized RGB filtering. One
does not see illusory colors that do not exist; rather, one sees
P's colors inside B because S's color components are filtered
offfromB's,andthusonlyP'scolorsremain.6 Computationally
A B
 , yet physically A B
 .
As a further proof, consider the counterexample offered
by the false-color background (BN). According to the oppo-
nent model, the background ought not to affect the presence
or color composition of an afterimage. Here, the empirical
evidence shows the opposite--If BN is the background, no
afterimage occurs (96%, Figure 3). The availability of colors
inside the background is a necessary condition for the occur-
rence of the afterimage. The proposed RGB filtering model
predicts and explains why. In fact, BN's colors have been
chosen so as to lack the color components required to com-
pose the hues of the original picture. As a result, the afterim-
age does not occur, no matter previous adaptation, because
subtractive filtering cannot add any missing color (in this
case, A = BN - kS  A = BN). If the opponent model were
correct, one would see the original colors against both back-
grounds (B and BN). This is not the case. One sees the origi-
nal colors only against the grayscale background (B).
Experiment 4: No Light, No Afterimages
The last experiment is the most informal and the one that has
been carried on the smallest sample. However, its results
have been consistent with the proposed model. In brief, sup-
pose the subject stares at a red square patch in a dark pitch
room. All of a sudden, the stimulus disappears completely
leaving the subject in pitch dark. Will the subject see any
complementary afterimage floating over the pitch dark visual
field? According to the opponent model of afterimages, the
subject should see a green afterimage floating over the dark
background. Yet, this does not happen. On the contrary, the
subject does not experience anything. At most, they experi-
ence the persistence of a positive red afterimage that under-
goes the usual hue shifting. However, the prevailing
experience is just pitch dark; no afterimage ensues.
The same lack of afterimage happens even with a white
stimulus. Consider the popular Jesus negative silhouette

(Figure 4a). If one stares at it for 20 s and then stares at a
white surface, one will see a positive silhouette of Jesus--
that is, the negative of negative. Once again, the catch is that
the background is a white surface: White surfaces and screens
contain all color components. Due to local adaptation, the
visual system filters off the most prominent components of
the stimulus inside a stimulus-shaped area and a positive
Jesus silhouette is seen.
What if the background is pitch black? If the Jesus sil-
houette were a mental image concocted by the brain inside
the visual system, it might well occur against a pitch black
background. But it does not. If the experiment is repeated
using a pitch dark background, the outcome was surpris-
ing--96% of subjects reported no complementary afterim-
age (Table 4).
The suggested explanation is that an afterimage is the
carving resulting from subtracting locally selected color
components to the external world. If there is no color to be
filtered, as is the case with pitch black, nothing can be fil-
tered out. Thus, nothing changes. By means of subtraction, a
color that does not exist cannot be obtained.
It is worth noting that total absence of light is necessary
for the afterimage failure. If one repeats the above experi-
ment using a laptop, a computer screen, or even a printed
black square, one will likely afterimage something. The
reason is that, in all such cases, the alleged black is not
pitch black. In normal conditions, sheets of paper and dark
patches always reflect some residual light. When a com-
puter screen displays a black picture, a faint glow always
leaks out, and so forth. Therefore, an easy way to do the test
properly is to stare at the stimulus on screen, at night, in a
completely dark room, and then switch off the screen. If the
room is completely dark, one will not see any complemen-
tary afterimage.7
Method
In all experiments, off-the-shelf commercial LCDs were
used at their maximum brightness. Occasionally, the test was
performed using a video projector Epson EH-TW5300.
Experiments 1 to 3 were performed in dim-lit indoor envi-
ronments with all artificial lights switched off and the shades

included in the sample. A few unaware color-blind subjects
might have participated in the experiment.
In all experiments, the RGB space was chosen because it
is the most straightforward choice for off-the-shelf LCD
screens. Of course, the RGB space approximates the amount
of light frequencies trichromatic retinas pick up from the
external world through S, M, and L cones (Frey & von Kries,
1881; Stockman & Sharpe, 1998; Stockman, Sharpe, &
Fach, 1999; Zaidi et al., 2012). Yet, to a first assessment of
the model, the RGB color is close enough to the actual physi-
cal quantities stimulating the cone system of the retina.
The experimental setups do not require any sophisticated
technology. These tests may be performed easily by anyone
with a computer, a dark room (the darker the better), and
some spare time. In fact, readers are strongly encouraged to
experience firsthand the difference between the prediction of
the opponent model and the actual outcome8--The most con-
vincing evidence is generated by performing the tests
oneself.

aged was akin to P.

Discussion
Perception Versus Illusion (Experiments 1, 2, 3,
and 4)
According to the proposed model, afterimages are filtered
perception rather than illusory visual concoctions (Figure 5).
In fact, subjects do not report afterimage colors that are not
contained inside background colors. Negative images
(Experiment 3) and colored backgrounds (Experiment 2) are
convincing cases. If afterimages were created inside the
visual system, the visual system would be able to create any
color, regardless of the background. On the contrary, all find-
ings show that the background constrains what one afterim-
ages (Experiments 1, 2, and 3).
The collected data are consistent with the hypothesis that
the colors one afterimages exist inside the background.
Adaptation tunes the visual system so that it picks up the
color components present in the background selectively. In
Manzotti 7
normal circumstances, trichromats cannot see, say, the red
inside a gray patch because it is masked by identical amounts
of green and blue. However, if subjects were both blue and
green blind because of adaptation, they would see the red
hue. In fact, gray patches contain red which is neither illu-
sory nor mental; it is as real as any color can be. Afterimages
might well be filtered perception, but are perceptions
nonetheless.
Background Dependence (Experiment 2)
Traditional afterimage reports employ surreptitiously two
perceptual tricks that might have misled both researchers and
laypeople (see below). First, experimental setups exploit
achromatic backgrounds. Second, subjects' gazes are kept
fixed onto a predesigned region either by frames or by fixa-
tion points. Together, these two conditions guarantee that the
filtering does not occur on any wrong part of the visual
field--Background dependence can thus be neglected. It is
no accident that experimenters invite onlookers to experi-
ence afterimages only while staring at a white or gray back-
ground: "against a neutral surface . . . A black background
was used throughout" (Wilson & Brocklebank, 1955, p. 294,
emphasis added); "look at a sheet of white paper . . . viewed
against a white background . . . shift your eyes to the white
rectangle" (Palmer, 1999, p. 106, emphasis added); "look at
a white wall" (Jones, 1972, p. 154, emphasis added); "look at
a piece of white paper" (Goldstein, 2010, p. 213, emphasis
added); "hovering against that gray background"
(Churchland, 2005, p. 541, emphasis added); "look at a
small, not-too-bright achromatic surface" (Hurvich, 1981,
pp. 185-187, emphasis added); "looking at a white wall"
(Byrne & Hilbert, 2003, p. 5, emphasis added); "looking at a
white wall" (Macpherson, 2013, p. 13, emphasis added);
"look at a blank sheet of white paper. You should see against
the colorless background" (Brindley, 1963, p. 85, emphasis
added); "stare at the white disc" (Gage, 1999, emphasis
added). Asking the subject to afterimage against an achro-
matic--white or gray--background is a perceptual sleight of
hand. By imposing an achromatic and homogeneous back-
ground, experimenters discreetly smuggled the complete
color palette.
In the past, color models addressed the dependence from
the background (Shevell, 1978; Shevell & Humanski, 1988;
Shevell & Kingdom, 2008; Walraven, 1976; Werner &
Walraven, 1982); a fact that has been noticed since von
Helmholtz's work. Such studies have stressed the influence
of the background (and of the context) in terms of a two-
stage model of color perception. However, this article
focuses on the role of background as regards negative after-
images rather than as a tuning factor in color perception.
Moreover, such studies consider the influence of the sur-
rounding background rather than the background that ensues
the stimulus perception. The point here is that the perceived
afterimage colors are a subset of the background.
No Light, No Afterimage (Experiments 2 and 3)
If complementary afterimages are cases in which one sees
existing colors, one will not ever afterimage colors that are
not contained inside the background (Experiments 2 and 3).
One can only filter off color components; one cannot add
any. Suppose one stares at a red stimulus. Due to color adap-
tation, one becomes red blind. If one then stares at a white
background, one will see the remaining hues, which are blue
and green. Blue and green together make cyan. Thus, one
will see cyan. However, if one stares at a cyan background
(green or blue), no red will be available to be filtered off.
Then, as the proposed model predicts, no afterimage will
ensue. Cyan minus red is still cyan.
Shortcomings of the Notion of Complementary
Color (Experiments 1, 2, and 3)
As regards afterimages, no a priori color space (Hering's,
Maxwell's) can predict the right color one will afterimage
following a given stimulus, because what one afterimages
depends both on the stimulus and on the background. The
traditional notion that "the hue of an after-image is deter-
mined solely by the hue of the stimulus color" (Wilson &
Brocklebank, 1955, p. 299) as it has been already observed
by many, not last by von Helmholtz himself and others
(Kuehni, 2001; von Helmholtz, 1924) is ill-formulated.9
Thus, the standard claim that one sees the complementary
color of the stimulus is conceptually insufficient because it
assumes that the afterimage color is a function of the stimu-
lus color only. As is shown by data (see Figure 2, and Tables
1 and 3), given a stimulus, many possible afterimage colors
can follow depending on the background color. As the color
one afterimages depend on both the stimulus and the back-
ground, given a hue, there is no unique complementary color.
Conclusion
The entry way of the article has been a ubiquitous mistake
in afterimage reports--that is, the belief that a red stimulus
results in a green afterimage. On an achromatic surface, a
red stimulus yields a cyan afterimage, and a green stimulus
yields a magenta afterimage. The red­green mistake is
impressive in that it has been made not only by laypeople
but by color scientists and perception philosophers as well
(Byrne & Hilbert, 2003; Churchland, 2005; Lycan, 2002).
It is a remarkable error, because it has biased the way in
which stimuli have been devised and outcomes have been
interpreted without anyone noticing the discrepancy.
Generations of college students have been trained to
believe into a wrong notion. To demonstrate just how per-
vasive and deeply entrenched the red­green confusion has
become in both scientific and philosophical accounts, a
brief survey of the available literature regarding afterim-
ages has been gathered (Table 5)--All reported statements
8 SAGE Open
are empirically wrong. The mistake is so pervasive that
afterimage stimuli have been systematically drawn with
the wrong colors even in the most popular cases (Figure 6a
and 6b). A green/yellow American flag does not produce a
red/blue flag, but a magenta/blue one. Excellent textbooks
are not immune.
In sum, the standard afterimage model survived unchal-
lenged because reports have been biased both by the notion of
"mental" colors and by the widespread use of Hering's oppo-
nent color system. However, complementary afterimages are
neither hallucinations, nor mental images, nor mental colors--
They are not additions to the world one sees. Afterimages are
a case of perception in which one perceives a subset of the
colors available in the external world in a stimulus-shaped
local area. Complementary afterimages are not illusory oppo-
nent hues but localized RGB filtered perception.

2. The RGB space has been adopted because, albeit it is device
dependent, it gives a rough estimate of the amount of light emit-
ted in three different bandwidths. Moreover, as shown by the
collected evidence, the results are consistent among different
devices. Yet, it would surely be interesting to test the proposed
model against more precise colorimetric standards.
3. A caveat. In the following, I will often use the word "afterim-
age" as a verb rather than as a noun. I am aware this is not the
standard use. In fact, one of the points of the article is that after-
images are not visual objects but an alteration in the way one
perceives colors--thus, "afterimaging" is "perceiving colors in
a different way because of chromatic adaptation" rather than
"seeing an afterimage."

Table 5. The Ubiquitous Confusion in Red/Green Afterimage Reports.
"The antagonistic response of RED is GREEN . . . since the opponent reaction to a RED stimulus is
a GREEN after effect" (Hurvich, 1981, pp. 185-187).
"If the primary excitation . . . is produced by, say, 500 nm, it looks GREEN while the stimulus is on.
If we turn the stimulus off . . . we see a RED afterimage" (Hurvich, 1981, pp. 185-187).
L. Hurvich
"Stare at [the yellow green American flag], then quickly shift your eyes to the white rectangle
beside it. You should see an afterimage of an American flag in RED, white, and blue instead of
GREEN, black, and yellow" (Palmer, 1999, p. 52).
S. Palmers
"The negative afterimage was PINK, the complementary color to GREEN" (Brindley, 1963, p. 89). G. S. Brindley
"Look at the cross at the center of the strangely colored American Flag . . . Notice that the
GREEN area of the flag . . . created a RED afterimage" (Goldstein, 2010, p. 213).
B. Goldstein
"If we concentrate on a RED spot [it follows] a GREEN after-image" (Whitaker, Smith, & Finger,
2007, p. 1529).
E. Darwin
"An intense GREEN light induces a REDDISH after-image" (Gordon, 1991, pp. 68:79). Jan E. Gordon
"Exposure to a bright field of one hue (e.g., RED), induces a nearly complementary colour in the
after-image (e.g., GREEN)" (J. S. Werner & Bieber, 1997, p. 211).
J. S. Werner, M. L. Bieber
"Negative afterimages are modelled in terms of RED-GREEN contrast" (Tsuchiya & Koch, 2005). N. Tsuchiya, C. Koch
"A RED after-image can be induced by a GREEN color patch" (Robertson & Sagiv, 2005, p. 142). L. Robertson
"After looking at a RED surface, we see a GREEN color" (Brentano, 1874, p. 92). F. Brentano
"Stare at the glowing RED [and then] the usual GREEN after-image appears" (Jones, 1972, p. 154). O. R. Jones
"A GREEN after-image [is] a result of seeing a RED flash bulb go off" (Lycan, 2002, p. 18). W. Lycan
"A RED object will normally leave a GREEN afterimage" (Schwitzgebel, 2011, p. 48). E. Schwitzgebel

2003, p. 5).

"Staring at a RED spot produces a GREEN after-image" (Velmans, 1996, p. 193). M. Velmans
"Fixate the RED circle [then] you will see a circular GREEN after-image hovering against that gray
background" (Churchland, 2005, p. 541).

7. Of course, one might see a positive afterimage but that would
be a completely different phenomenon.

9. Interestingly, von Helmholtz (1924) observed, "Corresponding
results are obtained in observing negative afterimages of
coloured objects on coloured background. Invariably it is
principally those constituents which were predominant in the
colour of the primary object that disappear from the colour of
the ground. Thus, a green object on yellow ground gives a red-
yellow after-image; and on blue ground, a violet after-image"
(p. 255, emphasis added).
