Foreign-funded development projects are common in many
developing countries. Governments use money obtained
from bilateral or multilateral donors to build roads, schools,
or irrigation systems. International non-governmental
organizations (INGOs) use donor funds or privately-raised
funds to train health workers or provide microloans. Local
non-governmental organizations (NGOs) receive external
funding from foreign governments or INGOs to undertake
livelihood training or manage local water sources.
Increasingly, foreign aid donors undertake aggressive
branding strategies to spread information about their role in
local development projects (see the discussion in Dietrich
et al., Forthcoming). It is not obvious, however, that citi-
zens absorb this information (Baldwin and Winters, 2016;
Cruz and Schneider, 2017; Dietrich et al., Forthcoming;
Guiteras and Mobarak, 2014); nor is it clear how this infor-
mation influences how citizens perceive and choose to
interact with development projects. A recent set of studies
is helping to build up our knowledge base (Baldwin and
Winters, 2016; Dietrich et al., Forthcoming; Dietrich and
Winters, 2015; Dolan, 2016; Findley et al., 2017; Findley
et al., Forthcoming; Milner et al., 2016).
Milner et al. (2016) and Findley et al. (2017) use data
from a nationally-representative survey in Uganda to show
that Ugandan citizens prefer foreign-funded development
projects over projects that the authors assume citizens iden-
tify as government-funded.1 They find that this preference
is particularly pronounced among individuals who do not
support the national ruling party and who perceive corrup-
tion to be significant within the government. Based on
these findings, the authors claim that citizens support for-
eign-funded projects because they view them as likely to
perform better as they are more impartially implemented
(see also Baldwin and Winters, 2016).
We conduct an information experiment in which we
describe an existing development intervention to a nation-
ally-representative sample of Bangladeshi citizens. For a
random subset of our respondents, we provided informa-
tion ­ through visual cues, direct information, and ques-
tions related to the information ­ that the intervention was
supported with US funding. The treatment did not contain
any reference to better performance. When comparing how
respondents assessed performance across the treatment and
control groups, we can be confident that any differences in
perceived project quality result from respondents evaluat-
ing information about foreign funding.
If information about foreign funding has a positive effect
on perceptions of project performance, this might tell us

quality in Bangladesh

Abstract
How does information about the presence of foreign financing in a development project change people's perceptions of
that project? Using an informational experiment in Bangladesh, we find that information about US financing of a specific
development intervention sends a positive signal about project quality; this effect is concentrated among individuals who
are the least likely to have been exposed to the information ex ante. The information does not change the already high
demand for foreign aid but does help citizens target their demands toward the existing donor. That foreign funding can
be a signal of project quality helps explain an existing finding in the literature that individuals prefer foreign aid projects
to government projects.

that individuals, in general, perceive foreign aid as more
effective than government programs (as argued by Milner
et al., 2016). It might also suggest that donor branding has
positive externalities insofar as branding encourages indi-
viduals to engage with development interventions.
In line with the existing literature, we find that respond-
ents who have received information about foreign funding
believed the project was performing better. These treatment
effects are concentrated among individuals who do not
have previous experience with the project. The treatment
did not encourage respondents to say that Bangladesh
should seek foreign aid for expansion of the intervention.
Indeed, the vast majority of respondents in both treatment
and control conditions supported the government's pursuit
of foreign aid. The information, however, did help respond-
ents focus on the existing donor when identifying a foreign
source from which Bangladesh should seek financing.
Research design
In September 2014, we conducted a nationally-representative,
face-to-face household survey of 2294 Bangladeshis recruited
from 55 sub-districts (upazila) across the seven divisions of
Bangladesh.2 After two initial questions about important pol-
icy issues and the current state of affairs in Bangladesh, all
respondents watched a one-minute video about the Smiling
Sun Clinics, a nationwide network of health clinics that have
been partially funded by the US Agency for International
Development (USAID) since the late 1990s. Before begin-
ning the video, we asked respondents if they were familiar
with the clinics and if they, a family member, or a close friend
had ever been to one of the clinics.
In the control version of the survey, the video featured a
strip at the bottom with the Smiling Sun logo and name. In
the treatment version of the survey, this strip was replaced
with one featuring the USAID/Bangladesh logo and the
conventional USAID tagline (written in Bangla), "On
behalf of the American people." Immediately following the
videos, we asked respondents an open-ended question
about where "most of the financial assistance for the
Smiling Sun Clinics" had come from. Among the treatment
group that had seen the USAID-branded video, one quarter
of respondents said that the United States had provided the
funding, while another 3% stated generically that it was
foreign aid. The modal response ­ provided by 69% of
respondents ­ was that they did not know where the
funding came from. In the control group, 1 out of 10
respondents said that the United States provided the fund-
ing. Among previous users in the control group, this pro-
portion was as high as one in four. Like the treatment group,
4% of control-group respondents named generic "foreign
aid" as the source of funding, and the modal response ­
81% of the control group ­ was that they did not know. In
both groups, only 3% of respondents attributed the program
to the government.
Assuming that not everyone in the treatment group
would observe or correctly interpret the USAID banner on
the video, we structured the intervention such that, after
showing the video to the respondents, our enumerators
directly told respondents that the Smiling Sun Clinics are
partially funded by the United States:
Since 2007, the United States has been giving assistance to
build Smiling Sun Clinics in Bangladesh. The funds have been
provided through USAID. The United States has provided
more than 4,500 million taka [US$57 million] in support of the
Smiling Sun Clinics.
The respondents who received this information were then
asked if they knew why the United States was providing the
funding and whether they thought it was a good idea for
Bangladesh to accept money from the United States. We did
not ask an additional question to see if those respondents
who had not observed the USAID banner in the video had
updated their beliefs about the origins of Smiling Sun Clinic
funding after the direct information. Table 1 depicts the
three stages of the treatment in the context of the survey.
For our main outcome variable, we asked respondents in
both the control and treatment conditions, "Do you think
that the Smiling Sun Clinics have been successful in pro-
viding health care to the poorest people in Bangladesh?"
Answers were recorded as simple yes or no responses.
Subsequently, we asked all respondents, "If the govern-
ment wants to expand the Smiling Sun Clinics, in your
opinion, what is the best way for the government to finance
this expansion?" Respondents could choose from the fol-
lowing responses: that the government should (1) impose
new taxes and fees, (2) get money from foreign countries,
(3) inspire NGOs to open clinics, or (4) not increase the
number of Smiling Sun Clinics.
Regardless of a respondent's answer to the question
above, we then asked, "If the government invites a foreign

Results
As Table A1 in the appendix shows, there were no statisti-
cally significant differences on basic socio-demographic
variables or background experience variables between
respondents exposed to the two versions of the survey.
Almost half of the sample said that they were familiar with
the Smiling Sun Clinics, and a substantial proportion of
respondents ­ just above 15% ­ said that they or someone
in their family had used a Smiling Sun Clinic. As we
described above, about 10% of the control group correctly
said that the United States had provided funding for the
clinics. Within the control group, therefore, we know that
there is "non-compliance" that might bias against observ-
ing effects. We report intention-to-treat results.
In Table 2, we present the results for the perceptions of
project success variable. The first column reveals that
respondents in the treatment group (i.e., those who
watched the US-branded video and who were told about
and asked to consider US funding for the Smiling Sun
Clinics) were 10 percentage points more likely to say that
the project was successful in fulfilling its anti-poverty
mission. This is a remarkable result. By virtue of random
assignment, respondents in the control and treatment con-
ditions were equally likely to have previously used the
clinics (16% of our respondents) or to say that they were
previously aware of the clinics (48% of our respondents,
including those who said that they were previous users).
They both watched a one-minute video with the same con-
tent about the clinics. The difference between the two
groups was that the treatment group saw the USAID
branding during the video and was given information
about US funding flows to the clinics. Yet respondents in
this group expressed significantly more confidence that
the Smiling Sun Clinics were performing well.
In the next two columns of Table 2, we compare the
results for those who had previously used the clinics and
those who have not (but who may have been aware of
them). Among previous users, there were very strong
beliefs that the Smiling Sun Clinics were performing well:
96% of these respondents said that was the case. Insofar as
we see a difference between the treatment and control con-
ditions, it is in the same direction as in the overall sample,
with those in the treatment condition being additionally
likely to have said that the clinics are successful. Given the
small treatment effect, this difference is not statistically sig-
nificant at conventional levels. Among respondents who
have not previously used the clinics, we see a statistically
significant 12 percentage-point difference in perceptions of
project success. In the final two columns, we show the
treatment effects for respondents who were previously
aware of the clinics but did not report using them as well as
for respondents who were not at all previously aware. We
find the largest treatment effect ­ 14 percentage points ­
among respondents who said that they were not previously
familiar with the clinics. But even among those who had
some awareness of ­ but no personal interactions with ­ the
clinics, the treatment had a relatively large 9 percentage-
point effect on perceptions of performance.
That the results vary by the respondents' prior levels of
awareness of the clinics is not surprising. Those who had
personal experience with the clinics appear to have had
very positive perceptions of the clinics: as compared to
non-previous users, this group was 22 percentage points
more likely in the control condition to say that the clinics
were successful (p < 0.01). It would have been hard for the
information about US funding to have improved their per-
ceptions further (although the point estimate is positive).
Those who were aware of the clinics but had not previ-
ously used them also expressed generally positive attitudes
about the clinics in the control group but significantly
more positive attitudes in the treatment condition. And
those who had neither previous experience with nor aware-
ness of the clinics expressed the lowest levels of confi-
dence in the clinics in the control condition (63%), such
that we find the largest treatment effect among this group.

The information about US funding did not drive respond-
ents to believe that the Bangladeshi government should seek
foreign funding if it wished to expand the clinics. As Table 3
shows, in the overall sample, slightly more than three-
quarters of respondents in both the treatment and control con-
ditions believed that the government should pursue foreign
aid to finance an expansion of the clinic program. This gener-
ally positive attitude toward foreign aid is in line with the
findings in the work of Milner et al. (2016) in Uganda.
We note one exception to this result: previous users in
the control group were 9 percentage points less likely than
non-previous users in the control group to believe that for-
eign aid should be used to finance the expansion of the
Smiling Sun Clinics (p < 0.02). These respondents were
more likely than other respondents to say that the clinics
should be expanded using tax and fee revenue (14% versus
7%, p < 0.01). This may be because they thought of the
Smiling Sun Clinics as a government program. When
informed about US funding, the preferences of previous
users in the treatment group fell in line with the rest of the
sample: more than three-quarters said that the government
should pursue foreign aid to finance expansion. The treat-
ment effect is statistically significant.
Although the information about US financing did not
make Bangladeshis more likely on average to say that the
government should pursue foreign funding for the Smiling
Sun Clinics, it did help them coordinate their expectations
on asking the existing donor. As can be seen in Table 4, in
both the overall data and across the various subgroups at
which we have looked, the treatment made respondents
more likely to say that the Bangladeshi government should
appeal to the United States if it was going to appeal to a
foreign donor. In both the treatment and control conditions,
after the United States, the most popular sources of foreign
aid were the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank,
Japan, India, China, and the United Kingdom.
Discussion
We showed a one-minute video about the Smiling Sun
Clinics, a nationwide system of health clinics that provide
services to women and children from impoverished house-
holds, to a representative sample of Bangladeshi citizens.
For a random subset of respondents, the video was branded
with the USAID/Bangladesh logo. We additionally informed
these respondents about US funding for the network of
health clinics and asked them to consider why the United
States was giving money to Bangladesh and whether it was
a good or a bad thing. We did not, however, give these indi-
viduals direct information about the performance of the
clinics. Nonetheless, relative to a control group that we did
not inform about US funding, we find that those respondents

who received information about the US role in the project
described the Smiling Sun Clinics as more successful. These
effects are particularly concentrated among individuals who
either were not previously aware of the clinics or who were
aware of them but had not previously used them.
That information about foreign funding serves as such a
powerful cue of project quality is remarkable. While our
survey lacks the diagnostic questions to understand exactly
what the presence of foreign funding signaled to these
respondents (e.g., freedom from corruption, higher quality
supplies, better-trained staff), the evidence shows that peo-
ple are updating their overall opinions of the project in
response to our informational intervention.
As Milner et al. (2016) suggest about their results in
Uganda, we can read our findings as evidence that individ-
uals in Bangladesh generally perceive US foreign aid to be
effective. If the opposite were true (i.e., that Bangladeshis
perceived US foreign aid to be ineffective), we would
expect people to reduce their expectations of Smiling Sun
Clinic performance when hearing about the US role in
financing the intervention. Whether these perceptions are
based on empirical experience with and comparisons
between accurately-identified US-funded and government-
funded projects or rather a vaguer perception of foreign
things being good is a question worthy of further
exploration.
Likewise, whether or not we would see similar results
for projects funded by other donors or occurring in other
sectors also remains an open question. For instance, it is
possible to imagine that some foreign donors in some con-
texts might develop a reputation for low-quality projects, in
which case we would not expect to identify the same
effects. Or it might be the case that citizens are less likely to
draw inferences about quality from information about for-
eign funding in some sectors (e.g., if the United States were
to fund police training, it might not be the case that citizens
automatically viewed the police as higher quality).
We can perhaps gain some insight into this by looking at
the 80% of our respondents who described health care as a
"very important" issue. Among this subset of respondents,
we observe a 12 percentage-point difference between the
treatment and control conditions in the probability of say-
ing the Smiling Sun Clinics were successful. For other
respondents ­ those who said that health care was "unim-
portant" or "somewhat important" ­ the treatment effect is
half as large and not statistically significant. This might
suggest that our results are driven by public concerns about
the government-run healthcare system.3
If our finding is representative of what we might expect
of foreign aid from different donors in a variety of sectors,
our results can be taken as indicating a possible benefit of
foreign aid branding.Although Dietrich et al. (Forthcoming)
argue that relatively few individuals receive the message
being sent by the USAID brand, our results suggest that
when people do receive this information, they might be
more likely to actively engage with development interven-
tions that will theoretically benefit them.4 If this is the case,
then donor branding ­ even if its goal is to realize diplo-
matic outcomes (as argued in Dietrich et al., Forthcoming)
­ might actually help development projects meet their
development goals. On those grounds, the practice perhaps
should perhaps be encouraged, although we worry about
the implications for long-term sustainability (i.e., ideally,
local services will be provided by domestic governments in
the long-term and people will embrace using them even
though they are coming from domestic governments).
As most of the respondents in our sample already are
quite positive about foreign aid ­ three-quarters of them
support the government seeking out foreign aid if it wants
to expand the Smiling Sun Clinics program ­ we do not
find overall effects of the informational treatment on
demand for foreign aid, although we do find effects among
previous users of the clinics. We find that the information
about US funding helps respondents to coordinate their
expectations about which donor the government should
ask, being more likely to name the United States in the
treatment condition, even though they also name a number
of other major donors, such as the World Bank, the Asian
Development Bank, and Japan.
There remains much to be learned about how individu-
als in aid-receiving countries perceive foreign aid. As the
discussion in Brass (2016) makes clear, certain common
assumptions about how foreign aid and non-governmental
service delivery will be perceived do not play out on the
ground. Our study suggests that foreign funding signals
something to citizens about the quality of a development
project. What exactly it signals and why are questions for
future investigation.
