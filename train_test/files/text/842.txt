OBJECTIVE: To determine the types of subcutaneous adiposity represented by different measurements of skinfold
thickness that are associated with birth weight in white (n  759), Black (n  916) and Hispanic (n  813) American
children aged 5±11 y. We also determined the contribution of birth weight to ethnic differences in subcutaneous and
central adiposity.
DESIGN AND METHODS: Data for this analysis were from the Third US National Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey. The outcome measures were triceps, subscapular, suprailliac and thigh skinfold thicknesses at 5±11 y of age.
Central adiposity was de®ned as ratios of subscapular to triceps (STR) and central±peripheral (CPR) (subscapu-
larsuprailliac)a(tricepsthigh) skinfolds. Partial correlation analyses were used to determine the association
between birth weight and measures of subcutaneous fatness, while multiple linear regression analyses were used
to determine the independent contribution of birth weight to ethnicity variations in subcutaneous and central
adiposity adjusting for sex, age and BMI.
RESULTS: Overall, birth weight was negatively associated with subscapular skinfold and central adiposity in White,
Black and Hispanic American children (P ` 0.05). Birth weight was also negatively associated with suprailliac skinfold
in both Blacks and Hispanics (P ` 0.01) and with sum of the four skinfolds in Blacks (P ` 0.05). Compared with White,
Black ethnicity was negatively associated with triceps, suprailliac thigh and sum of skinfold thicknesses controlling for
birth weight, sex, age and BMI (P ` 0.01). Compared with White, Hispanic ethnicity was negatively associated with
triceps, thigh and sum of skinfold thicknesses (P ` 0.01). Both Black and Hispanic ethnicity was positively associated
with STR and CPR (P ` 0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: In this population of American children, the association of birth weights with subcutaneous and
central fat accumulation may be due to fetal programming. Since the impact of fetal conditions is likely to be modi®ed
by life course, de®ning the interaction between factors that are present at birth and subsequent exposures is one of
the essential challenges for future research.

Introduction
In sharp contrast to the traditional belief that most
cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and metabolic disor-
ders are caused by aberrant lifestyle risk factors,
recent epidemiological studies have shown that envir-
onmental factors acting in early life may play an
important role in the pathogenesis of diseases of
adulthood.1±8 As proposed, nutritional insults experi-
enced by the mother have a life-long imprint on organ
size and function of the child. The physiological
mechanisms associated with inadequate fetal devel-
opment may be `irreversibly programmed' to confer a
survival advantage. As the infant grows, such pro-
gramming would result in adverse consequences of
glucose intolerance, hypertension and other metabolic
syndromes later in life.1±3 Since low birth weight (one
of the consequences of adverse intrauterine develop-
ment) and adult CVD are both more common among
US ethnic groups and account for a very substantial
portion of the observed health disadvantage,9 the
impact of birth weight on CVD could have special
relevance for non-Whites such as Blacks and Hispa-
nics.
While previous studies using anthropometric
indices such as body mass index (BMI), waist cir-
cumference and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) have
demonstrated obesity as an important correlate of

CVD risk factors,10±14 little has been studied using
skinfold thicknesses as surrogate measures of adipos-
ity in children. Despite the overwhelming evidences
of the role of central adiposity in CVD, there has been
little study with regard to the role of birth weight in
central adiposity estimated from skinfold thicknesses
in children.
First described some 40 y ago,15 the exact role of
central fat distribution in CVD is not clear. Two
possible mechanisms have been suggested for the
mode of action of central obesity on CVD. One,
resistant elevated free fatty acid (FFA) is hypothe-
sized to provoke insulin resistance through hypertro-
phied visceral adipose tissues that have highly
sensitive lipolytic machinery.16±17 The causal connec-
tion of central obesity with CVD may be due to the
enlarged visceral fat depot producing excess FFA into
the portal and systemic circulation.18 Two, elevated
free testosterone and reduced sex-hormone-binding
globulin, have been suggested to promote increased
central adiposity and reduce fractional hepatic extrac-
tion of insulin.18
Although WHR and waist girths are the most
frequently used anthropometric indices of central fat
deposits in adults, their use in children is not clear. At
younger ages, WHR and waist circumference are not
as good as skinfold thicknesses as indicators of central
fat distribution.19±20 Indeed, it has been shown that the
assessment of percentage body fat in prepubertal
children from skinfold thicknesses has a prediction
error of only 3±5%.19 Subscapular, suprailliac, thigh
and triceps skinfold thicknesses have been described
as the best anthropmetric indices for adiposity in
children compared with WHR or waist circumfer-
ence.20
To our knowledge, the impact of birth weight on
ethnic differences in subcutaneous and central adi-
posity estimated from skinfold thicknesses has been
little investigated. The objective of this investigation
was therefore to determine which types of subcuta-
neous and central adiposity, represented by different
measurements of skinfold thicknesses, are associated
with birth weight in White, Black and Hispanic
American children aged 5±11 y. We also sought to
determine the contribution of birth weight to ethnic
differences in subcutaneous and central adiposity.
Methods
Data source
Data from the Third National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey (NHANES III) were used in this
investigation. Other investigators have described the
sampling and measurement procedures of NHANES
III in detail.21±23 Brie¯y, NHANES III is a multistage
probability sample of non-institutionalized US civi-
lian population groups de®ned and examined between
1988 and 1994, with oversampling of Blacks and
Hispanic Americans. Only children ranging from 5
to 11 y and identi®ed as non-Hispanic White, non-
Hispanic Black or Hispanic Americans were eligible
for this investigation.
This analysis was also restricted to singleton chil-
dren with available anthropometric variables, includ-
ing weight and height, waist, hip and thigh
circumferences. Only children with known birth
weights who were measured for subcutaneous skin-
fold thicknesses (n  2488), including triceps, sub-
scapular, suprailliac and thigh skinfolds, were
eligible for this study.
Skinfold measurements
All skinfolds were measured with the Holtain skinfold
calipers at the right side of the body with subjects in
standing position. A fold of the skin and the under-
lying subcutaneous adipose tissue were gently grasped
between left thumb and fore®ngers 2.0 cm above the
place where the measurement was taken. The jaws of
the calipers were placed perpendicular to the length of
the fold, and the skin thickness was measured to the
nearest 0.1 mm, while the ®ngers continued to hold
the skinfold. Actual measurements were read from the
caliper about 3 s after the caliper tension was released.
Triceps skinfold. With the subject shoulders relaxed
and arms hanging freely at the sides, triceps skinfold
was measured at the point on the posterior surface of
the upper arm.
Subscapular skinfold. After palpating the anterior
angle of the right scapular, a mark was made at the
interior angle of the scapular with a cosmetic pencil
marker. A fold of skin 1.0 cm directly below and
medial of the interior angle about 45 below the
horizontal extending toward the right elbow was
utilized.
Suprailliac skinfold. Placing the right thumb on the
intersecting marks, the skinfold was picked up with
thumb and ®ngers. With the skinfold sloped down-
ward and forward at a 45 angle extending toward the
pupis sympysis, the caliper was placed perpendicular
to the skinfold about 2.0 cm medial to the ®ngers.
Thigh skinfold. A mark was made with a measuring
tape placed around the midthigh. A fold of skin and
subcutaneous tissue was grasped in the midline about
2.0 cm above the marked point.
Weight was measured at a standing position using a
Toledo self-zeroing weight scale. Height was mea-
sured at an upright position with a standiometer.
Waist measurement was made at the midpoint
between the bottom of the rib cage and above the
top of the iliac crest. Measurements of waist circum-

ferences were made for each subject at minimal
respiration to the nearest 0.1 cm. Hip measurement
was made at points of maximum extension of the
buttocks. Height was measured to the nearest 0.1 cm,
weight to the nearest 0.01 kg.
Body mass index was calculated as the measured
weight in kilograms divided by height in meters
squared (kgam2 ). WHR was calculated as waist
divided by hip circumference measured in centi-
meters. Two indices of central adiposity were calcu-
lated from skinfolds: Central±peripheral (CPR) as
(subscapular skinfoldsuprailliac skinfold)a(triceps
skinfoldthigh skinfold), and ratio of subscapular to
triceps skinfold (STR). STR is an index of relative
distribution of central subcutaneous adiposity. The
sum of the four skinfolds (SUM) was calculated
from triceps, subscapular, suprailliac and thigh skin-
folds in the total sample. The SUM provides a single
measure of subcutaneous adiposity.
Statistical analysis
Statistical programs available in SPSS for Windows
were utilized for these analyses.24 One-way analysis
of variance (ANOVA) was used to compare birth
weight, anthropometric and skinfold thicknesses
across ethnic group. Partial correlation analyses
were also performed to determine the association
between birth weight and measures of subcutaneous
fatness, including triceps, subscapular suprailliac,
thigh, SUM, STR and CPR, controlling for sex, age
and BMI. Multiple linear regression analyses were
used to determine the independent contribution of
birth weight to ethnic variations in subcutaneous and
central adiposity, adjusting for sex, age and BMI. The
customary P-values of 0.05 were used to specify
statistical signi®cance.
Results
Tables 1 and 2 describe the birth weight, anthropo-
metric and subcutaneous skinfold characteristics of

values of triceps, suprailliac, thigh and SUM skinfold
thicknesses than White and Hispanic boys (P ` 0.01).
Hispanic boys had higher values of waist circumfer-
ence, BMI, WHR and triceps, subscapular, suprailliac,
SUM and CPR skinfold thicknesses than their White
and Black counterparts (P ` 0.05). Among girls,
Blacks tended to have lower birth weight, WHR,
and thigh skinfold thickness (P ` 0.01) and higher
values of weight, height, thigh circumference and
STR (P ` 0.05) than Whites and Hispanics. Hispanic
girls presented with higher values of waist circumfer-
ence, BMI, WHR and subscapular, suprailliac and
CPR skinfold thicknesses compared to White and
Black girls (P ` 0.05).
The association between birth weight and subcuta-
neous measures of adiposity adjusted for sex, age and
BMI is presented in Table 3. Overall, birth weight was
negatively correlated with subscapular skinfold and
central adiposity determined by STR and CPR in
White, Black and Hispanic children (P ` 0.05). Birth
weight was negatively associated with suprailliac
skinfold in both Blacks and Hispanics (P ` 0.01)
and with sum of the four skinfolds in Blacks
(P ` 0.05). In multiple regression models (Table 3)
we further tested whether or not the three ethnic
groups had the same level of subcutaneous and central
adiposity for a given birth weight value. Adjusting for
gender, age and BMI, a gram increase in birth weight
was associated with 0.07, 0.10 and 0.11 mm decrease
in STR in Whites, Blacks and Hispanic children,
respectively (P ` 0.01). The corresponding values
for CPR were 0.10, 0.06 and 0.11 mm (P ` 0.01).
Among Blacks, a 1 g increase in birth weight was
associated with 0.05, 0.04 and 0.03 mm decrease in
subscapular, suprailliac and SUM skinfold thick-
nesses, respectively (P ` 0.05). A similar decrease of
0.05 mm in subscapular skinfold thickness was also
observed among Hispanic children (P ` 0.01).
Multiple linear regression models were used to
determine whether differences in birth weights
explained ethnic variations in subcutaneous and cen-
tral adiposity adjusting for sex, age and BMI (Table
4). Black and Hispanic ethnicity were independently
associated with decreased triceps, thigh and sum of
the four skinfold thicknesses compared to Whites
(P ` 0.01). Black ethnicity was also negatively asso-
ciated with suprailliac skinfold thickness (P ` 0.01).
Both Black and Hispanic ethnicity was positively
associated with STR and CPR compared to Whites
adjusting for sex, age and BMI (P ` 0.01). Sex and
BMI were positively associated with all subcutaneous
measures of adiposity, adjusting for birth weight, age
and ethnicity (P ` 0.01). Also, age was negatively
associated with subscapular and thigh skinfolds and
positively associated with suprailliac, STR and CPR
(P ` 0.01).
Discussion
Epidemiologic studies have repeatedly demonstrated
that fetal adaptation to the stress of adverse nutritional
conditions is re¯ected in reduced growth and devel-

opment.1±8,25±27 These ®ndings have now been widely
replicated and animal experimental research demon-
strates that these relationships may persist for several
generations.26 The limited research to date in the US
has yielded inconsistent results, however, and the
direct relevance of `pregnancy programming' for
this at-risk group has not been de®ned. Among sam-
ples of children examined in the Bogalusa Heart
Study, an association between low birth weight and
elevated triglyceride concentrations in later childhood
was observed.28
This is the ®rst investigation utilizing NHANES III
to determine the impact of birth weight on ethnic
differences in subcutaneous and central adiposity
represented by different measurements of skinfold
thicknesses in White, Black and Hispanic American
children aged 5±11 y. NHANES III represents the best
available data since the sampling scheme was repre-
sentative and national in scope. The training program
and quality control measures instituted in NHANES
III give an added credence to the data.
The results of this investigation showed that birth
weight was negatively associated with subscapular
and central adiposity determined by STR and CPR
in White, Black and Hispanic American children. The
results of our analysis also showed that birth weight
was negatively associated with suprailliac skinfold in
both Blacks and Hispanics and with sum of the four
skinfolds in Blacks.
The lower birth weights observed for Black boys
and girls compared to White and Hispanic counter-
parts in this study are consistent with other
®ndings.28±32 The lower values of some skinfolds,
such as triceps, thigh and SUM observed in Black
children compared to Whites and Hispanics in this
investigation are also consistent with the observations
of other investigators.33±36 The negative association of
birth weight with STR in our this study is consistent
with the observations of Malina et al,36 in which a
negative correlation between birth weight and STR
was found in 131 boys and 106 girls 7±12 y of age. It
is also consistent with the result of the study by Baker
et al,37 investigating the association between birth
weight and body fat distribution in a group of 14±
16 y old adolescent girls born in Southampton. Con-
sistent with our ®ndings, Baker et al 37 also observed a
negative association of birth weight with subscapular
(P ` 0.05) and STR (P  0.05) and a nonstatistically
signi®cant association between birth weight and tri-
ceps skinfold thickness.
In contrast to the notion that metabolic abnormal-
ities due to intrauterine development may only mani-
fest themselves in adulthood, we have shown that the
effect of low birth weight can occur as early as 5±11 y
of age. This observation is consistent with the ®ndings
investigating the role of thinness at birth in blood
pressures, glucose, insulin metabolism at eleven,
seven and four years of age, respectively.28,38,39 Our
results are consistent with the notion that ethnic or
racial differences in CVD may be associated with the
state of infant nutrition determined by environments
in utero.1±8 Compared with White, Black and Hispa-
nic ethnicity were both negatively associated with
birth weight controlling for sex, age and BMI. The
results of this study also showed that for the same
level of birth weight the three ethnic groups have
different values of central fat deposit.
Conclusion
In this population of American children, the associa-
tion of birth weights with subcutaneous and central fat
accumulation may be due to fetal programming. It is
obvious that the impact of fetal conditions is likely to
be modi®ed by life course. Perinatal in¯uences are
likely to be greatest when a small infant becomes a
large adult, thus amplifying the effect on CVD in
populations with a high incidence of both low birth
weight and obesity. A substantial proportion of the
increased risk observed for some CVD such as hyper-
tension and diabetes among some US ethnic groups
may be due to this interaction. De®ning the interaction
between factors that are present at birth and subse-
quent exposures is one of the essential challenges for
future research.
