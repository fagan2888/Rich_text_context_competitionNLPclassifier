Abstract
Objective: A randomized, double-blind, prospective study to evaluate the effect of anticholinergic
drugs on thermoregulation in paediatric patients undergoing ambulatory anaesthesia with ketamine.
Methods: Patients were randomized to receive either 0.005 mg/kg glycopyrrolate or the
equivalent volume of normal saline (placebo) at 30 min before ketamine anaesthesia. Body
temperature was measured tympanically at baseline and at 0, 30, 60 and 90 min postoperatively.
The quantity of saliva prodiced during surgery and incidence of fever were recorded.
Results: Body temperature was significantly higher in the glycopyrrolate group (n ¼ 42) than the
placebo group (n ¼ 42) at 30, 60 and 90 min after surgery, and higher than baseline at 0, 30, 60 and
90 min after surgery. In the placebo group, body temperature was significantly higher than baseline
at 0 and 30 min after surgery. Saliva secretion was significantly lower in the glycopyrrolate group
than the placebo group.
Conclusion: Routine premedication with adjunctive anticholinergics should not be considered in
paediatric patients receiving ketamine sedation due to the increased risk of fever.

Introduction
Ketamine has been widely used in minor
procedures for children for its quick sedative
and analgesic effects with minimal impact on
airway reflexes and respiratory depression.1
However, adverse effects such as nausea,
vomiting, rash, emergence reactions,
increased bronchial secretions and hypersa-
livation have also been related to ketamine
sedations.2,3 Increased bronchial and oral
secretions hinder oral and bronchial-related
procedures, and the suction to remove
excessive mucosal secretions can result in
laryngospasm.2,3 Therefore, adjunctive anti-
cholinergics, such as atropine or glycopyr-
rolate, have been used prior to ketamine
administration. Anticholinergics are used as
a premedication in oral or bronchial pro-
cedures because they reduce mucosal
secretions and the resulting reflexive
bronchospasms, thereby preventing vagus-
induced bradycardia and improving surgical
visibility.4­6 However, anticholinergics
inhibit muscarinic acetylcholine receptors,
exerting antimuscarinic actions such as dry
mouth and fever. Thermoregulation is more
dependent on sweating in children than in
adults, and children may be more suscep-
tible to higher body temperatures after
injection of anticholinergics.7­9
Delayed discharge of paediatric patients
due to postsurgical fever is frequently
observed in patients anaesthetized with
ketamine and adjunctive anticholinergics.
Fever accounts for 4.7% of complications
in paediatric outpatients after surgery,10 and
may be caused by underlying disease,
dehydration after preoperative fasting, or
medication. Surgery is usually postponed in
paediatric patients with fever or cold symp-
toms, reducing the likelihood that under-
lying conditions cause fever in this patient
group. Although dehydration after pre-
operative fasting can cause fever,11 the fact
that body temperature was normal before
surgery suggests that fasting is unlikely to
be the cause of fever in these cases. Of the
medications used routinely in these patients
(including Hartmann's solution, normal
saline, adjunctive anticholinergics, ketamine
and anti-inflammatory analgesic drugs),
anticholinergics alone are reported to cause
fever as an adverse effects.7,8 Ketamine
has also been reported to cause fever, but
this is not generally regarded as an
adverse event.12 The other listed medica-
tions (fluid and anti-inflammatory drugs)
are used to treat fever, and are not the
cause.13
The aim of this study was to evaluate the
fever-causing effects of adjunctive anti-
cholinergics in children under ambulatory
anaesthesia using ketamine.
Patients and methods
Study population
This randomized, double-blind, placebo-
controlled, prospective study recruited
sequential paediatric outpatients aged
12 months ­ 8 years who were scheduled
for procedures requiring ketamine sedation
(including v-tube insertion, simple incision
for cyst removal, and frenuloplasty of the
tongue) between May and December 2014
at the Department of Anaesthesia and Pain
Medicine, Inje University Ilsan Paik
Hospital, Gyeonggi-do, Republic of Korea.
Inclusion criteria were: (i) American Society
of Anaesthesiologists class I14; (ii) surgery
performed between 08.00 and 09.00 (to
minimize variation due to body temperature
fluctuations and duration of preoperative
fasting). Patients who required endotracheal
intubation due to respiratory failure during
the procedure and patients who received
medications other than ketamine were
excluded.
Written informed consent was obtained
from the parents or guardians of the patients,
and the study protocol was approved by the
Institutional Review Board of Inje University
Ilsan Paik Hospital, Gyeonggi-do, Republic
of Korea.

Study design
Patients were randomly assigned between
two groups (using http://randomization.
com): glycopyrrolate- group (group G),
and saline (control) group (group N;
Figure 1). After randomization, a single
researcher (K.W.K.) prepared the study
drugs (0.005 mg/kg glycopyrrolate [Tabinul
injection 0.2 mg/ml; Hana Pharm Co. Ltd.,
Seoul, Republic of Korea], or the same
volume of saline [placebo]) in a blinded
manner. Another researcher (M.H.H.) mea-
sured the body temperature of the patient
prior to surgery using a tympanic thermom-
eter (Braun ThermoScan IRT 4520, Braun
GmbH, Germany) three times in each ear,
and recorded the highest value as the body
temperature for that patient. The second
researcher (M.H.H.) then administered the
prepared study drugs. Ketamine (1 mg/kg
initial dose, 5­10 mg additional dose, intra-
venous bolus) was used for sedation, and no
other drugs were administered until the end
of the study. Oxygen was supplied via nasal
cannula, blood pressure and oxygen satur-
ation were monitored, and heart rate
was monitored via electrocardiogram. The
second researcher (M.H.H.), who was
blinded to the experimental grouping of
the subjects, measured body temperature at
0, 30, 60 and 90 minutes after surgery.
The quantity of oral secretion produced
during the procedure was recorded by a
third researcher (J.H.K.), using a Visual
Analogue Scale (VAS) by indicating a pos-
ition from 0 mm (no secretion) to 100 mm
(maximum secretion); the distance from 0
(in mm) was then measured by the first
researcher (K.W.K.). The fluid infusion rate
was increased when the body temperature of
the patient exceeded 37.8C, and antipyr-
etics were administered when fever contin-
ued after body temperature measurements
were completed. Fever was defined as body
temperature >37.8C at more than one
time point.

Statistical analyses
A preliminary study with ten paediatric
patients indicated that around 30% of
patients receiving anticholinergics devel-
oped postoperative fever, compared with
4.7% of the control group. The incidence of
a type I error was 0.05 and a type II error
was 0.2. Based on these parameters, 42
patients were required in each group (84
patients in total).
Data were presented as n or mean Æ SD.
Between group comparisons were made
using independent t-test, with repeated
measures analysis of variance used to evalu-
ate between group differences in body tem-
perature. All statistical analyses were
performed using MedcalcÕ version 14.8.1
for WindowsÕ (MedCalc Software, Ostend,
Belgium). P-values < 0.05 were considered
to be statistically significant.
Results
The study recruited a total of 84 patients,
who were randomized between group G
(n ¼ 42; 22 males/20 females; mean age
3.5 Æ 1.6 years; age range 1 ­ 7 years) and
group N (23 males/19 females; mean age
3.7Æ 2.2; age range 1 ­ 8 years). Demographic
and clinical characteristics of the patients are
shown in Table 1. There were no significant
between group differences in age, gender,
weight, duration of surgery, ketamine dose
or preoperative body temperature. The inci-
dence of postoperative fever and total volume
of intravenous fluid administered were signifi-
cantly higher, and the quantity of oral secre-
tions was significantly lower in group G than
group N (P¼ 0.02, P¼ 0.03 and P¼ 0.02,
respectively; Table 1).
Data regarding mean postoperative body
temperature are shown in Figure 2. Overall,
mean body temperature was significantly
higher in group G than group N (P ¼ 0.001).
In addition, mean body temperature was
significantly higher in group G than group N
at 30, 60 and 90 min after surgery (P < 0.05
for each comparison, Figure 2). In group G,
mean body temperature was significantly
higher than baseline at all postoperative
time points (0, 30, 60 and 90 min; P < 0.05
for each comparison, Figure 2), In group N,
mean body temperature was significantly
higher than baseline at postoperative 0 and

Discussion
Premedication with an anticholinergic drug
resulted in increased postoperative body tem-
perature compared with placebo in the pre-
sent study. This finding could be regarded as
clinically negligible because the overall mean
body temperature of both groups was 37C ­
37.5C, a small difference from the baseline
body temperature (37.0C), and requiring no
treatment. Higher body temperatures per-
sisted until 90 min after surgery in patients
treated with anticholinergic drugs in the
current study, whereas temperatures in the
placebo group returned to baseline by 60 min
after surgery. Of clinical importance, how-
ever, was the significantly higher incidence of
fever in patients treated with anticholinergic
drugs than those in the placebo group.
The definition of fever used in the present
study was a tympanic temperature of 37.8C.
Fever is generally defined as a rectal tempera-
ture of >38C, but the routine use of a rectal
thermometer is challenging and tympanic
thermometers are preferred. Temperatures
measured using tympanic thermometers
have been reported to be 0.1­0.2C lower
than those measured using a rectal thermom-
eter.15,16 We used a declining body tempera-
ture <37.8C as one of our discharge criteria
in order to ensure the safety of our patients.
As expected, the quantity of oral secretions
was significantly lower in the anticholinergic-
treated group than the placebo group,

(baseline), and at 0, 30, 60 and 90 minutes postsurgery. *P ¼ 0.001 between glycopyrrolate and placebo group;

although there were no secretion-associated
complications observed in any patient. The
increased amount of suction required to deal
with the greater volume of oral secretions in
the placebo group did not increase the dur-
ation of the procedure. The total volume of
administered fluid was higher in the antic-
holinergic-treated group compared with the
placebo group, due to the increase in infusion
of fluids when fever was present.
The effectiveness of adjunctive anticholin-
ergics prior to sedation is unclear, and rou-
tine administration of anticholinergics in
procedures such as bronchoscopy has been
viewed skeptically.17,18 Some recommend the
avoidance of adjunctive anticholinergics in
paediatric patients,19 because of their limited
effect on suppressing salivation while increas-
ing the risk of enhancing the adverse effects
of ketamine.20 Adjunctive anticholinergics
are recommended for the suppression of
hypersalivation and for their antiemetic
effect in ketamine sedation.21 To our know-
ledge, the only report of the relationship
between adjunctive anticholinergics and fever
is a study applying atropine to eyes prior to
ophthalmic examination.22 Our present find-
ings suggest that routine premedication with
adjunctive anticholinergics should not be
recommended in paediatric patients receiving
ketamine sedation, because the increase in
body temperature outweighs any advantages
gained from suppression of oral secretions
during surgery.
There were several limitations to our
study. Various surgical procedures were
included and there was no evaluation of the
surgical difficulties caused by oral secretions.
More informative data could be collected if
procedures that are sensitive to the amount of
oral secretion are studied, and if any surgical
difficulties are evaluated by the surgeon.
In conclusion, routine premedication
with adjunctive anticholinergics should not
be considered in paediatric patients receiv-
ing ketamine sedation due to the increased
risk of fever. Use of anticholinergics should
be limited to procedures that require a high
level of secretion suppression.
