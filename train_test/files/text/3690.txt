Abstract
This study investigates to what extent audiovisual infotainment features can be found in
the narrative structure of television news in three European countries. Content analysis
included a sample of 639 news reports aired in the first 3weeks of September 2013, in
six prime-time TV news broadcasts of Ireland, Spain, and the Netherlands. It was found
that Spain and Ireland included more technical features of infotainment in television news
compared to the Netherlands. Also, the use of infotainment techniques is more often
present in commercial, than in public broadcasting. Finally, the findings indicate no clear
pattern of the use of infotainment techniques across news topics as coded in this study.

and strong economic pressures to generate profits are regarded as key factors in pushing
television news broadcasters to infotainment news formatting (Patterson, 2000). Several
authors have defined infotainment formats as audiovisual techniques and production
styles that emphasize dramatic structures, personalization, and human-interest approaches
in television news stories. Examples of such techniques are eye-catching visuals, camera
shots, movements and transitions, music background, montage techniques, and so on
(Graber, 1994; Schudson, 2003; Vettehen et al., 2011). Because the main goal of infotain-
ment consists of making news and politics engaging and emotionally rich (Thussu,
2007), this form of news presentation has become a successful way to increase public
attachment to news coverage (Hamilton, 2004; Nguyen, 2012).
Although infotainment has often been referred to as a synonym of soft news, its
hybrid style is not confined to deal with a closed list of topics. A number of scholars have
emphasized that the mode of presentation of the news is also decisive in regard to what
can be seen as infotainment (Grabe et al., 2001; Graber, 1994; Thussu, 2007). Drawing
on this framework, this study will move beyond the topic dimension by focusing on the
aspects concerning the visual stylistic devices and audiovisual editing techniques. It
analyses the presence of infotainment in hard news and soft news stories and examines
to what extent infotainment news formatting has taken place in the construction of social,
economic, political, and cultural reality in European television news.
Previous research has shown that television broadcasters experienced a gradual
increase in the development of infotainment formats in the narrative of television news
stories of both American and European countries (Gonzalo et al., 2014; Grabe et al.,
2001, 2003; Graber, 1994; Prior, 2003; Vettehen et al., 2011). An important predictor
for this increase can be found in media commercialization. Specifically, in Europe, the
majority of studies have addressed infotainment from a marketing perspective by
asserting that media commercialization makes a difference in infotainment news con-
tent and formatting on different television stations (Gonzalo et al., 2014). Although
results show that the effects of media commercialization for the European television
market can still be seen in the amount of infotainment news employed by both public
and private channels (Vettehen et al., 2011), the evidence for this relationship is insuf-
ficient. The current study adds to a more general understanding of the penetration of
infotainment in the production of TV news across Europe by examining the influences
of market forces and media policy changes on the degree to which current European
TV news is relying on stylistic elements of infotainment to narrate news topics. More
specifically, this study will focus on the television news market in the Netherlands,
Spain, and Ireland; three European countries that present similarities regarding the
economic structures of the media market for private television channels, but differ-
ences when it comes to government policies regulating public media broadcasting ser-
vices in the three countries.
Conceptualization, origins, and operationalization of
infotainment
The term infotainment refers to the merging of current affairs, news, and entertainment
programming, and reflects modern trends in journalism (Thussu, 2007). In television
Alencar and Kruikemeier 3
news, infotainment is characterized by the use of several dramatic structures, such as
conflicts, personalization, interpersonal interactions, and a variety of audiovisual effects
to enhance emotions in the story (Baym, 2005; Brants, 1998; Graber, 1994). Studies of
infotainment point out that consensus cannot be reached regarding the conceptualization
and origins of the term (García Avilés, 2007; Stark, 1997). Some authors argue that info-
tainment dates back to 1960s and 1970s in the local news broadcasts of the United States
(Gonzalo et al., 2014; Stark, 1997). Elements of narrative structures characteristic of
fictional genres were adapted and used in local news programs as a new commercial
strategy to attract the audience and later on, it spread across American national TV chan-
nels (Gonzalo et al., 2014).
Yet, interestingly, some scholars provide evidence to support the claim that infotain-
ment has actually emerged between the late 1980s and early 1990s, when the phenome-
non was largely spread in Western television channels (Prado, 2007; Vettehen et al.,
2011). They note that the increasing popularity of commercial broadcasts against public
networks explains the emanation of infotainment. In fact, one of the main reasons for the
blurring of fact and fiction, news and drama, popular culture and reality, is rooted in the
proliferation of cable channels and Internet sites that led to long-term transformations of
the business and production models operated by news organizations (Bennett, 2005).
Also, a shift in journalism standards towards the construction of dramatic sociopolitical
scenarios is another intermediate factor that reinforces the use of infotainment in the nar-
rative of the news (Altheide, 2004; Bennett, 2005). Bennett (2005) points out that the
presentation of TV news stories to viewers offers similar characteristics of emotionally
compelling narratives, such as television series and soap operas.
As a consequence, this topic has raised concerns about the quality of news media both
in public and academic spheres, arguing that infotainment trivializes news and current
affairs resulting in serious implications for factual political knowledge and opinion form-
ing (Baum, 2003; Moy et al., 2005). Infotainment has often been connected to pejorative
terms, such as tabloidization and sensationalism (Baym, 2005; Grabe et al., 2001;
Schudson, 2003), contributing to a decrease in political knowledge conveyed by the
media. The problem allegedly is that infotainment in television news complies with nar-
ratives that banalize even the most serious subjects by promoting entertaining televisual
spectacles and dramatic storylines (Altheide, 2004; Graber, 1994).
From this viewpoint, infotainment news has negative effects on how viewers process
the news. However, a number of studies have demonstrated that infotainment news char-
acteristics have some beneficial effects on message comprehension and recall, given the
potential of its features to convey narrative patterns that evoke high levels of emotions
among viewers (Vettehen et al., 2011). Früh and Wirth (as cited in Machill et al., 2007)
have analyzed the effects of various degrees of infotainment on the retention of televi-
sion contents. The authors argue that the moderate use of certain infotainment features,
such as cut frequency, camera movement, movement of objects, use of music background
and special effects, results in the perception of quality information and the increase of
retention performances. Instead, the negative use of these elements affects the perceived
quality of information leading to a decrease in retention levels. For instance, a combina-
tion of multiple infotainment characteristics may lead to poor outcomes in terms of recall
performance among viewers (Grabe et al., 2003; Lang et al., 2000).
4 Journalism 
It is not, however, difficult to foresee that the increasing penetration of technical info-
tainment features in the narrative of the news plays a crucial role in shaping the implica-
tions of the phenomenon for audience processing of public information, as well as for
democratic discourses. Recently, scholars have devoted greater attention to empirical
analysis of formal features of television news, arguing that a focus on topics/events is
insufficient to assess narrative patterns that influence the way infotainment is actually
framed in the news (Grabe et al., 2001, 2003; Machill et al., 2007).
Narrative structure of television infotainment news
The structure of audiovisual narration in television infotainment news consists of organ-
izing and articulating the various technical elements and editing techniques that provoke
sensory and emotional reactions among viewers. Various audiovisual techniques defin-
ing infotainment news have been explored in studies conducted in both American and
European TV news programs (Djerf-Pierre, 2000; Gonzalo et al., 2014; Grabe et al.,
2003; Machill et al., 2007; Vettehen et al., 2011). These include the use and frequency of
close-ups, camera movements, frequency of camera shots and transitions, post-produc-
tion techniques, and audio manipulations. This study examines the various formal pro-
duction feature categories that are characteristics of infotainment, but also to integrate
new structural techniques deriving from fictional narratives that actually have the poten-
tial to include infotainment in the story. This section presents the first conceptual phase
of the research by providing a detailed description of the audiovisual features used to
identify the presence of infotainment in our sample. In this study, the audiovisual narra-
tive techniques fall into six categories (see Table 1 for an overview).
The type of image category refers to the organization of infotainment news accord-
ing to its visual expression. In this study, this category concerns the use of stock news
images where the image does not coincide with the content (Brosius, 1993). This genre
often favors a choice of visuals that impacts viewers and promotes the spectacle of
news and the integration of dramatic elements in the production of television news
(Lester and Cottle, 2009). The shot length category refers to the use of close-ups. This
shows very little background, and concentrates on either a face, or a specific detail of
mise-en-scène.
The third audiovisual narrative category refers to camera movement techniques. They
have the potential to generate greater emotional involvement when exploring techniques
that feature more movement. In this study, there are four basic techniques that are often
used to engage audiences: zoomshots, handheld, panning, boom (Gonzalo et al., 2014:
90). Zoom lens contains a mechanism that changes the magnification of an image and
gives the impression of movement and excitement in a scene where it does not exist. As
to content analyses, Grabe et al. (2001: 641) analyzed the presence of zoom camera
lenses in US TV newsmagazines. The results show that a `generous use of zoom move-
ments indicates a sensational production style' (Grabe et al., 2001: 647). In what refers
to handheld camera movements, they can make the audience feel as if they are part of a
scene, rather than viewing it from a detached, frozen position. Because handheld camera
is used to heighten tension and give realism to events, this technique is included as a
potentially infotainment feature. Panning is another structural feature that gives the shot
Alencar and Kruikemeier 5
a feeling of movement and speed. It is used to give the viewer a panoramic view of a set.
This can be used to establish a scene. Aerial drones give a bird's eye view (boom). This
works and looks similar to a construction crane. It is used for high sweeping shots or to
follow the action of a subject (García Jiménez, 2003).
The forms of transition category illustrate the relationship between shots and how
they work together to form narrative meanings. Transition forms are editing techniques
used to escalate the visual sequence with the purpose to draw and hold the viewer's atten-
tion to the issues (Zettl, 2006). These types of visual resources can improve viewer's
understanding and increase emotions as they provide more visually attractive news sto-
ries that can enhance news consumer engagement (Baym, 2005; Grabe et al., 2001;
Schaefer, 2001). Schudson (2003) warned that the increasing production of news that
focuses on sensationalism can limit the quality of journalism, and therefore, the ability of
the public to make informed social and political decisions. Zaller (2003) counters this
claim by calling for a change in new standards for news quality. Zaller argues that the use
of entertaining editing techniques and `engaging displays' in news items helps focus the
public's attention on important issues. Based on Grabe et al. (2001), this study identifies
three stylized transitions that are often present in infotainment news packages: dissolves,

fades, and wipes. The image dissolves' technique features a gradual transition from shot
to shot in which the two images temporarily overlap (Smith, 1991; Zettl, 2006). In the
case of `fades' or `dips', the picture either goes gradually to black (fade-out) or appears
gradually on the screen from black (fade-in), signifying, much like a theater curtain, a
definite beginning or end of sequence (Zettl, 2006). Wipe appears to supplant an image
by wiping it off the screen (Smith, 1991; Zettl, 2006); it is a technique that draws atten-
tion to itself and acts as a clear marker of change.
The montage editing category is defined as a series of processes that impose into the
package the news worker's interpretation of the event (Zettl, 1999: 292). Infotainment
narratives tend to explore more editing styles in news production. Zettl (1999) indicates
four main types of montage techniques in news package. First is the (1) metric montage,
which according to Zettl (1999) features a series of related and unrelated events images
that are flashed on the screen at more or less equally spaced intervals; the scene is viewed
as occurring faster. The fast cutting of images is used to convey higher tension and it is
adapted to the rhythm of the music, emulating the style of video clip; (2) analytical mon-
tage means editing a scene to show cause-and-effect; this technique usually promotes
engagement and learning by requiring the viewer to fill in the blanks; (3) comparison
montage compares similar themes as expressed in dissimilar events; this technique
depicts a conflict or similarity between two subjects by presenting two points in time
within one sequence; (4) collision montage uses opposing imagery to suggest a third
concept. In his longitudinal study, Schaefer (2001) has identified an increase over the
past three decades in the number of montage editing techniques in television news. His
study assumes that hard news ­ often associated with the use of more realistic/dry
accounts featured by low levels of montage techniques ­ are developing narrative modes
that further explore infotainment resources and put more emphasis on dramatic elements
(conflict, emotion, and personalization).
Finally, the audio expression category was defined by the use of music in news items.
It is a crucial technical component in the articulation of infotainment and part of the edit-
ing process. Studies show that music contributes to give rise to emotions, drama, and
humor experienced by viewers (Seidman, 1981). Grabe et al. (2001) and Vettehen et al.
(2011) have also measured the frequency and duration of music occurrences in their
studies.
The television news market in the Netherlands, Spain, and
Ireland
In the early 1990s, the liberalization and deregulation of the media in most European
countries had opened the doors for unprecedented competition between public television
broadcasters and the newly arrived domestic and foreign commercial rivals with their
popular and entertaining programming (García Avilés, 2007). In what concerns the
Dutch case, the year of 1989 was marked by the end of the monopoly of public service
broadcasting with the rise of commercial broadcasts (Vettehen et al., 2011: 100). RTL
Nieuws was the first TV news program to compete with NOS Journaal, covering both
domestic and international news. In 1990, three commercial broadcast channels were
launched in Spain: Tele-5, Antena 3, and Canal Plus. As a result, the public broadcaster
Alencar and Kruikemeier 7
RTVE (Radiotelevisión Española) experienced a decline in audience numbers (Medina
and Ojer, 2010). The Irish broadcasting landscape also experienced dynamic changes
over the past years. National competition in television news market has been attributed
to national economic growth, with the launch of TV3 in 1998, which is privately owned
by a British private-equity group (Rafter et al., 2014). Until then, the public broadcast
channel RTÉ had the full benefit of the available domestic advertising and its audience
competition was limited to the UK services (i.e. BBC, UTV/ITV, and Channel 4).
As a result of the multiplication of the number of TV broadcasting stations in the three
countries, public broadcasting services started responding more and more to production
patterns that clash with the public mission to serve democratic values and increase citi-
zen knowledge about public affairs (Blumler, 1992). The intense competition for time
and attention of audiences has gradually led public broadcasters to provide new formats
and reporting styles featuring infotainment characteristics that were most commonly
used in the new private channels (Hamilton, 2004).
More recently, the studies of Vettehen et al. (2011) and Gonzalo et al. (2014) have
examined the penetration of audiovisual infotainment features in public and commercial
television news broadcasts in the Netherlands and Spain, respectively. Their research indi-
cates that the level of infotainment features have increased in Dutch and Spanish televi-
sion news and that existing programs, such as the case of public TV news programs, have
reacted to new programs by increasing the amount of infotainment in their news stories.
Since 2012, the Dutch public broadcaster NOS has launched a new format for the NOS
Journaal, which prioritizes stories that are relevant to viewers in detriment of the signifi-
cance of facts (Gelauff, 2012). In the actual Spain's media landscape, infotainment has
been consolidated in mainstream television channels with slight differences across public
and private networks (Gonzalo et al., 2014). Studies on the tabloidization of the Irish
media show two factors that can explain the demand for `tabloidization'in the Irish media
sphere (Barrett, 2000). The first concerns the influence of British newspapers on the style
of the Irish press. The close relationship between Ireland and the United Kingdom ensures
that many Irish people were regularly reading British newspapers (Barrett, 2000). The
second refers to the competitive Irish newspaper sphere, with the increase of the number
of news media in the country. In this regard, it is important to mention that the majority of
households had easy access to UK and other international channels, contributing to a
highly competitive television market for domestic stations (Rafter et al., 2014).
Consequently, the penetration of infotainment is the result of increasing market pressures
and can impact differently on varying media markets (Esser, 1999). In this sense, the political
context is an important predictor of media dependence on economic forces. As Strömbäck
(2008) puts it, `the political system sets the institutional and regulatory boundaries for the
markets within which the media are required to operate' (p. 241). Increasing independence
from politics is thus strongly correlated with an increase in media commercialization. In Spain,
both public and private broadcasting no longer operate under the same political and economic
models, which might influence the production of news. Since 2009, public media organiza-
tions in Spain do not convey advertising contents, and, as a consequence, these do not consti-
tute one of its sources of funding (Medina and Ojer, 2010). To some extent, different broadcast
ownership in the Netherlands and Ireland fall under the same economic and political regula-
tions (Rafter et al., 2014; Vettehen et al., 2011). Overall, public and commercial broadcasts in
8 Journalism 
both countries became more dependent on market funds, whereas in Spain, broadcast owner-
ship fairs equally in terms of public and private funding (public broadcasting services depend
on the State while commercial stations depend on the market). So, in sum, it could be sug-
gested that differences across countries can also be explained by policy changes in public
broadcast services of the three nations. The first research hypothesis follows from this:
H1. Irish and Dutch television news broadcasts will use more audiovisual infotain-
ment features compared to Spanish television news programs.
As noted above, the new conditions imposed by the market in the search for the high-
est audience ratings determine the new situation with television channels in the three
comparative nations. From the 1990s onwards, the time devoted to advertising has
increased considerably (Prado, 2007; Vettehen et al., 2011). Increased revenues and eco-
nomic growth for both private and public television have taken place in the Netherlands
and Ireland. The funding of public broadcast services in both countries has been pro-
vided by both commercial and public sources, while commercial television channels
depended heavily on advertising and sponsoring.1 After the elimination of advertising as
a source of revenue for public media corporations in Spain, competition for the market-
ing share has increased among commercial broadcasting services (Medina and Ojer,
2010). Given this background, private broadcasts in the three countries may be more
vulnerable to infotainment. This leads to the second research hypothesis:
H2. Commercial news broadcasts will use more audiovisual infotainment techniques
in their stories than public news broadcasts.
Typically, the formal characteristics of infotainment news are more likely to be found
in the structure of soft news than that of hard news stories. The latter is characterized by
the use of a more formal structure, while soft news features storytelling forms and edit-
ing techniques to hook viewers, and to reel them in (Graber, 1994). In this light, it is
argued that the narrative found in `soft news'resembles the characteristics defining info-
tainment (Patterson, 2000). This study does not aim to quantify the thematic selection of
infotainment in television news programs of the three countries, but the extent to which
formal infotainment features are present in the narrative form of hard news and soft
news. In other words, this study examines whether a better fit exists between soft news
topics and infotainments features compared to hard news topics and infotainments fea-
tures. The third research hypothesis follows from this:
H3. The use of audiovisual narrative features in soft news is greater than in hard news
topics.
Method
Design and sampling method
Our content analysis included a sample of 639 news reports aired in the first 3weeks of
September 2013, in six prime-time TV news broadcasts of Ireland, Spain, and the
Alencar and Kruikemeier 9
Netherlands, one public and one commercial TV news broadcast in each country. Our
selection of public broadcasting channels included Nine o'clock news (Ireland),
Telediario 2 (Spain), and NOS Journaal (Netherlands). On the side of commercial TV
news,weanalyzedTV3News(Ireland),Noticias2(Spain),andRTLNieuws(Netherlands).
Because our analysis is concerned with the presence of infotainment elements rather than
focused on a specific topic or period, three full weeks of analysis of each news outlet
were used to answer our research questions and test the hypotheses proposed. No major
event occurred in the period of analysis, such as elections, holidays, or important sports
events that could potentially affect the study results.
News reports were selected as unit of analysis due to the high visibility of technical
components in this type of format. For being a self-contained story, a news report format
facilitates the operation of infotainment narratives and the description of their constituent
elements. Beyond this, the selection of the news report content and format as unit of
analysis is chosen for being directly related to television news production in the frame-
work of the so-called News Industry (Pew Research Center's Journalism Project, 2014).
In this sense, news report is one of the media products that need to provide information
in a manner that is profitable and in compliance with the needs of shareholders and
viewers.
The coders were trained and supervised during a week of coding meetings at the
University of Amsterdam. Intercoder reliability was calculated based on a subsample of
14 and 15 - in two coder sessions ­ TV news items using pairwise percentage agreement.
We found that this was continually above 64.4percent and thus indicated that the meas-
urements were reliable.
Measurements
In order to examine the narrative elements characterizing infotainment in the news items
from the six television news programs, this article has focused on the narrative structural
variables that indicate the use of infotainment in the piece. We take into account the top-
ics of a given news item as well as its format and audiovisual narrative elements.
Independent variables. The variable type of news broadcasts was defined as public and
commercial television news programs, including one type of news outlet per country
(0=`public' and 1=`commercial', M=0.43, standard deviation (SD)=0.50). This code
allowed for the assessment of possible differences regarding the use of infotainment in
countries that have a public as well as commercial broadcasting. The variable country
was a nominal variable (1=`Spain', 32.8%; 2=`Ireland', 34.9%; 3=`The Netherlands',
32.3%). The thematic selection of infotainment is often linked with issues that are most
likely to impact viewers and increase visual spectacle (Stark, 1997). Our study is con-
cerned with assessing the treatment of infotainment in both hard news and soft news
topics. Most studies tend to classify hard news as news that contains information on
public policy while soft news is often connected to news that are `more sensational,
personality-centered, less time-bound and more incident based than other news' (Patter-
son, 2000: 4). For hard and soft news topics, we use eight different news sections con-
veyed in our TV news sample. Hard news topics include categories of `foreign news'
(32.1%), `business/economic news' (13.0%), and `politics' (17.1%). The category of
10 Journalism 
foreign news consists of news on politics and economy of foreign countries. Soft news
topics include `society/culture/arts' (15.6%), `accidents/catastrophes/crime' (15.2%),
`war news/protests' (1.1%), `Sports' (5.5%), and `Weather' (0.5%). Table 2 presents the
number of news stories of the six TV news programs during the period analyzed.
Dependent variables. The audiovisual narrative categories proposed in our analysis were
derived from the theoretical framework mentioned before. They were operationalized to
examine the technical characteristics of infotainment in television news (Gonzalo et al.,
2014). Following others, we pay special attention to audiovisual effects in TV news pro-
duction and define the different resources that contribute to the spectacularization of
information. Among these technical features, the most relevant ones for our topic of
inquiry refer to recoding styles that privilege movement, the use of music, camera shots,
post-production effects, editing of images, and profusion of transitions. Following
these studies, we coded six distinctive technical elements that indicate the use of
infotainment.
Type of image.It was defined by the presence of stock news images (M=0.04,
SD=0.20; pairwise agreement=91.1%).
Shot length.This variable was measured as the number of close-ups (M=0.65,
SD=0.48; pairwise agreement=90.5%) in the news package.
Camera movement techniques.These variables were defined by the presence of
zoomshots (M=0.42, SD=0.49; pairwise agreement=82.2%), handheld (M=0.63,
SD=0.48; pairwise agreement=86.7%), panning (M=0.71, SD=0.45; pairwise agree-
ment=64.4%), and boom (M=0.16, SD=0.37; pairwise agreement=95.6%).
Forms of transition.The number of transitions were counted, which were measured
by the number of dissolves (M=0.36, SD=0.48; pairwise agreement=81.0%), fades
(M=0.04, SD=0.20; pairwise agreement=100.0%), and wipes (M=0.02, SD=0.14;
pairwise agreement=95.2%).

Narrative structure or montage techniques. Montages techniques were defined by the
presence of (1) metric montage (M=0.17, SD=0.37; pairwise agreement=91.1%), (2)
analytical montage (M=0.91, SD=0.28; pairwise agreement=82.2%), (3) comparison
montage (M=0.60, SD=0.49; pairwise agreement=64.4%), and (4) collision montage
(M=0.14, SD=0.35; pairwise agreement=68.9%).
Audio expression.Audio expression was defined by the presence of music (M=0.08,
SD=0.28; pairwise agreement=95.2%).
Control variables. It is very likely that the amount of technical characteristics of infotain-
ment is higher in longer news reports, than in shorter news reports (i.e. as we count the
amount of technical features, in long news reports, the likelihood the program uses dif-
ferent technical features is higher, because there is simply more time to use them). For
that reason, in our analysis, by using the variable time, we will control for the length of
the news items in seconds (M=137.57, SD=81.19).
Results
First, we examined the extent to which there are differences in technical characteristics
of infotainment in television news across countries and between public and commercial
broadcasting programs using descriptive analyses. Results show that some features were
frequently present, for instance the use of analytics (91.4%) and pannings (71.0%) were
on average very popular. Other features were less popular, for instance the use of wipes
(1.9%), stock (4.1%), and fades (4.1%). This indicates that the use of technical character-
istics of infotainment generally differs. Some features are overly present in the news
programs that we included, while other technical features are not often included (see
Table 3 for more detailed description per country and broadcasting system).
Interestingly, following our expectations, we found differences across countries. We
want to refer to a few interesting findings. By using analysis of variance (ANOVA) with
Bonferroni post-hoc tests, we found that, in general, the handheld and stock images fea-
tures were more often present in Spain than in Ireland (both p<.01) and the Netherlands
(both p<.01). In addition, the use of dissolves was less often present in the Netherlands
than in Spain (p<.01) and Ireland (p<.01). The use of metrics was more often present in
the Netherlands than in Spain (p<.01) and Ireland (p<.01). Also the use of comparison
was more often present in the Netherlands and the least present in Ireland (all p<.01).
Because these descriptive analyses show that more differences were found for the
Netherlands compared to the two other countries, we will use the Netherlands as our
general reference category in the next analyses.
To examine the use of technical features that characterize infotainment accurately, we
conducted a logistic regression analysis with the technological features as dependent vari-
ables. Country dummies, a public/private broadcasting variable, and the news section
were used as predictor variables. Additionally, we include the length of the news items as
a control variable (see Table 4). In regards to our first hypothesis, we found that the pro-
grams in the Netherlands contained less technical infotainment features than those in
Ireland and Spain. More precisely, we found that zoomshots, handhelds, pannings,
12 Journalism 
dissolves, analytics, and music were more often present in Ireland and Spain, than in the
Netherlands (all p<.05). In addition, fades were also more often present in Spanish and
Irish news (respectively, p<.01 and p=.06), than in Dutch news. Stock news images were
more often included in Spanish news than in Irish news (p<.01). Surprisingly, we found
that some narrative structure or montage techniques were not often present in the
Netherlands compared to Spain and Ireland. Especially the use of metrics was less popular
in Spain and Ireland, in contrast to the Netherlands (all p<.01). The use of comparison
was less often present in Ireland (p<.01) and the use of collision was not often included
in Spain (p<.05), compared to the Netherlands. When we used Spain as a reference cat-
egory in the logistic analyses, we found that Spanish news contained significantly more

technical infotainment features compared to the other countries (e.g. handheld, fades, and
wipes). This means that we found no clear evidence for hypothesis 1.
Furthermore, we examined the role of public and commercial broadcasting in the use
of technical infotainment features. Following our expectations, we found that commer-
cial news broadcasts use more audiovisual infotainment techniques in their stories than
public news broadcasts in the three countries. More precisely, close-ups, handhelds, pan-
ning, analytics, and comparisons were more often used in commercial than in public
broadcasting programs (all p<.05). Thus, we found support for hypothesis 2.
Finally, we examined the role of news section in explaining why some technological
features were used more often in one section, compared to another. In general, we found
that the use of technical characteristics of infotainment in specific news sections is dif-
ficult to predict (see Table 4). The evidence is less clear-cut then for the countries and
broadcasting type. For foreign news, handhelds (p=.01) and comparisons (p=.01) are
more often used compared to political news. Economic news included less dissolves
(p=.01), but more stock news images (p=.01) compared to political news. Societal news
contained more close-ups, pannings, comparisons, and music (all p<.05) in contrast to
political news. Crime news contains less dissolves (p=.01) than political news. Finally,
sports news contained more pannings, cranes (booms), comparisons, and music than
political news (all p<.05). These findings indicate that in hard news sections (such as
political news, foreign and economic news), technical features of infotainment are used,
but evidence is not clear-cut, as some features are overly present while others are not.
Therefore, we do not find support for hypothesis 3.
Conclusion
The current study draws on a vast and relevant literature on infotainment research to
assess the presence of different audiovisual techniques, previously used as indicators of
the phenomenon in private and public news broadcasts of Spain, the Netherlands, and
Ireland. By using extensive content analyses of television news in the three different
countries, we expected to find more infotainment in the Dutch and Irish broadcast sam-
ple as they are driven by a stronger inclination towards market funds. However, we found
that Spain and Ireland included much more technical features or characteristics of info-
tainment in television news compared to the Netherlands. There are two very likely
explanations for these results. First, the strong economic crisis in Spain and Ireland ­
between 2008 and 2009 - had an impact on media, and broadcasting in particular, with a
decrease of advertising revenues (Medina and Ojer, 2010). The severe consequences of
the economic downturn for media organizations in the two countries may justify the
increment of more infotainment features in their news programming, mainly in commer-
cial broadcasts.
Second, many scholars argue that the presence of a strong public broadcasting service
is a factor that affects the dominance of market forces (Cushion, 2012; Rafter et al.,
2014). In the case of RTVE in Spain, the identity of the public broadcasting system is not
so strong, and that was one of the main reasons why the Spanish government decided to
nationalize the public system (Medina and Ojer, 2010). Although public news broadcasts
in Spain are entirely funded by the government, it is still possible to see significant traces
Alencar and Kruikemeier 15
of infotainment in their TV news items, as they want to follow their commercial counter-
parts and provide the same attractive news styles mixed with entertainment (Gonzalo
et al., 2014).
Consequently, as we expected, we found that the use of infotainment techniques is
more often present in commercial (or private) broadcasting, than in public broadcasting.
Differences between both types of television stations can therefore be explained not only
by economic factors but also by political forces regulating different broadcast ownership
in each nation. Aside from the economic­financial crisis, a shift in the governance of
public corporation has generated more competition for advertisement among commer-
cial media organizations and foreign commercial channels in Spain. This policy change
suggests one possible explanation for the increasing integration of infotainment features
in the news contents of private domestic television news editions in Spain.
In the Netherlands and Ireland, the fact that commercial broadcasting services com-
pete directly with public broadcasting for adverting as their sole source of income is
closely related with greater use of infotainment techniques in their news programming
(Vettehen et al., 2011). Due to the competitive market of television channels in Ireland
and the Netherlands, the presence of infotainment in public service broadcasts does not
fall short when compared to private channels in the two countries. This finding corrobo-
rates with others (Vettehen et al., 2011) who argue that Dutch public broadcasts have
invested in the creation of attractive news offers that could compete with that of the pri-
vate networks, by increasing the amount of infotainment characteristics in their stories.
Finally, we expected a greater use of audiovisual narrative features in soft news than in
hard news topics. The results point, however, to other findings. Although we found that
some technical features of infotainment were more present in soft news topics, such as
societal news, crime news, and sports news, the evidence is less clear-cut, as our findings
indicate that in some cases economic news can also contain more technical infotainment
features than political news. Thus, the findings indicate no clear pattern of the use of info-
tainment techniques across news topics as coded in this study. The findings are largely in
line with a multi-dimensional approach to defining the different types of news (Baum,
2003; Graber, 1994), in which the topic dimension is not sufficient to conceptualize hard
and soft news and a focus on the style dimensions can help shape relevant changes of the
structure of news with the introduction of infotainment. Future studies should look for
ways to develop a more integrated approach to the analysis of formal features in television
news in order to assess how different types of news are incorporating these features.
One of the main contributions of this study relies on the comparative approach to the
analysis of infotainment features in television news of three European countries.
Although infotainment was generally present in TV news broadcasts of the sampling
countries, the results of our analysis showed specific patterns regarding the presence of
indicators of infotainment in each country. Another important contribution concerns the
development of a narrative approach to the analysis of infotainment, by exploring vari-
ous codes that have not been systematically explored in content analysis of television
news. The use of audiovisual narrative features in the news has increased and its impact
on news reporting about matters of political and social significance raises questions
about the quality of the news both from the perspective of who consumes and who pro-
duces the news.
16 Journalism 
Some limitations of this study need to be highlighted. First, further studies should be
able to extend the sample period. The analysis of longer periods allows for investigating
the evolution of infotainment news in mainstream TV news channels of the three coun-
tries. Investigating the use of different infotainment features in European news over time
can offer rich insights into the impact of the phenomenon on political knowledge and
public opinion. Second, this study is limited to the analysis of infotainment narratives in
prime-time television news programs. Therefore, future studies should include a larger
sample of news broadcast to examine the extent to which infotainment trends can be
confirmed across program types and media platforms.
Despite these limitations, the methodological approach of the current study proposed
has taken a step forward to cross-cultural approaches to the analysis of infotainment
features in European television news. Moreover, a cross-national comparative analysis
can open new avenues for this line of research by assessing whether infotainment fea-
tures continue to exert great influence on production patterns that characterize modern
news broadcasts in Europe.

Note
1. Although the public broadcasting system in Ireland relies on dual funding, news and
current affairs cannot receive funding from the government and have to rely entirely on
advertisement. However, the identity of the Irish public broadcaster is still very strong,
which might prevent the use of infotainment in their production of news (Rafter et al.,
2014).
