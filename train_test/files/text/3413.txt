Abstract: Using a psychometric methodology the present study explored the associations
between natural environments and experiential feeling states. The effects of the frequency
of participants (N = 90) experience of the natural environment and of the location of their
childhood upbringing were also investigated. Ten natural environments mapped on to an
orthogonal two-component experiential structure labeled Eudemonia (ostensibly positive
feelings) and Apprehension (ostensibly negative feelings). Generally, the more natural
environments tended to be associated with higher eudemonia and higher apprehension, the
less natural environments with both lower eudemonia and lower apprehension. In line with
expectations, participants from rural childhood locations, compared with urban participants,
reported less Apprehension and participants with greater experience of the natural
environment, compared with participants with less experience, reported greater Eudemonia
and less Apprehension. Results are discussed in relation to environmental experiences and
affective psychological wellbeing.

Introduction
As a species, we have spent many hundreds of thousands of years living and
evolving symbiotically with our natural surroundings. Indeed, humankind may have a
particular need to be near nature, in its many forms, in order to remain psychologically
healthy: "Cultural beliefs and practices that are inconsistent with our evolutionary
constitution and physical environments that stray too far from that in which we evolved
may compromise our psychological well-being" (Gullone, 2000, p. 311).
Moreover, from an evolutionary perspective, some environments and characteristics
of those environments may be more attractive to us than are others and this may influence,
among other things, habitat selection (Heerwagen and Orians, 1993; Orians and
Human-natural environment relationships
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 9(3). 2011. -452-
Heerwagen, 1992). It has been argued, for instance, that the African savannah may have
been a primary site for mankind's early development, offering optimal features for safety,
shelter and subsistence (Orians, 1998). Some research has shown savannah-like landscapes,
denoted by open woodland with little undergrowth, to be preferred to other natural
environments such as deciduous and coniferous forests (Falk and Balling, 2010) partly as a
function of the density of forests and woodlands (Herzog and Kutzli, 2002). As modern
urban parks may be reminiscent of savanna-like landscapes (Orians and Heerwagen, 1992),
this may be part of the explanation for the positive relationship found between house prices
and the proximity to and size of recreational parks (Poudyal, Hodges, and Merrett, 2009).
Peoples motivations to visit inner-city parks may also be partly due to the social
interactions that take place there (Burgess, Harrison, and Limb, 1988; Krenichyn, 2004), a
research finding which has found support in research focused on the use and benefits of
gardens (Bhatti and Church, 2001; Clayton, 2007; Ulrich, 1999). Conversely, other
evidence seems to suggest that the restorative potential of urban green spaces, particularly
parks, may be due to the relative absence of people (Grahn and Stigsdotter, 2010).
However, there also exists a small body of evidence that seems to suggest
preferences for environments other than savanna-like landscapes, particularly for
environments comprising bodies of water such as lakes and coastlines (Hartmann and
Apaolaza, 2010; Ogunseitan, 2005). In addition to the idea that environments containing
bodies of water may be important sites for recreation, sustenance and socializing (Kaplan
and Kaplan, 1989; Regan and Horn, 2005; Tuan, 1974), recent research has demonstrated
that built environments containing water may evoke equal levels of preference as do green-
only environments (White, Smith, Humphryes, Pahl, Snelling, and Depledge, 2010).
There is also tentative evidence to suggest that positive reactions to the natural
environment may be a fairly widespread, if not ubiquitous, phenomenon (Korpela, Hartig,
Kaiser, and Fuhrer, 2001; Newell, 1997). However, some research has indicated that
natural environments may evoke negative reactions (e.g., Staats, Gatersleben, and Hartig,
1997). The aim of the present study was to discover the relationship between different
natural environments and different experiential feeling states. Furthermore, the pattern of
the relationships between experiential feeling states and the extent of experience of the
natural environment was also investigated, in order to gather evidence on how peoples
depth of experience corresponds with their affective responses to the natural environment.
Biophilia
The biophilia hypothesis proposes that there is a fundamental human need to
affiliate with life and life-like processes (e.g., Kahn, 1999). Biophilia has been described as
our affective responses to nature and natural environments, each of which has its own
"peculiar meaning rooted in the distant genetic past" (Wilson, 1984, p. 113). Biophilia has
been loosely defined as "an innate tendency to focus upon life and lifelike forms, and in
some instances to affiliate with them emotionally" (Wilson, 2002, p. 134). Affective
reactions to certain stimuli can undoubtedly be learned or be derived from conditioning,
such as repeated exposure, but importantly allied to the biophilia hypothesis is the idea that
"specific sensory cues can elicit...innate affective or emotional meaning" (Blascovich and
Mendes, 2000. p. 71). Much evidence is accumulating regarding the affective relationships
that may develop with the natural environment in its many forms (e.g., Ulrich, 1993). For
Human-natural environment relationships

instance, the giving and receiving of flowers can have both short and long term positive
effects on mood, social interactions, emotions and memory (Haviland-Jones, Rossario,
Wilson, and McGuire, 2005).
It has been argued, however, that the genetic basis to any biophilic predisposition
may be a weak one, requiring the addition of learning, culture and experience of nature to
optimize biophilic tendencies (Kahn, 1999; Kellert, 2002). Dubos (1980) has argued that
active engagement with the natural environment rather than passive observation may
awaken the dormant genetic, psychological traits that enabled our ancestors to survive in
the natural environment, which have been subdued by relatively recent social and cultural
forces. Similarly, Orr (1993) has suggested that the reintroduction of humans to nature,
particularly in terms of allowing children greater unsupervised play in natural
environments, is both necessary to foster biophilia and for what it means to be human.
Indeed, several perspectives have been prominent regarding the importance for
psychological wellbeing of contact with the natural environment. Ulrichs functional-
evolutionary perspective suggests an importance for humankind to be in contact with the
natural environment for a range of cognitive and affective functions, such as problem
solving, creativity and stress reduction (e.g., Ulrich, 1993). In addition, Kaplan and
Kaplans (1989) attention restoration theory (ART) proposes that the natural environment
may provide a range of important qualities (e.g., ,,fascination) that aid recovery from over-
exertion of psychological capacities.
Experience of the natural environment and positive reactions
Exposure to the natural environment has been shown to have a range of
psychological benefits such as the restoration of cognitive abilities diminished by mental
over-exertion, stress reduction and the evocation of positive emotions (Abraham,
Sommerhalder, and Abel, 2010; Groenewegen et al., 2006). For example, having views of
trees from ones home may positively predict how relaxed and comfortable people feel
(Kaplan, 2001) and trees in inner-city and suburban environments may be related to
increased feelings of safety (Kuo, Bacaicoa, and Sullivan, 1998). Research indicates that
indirect, even subliminal exposure to natural environments (Korpela, Klemettilä, and
Hietanen, 2002; Schultz and Tabanico, 2007) tends to elicit largely positive affective
reactions (Ulrich, 1993; van den Berg, Koole, and van der Wulp, 2003). Moreover, it has
been argued that there is a strong positive relationship between how restorative an
environment is perceived to be and preferences for that environment (Korpela et al., 2001;
van den Berg, Hartig, and Staats, 2007).
A growing corpus of research and opinion has suggested that childhood experiences
of nature may be important for the development of deep and meaningful bonds with the
natural environment (Gross and Lane, 2007; Kahn, 1999). For instance, Lohr and Pearson-
Mims (2005) found that participants who reported having some minimal childhood
experiences of planting trees and the care of indoor plants, compared to those participants
who reported never having done these things, were more likely to perceive trees as having a
calming effect and as having personal and symbolic meaning.
Furthermore, evidence seems to suggest that elements of some of these natural
environments are able to positively affect people's social interactions (Groenewegen, van
den Berg, de Vries, and Verheij, 2006). For example, the presence of plants within a
Human-natural environment relationships

laboratory setting has been shown to elicit both greater generosity in participants than does
a laboratory setting devoid of plants (Weinstein, Przybyiski, and Ryan, 2009), and, within a
naturalistic study of classroom behavior, with children's self-reported levels of friendliness
(Han, 2009).
Eudemonic and hedonic wellbeing
Psychological wellbeing may be conceived of as comprising two distinct
dimensions (Ryff, Singer, and Love 2005; Waterman, 1993). First, Hedonism, typically
measured by subjective well-being (SWB), comprises indices to gauge general negative
and positive affect and life satisfaction (Schwarz and Strack, 1999). However, the ability of
this concept to reflect the more meaningful and to some extent more intrinsic aspects of
peoples well-being (i.e., those that are inherently satisfying rather than based upon
external approval) has been challenged (Ryan and Deci, 2001).
Second, Eudemonia may be described as living a personally meaningful existence
(Ryan and Deci, 2001). There is some indication that the intrinsic values associated with
eudemonia may include feelings of inner peace, contemplation, vitality and a deep
appreciation of life (Huta and Ryan, 2010; Ryan, Huta, and Deci, 2008). For example, the
emotion awe is associated with feelings of reverence, wonder and aesthetic pleasure and
can be experienced in response to "natural objects that are vast in relation to the self"
(Keltner and Haidt, 2003, p. 310) such as oceans, trees and mountains. Moreover, the
experiencing of awe is argued to be the result of primordial or "hard-wired pre-cultural sets
of responses that were shaped by evolution" supported by elaborated or culture-specific
norms and meanings (Keltner and Haidt, 2003, p. 306).
Eigner (2001) found that for some people, being in close proximity to the natural
environment produced "an amazing feeling of happiness" and an "inner sort of calm"
(Eigner, 2001, p. 191). Eigner suggests that the well-being associated with direct
engagement with the natural environment may be a qualitatively different, ,,higher quality,
well-being than the more hedonistic type of well-being characterized by the ease and
comfort of modern lifestyles. Whilst there have been attempts at measuring, with various
instruments, some indication of these sorts of experiences with nature (e.g., of a sense of
connectedness), other aspects of peoples experiences (e.g., feeling alive and
contemplative) have apparently not so readily lent themselves to empirical assessment (e.g.,
Mayer and Frantz, 2004).
Negative affective reactions to the natural environment
Of course, not all reactions to the natural environment are entirely positive (e.g.,
Bixler, Carlisle, Hammitt, and Floyd, 1994; Herzog and Kutzli, 2002): biophobia is the
negative and largely innate 'biological preparedness' response to natural stimuli such as
snakes and heights (Orians, 1998; Ulrich 1993). One suggestion is that negative reactions
to the natural environment, specifically in relation to wilderness-type environments, can
involve terror because of the apparent feelings of mortality that such encounters might
engender (Koole and van den Berg, 2005). In particular, it has been argued that the absence
of human influence, such as the lack of buildings and people, within wilderness
environments leads people to be confronted "with their own finitude" (Koole and van den
Berg, 2005, p. 1026) which people may be buffered against while they are located in
Human-natural environment relationships
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 9(3). 2011. -455-
largely synthetic and human-controlled modern (and chiefly western) habitations.
Similarly, overly dense forests with little accessibility may engender feelings of foreboding
(Herzog and Kutzli, 2002; Staats et al, 1997), whilst other environments may be perceived
as not providing adequate safety and sustenance (Orians, 1998).
Ambivalent affective reactions to the natural environment
Beyond the simple dichotomous categories of either positive or negative reactions
to the natural environment, there is the possibility the natural environment may instill both
positive and negative reactions, even simultaneously (cf. Bonnes, Passafaro, and Carrus,
2011). Early western experiences with mountains, for example, have elicited what might be
described as an affective ambivalence: great fear but also heightened positive emotions
(MacFarlane, 2003). In particular, MacFarlane (2003) cites John Denniss 1688 description
of crossing the Italian Alps as "a delightful horrour, a terrible joy" (p. 73). These
sentiments have been echoed by other nature writers in other less precipitous natural
environments: Emerson (1836/1982), for instance, describes his emotions during a night-
time crossing of a common in winter: "I have enjoyed perfect exhilaration. I am glad to the
brink of fear" (p. 38). Some evidence of these types of reactions has recently been found in
empirical research. For example, in one study it emerged that different types of
environmental encounters seemed to elicit ambivalent emotional states involving
combinations of fear, awe, respect, and happiness (van den Berg and ter Heijne, 2005).
Urban and rural living
Some evidence indicates that physical-demographic variables, such as distance of
residence from an outdoor recreation area, have little relationship with peoples sense of the
psychological restoration provided by the natural environment (Hartig, Kaiser, and
Strumse, 2007). The same study also indicated that female participants were more likely
than male participants to perceive the natural environment as more positive (restorative).
Conversely, there is a body of evidence which suggests that rural living, in comparison to
urban living, may engender more positive reactions towards the natural environment
(Berenguer, Corraliza, and Martín, 2005; Hinds and Sparks, 2008). For example, Hinds and
Sparks (2009) found that people from rural childhood locations, compared to those from
urban childhood locations, reported more positive affective wellbeing and stronger
environmental identities. After controlling for a multitude of variables (e.g., physical
health, access to a car, employment, age, gender, marital status, ethnicity, overcrowding,
structural housing problems, and income based socioeconomic status), rural people, in
comparison to urban people, have reported significantly lower rates of depression and
anxiety (Weich, Twigg, and Lewis, 2006). Other research has found that people living in
rural areas, compared to people living in urban areas, exhibit less negative affect (e.g.,
depression, boredom, and loneliness) in their lives and tend to be more satisfied with their
lives (Paúl, Fonseca, Martín, and Amado, 2003). Moreover, some research has indicated
that there may be little effect of selective migration on the physical health differences often
found between rural and urban populations, where rural populations often report fewer
health problems (Verheji, van de Mheen, de Bakker, Groenewegen, and Mackenbach,
1998).

The present study
In addition to the indicators of general positive responses towards the natural
environment, the research reviewed above has also suggested that there are likely to be
different emotional reactions to different types of natural environment. Using the
psychometric method (e.g., Slovic, Fischhoff, and Lichtenstein, 1980) several studies have
sought to illustrate diagrammatically the general structural relationship among all
combinations of two sets of variables (Böhm, 2003; McDaniels, Axelrod, and Slovic, 1996;
White and Dolan, 2009) The present study is a unique application of the psychometric
approach concerned with examining the relationship between (a) different types of natural
environments and (b) a broad range of positive and negative affect-based experiential
states. We were also interested in how experiential states associated with natural
environments may be associated with frequency of experience of the natural environment
and childhood location.
Specifically, we (i) sought to explore the structure of peoples experience of
different types of natural environments, (ii) expected that participants from rural childhood
locations, in comparison to participants from urban childhood locations, would report more
positive, and less negative, experiential states associated with being in the natural
environments, and (iii) expected that participants reporting greater experience of the natural
environment, compared to those reporting less experience, would report more positive, and
less negative, experiential states associated with being in the natural environment.
Despite some debate about whether any environment in the present day can be
described as truly natural (e.g., Cronon, 1996; McKibben, 2003), we chose to retain 'natural
environment' and operate a working definition similar to that employed by Abraham et al.s
(2010) study of landscape preference: "a continuum between 'wild' nature and designed
environments such as urban and rural forests, green spaces, parks, gardens, waters, and
neighbourhood areas" (p. 59).
Method
Participants
Participants (N = 90; female = 82; male = 8) were a sample of undergraduate social
science students at the University of Sussex, UK. Their mean age was 21.1 years (SD =
5.23; range 18-41).
Materials
All participants received a questionnaire assessing, among other variables, the
relationship between (i) being in different natural environments and (ii) different
experiential states. All responses were recorded along fully anchored Likert-like scales.
Childhood location. Following questions relating to age and gender, participants
were asked to indicate the type of location in which they grew up: "In what sort of location
did you spend the majority of your childhood?" with three possible responses: Urban (n =
24), Suburban (n = 50), and Rural (n = 15).
Environments and experiential states. Ten environments were derived from a
Human-natural environment relationships

discussion between the authors retaining those likely to be found in the UK (forest,
mountain, garden, beach, valley, woodland, hill, river, farmland field, and park). These
environments were rated in terms of 14 experiential states by asking participants "To what
extent would you expect to feel each of the following" (relaxed, a sense of awe, a sense of
freedom, refreshed, connectedness, isolated, anxious, alive, contemplative, talkative, sense
of fun, empathy, loneliness, and serenity). These experiential feeling states were derived
from previous exploratory research (N = 75) which used the working definition of the
natural environment as ,,any areas and settings produced by nature, such as woodland, hills,
lakes, moorland, valleys, coastal areas, heathland, mountains, rivers and forests.
Participants were asked to "Please list all the words or short phrases that you would
associate personally with being in the natural environment".
Using methods to elicit participant feelings about place that have been utilized
elsewhere (e.g., Hartig, Korpela, Evans and Gärling, 1997), the present study asked
participants to, for example: "Imagine yourself being in a garden environment. To what
extent would you expect to feel each of the following?" (not at all [1] to extremely [7]).
Frequency of experience of the natural environment. Frequency of experience of
each environment was measured by the item: "Please indicate how often you are actually in
each of the following types of environment." Responses were recorded on 5-point scales
ranging from 1 (very often) to 5 (never) and reversed coded for analysis. Frequency of
Experience was computed by mean-averaging the frequency of experience across all ten
environments for each participant. These were then converted by median split procedure
(retaining the median category, viz. ,,2) into a three level grouping variable: Low
experience (n = 40), Median experience (n = 12) and High experience (n = 38).
Procedure
Participants were presented with a questionnaire listing natural environments and
were asked to rate each environment on ten experiential feeling states by imagining being
in each one ­ no visual stimulus was utilized to elicit responses.
Results
Experiential state structure
A principal components analysis (with varimax rotation) of the mean scores of each
combination of experiential state and environment was carried out, producing a two
component solution accounting for 89.35% of the variance (see Table 1). Based on
Stevens (1992) criterion for sample size (N < 100), only component loadings above .512
are included.
The first component (58.75%) was labeled Eudemonia with the following variables
loading heavily: serenity, a sense of awe, contemplation, empathy, alive, a sense of
freedom, connectedness, and refreshed. The second component was labeled Apprehension
(30.60%) with isolated, lonely, and anxious loading heavily and positively and with a sense
of fun, talkative, and relaxed loading heavily and negatively. The means and standard
deviations for each environment for each feeling state are presented in Table 2.
The retained factor scores for each environment from the PCA were then used as
Human-natural environment relationships
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 9(3). 2011. -458-
indices to map each environment relative to each other about the axis of the two-factor
solution, namely Eudemonia and Apprehension. The two component space (see Figure 1)
shows, for example, that mountain, forest, woodland, and valley are located relatively
highly on the Eudemonia component as well as being relatively high on the Apprehension
component; beach and river are located relatively high on the Eudemonia component and
relatively low on the Apprehension component; hill and farmland field are located
relatively low on the Eudemonia component and relatively high on the Apprehension
component; garden and park score low on the Eudemonia component and relatively low on
the Apprehension component. This analysis provides an overall picture of the relationship
between different environments and different experiential states at an aggregated level. We
were also interested however, in more fine-grained analyses of the experiential states
associated with individual environments.

scale and environment positioning were determined by PCA factor scores.
Effects of environmental exposure on experiential states
Eudemonia ( = .97) was computed by taking the means of the scores of the
experiential states that loaded heavily on that component (viz. serenity, a sense of awe,
contemplation, empathy, alive, a sense of freedom, connectedness, and refreshed) for all the
environments. Likewise, a measure of Apprehension ( = .91) was computed by taking the
means of the scores of the experiential states that loaded heavily on that component (viz.
isolated, lonely, anxious, a sense of fun [reverse coded], talkative [reverse coded], and
relaxed [reverse coded] scores) for all the environments.

To investigate the effect of childhood location and experience of the natural
environment on experiential states, a 3 (Childhood Location: urban vs. suburban vs. rural) x
3 (Frequency of Experience: low vs. medium vs. high) MANOVA of both Eudemonia and
Apprehension was carried out using Roys largest root (largest) as the determining P value.
Both Levenes test of equality of error variance (Eudemonia, F(7,81) = 1.29, p = .27);
Apprehension, F(7,81) = 1.44, p = .20) and Boxs test of equality of covariance (M = 16.98,
p = .65) were non-significant and assumptions of normality were thereby satisfied.
Multivariate analyses revealed a significant main effect of Frequency of
Experience, largest = .15, F(2,81) = 6.17, p = .003, ² = .13, and of Childhood Location,
largest = .11, F(2,81) = 4.35, p = .016, ² = .10.
Univariate analyses revealed that for Frequency of Experience there was a
significant effect on Eudemonia F(2,81) = 5.51, p = .006, ² = .12, and a marginally
significant effect on Apprehension F(2,81) = 2.98, p = .056, ² = .07. For Childhood
Location there was a significant effect on Apprehension F(2,81) = 3.82, p = .026, ² = .09,
but not on Eudemonia F(2,81) = 0.34, p = .72, ² = .01. There were no interaction effects
between Frequency of Experience and Childhood Location for either Eudemonia F(3,81) =
0.20, p = .90, ² = .01, or Apprehension F(3,81) = 1.15, p = .33, ² = .04.

All contrast means and standard deviations are presented in Table 3. Participants
reporting High frequency of experience reported greater Eudemonia than did participants
reporting Low frequency of experience (p = .001; 95% CI -1.90 ­ -0.27). In addition,
participants reporting High frequency of experience compared to participants reporting
Low frequency of experience were more likely to report less Apprehension (p = .017; 95%
CI 0.06 ­ 0.57). Rural childhood participants compared to urban childhood participants
tended to report lower Apprehension (p = .014; 95% CI 0.90 ­ 0.79).
Discussion
Our psychometric analysis of experiential states associated with various natural
environments revealed an interesting pattern of relationships. Notable was the tendency for
the more natural or wild environments, such as forests and mountains, to be associated with
higher levels of Eudemonia than were the less natural environments, such as farmland field
and parks. Moreover, some of the more natural environments also seemed to engender
feelings of isolation and loneliness, such that mountains, forests and woodland elicited high
scores not only on Eudemonia but also on Apprehension. The pattern of results described
here is consonant with the idea of ambivalent attitudes to the natural environment found
empirically (e.g., van den Berg and ter Heijne, 2005) and those mentioned anecdotally
(e.g., MacFarlane, 2003).
However, one relationship that may challenge this interpretation of ambivalence is
that between Eudemonia and the items lonely, isolated and anxious. Although these three
items loaded strongly on what we have called the Apprehension component, they also
Human-natural environment relationships
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 9(3). 2011. -463-
loaded positively on the Eudemonia component. In other words, one possible interpretation
of this finding could be that being lonely, isolated and anxious in some environments is
experienced positively (cf. Grahn and Stigsdotter, 2010).
Garden, park, beach and river environments were more likely to elicit reported
feelings of fun, relaxation and talkativeness than were other environments. It has been
suggested elsewhere that gardens, parks (Bhatti and Church, 2001; Burgess et al., 1988)
and waterscapes (Ogunseitan, 2005; Tuan, 1974) may be important places for social
interactions and the maintenance of positive affective states (Regan and Horn, 2005). The
affective states associated with such social interactions may also be qualitatively different
from the affect associated with exposure to the natural environment.
The present study found waterscapes, such as river and beach, to be high in terms
of Eudemonia. In other words, waterscapes seemed to elicit a broad array of positive
experiential states (high Eudemonia), high levels of fun, relaxation and talkativeness but
little in the way of negative experiential feeling states (low Apprehension). Therefore, it
may be suggested from the pattern of results that although the more natural environments
tend to elicit more Eudemonia, some are also perceived as more fun (e.g., waterscapes) and
some as more lonely and isolating (e.g., forests and mountains) (see Staats et al., 1997).
These findings have some degree of resonance with an evolutionary perspective of human
appreciation of natural environments (Orians and Heerwagen, 1992; Tuan, 1974).
The expectation that rural participants would report more positive experiential states
in connection with the various natural environments was not supported, although the
pattern of means was in the expected direction. This unanticipated finding may reflect a
widespread positive appreciation of the natural environment (e.g., Hartig et al, 2007;
Newell, 1997). However, participants with a rural childhood location, compared to
participants with an urban childhood location, reported less Apprehension in relation to
being in the environments. Therefore, one hypothesis meriting consideration is that
growing up in a rural childhood location may have a larger role to play in the avoidance of
the feelings of anxiety, loneliness and isolation that urban childhood participants associate
with the natural environment, than it does in accentuating positive experiential states.
It was also found, as expected and in line with previous research (e.g., Hinds and
Sparks, 2009), that participants reporting greater experience of the natural environment,
compared to participants reporting less experience, tended to report greater Eudemonia in
relation to the natural environments. This finding may be seen as reinforcement of the idea
that biophilic, and to some extent biophobic, predispositions may be awakened or enhanced
through experience of the environment (Kahn, 1999; Kellert 2002).
It could be argued quite reasonably that people who enjoy the natural environment
more are likely to be motivated to engage with it more frequently. It may also be the case
that people who have greater experience of the natural environment tend to experience
more positive experiential states, although there may be other additional explanations for
this. For instance, certain personality types may be more inclined both towards greater
frequency of experience of the natural environment and to experiencing (and / or reporting)
certain affective experiential states. Undoubtedly, these possibilities may interact to shape
peoples behavior and affective responses. However, given the evidence from previous
experimental research that positive responses towards the natural environment may be
Human-natural environment relationships
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 9(3). 2011. -464-
elicited through simple exposure (e.g., Korpela et al., 2002; van den Berg et al., 2003), the
present studys findings are at least congruent with the idea that greater experience of
natural environments can stand as a causal antecedent of more positive experiential states.
Having said this, the present findings would benefit from further substantiation
from future research employing methods to examine actual natural environmental
encounters. Such research could, for example, quantify and describe the duration and
nature of those experiences. This would obviate the reliance (evident in the present study)
on participants subjective accounts of their frequency of experience of the natural
environment. In a similar vein, participants could be asked to provide examples of the
environments they respond to in order to determine if there is some degree of consensus of
their subjective understandings of those environments.
It must also be acknowledged here that the sample used for the present research was
disproportionately female which may have biased results towards positive responses
towards the natural environment (cf. Hartig et al., 2007). Moreover, the sample was
relatively small and homogenous, thus inhibiting the generalizability of the findings to
broader populations. Additionally, there may be problems with identifying exactly what
constitutes urban or rural categories (e.g., Weich et al., 2006). Urban and rural groups may
also differ on how they perceive different environments (Berenguer et al., 2005). Therefore,
despite the present study finding support for similar research using this particular method
of collecting rural / urban data (e.g., Hinds and Sparks, 2008), these differences should be
treated tentatively, awaiting further research employing more objective methods to elicit
rural and urban classifications.
In summary, the present findings suggest that there may be a diverse pattern of
experiential states associated with different natural environments. However, what is also
apparent is the significant role that Eudemonia plays in reactions to the majority of those
environments. Although previous research has identified the importance of affective factors
in evaluations of the natural environment (Korpela, et al., 2002), the present research has
been able to show how some environments (e.g., mountains) may be associated with
particular experiential states (e.g., indicating Eudemonia), and others (e.g., parks) seem to
elicit other positive experiential states (e.g., fun and relaxation). Additionally, the role of
Apprehension seems to be more strongly associated with the more natural environments
such as mountains, and negligibly associated with both (some) waterscapes and other, less
natural, environments such as parks.
Given the increasing need for a more engaged, pro-environmental, population, the
findings presented here highlight the potential of experience of the natural environment for
effecting more positive affective reactions towards the natural environment. Additionally,
there is the suggestion that early experience of the natural environment, measured here as
childhood location, may be conducive to the avoidance of negative experiential states
associated with those environments.
The present study provides a novel perspective on the relationship between
affective experiences and the natural environment. In particular, it is the quality of positive
affect associated with eudemonic well-being that represents a rather novel insight into that
relationship. Certainly, the quantitative investigation of eudemonic well-being and its
association with natural environment experiences has received little published research
Human-natural environment relationships
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 9(3). 2011. -465-
attention to date. Our research also shows that different environments elicit different
affective responses, thereby adding to the broader body of knowledge regarding human
relationships with specific natural environments. Finally, the work described here lends
support to the growing body of evidence pointing to the importance of direct experience of
the natural environment as a contributor to psychological well-being.
