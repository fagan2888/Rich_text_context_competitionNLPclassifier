Stories From ADF families
Family 1
He (Sam, 3 years) didn't understand the difference between
deployment and going to work, which created huge meltdowns
when Caleb was home after deployment and then said he was
going to "work."
Family 2
You are not really in or out after they die. I find it hard to connect
with other defence families at Army unit days.
Family 3
He was also really upset by some of the parenting decisions I
had made in his absence. It was hard having those very honest
conversations where he was saying he thought those decisions
were wrong.
Introduction
As it is clear from these stories, in addition to fears for the
safety of deployed parents, military families deal with the
ongoing stress associated with prolonged absence of one
family member. This stress places other individual family
members, as well as the whole family unit, at risk and con-
tributes to higher levels of workplace attrition (Pincombe &
Pincombe, 2010). Risk factors are experiences and issues
that place strain on the well-being of the family unit, and thus
the children. In particular, Pincombe and Pincombe (2010)
noted that families who are apart are likely to grow further
apart the longer the separation. Despite this, there are a sig-
nificant number of families who find ways to cope with this
kind of stress (McGuire et al., 2012).
Research about Australian military families is very lim-
ited and urgently needed (McFarlane, 2009; Siebler, 2009).
Globally, research about the influence of protective factors
within these families is scarce, hence, limiting defense forces
and others who assist the families to effectively strengthen,
target, and resource their support. Protective factors in

Protective Factors in Families: Themes
From a Socioecological Study of
Australian Defence Force Families
Experiencing Parental Deployment
Marg Rogers-Baber1
Abstract
Families sometimes face prolonged and frequent absences of a parent due to employment in industries that require work
away or for military deployment. Many families, however, are finding ways to survive and thrive. Within Australian Defence
Force (ADF) families, despite the high stress and inherent danger, most do cope, displaying strength and resilience. Limited
research has been conducted with Australian military families with young children, even less focusing on protective factors.
There is particularly a dearth of research about families who have left the ADF or who have experienced the death of an
ADF parent. This study offers unique insights through exploring family experiences of parental deployment by applying
a socioconstructivist approach from data derived through narrative research. Protective factors were identified through
relationships, the ADF, social media, community organizations, government departments, and digital communication
technologies. Understanding how these families manage and the protective factors they utilize may enable early childhood
educators and family support services to better understand family resilience, and thus provide appropriate services for
military families with young children.

families act as a buffer in times of stress and change (Cologon
& Hayden, 2012), and protect their "well-being, outcomes
and mental health" (Wilson, 2016, p. 13). Protective factors
are "experiences that can help the development of positive
social and emotional skills, essential for good mental health"
(Australian Government & Beyondblue, 2014). Within mili-
tary families, despite the stresses of deployment, most fami-
lies seem to manage short-term separations that are less than
6 months (Flake, Davis, Johnson, & Middleton, 2009), and
show strengths and resiliency (Jensen-Hart, Christensen,
Dutka, & Leishman, 2012; Sheppard, Malatras, & Israel,
2010). To date, much research has been focused on under-
standing the impacts of deployment on families and children,
but little is understood about the protective factors that oper-
ate to support families throughout the deployment cycle
(Lincoln, Swift, & Shorteno-Fraser, 2008; Palmer, 2008).
Knowledge about family stressors helps direct policy makers
to work toward reducing stresses within the workplace and
the broader community, and may contribute to raising the
awareness of professionals who collaborate with families.
This study uses the socioecological model, created by
Bronfenbrenner (1986), to explain both the origins and effects
of the stresses military families face and the protective factors
that buffer them during difficult times. The model is made up of
concentric circles and places the child at the individual level at
the center. The next layer of the model is the microsystem, made
up of those people the child has direct contact with. This typi-
cally includes immediate family members, peers, health work-
ers, and educators. The levels of congruence within the
microsystem are termed the mesosystem (Grace, Hayes, &
Wise, 2016). The next layer consists of those people the child
normally does not have regular contact with and is called the
exosystem. This may include parent's workplaces, community
services, government policies, media, family friends, and
extended family that live away. The macrosystem surrounds the
exosystem and is made up of the culture, ideologies, economy,
and global issues. Finally, within the model, the chronosystem is
the changes that occur over time for the individual child due to
developmental changes or changes in circumstances. This
model takes into account the changeable physical, social, and
psychological environment in which they live (Grace et al.,
2016). In such a view, children are impacted by their environ-
ment but also impact upon their environment. The following
sections outline the relevant literature that underpins the study.
Characteristics of Healthy Family
Functioning
Healthy family functioning is about families spending time
together, building and maintaining intimate relationships.
These intimate relationships involve supporting, sharing, and
caring for each other within the family unit, and it includes
couples, children, other kin, and family friends (Poole, 2011).
According to Sims (2002), strong families are flexible and
view change positively, work together to cope, can identify
when outside assistance is needed and connect with extended
family, friends, community, and their culture. Shimoni and
Baxter (2008) believed that strong families effectively com-
municate, value one other, have a shared belief, and balance
their needs. In addition, they support others in times of need
and try to reconcile differences (Sims, 2002). The ability to
maintain levels of intimacy and family strength is challenged
when a family member is absent for significant periods of
time, such as when a parent is away for work. Currently, this
occurs among families who experience long absences of at
least one parent due to military deployment or employment
on oilrigs. Other families may experience frequent parental
absences for military training, transport industry require-
ments, and Fly-In-Fly-Out (FIFO) and Drive-In-Drive-Out
(DIDO) mining rosters. These frequent absences can be just
as difficult as prolonged absences, as Hubinger, Parker, and
Calavarino (2002) explained the frequent separations and
reintegrations are emotionally draining.
Protective Factors in Military Families
Although the study of protective factors within military fam-
ilies is limited, and much more is needed, this section out-
lines some of the findings within the literature. For
nondeployed spouses, Spera (2009) found that military "unit
relationship quality, leadership effectiveness, and tangible
social support from community members" were the most
important protective factors to well-being (p. 286). For
returned personnel, Rentz et al. (2007) outlined that protec-
tive factors such as disciplinary measures particular to the
military may help decrease the prevalence of family violence
and addictions, but unfortunately these measures may
increase the likelihood of nondisclosure due to stigma and
fear of curtailed career progression. For children experienc-
ing difficulties during deployment, Saltzman et al. (2011)
explained that nurturing and adaptive parenting are the most
important protective factors. For families, Andres and
Coulthard (2015), in a cross-country comparison, found that
effective communication was a protective factor. In the
Australian Timor-Leste study, identified protective factors
included parental and child well-being, relationship quality,
access to care, social support, and the family's ability to
function during times of increased stress (McGuire et al.,
2012). Importantly, the Timor-Leste study did not explore
the role of other protective factors addressed in this article:
relationships with educators support through social media,
relationship quality through digital communication technol-
ogy, effective parenting, and economic security.
Stresses and Risk Factors Caused by
Work-Related Parental Absences and
Deployment
Deployment itself causes ongoing stress for the deployed
parent, even after they are back at home. Deployment for
Rogers-Baber 3
combat, peacekeeping, and border protection can result in a
combat stress response (CSR; Pincombe & Pincombe, 2010),
moral injury (Sherman, 2010), or mental health issues,
including depression, addictions, posttraumatic stress disor-
der (PTSD), and violence. Compounding this issue is a
strong acculturation process that positions seeking help as a
route to potential dismissal and the impact disclosure could
have on their career progression (Crompvoets, 2012).
Stressors unique to shorter or lengthy parental absences and
stressors that are common across all parental absences are
summarized in Table 1.
Palmer (2008) and Pincus, House, Christenson, and Adler
(2007) outlined the reasons military families are at risk, both
as a family unit and as individuals due to the ongoing stresses
they experience. For families, poor access to communication
was found to be a risk factor by Andres and Coulthard (2015)
in a cross-country comparison. For children, some risk fac-
tors are associated with the nondeployed parent's reduced
ability to manage effectively due to the stress of parenting
alone.
Strengths-Based Approach
Strengths-based approaches are more commonly accepted as
the best way to assist families, but conversely Wilson (2016)
reported that the evidence to confirm this approach is only just
emerging. Concentrating on the negative is a legacy of the
medical model that adheres to a deficit model of human behav-
ior (Graybeal, 2001). It is an approach many professionals
cling to because of their conventional instruction in this
approach (Sims, 2002) and one that infiltrates policy makers.
Strengths-based practice is grounded in the concept that
strong families not only cope but also flourish despite the
stressors they face. Bowes and Warburton (2012) described
family strengths that arise from the way families communi-
cate, problem solve, make decisions, interact and sustain
relationships. The operation of these strengths changes over
time as families respond to stress inside and outside the fam-
ily (Bowes & Warburton, 2012). A more comprehensive list
of the characteristics of strong families that has been adapted
from Sims (2002) is provided in Table 2.

Contemporary early childhood education, social work,
and community work focuses on working with families from
a strengths-based approach as described by Guo and Tsui
(2010) and Sims (2002). This approach requires profession-
als to understand the protective factors that can empower
families to thrive even when they are experiencing chal-
lenges (Anuradha, 2004) or are at risk. It is important to note
that risk and protective factors are not static within families
and individuals (Allison et al., 2003; Hawley, 2000).
Furthermore, Sims (2002) identified a number of protective
factors within the various levels of the ecological family sys-
tem, as outlined by Bronfenbrenner (1986), starting from
individual characteristics and moving through the various
layers where government decisions and policies within the
macrosystem impact on the family and child.
Once these strengths and resources have been identified,
professionals can work with families on utilizing the
resources to improve the current issues or situation
(Anuradha, 2004). As Itzhaky and Bustin (2002) stated, this
process empowers individuals and families. It helps children
to utilize support factors within the community and family
(Allison et al., 2003), thus building resilience through the
provision of services. For early childhood educators, the
strengths-based model aligns with Vygotsky's notion of
the Zone of Proximal Development (Vygotsky & Cole, 1978)
because it begins with what children are familiar with and
what they can already manage (Sims, 2011). This complex
process involves empowering the parents and children as
they acquire and demonstrate the language skills and prac-
tices effective in the context in which they are operating. In
the strengths-based approach, it is hoped that eventually
these acquired skills become established behaviors within
the family.
Protective Factors
The study here concentrates on the protective factors that
enable families with young children attending early child-
hood services to manage and thrive under difficult circum-
stances. The wide variety of these factors may be useful for
professionals and policy makers who work with these fami-
lies by revealing a broad picture of families' capacities and
limitations. Concentrating on families with young children
emphasizes the importance of the early years. Internationally,
research corroborates easier access to quality education and
care in the early years that is acknowledged by the Australian
Government's programs and policies (Arthur, Beecher,
Death, Dockett, & Farmer, 2015).
Closer examination of the protective factors is useful
because it enables support services and professionals, includ-
ing early childhood educators, to understand and explore
family strengths, and thus provide appropriate resources.
Importantly, engaging effectively with potentially vulnerable
families and children in early childhood settings is vital
before crisis intervention is necessary and negative behav-
iors have become entrenched (Bowes, Hayes, Cashmore, &
Hodge, 2012). In early childhood settings, parents are more
likely to actively engage in authentic partnerships with edu-
cators and associated professionals; and, through the build-
ing of relationships and trust, information exchange and
provisions can be targeted where there is apparent need
(Wilson, 2016). While globally there has been "an increased
recognition of the importance of the early years" (Arthur,
Beecher, Death, Dockett, & Farmer, 2012, p. 2) due to fund-
ing shortages within Australia, early intervention programs
often focus on the families who are either in crisis or have the
highest need (Bowes, Hayes, et al., 2012). This lack of fund-
ing to preventive programs transfers the responsibility to
parents, early childhood educators, and family workers to
source the information and provision needed to effectively
assist children who are living under stressful circumstances,
such as the absence of a parent due to work.
This study focuses on the protective factors identified
within three families with young children who experienced
prolonged parental deployments and frequent, short-term
parent training periods away from home during Australian
Defence Force (ADF) service. The data allow us to examine
their experiences and importantly give us rare insight into a
family who had left the ADF and another who has experi-
enced a death of a parent.

In this study, a narrative methodology was employed that

and social contexts (Pinnegar & Daynes, 2007), solicited
through research (Polkinghorne, 2007). While narrative
research is considered a contemporary approach, Clandinin
and Rosiek (2007) argued that we have discussed the stories
we tell for about as long as we have been telling them.
Gottschall (2012) believed that humans have been telling
stories since they have been on earth, and this ability is what
sets humans apart as a species. Narrative methodologies
have become increasingly popular in the fields of social sci-
ence bringing with them higher levels of analysis and dis-
course around stories and their importance in our lives
(Clandinin & Rosiek, 2007). This study examines the stories
participants share about their experiences of deployment and
their interpretations of these stories.
Participants
The participants were engaged through convenience sam-
pling of three families. The families were invited to partici-
pate due to their involvement in a storybook project about
defense families as part of a larger, unpublished doctoral
studytitled"YoungChildren'sExperienceandUnderstanding
of Deployment Within an ADF Family." The unique data
from these three families, including five children, were sepa-
rated into a subset, as summarized in Table 3. The three fami-
lies represent two different Australian states and were from
three different military bases.
Caleb, from Family 1, had left the defense force during the
period of data collection. In Family 2, Nathan had come home
on leave briefly after the birth of Michael; however, he was
killed in action very soon after he returned to active service.
In Family 3, Seb was undergoing extensive training (away
from home) to prepare him for further deployments. Table 3
lists the ages of the children at initial contact with the family,
although the data were collected using various methods over
a 3-year time frame. Small-scale studies such as this often
face issues of identity protection of participants. Newman and
Pollnitz (2005) discussed the importance of maintaining self-
sufficiency, and managing personal information and identity.
For this reason, the data have been scrambled between fami-
lies, pseudonyms were used, and some of their details were
changed.
To understand the context of the participants, it is impor-
tant to have a degree of knowledge concerning the ADF as an
employer. As one of the biggest employers in Australia, the
ADF has more than 80,000 permanent and reserve personnel
(Australian Bureau of Statistics, 2012) working across the
Navy, Airforce, and Army. Most of these employees are at an
age at which they have a young family or are starting to have
children. The ADF (2013) described deployment as normally
lasting 3 to 9 months, and may involve peacekeeping, strate-
gic, or combat operations. Redeployment rates are as high as
33% of all personnel who stay with the ADF. Attrition rates
are of concern for the ADF (Department of Defence, 2010)
due to the loss of skills and the high cost of training and
recruitment.
Data Collection and Analysis
Data were collected over a period of 3 years via face-to-face
interviews, emails, and phone conversations with families
utilizing the mode of contact that suited families and the
researcher at the time. Contact with the families for inter-
views and conversations occurred 4 to 6 times during this
period. The interviews were semistructured, and questions
centered on themes about their experiences of deployment as
parents, coparents and as a couple. I also explored their per-
ceptions of the children's experiences and understandings
and the protective factors they utilized. Member checking
occurred by presenting the parents with various data outputs
for validation. To increase researcher integrity and reflexiv-
ity, I maintained a reflective journal during the process, and
discussed the findings and themes with other academics and
research supervisors to monitor any inherent bias. The par-
ents were positioned as knowledgeable source of informa-
tion about their children. In narrative data collection, thick,
rich descriptions of the contexts, environment, participators'
emotions, and nuances are necessary to enable the researcher

to look for transferrable data through shared characteristics
(Moen, 2006). Once this awareness was constructed, analy-
sis of the data was undertaken.
Data were analyzed using a thematic approach and appli-
cation of Bronfenbrenner's (1986) socioecological frame-
work to understand the way families created meaning in their
lives. The steps in narrative analysis included first an immer-
sion in the data. Second, a narrative retelling of the data was
created from all sources of data for each family while keep-
ing in mind the adult's role and authority in the children's
lives. Third, these family narratives were developed from
themes within the framework, emerging from the data by
inductive analysis. Fourth, the data were inspected again,
moving from description to an interpretation of participants'
accounts within the research themes (Willis, 2013). Narrative
analysis is a useful method in this research field because it
brings out the hidden voice (Spector-Mersel, 2010) and
emphasizes that there is not one truth or interpretation. As
Reissman (2005) explained, narrative analysis can create
links between stories and social and political organization.
The next section explores the themes identified within the
data.
Overview of Protective Factors
Employing Bronfenbrenner's Model as
a Framework for Analysis
A major theme that emerged from the data was the importance
of protective factors in the young children's life and their fam-
ily. These factors encompassed relationships, the ADF, com-
munity provisions, and communication and technology. These
themes reflect the concept of resilience by focusing on positive
outcomes and utilizing a strengths-based approach as described
by Cologon and Hayden (2012). When examining resilience,
the relationship between protective factors, susceptibilities, and
liabilities is highlighted (Cologon & Hayden, 2012). The qual-
ity of the protective factors within the layers of the socioeco-
logical family system will often affect the families' ability to
survive the deployment cycle. Being a member of the defense
community builds resilience because of the protective factors it
provides (Baber, Fussell, & Porter, 2015). In this study, the nar-
rative data reveal varying protective factors within the case
study families across the four levels of Bronfenbrenner's
(1986) model shown in Figure 1.
Themes From the Data
In the next section, each identified protective factor is exam-
ined in turn with reference to the layers within the socioeco-
logical model. The identified protective factors are
summarized in Figure 2.
Protective Factors Provided by Relationships
(Microsystem)
The protective factors provided by relationships with sib-
lings, parents, family friends, extended family, educators,
and teachers are explored in the next three sections.
Sibling relationships
Family 3
The kids fought at times over time on the phone with Seb.
Davina would stay on the phone for a long time just listening to
Daddy's voice and trying to talk and Brian would get very cross
when he had to wait.
Rogers-Baber 7
Typical of sibling relationships, Brian and Davina in Family
3 exhibited some competition for parental attention, as evi-
denced by the verbal and physical altercations over phone
calls with their deployed father. Conversely, Fiona from
Family 1, as a positive response, identified sibling assistance,
role flexibility, and emotional support:
Family 1
Sam was also helpful at home, he would bring me toys and give
me cuddles, bring me the tissue box if I was crying and help with
the bins, gardening and feeding the dogs. He would also help me
to get Jess ready sometimes if we were going out.
Parenting relationships
Family 1
I had some photo books made with photos of Caleb and the kids.
We also video-recorded Caleb reading to the children that they
loved to watch. We made up a special calendar so Sam could
mark the days he was away with stickers. He didn't understand
the difference between deployment and going to work, which
created huge meltdowns when Caleb was home after deployment
and then said he was going to "work."
Family 3
We were all having trouble sleeping and Brian was having
nightmares. It just saved the fights at the time and was much
easier on everyone. I think I just had to get through it at the time
by doing things my way.
In Family 3, Brenda displayed responsive and supportive
parenting by adjusting to the children's physical and emo-
tional responses and allowing them into her bed, and by pro-
viding support to help Sam understand the concepts of
deployment. In Family 1, as shown below, both Caleb and
Fiona showed role flexibility during the initial time of reinte-
gration. In addition, Caleb and Fiona revealed parenting
strengths and emotional support for their children by revisit-
ing unresolved issues the children had. They were surprised
the children's emotional issues were still evident a year after
Caleb had left the ADF:
Family 1
After Afghanistan Caleb decided to take a step back for the
re-integration period. This meant I took care of them and all
discipline was handled by me for the first couple of weeks.
I was surprised to see how upset Sam got since Caleb hasn't
been away for a large stint since last year. It has shown me how
much they have held onto the emotions they used to feel when
he was away and how raw it obviously still is for them. It was a
good chance for Caleb to have a good chat to them about the
whole thing.
Coparenting relationships
Family 1 Caleb
We had never planned as a family that I would be there forever.
In the end it came down to more time away for promotion and I
was away all of 2012, came home in February for 6 weeks, then
home for 2 weeks then away for 3-4 months again. The main
reason I left was just lifestyle. It was the right decision for our
family to leave.
Family 1 Fiona
When Jess turned 3 we realized Caleb had only been there 1 year
of her life. All the time away was the big issue for us. Caleb had
missed the first soccer games and other big events in the
children's lives. Getting used to Caleb being home full-time
took a while for the children. Sam acted out at him being home
all the time and would avoid him and Jess did not want to speak
to him in the mornings. She would completely ignore him at
other times. I told Caleb the kids were "punishing him" for
having been away for so long. Since leaving things are much
easier for us all. We can plan events and know we will all be
there, including the holidays. The uncertainty is gone. The
children are more settled. It's great knowing the time you have
will be yours as a family.
These data reveal Family 1's ability to make career decisions
in the interest of family cohesion, showing flexibility with
goals and arrangements. It displays the family's ability to
move on positively despite lingering issues from the past,
such as the children's behaviors. It shows their ability to
focus on the improvements such changes have brought to the
family as a whole, regardless of the drawbacks of financial
and career sacrifices. In the example below, Brenda from
Family 3 exhibited determination to spend time together as a
family unit, despite her husband's protests. It demonstrates
Seb's struggles with reintegration as a parent when decisions

have been made he disagrees with and children have devel-
oped new skills and matured in his absence. The vignette
demonstrates Brenda's empathetic response, by avoiding
blame for the difficulties that arose during reintegration:
Family 3
I made him come away on a family holiday soon after he came
back. He didn't want to, but it made a big difference to reconnect.
It is hard as the kids were up to different stages so he was often
babying them and they didn't want to be babied. Nine months is
a long time in a young child's life and they changed a lot. He was
also really upset by some of the parenting decisions I had made
inhisabsence.Itwashardhavingthoseveryhonestconversations
where he was saying he thought those decisions were wrong. I
made them to cope during that tough time. Issues like the kids
coming and sleeping in our bed.
He was really tired (during reintegration) and tried sleeping
during the day to catch up. The kids just made really loud noises
suddenly and he would be angry at being woken up. I kept
saying: "They are just young kids, Seb." He said it is hard
because when you are on base you are with adults for 9 months,
but adults who are good at following orders. When he came
home, he was dealing with a toddler and a preschooler.
Spousal relationships (individual)
Family 1
Before he deployed there was a family information session
defence put on where they said not to bother your partner with
things that can be solved by yourself or with support at home.
They also said to avoid telling them things that might play on their
mind and affect them on duty. That made it really hard. Jess was
really sick and we were in and out of hospital and medical visits
and testing a lot for many months and I couldn't mention it except
to downplay the seriousness of it. Caleb's Aunt also got really ill
and I couldn't mention that either. It was weird when he came
back as we had lots of conversations where I had to explain to him
what really happened. That was hard as he felt he was lied to.
Family 3
I was not told to hold back any information from Seb, but I felt
guilty if I told him how bad things were at home and how hard
I was finding it. There was a period of about 2 months when
the children were continually sick between the two of them
and I was really struggling with very little sleep. After it was
over, I told him. Then he was really upset I had held that back
from him and he felt really guilty I had gone through that by
myself.
In this study, two families spoke of the issues around protect-
ing each other from what was happening at home. One fam-
ily was told by theADF to keep stressful issues to themselves
to avoid distracting the deployed parent. The other nonde-
ployed parent just kept quiet about her struggles without
being instructed by defense personnel to do so. Both
nondeployed parents spoke of the later difficulties this
caused in their communication when the deployed parent
eventually realized the truth. Similarly, the deployed parents
did not share detailed matters of defense with their spouses
to avoid burdening them with what they were witnessing and
experiencing and for security reasons.
At the individual level of Bronfenbrenner's (1986) model,
parents choose to filter the information given to the other
spouse, and the nondeployed parent often controls what the
children communicate to soften the news. Brooks (2011)
stressed the importance of establishing boundaries about
what is shared in communication. Minute details may be
overwhelming for deployed parents, and they may become
distracted through worrying about how to solve issues at
home when they are away (Brooks, 2011). Conversely,
Tomforde (2015) explained one coping strategy of the
spouses of German deployed military personnel that involved
writing everything down, including all the emotions they
were experiencing in letters or diaries. Carefully chosen
excerpts of the diaries were sent to the deployed spouse dur-
ing deployment or left at home for them to read when they
returned. In their U.S.-based research, Andres, De Angelis,
and McCone (2015) discovered that deployed spouses gener-
ally protected their spouse by keeping military operations to
themselves. Family members at home may become anxious
if the deployed parent shares too much about their operations
or surrounds (Brooks, 2011). In line with these family's
experiences, stress can be caused by unhealthy family com-
munication patterns which include both ignoring other fam-
ily members and sharing too much information (Dekel,
Wadsworth, & Sanchez, 2015).
Family friends and extended family relationships
Family 1
My parents were great during both deployments, but especially
the first because I moved in with them. There was another
mother whose husband was a FIFO worker (Fly in Fly Out
miner). I don't think I would have survived without her.
Family 2
We were living in Army accommodation and then he found out
he was to be deployed. They offered me the option of relocating
to be with my family as we were both away from family at the
base.
Family 3
Before he left, we moved to the coast to be near my Mum and
Dad so I could have that support when he deployed. We had
lots of sleepovers with them and they would look after me. It's
nice going home and someone caring about me. The kids also
just go there and I have a break sometimes. Working part time,
having the kids and coping by yourself is hard, so they are a
big help.
Rogers-Baber 9
The narrative data demonstrated that nondeployed parents
found assistance during their first deployment experience
from their own parents. The ADF offered families the oppor-
tunity to relocate to be near other family members during
deployment, and families were grateful for the ADF's facili-
tating role. The extended family provided both physical and
emotional support. Some of the nondeployed parents viewed
this support as offering opportunities to catch up on rest,
helping them cope with the demands of parenting alone, and
alleviating their feelings of being stretched. Relocation
closer to extended family also provided opportunities for
parents to access child minding that enabled them to social-
ize, thus reducing their feelings of isolation. The parents
often cited benefits, including special time for the children
with their grandparents and other extended family.
Interestingly, following the death of a parent, the ADF sever-
ing these supports was taken personally during such an emo-
tional time, as shown in the excerpt below:
Family 2
I took up the offer (of relocating to her parent's house) and most
of our belongings were packed up and left in a Commonwealth
Storage Facility for when Nathan returned. Six months after the
funeral they moved our belongings down to my mother's house
because they could no longer be in a Commonwealth Storage
Facility. I was no longer considered a defence family. That was
a rude shock. You are not really in or out after they die.
In Family 1, Fiona's narrative data identified that she found the
second deployment, when she had two young children, more
difficult than the first when she had only one child. She and her
children did not relocate to be near her own parents during the
second deployment and when both children were very sick for
an extended period, her narrative outlined how difficult and
stressful she found this experience. Given the absence of fam-
ily close by, both Fiona and Caleb reported how they found the
physical and emotional encouragement given by a family
friend as critical to their coping. The friend, who was in a simi-
lar situation because her husband worked away as a FIFO
worker at a mine site, was more easily able to empathize and
respond appropriately. Fiona was not living on a military base
at the time, reducing the amount of available support.
Educators and teacher relationships
Family 2
The Early Childhood teacher was great and helped me access
funding for a specialist for Michael due to his hyperactivity. His
school teacher is not very helpful getting a letter organized to help
with funding now that he has been diagnosed with ADHD and
Asperger's. The school counsellor has had a chat to Michael too.
In Family 2, Wendy emphasized the importance of a support-
ive early childhood educator who was able to help source
defense funding for her son Michael's additional learning
needs. Subsequently, Wendy had more difficulty building
this type of relationship with Michael's first primary school-
teacher, and this affected the provision of additional school
assistance. She believed that Michael's education suffered
because of the difference of opinion about the need to access
funding to support his learning difficulties. In the excerpt
below, Fiona from Family 1 stressed the importance of the
provision and knowledge of Sam's early childhood educator
who was able to suggest effective strategies to assist family
communication. Sam initially reacted with joy for the first
few days when his father returned from deployment or
lengthy training episodes. This subsequently changed to
ongoing displays of anger and refusals to speak to his father
or be physically near him for a number of weeks, affecting
the father's anxiousness about reintegration each time.
Interestingly, Caleb attributed the eventual improvement to
Sam's increasing maturity:
Family 1 Fiona
Sam's preschool teacher was amazing and had child psychology
training. She was very helpful with Sam's phases and behavior
and encouraged us to have conversations with Sam when he was
acting out before the deployment. She told us Sam might have
been behaving like that because of the things he may have
overheard about deployment. We took her advice and put a map
of the world in Sam's room with a star where we lived and one
where Caleb was going to Afghanistan. Once we explained it, all
the behaviour stopped immediately.
Family 1 Caleb
After East Timor and then during the extra time away, Sam had
a rebellion against me I suppose you would say. This improved
with age. There was some nervousness about coming home and
trying to fit back in with the children, especially after Sam's
episodes of not wanting to have anything to do with me.
Protective Factors Within the Exosystem and
Macrosystem
ADF support
Family 1 Fiona
The Padre was really good and the social worker was helpful.
There was also a head person to email if anything was needed
and he was really excellent. The welfare people called a few
times and I totally panicked of course. Those calls were really
reassuring though, after I calmed down. It was great to know
that they were checking up that we were OK. For our personal
experience I really don't think there was much more they (the
ADF) could have done for us. We were given a book on dealing
with deployment that was very informative and helpful. They
covered everything from the emotions of deployment to a
checklist of things we should organise before Caleb left. It also
10 SAGE Open
gave tips to deal with the homecoming. I had been given a list of
all the numbers and email addresses of all people we could
contact if I needed help or had any questions. There was a
farewell parade before Caleb left which was turned into a family
day where all families got to meet each other and meet people
like the welfare officer. For us I think they prepared us very well
and I never felt like they were not supportive of us.
Family 1 Caleb
There was one talk we went to one day. It was a seminar and
there were some handouts. The Welfare Officer and Padre were
also available.
Family 1 identified Army Unit days as useful to connect with
other families and ADF support staff. Information shared
verbally and in booklets at predeployment family events was
considered relevant and helpful. Being able to meet support
staff, such as Padres and social workers, for possible later
access was seen as useful. For Family 2, there had been a
change in the chronosystem as Wendy had once enjoyed
these days. Attendance at such events since the death of her
husband on deployment had been difficult as she did not feel
part of the defense culture anymore and found it hard to
relate to families who had not experienced this type of loss,
although her son enjoyed them and gave him an opportunity
of mixing with other fathers. Wendy found the ADF-funded
trip to the overseas base very helpful to give meaning and
closure to her spouse's death:
Family 2
Army days are hard with the hierarchy and feeling like I am not
really part of the defence culture anymore. I find it hard to connect
with other defence families at Army unit days. It is hard to hear
the other wives whining about how tough they have it when their
husbands are on night duty. Michael enjoys them though and
tends to gravitate toward the other Dads. He gets upset when he
sees other Dads at school or at the park. I got a lot of closure when
I was allowed with a small group of other families toAfghanistan.
I got to see Nathan's room, and got some understanding of what
his work was like over there for him at the base.
Organization (exosystem) and government department (macro-
system) support
Family 2
Legacy have been helpful, but mostly are older. They got me a
new computer. The local RSL (Returned Services League)
branch have been a great support. The Defence Trust is also
there to help but I am not entitled to the Commando Trust
because I was given the wrong paper work by the Department of
Veteran Affairs. (DVA)
A number of charity organizations and Australian
Government Departments assist military and veteran
families. The veteran's charity organization, Legacy, had
provided funding to Wendy and her son Michael (Family 2),
and the organization also offered ongoing emotional care.
Other assistance was welcomed from the local branch of the
Returned Services League (RSL). After her spouse's death,
the Department of Veterans Affairs had issued the wrong
form for Wendy's claims, thus limiting her entitlements.
They had, however, funded a number of needed resources
but not to the level she was entitled.
Protective Factors Utilizing Communication and
Technology
Both positive and negative communication and technology
issues arose from the data with families during respective
deployment cycles.
Social media (macrosystem)
Family 2
I am close to other war widows in our Facebook group. They
have been a great support and know what it is like. I could access
it (counselling) but it would be a waste of time. How would a
counsellor know what I was going through? They have not
experienced the death of a husband and the father of their child.
I just talk to my Facebook group.
At the macrosystem level, Wendy (Family 2) took great
comfort in the emotional support offered by a group of
young war widows who communicated using FacebookTM.
Conversely, Wendy did not access the ADF-supplied coun-
selors who she felt would not understand her. She felt her
situation was unique and that being a war widow was not
something counselors would understand or could assist
with.
Care packages (macrosystem)
Family 1
He sent some parcels and we sent him a care package most
weeks. We would cook his favourite biscuits and send drawings
the kids did and other things.
Care packages are parcels containing presents and nonperish-
able food sent from home to deployed parents. Items from the
deployed parent can also be sent, often containing toys or tour-
ist items depending upon the nature and area of deployment.
During deployment, the family or deployed parent can post one
package a week free of charge. Parents from two of the case
study families cited care packages as an effective communica-
tion strategy for the families at home to communicate with the
deployed parent. Parents who discussed this type of communi-
cation used the packages to show children's artwork and send
favorite food items they had baked with the children.
Rogers-Baber 11
Video conferencing and phone calls (macrosystem)
Family 1 Caleb
I was able to use SkypeTM most days and that was great. It was
really helpful to me to be able to see them and know they were
safe and OK.
Family 1 Fiona
He was able to use SkypeTM most days. He said he found that
really helpful being able to see us every day and know we were
OK. I found it very draining. Phone calls are better as Caleb can
be on speakerphone and I can keep attending to the children and
do housework while we chat. SkypeTM sessions every night
meant you had to be totally available for an hour at a really bad
time of night. The kids and I were both tired, the kids were
whingey and sometimes it was the last thing you felt like doing.
I did it anyway and of course would never tell him how much I
hated it.
Family 3
SkypeTM and phone calls helped. Sundays were special SkypeTM
days once a fortnight normally. There were no mobile phones or
texts. Seb left his phone at home.
Another type of communication technology, video-confer-
encing software, such as SkypeTM was often utilized by fami-
lies during deployment when it is available. For one family
within this study, utilizing such services was a pleasant
weekly event, looked forward to by all concerned even
though it involved the deployed parent lining up for lengthy
periods of time. For another family, the deployed parent took
great comfort in the ability to see and hear his family each
night, but for the nondeployed parent it became yet another
responsibility. She felt she had to cope with the nightly ses-
sions without complaint to attend to the needs of her spouse.
Discussion
This discussion focuses on the three areas of protective rela-
tionships within the microsystem, exosystem, and macrosys-
tem evident from the data.
Protective Factors Provided by Relationships
(Microsystem)
Protective factors provided by personal relationships
revealed family cohesion, support, role flexibility, and
awareness. Protective factors provided by professional rela-
tionships demonstrated the parent's desire and high regard
for quality partnerships.
Personal relationships.Many families are able to show an
increased level of flexibility, with members taking on new
responsibilities and roles during deployment (Bowling &
Sherman, 2008). This flexibility was revealed in Family 1
when Sam took on his father's household chores and helped
his sister get ready for day care. Sibling relationships often
promote resilience in children as they learn to help others in
times of need, and this behavior can become an ongoing part
of their lives (Brooks, 2011). However, love and friendship
often go hand in hand with fights and competition within
sibling relationships (Burton, Westen, & Kowalski, 2012),
and children in this study also demonstrated this tension.
Manigart, Lecoq, and Lo Bue (2015) identified a typical
response of older siblings, where they feel they need to take
care of younger siblings to assist during deployment. Shep-
pard et al. (2010) listed "flexible gender roles and comfort
performing multiple roles" as useful in helping families cope
with the difficulties during deployment (p. 603). Children's
emotional development begins in infancy (Gonzalez-Mena
& Widmeyer Eyer, 1997) and is dependent on social support
(Hayes, 2013). This social and emotional development
occurs most commonly within parent and sibling relation-
ships, and therefore the manner in which these relationships
operate can be protective, or conversely, potentially expose
children to greater risks.
Social support across a range of levels is important to nur-
ture resilience in families (Burton et al., 2012). In military
families, as in all families, resilience is generally linked to a
supportive extended family (Lemmon & Chartrand, 2009).
Furthermore, Linke (2007) stressed the importance of the
nondeployed parent having access to emotional and physical
support. When families are stretched, they are often working
at their peak emotional and physical capacity, meaning that
even small changes or disruptions can cause major upsets
(Arthur, Beecher, Death, Dockett, & Farmer, 2008). While
one might argue that relocation could potentially trigger feel-
ings of overload, it does appear that the family assistance
resulting from the relocation mitigated the stress to an extent.
In this study, all families relocated to be closer to the chil-
dren's grandparents at some stage. It is clear that extended
family, family friends, and educators can be a source of spe-
cial relationships that operate as protective factors assisting
the development of resilient children as reported by Brooks
(2011).
MacManus et al. (2012), Lara-Cinisomo et al. (2011), and
White, de Burgh, Fear, and Iversen (2011) have argued that
multiple deployments increase the risks families experience.
This is most likely due to the repeated feelings of grief and
loss (Gillies & Neimeyer, 2006) when families are still vul-
nerable and are less able to be resilient. This was evident in
Family 1 who found the second deployment far more stress-
ful for a number of reasons. Chandra, Martin, Hawkins, and
Richardson (2010) stressed the need for increased assistance
for families affected by multiple redeployments or longer
deployments. In contrast, Lowe,Adams, Browne, and Hinkle
(2012) and McGuire et al. (2012) found little difference
between the impact of single and multiple deployments on
families; however, McGuire et al. (2012) conceded that
12 SAGE Open
parents tend to be increasingly negative about the effects of
deployment on their children with multiple deployments.
DeVoe and Ross (2012) described this as a common reaction
of nondeployed parents who are dealing with the loss of their
partner and the overwhelming "financial, household, and
parenting responsibilities" (p. 186). Reinforcement is more
readily available for families when they live on or close to
the defense base (Brooks, 2011), which is particularly impor-
tant for those without extended family nearby because access
to parental support also affects the children. Flake et al.
(2009) believed that parenting, resources, supports, and resil-
ience influence children's psychosocial functioning during
the deployment cycle.
Sims (2002) outlined characteristics of strong families,
including spending time together, encouraging individual
growth within a cohesive unit, communication without
blame or prejudice, supporting each other physically and
emotionally, working together to cope and caring for one
another. Walsh (2003) discussed the key processes in family
resilience as the ability of a family to make sense of difficul-
ties along with adaptability, interconnectivity, attitude,
shared problem solving, and healthy emotional expression.
These abilities are diminished when multiple and ongoing
stressors overwhelm the family, increasing their susceptibil-
ity to further problems (Walsh, 2003). Within ADF families,
constant comings and goings of parents due to training epi-
sodes can cause this type of ongoing, spasmodic family dis-
ruption and along with deployment, can increase family
stress (Pincombe & Pincombe, 2010). The returned parent's
needs are heightened by anxiety about the reunion and rein-
tegration. Many experience a sense of being no longer
needed, nor part of the family. Others fear rejection that may
lead to more serious reintegration issues (Palmer, 2008). Seb,
within Family 3, demonstrated some of these issues during
integration. An understanding and supportive spouse can
help alleviate many of these issues, as evidenced in the data.
Professional relationships with educators and teachers.Belong-
ing, Being, Becoming, The Early Years Learning Frame-
work for Australia (EYLF; Department of Education,
Employment and Workplace Relations [DEEWR], 2009)
outlines the importance of genuine partnerships between
families and educators to achieve the best learning outcomes
for children by valuing each other's knowledge and efforts
and collaborating in decision making. Elliott (2014) recom-
mended building this type of trusting relationship based on
the sociocultural assumptions those families' diverse cul-
tures; experiences and family traditions are esteemed and
appreciated. In this study, all families expressed their desire
for educator support, input, and suggested strategies.
In Family 2, Wendy had more difficulty building this type
of relationship with Michael's first primary schoolteacher,
and this affected the provision of additional school assis-
tance. She believed that Michael's education suffered
because of the difference of opinion about the need to access
funding to support his learning difficulties. The ecological
framework positions the mesosystem in terms of relation-
ships between different players within the microsystems:
The greater the coherence between the players, the better the
outcomes for Michael. This level of coherence and the rela-
tions between the players are framed as the mesosystem
(Bowes, Grace, & Hayes, 2012). Specifically, there was a
change over time (chronosystem) in the quality of the rela-
tionships between Wendy and Michael's early childhood
educator, then schoolteacher, with negative consequences for
Michael.
Andres and Moelker (2011) described the difficulties a
number of children face during the reintegration stage of the
deployment cycle, due to their feeling separated and uncer-
tain. Educators who have strong relationships with young
children or are communicating with the family will be more
likely to identify times of need and may be able to provide
extra time to support during this vulnerable stage. They
need to invest time to listen to the children and acknowledge
their emotions, responding professionally and creating joint
understandings (Nolan, Stagnitti, Taket, & Casey, 2014).
Lowe et al. (2012) stressed the importance of addressing
issues during this period to promote the long-term stability
of the whole family unit. Sharing insightful dialogues with
an early childhood professional to assist with family com-
munication during this stressful reintegration period was
very comforting for Fiona from Family 1. This type of com-
munication with families is recognized as a crucial element
in quality early childhood service delivery where educators
and families reciprocate information in a respectful manner
(DEEWR, 2009). For example, Gonzalez-Mena (2009) rec-
ommended that educators become knowledgeable about
ways to support families' connection with the community
and help engage the assistance they need. In addition, edu-
cators can often be the link between families and support
services (Arthur et al., 2015).
Protective Factors Within the Exosystem and
Macrosystem
Within this theme, several substrands are discussed, including
the formal supports and various forms of communication.
Formal supports (exosystem and macrosystem).Within the
exosystem, the ADF culture can be quite encouraging in
many families during times of stress (Baber et al., 2015). In
addition, Brooks (2011) stated that "families cope best if
they accept the military lifestyle and see meaning in the sac-
rifices they make" (p. 496). In this study, Wendy from Fam-
ily 2 also stated that she wanted her son Michael to understand
this. Bowling and Sherman (2008) explained that creating a
shared narrative can help bind families together and reduce
stress. The content of these narratives demonstrates a high
level of acculturation from the ADF and the wider commu-
nity and Australian Government meta-narratives.
Rogers-Baber 13
AnumberofcharityorganizationsandAustralianGovernment
Departments assist military and veteran families. Similar experi-
ences to Wendy's are identified by Crompvoets (2012) who
raised issues of outdated models being used to deal with current
veterans and their families, thus creating issues in accessing
appropriate and effective provision, revealing a need for reform.
Communication (macrosystem).Within research with FIFO
families, Meredith, Rush, and Robinson (2014) reported on
the impact social networking sites can have as an "impor-
tant mediating effect" (p. 15). Other war widows sharing
their experiences of ADF counseling via social media may
have influenced Wendy's decision not to use ADF counsel-
ing. Within the ADF, Siebler (2015) reported family mem-
bers' experiences accessing the ADF's professional support
staff who struggled to effectively listen to their concerns,
empathize and build relationships that are essential in
engendering trust and usage of such services. His findings
recommended the use of digital communication technolo-
gies and social media as an opportunity to build upon assis-
tance for ADF families in online communities (Siebler,
2015).
The availability of being able to send ADF-funded care
packages helped Family 1 and Family 3 feel connected.
Linke (2007) stated that care packages provide excitement
when they arrive for the children, whereas for the deployed
parent it can be encouraging having something familiar from
home arriving at the base (Defence Community Organisation,
2013).
Along with letter writing, emails are thought to serve as a
protective factor for families during deployment (Palmer,
2008). Families who made the effort to stay in touch were
easing the way for the reintegration process because main-
taining contact and regular communication kept relation-
ships strong and fresh, potentially relieving feelings of
loneliness and loss, and reducing stress. Family 1 also
involved the children in this process, sharing artwork and
captions. Such opportunities to share special moments, emo-
tions, and reaffirm love and care also help maintain relation-
ships (Defence Community Organisation, 2014) highlighting
the importance of ADF-supplied communication technolo-
gies for the deployed parent.
Bartone (2015) rationalized other defense force's exten-
sive funding of video-conferencing communication services
for deployed forces to increase morale and mitigate stress.
Within Family 1, Fiona's frustrations of nightly SkypeTM ses-
sions with Caleb reflect the increasingly crowded and stress-
ful family life associated with managing dual careers and
family responsibilities described by Poole (2005). In defense
families, De Angelis and Segal (2015) described this con-
flict, stating "Military families, . . . exist at the intersection of
two major social institutions that make great, often compet-
ing, demands on their time, energy and loyalty" (p. 22). In
line with the revelations from the data, military families are
encompassed by a culture of service and sacrifice that
features heavily in the justification of the regime, legitimiz-
ing the gender inequities (Eran-Jona, 2015).
Limitations of the Study
While various themes have emerged during data analysis, the
study represents only three families from defense forces in
Australia. While every effort was made to reduce researcher
bias, the narrative methodology including interview ques-
tions and interpretation of secondary data about the children
was open to my understandings. As a researcher, I am not
from a military family. This may be beneficial, being able to
detect detailed nuances of the culture and the acculturation
processes; however, Chandra and London (2013) indicated
that this may also limit the understanding of the defense
culture.
Conclusion
This study acknowledges and identifies the stressors of hav-
ing a parent who works away, especially in defense families.
De Angelis and Segal (2015) described both the military and
the family itself as greedy institutions who have undergone
enormous change over the past decades, increasing the con-
flicting interests between them. Outdated models of deploy-
ment still place family responsibility onto the nondeploying
spouse who is generally juggling their own career and family
responsibility (De Angelis & Segal, 2015) while often iso-
lated from their extended family. Despite deployment being
taxing and testing for families (Siebler, 2015), a number of
protective factors were identified for the three families in this
study. These protective factors came from the microsystem,
including within the families themselves, in the extended
family and friend network and from educators. Protective
factors were also identified within the exosystem through the
ADF provisions and community organizations and within
the macrosystem through Australian Government
Departments and social media. Communication tools and
technology also provided a medium for many of these provi-
sions. By utilizing these protective factors, the families were
showing varying degrees of resilience. All identified protec-
tive factors were acknowledged as important to assist defense
families cope with the deployment cycle and even after the
death of a family member. Although not all families utilized
all available supports, it can be reassuring to know assistance
is available (Baber et al., 2015). Importantly, these protective
factors form a vital buffer for the children and families dur-
ing the stresses of deployment cycle, therefore reducing risk
factors. The well-being of military children is important, and
understanding which protective factors are valued and effec-
tive may increase our capacity to support these potentially
vulnerable families. These findings can inform the ADF:
policy makers, social workers, Regional Education Liaison
Officers (REDLOs), and others who support military fami-
lies such as counselors and educators. Further research into
14 SAGE Open
these protective factors is crucial; hence, assistance can be
targeted and effective for military children and families.
