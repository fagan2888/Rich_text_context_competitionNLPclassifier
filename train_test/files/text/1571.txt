in U.S. Children
Anil Darbari,1 Keith M. Sabin,2 Craig N. Shapiro,2 and Kathleen B. Schwarz1
The epidemiology of primary hepatic malignancies in U.S. children is poorly characterized.
We analyzed the incidence, mortality, and characteristics of primary hepatic malignancies in
U.S. residents less than 20 years of age. Fatal primary hepatic malignancies in persons less
than 20 years of age, between 1979 and 1996, were identified using the multiple-cause-of-
death database (National Center for Health Statistics). Histologically confirmed primary
hepatic malignancies occurring between 1973 and 1997 were identified using the Surveil-
lance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. Between 1979 and 1996, 918
primary hepatic malignancy deaths (average, 0.7/1,000,000/year) were reported nationally
among persons less than 20 years of age; rates were higher among Asians and among foreign-
born children. Between 1973 and 1997, 271 primary hepatic malignancy cases were reported
to SEER among persons less than 20 years of age, of which 184 (67%) and 83 (31%) were
hepatoblastoma and hepatocellular carcinoma, respectively. Among children less than 5
years of age, hepatoblastoma accounted for 91% of primary hepatic malignancy cases,
whereas among those 15 to 19 years of age, hepatocellular carcinoma accounted for 87% of
cases. Five-year survival for hepatoblastoma was 52%, compared with 18% for hepatocellu-
lar carcinoma. In the SEER sites, between 1973 and 1977 and 1993 and 1997, hepatoblas-
toma rates increased (0.6 to 1.2/1,000,000, respectively), while hepatocellular carcinoma
rates decreased (0.45 to 0.29/1,000,000, respectively). In conclusion, histologically con-
firmed hepatocellular carcinoma was reported in children less than 5 years of age, also, where
hepatoblastoma is the predominant primary hepatic malignancy. Hepatocellular carcinoma
has worse survival rates than hepatoblastoma, and its incidence has not increased. Better
maintenance of databases may provide information about associated factors behind this
unexpected occurrence. (HEPATOLOGY 2003;38:560-566.)
Primary hepatic malignancies are rare in children.1
Malignant neoplasm of the liver is more frequent
in adults, is predominantly hepatocellular carci-
noma, and is usually secondary to decades of liver injury
from hepatitis B virus and/or hepatitis C virus infec-
tion,1-3 alcoholic liver disease,4-6 or both. In contrast, pri-
mary hepatic malignancies in children are most
commonly either hepatoblastoma or hepatocellular carci-
noma. Hepatocellular carcinoma has been observed in
young children with tyrosinemia and other inherited met-
abolic disorders7 and in older children with hepatitis B
virus infection acquired perinatally.8-10 However, the ep-
idemiology of primary hepatic malignancies in U.S. chil-
dren is not well characterized. Most available information
is from institution-based case series; since a 1975 national
survey of U.S. pediatric surgeons,11 no population-based
evaluation of primary liver cancer in U.S. children has
been published.
In recent decades, the advent of pediatric liver trans-
plantation and other developments has brought increased
attention to a number of potentially fatal childhood liver
diseases, including primary hepatic malignancy. Pediatric
hepatocellular carcinoma is of special interest because its
rates in children decreased in Taiwan after introduction of
routine infant hepatitis B vaccination.12,13 To improve
the medical and surgical management of primary hepatic
malignancies and to develop and evaluate prevention

strategies, more data on the epidemiology of the disease
among U.S. children are needed. The purpose of the
present study was to describe the epidemiology of primary
hepatic malignancies in U.S. children under twenty years
of age from 1973 to 1997.
Materials and Methods
Mortality Data. Data from the National Center for
Health Statistics (NCHS) multiple-cause-of-death data-
base from 1979 to 1996 were obtained for persons less
than 20 years of age.14 From death certificates on which
"primary malignant neoplasm of liver" (ICD-9 CM code
155.0; hepatoblastoma and hepatocellular carcinoma do
not have separate ICD-9 codes)15 was listed as a primary
cause of death, information was obtained on each death,
including age at death, race/ethnic origin, sex, geographic
area of residence, place of birth, and underlying and con-
tributing causes of death.
Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Data.
The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results
(SEER) program collects cancer data from designated
population-based cancer registries representing approxi-
mately 14% of the U.S. population. It codes histology
and cancer site by the International Classification of Dis-
ease for Oncology, second edition (ICD-O-2), and by the
International Classification for Childhood Cancers
(ICCC) systems.16,17 Histologically confirmed cases of
hepatocellular carcinoma (ICD-O-2 code 8170) and
hepatoblastoma (ICD-O-2 code 8970) among persons
less than 20 years of age reported in the period from 1973
to 1997 were included in this study. Other information
collected included duration of survival after diagnosis and
population characteristics.
Population Data. Population estimates were ob-
tained from the U.S. Census Bureau.
Statistical Analysis. Data analyses were performed
using SPSS and Sigmastat (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL) sta-
tistical packages. Rates were calculated using population
data and adjusted to the 1990 U.S. standard population
using the direct method. Differences in age-specific inci-
dence of hepatoblastoma and hepatocellular carcinoma
(SEER database) for 5-year periods from 1973 to 1997
and differences in gender-specific incidence were analyzed
by the 2 test. Trends in annual incidence rates were an-
alyzed using standard linear regression methods.
Results
Multiple-Cause-of-Death Data. In the multiple-
cause-of-death database, 918 children aged less than 20
years were reported with the primary cause of death listed
as "primary malignant neoplasm of liver" between 1979
and 1996. The mean age was 8.2 years (median, 6 years).
Of these, 59.6% were male, 80.5% were white, 14.4%
were black, 2.2% were Asian-Pacific Islander, and 1%
were American Indian/native Alaskan. Overall, the annu-
alized age-adjusted rate between 1979 and 1996 was 0.7/
1,000,000. Age-adjusted rates were higher in males versus
females (0.22/1,000,000 vs. 0.16/1,000,000) and higher
among Asians and others (1.02/1,000,000 and 1.06/
1,000,000, respectively) versus whites and blacks (0.93/
1,000,000 and 0.98/1,000,000). Age-specific incidence
was 1.5/1,000,000 in the 0- to 4-year-old age group,
0.3/1,000,000 in the 5- to 9-year-old age group, 0.4/
1,000,000 in the 10- to 14-year-old age group, and 0.6/
1,000,000 in the 15- to 19-year-old age group. Although
94% of cases of fatal primary hepatic malignancies were
reported in U.S.-born children, the incidence of fatal pri-
mary hepatic malignancy was higher among foreign-born
children (1/1,000,000) compared with U.S.-born chil-
dren (0.6/1,000,000).
On death certificates, up to 20 contributory causes can
be listed by the reporting physician. Although hepatore-
nal tyrosinemia is known to be associated with childhood
hepatocellular carcinoma, tyrosinemia does not have a
separate ICD-9 code. Instead, we examined ICD-9 code
270.2, which could include any one of albinism, alkap-
tonuria, alkaptonuric ochronosis, disturbances of tyrosine
and tryptophan metabolism, homogentisic acid defects,
hydroxykynureninuria, hypertyrosinemia, indicanuria,
kynureninase defects, oasthouse urine disease, ochrono-
sis, tyrosinosis, tyrosinuria, and Waardenburg syndrome.
Among the reports of deaths from primary hepatic malig-
nancies in children between 1979 and 1996, 94.4% did
not have a contributory cause mentioned. The most com-
mon contributory conditions listed were aromatic amino
acid disorder (ICD-9 270.2) in 17 (1.9%) of cases, non-
alcoholic cirrhosis (ICD-9 571.5) in 1.8% of cases,
chronic liver disease (ICD-9 571.9) in 1.4% of cases, and
hepatitis B (ICD-9 070.20) in 1.4% of cases. The data-
base is not constructed to determine whether overlap ex-
ists between associated conditions such as hepatitis B and
chronic liver disease. Neither is it possible to determine
whether the associated conditions were associated with
hepatoblastoma or hepatocellular carcinoma. Hepatitis B
was listed as contributory condition in 7.3% of death
certificates among foreign-born children, compared with
1.3% among U.S.-born children.
In examining rates over time, the annual age-adjusted
rate of reported deaths from primary hepatic malignancies
ranged between 0.5 and 1/1,000,000 between 1979 and
1996, and remained relatively stable for all years (Fig. 1)

and for different racial/ethnic groups and persons born
outside the United States (data not shown).
SEER Data. In the SEER database, 303 cases of he-
patic malignancies in children less than 20 years of age
were reported between 1973 and 1997, representing
1.1% of all pediatric malignancies diagnosed during this
time period. Of the 303 cases, 271 (89%) were primary
hepatic malignancies, and 32 (11%) were secondary (ex-
trahepatic malignancies metastatic to the liver). Based on
the ICCC site code, of the 271 cases of primary hepatic
malignancies, 184 (67%) were diagnosed as hepatoblas-
toma, 83 (31%) were diagnosed as hepatocellular carci-
noma, and 4 (1.5%) were unspecified. The overall
age-adjusted rates (95% confidence intervals) of hepato-
blastoma were 1.09 (0.89-1.37) per 1,000,000 and of
hepatocellular carcinoma were 0.41 (0.24-0.65) per
1,000,000.
Of the 184 histologically confirmed hepatoblastoma
cases among children less than 20 years of age, 168
(91.3%) were among children less than 5 years of age:
57% were male, 79% were white, 10% were black, 10%
were other, and 1% were unknown. Age-adjusted rates
(95% confidence intervals) of hepatoblastoma were 1.22
(0.94-1.65) and 0.96 (0.68-1.38) per 1,000,000 for males
and females, respectively, and 1.11 (0.87-1.4), 0.88
(0.47-1.95), and 1.16 (0.68-2.59) per 1,000,000 for
whites, blacks, and others, respectively.
Of the 70 histologically confirmed hepatocellular car-
cinoma cases reported to SEER among children less than
20 years of age between 1973 and 1997, 12.86% were
among children less than 5 years of age, whereas 34%
were among children 15 to 19 years old. Of these, 56%
were male, 73% were white, 11% were black, and 16%
were other races. Age-adjusted rates (95% confidence in-
tervals) of hepatocellular carcinoma for males and females
were 0.45 (0.21-0.83) and 0.37 (0.17-0.72) per
1,000,000, respectively, and were 0.37 (0.20-0.65), 0.38
(0.08-1.32), and 0.75 (0.08-1.32) per 1,000,000 for
whites, blacks, and others, respectively.
The age-adjusted rates for the various age groups dif-
fered substantially for the 2 types of primary hepatic ma-
lignancies. For hepatoblastoma, the rate was substantially
higher for children less than 5 years of age and was rela-
tively lower for older age groups (Fig. 2). The age-ad-
justed incidence rates (95% confidence intervals) per
million were 4.0 (3.42-4.65) for hepatoblastoma and
0.21 (0.07-0.41) for hepatocellular carcinoma in the less
than 5 years age group; after this age, rates of hepatoblas-
toma fall dramatically, and primary hepatic malignancies
were largely hepatocellular carcinoma. The rate of hepa-
tocellular carcinoma was relatively low for all age groups
(Fig. 2).
Between 1973-1977 and 1993-1997, the rate of hepa-
toblastoma increased 93% (0.61 vs. 1.18 per 1,000,000,
respectively, P  .0001) (Fig. 3). In comparison, the in-
cidence of hepatocellular carcinoma in children showed a
tendency to decrease during the same time period (Fig. 3),
although the rates in 1973-1977 vs. 1993-1997 were not
significantly different (0.45 vs. 0.29 per 1,000,000, P 
.17).
The overall 5-year survival for children less than 20
years of age diagnosed with hepatoblastoma was 52.4%
and, for children less than 20 years of age diagnosed with
hepatocellular carcinoma, 18.0% (Table 1). For hepato-
cellular carcinoma, the survival was significantly lower in
the third, fourth, and fifth years following the diagnosis as
compared with the first year (P  .001). There were no
statistically significant differences in the survival by age,
sex, or race, although the numbers of persons within each
subcategory were small (data not shown).

Discussion
Primary hepatic malignancies in children are relatively
rare. Based on SEER data, primary hepatic malignancies
make up approximately 1% of all malignant neoplasms
among children less than 20 years of age. Previously pub-
lished reviews of hepatoblastoma and hepatocellular car-
cinoma have been generally institution-based case series,
and the clinical reports on hepatocellular carcinoma in
U.S. children since 1905 are scarce. Most of the reports
from the United States are case series or questionnaires of
physicians.11,18-21 There are hospital-based case se-
ries9,22,23 and epidemiologic analysis of hepatocellular car-
cinoma from the cancer registry24 of China. The data
presented here, which are based on nationwide death cer-
tificate data (NCHS) and population-based registries
(SEER), provide a more complete and representative
overview than can be obtained from case series.
Annually, 36 to 69 deaths from primary malignant
neoplasms of the liver among children less than 20 years
of age were reported in the multiple-cause-of-death data-
base. From the SEER database, 67% and 31% of primary
hepatic malignancies were histologically confirmed as
hepatoblastoma and hepatocellular carcinoma, respec-
tively. Applying these percentages to the multiple-cause-
of-death database, an estimated 615 children (average, 34
per year) and 284 children (average, 16 per year) would
have died of hepatoblastoma and hepatocellular carci-
noma, respectively, between 1979 and 1996.
As reflected in the SEER data, hepatoblastoma is gen-
erally a disease of children less than 5 years of age. Rates of
hepatoblastoma are 20-fold higher than rates of hepato-
cellular carcinoma for children under 5 years of age. Based
on SEER data, the rates among boys and girls did not
differ significantly (M/F ratio was 1.32 for hepatoblas-
toma and 1.27 for hepatocellular carcinoma). This con-
trasts with previous reports, in which a stronger male
predominance for both hepatoblastoma and hepatocellu-
lar carcinoma has been observed.11,18-21,23,24
Risk factors for hepatoblastoma are not well character-
ized. Hepatoblastoma has been shown to be associated
with Beckwith-Weidmann syndrome25,26 hemihypertro-
phy, and familial adenomatous polyposis, none of which
have unique ICD-9 codes.27 The relatively low incidence
of these conditions did not allow us to examine their
association with hepatoblastoma in the multiple cause of
death database. Recent reports from the United States and
Japan have suggested an increased incidence of hepato-
blastoma in extremely low birth weight infants.28-31 Be-
cause birth weight is not collected in the SEER database,
we could not analyze this association.

NOTE. For hepatoblastoma, 6 patients were excluded from the analysis because they were autopsy or death certificate case (2), because race values were not
provided (2), and because they were alive with no survival time (2). For hepatocellular carcinoma, 2 patients were excluded from the survival analysis because of
development of a second malignancy (1), and because they were autopsy or death certificate cases (1). Data are age adjusted to the 1970 U.S. standard population.

Risk factors for hepatocellular carcinoma in children
are also not well characterized. Between 1970 and 1992,
hepatocellular carcinoma was the third most frequently
seen pediatric liver tumor at the Armed Forces Institute of
Pathology.18 Associated conditions were seen in less than
25% of cases, including biliary atresia, congenital hepatic
fibrosis, Byler disease, and Wilson disease. Hepatorenal
tyrosinemia is associated with an early age of onset of
hepatocellular carcinoma.32 This condition could not be
examined specifically in the multiple-cause-of-death da-
tabase; aromatic amino acid disorders in general were re-
ported in less than 2% of hepatocellular carcinoma
deaths. Hepatocellular carcinoma is strongly associated
with hepatitis B virus infection in adults.33 In young chil-
dren with hepatitis B virus infection, hepatocellular car-
cinoma has been reported from Southeast Asia and
Europe.8-10,34 Of all 918 deaths reported in the multiple-
cause-of-death database, less than 6% had any associated
liver disease coded, e.g., chronic liver disease, hepatitis
B, and others. The relative absence of contributory con-
ditions reported with hepatocellular carcinoma in the
multiple-cause-of-death database suggests that these con-
ditions may have been underdiagnosed or unrecognized.
However, the higher proportion of foreign-born children
with hepatitis B listed as a contributory cause of death
compared with U.S.-born children highlights an impor-
tant feature of the epidemiology of hepatitis B virus infec-
tion in the United States. Although prevalence of
hepatitis B virus infection is relatively low in the United
States, where, overall, only 5% of the general population
has serologic evidence of past infection and less than 1%
are chronically infected,35 the extent to which children
acquire hepatitis B virus infection in the United States has
not been appreciated, primarily because most infections
in this age group are asymptomatic. Not including peri-
natal infections, recent estimates indicate that 16,000
children less than 10 years old were being infected annu-
ally in the United States prior to implementation of rou-
tine infant hepatitis B immunization in 1992.36 However,
by 2000, 90% of 19- to 36-month-old children had been
fully immunized with 3 doses of hepatitis B vaccine,37 and
the incidence of acute hepatitis B among children less
than 15 years old had decreased by 75%.38 Because the
risk of developing chronic infection and its sequelae such
as hepatocellular carcinoma is inversely related to age,
routine childhood hepatitis B immunization will eventu-
ally have a major impact on hepatitis B-related chronic
liver disease deaths among both children and adults.
The success of routine childhood hepatitis B immuni-
zation in interrupting hepatitis B virus transmission and
preventing chronic infection has been demonstrated in
developing countries where most infections are acquired
in infancy and early childhood. During the 15 years after
routine childhood hepatitis B immunization was imple-
mented in Taiwan, chronic hepatitis B virus prevalence
among children less than 15 years old declined 93%, and
hepatocellular carcinoma rates among 6- to 14-year-old
children declined 50%.12,13,39
Given the absence of alcoholic liver disease in children
and the association of some inborn errors of metabolism
with hepatocellular carcinoma in childhood, we expected
that the epidemiology of hepatocellular carcinoma in U.S.
children might differ from that for adults. For childhood
hepatocellular carcinoma, we observed (1) no increase in
the annual incidence over the last 2 decades compared
with the rate for adults, which increased from
1.4/100,000 during 1976-1980 to 2.4/100,000 during
1991-199540; (2) an underlying liver disease was less often
a contributing cause in children than adults; (3) lack of
male predominance compared with adults among whom
incidence is 3-fold higher in men versus women40; (4) no
difference in incidence in whites versus blacks compared
with a 2-fold higher incidence in blacks compared with
whites in adults40; and (5) poorer 5-year survival rates
compared with those in adults.40
The 5-year survival rate for children with hepatoblas-
toma was 52%. An improvement in surgical techniques
and improved chemotherapy along with selective use of
transplantation could account for these survival rates.41-43
However, hepatocellular carcinoma survival rates con-
tinue to be poor. The 18% overall 5-year survival rate in
the U.S. children with hepatocellular carcinoma in this
study is similar to that reported from previous studies.18,20
In contrast, the 5-year survival rate in adults from an
International Registry of Hepatic Tumors in Liver Trans-
plantation has been shown to be 44.4%.43 Survival rates
are better with surgical resection plus transplantation in
selected groups of individuals41-43 compared with resec-
tion alone and better for resection compared with no re-
section both in adults41 and in children.41,44 Newer
techniques such as intrahepatic chemoembolization have
been shown to be promising in children with unresectable
tumors.45
The United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) has
operated the Organ Procurement and Transplantation
Network (OPTN) under contract with the Health Re-
sources and Services Administration of the U.S. Depart-
ment of Health and Human Services since 1986.46 To
review whether liver transplantation had any effect on
primary hepatic malignancies, we reviewed the OPTN
data from 1988 to 1996, corresponding to the period
studied in SEER and NCHS databases. Viewed ecologi-
cally, liver transplantation appears to have minimal affect
on liver cancer mortality. Between 1988 and 1996, 72
564 DARBARI ET AL. HEPATOLOGY, September 2003
patients younger than 18 years of age (4-9 patients annu-
ally, with the exception of 18 transplantations performed
during 1993) were listed as having received liver trans-
plantation for hepatoblastoma, hepatoma (hepatocellular
carcinoma) and cirrhosis, or hepatoma (hepatocellular
carcinoma).46 Furthermore, the majority of liver trans-
plantations performed among children under 5 years of
age were for hepatoblastoma, whereas those for children
over 10 years of age were for hepatocellular carcinoma
(Fig. 4), similar to the findings in our study.
A lack of awareness for this highly fatal malignancy
among physicians caring for children could result in a
delay in the diagnosis in children. This could result in
vascular invasion and be considered a factor for worse
survival in adults, even with resection.41,43 We hope to
improve the awareness of childhood hepatocellular carci-
noma among physicians caring for children so that these
children are diagnosed earlier and their survival is im-
proved.
This study has several limitations. Autopsies are not
routinely performed to verify cause of death; therefore,
diagnoses may not be accurate. Lack of differentiation
between hepatoblastoma and hepatocellular carcinoma
based on ICD-9 CM codes in the multiple-cause-of-death
database makes finer analyses impossible. The SEER da-
tabase is representative of 14% of the U.S. population and
should not be extrapolated to the entire United States.
Our study highlights the need for inclusion of contribut-
ing causes of death in these databases.
Primary hepatic malignancies in children are predom-
inantly hepatoblastoma in children less than 5 years of age
and hepatocellular carcinoma in children older than 5
years. Over the last 2 decades, rates of hepatoblastoma in
children less than 20 years of age have increased, but rates
of hepatocellular carcinoma have been relatively stable.
Survival rates for hepatoblastoma are substantially higher
than for hepatocellular carcinoma. Finally, the epidemi-
ology of hepatocellular carcinoma in children appears to
differ from that in adults. Risk factors and conditions
contributing to both hepatoblastoma and hepatocellular
carcinoma need to be better characterized to optimize the
medical and surgical management and to improve the
survival of children with such highly fatal malignancies.
