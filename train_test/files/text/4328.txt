Introduction
State of language consists of many components: status of
languages, language policy, language conflicts, linguistic
competence, and value orientation, as well as functional dis-
tribution of languages in various social spheres. In the
research into state of language, much attention is paid to
determination of factors, the interaction of which influences
its dynamics (Ayupova, 2000; Chernyshev, 1997). It is obvi-
ous that generation and modification of the state of language
take place due to a complex network of objective (linguistic,
cultural-historical, demographic, geographical, economic,
social-historical) and subjective (sociological and political)
factors (Galimyanova, 2007).
However, the fact that state of language has a procedural
dynamic character means that the quality of functioning of
two and more languages must be a leading indicator in the
characteristics of states of language. Distribution of lan-
guages in the sphere of public education, mass communica-
tion, and culture shows not only demand of one or another
language in a definite sphere but also the degree of coverage
of communicative demand by the given language, the
accordance of its development with communicative tasks.
For instance, in the situation of mass bilingualism, there
arises a problem of functional potential of each of the lan-
guages forming state of language.
When studying state of language, specifically determina-
tion of the status of languages,Ayupova (2000) and Baskakov
(1994) proceed from the criterion of multifunctionality of a
language. This criterion is defined by a group of social func-
tions performed by the language and often does not corre-
spond with the legal status of language. It refers to the former
USSR republics when the republic's title language gets the
status of the state language but is not used to the full in such
integrated state spheres as administration, industry, science,
communication, and transportation. According to Baskakov,
at the territory of the former USSR, only the Russian

Research Into Functioning of the State
Language in the Situation of Mass
Bilingualism of North Kazakhstan Using
the Differential Technique
Natalya Mongilyova1
Abstract
The article deals with the issue of bilingualism and performance of necessary communicative functions by the state language,
when the official status of the language is in contradiction with the real communicative possibilities. The research is conducted
on the example of state of language of north Kazakhstan represented by mass Kazakh­Russian bilingualism. The research
techniques were worked out on the basis of questionnaires of situation analysis and differential technique with the calculation
of the coefficient of preference of one or another language by ethnical Kazakhs. The article defines the reasons of the choice
of the language in certain everyday situations. The choice of Kazakh as the main language is often motivated by ethnical self-
identity of Kazakhstan residents. The language in which respondents were educated is also a decisive factor in preferring
Kazakh or Russian in various situations. The research also determined a disturbing tendency of general preference of Russian
by young respondents, loss of position of Kazakh in information space, and as a means of acquiring knowledge, wrong notion
about the native language. Study of public functions of languages in the situations of bilingualism using differential technique,
as it was done in this study, allows objectively estimating the state of language and defining the extralinguistic factor that
determines this state and states the language problem correctly.

language complies with the criterion of multifunctionality,
which is the reason of mass bilingualism in new post-Soviet
republics (Baskakov, 1992).
Characteristics of State of Language in
the Northern Region of Kazakhstan
Functioning of languages in modern Kazakhstan has its
unique features. On one hand, we can observe the co-exis-
tence of a big amount of typologically and genetically differ-
ent languages (more than 130 nations and nationalities live in
the country); on the other hand, we can state the existence of
two most wide-spread languages--Kazakh and Russian. But
study of this situation rarely becomes the object of the
research (Zhikeyeva, 2011) or is not conducted in a sociolin-
guistic aspect but within the theory of discourse, for instance
(Amalbekova, 2013).
State of language of the northern region of Kazakhstan is
characterized by mass Kazakh­Russian and Russian­Kazakh
bilingualism (Zhikeyeva, 2011).According to the authors, state
of language in modern Kazakhstan is the direct reflection of
political, ethnical, demographic, social, and economic changes
in society. Revival of national culture and spirituality is accom-
panied with strengthening the vitality of the state Kazakh lan-
guage as well as support of the vitality of the Russian language
that was acknowledged as the official language in Kazakhstan.
Kazakh and Russian languages mutually function within the
universal communicative space (Suleimenova & Smagulova,
2005). That is, as in other republics of the former USSR, the
language of the title nation was recognized as the state lan-
guage. As a consequence, there is a misbalance between the
official status of languages and the real state of language when
Russian is dominant in all socially important spheres of com-
munication (even in the flow of documents, the share of the
Kazakh language does not exceed 80%).
Ethnical Kazakhs living in the north of Kazakhstan are
mostly bilingual; they speak both Kazakh and Russian,
switching from one language to the other regardless of the
degree of knowledge of these languages. A speaker joins the
language of the interlocutor or answers a question asked in
Russian using Kazakh; a conversation may consist of Kazakh
and Russian phrases. On the example of dialogues of resi-
dents of Kazakhstan, it is possible to research all types and
kinds of language interference. According to the 2009 popu-
lation census, 99% of the entire population of Kostanay
region understand Russian, 96% write fluently in Russian
(1999 Kazakhstan Population Census, 1999).
However, various sociological surveys in which questions
about language skills suggest yes/no replies do not reflect the
objective situation. Ethnical Kazakhs understand a question
of language skills in different ways: Some are satisfied with
the fact of language fluency in everyday situations, others
think that the conversation in common language cannot be
equal to speaking literary language, so the latter do not con-
sider they can speak Kazakh.
Therefore, the current statistical data do not reflect the
real state of language, as they divide respondents into
Kazakh-speaking and Russian-speaking, but in fact, northern
Kazakhs use both languages. In any case, they understand
Russian and Kazakh, and the preference in the choice of the
language in a certain situation gives the idea of the real func-
tioning of the language, including the state one.
In describing state of language in northern Kazakhstan, it
is necessary to note the following. There is no dominance of
Russian in communicative space. Communicative environ-
ment of Kostanay region was formed by the leading Russian
language due to historical reasons: departure of Kazakhs
because of mass famine in the 30s of the 19th century, terri-
torial contacts of Kazakhstan and Russia, migration process
in connection with deportation of peoples in the period of
Stalin repressions, evacuation of Soviet enterprises during
the Great Patriotic War, mass migration of the Russian-
speaking population during cultivation of virgin lands, and
so on. Ethnical Kazakhs comprised numeric minority in
Kostanay region up to the beginning of the 21st century
(according to 1999 census, there were 314,801 Kazakhs and
430,242 Russians). Due to these reasons, nowadays perfor-
mance of the state language functions by Kazakh does not
mean return to the previous state of language (which never
existed) but formation of new communicative functions of
Kazakh as the basic language in communicative space.
Method
It is language functionality, its integration in all social
spheres, which must be the criterion of the status of a lan-
guage in society. Which of the languages a bilingual uses in
everyday communication when buying bread, bringing up
children, working at the enterprise, and passing the time is
the main indicator of multifunctionality of a language.
Akhmetzhanova (2001) claims that the study of bilingualism
of social-demographic groups of informants allows analyz-
ing the dynamics of bilingualism development in Kazakhstan
and making a prognosis about the direction of the process of
mass bilingualism. Following Akhmetzhanova, such groups
were distinguished. The objective of the research was to find
the technique to state the level of the functioning of two lan-
guages in figures. To define the index number of communi-
cative functionality of Kazakh and Russian languages, the
differential technique was used.
The research into state of language with the differential
technique conducted by the author allows stating the domi-
nant language of routine behavior in the situation of bilin-
gualism, defining language preference in social spheres, and
determining the direction of expanding communicative pos-
sibilities of a language. When a bilingual uses either first or
second language, the differential technique defines the coef-
ficient of language preference.
A traditional questionnaire of situation analysis widely
used in sociolinguistics was used in the research method
Mongilyova 3
(Karlinsky, 2009; Kondrashkina, 1995). But when compiling
a questionnaire, we used the scaling technique that was
developed in psychology and linguistics to get quantitative
indicators when evaluating the attitude of test subjects to
various notions, Ch. Osgood's classical differential tech-
nique served as an example. Thus, instead of traditional yes/
no answers for the questionnaire, the scaling technique sug-
gests variants of answers (in this research, from "only
Kazakh" to "only Russian"), which allows minimizing the
level of abstraction in answers and reaching the accuracy of
the experiment. For instance,
In which language do you read application instructions
for household appliances, information about products
composition?
To define distribution of communicative functions
between Kazakh and Russian languages, a number of ques-
tions were worked out that cover various situations of the
use of Kazakh and Russian languages. First of all, we pro-
ceeded from the statement about basic functions of the lan-
guage (communicative and cognitive); therefore, we
formulated questions concerning various situations of
communication and information comprehension. Also,
when making up questions about the choice of the lan-
guage as a means of communication, we imagined a usual
day of an average Kostanay city resident and decided to
simulate situations in which he or she happens to be during
the day. Furthermore, we generalized them according to
the spheres of social communication (work, home, trans-
port, street, etc.).
As the author and research participants (university stu-
dents) live in Kostanay city, we took into consideration the
peculiarities of communicative behavior of Kostanay region
residents. As it was mentioned above, the Russian language
in Kostanay historically has been the basic language of com-
munication in all spheres; that is why ethnical Kazakhs, as a
rule, speak to ethnical Russians in Russian (Kazakhs have
Asian appearance, Russians--Slavic; ethnical identity is
expressed externally). But they will try to speak in Kazakh
to ethnical Kazakhs, especially if a communicant is older.
(During the discussion, Kazakh students spoke about this as
an obligation. There are even cases when they are not sure
that their language skills will allow them to speak in Kazakh,
and in such situations, a young person may even refuse to
talk.) In the Kazakh mentality, respect to the elders and fol-
lowing the traditions are the leading concepts defining rou-
tine behavior. In the situation when it is possible to choose
the language, addressing a person in the native language is a
sign of respect, following the tradition. Therefore, we would
like to find out to what extent Kazakh performs its commu-
nicative functions in situations when Kazakhs consciously
choose Kazakh. Discussing situations for the questionnaire,
we asked students to think when they spoke Kazakh during
the day. As a result of interviewing students, there were
stated questions such as, "In which language do you con-
gratulate your relatives?" "In which language do you listen
to songs?" and others. These questions cover the peculiari-
ties of the Kazakh culture, such as musicality of Kazakh eth-
nos (there is a proverb: A Kazakh is born with a song and
dies with a song), as well as importance of Word in Kazakh
tradition. In the Kazakh culture, there are special words
(bata; Shaymerdenova & Avakova, 2010), words for wish-
ing good things, and in such a ritualized situation of com-
munication variation in the choice of the language is possible
(as distinguished, for example, from the situation of express-
ing condolences when a speaker is obliged to use the lan-
guage of the addressee). Thus, the situation of congratulating
relatives was reflected in the questionnaire.
The sphere of family communication was presented by
the questions concerning communication with parents and
with children. As in the children­parents line, there are laws
of tradition and respect; as it was said before, we wanted to
deduce to what degree communicants follow the same prin-
ciples in relation to their children in their own families or in
communication with younger relatives.
The question concerning communication with colleagues
has a mark "with colleagues of Kazakh nationality" to check
the degree of functionality of Kazakh in business sphere, as
it is obvious that communication with Russian colleagues is
conducted in Russian. The question, "In which language do
you think and express your ideas fluently and naturally?" is
connected with the preference of the language when form-
ing thoughts and constructing new information.
The questionnaire of situation analysis has an introduc-
tion in which there is an address to respondents with specifi-
cation of the purpose of the survey, degree of anonymity,
sociodemographic data about the respondent (gender, age,
native language, place of residence city/village, language of
education).
As a result, the questionnaire of situation analysis is the
following:
1. Which language do you use in communication with
parents?
2. In which language do you speak to your children?
3. Which language do you use in communication with
friends of Kazakh nationality?
4. In which language to you congratulate your
relatives?
5. Which language do you use in professional activity
(at work, study)?
6. In which language do you communicate with col-
leagues of Kazakh nationality?
7. In which language do you watch TV shows?
8. In which language do you read study literature (sci-
entific, connected with profession)?

9. In which language do you watch (listen to) the news?
10. In which language do you read fiction?
11. In which language do you listen to songs?
12. In which language do you read application instruc-
tions for household appliances, information about
foodstuff composition, instructions for drugs?
13. In which language do you speak in public places
(shops, pay-offices, means of transportation, social
services, etc.)?
14. In which language do you read newspapers?
15. In which language do you text messages, chat online,
communicate in social networks?
16. In which language can you express your thoughts
fluently?
17. How you do estimate the degree of your language
skills? Russian: fluent/good, but not fluent/bad/
understand, but cannot speak/do not understand.
Kazakh: fluent/good, but not fluent/bad/understand,
but cannot speak/do not understand.
As it can be seen from the questionnaire, situations can be
generalized according to social spheres:
family communication (with parents, children, friends, in
which language do you congratulate relatives);
business communication (in which language do you com-
municate at work, with colleagues, with colleagues of
Kazakh nationality);
everyday communication (public places); and
ethnocultural communication (congratulating relatives,
choice of the language when listening to songs).
A number of questions defined the function of the Kazakh
language in getting knowledge and new information (infor-
mation at labels, reading books, study textbooks, news,
radio, television, newspapers).
Calculation of results was conducted in the following
way.
The coefficient is calculated by the technique of adding
the indicator of each question and division on the total num-
ber of questions. The total amount of questions is 17, but the
answer to the seventeenth question is studied separately.
That is why the sum of questions indicators is divided by 16.
N is the sum of indicators in the questionnaire, for exam-
ple, n = 3 + (-1) + (-2) + . . ., and so on.
K (coefficient of functionality) = n\16.
The closer K is to 0, the more respondent's bilingualism is
balanced. Symbol "-" or "+" of the total indicator shows
general preference of the language: more Russian if it is +K,
or more Kazakh if it is -K. It is possible to define both the
coefficient of a separate respondent and total preference of
the language in each sphere, in a certain situation.
Analysis of the Experiment Results
About 400 residents of north Kazakhstan (Kostanay city and
its districts) took part in the survey; 162 of them are male and
234 are female. The ages of the participants are as follows:
The total results of the research were predictable in cer-
tain parameters, but some indicators turned out to be surpris-
ing. So the table 1 shows the coefficients of functionality in
the sphere of family communication:
All coefficients are marked with the symbol "-", which
means the choice of Kazakh as the language of communi-
cation. It is worth noting that the sphere of family commu-
nication is the obvious preference of Kazakh, but the
language of communication with parents has a higher indi-
cator than the language of communication with children.
That is, the coefficient of Kazakh of those respondents
who choose Kazakh more often when talking to parents is
3 times less in communication with children (the most fre-
quent answer is "Russian and Kazakh equally"). This ten-
dency was observed in all answers, but in no questionnaire
sheet was the answer to the question about communication
with children higher than in that about communication
with parents (see Table 1). It was the same or lower. Even
the coefficient of functionality of Kazakh in communica-
tion with friends is much higher than that with children.
This confirms the opinion that the use of Kazakh is con-
nected also with respect and following the traditions.
However, it is surprising that respondents do not demand
the same from their children.
Analysis of functionality of the Kazakh and Russian lan-
guages in the sphere of ethnocultural communication showed
the following:
More preference to Kazakh turned out to be in the ques-
tion concerning congratulating relatives (the most frequent
answer, 150 of all respondents answered "only Kazakh" or

"more Kazakh") (see Table 2). Here, the coefficient is almost
twice higher than in the indicator of communication with
parents. It is accounted for by a big value of a word, parting
words (bota) in Kazakh culture, especially pronounced on
celebrations and family gatherings; in such situations, even a
person whose Kazakh is bad tries to prepare a worthy con-
gratulatory speech in Kazakh not to offend the older genera-
tion. Popularity of modern song creativity in Kazakh can be
explained by attachment to ethnocultural traditions, even
though the coefficient is closer to 0, the most popular answer
(210 respondents) was "Kazakh and Russian equally."
The Sphere of Business and Everyday
Communication
The results show that in business and everyday spheres, both
Russian and Kazakh are used with a slight preference of
Russian (see Table 3). In variants of answers, it is expressed
as "more Russian than Kazakh"; the coefficient does not
exceed 1. The fact that, when communicating with Kazakh
colleagues, respondents choose Russian more often is not
favorable for Kazakh. These indicators confirm the sugges-
tion that residents of north Kazakhstan use both Kazakh and
Russian as a means of communication, preferring Russian.
Analysis of Questions About Getting New
Information and Acquiring Knowledge
Nevertheless, Russian gets more preference in situations
connected with the use of language as a means of acquiring
knowledge, new information (see Table 4).
The comparison of coefficients allows stating that Kazakh
speakers perceive aural texts in Kazakh (songs, radio, TV)
better than written ones (books, study literature, newspapers,
magazines, chats). The results demonstrate that when watch-
ing TV shows and the news, they choose both Kazakh and
Russian with the preference of the latter ("more Russian than
Kazakh"). In situations of acquiring information and knowl-
edge through reading, there is an obvious misbalance in
favor of Russian. The role of Russian in information space
may be considered as an implicit mechanism of globalization
of the language; the situation is similar to the expansion of
English in South Korea (Piller & Cho, 2013) and French in
Morocco (Burdero, 2006).
A number of situations were aimed at defining functional
load between languages in forming thoughts and text produc-
tion, where final texts are compiled in Russian, with a slight
preference of Russian in thinking process (see Table5).
Random comparative analysis did not elicit much differ-
ence in gender distinction, place of residence city/village.
However, the decisive factor of increasing multifunctionality
of Kazakh was the language of education.
Influence of the Language of Education
on the Choice of the Language in
Communication
The comparison of the results of answers of respondents edu-
cated in Kazakh and in Russian shows the increase in the
share of Kazakh in all situations (see Table 6).

Besides increase in the share of Kazakh, the analysis of
the results of respondents educated in Kazakh shows the
keeping tendency observed in the grand total: decrease in the
share of Kazakh when communicating with children com-
pared with the coefficient of communication with parents,
and preference of Russian for acquiring new information.
Indicators of the coefficient of professional activity and
communication with colleagues--ethnical Kazakhs are
equal; they are almost the same as the indicator of communi-
cation with friends. If respondents educated in Russian use
more Russian in professional activity (+1.164) with their col-
leagues who are ethnical Kazakhs, they try to speak less
Russian (+0.428), but the coefficients of respondents edu-
cated in Kazakh do not change at all.
Preference to Russian in acquiring knowledge and new
information of respondents educated in Russian is accounted
for the difference between colloquial and standard Kazakh,
so they have difficulties in perceiving scientific texts in
Kazakh. However, the analysis of the results of respondents
educated in Kazakh also indicates preference to Russian,
though to a lesser degree. According to the author, such
results can be explained by the fact that Russian gives more
access to information space in terms of both scientific litera-
ture and fiction. Students educated in Kazakh often say that
they read textbooks in Russian but have to translate into
Kazakh to prepare for lessons.
Influence of Age Differences on the
Distribution of Functions Between
Kazakh and Russian Languages
For this purpose, two groups of respondents were selected:
the younger group and the group of respondents above 36, as
we decided that the latter is more involved in public life than
the group of people above 50 (see Table 7).
Comparative analysis confirms that there is a decrease in
the share of Kazakh in communication of young respon-
dents according to all indicators. The coefficient in com-
municative situations ranges from +0.5 (communication
with parents) to +1.3 (communication in public places),
which shows that using both Russian and Kazakh with pref-
erence to Russian, young people do not see the difference
between situations of communication and use both lan-
guages equally. The difference in indicators of respondents
who are above 36 is much bigger: from -1.4 (communica-
tion with parents) to +2 (communication with colleagues).
The difference in coefficients between "communication
with parents" (-1.4) and "communication with children"
(-0.12) of respondents above 36 is also surprising. Despite
such a tremulous attitude to the native language, while
communicating with their children, respondents do not try
so much to speak Kazakh as they do it while communicat-
ing with their parents. Such indicators indirectly prove
preference to Russian of respondents aged 17 to 25. The
results of the survey of young people are depressing because
they were born in a new state and grew up having obliga-
tory lessons of Kazakh in kindergarten, primary school, and
so on. The results raise questions about the effectiveness of
language policy carried out by the government.
Definition of the Native Language

The results of the answer to the question in the introduction
concerning "native language" arouse a special interest. Of

language. The rest, regardless of the share of Kazakh in their
speech, do not doubt saying that Kazakh is their native lan-
guage. We studied questionnaires of respondents whose indi-
vidual total coefficient is higher than +2 (from +2.13 to
+2.85), which means most of their answers are "only
Russian"; there are 48 of them, and to the exclusion of three
questionnaires, all of them indicate Kazakh as their native
language. The introduction also included the request to esti-
mate language skills in Russian and Kazakh according to the
scale "fluent­good, but not fluent­bad­understand, but can-
not speak­do not understand." So, out of the 48 respondents
indicating Kazakh as their native language, 12 people (25%)
chose "do not understand" Kazakh. On the contrary, of those
who indicated Russian as their native language, 6 people
(40%) chose "do not understand" Kazakh, and their individ-
ual coefficients range from +0.69 to +2.81, that is, the share
of Kazakh is much bigger. These respondents are ethnically
Kazakh and try to use Kazakh, study it, and include it in their
life. It turns out that objective conception of which language
is one's native causes the desire to study the language of your
ethnos.
Such results mean that in the communicative space of
north Kazakhstan, the notion of "native language" needs
deciphering. Indeed, there are several definitions of the con-
cept "native language." It is the name of a language acquired
in infancy by imitating adults (O. S.Akhmanova), a language
that was studied first (U. Weinreich; quoted by Avrorin,
1975). This approach does not clarify anything if we speak
about bilingual communicative space, wherein the family
adults choose either one language code or the other. Avrorin
(1975) thinks that it is necessary to expand the content of the
notion "native language" depending on the degree of lan-
guage skills (pp. 124-148). The language in which the person
or group of people speak fluently and actively in any case of
life should be considered native--if they do not only speak
and understand it but also think in it without using the mental
operation of translation into the other language.
Nevertheless, the results of the research show quite the
contrary situation. The concept of "native language" for resi-
dents of Kazakhstan is directly connected with the ethnical
feature. A respondent with distinctively dominating Russian
indicates Kazakh as the native language as it is the language
of their ethnos. Thereat, none of the respondents hesitated
about the choice of the native language, and no one (!) tried
to indicate both languages. Avrorin notes that a person can
call the language they know well their native language, not
the language they are attracted to (Avrorin, 1975). Also, he
says that if one should proceed from linguistic meaning of
the term native language, a person may have two or three
native languages, and in this situation of bilingualism in
defining the native language, the ethnical feature becomes
decisive. This choice of the respondents is explained by this.
On one hand, a person can only approximately give an
objective estimation of their language skills. The question-
naire offered the scale of answers, but the results concerning
this point are questionable. Respondents (42 people)
answered "do not understand" to the question on the degree
of language skills in Kazakh, but general indicators of the
coefficient are from +0.73 (it is a relatively balanced bilin-
gualism!) to +2.81, and among the answers, there is a variant
"Kazakh and Russian equally" in the questions about the lan-
guage of communication with parents and friends.
Respondents may have answered "do not understand" think-
ing about grammar or its literary variant. In turn, the answers
about language skills in Russian are more objective. There is
a dependence between answers to the question about skills in
Russian and the general coefficient: The answers "bad,"
"understand, but do not speak" always correspond to the "-"

coefficient, that is, there is misbalance in favor of Kazakh
(there are no answers "do not understand" at all).
According to the ethnical feature, respondents sincerely
think that Kazakh is their native language regardless of the
degree of their skills. Most part of Kazakh in answers about
songs and congratulations of relatives proves the attachment
to this language; these situations indirectly reflect the prior-
ity of the language in its expressive function.
Ethnical self-consciousness distinguishes Kazakh as
dominant regardless of communicative indicators. Self-
identity as a part of the ethnos is reflected in respectful atti-
tude to the language. Such a difference of coefficients of
respondents of older and younger generations can be
explained by this. For a young man, ethnical identity is
accounted for by itself, they answer such questions automati-
cally. Conscious comprehension of one's own culture and
following tradition come with age--and along with it, cer-
tain responsibility for their people and language.Aa 17-year-
old respondent is more involved in information space where
Russian and English are dominating. Older respondents (36
and above) prefer Kazakh for communication becouse they
speak Kazakh--it is both respect to the speaker and part of
the ritual, and the way to establish trust with the interlocutor.
An adult understands what in their personality is formed
under the influence of ethnical traditions and which actions
are approved in their culture; all these are expressed in the
use of the language of their ethnos. That is why, those respon-
dents in our research who answered "do not understand"
about the language skills in Kazakh (42 people) aspire to
broaden their knowledge; coefficients show that they often
watch the news, TV shows, and read newspapers in Kazakh.
These are the situations in which those who speak Kazakh
fluently use more Russian.
Summary
Analysis of questionnaires shows that the choice of Kazakh
is made in the direction of middle-aged generation to the
elder generation. Even according to the age criterion, prefer-
ence to Kazakh is given more by respondents who are above
30. Thus, the effectiveness of language policy aimed at
younger generation (increase in lessons of Kazakh at school,
universities, various events, measures of encouragement,
etc.) is questionable.
The research demonstrates that the use of Kazakh by
Kazakh-speaking residents of north Kazakhstan is obliga-
tory and unconditional in situations when respect to the
elders (parents, aksakals) and respect for family traditions
(congratulations of relatives, congratulatory speeches at cel-
ebrations) is concerned. That is, Kazakh speech is also con-
nected with ethnical self-identity and cultural identity.
However, the older a person is, the more definite their plans
for the future are. Connecting their further life with
Kazakhstan, respondents of older generation better under-
stand the necessity to know Kazakh (flow of documents,
requirements at work) and consciously speak more Kazakh
to improve their skills. We may suggest that for ethnical
Russians, who are residents of Kazakhstan in the second,
third, and generations thereafter, it will be possible to use
Kazakh in case they realize their affiliation with Kazakh
culture and the state of Kazakhstan. Propaganda of the
Kazakh language as an inevitable part of the Kazakhstan
nation (not only Kazakh ethnos); knowledge of the language
as a sign of respect for values of a multiethnic state is also a
long-term direction of language policy.
Study of public functions of languages in the situation of
bilingualism allows estimating objectively the state of lan-
guage and defining the extralinguistic factor that determines
this state, which will allow us to reveal the language problem
with its subsequent solution.
The proposed differential technique is also convenient as
the questionnaire may be infinitely specified according to the
types of communication in each sphere, defining the priority
of languages in the informative, expressive, and other func-
tions. For instance, business communication may suggest
many questions; so the point "which language do you use at
work" may be more specified into "communication with the
employer," "communication with employees," "with col-
leagues," "with Russian colleagues," and so on. The neces-
sity of a balanced language policy determines relevance of
such kind of research. In this context, scientific study and
description of the specific character of the northern region of
Kazakhstan become topical.
