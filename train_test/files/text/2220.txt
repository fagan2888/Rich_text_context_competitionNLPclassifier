Background: Few cross-national studies have compared the relationship between socio-economic status (SES) and health among East Asian
countries. This study elucidates the relationship between SES and self-rated health (SRH) in four societies of East Asia: China, Japan, South
Korea and Taiwan. Methods: We used the data from the East Asian Social Survey 2006, which consists of nationally representative samples
from each of the four countries. Logistic regression analysis of SRH was performed using four standardized SES indices (income, education,
occupation and class identification) as explanatory variables to compare the degree of association of each SES index with SRH. Results: A
total of 8120 respondents in the age range of 20­69 years were analysed. Overall, social gradients in health were observed in the East Asian
societies. In China, South Korea and Taiwan, three of the four SES indices showed a statistically significant association for both male and
female groups. In Japan, except class identification, no other SES index showed a significant relationship with SRH. With regard to the
differences between the SES indices, class identification exhibited the strongest association with SRH, while occupational class displayed the
weakest association. Conclusion: Our study results indicate that Japan has low levels of health inequality compared to other East Asian
countries. Furthermore, an index of occupational classes may be insufficient to explain health inequalities in East Asia.

Introduction
Since publication of the `Black Report',1 it has been well established that
a social gradient in health is a common feature of societies in Western
countries.2,3 In addition, many studies have compared among Western
countries4­8 as well as between Western and Asian countries.9 These
studies have shown that the relationship between socio-economic status
(SES) and health varies in strength among countries according to the SES
index that was used in the study.
However, cross-national comparative studies of East Asian countries
are rare, although some have assessed SES and health in individual
countries of the region.10­15 In addition, cross-national studies that
include samples from East Asia--for example, Martikainen et al.9--
often do not use nationally representative samples. To our knowledge,
a data set drawn from a standardized questionnaire that facilitates a
cross-national comparison has so far been limited in East Asia.
Using cross-national surveys, Yamaoka16 investigated the relationship
between SES, social capital at the individual level, and health across Japan,
South Korea, Singapore, five areas in mainland China and Taiwan.
However, as Yamaoka's work focused mainly on general trends in the
relationships between social capital and health, the differences in SES and
health among East Asian countries may need further consideration. For
example, the categorization criteria used for SES indices were unclear,
and this makes it difficult to compare the relationships between SES and
health across these countries.
Moreover, some previous studies question the interchangeability of
SES indices, such as income, education and occupational class, and
have shown that the association between SES and health can vary by
SES indices, health outcomes and countries.17,18 To explore which SES
indices are important for health in East Asian societies, we need appro-
priate data and methods that allow for the comparison among countries
and between SES indices.
This study uses the East Asian Social Survey (EASS) 2006 data set, a
cross-national survey consisting of nationally representative samples from
China, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan. We sought to compare the SES
gradient in health among the four societies using the index of self-rated
health (SRH) and standardized SES indices of income, education,
occupation and class identification.
Methods
Data
Data used in this study are from the EASS 2006 provided by the EASS
Data Archive. The archive provides data from respondents whose
identities are undisclosed, for the secondary analysis of cross-national
comparisons in East Asia. These data consist of a common module, set
into a General Social Survey (GSS) type questionnaire, which is a
nationally representative sample survey from each of the four societies.
Samples were selected by multistage stratified random sampling.
Respondents were surveyed from June to December 2006 by interview
in China, South Korea and Taiwan and by interview and placement
(self-administered) methods in Japan. Valid response rates were 38.5%
in China, 59.8% in Japan, 65.7% in South Korea and 42.0% in Taiwan.
Details for EASS data are described at the EASS website (http://eass.info).
SES and health in East Asia 47
EASS 2006 includes information on income, education, occupation
and class identification, allowing us to compare the validity of the SES
index to analyse the social gradient in health. Given that many studies
have claimed the necessity of using cross-national data but instead have
actually only used limited samples from specific regions or organizations,
the EASS 2006 is considered a valuable data set that consists of represen-
tative samples from four East Asian countries. The target ages of samples
in EASS 2006 were 18­69 in China, 20­89 in Japan, 18 or over in South
Korea and 19 or over in Taiwan. This study used the sample drawn from
20- to 69-year olds, a common age group throughout the four countries.
Accordingly, 8120 samples were included in our analysis.
Dependent variable: SRH
The dependent variable was SRH. Respondents were asked, `How would
you rate your health?' and were prompted to answer on a 5-point scale
from 1 (Very good) to 5 (Very bad). We dichotomized responses into 0
and 1, with 0 representing responses 1 through 3 (`good') and 1 repre-
senting responses 4 and 5 (`poor').
Independent variable: SES index
Our study made use of four items of the SES index: income, education,
occupation as an objective measure and class identification as a subjective
measure. These original variables were recoded and categorized as
follows.
Income
Equivalent income was calculated by dividing household income by the
square root of the number of family members. However, household
incomes in Japan and Taiwan were categorical values (19 and 26
categories, respectively); therefore, we took the median value of each
category for our calculation. The equivalent incomes we calculated
were categorized into four levels (lowest, low, high and highest) by
using one-half of the median equivalent income as a cut-off value in
each country. This follows the criteria that are often used as a
definition of relative poverty.19
Education
Highest education level was used as an indicator of education. The
original variable had six categories: 0 (No formal qualification), 1
(lowest formal qualification), 2 (Above lowest qualification), 3 (Higher
secondary completed), 4 (Above higher secondary level) and 5
(University degree completed). We converted the original six categories
into four (lowest, low, high, highest) by combining categories 0, 1 and 2
into one category. This procedure seemed reasonable, considering that
some countries have few or no applicable cases for the three lower
categories. Particularly, there were no valid cases of 0 (No formal quali-
fication) and 2 (Above lowest qualification) in Japan.
Occupational class
EASS 2006 includes a variable of the 4-digit ISCO-88 by ILO20 as re-
spondents' occupational information. By using this detailed occupational
code, we applied internationally comparable occupational measures,
namely the International Socio-Economic Index of Occupational Status
(ISEI).21,22 On the basis of the ISEI score, all samples from the four
countries were categorized into a quartile (lowest, low, high and
highest), not in each countries but within whole samples.
Class identification
In addition to the aforementioned three objective measures of SES, we
employed a subjective variable of class identification. `Top-bottom
self-placement' on a 10-point scale can be used in Japan, South Korea
and Taiwan and `Class identification' on a 5-point scale is available in
China. The question involving `Top-bottom self-placement' was: `In our
society there are groups which tend to be towards the top and groups
which tend to be towards the bottom. Below is a scale that runs from
bottom to top. Where would you put yourself on this scale?' Available
choices were numerical on a 10-point scale from 1 (lowest) to 10
(highest). The question regarding `Class identification' asked: `In your
opinion, which level do you and your family respectively belong to in
terms of your personal and family socio-economic status? (Choose one in
each column)'. Choices were 1 (Upper level), 2 (Upper middle level),
3 (Middle level), 4 (Lower middle level) and 5 (Lower level). As the class
identification variable for China we used responses to questions about
`Your socio-economic status' rather than `Your family's socio-economic
status'.
We converted the 10-point scale of `Top-bottom self-placement' into a
5-point scale and merged the two highest categories of class identification
because of the smaller number of applicable cases in these groups.
Moreover, we reversed the scale of `Class identification' and merged
the two highest categories. As a result, we obtained four levels (lowest,
low, high and highest) of class identification index for analysis.
Standardized score of SES
In order to make comparisons of magnitude of the association with
different SES indices among different populations (by countries and
gender), we converted each category of the SES to a standardized score
ranging between 0 and 1 according to the proportion of population in
each SES index. This score is used for calculating the Slope Index of
Inequality (SII) or the Relative Index of Inequality (RII) based on the
cumulative proportion of the SES categories and the midpoint of its
range.23 The score represents the mean relative rank of the SES
categories, and it can be considered as a standardized SES index that
enables comparison among different indices.
Models
We performed a logistic regression analysis using SRH as a dependent
variable and each standardized score of SES as an independent variable.
The odds ratio (OR) estimated from the analysis shows the ratio of the
risk to be poor SRH for the top rank (standardized SES score = 1)
compared to that for the bottom rank (standardized SES score = 0).
The lower the OR of the standardized SES score, the steeper the social
gradient in health. In the model 1, each of the four standardized SES
scores was included separately, while in the model 2 all the SES scores
were included simultaneously, for the mutual adjustment. In order to
argue whether there were regional and gender differences in the social
gradient in health, we applied the models using the samples stratified by
the four countries and by gender. Our control variable was age,
categorized at 10-year intervals (20­29, 30­39, 40­49, 50­59 and 60­
69). The basic statistics of variables are shown in table 1.
Results
Table 2 shows the results of logistic regression analysis.
On the whole, the model 1 showed strong associations between SES
and SRH for South Korean males and for Taiwanese males and females.
The associations for Japanese males and females were weak. In the three
countries other than Japan, three of the four SES were statistically sig-
nificant for both gender groups. As for differences in SES indices, class
identification had the strongest relationship to SRH, while occupation
had the weakest association. In regard to gender difference, in many
countries and SES indices, ORs were lower for the male population
than the female population, suggesting the social gradient in health
tends to be steeper for males. However, the differences were not large.
In the analysis of samples from China, all SES indices showed a sig-
nificant relationship with SRH, except for occupation among males and
education among females. Income showed the strongest relationship,
with an OR of 0.23 (95% CI 0.12­0.46) in males and 0.27 (0.16­0.45)
in females. Except for the remarkable relationship between class identifi-
cation and SRH (males: OR = 0.21, 0.09­0.52; females: OR = 0.28, 0.12­
0.64), no other significant relationships were confirmed in Japan in male
and female samples. In South Korean samples, all SES indices except for
occupation exhibited significant relationships. Especially, estimated ORs
48 European Journal of Public Health
in South Korean males were the lowest among the four countries' male
populations, for income (OR = 0.22, 0.08­0.57), occupation (OR = 0.33,
0.11­1.03) and class identification (OR = 0.16, 0.06­0.42). Also, all ORs
of males were lower than for females. In Taiwan, income, education and
class identification showed a similar relationship with SRH as in South
Korea. However, among the eight stratified populations, Taiwanese
females showed the lowest ORs for income (OR = 0.19, 0.09­0.39) and
for class identification (OR = 0.10, 0.04­0.22). Moreover, education
(OR = 0.23, 0.10­0.52) showed the strongest association among the
four countries' female populations.
Table 2 also includes the results of the model 2 in which the four SES
indices were adjusted simultaneously. Only a few indices were significant-
ly related to SRH in each country. Those were income for Chinese males
(OR = 0.31, 0.13­0.71) and females (OR = 0.33, 0.17­0.66), class identifi-
cation for Chinese females (OR = 0.45, 0.24­0.85), Japanese males
(OR = 0.14, 0.04­0.57) and females (OR = 0.13, 0.03­0.63), South
Korean females (OR = 0.17, 0.05­0.54), and Taiwanese males
(OR = 0.14, 0.04­0.46) and females (OR = 0.13, 0.04­0.42).
Discussion
Summary of findings
Findings obtained from our analysis were as follows. Overall, a social
gradient in health is apparent in East Asia. The magnitude of the rela-
tionship with SRH varies in SES indices; class identification was the
strongest, while occupation was the weakest and least clear in many
population groups. As for differences among countries, Japan showed
the weakest relationship between SRH and SES among the four
countries. The differences observed in SES indices and in countries
were common for males and females, although the association between
SES and SRH was somewhat stronger among males.
To date, a social gradient in SRH has been reported from a
cross-national data set that targeted a number of countries--for
example the World Values Survey24,25 or the World Health Survey.26
Considering that previous studies showed the association between SRH
and both income and education across the world, it is not surprising that
the same tendency was observed from EASS 2006. However, since
cross-national surveys like World Values Survey often have difficulties
in the translation of the question and unified survey methods27, it would
be important to accumulate the findings from multiple data sources,
particularly in East Asia, where cross-national data has been of limited
availability. Moreover, we should look carefully at the differences among
countries in the same region. Therefore, our results highlight that the
magnitude of associations between SRH and SES were often varied by the
definitions of SES indices and by countries.
Class identification
Regardless of gender and countries, class identification showed strong
association with SRH, suggesting this index can be highly sensitive to
SRH. In addition to the objective status at the time the survey was
conducted, class identification may also reflect more complex elements,
such as SES of the respondent's parents or anxiety about future
uncertainties.
Since both class identification and SRH can be regarded as subjective
indices, there is a possibility of reverse causation; that is, poor SRH of the
respondents may cause lower ratings for their class identification. In
addition, the variable we used in this study was not ideal. For
cross-national comparison, it must be noted that the original question
and scale used in China differed from that used for other countries, and
that the question inquiring about respondents' subjective identification
may be affected by the translation. Although we are aware that creating
one variable from two similar but originally different questions may be
problematic, this was the last expedient for considering subjective
measure in our analysis.
At any rate, the results imply that each objective index alone is
inadequate for constituting the dimensions of SES. Wilkinson28,29 has

SES and health in East Asia 49
documented a psycho-social process through which people lower on the
social ladder reduce their health by comparing themselves with higher
social classes. Class identification, as a subjective index of SES, can be
considered to be a measurement that reflects the psycho-social process
better than other objective indices such as income or education.
Occupational classifications
As typified by the `Black Report' in the UK, occupational class often has
been used in studies as a standard for social gradients in health because it
accurately reflects social classes in Western societies. However, in the
present study the relationship between occupational class and SRH was
unclear and showed a moderate gradient compared to other SES indices.
Although it is possible that the result might be caused by a validity of the
scoring procedure of ISEI, the result was basically the same when we used
other classifications (the results are not shown).
Another possible explanation may be that occupational classifications
do not fully reflect social classes in an East Asian context. `Occupation' as
referred to here indicates, `what they do at work' and is generally
understood as the division between white-collar/blue-collar or manual/
non-manual labour. However, factors other than occupation might be
important for reflecting East Asian social classes, especially compared to
Western societies, because company size, position at work, employment
period or types of job contract may affect workers' income, job security,
benefits and social security. Arita30 made cross-national comparisons of
occupation and social stratification in Japan, South Korea and Taiwan
based on data surveyed in 2005. He discovered that employment status as
well as the size and type of company are as important as occupation for
understanding social stratification in East Asia. For the status and identity
of workers, `which company they belong to' might be more important
than `what they do at work.'
Japan
Compared with samples from the other three countries, the social
gradient in SRH was moderate in Japan, except for the case of class
identification. Several possibilities might account for this.
One possible explanation, at least from a comparative perspective, may
be that social inequalities and their influence on health in Japan have
remained low. In the past, Japan has been regarded as an egalitarian
country that has achieved the world's highest standards in longevity.
According to Kagamimori et al.,15 who reviewed previous studies
regarding SES and health in Japan, socio-economic differences in
mortality, morbidity and risk factors are not uniformly small in Japan,
but they do occur to a smaller degree than in the US or Europe. Results of
our study indicate that Japan exhibits relatively small health inequalities,
not only in comparison with the US and Europe but also among East
Asian countries.
However, it must be noted that the response preference to SRH may
vary between countries. It is believed that the Japanese generally prefer to

give a midpoint or close-to-the-middle response rather than express
definite agreement or disagreement.31 The wording of the response
categories from `Very good' to `Very bad' with the qualifier `very'
might have biased the response toward the midpoint especially for
Japanese respondents.
In fact, table 1 shows that SRH was the `best' in Japan, however if we
used a different cut-off point (only responses 1 and 2 representing
`good'), Japan would be the `worst' because of the larger share of
response 3 (midpoint). The weakest association of SRH and SES in
Japan was the same; even if we used a different cut-off point (the result
is not shown). Therefore, the Japanese response preference might explain
both the `best' SRH status and its weakest association with SES.
However, considering the observed strong association in class identi-
fication, this response preference alone is not convincing enough to
explain the results. We need further research on the effect of response
scale for an analysis of SRH, especially in cross-national comparison.
Limitations
Low response rate, especially in China and Taiwan, was a limitation of
this study, although the age distribution of the respondents was very
similar to that of the national population in China and Taiwan (the
difference was up to the 3.1 percentage point at 10 years intervals of
age). In general, it can be considered that the samples with low SES
may tend to have a lower response rate, thus causing the SES gradient
in health to be underestimated. However, this tendency cannot explain
why Japan exhibits the weakest association, because the response rate in
Japan was relatively high among the four countries.
Another limitation in the present study may be that the target
population for analysis was limited to 20- to -69-year olds. The older
people might exhibit a different pattern in the relationship between SRH
and SES (cf. Nakaya and Dorling32), and the country differences in life
expectancy may also influence the result. This needs to be assessed in the
future by using the upcoming EASS data set.

Key points
 Although a social gradient in health has been well-studied in
Western societies, little is known about how it varies between
countries and SES indices in the current East Asian context.
 From the EASS 2006, which is a cross-national comparative data
set, it is evident that Japan has relatively low levels of health
inequality compared to China, South Korea and Taiwan.
 Using standardized SES indices, this study revealed that occupa-
tional class has the weakest relationship with SRH as compared to
income, education and class identification, suggesting that an
index of occupational classes may be insufficient to explain
health inequalities in East Asia.

Background: Positive health is likely a buffer against physical and mental illness. Positive health may explain some of the health benefits
associated with increasing cardiorespiratory fitness and decreasing fatness in youth. We examined the association of cardiorespiratory fitness
and fatness with positive health indicators in 684 (365 boys and 319 girls) Spanish children aged 6­17.9 years. Methods: Positive health
indicators were self-reported using items of the Health Behavior in School-aged Children questionnaire. The study health indicators were:
perceived health status, life satisfaction, quality of family relationships, quality of peer relationships and academic performance. Weight and
height were measured and body mass index was computed. We also measured triceps and calf skinfolds thickness and body fat percentage
was estimated. Cardiorespiratory fitness was measured by the 20 m shuttle-run test. Results: Cardiorespiratory fitness was positively
associated with life satisfaction in children and adolescents. Fatness was inversely associated with perceived health status in children and
adolescents, whereas fatness was inversely associated with life satisfaction, quality of family relationships and academic performance only in
children. Conclusion: These findings suggest a link between cardiorespiratory fitness and fatness and positive health indicators, suggesting
that improving both fitness and fatness could exert a favourable effect on positive health during childhood and adolescence.

Introduction
Positive health is a multifactor construct that describes a state beyond
the mere absence of disease. Positive health-related constructs include
life satisfaction, social relationships, self-esteem, vigour, self-image and
physical health status. Several studies suggested that positive health
alleviates depression,1 promotes better relationships,2 produces higher
self-esteem,3 acts as preventive against of the common influenza,4
protects against cardiovascular events5 and is a predictor of mortality.6
The use of positive health indicators as an additional outcome measure in
medical research has increased during past years. Assessment of positive
health is typically based on reports and they can provide valid informa-
tion about patient's experience that complements clinical measures.
Cardiorespiratory fitness is a direct indicator of individual's physio-
logical status and reflects the overall capacity of the cardiovascular and
respiratory system.7 Findings from cross-sectional studies showed that
children and adolescents with high levels of cardiorespiratory fitness
have also a more favourable cardiovascular profile compared with their
unfit counterparts.8 Likewise, low levels of cardiorespiratory fitness
during childhood and adolescence seems associated with later cardiovas-
cular risk factors such as hyperlipidaemia, hypertension and obesity.8,9
Paediatric obesity is nowadays an important public health threat.
Paediatric overweight/obesity is strongly associated with adult
overweight.10 Adults who were overweight in childhood have higher
levels of blood lipids and lipoproteins (i.e. dyslipidemia), blood
pressure (i.e. hypertension) and fasting insulin levels (i.e. type 2
diabetes), and thus are at increased risk for cardiovascular disease
compared with adults who were thin as children.9
Studies examining the relationship between positive health and cardio-
respiratory fitness in children and adolescents are scarce and are mainly
focused on self-esteem,11,12 and academic performance.13­15 There are,
however, more studies examining the association between positive health
and obesity in children and adolescents, yet the results are inconclu-
sive.16­19 More research is needed before a determination of whether,
and to what extent, positive health may be responsible for some of the
health benefits associated with increasing cardiorespiratory fitness and
decreasing fatness.
The aim of the present study was to examine the associations of car-
diorespiratory fitness and fatness with positive health indicators in
Spanish children and adolescents.
Methods
Subjects
A sample of 684 (365 boys and 319 girls) healthy Caucasian children and
adolescents (6­17.9 years age) participated in the study. The sample was
randomly selected using a two phases, proportional cluster sampling
using as a reference the database of the census of the province of Ca
´diz
(Spain). In the first phase, the school was selected from the stratum. The
different strata were selected according to the geographical localization,
