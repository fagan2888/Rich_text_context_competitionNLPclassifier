The number of books in the home is a powerful indicator of
future success in school (Evans, Kelly, Sfkora, & Trefman,
2010; Feitelson et al., 1986; Moerk, 1985; Robbins & Ehri,
1994). In fact, it is so powerful that the National Assessment
of Educational Progress has used this number to define
socio-economic status rather than the traditional measure of
how many students qualify for free and reduced lunch, based
on evidence collected by Evans et al. (2010). "The 2012
NAEP student background questionnaire also includes items
yielding data that could be understood as reflecting family
income: books in the home, encyclopedia in the home, maga-
zines in the home, computers in the home" (Hauser et al.,
2012, p. 18).
According to a 20-year study by Mariah Evans (2010),
University of Nevada, the number of books in the home pre-
dicted the level of education of a child more accurately than
did the educational level of the parents. (Evans, Kelly,
Sfkora, & Trefman, 2010). In addition, the study found that
"children of lesser educated parents benefited the most from
having books in the home" (University of Nevada, Reno,
2010, p. 1). Students with books in the home tended to aver-
age 3 years longer attendance in school. "While the ideal
home library size was 500 books, students with as few as
twenty books showed a marked increase in reading achieve-
ment" (Conyers, 2012, p. 222). With only 20 books in the
home, a child reached a higher level of education.According
to the Evans (2010) study, with each new book added, the
child gained academically.
The Imagination Library's (IL) purpose is to increase the
number of books in the home while also increasing the
amount of time that children are exposed to quality books.As
a function of assessing the success of this effort, a survey was
sent to the parents of those students receiving IL books in the
mail each month.
The participants being investigated in this study are
drawn from 1,129 registered families who have received
books monthly for the past 26 months. The age-appropriate
titles are chosen by the IL based on multicultural stories,
award-winning literature, and artwork. Both predictable text
and non-predictable text are chosen for the book lists along
with a variety of narrative and expository text. The books
are selected by a group of preschool educators who have
years of experience with children's literature (http://usa.

Improving Family Literacy Practices

Abstract
A 10-question Likert-type scale survey was presented to parents of children enrolled in the Imagination Library's (IL)
program. IL sends age-appropriate books once a month to children from birth to age 5 so that their parent can read to
them. After registering for the program and receiving books, 93 parents answered the survey questions electronically. The
questions noted the difference in family literacy behavior after receiving the books. Nine of the questions were multiple-
choice whereas the last question was open-ended. This third-year survey was compared with the earlier surveys to establish
reliability and used repeated questions to establish validity. The respondents were drawn from a rural minority population
in an economically depressed area. The survey results suggested that parents spend more time reading to their children
regularly after enrolling in the program. The percentage of parents who read to their children more than once a day rose
from 24% to 43%. According to the survey, 48% of parents reported that their child was much more interested in reading.
More than half of the parents (67%) reported that their child asked more frequently for books to be read to them after
enrolling in the program. In addition, 68% of the families reported that multiple members of the family were engaged with
the reading activities. Families report that reading the books had been a positive experience for their children and had helped
70% with vocabulary development and 66% with listening skills.

for 26 months, they have accumulated a library of 26 books
so they can choose favorites to reread.
A Review of the Literature
A tremendous vocabulary gap exists in students beginning
Kindergarten. School-age students from third grade to sixth
generally add new word meanings at about the same rate
across vocabulary levels according to Biemiller and Slonim's
study (2001). The problem is the huge gap in vocabulary lev-
els with beginning Kindergarteners. "In the preliterate
period, children come to differ by several thousand root-
word meanings. This is a gap that is too often not closed in
later years. Hence, we must find ways of supporting vocabu-
lary acquisition during the preliterate period" (Biemiller,
2006, p. 42).
By listening to stories, young children develop an under-
standing of decontextualized vocabulary, which is composed
of words that express ideas other than the here-and-now.
Young children develop new vocabulary by inferring word
meanings from the context of the story. Storybook language
is often more formal than spoken language and offers a word
choice variety that might not be found in day-to-day speech
patterns. "A strong relationship has been found between
experience with books during early years and language
development" (Schickedanz, 1999, p. 44). After listening to
stories regularly, children develop story sense, or the under-
standing of the organization of narrative discourse. They
learn that stories have a problem and a solution with a begin-
ning, middle, and end. With exposure to stories, children
understand what format to expect. Therefore, they are able to
devote their attention to the story and they are able to antici-
pate and predict the story sequence automatically. Experience
with stories builds background knowledge and helps chil-
dren to sort new information into similar groupings. "This
helps children recall information, access it, and connect it to
incoming information. Stein and Glenn (1979) found that
well-read-to children internalized a form of story grammar
which aided in understanding and retelling simple stories"
(Neuman, 2006, p. 32).
Reading to young children provides more benefit than just
developing vocabulary. Phonological awareness is also devel-
oped from listening to stories. The child becomes aware of
different sounds of the language and matches them to letters.
Story books offer linguistic games, rhymes, and jingles to help
children become aware of letters and words. According to the
study of 1,171 first graders and their parents from 19 schools
in Rogaland County, Norway, a significant difference in school
achievement was attributed to reading to children before they
attended school. This study found that the parents' own moti-
vations to read also influenced the child's reading skills. A
book in the hands of the parents advertises the value of read-
ing. The Norwegian study concluded that home reading envi-
ronment is crucial for developing children's reading skills
(The University of Stavanger, 2015).
If children arrived at Kindergarten ready to read, with
well-developed print concepts and book handling skills,
would this help them launch into a successful journey with
literacy? If they have parents who value literacy and actively
engage in reading regularly, would this factor influence their
school success? For years, researchers suggested that these
factors play an important role in literacy development (Elley,
1989; Feitelson et al., 1986).
According to the national 2012 Scholastic survey, about
half of parents feel their children do not spend enough time
reading books for fun. The IL books encourage families to
spend more time reading books for entertainment. With the
purpose of supporting emergent reading skills, it sends free
books in the mail to families who register to be a part of the
program. "Over the last 10 years, the IL grew from one
small county in east Tennessee to being supported locally
in almost 2,000 communities in three countries" (http://
usa.imaginationlibrary.com/program_replication.php#.
UaUG7thjGrk).
Population
The Southwest New Mexico area served by this project is
rural, with 7.4 people per square mile having an average per-
capita annual income of US$21,726. Sixty percent of the
population is below the poverty level, and 48.3% identify
themselves as having Latino origins. Therefore, rural pov-
erty is the pervasive element of this minority population,
with 6% of the population composed of children under the
age of 5. This population has been receptive to free books
which arrive in the mail, and which can be shared with small
children. Over two thirds of the homes with preschoolers
have received more than 13,500 books during the past 26
months.
Purpose of the Program and the Study
This question emerged during the assessment of the pro-
gram: Would receiving books in the mail increase the time
parents report reading to young children? To answer this
question and to measure the effectiveness of the program,
a 10-question Parent Satisfaction Survey was emailed to
333 of the 1,129 book recipients. The survey is attached as
Table 1. This third-year survey was compared with the ear-
lier surveys to establish validity and reliability. Ninety-
three participants responded, which represents a 20%
return rate. The survey questioned the change in family
literacy practices as a result of the availability of conve-
nient picture books at no expense to the parents. These spe-
cific questions were asked: How often did you read to your
child before and after receiving books from IL? Since
receiving books from IL, how often does your child ask to
be read to? Has receiving books from the IL made your
child more interested in books? What impact has participa-
tion in the IL had on your child? Are other members of the

Q10: Are there other comments you would like to share
about the Imagination Library program? (You may be anony-
mously quoted in our communications with the press and
others). Here are some sample responses: 1. Thank you for
the program. 2. This is a great program, I just wished it was
available in more areas. I tried to recommend it to a friend in
Idaho, but they couldnot get them there because there was no
sponsor. 3. This is a fantastic program. My daughter looks
forward to the book in the mail each month.
Materials and Procedures
The Likert-type scale method used in this study is a familiar
instrument used to measure responses. It facilitates data
coding and analysis (Li, 2012). This Likert-type scale sur-
vey was written by the local ILAdvisory Board, which con-
sisted of professors of education, administrators, and
parents. The survey was based on a time-tested template,
used nationally by the IL, which originated in the National
Center for Education Statistics about reading frequency and
behavior. The research center purports "that based on aca-
demic literature, the best way to assess family reading
behavior is through surveying parents" (Ridzi, Sylvia, &
Singh, 2011, p. 2).
Open coding and theme-based concept style was used to
analyze the data. A qualified survey was used which analyzes
frequencies in the number of characteristics in a population;
the open-ended comments question used coding suggested
by Jansen (2010).
This survey was sent to 333 parents (25% of 1,325 book
recipients). A 27% response rate with an n = 93 was pro-
duced. The survey was sent to email addresses that were pro-
vided using MailChimp and SurveyMonkey and the
Dollywood Foundation's secure database. All book recipi-
ents were invited to participate in the survey. This is the third
annual survey, so ineffective questions have been removed
and new questions have been added. Trends in the annual
survey responses suggest that the survey is valid and reliable.
A reliability of r = .91 was established from surveys taken
over a 3-year period. Validity from repeated questions on the
survey was r = .87.
Nine survey questions had multiple-choice responses.
The Likert-type scale was used to report these responses. The
median was used for analyzing the data from the Likert-type
scale (McLeod, 2008). A number was assigned to each
response and this number was multiplied by the frequency of
responses to arrive at a weighted score for each answer. An
average of the weighted scores was arrived at by dividing the
total weighted score by the number of responses. This num-
ber was used to decide the common factor most respondents
reported. The descriptive percentage of each response was
also reported.

A comment section was added where parents could men-
tion additional information concerning the question. These
responses were coded into five categories (Jansen, 2010).
First, they were divided into positive and negative com-
ments. The positive responses were subsequently sorted into
topics: Multiple children benefited from the books, bonding
occurred within the family, titles were interesting, and infants
were included in literacy time.
Limitations of the Study
The study was limited to self-reporting of the time parents
spent reading to their children. The danger in self-reporting
surveys is the tendency to overinflate responses. A compari-
son group of self-reporting parents who did not participate in
the program was not acquired. In addition, the parents who
had limited access to computers may not have been able to
respond electronically to the survey and their responses were
not recorded.
Results
The Likert-type scale analysis of Question 1, "How often did
you read to your child before receiving books from the IL?"
revealed that before entering the program, the average family
read to their child only 3 or 4 times a week (M = 3.4). A quar-
ter (24%) of the parents read to their child once a day while
another quarter read more than once a day. Those parents
reading "not at all" to their child was 4%.
After entering the program, the average family read to
their child once a day (M = 4.21) according to the results of
Question 2: "How often did you read to your child after
receiving books from the IL?" The number of parents who
read more than once a day increased from 24% to 43% and
the parents who read not at all shrank from 2% to 0.
By interpreting the results of Questions 1 and 2, a marked
change in family literacy behavior is noted. These results
were consistent with the previous year's survey results,
which reported that daily reading rose from 46% to 78%,
while the parents who seldom read to their children dropped
from 9.3 to 0. In both years, the percentage of parents who
read more than once a day almost doubled. The value of this
change in behavior is validated by the National Association
for the Education of Young Children which advises that chil-
dren be read to every day for 20 min. By the age of 5, the
child will have listened to stories for 600 hr. This activity
arms children with a vocabulary and a depth of background
knowledge that prepares them for success in school.
The average family reported that their child asked to be
read to more often after entering the program, according to
the results of the Likert-type scale analysis of Question 3 (M
= 2.63): "Since you enrolled in the program, how often does
your child ask to be read to?" This question demonstrates the
connection between the exposure to books and the motiva-
tion for reading them. The bonding that occurs during
read-aloud time makes reading a comforting experience. The
survey suggests that more than 67% of the children were
motivated to request the reading experience since they have
been enrolled in the program. Other school-related benefits
are derived from motivation to read. Children understand
reading, have developed concepts of print, and can quiet
themselves and direct their attention to listen to a story.
An increased interest in reading books was also recorded
by Question 4: "Has receiving books from the IL made your
child more interested in books?" The results of the Likert-
type scale analysis (M = 1.1) demonstrated that most families
reported that their child was more interested in reading after
entering the program. Almost half (47%) of children were
reported to have more interest in reading. Both Questions 4
and 5 "What impact has participation in the IL had on your
children?" focus on the motivation to read and the bonding
process. Both responses show that family time spent sharing
books had a positive impact on the family.
Question 6, "Are other members of the family benefiting
from having IL books in the home?" asked about the number
of family members who read the IL books. The construct
which determined this question was the cost-effectiveness of
the resources expended. As many as 67% of the families
reported that more than one person in the household bene-
fited from the program, according to the results of the Likert-
type scale analysis (M = 2.65). Often, more than one member
of the family received books, and this doubled the exposure
by the number of books read to the child. Open-ended
responses show that older children enjoyed receiving books
in the mail so that they could read to the younger children.
Fathers also spent more time reading to the kids.
The number of library visits is also a measure of reading
motivation. Ten percent of the families used the library once
a week. Responses to Question 7, "Do you and your child
check out books from the library?" revealed that the percent-
age of children attending the local public library remained
steady at around 46%. Those families who never used the
library remained at 52%. Living in a remote part of New
Mexico does not lend itself to frequent public library use.
This fact underscores the value of having a new book arrive
in the mail once a month.
Question 8, "What differences have you noticed in your
child who is participating in the IL?" measured the parent's
perceptions of improvement from using the IL books. The
design of this question measured the effect of reading to chil-
dren on the executive function of the brain that has been
shown to improve with parent­child interaction (Center on
the Developing Child at Harvard University, 2011). The
development of the executive function determines the ability
to avoid distractions, control impulse, and handle multiple
tasks at the same time. The three distinctive aspects are
working memory, inhibitory control, and cognitive or mental
flexibility.
Seventy percent of the parents noticed increased vocabu-
lary skills exhibited by their child. Thirty-seven percent of
6 SAGE Open
the parents believed that their child had improved in social
skills from having experienced the books while 67% of the
parents had noticed an increase in their child's listening
skills. Only 9% of the parents noticed no difference in their
child's development.
Electronic books (eBooks) were the focus of Question 9:
"What electronic devices does your child use to read?"
EBooks are defined as books viewed on a screen that turn
pages and might have interactive features such as read-
alouds or dictionaries which search for word meanings. Half
of the students used eBooks in the form of iPads (20%),
Kindles (7%), and the Smart phone (8%). Results correspond
with the recent Scholastic survey on eBook use which reports
that 47% of preschoolers have been exposed to eBooks
(Scholastic, 2012). Parents responded that they had more
than 10 titles on these devices and they used this list of pro-
grams: Leap Pad and Leap Frog, Tag Reader with Tag Reader
Junior, Nabi, Inno tab, and the Android tablet with Kindle
applications. As IL books are paper and not electronic, the
changing reading interests of the parents and children were a
concern.
The last survey Question 10, "Are there other comments
you would like to share about the IL program?" was open-
ended and the responses were coded into major themes. First,
they were sorted into positive and negative answers. Forty-
five of the 46 responses noted a positive reaction to the pro-
gram. The only negative response was that one title was
repeated. Typical examples of the positive comments were as
follows: "Reading to my children on a daily basis has made
me more aware of their intellectual growth. It's as important
to us as eating a sit-down meal with the family."
These major themes emerged from the responses:
·
· Twenty-nine people noted the high quality of the
books and the interesting book choices. "These are
delightful books we wouldn't have thought to choose."
·
· Getting the books in the mail was an exciting event
according to sixteen parents. "It allows them to asso-
ciate literacy with the thrill of receiving something
with their name on it in the mail."
·
· Nine responses suggested an increase of family bond-
ing after reading the books together. "We read the
books when they come in the mail instead of watching
TV." "It gives me a reason to spend more quality time
with my child."
·
· Intellectual developments as a result of IL were noted
in seven comments: "A world of imagination was
opened to the child." "The IL is an amazing initiative
to help develop our kid's intellectual, social, and
speech skills."
·
· According to four written responses, multiple people
in the household benefited from the books. "My older
child (6) likes to read the books to her little brother so
it is a great experience for both of them with interac-
tion that promotes development."
·
· Infants are included in literacy time according to three
respondents. "My child is not able to talk, but she does
grab for books."
Conclusions and Recommendations
The survey results suggest that families are spending more
time reading to children, and relationships between and
among family members are changing. The parents who read
more than once a day rose from 24% to 43%. The number of
parents who never read to their children shrank from 2.0% to
0. Fathers and older siblings participated in reading stories to
younger children. As one respondent wrote, "Her father
spends more time with her reading." Reading at home became
routine in the families who receive books monthly. Electronic
books were available in the homes of about half of the fami-
lies that were polled. This number corresponded to the use of
eBooks nationally according to the 2012 Scholastic Survey.
The purpose of the IL program is to nurture emergent
readers and provide them with reading choices that they
might not otherwise encounter. The survey reports validate
that the goals of the Southwest IL program have been met
and that the literacy behavior of the families has experienced
a positive change. Furthermore, this change has resulted in
improved reading scores in the early grades and higher pass
rates on the end of year competency scales. This data will be
used to persuade legislatures that the program is worthy of
state-wide replication at the low cost of US$2.10 per book.
As the heavy lifting of administering the program, publish-
ing, and mailing the books is assumed by the Dollywood
Foundation, a great service is rendered to the parents and
children of the state at minimal cost.
