Abstract
FORD, EARL S., ALI H. MOKDAD, AND WAYNE H.
GILES. Trends in waist circumference among U.S. adults.
Obes Res. 2003;11:1223-1231.
Objective: Waist circumference has been proposed as a
measure of obesity or as an adjunct to other anthropometric
measures to determine obesity. Our objective was to exam-
ine temporal trends in waist circumference among adults in
the U.S.
Research Methods and Procedures: We used data from
15,454 participants 20 years old in National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) III (1988 to
1994) and 4024 participants 20 years old from National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1999 to 2000.
Results: The unadjusted waist circumference increased
from 95.3 (age-adjusted, 96.0 cm) to 98.6 (age-adjusted,
98.9 cm) cm among men and from 88.7 (age-adjusted 88.9
cm) to 92.2 (age-adjusted 92.1 cm) cm among women. The
percentiles from the two surveys suggest that much of the
waist circumference distribution has shifted. Statistically
significant increases occurred among all age groups and
racial or ethnic groups except men 30 to 59 years old,
women 40 to 59 and 70 years old, and women who were
Mexican American or of "other" race or ethnicity.
Discussion: These results demonstrate the rapid increase in
obesity, especially abdominal obesity, among U.S. adults.
Unless measures are taken to slow the increase in or reverse
the course of the obesity epidemic, the burden of obesity-
associated morbidity and mortality in the U.S. can be ex-
pected to increase substantially in future years.

Introduction
The epidemic of obesity, defined using BMI, that has
swept through the U.S. during the past 2 decades has been
well documented (1,2). BMI provides a measure of overall
adiposity, but the distribution of adipose tissue in predicting
health risks associated with obesity is also important. Ab-
dominal fat deposition is generally considered to be a key
component of obesity (3). Waist circumference is a conve-
nient way of measuring abdominal fat deposition and may
be an equally or more useful measure of obesity than BMI
is for several reasons. First, waist circumference is associ-
ated as strongly or more strongly with risk factors for
cardiovascular disease (4­7) and is as good or better pre-
dictor of future risk of the metabolic syndrome, type 2
diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and all-cause mortality (8­
11). Second, waist circumference provides information
about health risks--such as diabetes, hypertension, and
dyslipidemias--in addition to BMI (12). Third, waist cir-
cumference may be a better predictor of medical care costs
than BMI (13). Fourth, waist circumference is conceptually
easy to measure, although it does require some training and
standardization (14). Fifth, the public may understand waist
circumference more easily than BMI. Finally, measure-
ments of waist circumference are needed to diagnose the
metabolic syndrome (15). Recognizing the importance of
waist circumference, the NIH recommended in 1998 that
waist circumference be measured, especially in people
with a BMI of 25 to 34.9 kg/m2 (16).
Waist circumference data for National Health and Nutri-
tion Examination Survey (NHANES)1 III have been de-
scribed for participants 17 years old (17). In this analysis,
we provide additional detail about the distribution of waist
circumference in NHANES III and examine changes in
waist circumference among U.S. adults from 1988 to 1994
through 1999 to 2000.

Research Methods and Procedures
We used data from two cross-sectional surveys of the
U.S. population in this analysis.
NHANES III (1988 to 1994)
NHANES III was conducted from 1988 through 1994
(18,19). Participants were selected using a multistage, strat-
ified sampling design and are considered representative of
the civilian, noninstitutionalized U.S. population. Persons
60 years old, African Americans, and Mexican Americans
were over-sampled. After an interview in the home, partic-
ipants were invited to attend one of three examination
sessions in the mobile examination center: morning, after-
noon, or evening. Body measurements were performed us-
ing standardized methods and equipment. The waist circum-
ference was measured with a steel measuring tape to the
nearest 0.1 cm at the high point of the iliac crest at minimal
respiration (19). BMI was calculated from measured weight
and height. Weight was measured on a Toledo self-zeroing
weight scale. Participants wore underwear, disposable paper
gowns, paper pants, and foam rubber slippers. Height was
measured with a stadiometer to the nearest millimeter.
NHANES (1999 to 2000)
In 1999, NHANES became a continuously operating sur-
vey (20). We used data obtained during 1999 to 2000. A
representative sample of the civilian, noninstitutionalized
U.S. population was selected using a stratified multistage
sampling design. Persons with low income, persons 60
years old, African Americans, and Mexican Americans were
over-sampled. Using a computer-assisted personal interview
system, trained interviewers talked with participants at home.
Participants were asked to attend the mobile examination cen-
ter, where they completed additional questionnaires, under-
went various examinations, and provided a blood sample.
Using standardized methods and equipment, body measure-
ments were performed similarly to those in NHANES III (21).

Covariates
Other variables included in the analyses were age, sex,
and race or ethnicity (white, African American, Mexican
American, and other).
Data Analysis
Analyses were limited to participants 20 years old.
Pregnant women were excluded. "High-risk" waist circum-
ference was defined as a waist circumference of 102 cm in
men and 88 cm in women (16). Differences in estimates
between the two surveys were tested by dividing the differ-
ence in the means or proportions by the pooled SE of the
two estimates, which was calculated as the square root of
the sum of the squares of the two SEs. Analyses were done
by using Software for the Statistical Analysis of Correlated
Data to obtain proper variance estimates for the complex
sampling design (22). Sampling weights were used to cor-
rect for the over-sampling in the surveys. Pearson correla-
tion coefficients between waist circumference and BMI
were calculated by using SAS software (SAS Institute,
Cary, NC) and the examination sampling weight.
Results
Among participants who attended the mobile examina-
tion center, 15,454 of 16,285 participants in NHANES III
and 4024 of 4185 in NHANES 1999 to 2000 had a waist
circumference measurement. The waist circumference per-
centiles for both surveys are shown in Tables 1 and 2. The
median circumference increased from 94.4 to 97.1 cm
among men and from 86.6 to 90.3 cm among women. The
percentiles suggest that much of the waist circumference
distribution has shifted.
Between the two surveys, the age-adjusted mean waist
circumference increased by 3.0 cm among men and 3.2 cm
among women (Table 3). Among men, an increase occurred
among all demographic subgroups but was of borderline
significance among men 30 to 59 years old. The greatest

increase occurred among men 20 to 29 years old. Among
women, an increase occurred among all demographic
groups but was not significant among women 40 to 59 or
70 years old, Mexican-American women, or women of
other race or ethnicity. Women 20 to 29 years old showed
the largest increase in waist circumference.
The prevalence of a "high-risk" waist circumference
(102 cm in men and 88 cm in women) increased be-
tween the two surveys in all subgroups except Mexican-
American women (Table 4). The increase was not signifi-
cant among men 40 to 69 years old, men of other race or
ethnicity, women 40 years old, and women of other race
or ethnicity. Among both men and women, the greatest
increases in waist circumference occurred among those 20
to 39 years old.
Among all participants, significant increases in mean
waist circumference and percentage high-risk waist cir-
cumference occurred among all educational groups and

smoking groups (Table 5). Among male participants who
were current smokers, neither the increase in mean waist
circumference nor the increase in the percentage with a
high-risk waist circumference was statistically signifi-
cant. The increase in mean waist circumference among
women with 12 years of education and the increase in
the percentage of women with 12 years of education who
had a high-risk waist circumference were not significant.
Pearson correlation coefficients between waist circumfer-
ence and BMI were high in both surveys, and the magnitude
of the correlation coefficients increased slightly between the
two surveys (Table 6). In NHANES III, the correlation
coefficients ranged from 0.88 to 0.93 among men and from
0.86 to 0.92 among women. In NHANES 1999 to 2000, the
correlation coefficients ranged from 0.91 to 0.94 among
men and from 0.88 to 0.94 among women.

To examine whether the increase in waist circumference
reflected a general increase in body weight rather than a
specific increase in abdominal adiposity, we examined the
change in mean waist circumference and prevalence of
high-risk waist circumference by three categories of BMI
(Table 7). Only among obese participants was the increase
in the prevalence of high-risk waist circumference significant.
However, the median BMI for the three categories of BMI
increased over time, complicating the interpretation of the data.
Discussion
We have described the distribution of waist circumfer-
ence among U.S. adults in two national surveys and the
changes that occurred between 1988 to 1994 and 1999 to
2000. As the epidemic of obesity increases unabatedly,
not surprisingly, a corresponding increase in the nation's
waistline is occurring. For men, the largest mean waist
circumference was among whites; for women, it was
among African Americans in both surveys. The unad-
justed mean waist circumference increased by 3.3 cm in
men and 3.5 cm in women. Among the three major racial
or ethnic groups, the largest increase occurred among
white men and African-American women. In addition,
the percentiles from both surveys suggest that much of
the waist circumference distribution shifted, especially
among women. Using age-specific rates of high-risk
waist circumference and the year 2000 U.S. population,
we estimate that 35 million men and 58 million women
had a large waist.

The largest increases in the prevalence of high risk waist
circumference occurred among men and women 20 to 39
years old. This finding is consistent with data from the
Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, which showed
that between 1991 and 1998 the greatest increase in the
prevalence of obesity was among people 18 to 29 years old
(23). These trends are worrisome because they bode ill for
the future health of young adults. For example, because of
the epidemic of obesity among youth, the prevalence of type
2 diabetes has reached historic dimensions (24). Data from
the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System showed
that people 30 to 39 years old experienced the largest
increase in the prevalence of diabetes (25). The large in-
creases in obesity among young adults suggest that they
should receive high priority for intervention efforts to re-
duce obesity.
On the basis of a study of Dutch participants, Han et al.
and Lean et al. suggested that waist measurements of 94 cm
in men and 80 cm in women corresponded to a BMI of 25
kg/m2 (26,27). The authors termed these cut-points "action
level 1." By examining the relation between waist circum-
ference and risk factors for cardiovascular disease, these
authors also established an "action level 2" (waist circum-
ference 102 cm in men and 88 cm in women) and
recommended that people in this category seek medical
attention and attempt weight loss. This action level 2 later
was adopted by the NIH as their high-risk waist circumfer-
ence (16).
The prevalence of obesity, as measured by a BMI  30
kg/m2, increased between NHANES III and NHANES 1999
to 2000 from 20.2% to 27.5% among men and from 25.4%
to 33.4% among women (1). The corresponding percentages
of the age-adjusted prevalence of high risk waist circumfer-
ence were 29.5% and 36.9% among men and 46.7% and
55.1% among women. Thus, the percentage of the U.S.

adults who have a high-risk waist circumference is consid-
erably larger than the percentage of participants with a
BMI  30 kg/m2.
Although increases in BMI have been described in many
populations, relatively few studies have described temporal
changes in waist circumference. Increases in waist circum-
ference were noted among Mauritian men and women 25 to
74 years old between 1987 and 1992 (29), Finish men and
women 25 to 64 years old between 1987 and 1997 (30),
German men and women 25 to 74 years old between 1989
to 1990 and 1994 to 1995 (31), and Indian women but not
men 20 years old between 1989 and 2000 (32).
The results from our analyses provide another look at the
obesity epidemic from the viewpoint of waist circumfer-
ence. The rapid increase in the prevalence of obesity among
U.S. adults portends ominously for the future health of the
nation. To slow the rate of increase in obesity, let alone
reverse it, will require the concerted efforts of many health
care professionals and public health professionals. How
commonly waist circumference is measured by clinicians is
unclear. Anecdotal evidence suggests that it is not practiced
routinely. However, more studies are demonstrating the
value of measuring waist circumference. Although measur-
ing waist circumference correctly requires some practice,
we urge health care professionals to incorporate waist cir-
cumference along with measuring weight and height in their
routine practice.
