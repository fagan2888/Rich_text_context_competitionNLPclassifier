OBJECTIVE -- The aim of this study was to examine the relations of alcohol consumption to
the prevalence of the metabolic syndrome and its components in the U.S. population.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS -- We performed a cross-sectional analysis on
data from 8,125 participants from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
who were evaluated for each component of the metabolic syndrome, using the National Cho-
lesterol Education Program criteria, fasting insulin, and alcohol consumption. Current alcohol
consumption was defined as 1 alcoholic drink per month.
RESULTS -- After adjustment for age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, income, tobacco use,
physical activity, and diet, subjects who consumed 1­19 and 20 drinks of alcohol per month
had odds ratios (ORs) for the prevalence of the metabolic syndrome of 0.65 and 0.34, respec-
tively (P  0.05 for all), compared with current nondrinkers. These findings were particularly
noteworthy for beer and wine drinkers. The association of 20 alcoholic drinks per month with
the prevalence of the metabolic syndrome was consistent across ethnicities but was most striking
in white men and women (ORs 0.35 and 0.22, respectively; P  0.05). Alcohol consumption was
significantly and inversely associated with the prevalence of the following three components of
the metabolic syndrome: low serum HDL cholesterol, elevated serum triglycerides, high waist
circumference, as well as hyperinsulinemia (P  0.05 for all).
CONCLUSIONS -- Mild to moderate alcohol consumption is associated with a lower prev-
alence of the metabolic syndrome, with a favorable influence on lipids, waist circumference, and
fasting insulin. This association was strongest among whites and among beer and wine drinkers.

Light to moderate alcohol consump-
tion is associated with lower cardio-
vascular mortality (1) and a reduced
risk of developing type 2 diabetes (2).
Some of the biological mechanisms re-
ported to explain this observation include
an improvement of the lipid profile, espe-
cially HDL cholesterol (3) and increasing
insulin sensitivity (4,5).
The metabolic syndrome is a cluster-
ing of low serum HDL cholesterol, ele-
vated serum triglycerides, hyperglycemia,
central obesity, and elevated blood pres-
sure, mediated in part by insulin resis-
tance (6,7). The metabolic syndrome is
associated with an increased risk of devel-
oping diabetes (8) and cardiovascular dis-
ease (9).
The favorable influence of alcohol
consumption on select components of the
metabolic syndrome (3,10) raises the pos-
sibility that alcohol intake may reduce the
risk of the metabolic syndrome. Few stud-
ies have examined the association be-
tween alcohol consumption and the
metabolic syndrome as defined by the Na-
tional Cholesterol Education Program
(11­13), and data are limited on how the
relation may be modified by type of alco-
hol, sex, or race/ethnicity (14,15).
We investigated the relations of the
quantity and the type of alcohol con-
sumed to the prevalence of the metabolic
syndrome (and its components) in men
and women of different race/ethnicities in
the U.S. population.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND
METHODS -- We analyzed data on
8,125 individuals from the Third Na-
tional Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey (NHANES III) (1988­1994); the
details of the study design and sampling
and examination techniques have been
described elsewhere (16,17). Individuals
participating in NHANES III were consid-
ered eligible for the present study if they
were age 20 years or older, not pregnant,
had completed the adult household inter-
view and questionnaire, had a physical
examination and laboratory evaluation
performed at one of the examination cen-
ters, and had fasted for at least 8 hours
before phlebotomy. Furthermore, they
were required to have data on 1) abdom-
inal waist circumference, 2) fasting serum

each of the covariates detailed below.
Definitions of outcome, exposure,
and covariates
Outcome. We defined the metabolic
syndrome using the National Cholesterol
Education Program definition (6). This
definition was satisfied if a subject pos-
sessed three or more of the following five
criteria: an abdominal waist circumfer-
ence 102 cm in men or 88 cm in
women; serum triglycerides 150 mg/dl
(1.69 mmol/l); serum HDL cholesterol
40 mg/dl (1.04mmol/l) in men or
50 mg/dl (1.29 mmol/l) in women;
average blood pressure 130/85 mmHg
or currently taking antihypertensive med-
ication; or fasting serum glucose 110
mg/dl (6.1 mmol/l) or on oral anti-
diabetic medication. We averaged the sec-
ond and third systolic and diastolic blood
pressure readings for each subject. Sub-
jects were also classified as hyperinsuline-
mic if the fasting insulin level was 90th
percentile of its distribution among sub-
jects in the sample (this value corre-
sponded to a fasting insulin 166 pmol/
l). This percentile was selected based on
work by Meigs et al. (18).
Exposure: alcohol intake (type and
amount). In NHANES III, alcohol con-
sumption was assessed by asking each
participant to quantify the number of
drinks consumed in the past month be-
fore the survey of three different types of
alcohol: 1) beer or light beer; 2) wine,
wine coolers, sangria, and champagne;
and 3) hard liquor such as tequila, gin,
vodka, scotch, rum, whiskey, and li-
queurs, either alone or mixed. We defined
alcohol consumption as 1) currently
drinking (1 drink of any type per
month) or not currently drinking (1 per
month); 2) the number per month of any
type of alcoholic drinks (1, 1­19, or
20); and 3) the number of beverage-
specific drinks per month (1, 1­19, or
20). Further categorization of the alco-
hol variable was not possible due to inad-
equate numbers. The not currently
drinking category (1 drink per month)
included subjects consuming at least 12
drinks of any type over a subject's lifetime
but not currently drinking alcohol (past
drinkers) and subjects consuming 12
drinks in their entire lifetime (lifetime ab-
stainers). Types of alcohol consumed
were divided into three categories: beer,
wine, and liquor.
Covariates. The definitions of the co-
variates used in this study were based on
metabolic syndrome risk factors de-
scribed by Park et al. (11). Race/ethnicity
was based on the screener and subject
self-report. We used three categories:
non-Hispanic white (white), non-
Hispanic black (black), and Mexican
American. Other racial/ethnic groups
were not included in our analysis because
of inadequate numbers.
Level of education was categorized
into 8th grade, between 8th and 12th
grade, and 12th grade education. An-
nual household income from the previous
year was classified as $20,000 or
$20,000. Subjects were considered
physically inactive if they expended 3.5
metabolic equivalents/month participat-
ing in walking, jogging, running, bicycle
riding, swimming, aerobics, aerobic
dancing, other types of dancing, calis-
thenics, exercises, or garden work. To-
bacco use was divided into current user,
past user (100 cigarettes in their life-
time but currently not smoking), or never
smoker. The percentage of daily total en-
ergy intake from carbohydrates (kilocalo-
ries) was calculated and divided into
40, 40­60, or 60%. Adequate data
on hormone replacement therapy were
not available; we did, however, use post-
menopausal status as a covariate because
it has been shown to be a risk factor for
the metabolic syndrome (11). Women
were considered postmenopausal if they
had not had a menstrual period in the past
12 months. Age was used as continuous
variable as well as categorized into cate-
gories of 20­29, 30­39, 40­49, 50­59,
60­69, and 70 years of age.
Statistical analysis
For each sex and race/ethnicity, we calcu-
lated the prevalences of the metabolic
syndrome, of each component of the syn-
drome, and of all covariates. Multiple lo-
gistic regression analyses were used to
estimate the ORs for the prevalence of the
metabolic syndrome and each of its com-
ponents using all three definitions of al-
cohol consumption as independent
variables (separate analyses for each)
while adjusting for covariates. For race/
ethnicity-specific models, interaction was
assessed using an interaction term be-
tween race/ethnicity and the number of
alcoholic drinks per month for men and
women. Because BMI was highly corre-
lated with waist circumference (r  0.87,
P  0.0001), which was one of the con-
stituent criteria for our dependent vari-
able, we felt BMI served more as a proxy
than a predictor for waist circumference.
We did not, therefore, include BMI as a
covariate in our primary analyses. We did
perform secondary analyses with BMI as a
covariate, and the inclusion of BMI did
not alter the relationship between alcohol
and the metabolic syndrome (data not
shown).
All analyses used sampling weights to
report estimates that would be represen-
tative of the U.S. population. We used
SUDAAN statistical software (19) to ob-
tain proper variance estimates to calculate
weighted means, percentages, standard
errors, and ORs given the NHANES III
complex sampling design. A two-sided P
value of 0.05 was considered statisti-
cally significant. The institutional review
board at Boston University Medical Cen-
ter approved this study.
RESULTS -- The characteristics of our
sample are presented in Table 1. Over
one-half (57.9%) of the participants were
current drinkers with higher percentages
for men (66.0%) than women (50.0%).
The prevalence of the metabolic syn-
drome was slightly higher in women
(22.7%) than in men (21.9%). Mexican-
American women had the highest propor-
tion of participants with the metabolic
syndrome (26.9%) and the smallest pro-
portion of current drinkers (36.0%).
Current drinkers had a lower ad-
justed prevalence of the metabolic syn-
drome than subjects not currently
drinking (OR 0.57 [95% CI 0.45­0.72]).
Compared with lifetime abstainers, the
adjusted odds for the prevalence of the
metabolic syndrome among past drinkers
was 0.96 (0.75­1.22). The reduced odds
for the prevalence of the metabolic syn-
drome in current drinkers were statisti-
cally significant in all age-groups except
the 50­60 age-group (0.76 [0.46­1.26])
and the 70 age-group (0.72 [0.52­
1.00]). The inverse relation of alcohol
consumption to prevalence of the meta-
bolic syndrome was consistent in men
and in women (0.58 [0.44­0.77] and
0.57 [0.44­0.74], respectively).
Overall, subjects consuming higher
quantities of alcoholic beverages had a
lower OR for the prevalence of the meta-
bolic syndrome as compared with current

nondrinkers (P  0.0001 for trend) (Ta-
ble 2). Beer, wine, and liquor had differ-
ent associations with the prevalence of the
metabolic syndrome, with statistically
significant reductions in the OR for the
prevalence of the metabolic syndrome
only for beer and wine.
The relation of alcohol intake to prev-
alence of the metabolic syndrome was
stronger in whites as compared with
blacks or Mexican Americans (Table 3).
Furthermore, unlike among whites, in
black and Mexican-American subjects,
consumption of 20 drinks per month
resulted only in a modest reduction in the
OR for the metabolic syndrome, as com-
pared with subjects who drank 1­19
drinks per month. This difference, how-
ever, was not accompanied by a statisti-
cally significant interaction term between
race/ethnicity and the number of alco-
holic drinks per month for men (P 
0.37) or women (P  0.13).
Although increasing quantities of al-
cohol consumption were associated with
a lower OR for the prevalence of the met-
abolic syndrome in the overall popula-
tion, this association was not consistent
for each of the components. Alcohol con-
sumption was significantly associated
with a lower OR for the prevalence of
three components of the metabolic syn-
drome: low serum HDL cholesterol, ele-
vated serum triglycerides, and high waist
circumference, as well as hyperinsulin-
emia (Table 4). When type of alcohol was
considered, beer and wine drinkers had
favorable associations with low HDL cho-
lesterol, elevated serum triglycerides,
waist circumference, hyperinsulinemia,
and elevated serum glucose. Among beer
and wine drinkers, the odds for the prev-
alence of elevated serum glucose when
drinking 20 drinks per month were
0.68 (95% CI 0.44 ­1.05) and 0.51
(0.28­0.90), respectively. In contrast, for
liquor drinkers, the only favorable associ-
ation was with low HDL cholesterol. Fur-
thermore, among liquor drinkers, the
odds for the prevalence of elevated serum
glucose when drinking 20 drinks per
month was 1.90 (1.25­2.88).
CONCLUSIONS -- Overall, our re-
sults demonstrate that people who drink
alcoholic beverages have a lower preva-
lence of the metabolic syndrome as com-
pared with current nondrinkers after
accounting for confounders. The inverse
relation of alcohol consumption and the
metabolic syndrome was especially no-
ticeable in people who consume 20 al-
coholic beverages per month and was
stronger when the beverage was beer or
wine. Although the association between
alcohol consumption and the metabolic
syndrome was present for all race/
ethnicities, it was particularly strong in
white individuals.

Alcohol and the metabolic syndrome
2956 DIABETES CARE, VOLUME 27, NUMBER 12, DECEMBER 2004
ported between alcohol and the metabolic
syndrome (11,13,20). Yoon et al. (13) re-
ported that 1­15 g of alcohol per day was
associated with decreased prevalence of
the metabolic syndrome, whereas Park et
al. (11) reported a decrease only in
women. This difference may relate to the
fact that Park et al. (11) included in the
"heavy" drinking category participants
who had a history of "ever consuming five
or more drinks almost daily" even if they
were not currently drinking. Further-
more, participants were included if they
fasted for 6 h, whereas the present study
and that of Yoon et al. (13) required 8
and 10­12 h, respectively.
Numerous studies show serum HDL
cholesterol concentrations increase in a
dose-dependent response to alcohol con-
sumption (3,21). Serum triglycerides are
higher in heavy drinkers (21) but can be
lower in light to moderate drinkers (22).
The relation with obesity, on the other
hand, has not been reported in a consis-
tent fashion (23,24). Nevertheless, some
data demonstrate that moderate amounts
of alcohol, especially wine, are associated
with smaller waist circumference as com-
pared with no alcohol consumption
(25,26). Although we did not observe an
association for all beverages between al-
cohol consumption and hyperglycemia,
several prospective studies have reported
a reduced incidence of diabetes with alco-
hol consumption (27­29). Furthermore,
several studies, including the present
study, have demonstrated lower insulin
concentrations and increased insulin sen-
sitivity among drinkers (19,30). In con-
trast, only a few studies have shown a
beneficial effect of alcohol consumption
on blood pressure (31,32), whereas the
majority of studies support our finding
that alcohol consumption results in ele-
vated blood pressure (33). The strength of
the association between alcohol consump-
tion and the metabolic syndrome may de-
pend heavily upon the prevalence of these
individual criteria in a given population.
We found that the reduced preva-
lence of metabolic syndrome was stronger
among drinkers of wine and beer than of
liquor. This could result if liquor consum-
ers drank larger amounts or had a differ-
ent pattern of consumption (e.g., binge
drinking) (34,35). Indeed, our data
showed that among individuals consum-
ing 50 total drinks per month, the mean
number of drinks of liquor consumed
(18.7) was more than twice that of wine
(8.1; P  0.001), whereas there was no
difference in the light-drinking categories.

However, we did not have adequate data to
describe drinking patterns in detail.
Unlike whites, blacks had only a
modest reduction in the odds for the
prevalence of the metabolic syndrome
when currently drinking, and in black
women there was no further reduction in
the odds with increasing quantities of al-
cohol. Although testing of interaction was
statistically not significant, we had limited
power to evaluate for effect modification
by race at the highest quantities of alcohol
consumption. Previous studies have re-
ported a relation between increased alco-
hol consumption and hypertension (33)
and a higher prevalence of hypertension
in blacks (36), and our data show that
blacks were heavier drinkers. Of the cur-
rent drinkers in our sample, 9.3% of black
men and 3.4% of black women currently
consumed at least 50 drinks per month,
whereas this was lower in white men
(5.8%) and women (2.0%).
Differences by race/ethnicity may also
relate to insulin sensitivity or hyperinsu-
linemia (37). Whereas hyperinsulinemia
is not a criterion for the metabolic syn-
drome, studies suggest that it is an impor-
tant element of the syndrome (7). Using
factor analysis, Meigs et al. (18) con-
cluded that a unified metabolic syndrome
included three independent factors: hy-
perinsulinemia, obesity, and dyslipide-
mia. Among black nondiabetic subjects,
however, insulin sensitivity is decreased
as compared with white subjects (38).
Similarly, fasting insulin concentrations
are higher among black women as com-
pared with white women at similar levels
of adiposity (39). In the present study, we
found that the odds for the prevalence of
hyperinsulinemia, after adjusting for our
covariates including BMI, was higher
among blacks as compared with whites
(1.47 [1.10­2.00]).
Although the strengths of our investi-
gations include the use of a large sample
representative of the adult U.S. popula-
tion (thereby enhancing our generaliz-
ability), the evaluation of both the type
and the quantity of alcohol consumed,
and the assessment of effect modification
by race/ethnicity, there are several limita-
tions that merit comment. First, given the
cross-sectional design, we cannot draw
any causal inferences regarding the asso-
ciation of alcohol consumption with the
metabolic syndrome. Second, the data on
alcohol consumption are based on self-
report with the possibility of misclassifi-
cation of exposure (e.g., under reporting).
However, this bias, if nondifferential,
would be expected only to increase the
amounts of alcohol associated with a re-
duced prevalence of the metabolic syn-
drome. Third, categories with the highest
quantities of alcohol consumption had
the fewest number of individuals, thus
limiting our ability to comment on the
relation of alcohol consumption to the
prevalence of the metabolic syndrome in
heavy drinkers. Finally, we cannot com-
ment on the effects of daily patterns of
alcohol consumption, as these data were
not available.
In summary, mild to moderate alco-
hol consumption, especially of beer and
wine, is associated with a lower preva-
lence of the metabolic syndrome and with
a favorable influence on serum lipids,
waist circumference, and fasting serum
insulin. This observed association be-
tween alcohol consumption and the met-
abolic syndrome was particularly strong
in white individuals.
