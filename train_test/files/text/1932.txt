Abstract
Background: The true causes of the obesity epidemic are not well understood and there are few longitudinal population-
based data published examining this issue. The objective of this analysis was to examine trends in occupational physical
activity during the past 5 decades and explore how these trends relate to concurrent changes in body weight in the U.S.
Methodology/Principal Findings: Analysis of energy expenditure for occupations in U.S. private industry since 1960 using
data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Mean body weight was derived from the U.S. National Health and Nutrition
Examination Surveys (NHANES). In the early 1960's almost half the jobs in private industry in the U.S. required at least
moderate intensity physical activity whereas now less than 20% demand this level of energy expenditure. Since 1960 the
estimated mean daily energy expenditure due to work related physical activity has dropped by more than 100 calories in
both women and men. Energy balance model predicted weights based on change in occupation-related daily energy
expenditure since 1960 for each NHANES examination period closely matched the actual change in weight for 40­50 year
old men and women. For example from 1960­62 to 2003­06 we estimated that the occupation-related daily energy
expenditure decreased by 142 calories in men. Given a baseline weight of 76.9 kg in 1960­02, we estimated that a 142
calories reduction would result in an increase in mean weight to 89.7 kg, which closely matched the mean NHANES weight
of 91.8 kg in 2003­06. The results were similar for women.
Conclusion: Over the last 50 years in the U.S. we estimate that daily occupation-related energy expenditure has decreased
by more than 100 calories, and this reduction in energy expenditure accounts for a significant portion of the increase in
mean U.S. body weights for women and men.

Introduction
The sharp increase in the prevalence of obesity and associated
health consequences over recent decades in the U.S. are well
documented [1,2]. The causes of the ongoing obesity epidemic are
not well established and despite the great economic and health
care significance of the obesity epidemic there are relatively few
longitudinal population-based data examining this issue. At the
most basic level weight is the end-product of energy consumed and
energy expended. Physical activity is the only modifiable variable
contributing to total energy expended and can be segmented into
occupational (i.e., work-related) and non-occupational or leisure-
time physical activity.
Using a variety of data sources and statistical modeling there have
been a number of papers suggesting that increased food intake is
largely, if not completely, responsible for the obesity epidemic [3­5].
One of the arguments to support this hypothesis is that time spent in
leisure-time activity has remained unchanged in recent decades
leading to the conclusion that it is solely excessive caloric intake that
has led to the present predicament. Even though the stability of
leisure time activity argument is not compelling for a variety of
reasons not to be examined here, the time spent in leisure-time
physical activity represents a relatively small portion of the total hours
in a week. Importantly, occupational physical activity has an even
greater potential to have a significant impact on total caloric
expenditure. While a common assertion is that occupational physical
activity has decreased in recent decades, to our knowledge this has not
been examined in detail, nor have changes in occupational physical
activity been associated with changes in mean body weight or the
prevalence of obesity [6].
Using nationally representative data sources we examined
trends in occupational physical activity during the past 5 decades
and explore how these trends relate to changes in mean body
weight and the prevalence of obesity in the U.S. Having a better
understanding of the relative importance of occupational physical
activity in the ongoing obesity epidemic should help in the
formulation of a comprehensive evidenced-based plan, with
policies, strategies and tactics to combat this continuing problem.

Methods
The prevalence of obesity (body mass index $30.0 kg/m2) in
U.S. adults was derived from the 1960­62, 1971­74, 1976­80,
1988­94, 1999­2000, 2001­02, 2003­04 and 2005­06 U.S.
National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES)
[7,8]. NHANES uses a complex, multistage, probability sampling
design to select participants who are representative of the civilian,
non-institutionalized U.S. population. Sample weights are as-
signed to each individual to represent the U.S. population and
allow for the development of national prevalence figures. The
prevalence of obesity for each examination period was age-
adjusted by the direct method to the year 2000 U.S. Bureau of
Census estimates. Mean body weight for the 1960­62, 1971­74,
1976­80, 1988­94, 1999­2002 and 2003­2006 NHANES surveys
for the 40­50 year old age group were examined by gender [9,10].
We chose this age group because it has the highest percent of
employed individuals for both men and women [9]. The National
Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) ethics review board approved
the original survey protocols, and informed consent was obtained
for all NHANES participants.
Employment data were derived from the Current Employment
Statistics (CES) program for the years 1960 to 2008. The CES is a
monthly survey of businesses and government agencies conducted
by State employment security agencies in cooperation with the
Bureau of Labor Statistics. The survey provides employment,
hours and earnings estimates based on payroll records of business
establishments dating back to 1939, but is limited to nonagricul-
tural industries. Occupations are broadly categorized as goods-
producing or service providing. Goods-producing further sub-
categorized into mining-logging, construction and manufacturing,
while service-providing occupations are further divided into the
categories of trade (whole sale and retail), transportation/utilities,
information, financial services, professional/business services,
education/health services, leisure/hospitality and other. Agricul-
tural employment data were derived from the Current Population
Survey (CPS) which is a monthly survey of households conducted
by the Bureau of Census for the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The
CPS provides a comprehensive body of data on the labor force
including employment, unemployment and persons not in the
labor force. While CPS has agricultural employment data dating
back to1940, it only has detailed occupation and industry data
starting in 1983.
Median, minimum and maximum physical activity intensity
(Metabolic Equivalents: METs) were assigned to each occupation
based on previously published classification schemes [11]. Industries
were then categorized into physical activity intensity groups based on
the median METs value. The intensity categories were sedentary (,2
METs), light (2.0­2.9 METS), and moderate (3.0­5.9 METs) [12­14].
Statistical Analyses
The prevalence of individuals in specific occupations by year
was calculated by dividing the number of individuals in a given
occupation by total U.S. occupations in private industry from CES
combined with total agricultural occupations from the CPS for
that year. The prevalence of individuals in sedentary, light, and
moderate intensity category industries was calculated for each
year. Mean occupational-related METs for each year were
calculated as follows: the number of individuals employed in each
occupation was multiplied by the median METs for the
occupation with the product for each occupation added together
and the sum divided by the total number of employed individuals
for that year. To estimate daily occupation-related physical activity
energy expenditure we assumed an 8 hour work day, used the
mean weight from 1960­1962 NHANES survey (64.9 kg for
women and 76.9 kg for men) and used the mean MET value for
each year with the formula: daily caloric expenditure = hours
worked6mean MET value6weight (kg) [15].
Energy Balance Differential Equation Model
Theoretical predictions of weight gain as a result of changes in
energy expenditures were computed using a validated energy balance
differential equation model for weight change [16,17]. The model is
derived from the first law of thermodynamics and predicts weight
change resulting from changes in energy intake and energy
expenditures. The predictions account for weight dependent changes
in energy expenditure through specific formulations of weight
dependent terms for physical activity and resting metabolic rate.
In order to compare model predictions to the NHANES data, we
determined the average weight gain in kg per kcal decrease in energy
expenditure resulting from the trends in occupational activities.
Specifically, after decreasing energy expenditures by increments of
50, 100, and 150 kcal/d to represent decreased work-related physical
activity, the model was simulated until steady state was reached. The
predicted change in weight per decrease in kcal/d energy expenditure
was determined by averaging the three ratios of the change in steady
state weight per 50 kcal/d. From the model men gain 0.090 kg for
every kcal of energy expenditure decrease and women gain 0.092 kg
for every kcal of energy expenditure decrease.
Results
The top panel of Figure 1 depicts the prevalence of service
occupations, goods producing occupations and agricultural occupa-
tions for the U.S. from 1960 to 2008. For both goods producing and
agriculture occupations there has been a decrease over the last 5
decades while there has been a substantial increase in the prevalence of
service occupations (p for trend,0.001 for each). Within the goods
producing occupations (middle panel), construction has been relatively
constant (p trend=0.5) while there has been a large decrease in the
prevalence of manufacturing and mining/logging occupations (p for
trend,0.001 for each). Whereas more than 30% of U.S. private sector
occupations were in manufacturing in the 1960's this number
decreased to approximately 12% of U.S. private sector jobs by 2008.
In the service occupations category (lower panel), the information
category of occupation has seen a negative trend (p trend,0.001) while
all other service occupations have seen an upward trend in prevalence
(p#0.01 for each). The occupation categories of professional services,
health/education and leisure/hospitality in particular have seen large
increases. Together, these three service occupation categories made up
approximately 20% of U.S. occupations in the early 1960's and by the
year 2008 they represented 43% of U.S. occupations.
Table 1 summarizes the estimated median and range of physical
activity intensity (METs) as well as the estimated caloric expenditure
of each occupation. Mining/logging, construction and manufactur-
ing all qualified as moderate intensity activity. All service occupation
sectors were either sedentary or light intensity activity.
Figure 2 presents the trends in the prevalence of sedentary,
light, and moderate intensity occupations from 1960 to 2008.
While there has been a steady increase in the prevalence of
sedentary and light intensity physical activity occupations since
1960, the prevalence of moderate intensity physical activity
occupations has decreased from 48% in 1960 to 20% in 2008 (p
trend,0.001 for each). Figure 3 plots the mean occupation-related
METs (top panel) and the associated change in occupation-related
daily caloric expenditure for women and men (bottom panel).
There was a steep decline in mean occupation-related METs and
consequently mean occupation-related physical activity energy

expenditure from 1960 to 2008 (p trend,0.001 for each). From
1960 to 2008 there was an approximate drop in occupation-
related daily energy expenditure of 140 calories for men and 124
calories for women.

and women (lower panel). The energy balance model predictions
assumed a 5 day work week. For both men and women the
predicted weight based on changes in occupational energy
expenditure closely matches the NHANES weight for each
examination period.
Discussion
Over the last 50 years in the U.S. there has been a progressive
decrease in the percent of individuals employed in goods producing
and agriculture occupations whereas there has been an increase in the
percent of individuals employed in service occupations. This has
resulted in a shift away from occupations that require moderate
intensity physical activity to occupations that are largely composed of
sitting and sedentary behavior. In the early 1960's almost half of
private industry occupations in the U.S. required at least moderate
intensity physical activity and now less than 20% demand this level of
activity. We estimate that daily occupation-related energy expendi-
ture has decreased by more than 100 calories in both women and
men, and further, this reduction in occupational energy expenditure
accounts for a large portion of the observed increase in mean U.S.
weight over the last 5 decades.
Examining secular changes in total daily physical activity is a
complex endeavor. Two examples include the observation that
time spent in recreational activities has increased but so has time
spent watching TV. At the same time, time spent on household
work has greatly decreased in women but slightly increased in men
[6]. Dissecting the relative importance of each of these activities of
daily living on body weight is challenging. Here we chose to focus
on occupation-related energy expenditure because time spent at
work represents the largest segment of waking hours for most
people in the age range we studied. It is important to note that we
examined the prevalence of different occupations, not absolute
number of jobs in a given occupation. This is important because
the workforce is not a static population and over the last 50 years
the prevalence of Americans in the Labor Force has increased
from approximately 40% to 50% [18]. One of the driving forces
behind the increased prevalence of working Americans is the
increase of women in the work force. In 1970 43% percent of
women were in the labor force and by 2007 this increased to 60%
of women. This fact may also explain why occupation-related
energy expenditure estimated a higher mean weight during the
years of 1971 to 1994 but closely matched the mean weight of
women from NHANES during the period of 1999­2002 [18].
Given that it is unlikely that there will be a return to occupations that
demand moderate levels of physical activity; our findings provide
further strong evidence of the public health importance of promoting
physically active lifestyles outside of the work day. Our estimation of a
reduction of more than 100 calories per day in occupation-related
energy expenditure over the last 50 years would have been adequately
compensated for by meeting the 2008 federal physical activity
recommendations of 150 minutes per week of moderate intensity
activity or 75 minutes per week of vigorous intensity activity [13].
While it is often noted that the prevalence of Americans who achieve
this recommendation has been constant over recent decades, the fact
remains that based on self-report data only 1 in 4 Americans achieve

this level [19]. It is important to note that when physical activity is
assessed with accelerometers the number of Americans that achieve the
physical activity recommendations falls to 1 in 20 [20]. Thus since
energy expenditure has largely been removed from the work place the
relative importance of leisure-time physical activity has increased and
should be a major focus of public health interventions and research.
Based on estimated caloric consumption from food production
and food disappearance (food waste) estimates, previous reports
have concluded that increased caloric consumption could account
for most, if not all, of the weight gained at a population level in the
U.S. [3­5]. Nonetheless, a recently validated differential equation
model was used to identify a conservative lower bound for the
amount of food waste in the U.S. [21]. This analysis deter-
mined that prior estimates of national food waste were grossly
underestimated; indicating that the national average caloric intake
was lower than previously estimated. These results and the results
of the present study indicate that changes in caloric intake cannot
solely account for the observed trends in national weight gain.
Our analysis has strengths and weaknesses that deserve mention. A
major strength of this analysis is that for both the U.S. obesity and
occupation data we used nationally representative databases. Further,
we used a previously published and well-recognized classification
system to assign physical activity intensity levels to each occupation
category thus minimizing the possibility of misclassifying occupation-
related physical activity intensity [11]. However, we used the same
physical activity classifications across the 5 decades examined and in
doing so we did not take into account changes in technology that have
reduced physical labor. While technological advances have greatly
reduced the physical labor associated with most manufacturing
operations this phenomenon would drive our results towards the null
and thus we may be underestimating the true loss of moderate
intensity occupations in the work force. Our analysis was focused on
type of occupation, and there are many aspects of occupation related
daily energy expenditure we did not examine such as mode of travel
to work, total sitting time and stair usage. Another weakness of our
analysis is that not all agricultural or goods producing occupations are

associated with higher levels of physical activity and conversely some
service-related occupations are associated with higher levels of
physical activity. However, there are no adequate data to examine
this level of detail and we were very conservative in assigning MET
values in order to minimize the effect of such misclassification within
occupation types.
Conclusions
Over the last 50 years in the U.S. there has been a progressive
decrease in the percent of individuals employed in occupations
that require moderate intensity physical activity. We estimate that
daily occupation-related energy expenditure has decreased by
more than 100 calories, and this reduction in energy expenditure
accounts for a significant portion of the increase in mean U.S.
body weight for women and men over the last 5 decades.
