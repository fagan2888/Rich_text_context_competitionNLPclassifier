Objective: To examine the relationship between physical
activity and inactivity patterns and overweight in U.S. ad-
olescents using baseline and 1-year change in activity and
inactivity data.
Research Methods and Procedures: Nationally representa-
tive data from 12,759 participants (6997 non-Hispanic
whites, 2676 non-Hispanic blacks, 2185 Hispanics, and 901
Asians) in the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent
Health (1995 and 1996). Data on moderate to vigorous and
low-intensity physical activity, TV/video viewing, and
video game/computer use were obtained from question-
naires. Multivariate models assessed the association of
overweight (body mass index  95th percentile Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention/National Center for Health
Statistics 2000 curves) with initial (and 1-year change)
activity and inactivity levels, controlling for age, ethnicity,
socioeconomic status, urban residence, cigarette smoking,
and region of residence.
Results: Overweight prevalence was positively associated
with high level TV/video viewing among white boys (odds
ratio [OR]  1.52; 95% confidence interval [1.08 to 2.14])
and girls (OR  2.45 [1.51 to 3.97]). The odds of overweight
decreased with high levels of moderate to vigorous physical
activity among white boys (OR  0.81 [0.76 to 0.87]),
non-Hispanic black boys (OR  0.86 [0.76 to 0.98]) and
girls (OR  0.88 [0.78 to 0.99]), and Hispanic boys (OR 
0.90 [0.83 to 0.97]) and girls (OR  0.91 [0.84 to 0.99]).
Discussion: Predicted probabilities generated from the lo-
gistic regression models, which examined the experimental
effects of altering hours of TV/video viewing and bouts of
moderate to vigorous physical activity, show lower over-
weight among adolescents who watched less TV per week
combined with frequent moderate to vigorous physical ac-
tivity than those who watched more TV per week combined
with fewer bouts of weekly moderate to vigorous physical
activity. Predicted probabilities suggest important sex and
ethnic differences in these associations.

Introduction
Recent surveys show an alarming trend of increased
overweight prevalence in U.S. adolescents (1). Childhood
and adolescent overweight are major health problems for
American youth because of their associated morbidities
(2,3) and tendency to persist into adulthood (4,5).
Physical activity and inactivity have been shown to be
related to obesity, but exert influence through different
behavioral pathways (6). Evidence suggests that physical
activity is inversely associated with overweight (7­9), al-
though results are inconsistent (10,11). Researchers have
found that inactivity, specifically television viewing, is an
important risk factor for obesity development (6,12­14),
although these results are inconsistent as well (7,15,16).
Physical activity and inactivity track into adulthood, al-
though inactivity shows better tracking (17). A substantial
body of research by Epstein and colleagues (16,18­21) has
shown that reducing physical inactivity of children can
increase physical activity and reduce obesity.
Cumulative research has shown a positive relationship
between TV viewing and obesity among children and ado-
lescents in national samples (12­14,22­24). However, little
work has explored the relationship among physical activity,
inactivity, and overweight in large samples, which include
substantial ethnic subpopulations, specifically Asian and
Hispanic Americans. Moreover, analyses of physical activ-

ity have not included adequate measures of both low- and
moderate/vigorous-intensity physical activity. Furthermore,
there is little in the literature on the role of changes in
physical activity and inactivity and their association with
overweight among any national sample of U.S. adolescents.
The purpose of this study was to examine the association
among physical activity, inactivity, and overweight to in-
form interventions to reduce overweight. This study aimed
to document the prevalence of overweight and assess the
association of initial status of (and 1-year change) TV and
video viewing, computer/video game use, moderate to vig-
orous physical activity, and low-intensity physical activity
with overweight among U.S. adolescents. This study makes
three important and unique contributions to the activity
literature: use of baseline and dynamic measures of physical
activity and inactivity, use of broad physical activity mea-
sures, including moderate to vigorous and low-intensity
physical activity data, and the opportunity to investigate the
association of physical activity and inactivity with over-
weight in a large nationally representative sample of ado-
lescents of diverse ethnic backgrounds.
Research Methods and Procedures
Survey Design
The study population includes more than 20,000 adoles-
cents enrolled in The National Longitudinal Study of Ado-
lescent Health (Add Health), a longitudinal, nationally rep-
resentative, school-based study of adolescents in grades 7 to
12 (ages 12 to 22 years) in the United States. Add Health
included a core sample plus subsamples of selected minority
and other groupings collected under protocols approved by
the Institutional Review Board of the University of North
Carolina at Chapel Hill. We used the wave 1 (20,747
eligible adolescents measured April to December, 1995)
and wave 2 samples (14,438 eligible adolescents who would
be still enrolled in high school during 1996, including
dropouts, measured April to August, 1996). Exclusions in-
cluded the following: adolescents who used a walking aid (e.g.,
cane, crutches, or wheelchair); Native Americans (N  178),
due to small sample size; adolescents without complete phys-
ical activity, height, and weight data; and adolescents older
than 19 years of age. Our final sample includes 12,759 ado-
lescents, 11 to 19 years of age (X
  15.9  0.11), 49.3% boys
(sample sizes are shown in Table 1), for prevalence estimates
and logistic regression analysis. The survey design and
sampling frame have been described elsewhere (25,26).
In-home surveys of adolescents provided the physical activ-
ity and inactivity, body mass index (BMI), and smoking data.
In-home surveys of parents and adolescents provided income
and educational data. Race and ethnicity were determined
using self-reported data from a combination of all the surveys.
Body Mass
Height and weight were measured in wave 2. For multi-
variate analysis, overweight is defined as a BMI  95th
percentile of age- and sex-specific cut-points from the Cen-
ters for Disease Control and Prevention/National Center for
Health Statistics 2000 growth charts (27) as recommended
by expert panels (28,29).
Physical Activity and Inactivity
Add Health questionnaires included a standard physical
activity behavior recall that is similar, although not identi-
cal, to other self-report questionnaires that have been used
and validated in other large-scale epidemiological studies
(12,30­33). Information was elicited on participation in
moderate to vigorous physical activity (5 to 8 metabolic
equivalents [METs], skating and cycling, exercise and ac-
tive sports) and low-intensity activity (2 to 3 METs; house
cleaning, hobbies, and hanging out with friends) in units of
times per week. There were no 4 MET level activities
reported. One MET represents the resting metabolic rate or
3.5 mL O2
/kg body per minute. TV viewing, video viewing,
and computer/video game use were recorded as hours per
week over the past week. These methods have been de-
scribed in detail elsewhere (26). Quantifying inactivity has
received far less attention than physical activity (34) and
little, if anything, is published in the literature regarding the
reliability and validity of inactivity data.
Study Variables
We examined initial status of physical activity and inac-
tivity measured in wave 1 of the study and the change
between waves 1 and 2. We categorized initial status of TV
and video viewing as low (7 h/wk, reference); medium (8
to 35 h/wk), and high (36 h/wk); and computer/video
game use as 4 or 4 h/wk. We used these categories to
correct for non-normal distributions and for comparative
purposes, based on the recommendation of the American
Academy of Pediatrics Committee on Public Education (35)
to watch no more than 1 to 2 hours of TV per day.
We used categories of change in inactivity for the mul-
tivariate analyses: TV and video viewing (increase of 7
h/wk) and computer/video games (increase of 1 h/wk).
Categories of inactivity (TV, video viewing, and computer/
video game use) were initially analyzed separately; how-
ever, final models combined TV- and video-viewing hours
because of absence of a separate video effect on overweight
and similarity in MET values for watching TV and videos.
This strategy ignores the separate effect of TV advertising.
Statistical Analysis
Statistical analyses were carried out using STATA, Ver-
sion 6.0 (StataCorp, College Station, TX) (36). Descriptive
analysis used post-stratification sample weights to allow
results to be representative of adolescents attending U.S.

middle- and high-schools. All analyses used multiple stages
of cluster sampling to allow for survey design effects. We
used logistic regression models of overweight (BMI  95th
percentile; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention/
National Center for Health Statistics) to investigate the
effects of initial (and 1-year change) activity and inactivity
status, and the interaction between initial status and 1-year
change in activity and inactivity. Conceptually, use of
change in activity/inactivity adds knowledge and increases
confidence that the associations between activity/inactivity
and overweight represent causal relationships. The interac-
tion between initial status and change variables was not
significant and, therefore, was excluded from final models.
Sociodemographic correlates of activity and inactivity
were used as control variables. These correlates included
age, total household income, parental education, urban res-
idence (urban, rural, and suburban), cigarette smoking, pres-
ence of mother in household, and presence of father in
household. Models were stratified by sex and ethnicity.
Results
Overweight Status
Overweight prevalence (Figure 1) was highest among
non-Hispanic black girls, non-Hispanic white boys, and
Hispanic boys and girls. Mean BMI values of those classi-
fied as overweight ranged from 31.6 at age 12 years to 35.2
at age 18 years.
Initial Status of Inactivity and Activity
In the total sample, TV/video viewing was higher among
boys. By ethnicity, non-Hispanic blacks had the highest
levels (Table 1). Overall, boys, particularly non-Hispanic
black and Asian boys, spent considerably more time playing
computer/video games.
In the total sample, boys had more bouts per week of
moderate to vigorous physical activity than girls (Table 1).
Moderate to vigorous activity was highest for Asian and
non-Hispanic white boys and lowest for non-Hispanic black
and Hispanic girls. Boys and girls engaged in identical total
mean low-intensity physical activity per week.
One-Year Changes in Inactivity and Activity
The total sample had a 1-year decrease in the hours per
week of TV/video (mean  1.49; SE  0.26 h/wk), with
sex and ethnic variation shown in Table 1. Overall, adoles-
cents decreased the number of hours per week of video/
computer game use (mean  0.41; SE  0.11) over the
1-year period. Boys had significantly higher increases in
TV/video viewing and games than girls.
On average, adolescents decreased weekly moderate to
vigorous physical activity, with a sample mean of 0.19
(SE  0.03) bouts per week. There were greater decrements
among boys, and specifically Asian and non-Hispanic white
boys. On average, adolescents increased their low-intensity
physical activity over the 1-year period (mean  0.13; SE 
0.03) bouts per week. It is likely that adolescents are re-
placing TV/video viewing with low-intensity physical ac-
tivity, such as talking on the telephone, hanging out with
friends, and driving or riding in cars.
Association of Physical Activity and Inactivity with
Overweight
Initial status and change in physical activity and inactiv-
ity were modeled in sex- and ethnicity-stratified models
controlling for age, maternal education, family income,
presence of mother in the household, urban residence, cig-
arette smoking, region, and cluster sampling (Table 2).
For the total sample of U.S. boys (fifth column of Table
2), odds of overweight were nearly 50% higher with high
TV viewing and 14% lower with high moderate to vigorous
physical activity. A 1-year decrease in moderate to vigorous
physical activity was associated with a 10% decrease in
odds of overweight. For the total sample of U.S. girls (fifth
column of Table 2), odds of overweight were 43% higher
with high TV/video viewing and 10% lower with high
moderate to vigorous physical activity. In addition, girls had
8% higher odds of overweight with 1-year change in low-
intensity physical activity.
The pattern of results by sex and ethnic groups (the first
four columns of Table 2) showed substantial variation in the
association between levels of inactivity and activity by sex
and ethnicity. For example, greater TV/video viewing was
significantly associated with increased risk of overweight
only among white adolescents. Computer and video game

use was significantly associated with decreased risk of
overweight among Asians. Moderate to vigorous physical
activity was significantly associated with decreased risk of
overweight except among non-Hispanic white girls and
Asians, with levels ranging from 19% lower among non-
Hispanic whites to 9% lower among Hispanic girls.
Models were run with and without change variables to
determine the effect of using the more dynamic models.
Models of overweight using baseline measures without the
change variables showed similar patterns as those with
change variables, although significance level of baseline
measures was moderately higher for the models including
change measures.
Predicted Probability of Overweight by Level of TV
Viewing and Moderate to Vigorous Physical Activity
An alternative strategy for interpreting the relative im-
portance of activity and inactivity involves predicting the
prevalence of overweight at different, researcher-specified
levels of activity and inactivity. To accomplish this, we used
coefficients derived from the fully adjusted logistic regres-
sion models described above to calculate predicted proba-
bility of overweight for low vs. high levels of TV/video
viewing (7 vs. 35 h/wk), moderate to vigorous activ-
ity (1 vs. 7 bouts/wk) and combinations of high inactivity
with low moderate to vigorous activity vs. low inactivity
with high moderate to vigorous activity. Results are
presented in Table 3.
Predicted probability of overweight was higher (5.3 per-
centage points, boys and 3.6 percentage points, girls) with
35 h/wk of TV/video viewing vs. 7 h/wk. For moderate
to vigorous activity, the predicted probability of overweight
was 9.3 percentage points (boys) and 4.8 percentage points
(girls) higher among those who engaged in one bout of
moderate to vigorous physical activity per week, compared
with those who engaged in seven bouts per week. The
combined effects of high inactivity and low moderate to
vigorous physical activity is particularly evident in boys: the
predicted probability of overweight was nearly 15 percent-
age points higher for those with high TV/video time and low
moderate to vigorous activity. For girls, the comparable
difference was 7.9 percentage points.
The greatest impact of additional hours of TV/video viewing
on overweight was for non-Hispanic white girls (10 percentage
points higher) and Hispanic boys (9.2 percentage points high-
er), whereas negative effects were seen for non-Hispanic black
boys (1.1 percentage points lower) and girls (3.7 percentage
points lower). Higher levels of moderate to vigorous physical
activity had comparatively stronger effects on non-Hispanic
white boys (12.5 percentage points higher) and non-Hispanic
black boys (10.4 percentage points higher).
Discussion
These results are consistent with previous research show-
ing an association of overweight prevalence with TV view-

ing among U.S. children and adolescents (12­14,22­24)
and in smaller studies (37,38). Researchers found a larger
1-year increase in BMI among youths who reported more
time viewing TV, videos, and games (39). However, other
researchers found no association between TV viewing and
obesity (15,40,41). In fact, the point has been made that the
positive findings cited above represent weak associations
(15,42). Behavioral studies show that reductions in inactiv-
ity result in increases in physical activity and reduced obe-
sity (16,18­21). The discrepancy in published findings may
reflect the difficulty in accurately measuring television
viewing and physical activity (13,42).
On average, the odds of overweight in this study were
nearly 50% higher with greater TV/video viewing. Simi-
larly, other researchers found increased odds of overweight
for American youth with higher TV viewing (13,14,43).
Results from the predicted probabilities for the total study
sample suggest that reducing TV-viewing time will likely
result in a dramatic reduction in overweight prevalence.
Related to this result, Epstein et al. (19­21) have shown
that reducing TV viewing was successful in decreasing
obesity among children. In addition, intervention research
has shown TV-viewing reductions decreased BMI among
girls (16,44). Furthermore, research has shown a greater
association between overweight and TV viewing than phys-
ical activity (24). Our findings indicate that reducing
inactivity might be less successful among selected eth-
nic groups (e.g., non-Hispanic black adolescents, Asians
and Hispanic girls) and this is disconcerting given high-
inactivity/low-physical activity patterns among minority
adolescents (26).
At the other end of the activity spectrum, we found a
negative association between greater moderate to vigorous
physical activity and overweight among non-Hispanic white
boys, non-Hispanic blacks, and Hispanics of both sexes.
Results suggest that increasing moderate to vigorous phys-
ical activity will likely result in dramatic reductions in
overweight for all groups, except Asians, with greatest
potential among non-Hispanic white and black boys. Evi-
dence from other studies also suggests that physical activity
is inversely associated with overweight (7­9). Despite the
fact that a cross-sectional analysis of a national sample
found no relationship between overweight and moderate
to vigorous physical activity, researchers did find a neg-
ative relationship between overweight and participation
in sport teams and exercise programs in boys and 14- to
16-year-old girls (23).
Our findings demonstrate a significant association be-
tween moderate to vigorous physical activity and over-
weight. Few studies have examined this association and
even fewer have found that moderate to vigorous physical
activity influences overweight status [e.g., two national
studies found no relationship between physical activity and
body composition (12,13)]. Moreover, the work of Epstein
et al. (19­21) has highlighted the importance of reduc-
tions in inactivity for obesity intervention efforts. Lack of
a positive effect on weight (despite positive changes in
moderate to vigorous physical activity) (45) in the Child
Adolescent Trial for Cardiovascular Health study also
emphasized a greater focus on inactivity (46). Impor-
tantly, we have shown that moderate to vigorous physical
activity is far more amenable to environmental interven-
tions than inactivity (47).
In terms of methodology, we separately tested low-inten-
sity physical activity, a dimension of physical activity here-
tofore ignored. We found a modest effect of change in
low-intensity physical activity on overweight status for
girls, in general, and specifically in Asian girls. In addition,
we found that using both baseline and 1-year dynamic
change in activity and inactivity were important. On av-
erage, using the dynamic measures does not dramatically
change the association of overweight with our baseline
values, perhaps due to the limited 12-month length of the
measurement period. Future research should use longitu-
dinal analyses over longer periods to fully understand
these longitudinal relationships.
The ethnic differences found in this study likely resulted
from a complex interaction between socioeconomic, envi-
ronmental, and cultural factors. For example, previous re-
sults from the Add Health study suggest that environmental
influences exert an important positive influence on physical
activity levels, whereas socioeconomic factors exert an in-
fluence on inactivity (47). It may also be possible that the
ethnic differentials observed in this study could be the result
of differential reporting of physical activity and inactivity,
perhaps due to cultural influences and expectations that may
differentially lead to over- or underreporting of activity and
inactivity. Future work will help to elucidate the complex
interactions between these factors and how they relate to
overweight among U.S. adolescents.
In summary, these findings suggest that overweight prev-
alence is high and adolescents are engaging in high levels of
inactivity and low levels of moderate to vigorous physical
activity. We find that reductions in television and video
viewing are likely to reduce overweight of U.S. adolescents.
In addition, we find that an increase in moderate to vigorous
physical activity represents another potentially successful
strategy for reducing overweight among U.S. adolescents.
Both approaches, and particularly an approach that com-
bines reductions in inactivity and promotion of physical
activity, are likely to result in marked reductions in over-
weight prevalence among our nation's youth. However, we
must begin to consider the differences in behavior in dif-
ferent ethnic subpopulations, as well as differences in un-
derlying factors that influence behavior differentials, as we
devise intervention strategies.
