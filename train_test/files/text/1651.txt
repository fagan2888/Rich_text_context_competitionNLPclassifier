background: Investigators have postulated that family size may be influenced by biologic fertility potential in addition to sociodemo-
graphic factors. The aim of the current study is to determine if a diagnosis of infertility is associated with family size in the USA.
methods: We analyzed data from the male and female samples of the 2002 National Survey of Family Growth using multivariable logistic
regression models to determine the relationship between infertility and family size while adjusting for sociodemographic and reproductive
characteristics.
results: In the survey, 4409 women and 1739 men met the inclusion criteria, of whom 10.2% and 9.7%, respectively, were classified as
infertile, on the basis of having sought reproductive assistance. Infertile females had a 34% reduced odds of having an additional child com-
pared with women who did not seek reproductive assistance. For each additional 6 months it took a woman to conceive her first child, the
odds of having a larger family fell by 9% and the odds of having a second child were reduced by 11%. A diagnosis of male infertility reduced
the odds of having a larger family more than a diagnosis of female infertility.
conclusions: A diagnosis of infertility, especially male factor, is associated with reduced odds of having a larger family, implicating a
biologic role in the determination of family size in the USA.
Key words: infertility / fertility / family size
Introduction
Epidemiologic studies suggest that the birth rate in the USA has fallen
45% over the past 40 years (Hamilton and Ventura, 2006). Concur-
rently, researchers have reported a worldwide decline in semen
quality (Carlsen et al., 1992). Whether the decline is enough to affect
pregnancy rates is unclear (Carlsen et al., 1992; Irvine et al., 1996;
Bonde et al., 1999; Swan et al., 2000; Jouannet et al., 2001; Jorgensen
et al., 2002) The decline in birth rate in the USA has been partially
explained by delayed childbearing by women. Individuals are delaying
starting a family in order to fulfill personal and career aspirations
(Baldwin and Nord, 1984; Mosher and Bachrach, 1996). Indeed, over
the past 25 years, the mean maternal birth age has risen over 2 years
(Martin et al., 2009). According to data from the National Survey of
Family Growth (NSFG), 7.2% of women at the end of their reproductive
age (40足44) were classified as infertile and this number climbed to
27.4% of women who were nulliparous (Chandra et al., 2005).
In addition to sociodemographic factors, investigators have also
explored biologic causes for the decrease in fertility rates, and have
produced models of fertility based on previous trends in declining
sperm counts (Slama et al., 2004; Leridon and Slama, 2008). Investi-
gators have attempted to explore causes for fertility rate fluctuations
such as environmental pollutants (Hauser et al., 2006; Swan, 2006).
Researchers have also examined whether fluctuations in fertility
rates affect family size. Joffe et al. (2009) used several European data
sets to establish that biologic fertility has a significant role in predicting
final family size. In the present study, we sought to examine the role of
biologic fertility in determining family size in the USA. In addition, we
hypothesize that gender-associated differences in infertility etiology
may have differing effects on family size.

reproductive aged population of the USA living in households were sur-
veyed. The NSFG is a multistage probability sample designed to represent
the household population of USA women and men aged 15足45. The
survey is conducted to produce nationally representative data. In each
household, one member within the required age range was randomly
selected for recruitment. Certain groups, including black and Hispanic
adults, were sampled at higher rates to achieve adequate samples for gen-
erating nationally representative point estimates and power to examine
differences between racial and ethnic groups. All subjects provided
written consent for participation. The survey was available in both
English and Spanish. The overall response rate for the survey was 79%
(Mosher et al., 2005). Institutional Review Board approval was not
required for this secondary analysis of a de-identified national data set.
Description of variables
Outcome
The diagnosis of infertility was assessed with several questions adminis-
tered in the NSFG. Women were asked: `During any of your relationships,
have you or your (husband or) partner at the time ever been to a doctor
or other medical care provider to talk about ways to help you become
pregnant?' Infertility was coded as a dichotomous variable (yes/no).
Among those reporting the utilization of infertility care, duration of infer-
tility was determined by asking the follow-up question: `When you first
went for medical help, how many months or years had you [and your
(husband/partner)] been trying to become pregnant?' In addition, the
past infertility diagnosis was assessed by asking women who had sought
infertility care, `when you went for medical help to (become pregnant/
prevent miscarriage/to become pregnant and prevent miscarriage), were
you ever told that you or your husband or partner had any of the following
infertility problems: [p]roblems with ovulation, [b]locked tubes, [o]ther
tube or pelvic problems, [e]ndometriosis, [s]emen or sperm problems
or [a]ny other infertility problems.' Women who answered they had pro-
blems with ovulation, fallopian tubes or endometriosis were coded as
having female infertility. Those who answered sperm problems were
coded as having male factor infertility. Multiple diagnoses were not per-
mitted on the survey. In each case, those with male or female factor
were compared with all those without each respective factor in each
analysis.
Non-pregnant and non-surgically sterile women were also asked: `Some
women are not physically able to have children. As far as you know, is it
physically possible for you, yourself, to have (a/another) baby?' In addition,
women currently in a relationship were asked about the reproductive abil-
ities of their non-surgically sterile partners. `What about [husband/
partner]? As far as you know, is it physically possible for him to father a
baby in the future?' Both responses, which represent current difficulties,
were coded as dichotomous variables (yes/no).
For men, surveyors asked, `Did you or your wife ever go/Have you or
your wife ever been/During any of your relationships, have you or your
(wife or) partner at the time ever been to a doctor or other medical
care provider to talk about ways to help you have a baby together?' Non-
surgically sterile men were also asked `Some men are not physically able to
father children. As far as you know, is it physically possible for you, yourself
to biologically father a child in the future?' Those that responded affirma-
tively, were then asked, `Some men are physically able to father a child, but
would have difficulty doing so. As far as you know, would you have any
difficulty fathering a child?' Both variables, which represent current difficul-
ties, were coded dichotomously (yes/no). Infertility duration or diagnostic
specifics were not available from the male sample of the NSFG.
Given that many childless respondents had not actively pursued pro-
creation and reproductive intent can be difficult to ascertain, only survey
respondents with at least one child were included in the present fertile
sample.
Exposure
Demographic, socioeconomic and anthropomorphic characteristics were
analyzed to assess associations with fertility. Potential mediating and con-
founding variables were selected a priori. Variables were selected based on
items in the literature found to be associated with infertility. Variables ana-
lyzed included age at birth of first child (continuous), age (continuous),
number of siblings (continuous), current marital status (dichotomous--
yes/no), self-reported race/ethnicity (white, black, Hispanic, other), edu-
cational attainment (categorical--less than high school, high school/GED,
more than high school) and income level (categorical--,$24 999,
$25 000足49 999, .$50 000).
Data analysis
We developed our multivariate model to assess the relationship between
the diagnosis of infertility and family size. We did not select predictors for
inclusion based on bivariable screening as important confounding can
potentially be missed using this methodology (Sun et al., 1996). Logistic
regression models were utilized to determine the relationship between
infertility and having more than one child (one child versus two or more
children) or more than two children (one to two children versus three
or more children). Ordinal logistic models were used to assess the associ-
ation between infertility and having a larger family size (one versus two
versus three or more children). Comparisons between total offspring
numbers were assessed using x2 tests after categorizing total offspring
numbers (1, 2, 3+). All analyses accounted for the complex survey
design of the NSFG. All tests were two-sided, and a P-value of 0.05
was considered statistically significant. All calculations were performed
using Stata 10 (StataCorp LP, College Station, TX).
Results
From the female sample, a total of 4409 participants met inclusion cri-
teria of whom 10.2% were classified as infertile. A total of 1739 men
from the male sample were included, of whom 9.7% were classified as
infertile. Infertility was defined on the basis of having sought reproduc-
tive assistance or advice. Sociodemographic characteristics of female
NSFG respondents with at least one child are listed in Table I.
Women who reported seeking medical attention for fertility tended
to be older, white, more educated and higher earners than fertile
women. Infertile women were more likely to report a history of mar-
riage than fertile women (97.6% versus 80.4%, respectively). Infertile
women had fewer siblings (3.5+ 1.4 versus 3.8+ 1.7) and fewer chil-
dren (2.0 +1.0 versus 2.2+ 1.2, respectively). From the female
sample, 348 (11.2%) women reported their own difficulty having chil-
dren and 34 (2.4%) women reported that their husbands/partners
had difficulty siring offspring.
Characteristics of male NSFG respondents meeting inclusion criteria
are listed in Table II. Similar to female respondents, infertile males
were more often older, white, college educated and higher earners.
Infertile males were also more likely to have a history of marriage
(96.6% versus 83.5%, respectively). Infertile men had fewer siblings
(3.2 +1.4 versus 3.8+ 1.6) and fewer children (1.8+ 0.7 versus
2.1+ 1.2, respectively). From the male sample, 102 (5.3%) indicated
they could not father a child or it would be difficult to do so.
Using several measures of infertility, women who reported seeking
infertility advice or confirmed difficulty conceiving reported fewer

offspring. Similarly, women who reported that their husband/partner
would have difficulty fathering a child had fewer children (Table III).
Men who reported seeking reproductive advice and those who
could not father, or had difficulty in fathering, offspring also reported
lower offspring numbers (Table III).
A multivariable logistic regression model to assess the association
between the outcome of having more than one child, having more
than two children and having a larger family size (one versus two
versus three or more children) and infertility was examined
(Table IV). Within the female sample, seeking reproductive assistance
reduced the odds of having an additional child (OR 0.66, 95% CI
0.48足0.90). In addition, the point estimates suggest that seeking
reproductive advice reduces the odds of having more than two chil-
dren or a larger family, although those models did not reach statistical
significance. The odds of having a larger family and the odds of having a
second child are reduced for every additional 6 months of infertility
(OR 0.91, 95% CI 0.83足1.00; OR 0.89, 95% CI 0.81足0.97, respect-
ively). Interestingly, a diagnosis of male infertility reduces the odds of
having a second child (OR 0.34, 95% CI 0.15足0.75), whereas the diag-
nosis of female infertility reduced the odds to a lesser degree (OR
0.74, 95% CI 0.51足1.06). Combining both male factor and female
factor infertility into the same model did not significantly impact the
odds ratios for any assessment of family size. As a further analysis,
we directly compared women from couples with male factor infertility
to those with female factor infertility and found that women from
couples with male factor infertility reported significantly lower odds
of having a second child (OR 0.46, 95% CI 0.21足0.99). Although
the point estimates for overall family size (OR 0.59, 95% CI 0.25足
1.38) and having more than two children (OR 0.79, 95% CI 0.29足
2.19) also suggested smaller family sizes for those with male versus
female factor infertility, these tests did not reach statistical significance.
Women who reported their own difficulty having children as well as
difficulty for their husband/partner to father offspring had reduced
odds of having a larger family size (Table IV). Again, combining both
male factor and female factor infertility into the same model did not
significantly impact the odds ratios.
The male sample of the NSFG showed similar results. Men who
sought reproductive advice or reported difficulty or futility in siring off-
spring had a lower odds of a larger family size (Table IV).
Discussion
The current study corroborates past analysis of European data (Joffe
et al., 2009) in the USA establishing that time to pregnancy (TTP)
affects family size. In addition to evaluating TTP, the NSFG allowed
the analysis of the impact of an infertility evaluation. Patients who
sought medical help to achieve pregnancy or reported difficulty

having a child had fewer offspring. Given the impact that the definition
of infertility can have on such analyses (Guzick and Swan, 2006), inferti-
lity wasassessed in multiplewayswith similar results. In addition, the cur-
rent report is the first, to our knowledge, to suggest that male factor
infertility may have a larger impact on family size than female factor.
Many factors contribute to ultimate family size. Parental age at first
conception, income, education and relationship status are known to
affect number of offspring (Group, 2001; Joffe et al., 2006; Leridon
and Slama, 2008). Although it is well established that family size is at
least partially determined by sociodemographic factors, recent evidence
suggests that biologic causes may also be at play. Despite a possible
worldwide decline in semen quality, the contribution of such biologic
factors on final family size can be hard to determine, especially with
the increased use of fertility treatments (Sallmen et al., 2005). Joffe
et al. (2009) recently reported an association between biologic fertility
and familysize. The authors analyzed four European datasets with retro-
spective TTP data. Couples with a TTP of at least 12 months tended to
have smaller families. The odds ratio of not having a second child after a
TTP of 12 months was 1.8 and for not having a third child it was 1.6. The
authors were unable to state conclusively that the associations were the
sole and exclusive result of biologic factors. Joffe et al. surmised that
having struggled to get pregnant may have inhibited people from trying
again, and the emotional trauma of a miscarriage or stillbirth may
prevent a further attempt. In addition, births after a long TTP may be
associated with expensive infertility techniques which preclude repeated
attempts.
The current data suggest that male factor infertility may play a larger
role in determining family size than female factor infertility. Women
who confirmed their husband/partner had an abnormal semen analy-
sis had the smallest number of offspring (mean 1.5) of the several

Infertility and family size in the USA 2363
infertility definitions analyzed. In addition, when comparing point esti-
mates for the odds of larger family size, male factor infertility (assessed
by two separate means) universally had reduced estimates compared
with female factor infertility in both separate and combined models,
suggesting a larger impact.
The explanation for the impact of male factor infertility is uncertain.
It may be that biologic causes for male infertility are more difficult to
treat or perhaps treatment is less utilized than for female counter-
parts. Indeed, data from the NSFG suggest that fewer men than
women utilize reproductive services in the USA (Anderson et al.,
2009). As a male infertility diagnosis is known to negatively impact a
man's marital relations and personal quality of life, the emotional
burden may impede further reproductive efforts (Smith et al., 2009).
Regardless, the finding is intriguing in light of population-based data
suggesting that childless men are at an increased risk of prostatic or
testis cancers (Jacobsen et al., 2000; Giwercman et al., 2005;
Jorgensen et al., 2008). The current data suggest that men with
lower offspring numbers may, in fact, have impaired fertility. As
some investigators have suggested, impaired fertility may be a
marker for future disease in men (Jacobsen et al., 2000; Skakkebaek
et al., 2001; Jensen et al., 2009).
Certain limitations of the analysis warrant mention. By only including
respondents 45 years old and younger, some individuals may not have
reached their final family size. The analysis does not include individuals
with no children who maybe infertile and unaware as they have not
attempted to conceive (Greil et al., 2009). The survey also provides
limited data on wanted or ideal final family size and this analysis pre-
sumes that the respondents would have had the expected number
of additional children if possible. The data were accrued by survey
and as such are subject to measurement errors and consequent
biases. The data set did not provide details regarding the timing and
nature of the infertility evaluation and treatment. In particular, within
the male sample no information regarding TTP and the infertility etiol-
ogy was obtained. Moreover, the participants queried about specific
reproductive difficulties varied (i.e. surgically sterilized respondents
were excluded from the question about current reproductive ability)
and these differences in number could have complicated the compari-
sons between groups. It is impossible to determine to what extent
emotional factors such as miscarriage and infertility anxiety caused
individuals to stop trying to conceive and to what extent the cause
was biological. Financial stresses of infertility treatments may also
have caused respondents to stop trying to conceive. Furthermore,
the inclusion and exclusion criteria limited the overall number of par-
ticipants and lowered the power of the study.
Nevertheless, the current study used a population-based survey to
establish that a diagnosis of infertility and a longer TTP are associated
with reduced odds of having a larger family, implicating a biologic role
in the determination of family size in the USA. Moreover, male factor
infertility may have a larger impact on final family size than female
factor infertility.
