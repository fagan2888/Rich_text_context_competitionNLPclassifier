How A Changing Workforce
Affects Employer-Sponsored
Health Insurance
Projecting to 2008, this study sees modest declines in employer coverage as
the workforce changes.
by Gregory Acs and Linda J. Blumberg
Du r i n g m o s t o f t h e 19 90 s the
United States enjoyed a thriving econ-
omy marked by low unemployment
and rising incomes. Despite strong economic
growth, however, the share of Americans with
health insurance has actually fallen: In 1994,
82.7 percent of nonelderly persons had health
insurance, compared with 81.6 percent in
1998.1 Seventy-three percent of all workers
have coverage through their own employer or
through the employer of a family member.2
Thus, changes in the U.S. workforce have po-
tentially large consequences for workers' em-
ployer coverage and for health insurance cov-
erage in general.
Many factors affect the probability that a
worker has employer coverage. For example,
workers in small firms, young workers, and
lower-paid workers are all less likely to have
it than are older, higher-paid workers in larger
firms.3 Lower employer coverage rates result
from declines in offer and/or take-up rates.4
While research shows that changes in the
workforce cannot explain all of the changes in
employer-sponsored coverage, we can antici-
pate how certain changes in the distribution
of workers across jobs and in the demo-
graphic composition of the workforce may af-
fect this coverage in the future.5
Other factors--most notably, changes in
the level of health insurance premiums rela-
tive to income and the share of premiums paid
directly by workers--will also affect the
probability that employer coverage will be of-
fered and taken up. Although we do not have
direct measures of either premiums or work-
ers' share of premiums, we do include vari-
ables for firm size and industry in our models;
firm size and industry are highly correlated
with variations in workers' premium shares.6
Additionally, future expansions or contrac-
tions of eligibility for public programs may
also interact with the probability of having
employer coverage; these types of unforeseen
changes are not captured here.
Data And Definitions
For the bulk of our analyses, we use the Feb-
ruary 1997 Contingent Worker Supplement
(CWS) to the Census Bureau's Current Popu-
lation Survey (CPS) merged with data from
the 1997 March CPS. The March survey adds
information on workers' earnings and family in-
comes. Our sample, therefore, consists of those
workers who are included in both data sets.
The February 1997 CPS/CWS contains
data on a nationally representative sample of
workers and reports information on their em-
ployers' as well as on their own charac-
teristics. Unlike the March files, these supple-
ments ask whether the respondent's employer
offers health insurance and whether the
worker is eligible for coverage in addition to
the type of coverage held. The supplement is
the source for the variables used in these
analyses to identify each worker's coverage.

The February questions related to workers'
coverage refer to current coverage.
We draw a sample of workers (excluding
the self-employed) ages twenty-one to sixty-
four and examine their access to employer
coverage and whether they take up benefits
when offered. Note that our analysis excludes
the self-employed, all nonworking depend-
ents, and younger workers who may have cov-
erage through their parents' policies.
Forecasting
Coverage Rates
n Recent trends. In 1993,
68.6 percent of workers had
employer coverage in their
own name; by 1997 coverage
fell to 67.8 percent.7 The share
of workers covered through
spouses fell from 12 percent to
11 percent. Thus, on net, cover-
age fell from 80.6 percent to
78.7 percent over the four-year
period.8
n Forecast method. We
use a multivariate regressionframework to es-
timate the probability of insurance coverage
for all adult workers; we then use results from
a series of regressions to forecast coverage
rates under a set of assumptions about the
future composition of the workforce. This ap-
proach allows us to control for changes in
multiple characteristics simultaneously. We
take into account the probability of offer and
take-up of coverage from one's own employer
and through a spouse's employer (if any).
Estimating themultivariatemodel. We estimate
the likelihood of offer and take-up on using
linear probability models. Offer and take-up
models are estimated separately for workers
who are married to other workers (dual earn-
ers) and for workers who are single or have
nonworking spouses (single earners). We
take this approach because the decision to
take a job in a firm is strongly related to the
offer status of spousal coverage. Likewise, the
propensity to take up insurance may be af-
fected by the options available to the worker
through the spouse's employer.
Our models consist of six estimated equa-
tions, which are described in detail else-
where.9 Briefly, we estimate (1) the prob-
ability of a worker's being offered coverage by
his orher own employer (estimatedseparately
for single earners and dual earners); (2) the
probability of a worker's taking up his or her
own employer's coverage given the existence
of an offer (estimated separately for single
earners and dual earners); (3) the probability
that a worker's spouse is of-
fered coverage, given that the
worker does not have his or
her own coverage and is a dual
earner; and (4) the probability
that a worker is covered by his
or her spouse's employer cov-
erage, given that the worker
does not have coverage
through his or her own em-
ployer and has a working
spouse with a coverage offer.
Total employer coverage for
workers, then, is a weighted
average of the coverage rates of
workers in dual-earner and single-earner
families. The rate of own-employer coverage
is simply a product of offer and take-up, while
spousal coverage must take the spousal offer
and take-up into account as well as the prob-
ability that the worker does not have an offer
of coverage from his or her own employer.
Our equations include both firm- and
worker-specific information. This includes
the worker's occupation, sex, race/ethnicity,
age, marital status, education, wage rate, in-
come relative to the poverty line (in the case of
take-up), region of residence, job tenure (in
the case of offer), and part-time status, as well
as employer's industry and firm size.
To test the predictive accuracy of our
model, we used our estimated equations to
generate a "backcast" of coverage for workers
in 1993 (using the April 1993 CPS). This
yielded a predicted coverage rate within 0.2
percentage points of the actual 1993 rate.10

ethnicity, and age composition of the work-
force, we use two approaches. The first uses
information from the U.S. Bureau of Labor
Statistics (BLS). Every two years the BLS is-
sues its employment outlook for the coming
decade, providing forecasts of the occupa-
tional, industrial, and demographic structure
of the workforce. The most recent BLS projec-
tions are for the year 2008.11 We use the aver-
age annual rate of change in characteristics
implied by the BLS projections to compute
changes for our sample of workers.
To project most other workforce charac-
teristics, we use data from the CPS. Specifi-
cally, we examine how the distribution of
workers across firm-size groups, wage-rate
categories, family income categories, marital
status, and single- versus dual-earner house-
holds changed between 1993 and 1997. We
then extrapolate these trends to 2008.12 Fi-
nally, to project the share of workers who will
be working part time in 2008, we examine the
trend observed in the Survey of Income and
Program Participation (SIPP) between 1990
and 1996 and assume that this trend contin-
ues between 1997 and 2008.13
One concern with this approach is that we
use the same forecast rates of change for
workforce characteristics in all six of our
models. Consequently, we developed alterna-
tive predictions that allow us to generate in-
dependent projections for single earners, dual
earners, and dual earners without coverage
from their own employer. This model must
rely solely on CPS data because, not surpris-
ingly, the BLS does not provide projections for
the industries and occupations of each unique
set of workers. We assume that the CPS
trends between 1993 and 1997 continue
through 2008.
n Results.Our first model, using the com-
bination of BLS, CPS, and SIPP trends, indi-
cates that anticipated changes in the compo-
sition of the workforce, on net, will drive
down workers' employer-sponsored coverage
from 78.7 percent in 1997 to 77.6 percent in
2008. This translates into a coverage decline
of 1.3 million workers relative to coverage
rates' staying constant.14 Exhibit 1 reveals the
patterns underlying this modest forecast de-
cline. The model predicts that coverage
through a worker's own employer will fall for
workers in both single- and dual-earner
households and that coverage through a
spouse's plan will also fall. We forecast that
both the offer rate and the take-up rate will
decline among workers in single- and dual-
earner households; however, the offer rate ef-
fect is considerably stronger. Coverage
through a spouse is predicted to fall by the
smallest percentage, with all of the effect com-
ing through a decline in the offer rate.
Under our alternative forecast (Model 2),
which relies upon subgroup-specific trends
from the CPS, coverage will fall 6.1 percentage
points between 1997 and 2008. This translates
into a coverage decline of 6.9 million workers.
Own-employer coverage rates are predicted
to fall considerably more than the coverage
rate through a spouse. While offer-rate effects
dominate take-up effects for drops in own-
employer coverage, the drop in the take-up
rate dominates for spousal coverage.
Exhibit 2 allows us to see which socio-
demographic and workforce characteristics
contribute the most to the predicted changes
in coverage under each model.15 For the first
model, the largest absolute effects come from
work status and wages, both tending to de-
crease coverage over time. The number of
part-time workers is predicted to increase be-
tween 1997 and 2008, bringing with it lower
coverage rates. Changes in the wage distribu-
tion are predicted to lead to more higher- and
lower-wage earners (below $7.50 and above
$12 per hour in 1997 dollars), with a smaller
share of the workforce falling in the middle of
the distribution. The change with the largest
positive effect is an increase in education.
Also, a positive coverage effect comes from the
predicted increase in dual-earning couples.
For the second model, we can see that the
single largest effect by far is the negative im-
pact of the predicted increase in the share of
the workforce that is employed part time. As
noted previously, the implied CPS trend is so
large that we replaced it with the SIPP trend
in the first model. In the absence of this part-

time effect, the second model would have
yielded a predicted coverage rate of roughly
the same size as Model 1.
Conclusions And Policy
Implications
We find that the aging of the workforce, in-
creases in the marriage rate, changes in the
occupational distribution, and continued in-
creases in educational attainment are all likely
to increase rates of employer-sponsored cov-
erage. Changes in the racial/ethnic makeup of
the workforce, increases in the share of part-
time workers, changes in the wage distribu-
tion, andthe increasing proportion of workers
employed in smaller firms are likely to depress

rates of coverage. On net, our forecasts sug-
gest that changes in the composition of the
workforce are likely to lead to lower employer
coverage rates between 1997 and 2008. We
anticipate that the overall decline in coverage
resulting from changes in the composition of
the workforce will be relatively small.
Our models indicate that both offer and
take-up rates of employer coverage will tend
to decline in the coming years, with the per-
centage-point declines in offer rates tending
to be the larger factor. The single most impor-
tant detrimental trend affecting offer and
take-up is the rising share of part-time work-
ers in the labor force. Part-time workers are
far less likely than full-time workers are to be
offered employer coverage, and their often
modest incomes make the employee share of
any offered coverage less affordable.
Taking these conclusions into account, a
number of public policy approaches may be
considered. Financial incentives could be pro-
vided to encourage more employers to offer
coverage. However, the effects of such an ap-
proach are likely to be uneven, leaving many
without a viable source of coverage. Tighten-
ing Employee Retirement Income Security
Act (ERISA) regulations regarding which
workers must be offered benefits may well
bolster the situation of part-time workers in
the employer coverage system.
States and the federal government also
might consider developing alternative stable
and comprehensive sources of coverage for
workers and their dependents. Permitting
buy-ins to Medicaid and/or the State Chil-
dren's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) is
one option. Another possibility is the devel-
opment of organized purchasing entities for
those in the nongroup private insurance mar-
ket, coupled with reform of the insurance
regulations in this market. Such efforts would
be directed toward making the nongroup
market easier to navigate and better able to
serve those with higher-than-average health
risk, and providing individuals with the bene-
fits of administrative economies of scale and
purchasing power.
Public policies focusing on the affordabil-
ity of the employee share of employer cover-
age premiums may be able to counteract the
predicted decline in take-up. This might re-
quire subsidies to low- and moderate-income
workers for this purpose. The political diffi-
culty with such an approach is the trade-off
between policies that provide subsidy dollars
to those who probably would have taken up
coverage without the subsidy and policies
that exclude those with prior coverage while
subsidizing others with the same incomes.
Public costs will be lower under the latter ap-
proach, while the new coverage effect will, in
all likelihood, be significantly larger under the
former. Finally, a much more limited and low-
cost approach to expanding employer cover-
age involves public information campaigns.
These campaigns could target growing sub-
populations, such as Hispanics, who tend to
have lower take-up rates.
While our forecast declines
over an eleven-year period are not
alarming in and ofthemselves, it is
important to keep in mind that they assume
that the probability of coverage for any given
subgroup remains at its 1997 level. However, if
health insurance premiums begin to rise dra-
matically, as they did during the early 1990s,
the probabilities that a specific worker will be
offered coverage and will take up benefits are
both likely to decline. Similarly, if unemploy-
ment rises, firms may not feel a need to offer
health insurance to attract workers. If em-
ployer coverage among workers falls substan-
tially, coverage of dependents is also likely to
fall, and current public health insurance pro-
grams will be unable to fully compensate.

estimation, there were no data on tenure in the

13. We use SIPP data rather than CPS data because
projections of the share of workers working part
time in 2008 based on the trend observed in CPS
data between 1993 and 1997 imply that approxi-
mately 50 percent of the workforce would be
working part time by 2008, a projection that
seemed implausibly large. The sensitivity of the
model to this assumption is made clear when
this base forecast is compared with the alterna-
tive forecast. Actual workforce characteristics
for 1997 and predicted characteristics for 2008
appear in Acs and Blumberg, "Changes in the
Composition of the Workforce."
14. This assumes 113.6 million workers ages twenty-
one to sixty-four at a point in time in 2008.

on coverage, we find similar patterns of results.
