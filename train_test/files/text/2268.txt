Abstract This paper investigates the characteristics of US colleges and universities that
were early adopters of post-1970 academic growth fields. It examines hypotheses drawn
from four analytical perspectives on sources of organizational change: organizational
ecology, inter-institutional stratification, demographic composition, and historical tradi-
tions. Focusing on 20 ``newly established'' and ``emerging'' growth fields, we find strong
support for density-dependence and organizational size as influences on early adoption for
all fields, as well as support for institutional status variables as influences on the early
adoption of new liberal arts and basic sciences fields.

The world of institutionalized knowledge in US colleges and universities has been
changing dramatically over the last three decades. Higher education scholars have written
extensively about the rise of occupational-professional programs (Brint et al. 2005; Turner
and Bowen 1990), the responsiveness of universities to market signals and donor prefer-
ences in the development of new business and technology fields (see, e.g., Engell and
Dangerfield 2005; Geiger 2004; Kirp 2003; Washburn 2005); the rise of interdisciplinary
research and teaching (see, e.g., Brint et al. 2009; Jacobs and Frickel 2009; Klein 1996),
and the response of universities to the changing demographic characteristics of students
and faculty as an influence on the development of new ``culture and identity'' fields, such
as ethnic studies and women's studies (see, e.g., Boxer 1998; Frank et al. 1994; Rojas
2007; Tobias 1978).
In this paper, we examine the institutionalization of high-growth fields in US four-year
colleges and universities during the period, 1970­2006. The focus of the paper is on the

institutional locations of early adopters of these fields. From a sociological perspective, we
believe early adopters are more important than the first innovators of new fields. Inno-
vations that do not penetrate beyond a few schools are destined to fail, except perhaps as
very small niche cultures. Only when a field has a foothold in a broader stratum of
institutions is its future in academe relatively secure. The characteristics of early adopting
institutions are therefore important for understanding how the structure of academically
legitimated knowledge changes over time. Yet the existing literature on academic change
has not paid close attention to the types of institutions that are early adopters of new fields.
We will show that the mechanisms by which new fields diffuse within the US system
have much to do with competition effects within geographical contexts and with the
dominant role played by large, high-enrollment institutions that have the capacity to staff
new fields and to attract students to them. Special theories about status dynamics are
necessary, however, to fill out the analysis of diffusion of new arts and sciences fields.
These fields are fostered particularly by wealthier institutions with long traditions in the
arts and sciences and, in the case of socially incorporative fields (such as women's studies
and ethnic studies), also by public sector institutions.
Analytical perspectives on early adoptors
Our study is organized as a comparison of the explanatory power of four analytical per-
spectives. We develop hypotheses drawn from the literatures on organizational ecology,
inter-institutional stratification, demographic composition, and historical traditions. We do
not investigate all prominent perspectives on organizational change. With the exception of
two fields (computer/information science and communications), those discussed in this
paper show only partial diffusion through the system of US higher education during the
period of our study. Consequently, neo-institutional theory, which emphasizes the wide-
spread diffusion of dominant models through isomorphic processes (DiMaggio and Powell
1983), has little applicability to the topic of our analysis (cf. Morphew and Huisman 2002).
Organizational ecology
Organizational ecology explanations are based on the premise that the behavior of indi-
vidual organizations is shaped by opportunities and constraints in their environment, and
by the differential capacities of individual organizations to exploit opportunities and sur-
vive challenges (Hannan and Freeman 1989). For purposes of our analyses, we will treat
ecological niches as the geographical areas in which organizations compete.
One key insight of organizational ecology is that niches have ``carrying capacities'' that
place upper limits on the density (i.e. number of) organizations that can be sustained
(Carroll and Hannan 2000: 222­7). For this reason, larger places have the potential to
support more activities. Adoption rates, then, should be higher in geographical areas with
larger populations, all else being equal. A second insight is that founding (and failure) rates
of organizations (or programs) are density dependent. When there are very few other
organizations in a niche that display a feature, adoption rates are likely to be low because
organizations face great uncertainty about whether carrying capacity for a program exists.
The success of early adopters, however, demonstrates that carrying capacity is present in
the niche, and legitimates offering a competitive program. Hence, rate of new adoption
should be a positive function of the number of organizations that have already founded a
program. As the number of institutions in a niche offering a program increases toward the
564 High Educ (2011) 61:563­585
123
carrying capacity, competition for students and other resources grows, increasing barriers
to entry and decreasing expected marginal returns to offering the program. This dual
dynamic, legitimation and competition, suggests that the probability that an institution adds
a program will be a quadratic function of the density of that program in its niche--
increasing with density and decreasing with density squared (Carroll and Hannan 2000:
216­7).
The capacity of an organization to exploit new niche space, or to succeed despite
competition in a crowded one, can be a function of individual organizational characteristics
as well as the density of competing organizations. For higher education institutions, a
primary adaptive characteristic of interest is size (Blau 1994, Chap. 3). From an ecological
perspective, size is an indicator both of organizational carrying capacity and potential
student demand for new fields. Larger organizations have the capacity to hire and organize
faculty in ways that allow for the adoption of new fields and a heightened opportunity to
generate effective demand for courses and majors from their larger student bodies. For
these reasons, we expect that larger institutions will be more likely to adopt new programs.
Assuming the ceteris paribus condition in these and all succeeding hypotheses, we test
the following hypotheses:
H-1 Institutions located in larger population areas will be more likely to be early adopters
of new fields.
H-2 Institutions located in geographical areas in which a low proportion of institutions
have adopted a new field will be more likely to adopt the field.
H-3 Institutions located in geographical areas in which a high proportion of institutions
have adopted a new field will be less likely to adopt the field.
H-4 Larger institutions will be more likely to adopt new fields.
Inter-institutional stratification
Since Veblen (1899), sociologists and economists have recognized a distinction between
luxury and non-luxury goods. Social scientists have translated this distinction into
expectations about educational stratification. For Collins (1977, 2000), lower-status
institutions tend to focus on practical training in courses of study closely connected to jobs
and occupations, while higher-status institutions tend to focus on esoteric fields of study
distant from the labor market, the knowledge of which is embodied in complex linguistic
codes and modes of appreciation that require many years of study to understand and are
more likely to be found in families endowed with high levels of cultural capital (see also
Bourdieu 1984, 1988). Drawing on this work, we expect financially less secure and socially
less elite higher education institutions to be more likely to adopt new occupational-pro-
fessional fields, while financially more secure and socially more elite institutions will be
more likely to adopt new fields in the liberal arts and basic science disciplines.
Two primary indicators of institutional status in US higher education are wealth and
selectivity. Wealthy institutions have large endowments and high operating budgets per
student to support their educational and co-curricular missions. Selective institutions admit
only the most qualified of the many thousands of students who apply for admissions each
year. They are, in this respect, exclusive clubs to which the great majority of applicants
will not be admitted (Frank 1999; Karabel 2005) and consequently we expect them to focus
to a greater degree on status fields than practical fields. Moreover, students attending high-
status institutions are likely to have the resources and opportunities to delay training for
High Educ (2011) 61:563­585 565
123
their future jobs and occupations until graduate school, freeing them to study the liberal
arts and basic sciences (Zhang 2005).
Highest degree offered is another, more functional, source of status differentiation.
Doctoral-granting institutions play different roles and gain higher prestige in the academic
system than masters' and baccalaureate granting institutions, because, in addition to their
undergraduate teaching responsibilities, their faculties are the producers of new knowledge
and are active in the production of the next generation of scholars and scientists. Doctoral-
granting universities have shown a particularly strong historical emphasis on fields con-
nected to science and technology (Geiger 1993; Geiger and Sa 2005, 2008; Graham and
Diamond 1997). We expect doctoral-granting research universities to be associated with
early adoption of new science and technology fields, and bachelor's degree granting
institutions to be more likely to focus on well-established fields of study.
We test the following hypotheses:
H-5 Lower-status institutions will be more likely to adopt new occupational-professional
fields.
H-6 Higher-status institutions will be more likely to adopt new liberal arts and basic
science fields.
H-7 Doctoral-granting institutions will be more likely to adopt new science and tech-
nology fields.
Demographic composition
Two arguments have been made about demographic composition as a source of curricular
change. The first has focused on the elective affinity between the life experiences of
students from non-traditional groups and the rise of new curricula associated with those life
experiences. This approach has linked the life experiences of lower SES students to
preferences for more practical, job-relevant curricula (see, e.g., Cross 1971; Trow 1974)
and the life experiences of female students to preferences for study in the arts, social
services, and other historically sex-segregated fields (Jacobs 1996). A second argument is
based on accommodation to political pressures for representation. Recent literature has
pointed to the tendency of administrators to accommodate to the pressures of social
movement organizations and changing faculty values by offering new curricula attuned to
the interests of mobilized groups and progressive-minded faculty members (Boxer 1998;
Olzak and Kangas 2007; Rojas 2007).
In higher education, racial-ethnic minorities and women are two groups of special
interest. Since 1970, their numbers have grown dramatically as a proportion of under-
graduate students enrolled in higher education institutions (US Department of Education,
National Center for Education Statistics 2008: Table 226). Because members of racial-
ethnic minorities more often come from immigrant and working class backgrounds, we
expect that higher proportions of these students will be associated with early adoption of
new occupational-professional fields, Because women have historically pursued (and been
limited to) sex-typed occupations, we expect that higher proportions of women students
will be associated with early adoption of sex-segregated fields in which women are more
numerous (such as those in the arts and social services) and perhaps also reduced support
for traditionally male fields (such as those in engineering and physical sciences). Following
the second argument, we expect higher proportions of women and minorities to be asso-
ciated with the adoption of women's studies and ethnic studies, respectively.

We test the following hypotheses:
H-8 Institutions enrolling higher proportions of minority students will be associated with
early adoption of new occupational-professional fields.
H-9 Institutions enrolling higher proportions of female students will be associated with
early adoption of historically female-dominated fields.
H-10 Institutions enrolling higher proportions of female students will be associated with
early adoption of women's studies.
H-11 Institutions enrolling higher proportions of under-represented minority students
will be associated with early adoption of ethnic studies.
Historical traditions
Historical traditions are often cited as forces encouraging the reproduction of existing
structures and as value-based restraints on change. Sociologists have emphasized the
importance of values embedded in leaders (Selznick 1957), organizational sagas (Clark
1970), and ritual categories (Meyer and Rowan 1977) as bases of structural
reproduction.
Two historical traditions are particularly important in US higher education. Liberal
arts colleges and universities have been closely connected to the training of elites from
the time of the colonial colleges (Baltzell 1964; Horowitz 1987). Today, not all insti-
tutions with commitments to the liberal arts and basic sciences are high-status; instead,
small religiously-affiliated colleges are among the most likely to maintain these com-
mitments (Brint et al. 2009). We expect that institutions with historical commitments to
the liberal arts and basic sciences model will be more likely to welcome new arts and
sciences fields.
Public universities in the land-grant tradition have had the opposite orientation from
liberal arts colleges; they were constituted to provide practical training for men and women
in agricultural and industrial occupations and were intended to be open to students from all
social strata (Nevins 1962). Over time, the land grant tradition has become generalized
throughout the public sector insofar as public universities present themselves as addressing
the needs of the state and the economy for educated labor (Brint 2007; Geiger and Sa
2008). We consequently expect that public universities, as compared to private institutions,
will be particularly receptive to new occupational-professional fields, and particularly
receptive to new science and technology fields.
While historical traditions predispose institutions to maintain value commitments,
brand-new institutions have no such loyalties. Following Stinchcombe (1965), we expect
that absence of historical traditions will predispose institutions born after the beginning
date of the time series to be more receptive to the high-growth fields of the era.
We test the following hypotheses:
H-12 Institutions historically committed to the liberal arts and sciences tradition will be
associated with early adoption of new fields in the arts and sciences.
H-13 Public control will be associated with early adoption of new occupational-pro-
fessional fields, and particularly with early adoption of new science and technology fields.
H-14 Institutions born during the period of the study will be associated with early
adoption of new fields.

Data and methods
Study population
We examined the adoption of fields in the core institutions in the US higher education
system. We define ``core institutions'' as 4-year colleges and universities which offer a
range of baccalaureate degrees, rather than degrees in only a small set of related programs.
We therefore do not include specialized institutions, such as art schools, business colleges
and seminaries. We also do not include for-profit institutions. The number of institutions in
our population of core institutions increased by 200 during the 35-year period, from 1265
to 1465, while the number of the baccalaureate degrees core institutions awarded annually
increased from nearly 800,000 to more than 1.3 million.
Defining established and emerging growth fields
We examine the characteristics of institutions that offered undergraduate degrees in two
types of high-growth fields during the period: (1) those that had become established by the
end of the period and (2) those that had not yet become established, but had experienced
comparable levels of growth. We refer to these as newly established and emerging fields,
respectively.
We are interested in fields that demonstrated significant growth during our period of
observation and, at the same, diffused relatively widely during the period. We define newly
established fields as those that were offered by 20 percent or fewer institutions in
1970­1971, grew to include at least 10 percent more institutions during the period, and
were offered by 20 percent or more of institutions in 2005­2006. We consider the 20
percent threshold a good marker that a field has ``arrived'' in academe, or, as some would
say, reached the ``take-off'' point to sustainability (Rostow 1963). We define emerging
fields as those that grew to include at least 10 percent more institutions during the study
period, but continued to be offered at fewer than 20 percent of institutions by the last year
in the study. We examine emerging fields because they showed the same minimal levels of
growth during the period and, although not yet fully established, show sufficient growth to
suggest that they may become established fields of the future.
Our field categorizations are based on HEGIS/IPEDS degree files, coded at 5 year
intervals from 1970­1971 through 2005­2006. Higher education data was collected in the
Higher Education General Information Survey (HEGIS) during the first two panel years.
This data was collected in the Integrated Post-Secondary Educational Data System
(IPEDS) in the last six panel years. From the initial HEGIS coding scheme, which existed
in 1970­1971 and 1975­1976, field coding changed in four of our panel years: 1980­1981,
1985­1986, 1990­1991, and 2000­2001. In the process of degree differentiation during the
period, the number of fields represented at the bachelor's level grew from 319 to 935.
These changes required extensive work to align fields between the five categorizing
schemes. We aggregated categories from later periods to match as closely as possible those
used in earlier periods, using HEGIS and IPEDS crosswalks.1 In addition, we aggregated
1 During the early years of our time series, for example, multi-disciplinary studies were exclusively focused
on engineering specialties. This category expanded in later years of the series, but the coding in earlier years
prevents direct comparisons. We were therefore unable to analyze the institutional locations of this 15th
high-growth field, multi-/interdisciplinary studies, due to the federal government's exclusive classification
of engineering subspecialties as interdisciplinary during the first years of the series.

closely connected fields so as to improve the statistical power of our analyses. For
example, in the earlier period, all forms of sales and marketing were treated as an
undifferentiated field. By the end of the period, a wide range of marketing degrees had
been defined. We consequently aggregated all marketing fields (e.g., fashion marketing,
travel and tourism marketing, automobile marketing, and marketing, general) to form a
single ``marketing'' category.2
Dependent variables
We are interested in defining the types of institutions that provide the organizational base
for new academic fields. Our unit of analysis is consequently the institution. We focus on
defining the characteristics of early adopters of newly-established fields and adopters of
emerging fields, and we use logistic regression and correspondence analysis to distinguish
the characteristics of early adopters from those of late and/or non-adopters.3
We define early adopters as the first 20 percent of institutions (±2 percent) to offer
degrees in the field. We measure early adoption from the date at which this 20 percent
threshold was reached. The early adoption date, therefore, varies from field to field, as
indicated in Table 1. We chose the 20 percent threshold partially on practical grounds.
During our panel years, we were able to define a 20 percent threshold (±2 percent) for all
newly-established fields. We were not able to define a lower or higher threshold as pre-
cisely. Statistical and conceptual issues also influenced our choice of threshold. Statisti-
cally, the 20 percent threshold is preferable to lower thresholds because it allows for more
robust analysis with lower standard errors around parameter estimates.4 Conceptually,
higher thresholds, such as 25 percent, seemed to us to define groups of institutions larger
than that implied by the term ``early adopters.''
For the newly-established fields, we compare the characteristics of early adopters to
those of late and non-adopters, using the threshold year as the reference point. We examine
the explanatory power of variables linked to each of the four interpretive frameworks--
organizational ecology, inter-institutional stratification, demographic composition, and
historical traditions--based on the hypotheses stated above. All measurements are taken at
the date the field reached 20 percent diffusion. For emerging fields, we focus on whether or
not institutions had ever adopted the field by 2005­2006. Again, we examine the
explanatory power of variables linked to each of the four interpretive frameworks.
Newly-established and emerging fields, 1970­2006
Table 1 provides an overview of 14 newly established5 (panel A) and six emerging (panel
B) fields during the period of our study.
2 A table of correspondence is available on request.
3 We do not pool the data or use general estimating equations to predict diffusion patterns, because we are
not interested in explaining diffusion curves. The speed of diffusion is a separate topic. The fields in this
study include a few that diffused rapidly (e.g. computer/information science and communications) during
the period and a few that showed only a slow rise to the 20 percent threshold or just beyond (e.g. applied
design and international relations).
4 Findings for emerging fields (see below) suggest that the same general pattern of organizational effects
would have emerged had we adopted a 15 percent threshold for the newly-established fields.
5 Communications is a borderline case. It had been adopted by just over 20 percent of institutions in
1970­1971. We include it because it is very close to our threshold and is one of the fastest-growing fields
during the period.

Nine of the 14 newly-established fields during the period were occupational-profes-
sional; they are typically oriented to training students for employment in occupations.6 In
order of their rates of institutionalization during the period, these fields were: computer/
information science, parks and recreation, criminal justice, marketing, social work, man-
agement information systems, nursing, applied design, and banking and finance. State-
based and social service fields (criminal justice, social work, nursing, and parks and
recreation) were as numerous as business and technology fields (computer science, mar-
keting, management information systems, and banking/finance). We also see the influence
of gender in these fields. Three of the fields (nursing, social work, and applied design) have
been female-dominated fields.
Arts and sciences fields, while less numerous, were not entirely absent. Five of the 14
were arts and sciences fields--that is, they expose students to a basic field of knowledge.
In order of their rates of institutionalization during the period, these fields were

communications,7 general studies, environmental science, cell and molecular biology, and
international relations. General studies is a special case; although nominally arts and
sciences, it has become used by colleges and universities as a multi-option ``catch-all''
major, often taken by students who struggle to succeed in traditional majors.
In addition, four of the six emerging fields were occupational-professional. In order of
their rates of institutionalization, these were: international business, computer engineering,
health administration, and public policy/public administration. Here too state-based fields
(health administration and public policy/public administration) were as numerous as business
or technology fields (international business and computer engineering). Two new culture and
identity fields (women's studies and ethnic studies) were among the emerging fields.
Each of the occupational-professional fields creates a perceived pathway into primary
sector occupations, whether in business, the state, or the health care system. The repre-
sentation of arts and sciences fields demonstrates the continued relevance of the idea that,
as culture producing institutions, colleges and universities have some autonomy from state
and economy, and the substance of these fields helps to delineate the contemporary content
and meaning of the phrase ``some autonomy.'' Some high-growth arts and sciences fields
have at least distant links to media or technology industries (communications, environ-
mental science, cell and molecular biology); others to social movement organizations and
demographic change (environmental studies again, as well as women's and ethnic studies);
and still others to processes of globalization (international relations).
Independent variables
For purposes of predicting the locations of early adopters of newly-established and
emerging fields, we measured four organizational ecology variables. Population is a
measure of the carrying capacity of the institution's immediate geographical region. The
term ``core based statistical area'' (CBSA) became effective in 2000 and refers collectively
to metropolitan and micropolitan statistical areas (US Department of Education, National
Center for Education Statistics 2009). We use CBSAs to define boundaries of the geo-
graphical space in which higher education organizations compete. We measured popula-
tion retrospectively from the population of counties in the CBSA in which the organization
resided. Two variables measure the coverage of a field within the geographical space
defined by CBSAs. Adopting in Region is a measure of the number of higher education
institutions within the CBSA that had adopted the field by its early adoption date (or, in the
case of emerging fields, by the last year in the time series). We coded the number of
institutions in each CBSA by locating institutions within counties covered by CBSAs. We
coded the number of institutions adopting a program based on IPEDS data on degrees
awarded in our target fields. Adopting in Region Squared is a measure of saturation. If most
institutions within the organization's geographical frame have already adopted a field, the
organization may not experience sufficient niche space to adopt. Enrollment is a measure
of an organization's carrying capacity and potential demand for new fields. We measured
size as total headcount enrollment from HEGIS/IPEDS enrollment data.
We measured four inter-institutional stratification variables corresponding to dimen-
sions of hierarchical differentiation within the structure of US four-year colleges and
7 Although some communications curricula provide practical training for technical positions in the mass
media industries, communications is primarily a liberal arts discipline in which most courses focus on
rhetoric, communications practices in different institutional settings and cultures, public opinion, and the
organization and consequences of mass media industries (Bertelsen and Goodboy 2009; Wardrope 1999).

universities. Operating budget per student is a measure of organizational wealth. It is
computed from HEGIS/IPEDS financial data, divided by headcount enrollment.8 We
removed hospitals and independent operations from operating expenditures so as to focus
on expenditures more closely connected to the quality of the undergraduate experience.9
Selectivity is measured from the Barron's admissions selector index. Barron's index is
based on acceptance rates for freshmen applicants, as well as freshman students' high
school ranks, grade point averages, and median SAT/ACT scores. The most competitive
institutions have the lowest acceptance rates. Barron's applies only qualitative labels to its
rankings, ranging from ``most competitive'' to ``non-competitive.'' We assigned numeric
values to these labels for the purpose of analysis, with one denoting the least selective and
six denoting the most selective institutions.10 Doctoral granting is a measure of position
within the functional hierarchy of higher education institutions. Doctoral granting insti-
tutions are defined as institutions awarding at least 30 doctoral degrees in a year. The 30
doctorate cutoff is adapted from Snyder and Hoffman's (2005) approach to generalizing
the Carnegie Classification.11 Masters' granting institutions are defined as institutions
awarding at least 30 masters degrees in a year and serve as the reference category. Bac-
calaureate granting institutions comprise the remaining institutions. They offer fewer than
30 masters degrees a year, again following Snyder and Hoffman (2005).
We measured two demographic characteristics of student bodies from HEGIS/IPEDS
enrollment data. Percent minority is a continuous variable measured as non-white students
as a proportion of total enrollment. Percent female is a continuous variable measured as
women students as a proportion of total enrollment.12 We included as a control variable
Percent international, a continuous variable measured as proportion of international stu-
dents to total enrollment. We assumed that this variable might show net significant
associations with early adopters of international fields.
We measured three variables related to historical traditions. Percent Liberal Arts 1970
is a measure of an institution's commitment to the traditional arts and sciences in the first
year of the time series. This is a continuous variable coded from HEGIS/IPEDS degree
data measured as the proportion of total degrees awarded in the arts and sciences, as
opposed to occupational-professional fields, in the first year of our time series. We identify

valid comparisons could be made following the changes in accounting rules for private universities in 1997.
For total expenses, lines E19 (FASB reporters) and C19 (for GASB reporters) are comparable (Bowen,
personal communication).
9 Market value of endowment is another commonly used measure of wealth. Previous work (reference
masked) indicates that operating budget/student and market value of endowment are highly correlated
(above r = .8). Moreover, considerably more missing data exists on market value of endowment than on
operating budget/student.
10 The years in the Barron's series are as follows: 1972, 1976, 1982, 1986, 1992, 1997, 1999, and 2007. The
codes are contained in Fine (1972) and College Division of Barron's Educational Series (1976, 1982, 1986,
1992, 1997, 1999, 2007). We imputed values for the closest year of Barron's and our panel years.
11 The Carnegie Classification itself changed six times during the period of the study. Highest degree
awarded has been a consistent element of the Carnegie Classification, but other elements have varied
considerably across classification years. Although we find several of these classifications more informative
than highest degree awarded, we were unable to reproduce what we consider the best of the classifications,
Carnegie 1994, for earlier or later years in the series.
12 In separate analyses, we broke out historically black colleges and universities and all-women's colleges.
Model efficiency, as measured by the Bayesian Information Criterion, was lower in the large majority of
cases (22 of 26), and we consequently report models without these variables. The results of these analyses
are available on request.

institutions awarding high proportions of degrees in arts and sciences as historically
connected to the liberal arts tradition. Public is a categorical variable measuring form of
control and coded from HEGIS/IPEDS institutional characteristics. Emerged identifies
institutions born after the beginning of the period of our study. This variable measures
absence, rather than presence, of historical traditions. The variable is coded by eliminating
degree-granting institutions appearing at the beginning of the period from those appearing
at the end of the period. We included the variable Died as a control variable. These
institutions appeared in HEGIS/IPEDS at the beginning of the time series, but no longer
appeared by the end of the period.13 Descriptive statistics on the independent variables in
this analysis are provided in ``Appendix A''.
Methods
Our first analysis is based on logistic regression, where the dependent variable is categorical
and ``1'' is defined as an early adopting institution, or, in the case of emerging fields, an
ever-adopting institution. We conducted these logistic regressions on each of the 20 fields.
We used correspondence analysis to complement the results of the logistic regressions.
Correspondence analysis is a method of factoring variables and displaying them in a
property space which maps their association in two or more dimensions (Clausen 1998).
Rather than examining patterns of predictors across fields, this analysis forces predictors to
align with particular fields, thereby indicating particularly strong affinities between insti-
tutional characteristics and academic fields.14
For the correspondence analysis, we reran logistic regressions to isolate only institu-
tional characteristics for the set of institutions that existed throughout the period of the
study. This approach avoids the difficulties of relating intrinsically relational (Adopting in
Region and Adopting in Region Squared) and extra-institutional data (Population) to the
correspondence between types of institutions and types of fields. The resulting visual
representations provide a more sharply focused map of the correspondence of types of
institutions and types of fields in two-dimensional space.
Results
We discuss results from the regression analyses first, followed by results from the corre-
spondence analysis. Regression results for occupational-professional fields were different,
in important respects, from results for arts and sciences fields. We therefore report results
for occupational-professional fields in Table 2 and arts and sciences fields in Table 3.
13 Reliance on IPEDS data may result in a small amount of measurement error in the emerged and died
variables. Institutions may be reclassified for technical reasons as entirely new institutions by IPEDS if they
are continuing under a different name or governing authority or have begun to admit new populations of
students. Similarly, institutions may be treated as defunct because they did not, for whatever reason, report
data to IPEDS in the final panel year. An independent examination of emerged and died institutions using
Internet resources identified several ambiguous cases.
14 In the analysis, we normalized the rows (predictors) and columns (fields) separately, and we found the
singular values and eigenvalues of the matrix. We then scored and plotted the predictor variables and the
fields on the first two singular values or eigenvectors. The analysis included both continuous and categorical
variables. The method used for scaling gives approximately equal weight to the variation across predictor
variables and to the variation across fields. Correspondence analyses were computed with UCINET 6.162
(Borgatti et al. (2002), using the Carroll-Green-Schaeffer transformation (Carroll et al. 1986, 1987). For a
discussion of this approach and an alternative to it, see Faust (2005).

Results from the regression analyses
Ecological variables were strongly associated with early adoption across all 20 fields.
Relatively large numbers of adopting institutions within the geographical area defined by
the CBSA were associated with consistent and strong odds of adopting new fields, whether
occupational-professional or arts and sciences. The squared term was also strongly asso-
ciated with lower levels of adoption, indicating that within CBSAs when niche space is
filled beyond a certain point no further adoption of fields is likely. Equally important,
larger enrollment institutions were consistently and strongly associated with adoption of
new fields, both in occupational-professional and arts and sciences fields. These results
indicate that larger institutions have the carrying capacity to support new fields and may
have the incentive as well to support them to cater to student (or potential student) interest
on campus. Population was the only ecological variable that failed to show strong asso-
ciations with the adoption of new fields. Indeed, larger population areas were frequently
associated with lower probabilities of adoption, controlling for other significant covariates
in the model. This suggests that the state of competition of organizations within a geo-
graphic area is the key to change, rather than the population of the area or even the sheer
number of organizations competing in the area.
Institutional wealth, as measured by operating budget/student, showed the expected net
associations with high-growth arts and sciences fields (other than international relations
and the special case of general studies); it also showed significant negative net associations
with several occupational-professional fields, particularly with new business fields.
Wealthy institutions were very likely to adopt socially incorporative new culture and
identity fields (ethnic studies and women's studies). These results indicate that institutional
wealth is associated, as predicted, with a focus on status fields, and less often with a focus
on practical, job-related fields. Similarly, as hypothesized, institutions with high levels of
commitment to arts and sciences in 1970 were more likely to be early adopters of most new
arts and sciences fields. They were also less likely to be adopters of new occupational-
professional fields. We found little support, however, for selectivity as an influence on the
adoption of arts and sciences fields. Instead, we found some evidence for it as a barrier to
the adoption of new occupational-professional fields.
As hypothesized, baccalaureate-granting institutions were averse to adopting new fields.
However, counter to our hypothesis, doctoral granting institutions were not consistently
more likely to adopt new science and technology fields and instead were more likely to
adopt new business fields. Nor were public institutions consistently more likely to adopt
new science and technology fields, as we expected based on their land-grant origins.
Instead, they were more likely to adopt the emerging culture and identity fields of women's
and ethnic studies, indicating a special relationship between contemporary public sector
institutions and historically marginalized population groups.
As hypothesized, institutions enrolling high proportions of women were more likely to
adopt fields related to women's traditional occupational locations. Institutions enrolling
high proportions of women also showed a tendency to avoid some technical fields, notably
computer engineering. However, institutions enrolling higher proportions of minority
students were less likely to adopt new occupational-professional fields, rather than more
likely to do so. It is possible that these institutions seek the legitimacy and prestige of long-
established fields, rather than adopting the jobs-oriented practical approach we
hypothesized.
Finally, institutions born during the study period showed no preference for the high-
growth academic fields of the period.

Thus, we found consistent and strong support for hypotheses 2­4 (density dependence
and size as influences on the early adoption of all new fields). We also found substantial
support for hypotheses 5­6 (status effects on the early adoption of new arts and sciences
fields), hypotheses 9­11 (proportion of women as an influence on the early adoption of
female-dominated fields and the relation between demographic categories and the early
adoption of women's and ethnic studies), as well as hypothesis 12 (arts and sciences
tradition as an influence on the early adoption of new arts and sciences fields).
We found little or no support for the other hypotheses.
Results from the correspondence analysis
The correspondence analysis showed a good fit in two dimensions, with the first two
dimensions accounting for 77 percent of the variance and the third dimension adding little.
As depicted in Fig. 1, one dimension in the correspondence analysis defined what we
can conceive of as a ``social change'' vs. ``corporate business'' division linked to public and
private institutions, respectively. Thus, the left-right axis in the correspondence analysis
showed distinct affinities between public institutions and what we might term ``social
movement fields'' (ethnic studies, women's studies, and environmental studies). It also

showed affinities between private institutions and several higher-income business and
technology fields (finance, management information systems, marketing, international
business, health administration, and computer engineering). The second dimension defined
what we can conceive of as a ``low-technology'' vs. ``high-technology'' division linked
most closely to doctoral and baccalaureate-granting institutions, respectively. Thus, the
upper right sector showed a clustering of computer engineering, finance, and health
administration closely associated with doctoral granting institutions, and the lower left
sector showed a clustering of criminology, general studies, environmental studies, and
parks and recreation most closely associated with baccalaureate granting institutions.
Discussion
The primary contribution of this paper has been to test hypotheses drawn from four
perspectives on the dynamics of organizational change in higher education. The separate
cross-sectional portraits we develop of early adopters, when examined together, open a
window onto locations in the system that are receptive to new fields and also reveal some
important patterns through which new fields diffuse in the system.
The diffusion of new fields is rarely system-wide. Among 14 newly established fields,
only two (computer/information science and communications) diffused to even half of 4-
year colleges and universities by 2005­2006. Given this reality of partial and limited
diffusion, the questions social scientists ask about academic change should be mainly about
which types of institutions will be most receptive to new fields--and why?
We can answer these questions by focusing on consistent and strong net associations in
the data, as reported in Tables 2 and 3. One part of the answer to these questions is that
larger organizations are receptive to a wide range of new fields. As shown in the logistic
regression results, high enrollment institutions were consistently and often strongly asso-
ciated with early adoption of each one of the 20 growth fields in this study. Large orga-
nizations have the carrying capacity and the potential student markets to try out new fields,
and they are receptive both to new occupational-professional and new arts and sciences
fields. They are, in this sense, the academic omnivores. Without large organizations, less
innovation would likely exist in the system, because too few institutions would have the
critical mass to adopt emerging fields, or the assurance of enough students to support
courses and majors offered in these new fields.
Second, the logistic regression results show that the dynamics of competition within
geographical regions are very important to processes of diffusion. Encouraged by pio-
neering institutions, other institutions within a geographical area join to adopt new fields in
order to compete for students interested in the field. We found consistent and strong
influences of density dependence in these analyses, with a larger number of adopting
institutions associated with higher likelihoods of early adoption. Once perceived saturation
in a geographic area is reached, however, adoption slows down dramatically or ceases.
Accordingly, we also found strong and consistent effects for the squared term of adopting
institutions in a region.
Another part of the answer to these questions is that institutional status is consequential.
Wealthier colleges and universities tended to support new arts and sciences fields and to
resist early adoption of new occupational-professional fields. Institutions whose historical
traditions favored the arts and sciences showed similar tendencies. The trend toward the
growth of the ``practical arts'' in US higher education (Brint 2002) is consequently con-
strained, to some degree, by prestigious institutions that occupy dominant market positions

and by historical traditions that distance institutions from the utilitarian, job-preparation
interests of most undergraduate students and their parents (Astin 1998). This creates a
counter-balance within a system otherwise favoring new occupational-professional fields
and, together with omnivorous large institutions, additional sources for fostering new arts
and sciences fields.
Finally, our findings point to potential institutional challenges facing new science and
technology fields. Some traditional bastions of these fields are no longer consistently
among their early adopters. Doctoral institutions showed more consistent net associations
with early adoption of new business fields than with early adoption of new science and
technology fields.15 Public universities showed more consistent net associations with early
adoption of socially incorporative new culture and identity fields than with early adoption
of new science and technology fields. Institutions enrolling higher proportions of women
and minorities also showed lower levels of early adoption of new science and technology
fields, a factor of interest because these two groups are the fastest-growing in US higher
education.
Many commentators have pointed to the significance of new science and technology
fields as engines of economic growth (see, e.g., Bush and 1990 [1945]; Drori et al. 2003;
Geiger 1993; Geiger and Sa 2008; Graham and Diamond 1997; Kerr 1963). Our findings
suggest under-appreciated institutional factors--the interest of doctoral institutions in
business fields, the interest of public sector institutions in socially incorporative fields, and
the weak scientific interests of many institutions enrolling high proportions of women and
minorities--which may affect preparation for and diffusion of new science and technology
fields in US four-year colleges and universities.

15 Some have hypothesized that this change in orientation among doctoral granting institutions reflects the
exodus of mathematically inclined students into banking, finance, and other remunerative business fields
(Chang et al. 2007).
