Hypertension Incidence and Education Vargas et al.
Incidence of Hypertension and Educational Attainment
The NHANES I Epidemiologic Followup Study
Clemencia M. Vargas, Deborah D. Ingram, and Richard F. Gillum
Previous research has demonstrated the association between cardiovascular disease and education.
However, few studies have described the incidence of hypertension, a risk factor for cardiovascular disease, by
education or other socioeconomic status indicators.To examine the association between hypertension incidence
and education, the authors analyzed data from the First National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES I) Epidemiologic Followup Study (NHEFS) (1971­1984). The relative risk of hypertension incidence
(blood pressure  160/95 and/or using antihypertensive medication) by education was calculated for non-
Hispanic Whites (aged 25­64 years) and non-Hispanic Blacks (aged 25­44 years) normotensive at baseline
using Cox proportional hazards models. The age-adjusted relative risk of hypertension incidence among
persons with less than 12 years of education compared with those with more than 12 years was significant
among non-Hispanic Whites aged 25­44 years (men: relative risk (RR) = 2.14, 95% confidence interval (CI):
1.29, 3.54; women: RR = 2.06, 95% CI: 1.39, 3.05) but not among non-Hispanic Blacks (RR = 1.16, 95% CI:
0.63, 2.14). Relative risks for non-Hispanic White men remained stable after adjusting for age, systolic blood
pressure, body mass index, and region of residence; relative risks for non-Hispanic White women were reduced
but remained significant. Non-Hispanic White men and women aged 45­64 years with less than 12 years of
education were not at higher risk of developing hypertension compared with their more educated counterparts.
These results demonstrate a significant interaction between age and education with an independent association
between education and hypertension incidence among younger but not older non-Hispanic White men and
women. Am J Epidemiol 2000;152:272­8.

This paper was presented during the 4th International
Conference on Preventive Cardiology, June 1997, Montreal,
Canada.
Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in the
United States (1). The negative association of cardiovascu-
lar disease morbidity and mortality with socioeconomic sta-
tus has been demonstrated by several studies (2­10). These
studies have shown that individuals with lower socioeco-
nomic status, as measured by education and/or occupation,
are more likely to have cardiovascular disease than are indi-
viduals with higher socioeconomic status. Even though
hypertension is one of the main risk factors for cardiovascu-
lar disease, a review of the literature shows few studies of
hypertension incidence (11­15) and even fewer studies of
the association between hypertension incidence and educa-
tion or other indicators of socioeconomic status (16­20). A
study of Blacks in Charleston, South Carolina, found that
hypertension incidence was inversely associated with social
class as measured by education and occupation (16, 18);
another study of inner city Blacks found that hypertension
incidence was associated with income but not with educa-
tion or occupation (17). The First National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES I) Epidemiologic
Followup Study (NHEFS) is the only longitudinal nationally
representative survey of the US population that permits the
analysis of hypertension incidence by sociodemographic
characteristics. Waitzman and Smith (20) and Ford and
Cooper (19) used the NHEFS to study the incidence of
hypertension. Waitzman and Smith (20) analyzed the inci-
dence of hypertension among men by occupational mobil-
ity; they found that hypertension incidence was higher
among men who were from lower occupational classes or
those who moved to lower occupational classes than among
their counterparts. Ford and Cooper (19) studied the relation
between incidence of hypertension and several sociodemo-
graphic, behavioral, and biochemical factors among persons
25 years of age and over. They found a significant bivariate
association between the incidence of hypertension and edu-
cational attainment among White men, White women, and
Black women. After controlling for diverse covariates, this
association remained significant only among White women.
Hypertension Incidence and Education 273
Am J Epidemiol Vol. 152, No. 3, 2000
In this study we use data from the NHEFS to extend these
findings by exploring how the association of educational
attainment and incidence of hypertension among men and
women varies with age and other possible effect modifiers.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study population
The NHANES I collected data in 1971­1975 on a nation-
wide, multistage, probability sample of the civilian non-
institutionalized US population aged 1­74 years, excluding
Alaska, Hawaii, and reservation lands of American Indians.
Details of the plan, complex survey design, response rates,
and operation were published previously (21). The elderly,
women of child-bearing age, and persons living in poverty
areas were oversampled. Data were collected through per-
sonal interview, physical examination, and laboratory analy-
ses. The NHEFS is a longitudinal study of participants in the
NHANES I who were 25­74 years of age at the time of the
survey examination in 1971­1975 (22). The personal inter-
views and physical and laboratory examinations of the
NHANES I provided the baseline data for the NHEFS. This
analysis is based on the first wave of follow-up during
1982­1984, because this was the only wave that included
blood pressure measurements.
This analysis includes non-Hispanic White persons who
were 25­64 years of age at baseline and non-Hispanic Black
persons who were 25­44 years of age. Persons from
racial/ethnic groups other than non-Hispanic White and
non-Hispanic Black were excluded because sample sizes
were too small to make separate estimates. Elderly persons
(65 years of age and over) were not included in the analysis,
because almost half of the elderly persons who were nor-
motensive at baseline died before the 1982­1984 follow-up
and these deaths were concentrated in the lowest education
group. Thus, the inclusion of elderly persons would bias the
results toward the null. Finally, non-Hispanic Blacks 45­64
years of age were also excluded because their sample size is
too small to provide reliable estimates.
Of the 9,840 non-Hispanic White persons aged 25­64
years and non-Hispanic Black persons aged 25­44 years at
baseline, we excluded from analysis 808 (5.6 percent) who
were lost to follow-up, 500 (3.5 percent) who died before
the 1982­1984 follow-up, and 59 (0.4 percent) who were
traced but not interviewed in 1982­1984. Also excluded
from the analyses were women who were pregnant at base-
line or follow-up (n  104), persons with unknown baseline
or follow-up blood pressure measurements or antihyperten-
sive medication use (n  1,110), persons with unknown
educational attainment (n  160), and persons who were
hypertensive at baseline (n  1,261), that is, had systolic
blood pressure equal to or greater than 160 mmHg, had dias-
tolic blood pressure equal to or greater than 95 mmHg,
and/or reported using antihypertensive medication. After all
exclusions, 5,861 persons with normal blood pressure
(1,976 non-Hispanic White men, 3,413 non-Hispanic White
women, and 472 non-Hispanic Black men and women)
remained for analysis. Included and excluded persons with
normal blood pressure, for whom data were available, had
overall similar mean systolic blood pressure (p  0.28) and
similar mean body mass index (p  0.06); excluded persons
with normal blood pressure were more likely to have lower
educational attainment (p  0.001) and to be younger (p 
0.001) than persons included in the study.
Outcome variable
Incident hypertension was defined as follow-up systolic
blood pressure equal to or greater than 160 mmHg and/or
diastolic blood pressure equal to or greater than 95 mmHg
and/or follow-up report of current use of antihypertensive
medication. This definition of hypertension was chosen
because it was the clinical definition of hypertension in use
at the time of the baseline and follow-up examinations. The
date of the follow-up examination in 1982­1984 was con-
sidered the date of incidence because it is not possible to
identify the actual date of onset.
Measurement of variables
At the baseline physical examination, blood pressure
measurements were taken at a mobile examination center by
a physician with the participant seated. One blood pressure
measurement was attempted for all participants; two addi-
tional blood pressure measurements were attempted for a
subsample of participants. Approximately 30 percent of the
blood pressure measurements were taken with an aneroid
sphygmomanometer, and the remainder were taken with a
standard mercury sphygmomanometer. There were no sig-
nificant differences in blood pressure by type of sphygmo-
manometer used (23). Two cuff sizes, pediatric and adult,
were available. The cuff most appropriate for the partici-
pant's arm circumference was placed over the bulge in the
upper right arm. Diastolic blood pressure was measured at
the point of complete cessation of Korotkoff's sounds or, if
there was no cessation, the point of muffling. Measurements
were recorded to the nearest 2 mm on the scale (23).
At follow-up, blood pressure was measured three times in
the participant's home by a trained interviewer. These mea-
surements were taken at the end of the interview with the
participant seated using a mercury sphygmomanometer.
Three cuffs (pediatric, adult, and large) were available (22).
Similar results were obtained when using all available blood
pressure measurements or only the first measurement; there-
fore, for consistency, only the first measurement at baseline
and follow-up is used for these analyses.
Educational attainment at baseline was measured as the
highest completed grade of school and categorized as less
than 12 years, 12 years, and more than 12 years. Self-
reported race and ethnicity as obtained at follow-up were
used in the analyses (22). Poverty status is defined by the
ratio of family income to the federal poverty line threshold
that is established annually by the US Bureau of the Census
and adjusted by family composition. For this analysis,
poverty status was defined as less than 100 percent of the
federal poverty level, from 100 to less than 200 percent of
the federal poverty level, and 200 percent and above.
Multiple dichotomous variables (Northeast, Midwest, West,
274 Vargas et al.
Am J Epidemiol Vol. 152, No. 3, 2000
and South as the reference category) were used to represent
region of residence to account for regional variation in
hypertension prevalence and socioeconomic status.
Statistical methods
Demographic and other characteristics of the participants
were compared. Hypertension incidence rates were calculated
as the number of incident cases per 1,000 person-years at risk.
Estimates of the risk of developing hypertension among per-
sons with less than 12 years and 12 years of education relative
to those with more than 12 years of education were derived
from Cox proportional hazards models using the PHREG pro-
cedure in the Statistical Analysis System (24). Cox propor-
tional hazards models account for the difference in follow-up
time among participants, which ranged from 6.7 to 12.6 years
(mean  9.9 years). Persons who did not develop hyperten-
sion were censored at the date of the follow-up examination.
All models included age at baseline, in single years, as a
covariate. Risk-adjusted models also included baseline body
mass index (kg/m2), region of residence, and systolic blood
pressure (mmHg). Systolic blood pressure is included to
control for borderline or labile blood pressure elevations at
baseline.
Separate analyses were performed for non-Hispanic
White men, non-Hispanic White women, and non-Hispanic
Blacks because of the well-known racial/ethnic and sex dif-
ferentials in the prevalence of hypertension (25). Sex-
specific analyses were not performed for non-Hispanic
Blacks because of small sample size. Models for non-
Hispanic Blacks also included sex as a covariate.
Interactions among baseline education, age, body mass
index, region of residence, and systolic blood pressure were
examined for each racial/ethnic-sex group.
The association between hypertension incidence and edu-
cation was examined for nonlinearity by performing analyses
with education entered in the model as a continuous variable
together with the square of education (not shown). No evi-
dence of nonlinearity was found for non-Hispanic White
men, non-Hispanic White women, or non-Hispanic Blacks.
We checked the proportional hazards assumption by plotting
the log-log survival curves for the education subgroups and
by testing time-dependent covariates for education. The log-
log survival curves were approximately parallel, and the
time-dependent covariates were not significant, so we con-
cluded that the data fit the proportional hazards assumption.
To assess the effect of the complex survey design on the
results, the proportional hazard models were also run using
PROC SURVIVAL in SUDAAN (26). The results were con-
sistent with minimal effects of the complex survey design on
the main conclusions derived from the unweighted esti-
mates. Therefore, the estimates from the unweighted Cox
regression models are presented (27).
RESULTS
Table 1 presents the means or percentages of baseline risk
factors by racial/ethnic group, sex, and education in the
analysis cohort. Persons with less than 12 years of education
were older than persons with more education. Overall, the
mean systolic blood pressure tended to be higher in the less
than 12 years of education group than in the more than 12
years of education group. The differential was statistically
significant only among younger non-Hispanic White
women. Non-Hispanic White women with less than 12 years
of education had a significantly higher mean body mass
index than their counterparts with more education.
Table 2 presents the number of incident hypertension cases
by racial/ethnic group, sex, baseline age, and education. There
were 919 incident cases of hypertension during the follow-up
period. For non-Hispanic Whites, the incidence rate of hyper-
tension per 1,000 person-years, also shown in table 2, was
consistently higher among middle-aged persons than among
younger persons. For all demographic groups, the hyperten-
sion incidence rate tended to be higher among persons with
less than 12 years of education than among those with more
than 12 years of education. However, the 95 percent confi-
dence intervals indicate that the differences in the incidence
rate by education were statistically significant only among
non-Hispanic White men and women 25­44 years of age.
The proportional hazard models indicated the presence of
a significant interaction between education and age among
non-Hispanic White men and non-Hispanic White women
25­64 years of age (p < 0.001) but not among non-Hispanic
Black persons 25­44 years of age; there was also a signifi-
cant interaction between body mass index and systolic blood
pressure among non-Hispanic White women 25­44 years of
age. There were no other significant interactions. Therefore,
the models for non-Hispanic White persons were run sepa-
rately for younger persons (25­44 years) and middle-aged
persons (45­64 years), and risk-adjusted models for
younger non-Hispanic White women included the interac-
tion term, body mass index × systolic blood pressure.
The age-adjusted risk of hypertension incidence was signif-
icantly higher among younger non-Hispanic White men and
women with less than 12 years of education compared with
those with more than 12 years (men: relative risk (RR) 
2.14, 95 percent confience interval (CI): 1.29, 3.54; women:
RR  2.06, 95 percent CI: 1.39, 3.05) (table 3). The relative
risk of hypertension for non-Hispanic White men changed lit-
tle after adjusting for baseline risk factors (RR  2.01, 95 per-
cent CI: 1.21, 3.35); the relative risk for women was reduced
but it was still significant (RR  1.50, 95 percent CI: 1.002,
2.236). The risk of hypertension incidence for persons with
less than 12 years of education compared with those with
more than 12 years of education was not significant in middle-
aged non-Hispanic White men and women or in younger non-
Hispanic Blacks.
A proportional hazards model with education included as
a continuous variable was run for non-Hispanic Blacks to
explore whether the categorization of education may be
masking the association between education and hyperten-
sion incidence. No significant association was found
between hypertension incidence and single years of educa-
tional attainment (RR  0.97, 95 percent CI: 0.93, 1.02). To
account for the lower educational attainment among older
persons and non-Hispanic Blacks (table 1), we also per-
formed analyses with education categorized as 0­7, 8­11,
Hypertension Incidence and Education 275
Am J Epidemiol Vol. 152, No. 3, 2000
and 12 and more years of educational attainment. No asso-
ciation was found between hypertension incidence and these
education categories in non-Hispanic Whites aged 45­64
years or in non-Hispanic Blacks (not shown).
Poverty status was also included in the models to explore
the possible effects of socioeconomic status not represented
by educational attainment. We chose poverty status over
family income because the data on income provided by the
NHANES I are in uneven categories and are truncated at
$25,000, which makes them unsuitable for multivariate
analyses. Poverty status was significantly associated with
the incidence of hypertension only among older non-
Hispanic women; the association between educational
attainment and the incidence of hypertension remained
almost unchanged after adding poverty status to the models.
A study of the incidence of hypertension and occupational
class also found poverty not significant (20). To maintain
the models in their more parsimonious form, poverty status
was not included in the final models.
DISCUSSION
In this study we examined the prospective relation
between educational attainment and subsequent hyperten-
sion among non-Hispanic White men and women aged
25­64 years and non-Hispanic Black men and women aged
25­44 years from a nationally representative sample.
Educational attainment was selected as the main socioeco-
nomic status variable because it has been reported as the
facet of socioeconomic status more determinant of health
status, particularly cardiovascular conditions (28), it is the
variable that structures occupation and income (29), and it is
the only indicator that remains relatively consistent through
adult life (5). We found a previously unreported interaction
between baseline age and education that was highly signifi-
cant (p < 0.001). The risk of developing hypertension after
adjusting for age is inversely associated with educational
attainment among non-Hispanic White persons 25­44 years
of age at baseline; non-Hispanic White men and women in
this age group with less than 12 years of education have a
higher risk of hypertension than their counterparts with
more than 12 years of education. The association of educa-
tion and risk of developing hypertension among non-
Hispanic White men 25­44 years of age could not be
explained by the risk factors included in the models, body
mass index, region of residence, and systolic blood pressure;
among non-Hispanic White women 25­44 years of age,
these risk factors explained part of the association between

education and the risk of developing hypertension.
However, no association was found in non-Hispanic Whites
aged 45­64 years.
The lack of difference in the risk of hypertension among
persons 45­64 years of age could have been a cohort effect
associated with the overall increase of education in the US
population (30), which could result in a different meaning of
educational attainment for each age group; that is, the disad-
vantages of not finishing high school were greater for the
younger group than for the older one. To explore this possi-
bility, we performed the analysis with educational attainment
classified as 0­8, 9­11, and 12 and over (data not shown); the
relative risk estimates among persons 45­64 years of age
using these new categories of education were essentially the
same as those obtained using the original categorization.
Although the association between hypertension incidence
and educational attainment in non-Hispanic Blacks 25­44
years of age failed to achieve statistical significance and was
reduced after controlling for age (table 2), two previous
studies have reported an association between hypertension
incidence and socioeconomic status among Blacks. A 14-
year follow-up study in Charleston, South Carolina, found a
negative association between hypertension incidence and an
index based on education and occupation among Blacks (16,
18). This study included a group of high socioeconomic sta-
tus non-Hispanic Blacks to increase the socioeconomic sta-
tus variation of the study sample. A 3-year follow-up study
of non-Hispanic Blacks residing in the inner city of
Baltimore, Maryland, found an association between hyper-
tension incidence and income but not between hypertension
incidence and education (analyses performed using multiple
regression with a binary dependent variable) (17). In models
with poverty status instead of education, we did not find that
poverty was associated significantly with hypertension inci-
dence. The lack of association in our study may be due in
part to the small number of non-Hispanic Blacks in the
NHEFS with more than 12 years of education, which
yielded only 13 cases (table 2). Hence, the statistical power
of our analysis was low; confidence intervals indicate that
an important association cannot be excluded. When the
analysis was repeated using the education categories 0­8,
9­11, and 12 years and over, no significant association was
found.

Hypertension Incidence and Education 277
Am J Epidemiol Vol. 152, No. 3, 2000
A previous analysis of NHEFS studying the association
between the incidence of hypertension and multiple
sociodemographic and behavioral variables found a signifi-
cant association between education and hypertension inci-
dence in White women 25­74 years of age at baseline (p <
0.000) and a borderline association in White men (p 
0.055) after controlling for multiple risk factors (19).
However, this study did not control for the strong interaction
between education and age that exists among non-Hispanic
White persons in the NHEFS as shown by our analyses. Our
age group-specific analyses indicated that education is asso-
ciated with the risk of hypertension only among younger
non-Hispanic White persons but not among persons 45­64
years of age.
The finding that younger non-Hispanic White men and
women with lower educational attainment are more likely to
become hypertensive than their counterparts with higher
educational attainment may reflect the deleterious effects of
lower socioeconomic conditions of life on health. Studies
have shown that persons living in lower socioeconomic sta-
tus environments are more exposed to health insults, some
of which are associated with hypertension: depression (31),
sedentarism (32, 33), and behaviors to cope with life's hard-
ships such as alcohol intake (33, 34) and cigarette smoking
(33). Our results indicating an association of hypertension
incidence and educational attainment only among the
younger group are consistent with the "weathering" hypoth-
esis proposed by Geronimus (35, 36). This hypothesis con-
tends that persons living in low socioeconomic status condi-
tions see their health profiles worsening at earlier ages than
their counterparts living in more favorable conditions (36).
In our study, middle-aged persons with low education who
survive the younger years without hypertension are at the
same risk as their counterparts with more education.
Limitations of this analysis include possible bias arising
from loss to follow-up, missing data on baseline risk vari-
ables, and missing data at follow-up. In addition, partici-
pants who died between baseline and follow-up could not be
included in the analysis. This situation may produce a bias
because most persons who died or were lost to follow-up
were in the low education group and the older age group.
This bias was reduced by limiting the analyses to partici-
pants 25­64 years of age. Another limitation is that the use
of only one blood pressure measurement may introduce
errors due to within-person blood pressure variability.
Although analyses including all available measurements
were consistent with those presented here, some misclassifi-
cation bias associated with within-person blood pressure
variability may remain. Unfortunately, the NHEFS does not
provide repeated blood pressure measurements at follow-up
to correct for within-person measurement error (37, 38).
However, there is no reason to believe that this possible bias
is associated with educational attainment; thus, any bias of
results on incidence of hypertension by educational attain-
ment should be toward the null. Bias in the model coeffi-
cients could also be caused by substantial intraindividual
variation in one of the independent variables, baseline sys-
tolic blood pressure (and also systolic blood pressure × body
mass index in the case of younger White women). This
could occur independent of the likelihood of misclassifica-
tion of the outcome variable. Assuming that baseline sys-
tolic blood pressure is positively associated with incident
hypertension and that educational attainment is negatively
associated with baseline systolic blood pressure, the bias is
likely toward the null, but bias away from the null cannot be
excluded. The small number of non-Hispanic Black men
and women precluded more detailed analysis by sex and age
groups and caused a lack of precision as reflected by wide
confidence intervals, so that a significant association of risk
of hypertension with educational attainment could not be
excluded. The possibility of confounding by variables not
measured cannot be excluded.
In summary, our results confirm previous findings that
persons with low educational attainment are at higher risk of
hypertension; they add to previous reports the finding that
the excess risk of hypertension for non-Hispanic White per-
sons with low education is confined to early adulthood,
25­44 years of age. Non-Hispanic White men and women
25­44 years of age with lower educational attainment are at
higher risk of hypertension than their counterparts with
higher educational attainment, even after adjusting for risk
factors. No association between educational attainment and
risk of hypertension was found for middle-aged non-
Hispanic White participants. Our results of no association
between education and the incidence of hypertension among
non-Hispanic Black participants 25­44 years of age should
be considered with caution because of the small sample size.
Future studies should assess this association using popula-
tion samples including larger numbers of non-Hispanic
Blacks, as well as persons from other racial/ethnic groups,
and the elderly.
