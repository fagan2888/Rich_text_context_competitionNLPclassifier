Abstract
Research with European Caucasian samples demonstrates that attractiveness-based biases in social evaluation depend on the
constellation of the sex of the evaluator and the sex of the target: Whereas people generally show positive biases toward
attractive opposite-sex persons, they show less positive or even negative biases toward attractive same-sex persons. By
examining these biases both within and between different ethnicities, the current studies provide new evidence for both the
generalizability and the specificity of these attractiveness-based social perception biases. Examining within-ethnicity effects, Study
1 is the first to demonstrate that samples from diverse ethnic backgrounds parallel the finding of European Caucasian samples: The
advantageous or adverse effects of attractiveness depend on the gender constellation of the evaluator and the evaluated person.
Examining between-ethnicity effects, Study 2 found that these attractiveness-based biases emerge almost exclusively toward
targets of the evaluator's own ethnic background; these biases were reduced or eliminated for cross-ethnicity evaluations and
interaction intentions. We discuss these findings in light of evolutionary principles and reflect on potential interactions between
culture and evolved cognitive mechanisms.

Imagine a manager evaluating a very attractive job applicant.
Would the candidate's attractiveness give him or her an advan-
tage in the job selection process? Most of the extant literature
provides a clear answer to this question: Yes, it would. Attrac-
tiveness has been shown to exert powerful positive effects on
social evaluation and decision-making (Langlois et al., 2000;
Lemay, Clark, & Greenberg, 2010).
However, recent research suggests that the manager's reac-
tion to the candidate's attractiveness might depend on whether
or not the manager and candidate are of the same sex. Although
people tend to positively evaluate attractive members of the
opposite sex, the same does not always hold true for evalua-
tions of the same sex. Indeed, people often see attractive mem-
bers of their own sex as a threat--both to their self-esteem and
to their relationships and reproductive success (Gutierres, Ken-
rick, & Partch, 1999). From an evolutionary perspective,
attractive same-sex persons may be perceived as rivals (Bleske
& Shackelford, 2001; Buss, 1988, 1992, 1998; Maner, Gailliot,
Rouby, & Miller, 2007), so that people might sometimes react
negatively to them (Buss & Dedden, 1990; Buss, Shackelford,

Choe, Buunk, & Dijksta, 2000; Schmitt & Buss, 1996; Vail-
lancourt, 2013). Consequently, the manager might be inclined
to derogate an attractive same-sex applicant (Agthe, Spo
¨rrle, &
Maner, 2011).
But now imagine that the attractive same-sex candidate and
the manager are of different ethnic groups. Would the manager
still derogate the attractive same-sex applicant? Or, instead,
might differences in their ethnicities change their social
schema such that the applicant is no longer perceived as a
threat? In the current article, we demonstrate that whether
someone is evaluating an individual of the same versus a dif-
ferent ethnicity plays a critical role in whether attractiveness
affects social judgment and decision-making. Examining the
moderating effects of ethnicity provides a fruitful opportunity
to investigate both the generalizability and the specificity of
attractiveness-based social evaluation biases.
Positive and Negative Effects of Attractiveness
on Social Evaluation
Across cultures, attractive persons receive favorable interper-
sonal evaluations (Chen, Shaffer, & Wu, 1997; Shaffer, Cre-
paz, & Sun, 2000; Wheeler & Kim, 1997). Such evaluations
reflect people's desire to interact with good-looking persons
because they represent social opportunities (e.g., as romantic
partners; Lemay et al., 2010). From an evolutionary perspec-
tive, physical attractiveness is highly valued because it serves
as a cue to the health, level of genetic fitness, and fertility of
potential partners (Gangestad & Simpson, 2000; Kenrick &
Keefe, 1992; Pflu
¨ger, Oberzaucher, Katina, Holzleitner, &
Grammer, 2012; Rhodes, 2006). When mating goals are active,
people tend to categorize opposite-sex persons on their level of
physical attractiveness (Li & Kenrick, 2006) and react favor-
ably to good-looking persons of the other sex (Maner & Acker-
man, 2015; Maner et al., 2003).
Despite the generally positive effects of attractiveness, stud-
ies with European Caucasian samples also indicate negative
effects of being attractive. People's preference for attractive
mates may lead them to perceive attractive same-sex persons
as intrasexual rivals, and the perception of such rivals is linked
with the activation of mate-guarding motives (Maner & Acker-
man, 2015; Maner, Miller, Moss, Leo, & Plant, 2012; Maner,
Miller, Rouby, & Gailliot, 2009). This perception of attractive
same-sex persons as potential rivals even occurs automatically
and without awareness (Buunk, Massar, & Dijkstra, 2007; Mas-
sar & Buunk, 2010), thus pointing to an adaptive sensitivity to
relevant social categories. Because attractive same-sex persons
elicit unfavorable upward social comparisons (Jones & Buck-
ingham, 2005) and serve as intrasexual rivals over relationship
opportunities (Gutierres et al., 1999), people tend to perceive
attractive same-sex individuals as threats to self-esteem (Park &
Maner, 2009) and relationships (Buss et al., 2000). Consequently,
as soon as people reach sexual maturity (Agthe, Spo
¨rrle, Frey,
Walper, & Maner, 2013), they tend to derogate (Fo
¨rsterling,
Preikschas, & Agthe, 2007; Vaillancourt, 2013) and avoid
(Agthe,Spo
¨rrle,&Fo
¨rsterling,2008;Agtheetal.,2011)attractive
same-sex persons. In addition, women display heightened vigi-
lance to attractive intrasexual rivals during the fertile phase of
their menstrual cycle, the time during which the women's repro-
ductive prospects are most salient (e.g., Fisher, 2004).
Negative responses to attractive same-sex persons have been
found not only in romantic contexts (Maner, Gailliot, Rouby,
Miller, et al., 2007; Maner et al., 2009) but also in organiza-
tional decision-making (Agthe, Spo
¨rrle, & Maner, 2010; Luxen
& van de Vijver, 2006; Ruffle & Shtudiner, 2014). Thus, for
European Caucasian samples confronted with same-ethnicity
targets, the nature of attractiveness biases depends on whether
one is evaluating a target of the same sex or the opposite sex.
Do Attractiveness-Based Social Evaluation Biases
Generalize to Other Ethnic Groups?
The underlying adaptive social motives these attractiveness-
based evaluation biases are designed to serve (cf. Neuberg,
Kenrick, Maner, & Schaller, 2004; Kenrick, Delton, Robertson,
Becker, & Neuberg, 2007) are relatively universal across cul-
tures and ethnicities (Buss, 1989): Despite cultural differences
in the importance of attractiveness (Anderson, Adams, & Plaut,
2008), persons from different cultures still regard attractiveness
as a valuable criterion for mate choice (Buss, 1989; Chang,
Wang, Shackelford, & Buss, 2011; Kamble, Shackelford,
Pham, & Buss, 2014), so that across cultures, attractive
opposite-sex persons tend to receive favorable social evalua-
tions (Langlois et al., 2000).
However, this preference for attractive persons seems to be
limited to opposite-sex targets (Li & Zhou, 2014). In many
cultures, attractive same-sex targets are regarded with jealousy
(Buss et al., 2000; Dijkstra & Buunk, 2002). Hence, it is likely
that also in non-European Caucasian samples, people will per-
ceive highly attractive members of their own sex and ethnicity
as a threat and, consequently, will respond negatively toward
them (e.g., derogate them). Thus, we predicted that, across
different ethnicities, participants would positively evaluate
attractive opposite-sex targets, but negatively evaluate attrac-
tive same-sex targets. We test this hypothesis in Study 1.
Do Attractiveness-Based Biases Generalize
to Between-Ethnicity Evaluations?
Even though persons from different ethnicities and cultures
tend to generally agree on whom they consider attractive (Coet-
zee, Greeff, Stephen, & Perrett, 2014; Cunningham, Roberts,
Barbee, Druen, & Wu, 1995; Rhodes, 2006; Rhodes et al.,
2001; Zebrowitz, Montepare, & Lee, 1993), we predict that
attractiveness-based biases will be reduced or even eliminated
for between-ethnicity evaluations. That is, although an individ-
ual may respond in a biased way to attractive members of their
own ethnicity, such biases may not be as strong when members
of a different ethnicity are evaluated.
There are three (not mutually exclusive) reasons for this
prediction: First, members of other ethnic groups may be rel-
atively less likely than same-ethnicity targets to be seen as

potential mates and romantic rivals (e.g., Eastwick, Richeson,
Son, & Finkel, 2009; Feliciano, Robnett, & Komaie, 2009;
McClintock, 2010). For instance, Stephen et al. (2012) found
that people's ability to judge health cues (like natural skin color
variation) for other-ethnicity targets is rather limited (com-
pared with same-ethnicity targets). Thus, people might be more
sensitive to mating-related cues in targets who share their own
ethnicity. This might partially result from socialization, such as
the perception that family acceptance for a partner of another
ethnicity would be rather low (Mills, Daly, Longmore, & Kil-
bride, 1995; Wang, Kao, & Joyner, 2006). Yet, such intergroup
biases (including preferences for same-ethnicity partners) may
also be linked to adaptive motives such as greater caution and
vigilance toward (particularly male) out-group members (Maner
& Miller, 2013; Olsson, Ebert, Banaji, & Phelps, 2005). Already
youngchildrenshowfavorablereactionstowardthosewhobelong
to their own social category (for reviews, see Bigler & Liben,
2006; Hirschfeld, 1998; regarding ethnicity, see Aboud, 1988;
Comer, 1989), and even though explicit ethnicity-related biases
become more egalitarian across individual development, implicit
attitudes favoring the in-group remain stable (Baron & Banaji,
2006; Dunham, Baron, & Banaji, 2006). Although it is unlikely
that people have evolved to categorize others into racial or ethnic
categories (see Cosmides, Tooby, & Kurzban, 2003), race and
ethnicity serve as important group markers in modern cultural
contexts. Accordingly, some studies find evidence for a potential
(though not always strong and completely consistent) own-race
preference in attractiveness judgments (Burke, Nolan, Hayward,
Russell, & Sulikowski, 2013; Rhodes et al., 2001, 2005).
Second, a key feature of whether a target person is perceived
as a potential mating rival involves the perceived likelihood
that a potential mate (whom oneself desires) would be inter-
ested in the target person. Given that people typically prefer to
date and mate within ethnicity (e.g., Hitsch, Hortac
¸su, &
Ariely, 2010; Lin & Lundquist, 2013; Robnett & Feliciano,
2011), one might perceive a relatively lower likelihood that a
potential (or current) mate would view members of other eth-
nicities as desirable partners. That is, one might be relatively
less likely to see same-sex members of other ethnicities (versus
the same ethnicity) as rivals because they are less likely to be
viewed as desirable by one's own romantic interests.
Third, other-ethnicity targets might be perceived as rela-
tively less relevant for appearance-based social comparison
because they appear to be less similar to the evaluator and are,
thus, less likely to elicit self-other comparison (Tesser, 1988;
Major, Testa, & Bylsma, 1991). That is, other-ethnicity targets
are less likely to pose a threat to one's self-esteem and to be
perceived as a potential object of social comparison. Accord-
ingly, attractiveness-based biases are hypothesized to be stron-
ger for targets of one's own ethnicity than for targets of another
ethnicity. We test this hypothesis in Study 2.
Overview of the Current Research
Across cultures, adaptive mating-related motives may guide
social perception (e.g., for Caucasian samples, see Maner,
Gailliot, Rouby, Miller, et al., 2007, and for Asian samples,
see Li et al., 2015). Given that the social motives underlying
attractiveness-based biases (e.g., mating, social comparison)
are presumed to be relatively universal, we hypothesize that
those biases will generalize to other-ethnicity samples evaluat-
ing targets of their own ethnic background (Study 1). With
regard to between-group effects, we hypothesize that European
Caucasians will display larger evaluative biases when judging
members of their own ethnicity than members of other ethni-
cities (Study 2).
Study 1
Study 1 tests the hypothesis that, across samples from diverse
non-Caucasian ethnic backgrounds (i.e., Asia [AS], Middle
East [ME], Latin America [LA]), people will evaluate attrac-
tive same- and opposite-sex targets of their own ethnicity in
biased ways (i.e., attractiveness will have a positive influence
for opposite-sex constellations, and a negative influence for
same-sex constellations). That is, paralleling the findings of
Caucasian samples these biases should generalize to the
within-ethnicity evaluations of non-Caucasian samples and
be reflected in attributions as well as social interaction
intentions.
Materials and Method
Participants
International students from LA (n ¼ 207), the ME (n ¼ 181),
and AS (n ¼ 195) staying at German language schools and
universities for language courses participated in our study.
Their mean age was 25.01 years (SD ¼ 6.56). All participants
had advanced German-language skills.
Design and Procedure
For each ethnic group (i.e., LA, ME, AS), Study 1 employed a 2
(participant sex) Â 2 (target sex) Â 2 (target attractiveness;
highly attractive versus less attractive) between-subjects
design.
Similar to prior studies (Agthe et al., 2008; Fo
¨rsterling et al.,
2007), participants received a scenario describing the occupa-
tional history and success of a target person. It contained edu-
cational (e.g., education in home country), occupational (e.g.,
employed as a doctor in Germany), and social (e.g., family)
background information about the target and highlighted the
target's early career success. This information was constant
across all experimental conditions. In addition, the materials
included a passport-sized black and white facial photograph of
the target, which portrayed a male or female, highly attractive
or less attractive person of each of the three different ethnic
groups. Photographs were prerated and selected for higher and
lower attractiveness in an independent pretest: Across ethnici-
ties, attractive targets were between 7.00 and 9.00 and less
attractive targets were between 2.00 and 4.00 on a 10-point
rating scale. Participants were randomly assigned to one of the
Agthe et al. 3
four experimental conditions; all targets matched participants'
ethnic groups (i.e., each participant only saw a stimulus person
of his or her own ethnicity). After reading the scenario, parti-
cipants responded to measures of social evaluation and desire
for social interaction as well as a manipulation check. The
methods of both studies were evaluated and approved by a
university research ethics committee.
Measures
Explicit measures of social evaluation can elicit social desir-
ability effects and other response biases. Thus, instead of ask-
ing people to explicitly evaluate each target, we used a more
implicit attributional measure used in previous research to tap
underlying biases in social judgment (Agthe et al., 2008; Fo
¨r-
sterling et al., 2007). Using 2 items (from 1 ¼ not important to
10 ¼ very important), participants attributed the target's early
career success to ability as well as to luck. As in previous
research, the difference score between these 2 items served
as dependent variable reflecting the extent to which partici-
pants attributed the target's successes to internal versus exter-
nal causes. Previous studies (Agthe et al., 2008; Fo
¨rsterling
et al., 2007) have shown that positive social evaluations foster
internal attributions of success (i.e., to ability), whereas nega-
tive evaluations promote external attributions (i.e., to luck).
Subsequently, participants provided measures of their desire
for social interaction with the target: Participants reported the
degree to which they would like to (a) work with the candidate
and (b) become friends with the candidate (1 ¼ not at all, 10 ¼
very much). The two variables were highly correlated (.60 r
.75 for the three samples) and were averaged to create a
composite measure of desire for social interaction. As manip-
ulation check, participants rated the target's attractiveness from
1 (unattractive) to 10 (very attractive).
Results
Manipulation Check
In all three ethnic samples, the attractive targets (Moverall
¼
7.18, SD ¼ 1.97) were perceived as better looking than the less
attractive targets (Moverall
¼ 5.39, SD ¼ 2.17), ps < .005,
ds > .45.
Evaluative Attributions
First, we examined the hypothesized Participant Sex Â Target
Sex Â Target Attractiveness three-way interaction. As we
detected no significant influence of ethnicity on this interaction
(i.e., the four-way interaction was not significant, p > .40),
aggregating across ethnicities in order to develop an overall
impression of the data seems justified.
A 2 (participant sex) Â 2 (target sex) Â 2 (target attractive-
ness) analysis of variance confirmed the hypothesized three-
way interaction, F(1, 573) ¼ 34.34, p < .001, Z2 ¼ .06 (no
further main or interaction effects reached significance; for
overall mean values, see bottom of Table 1). In order to eluci-
date this three-way interaction, we decomposed it into two
separate lower order two-way interactions for the two sexes
of the respondents. These interactions were analyzed by means
of simple main effects. We confirmed Target Sex Â Target
Attractiveness interactions for female participants, F(1, 306)
¼ 31.32, p < .001, and male participants, F(1, 267) ¼ 8.07, p <
.005. Women provided less positive attributions for attractive
female targets compared with less attractive female targets, p <
.001, but provided more positive attributions for attractive male
targets compared with less attractive male targets, p < .001.
Male participants only tended to prefer less attractive males
compared to attractive males, but this tendency did not reach

significance, p ¼ .22. However, they provided more positive
attributions for attractive females than for less attractive
females, p < .01. These findings provide first evidence that the
recently described three-way interaction between respondent
sex, target sex, and target attractiveness found for European
Caucasian samples generalizes to non-Caucasian samples.
Even though we detected no significant influence of ethni-
city on the three-way interaction (see above), we conducted
exploratory analyses for each ethnic group (i.e., LA, AS, and
ME) to confirm that the expected pattern was present in each of
the three ethnicities (see Table 1). For all three ethnicities, we
detected the hypothesized three-way interaction, Fs > 5.00, ps
< .05, which predominantly (i.e., in 11 of 3 [ethnicity] Â 4
[respondent sex-target sex constellation)] ¼ 12 conditions) was
in line with the hypothesized response pattern (i.e., more pos-
itive evaluations for attractive targets in opposite-sex constel-
lations and more negative evaluations for attractive targets in
same-sex constellations, Table 1). The only exception was for
males from the ME who unexpectedly tended to show a (insig-
nificant) preference for attractive male targets, p ¼ .08.
Desire for Social Interaction
As before, we examined the hypothesized Participant Sex Â
Target Sex Â Target Attractiveness three-way interaction.
Because we again detected no significant influence of ethnicity
on this interaction (i.e., the four-way interaction was not sig-
nificant, p > .15), we aggregated data across ethnicities.
A 2 (participant sex) Â 2 (target sex) Â 2 (target attractive-
ness) analysis of variance revealed significant main effects for
participant sex, p < .05, as well as target sex, p < .05, indicating
overall higher desire for social interaction intentions for female
(compared to male) participants and concerning male (compared
to female) targets. More importantly, these lower order effects
were qualified by the hypothesized three-way interaction, F(1,
574) ¼ 35.06, p < .001, Z2 ¼ .06 (for overall mean values, see
bottom of Table 2). In order to elucidate this interaction, we
followed the same analytical approach as before: Lower order
two-way interactions confirmed Target Sex Â Target Attractive-
ness interactions for female participants, F(1, 306) ¼ 15.34, p <
.001, and male participants, F(1, 268) ¼ 19.38, p < .001. Women
expressed less desire to interact with attractive female targets
compared to less attractive female targets, p < .005, but greater
desire to interact with attractive male targets compared to less
attractive male targets, p < .05. Similarly, male participants were
less inclined to interact with attractive male targets compared to
less attractive male targets, p < .005, whereas they expressed an
increased desire to interact with attractive females compared to
less attractive females, p < .005.
Even though we did not detect a four-way interaction (i.e.,
no effect of the ethnicities on the three-way interaction), we
analyzed the three non-Caucasian samples separately. The
hypothesized three-way interaction was (marginally) signifi-
cant for each of the ethnic samples: LA, F(1, 199) ¼ 18.55,
p < .001; AS, F(1, 186) ¼ 3.46, p ¼ .06; and ME, F(1, 173) ¼
17.23, p < .001. In each case, the pattern was completely in line
with the hypothesized response pattern (i.e., more positive eva-
luations for attractive targets in opposite-sex constellations and
more negative evaluations for attractive targets in same-sex
constellations, see Table 2).
Discussion
Findings from Study 1 provide some of the first empirical sup-
port for the hypothesis that attractiveness-based biases in social
evaluation (which operate in opposite directions depending on
Table 2. Means and Standard Deviations (in Brackets) of Desire for Social Interaction Across Ethnicities (Study 1).

the sex constellation of respondent and target) generalize to non-
Western samples. In 23 of the 24 (¼ 4 respondent sex-target sex
combinations Â 3 ethnicities Â 2 depending variables) constel-
lations, individuals positively evaluated attractive members of
the opposite sex but negatively evaluated attractive (in compar-
ison to less attractive) members of their own sex. These findings
are in line with the notion that social comparison and adaptive
mating-related motives (i.e., mate search and intrasexual com-
petition)--which can be found cross-culturally--might contrib-
ute to the bias. That is, positive responses might reflect approach
motivation (toward attractive opposite-sex targets as social
opportunities; Lemay et al., 2010), whereas negative responses
might reflect avoidance motivation (away from attractive same-
sex targets as social threats; Agthe et al., 2011).
Interestingly, the biased response pattern for participants'
desire for social interaction with same-ethnicity target per-
sons was somewhat smaller in the AS sample, which hints
at potential cultural variations of the bias. For instance, this
corresponds to findings indicating that reactions toward a
partner's imagined infidelity are somewhat less intense in
AS samples compared to Western samples (Geary, Rumsey,
Bow-Thomas, & Hoard, 1995), which might point to lower
underlying rivalry. Yet, research with AS participants
accords with Western findings that the preference for attrac-
tive persons seems to be limited to opposite-sex targets (Li
& Zhou, 2014).
Study 2
To our knowledge, Study 1 is the first research that showed that
attractiveness-based biases which depend on the sex constella-
tion of respondent and target (i.e., consistent positive versus
rather negative effects for opposite-sex versus same-sex target
attractiveness) generalize to non-Caucasian ethnicities' within-
group ratings. This has so far almost exclusively been docu-
mented for European Caucasian samples. Study 2 extends these
findings by addressing corresponding between-ethnicity effects
for the first time. Based on considerations that self-other com-
parison as well as mating-related motives tend to be less strong
regarding other than one's own ethnicity, Study 2 tests the
specificity of attractiveness-based social evaluation biases.
We hypothesize that these biases would be replicated for a
Caucasian sample evaluating Caucasian targets (which would
be in line with former findings) but would be reduced or elim-
inated for Caucasian participants evaluating non-Caucasian
(i.e., African, AS, LA, ME) targets (which so far has not been
empirically examined).

Study 2 employed a 2 (participant sex) Â 2 (target sex) Â 2
(target attractiveness; highly attractive vs. less attractive) Â 5
(target ethnicity) between-subjects design.
The procedure was identical to that used in Study 1. Target
ethnicities were: LA (n ¼ 479), ME (n ¼ 629), AS (n ¼ 469),
African (n ¼ 469), and Caucasian (n ¼ 511). However, unlike
Study 1, the Caucasian-only sample of Study 2 provided eva-
luations of targets from their own as well as from other ethni-
cities. Thus, only in the case of Caucasian targets, participant
and target were of the same ethnicity. In addition to the picture
sets of Study 1 (i.e., pictures of LA, ME, and AS stimulus
persons), pretested picture sets of African and Caucasian target
persons (according to the same selection criteria as in Study 1)
were used.
Measures
We used the same measures as in Study 1, that is, the difference
scores of attributions to ability minus attributions to luck (con-
cerning the target person's occupational success), the 2-item
measure (r ¼ .68) of desire for social interaction with the target
person, and the manipulation check of target attractiveness.
Results
Manipulation Check
In all five target ethnicity samples, the attractive targets (Moverall
¼ 7.24, SD ¼ 1.97) were perceived as better looking than the
less attractive targets (Moverall
¼ 4.84, SD ¼ 1.97), ps < .005.
Same-ethnicity and other-ethnicity targets did not differ signif-
icantly in the attractiveness ratings they received, p > .90. Thus,
for all target ethnicities, the Caucasian participants perceived
attractive targets to be more attractive than less attractive targets.
Evaluative Attributions
We ran a 2 (participant sex) Â 2 (target sex) Â 2 (target attrac-
tiveness) Â 2 (ethnicity constellation: same [i.e., Caucasian]
versus different [i.e., all else]) analysis of variance.
As hypothesized, we detected a significant four-way inter-
action, F(1, 2541) ¼ 18.06, p < .001, Z2 ¼ .01, confirming
that the significant three-way interaction between respondent
sex, target sex, and target attractiveness, F(1, 2541) ¼ 13.70,
p < .001, Z2 ¼ .01, varied as a function of whether respon-
dents provided answers regarding their own or a different
ethnicity. To further elucidate this complex finding of a
four-way interaction, we ran separate analyses for
respondents evaluating their own ethnicity versus another
ethnicity: A 2 (participant sex) Â 2 (target sex) Â 2 (target
attractiveness) analysis of variance confirmed the hypothe-
sized three-way interaction for European Caucasian partici-
pants evaluating Caucasian targets (i.e., targets of their own
ethnicity), F(1, 503) ¼ 22.26, p < .001, Z2 ¼ .04. In line with
Study 1 and prior research, women provided less positive
6 Evolutionary Psychology
attributions for attractive female targets compared with less
attractive female targets and tended to provide more positive
attributions for attractive male targets compared to less attrac-
tive ones. In contrast, male participants provided less positive
attributions for attractive male targets than for less attractive
male targets, whereas they tended to provide more positive
evaluations for attractive compared to less attractive female
targets (for mean values, see Table 3 bottom row). This three-
way interaction did not reach significance when participants
evaluated targets from other (i.e., non-Caucasian) ethnicities,
F(1, 2038) ¼ 0.37, p > .50.
When distinguishing between the different non-Caucasian eth-
nicities, no significant three-way interaction emerged for any of
the non-Caucasian target ethnicities either, Fs < 1.50, ps > .22.
There was neither a consistent pattern of attractivesame-sextarget
derogation nor systematic evidence of glorification of attractive
opposite-sex targets (for mean values, see Table 3 first four rows).
Desire for Social Interaction
In line with the previous analysis, we ran a 2 (participant sex) Â
2 (target sex) Â 2 (target attractiveness) Â 2 (ethnicity con-
stellation) analysis of variance.
As hypothesized, we detected a significant four-way inter-
action, F(1, 2541) ¼ 16.85, p < .001, Z2 ¼ .01, confirming that
the three-way interaction between respondent sex, target sex,
and target attractiveness, F(1, 2541) ¼ 32.81, p < .001, Z2 ¼
.01, varied as a function of whether respondents provided
answers regarding their own or a different ethnicity. We again
ran separate analyses for respondents evaluating their own eth-
nicity versus another ethnicity: When examining European
Caucasian participants evaluating only Caucasian targets, a 2
(participant sex) Â 2 (target sex) Â 2 (target attractiveness)
analysis of variance confirmed the hypothesized three-way
interaction, F(1, 503) ¼ 31.07, p < .001, Z2 ¼ .05. Women
expressed less desire to socially interact with highly attractive
female targets compared to less attractive female targets,
whereas they indicated increased intentions to interact with
attractive male targets compared with less attractive male tar-
gets. Male participants provided less interaction intentions for
attractive male targets than for less attractive male targets,
whereas they tended to provide more desire for interaction for
attractive compared to less attractive female targets (for mean
values, see Table 4 bottom row). In line with our hypotheses
and the already confirmed four-way interaction, this three-way
interaction was not observed when respondents provided
responses regarding targets from other ethnicities, F(1, 2,038)
¼ 3.33, p ¼ .068 (for mean values, see Table 4 first four rows).
For explorative purposes, we ran separate analyses for the
different ethnicities of the targets. We detected no three-way
interaction for ME, p > .30; AS, p > .22; or African, p > .24,
ethnicities. However, we found a significant three-way inter-
action with respect to LA targets, F(1, 471) ¼ 8.27, p < .005,
Z2 ¼ .02. For LA targets, the Caucasian female participants
responded in line with how they responded to Caucasian tar-
gets; however, providing a less consistent picture, the Cauca-
sian male participants generally preferred attractive targets,
although this preference was somewhat smaller when evaluat-
ing male targets. This three-way interaction regarding LA (i.e.,
other ethnicity) targets was significantly smaller than the pre-
viously described interaction observed for Caucasian (i.e.,
same-ethnicity) targets, F(1, 974) ¼ 4.16, p < .05.

Discussion
For European Caucasian participants, we observed an interac-
tion such that they responded in a relatively negative way to
attractive (in comparison to less attractive) same-sex targets but
in a more positive way to attractive (in comparison to less
attractive) opposite-sex targets which was consistent with
hypotheses. Moreover, as hypothesized, this biased response
pattern did not emerge for evaluations of other-ethnicity tar-
gets. The attractiveness-sex constellation had no effect on the
overall evaluations of other-ethnicity targets, thereby pointing
to the possibility that the latter might be relatively less relevant
for the respondents. This is consistent with preferences to date
same-ethnicity partners (Lin & Lundquist, 2013; Pota
^rca
 &
Mills, 2015) and findings of racial exclusion of other-
ethnicity persons in mate search by different ethnic groups
(e.g., AS, Caucasian, LA), particularly regarding the mate pre-
ferences of Whites (Herman & Campbell, 2012; Robnett &
Feliciano, 2011). Moreover, persons from an ethnic group other
than one's own are more readily associated with the presence of
threat (compared with persons of one's own ethnicity; Olsson
et al., 2005).
The only exception in the pattern found in this study per-
tained to responses to LA targets, such that desire for social
interaction with LA targets varied as a function of their attrac-
tiveness. These results from the Caucasian sample suggesting
that positive responses to attractive opposite-sex persons as
well as negative reactions toward attractive same-sex persons
emerged more strongly for European Caucasians and LAs than
for targets from other ethnic backgrounds fit with findings
indicating that Caucasians seem to prefer Whites and LAs as
potential partners (Feliciano et al., 2009), that mate poaching--
which might enhance the sensitivity to rivalry--is more fre-
quent in Europe and LA than in other (i.e., AS or African)
cultures (Schmitt et al., 2004), and that LA students are more
likely than other ethnic groups to date interculturally (Keels &
Harris, 2014). Moreover, regarding partner preferences, the
``Latino-White boundary'' seems to be less rigid than other
ethnic barriers: Latino Americans tend to prefer other Latinos
or Caucasians as mates (Feliciano, Lee, & Robnett, 2011). This
is in line with notions that mating rivalry is not completely
limited to one's in-group (Klavina & Buunk, 2013). However,
the overall pattern for LA targets was not the same as that for
Caucasian targets, and the pattern did not generalize to social
evaluations. Thus, on the whole, results suggest that
attractiveness-based social evaluation biases did not generalize
to between-ethnicity contexts.
General Discussion
Physical attractiveness exerts powerful biases on social percep-
tion. Recent research suggests that the well-documented posi-
tive stereotypes about good-looking people reflect a desire for
social interaction (Lemay et al., 2010) because attractiveness
often represents the presence of desirable social opportunities.
Conversely, negative social reactions may be directed toward
attractive members of one's own sex who are perceived as
threatening in the context of social relationships (Agthe
et al., 2011). To date, this pattern has so far been documented
almost exclusively in European Caucasian samples.

8 Evolutionary Psychology
The current article contributes to the literature by demon-
strating that (a) these biases generalize to samples from other
ethnic backgrounds and (b) these biases do not apply when
people are evaluating members of an ethnicity other than their
own. The current findings thus provide new evidence for both
the generalizability and the specificity of attractiveness-based
biases in social perception.
Study 1 extends prior research by showing that
attractiveness-based social evaluation biases are not restricted
to Caucasian ethnicities from Western cultures. When evaluat-
ing members of their own ethnicity, AS, ME, and LA partici-
pants displayed positive biases toward attractive opposite-sex
persons and negative biases toward attractive same-sex per-
sons. The findings are consistent with evolutionarily inspired
research (Buss, 1989; Buss et al., 2000), emphasizing the fact
that, across many cultures, highly attractive individuals reflect
both desirable mating opportunities (opposite-sex targets) as
well as potential relationship threats (same-sex targets). Our
findings support the notion that attractiveness biases might be
based, at least in part, on universal adaptive motives linked to
mating and related social comparison processes.
It is worth noting that explanations for attractiveness-based
biases, which involve mate preferences and rivalry on the one
hand, and social comparison as well as threats to one's self-
esteem on the other hand, are not mutually exclusive. Because
physical attractiveness represents a highly desirable criterion
for mate choice across different cultures and ethnicities (Buss,
1989), it is likely also to be relevant for social comparison and
self-esteem cross-culturally. As prior research suggests (Agthe
et al., 2011; Maner, Gailliot, Rouby, Miller, et al., 2007), social
judgment biases that emerge as a function of attractiveness are
unlikely to be caused merely by concerns associated with self-
esteem and social comparison. Rather, these processes may in
part reflect proximate manifestations of underlying adaptive
mating-related motives.
Interestingly, the attractiveness-based biases were found
both in women and men. Although women generally compete
more on the dimension of physical attractiveness than men do
(Dijkstra & Buunk, 2002; Townsend & Levy, 1990), physical
attractiveness is important for both sexes (e.g., Asendorpf,
Penke, & Back, 2011; Luo & Zhang, 2009), particularly in
young adulthood. Because women display a preference for
good-looking men (e.g., Niesta Kayser, Agthe, & Maner,
2016), physical attractiveness also represents an important
dimension of rivalry for men, although comparison dimensions
such as status and dominance gain more and more importance
for them with increasing age.
Study 2 contributes to the literature by demonstrating that
attractiveness biases are stronger when one is evaluating a mem-
ber of one's own ethnicity than when one is evaluating a member
of a different ethnicity. European Caucasian participants showed
no significant attractiveness bias toward African, AS, or ME
targets, despite recognizing other-ethnicity targets as highly
attractive. The only exception to this pattern emerged for LA
targets: In line with the attractiveness stereotype, male and
female participants wished to have contact with attractive
opposite-sex persons. In addition, female participants preferred
to avoid attractive same-sex targets. However, these
attractiveness-based biases did not extend to social evaluations
and were significantly smaller in size compared to the biased
response pattern regarding same-ethnicity targets.
Attractiveness-based biases are presumed to be linked to
mating-related motives and related social comparison processes
(Agthe et al., 2011; Fo
¨rsterling et al., 2007; Luxen & van de
Vijver, 2006). Thus, although individuals certainly form and
maintain romantic relationships with members of other ethnici-
ties, the current findings are in line with evidence suggesting that
mating-related social evaluation biases may be observed most
strongly when individuals are exposed to members of their own
ethnicity (Eastwick et al., 2009; McClintock, 2010; see also
Montoya, Horton, & Kirchner, 2008). Particularly regarding the
first stage of contact (i.e., when initiating romantic interest), the
degree of self-segregation is comparably higher than when reci-
procating romantic interest (Lewis, 2013), so that a preference
for persons of one's own ethnicity may dominate mate-searching
behavior for both men and women (Lin & Lundquist, 2013).
Given that prior research has often documented negative
biases toward ethnic out-group members, it is interesting that,
in the case of attractiveness-based biases within specific sex-
constellations, being of a different ethnicity might sometimes
be beneficial. There were actually less negative reactions
toward attractive same-sex persons when the person being
evaluated was of a different ethnicity, arguably because
reduced similarity and comparability might have lessened the
perceived threat to one's relationships and self-esteem. The
relatively smaller negative bias for out-group members can
be contrasted with the numerous studies indicating strong neg-
ative biases toward out-group members (Plant, Goplen, &
Kunstman, 2011; Trawalter, Todd, Baird, & Richeson, 2008;
Unkelbach, Forgas, & Denson, 2008). The differences in find-
ings likely derive from the fact that the types of threat denoted
by out-group members in previous studies (e.g., threat to phys-
ical safety; Maner et al., 2005) are categorically different than
the type of threat typically posed by attractive individuals (e.g.,
threats to one's romantic relationship).
The emergence of different reactions to attractive opposite-
sex and same-sex persons between and within ethnicities is
consistent with the fundamental social motives framework
(Kenrick, Neuberg, Griskevicius, & Schaller, 2010): Due to
their centrality over the course of human evolutionary history,
motivational states associated with survival and reproductive
success are able to direct processing of social information in
order to manage the relevant benefits and costs of social life
(Kenrick, Neuberg, Griskevicius, Becker, & Schaller, 2010;
Neel, Kenrick, White, & Neuberg, 2015). Mate search and
intrasexual competition may functionally shape people's reac-
tions to attractive other sex versus same-sex persons when the
targets appear relevant in the respective context, activating
motives designed to avoid negative outcomes by potential riv-
als and to gain access to potential mates. Accordingly, our
findings are in line with evolutionarily inspired empirical find-
ings suggesting that adaptive motives such as mate seeking,
Agthe et al. 9
mate retention, or self-protection can bias interpersonal percep-
tion of, attention to, and cognitions about individuals who dif-
fer in gender, physical attractiveness, and ethnicity (Li et al.,
2015; Maner, Gailliot, & DeWall, 2007; Maner et al., 2005;
Maner & Miller, 2013; Neuberg et al., 2004; Schaller, Park, &
Mueller, 2003). Such effects often reflect adaptive biases
meant to help individuals reap the benefits and avoid the costs
associated with social living.
One interesting question for future research pertains to
whether or not the reduced attractiveness-based biases regard-
ing out-group members might be specific for European Cauca-
sian respondents because individualistic (in comparison to
collectivist) cultures generally show less inclination to devalue
out-group members (Triandis & Gelfand, 2012).
Limitations and Future Directions
Limitations of the current research offer useful avenues for fur-
ther investigation. One limitation is that Study 1's non-
Caucasian participants were temporarily living in Germany (for
a language course or a semester as an exchange student). Thus,
the sample is relatively selective in that it only includes people
who were able and willing to study abroad. Moreover, some
acculturation may have occurred because, by attending language
education in Germany, the other-ethnicity participants had
already been heavily exposed to the influence of Western media
and culture. Future research would benefit from examining dif-
ferent ethnic groups in their own immediate cultural context.
In Study 1, the biases were less pronounced for the AS
sample compared to the LA and the ME sample, pointing to
potential cultural differences in the strength of attractiveness-
based biases. One factor to be examined in future studies
regards the role attractiveness plays in mating choices within
traditional societies; in traditional societies, mate choice is lim-
ited by family expectations and kinship rules (Yu & Shepard,
1998), so the extent of individual choice that is allowed in
personal relationships may affect attractiveness-based biases
(Adams, Anderson, & Adonu, 2004; Anderson et al., 2008).
Therefore, differences could be expected between Western cul-
tures and more traditional cultures and societies. Besides,
social influence exerted by one's environment and social net-
work (e.g., one's peer group) may affect perceptions of attrac-
tiveness even in very different surroundings, economic states,
and political climates (Lehmiller, Graziano, & VanderDrift,
2014; Swami & Tov´
ee, 2007). In addition, in organizational
contexts (which are often also influenced by culture), the
anticipated level of competition or cooperation with a new
colleague (i.e., the perceived instrumentality to oneself) may
influence whether a person's attractiveness and/or ethnicity
(i.e., being of the same vs. another ethnic group) promotes
negative versus positive reactions (Lee, Pitesa, Pillutla, &
Thau, 2015; Lee, Pitesa, Thau, & Pillutla, 2015).
Moreover, other contextual factors like the target person's
status and achievements (Agthe & Spo
¨rrle, 2009), as well as
individual differences like people's social comparison orienta-
tion (Agthe, Spo
¨rrle, Frey, & Maner, 2014), their own level of
attractiveness (Agthe et al., 2010), their sexual preference (Fo
¨r-
sterling et al., 2007), sociosexual orientation (Simpson &
Gangestad, 1992), or partnership status and commitment
(Lydon, Fitzsimons, & Naidoo, 2003) may influence whether
positive or negative attractiveness-based biases are likely to
emerge toward an other-sex versus same-sex target person.
Considering that our hypotheses referred to heterosexual parti-
cipants, failing to measure sexual preference may have added
noise to our current data, so it is important for future research to
attend more carefully to people's partner preference (i.e.,
whether they feel attracted to other-sex versus same-sex per-
sons). It might also be helpful to use more precise ethnic cate-
gories. For instance, people from AS are likely to differentiate
somewhat better than European Caucasians whether a stimulus
person from AS is Chinese, Japanese, or from another ASn
country, and this may affect reactions to the target. Besides,
there might be substantial variability in reaction pattern across
populations (Heinrich, Heine, & Norenzayan, 2010).
Moreover, the tendency to stereotype on the basis of appear-
ance when drawing characterological inferences may be
weaker for people from collectivistic or interdependent cul-
tures (e.g., East AS) because individuals might rely more on
group-level attributes when evaluating others (Dion, Pak, &
Dion, 1990; Markus, Mullally, & Kitayama, 1997). Such
potential cultural influences on the nature of attractiveness-
based biases could be profitably addressed in future research.
Although our results fall short of identifying the specific
mechanisms underlying attractiveness biases within and
between ethnicities, previous studies provide important clues.
For instance, prior research has documented that the likelihood
to have contact with the target person (Luxen & van de Vijver,
2006) and the desire to meet him or her (Agthe et al., 2011;
Lemay et al., 2010) partly explain positive versus negative
reactions toward attractive other-sex versus same-sex persons.
Future studies investigating the potential underlying processes
for attractiveness-based biases within and between ethnicities
would move us toward a better understanding of the observed
patterns. For instance, investigations might test more directly
whether particular target persons who vary in attractiveness
elicit perceptions of threat associated with either romantic riv-
alry or social comparison. Testing potential mechanisms
should also control for participants' sexual preference, as the
attention to the likely partner preferences might also explain
why gay or lesbian participants might not show the same reac-
tion patterns (Fo
¨rsterling et al., 2007).
Conclusion
The current studies are the first to show that positive (negative)
biases toward attractive opposite-sex (same-sex) persons of the
same ethnicity generalize across diverse ethnic backgrounds
(within-group effects; Study 1) but emerge almost exclusively
toward targets of the evaluator's own ethnic background
(between-group effects; Study 2). At a broader conceptual
level, this research provides support for the notion that the
motives underlying biases in social evaluation--including
10 Evolutionary Psychology
adaptive motives associated with mating and social compari-
son--seem to be manifested in relatively universal ways across
human cultures. At the same time, findings provide evidence
for important boundary conditions in how--and toward
whom--those motives are expressed. Overall, our studies high-
light the value of attending both to fundamental social motives
shaped by natural selection as well as to possible cultural influ-
ences when exploring biases in social perception.
