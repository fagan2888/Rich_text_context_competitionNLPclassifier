Context.--A prominent hypothesis regarding social inequalities in mortality is
that the elevated risk among the socioeconomically disadvantaged is largely due
to the higher prevalence of health risk behaviors among those with lower levels of
education and income.
Objective.--To investigate the degree to which 4 behavioral risk factors (ciga-
rette smoking, alcohol drinking, sedentary lifestyle, and relative body weight)
explain the observed association between socioeconomic characteristics and all-
cause mortality.
Design.--Longitudinal survey study investigating the impact of education,
income, and health behaviors on the risk of dying within the next 7.5 years.
Participants.--A nationally representative sample of 3617 adult women and
men participating in the Americans' Changing Lives survey.
Main Outcome Measure.--All-cause mortality verified through the National
Death Index and death certificate reviews.
Results.--Educational differences in mortality were explained in full by the
strong association between education and income. Controlling for age, sex, race,
urbanicity, and education, the hazard rate ratio of mortality was 3.22 (95% confi-
dence interval [CI], 2.01-5.16) for those in the lowest-income group and 2.34 (95%
CI, 1.49-3.67) for those in the middle-income group. When health risk behaviors
were considered, the risk of dying was still significantly elevated for the lowest-
income group (hazard rate ratio, 2.77; 95% CI, 1.74-4.42) and the middle-income
group (hazard rate ratio, 2.14; 95% CI, 1.38-3.25).
Conclusion.--Although reducing the prevalence of health risk behaviors in low-
income populations is an important public health goal, socioeconomic differences
in mortality are due to a wider array of factors and, therefore, would persist even
with improved health behaviors among the disadvantaged.

OVER THE PAST several decades,
health behavior or lifestyle factors--
smoking cigarettes, being overweight,
drinking alcoholic beverages, and being
physically inactive or leading a seden-
tarylifestyle--haveoftenbeencitedasthe

recently, differences in health outcomes
by socioeconomic position have been rec-
ognized as a persisting and perhaps even

In a number of longitudinal studies, im-

to be inversely associated with various
mortality outcomes, including prema-
ture mortality, cardiovascular mortality,
and death from all causes.13-18 In addition,
itiswelldocumentedthatpeopleoflower
socioeconomic position are significantly
more likely to lead a sedentary lifestyle,
to be overweight, and to smoke ciga-
rettes.19-22 Thus, a prominent hypothesis
is that the elevated mortality risk asso-
ciated with low levels of income and edu-
cationisprimarilyduetothehigherpreva-
lence of health risk behaviors among
peoplewhoarepoorand/orhavelowedu-
cational attainment.3,23-25 However, pre-

populations have found that strong dif-
ferences remain after controlling for ma-
jor lifestyle risk factors.16,18,26-29
For editorial comment see p 1745.
There are some serious limitations in
the samples of most prior prospective
studies on the contribution of health
risk behaviors to socioeconomic differ-
encesinmortality.Althoughpopulation-
based samples were used, the popula-
tions were generally confined to a lim-
ited geographic area, such as a single
city,county,orsmallregionofacountry,
and, in many cases, samples were
urther restricted by including only
males.16,18,20,26-29 In addition, much pre-
vious work has not provided a careful
analysis of 2 primary socioeconomic in-
dicators--education and income--even
though it is quite possible that the
mechanisms by which income and edu-
cation are related to health behaviors
and/or mortality differ significantly.
The degree to which health behaviors
explain or mediate the influence of socio-
economic factors on mortality has impor-
tant ramifications for health policy. The

METHODS
Study Design and Sample
The data analyzed for this study are
from the Americans' Changing Lives
(ACL)longitudinalsurveyconductedby
the University of Michigan Survey Re-
search Center. A stratified, multistage
area sample of noninstitutionalized per-
sons 25 years of age or older living in the
coterminous United States was selected
for study over time. Persons aged 60
years and older and blacks were over-
sampled. Initial face-to-face interviews
were conducted with 3617 persons in
1986, representing 70% of all sampled
householdsand68%ofsampledindividu-
als. Information on the independent
variablesbeingstudied(asdescribedbe-
low) was taken from the 1986 ACL wave
1 survey. Two subsequent waves were
conducted in 1989 and 1994. Additional
details on the ACL survey design and
methods are provided elsewhere.12,30
Information on deaths among sample
respondents from mid-1986 through
March 1994 was obtained from infor-
mants and through the National Death
Index. The main outcome variable is all-
cause mortality. In addition, underlying
causesofdeath(obtainedfromdeathcer-
tificates) were grouped into 4 categories
based on the International Statistical
ClassificationofDiseases,10thRevision
(ICD-10): (1) tumors, (2) cardiovascular
diseases,(3)allotherdiseases,and(4)ex-
ternal causes, such as unintentional in-
jury, suicide, homicide, or legal interven-
tion. To date, 90.3% of all deaths have
been verified with death certificates. Re-
portsofthe9.7%ofdeaths(n = 53)notyet
verified with death certificates were re-
viewed carefully, and actual death ap-
pearstobecertainineachcase.Forthese
cases, the month and year of death were
ascertained from information about the
deaths obtained from informants.
Socioeconomic Factors and
Other Sociodemographic Measures
The socioeconomic factors being stud-
ied are education and income, based on
self-reported information from the ACL
wave 1 survey. Education is measured
as respondents' total years of completed
educationandisgroupedasa3-category
classification: 0 through 11 years; 12
through 15 years; and 16 or more years.
Income is measured as the combined in-
come from all sources of the respondent
and his or her spouse in the preceding
year, and also is grouped into 3 catego-
ries: $0 through $9999; $10 000 through
$29 999; and $30 000 or more. More re-
finedcategoriesofeducationandincome
produced similar results for the analy-
ses presented, as did adding controls for
household size and assets.
Age is grouped into 6 categories: 25
through 34 years; 35 through 44 years;
45through54years;55through64years;
65 through 74 years; and 75 years or
older.Othersociodemographicvariables
being studied include sex (male vs fe-
male), race (nonblack vs black), and ur-
banicity of residence (central city, sub-
urban, or rural). Previous research has
foundthesedemographicvariablestobe
related to socioeconomic factors, health
riskbehaviors,andmortality.Thus,they
are included in the analysis primarily as
controls for potential confounders.
Behavioral Risk Factor Measures
Health behavior indicators are based
on self-reported information from re-
spondents at ACL wave 1. Cigarette
smoking is coded as never smoked,
former smokers, and current smokers.
Alcoholdrinkingiscodedusing3catego-
ries based on the number of drinks con-
sumed in the past month: nondrinkers
(0 alcoholic drinks in past month), mod-
erate drinkers (1-89 drinks), and heavy
drinkers (90 drinks). Body weight was
measured using the body mass index
(BMI), weight in kilograms divided by
the square of height in meters , based on
self-reported weight and height. The
body weight variable was coded as nor-
mal body weight, overweight, and un-
derweight. Following the methods of
Berkman and Breslow,1 those in the
highest15%oftheweightedsex-specific
BMI distributions were coded as over-
weight and those in the lowest 5% of the
weightedsex-specificBMIdistributions
were coded as underweight.
A physical activity index was com-
puted based on answers to questions re-
garding how often the respondent en-
gaged in active sports or exercise, gar-
dening or yard work, and taking walks.
Physical activity index scores were di-
vided into quintiles to create 5 group-
ingsofnear-equalsamplesize.Thegroup
in the top quintile represents the 21% of
the weighted sample that is the most
physically active.
HealthStatus.--Threevariableswere
available to measure baseline health sta-
tus: (1) self-rated health measured with a
single 5-category scale classified as ex-
cellent,verygood,good,fair,andpoor;(2)
thenumberofmajorchronicconditionsex-
perienced in the last year from a list of 10
conditions; and (3) an index of functional
status, with the lowest score of 1 repre-
senting confinement to a chair or bed and
the highest score of 4 representing the
ability to do heavy work inside or outside
the house.30
StatisticalAnalysis.--Inallanalyses,
the data were weighted to adjust for dif-
ferential response rates and variation in
probabilities of selection into the sample.
Poststratification weights adjust ACL
wave 1 sample results to the July 1, 1986,
Bureau of the Census population esti-
matesbysex,age,andregionofthecoun-
try. Descriptive statistics were obtained
through the Statistical Analysis System,
SAS Institute, Inc, Cary, NC, including
frequency distributions of all variables
being studied, cross tabulations of the
socioeconomic variables and health risk
behaviors, and cross tabulations of socio-
economic variables and mortality. In cre-
ating contingency tables regarding the
relationship between socioeconomic fac-
tors and health risk behaviors, direct
standardization to the age distribution of
theweightedACLwave1populationwas
usedtoaccountforthestrongassociation
betweenageandsocioeconomicfactors.31
The Cox proportional hazards model
was used to estimate the relative risk of
mortality in terms of various back-
ground, socioeconomic, and health be-
haviorvariables.Taylorserieslineariza-
tion procedures using SUDAAN, Re-
search Triangle Institute, Research
Triangle Park, NC, were used to make
adjustments to standard errors for the
complex sample design. The effects of
each independent variable being stud-
ied on mortality were analyzed sepa-
rately. A series of multiple predictor
models were then estimated. First, the
relative hazard rate of mortality was es-
timatedforincomeandeducationgroups
both separately and together, control-
ling for age, sex, race, and urbanicity.
Second, the behavioral risk factors be-
ingstudiedwereaddedtothebasemodel
to investigate how much of the socioeco-
nomic differentials in mortality could be
attributed to these factors. Models were
also run in which controls for baseline
health status were added and in which
possible interactive effects between
health behaviors and variables such as
education, income, sex, and race were
explored.

spondents (representing the national
population) were socioeconomically dis-

advantaged (Table 1). A total of 25.6% of
the weighted sample reported 0 to 11
years of education, and 19.2% reported
annual incomes of less than $10 000 at
ACL wave 1. A total of 546 respondents
(15.1% of the overall sample and 9.9% of
the weighted sample) died during the
7.5-yearfollow-upperiod.Thedeathsin-
cluded 255 males and 291 females, 338
nonblacks and 208 blacks, and 147 per-
sons younger than 65 years and 399 per-
sons aged 65 years and older.
The distribution of the 4 behavioral
risk factors being studied significantly
varied by educational attainment and
annual household income, adjusting for
age(Table2).Forexample,personswith
the least amount of education and with
the lowest incomes were significantly
more likely to be current smokers, over-
weight, and in the lowest quintile for
physical activity. Additional analyses
suggest that there was a high degree of
stability in individuals' health behaviors
across ACL study waves. For example,
ofthosewhowereoverweightatwave1,
84% were overweight at wave 2, and of
thosewhowerecurrentsmokersatwave
1, 79% were still smoking at wave 2.
Table 3 presents the hazard rate ra-
tiosofmortalitybyeducationandincome
for males and females separately. Those
with low educational attainment were
significantly more likely to die than
thosewith16ormoreyearsofeducation.
The relationship between education and
mortality and between income and mor-
tality was stronger for females. Both
men and women in the lowest-income
category were more than 3 times as
likely to die during the follow-up period
of the study than those in the highest
group, controlling for age and other so-
ciodemographic variables (Table 3).
While education was strongly related to
health behaviors, income was more pre-
dictive of mortality than education.
The relationship between socioeco-
nomic factors, health behaviors, and
mortality was explored by conducting a
sequence of Cox proportional hazards
models. The results of a model including
statistical controls for age, race, urban-
icity,sex,education,andincomearepre-
sented as model 1 in Table 4. The results
show that the effect of income on mor-
tality was strong and significant when
controlling for educational attainment
and background demographic variables.
However,whenthesesociodemographic
variables were considered simulta-
neously,thebivariateeffectofeducation
onmortalityattenuatedtoastatistically
insignificant level. Additional model
testing (results not shown) demon-
strated that the mechanism by which
education was related to mortality was
through its association with income.
When the 4 health behaviors being
studied were added individually to
model 1 (results not shown), the effect of
income on mortality attenuated slightly
yet remained significant for both the
lowest-income and the middle-income
groups. For example, when physical ac-
tivity was added to the model, the coef-
ficient for the effect of income attenu-
ated a small amount, suggesting that
physical activity explains only a small
proportion of the relationship between
income and mortality. The results of the
full model when all health behaviors
were considered simultaneously (model
2, Table 4) show that there was still a
strong and significant income effect on
mortality for both the middle-income
(odds ratio [OR] = 2.14; CI, 1.38-3.25)
and the low-income groups (OR = 2.77;
CI, 1.74-4.42). The 4 health behaviors to-
gether accounted for 12% to 13% of the
predictive effect of income on mortality.
Intermsofthehealthbehaviors,there-
sults suggest that being severely under-
weight or having lower levels of physical
activity were significant risk factors for
subsequent mortality, controlling for de-
mographic and socioeconomic character-
istics (Table 4). The relationship be-
tween physical activity and mortality
appearedtobemonotonic,suggestingthat

cally active but also from increasing

income group had significantly higher
rates of tumor deaths and cardiovascu-
lar disease deaths, and those in the
middle-income group had a significantly
higher rate of tumor deaths. Several
health behaviors were associated with a
significantly higher risk of death in spe-
cific categories (ie, both current and
former smoking was associated with an
increased risk of tumor deaths, heavy
drinking was associated with increased
risk of death from external causes, and
lowphysicalactivitywasassociatedwith
increased risk of tumor and cardiovas-
cular deaths). However, for both tumor

COMMENT
The ACL survey findings show that
lower levels of education and income are
associated with a significantly higher
prevalence of health risk behaviors, in-
cluding smoking, being overweight, and
physicalinactivity.Theresultsalsoshow
that lower income (net of demographic
characteristics) leads to a significant in-
crease in mortality risk, yet the influ-
ence of major health risk behaviors ex-
plains only a modest proportion of this
relationship.
Ourfindingsofstrongsocioeconomicdif-
ferencesinmortality(includinglargerso-
cioeconomicdifferentialsforwomenthan
men, and a stronger mortality effect for
income than for education for both wom-
en and men) are consistent with previous
longitudinalresearch.13-18 Inaddition,our
findings regarding the association be-
tween socioeconomic factors, health be-
haviors, and mortality are similar to pre-
vious studies conducted using limited
samples. For example, in a 20-year study

ing for smoking, alcohol consumption,

terns. Our results contribute to previous
studies by providing evidence regarding
the association between education, in-

cludes both men and women.
While there appears to be little debate
regardingtheneedtoimprovethehealth
of populations with low levels of income
and education, the appropriate focus of
policy and program responses is less
clear. An important area on which both
policy rhetoric and action have focused is
that of health education and health pro-
motion at the individual level. A tacit as-
sumption among some policymakers and
health authorities is that an important
way to reduce socioeconomic gaps in
health status is to improve the health be-
haviors among those with low levels of
incomeandeducation.Thispositionisob-
vious in the Department of Health and
Human Services' Healthy People 2000:
NationalHealthPromotionandDisease
Prevention Objectives and other reports
on the state of health among poor and mi-
noritypersonsintheUnitedStates.2,3,23-25
This position has also been articulated in
the lay press. For example, an opinion
piece in the Wall Street Journal32 criti-
cized public health researchers' growing
focus on social systems and institutions,
arguing that poor people tend to have
worse health and shorter life expectan-
cies,primarily"becauseunhealthyhabits
are more prevalent on the lower rungs of
the socioeconomic ladder."
Our results suggest that despite the
presence of significant socioeconomic dif-
ferentials in health behaviors, these dif-
ferencesaccountforonlyamodestpropor-
tion of social inequalities in overall
mortality.Thus,publichealthpoliciesand
interventionsthatexclusivelyfocusonin-
dividual risk behaviors have limited po-
tentialforreducingsocioeconomicdispari-
ties in mortality. While reducing the
prevalence of behavioral risk factors is an
important and critical public health goal,
socioeconomicdifferentialsinmortalityare
due to a wider array of factors and, there-
fore, would persist even with improved
health behaviors. Increasing health pro-
motion and disease prevention efforts
among the disadvantaged is not a "magic
policy bullet" for reducing persistent so-
cioeconomic disparities in mortality.
If health risk behaviors do not explain
much of the relationship between socio-
economic factors and mortality, what
else can account for this strong associa-
tion? First, differences in exposure to
occupational and environmental health
hazards across social strata do exist and,
thus, may be playing a role in mortality
inequalities.33-35 Second, although not a
panacea for eliminating socioeconomic
differences in health status, improved
equity regarding access to and use of
preventive and appropriate therapeutic
medical care is viewed as having some
potential for preventing the further de-
terioration of health in disadvantaged
populations.8,23,25,36-40
Third, socioeconomic stratification it-
self may be a social force that has delete-
rious health effects for those in the lower
strata. As Blane41 explains, socioeco-
nomic inequalities in societies "structure
the life experiences of their members so
that advantages and disadvantages tend
to cluster cross-sectionally and accumu-
late longitudinally." Persons in lower so-
cioeconomic strata have increased expo-
sure to a broad range of psychosocial
variablespredictiveofmorbidityandmor-
tality. This includes (1) a lack of social re-
lationships and social supports; (2) per-
sonality dispositions, such as a lost sense
ofmastery,optimism,senseofcontrol,and
self-esteem or heightened levels of an-
gerandhostility;and(3)chronicandacute
stressinlifeandwork,includingthestress
of racism, classism, and other phenom-
ena related to the social distribution of
power and resources.25,30,34,42-45 Further-
more, Lynch et al46 report that both the
psychosocial orientations and health risk
behaviors of adults are more common
among those whose parents were poor
when they were children. Thus, many in-
dividual characteristics, such as person-
ality factors, psychosocial attitudes and

Thereareanumberoflimitationsinour
study methods. First, the health behav-
iors being investigated were self-
reported and were not assessed retro-
spectively. Literature on the accuracy of
self-reported health behaviors suggests
that, although most people report hon-
estlyforbehaviorsthatarenotillegal,the
biases that do exist are in the direction
of underreporting negative health be-
haviors.48-50 Thus, the result of any prob-
lems in the reporting of health behav-
iors would likely be an underestimation
of their effects. Second, the length of the
follow-upperiodinthisprospectivestudy
limitsourabilitytoinvestigatethelonger-
term effects of income, education, and
health behaviors on mortality. Third, the
small number of deaths for some of the
demographic groups puts limits on the
multivariatesubgroupanalysisthatcould
be performed. Fourth, it is possible that
additional health behaviors and risk
factors not studied explain more of the
relationship between income and mor-
tality. Lynch et al26 report that, in a lon-
gitudinal study of Finnish men, the as-
sociation between socioeconomic status
and mortality from all causes and from
cardiovasculardiseasewaseliminatedby
simultaneousadjustmentforbiologicfac-
tors,psychosocialfactors,andhealthrisk
behaviors. A full explanation of social in-
equalities in mortality, however, needs
to address why all of these risk factors
tend to be patterned by socioeconomic
characteristics.
Our results suggest that both health
behaviors and socioeconomic factors are
important determinants of mortality.
While health behaviors are related to
bothincomeandeducation,theyaccount
for a small proportion of observed socio-
economic differences in mortality. Thus,
the problem of lifestyle and mortality is
not just one of inadequate education or
income, and the problem of socioeco-
nomic differentials in mortality is not
just a problem of lifestyle choices. We
must look to a broader range of explana-
tory risk factors, including structural el-
ements of inequality in our society.
