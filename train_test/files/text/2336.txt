Abstract
Background: Millions of rosacea sufferers are not being treated,
and the reasons they do not get treatment are not well
characterized. Objective: The aim of this study is to determine
the main reasons for visit, providers seen and treatments used for
rosacea. Methods: We used data from the National Ambulatory
Medical Care Survey for 1993­2010, tabulating the leading
reasons for visit, providers seen and treatments used in rosacea
visits. Results:There were 1 750 000 visits per year for rosacea. The
leading reasons for visit were other diseases of the skin (25.3%),
skin rash (19.6%), and discoloration or abnormal pigmentation
(14.7%). Dermatologists managed 72.4% of visits. The most
common treatments used were topical metronidazole (29.3%),
tetracycline (11.0%), minocycline (8.5%), doxycycline (7.9%), and
oral metronidazole (6.9%). Limitations: Some reasons for visit were
too nonspecific to provide good insight on why the patient made a
visit. Conclusions: Dermatologists manage rosacea most
commonly, but primary care physicians need the proper
training to diagnose it correctly. Improved strategies to reach
untreated people with rosacea are needed.
Key words: erythema, redness, primary care, NAMCS, reason for

Introduction
As many as 16 million Americans have rosacea, but less than 10%
are being treated for the disease at any given time (1). Since facial
redness carries social meaning, the triggers that motivate patients
to seek care for rosacea may include incidents in which facial
erythema is misinterpreted in social contexts by others who do
not understand the disease process (2). Papules and pustules
respond well to standard treatments, but only recently have
treatments been developed that are highly effective in reducing
redness (3,4). Frustration with treatments that do not relieve
redness symptoms, as well as the intermittent, flaring nature of the
disease in many patients, may contribute to poor adherence to
rosacea treatment (5,6).
The purpose of this study is to determine the main reasons for
office visits in rosacea patients, as well as the providers seen and
treatments used. Better understanding of the reasons rosacea
patients visit physicians may strengthen efforts to reach out to
patients not currently being treated.
Methods
We analyzed nationally representative data from the National
Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NAMCS), collected annually
by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) to assess the
provision of ambulatory patient care in the United States. Roughly
30 000 visits per year are selected by stratified random sampling,
and are weighted to produce national estimates of the number of
visits with particular characteristics. All outpatient visits to non-
federally-employed, office-based providers who provide direct
patient care are eligible for sampling. Collected data include
patient demographics, diagnoses, reasons for visit, treatments
used and providers seen.
In this study, visits in the 1993­2010 NAMCS with a diagnosis
of rosacea (ICD-9-CM code 695.3) were selected and the number
of rosacea visits to each specialty was recorded. The sole inclusion
criterion was a diagnosis of rosacea according to the ICD-9-CM
code. To describe the symptoms that caused patients eventually
diagnosed with rosacea to come to the office, reason-for-visit
codes linked to the selected visits were tabulated. The reason for
visit is intended to record as accurately as possible the patient's
complaint in their own words, often symptoms rather than
specific clinical diagnoses, and is not necessarily associated
with a particular clinical diagnosis (ICD-9-CM code) used for
billing. The reason-for-visit code is useful for identifying the
symptoms or events that led the patient to make a visit. Unlike
for the diagnosis, there is no specific reason-for-visit code defined
as "rosacea"; rosacea is included in a category called "other
diseases of the skin". Other reason-for-visit codes identify fre-
quently associated clinical symptoms, such as skin rash, or types
of routine visit, such as general medical examination.
To assess variation in patients' experience with different
physician specialties, leading reasons for visit in dermatology
and primary care visits were tabulated. Leading treatments pre-
scribed in each year were determined. Linear regression (SAS
PROC SURVEYREG) was used to assess changes over time in the
frequency with which specific rosacea treatments were used. All
data analysis was performed using SAS 9.2 (SAS Institute, Cary,
NC) and the study was declared exempt by the Wake Forest
Baptist Hospital Institutional Review Board.
Results
There were 1317 records weighted to
produce the estimate of 31.5 million (95% CI: 29.3­33.7 million)

rosacea visits, or 1 750 000 per year. The leading reasons for visit
included other diseases of the skin (25.3%), skin rash (19.6%),
discoloration or abnormal pigmentation (14.7%), acne or pimples
(11.9%) and general medical examination (6.0%; Table I). "Other
diseases of the skin" includes rosacea, as there is no separate
reason-for-visit code indicating rosacea. In dermatology visits, the
leading reasons were other diseases of the skin (31.0%), skin rash
(18.5%), discoloration or abnormal pigmentation (18.5%), acne or
pimples (14.5%) and dryness/peeling/scaling/roughness of skin
(6.2%). In primary care visits, the leading reason was skin rash
(25.8%). Other reasons had too few visits for a statistically valid
estimate, but included general medical examination, other dis-
eases of the skin, acne or pimples, and medication (other and
unspecified kinds).
Thirty-one percent of patient visits among all specialties were
classified as visits for a new problem. In these visits, the leading
reasons for visit were skin rash (29.1%), discoloration or abnormal
pigmentation (17.6%), other diseases of the skin (13.9%) and acne
or pimples (12.1%).
Rosacea visits were most commonly managed by dermatolo-
gists (72.4%), general and family practitioners (12.9%), internists
(7.0%) and ophthalmologists (3.4%; Table II). On a per physician
basis, dermatologists managed 159.8 visits annually per physician,
or about 77 times more than primary care physicians, who
managed 2.1 visits annually per physician.
The leading treatments prescribed were topical metronidazole
(29.3% of visits), tetracycline (11.0%), minocycline (8.5%), doxy-
cycline (7.9%) and oral metronidazole (6.9%; Table III).
Discussion
Rosacea is treated most often by dermatologists, but primary care
physicians also have an important role to play. Primary care
physicians typically observe rosacea in a general medical exam-
ination or in a visit with complaint of skin rash. By contrast,
the leading reason for visit to dermatologists was "other diseases
of the skin", probably indicating rosacea had already been
diagnosed. Discoloration or abnormal pigmentation was also a
common reason for visit to dermatologists, suggesting that
patients are bothered by the erythema associated with rosacea.
The leading treatments were all among those recognized as
effective for rosacea, suggesting that rosacea is being treated
appropriately once recognized (7,8). However, prescribing the
right treatment does not guarantee successful outcomes; more
studies are needed to determine why patients do not take their
rosacea medications as directed (9).
Based on the estimate of 16 million Americans having rosacea,
the number of rosacea visits observed in our study indicates that
at most 1 750 000, or 11%, of rosacea sufferers are receiving
treatment in an average year. The percentage could even be
considerably lower, to the extent that those patients who are
getting treated are making multiple visits. Primary care physicians
manage only about two visits per physician annually with a
diagnosis of rosacea, which may increase the likelihood of mis-
diagnosis. They also may code a more generic diagnosis code,
such as skin rash, or refer the patient without making a diagnosis.
Primary care physicians should be encouraged to refer patients
with possible rosacea symptoms to dermatologists if they are
uncertain of the correct diagnosis.
Limitations of the study include the lack of specificity in the
reason-for-visit codes available in the NAMCS. The NAMCS also
samples only single visits, so it is not possible to determine what
sequence of providers or treatments were used over the course of
multiple visits. The NAMCS also does not give specific clinical
data that would indicate whether a provider failed to diagnose
rosacea in a patient who had it. Patients who did not receive a
diagnosis of rosacea could not be included in the dataset. Despite
these limitations, the nationally representative sample improves
confidence in the overall picture of rosacea treatment patterns
presented here.

There are many opportunities to improve the care of rosacea
sufferers. Improving awareness among both patients and primary
care providers may increase the chance that people with rosacea
will get the care they need. Since non-dermatologists tend to get
very limited dermatology training, curricula should educate all
physician trainees on recognizing rosacea (10). Understanding the
typical patient experience with rosacea will then permit providers
to design appropriate tools for ensuring good adherence to the
therapies now available.
Capsule summary
. Many rosacea sufferers are not receiving effective treatment.
. Leading reasons for visit were other diseases of the skin,
skin rash, and abnormal pigmentation; dermatologists
managed almost three-quarters of visits.
. Obstacles to effective rosacea treatment include lack of
awareness, misdiagnosis and nonadherence.
