Article
People's intentions to be physically active are, according to
the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB; Ajzen, 1991, 2005),
one of the most important predictors of subsequent physical
activity behavior. In this sense, intention to be physically
active should predict future physical activity participation.
The World Health Organization (2004) states that "physical
activity is a fundamental means of improving the physical
and mental health of individuals" (p. 3). However, inactivity
levels are rising in many countries, increasing the prevalence
of non-communicable diseases, and thus negatively affecting
the general population health (World Health Organization,
2004). Interventions aiming to reverse this trend might ben-
efit from valid measures of intentions to engage in future
physical activity.
According to the TPB, peoples intentions to engage in
future physical activity is the most important predictor of sub-
sequent physical activity behavior (Ajzen, 1991), and the rela-
tionship between intention and behavior is well acknowledged
among researchers (Ajzen, 2005; Bandura, 1986). The inten-
tion­behavior relationship is well established, both theoreti-
cally (Ajzen, 2005; Bandura, 1986) and empirically (e.g.,
McEachan, Conner, Taylor, & Lawton, 2011). Indeed, de
Bruijn and van den Putte (2012) have argued that intention is
a necessary predictor of exercise behavior (see Erdvik,
Øverby, & Haugen, 2014, for more information regarding
the intention­behavior relationship). Research on the
Intentions to be Physically Active After Graduation (IPAG)
Questionnaire may therefore be of high relevance with
respect to the development of future Norwegian interven-
tions targeting adolescent's physical activity behavior, allow-
ing not only for the assessment of the intervention programs'
ability to influence on adolescents' physical activity behav-
ior but also its ability to positively influence physically
active adolescents who are at risk of taking on a physically
inactive lifestyle. Based on the former, measuring adoles-
cents' intentions to be active might help professionals and
academics in identifying groups that are at risk for taking on
a physically inactive lifestyle.

Translating, Reliability Testing, and
Validating a Norwegian Questionnaire
to Assess Adolescents' Intentions to
be Physically Active After High School
Graduation

Abstract
This study aimed to test the reliability and validity of a Norwegian measure of adolescents' intentions to be physically active
after graduation (the Intention to be Physically Active After Graduation [IPAG] Questionnaire). The development of IPAG
involved a translation and back-translation procedure and a test­retest study, performed on 105 adolescents (M age = 17.1,
SD = 0.6) from three different high schools in Kristiansand, Norway. The four IPAG items loaded on one single factor,
demonstrating acceptable factor loadings (.68-.90) and acceptable Cronbach's alpha values (.84 and .84) in both the test and
retest assessment. IPAG correlated positively with a measure of attitudes toward physical activity (.61-.71) and a measure of
participants' intentions to be physically active next month (.77-.82), supporting both construct validity and criterion-related
validity of the IPAG-Questionnaire. Acceptable reliability and validity of IPAG was found, which supports the use of this
instrument in future research.

The purpose of this study was to translate, test the reliabil-
ity, and validate a Norwegian version of a questionnaire
assessing students' intentions to be physically active after
graduation. The IPAG-Questionnaire was originally devel-
oped for use in a study by Hein, Müür, and Koka (2004) on
14- to 18-year-old adolescents, and has since been translated
into Spanish (Moreno, Moreno, & Cervelló, 2007) and used
in previous studies on Spanish adolescents (also called the
"Intention to be Physically Active Scale" [IPAS]; Almagro,
Sáenz-López, & Moreno, 2010; Moreno-Murcia, Huéscar
Hernández, & Cervelló, 2012). The herein validated IPAG
measure has also been used in Norwegian research by Erdvik
et al. (2014) assessing the contribution of self-determined
motivation in physical education to adolescents' intentions to
be physically activity after graduation. However, the IPAG-
Questionnaire has to the best of our knowledge not been vali-
dated for Norwegian adolescents. Research articles regarding
other Norwegian instruments assessing physical activity
intentions have to our knowledge not been published, and
have consequently not been made accessible to the research
community. In addition, compared with other measures of
physical activity intention (e.g., Escartí & Gutiérrez, 2001;
Hagger, Chatzisarantis, & Biddle, 2002; Ommundsen, unpub-
lished data), the IPAG-Questionnaire measures intentions in a
more distant future. One may also argue that the time per-
spective found in the IPAG-Questionnaire (i.e., intention to
be physically active after graduation) makes IPAG qualita-
tively different from other instruments. This difference may
also contribute to making IPAG a potentially useful instru-
ment in intervention studies aiming for long-term effects.
To make the IPAG-Questionnaire accessible for the use in
a Norwegian setting, this study involved translation, reliabil-
ity testing, and validation of IPAG. A translation back-
translation of the IPAG items was therefore performed,
before the instrument was subject to a test­retest procedure
for the assessment of reliability, criterion-related validity,
and construct validity of the IPAG-Questionnaire.
Method
Participants
Second-year students attending three different high schools in
Kristiansand, Norway, were invited to take part in the study,
which was approved by the Norwegian Social Science Data
Services (NSD). The data collection took place in the months
of November and December 2012. Informed consent was
given by participants prior to responding to the question-
naire, and the participants were free to withdraw from the
study at any time. One hundred fifty-two second-year high
school students participated in the test­retest study, of which
105 adolescents (66 boys and 76 girls; M age = 17.1, SD =
0.6) provided complete responses in both test and retest pro-
cedure, forming the basis for subsequent reliability and
validity testing.
Instruments
Development of the IPAG-Questionnaire. The four items of the
IPAG-Questionnaire were translated into Norwegian using
the method of forward and back-translation, following the
guidelines proposed by Kvamme et al. (1998). The questions
were translated from their original English format producing
two separate Norwegian versions: one proposed by the first
author, another by a bilingual British colleague working at
the Institute of Foreign Languages and Translation. Bearing
elements of the two separate translations in mind, the transla-
tions were then merged to produce one single Norwegian
version. The bilingual associate professor translated the Nor-
wegian version back into English and assisted comparing the
back-translated items with the four original English ques-
tionnaire items to ensure that the correct meaning of the con-
tent was retained. Through this process, the Norwegian items
were changed to better reflect nuances in the English word-
ing and subsequent understanding (see Table 1).
The IPAG-Questionnaire consists of four questions con-
cerning students' intentions to be physically active after
graduation. Students reported their intentions to be active
after graduation on a 7-point Likert-type scale anchored from
(1) strongly disagree to (7) strongly agree. Students were
asked to consider the following statements: (1) "I'm inter-
ested in developing my physical fitness"; (2) "Outside PE
lessons, I like to do sport"; (3) "After graduation, I would
like to take part in sport club training"; (4) "After graduation,
I would like to be physically active." The mean score of the
four items was derived into an index representing respond-
ers' IPAG (Hein et al., 2004).

Because Russel and Bobko (1992) recommend the use of
7-point Likert-type scales over 5-point scales and Dawes
(2008) argues that changing scale format does not necessar-
ily destroy the comparability of historical data, IPAG was
validated on a 7-point Likert-type scale.
Attitudes.A questionnaire assessing attitudes toward physi-
cal activity was included in the test­retest questionnaire.
This questionnaire asks for respondents' attitudes toward
physical activity and was derived from research by Lorent-
zen (2007). The questionnaire was based on the following
statements (originally in Norwegian): "Being regularly phys-
ically active, the next month will to me be [sic]": (1) "stupid"
to (7) "wise," (1) "harmful" to (7) "valuable" [sic], (1) "use-
less" to (7) "useful," (1) "wrong" to (7) "right," (1) "trouble-
some" to (7) "easy," (1) "unpleasant" to (7) "pleasant," (1)
"bad" to (7) "good," (1) "boring" to (7) "interesting." One
represented the most negative attitude and seven the most
positive. As in the study by Lorentzen (2007), no definition
of regular physical activity was given.
Intention to be Physically Active Next Month (INM-Q).A six-
item questionnaire measuring adolescents' intentions to be
physically active next month (INM-Q) was also included in
the test­retest questionnaire. This instrument was derived
from research by Ommundsen (unpublished data). All ques-
tions were anchored on a 7-point Likert-type scale, of which
four were anchored from (1) "no, absolutely not" to (7) "yes,
absolutely" (e.g., "I intend to be regularly physically active
within the next month"), whereas the two last items were
anchored (1) "very unlikely" to (7) "very likely" (e.g., "How
likely is it that you will be regularly physically active during
the next month?"). The INM-Q has been validated for use by
Ommundsen (unpublished data) who reported a Cronbach's
alpha of .95 for the six-item subscale.
Respondents were also asked to report age and gender
(boy/girl) as a demographic data.
Procedure
This study involved a test­retest procedure for the validation
of the IPAG-Questionnaire. Physical activity intentions were
considered to be relative stable and, for the validation the
IPAG-Questionnaire, adolescents' were thus asked to answer
the same questions two times with 1 week between test and
retest. The test­retest procedure allowed for the calculation
of test­retest reliability coefficients for each of the four sin-
gle items comprising the IPAG-Questionnaire. Single items
were considered ordinal data and indexes were considered
interval data.
Statistical Analyses
Several statistical analyses were performed to assess the reli-
ability and validity of the IPAG-Questionnaire. Whereas test
and retest measures concerning the complete IPAG-
Questionnaire was considered continuous and normally dis-
tributed, data on each single item constituting the
IPAG-Questionnaire was considered ordinal (categories
from 1 to 7). Consequently, test­retest correlations and
paired difference tests between single items were assessed
through non-parametric analyses (Spearman's rank correla-
tion and Wilcoxon-signed ranks test), and test­retest mea-
sures concerning the complete IPAG index were assessed
through parametric analyses (Pearson's correlation and
paired sample t test).
In an attempt to embed the measure of adolescents' inten-
tions to be physically active after graduation in a nomologi-
cal network (Cronbach & Meehl, 1955), the survey also
assessed other constructs which were thought to be related to
the IPAG-Questionnaire. Based on the measured constructs,
criterion-related and construct validity of the IPAG-
Questionnaire were examined. Criterion-related validity
may, according to DeVellis (2012), be assessed through the
investigation of empirical association between a measure
and some criterion. Consequently, a measure of intention to
be physically active next month (INM-Q; Ommundsen,
unpublished data) was used as a criterion for the validation
of the IPAG-Questionnaire. As the two questionnaires mea-
suring physical activity intentions (IPAG and INM-Q) were
assumed to measure the somewhat same characteristics, the
INM-Q was theoretically assumed to be positively related to
the IPAG-Questionnaire without sharing a large degree of
variance. According to DeVellis (2012), a measures con-
struct validity is reflected in "the extent to which a measure
`behaves' the way that the construct it purports to measure
should behave with regard to established measures of other
constructs" (DeVellis, 2012, p. 53). Construct validity of
IPAG was assessed in this study through the comparison of
adolescents'attitudes toward physical activity with scores on
the IPAG-Questionnaire. According to the TPB (Ajzen,
1985, 1991), attitudes (together with perceived behavioral
control and social norms regarding physical activity) are
among the most important predictors of intention to be phys-
ically active. Thus, there should be a positive relationship
between participants' attitudes toward physical activity and
their intentions to be physically active after graduation.
Criterion-related validity and construct validity were deter-
mined through the assessment of differences in mean between
IPAG and the two other measured constructs. The test­retest
correlation between items and potential statistically significant
differences between the test and retest assessment regarding
the same items were assessed using Wilcoxon-signed rank
test. Furthermore, the subscale total from test and retest were
assessed by comparing the mean and standard deviation from
the test- and retest-assessments, and correlating test and retest
values. A paired t test was utilized to ensure that there was no
statistically significant difference between data from the two
measurement procedures. Furthermore, psychometric proper-
ties of the IPAG-Questionnaire were assessed through

Results
The average age of respondents in the test­retest procedure
was 17.1 (±0.6). The sample consisted of 66 boys (46.5%)
and 76 girls (53.5%). Results revealed strong correlations
between test and retest measures of single items within the
same subscale (r = .67-.83, p < .01) and no significant differ-
ences between test and retest measures of subscale items
were identified (see Table 2). With respect to the IPAG-
Questionnaire as a whole, test and retest responses were
highly correlated (r = .85, p < .01).
Analyses revealed that the four IPAG items loaded on one
single factor, demonstrating acceptable factor loadings (.68-
.90) and acceptable Cronbach's alpha values (.84 and .84) in
both the test and retest assessment (see Table 3).
The assessment of criterion-related validity and construct
validity of the IPAG revealed strong correlations with both
the INM-Q and the measure of attitudes (see Table 4).
Discussion
The purpose of the study was to assess the reliability and
validity of the Norwegian IPAG-Questionnaire. The IPAG-
Questionnaire utilized in this study represents a Norwegian
version of the scale developed by Hein and colleagues (2004,
see Table 1). Research results provided preliminary evidence
forsoundpsychometricpropertiesoftheIPAG-Questionnaire.
Results from the present test­retest analyses, which were
performed on high school students (age 16-18 years), indi-
cate that participants' test and retest responses were consis-
tent. In line with the results from Hein and colleagues (2004),
the four items all loaded onto one single factor and, like in
the original version, the items demonstrated strong factor
loadings (.68-.90 vs. Hein et al.: .67-.79). Strong factor load-
ings of the IPAG-Questionnaire has also been reported in
research by Moreno et al. (2007; .86-.94), using a Spanish
five-item version of the questionnaire. Hein and colleagues
(2004) obtained a Cronbach's alpha value of .80 in their vali-
dation study. Previous research on the Spanish (five-item)
IPAG-Questionnaire has revealed Cronbach's alpha values
from .75 to .94 (Almagro et al., 2010; Moreno et al., 2007).

identified in the validation of the Norwegian version of IPAG
through analyzing both test ( = .84) and retest ( = .84) data.
Overall, we consider the results to support the validity of the
IPAG-Questionnaire.
In a test­retest it is important to consider the time elapsing
between the two assessments (Allen & Yen, 1979). This is
because of limitations related to test­retest reliability testing
of questionnaires, like the potential for learning, carryover
effects and recall effects (Allen &Yen, 1979; Marx, Menezes,
Horovitz, Jones, & Warren, 2003). According to Marx et al.
(2003), most researchers have chosen a time interval between
test and retest ranging from 2 days to 2 weeks. This time
frame is generally perceived to be a reasonable compromise
in avoiding both the recollection bias and actual changes in
the empirically measured phenomenon (Marx et al., 2003).
The reliability of a measure may appear low if the time inter-
val between assessments is relatively long, and the socio-
psychological construct is unstable (Allen & Yen, 1979). The
measure of adolescents' intentions to be physically active
next month was considered less stable than the measure of
intention to be physically active after graduation. The longer
time interval between the two assessments, the more changes
one need to expect in subsequent answers (Allen & Yen,
1979). Hence, in an attempt to strengthen the reliability of
the present study, the retest assessment was performed the
week following the test-assessment. However, whether the
herein chosen time interval is too short or too long is difficult
to determine. Nevertheless, considering that the IPAG-
Questionnaire measures intentions in a more distant future,
considerable change from 1 week to another was not
expected.
The study results revealed a strong correlation between
IPAG and Lorentzen's (2007) measure of adolescents' atti-
tudes toward physical activity (test = .61, retest = .71). This
indicates that respondents who intend to be more physically
active after graduation also possess more positive attitudes
toward physical activity. However, the IPAG-Questionnaire
appears to correlate even stronger with the INM-
Questionnaire by Ommundsen (unpublished data; test = .77,
retest = .82), showing that intention to be physically active
next month is strongly associated with adolescents' inten-
tions to be physically active after graduation. Altogether,
these findings support both construct validity and criterion-
related validity of the IPAG-Questionnaire and strengthens
the assumption that the questionnaire is adequate for measur-
ing adolescents' intentions to be physically active after
graduation.
However it should be noted that, despite researchers
acknowledging intention as a predictor of behavior (Webb &
Sheeran, 2006), it is still not completely clear to which degree
intention to be physically active after graduation has the abil-
ity to predict future behavior. It has been identified that 24%
to 60% of reported intentions are followed by behavior, with
the occurrence of physical activity behavior being dramati-
cally lower in the group of non-intenders than in the group of
intenders (de Bruijn & van den Putte, 2012; Rhodes,
Courneya, & Jones, 2003; Sheeran, 2002). The fact that inten-
tion may be considered a prerequisite of exercise behavior,
physical activity intentions among youth should be consid-
ered relevant in a public health perspective. However, it
should be noted that assessing the predictive validity of IPAG
has not been of focus in the present study and longitudinal
research is necessary to further determine the predictive abil-
ity of the IPAG-Questionnaire and similar instruments.
Another limitation in this study is related to the criterion-
related validity of the IPAG-Questionnaire being determined
through comparison with an unpublished intention measure,
because this was the only identified Norwegian measure of
physical activity intentions. The current study also has lim-
ited information about participants with regards to relevant
background information such as demographics and physical
activity level. Moreover, the sample only consists of 105
seventeen-year-old adolescents from one medium-sized city
in Norway. These limitations should be considered when
interpreting the findings from this work, and future research
would do well to further explore the validity of the
IPAG-Questionnaire.
Conclusion
This aim of this study was to assess the reliability and valid-
ity of four questionnaire items originally developed by Hein
et al. (2004) for the measurement of students'intentions to be
physically active after graduation. The IPAG-Questionnaire
appears to be acceptable for use among Norwegian adoles-
cents in the age of 16 to 18 years. The reliability and validity
of the questionnaire was supported and it seems reasonable
to justify the use of this instrument in future research.
