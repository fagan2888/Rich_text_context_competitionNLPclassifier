Article
This study explored the first author's experiences with her
undergraduate students as they engaged in collaborative
learning (CL; Peters & Armstrong, 1998) in an intermediate
Japanese language course at a university in the United States.
She had recently incorporated CL into her repertoire of lec-
ture and discussion methods of teaching and learning. This
change required students to learn how to learn differently in
a traditional academic environment. For example, instead of
relying on her expertise alone, the instructor asked students
to engage in dialogue with other students and her, about vari-
ous interpretations of readings, related language concepts,
and aspects of Japanese culture. Their goal was to jointly
construct new knowledge about these topics, knowledge that
individual members of the class were unlikely to construct
on their own. To understand how course participants experi-
enced this change in pedagogy and its potential as a compo-
nent of her future classroom teaching and learning strategies,
the instructor conducted an ethnographic action research
project. Following is a brief description of related literature
and theory, the research method, findings, and discussions of
results and implications of the study.
CL
CL permeates the discourse of teaching and learning in
higher education and is widely accepted as a legitimate peda-
gogy, especially by those who value peer-to-peer learning.
For example, Dillenbourg (1999) defines CL as "a situation
in which two or more people learn or attempt to learn some-
thing together" (p. 1). Bruffee (1984, 1995, 1999, 2003), per-
haps the best known proponent of CL in the higher education
classroom, views CL as a kind of non-foundational learning
process in which students work in groups or with members
of knowledge communities that are larger and more complex
than their own. The purpose of CL in this case is re-accultur-
ation; that is, students change their membership from one
learning culture to another through negotiating and modify-
ing the language and values established from the original
community and becoming fluent in the language of the new
community. For example, a college-bound, high school grad-
uate may have learned how to learn in a K-12 situation but
may not have anticipated different ways of learning required
in college, especially how knowledge is created. The aim of
CL in this case would be for the student to transition success-
fully from his or her K-12 education into the broader aca-
demic community and the ways of knowing characteristic of
the discipline he or she chooses to study.
According to Bruffee, students in higher education should
be expected to examine critically their taken-for-granted

Collaborative Learning in a Japanese
Language Course: Student and Teacher
Experiences
Megumu D. Burress1 and John M. Peters1
Abstract
This article describes ethnographic action research that explored experiences of the first author and her undergraduate
students as they engaged in collaborative learning (CL) activities in a university Japanese language course. The purpose of
the study was to generate new practical knowledge of CL for her, so that she might subsequently improve her teaching
practice. A thematic analysis of the interview and descriptive data revealed that the incorporation of CL helped promote a
comfortable environment and reduce the effects of the hierarchical authority of the instructor. While facing new challenges,
the class also co-constructed its own knowledge about the reading content, language concepts, and cultural matters by
working as a collaborative group. These findings are represented in the form of a performative text that invites readers to
actively engage with the study's findings.

beliefs based on earlier, foundational learning experiences.
They should also inquire with others who may hold different
assumptions, beliefs, and values, all in the interest of broad-
ening and growing their own knowledge. For Bruffee, this
process is best supported by "abnormal discourse" (Rorty,
Williams, & Bromwich, 1980) that enables students to
establish knowledge or justify beliefs collaboratively by
challenging each other's biases and presuppositions; by
negotiating collaboratively toward new paradigms of perception,
thought, feeling, and expression; and by joining larger, more
experienced communities of knowledgeable peers through
assenting to those communities' interests, values, language, and
paradigms of perception and thought. (Bruffee, 1984, p. 646)
Bruffee and other widely cited writers about CL (e.g.,
Barnes, 2004; Panitz, 1999; Rochelle & Teasley, 1995) are
especially concerned that students come to value their own,
collaboratively developed knowledge and rely less automati-
cally on their assumptions about the authority of knowledge.
This extends to discipline-specific knowledge, including
knowledge held by an instructor considered a representative
of his or her discipline. However, nearly all CL scholars posi-
tion the instructor apart from their students in this regard and
none identifies the instructor as a purposeful co-constructor
of knowledge alongside the students (Johnson, Johnson, &
Smith, 2007). Nevertheless, as Dillenbourg (1999) points
out, this positioning by the instructor can profoundly affect
the nature of students' interaction with them and other stu-
dents. This brings into question how free students really are
in terms of their ability to co-construct knowledge outside
limits set by the instructor.
Peters and Armstrong (1998) proposed a typology of
teaching and learning that positions the instructor's relation-
ship to students differently according to type of teaching and
learning involved. Their typology consists of three types of
teaching and learning. Type I (T-I) involves "teaching by
transmission, learning by reception"; Type II (T-II) is called
"teaching by transmission, learning by sharing"; and Type III
(T-III) is "collaborative learning" (Peters & Armstrong,
1998, pp. 78-79).
Closely resembling Freire's (1970) banking concept, T-I
represents a traditional type of teaching and learning. The
focus of T-I is on the subject matter that reflects philosophy
and expertise of the teacher and members of his or her disci-
pline. The teacher is the primary source of information, and
the flow of information primarily goes from teacher to stu-
dent. Thus, the primary mode of discourse is monologue and
the focus is on individual student learning. Examples of T-I
include lecture accompanied by demonstration, drill, and
repetition (Peters & Armstrong, 1998).
T-II involves more interaction among students who are
seen as already having knowledge and experiences that they
may use to help them develop new knowledge. As in T-I, the
focus is on individual learning and the teacher still serves as
the primary source of information. Information flows from
teacher to student and student to teacher, and student to stu-
dent as they learn by sharing within small groups. The pri-
mary mode of discourse is discussion. Lecture followed by
discussions exemplifies this type (Peters & Armstrong,
1998).
In T-III, the teacher and students work together to co-con-
struct new knowledge. The teacher becomes a member of the
group, and communication flows from member to member,
member to group as a whole, and group to member. Thus,
individual members learn, and the group as a whole learns.
This conception of CL is rooted in a social constructionist
view of knowledge (Gergen, 1999). In this perspective,
knowledge is generated within relationships from which
humans derive their conceptions of what is real, rational, and
good.
The primary mode of discourse in T-III is dialogue.
Although they may have specific knowledge of the topic, the
instructor is not presumed sole expert in the classroom.
Students are expert in their own lives, including, in some
cases, prior experience with the subject matter. Whereas in
T-II the instructor facilitates works from the outside, in T-III
he or she facilitates from the inside of the group. Group and
individual members learn through critical reflection on past
experience as well as what Schön (1983) calls reflection in
action. Because of its interactive nature and inclusiveness,
T-III appears strongly related to what Garrison, Anderson,
and Archer (2010) call a community of inquiry (cf. Skinner
& Peters, 2014).
Even though each type of teaching and learning is distinc-
tive in terms of its purpose and other dynamics, the typology
should be viewed as a set or grouping of types, not as a hier-
archy, continuum, or stages of teaching and learning. One
type is no more or less important than the others at any given
time in the classroom experience. An instructor could use all
three types across multiple class sessions or one, two, or
three types in one session. The goal is to achieve a balance in
types, with each serving in harmony with the other two
(Skinner & Peters, 2012, 2014).
Students and instructors already know how to act and
what to expect of one another in T-I classrooms and, in some
instances, T-II settings. However, studies show that T-III can
be particularly difficult for students to learn how to negotiate
successfully, especially in the beginning of a T-III experience
(Armstrong, 1999; Burress, 2013; Creekmore, 2011; Crosse,
2001). It appears that students need time to adjust to different
working relationships with each other and the instructor after
a lifetime of mostly T-I and T-II classroom experiences
(Burress, 2013). Instructors may also struggle with T-III in
terms of their own goals and interests, such as the need to
share responsibility for the learning process with students
more so than in T-I and T-II learning (Cross, 1999).
According to a review of literature by Slavich and
Zimbardo (2012), T-III helps students "restructure their own
knowledge and understanding of concepts . . . recognize gaps
Burress and Peters 3
in their understanding, synthesize, communicate, and discuss
ideas in ways that advance conceptual understanding, (and
engage in) modeling of effective problem solving strategies"
(p. 574). T-III extends these benefits to instructors, yet little
is said in the literature about the instructor's role as purpose-
ful co-learner. However, it is clear that instructors have
opportunities to reveal their ways of thinking and learning
about the subject matter, including ways of knowing preva-
lent in their discipline. These opportunities allow instructors
to model the processes of critical thinking, joint construction
of knowledge, and dialogical communication, while facilitat-
ing students' participation in the process.
Other studies report positive learning experiences and
outcomes in classroom settings across several disciplines.
For example, Merrill (2003) examined her own and her stu-
dent's experiences with CL in a community college informa-
tion technology course. Her ethnographic analysis indicated
that CL was helpful in creating a comfortable learning envi-
ronment, building relationships between members, and
developing an understanding of differing perspectives among
participants. Similarly, Gray (2008) engaged her freshman
composition class in CL alongside both T-I and T-II. A the-
matic analysis of her data revealed that engagement in CL
helped her students gain confidence as writers, learn their
writing strengths and weaknesses as well as those of others,
and improve their writing skills. CL also provided increased
opportunities for the creation of an open, comfortable, and
safe classroom environment characterized by critical reflec-
tion and idea generation.
Finally, Li (2011) investigated how a group of her Chinese
university students made meaning of their CL experiences as
they engaged in an Intensive English reading course. The
students were 19 to 20 years of age, and their English profi-
ciency was intermediate to high. Based on a phenomenologi-
cal analysis of students' interviews and class reflections and
her field notes, Li concluded that the incorporation of CL
helped promote positive interpersonal relationships among
students, increase their confidence in speaking English,
improve their engagement in learning, and change their
thinking about teacher and student roles. Li's study is of par-
ticular interest because her course shares some features of
the course that was the focus of the present study: for exam-
ple, both courses involved learning of a second language, the
introduction of an unfamiliar way of teaching and learning,
and students who were at the intermediate level of language
proficiency.
To our knowledge, no other research has investigated for-
eign language classroom settings, including Japanese, to
examine student and teacher engagement in CL as defined in
this article. Nevertheless, the aforementioned research and
the first author's graduate studies in CL gave impetus to her
decision to incorporate CL in the intermediate Japanese lan-
guage course she facilitated in 2009 and to study how she
and the students experienced the process. Her research ques-
tion was "How do students and instructor experience the
inclusion of CL (T-III) as one type of teaching in the interme-
diate Japanese language course?" The following is a discus-
sion of how the study unfolded.
Context of the Study
The intermediate Japanese language course consisted of 26
undergraduate students, ages 19 and 20. The majority were
native English speakers and were traditional students who
enrolled in the university immediately after high school. The
group met for a 50-min session 4 times a week for one
14-week academic semester. The instructor decided to add
CL to her usual T-I and T-II repertoire. The latter types
included lectures or presentations used to introduce new
vocabulary and grammar patterns, as well as discussions of
these grammar patterns and their usage and conjugations
(lecture and drill sessions). The instructor reasoned that CL
would not be appropriate pedagogy for these aspects of the
course as they typically involved right or wrong answers and
that T-I and T-II were better suited. On the other hand, the
instructor reasoned that CL would be particularly applicable
to sessions in which assigned readings, such as biographic
literature, were discussed. Knowing that CL is a process that
engages students and instructor in joint construction of new
knowledge, it seemed especially suited to readings involving
controversial issues and cultural matters that generally did
not call for right or wrong answers. In addition, as her stu-
dents had already attained the intermediate level of language
proficiency, the instructor believed that she and her students
could go beyond the development of basic language skills to
explore and construct knowledge through readings and dia-
logue about the Japanese language and culture.
In the reading sessions of the course, students and instruc-
tor sat in a large circle and engaged in dialogue (Bohm, 1996;
Isaacs, 1999), in both Japanese and English, about assigned
readings that they previously read in small groups. To engage
in dialogue means to be sensitive to what is happening in the
moment of discourse, develop shared meanings, and act in
ways that nurture participants' ways of being together, such
as listening, reflecting, and valuing (Isaacs, 1999). Dialogue
also involves mindfully attending to and cultivating knowl-
edge that is being constructed by individual participants and
jointly with others. Therefore, the instructor positioned her-
self as part of the group, and she and students assumed
mutual responsibility for joint construction of new knowl-
edge. The process of dialogue began with the instructor's
open-ended questions to students, such as "What stood out to
you about this reading?" "Which part of the reading did you
find particularly striking or resonating?" and "Which part
did you continue to struggle to understand?" Students were
encouraged to ask their own open-ended questions to other
students and the instructor. The group then considered these
questions in terms of all aspects of the reading materials,
including language, cultural matters, and specific contents of
the readings. The questions asked by students and the
4 SAGE Open
instructor encouraged various responses and these responses
led to additional questions, responses, and reflections.
Instead of looking for predetermined answers or relying on
the instructors' expertise, participants allowed discourse to
emerge spontaneously from their moment-to-moment expe-
riences and diverse voices. The instructor encouraged stu-
dents to communicate in Japanese as much as possible to
further develop their language skills.
Method
The instructor decided to study her own and her students'
experiences with CL in the course for three reasons: (a) the
experience was new to all participants, including the instruc-
tor, and she assumed that the most direct route to understand-
ing participants' experience was to seek their first-person
reports of the experience; (b) the action research by Gray
(2008), Li (2011), and Merrill (2003) yielded data that helped
improve their respective teaching practices, and it seemed
reasonable to assume that the instructor in the present
instance would benefit from a similar undertaking; and (c)
her findings could contribute to related literature.
To examine the students' and her own experiences in the
CL reading sessions, the instructor selected a qualitative
research method known as performance ethnography
(Conquergood, 1998). The purpose of utilizing this method
was not only to capture how students experienced CL but
also to represent the findings in a style more accessible than
conventional approaches that rely on summary displays of
findings.
Data sources consisted of the instructor's field notes and
individual phenomenological interviews with volunteer stu-
dents. Following Bogdan and Biklen's (2007) suggestion,
the field notes consisted of two kinds of notations: descrip-
tive and reflective. The instructor's field notes were used to
portray the participants and the research setting, describe
particular events and activities during the CL reading ses-
sions, as well as capture the instructor's thoughts and feel-
ings about the method, related ethical dilemmas and conflicts
(e.g., relational concerns), and her frame of mind (e.g., her
own assumptions and beliefs) while conducting the study.
All students were invited to participate in the study, and
seven of them volunteered. This number of participants fell
within the acceptable range of participants (n = 6-12) in phe-
nomenological studies as established by Thomas and Pollio
(2002). None of these participants had engaged in CL in
classroom settings prior to this study. For the interview data,
each of the seven volunteer study participants and instructor
met for an approximately 1-hour, audio-recorded interview
about each student's experience with the CL reading ses-
sions. The interview followed a phenomenological proce-
dure described by Thomas and Pollio (2002). It began with
the question, "What was your experience with our CL read-
ing sessions like?" This question was designed to make pos-
sible a broad range of descriptive responses while also
focusing the students on the topic of their CL experiences.
This was followed by some probing questions that were
derived from the participants' responses to the first question
and subsequent responses. Probing questions or requests
(e.g., "Please say more about that . . . ") were designed to
increase the richness of a participant's description of his or
her experience. Instead of being in control of the direction of
the interview, the instructor/interviewer approached the pro-
cess from the "humble stance of perpetual learner" (Thomas,
2005, p. 73). Overall, the goal of the data collection was to
obtain from the students a rich description of the CL experi-
ences from their individual perspectives.
After the interviews were completed, the instructor tran-
scribed interview recordings into a Word document for
analysis. She then iteratively engaged with the data, read-
ing and re-reading the transcripts for salient themes to the
point of redundancy. Seeking to identify key themes of
experience that surpassed the variations presented in indi-
vidual accounts, she attended to broad patterns--first
within each individual's data and then across the data set. In
this process, in vivo codes (the actual words used by the
informant) were utilized to demarcate shifts in meaning and
describe areas of significance to the experience within the
data, as well as sociologically constructed codes (this sum-
mary glosses over what the informant seemed to be describ-
ing) to identify recurring patterns and organize the data set
(Coffey & Atkinson, 1996). Theme redundancy occurred
after analysis of six transcripts; therefore, the seventh tran-
script was not analyzed. The instructor also read her field
notes to gain additional insights into the contextual back-
ground of the themes. The second author assisted with the
thematic analysis, providing an additional perspective and
interpretation of the data.
Findings
The back-and-forth interpretation and dialogue resulted in
identification of four themes: (a) learning environment, (b)
process and outcomes of learning, (c) responsibilities for
teaching and learning, and (d) resistance to engaging in dia-
logue. Below is a brief description of each of these themes.
1. Learning environment: The physical surroundings,
psychological or emotional conditions, and social or
cultural influences affecting the teaching and learn-
ing of a course participant and the group.
2. Process and outcomes of learning: Actions taken
(what and how) individually and collectively in an
effort to achieve the goal of CL, that is, co-construc-
tion of new knowledge. What was gained, improved,
constructed, and achieved as a result of the CL
experience.
3. Responsibilities for teaching and learning: The
authority and power one has to manage and direct the
course of his or her learning. The relationship of
Burress and Peters 5
power between the group members, both the students
and the teacher, as a classroom community.
4. Resistance to engaging in dialogue: Hesitation,
reluctance, or refusal of a participant to engage in
class dialogue either in English or Japanese.
To afford greater access to the meaning of these themes,
they were organized and represented in the form of a perfor-
mative text (Madison, 2008). In this research context, perfor-
mance refers to "an interpretive event involving actors,
purposes, scripts, stories, stages, and interactions" (Denzin,
2003, p. 8). The text was constructed based on the thematic
structure of the findings as well as the manner that students
and instructor engaged in a dialogical conversation in the
Japanese classroom. The text was edited to make it more
readable than would be the case if verbatim quotes taken from
transcripts and notes were used instead. However, the original
voices of the participant interviews and in the instructor's
field notes were maintained as much as possible. The purpose
was to make the verbal exchanges as authentic as possible as
the participants were imaginarily situated in a circle where
they interwove their utterances into a dialogical conversation.
Upon construction of the text, the relationship was ensured
between the text and the findings by relating all parts of the
text back to the themes to which they corresponded.
As the data were collected and analyzed, the authors prac-
ticed recursive reflexivity (Pillow, 2003). This proved espe-
cially helpful to the first author/instructor. Even though she
attempted to suspend her assumptions and biases during the
analysis, she also recognized that her relationship with the
students might have affected various aspects of the study. For
example, she ascribed grades in the course during the same
time as the interviews. This is one instance in which the
power differential between students and instructor had to be
acknowledged. During the interviews, the instructor worked
to minimize this effect by emphasizing to the participants her
promise of no harm or penalties based on any aspect of their
participation or lack of participation. Nevertheless, one can-
not assume that this attempt completely freed the interviews
from the power dynamic of the teacher­student relationship.
Indeed, the study's findings and the performative text may
represent only a "partial truth" (Clifford, 1986) as it is situ-
ated in this context.
The following script, based on the performative text, is
intended to help readers experience CL in a way similar to
what the students and instructor experienced in the class-
room. We invite readers to engage actively with the text in
multiple ways, such as by reading it silently or, preferably, by
reading it aloud. The reader of this article might also enlist
others to play various characters' parts while listening to the
text. It may also help to imagine oneself playing the role of
instructor, or as a director of the scenes presented in the text.
The point is to find ways to engage in the experience repre-
sented by the performative text. Links to the participants'
thematic experiences will be discussed later in this article.
A Performative Text
An introduction of the characters is provided below, fol-
lowed by a script of their performance.
The Characters
Edward:
A Caucasian male in the senior year of a
Language and World Business program. He
studied in Japan as an exchange student dur-
ing his senior year of high school. Edward
enjoys poems and writes them for self-expres-
sion, such as his determination and
independence.
 Grace:
An Asian American female in the junior year
of a StudioArt program. She is also a member
of the honors program. When leaving the
classroom, Grace hopes to communicate bet-
ter with her Japanese grandmother in
Japanese.
 Kita:
A Caucasian female in the senior year of a
Linguistics program. She is the founder and
organizer of the Japanese movie night group.
Kita's effort to develop the language skill--
by speaking with her friends and writing diary
entries in Japanese--is remarkable.

Mike:
A Caucasian male in the senior year of an
Architecture program. He is also an honors
student and is thrilled that his long-time
dream, attending a graduate school in Tokyo,
will finally become a reality in a few months.
Rochelle:
A Caucasian female in the junior year of a
Language and World Business program. She
is a close friend of Kita, and both of them are
active members of the course. Rochelle finds
time in her busy schedule to practice yoga
and watch Asian dramas.
 Walter:
A Caucasian male pursuing a double major in
Theater and History. He attends pilot training
to be certified to fly helicopters and looks for-
ward to teaching English in China upon
graduation.
 Meg: 
The teacher and a native speaker of Japanese.
As a doctoral student specializing in CL, she
began practicing CL in her Japanese language
courses and is learning to become a better
facilitator of CL.
Act
Edward, Kita, Mike, and Walter are gathered in a classroom,
talking about a TV show that was aired the prior evening as
they await the arrival of others. They are here to have a dia-
logue about their experiences with the CL methodology in
their Japanese course. Soon Meg enters the room, briefly
6 SAGE Open
greeting the students while also trying not to interrupt the
ongoing conversation. After catching a breath, she glances at
a watch on her wrist and asks the students to rearrange the
tables and chairs to create a small circle conducive to dia-
logue. As they sit in a circle, Grace and Rochelle enter the
room hastily and join the group. Meg then briefly describes
the purpose of today's meeting and begins the dialogue by
asking the group a question.1
1
MEG: So what are our CL reading sessions like for
you? Is there anything that stands out?
2
3
GRACE:(After a brief silence) One thing that stands
out to me is the learning environment. It's
 4
really comfortable as compared to the other classes
I've taken in college.
5
6
WALTER: I think that's because engaging in CL
helps us learn about each other and build our
7 relationships.
8
9
ROCHELLE: Yeah, and that's not just between us,
students, but also with you (looking at Meg).
10
11
MEG: That's interesting because when I see us
interact (pointing to Grace and herself) and you
12
two interact (pointing to Grace and Mike), I'm con-
stantly reminded of what different types of
13 relationships we have.
14
15
ROCHELLE: I think it's like an authority versus
peer kind of thing. But then, I do think having
16
you sit with us changes the dynamics. Obviously,
you (Meg) are still the teacher, but it does
17
involve you more with us and involve us more with
you.
18
19 MEG: It does, doesn't it?
20
21
GRACE: Yes, it's nice to share knowledge with the
teacher as well as the classmates in a way
22 that we don't usually get to.
23
24 MEG: I'm glad to hear that.
25
26
GRACE: I think our safe feeling also comes from us
knowing or assuming that we are not being
27 graded when we are sitting in the circle.
28
29 WALTER: Say more, Grace?
30
31
GRACE: Yeah, in other Japanese classes I've taken,
the teacher was usually at the front of the
32
room, asking us questions in Japanese, and we had to
answer in Japanese. In this kind of
33
situation, there is stress for us students because it is
as if the teacher is firing questions off, and
34
we feel like we have to get it right. In a sense, it's like
being graded for each response. That's
35 pretty scary (laughter).
36
37
WALTER:(Laughter) I can definitely relate to that.
It feels like we are being acknowledged,
38
instead of graded, in the CL circle. I mean, I feel our
opinions about something matter just as
39 much as our ability to speak or use the language.
40
41
EDWARD: Besides the acknowledgements for our
perspectives and contributions to the group
42
process, I also think we are given more control over
our learning processes.
43
44
MEG: Can you tell us more, Edward? I'm struck by
what you just said.
45
46
EDWARD: Sure, for example, in my history class,
the teacher assigns us groups and the topic of
47
discussion, like the ideology of France, England, and
Germany. Then, we talk about what we
48
would have done as political leaders to prevent
WWII or how we would have settled the treaty at
49
the end of WWI. We are dictated or told what we
have to talk about with whom.
50
51
KITA: Same thing for my English class. The teacher
gives us a worksheet that exclusively uses
52
a set of already made-up questions that we have to
answer. If we don't answer them or get them
53 "right," we lose points.
54
55
EDWARD: But then if you are doing what the
teacher tells you to do or working toward a
56specific answer or conclusion that the teacher decides
is "correct," it feels like you are limiting
57 what you can take from your learning.
58
59
GRACE: Yeah, there definitely is something about
having more leeway in learning . . . I mean
60
in not having to come to a conclusion, or not having
to stress out over certain details of reporting
61
information back to the whole class after a small
group activity.
62
63
EDWARD: To me, it's about emphasizing the
appearance of the individual whereas worksheets
64
or the kind of activities we do in my history class is
more about the appearance of the group.
65
66
MEG: The appearance of the group, or the
individual?

EDWARD: Yeah, for example, in my history class,
we work in a group of five to discuss
69
answers to the questions the teacher prepares ahead
of time. And there are two really vocal
70
people who control the group, dictating the pace and
reading our answers aloud to the class. I can
71
voice my own opinions, but it's not gonna make any
difference because they are not gonna write
72
it down or express it to the class. So whereas what is
presented might only be the spokesperson's
73
or a portion of the group's perspective, it's still pre-
sented as the group's perspective. That's the
74 appearance of the group.
75
76 GRACE:How about our CL sessions?
77
78
EDWARD: I think CL allows everyone's opinion
that wants to be represented to be represented.
79
And I think this makes a big difference in what we
say and how much thinking we put into
80learning.
81
82
ROCHELLE: I think so, too, definitely. When
doing CL, we are asking questions like "What is
83
this piece trying to say and how is it trying to say it?"
"How do we relate to the piece?" and
84
"Where are our thoughts?" These kinds of general
questions generally lead toward more specific,
85
different opinions and conclusions. So CL actually
helps generate more thoughts and different
86
kinds of learning than those straightforward work-
sheet ones.
87
88
MIKE: I agree, Rochelle. I always thought it was
really interesting how we start with a
89
particular topic, say the reading about yakudoshi
[i.e., a critical or unlucky year], and then move
90
to culture as a whole. From one aspect of culture, we
get into things like psychology and gender,
91
so deep of a conversation on more various aspects of
the cursed year. And the same thing for the
92
Yoko Ono reading. We start talking about one wom-
an's life and her experience artistically and
93
personally, and then we move to poetry and exhibi-
tion of personal art as a whole.
94
95
EDWARD: It's really interesting how a group of
people can sit together and go there. It actually
96
reminds me of when I played in band in high school
and middle school. You sit down, and one
97
person would be playing a song, and you'd have
another person join in, and there would be this
98 group. And that's where music gets developed.
99
100
MEG: I like your band metaphor, Edward. I
think it describes a CL experience well, you
know,
101
like us co-authoring our journey of learning.
102
103
ROCHELLE: Yes, CL is not about destination, but
journey. It's the process that's important.
104
105
KITA: And it's all of us, not the teacher alone, who
coordinate the course of our journey, our
106learning.
107
108 WALTER: Tell us more, Kita.
109
110
KITA: For example, instead of using worksheets,
we focus on relating our own experiences to
111
the reading materials. And our conversation devel-
ops naturally based on what matters to us.
112
113
WALTER: Yeah, and what's important to us might
not occur to you (Meg) because you are a
114
native speaker of Japanese. What might seem really
elementary and obvious to you, we might
115
not have any idea about why you would say some-
thing in a certain way.
116
117
GRACE: So all of us get to be teachers as well as
learners, yes? I think this way of teaching and
118
learning allows us to really feel that everybody has
something valuable to contribute to the class.
119
120
ROCHELLE: Yeah, I remember Kita's linguistics
background helped us understand the
121
phonetic reasoning behind yakudoshi in one class
session. Does anyone remember? We were
122talking about yakudoshi, and she was sharing how
the sounds contributed to the number or age
123 being lucky or unlucky.
124
125
MIKE: I remember. In the debriefing of that ses-
sion, I said that I felt different viewpoints and
126
knowledge other members had brought shed new
light on my experiences and perspectives.
127
128
EDWARD: I'd add that it's not just about learning
from other members, but learning with them.
129
Even though I like poetry, if it wasn't for other
members, I wouldn't have gone back to re-read
130
and develop appreciation for it. I think the group
helps not only bring out other ideas that you
131
haven't thought about before but also push you to
think more about what you read.
132
133
MIKE: Right, but at the same time, it feels like I
still haven't gotten used to the level of control
8 SAGE Open
134
we are given in our CL sessions. I do enjoy it, but I
know I'm expecting to hear more from you
135 (Meg).
136
137
KITA: Yeah, I agree with you, Mike. Sometimes
when we have 10 seconds of silence, we all
138
seem to be looking at you (Meg) and wondering
why you aren't telling us the answer, why aren't
139
you telling us what the correct way of thinking
about this is.
140
141
MEG: I'm intrigued by what you just said, Kita. I
just want us to create our own "music" for
142 ourselves. What do you think?
143
144
KITA: I can understand that in my head, but I know
I'm still questioning. It's just nice to get, at
145
least after we bring out our opinions on the table, an
expert or native cultural perspective because
146
that helps a lot in understanding, especially when
we are speculating.
147
148
MEG: Well, you know, I'm still learning just like
you. Like, when we were talking about Yoko
149
Ono, Walter was very knowledgeable about the hip-
pie movement, and that really helped me to
150
make sense of Yoko's life experiences in con-
text. So I don't see myself as an expert on the
topic
151
or think I know everything about it just because I
am a teacher or a native speaker of Japanese.
152 Does that make sense?
153
154
MIKE: Yeah, it does, and maybe it's just some-
thing that's been ingrained in me as I've
155 progressed through the educational systems.
156
157
EDWARD: I think so, too, Mike. I think your
expectations for Meg or the silence Kita
158
mentioned comes from the fact that we are used to
being controlled in classroom settings.
159
Almost everyone in this country probably grew up
with some sort of structured group system.
160
161
MEG: I understand the unfamiliarity, discomfort,
or frustrations you might be experiencing with
162
the process of CL. And in a way, I feel very much
the same. I, too, am more used to working on
163
worksheets or having the teacher lecture me. So
you have seen me unintentionally slipping out of
164
my co-learner role and answering your questions
without having us think together.
165
166
GRACE: I think we will get used to this new way
of teaching and learning as we continue to go
167
on together. It takes time and effort to become com-
fortable with something different from what
168
we are used to or what's been ingrained in us for so
long, you know?
169
170
WALTER: I agree, and I would say, even within an
unfamiliar environment, I have learned a lot
171
from doing CL--about the reading content, lan-
guage concepts, and cultural matters.
172
173
ROCHELLE: Yeah, I really think CL helps more
deeply penetrate the piece and nail some of
174 the Japanese language concepts.
175
176
MEG: Can you (Rochelle) or anyone else remem-
ber the specific moments when you had that
177experience?
178
179
EDWARD: If you noticed, me and Joey were going
back and flipping through, trying to find out
180
about vocabulary or kanji [i.e., Chinese characters]
that we had forgotten. Even though it's not
181
like sitting there writing in a workbook for an hour
over and over, we remember it well from
182 talking about it as a part of a reading.
183
184
GRACE: Well, I tend to think we talk more about
cultural things than just language concepts in
185
our CL sessions. But talking about culture actually
helps develop our general understandings of
186
the language because it gives us the context of lan-
guage development and usage.
187
188
ROCHELLE: Right, it's like, instead of just say-
ing, "`Sumimasen' and `gomen' mean `sorry' in
189
English," you understand the mechanics of the dif-
ferent levels of formality behind these two
190
words, and you can use them appropriately in
communication.
191
192
EDWARD: Yeah, but then we are not just adding
information into a pot. We are also integrating
193
our knowledge and experiences and creating some-
thing that's entirely new and amazing. This is
194
what I was trying to describe earlier with the meta-
phor of my band experience.
195
196
GRACE: But not every CL session felt the same to
me.There seem to be times when I learned,
197
or took from my CL experience, more or less. Can
anyone relate to that?
198
199
ROCHELLE: I do. I think that in some sessions
our conversation is more engaging than in
200 other sessions.
Burress and Peters 9
201
202
KITA: Yeah, there were times when I wished more
of us were into it.
203
204
MEG: Right, you see, that's something I've been
pondering over. But what do you
205 think makes such a difference in our engagement?
206
207
MIKE: Well, for me, if something stopped me
from sharing my perspective or contributing to
208
the group process as much as I wished, it was
because of the narrow-mindedness and
209
disrespectful behaviors of some group members.
Sometimes they were talking over one another,
210
or saying things like, "Oh, that's weird," to some
aspects of Japanese culture where they were
211
only different from what they were accustomed to.
212
213
GRACE: Perhaps we need to be more mindful of
what we say and how we say it.
214
215
MIKE: Yeah, if something like this happens again
in the future, it needs to be addressed, I think.
216
217
MEG: Yes, let's do so. It's important we constantly
remind ourselves of developing and
218
maintaining safe, open space where we are all
respected and respectful.
219
220
EDWARD: Well, my experience is a little bit dif-
ferent from Mike's. I don't really want to talk
221
because I don't want to negatively influence other
members' reading experiences and the group
222process.
223
224 WALTER: Huh, negatively influence? How so?
225
226
EDWARD: Like today, I wanted to participate
more, but I didn't feel like I should because other
227
people had finished the reading and had more
knowledge than I did. I didn't wanna ruin their
228
experience and what they took from the reading.
Besides that, I don't wanna get in a conflict.
229
230
KITA: But everyone knows you have such great
insights, Edward. So if you--and all of us--
231
had talked as much as we could in either English or
Japanese, that probably would have helped
232 us a lot more with our Japanese.
233
234
ROCHELLE: I agree, Kita. At the same time, I
also think that we need to be more
235
understanding and patient because we all have dif-
ferent personalities, values, and experiences.
236
237
GRACE: Yeah, and I guess we are taking the class
for different reasons. So people who are
238
trying to fulfill their foreign language requirements
are more likely to be mildly interested in
239
participating because they just wanna get through
the class. Well, I guess that's my assumption,
240 but . . . .
241
242
MIKE: And there are also people who are moti-
vated but shy. They don't want the spotlight
243 shining on them.
244
245
KITA:(Smiling) That's me. I know I have lots of
stage fright. As much as I would love to, I
246
can't speak Japanese. You (Meg) know the lan-
guage, so you know when I make mistakes.
247
248 WALTER: I wonder what we can do about that.
249
250
KITA: What do you think about using small
groups, instead of one large one? When we are in
251
small groups, maybe we have less pressure about
making mistakes or looking stupid in front of
252
the whole class. And I think being in a small group
can force everyone to engage; they have
253 more pressure to stay focused and contribute.
254
255
ROCHELLE: I think working in small groups has
some advantages, but I really do feel having
256you (Meg) with all of us throughout the process--
like thinking and reflecting together--makes
257
CL different from other methods of teaching and
learning. What do you think, Meg?
258
259
MEG: Yeah, you know, once we break into groups,
I'm afraid I will be positioned outside of the
260
group, and this way, I will be participating mostly
as teacher or facilitator rather than co-learner.
261 And that's not what we want.
262
263
EDWARD: I'm also afraid this change might
emphasize the appearance of the group over the
264individual.
265
266 WALTER: What are your thoughts, Kita?
267
268
KITA: Yeah . . . I see your points. I wonder if there
are any other ways to increase our
269
participation level besides using small groups,
though.
270
271
GRACE: Maybe a writing assignment about a
reading beforehand can help? This may push
272
more people a little more to read, think, and have
something to share with the group in class.
10 SAGE Open
273
274
ROCHELLE: And maybe have us write in
Japanese as much as possible, while also
275
communicating in English as well for the things
that we don't know how to write in Japanese yet.
276
This may allow us to practice using Japanese so this
doesn't have to be accomplished only in
277conversations.
278
279
GRACE: Yeah. I think many of us are not well
versed in Japanese with both language and
280
culture. So if we had some time to do research on
the topic and think about it outside the class, I
281
think this could help increase our participation and
expand our conversations.
282
283
MIKE: Besides the writing assignment, it may also
be important to reexamine our choice of
284reading.
285
286
ROCHELLE: I agree, Mike. I remember when we
first started out. I think our first reading was
287
Doraemon, and that was just telling us about some-
thing that we maybe didn't know about, and
288
that was about Doraemon, his TV show and manga,
and how it started out. And after that, we did
289the Yoko Ono piece. That was really nice because it
brought together a lot of different things, like
290
abstract concepts that are common in poetry and
literature. And how controversial all the things
291
Yoko did were at that time, not to mention the con-
text of that time, which was the Vietnam war
292 and the hippie movement.
293
294
EDWARD: Yeah, I think the reading needs to be
interpretive as well as informative. It was only
295
a few lines, but I really liked the poem in Yoko
Ono's, the Cloud piece. I stopped and read this
296
poem just because it spawned millions of other
ideas. I got a different meaning out of it every
297 time I read it.
298
299
MEG: Right, and I, too, have thought about the
relationship between the reading content and our
300
engagement levels. And I agree that some changes
need to be made about the choice of our
301
readings as they might be more or less suitable for
class dialogue.
302
303
WALTER: It's great to know there are many things
we can do to improve our CL experiences,
304 isn't it?
305
306
MEG: Yes, Walter. And thank you for your positive
outlook. I also would like to thank you all
307
for participating and sharing today. I really enjoyed
hearing, talking about, and learning from our
308
experiences. We addressed many important points,
and these will be helpful in improving the
309
situations in our CL sessions. Our next CL reading
session is scheduled for a week from now. So
310
let's practice again then with some changes and see
what happens!
Discussion
The authors return to the themes and discuss them from the
students' perspective based on their interview data and from
the instructor's perspective based on her field notes and fur-
ther reflections. Examples of themes are found in links to
numbered pages in the performance text.
Learning Environment
Students' perspective. The learning environment stood out as
an aspect of students' experience with CL (e.g., 3-17).
Engaging in CL helped them create a sense of comfort and
safety that in turn enabled them to learn about one another
and build relationships over time. This finding corresponds
to that of Merrill (2003), Gray (2008), and Li (2011), all of
whom reported that the creation of an open, comfortable, and
safe classroom environment and the promotion of positive
relationships among their study participants contributed to
meaning making by students and instructor. In this study, the
comfortable environment, especially the positive reinforce-
ments students received from one another and the instructor
while learning to engage in CL, stood in sharp comparison
with their former T-I and T-II classroom experiences, which
tended to be competitive and focused on getting correct
answers and grades.
Instructor's perspective. Closely related to creation of a com-
fortable learning environment was the instructor's attempt to
reduce the effect of power differences that often exist
between teacher and students in a classroom setting (e.g.,
15-39). The instructor noted that with time, students became
more relaxed about these differences. This finding is consis-
tent with Peters and Armstrong's (1998) concept of CL and
the role that dialogue plays in reducing the effects of hierar-
chical authority associated with T-I and T-II teaching and
learning. This finding is also in line with Burress'(2013) dis-
covery of the critical role that time plays in the formation of
a strong group dynamic in the CL classroom.
Process and Outcomes of Learning
Students' perspective.A few student participants described
their experiences with the CL process (e.g., 88-93) by
employing metaphors, such as likening dialogue to playing
music in a band (e.g., 95-98). On the whole, these metaphors
Burress and Peters 11
represented the students' experience with the contributions
of other group members as well as the emphasis the instruc-
tor placed on the learning process, for example, valuing of
the "yet-to-be-created (knowledge)" (Peters & Gray, 2007),
instead of seeking a specific, previously known answer to a
question. As a result, instructor and students jointly con-
structed their own new knowledge about the reading content,
language concepts, and cultural matters (e.g., 170-190). For
example, as they engaged in dialogue and interwove their
existing knowledge, they learned that phonetic reasoning
behind yakudoshi may account for honyaku (great calamity)
at the ages of 42 for men and 33 for women. These numbers
are phonetically unlucky as 42 can be pronounced shi-ni,
which is homophonous with the words "to die" or "death,"
and 33, when pronounced as sanzan, means "terrible" or
"disastrous." This knowledge was not a simple reproduction
of what participants knew in advance from the text or other
related resources; instead, it was jointly constructed as they
dialogued, taught, and learned with one another in the com-
fortable and safe environment that they had developed
together. Dialoging on these issues further contributed to
improved understanding of the content of the readings as it
reinforced participants' need to review the materials and
consider the issues multiple times, both as individuals and
with the group as a whole (e.g., 129-131). In short, partici-
pants' experience with the CL process and the way they
worked together enabled them to think and learn not only
individually but also as a group.
Teacher's perspective. Working as a collaborative group, the
participants engaged with one another as co-learners and co-
constructors of knowledge by utilizing and interweaving
their experiences, skills, and relationships and by assuming
mutual responsibility for their constructive process (e.g.,
100-128; 192-194). Excerpts from the instructor's reflective
field notes illustrated the differences in this process and her
previous experience with T-I and T-II.
I was sometimes astonished to see and experience how our
engagement in dialogue could lead us to talking about the
readings, language, and culture in a way that I did not expect or
predict. We often created a new path of our teaching and
learning, bringing in our own knowledge and skills and weaving
them together into shared knowledge that was broad and
nuanced. For example, the incorporation of CL helped me gain
greater understanding about the readings, such as Yoko Ono's
poem about counting and naming clouds, in a way that I could
not have achieved alone . . . Each of the students and I brought
in our own knowledge, experience, and talent, as well as our
unique ways of approaching and understanding the poem and
Yoko's life.
These same notes indicated that the instructor's experi-
ence helped her to learn more about the students. She came
to realize that until she engaged in dialogue with her students
that she did not know who they were--what they were
interested in, what they already knew, and how thoughtful
they were. There were times when she felt that she learned
more about the students in one session than during an entire
semester the previous year when she taught the same group
without engaging with them in CL.
Responsibilities for Teaching and Learning
Students' perspective. Although the incorporation of CL pro-
duced positive outcomes, students faced some challenges
associated with CL. They had to learn how to deal with
responsibilities of helping to create and maintain conditions
that support dialogue and co-construction of knowledge in
the classroom, such as by taking an active role in the process
(e.g., 41-80; see McNamee & Gergen, 1999). However,
unlike the shift that occurred for Li's (2011) study partici-
pants in terms of their understanding of students' responsi-
bilities, some students in the current study continued to
expect to be taught, or hear correct answers, or learn "expert
or native cultural perspectives" from the instructor only, and
not from their classmates (e.g., 133-159).
Teacher's perspective. Similarly, the instructor often struggled
to facilitate the group in a way that would engage all partici-
pants, students, and instructor, in dialogue. She had difficulty
letting go of her control as a teacher and occasionally slipped
out of her co-learner role and answered the questions that
other members raised without searching with them for a
newly constructed answer (e.g., 161-164). In addition, there
were times when the teacher and students merely exchanged
their stories and experiences and neglected to work together
to generate new knowledge. This became a challenge for the
instructor--a surprise, given her training in CL--and a new
sense of respect for the complexities of T-III teaching and
learning.
Resistance to Engaging in Dialogue
Students' perspective. As Li (2011) reported, the level of stu-
dents' overall engagement increased with the incorporation
of CL; however, in this study, some students continued to
resist engaging in dialogue in English as well as in Japanese
(e.g., 202-246). According to the students, their resistance
stemmed from various sources, such as a fear of making mis-
takes and appearing stupid, a desire to avoid conflicts, and a
concern with others' perceived disrespectful behaviors. To
increase the level of all students' engagement in the process,
students and the instructor continuously reminded them-
selves of the importance of developing and maintaining a
dialogical space (Isaacs, 1999; Shotter, 2008) where all
members are respected and respectful (e.g., 217-218).
Teacher's perspective.Students' resistance to playing new
roles and increasing their engagement in learning was a con-
cern not only to students but also to the instructor. Even
12 SAGE Open
when she called on students to speak, they often expressed
that they did not have anything to say or did not know what
to say in order to proceed. In response, the instructor engaged
in frequent conversations with the students about how to
encourage and help students to voluntarily and actively par-
ticipate in the process (e.g., 248-301). However, students
were more actively engaged at some times and less active at
other times. This uneven engagement seemed to depend on
the strength of appeal that particular readings had to students.
Readings were more or less relevant to students'experiences,
and some readings naturally elicited multiple interpretations
or perhaps addressed more controversial and thus interesting
issues than did others. Overall, the more relevant, controver-
sial, and varied the readings, the more likely students were to
engage in dialogue (e.g., 283-301).
Conclusion
One of the most widely discussed topics in contemporary
higher education is how to get students more engaged in
teaching and learning activities (Kahu, 2013). This usually
means that instructors prefer students to be active learners,
instead of passive learners. Active learning can be seen in the
use of problem-based learning experiences, various other
forms of experiential learning, and even question and answer
episodes in the classroom. In the present study, it is clear that
students and instructor were actively engaged through their
discussion and dialogue about readings, even though the
extent of their engagement seemed to vary with their interest
in particular readings. Engagement in this case means think-
ing together (Isaacs, 1999), asking and responding to ques-
tions posed by peers and instructor, openly reflecting on the
content of the readings as well as on reading assignments and
engaging in dialogue about the readings. The very act of co-
constructing new knowledge implies engagement, as work-
ing jointly to make meaning is in itself a form of engagement.
This feature of T-III may be an obvious but overlooked area
of student-to-student, student-to-teacher, and student-to-
group engagement in higher education classrooms, as most
literature on the subject has focused on T-I and T-II teaching
and learning environments.
Although students in the present study were ages 19 and
20, some adult education scholars would identify them as
adult learners about which much theorizing has been done
(e.g., Brockett & Hiemstra, 1991; Cross, 1999; Knowles,
1980; Merriam, Caffarella, & Baumgartner, 2007; Mezirow,
1991; Mezirow & Associates, 2000). Knowles' work, in par-
ticular, set the stage for subsequent discourse about the need
for instructors to involve students as active participants in the
teaching and learning process. It is easy to see how Knowles'
principles are applicable to T-II experiences. In fact, the lat-
ter in its lecture­discussion form may be the sine-qua-non of
a Knowles teaching and learning experience. However, the
experience that students get in a T-III teaching and learning
setting takes the notion of active adult learning a step higher,
as students and instructor labor together to construct new
knowledge.
Even though their concept of CL seems bounded by what
students can learn among themselves with input from the
outside by an instructor, Bruffee and others who position the
instructor on the outside nevertheless cite the potential of
student-to-student engagement and active learning as cata-
lysts for critical thinking. Peters and Armstrong's extension
of this idea to include the instructor's direct involvement as
co-learner places the whole of classroom participants in a
position to think critically together about course content and
process, moment-to-moment, during their classroom engage-
ment. This attention to process and content has to do with
metacognition, or thinking about thinking (Flavell, 1979;
Hennessey, 1999; Kaplan, Silver, LaVaque-Manty, &
Meizlish, 2013; Martinez, 2006), as much as it is to do with
what they are thinking about. The students and instructor in
this study were constantly thinking as critically about the
topic of their discourse as they were about how they were
engaging in the discourse. The instructor also reflected criti-
cally on her own facilitating moves and on students'
responses to her moves.
So, how did the instructor and her students experience
the inclusion of CL (T-III) as one type of teaching among
others in the intermediate Japanese language course?
Overall, their CL experience contributed to their individual
and joint understanding of readings related to the Japanese
language. However, CL was in many ways different, unfa-
miliar, and uncomfortable for students and instructor alike.
This experience may have been due to the new way of learn-
ing that the particular process of CL, or T-III, presented for
study participants. Students and instructors in general tend
to take for granted how to act and what to expect of one
another in T-I and T-II settings, and this was the case for
participants in this study, at least in the beginning of their
course. When it comes to T-III, students and instructors may
be faced with learning a whole new way of engaging in
teaching and learning (Peters & Armstrong, 1998; Skinner
& Peters, 2012, 2014). For example, engaging in CL neces-
sitates that students and instructor relate in multiple and
complex ways; for example, as teacher, facilitator, co-learn-
ers, and co-constructors of knowledge. In this study, achiev-
ing a balance in these multiple ways of relating was a
challenge. In spite of the instructor's attempts to demon-
strate the value of all three types of teaching and learning,
some student participants continued to expect to be taught in
a more conventional manner and resisted aspects of T-III,
especially participating in dialogue with the teacher and
their peers. This resistance was exacerbated when the
instructor also struggled to let go of her T-I and T-II pedago-
gies, in spite of having extensive training in CL.
Finally, this research was undertaken in part because no
other studies of CL in the Japanese language classroom exist.
Based on this study, the authors feel comfortable in saying
that CL (T-III) holds promise as a third approach to teaching
Burress and Peters 13
and learning. This adds to the usual emphasis on practical
communication and development of language skills (T-I and
T-II) in a Japanese language course. The study also contrib-
utes to the limited research on Peters and Armstrong's typol-
ogy of teaching and learning by virtue of its unique
application in a Japanese language classroom. By and large,
this study is consistent with other, differently situated studies
of CL, thus adding to the level of support for the typology.
However, because this study reports on only one course in
Japanese on one university campus, the results may or may
not be the same in other Japanese language classrooms or for
other modern foreign languages. The authors suggest that
similar research be undertaken in other modern foreign lan-
guage settings, so that researchers may better understand
what can be achieved by utilizing multiple types of teaching
and learning in this area of undergraduate education.
