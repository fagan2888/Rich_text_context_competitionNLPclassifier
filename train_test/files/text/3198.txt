Abstract:
This paper analyses how many euro coins outflow from Germany and which
composition of coins is to be expected in the long run. To this end, a simple
mathematical model is formulated and calibrated for 1 coins. The introduction of the
euro coins in 2002 presented a unique opportunity to analyse the cross-border migration
and the mixing process of coins in different euro-area countries. Based on research by
Stoyan and depending on growth assumptions, the annual outflow of German 1 coins
is calculated to lie somewhere between 4% and 5%. In the long run, the ratio of German
1 coins in Germany is likely to converge to around 50%.

Non technical summary
Since 1 January 2002, euro banknotes and coins are legal tender in the euro area. For
euro coins ­ in contrast to banknotes ­ it is relatively easy to distinguish the coins
issued by the individual euro area countries, owing to their unique national side. The
introduction of euro coins offered the unique opportunity to analyse the cross ­ border
migration of coins.
The present paper analyses how many euro coins outflow from Germany and which
composition of coins is to be expected in the long run. The flow of coins depends on the
intensity of foreign travel and has consequences for the countries' seigniorage.
The paper exemplifies the mixing process with 1 coins. For those coins, consistent data
from the online survey projects "Eurodiff" and "Euromobil" are available. Accordingly,
since their introduction until the end of 2008, the share of German 1 coins in Germany
dropped to about 75%. We explain the flow of coins between Germany and the other
euro area countries by a simple dynamic model. The parameters of that model, outflow
rates and inflow rates, are calibrated based on actual empirical data. The results depend
on whether the total stock of coins is constant or growing over time. Assuming that the
total stock of 1 coins is constant, the model predicts that the ratio of German coins in
Germany to the coins issued by Germany would drop to merely 22% in the long run.
Empirically, however, since their introduction, the stock of euro coins was growing
every year, which slowed down the process of coin mixing. Extrapolating the growth
rates observed in the past, the model predicts a decline of the share of German coins in
Germany to 53%. Using an alternative model based on a Markov approach to explain
the coin mixing yields the same results.
Nicht technische Zusammenfassung
Seit dem 1. Januar 2002 sind Euro­Banknoten und ­Münzen gesetzliche Zahlungsmittel
im Euro­Währungsraum. Bei den Euro­Münzen lässt sich ­ im Unterschied zu den
Banknoten ­ das Herkunftsland aufgrund ihrer nationalen Seite leicht erkennen. Die
Einführung der Euro­Münzen bot die einmalige Gelegenheit, die grenzüberschreitende
Münzmigration zu untersuchen.
Das vorliegende Papier beschäftigt sich mit der Frage, wie viele Euro­Münzen aus
Deutschland abfließen und welche Zusammensetzung der Bestände auf längere Sicht zu
erwarten ist. Dies hängt von der Intensität des grenzüberschreitenden Reiseverkehrs ab
und hat Auswirkungen auf den Münzgewinn (Seigniorage) der einzelnen Länder.
Die Arbeit veranschaulicht den Durchmischungsprozess beispielhaft anhand der Ein­
Euro­Münzen. Hierfür sind konsistente Daten aus den Online­Umfrageprojekten
,,Eurodiff" und ,,Euromobil" verfügbar. Danach fiel der Anteil deutscher Ein­Euro­
Münzen in Deutschland seit der Euro­Einführung bis Ende 2008 auf rund 75%. Der
Münzfluss zwischen Deutschland und der übrigen Euro­Ländern (Ausland) wird durch
ein einfaches dynamisches Modell erklärt. Die Parameter des Modells, Abfluss- und
Zuflussraten, werden anhand von empirischen Daten kalibriert. Die Ergebnisse hängen
davon ab, ob der gesamte Münzbestand im Zeitablauf konstant ist oder wächst. Wird
angenommen, dass der gesamte Bestand an Ein­Euro­Münzen im In­ und Ausland
konstant ist, prognostiziert das Modell langfristig einen Rückgang des Anteils deutscher
Münzen in Deutschland an den von Deutschland emittierten Münzen auf nur 22%.
Empirisch war in den Jahren seit der Euro­Einführung allerdings ein Wachstum der
Münzbestände zu beobachten, wodurch sich der Durchmischungsprozess verlangsamte.
Werden die in den vergangenen Jahren beobachteten Wachstumsraten des Münzumlaufs
extrapoliert, ergibt sich langfristig ein Rückgang des Anteils deutscher Münzen in
Deutschland auf 53%. Dieselben Ergebnisse werden mit einem alternativen Modell
erzielt, das den Durchmischungsprozess mit einem Markov­Ansatz beschreibt.

Coin migration within the Euro area*
1 Introduction
Since 1 January 2002, euro banknotes and coins have been legal tender in the euro
area, which, since January 2009, comprises 16 member states. While, to the untrained
eye, it is difficult to distinguish between the banknotes issued by the individual euro-
area countries, distinguishing between the various euro-area coins is relatively simple
owing to their unique national side. As people can clearly see in their everyday cash
transactions, the national euro coins have become mixed over time. Nevertheless, it is
difficult to find any reliable data on the intensity of the cross-border flow of coins. The
introduction of euro coins did, however, present the unique opportunity to analyse the
cross-border migration of euro coins and the mixing of coins in the various euro-area
countries.
There are a number of projects being carried out at universities relating to this
coin diffusion process. For example, the French project is based on representative
surveys (Grasland et al., 2002), whereas the other projects are based largely on
voluntary reporting. Examples of the latter are the "Euromobil" and "Eurodiff" projects
in Germany, which focus exclusively on 1 coins (Stoyan, 2002; Stoyan et al., 2004),
"Eurotracer", which also includes the migration of banknotes, and "Eurodiffusie" in the
Netherlands and Belgium (Blokland et al., 2002).1 Bergman et al. (2002) use an
algorithm and data on travel statistics to try to determine when 50% of the coins
circulating in a country are of foreign origin. Furthermore, since 2002, the European
Commission has been taking random samples of coins from major towns and cities at
irregular intervals to gather data on the coin mixing process. All of these studies are
focused on establishing either the (net) number of foreign euro coins flowing into a

country during a given time period or the stock of foreign euro coins at a given point in
time.
Coins are a direct source of seigniorage as the difference between the nominal
value of coins and their production costs is the profit of the finance ministry.2 This
process constitutes a kind of monetisation of government debt. This is also true in the
euro area where the different member countries have the right to determine the amounts
of coins to be issued. In Germany, this has to be done in coordination with the Deutsche
Bundesbank. Furthermore, the amounts have to be approved by the European Central
Bank for one year in advance. Except this approval, there is no upper limit to the
issuance process. However, according to the EU Treaty, the maximum amount of coins
in the stocks of the national central banks to be credited to the government must not
exceed 10% of the total issue of the respective country. Therefore, if the cross-border
coin flows are not symmetric or national coin demands differ, this may have
consequences for the seigniorage revenues of the different countries.
In the following, we will focus on the "indirect" calculation of the flow variable
which is behind the mixing process. For that purpose, we will apply a simple theoretical
model to determine how many euro coins flow into other euro-area countries. Following
on from this, we are going to calculate the number of coins to be expected in the long
term. We will confine our calculation to Germany and 1 coins.3 For this case,
consistent data from the "Euromobil" and "Eurodiff" projects are available. Section 2
below explains the formal models and results and also puts forward an alternative
approach. We will then discuss the results in section 3. Section 4 summarises and draws
some conclusions.
2 For different seigniorage concepts see Baltensperger and Jordan (1997).
3 In the case of the smaller-denomination euro cent coins, the results would certainly be distorted owing
to a considerable amount of lost coins, whereas in the case of 2 coins, special-issue coins would have
to be considered as well. In the US, it was even observed up until recently that the demand for coins
went up perceptibly in the wake of surging commodity prices, creating an incentive to melt coins
(Velde, 2007). Melting has since been prohibited by the US Treasury and does not seem to be an issue
for euro coins owing to their different metallic composition.

In the following, ( )

DD
denotes the number of German 1 coins in Germany and

DA
the number of German 1 coins abroad, both at time t. In this section, we
assume that the total number of German 1 coins D
N and the total number of foreign
1 coins A
N remain constant. Thus, the inflow of coins to Germany and the outflow of
coins from Germany cancel each other out. As Deutsche Bundesbank (2003, 208f.)
notes, there is little to suggest that, despite a traditional foreign travel account deficit,
Germany will encounter a net outflow of euro coins. Provided we are concerned with
coins for transaction purposes, it can be assumed that tourists take a similar amount of
coins with them when travelling both from and to their home country.
At time t, the German coins are either still in Germany (NDD
(t)) or have migrated
abroad (NDA
(t)):
(1) ( ) ( )
DD DA D
N t N t N
+ = .
As a result of foreign travel (tourism, business trips) a certain amount of German
1 coins drifts to other countries. We assume that this amount is proportional to the
volume at the start of the period: NDD
(t-1). Conversely, coins also flow from other
euro-area countries to Germany. This includes German coins which already drifted
abroad in previous periods. Here, too, we assume that this amount is proportional to the
number of coins abroad at the beginning of the period: ßNDA
(t-1). This results in the
following dynamic equation for the number of German 1 coins in Germany:
(2) ( ) ( 1) ( 1) ( 1)

Since we are primarily concerned with the share of German coins in Germany

using (1) and (3), equation (2) is reformulated as follows:

At the time of the first issue, all German coins were located in Germany.
Therefore, the starting value is (0) 1

Germany converges towards

If no outflow occurs ( = 0), the share of German coins in Germany remains at

n = . Conversely, if no backflow occurs (ß = 0), all German 1 coins will, in the
long run, migrate abroad *

evolution of coin shares over time :

(6) shows a dynamic adjustment process whereby the share of German coins in
Germany decreases monotonically and converges towards the equilibrium value *

The larger the outflow rate () and the backflow rate (ß), the quicker the coins are
mixed.
An equivalent equation can also be derived for the share of foreign 1 coins
abroad (nAA):

In order to determine the flow rates  and , we take the number of 1 coins in
circulation in the euro area at the end of 2008 (t = 7) of around 6,000 million (see table
1). Of this amount, 1,340 million were German 1 coins and 4,660 million were foreign
1 coins.4 Statistical research carried out by Stoyan suggests that, at the end of 2008,
75% of all German 1 coins were located in Germany (nDD = 75%), which is equivalent
to 1,005 million coins, as around 25% of all the 1 coins observed in Germany at that
time were of foreign origin.5 This would mean that a total of 335 million coins have
already migrated abroad. This is equivalent to around 48 million coins per year, or
4 In statistical terms, this corresponds to approximately 16 1 coins per capita of the German population
and approximately 20 1 coins per capita in the rest of the euro area.

131,000 coins per day. As the same amount of foreign 1 coins have also flowed to
Germany, this implies that the share of foreign coins still abroad is nAA = 92.8%.

These data can be used to empirically calibrate the flow rates  and  by solving
equations (6) and (7) for  and  at t = 7. This yields ^
^ 0.041925, 0.012056
 
= = .
According to these estimates, per year 4.2% of German 1 coins flow to other countries,
and 1.2% of foreign 1 coins flow to Germany. These estimates reflect the unequal
number of issued coins in Germany compared to other EMU countries. Thus, the share
of German coins in Germany, which currently stands at 75%, would fall to
* 22.3%
DD
n = in the long run, whereas the share of foreign coins abroad would decline
from 92.8% at present to * 77.7%
AA
n = . This means that a perfect mixture of coins
would have been achieved as these shares correspond to the percentages of issued 1
coins. The key factors in this result are the unequal amounts of German and foreign 1
coins issued and the assumption that the total number of coins (ND
, NA
) does not grow.
2.2 Growing volumes of coins
One of the fundamental assumptions in the above model, the constancy of the
total number of coins A
N and D
N , is too restrictive and needs to be modified. Indeed,
the number of coins in circulation has increased since the euro was introduced, with the
number of German coins issued between 2002 and 2008 growing by almost 4%
annually and the number of foreign 1 coins issued by as much as 10% per year.6 The

Malta and Cyprus.

increase in the number of coins in circulation affects the coin mixing process: the more
coins are newly circulated each year, the more slowly the coins become mixed. In order
to take account of the effect of the increase in the volume of coins on the coin mixing
process, we modify equation (2) as follows:
(8) ( ) ( 1) ( 1) ( 1) ( 1)
DD DD DD DA D D
N t N t N t N t g N t
 
= - - - + - + - .
For the sake of simplification, we assume that the annual growth rate (gD) of German 1
coins remains constant. The last term in (8) is the quantitative increase of German 1
coins. Dividing (8) on both sides by ND
(t-1), and using the definition
( ) ( ) / ( )
DD DD D
n t N t N t
 for the ratio of German coins in Germany to the total number of
coins issued by Germany, yields

Neglecting growth (gD

German coins in Germany converges towards:

For the share of German coins abroad, this gives us:

.
These two shares depend on the flow rates  and  and on the growth rate gD.
The
smaller the flow rate () and the greater the backflow rate (ß) as well as the growth rate
of German coins (gD
)
,
the greater is the share of German coins that will remain in
Germany in the long run (and therefore the smaller the share of German coins abroad).
This yields the following dynamic equation for the share of German coins in Germany:

Once more, we revert to the "observed" coin volumes at the end of 2008 given in
Table 1, now reflecting both, the original issue and the subsequent growth of coins. We
use the average growth rates gD = 4% and gA = 10% and for t = 7 (end of 2008) we
again set nDD = 75% and nAA = 92.8%. The flow rates  and  can be empirically
calibrated from equations (11) and (12). This yields ^
^ 0.050386, 0.017590
 
= = . Not
surprisingly, the estimated flow rates with growth (5.0% and 1.8%) are larger than those
obtained assuming constant volumes: When more coins are issued, the chance of a
specific coin to flow abroad falls, requiring higher flow rates to obtain the mixing given
in Table 1.
If the above growth rates in the number of coins in circulation also hold in the
future, the share of German coins in Germany would only fall to * 53.3%
DD
n = in the
long run (and not to 22.3% as in the case with constant volumes). Alternatively,
assuming at t = 7 nDD = 70% (80%), we obtain * 49.4% (58.1%)
=
DD
n . The share of
foreign coins abroad would decline merely to * 89.5%
AA
n = . According to this
estimation, in the long run, about one in two 1 coins issued in Germany is likely to stay
in Germany. Figure 1 shows the forecasted share of German 1 coins in Germany for
both cases, i.e. without growth and assuming a growth rate of 4% which was recorded
since the introduction of euro coins in 2002.

So far, we focused on the ratio of German 1 coins in Germany to the total number of
1 coins issued by Germany (nDD

issued abroad *

German coins in Germany to the number of coins circulating in Germany?

converges to a constant in the long run only for gA

. If gA
> gD
(gA
< gD
), the ratio
tends to infinity (zero). This has important consequences for the ratio of German 1
coins in Germany to the total number of coins circulating in Germany:

Thus, if gA

dominate.7 Figure 2 shows the development of German coins in Germany, both, as a
ratio of coins issued by Germany (nDD
(t)) and as a ratio of coins circulating in Germany
(hDD
(t)), calculated for the growth rates gD = 4% and gA = 10%. With the ratio of
German coins circulating in Germany converging towards zero (and the ratio of foreign
coins circulating abroad converging towards one), this graph suggests that substantially
different growth rates of euro coins are likely to be unsustainable in the long run.

2.3 A Markov chain approach
Alternatively, using a Markov chain, the coin mixing process can be examined
within one closed approach. To this end, we define the matrix of the number of coins as
( ) ( )
( )
( ) ( )
DD DA
AD AA
N t N t
M t
N t N t
 
=  
 
and assume the following matrix of transition probabilities
(1 )

Z
ß ß
 
-

,
where  denotes the probability that a 1 coin located in Germany will drift abroad over
a given period (and 1- the probability that the coin will remain in Germany).
Furthermore, ß denotes the probability that a coin located abroad will migrate to
Germany. The exogenous growth in the number of coins is given by
( ) ( 1) ( 1)

Thus, the dynamic process of coin circulation reads as

If, at t = 7 (end of 2008), we take the distribution of coins specified in table 1

and the average growth rates gD = 4% and gA = 10% observed in the past, we can use
equation (15) to empirically calibrate the transition probabilities. This results in
^
^ 0.050386, 0.017590
 
= = . Thus, the probability that a 1 coin located in Germany
will flow abroad in the course of one year is 5%, and the probability that a coin located
abroad will flow to Germany 1.8%. These values exactly match the flow rates that were
calculated in section 2.2.

3 Discussion of the results: plausibility and robustness checks
According to information from Fraport AG, 7.2 million passengers from other
euro-area countries landed at Frankfurt International Airport in 2007. This amounts
statistically to around 20,000 passengers per day. Frankfurt is the biggest German
airport which handles around one-third of all air passengers in Germany. Moreover,
other means of transport are also used. And commuters travelling to and from Germany
on a daily basis also have to be taken into account. In 2006, a (net) daily average of
90,000 persons commuted to Germany. The majority of these are likely to have
originated from other euro-area countries, primarily Austria and the Netherlands
(Stoyan et al., 2004, 74). Therefore, our results regarding the flow rates - about 130,000
per day - do not seem to be unrealistic.
Based on a small, yet non-representative, sample of 2,000 coins taken in Frankfurt
am Main, the European Commission calculated that, for the year 2007, approximately
13% of the 1 coins in circulation in Germany were of foreign origin. This was a
significant decline compared with the samples taken in previous years, when, in some
cases, the share of foreign 1 coins in circulation in Germany was over 50%. Therefore,
this figure is likely to have a severe downward bias. Furthermore, the results of this kind
of random sampling vary substantially depending on the time of year and the place
where the samples were taken. If we were to set =
DD
n 50% at the end of 2008, a zero-
growth scenario would yield ^
^ 0.10648, 0.03062
 
= = . Positive growth rates
(gD=0.04, gA=0.10) result in ^
^ 0.13690, 0.04653
 
= = . In the former scenario, the
long-term coin volumes would converge to 22.3%, yet would settle at 38.7% in the
latter scenario.
If we assume that growth in the number of coins in Germany and abroad is 5%
(gD=gA=0.05), the number of German coins that would migrate from Germany each year
would be 5.20%, and 1.49% of German coins located abroad would return to Germany.
The implied long-term equilibrium values of the coin shares would then be *
DD
n =
55.5% and *
AA
n = 87.2%. Again, the German share would not fall below 50%.
Equations (6) and (11) can also be used to estimate how the mixing process will

n = , i.e. the share
of German coins at the end of 2015 would be approximately 58%. The share of foreign
1 coins in Germany is expected to reach the 50% threshold around 2020. This contrasts
significantly with figures calculated by Bergman et al., who ­ based on 2002 knowledge
­ do not expect a 50% mixing of coins until the year 2040. These different results are
especially due to the assumption as to how high the volumes of German coins in
Germany are at the starting point.
Our analysis is flexible enough to be adapted when new countries join the euro
area. We would only need to adjust the flow rates  and , with the other calculations
left unchanged.
4 Summary and conclusions
By means of a simple model, we have tried to capture the mixing process of euro
coins and to determine the share of German euro coins in Germany. The model was
calibrated using data on 1 coins in Germany. This approach allows the above values to
be determined indirectly. According to our calculations, a total of between 4% and 5%
of German coins are likely to flow abroad each year. We believe that the most plausible
value for the long-term share of German 1 coins in Germany is likely to be around
50%. The present analysis can be easily extended to other euro-area countries, provided
that the required data (on, for instance, the number of foreign coins at a given point in
time) are available.
The derived results are conditional on two assumptions: the growth rates of the
number of German and foreign coins and the number of German coins in Germany at a
given point in time. In this context, the plausibility of the various growth scenarios
would need to be examined. Although, at a first glance, the positive growth scenario
appears to be more plausible, it does, however, present the problem that people would
have to walk around with increasingly large amounts of coins in their pockets.8 This
would probably lead to a decline in demand or to a replacement of the smaller-
denomination coins by issuing a greater amount of larger-denomination coins or even a

changeover to banknotes. Thus, from an economic standpoint, the assumption that, in
the very long term, national coin volumes will remain constant with an unchanged
denomination structure is not implausible. Nevertheless, this may take a very long time
to unfold, which means that, during a transitional period, it would make sense to work
with positive growth rates. In any case, the effects of an increase in foreign travel would
also have to be taken into account. This would entail an increase in the cross-border
flow of coins. Over the 2002-2008 period, travel by Germans to other euro-area
countries went up by an annual average of 4%-5%.
Another interesting route would be to abandon some of our simplifying
assumptions and to review the sensitivity of the results accordingly. There are, for
example, repercussions on the mints and on seigniorage in those countries which record
a net outflow of coins.9 These countries would benefit, as they would issue more coins
than are actually required in their country. In the first few years following the
introduction of euro coins, the mixing process is also likely to have been influenced by
collectors of euro coins in the individual euro-area countries. This influence is likely to
diminish over time. Nevertheless, this process will be relaunched from time to time
whenever new members join the euro area. The cross-border flow of coins and
collection activities could lead to growing uncertainty when forecasting coin demand
(Croushore and Stark, 2002). These issues should be the subject of future research.
9 Historically, this kind of situation occurred time and time again and, in some cases, led to a coin
shortage. A common response to this in the past was to impose a ban on coin exports. A theoretical
analysis of this relationship can be found in Wallace and Zhou (1997).
