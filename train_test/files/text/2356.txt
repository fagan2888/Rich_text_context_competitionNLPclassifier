Multiple binary outcomes are encountered frequently in epidemiologic research. This work was motivated by
the Maternal Lifestyle Study, 1993­1995, where newborns exposed prenatally to cocaine and a comparison
cohort were examined for the presence of central and autonomic nervous system (CNS/ANS) signs. Thus, each
infant contributed to multiple, possibly interrelated, binary outcomes that may collectively constitute one
syndrome (even though specific outcomes that are affected by cocaine are of scientific interest). Because it is
neither scientifically appropriate nor statistically efficient to fit separate models for each outcome, here we adopt
a multivariate repeated measures approach to simultaneously model all the CNS/ANS outcomes as a function of
cocaine exposure and other covariates. This formulation has a number of advantages. First, it implicitly
recognizes that all the CNS/ANS outcomes may together constitute one syndrome. Second, simultaneous
modeling boosts statistical efficiency by allowing for correlations among the outcomes, and it avoids multiple
comparisons. Third, it allows for outcome-specific exposure effects, so that the specific signs that are affected by
cocaine exposure can be identified.

Binary outcome measures that indicate the presence or
absence of certain medical conditions are a widely used tool
in epidemiologic investigations. Moreover, public health
studies frequently measure an array of such indicators for
different medical conditions to make an overall assessment
about an individual's health status. For instance, overall
health status in newborns is widely assessed through the
Apgar score, which is a scale that is derived by eliciting
answers to a series of categorical questions regarding five
outcomes (color, reflex irritability, muscle tone, respiratory
effort, and heart rate). Each of these scales generates a score
of 0­2, which may be dichotomized according to a hypothe-
sized threshold for poor outcomes.
The traditional approach for statistical analyses of such
binary outcomes is logistic regression, where the probability
of observing an "event" (i.e., the prevalence of some medical
condition) is modeled as a function of the principal risk
factor/treatment of interest and other covariates (1).
However, the situation where multiple binary outcomes are
simultaneously assessed on the same individual presents
some basic methodological problems in that proper statis-
tical modeling here should account for the following features
of the data.
A. Each individual contributes to multiple outcomes.
Thus, the different outcomes for each individual are
likely to be correlated.
B. These multiple outcomes broadly purport to measure
the same underlying condition or construct.
C. While the multiple outcomes may be measuring the
same underlying phenomenon, outcome-specific
effects (i.e., which specific outcomes are associated
with the effect of interest) may still be of scientific
interest in many situations.

Many researchers have attempted to address issues A and
B by constructing scores that add up the various outcome
indicators (which can sometimes also be interpreted as the
total number of adverse medical conditions) and then
regressing the total score on covariates using linear or
Poisson regression (2). Others have used latent variable
models to infer about the underlying, yet unobserved,
process that these multiple outcomes purport to measure (3).
However, the principal limitation in both these approaches is
that, by focusing on the aggregate, they lose the ability to
discern outcome-specific effects (i.e., which specific
outcomes are associated with the effect of interest) that may
be of substantive interest, thus failing to address issue C.
This is critical, since aggregation of multiple outcomes risks
combining indicators of distinct processes, which could
mask subtle relations between specific outcomes and risk
factors. Moreover, latent variable models generally entail
strong (often untestable) modeling assumptions that may
significantly impact analytical findings in ways that may not
be obviously discernible.
Individual analyses of each outcome, with separate
logistic regression models being fitted for each indicator,
would satisfy issue C but at the expense of issues A and B.
Specifically, outcomes assessed on the same individual are
likely to exhibit intracluster correlation, since they are
subject to shared influences that are particular to that indi-
vidual (or cluster). If data on these underlying shared influ-
ences (detailed individual-level information such as genetic
makeup, environmental exposures, and so on) are available,
identifying and including these factors as covariates in the
regression model may account for this clustering to some
extent. However, in practice, it is highly unlikely that all
such factors can be identified and measured to the extent that
intracluster correlation gets reduced to a negligible level.
Ignoring correlations among the multiple outcomes essen-
tially wastes valuable information by not exploiting this
distinctive covariance structure in the data, whereby the
overall variability in the outcomes can be broken down into
that between individuals and that within individuals. This
approach will generally produce inefficient estimates, and
the loss in precision resulting from not utilizing information
across the multiple outcomes may be substantial (4).
A related problem with individual analyses for each
outcome is that of multiple comparisons. Specifically, fitting
separate logistic regression models for each individual
outcome would leave the analysis vulnerable to a multiple
comparisons problem, whereby performing several tests on
the same kinds of variables in the same data inflates the type
I error to magnitudes that are unacceptably higher than the
nominal significance level.
In this paper, we adopt a multivariate modeling approach
to analyze multiple binary outcomes in a statistical frame-
work that addresses all three issues (A, B, and C) presented
earlier. Note that a solution already exists for paired binary
data through the use of bivariate logistic regression models
(5). However, that methodology is limited to two binary
outcomes assessed for each individual. Our approach builds
upon this work and extends to the multiple (i.e., >2)
outcomes setting, where we borrow from statistical methods
for longitudinal and repeated measures data to simulta-
neously model all the outcomes assessed on an individual.
Thus, we assume that each individual contributes a vector of
correlated binary outcomes, all of which may be jointly
influenced by his/her treatment/risk factor status and other
personal traits.
There are several advantages to such a repeated measures
approach. First, it explicitly recognizes that all the outcomes
for an individual may be correlated. Second, the fact that a
single model captures all the outcomes underlines that they
may collectively constitute one overarching condition or
construct. Third, by simultaneously modeling all the
outcomes, this approach avoids the multiple comparisons
problem. Fourth, in spite of the simultaneous modeling
formulation, by appropriately nesting the effect of interest
(treatment or principal risk factor) within the multiple
outcomes, we can test for the outcome-specific effects in
which we are interested. At the same time, by constructing
proper linear contrasts, we can test whether such separate
effects for each outcome are, in fact, supported by the data.
If not, we may choose to examine a simpler global effect.
Finally, this technique is statistically more efficient (in terms
of conserving degrees of freedom and enhancing the power
to observe significant effects) than fitting separate models
for each outcome.
This paper is organized as follows. The next section
provides a brief background on the public health study that
motivated this research. Details on the statistical methods
used to put our multivariate modeling approach into opera-
tion are presented next, followed by the results of applying
these methods to actual data from our motivational study.
Finally, we conclude with some general observations on the
substantive and methodological implications of this exercise.
BACKGROUND: THE MATERNAL LIFESTYLE STUDY
This paper is motivated by data from the Maternal Life-
style Study, which is a multisite prospective cohort study
that aims to evaluate the relation between maternal cocaine
and/or opiate use during pregnancy and the presence of acute
neonatal complications and long-term adverse neurodevel-
opmental outcomes in infants (6). The Maternal Lifestyle
Study is the largest prospective study of its kind to date, with
11,811 mother-infant dyads enrolled at baseline. Maternal
cocaine and/or opiate use during the index pregnancy was
determined for all the enrolled subjects using a combination
of self-report and subsequent laboratory verification (infant
meconium toxicology). The 8,351 subjects, for whom
cocaine/opiate exposure status could be conclusively
confirmed, are the focus of this paper.
Newborns in the Maternal Lifestyle Study were examined
within the first few days after birth for the presence of a
constellation of abnormal neurobehavioral manifestations,
known collectively as central and autonomic nervous system
(CNS/ANS) signs, to determine whether the prevalence of
such signs was disproportionately higher in children exposed
prenatally to cocaine (7). The recording of these signs was
considered clinically meaningful because they comprise the
manifestations reported with neonatal "abstinence
syndrome" or neonatal narcotic withdrawal syndrome (8, 9),
and previous studies have reported that cocaine-exposed
Repeated Measures for Modeling Multiple Outcomes 893
Am J Epidemiol 2004;159:891­899
infants exhibited more stress behavior and central nervous
system signs, as well as increased tone, motor activity, jerky
movements, and tremors, than did nonexposed controls (10,
11).
The significant feature of CNS/ANS signs that is impor-
tant for this study is that, essentially, they are a collection of
several presence/absence type (i.e., binary) outcomes that
are assessed on the same individual simultaneously. More-
over, even though there is speculation in the medical litera-
ture that these signs collectively constitute one syndrome
(12), researchers are at the same time interested in knowing
specifically which CNS/ANS signs are associated with
prenatal cocaine exposure, and whether cocaine and opiates
differentially affect different sets of signs. This necessitates
the examination of outcome-specific effects in our study
while bearing in mind that the various signs from each infant
are highly interrelated.
Table 1 presents an association matrix for the different
CNS/ANS signs, where the pairwise associations between
these binary outcomes are measured in terms of odds ratios
that characterize their interrelatedness. The high degree of
association between these signs demonstrated here (for
instance, an infant with jitteriness/tremors was 16.6 times
more likely to manifest with hypertonia, 11.3 times more
likely to be difficult to console, 9.3 times more likely to be
irritable, and so on) seems to support the contention that
these signs may collectively constitute one syndrome. The
table also shows that data analyses for this study may be
further complicated by the low prevalence rates for most of
these signs. (Note that, of the 12 CNS/ANS signs originally
measured in the study, three (difficult to arouse, hyperalert,
and hyperactive) had to be dropped because of extremely
low prevalence, which made meaningful statistical analyses
impossible.)
In summary, table 1 demonstrates that the odds ratios,
which capture the statistical dependence between signs from
the same child, are in general both substantial in magnitude
and highly significant. Ignoring this clearly apparent disper-
sion structure in the data would lead to inefficient estimates
and inaccurate inferences. These factors underscore the
necessity of adopting the multivariate modeling/repeated
measures approach outlined in the previous section for the
analysis of these data.
METHODS
There are several different approaches available for imple-
menting a multivariate repeated measures approach that
models clustered binary data, that is, methods that simulta-
neously model all the binary outcomes elicited from an indi-
vidual (13). Most of these approaches can be grouped into
two classes: population-averaged marginal modeling using
generalized estimating equations (GEEs) (5, 14, 15) and
cluster-specific hierarchical modeling using generalized
linear mixed models (GLMMs) (16, 17). In the following
subsections, we discuss the application of these two methods
in the context of our study and then seek to justify the
approach that we finally adopted.
Population-averaged approach
Here we would model average CNS/ANS prevalence over
cocaine-exposed and -unexposed children who share
common explanatory features, while accounting for correla-
tion among multiple CNS/ANS outcomes from the same
child. Note that, if there is heterogeneity in these prevalence
rates across the different signs, the overall cocaine effect
would be the average of individual cocaine effects for each
sign.
The population-averaged marginal GEE model may be
expressed as follows. If Yij

,
and
log[OR(Yij
, Yik
)] = , j  k. (1)
Here, the s are sign-specific log odds, the s are log odds
ratios, and "coc" and "opi" are indicator variables for
prenatal cocaine and opiate exposures, respectively, while x
denotes other subject-level covariates and  is the log odds
ratio characterizing within-subject dependence between
signs from the same child. Note that, in this formulation, we
can easily construct a test for the null hypothesis H0
: 1j
= 1
(H0
: 2j
= 2), j = 1, ..., m, that examines whether it is indeed
reasonable to assume separate cocaine (opiate) effects for
each sign. Failure to reject this test would indicate that the
cocaine (opiate) effect is the same for all the CNS/ANS
signs, and a simpler model reflecting the same may better
describe the data at hand.
Interpretation of regression coefficients from this model is
straightforward. Thus, 1j
(2j
) is the average log odds ratio
for the jth CNS/ANS sign in children exposed to cocaine
(opiates) relative to children who were not exposed to
cocaine (opiates). Further, since preliminary exploratory
analyses indicated a wide range of prevalence rates for the
different CNS/ANS signs, we incorporated sign-specific
intercepts in the regression model displayed in equation 1 to
account for this feature in the data.
There are several advantages to adopting the above GEE
modeling approach for our data. First, the population-aver-
aged marginal modeling formulation in equation 1 provides
population average estimates of overall trends that are
important from a public health perspective. Second,
compared with cluster-specific approaches that generally
involve multidimensional integration (numerical or other-
wise) of random effects, the GEE estimation algorithm is
computationally efficient for relatively large data sets such
as ours (where n = 8,351 and m = 9). It is also widely imple-
mented in standard-use statistical packages for correlated
data analysis, such as SAS (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, North
Carolina), SPSS (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, Illinois), STATA
(Stata Corporation, College Station, Texas), and SUDAAN
(Research Triangle Institute, Research Triangle Park, North
Carolina) software (18, 19). Third, note that the model
depicted in equation 1 uses odds ratios rather than correla-
tion coefficients to model dependence between signs from
the same child. This is preferable, since odds ratios provide a
more natural framework for modeling the within-subject
dependencies that are induced by the binary responses we
have in this study (20).
Cluster-specific approach
Here, we adjust for multiple outcomes by allowing for
child-specific regression coefficients, that is, coefficients
that vary from one child to another. This technique acknowl-
edges the distinctive characteristics of each child that could
make his/her responses differ. The cluster-specific approach
thus uses a flexible modeling formulation that allows each
child to have his/her own unique CNS/ANS profile, which
may depend on the child's cocaine exposure status (and
other covariates).
A cluster-specific GLMM consists of a two-step hierar-
chical regression framework, where the first step models the
prevalence of CNS/ANS signs for a child as a function of
his/her cocaine and opiate exposure, as well as an overall
child-specific effect 
i
. In the next step, this unobserved
child-specific effect is related to observed child-level covari-
ates through a linear regression equation. Given the notation
developed earlier, this model can thus be written as follows:
Step I: (Yij

i
)  Bernoulli(pij
),
where
logit(pij
) = 
i
+ 
j
+ 1j
coci
+ 2j
opii
.
Step II: 
i
= xi
 + ei
,
where
ei
 N(0,2). (2)
Here, the 
i
denote cluster (i.e., child)-specific effects that
are unique for the ith child. The variance for the residual
error terms ei
(i.e., 2) reflects natural heterogeneity among
children in terms of unmeasured characteristics such as indi-
vidual temperament, genetic makeup, environmental expo-
sure, and so on. Note that, similar to the GEE model, this
formulation also allows us to easily test whether separate
exposure effects are merited for each CNS/ANS sign or
whether a global effect may suffice.
Compared with the population-averaged model, there are
some subtle differences in interpretation for the regression
coefficients in equation 2. Here, 1j
(2j
) may be interpreted
as the log odds ratio for the jth CNS/ANS sign when a child
is exposed to cocaine (opiates), relative to when that same
child is not exposed to cocaine (opiates).
The principal motivation in adopting this cluster-specific
approach for our study is that it is more appropriate than
population-averaged GEE methods for estimating the effects
of within-cluster covariates, that is, covariates that change
within the subject (12). This is especially relevant for our
study, since the sign-specific exposure effects captured by
1 and 2 (in equation 2) that are our primary focus are
covariates of this type. Moreover, software that enables the
fitting of such models is also gradually becoming available
for general use (21, 22).
There are other advantages of the cluster-specific
approach as well. First, it allows for CNS/ANS signs from
the same child to be interrelated by allowing each child to
have a different mean prevalence for such signs. Second, the
incorporation of an additional subject-specific level of vari-
ability (2) ensures that we allow for regression heteroge-
neity by accommodating varying regression models across
children. Third, the multilevel model presented in equation 2
guards against aggregation bias by breaking down any struc-
Repeated Measures for Modeling Multiple Outcomes 895

ture in the data into within-child and between-children
components. Finally, the GLMM formulation provides esti-
mates that are clinically more meaningful, since they purport
to make inferences about the individual rather than a popula-
tion average as in the GEE (23).
Our approach
The literature on modeling of longitudinal and repeated
measures does not present any clear consensus on the rela-
tive statistical merits of either of the approaches discussed
above. Given the subtle differences in interpretation between
estimates derived from the two, either approach may be valid
depending on the question one is interested in answering.
Although the cluster-specific approach is considered more
appropriate for assessing the effects of within-cluster covari-
ates, at the same time it makes untestable assumptions about
the effects of cluster-level covariates (12). On the other
hand, although a marginal modeling approach may not be
suitable for estimating the within-cluster effects that are of
interest in this study, it does provide estimates that are more
robust to model misspecification (especially in terms of the
correlation structure in the data). However, this comes at a
price--unlike the GLMM, the GEE model is not strictly
parametric and hence does not produce a likelihood func-
tion--which makes it impossible to use traditional likeli-
hood-based procedures for model selection or to determine
goodness-of-model fit.
The competing considerations discussed above present a
substantial dilemma for us, since within-cluster sign-specific
exposure effects that are best estimated by cluster-specific
approaches are the focus of our study, while the population-
averaged approach provides robust estimates that are more
intuitively appealing from a public health perspective. In
light of these concerns and the consequent ambiguities that
are involved, we decided to apply both approaches to our
data to enable the answering of different kinds of research
questions and, simultaneously, to investigate whether these
two approaches produce different conclusions in this respect.
RESULTS
Figures 1­4 present the results from fitting the models
presented in equations 1 and 2 to our data. Aside from sign-
specific intercepts and cocaine and opiate effects, potential
confounders (such as study site, maternal race, socioeco-

nomic status (Medicare insurance used as a proxy for the
same), infant gestational age, and prenatal exposure to
tobacco, alcohol, and marijuana) were also included as cova-
riates in both these models.
The GEE model (equation 1) was fitted in SAS version 8.2
(SAS Institute, Inc.) software using the alternating logistic
regression algorithm (24) that uses odds ratios rather than
correlation coefficients to model dependence between signs
from the same child. This model estimated the odds ratio for
within-subject dependence (i.e., e) to be 4.2 (95 percent
confidence interval: 3.8, 4.7), indicating substantial within-
child (or intracluster) dependence in the data. Further, it
strongly rejected the possibility of a common global expo-
sure effect for either cocaine (p < 0.0001) or opiates (p =
0.009), thus supporting our formulation of separate sign-
specific effects for each.
The GLMM presented in equation 2 was fitted using the
"xtlogit" command in STATA version 7.0 (Stata Corpora-
tion) software, which estimates the parameters in a GLMM
using Gaussian quadrature. This approach yielded an esti-
mated subject-level variability (2) of 2.25 (95 percent confi-
dence interval: 2.0, 2.6), which again attests to the presence
of substantial within-child dependence in the data. As in the
GEE model, the possibility of a common global exposure
effect was strongly rejected here for both cocaine (p =
0.0001) and opiates (p < 0.0001), thus supporting our formu-
lation of separate sign-specific effects for each.
The results presented in figures 1­4 show that the GEE
and GLMM approaches produced similar results in most
cases. However, there are some subtle differences that are
worth mentioning. The cocaine effects for two central
nervous system signs (difficult to console and high-pitched
cry) are statistically significant (i.e., the 95 percent confi-
dence intervals for the odds ratios exclude the value of 1.0)
for the GLMM but not for the GEE model (figure 4). More-
over, compared with the GEE model, the within-cluster (i.e.,
sign-specific) cocaine/opiate effects estimated by the
GLMM appear to have consistently higher magnitudes and
wider confidence limits (figures 3 and 4). Interestingly, this
pattern seems to be reversed for the other factors included in
the model (intercepts and cluster/individual-level sociode-
mographic covariates), where the GEE estimates have
consistently higher magnitudes and wider confidence limits
for statistically significant factors (figures 1 and 2).
These results are largely along expected lines. They bear
out the assertions made in the literature that, while popula-
tion-averaged GEE approaches are most appropriate for
assessing the effects of cluster-level covariates (for these

effects the GLMM yields attenuated estimates and confi-
dence intervals that are too narrow), within-cluster covari-
ates are best estimated using cluster-specific GLMM (25). In
the latter situation, it is the GEE approach that yields attenu-
ated estimates and confidence intervals that are too narrow.
This is expected because, by definition, the population-aver-
aged approach averages individual cocaine/opiate effects
across subjects, and this generally attenuates the estimated
effect size (25). Score tests for the GEE model and likeli-
hood ratio tests for the GLMM indicated substantial cocaine
and opiate effects overall (p < 0.0001 in all cases), although
not all signs were significantly, or similarly, affected (figures
3 and 4). Other significant covariates included study site and
prenatal exposure to tobacco (figure 2).
DISCUSSION
In the largest multisite study of its kind to date, we found
that prenatal exposures to both cocaine and opiates were
strongly associated with elevated risk of CNS/ANS manifes-
tations. These effects were present even after controlling for
interdependence among multiple signs observed on the same
child, as well as potential confounders such as race, gesta-
tional age, socioeconomic status, and prenatal exposures to
tobacco, alcohol, and marijuana. Moreover, even though
different signs were found to be differentially associated
with cocaine and opiate exposure in terms of both magnitude
and statistical significance, opiate effects, in general, were of
a larger magnitude than those for cocaine. Further substan-
tive details on these findings and their clinical and public
health implications have been discussed at length by Bada et
al. (7).
In terms of statistical methodology, we have presented
here an approach that adapts repeated measures techniques
used primarily for analyzing longitudinal binary data to
model multiple clinical outcomes (of the presence/absence
variety) manifest by the same subject at the same time simul-
taneously. This formulation recognizes implicitly that all the
outcomes may be interrelated and could together constitute
one syndrome. Simultaneous modeling of all the outcomes
also boosts statistical efficiency and avoids the multiple
comparisons problem, while allowing for the testing of
outcome-specific effects, if necessary. There are subtle
differences in conceptualization and interpretation between
the population-averaged GEE and the cluster-specific
GLMM methods that may be used for implementing this

approach, and either method (or both) may be appropriate,
depending on the research question(s) being posed. Though
small in most cases, these differences are borne out by the
results presented for this study. In sum, outcome-specific
effects may be reliably estimated from a GLMM, while
subject-level effects may be best estimated using a GEE
model.
The methods described in this paper are applicable in more
general settings involving multiple outcomes measured
simultaneously on the same subject. In fact, they are suitable
for any set of outcomes that can be modeled using the expo-
nential family of distributions. For example, suppose we had
continuous, categorical, or count responses instead of the
binary outcomes that we have dealt with here. Such a situa-
tion can be modeled in both the population-averaged and
cluster-specific approaches by suitably altering the logit link
function for the expected value of the response that is speci-
fied in equations 1 and 2. For continuous outcomes this
would be the identity link, for count data it would be the log
link, and so on. Even for binary outcomes, other links such
as the probit link may be explored. We do, however, caution
that the STATA "xtlogit" command we have used to esti-
mate our GLMM parameters cannot accommodate other link
functions (such as log or probit) or more complicated corre-
lation structures (e.g., a three-level hierarchical model with
multiple binary outcomes nested in individuals nested in
clinical sites). Other software options would need to be
explored in such situations. In sum, since investigators in
public health research frequently measure multiple clinical
outcomes on the same subject at the same time, we believe
that the principles underlying the methods described in this
paper are of significant importance to public health research
in general.

FIGURE 4. Results from simultaneous modeling of multiple central and autonomic nervous system signs in newborns, the multisite (Detroit,
Michigan, Memphis, Tennessee, Miami, Florida, and Providence, Rhode Island) Maternal Lifestyle Study, 1993­1995. Parameter estimates for
sign-specific cocaine effects (presented as odds ratios) were derived using both the population-averaged generalized estimating equation (GEE)
and the cluster-specific generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) approaches. A horizontal bar placed at odds ratio = 1 indexes no effect. High
cry, high-pitched cry; diff console, difficult to console; nasal stuff, nasal stuffiness.
