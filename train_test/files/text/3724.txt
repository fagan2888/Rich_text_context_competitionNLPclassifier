Historically, women have faced systematic barriers with
regard to their participation in science, technology, engineer-
ing, and mathematics (STEM) education and careers. In the
United States, there still remains the belief that women do
not possess the intelligence to be successful in science and
math subjects (Good, Aronson, & Harder, 2008; Gornick,
1990). Furthermore, the belief that Blacks are less intelligent
creates barriers to access (McGrady & Reynolds, 2013;
Smith, 1990; Tettegah, 1996). This serves to perpetuate the
underrepresentation of Blacks in STEM education and
careers (Hill, Corbett, & Rose, 2010; National Academy of
Sciences, 2007; National Science Foundation [NSF], 2013).
The study addresses the following question:
Research Question 1: How have Panamanian, Afro
Caribbean immigrant women navigated the barriers of
race and gender to persist in STEM training and partici-
pate in STEM careers?
Understanding how these women successfully maneu-
vered through these hegemonic and misogynistic systems
may lead to supportive strategies for all women of African
descent who are presently underrepresented in STEM. These
women not only participated in STEM but also rose to lead-
ership and management positions in their respective fields.
Fries-Britt, Mwangi, and Peralta (2014) assert that racial
and ethnic identities are formulated from one's home
country, and their unique construction regarding race/ethnic
identification affects individual and group identity. This
study argues that socio-cultural factors and beliefs form the
self-identity of the women, and this influenced their tenacity
toward their STEM vocation. It does not rely on a science
identity model for women of color because (even within
those models) the authors conclude that further research is
needed to understand why students engage in those specific
identity behaviors (Carlone & Johnson, 2007). Borrowing
from the works of Ogbu (1978, 1992, 2008) and Banks
(2004), a theoretical framework on identity is proposed to
understand the construction of group or collective identity
but not to assert that group identity formation are the same
for Afro Caribbean and African Americans; they are not.
This study relies on ethnic and cultural markers to define
the term Black rather than relying on racial constructs. It
therefore uses the terms Black women and women of African
descent interchangeably. Race constructs attempt to create
social structures that provide privilege for those who possess
comparatively lighter skin (Burton, Bonilla-Silva, Ray,
Buckelew, & Freeman, 2010; Machery & Faucher, 2005).

Navigating STEM: Afro Caribbean
Women Overcoming Barriers of
Gender and Race
Beverly A. King Miller1
Abstract
This article explores issues related to science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), participation and
underrepresentation specifically in regard to women of African descent. Drawing from a larger qualitative, grounded case
study, the article examines the experiences of Panamanian Afro Caribbean women in STEM and their successful navigation of
race and gender barriers related to education and employment in STEM. Ogbu and Banks are used to inform the discussion
regarding the formation of group identity. Data were collected and triangulated by interviews, surveys, observations, and
documents. The findings revealed that socio-cultural values and strategies from their Caribbean community provided the
support needed to build a positive self-identity. In addition, middle-class values that included educational attainment and hard
work further supported their persistence through STEM education and their participation in STEM careers. A new model,
the Self-Actualization Model (SAM), emerged as graphic representation for presenting the findings.

Based on these constructs, those who are defined as Black
experience the limitations in their educational attainment,
occupational attainment, and social mobility (Coleman,
1988; Reid, 1938; Wilson, 1987).
Furthermore, critical race theory (CRT) will be used as a
lens for data analysis. "CRT is a framework that can be used
to theorize, examine and challenge the ways race and racism
implicitly and explicitly impact on social structures, prac-
tices and discourses" (Yosso, 2005, p. 70). The text considers
Collins's (2000) critical social theory to interrogate the ways
in which identity that is prescribed by others serve to define
those of African descent. From the experiences of these Afro
Caribbean women, insights are gleaned into the specific
challenges that exist for women of African descent.
STEM careers are lucrative and tend to include high sala-
ries and economic opportunities (Ong, 2011; Saxenian,
1999). Using the STEM Occupation Classification, STEM
careers include all those employed in computer, mathemat-
ics, engineering, life science, physical science, and social
science. STEM-related occupations include health care pro-
fessionals, architects, and technicians to name a few
(Landivar, 2013). Furthermore, Sadler, Sonnert, Hazari, and
Tai (2012) use a survey to assess the responses of those in
STEM and their direct support to students to interrogate the
gender inequities in STEM. They classify STEM workers as
those with research and expertise in science (i.e., biologist,
engineers); they include scientists and science teachers
because of their STEM knowledge and direct influence in
supporting students through STEM pipelines.
In this study, I will use STEM with this broad definition to
include all those in science, technology/computer science,
engineering, mathematics, health professions, and those
teachers who specifically teach science and influence those
who aspire a STEM career.
Review of the Literature
There has been a steady increase in the representation of
women in STEM since the 1970s, nonetheless women only
occupy 26% of STEM jobs, and men hold 74% (Landivar,
2013). The NSF (2013) reported that although gender contin-
ues to be an issue for STEM membership, disparity contin-
ues in racial classification as well. The findings revealed that
in 2010, White males represented 51% of all science and
engineering jobs, and White women represented 18%. This
indicates that Whites represent 69% of all STEM jobs and
represent 63.6% of the U.S. population. Asians had a com-
bined gender membership of 18% in STEM, although they
are 5% of the population (for this reason, they are not classi-
fied as underrepresented in STEM). Blacks are 12% of the
population but only 5% of STEM members.
The pattern of underrepresentation is especially disheart-
ening when focused on Black women, or women of African
descent. Although these women are 6% of the total Black
population in the United States, they held only 2% of science
and engineering jobs. This is a significant underrepresenta-
tion in gender as well as race (NSF, 2013).
In 2005, 40% of all full-time faculty in colleges and univer-
sities in the United States were women (McNeely & Vlaicu,
2010). However, of the 7,000 computer science doctoral fac-
ulty in 2006, only 60 were reported as African American
women.Also, less than 1% of the 17,150 postsecondary teach-
ers in engineering were African American women. African
American women appeared to fare only slightly better in the
biological sciences holding 380 out of 25,000 faculty positions
(Hill et al., 2010). There remains a gap between women of
African descent and the remaining tenured faculty.
However, the data cited does not differentiate African
Americans from foreign-born Blacks. Therefore, it may be
the case that the numbers cited do not solely represent the
percentage of African Americans present in STEM in com-
parison with foreign-born members of African descent.
Instead, these statistics may be representative of all Black
women inclusive of immigrants employed in STEM careers
within the United States (i.e., Afro Caribbeans and Africans).
Harvard University admissions data reported that of the
530 Black undergraduates enrolled in 2003-2004, only 180
were not foreign-born. This reflected an increase in the popu-
lation of African and West Indians on their campus (Roach,
2005). This challenges Affirmative Action assumptions
regarding access and diversity among African Americans or
Native Born Blacks. Diversity on such campuses may have
increased for those of African descent, but there is not a sig-
nificant increase among the African American community.
What seems to be emerging is a pattern of inclusion in STEM
educational pathways and careers among foreign-born Blacks
from theAfro Caribbean immigrant population (Glenn, 2007).
Although literature continues to highlight the underrepre-
sentation of African American and Hispanic females in
STEM, there remains a gap. Literature has not considered the
inclusion of immigrant women in STEM who are of African
descent and Hispanic. This population is racialized as Black
and experience similar struggles for inclusion as African
American women (Burton et al., 2010; Fries-Britt et al.,
2014; Quiros & Dawson, 2013).
The term Hispanic is not a racial term but an ethnic one,
and therefore, a female may be of African descent and of
Hispanic heritage; it means they speak fluent Spanish and are
acculturated in the Hispanic culture (Quiros & Dawson,
2013; Tatum, 1997). The racialization rooted in American
society and the emphasis on race is often unfamiliar to Black
immigrants because their racial identity is shaped from a
country other than the United States (Fries-Britt et al., 2014).
In many of the countries that Black immigrants arrive, iden-
tity is shaped by ethnicity rather than race.
Afro Caribbean Immigrants
Afro Caribbeans are the largest Black immigrant population
in the United States, comprising 9% of the overall immigrant
King Miller 3
population (McCabe, 2011). Of this number, about 8% are
from Spanish-speaking countries, including the Dominican
Republic, Mexico, Panama, and Cuba. With regard to
Panama, one third of those who immigrated to the United
States in 2005 self-identified as Black (Kent, 2007).
Furthermore, Panamanians have the highest reported edu-
cated adults or those with at least a bachelor's degree at the
time of emigration (Stoney & Batalova, 2013).
Tseng (2006) found that first-, second-, and third-genera-
tion immigrants who were European, African, Afro
Caribbean, Asian, and Latin American entered math and sci-
ence fields at similar rates. However, in the second and third
generation, students from each ethnic group showed a sig-
nificant decrease in selecting math and science fields of
study. Thus, the more assimilated the immigrant population
becomes in the American educational system, the greater the
likelihood that they will abandon the pursuit of STEM-
related subjects and careers (Tseng, 2006).
One concern is the ways in which the educational system
begins to marginalize students based on skin color once they
become assimilated into American culture. This may result
in a disparity between new immigrants and those who may
look and sound like African Americans. For the second gen-
eration and those who arrived in the United States very
young, there is pressure from their African American peers to
conform in speech and behavior (Woldemikael, 1989). In
addition, becauseAfro Caribbeans share the same racial clas-
sification as African Americans, they are vulnerable to the
same forms of racial discrimination (Rogers, 2006).
Afro Caribbean women in particular have a long history
of STEM participation as nurses in the United States (Clarke
& Riviere, 1989). In contrast to the findings in the underrep-
resentation of Blacks in STEM careers, Afro Caribbean
women from Panama have navigated STEM education suc-
cessfully and advanced into STEM career pathways. Afro
Caribbean women were the highest earners when compared
with African Americans and African, French, and Spanish
immigrants of African descent (Corra & Kimuna, 2009).
This earning advantage could be due to their career choice in
STEM-related fields. However, the careers were not disag-
gregated. Nevertheless, Afro Caribbean women seem to be
realizing greater success in some areas of STEM (i.e., nurses
and other health professions). Furthermore, when compared
with African Americans, Afro Caribbean immigrants had
higher household incomes and were more likely to own their
own homes and to have completed at least a college degree
(Manuel, Taylor, & Jackson, 2012).
Theoretical Framework
Collective Identity
To explain the racialized structure in the United States that
many Black immigrants encounter, I draw on the work of
John Ogbu, a researcher and Black immigrant to the United
States. John Ogbu (1978, 1992) argues that social structures
are designed to privilege one group (high caste), while others
are assigned to service-level castes (low caste). He explains
that in the United States, those who are characterized as the
dominant class, or high caste, are of European decent or
Caucasians. Those who are characterized as minorities or are
non-White are often relegated to low-caste status. Ogbu
(1978, 1992) identifies two groups with regard to minority
status: involuntary and voluntary minorities. Involuntary
minorities are those who were subjugated against their will.
According to Ogbu, U.S. involuntary minorities include
African Americans, Native Americans, and Hispanics of the
Southwest. They are tasked with learning the language and
culture of the dominant group to assimilate. Furthermore,
this assimilation into the dominant culture system is often
necessary to participate in the socio-cultural structure; how-
ever, the dominant group is not compelled to learn the cul-
ture or language of the involuntary minority group (Ogbu,
1978, 2008).
Conversely, voluntary minorities moved from their home
country to the host country by choice. They are able to leave
of their own volition and select another host country at will
(Ogbu, 1978; Rogers, 2006). They often believe that stereo-
types imposed by the dominant culture do not necessarily
include them (Waters, 1999).
Voluntary minorities to the United States who are of
African descent often do not share a history that includes a
hegemonic structure that perpetuates a low-caste involuntary
minority identity. Collective identity (Ogbu, 2008) is shaped
by the socio-cultural structures that constrain agency (Hays,
1994). Collective identity is ultimately expressed in the form
of the beliefs, feelings, and cultural symbols that inform a
shared sense of belonging. Afro Caribbeans began as slaves
or involuntary minorities in their island homes. However,
during and after slavery, they took advantage of economic
opportunities to create better educational and economic out-
comes for future generations (Klein, 1986; Newton, 2004).
These opportunities provided for their movement in class
status through economic and educational attainment within
the Caribbean social system (Beckles, 1999; Klein, 1986).
Social Structure and Identity Construction
Weber (1994) describes class as any group of persons who
occupy the same situation. He describes two class structures:
the property class and the acquisition class. The property
class owns property, and has political control and access to
resources. These resources include the ability to take advan-
tage of educational opportunities for themselves and their
children. In contrast, the acquisition class does not possess
the advantages of the property class. Instead, they use oppor-
tunities to acquire the services and goods that are available to
the property class.
Acquiring an education is valued by the property class.
By extension, due to their persistence for education, it
4 SAGE Open
appears that Afro Caribbean immigrants are striving for
membership in the property class. Although some Afro
Caribbean immigrants may not have the economic wealth to
be proper members of the property class, it appears they
adopt the behaviors and values of the property class to move
out of the acquisition class.
Class and caste membership structures are a reflection of
the social structure (Ogbu, 1978; Rothstein, 2004; Wilson,
1987). The U.S. social structure appears to support Whites as
the primary members of the property class, or dominant
group. It also distinguishes African Americans from Afro
Caribbeans and other immigrants of African descent who are
Black because of the ways in which the hegemonic structure
served to constrain the African American population.
After slavery, Jim Crow laws determined where Black
Americans could eat, shop, walk, and live. These laws
imposed a structure that confined Black Americans to a
low-caste, second-class citizenship. This hegemonic
structure defined the boundaries and social movement.
Thus, "Blacks did not become over-represented in the
lower class in America because their genetic make-up
was inferior, but because they were enslaved, then segre-
gated and barred from equal opportunity for more than
another century" (Rothstein, 2004, p. 17). At its founda-
tion, this structure was designed to ensure that those of
African descent, who were brought to the country as
involuntary minorities, were assigned to the low caste. In
contrast, Afro Caribbeans who entered the United States
as voluntary minorities personified a collective identity
exempt of the confines of the class membership that
African Americans fought to resist (Rothstein, 2004;
Thernstrom & Thernstrom, 1997).
To further articulate the conundrum for African
Americans, James Banks (2004) identifies typologies that
have affected African American collective identity. The goal
of Banks' typologies is ultimately to support the individual
so that the result will be an increase in self-esteem that pro-
duces positive academic performance. He identifies five
stages of cultural identity typologies.
The first stage is cultural psychological captivity. The
individuals possess internalized negative stereotypes and
beliefs about their cultural group. As a result, they express
self-rejection and self-hatred. The second stage is cultural
encapsulation. Individuals participate in limited interactions
with their cultural group. They may choose to isolate them-
selves from their culture and community group. The third
stage is cultural identity clarification. Individuals develop
positive attitudes toward their cultural group. The fourth
stage is biculturalism. Individuals develop a healthy sense of
cultural identity and psychological characteristics that sup-
port successful participation in their own cultural commu-
nity, as well as in others. The final stage is multiculturalism.
Individuals who have developed a healthy sense of their own
cultural identity are now empowered to participate in the
global community (Banks, 1997, 2004).
Banks (2004) asserts that the five stages may not be lin-
ear. There may be times when an individual may return to a
stage that he or she had previously mastered. He ultimately
promotes a multicultural curriculum in which African
Americans can see themselves positively portrayed and
achieve academic success.
Several important implications emerge from the asser-
tions made by Ogbu (1978, 1992, 2008) and Banks (1997,
2004), as well as the empirical evidence from the literature.
Both agree that history and hegemony affect individual iden-
tity development that may lead to a collective identity. Ogbu
explains that as involuntary minorities, African Americans
have made social resolutions that affect their identity to resist
the low-caste membership (i.e., changes in speech and lan-
guage). The resistance to the hegemonic structure has
resulted in identity fragmentation that is exhibited in Banks'
typologies.
In contrast, identity for Afro Caribbeans as voluntary
minorities to the United States is reflected in their choice to
enter and submit to the hegemonic system and structure.
Their decision to enter such systems is rooted in the belief
that inclusion will produce greater access to occupational
and educational opportunities that will serve to benefit future
generations (Mortimer & Bryce-Laporte, 1981). From
Banks' typologies, Afro Caribbeans may be considered in
Stage 4, biculturalism. They participate in the culture of the
United States while still maintaining their Caribbean culture
(Waters, 1999). It is from this socio-cultural system and col-
lective identity that their persistence in STEM education and
careers gains its potency.
Significance of the Study
As a result of slavery and colonization, there are differences
in culture and identity formation for Afro Caribbeans and
African Americans with regard to work that affects their
access and inclusion to STEM careers (Waters, 1999).
Research has not unpacked the strategies of persistence of
Afro Caribbean females in STEM. It is essential to be cogni-
zant of their strategies to encourage all females of African
descent in their pursuance of STEM careers. The goal of this
study is to expound on the cultural identity characteristics
and strategies that will support STEM education training and
subsequent careers for underrepresented populations.
Method
This study is drawn from a larger qualitative case study. In
case study research, the issue is explored through one or
more cases within a bounded system (Creswell, 2007). The
data sources for a case study may include observations, inter-
views, or reports and documents (Creswell, 2007).
The selected qualitative approach is the most beneficial
way to address my research question and exploration of the
experiences of how this group of Afro Caribbean women
King Miller 5
from the country of Panama navigated the barriers of race
and gender that often limit access to STEM careers. Using a
case study approach allowed for the exploration of the lived
experiences of this particular group of Afro Caribbean
women. My goal was to better understand the strategies that
enabled these women to persist in their STEM training and
participate in their STEM career. The selected case study
approach affords the opportunity to focus on this small
group, to thickly describe their reported strategies, and to see
what concepts and theories emerge from the data.
Participants
Five Afro Caribbean women from Panama were selected
for the study. Panamanian women were selected because of
the historical relationship their families had with White
Americans in the building of the Panama Canal. New York
City was selected because it is a major city of entry for all
immigrants in general and Afro Caribbeans in particular
(Advincula, 2007). It is one of the cities with the largest
Afro Caribbean populations (McCabe, 2011). Participants
were recruited from members in the Afro Caribbean com-
munity through churches, schools, and neighborhood hos-
pitals. A purposive sample (Bogdan & Biklen, 2007;
Creswell, 2007; Lincoln & Guba, 1985) was determined to
best meet the needs of this research. All participants were
from a specific immigrant population representing a spe-
cific community in the United States with information and
strategies to amass an understanding of the research ques-
tion that would lead to a grounded theory design analysis
(Lincoln & Guba, 1985). Three selection criteria for the
purposive sample were used.
The first criterion was that the women had to be currently
or previously employed in a STEM career. STEM careers
were defined by the STEM Occupation Classification list of
the NSF to include science teachers, nurses, and psycholo-
gists (Landivar, 2013). The second criterion for selection
was the participants had to verify that their parents or grand-
parents had voluntarily immigrated to Panama from varying
Caribbean islands to work on the Panama Canal building
project with the American government.
Each of the study participants had voluntarily migrated to
the United States from Panama between 1965 and 1975. All
participants were bilingual speaking both English and
Spanish, and were born in the Central American country of
Panama. They lived either in Colon, the port city of entry for
Caribbeans, or in Panama City. Participants selected their
own pseudonyms for the study as shown in Table 1.
Data Sources
Interviews.In qualitative research, knowledge is produced
through social interactions (Kvale & Brinkmann, 2009). In
this process, an interview is "an interchange of views
between two persons conversing about a common theme"
(Kvale, 1996, p. 44). Interviews were conducted individually
in a location agreed on by the researcher and participant. The
interviews were at their homes, restaurants, or work places.
There were over 50 open-ended interview and probing ques-
tions used throughout the individual interviews. The inter-
views lasted 5 to 8 hr over 3 days. The questions focused on
(a) the socio-cultural elements of Afro Caribbean identity,
(b) strategies and skills from their culture that enabled them
to negotiate the barriers in STEM education and careers, (c)
strategies and skills from their experiences that can be used
to inform work with other females of African descent.
Demographic survey. The survey was emailed to those partici-
pants who were presently employed; it was given in person
to those who were retired and were traveling between the
United States and Panama at the time of the inquiry. The pro-
tocol for writing this survey was taken from several sources.
I drew on LeCompte and Preissle's (1993) description of a
confirmation survey, which uses structured questions to
gather key information. The questions were closed and quan-
tifiable (Marshall & Rossman, 1989). The survey also
included nominal questions about age, school attendance,
and college major and degree (LeCompte & Preissle, 1993).
Table 1 presents this information.
Field notes and observations. I used an ethnographic approach
to data collection through fieldnotes, which included jottings,
headnotes, and memos (Emerson, Fretz, & Shaw, 1995;

Mason, 1996; Schatzman & Strauss, 1973). I employed two
forms of fieldnotes: key word jottings and whole text jottings
(LeCompte & Preissle, 1993). For participants who were
presently employed, I visited their work sites and observed
them in situ. I recorded over 8 hr of observations per partici-
pant. I typed memo journals after each interaction with each
participant, which included the date, the participant pseud-
onym as per the Institutional Review Board, and a brief over-
view of the interaction from my perspective as the researcher
(Emerson et al., 1995; Schatzman & Strauss, 1973).
Data Analysis
Data were triangulated using open-ended interview ques-
tions, fieldnotes and observations, the qualitative survey, and
documents (Emerson et al., 1995; Kvale & Brinkmann,
1996; LeCompte & Preissle, 1993; Patton, 1980; Schatzman
& Strauss, 1973). The documents were derived from public
sources. It consisted of recognitions and awards attesting to
the participants'level of work-related success. All interviews
were personally transcribed and coded by the researcher
(Lincoln & Guba, 1985; Schatzman & Strauss, 1973; Strauss
& Corbin, 1990). The preferred language of the participants
was respected, and translations are provided where necessary
(Myers-Scotton, 2006).
The study employed a grounded theory approach, and the
procedures and protocol for such a design (Strauss & Corbin,
1990). Data analysis began from the time of initial collection
or interviews, and categories were developed from constant
comparisons derived from the theoretical memos written by
the researcher. Categories were formulated based on emerging
themes resulting from open coding, axial and selective coding
(Strauss & Corbin, 1990). Constant comparisons included
comparing incidences, stories, and descriptions that were
grouped and then structured into the model for clarity (Lincoln
& Guba, 1985). Furthermore, I contacted all participants for
member checking to ensure that they were in agreement with
my analyses (Glesne, 2006; Lincoln & Guba, 1985).
Research Findings
The analysis of the emergent themes contributed to the
STEM Attainment Model (SAM; see Figure 1) as a graphic
representation of the data. The SAM model emerged from
evidence of the strategies that helped them navigate race and
gender barriers to enter their STEM career. The model con-
sists of five levels. The discussion, which follows, begins
with the base of the model and progresses upward. There is a
hierarchical structure, with the base having the foundational
elements that are needed for the upper levels to build on.
Strong Family-of-Origin and Male Presence
Understading the influence each family had in the partici-
pats' career choices was a concern of the study. This proved
tobe a major factor for the women and forms the base of the
SM model. What emerged from their narratives were con-
tinuous references to family members who supported and
made intentional investments in their lives. Family members
were concerned about their positive development and sup-
ported their hopes and dreams. However, this circumstance
did not mean that the parents or caretakers were educated
(Afia's grandmother was illiterate), or had all the social and
financial means needed to support the women. Nevertheless,
they used what cultural and social assets (i.e., capital) they
had to invest in the lives of these women.
There was great interaction with family members in the
home and with extended family. Andrea reported that "Colon
only had 16 streets . . . everybody knew each other." This
small community provided parameters for the women. They
knew that others were watching and would report to their
families. The influence of family will be reflected in subse-
quent narratives.
Four of the five participants described their families' as
"poor." However, in discussing this notion of poverty, the
women agreed that it was relative to the situation.
We were poor, but we never saw ourselves as poor, we ate every
day, nobody ever came and cut off our lights, nobody ever came
and removed a piece of our furniture because it wasn't paid for.
(Andrea)
"Poor" implied the families lacked economic resources, and
educational attainment was made through financial sacrifices
by the families.
In concert with these findings, the women all identified
and valued the presence of a male authority figure in their
home. For example, Andrea in speaking about her self-confi-
dence credits her father saying, "My father was a very strong
believer in himself." The males in the household also appar-
ently interacted with their daughters and transferred values
and principles to them. Dorcas offered in this regard, "We

King Miller 7
always had a book shelf . . . my father always brought books
home." Andrea also shared that her father did not allow his
daughters to read romance novels or comics but only litera-
ture from reputable writers. By guiding the printed reading
material their daughters were exposed to, these fathers influ-
enced their learning outcomes.
These fathers also helped with the process of education.
Nubia shared that at noon when her father arrived home for
his lunch, each child would have to share their lessons from
school (the children also came home for lunch). She remem-
bered, "If we were having a problem we told him . . . he said,
OK, if I don't have an answer by tonight, I will bring some-
body that has the answer." Again, all participants lived with
a male in the home whether he was their father or grandfather
or both. In cases where they were from single-parent moth-
ers, these mothers lived in their parents' home with their
child, thus exposing the child to the grandfather/father.
Strong Cultural Identity
Strength in their cultural identity was a second factor and is
the second level in SAM. This emerged as the second tier
because it stems from the values transmitted from the family
of origin. All the women affirmed that they identified them-
selves primarily by phenotype or ethnic markers (i.e., Black,
Black Panamanian, Black Hispanic, Jamaican Panamanian,
and African American [as in from the Americas]).
The term Black referred only to their skin color. Fusia
states that as a Hispanic Panamanian, "Black has to do with
the color of my skin . . . but my culture will be one influenced
by the Spanish culture, heritage and beliefs." Afia self-iden-
tified as Black because, "it's the first thing people see is this"
(she points to her arm indicating the skin color).
The women described instances when the term Black was
seen as exclusively for African American to the exclusion of
themselves. Dorcas's explained that she corrected her
Hispanic students when they tried to tell her that she was not
Black, meaning she was not African American because she
spoke Spanish and was from Central America. Sometimes
they too were of African descent but did not consider them-
selves Black. The term Black, in their minds, was reserved
for African Americans. She remembered, "They would say,
`pero maestra [but teacher], you are not Black.' I tell them,
`No, you are Black too.'"
This problem was exacerbated when she found that even
the White teachers at the school where she taught biology
identified her as other than Black. They reserved the term
Black for African Americans only.
They would tell me, "You are different" . . . I would say, "What
are you talking about?" . . . "Different from American Blacks" .
. . I said, "No, Black is Black no matter what" . . . They would
say, "You have an accent" . . . I said, "You do too . . . why do you
criticize the ones that came from the South with their accent?
Their accent is like the children's [African American students']
accent." (Dorcas)
Dorcas found that not only Black immigrants but also White
Americans reserved the term Black for African Americans,
while categorizing Black immigrants by their ethnicity (i.e.,
Jamaican, West Indian, and African). Afia explained that this
strategytoseparateBlackimmigrantsfromAfricanAmericans
is used as a tactic to divide those of African descent.
I see "African American" in the broader sense . . . when the cop
stops you he's not identifying your accent, but your race. I think
the business of saying, "Those people from America" is a divide
and conquer strategy because ultimately you are Black. (Afia)
The women in the study were taught about the founding
Black leaders such as Marcus Garvey (Jamaican) and the
Pan-African movement (Crawford, 2004), as well as Stokely
Carmichael's (Trinidadian) Black Power Movement
(Carmichael, 1971). Afia describes her family by saying,
"Those people were all Garveyites . . . those people who
were conscious." Garvey made a tremendous impact on the
Caribbean community. Similarly, Dorcas in response to the
Jewish teachers attempting to create a wedge between her
and her African American colleagues responded with a quote
from Carmichael: "Black is Black no matter what."
The collective identity of these Afro Caribbean women
seemed to be grounded in cultural roots that was shaped in a
Black identity constructed by other Blacks and not by mem-
bers of the dominant group.
Banks (2004) explains the importance of this by stating
that interaction with Whites in American society has pro-
duced levels of dysfunction in the African American com-
munity resulting in some individuals being in a state of
psychological captivity. Conversely, for Afro Caribbeans,
their apparent inoculation against some of the psychological
dysfunction may be attributed to the fact that they are histori-
cally from islands or communities in which they were the
majority. Nubia, for example, recognized that there was a
psychological difference between herself and her African
American counterpart. African American women had sur-
vived a social system that used fear to keep Blacks in their
caste through "images of lynchings" and "`Whites only'
signs," thus maintaining the hegemonic structures of caste
and class.
I wasn't raised in the U.S.; I wasn't raised under a Jim Crow
experience. I don't have those images in my head . . . That's not
part of my psyche. I think I was telling him [referring to her
husband], I was recounting an issue that I had with a policeman
in Brooklyn, New York. I refused to move. And he told me that
I had to move, and I told him no, I was not moving . . . and there
were quite a lot of people around me . . . and I told him that he
needed to move because he was on the wrong side of the steps .
. . He said, "I'm a police officer." And I said, "I'm not moving"
. . . My husband said, "No other Black person in America would
have done that" . . . He said, "You just don't do that, you don't
buck the system" . . . I did not see him [the police officer] as
8 SAGE Open
White versus Black, I saw him as violating a basic rule, courtesy.
(Nubia)
The absence of the negative mental images and fears instilled
by White authorities allowed Nubia to question the officer
who happened to be violating the rules of the subway. She
was confident enough to challenge his discourteous behavior
in spite of his skin color and position.
Andrea also challenged the belief of her sister who was
complaining that "people made her feel less than." She
offered, "`They make' . . . and I come away with what I
KNOW and I BELIEVE and if I believe what `they' say. It's
not, `they made me.' It's because I believed it." This is a
powerful statement about her self-identity and self-affirma-
tion. Her response further reflects the choice she made in
negating the hegemonic structures that attempt to define and
limit her racial membership.
Transferable Values, Strategies, and Skills
Transferable values and strategies was the next level of
STEM Attainment that emerged from the data. This was
derived during the analysis by constantly comparing the sto-
ries and the words used to describe the values and the skills
deemed important to the women. By the term transferable
values, I mean values or skills that were conveyed verbally
and nonverbally by the family and Caribbean community.
Four examples were identified:
The first value was commitment to education. All of the
women shared that education was valued and its importance
instilled by their families. Andrea and Nubia mentioned that
they routinely discussed their daily lessons with their parents
who were actively involved in the learning process. Dorcas
also recounted that as a child, she would attempt to listen to
her father and the eruditos [educated men]. She recalled,
"They were talking about the war, Dubois, and different
Black Americans who were struggling." Her father and the
men gathered around the newspaper to discuss world affairs
and specifically those that affected people ofAfrican descent.
Second, each of the participants had parents or grandpar-
ents who were determinants in their academic success.
That is, they worked to establish continuity between home
and school values, linguistically and socioeconomically.
For example, Fusia's grandparents sent her to a school that
had the reputation for training females whose goal was to
attend college. Nubia's mother and father both attended
parent meetings regarding her academic progress. Because
there was no program available in Panama, Afia would be
allowed to travel to the United States to earn a degree in
psychology. All the women learned English for communi-
cation in their home and community, and learned Spanish
for academic instruction and interactions outside of the
Caribbean community.
Literacy was a third value. Being readers and supporting
reading and literacy skills was inductively derived from the
stories of the women. All of the participants' male caretakers
demonstrated the importance of literacy by either reading to
these women or procuring books for them to read.Apparently,
these books included substantive literature, as Andrea
reported. All of the women shared that they saw the men and
some of the women in their homes reading. Literacy was
overtly communicated as a value. Nubia's grandparents were
instrumental in her reading in the home. She explained, "I
learned English from my grandparents . . . they taught us to
read and write English at home . . . you had to read the Bible."
The fourth notable value was using free time for informal
education and skill building. All of the women engaged in
extra curricula activities including crocheting, sewing, play-
ing an instrument, and swimming. Afia indicated that her
mother took her to the ballet although she did not have the
extra income for such luxuries. She recalled, "Some of the
family members used to laugh when she took me to the bal-
let." These educational enrichment opportunities extended
beyond sports to skills that could be used to support them-
selves. Andrea used her cosmetology skills to earn extra
money to pay for college.
These middle-class values and awareness of interactions
in a world that is influenced by the dominant White society
meant that these women learned the rules and behavior for
Caribbean culture, but they also learned dominant culture
rules, values, and behavior. These appeared to influence how
they behaved and dressed to affect their public image. For
example, for our interview at her home, Dorcas was dressed
in business casual attire with dress shoes. She said it was
inappropriate to wear "pumps" (gym shoes) for our meeting
at her home. These standards regarding dress and appearance
seemed to help build the overall self-confidence that seemed
to exude from each participant.
Self-Confidence
Self-confidence is the next level of SAM. All of the partici-
pants noted the importance of believing in self as key to their
reaching STEM membership. Fusia agreed stating that the
nurturing received from her family served to "build my self-
esteem . . . ." Nubia also added, "I think that my mother and
father never discouraged me from accomplishing what I
wanted to accomplish."
Perhaps self-confidence was cultivated for these women
in part because they were not constantly compared with
Whites or any other dominant group. Their parents or grand-
parents were from nations where they were the majority.
These women were able to enact significant self-determina-
tion. Their personal success was measured by their percep-
tions about how they were doing in the United States as
compared with the opportunities for advancement they
would have experienced in their country-of-origin (Bryce-
Laporte, 1972).
Having self-confidence and support of family was dem-
onstrated by Fusia in her response to her school counselor.
King Miller 9
The counselor tried to encourage her to become a nurse
instead of a doctor. Although she followed his advice and
took the entry exam for nursing school, she also took the
exam for the school of podiatry where she was accepted. She
did not want to be limited to the gender stereotype for women
in STEM careers.
Hard Work and Perseverance Leads to
Opportunity
The next two levels of SAM are valuations of hard work and
opportunity. Three of the five women interviewed stated that
hard work and perseverance were the reasons for their suc-
cess in STEM. Dorcas echoed the American work ethic by
stating that hard work is a path to becoming "Whatever you
want to be." Andrea seemed to agree with this but added that
persistence is also important. She declared, "Believe in your-
self, set your goal and make sure everything that you do is
something that is going to accomplish that goal."
These women came from households where all of the
males except one were entrepreneurs and had their own busi-
nesses in Panama. They had observed their parents or grand-
parents work. All the women caregivers in their households
worked and contributed to the income of the family. Afia
affirmed that this was an African value where women are
expected to contribute to the economic wellness of the fam-
ily. She recalled that this was also evidenced in Caribbean
societies where men worked in the fields, but Caribbean
women went to the marketplaces to sell the produce.
In this social structure, women's work is important and
distinct from the work of men. Even those who were retired
continued to be involved through entrepreneurial endeavors
or serving on committees both in the United State and in
Panama. Andrea, in her work as wife, mother, and Senior
Vice President of New York City Health and Hospital
Corporation explained, ". . . it almost killed me physically."
Andrea became the first Quality Control Specialist for the
hospital systems in New York City because she chose to pur-
sue a certification program beyond her master's degree. By
challenging herself academically, Andrea had the credentials
needed when opportunities presented.
STEM Attainment
STEM attainment is the highest level of the SAM. The five
participants clearly exemplified all the requisites necessary
to reach this final stage. They were employed in or retired
from STEM careers. Each participant reported that she had
received encouragement from parents, grandparents, and the
community that instilled the self-confidence needed to pur-
sue their STEM career.
All of the participants had the distinction of being the first
person of African descent to hold their respective positions.
This means that, daily, they were challenged with dispelling
the myths regarding intelligence and STEM inclusion for
women of African descent. Nubia recounted a struggle with
her White supervisor when she was the only Black nurse on
the day shift at her hospital. This verbal exchange reflected
the difficulties of fighting for inclusion:
So I am the invisible nurse . . . I was not raised to think that you
define me, you don't define me . . . My father and mother raised
me to know who I am and what I am capable of and it doesn't
start with you. (Nubia)
Earlier in this altercation with her supervisor she had asserted,
"You do not define me, my parents define me." From Nubia's
response, we glean that her identity was not determined by
the opinions of her White co-workers. It was grounded in an
internal belief created by the many conversations and inter-
actions with her family. Often being the first to break the
"color barrier" means dispelling myths regarding Blacks. It
also can mean absorbing negative interactions while doing
the work with an excellence that is not required of others.
Second, for STEM attainment, the women noted the
importance of teachers and an educational system that
believes in children of African descent. Afia exhorted,
"teachers need to know every pupil doesn't learn the same
way." She further questions the over-inclusion of Black stu-
dents in special education classes. Rather than embracing a
belief based on intellectual differences, Fusia adds that
"teachers should be a cheerleader who will mentor Black stu-
dents and be a good source to . . . take them to the level to
achieve that STEM profession." All of the women believed
that the educational system is responsible for the attrition
rate of females of African descent in STEM education and
careers.
Discussion
The question for this study focused on how Afro Caribbean
immigrant women from Panama successfully navigated the
barriers through STEM education into their STEM career.
From the analysis, what emerged from the narratives of the
women was a graphic model reflecting the sources that led
to their ability to obviate the barriers due to race and gen-
der. The model began simply as an analytical tool to discuss
the data. However, after reflection, what surfaced were
strategies and skills that did not develop in isolation. Thus,
the need for a closer analysis of the SAM model was
imperative.
STEM Access: First Things First
At the foundation of the SAM model is the importance of
family and a male presence in the home or life of females.
The male presence is important for academic encouragement
and support for daughters (Goossen, 2009). When compar-
ing low-income boys and girls living in a home with their
fathers or father figure to low-income boys and girls living
10 SAGE Open
with mothers only, the group that lived with their father or
fatherfiguresscoredhigheronstandardizedtests(Vandamme,
1985). Saathoff (2015) found that among Mexican and
Mexican American families, education included the trans-
mission of family values, morals, and the skills to live in
society. There is much research stating that access to STEM
requires strong support from parents, teachers, and access to
STEM educational programs (Carlone & Johnson, 2007;
Russell & Atwater, 2005; Tan & Calabrese Barton, 2008).
However, this study finds that in addition to these factors,
there seems to be further elements at work for Afro
Caribbeans. These include a cultural identity that is defined
by the members of its own community and not constructed
by the dominant group. This cultural identity is reflected in
their collective identity (Ogbu, 2008). When there is constant
comparison to the dominant group, the Black­White binary
is strengthened, and Whites are used as the measuring rod for
success (Wiggan, 2007). This limits the formation of a col-
lective identity derived from the members of ones' own
group.
The next distinguishing element is the presence of cul-
tural values that include education and its supplemental
structures (i.e., literacy, positioning for success skill build-
ing). It became evident through these narratives that the par-
ents and guardians' intentional preparation (i.e., taking them
to extra classes and lessons, strategically selecting the
schools that will help in the accomplishment of their goals)
is an integral component in their success. These values and
component structures served to build self-confidence so that
the women would work hard and take advantage of opportu-
nities as they presented themselves.
The values and strategies from these families were similar
to middle-class families. Middle-class parents were more
likely to be concerned with giving their children opportuni-
ties and exposures that would provide them with socio-eco-
nomic advantages (Lareau, 2011). Their children are more
likely to engage in dance, music lessons, or sports (Lareau,
2011; Rothstein, 2004). In concert with this, the families of
my participants demonstrated that although they did not have
the discretionary income to fully participate and provide all
that middle-class children may receive, they nevertheless
attempted to provide their daughters with middle-class
opportunities when they could. They taught them middle-
class cultural habits through their exposure to ballet pro-
grams, formal cultural events, and dances. They taught them
the dress and behaviors expected for these events. Through
this informal education, they taught them how to be comfort-
able in these divergent settings as well as showing support
for the academic institutional formal training.
Developing Self-Confidence for STEM Access
Parental support and encouragement are understood to be
important aspects of fostering self-confidence, which is key
to the success of females in STEM (Rayman & Brett, 1995;
Scott & Mallinckrodt, 2005). They managed to avoid a major
hindrance for Blacks and females in the United States--spe-
cifically accepting the belief that they were less intelligent
and less able to succeed in math and science (Wortham,
2006). In the United States, females of African descent, in
addition to stereotype threats regarding race, also encounter
boundaries based on gender. These threats rooted in gender
bias send messages that females are less intelligent in math
and science subjects than males (Johnson, 2007). This is
apparent when Fusia was being persuaded to be a nurse
rather than a doctor. These threats to gender and race affect
self-confidence and lead to cultural psychological captivity
(Banks, 2004).
The Afro Caribbean collective identity seemed to insulate
the women from the systemic preconception of stereotype
threats regarding intelligence. Instead, it fostered and sup-
ported their desires to excel in arenas that are often desig-
nated for Whites only. When challenges arose academically,
they did not question their ability, but reported that they used
tutors and sought help. This seems to reflect a growth rather
than gift-oriented notion of intelligence (Dweck, 2007).
Beilock (2010) found that African American college students
chose to study alone rather than be perceived as less intelli-
gent by teachers and tutors. This belief system serves to
erode self-confidence and increase STEM attrition among
Black students. Until cultural identity clarification is
reached, individuals are stuck in a structure that accepts self-
hatred and self-rejection (Banks, 2004).
STEM Open Doors
Manski's (1993) theory of endogenous effects states that
individuals in a community tend to reproduce what they wit-
ness from other members in the system. So as the women
saw hard work modeled, and women's work valued, they
imitated this behavior. Waters (1999) found that Afro
Caribbeans held differing views regarding work than their
African American co-workers. They felt that African
Americans often did not take advantage of available work
and designated some jobs as beneath them. In contrast, Afro
Caribbeans often will take menial positions. They do not per-
ceive these jobs as defining their sense of self. Rather, they
are stepping stones to a better position. Afro Caribbeans are
stereotyped as working several jobs and taking the ethic of
hard work to an extreme. When African Americans were
interviewed about the work ethic of Afro Caribbeans, some
agreed that they were more hard-working and ambitious
(Waters, 1999). Kasinitz (1992) also identified, "In the case
of West Indians hard work certainly does play a role, as does
a reluctance to take public assistance" (p. 97).
These studies support the supposition that there is a differ-
ence in work ethic and beliefs about work for Afro
Caribbeans. One reason is minorities immigrate to a country
to improve their economic position and gain access to better
education for their children (Mortimer & Bryce-Laporte,
King Miller 11
1981). A second reason is that Afro Caribbeans have been
able to realize tangible benefits from their hard work (i.e.,
economic wealth, improved social status). This creates ideo-
logical differences; Afro Caribbeans have experienced a pay-
off for their hard work and perseverance. In contrast, African
Americans have not always experienced the compensation
for their work or educational attainment (Rothstein, 2004).
Ogbu's (1978) theory of a collective identity is a relevant
lens to consciously take note of Afro Caribbean immigrant
behavior in STEM. First, as a voluntary minority group, their
choice reflects a level of freedom and power. Second, their
identity is shaped based on their ability to garner power from
their former colonizers. Their ability to effect changes in
their social position reflects their sense of agency. However,
their identity is rooted in family, community, and country of
origin.
Collins (2000) supports the assertions the women make
for self-identity. They are proud to be defined by ethnicity
and that of those from their own community. Collins (2000)
states that, "Self-definition speaks to the power dynamics
involved in rejecting externally defined, controlling images
of Black womanhood" (p. 114). For collective identity to be
one that is reflective of the group, it must be formulated by
the members of the group and not by outsiders. This reso-
nates Nubia's strong cry to her supervisor: "You don't define
me." She recognized that her self-definition came from her
family, community, and country. Collins (2000) adds, "Self
is not defined as the increased autonomy gained by separat-
ing oneself from others. Instead, self is found in the context
of family and community" (p. 113). For those of African
descent, self-definition is couched in the context of the fam-
ily of origin and the ethnic heritage; members recognize and
accept their connectivity to the group is the strength that is
needed to persist.
Banks (2004) provides another lens to scrutinize the chal-
lenges for African American females who aspire to STEM
attainment. The hegemonic structure has adversely affected
their level of self-confidence. Teachers and institutions must
not use comparisons nor explanations that reduce the success
of varying social groups to hard work and persistence only.
Banks (2004) demonstrates that socio-cultural factors have
affected the self-efficacy of members of theAfricanAmerican
community.
From a CRT lens, the psychological and emotional persis-
tence that is needed by women of African descent is made
clear. Their struggle is not in acquiring the academic skills
alone but also in convincing others that they are worthy of an
opportunity to acquire such skills. Students of African
descent need to feel that those who are guiding their aca-
demic progress believe in them and have high expectations
of them (Cholewa, Amatea, West-Olatunji & Wright, 2012;
Tucker, Dixon, & Griddine, 2010; Wiggan, 2007). Fusia's
decision to defy her school counselor and pursue becoming a
doctor is evidence of this.
Yosso (2005) articulates six forms of cultural capital that
is used by people of color that is often not recognized.
Embedded in each step of the STEM Model, we find these.
Five of the six are highlighted. The first is Aspirational capi-
tal, which is the hopes and dreams for the future instilled by
the family. Each family communicated that they believed
and expected the women to succeed.
The second, Linguistic capital, is evident in that all the
women were bilingual and saw it as a benefit to have this
additional skill. Next was Familial capital, which was
observed as the importance of family inclusive of extended
family. Many of the women mentioned their grandparents
and other relatives being a support to them. Social capital is
the emotional support needed to navigate through the hege-
monic structures that exist. Finally, Resistant capital was
evidence by their ability to fight injustice. We see this through
Nubia and the police officer. Black immigrants are exposed
to similar incidences of injustice as Native Born Blacks and
must fight to challenge the systemic structure.
Conclusion
Too often, females in the United States are sent the message
that math and science are male fields of study. Females of
African descent are sent messages that math and science are
not attainable because of limited intelligence due to racial
constructs. Thus, there is an underrepresentation of women
of African descent in STEM.
However, the women in this study showed persistence
through STEM education to participate in a STEM career.
They drew on a collective identity that was not prescribed by
the dominant culture. Their identity formulation gave them
the needed ability to invalidate the racialized restrictions
imposed on their gender and race. The data supports the
importance of self-identification, values and strategies from
family, as well as community to build self-confidence. From
their narratives, all females ofAfrican descent can be encour-
aged in STEM education and careers.
The SAM Model served as a graphic organizational tool
that illustrated the resources needed by these women to navi-
gate the barriers of race and gender. Further research is
needed to verify if the SAM Model can support the access of
all females of African descent in their STEM attainment.
This study is limited in that it drew on a small purposive
sample of Afro Caribbean Hispanic women. However, it
does reveal evidence that identity formation developed from
the individuals' cultural group promotes self-confidence that
is needed to persist in STEM.
There is a shortage of STEM workers for U.S. companies
in general and a dire need to hire science and math teachers in
the 48 of 50 states (Westerlund, Radcliffe, Smith, Lemke, &
West, 2011). There is, therefore, an imperative to look at those
from underrepresented groups who have gained access to
STEM and draw from their toolbox to open access to others.
Parents, teachers, and community members are encouraged to
12 SAGE Open
acknowledge their important roles and responsibilities in sup-
porting females ofAfrican descent into STEM. These females,
much like my participants, represent a multitude of untapped
potential. In the voice of one of these women, ultimately, "we
are scientists, we are artists, we are creators" (Nubia).
