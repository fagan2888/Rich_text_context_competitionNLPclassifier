It is difficult to read a newspaper or magazine, watch television, or
surf the Internet without encountering a multitude of competing
messages about the health risks one faces. At best, the sheer volume
of risk information confuses some people ("which risk should I pay
attention to?"). More concerning, however, is that it may lead other
people to make unwise choices (eg, deciding that prostate cancer
screening is more important than stopping smoking) or to become
cynical about health risks in general ("why pay attention at all if
everything is so dangerous?").
The problem with risk information is that it is often incomplete
and provided without context. For example, a 2006 press release from
the Food and Drug Administration that announced the approval
of a cervical cancer vaccine stated that "there are 3,700 deaths
attributed to cervical cancer in the United States each year" (1),
and a disease advocacy group Web site that highlights the danger
of prostate cancer stated that "in 2007, more than 27000 men will
die from the disease" (2). Although both messages employed a
common communication tactic--using large numbers to capture

The Risk of Death by Age, Sex, and Smoking Status
in the United States: Putting Health Risks in Context
Steven Woloshin, Lisa M. Schwartz, H. Gilbert Welch
Background To make sense of the disease risks they face, people need basic facts about the magnitude of a particular
risk and how one risk compares with other risks. Unfortunately, this fundamental information is not read-
ily available to patients or physicians. We created simple one-page charts that present the 10-year chance
of dying from various causes according to age, sex, and smoking status.
Methods We used the National Center for Health Statistics Multiple Cause of Death Public Use File for 2004 and
data from the 2004 US Census to calculate age- and sex-specific death rates for various causes of death.
We then combined data on smoking prevalence (from the National Health Interview Survey) and the rela-
tive risks of death from various causes for smokers vs never smokers (from the American Cancer Society's
Cancer Prevention Study-II) to determine age-, sex-, and smoking-specific death rates. Finally, we accumu-
lated these risks for various starting ages in a series of 10-year life tables. The charts present the 10-year
risks of dying from heart disease; stroke; lung, colon, breast, cervical, ovarian, and prostate cancer; pneu-
monia; influenza; AIDS; chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; accidents; and all causes.
Results At all ages, the 10-year risk of death from all causes combined is higher for men than women. The effect
of smoking on the chance of dying is similar to the effect of adding 5 to 10 years of age: for example, a
55-year-old man who smokes has about the same 10-year risk of death from all causes as a 65-year-old
man who never smoked (ie, 178 vs 176 of 1000 men, respectively). For men who never smoked, heart dis-
ease death represents the single largest cause of death from age 50 on and the chance of dying from
heart disease exceeds the chances of dying from lung, colon, and prostate cancers combined at every age.
For men who currently smoke, the chance of dying from lung cancer is of the same order of magnitude
as the chance dying from heart disease and after age 50 it is about 10 times greater than the chance of
dying from prostate or colon cancer. For women who have never smoked, the magnitudes of the 10-year
risks of death from breast cancer and heart disease are similar until age 60; from this age on, heart disease
represents the single largest cause of death. For women who currently smoke, the chance of dying from
heart disease or lung cancer exceeds the chance of dying from breast cancer from age 40 on (and does so
by at least a factor of 5 after age 55).
Conclusion The availability of simple charts with consistent data presentations of important causes of death may
facilitate discussion about disease risk between physicians and their patients and help highlight the dan-
gers of smoking.

the reader's attention--neither provided a complete statement of
risk, that is, one that addresses the probability of dying from the
specific cancer over a defined time period. And neither message
put this risk in the context of other important health risks, such as
the risk of dying from heart disease or lung cancer (the risks of both
are substantially higher than those for cervical or prostate cancer).
The point of presenting these examples is not to minimize the
tragedies of cervical or prostate cancer deaths but rather to high-
light the importance of providing the information needed to make
risk messages useful.
Useful messages about health risks should address two ques-
tions: how big is my risk and how does this risk compare with other
risks? Approximately 5 years ago, we published a set of risk charts
that were intended to address both of these questions (3). The
charts presented estimates of an individual's chance of dying within
the next 10 years from a variety of causes according to his or her
age, sex, and smoking status--arguably the three characteristics
that have the most important influence on mortality. The charts
provided context by allowing people to compare their chances of
dying at different ages across disease categories and in the context
of all-cause mortality. These charts have been posted on the Web
site of a major association of primary care physicians for point-of-
care use by physicians (4), and they were published by a national
newspaper (which reported that the charts inspired an editor of a
major medical journal to quit smoking) (5). We now update these
charts with a revised algorithm that takes into account a valid
methodologic concern about our original calculations (6) and
incorporates the most recent national mortality data available.
Methods
Overview
Our goal was to create simple one-page charts that put disease risk
in context by placing the 10-year chance of dying from various
causes side by side. To account for the influence of sex, we created
separate charts for men and women. To account for the influence
of age on mortality, the charts provide separate estimates for 5-year
increments of age. To account for the influence of smoking, the
charts provide separate estimates for people who currently smoke,
people who used to smoke, and people who never smoked.
Chart Design
To make the charts easy to understand, we limited the amount of
data presented and paid particular attention to their format. The
charts present data on the 10-year chance of dying to provide a
reasonable window into the future; to avoid data overload and to
limit each chart to a single page, the charts present the starting age
in 5-year increments (ie, age 35 years, 40 years, 45 years, and so
on up to age 75 years) rather than every year of age. We repre-
sented the mortality data as counts with a stable denominator (eg,
3 in 1000, 10 in 1000) rather than as proportions or rates because
some evidence (7­10) suggests that this format is easiest to under-
stand. To further simplify the appearance of the charts, we
rounded the number of deaths to the nearest whole number and
shaded cells in which the death rate was less than 1 per 1000.
Finally, to help clarify the contribution of each individual cause of
death, the charts include the chance of dying from all causes
combined.
Selected Causes of Death
The risk charts include the most common causes of death (eg, heart
disease, lung cancer) as well as causes of death that have received
particular attention in the media (eg, AIDS, ovarian cancer). The
charts present 10 causes of death for men and 12 for women. Nine
of the causes of death apply to both sexes: heart disease, stroke, lung
cancer, colon cancer, pneumonia, flu, AIDS, chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease (COPD), and accidents. The sex-specific causes
are prostate cancer (for men) and breast, cervical, and ovarian can-
cer (for women).
We grouped individual causes of death into disease categories
using standard National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS)
groupings [ie, based on the list of the 358 most common causes
CONTEXT AND CAVEATS
Prior knowledge
The information that people receive about their risk of disease is
often incomplete because it does not address the probability of
dying from the specific disease over a defined time period, nor does
it put the risk into the context of other important health risks.
Study design
National census and health data for 2004 were used to create sim-
ple one-page charts that present the 10-year chance of dying,
according to age, sex, and smoking status, from heart disease;
stroke; lung, colon, breast, cervical, ovarian, and prostate cancer;
pneumonia; influenza; AIDS; chronic obstructive pulmonary dis-
ease; accidents; and all causes.
Contribution
At all ages, the 10-year risk of death from all causes combined is
higher for men than women. The effect of smoking on the chance
of dying is similar to the effect of adding 5 to 10 years of age. For
men who never smoked, heart disease death represents the single
largest cause of death from age 50 on. For men who currently
smoke, the chance of dying from lung cancer is of the same order
of magnitude as the chance of dying from heart disease from age
60 on, and after age 50, it is 10 times greater than the chance of
dying from prostate or colon cancer. For women who never
smoked, the 10-year risks of death from breast cancer and heart
disease are similar until age 60; from this age on, heart disease
represents the single largest cause of death. For women who cur-
rently smoke, the chance of dying from heart disease or lung cancer
exceeds the chance of dying from breast cancer from age 40 on.
Implications
The availability of simple charts with consistent data presentations
of important causes of death may facilitate discussion about dis-
ease risk between physicians and their patients and help highlight
the dangers of smoking.
Limitations
The mortality data that were used to calculate cause-specific death
rates were derived from death certificates and are only as good as the
death certificates. Relative risks of death from various causes were
from the American Cancer Society's Cancer Prevention Study-II, which
represent a single--albeit very large--cohort study. Risk estimates
were not personalized beyond age, sex, and smoking status.
jnci.oxfordjournals.org JNCI | Articles 847
of death (11); see Appendix 1]. Our only departure from the
NCHS groupings was the creation of the category "heart dis-
ease," which includes deaths from acute and chronic ischemic
heart disease and associated complications (eg, congestive heart
failure and arrhythmia); the heart disease category does not
include other heart disease deaths (eg, endocarditis, valvular dis-
ease, and pericarditis).
Data Sources and Calculations
Figure 1 summarizes our data sources and the four calculation steps
we used to produce the risk charts.
Step 1: Calculate Age-, Sex-, and Cause-Specific Death
Rates. We calculated death rates for each sex, for each year of life
(from age 35 through age 84), for all causes combined, and for each
selected cause (ie, more than 1200 age-, sex-, and cause-specific
rates). These age-, sex-, and cause-specific annual death rates for
2004 were calculated using the following equation:
Age-, sex-, cause-specific death rate
= Deaths
TOTAL
/N
TOTAL
= Age- and sex-specific number of deaths from cause X in 2004/
Age- and sex-specific population in 2004.
We used the NCHS Multiple Cause of Death Public Use File for
2004 to obtain the numerator, that is, the number of deaths from
each selected cause (and from all causes combined) among indi-
viduals of a specific age and sex (12). The file contains informa-
tion on all deaths in the United States and is based on death
certificates completed by each state [all states require the report-
ing of all deaths, and it is believed that more than 99% of all
deaths in the United States are registered by the states (13)]. A
death certificate may list multiple causes of death; these causes
are translated at NCHS into codes that are enumerated in the
International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (available at
http://www.who.int/classifications/icd/en/). A computer pro-
gram at NCHS assigns the underlying cause of death from the
multiple causes listed on each certificate. The risk charts are
based on the underlying cause of death. We used data from the
2004 US Census to obtain the denominator, that is, the esti-
mated midyear ( July 1, 2004) US resident population for each
year of age and sex (14).
Step 2: Determine Age-, Sex-, and Cause-Specific Death Rates
for Never Smokers. The most challenging task of our analysis
was to apportion these death rates according to smoking status. As
recommended by Bach and Schrag (6), we modified our original
approach for estimating risks by considering current smokers, for-
mer smokers, and never smokers as distinct groups. We reasoned
that each age-, sex-, and cause-specific death rate is the weighted
average of the age-, sex-, and cause-specific death rates for never
smokers (NS), former smokers (FS), and current smokers (CS),
where the weights reflect the proportion of the population in each
group:
Age-, sex-, cause-specific death rate
= (% NS × rate
NS
) + (% FS × rate
FS
) + (% CS × rate
CS
).
The death rates in the two smoking groups--that is, current smok-
ers and former smokers--were derived by multiplying the never
smokers death rate by the relative risks (RRs) associated with for-
mer (RR
FS/NS
) and current (RR
CS/NS
):
Age-, sex-, cause-specific death rate
= (% NS × rate
NS
) + % FS × (rate
NS
× RR
FS/NS
) + % CS × (rate
NS
×
RR
CS/NS
).
Figure 1. Data sources and steps used to create the risk charts.
848 Articles | JNCI Vol. 100, Issue 12 | June 18, 2008
We then used an algebraic transformation (see Appendix 2) to solve
the following equation for the age-, sex-, and cause-specific death
rates in never smokers:
Age-, sex-, cause-specific death rate
NS
= Deaths
TOTAL
/{N
TOTAL
× [% NS + (% FS x RR
FS./NS
) + (% CS x
RR
CS./NS
)]}.
To solve this equation, we needed to know the prevalence of smok-
ing and the relative risk of death according to smoking status. We
obtained the prevalence of smoking by sex and age (age categories:
18­24, 25­44, 45­64, 65­74, and 75 years) from the National
Health Interview Survey, 2002­2004 (15). We used the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention's definitions of smoking status
(16): never smokers are people who have smoked fewer than 100
cigarettes in their lifetime, former smokers are people who do not
smoke now but smoked at least 100 cigarettes in the past, and cur-
rent smokers are people who smoke now and have smoked at least
100 cigarettes in their lifetime.
The second input for the calculation was the relative risk of death
according to smoking status. We sought sex-specific relative risks of
death for former and current smokers (vs never smokers) dying
from diseases with well-established associations with smoking (heart
disease, stroke, COPD, lung cancer, pneumonia, and influenza) and
from all causes combined. These were obtained from the American
Cancer Society's Cancer Prevention Study II (CPS-II), a prospective
cohort study of more than 1.2 million US adults aged 30 years or older
that began in 1982 (17). Because these relative risks were provided for
only very broad age categories, we requested and obtained further
refined, age-specific relative risks (in 5-year age categories beginning
at age 35) from CPS-II (M. Thun, MD, personal communication).
Step 3: Calculate Age-, Sex-, and Cause-Specific Death Rates
for Former and Current Smokers. We calculated age-specific
annual death rates for former smokers by multiplying the age-spe-
cific risk for never smokers by the relative risk of death for former
vs never smokers. Similarly, we calculated age-specific annual
death rates for current smokers using the relative risk of death for
current vs never smokers.
Step 4: Accumulate the 10-Year Risks of Death for Each Cause
for Age-, Sex-, and Smoking-Specific Groups. We used previ-
ously described methods (18) to create separate 10-year life tables
for each specific cause of death and all causes combined for male
and female never, former, and current smokers in each of the nine
age categories, for a total of 648 life tables (ie, each of the 648
numbers displayed in the four charts reflect a unique life table).
For each year of age, we multiplied the number of people who
were alive at the beginning of the age interval by the disease-spe-
cific death rate to obtain the number of disease-specific deaths.
Likewise, we calculated the number of deaths from all causes in the
age interval by using the all-cause death rates. We subtracted
deaths from all causes from the number of people who were alive
at the beginning of the interval to obtain the number of people
alive at the beginning of the next age interval. We then summed
the number of deaths over 10 years to obtain the 10-year probabil-
ity of death for each age in the risk chart:
Cause-specific 10-year risk of death
age-, sex-, smoking-specific group
= [
i=1
10
å (Alive
i-1
­ All Death
i-1
) × Disease death rate
i
] / Starting popu-
lation (100000).
For example, we applied the all-cause death rate for a 70-year-old
man who never smoked to calculate the total number of deaths
after 1 year in a cohort of 100000 men aged 70 years (ie, 1990
deaths). We then subtracted this number from 100000 to obtain
the number of survivors (ie, of the original 100000 men aged 70
years, how many reached age 71). These 98010 survivors made up
the population at risk for death in the subsequent year. We then
applied the all-cause death rate calculated for 71-year-old men to
determine the number of deaths over the next year and repeated
the process through the 10th year. In this way, we defined the
population at risk for death at the beginning of each of 10 years.
We then applied the age-specific death rate for each individual
cause of death to the population at risk at the beginning of each
year to get the number of disease-specific deaths. We obtained the
10-year chance of dying from each cause by adding the number of
deaths in each of the 10 years divided by the starting population
(100000). For simplicity, we express this risk as per 1000. (A com-
pleted example for a current smoker's risk of lung cancer death and
death from all causes combined is shown in Appendix 2.)
Sensitivity Analysis
The relative risks from CPS-II have been criticized--most notably
by the tobacco industry--because they were not adjusted for
potentially confounding socioeconomic characteristics. In res-
ponse to these criticisms, Thun et al. (19) pointed out that CPS-II
participants, regardless of their smoking history, were fairly homo-
geneous, and they showed that adjusting for behavioral and other
demographic factors only minimally attenuated the relative risks
for smoking. To avoid overestimating the association between
smoking and death, we "adjusted" our age-specific relative risks by
applying the average attenuation effect noted in the Thun et al.
(19) analysis (on average, the association between current smoking
and the various causes of mortality was reduced by 10%, eg, from
relative risk of 2.0 to a relative risk of 1.8). We assessed the effect
of even greater adjustment (to allow for the possibility of substan-
tial residual confounding) by conducting a sensitivity analysis.
Results
Risk Charts for Men
Figure 2 is the risk chart for men who have never smoked and men
who currently smoke. In each age category, the top row shows risks
for never smokers and the bottom row shows risks for current smok-
ers. For men who have never smoked, accidents are the single largest
cause of death until age 45, at which age accidents tie with heart dis-
ease as the largest cause of death; from age 50 on, the single largest
cause of death is heart disease. Within each age group of never smok-
ers, the chances of dying in the next 10 years from lung, colon, and
prostate cancer are of a similar order of magnitude until about age 70
and do not exceed that for accidental deaths until after age 65.
For men who currently smoke, the chance of dying from heart
disease exceeds the chance of dying from each of the other causes
until age 60, when it is surpassed by the chance of dying from lung

cancer. After age 50, the chance of dying from lung cancer exceeds
the chance of dying from colon or prostate cancer by a factor of
about 10. The chance of dying in the next 10 years from COPD is
similar to the combined chances of dying from colon and prostate
cancer until age 50 but then increases precipitously; by age 70, cur-
rent smokers have a 45 in 1000 chance of dying from COPD in the
next 10 years--more than twice the combined chance of dying
from colon and prostate cancer. The effect of smoking on the
chance of dying is similar to the effect of adding 10 years of age: for
example, a 55-year-old man who smokes has about the same 10-
year risk of death from all causes as a 65-year-old man who never
smoked (ie, 178 vs 176 of 1000 men will die in the next 10 years).
The large increase in the chance of dying from all causes at
older ages among smokers makes it appear that smoking lowers
the risk of death for conditions that have no known relationship
to cigarette smoking (ie, those for which the relative risk of
death for current smokers vs never smokers is 1). For example,
the 10-year chance of dying from prostate cancer--a disease
that is not associated with cigarette smoking--is higher for a
75-year-old man who never smoked than for one who currently
smokes (ie, 19 vs 15 of 1000 men will die in the next 10 years).
This finding should not be interpreted as suggesting that smok-
ing protects against prostate cancer or other causes of death in
which the same phenomenon occurs (ie, colon cancer or acci-
dents); instead, it simply reflects the impact of smoking on
competing risks of death (20). That is, as more current smokers
die from smoking-related diseases, fewer current smokers
remain who could die of non­smoking-related causes.
Figure 3 is the risk chart for men who are former smokers. For
causes of death related to smoking, risks of death for former smok-
ers are intermediate between those of current smokers and those
of never smokers.
Risk Charts for Women
Figure 4 displays the risk chart for women who have never smoked
and women who currently smoke. At all ages, the chance of dying
from all causes combined is lower for women than men with the
same smoking status. For women who have never smoked, the
magnitudes of the 10-year risks of death from breast cancer and
heart disease are similar until age 60; from this age on, heart disease
represents the single largest cause of death. Breast cancer is the
leading cause of cancer death throughout the lifetimes of women
who never smoked.
For women who currently smoke, the chance of dying
from heart disease or lung cancer exceeds the chance of dying from
breast cancer from age 40 on (and does so by at least a factor of 5
after age 55). By age 50, the chance of dying from lung cancer
exceeds the chance of dying from heart disease (14 vs 13 of 1000
women will die in the next 10 years). The effect of smoking on the
chance of dying is similar to the effect of adding 5 to 10 years of
age: the 10-year chance of dying from all causes combined for a
55-year-old woman who smokes is somewhere between that of a
60-year-old woman who never smoked and a 65-year-old woman
who never smoked (110 vs 84 and 131 of 1000 women, respec-
tively, will die in the next 10 years).
The spurious "protective" effect of smoking at older ages that
is present in men is also present in women but is less dramatic.
Because of large competing risks of death from smoking-related
diseases at age 65 or older, women who smoke generally appear to
have a slightly lower chance of dying from breast, colon, or ovarian
cancer than women who have never smoked, despite the lack of
any known associations between smoking and these cancers.
Figure 5 is the risk chart for women who are former smokers.
For causes of death related to smoking, risks of death for former
smokers are intermediate between those of current smokers and
those of never smokers.
Sensitivity Analysis
In analyses to address potential confounding of the smoking-
associated relative risks from CPS-II by socioeconomic status, we
found that reducing the relative risks by as much as 25% (eg, from
2.0 to 1.5) had little effect on our results. On average, the calculated
10-year chance of death was reduced by less than 10% for both men
and women smokers.
Discussion
We created simple charts with age-, sex-, and smoking-specific
data about the chance of dying from various common causes in the
next 10 years. The charts are designed to put the chance of dying
from a given disease in the context of the chances of dying from
other diseases and of dying from all causes. The current risk charts
represent a substantial improvement over the risk charts that we
previously published (3). The new risk charts use more recent data
and age-specific relative risks and employ a different method to
account for smoking status (the earlier method combined former
and never smokers, which distorted some risks; the new algorithm
treats never, former, and current smokers as separate groups).
We want to acknowledge three methodologic limitations of the
charts. First, cause-specific death rates require accurate attribution
of death. Although we used the 2004 Multiple Cause of Death
Public Use File from the NCHS, the best available (and most
recent) national source of mortality data, these data are derived from
death certificates. Death certificates are not always accurate nor is
the determination of the underlying cause of death (13). Nonetheless,
death certificates are the standard source of mortality data in the
United States (21). Second, our charts depend on the accuracy of the
relative risks from CPS-II. Concerns have been raised about residual
confounding by socioeconomic factors (19). However, our sensitiv-
ity analyses showed that reducing these relative risks by as much as
25% (ie, moving the relative risks toward 1) had only a small effect
on the chance of death. Moreover, the CPS-II relative risks are the
inputs used by the Centers for Disease Control (22) and the US
Surgeon General (16) to estimate "smoking attributable deaths."
Third, we did not attempt to provide more personalized risk
estimates. More personalized estimates, that is, estimates that
account for important disease risk factors, such as a strong family
history of a certain disease or various behaviors or exposures,
would be useful if they generated reliable predictions (23).
However, good mortality-specific risk prediction models are not
available for most diseases [lung cancer mortality being a notable
exception (24)]. Furthermore, personalized estimates add practical
complexities to implementation. For example, personalized

+ %FS × rate
FS
+ %CS × rate
CS
Because our goal is to solve for rate
NS
, it is necessary to express rate
FS
and rate
CS
in terms of rate
NS
. This is possible because the terms are related through the
relative risks:
RR
FS/NS
= rate
FS
/rate
NS
; so the rate
FS
= rate
NS
× RR
FS/NS
; and
RR
CS/NS
= rate
CS
/rate
NS
; so the rate
CS
= rate
NS
× RR
CS/NS
Substituting these terms into the original equation:
Deaths
TOTAL
/N
TOTAL
= %NS × rate
NS
+ %FS × (rate
NS
× RR
FS/NS
) + %CS ×
(rate
NS
× RR
CS/NS
)
Rearranging the terms:
Deaths
TOTAL
= rate
NS
(%NS + (%FS × RR
FS/NS
) + (%CS × RR
CS/NS
)) × N
TOTAL
Then solving for the rate
NS
:
rate
NS
= Deaths
TOTAL
/{N
TOTAL
× [(%NS + (%FS × RR
FS/NS
) + (%CS × RR
CS/NS
)]}
Substituting values for 70-year-old men, the lung cancer death rate for never
smokers is
rate
NS
= 2867/[788. 967 × (33.6% + 53.5% × 7.62 + 12.9% × 23.41)]
= 0.000489.
Calculate the age-, sex-, and cause-specific death rate for 70-year-old men
who currently smoke. This is done by rearranging the terms in the relative risk
formula:
RR
CS/NS
= rate
CS
/rate
NS
; rate
CS
= RR
CS/NS
× rate
NS
.
Substituting values for lung cancer among 70-year-old men:
rate
CS
= 23.41 × 0.000489 = 0.01145.
Accumulate 10-year risk of death for age-, sex-, and cause-specific groups
using life tables. Here is the life table for 70-year-old men who currently smoke
(to get former smokers, repeat step 3, but use relative risk for former smokers vs
never smokers).
estimates would probably require a computer interface that allows
users to enter the requisite information; alternatively, users would
have to navigate multiple complex tables to find the right esti-
mates. In fact, we believe that the simplicity of our charts represents
a distinct advantage over interactive computer applications: the
charts are inexpensive, can be used anywhere, and require no spe-
cial hardware or trained personnel. Moreover, our charts account
for what are arguably the three most important risk factors for
death: age, sex, and smoking.
The risk charts provide two basic elements that people need if
they are to make sense of the health threats they face: the magni-
tude of the risk and some context. We hope that the availability of
these simple charts will facilitate physician­patient discussion
about disease risk and help people understand where to focus risk
reduction efforts. The charts are posted electronically in a variety
of formats (ie, as presented in this paper, as separate charts for
each smoking category, and as single-page charts presenting all
the data in one place for men and women; see Supplementary
Figures 1­10, available online). We encourage physicians (and
others) to post the charts in clinic offices or distribute them to
patients for easy reference when decisions (such as cancer screen-
ing) are being made.
Finally, the charts provide a compelling demonstration of the
harms of cigarette smoking--the effect of smoking on mortality
risk is like adding 5 to 10 years of age. After publication of the first
set of charts, we received many messages from patients, providers,
and colleagues suggesting that the charts may be especially useful
in smoking prevention and cessation efforts. Regardless of how the
charts are used, we believe that they will provide a much-needed
perspective on health risks.
