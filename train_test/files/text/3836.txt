Introduction
Decades ago, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of
Mental Disorders (3rd ed.; DSM-III; American Psychiatric
Association [APA], 1980) was developed to standardize
diagnoses of mental disorders, improve reliability between
clinicians, and facilitate research across situations and psy-
chopathologies (Horwitz, 2002). Although DSM-III was an
improvement over preceding editions, the effort to standard-
ize diagnoses was less successful than hoped. The DSM-III,
DSM-IV (4th ed, APA, 1994), including multiple revisions,
and the recently released DSM-V describe categories of
symptom clusters; however, not all patients within a symp-
tom-cluster share similar underlying pathophysiology
(Feighner et al., 1972; Guze, 1989; Möller, 2009).
Furthermore, diagnoses have remained somewhat unreliable
across locations, theoretical perspectives, and the era in
which diagnosing is taking place (Aboraya, 2007).
Patients sometimes do not "fit" in a clear diagnostic cat-
egory because they fail to demonstrate enough of the required
criteria. In addition, mental disorders overlap with one
another, with the same criterion found in different disorders.
For example, anxiety is present across many diagnostic cat-
egories, although it may differ in intensity and manifestation.
People with mental illnesses often exhibit criteria from mul-
tiple disorders, leading to diagnostic confusion. These limi-
tations have made it difficult to diagnose in accord with the
specific illnesses in the DSM model.

Questionnaire (NAQ)

Abstract
In this study, 901 participants completed an anonymous Internet-based survey, including a new instrument, the
Neurotransmitter Attributes Questionnaire (NAQ), indicating possible dysfunction of the serotonergic or dopaminergic
circuits. NAQ items were derived from questions prescribing professionals commonly ask new patients whose symptoms
call for psychopharmacological treatments, sometimes in combination with psychosocial interventions. Rasch modeling was
used to establish item quality, subscale reliability, and unidimensionality. In addition, the items in each subscale were found
reliable when judged by three blind raters who were experienced psychopharmacologists. Standard measures of mental
disorders and self-reported diagnoses were used to validate the NAQ subscales. These questions that form the subscales
on the NAQ may be helpful when determining the class of medication likely to be most effective. Variations in mood and
anxiety-disordered patients call for a case-specific approach to pharmacological treatment. Some patients are best helped by
serotonergic agonists, others have a better outcome from treatment with dopaminergic agonists, and some patients seem
to be best served by a combination of both. The NAQ was designed to aid decision-making early in treatment, potentially
leading to greater compliance and better outcome. The NAQ may be used to standardize protocols in outcome research,
and in addition, it may provide a new perspective on personality studies.

disorders. Dimensional models highlight continuity between
psychological disorders and highly prevalent, adaptive, bio-
logically based temperament and personality factors. Here,
behavioral, mood, and personality disorders are conceptual-
ized as spectrum disorders defined within multidimensional
frameworks. Among more influential approaches in this tradi-
tion are Eysenck's PEN (psychoticism, extraversion, and neu-
roticism) perspective (1990), Cloninger's biosocial model of
personality (Cloninger, Bayon, & Svrakic, 1998; Cloninger &
Svrakic, 1997), K. K. Akiskal and Akiskal's (2005) theory of
affective temperaments, and various models emphasizing con-
tinuity between psychopathology and the Big Five personality
factors (Nigg, John, Blaskey, Huang-Pollock, Willcutt,
Hinshaw, & Pennington, 2002; Widiger& Frances, 1994).
Akiskal and colleagues (Lara & Akiskal, 2006; Lara,
Pinto, Akiskal, & Akiskal, 2006) recently developed an inte-
grative, bi-dimensional theory of temperament with implica-
tions for the assessment and treatment of psychological
disorders. This model incorporates neurobiological evidence
for serotonergic and dopaminergic systems underlying nor-
mal affective traits and their symptomatic exaggerations in
mood and personality disorders.
In this bi-dimensional model, the fundamental human
affective systems are posited to relate to fear and anger, evo-
lutionary adaptations to the ubiquitous demands of detecting
and responding to danger and environmental challenges.
Broadly speaking, the fear system regulates the inhibition of
behavior, while the anger system promotes the initiation of
behavior. Each system is responsible for a set of transient
emotional states and enduring temperamental traits. Fear
traits relate to harm avoidance, with high fear reflected in
cautiousness, pessimism, need for security, and low energy.
Persons low in fear exhibit optimism, confidence, high
energy, low perception of danger cues, and reckless risk-
taking. Lara and Akiskal (2006) provide evidence that fear
traits are linked primarily to amygdala functioning (with sec-
ondary involvement of other limbic and precortical and
paralimbic structures) and to serotonergic systems (as well
as gamma-aminobutyric acid [GABA] and noradrenergic
systems).
In contrast, anger relates to traits such as appetitive moti-
vation, with high anger associated with novelty- and
stimulation-seeking, impulsivity, extravagance, and domi-
nance. Low anger is associated with apathy, passivity, sub-
missiveness, and low appetitive and exploratory motivation.
Lara and Akiskal (2006) identify the nucleus acumbens as
the primary neuroanatomical structure involved in the regu-
lation of anger traits, with prefrontal cortical structures play-
ing secondary roles. Although the neurochemistry of anger is
complex, the authors describe dopaminergic circuits involved
in anger regulation. This model is reminiscent of Gray's the-
ory of Behavioral Inhibition Systems (BIS) and Behavioral
Activation Systems (BAS), derived from research in animal
learning and motivation (Gray, 1982, 1991). Dopaminergic
and serotonergic circuits may play important roles in the
BAS and BIS, respectively (Depue & Iacono, 1989).
Fear and anger traits, as conceptualized by Akiskal and
colleagues (Lara & Akiskal, 2006; Lara, Pinto, Akiskal, &
Akiskal, 2006), are orthogonal dimensions, with high and
low fear and anger co-occurring in combination. Many psy-
chological disorders are located within this two-dimensional
framework, with disorders identified by extremes on at least
one dimension. Bipolar disorders are characterized by eleva-
tion on anger- and fear-related traits. Without the modulation
by high fear, an individual with high anger is prone to manic
and hypomanic states, with less frequent depressive epi-
sodes. Major depression is associated with high fear charac-
teristics and low anger; with higher fear traits, depression
merges into the anxiety disorders. According to this model,
ADHD may be located at low levels on the fear and anger
dimensions. However, the frequent comorbidity of ADHD
with anxiety, oppositional, and other disorders makes this
hypothesis difficult to assess (Biederman, Faraone, & Lapey,
1992; Cantwell, 1996; Jensen et al., 2001). Akiskal's
bi-dimensional model is similar to the perspective adopted
in the NAQ (Neurotransmitter Attributes Questionnaire)
reported in the present study.
A Dimensional Perspective in Clinical Practice
Most frustrating to clinicians is the failure of diagnostic
categories to point the way to effective treatments. Despite
hopes for standard psychopharmacological treatment,
Trivedi, Rush, et al. (2006) report the results of the
STAR*D, a massive multisite study designed to assess the
outcome of a standard psychopharmacological treatment
for depression. Depressed patients were treated with cital-
opram (Celexa), a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor
(SSRI) often used as a first-line agent. Results demon-
strated that only 28% of the patients achieved remission
and only 47% responded to an adequate trial of citalopram,
underlining the finding that many depressed patients fail to
respond to common first-line agents; more than half
showed no response, and more than two thirds failed to
achieve remission. The utility of being able to identify
which patients will respond to a given antidepressant agent
before beginning treatment is evident. The low remission
rate in the face of treatment with adequate serotonin reup-
take inhibition agonists suggests that other neurobiological
systems play a role in some or even many cases of depres-
sion and associated symptoms such as anxiety. While
agents most commonly used in first-line treatment of
depression rely on the selective blockade of serotonin
receptors, Nutt (2006) pointed to evidence linking dopa-
mine and norepinephrine in depression and the role of
dopamine in treatment. Primary dysfunctions of the dopa-
mine circuits may account for subtypes of depression not
effectively treated by serotonergic agents (Dunlop &
Nemeroff, 2007; Nutt et al., 2006).
Driven by the need to match specific patients to effective
treatments, many clinicians are moving away from the
symptom-cluster orientation of DSM-IV, which fails to
O'Connor et al. 3
identify effective treatment agents. Instead, clinicians are
attempting to correlate specific clinical data with underlying
pathophysiology, natural history, patterns of unique correlates,
and treatment response, to arrive at treatment approaches
designed to match hypothesized abnormalities in individual
neural circuits and neurotransmitter systems (Stahl, 2000).
This approach takes into account not only the patient's symp-
toms, but also pre-morbid personality traits and past history
of response to different pharmacological agents in an attempt
to identify dysfunction in specific neurotransmitter systems
that might be redressed with pharmacological intervention.
A medication trial may be viewed as a "probe" of a patient's
individually constituted nervous system; such trials can
therefore be diagnostic as well as therapeutic. We refer to
this model as "circuits based," in contrast to the DSM
approach, the "symptom cluster" model.
The disappointing results of outcome studies encouraged
us to reconsider the neurobiological systems responsible for
dysfunctions and to tailor treatments with a patient-specific
method (Trivedi, Fava, et al., 2006). Experienced clinicians
develop an implicit method of diagnosing and determining
optimal treatment after observing multiple patients' person-
ality traits and their reactions to medications, using "clinical
intuition." However, this necessitates knowledge and under-
standing of psychopharmacology and in some settings, prac-
titioners may lack the background or relevant experience in
psychopharmacology. Some treatment providers have not
been trained to think of biological considerations linking
treatment to personality factors associated with psychopa-
thology or sustained problems in living. In addition, while
primary care physicians are among the most frequent pre-
scribers of antidepressant medications in the United States,
they often miss the diagnosis of major depressive disorder
(Coyne, Fechner-Bates, & Schwenk, 1994). Thus, there is a
need for a secondary, systematized means by which to link
personality traits and clinical data to treatment approaches
that might help physicians make informed choices between
different types of antidepressant agents and psychosocial
approaches. Such a method might also help direct the course
of nonpharmacological treatment by making more explicit
the nature of the illness.
A patient-specific method may ultimately include a vari-
ety of nonpharmacological treatments such as therapist-
designed cognitive and behavioral treatment (CBT), self- or
computer-administered CBT, telephone counseling, or
graded programs of exercise (Tylee, 2006). Because little
data exist regarding the effects of psychosocial treatments on
specific neurotransmitter circuits, there are no established
protocols linking nonmedication treatments with either sero-
tonergic or dopaminergic system-based symptoms. Several
exceptions to this include the efficacy of Exposure and
Response Prevention (ERP) in the treatment of obsessive-
compulsive disorder (OCD), and CBT in the treatment of
depression. In these, there have been studies comparing ERP
and CBT with pharmacological treatment. In some studies
psychosocial treatments appear more effective alone, in oth-
ers, a combination of medication and psychosocial treat-
ments lead to better outcome (Menchetti et al., 2010). Recent
outcome data on ERP for OCD are not always so optimistic,
and the lack of case specificity in medication practices
has lead to a pervasive weakness in clinical trial studies
(Furukawa et al., 2011). In each study comparing psycho-
pharmacological with psychological treatments, all patients
are given the same in class of pharmacological agent, with-
out taking into account whether a given patient might be
more responsive to a serotonergic or dopaminergic agonist.
Every patient in the comparative studies receives the same
type of medicine. Therefore, outcome must necessarily be
lower for medication treatments than it might be if patients
were treated with the medication most appropriate, in a case-
specific manner.
In longer-term studies, the learning process that takes
place in CBT appears to promote a greater reduction in
symptoms over time than medication without behavioral
treatment. However, for many, medications are helpful in
jump-starting treatment, offering patients enough hope to
begin the work of a CBT (Baxter et al., 1992; Conte, Plutchik,
Wild, & Karasu, 1986). Clinicians working with a circuits-
based model might consider patients' presenting symptoms
as representing "dysfunctional" dopaminergic or serotonin-
ergic systems, while viewing neurotransmitters as function-
ing in nonlinear, complex, adaptive systems in continuous
interactions. A dopamine agonist may be most helpful for a
symptom suggestive of low dopaminergic tone, such as dis-
tractibility or decreased motivation. A serotoninergic agonist
might better address a symptom suggestive low serotonergic
tone, such as anxiety proneness or chronic sadness. In clini-
cal contexts in which patients manifest relatively nonspecific
symptoms of depression but have evidenced lifelong person-
ality traits suggestive of, for example, low dopaminergic
tone, clinicians may find dopaminergic agonists preferable,
although serotonin circuits may secondarily be involved in a
patient's presentation, and treatment may be most successful
when using serotonergic and dopaminergic agonists. Beyond
consideration of psychopathology, normal personality traits
and individual differences may be investigated and charac-
terized by this model and fit into a broader evolutionary per-
spective (H. S. Akiskal, 1998; Cloninger, 2002; DeBattista,
Solvason, Poirier, Kendrick, & Schatzberg, 2003; O'Connor,
Berry, Weiss, & Gilbert, 2002).
Present Study
Currently there is a lack of effective measures to aid case-
specific approaches to pharmacological treatment that take
into account the individual differences in personality traits
often informing decision making by experienced psycho-
pharmacologists. This study was designed to evaluate a new
measure, the NAQ, based on a "circuits" model of psycho-
pathology, extended to include common psychological
4 SAGE Open
problems and individual differences in personality traits. The
NAQ was developed with an eye to potential clinical appli-
cations, making explicit an implicit process for experienced
prescribing providers. The items capture informal criteria
used by seasoned specialists intuitively, in determining opti-
mal treatment. NAQ items are related to behavioral, affec-
tive, and cognitive traits on which people show individual
differences, and for which extreme elevations on clusters of
traits (related to either serotonergic or dopaminergic influ-
ence) might be associated with distress, psychological prob-
lems, or ongoing difficulties in living. Each of the two NAQ
subscales, the D-scale (dopaminergic) and S-scale (seroto-
nergic), thus comprise these traits made explicit. While ele-
vations on each classification of traits may not always be
associated with specific diagnoses, they commonly represent
clusters of traits noted in patients successfully treated with
dopamine agonists such as bupropion (Wellbutrin), methyl-
phenidate (Ritalin), and others, or with serotonin agonists
such as floxetine (Prozac), citalopram (Celexa), or escitalo-
pram (Lexapro). This study examines the psychometric
properties of the NAQ items and subscales, including their
reliability and validity in distinguishing differences between
patients who may have the same diagnosis but need different
treatments. In addition, we examine the relationship between
the NAQ subscales and normal and abnormal personality
characteristics.
Method
Participants.This online study included 901 participants
(76.5% women, 23.4% men) solicited through notices, word
of mouth, or through emails posted on academic and other
listservs, as well as advertisements in the "Volunteer" sec-
tion of the online craigslist in a variety of cities in the United
States. Participants were invited to our lab's (Emotion, Per-
sonality, & Altruism Research Group) web page (http://
www.eparg.org) to the study "Emotions and Personality."
Participation was anonymous. Participants' ages ranged
from 18 to 84 years, with the mean at 34.4 (SD = 12.1). The
majority (about 89%) were from the United States. About
80% were of European decent, 4.2% were Asian/Asian
American, 2.1% were Latin/Latin American, and 1.8% African/
African American. Education varied from high school or less
(5.3%) to doctoral or law degrees (16.1%). In all, 4% had
attained an associates degree, 18.8% a bachelors degree, and
18.1% a masters degree. An additional 20% had some under-
graduate education and 13.5% some graduate education. A
total of 1% did not disclose their education level, and 2.3%
indicated other educational achievements. Participants also
indicated history of psychiatric diagnoses and current medi-
cations (see Tables 1 and 2).
Instruments. A variety of instruments were used to assess the
validity of the two subscales of the NAQ (O'Connor, Lewis,
Berry, Yi, & Crisostomo, 2005) including measures of
psychopathology known to be associated with either low
dopaminergic tone (i.e., often treated with a dopamine ago-
nist) or low serotoninergic tone (i.e., often treated with a
serotonin agonist). We also included measures of the Big
Five personality factors, as a beginning exploration of per-
sonality dimensions from the perspective of the circuit model
of neurotransmitters.
The NAQ is a 46-item questionnaire with responses indi-
cated on a Likert-type scale of 1 to 5. The instrument was
derived from a list of questions generated by a psychiatrist,
specializing in psychopharmacology, which he typically
asks before determining what medication(s) might be most
effective, and to evaluate response to treatment. Item content
validity was subsequently assessed by other practicing psy-
chiatrists. The NAQ was piloted in a study at a major research
university, and then revised for clarity and reliability. The
S-scale consists of 27 items, derived from the low-serotonin
questions, and the D-scale consists of 19 items from the low-
dopamine questions. Procedures for generating items, evalu-
ating content validity, and assessing the psychometric
functioning of item and scale characteristics are described in
detail below.
The Interpersonal Guilt Questionnaire-67 (IGQ-67;
O'Connor, Berry, Weiss, Bush, & Sampson, 1997) is a
67-item, self-report questionnaire, with responses indicated
on a Likert-type scale ranging from 1 to 5. The IGQ-67 was

designed to assess guilt related to the fear of harming others,
and includes four subscales: Survivor Guilt, Separation
Guilt, Omnipotent Responsibility Guilt, and Self-Hate.
Reliabilities of all subscales ranged from .75 to .88. The
IGQ-67 subscales are significantly correlated with psycho-
pathology across cultures; the two subscales most signifi-
cantly associated with psychopathology, Survivor Guilt, and
Omnipotent Responsibility Guilt, were included in this
study. Survivor guilt is characterized by the belief that pursu-
ing normal goals and achieving happiness or well-being will
cause others, loved ones and strangers, to suffer. Omnipotent
responsibility guilt is characterized by the belief that one has
omnipotent responsibility for the happiness and well-being
of others.
The Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale
(CESD; Radloff, 1977) is a widely used 20-item self-report
instrument, with responses on a Likert-type scale, ranging
from 0 to 3, and total scores ranging from 0 to 60. The cut-off
score for depression is equal to or greater than 16, which
indicates at least a mild depression, although many clinicians
mark a mild depression starting well below 16.
Generalized Anxious Temperament (GAT; H. S. Akiskal,
1998) is a 26-item instrument with responses indicated on a
Likert-type scale from 1 to 5. Participants are asked to
describe themselves "through most of your life." Along with
a total GAT score, there are two subscales, the GAT-Self,
with items related to self-worry, and the GAT-Other, with
items reflecting worry about others. Theoretically, the GAT
was developed by placing anxious, worrying, temperaments
in the context of evolutionary adaptations, in which members
of the population who are high in this trait are those on the
outlook for danger not only for themselves, but for the good
of their families and groups.
The Jasper-Goldberg Adult ADD Screening Examination
is a 24-item screening device, rated on a Likert-type scale
from 0 (not at all) to 5 (very much), indicating how they have
felt "most of your adult life." Scoring 70 or above is consid-
ered suggestive of an attention deficit disorder (ADD) diag-
nosis. Most people who score at this level have been
eventually diagnosed with ADD although other psychiatric
problem such as bipolar disorder may be present and account
for the high score.
The Obsessive Compulsive Inventory-R is derived from
the Obsessive-Compulsive Symptoms Scale from the
International Personality Item Pool (Foa, Kozak, Salkovskis,
Coles, & Amir, 1998). This 20-item self-report instrument
assesses perfectionism, intrusive thoughts, and the need for
order and cleanliness.
Brief Big Five Inventory (BFI; John, 1990) is a 44-item
self-report inventory for assessing five personality traits:
openness to experience, conscientiousness, extraversion,
agreeableness, and neuroticism.
Procedure. Participants volunteered anonymously, indicating
informed consent by clicking an appropriate button, before
proceeding. Data entered our server through FileMaker Pro,
was transferred to Microsoft Excel, and then to SPSS for
analysis.
Data analysis strategy.An initial item pool for the NAQ
scales was generated by a psychiatrist, specializing in psy-
chopharmacology. Each item was classified as reflecting
traits associated with either serotonin or dopamine systems.
To assess content validity of the items in each subscale, judg-
ments were obtained from three other practicing psychia-
trists who frequently evaluate patients' probable responses to
medications (see below). Overall NAQ scale reliabilities,
individual-item performance, scale dimensionality, and
potential item bias (by gender) were assessed using a Rasch
model for rating scales (O'Connor et al., 2005). Convergent
and discriminant validity were assessed using correlations
with standardized measures of psychopathology and person-
ality, and by comparisons of groups distinguished by self-
reported psychiatric diagnoses.
Results
NAQ Content Validity Assessment
Three independent psychiatrists rated each item of the NAQ
item pool on two separate Likert-type scales (from 1 = not at
all to 5 = a great deal) indicating the degree to which items
reflect characteristics associated with dopamine and sero-
tonin systems. We assessed interrater agreement using intra-
class correlations (ICC) based on fixed effects analysis of
variance. The ICC for the serotonin ratings was .79 and for
the dopamine ratings was .81. Rater averages on each were
calculated. Items were then classified as either dopamine or
serotonin-related, depending on the higher of the two scale
averages. These classifications were then compared with the
initial classifications obtained from the psychiatrist who gen-
erated the items. All but one item ("I lose my temper easily")
obtained the same classification from the two sources. This
ambiguous item was removed from the item pool, leaving 19
items in the S-scale and 27 items in the D-scale. Items were
subsequently assessed for reliability and validity using data
from the online sample.
Reliabilities and Item Analyses of NAQ scales
To assess psychometric characteristics of the S and D scales,
we fit the items of each to a rating scale extension of the
Rasch model (Andrich, 1978). The Rasch model for dichoto-
mous items posits that any individual's score on a given item
is a function of two parameters: a parameter representing the
difficulty (or endorsability) of the item, and a parameter rep-
resenting the individual's standing on the latent construct
being measured. The rating scale extension of the Rasch
model also includes a threshold parameter for each response
category in polytomous items. Item difficulties and person
measures are on a common logit scale. In Rasch analysis,
ordinal raw scores (the sum of items in the scale) are
6 SAGE Open
transformed into interval-level logit measures. For the D and
S scales, we transformed the scales such that the lowest pos-
sible raw score was associated with a Rasch measure of 0 and
the highest raw score was associated with a Rasch measure
of 100. Rasch measures were used in all subsequent validity
analyses. (Tables for converting raw score sums to Rasch
interval measures are available on request from the authors.)
To assess overall scale characteristics, we examined item
and person separation reliabilities. Item separation indicates
the degree to which items are sufficiently separated in dif-
ficulties to form a useful measurement continuum (values
greater than .90 are acceptable). Person separation indicates
the degree of error-free variability among respondents on
the measured construct. It is generally interpreted by the
same standards as Cronbach's alpha coefficient. The fit of
individual items to the Rasch model was assessed using
information-weighted mean-square fit statistics. These fit
statistics have an expected value of 1. Items with fit statis-
tics less than 1.5 contribute effectively to a measurement
system (Linacre, 2007).
Psychometric functioning of the S-scale.For the 19-item
S-scale, the Rasch item separation reliability was .99, indi-
cating adequate spread of item difficulties. The person sepa-
ration reliability was .80 (.70 is a conventional cut-off). In
Table 3, we present the item difficulty estimates and the
mean-square fit statistics for each item of the S-scale. Items
are displayed from highest to lowest item difficulties. Lower
values of item difficulties indicate "easier-to-endorse" items.
All items fit the model successfully, with fit statistics rang-
ing from 0.76 to 1.30. We examined potential differential
item functioning (DIF) by gender. To test for DIF using
Rasch methods, items are calibrated separately for all sub-
groups (equated onto a common scale) and item difficulties
are compared between subgroups (Draba, 1977). Gender dif-
ferences in item difficulties ranged from -.49 to .26 logits.
Differences of less than half a logit suggest no serious item
bias for most testing situations (Wright & Douglas, 1975).
Psychometric functioning of the D-scale. For the 27 items of
the D-scale, the item separation reliability was .99 and the
person separation reliability was .85. Table 4 displays the
item difficulty estimates and the mean-square fit statistics
for each item. Item fit statistics ranged from 0.79 to 1.53.
We also examined potential DIF by gender on the D-scale
items. Gender differences in item difficulties ranged from
-.27 to .29 logits, suggesting no serious item bias by
gender.
Associations of NAQ Scales With Psychopathology
and Personality
Table 5 presents correlations of the NAQ scales with con-
tinuous measures of psychological symptoms and with per-
sonality factors. Means and standard deviations for all scales
are displayed. Among zero-order correlations, most were
statistically significant at the .001 level, and correlations
were moderately high except for Extraversion and Openness
to Experience, which had meager correlations with both
NAQ subscales. Figure 1 displays the correlations between
NAQ scales and standardized measures of psychopathology.
Correlations were stronger with the S-scale for all measures

except the ADHD measure, which had a stronger relation-
ship with the D-scale.
Because NAQ scales were moderately correlated with
each other (r = .60), we also calculated partial correlations of
the NAQ subscales (each controlling for the other) with the
measures of symptoms and personality (see Table 5). These
results reflect the independent contribution of each NAQ
subscale to predicting the validity measures, and better high-
light the discriminant validity of the D- and S-scales.
Table 6 presents the same correlations obtained among
the male and female participants separately. Independent-
samples t-tests determined whether males and females dif-
fered in mean scores on the NAQ scales. On the D-scale,
there was no significant difference between males (M = 49.8,
SD = 4.49) and females (M = 50.2, SD = 4.21), t(894) =
-1.23, p = .22. There was, however, a significant difference
on the S-scale, with females (M = 51.2, SD = 4.73) higher
than males (M = 48.5, SD = 4.52), t(894) = -6.98, p < .001.
NAQ Scales and Self-Reported Diagnoses
One-way analyses of variance were used to predict NAQ scale
scores from self-reported diagnoses. Diagnoses of epilepsy,
pain, and addiction were excluded because of inadequate sam-
ple sizes. Table 7 displays the means and standard deviations
for each diagnostic category. The overall F-tests for both
scales were statistically significant. Dunnett's post hoc tests
(two-sided,  = .05) were used to compare each diagnostic
group with the group that reported no diagnosis. For the
D-scale, three diagnostic groups were significantly higher than
the no-diagnosis group: ADHD, depression, and bipolar.
Figure 2 shows Cohen's d effect size estimates for the S-scale,
based on the mean and standard deviation of the no-diagnosis
group. For the S-scale, the depression, anxiety, bipolar and
OCD groups were significantly higher than the no-diagnosis
group. All of these diagnostic groups had effect sizes greater
than .50--at least half a standard deviation above the mean of
the no-diagnosis group. Only the OCD and bipolar groups had
effect sizes greater than 1.0. For the D-scale, three diagnostic
groups were significantly higher than the no-diagnosis group,
ADHD, depression, and bipolar disorder. Figure 3 presents
effect sizes for the diagnostic groups on the D-scale. Only the
ADHD group had an effect size greater than 1.0, with the bipo-
lar group approaching this level.
Discussion
This study supports the psychometric strength of a new clini-
cal screening tool and demonstrates the potential value of
posing questions captured in the NAQ when physicians are
prescribing medications for patients presenting with psycho-
logical problems. While these complaints may be regarded as
unusual, idiosyncratic, or even disagreeable personality vari-
ations rather than signs of discrete disorders, they may be
treatable by psychotropic medications or psychosocial strate-
gies. The NAQ subscales appear to confirm common clinical
observations; disorders known to be treated best with particu-
lar medications are found to be elevated on subscales as
would be predicted. For example, subjects who score high on
a well-used screening measure of attention deficit and hyper-
activity disorder also show evidence of dysfunction on the

dopaminergic subscale of the NAQ, and this corresponds to
the common treatment of ADHD with a dopaminergic ago-
nist. Likewise, patients who demonstrate elevations in a
screening tool for OCD appear to have greater dysfunction in
the serotonergic circuit, corresponding to the well-known
efficacy of serotonergic medications in the treatment of OCD.
These findings most succinctly validate the subscales of the
NAQ. In depression, data from the NAQ suggests that the
disorder may represent dysfunction of either or both circuits,
and this too corresponds to the experience of psychopharma-
cologists and other physicians treating depression. This
includes internists and other nonpsychiatric specialists along
with prescribing treatment providers with other licenses, such
as supervised nurse practitioners and physician assistants.
Psychiatric lore suggests that depressed women respond
to monotherapy with a serotonin agonist more often than do
men. The NAQ subscales contribute to a growing body of
evidence confirming the psychiatric impression that women
and men differ in their predisposition to serotonin-associated
psychiatric disorders (Jovanovic et al., 2006). The results of
this study demonstrate that many depressed men may suffer
from a dopaminergic and serotonergic dysfunction, while
women are more likely to be experiencing a serotonergic
problem. Subtleties found by the NAQ support the com-
monly held experience that individual differences may be
important in the treatment of depression and the questions
commonly asked by specialists in psychopharmacology
should be moved into the internist's office. All patients may
need a case-specific approach to effective treatment design.
The effective use of a neurotransmitter-focused screening
and assessment tool before deciding on specific psychopharma-
cological treatments and even, perhaps, behavioral treatment is
one of the recommendations suggested by this study, warrant-
ing future research. Assessing a patient's serotonergic and
dopaminergic tone using the NAQ might allow clinicians treat-
ing depression and anxiety disorders--often confusing and
intermixed in presentation--to better predict the medication
most likely to be effective, that is, a serotonergic agonist such as
Figure 3. D-scale score effect size estimates for diagnostic
groups relative to group reporting no diagnosis.
10 SAGE Open
citalopram (Celexa) or a dopaminergic agonist such as bupro-
pion (Wellbutrin), or in some cases both. Assessing patients and
tailoring medication approaches before treatment might yield
improved compliance and subsequence remission rates, partic-
ularly when the first agent or agents used are effective. When
initial trials fail to provide relief from symptoms, patients are
likely to drop out of treatment, instead of hanging in while the
prescribing professional initiates second or third trials.
The potential research applications in social cognitive
neuroscience and psychopathology might increase our
understanding of the mechanisms underlying many psycho-
logical problems. In addition, current clinical trials compar-
ing medication and psychotherapy only become specific in
terms of what kind of psychotherapy is used in a study. So for
example, a CBT for depression is compared with a pharma-
cological treatment. However, all patients in such a study are
treated with one medication, most often a SSRI, a serotonin
agonist, helpful for the depressed person who suffers from
poor serotonergic tone. However, the medication may fail to
help the patient who needs a dopaminergic agonist. The lack
of case-specificity in psychopharmacological agents used in
studies comparing CBT with treatment with medication for
depression may be producing erroneous results. Studies
comparing psychotherapy with medication might yield an
entirely different picture, if the appropriate class of medica-
tion were used for each patient in a case-specific manner
(Cuijpers et al., 2012).
While beginning with clinical observations, we suggest
that the circuit model of psychopathology extends to normal
personality within an evolutionary framework. The circuit
model might provide personality researchers with new
insights into fundamental biological systems that underlie
many commonplace individual differences. For example, it
would be reasonable to expect that many underachieving
individuals, who seemingly fail to pursue socially valued
goals, might be characterized as having low levels of appeti-
tive motivation, assertiveness, and reward dependence, that
is, traits linked to dopaminergic systems. This initial expec-
tation, however, might be unjustified in some cases. In previ-
ous research, submissive behavior, low social ranking, and
depressive symptomatology have been linked to elevated
levels of empathy-based survivor guilt (O'Connor, Berry,
Weiss, Schweitzer, & Sevier, 2000; O'Connor et al,, 2002).
In the present study, survivor guilt (and the closely related
omnipotent responsibility, also based on empathy) was more
strongly correlated with the S-scale of the NAQ than with the
D-scale. One implication of these results is that what might
appear at first to be low dominance and achievement motiva-
tion (low anger/BAS) might instead be a consequence of
fearful, anxious, and inhibitory traits (high fear/BIS) related
to concerns about the safety and well-being of others (H. S.
Akiskal, 1998).
There are obvious limitations to this study. To date, it is
still impossible to provide direct biological evidence linking
the hypothesis that subscales of the NAQ are associated with
dysfunctions in dopaminergic or serotonergic circuits. We
are still unable to measure brain levels of serotonin or dopa-
mine, from blood or urine samples. Furthermore, even if
such a technological advance were to be made, and it became
easy to empirically measure these neurotransmitters, it is not
clear that direct correlations between dysfunctions in the
dopaminergic or serotonergic circuits and personality traits
associated with particular disorders would necessarily cor-
relate with overall levels of the respective neurotransmitter
levels. There are also differences in the manner in which
brain circuits respond in terms of their regulation in various
psychiatric disorders and in different parts of the brain.
Therefore, the knowledge of measured neurotransmitter lev-
els might be of limited use in linking clinical data and per-
sonality traits to the treatment plans. Furthermore,
assessments are based on self-reports, which might have
resulted in bias due to shared method variance. These issues
must be considered in future research before further conclu-
sions can be drawn about the clinical validity and utility of
the NAQ.
The development and validation of the NAQ is a good
first step in trying to provide a systematic measure that links
personality traits and clinical data to pharmacological treat-
ment approaches. With few exceptions, scholars, clinicians,
and researchers fail to link personality and temperament
traits with psychiatric treatment and there has largely been an
absence of efforts to point out obvious connections. The
NAQ attempts to fill that void with a relatively accessible
instrument needed at least until there are more sophisticated
methods by which to determine biological indicators of spe-
cific dysfunction of neurotransmitter circuits. Future research
in clinical populations may find the NAQ useful to prescrib-
ing treatment providers in making medication decisions. If
prescribers are more quickly and reliably able to determine
the medications most likely to be successful in providing
relief from symptoms by even a few weeks, there will inevi-
tably be better patient compliance and treatment outcome.
The subscales of the NAQ may be used to improve the valid-
ity of outcome studies. Instead of using the same medication
for all depressed patients in an outcome study comparing
psychopharmacological with cognitive behavioral and/or
other psychosocial treatments, classes of medications might
be selected on a case-specific basis. In this era of evidence-
based medicine, the use of instruments designed to consider
individuals in a case-specific manner is increasingly called
for, and the NAQ is a step in that direction.
