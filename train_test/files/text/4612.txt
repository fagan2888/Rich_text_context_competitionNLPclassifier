Abstract: We secured data from 243 men in committed, sexual, heterosexual relationships
to test the sperm retention hypothesis of oral sex. We predicted that, among men who
perform cunnilingus on their partner, those at greater risk of sperm competition are more
likely to perform cunnilingus until their partner achieves orgasm (Prediction 1), and that,
among men who ejaculate during penile-vaginal intercourse and whose partner experiences
a cunnilingus-assisted orgasm, ejaculation will occur during the brief period in which
female orgasm might function to retain sperm (Prediction 2). The results support Prediction
1 but not Prediction 2. We discuss limitations of the current research and discuss how these
results may be more consistent with alternative hypotheses regarding female orgasm and
oral sex.

Introduction
Human sperm competition
When a female copulates with two or more males within a sufficiently brief time
period, the sperm of the different males simultaneously occupy the female's reproductive
tract and compete to fertilize the ova (Parker, 1970). Human sperm competition most
commonly occurs in the context of female infidelity (Shackelford and Pound, 2006; Smith,
1984). When a woman pursues extra-pair copulations, her regular partner is at risk for
cuckoldry--the unwitting investment of resources into offspring to whom he is genetically
unrelated. The reproductive costs of female infidelity may have caused the evolution of
Is cunnilingus-assisted orgasm a male sperm-retention strategy?

male adaptations designed to thwart or counter the costs of infidelity (Shackelford and
Goetz, 2007).
Men use various cues to estimate the risk of their partner's infidelity (and thus
sperm competition). Men who spend a greater proportion of time apart from their partner
since the couple's last copulation experience a greater risk of sperm competition because
their partner has more opportunities to surreptitiously copulate with other men (Baker and
Bellis, 1993a; McKibbin, Bates, Shackelford, Hafen, and LaMunyon, 2010; Pham and
Shackelford, in press; Shackelford, Goetz, McKibbin, and Starratt, 2007; Shackelford et al.,
2002). Women also may present a recurrent risk of sperm competition for their partner;
men mated to women who have a history of infidelity or who possess personality traits
predictive of infidelity are at greater recurrent risk of sperm competition (Goetz et al.,
2005; McKibbin et al., 2010). Men mated to more attractive women also are at greater
recurrent risk of sperm competition because rival men more frequently approach, and
successfully lure away, more attractive women (Goetz et al., 2005; Schmitt and Buss,
2001).
Men adjust their behaviors and physiology to minimize the risk of cuckoldry. Men
at greater risk of sperm competition ejaculate a greater number of sperm at the couple's
next copulation (Baker and Bellis, 1993a), report greater interest in copulating with their
partner (Pham and Shackelford, in press; Shackelford et al., 2002, 2007; Starratt,
McKibbin, and Shackelford, 2013), perform deeper and more vigorous copulatory thrusts
that may function to displace rival semen (Gallup et al., 2003; Goetz et al., 2005), and are
more likely to sexually coerce their partner (Goetz and Shackelford, 2006). Furthermore,
men perform more frequently mate retention behaviors--behaviors designed to decrease
the risk of their partner's infidelity--when she is ovulating than when she is not ovulating
(Gangestad, Thornhill, and Garver, 2002; Haselton and Gangestad, 2006; Pillsworth and
Haselton, 2006). These behaviors appear to be anti-cuckoldry tactics.
Sperm retention and oral sex
Female orgasm may play an important role in sperm competition. Female orgasm
may promote conception via uterine contractions, which pull sperm further into the
reproductive tract (Fox, Wolff, and Baker, 1970; Wildt, Kissler, Licht, and Becker, 1998;
Zervomanolakis et al., 2007, 2009), thereby reducing the distance sperm need to travel to
reach the ova. Some evidence indicates that women retain more sperm when they
experience an orgasm temporally near their partner's ejaculation (Baker and Bellis, 1993b),
and men at greater risk of sperm competition report greater interest in their partner's
orgasm (McKibbin et al., 2010). Men perform various behaviors to facilitate their partner's
orgasm, including vaginal penetration, cunnilingus, and manual vaginal or clitoral
stimulation, and the induction method may affect the degree to which sperm is retained
(Levin, 2001; Masters and Johnson, 1966; reviewed in King and Belsky, 2012).
Additionally, women are more likely to experience a copulatory orgasm when receiving
cunnilingus than if they do not receive cunnilingus (Richters, de Visser, Rissel, and Smith,
2006) and men at greater risk of sperm competition report greater interest in, and spend
more time performing, cunnilingus on their partner (Pham and Shackelford, 2013a). These
results are consistent with a sperm retention explanation for cunnilingus, which proposes
Is cunnilingus-assisted orgasm a male sperm-retention strategy?
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 11(2). 2013. -407-
that men's interest in, and time spent performing, cunnilingus reflects their motivation to
promote the occurrence of their partner's orgasm, thereby facilitating retention of the most
recently deposited sperm.
In this study, we test this sperm-retention hypothesis of cunnilingus. Here, we
restrict our sample to men who performed cunnilingus on their partner at the couple's most
recent sexual encounter. We predict that, among men who perform cunnilingus on their
partner, those at greater recurrent risk of sperm competition will be more likely to report
that their partner achieved orgasm (Prediction 1). Moreover, previous research indicates
that sperm retention increases as the time between a man's ejaculation and his partner's
orgasm decreases, and that the greatest sperm retention occurs when a woman achieves
orgasm one minute before and up to 45 minutes after her partner ejaculates into her vagina
(Baker and Bellis, 1993b; Thornhill, Gangestad, and Comer, 1995). We therefore predict
that, among men whose partner achieves cunnilingus-assisted orgasm, female orgasm will
occur during the brief time period during which it might function to retain sperm
(Prediction 2). Because men's relationship satisfaction and the length of their relationship
are correlated with their interest in their partner's orgasm (McKibbin et al., 2010) and with
the performance and frequency of cunnilingus (Kaestle and Halpern, 2007; Santilla et al.,
2008), we control statistically for these potential confounds.
Materials and Methods
Participants
We recruited by word-of-mouth 243 men from universities and the community
(United States: n = 190; Germany: n = 53) who were at least 18 years of age, and who were
in a committed, heterosexual, sexual relationship lasting at least one year. Based on
informal discussions with the participants, we estimate that 75% of the participants lived
together and 50% were legally married. All participants reported having had sex with their
partner at least once in the past week. The mean participant age was 25.5 years (SD = 8.2)
and the mean relationship length was 50.2 months (SD = 63.4; range: 12-475).
Materials and procedures
Participants reported their age and the length of their current relationship on a
questionnaire. Following Goetz et al. (2005), participants answered four questions about
the attractiveness of their partner on a Likert-type scale ranging from 0 (Not at all) to 9
(Extremely): How (1) physically attractive and (2) sexually attractive do you find your
partner? How (3) physically attractive and (4) sexually attractive do other men find your
partner? Participants also answered questions about their most recent sexual encounter with
their partner, including whether they performed oral sex on her (Definitely did / Definitely
did not / Can't remember) and whether their partner achieved orgasm as a consequence of
oral sex (Definitely did / Definitely did not / I'm not sure). Participants reported the timing
of their ejaculation relative to their partner's orgasm in minutes, and whether their
ejaculation occurred before, during, or after their partner's orgasm. Finally, participants
reported their (1) sexual, (2) emotional, and (3) overall satisfaction with their partner, and
(4) their commitment to their partner, on a 10-point Likert-type scale (0 = Not at all, 9 =
Is cunnilingus-assisted orgasm a male sperm-retention strategy?

Extremely). Participants were asked to place the completed questionnaire in an envelope
that they then sealed and returned to the experimenter.
Initial processing of data
Following previous research (Goetz et al., 2005; Pham and Shackelford, 2013a), we
constructed a recurrent risk of sperm competition measure ( = .84) from the mean of four
variables: how sexually and physically attractive the participant views his partner, and how
sexually and physically attractive the participant believes other men view his partner. We
constructed a relationship satisfaction measure ( = .85) from the mean of four variables:
sexual, emotional, and overall satisfaction with partner, and commitment to partner. We
excluded from analyses data from men who reported not remembering or who were
uncertain of whether their partner achieved a cunnilingus-assisted orgasm (n = 29).
Following these exclusion criteria, data reported by 214 men remained.
Results
To test Prediction 1, we used hierarchical logistic regression to predict the
occurrence of cunnilingus-assisted orgasm from recurrent risk of sperm competition,
controlling statistically for men's relationship satisfaction and the length of the relationship.
In the first step, we entered recurrent risk of sperm competition into the model, which was
statistically significant, 2(1) = 28.31, p < .001, explained 3.7% (Cox and Snell R2) to 5.0%
(Nagelkerke R2) of the variance, and correctly classified 60.7% of the cases (see Table 1).

Next, we entered relationship length and men's relationship satisfaction into the
regression model. The full model containing all predictors was statistically significant, 2
(3) = 26.72, p = .001, explained 5.7% (Cox and Snell R2) to 7.7% (Nagelkerke R2) of the
variance, and correctly classified 62.1% of the cases. Consistent with Prediction 1,
recurrent risk of sperm competition significantly predicted the occurrence of partner
orgasm, controlling for relationship length and men's relationship satisfaction (see Table
2).

Figure 1 displays the timing of men's ejaculation relative to their partner's
cunnilingus-induced orgasm. To test Prediction 2, we conducted a binomial test (50% test
proportion) to assess whether, among men whose partner achieved cunnilingus-assisted
orgasm and who ejaculated during penile-vaginal intercourse, female orgasm occurred in
the time period during which it might function to retain sperm--one minute before and up
to 45 minutes after ejaculation (Baker and Bellis, 1993b; Thornhill et al., 1995). Prediction
2 was not supported: 42 of 102 men (41%) reported ejaculating within the greater retention
period (p > .05).

Discussion
The results of the current study are not consistent with the hypothesis that
cunnilingus is designed to promote sperm retention. Men at greater recurrent risk of sperm
competition are more likely to perform cunnilingus on their partner until she achieves
orgasm; however, ejaculation usually does not occur in the brief time period during which
orgasm might function to retain sperm.
Female orgasm may be designed to increase relationship satisfaction (Pair-Bond
Hypothesis), to encourage subsequent copulations (Promoting Future Copulations
Hypothesis), to retain preferentially the sperm of men with higher genetic quality (Sire
Choice Hypothesis), to promote fertilization (for a critical review, see Levin, 2011), or
female orgasm may be a non-functional byproduct of male orgasm (reviewed in Puts,
Dawood, and Welling, 2012). The results of the current research provide support for the
Pair-Bond Hypothesis and the Promotion of Future Copulations Hypothesis. The Pair-Bond
Hypothesis states that female orgasm functions to strengthen the emotional bond between
partners, and the Promoting Future Copulations Hypothesis states that female orgasm
functions to reward sexual behaviors, thereby promoting future sexual encounters with a
particular man. These two hypotheses are consistent with the broader hypothesis that men
promote their partner's orgasm to minimize the risk of her infidelity because women who
experience stronger feelings of intimacy and who are more satisfied with their partner are
less likely to commit infidelity (Buss and Shackelford, 1997). However, one hypothesis
alone may not best explain the function of female orgasm (e.g., McKibbin et al., 2010, who
documented that men's risk of sperm competition moderates the association between men's
relationship satisfaction and their interest in their partner's orgasm). Given the ongoing
debate regarding the function of female orgasm (reviewed in Puts et al., 2012), future
research should continue to investigate the several proposed functions of female orgasm
and, in particular, should attempt to replicate the research of Baker and Bellis (1993b),
which relied on a relatively small sample to document that female orgasm may increase
sperm retention.
Pham and Shackelford (2013a) identified three evolutionary functions of
cunnilingus. Men may perform oral sex on their partner to detect her sexual infidelity by
smelling and tasting other men's semen near or within her vagina (Infidelity Detection
Hypothesis; Thornhill, 2006), to facilitate their partner's orgasm and consequent sperm
retention, or to minimize the risk of their partner's infidelity by increasing her relationship
satisfaction (Mate Retention Hypothesis). The results of the current study appear to support
the Mate Retention Hypothesis, which is consistent with previous research documenting
that men who report greater interest in, and spend more time performing, cunnilingus on
their partner also perform more frequently mate retention behaviors (Pham and
Shackelford, 2013b).
Men may not be accurate in determining if or when their partner experiences
orgasm. We attempted to address this limitation by excluding from analyses reports from
men who were uncertain or who could not remember if their partner had an orgasm.
However, the current study investigates men's sperm competition psychology. Men's anti-
cuckoldry behaviors (e.g., performing oral sex on their partner until she achieves orgasm,
Is cunnilingus-assisted orgasm a male sperm-retention strategy?
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 11(2). 2013. -411-
ejaculating into their partner's vagina temporally near her orgasm) depend on men's
perception of the risk of their partner's infidelity. Men's perception of the occurrence of
their partner's orgasm is arguably a more appropriate assessment when investigating their
sperm competition psychology. Future research could nevertheless benefit from securing
directly women's reports of their own orgasm.
A substantial minority of women cannot achieve orgasm, and research has
identified several health factors that adversely affect a woman's capacity to achieve orgasm
(Lightner, 2002). We secured men's perceptions of their partner's sexual and physical
attractiveness as proxies for the recurrent risk of sperm competition. These assessments, in
turn, might provide indirect assessments of women's health (Weeden and Sabini, 2005),
but many health conditions may not manifest in women's attractiveness (Weeden and
Sabini, 2005). However, evidence suggests that the vast majority of women are capable of
experiencing orgasm (Lloyd, 2005), and that social factors may better predict female
orgasm than sexual health (Marshall, 1971). Nevertheless, future research on female
orgasm could benefit from securing data on the health status of women to control for this
potential confound.
The current research assessed men's risk of their partner's infidelity from their
partner's attractiveness. Previous research documented that men attend simultaneously to
multiple cues to partner infidelity (McKibbin, Starratt, Shackelford, and Goetz, 2011; Pham
and Shackelford, in press). Future research investigating the function of cunnilingus in
contexts of partner infidelity would benefit from using combinations of partner infidelity
cues, including men's partner's attractiveness (Goetz et al., 2005), her history of infidelity
(McKibbin et al., 2010), her current conception risk (Gangestad et al., 2002; Haselton and
Gangestad, 2006; Pillsworth and Haselton, 2006), and the time she spends with male
friends (Pham and Shackelford, in press).
In conclusion, an evolutionary perspective can generate testable hypotheses
regarding the function of behaviors and underlying mechanisms. In the current research, we
explored and tested the functions of cunnilingus and female orgasm. The results of the
current research suggest that cunnilingus and female orgasm may be best explained as
elements of a broader male mate retention strategy, but also that a single hypothesis alone
may not provide a complete explanation.
