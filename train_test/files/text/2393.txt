Firearm Homicide and Other Causes of Death in
Delinquents: A 16-Year Prospective Study
WHAT'S KNOWN ON THIS SUBJECT: Homicide is the third leading
cause of mortality in general population youth aged 15 to 29
years. Groups at greatest risk for early violent death (racial/
ethnic minorities, males, poor persons, and urban youth) are
overrepresented in the juvenile justice system.
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: We examined rates of and risk factors
for firearm homicide and other causes of death in delinquents 16
years after detention. Our study analyzes gender differences;
compares Hispanics, African Americans, and non-Hispanic whites;
and includes a representative sample of delinquents.
abstract
BACKGROUND: Delinquent youth are at risk for early violent death after
release from detention. However, few studies have examined risk factors
for mortality. Previous investigations studied only serious offenders (a
fraction of the juvenile justice population) and provided little data on
females.
METHODS: The Northwestern Juvenile Project is a prospective longitu-
dinal study of health needs and outcomes of a stratified random sample
of 1829 youth (657 females, 1172 males; 524 Hispanic, 1005 African Amer-
ican, 296 non-Hispanic white, 4 other race/ethnicity) detained between
1995 and 1998. Data on risk factors were drawn from interviews;
death records were obtained up to 16 years after detention. We
compared all-cause mortality rates and causes of death with those of
the general population. Survival analyses were used to examine risk
factors for mortality after youth leave detention.
RESULTS: Delinquent youth have higher mortality rates than the general
population to age 29 years (P , .05), irrespective of gender or race/
ethnicity. Females died at nearly 5 times the general population rate
(P , .05); Hispanic males and females died at 5 and 9 times the general
population rates, respectively (P , .05). Compared with the general
population, significantly more delinquent youth died of homicide and
its subcategory, homicide by firearm (P , .05). Among delinquent youth,
racial/ethnic minorities were at increased risk of homicide compared
with non-Hispanic whites (P , .05). Significant risk factors for external-
cause mortality and homicide included drug dealing (up to 9 years
later), alcohol use disorder, and gang membership (up to a decade
later).
CONCLUSIONS: Delinquent youth are an identifiable target population to
reduce disparities in early violent death. Pediatrics 2014;134:63­73

Delinquency is commonly associated
with the perpetration of violence, but
delinquentyoutharealsoatriskforearly
violent death.1­5 In their classic study of
500 white delinquent male subjects
sampled in the 1940s,2 Glueck and
Glueck found that nearly 5% had died by
age 32 years, compared with 2.2% of
nondelinquent control subjects. In-
creased risk persisted to age 65 years.3
A more recent longitudinal study of de-
linquent youth found that their mortality
rates, after adjusting for demographic
differences, were .4 times those of
general population youth.4
Few longitudinal studies of delinquent
youth have examined risk factors for early
violent death. Some studies had too few
deathstoanalyzeriskfactors.1,5 Thelargest
and most recent investigations found
substance abuse, gang involvement, and
criminal activity are among the risk fac-
torsassociatedwithearlyviolentdeath.6,7,8
These previous investigations provide
importantdata,buttheyhavelimitations:
1. The samples do not reflect the de-
mographic characteristics of today's
delinquent youth. There are few data
on females,3,6 who now comprise
nearly 30% of arrested youth10 and
have mortality rates up to 8 times
those of the general population.4
One study3 did not include racial/
ethnic minorities, groups who are
disproportionately incarcerated. Afri-
can Americans and Hispanics now
comprise one-third of the general
population aged 15 to 29 years11
but approximately two-thirds of in-
carcerated youth12 and young
adults.13 More than one-third of
low-income African-American children
have been arrested by age 24 years,
and .20% have been incarcerated.14
2. Previous studies examined only seri-
ous offenders who had been con-
victed and had served time in
correctional facilities.3,6,7 These studies
have limited generalizability because
serious offenders constitute only
a fraction of the 1.5 million cases
processed in juvenile court each
year.15
3. Many studies did not calculate
mortality rates (deaths per person-
years)1,3,5,9 or compare rates with the
general population according to gen-
der, race/ethnicity, and age.6,7
We addressed these limitations by using
newly available data from the North-
western Juvenile Project, a large-scale
longitudinal study of health needs and
outcomes of delinquent youth.4,16,17 We
used interview data and obtained official
death records up to 16 years after par-
ticipants' baseline interview, analyzing
all-cause mortality and deaths from all
external causes(homicides,unintentional
injuries, and suicides),18 homicide alone,
and firearm homicide alone. In the pres-
ent article, we: (1) calculated mortality
rates according to gender, race/ethnicity,
and age, comparing them with the gen-
eral population in Cook County, Illinois
(hereafter referred to as general pop-
ulation); (2) compared causes of death
with the general population; and (3) de-
termined the association between mor-
tality and modifiable risk factors, such as
substance use disorders, gang member-
ship, and drug dealing.
METHODS
Delinquent Sample
Baseline Interview
Werecruitedastratifiedrandomsample
of1829youthatintaketotheCookCounty
Juvenile Temporary Detention Center
(CCJTDC) in Chicago, Illinois, between
November 20, 1995, and June 14, 1998,
who were awaiting the disposition of
their case. To ensure adequate repre-
sentationofkeysubgroups,westratified
our sample according to gender, race/
ethnicity (African American, non-Hispanic
white, Hispanic, and other), age (10­13
years or $14 years), and legal status
(processed in juvenile or adult court).
Youth were eligible to participate in the
study regardless of the severity of their
alleged offense. Project staff interviewed
participants (most within 2 days of in-
take) at the detention center in a private
area.
Follow-up Interview
Analyses also include data from the
first follow-up interview 3 years
after detention. We interviewed par-
ticipants regardless of where they
were living. The participation rate was
90.7% (1659 of 1829). There were no
significant demographic differences
in retention.
Procedures to Obtain Assent and
Consent
Participants signed either an assent
form (if they were aged ,18 years) or
a consent form (if they were aged $18
years). The institutional review boards
of Northwestern University and the Cen-
ters for Disease Control and Prevention
waived parental consent, consistent with
federal regulations regarding research
with minimal risk.19 We nevertheless
tried to contact parents to provide them
information and used an independent
participant advocate to represent the
interests of the participant.
Variables and Measures
Deaths: Participants' deaths, from Novem-
ber 1995 to December 2011, were tracked
and verified by using death certificates.
Risk Factors: Substance use disorders
wereassessedbyusingage-appropriate
measures at baseline (Diagnostic In-
terviewScheduleforChildren,version2.3
[DISC-2.3])20,21 and again at the follow-
up interview (Diagnostic Interview
Schedule, version IV [DIS-IV]).22,23 Pre-
vious useofdrugs other than marijuana
(sometimes known as "hard drugs" [eg,
cocaine, heroin, hallucinogens]) was
assessed at baseline (by using ques-
tions from the DISC-2.3). Drug dealing,
gang membership, and firearm use
were added at the follow-up interview

Youth Survey).24,25
General Population Data
Thecomparison groups includedAfrican
Americans, non-Hispanic whites, and
Hispanics in the general population
of Cook County, Illinois, who were aged
15 to 29 years. Death counts were
obtained from vital records in 2000,
2005, and 2008 (the most recent data
available).26 Population counts for 5-
year age groups were obtained from
mid-year census estimates for these
same years.27 Additional information
on our methods is provided in the
Supplemental Appendix and published
elsewhere.4,16,17
Statistical Analysis
Comparison of Our Sample With the
General Population
We compared standardized all-cause
mortality rates and specific causes of
deathbetweenourstudysampleandthe
Cook County, Illinois, generalpopulation.
We estimated mortality rates in our
sample by calculating the deaths per
100 000 person-years lived during the
intervals 15 to 19, 20 to 24, and 25 to 29
years of age. Because selected strata
were oversampled (Supplemental Ap-
pendix), we used sampling weights to
estimate mortality rates that reflect
CCJTDC's population; 95% confidence
intervals (CIs) were estimated by using
the jackknife method.
We estimated all-cause mortality rates
in Cook County by using the single-
decrement period life table method.28
To make contemporaneous compar-
isons between our cohort data and
period data from Cook County, we
created 3 synthetic cohorts from the
years 2000, 2005, and 2008. We stan-
dardized Cook County rates to reflect
the racial/ethnic and gender distribu-
tion of the CCJTDC population; 95% CIs
were based on the Poisson distribu-
tion.29 We used the delta method to
compute rate ratios comparing mor-
tality rates and specific causes of
death.
Risk Factors for Mortality in
Delinquent Youth After Detention
We estimated the relationship between
risk factors and subsequent external-
cause mortality, homicide, and firearm
homicide by using weighted nonpara-
metric survival analyses. Kaplan-Meier
functions were used to compare the
probability ofsurvival accordingto race/
ethnicity (self-reported), gender, and
presenceofriskfactors.30 Substanceuse
disorders were analyzed at the baseline
interview and at the follow-up interview
(to be contemporaneous with analyses
of other risk factors).
Weighted Cox proportional hazards re-
gressionwasusedtoestimateunadjusted
hazard ratios for each risk factor and
hazard ratios adjusted for demographic
characteristics (gender, race/ethnicity,
and age at baseline).30 For risk factors
that violated the proportional hazards
assumption, we included time-dependent
covariates in our models (time squared
for gang membership and drug dealing;
time for alcohol use disorder). For risk
factorsmeasuredatfollow-upinterviews,
we augmented sampling weights with
a nonresponse adjustment to account for
missing data.31 Taylor series linearization
was used to estimate SEs.32,33 When an-
alyzing specific causes of death, other
deaths were treated as censored. Be-
cause incarceration restricts some
exposures associated with external-
cause mortality (eg, firearm-related
injuries, automobile crashes),34 and be-
cause no participant died while in-
carcerated, we excluded days when
participants were incarcerated from the
exposure time in all survival analyses.
Days incarcerated were drawn from of-
ficial records. The median exposure time
from baseline through December 2011
was 14.7 years (mean [SE]: 13.6 [0.1]
years; range, 0.4­16.1 years). The median
exposure time from the follow-up in-
terview through December 2011 was 11.5
years (mean [SE]: 10.9 [0.1] years; range,
0.2­13.1 years).
AnalyseswereconductedbyusingStata

Station, TX) and its survey routines.35 In
the following discussions, we address
only statistically significant findings
(P , .05).
RESULTS
Ofthe1829originalparticipants,111died:
7% of males and nearly 4% of females.
Among those who died, 75 (68%) were
homicides. Of these, 68 (91%) partic-
ipantswerekilledwithfirearms(Table1).
Comparison of Our Sample With the
General Population
Mortality Rates
Figure 1 compares standardized mor-
tality rates between our sample and the
general population according to gender,
race/ethnicity, and age by using Cook
County, Illinois, data from 2005. (We also
compared mortality rates using data
from 2000 and 2008. The results were
similar and are available from the
authors.) In nearly every demographic
subgroup, delinquent youth had signifi-
cantly higher mortality rates than the
general population. For example, the
mortality rates of Hispanic males were
4.9 times the general population rates;
mortality rates of Hispanic females
were .9 times the general population
rates. African-American males had the
highest mortality rate in our sample,
but their standardized mortality ratio
(2.7 times the general population rate)
was lower thanmost otherdemographic
subgroups. In contrast, non-Hispanic
white males had a lower mortality rate
than minority males, but their stan-
dardized mortality ratio was 4.4 times
the general population rate.
Althoughmostmortalityratesdecreased
with age, delinquent youth remained at

increased risk in adulthood. Mortality
rates of males aged 15 to 19 years were
5 times those of the general population.
At ages 25 to 29 years, male mortality
rates were still more than twice the
general population rates. Differences
according to age were even greater
amongfemales:thoseaged15to19years
had mortality rates 9 times the general
populationrates,andthoseaged25to29
years were 3.5 times the general pop-
ulation rates.
Cause of Death
Figure 2 compares causes of death be-
tween our sample and the general pop-
ulation according to gender (percentages
are weighted to reflect the demographic
characteristics of detained youth). Homi-
cide (90% of deaths among delinquent
males, 42% among delinquent females)
and its subcategory, homicide by firearm
(86% of deaths among delinquent males,
28% among delinquent females), account
for a significantly greater proportion of
deaths in the delinquent population than
in the general population (for males, ho-
micide ratio: 2.3 [95% CI: 2.1­2.6]; firearm
homicide ratio: 2.5 [95% CI: 2.1­2.9]; for
females, homicide ratio: 3.0 [95% CI: 1.7­
5.2]; firearm homicide ratio: 4.0 [95% CI:
1.8­8.9]).
Risk Factors for Mortality in
Delinquent Youth After Detention
Figure 3 presents Kaplan-Meier survival
curves on demographic characteristics
(gender and race/ethnicity), drug deal-
ing, gang membership, and alcohol use
disorder for external-cause mortality
and its subcategory, homicide. These
curves represent the decline in the
probability of survival over time (years
since detention) according to de-
mographic characteristic or presence
and absence of risk factors. Figure 4
displays the associated adjusted hazard
ratio (aHR) estimates over time (years
since detention) for gang membership,
drug dealing, and alcohol use disorder
(analogous figures for homicide by
firearm are given in Supplemental Fig-
ures 5 and 6). A hazard ratio .1.0
indicates a greater hazard of mortality
among those with the risk factor com-
paredwith those without the risk factor;
,1.0 indicates a lesser hazard of mor-
tality for those with the risk factor; and
1.0 indicates no difference.
Demographic Characteristics
Compared with delinquent females, de-
linquent males had .4 times the hazard
of external-cause mortality and .7
times the hazard of homicide (aHR: 4.4
[95% CI: 2.5­7.6]; aHR: 7.3 [95% CI: 3.5­
14.9], respectively). Racial/ethnic mi-
norities were at increased risk of ho-
micide: compared with non-Hispanic
whites, African Americans had 4.5 times
(95% CI: 1.8­11.2) and Hispanics had 2.8
times (95% CI: 1.1­7.2) the hazard of
homicide (Supplemental Tables 2 and 3).
Gang Membership and Drug Dealing
Gang membership (78.4% of males; 40.7%
of females) and drug dealing (85.8% of
males; 48.4% of females) were signifi-
cantly associated with external-cause
mortality and homicide. The hazard of
external-cause mortality and homicide
decreased over time (Figure 4) but was
still significant 10 years after detention
for gang membership and 9 years after
detention for drug dealing. For example, 5
years after detention, gang members had
10.7 times the hazard of homicide com-
pared with those who had not been gang
members (95% CI: 2.4­48.5). Nine years
after detention, the hazard ratio was 3.4
(95% CI: 1.3­9.1). Delinquent youth who
had dealt drugs had 6.5 times the hazard
of homicide 5 years after detention (95%
CI: 1.7­25.6) and 3.6 times the hazard 8
years after detention (95% CI: 1.1­12.1)
compared with those who had not dealt
drugs.
Alcohol Use Disorder
Delinquent youth with an alcohol use
disorderatthefollow-upinterview(19.1%
of males; 10.7% of females) had a signifi-
cantly increased risk of external-cause
mortality and its subcategory, homicide,
compared with those without the disor-
der. For example, 5 years after detention,
the hazard of homicide was 4.7 times
higherforthosewithalcoholusedisorder
(95% CI: 1.5­15.4). The strength of this
association decreased over time but
remained significant 10 years after de-
tention(Figure4),whenpersonswhohad
met criteria for an alcohol use disorder
still had 3.2 times (95% CI: 1.1­9.5) the
hazard of homicide. Additional findings

DISCUSSION
To our knowledge, this is the first large-
scale study to document the high death
rateofdelinquentfemalesinadulthood,
providing new data on mortality rates
and modifiable risk factors in this vul-
nerable population. Although risk of
mortalityislowerindelinquentfemales
than males, delinquent females died at
nearly 5 times the rate of females in the
general population.
Ourstudyalsoaddsnewinformationon
mortality rates among Hispanics, now
thelargestracial/ethnicminoritygroup
in the United States.36 The mortality
rate among delinquent Hispanic males
was nearly 5 times the general pop-
ulation rate; among Hispanic females, 9
times the general population rate.37

Mortality rates among delinquent His-
panics were more similar to those of
African Americans than to non-Hispanic
whites, unlike patterns in the general
population, in which Hispanic and non-
Hispanic whites have similar rates.37,38
Delinquent youth continue to have sub-
stantially higher mortality rates than the
general population in adulthood, irre-
spective of gender or race/ethnicity. Ho-
micide was the most prevalent cause of
deathamongmale(90%)andfemale(42%)
participants; nearly all homicides involved
firearms. African-American males had the
highest mortality rates but among the
lowest mortality ratios because death
rates among African Americans in the
generalpopulationarehigh.37 Ourfindings
mirror racial/ethnic disparities in the
general population. In 2010, African-
American males comprised 14.6% of the
general population aged 15 to 29 years11
but nearly 75% of deaths by homicide.37
It is difficult to compare our mortality
rateswithpreviousstudiesofdelinquent
youth because of the aforementioned
methodologic differences and limi-
tations. The most comparable longitu-
dinal study found zero deaths among
female subjects and much lower overall
mortality rates.1 The mortality rates
found in our study are most similar to
those of adults in jail39 and prison,40­43
who have substantially higher mortality
rates than the general population.
None of our participants died while in-
carcerated. This finding highlights the
relativesafetyofcorrectionalinstitutions
becauseincarcerationlimitsexposureto
firearms and automobile crashes.34 Re-
entry to the community seems to be
a time of particular risk, especially for
drug overdose and homicide.39­41,43
Limitations
It was not feasible to study multiple
jurisdictions, and our findings may be
generalizable only to detained youth in
urban centers with similar demographic
compositions. The actual mortality ratios
may beevengreater thanthoseobserved
because our sample and the general
population are not mutually exclusive; the
general population also includes youth
who have been detained. Moreover, we
mayhaveunderestimatedmortalityratios
for younger males and racial/ethnic mi-
norities because the US Census under-
counts these groups.44 Because death
was relatively uncommon, some 95% CIs
were wide. Although retention rates were
high, findings on risk factors measured
at follow-up may have been affected by
missing data.
Implications
Our study provides new evidence that
modifiable risk factors (alcohol use
disorder, gang membership, and drug
dealing)areassociatedwithmortalityup
to a decade after detention. Early pre-
vention is key.45,46 Fortunately, promising
innovations are available. For example,
the Good Behavior Game, administered
to school children ages 5 to 9 years,
reduced alcohol abuse, violence, and
other problem behaviors in young
adulthood (ages 19­21 years).47,48

refers to all males and females ages 15 to 29 years who died in Cook County, Illinois, in 2005. Other cause of death includes internal causes and other
accidents. Compared with the general population, delinquent males and females experienced a significantly (P , .05) higher percentage of deaths due to
homicide and its subcategory, homicide by firearm. The total proportion of deaths due to homicide (firearm and other) were 90% for delinquent males, 39%
for general population males, 42% for delinquent females, and 14% for general population females. Due to rounding error, sums of percentages in the figure

ond, preventive interventions can be
integrated into primary care settings.50
Incredible Years,45 a training program

disruptive behaviors, demonstrates the
feasibility of this approach. Finally,
pediatricians are well suited to be
leaders in prevention systems such as
Communities That Care.51,52 Such coali-
tions guide key stakeholders to choose
preventive interventions from a menu of
tested programs based on their com-
munity's profile for risk. Interventions
are available for young children, ado-
lescents, and special populations such
as Hispanics and African Americans.53
The greater challenge is to provide
services for delinquent youth. Although
the juvenile justice system provides
servicesindetentioncenters,courts,and
court-mandated programs,54 the need
for these services greatly exceeds avail-
ability.55 Moreover, nearly all detained
youth eventually return to their commu-
nities.56 Traditional services may then be
inaccessible: delinquent youth may not
have access to health care57,58; may not
attend school regularly59 and therefore
not receive school-based interventions;
and may not have a stable caretaker,60
a requirement for many interventions.54
Comprehensive evidence-based treat-
ments, such as multisystemic therapy61
and functional family therapy,62 ad-
dress some of these barriers. Effective
interventions could reduce the pro-
pensity of offenders to become vic-
tims.63­65
CONCLUSIONS
Although homicide rates have dropped
dramatically since their all-time high in
the late 1990s,66 11 101 people were
killed in firearm homicides in 2011.67
We failed to reach the Surgeon Gen-
eral's goal (from Healthy People 2010)
to cut homicide rates in one-half.68 Our
study of delinquent youth identifies the
vulnerability of females, the high risk
of mortality among African Americans
and Hispanics, and the importance of
modifiable risk factors (alcohol use
disorder, gang membership, and drug
dealing). Moreover, disparities in life
expectancy between African Americans
and non-Hispanic whites69 may persist,
in part, because delinquent African-
American youth have higher death
rates from homicide. Delinquent youth
are an identifiable target population
to reduce disparities in early violent
death.
