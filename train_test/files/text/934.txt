Background: Homicide is the second leading cause of
death in children aged 0 to 19 years. Tailoring violence
prevention programs to high-risk individuals requires un-
derstanding victim-offender relationships.
Objective: To elucidate differences in the relation-
ships between homicide victims aged 0 to 19 years and
their offenders.
Design: Cross-sectional study using the Uniform Crime
Reports: Supplemental Homicide Reports, 1976-1999.
Setting and Participants: The Supplemental Homi-
cide Reports contain incident-level information about
criminal homicides, including location and victim and
offender characteristics. National coverage is approxi-
mately 92%; 70258 victims were studied.
Main Outcome Measures: Differences in the rela-
tionships of homicide victims and offenders based on sex,
age, population of homicide location, and weapon.
Results: Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals
(CIs) are reported. Using strangers as the referent
group, murdered girls were 3.6 (95% CI, 3.4-3.9) times
more likely to have been killed by family members and
21.3 (95% CI, 18.5-24.4) times more likely to have
been killed by intimate partners than murdered boys.
Victims younger than 10 years were 33 (95% CI, 30.4-
36.1) times more likely than victims older than 10 years
to have been killed by a family member and 2.4 (95%
CI, 2.2-2.6) times more likely to have been killed by
someone else known to them. Stranger homicides
occurred in areas with approximately 145000 more
residents (P.01). Handguns were more likely to be
used during homicides committed by strangers
(P.01). These associations remained after adjusting
for potential confounders.
Conclusions: Future violence prevention programs
may have more effect when targeted to specific sex
and age groups. Elucidation of the origins of sex dif-
ferences, focus on evidence-based child abuse preven-
tion efforts, and enforcement of current gun control
laws may help reduce the number of homicides among
children.

HOMICIDE IS THE SECOND
leading cause of death
among children aged 1 to
19 years and the 15th
leading cause of death in
children younger than 1 year.1 In 2000,
there were 3020 childhood homicides, for
a crude homicide rate of 3.84 per 100000.1
Crude homicide rates vary by age, with bi-
modal peaks at 0 to 4 years and at 15 to
19 years. One primary goal of Healthy
People 2010 is the reduction of child-
hood assaults and homicides. Specific ob-
jectives of Healthy People 2010 include re-
ducing firearm-related deaths and physical
assaults by intimate partners.2
Understanding the relationship be-
tween homicide victims and offenders will
aid in designing violence prevention ef-
forts to achieve the Healthy People 2010
objectives. Numerous studies examining
the relationship between homicide vic-
tims and offenders have demonstrated that
most victims were killed by someone
known to them, such as a friend, relative,
or intimate partner.3 These studies also re-
vealed that victims aged 20 to 39 years were
most likely to have been killed by an in-
timate partner2 and these homicides were
most often committed with firearms.3-5 No
previous study has examined victims aged
0 to 19 years nationally. Specifically, prior
studies of child victims examined vic-
tims aged 15 years and older,3 10 years and
older,2,5 and 5 years or younger,6 infants,7
or victims in specific US counties.4

This study was undertaken to elucidate the relation-
ship between homicide victims aged 0 to 19 years and
perpetrators nationally. We sought to identify the cir-
cumstances and relationships that place children at in-
creased risk for violent death to support the develop-
ment of targeted violence prevention interventions. Our
primary hypotheses were that relationships of female ho-
micide victims to offenders are different than relation-
ships of male victims to offenders; victim and offender
relationships differ depending on victim age; victims in
larger cities and towns would more likely be killed by a
stranger; and victims killed by strangers are more likely
to be killed with handguns than other weapons.
METHODS
This study analyzed data from the Inter-University Consor-
tium for Political and Social Research, Ann Arbor, Mich. The
specific data set used was the Uniform Crime Reports (United
States): Supplementary Homicide Reports (SHR), 1976-
1999.8 The Inter-University Consortium for Political and So-
cial Research obtained the data from the Federal Bureau of In-
vestigation.
The SHR contain data on every homicide within the juris-
diction of voluntarily participating police departments. Forms
are completed monthly as part of the Uniform Crime Report-
ing Program.9 National coverage is approximately 92%,8 but the
missing 8% of data is not uniform over space and time.10 Ad-
ditionally, there is no updating of data to reflect subsequent
investigations.10
The SHR contain incident-level information on criminal ho-
micides8 including month and year of the offense, county, and
metropolitan statistical area (MSA) codes. The MSAs are areas
"containing a recognized population nucleus and adjacent com-
munities that have a high degree of integration with that
nucleus."11(p82228) The MSAs are classified based on their popu-
lation size: level A, 1 million or more; level B, 250000 to 999999;
level C, 100000 to 249999; and level D, fewer than 100000.
Additional variables collected include the population of the ho-
micide location; geographic regions; age, race, and sex of vic-
tims and offenders; victim-offender relationships; weapons; and
homicide circumstances (other type of crime, if any, commit-
ted during the homicide).
Two data sets accompany the SHR. This study examined the
victim data set from January 1, 1976, through December 31,
1999, which contains information on the victim of the homi-
cide and the first perpetrator listed in the SHR. (Even if there
were multiple offenders, only the first perpetrator is listed.) If
there are multiple victims of a homicide, all victims and their
relationships to offenders are listed.
This study included all intentional and nonnegligent ho-
micides. Negligent manslaughters and justifiable homicides (as
defined by the Federal Bureau of Investigation) were ex-
cluded. The data set was narrowed to include victims younger
than 20 years. Next, data were recoded to simplify the rela-
tionships between victims and offenders. Relationships char-
acterized as intimate partners are spouse, ex-spouse, common-
law spouse, boyfriend, girlfriend, and homosexual relationship.10
The SHR did not have a category for ex-boyfriend or ex-
girlfriend, who are characterized as intimate partners by the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,12 leading to an un-
derreporting of intimate partners in the SHR where these re-
lationships have been characterized as acquaintances. Family
members are defined as mothers, fathers, stepmothers, stepfa-
thers, in-laws, brothers, sisters, stepbrothers, stepsisters, sons,
daughters, stepsons, stepdaughters, and other family. "Other
known" encompasses neighbors, acquaintances, employees, em-
ployers, friends, and others known. All odds ratios are calcu-
lated using strangers as the referent group.
Analysis was performed using Statistical Package for Social
Sciences for Windows, version 11.5.0.13 Bivariate analysis was
accomplished using 2 for nominal variables, t tests for nor-
mally distributed variables, and the Kruskal-Wallis test for or-
dinal variables or continuous variables with skewed distribu-
tions.Becauseoftheobservationalnatureofthedata,multivariate
models were used to adjust for potential confounders. Vari-
ables found to be significant in bivariate analysis and those be-
lieved to be confounders a priori were included in the final mul-
tinomial logistic regression models. The variables included year
the homicide occurred, season of the homicide, sex of the vic-
tim, age of the victim, race of the victim, MSA, and census di-
vision.Interactiontermswereexaminedand,ifsignificant,placed
in these models. Final results are given as odds ratios with strang-
ers as the referent group.
Limitations include some states' incomplete data due to non-
adherence to Uniform Crime Reports definitions for crimes or
the hierarchy of crimes and other states' nonadherence to the
National Incident-Based Reporting Systems methodology.10
Thirty-seven victims had no sex recorded. Because of this small
number, they were eliminated from the analysis. In addition,
because negligent manslaughters and justifiable homicides are
excluded from the database, the actual numbers and rates of
children killed by firearms cannot be inferred.
The variable most often missing was the victim-offender re-
lationship. Reasons for this included: the crime was not wit-
nessed and therefore a relationship could not be determined,
or the homicide was not solved and therefore the relationship
was unknown. Data were first analyzed excluding all victims
missing offender data. Next, we examined the data imputing
the missing relationship using the methods described herein.
Rates were not calculated for this data set because of the large
amount of missing data, a lack of adherence to the Uniform
Crime Reports definitions, and unreliability of intercensus popu-
lation estimations.
When a relatively large number of observations are miss-
ing information on 1 or more of the variables in the model, a
complete data analysis in which these observations are dis-
carded can lead to bias. Imputation allows the creation of a com-
plete data set by replacing missing values with values that are
imputed from an initial set of assumptions. Multiple imputa-
tion procedures account for the sampling variability in the im-
putation procedure by using Monte Carlo methods to repeat-
edly create imputed data sets.
In this study, the relationship was missing 29% of the time.
Victims missing relationship data were compared with vic-
tims who had relationship data. The peak in homicides oc-
curred in 1993 in both groups, and there were no differences
in the seasonality of homicides in either group. Victims for whom
the relationship was not recorded were 1 year younger, killed
in larger cities or towns, more likely to be African American,
more frequently killed by handguns, and had a slightly higher
male preponderance.
Because of these differences, multiple imputation tech-
niques were used to reanalyze these data. A multinomial model
with a Dirichlet prior distribution to estimate the probability
of observing each pattern of the study variables was used.14 We
used an estimation-maximization algorithm for the saturated
multinomial model to estimate probabilities. Next we used data
augmentation with 50 steps at each iteration to generate 10 im-
puted complete data sets. The logistic regression analyses were
refitted using these 10 imputed data sets, and the method of
Rubin was used to combine the results to get parameter esti-
mates and their corresponding odds ratios and confidence in-
tervals.14,15

To achieve convergence in the estimation procedure, more
parsimonious models were chosen. The number of predictor
variables in the models was reduced by choosing variables most
strongly related to the outcome. Two models were used. The
first included the variables MSA, age of the victim, race of the
victim, sex of the victim, and year of the offense. To analyze
the relationship of handgun use to our outcome, a second model
was analyzed including handguns and all of the mentioned vari-
ables except age of the victim.
As per the Mount Sinai School of Medicine institutional re-
view board, this study is institutional review board exempt.
RESULTS
Of the 452965 total homicide victims in this data set,
70295 (15.5%) were 19 years of age or younger.
The number of homicides by year is shown in
Figure 1. The SHR data demonstrate the same peak in
homicides in 1993 and then decline in homicides as seen
in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's ho-
micide data.1 Minimal seasonality was observed. Over-
all, 27.4% of childhood homicide victims were girls and
72.6% were boys. The age distribution of the victims is
shown in Figure 2. The median age of the victims was
17 years while the mean age of the offenders was 22 years
and 8 months. White individuals made up 48% of vic-
tims, African American individuals 49%. The homicide
victims were killed in cities and towns with an average
of more than 250000 residents. Figure 3 displays the
population of the homicide location based on the MSAs.
The most common circumstance reported in the com-
mitting of a homicide was "other argument," indicating
the interpersonal nature of these homicides. Childhood
homicide victims were killed with guns approximately
60% of the time and with knives 12% of the time. The
majority of these victims (57.7%) were killed by some-
one known to them, 13% were killed by strangers, and
29% of victim-offender relationships were unknown.
The differences in the relationships of victims to
offenders by sex was significant at P.01, with girls who
were killed more likely to have been killed by someone
known to them. A multinomial logistic regression model
(keeping strangers as the referent group) was used to
adjust for the following potential confounders: year of
the homicide, MSA, weapon, age of the victim, race of
the victim, circumstances of the homicide, and census
division where the homicide occurred. In addition, a
multiple imputation method (as previously described)
was used to account for the missing data. All data are
presented with the results of the multinomial model first
and the imputed model second (when applicable). After

adjusting for the above confounders, murdered girls
were more likely than murdered boys to have been
killed by a family member (odds ratio [OR], 2.0; 95%
confidence interval [CI], 1.8-2.2) (imputed data [ID]:
OR, 2.1; 95% CI, 1.9-2.3), and murdered girls continued
to be much more likely than murdered boys to have
been killed by an intimate partner (OR, 32.7; 95% CI,
28.0-38.2) (ID: OR, 24.1; 95% CI, 20.8-28.9). Addition-
ally, murdered girls remained slightly more likely than
murdered boys to have been killed by someone else
known to them (OR, 1.1; 95% CI, 1.1-1.2) (ID: OR, 1.1;
95% CI, 1.0-1.2). These findings were similar to those
from the bivariate analyses.
The differences in victim-offender relationships were
examined by the age groups of the homicide victims.
These age groups were as follows: younger than 1 year,
1 to 4 years, 5 to 9 years, 10 to 14 years, and 15 to 19
years. This analysis revealed significant differences
between the victim's age and the relationship (P.01)
(Table 1).
Because of the bimodal peaks of victims' ages
(Figure 2), we analyzed the age of the victims as a di-
chotomous variable, classifying those younger than 10
years as one group and those 10 years and older as an-
other group. Since children younger than 10 years do not
have intimate partners, no analysis could be run exam-
ining this group. Controlling for potential confounders,
murdered children younger than 10 years were 23 times
more likely (95% CI, 20.7-25.5) (ID: OR, 28.6; 95% CI,
25.4-30.7) to have been killed by a family member and
2.1 times more likely (95% CI, 1.9-2.3) (ID: OR, 2.3; 95%
CI, 2.1-2.5) to have been killed by someone else known
to them than murdered children aged 10 years and older.
These findings were similar to those from the bivariate
analyses.
The next analysis examined changes in the victim-
offender relationship based on the population of the
city or town where the victim was killed. Victims killed
by family members were more likely than those killed
by strangers to have lived in smaller cities and towns,
with populations of approximately 193000 fewer resi-
dents (P.01) (mean population, 139511 vs 333433)
than the cities and towns where those killed by strang-
ers lived. Children killed by intimate partners lived in
cities and towns with, on average, 180000 fewer resi-
dents (P.01) than the cities and towns where those
killed by strangers lived (153399 vs 333433), and those
who were killed by someone else known to them lived
in cities and towns with 105 000 fewer residents
(P.01) than the cities and towns where those killed by
strangers lived (228022 vs 333433). Table 2 lists the
differences in the relationship of the homicide victim to
the offender based on differences in the MSA where the
homicide occurred.
The weapon used in committing the homicide was sig-
nificantly associated with the relationship between the
victim and the offender (P.01). After adjusting for po-
tential confounders, victims killed by strangers were more
likely to have been killed with a handgun, with similar
results in the bivariate model (Table 3).
CONCLUSIONS
Youth homicide remains a significant public health
problem. This report is one of the first to examine the
relationship between the victims of youth homicide and
their offenders. We found marked differences in victim-
offender relationships based on the sex of the victim,
with murdered girls more likely to have been killed by a
family member, an intimate partner, or someone else
known to them. After controlling for potential con-
founders, and using multiple imputation models, the
direction and magnitude of the association between sex

and the relationship of the victim to the offender did
not change appreciably. Further research is needed to
elucidate the reasons for these findings.
The age of the victim was associated with the victim-
offender relationship. Murdered children younger than
10 years were much more likely to have been killed by a
family member or someone else known to them. This
relationship persisted after adjusting for potential con-
founders. This may be because younger children are
more likely to be cared for by family members or others
known to them while older children and adolescents
tend to have more friends and more varied relation-
ships. One striking finding is that, for those victims
aged 15 years and older, strangers were not the most
common relationship (16%). These victims were mostly
killed by someone known to them (48.4%).
The victim-offender relationship was associated with
the population where the homicide occurred. Victims
killed by strangers were more likely to have lived in larger
cities or towns while those killed by family members and
intimate partners were more likely to have lived in smaller
cities or towns. Once again, these relationships held when
adjusting for potential confounders.
Finally, the weapon used during the commission of
the homicide was associated with the victim-offender
relationship. Children killed by strangers were more
likely to have been killed with a handgun than those
killed by family members, intimate partners, or others
known to them. The direction and magnitude of these
associations remained similar in all models except for
handgun use in the murder of strangers vs family
members. The direction of the association for this
group remained the same, but the magnitude was
smaller after adjusting for potential confounders. This
change likely was due to the adjustment for age
because in the imputed model with age removed the
magnitude was similar to that in the unadjusted
model. Since a large proportion of children killed by
family members were younger than 5 years and these
children were the least likely to be killed with a hand-
gun, there was a fairly large change in the OR for this
subset of children.
Using a data set such as the Uniform Crime Reports
has limitations. Only intentional and nonnegligent ho-
micides are included in this data set. Since negligent man-
slaughters and justifiable homicides are excluded, no con-
clusions can be reached regarding the total number of
children killed with guns or other weapons, causing an
underestimation of the number of children killed with
guns and other weapons. Therefore, rates cannot be cal-
culated. In addition, this data set includes numerous un-
solved homicides and therefore offender data may be miss-
ing. While rates cannot be calculated, the sheer number
of homicides included in this data set makes these data
extremely compelling.
The National Violent Death Reporting System even-
tually will be the ideal data set to study victim-offender
relationships for homicides. However, since the Na-
tional Violent Death Reporting System is not yet used na-
tionally, the SHR are the next best alternative.
The fact that 29% of the homicide victims did not
have a relationship reported is a known limitation of
the data set used. We attempted to eliminate bias by im-
puting data. All of the associations and magnitudes re-
mained quite similar in both analyses. This mimics re-
sults found in other studies of large data sets, such as
the cardiovascular health study16 and other studies,17-19
and strengthens our findings.
The associations of the victim-offender relationships
with the age of the victim, sex of the victim, population
where the homicide took place, and usage of a handgun
in committing the murder mirror and add to the find-
ings in smaller prior studies,2-7,20 in which the samples
were restricted by age, sex, or location.
Focusing on the victim-offender relationships of
homicides can enhance current youth violence preven-
tion strategies. Given that murdered girls are more
likely than murdered boys to have been killed by family
members, further studies are needed to elucidate the
origins of these findings. This may lead to new and
unique sex-based primary prevention efforts aimed at
families during the newborn period and beyond. Addi-
tionally, the knowledge that murdered older girls are
more likely to have been killed by intimate partners
encourages the initiation of violence prevention coun-
seling early on, which may reduce the number of inti-
mate partner homicides. Finally, the finding that hand-
guns are more likely to be used during homicides of
children by strangers supports the vigorous enforce-
ment of gun control laws to reduce childhood homi-
cides. Further studies are needed to develop and dem-
onstrate the efficacy of the violence prevention efforts
initiated based on these findings.

Call for Papers
Picture of the Month
Because of popular demand, we are reinstituting our
Picture of the Month feature. This will be presented as
an unknown in the ARCHIVES, with the reverse side of
the page being the denouement. We would like to get com-
mon problems presenting uncommonly, rather than total
zebras. These cases should be of interest to practicing pe-
diatricians, problems that they are likely to at least occa-
sionally encounter in the office or hospital setting.
Submissionsmustbehigh-qualityphotographsineither
35-mm slide or electronic format. Parent or patient per-
mission to use photographs must accompany the submis-
sion. The discussion should be no more than 750 words.
