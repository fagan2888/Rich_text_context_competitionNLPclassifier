Abstract
Much evidence indicates that men experienced an evolutionary history of physical competition, both one-on-one and in
coalitions. We thus hypothesized that, compared to girls and women, boys and men will possess a greater motivational
predisposition to be interested in sports, especially team sports. According to most scholars, advocacy groups, and the
United States courts, however, this hypothesis is challenged by modest sex differences in organized school sports
participation in the contemporary U.S., where females comprise 42% of high school participants and 43% of intercollegiate
participants. We conducted three studies to test whether organized school sports participation data underestimate the
actual sex difference in sports participation. Study 1 analyzed the American Time Use Survey, which interviewed 112,000
individuals regarding their activities during one day. Females accounted for 51% of exercise (i.e., non-competitive)
participations, 24% of total sports participations, and 20% of team sports participations. These sex differences were similar
for older and younger age groups. Study 2 was based on systematic observations of sports and exercise at 41 public parks in
four states. Females accounted for 37% of exercise participations, 19% of individual sports participations, and 10% of team
sports participations. Study 3 involved surveying colleges and universities about intramural sports, which primarily consist
of undergraduate participation in team sports. Across 34 institutions, females accounted for 26% of registrations. Nine
institutions provided historical data, and these did not indicate that the sex difference is diminishing. Therefore, although
efforts to ensure more equitable access to sports in the U.S. (i.e., Title IX) have produced many benefits, patterns of sports
participation do not challenge the hypothesis of a large sex difference in interest and participation in physical competition.

Introduction
A game can be defined as an organized activity where two or
more sides compete according to agreed-upon rules, and a sport
can be defined as a game that requires physical skill (see [1­3]).
Sports occur in most or all human societies [1,3­6], and numerous
functions have been hypothesized, all of which appear mutually
compatible [1,7]. However, from an evolutionary perspective (i.e.,
linked to survival and reproduction), three hypotheses seem
plausible [7]. First, sports may function as culturally invented
courtship rituals that reliably advertise participant quality to the
opposite sex [8,9]. Second, sports may function as physical
competitions for status, differing from unrestrained combat or
warfare because they reduce the risk of physical harm to
competitors and more publicly and efficiently reveal the compet-
itors' competitive qualities [7,8,10]. Third, sports may function to
build skills necessary for physically-demanding activities, especially
combat, warfare, and hunting [2,11­13]. Although these hypoth-
eses are based on adaptive logic, none require the claim that sports
are an adaptation per se. Instead they assume (or allow) that sports
arise as byproducts of other adaptations, including motives and
capacities to physically compete for mates and status, negotiate
and enforce behavioral norms, and monitor the abilities of
potential competitors, mates and allies.
To the extent that these hypotheses hold, especially the second
and third ones, we further hypothesize that, compared to girls and
women, boys and men will, on average, have a far greater inborn
motivational predisposition to participate in and monitor sports,
especially sports involving combat-relevant skills and/or team
play. This hypothesis follows from the following points. First, many
lines of evidence indicate that throughout human evolutionary
history and during contemporary periods, men have been
substantially more likely than women to engage in contests
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 November 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 11 | e49168
involving extreme physical aggression [14­17], between-group
raiding and warfare [18­20], and cooperative hunting [21,22].
Indeed, many sports require skills relevant for combat or hunting,
such as running, tackling, and throwing or dodging projectiles
[2,6,12]. In addition, some sports involve two teams competing
against each other, with team play often requiring the differen-
tiation of roles, coordination among teammates, and tactical
planning [2,6].
Second, a history of male-male aggression is revealed by
pronounced sexual dimorphism in musculature, strength [23,24],
and speed [25,26]. Similarly, men (but not women) possess
secondary sexual characteristics (e.g., beards, pronounced jaws,
deep voices) that function to threaten rivals [27­30]. Another
legacy of this history is a predisposition(s) to behaviorally prepare
for physical contests, both individually and in groups. This is
indicated by the fact that, in all societies that have been studied,
boys engage in more rough-and-tumble play and play-fighting
[31­35]. Boys are also more likely to form large same-sex groups,
to differentiate roles within such groups, and to seek competition
with other groups [32,36,37]. Moreover, several kinds of evidence
indicate that these sex-differentiated play patterns are due, at least
in part, to boys' typically greater exposure to androgens prior to
birth [38].
Much evidence supports the hypothesis that males are more
predisposed to be interested in sports. First, historical reviews of
sports document that many societies had substantial female
participation, but males are reported as being much more
involved in most or all cases [2,6,39]. Similarly, cross-cultural
ethnographic studies of sports have focused on male sports,
apparently due to their greater prominence (e.g., [3,5,12,13]. In
fact, a recent study found there were more male sports than female
sports in all societies in the Human Relations Area Files
probability sample [40] (see also [41]). Second, studies in large
contemporary societies ubiquitously report greater male interest in
participating, watching, and excelling in sports. Evidence comes
from self-reports of interest (summarized in [16]) and from actual
participation (e.g., [42­44]). Third, several studies have reported
that females with congenital adrenal hyperplasia, a disease
characterized by heightened prenatal androgen exposure, are
more likely than unaffected females to show strong interest in
stereotypically masculine sports [45­47].
It is important to emphasize that this evolutionary hypothesis is
fully compatible with research implicating social influences on
sports interest. For example, adolescent females often experience
great pressure to eschew sports, especially stereotypically mascu-
line sports [48­50]; this can be understood in terms of female
mating competition, which generally emphasizes femininity
[51,52]. Conversely, males may be rewarded for embracing
masculine norms in sports [53­55]; this makes sense given that, for
males, excelling in stereotypically masculine sports is associated
with greater mating success [2,7,56](see also [10,57,58]). Although
the particular patterns of inculcation can be expected to differ
across societies, an evolutionary perspective suggests that social-
ization will generally amplify inborn predispositions associated
with sex [32,59] (see also [60]).
The Challenge of Title IX
Despite the evidence for a greater male than female predispo-
sition for sports interest, a powerful challenge to this hypothesis has
emerged in the form of surging sports participation by girls and
women in some contemporary nations. The most striking example
is in the United States, where female participation in organized
sports has grown steadily over the past four decades. For instance,
in 1972 females comprised 7% of high school athletes, whereas in
2010, they comprised 42% [61]; in NCAA intercollegiate sports,
females comprised 30% of athletes in 1982 and 43% in 2009 [62].
These changes occurred after the enactment in 1972 of a federal
law, known as Title IX, that prohibits sexual discrimination in
educational opportunities, including sports, and that resulted in
the creation of substantially more equitable opportunities and
incentives (e.g., scholarships) for female athletes [63­65].
Most scholars, advocacy groups, and the U.S. courts have
interpreted the substantial participation gains as indicating that
females' sports interest is intrinsically equal to that of males and
that opportunities following in the wake of Title IX merely allowed
females to express their interest. This ``If you build it, they will
come'' logic is the bedrock of current Title IX interpretation and
execution [63­65]. For example, The Women's Sports Foundation, the
United States' most influential organization in advancing ``the
lives of girls and women through sports and physical activity'' has
a section on its website called ``Title IX Myths and Facts'' and it
states:
``MYTH: Girls are not as interested as boys in playing sports.
FACT: The dramatic increase in girls' and women's participation
in sport since Title IX was passed in 1972 (by 545% at the college
level and 979% in high schools) demonstrates that it was lack of
opportunity ­ not lack of interest ­ that kept females out of high
school and college athletics for so many years.'' [66].
The surge in female sports participation in the U.S. is certainly
remarkable. Nevertheless, equal or nearly equal participation in
organized school sports does not necessarily equate with equal or
nearly equal interest in sports. One reason is that, on average, a
participating male, compared to a participating female, may have
a stronger interest in or valuation of sports or may have a stronger
desire to be a sports spectator. Self-report studies conducted in the
U.S. consistently support these suggestions, both for interests [67­
70] and fandom [71­74]. However, counter interpretations have
been offered [65,75,76]. A second reason that organized sports
participation may be misleading is that aspiring male athletes may
be dismissed or ``cut'' from teams more often than their female
counterparts or males may participate substantially more in
unorganized settings, in organized sports programs that are
unaffiliated with schools, or organized sports programs that are
affiliated with colleges and universities but are below the
intercollegiate level (e.g., intramural sports). Similarly, female
participation in organized sports might be more likely to reflect
extrinsic motives (e.g., obtaining a scholarship) than intrinsic
interest. These possibilities have been suggested previously
[77,78], but the evidence offered for them was informal or based
on unpublished studies.
Aims
Here we tested whether, as our evolutionary hypothesis predicts,
the modest sex difference in organized school sports participation
in the U.S. substantially underestimates the sex difference in sports
participation of all kinds (i.e., organized and unorganized; school
affiliated and unaffiliated). By contrast, our evolutionary hypoth-
esis predicts no reliable sex difference in non-competitive physical
activity, which is hereafter called ``exercise.'' To test these
predictions, we conducted three studies: Study 1 was based on
time-use surveys; Study 2 was based on observations at public
parks; Study 3 was based on intramural registrations at colleges
and universities.
These studies also allowed us to test additional predictions of the
evolved male predispositions hypothesis. One is that the sex
difference in participation will be larger for team than individual
sports. This prediction follows because team sports require both
motivation to engage in physical competition and motivation to

engage in cooperative group challenges. Both kinds of motivation
are greater in males [28,32,37,79­81]. However, individual sports
require only the first kind of motivation, whereas team sports
require both, suggesting that the sex difference should be larger for
team sports.
Another prediction of the evolved male predispositions hypoth-
esis is that the sex difference will remain stable over time. The
logic here is that once genuine opportunities were consistently
provided for organized female sports, usually by the 1980s or
1990s, female participation would have been limited by female
interest. Female interest, in turn, would be determined by the
interaction between innate predispositions (e.g., due to prenatal
androgen exposure) and social influences that would be have been
persistently relevant during human evolution history, such as peer
interest and approval [82]. By contrast, informing girls that more
collegiate scholarships will be available for them in 2010s than
were available for their mothers in the early 1990s is not expected
to affect their sports interest. This is because such a change is
abstract, and it only applies to a small proportion of individuals.
We tested the prediction of historical stability in two ways. In
Study 1, we addressed it indirectly, by comparing younger and
older age groups, under the assumption that the sex difference in
sports interest in a given cohort will remain stable. We addressed
this prediction more directly in Study 3, by examining changes in
undergraduate intramural registrations in the 2000s.
Results
Study 1: American Time Use Survey
Study 1 analyzed data from the American Time Use Survey
(ATUS). The ATUS is a large, representative sample of all U.S.
residents 15 years and older that was conducted continuously from
2003­2010 and included responses from 112,000 individuals [83].
Respondents reported all activities, including their durations, that
they performed during the preceding 24-hour period.
Table 1 shows participation rates on a random day for each of
24 activities and for the summed activity types of individual sports,
team sports, and exercise. As predicted, male participation rates
for sports were significantly and substantially higher than female
rates, especially for team sports. In particular, females comprised
28% of those who participated in individual sports and 20% of
those who participated in team sports (ps ,0.0001). There were
significant sex differences in several sports, both individual and
team, and in every case, males participated at higher rates. In
contrast to sports participation, there was no substantial sex
difference for total exercise participation, and, in fact, females
actually comprised 51% of exercise participants. There were

significant sex differences in several exercise activities, with some
showing higher male rates (e.g., biking, weightlifting) and others
showing higher female rates (e.g., walking, aerobics).
Sports and exercise participation rates varied with age (Table 2).
The most striking pattern was that team sports participation was
far higher in younger individuals: among those 15­19 years old,
17% of males and 5% of females participated, but for males over
60 and females over 50, rates were so low that they could not be
reliably estimated. As predicted, despite this variability, the sex
difference in participation for team and individual sports remained
significant and substantial for all age groups. For team sports, the
sex difference was smallest among those 25­29, with females
comprising 23% of participants. For individual sports, the sex
difference was smallest among those 15­19, with females
comprising 33% of participants; females comprised 29­31% of
participants in the other age groups. Exercise participation rates
were comparatively high (i.e., .10% per day) for all age groups.
Male rates were significantly higher than female rates among those
15­19, 20­24, 60­74 and 75+; female rates were significantly
higher among those 30­39 and 40­49. Across all age groups,
females comprised 41­55% of exercise participants.
A potential concern with measuring participation based on rates
playing per day is that females might participate on fewer days but
for longer durations. There were in fact significant sex differences
in participation duration, but it was males, not females, who
participated for longer durations. The sex difference in duration

was 15% for team sports, 24% for individual sports, and 12% for
exercise; these differences were significant (Table 3).
Our predictions did not address educational achievement or
race and ethnicity. Nevertheless, we explored whether these
factors might have affected sports and exercise participation.
Multivariate logistic regression indicated that non-whites, com-
pared to Whites, participated more in team sports but less in
individual sports; in addition, those who did not complete high
school, compared to those graduated high school and those who
obtained education beyond high school, participated more in team
sports but less in individual sports (Table S1). Despite this
variation, within each educational and ethnic group, substantial
sex differences remained for both individual and team sports
(Table S2). Among ethnic groups, the smallest sex difference for
team sports occurred among Whites, where females comprised
25% of participants; the smallest sex difference for individual
sports occurred among Blacks where females comprised 31% of
participants. Among educational groups, the smallest sex differ-
ences occurred among college graduates; females comprised 30%
of participants for individual sports and 28% for team sports.
Study 2: Observations at Public Parks
Study 2 was based on systematic observations of unorganized
sports and exercise participation at public parks in four U.S.
locations: Grand Rapids, Michigan; State College, Pennsylvania;
Tallahassee, Florida, and New Paltz, New York. Observations
occurred in Summer and Fall 2011 and Spring 2012.
We documented a total of 2,879 sports and exercise participa-
tions (Table 4). Females accounted for a minority of participations
for both sports (12%) and exercise (37%), although, as predicted,
the sex difference was significantly greater for sports (x2 (1,
N = 2879) = 140.0, p,.0001). Also as predicted, the sex difference
was significantly greater for team sports (10% female) than
individual sports (19% female) (x2 (1, N = 2552) = 29.7, p,.0001).
The sex difference was significant for all frequently occurring
sports (Table 4). By contrast, there was no significant sex difference
for popular exercise activities, with the exception of skateboarding,
which was done by mainly by males (Table 4).
Participations may not reflect independent decisions to partic-
ipate because people may plan to meet at a park or an individual
might become more likely to participate after observing others
doing so. Thus, a key question is whether the sex difference in
sports will remain strong if we examine the number of groups or
parties, rather than individuals. For individual sports, there were
216 parties, and 7% were female only, 2% were female biased
(more females than males), 16% were unbiased, 5% were male
biased, and 70% were male only. For team sports, there were 389
parties, and 3% were female only, 2% were female biased, 5%
were unbiased, 15% were male biased, and 74% were male only.
Thus, a large majority of sports parties were comprised of more
males than females, both for individual sports (75%; binomial test,
p,.0001) and team sports (89%; p,.0001).
A related issue is the extent to which the sex difference might be
due to males being more comfortable playing in larger groups (see
[36,37,80,84]). We therefore tested whether percentage female
participation decreased as party size increased. In fact, female
percentage of participation was uncorrelated with party size, for
both individual sports (r(214) = .04, p = .57) and team sports
(r(387) = 2.04, p = .38). Thus, females were a consistently small
fraction of participants, in parties ranging from one (10% of 52
participants) to parties of six or more (11% of 1,343 participants).
One consequence of this pattern was that large groups comprised
entirely of females were rare. Specifically, there were only two all-
female groups with six or more individuals, whereas there were 87
all-male groups of this size.
Observations were made by seven researchers at 41 parks,
allowing an examination of the consistency of sex differences
across locations and researchers. Some parks clearly fostered
particular activities. Most notably, 85% of skateboarding partic-
ipations occurred in one park, and 89% of disc golf participations
in another park. Nonetheless, many sports, especially the popular
team sports of soccer and basketball, occurred in many parks, and
the sex difference generally occurred reliably. Most crucially, all
seven researchers documented at least 108 team sports participa-
tions, and all found a large, significant sex difference (Table 5).
Moreover, the four male observers recorded essentially the same
percentage of female participants in team sports (M = 11.9) as the
three female observers (M = 11.6; t (5) = .18, p = .91). Similarly, the
two researchers (one male, one female) who were blind to the
hypothesis of a sex difference recorded a percentage of female
participants in team sports (M = 12.6) that did not differ from that
documented by the other researchers (M = 11.4.; t(5) = .42,
p = .69).
Researchers could only broadly estimate participants' ages.
Nonetheless, these estimates indicated that the sex differences
(Table 4) held across age groups, at least for age groups with many
observations (Table 6).

generally played by an undergraduate, usually between 18 and 24
years of age, who does not play the sport at the intercollegiate
varsity level. There are generally no extrinsic incentives (e.g.,
substantial prizes or publicity) for intramurals, so they should
provide a reliable indicator of intrinsic motivation to participate.
Most intramural registrations entail playing a series of games (e.g.,
a six game season occurring over an academic semester). Data
were from 2010 and 2011.
Thirty-four institutions provided information (see Methods) on
total male and female intramural registrations, and females
accounted for 26% of total registrations across all institutions
and sports. This pattern held across institutions, as the median
value was 28%, and the sex difference was significant at every
institution (Table 7). In fact, there was not a single institution
where females reached 43% of registrations, the female percentage
of participation across all NCAA intercollegiate sports [62].
Twenty-seven institutions provided information regarding
registrations for specific sports (Table 8). Fewer than 4% of
registrations were for individual sports, the most popular of which
were tennis (0.8% of all specific registrations), bowling (0.7%),
running (0.5%), golf (0.4%), and racquetball (0.3%). Across these
27 institutions, females accounted for 31% of individual sports
registrations, whereas they accounted for 26% of team sports
registrations, a significant difference (x2 (1, N = 175697) = 68.1,
p,.0001). The greater sex difference in team than in individual
sports occurred at 13 of the 23 institutions where individual sports
occurred, and this difference was significant in nine cases (p,.05
for each). Of the 10 institutions where, contrary to our hypothesis,
the sex difference was greater in individual than in team sports, the
difference was significant in five cases.
The most popular team sports were football (20% of all specific
registrations), soccer (20%), basketball (19%), softball (16%), and
volleyball (13%). Females did not account for the majority of
registrations in any of these popular sports, although they came
close in volleyball (football: 16%; soccer: 29%; basketball: 20%;
softball: 27%; volleyball: 48%). These patterns were fairly
consistent across institutions, with males being a significant
majority of registrants at most institutions for all popular sports,
with the exception of volleyball (Table 8).
An interesting question is whether female sports participation is
depressed due to the presence of male competitors. Intramural
data are useful for addressing this because, at most institutions,
team sports mainly involve single-sex competition (M = 71% of
teams were single-sex rather than co-ed; SD = 5.5%; n = 10
institutions). Eight institutions provided data on single-sex
registration for popular sports. In this context, females comprised
a modest percentage of participants (football: 20% of single-sex
registrations by females; soccer: 24%; basketball: 20%; softball:
15%; volleyball: 45%).
Intramural registrations generally involve playing in a series of
games over a semester. It is therefore possible that registration
might underestimate relative female participation because, for any
given registration, females might participate more frequently. Five
institutions provided information on participations per registration
separately for males and females. In all five cases, however, males
participated at greater rates (University of Toledo: 11% greater
male participation per registration; University of Nevada, Las
Vegas: 17%; Boise State University: 22%; Fort Lewis College:
44%; Southern Methodist University: 98%). In fact, if the median
difference in participation rate (i.e., 22%) is extrapolated to all 34

institutions in Table 7, it suggests that females account for 26% of
intramural registrations but only 22% of intramural participations.
Another concern is that perhaps there are more males than
females at the institutions in our sample, and this might be partly
responsible for the large sex difference. However, across all
institutions, females comprised 52% of undergraduates, and there
were more female than male undergraduates at 24 of 34
institutions (Table 7). This pattern further indicates that the sex
difference in registrations underestimates the sex difference in
individual participation rates.
A crucial question is whether the sex difference in sports
participation is decreasing historically. We were able to address
this question because nine institutions provided at least five years
of intramural data, some on total male and female participations
and others on unique male and female participations (i.e., each
individual counts once regardless of how many sports they play
over the entire academic year). As shown in Table 9, at all nine
institutions, the percentage of female intramural registration was
similar in the last year of available data, usually 2010­2011, as it
was in the preceding years. By this measure, seven institutions
showed decreasing female registration and two showed increasing
female registration. Similarly, correlations between year and
percentage of female registration were negative at five institutions
and positive at four institutions; none was significant, perhaps due
to small size (Table 9). To increase statistical power, we used a
general linear model to incorporate data from all institutions:
percent female registration was significantly predicted by institu-
tion (F (8,55) = 21.6; p,.0001) but not by year (F (1,55) = 0.57;
p = .45). In fact, the parameter estimate for year was negative
(b = -.06), indicating a very slight decrease in female registration.

and boys possess an evolved predisposition to be interested in
competitive physical activities, including sports. That males have
apparently participated and monitored sports more often than
females in most or all societies supports this hypothesis, but surging
female participation in organized school sports in the contempo-
rary U.S. challenges it. The three studies reported here, however,
demonstrate that organized school sports participation substan-
tially underestimates the sex difference. Specifically, females
comprise approximately 42% of high school athletes and 43% of
collegiate athletes, but they comprise only 24% of those who
report playing sports on a given day (Study 1), 12% of those
playing sports in public parks (Study 2), and 26% of those who
register for collegiate intramural sports (Study 3). Even these
percentages somewhat underestimate the sex difference because
males play for longer durations (Study 1) and play more frequently
per intramural registration (Study 3).
In addition, as predicted from our evolutionary framework, the
sex difference in sports participation was greater for team than
individual sports. This result was clear in Study 1 and Study 2.
Study 3 also found a greater sex difference for team than for
individual sports, although the difference was not consistent across
institutions, perhaps owing to the fact that intramurals at most
institutions rarely involve individual sports.
In contrast to both individual and team sports, the sex difference
in exercise was unreliable (Study 1) or modest (Study 2). The
exercise results indicate that both males and females are motivated
to be physically active, but that males are generally more
interested in pursuing this in a competitive way (see [85­89]).
Although our findings contradict the popular claim that there is
no substantial sex difference in sports interest [63­65], they are in
agreement with previous empirical studies of sports participation.
Whether measuring duration or frequency, these studies consis-
tently find that males play sports, especially team sports, at least
twice as much females do, and often much more frequently. This is
the case with children in Australia [90], teens in Canada [91],
children in Denmark [92], teens and adults in England [44], and
children, teens and adults in Ireland [43].
Also paralleling the present study, when studies report non-
competitive physical activity or exercise, they indicate minimal sex
differences [43,44,90]. Other studies that measured overall
physical activity (sports and exercise combined) in large societies
also report modest differences [93,94], sometimes with females
participating more [95]. Finally, earlier studies of sports partici-
pation among children and teens in the U.S. (with modest, non-
representative samples) reported that males play sports more than
twice as often as females [96,97].
Potential Limitations
Each of our three studies has potential limitations, yet none
seriously challenge our conclusions. One possible limitation of
Study 1 is that self-reports of physical activity typically show only
low to moderate criterion validity, especially when based on
retrospective queries [98]. However, the methods used in time use
surveys, such as the ATUS, have been specifically designed to
minimize distortions [83]. More importantly, we obtained
converging results in Study 2 and Study 3, and they were based
on behavioral measures. A second potential limitation of Study 1 is
that the size of the age group cohorts was modest given daily sports
participation rates. For example, in the 20­24 age group, there
were 5,189 respondents, and the participation rates indicate that
only about 460 individuals would have reported playing sports on
the previous day. However, there was a highly similar sex
difference in Study 3, which included over 500,000 intramural
registrations.
Another limitation of Study 1 is that, because there were no
ATUS codes for them, we could not include the high school sports
of water polo, lacrosse, swimming and diving, or competitive
cheerleading [61]. Water polo and lacrosse have greater male than
female participation (water polo: 47% female participation;
lacrosse: 43%) and were probably not included in the ATUS
because they are played much less than most other sports (see
Methods for sports popularity). Thus, their inclusion seems
unlikely to have substantially affected our results. Swimming and
diving, however, is a moderately popular sport and females
constitute 55% of participants. Therefore, the sex difference in
individual sport participation in the present study is likely to be
somewhat of an overestimate. Finally, competitive cheerleading is
almost exclusively done by females (98%), and is moderately
popular. However, although it meets our technical definition of a
sport, competitive cheerleading is unusual because it is the only
popular ``genuine'' team sport (see Methods) whose outcome
depends exclusively on judging, not direct competition between
simultaneously competing teams. Moreover, it is the only major
high school sport that is not an NCAA intercollegiate sport. Thus,
although including competitive cheerleading would somewhat
decrease the sex difference in team sports participation, it is not
clear that including it is desirable, at least with regards to testing
the evolved predispositions hypothesis.
Study 2 was potentially limited by the fact it was based on
convenience sampling, meaning that is possible that other, more
representative public parks would not show a pronounced sex
difference in sports participation. For several reasons, though, this
possibility seems highly unlikely. First, we know of no bias in our
sample, and all seven researchers independently documented a
large sex difference in team sports participation. Indeed, we are
unaware of any credible report of an area in the U.S. where
females consistently play sports in public areas at rates similar to
males. Second, Study 1 was based on a nationally representative
sample, and it indicated the sex difference occurred for all
educational and ethnic groups. Similarly, Study 3 found the sex
difference across a broad sample of colleges and universities.
Study 3 might be viewed as limited because it focused on
intramural sports, which are played mainly by undergraduates in
their late teens and early 20s. In fact, this was an ideal sample for
rigorously testing our main prediction. As revealed in Study 1,
most sports, especially team sports, are played by those 24 years
and younger. In addition, because participation rates in organized
school sports are roughly 18 times greater in high school than in
college [99], it might be more difficult to assess intrinsic motivation
in high school students because much of their sports participation
might be linked to preparing for organized school competition.
Furthermore, women seeking college degrees might be expected to
show greater sports interest than other women because there
apparently are reciprocal relationships between education and
sports [100­102].
Participation and Interest
The evolved male predispositions hypothesis assumes that the
large sex difference in sports participation reflects a large sex
difference in sports interest. Is this assumption valid? It is a truism
that many individuals with a strong interest in sports (or other
activities) might not participate owing to lack of time, access to
facilities, or other constraints. Although constraints on females'
sports participation must be greater than the constraints on males
in some cases, for at least three reasons, this seems inadequate as a
general explanation for females' lower participation.
First, although females, especially girls, may have less time for
sports and leisure in most societies [103], lack of time is not a

plausible explanation for our results. The reason is that in Study 1
females spent nearly as much time as males in total physical
activity; the key difference was that the proportion of time females
spent on sports, especially team sports, was much less. In
particular, for males 15% of their physical activities involved
team sports and 10% involved individual sports; for females 4%
involved team sports and 5% involved individual sports. Other
studies also indicate that the sex difference in sports participation
partly reflects females giving higher priority to other recreational
and extracurricular activities [104,105].
Second, that females do not play sports as much as males
because they lack facilities or opportunities also seems unlikely, at
least as a general explanation. This is illustrated by soccer and
basketball, the two most frequently played team sports in the U.S.
These sports require minimal equipment and facilities, and on
school teams, female participation is almost as high as male
participation [61,62]. Yet all three studies reported here find that
males play these sports more than three times as much as females
do. This pattern even held for single-sex collegiate intramurals,
showing that females' relatively low participation cannot be
ascribed to the presence of male competitors. Finally, if constraints
were a major factor, then females' self-reported desire to
participate and excel in sports would be equal to males', and
studies consistently contradict this [67­70].
Temporal Convergence
The present findings, together with questionnaire studies,
demonstrate that there is a substantial sex difference in sports
interest even in the contemporary U.S., a society where there is
consensus that great progress has been made in equalizing
organized school sports opportunities [63­65,106]. Nonetheless,
proponents of the ``no intrinsic differences'' view might contend
that it has been only 40 years since Title IX was passed, and that
this legislation was not effectively implemented during some of
these years [64]. Thus, although there is a large sex difference now
in sports interests, this difference might be waning.
Although the time depth was limited, Study 39s analysis of
temporal changes in intramural participation at nine institutions
does not support the claim of convergence. Similarly, Study 1
compared older and younger groups with the ATUS and found no
indication that younger women, who grew up with Title IX being
better enforced, participate at relatively greater rates. Testing for
changes over time with the ATUS would also be valuable, but we
could not do so here because preliminary analyses indicated that,
because of modest sample sizes, yearly sports participation
estimates were highly unstable.
Another set of studies addressed historical convergence in a less
direct fashion, focusing on sex differences in willingness to train
competitively in distance running. Deaner [85,107,108] showed
that, although the number females that participate in distance
running in the U.S. has grown steadily since the 1970s, so that
there is no longer a sex difference in participation, there are still
roughly three times as many males that run fast relative to sex-
specific world class standards. For example, in a typical local 5 K
road race with equal male and female participation, for every
female that finishes within 25% of the female world record, there
are roughly three males that finish within 25% of the male world
record. This pattern holds robustly for elite runners and non-elite
(i.e., recreational) runners, and tests reveal no indication that the
sex difference in the number of relatively fast performers has
diminished over the past few decades. Because relative running
performance is an equally strong predictor of training volume (e.g.,
kilometers/week) in men and women [109], these patterns indicate
that the sex difference in willingness to train competitively is large
and stable [85,107,108]. Apparently, the large increase in female
runners has mainly involved those who run for non-competitive
reasons; most competitive females were already competing by the
1980s or early 1990s.
We hope that other measures of sports participation and interest
can be identified that will allow assessments of temporal change.
Similarly, it should be possible to revisit this issue in the future,
after Title IX has had another generation or two to take effect.
Nonetheless, for now, the hypothesis that the sex difference in
sports interest is in the process of converging must be viewed as
lacking empirical support.
Alternative Explanations
Another argument that might be raised in defense of the ``no
intrinsic differences'' view is that the changes produced by Title
IX­changes focused on opportunities and incentives in organized
school sports­are insufficient to catalyze female sports interest. For
example, compared to boys, girls may still receive less childhood
sports encouragement [110] or lack role models of professional
athletes (see [111,112]). Although these and related hypotheses
certainly warrant attention, it is difficult to conceive of practical
methods for assessing them, particularly because individuals and
their environments interact. In the case of sports encouragement,
for instance, parents may be less likely to enroll their daughters in
soccer leagues, but this may reflect that fewer young girls than
boys express interest in this sort of activity [36,113].
Similarly, the fact that there are far fewer women than men who
earn their livelihoods playing sports can be viewed as an effect,
rather than a cause, of lesser female sports interest. For example,
the premier men's basketball league in the U.S., the National
Basketball Association (NBA), has sponsored a women's profes-
sional league (WNBA) since 1997, and the attendance and
viewership is a small fraction of the NBA's and has not grown
[114]. Similarly, in the late 1990s a magazine was launched called
Sports Illustrated Women (SI Women). SI Women was targeted to
appeal to girls and women who wanted follow high-level women's
sports in the way that Sports Illustrated caters to the interests of
male sports fans. However, publication of SI Women ceased in
2002 because there was not a market to support it [115,116].
Other magazines focusing on elite female athletes have also failed
to gain large readerships [115].
Finally, in considering the argument that Title IX might not be
sufficient to substantially spur female sports interest, it is worth
noting that this argument contradicts the claims of many scholars
and the U.S. courts. The courts, in particular, have been clear that
one of Title IX's main purposes is to produce equal sports
opportunities in schools and that doing this will, by itself, be
sufficient to eventually produce equal sports interest [63­65].
Conclusions
Our findings support the hypothesis of an evolved male
predisposition for physical competition­one that manifests in
contemporary societies as greater participation of males in sports.
Two points about this hypothesis must be stressed, however. First,
as noted in the Introduction, we do not claim that sports interest is
entirely driven by an evolutionary history of male-male compe-
tition and the proximate effects of sex hormones. On the contrary,
sports interest is influenced by societal gender roles, parents, peers,
and the like, and such factors likely contribute to variation across
individuals and societies [48­50,53­55,110]. In fact, as previous
scholars have shown, evolutionary theory is fully compatible with
substantial cross-societal variation in human sex differences
[32,59,117­119], and sports participation is no exception.
Nonetheless, the evolved male predispositions hypothesis does
Males Play Sports Much More than Females in U.S.

predict that males will, on average, be more interested in physical
competition, and thus sports, in all or nearly all societies. A recent
study illustrated these points: it found more male than female
sports in all societies in the Human Relations Area Files
probability sample, yet the sex difference was typically greater in
patriarchal than in non-patriarchal societies [40].
Our final point is that a greater male predisposition for sports
interest does not contradict most arguments made by Title IX
proponents. Most notably, it is indisputable that, prior to Title IX,
girls and women in the U.S. generally had vastly inferior sports
resources and opportunities than boys and men, that sports and
exercise can provide substantial benefits for girls and women, that
strong moral arguments exist for ensuring that males and females
enjoy equal sporting opportunities, and that Title IX has had
many positive effects. Nevertheless, our results do suggest that it
may be a mistake to base Title IX implementation on the
assumption that males and females have, or soon will have,
generally equal sports interest.
Materials and Methods
Study 1
The American Time Use Survey (ATUS) is a survey of the use
of time among the civilian, non-institutionalized population aged
15 years and older conducted by the U.S. Bureau of Labor
Statistics and the U.S Census Bureau [83]. The sample represents
a stratified random subsample drawn from a panel of households
that completed participation in the Current Population Survey
(CPS), a federal survey that provides the national unemployment
rate. A single person from each household that was selected from
the CPS panel was interviewed by telephone about use of personal
time on a single, pre-assigned reporting day. Interviewers asked
respondents to report all activities that were performed during the
24-hour period beginning at 4:00 am on the day before the
interview and ending at 3:59 am on the day of the interview.
Respondents were given the opportunity to report spontaneously
recalled activities, the times of day that activities started and ended
or one time of day and how long that activity lasted. Verbatim
responses to activities reported in the interview were later coded by
two interviewers into .400 categories including 25 sports and
exercise activities described below. Households without telephones
were encouraged to respond by mailing them a $40 debit card that
could be activated if they called in to complete the survey. The
ATUS is a free public use data set [120].
Annual sample sizes ranged from 12,248 in 2007 to 20,720 in
2003, though after 2003 the target was 13,000 completed
interviews [83]. Response rates of persons selected from the CPS
panel ranged from a low of 52.5% in 2007 to a high of 57.8% in
2003. For the current study, we analyzed data from all 112,038
persons aged 15 years and older who were surveyed between 2003
and 2010. In total, the ATUS interviewed 48,687 males and
63,351 females aged 15 to 99 years, including 7,624 15- to 19-
year-olds (3,753 females and 3,871 males) and 5,189 adults aged
20 to 24 years (2,953 women, 2,236 men). Seventy percent were
White, 13% were Black, 13% were Hispanic or Latino and 4%
were other race or multi-racial. Thirty percent were college
graduates, 17% had less than high school education, and the rest
were high school graduates or had some college or technical school
education.
We focused on sports with moderate to high participation rates
in U.S. high schools. These were defined as sports that were played
by more than 20,000 total girls and boys in 2009 [61]. These
sports are: baseball (about 473,000 or 473 K participants),
basketball (980 K), bowling (53 K), competitive cheerleading
(126 K), cross country (442 K), field hockey (64 K), (American)
football (1132 K), golf (229 K), gymnastics (21 K), ice hockey
(45 K), lacrosse (159 K), soccer (748 K), softball (394 K), swim-
ming and diving (290 K), tennis (345 K), track and field (1169 K),
volleyball (454 K), water polo (39 K), and wrestling (279 K). We
focused on high school sports rather than collegiate sports because
high school sports participation is roughly 18 times greater [99].
Unfortunately, the ATUS lexicon did not correspond with the
high school sports in several ways. First, there were no ATUS
codes for swimming and diving, water polo, lacrosse, or
competitive cheerleading [121], so these sports could not be
assessed. Second, the ATUS had no code for tennis, although it
did have a code for racquet sports, which we used because it
encompasses and largely consists of tennis. Third, the ATUS code
for hockey did not distinguish ice hockey and field hockey, so we
used that code and assessed both kinds of hockey together. Fourth,
we used the ATUS code for running because there were no codes
for cross-country or track and field.
We defined exercise activities as ones apparently undertaken
primarily for physical fitness rather than competition. We selected
these based on their availability in the ATUS lexicon [121] and
their popularity in the U.S. [93]. Exercise activities were aerobics,
biking, dancing, hiking, rollerblading, running, cardio, walking,
water sports, weightlifting/strength training, working out (unspec-
ified), and yoga. We classified running as an exercise rather than a
sport because studies of distance running find that most runners'
self-reported motivation and training is consistent with a non-
competitive orientation [89,122]. Although respondents could self-
report participating in ``caving, spelunking or climbing,'' the
prevalence of this exercise category was too low to report
separately for males and females.
We classified sports as individual sports or team sports. We
classified bowling, golf, gymnastics, racquet sports, and wrestling
as individual sports despite the fact that these sports can involve
team competition (and generally do in U.S. high schools). We did
so because an individual's performance in these sports depends
almost on entirely on their own efforts, rather than coordinated
efforts with their teammates, a point revealed by the fact that these
sports invariably include individual championships. By contrast, in
``genuine'' team sports, individuals may garner awards (e.g., ``all
star''), but there are no individual championships. We classified
baseball, basketball, hockey, football, soccer, softball, and volley-
ball as team sports.
ATUS respondents were classified as having (or not having)
participated in an activity on the recalled day for each of the 25
identified activities, for each of the three groups of activities (i.e.,
team sports, individual sports, and exercise), and for either
individual or team sports. In addition, among those who
participated in an activity group, we obtained their total minutes
of participation.
We used tests of equality of proportions to assess the statistical
significance of sex differences. We used multivariate logistic
regressions to assess the effects of demographic characteristics on
participation in team and individual sports. All analyses were
weighted and, for the prevalence estimates, confidence intervals
were computed from estimates of total variance according to
methods used for the Current Population Survey [123]. For
analysis, we used SAS version 9.1 (Cary, NC, 2003).

Males Play Sports Much More than Females in U.S.
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 11 November 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 11 | e49168
Each researcher was instructed to initially identify public parks
where unorganized sports were often played. Each park was
required to have at least one of the following: basketball court,
tennis court, grass field or turf field. Parks might include other
facilities such as a running track, handball courts, horseshoe pit,
disc golf course, or skateboarding ramp. Researchers were
instructed to avoid parks with pools, lakes, or other areas allowing
aquatic sports. Because this study focused on sports, not exercise,
researchers were also instructed to avoid trails where people walk,
run, bike, or rollerblade. Parks often included distinctive areas for
potential sports play (e.g., basketball court, softball diamond); these
areas were considered part of the same park so as long as the
researcher could visually monitor all areas simultaneously and
there was no street dividing the areas. Parks could include the
grounds of public schools so long as the schools were not in session.
University gyms, sports clubs, and other non-public areas were not
included.
Parks were selected based on the apparent occurrence of sports
and researchers' convenience in visiting them, which usually
meant they were in the same geographical area. Each researcher
was asked to identify a ``circuit'' of five to twelve parks, although
sometimes circuits were smaller due to a researcher's transporta-
tion limitations or because there were few local parks. Researchers'
circuits generally did not include common parks, although EF
made twelve observations (45 participations) at one of ROD's
main parks (194 participations). Once researchers began observa-
tions, they did not add parks to their circuits, although they
stopped visiting parks where they repeatedly observed no sports.
The locations of the park circuits were fairly diverse: in Grand
Rapids, Michigan, two circuits (RD's, EF's) occurred within the
city, whereas another occurred in suburban towns west of the city
(DB's); in State College, Pennsylvania, a college town, the two
circuits occurred within the city; in New Paltz, New York, a small
college town, the circuit consisted of the single suitable public park;
in Tallahassee, Florida, the circuit occurred within the city.
Observers were aware of the sex difference hypothesis with the
exception of the two observers in Pennsylvania who neither knew
nor suspected that this study was focused on sex differences.
At times when sports participation seemed likely, such as early
evenings or weekends when the weather was good, researchers
would deliberately visit all parks in their circuit. To avoid bias,
researchers did not make observations opportunistically, such as
upon noticing sports being played when they were driving by a
park. Researchers often completed their circuit several times per
week but not more than once per day. No attempt was made to
avoid repeated observation of the same individuals on different
days. This could not be done reliably. Furthermore, participation
frequency is actually a good measure for addressing the hypotheses
of interest.
Upon arrival at a park, the researcher would document all
instances of exercise or sports that were currently occurring (i.e.,
instantaneous time sampling [124]). Activities were counted as
occurring if individuals were taking a brief recess related to the
activity (e.g., choosing teams, drinking fluids, tying shoes).
However, in such cases, individuals were counted as participating
only if they resumed participation with three minutes of the
researcher's arrival. To avoid bias, researchers did not wait at
parks for activities to be initiated.
We classified activities as sports or exercise based on Study 1.
Because of their similarities with other sports and because they met
our definition, the following activities were also classified as sports:
ultimate frisbee (147 total participations), disc golf (129), muggle
quidditch (24), horseshoes (22), lacrosse (19), wiffleball (17), and
kickball (8). The following were also classified as exercise:
skateboarding (65), hackeysack (12), riding scooters (6), non-
combative martial arts (4), and hula-hooping (1). We classified
sports as individual sports or team sports based on Study 1.
Some instances of sport participation involved practice rather
than competition. Examples include playing catch with a baseball
or football, practicing shooting in basketball or soccer, or hitting a
tennis ball against a backboard. We classified this kind of activity
as sports participation, on the assumption that it is generally
undertaken to improve one's ability to compete in a sport.
We classified instances of sports participation as organized or
unorganized. We defined organized sports as those that are
directed by individuals besides the participants. Examples include
high school sports, collegiate sports, club sports, intramural sports,
recreational leagues, and training sessions organized by coaches.
Researchers did not interact with participants and so did not ask
sports participants if there was an organizing body or agent
directing their play. Instead, researchers categorized participation
as organized if they saw evidence of any of the following: uniforms,
referees, judges, coaches, or formal leadership (e.g., team captains
directing practice). We did not present data on organized
participation in the Results section because there were relatively
few organized sports parties observed (83) but most were large
(M = 19.4 individuals), meaning that random error could substan-
tially affect the results. Overall, females accounted for 25% of
organized sports participants.
The data collection protocol was designed to promote
reliability. ROD and EF tested this by simultaneously and
independently collecting data on two evenings. Reliability was
high for sex (Cohen's k = .99; n = 169), age group (k = .95;
n = 169), party exercise/activity classification (k = .90; n = 22),
and party organized/unorganized sport classification (k = .90;
n = 22).
Study 3
Ethics statement. This study involved surveying intramural
organizers/administrators at colleges and universities. They
voluntarily reported institutional data about demographic patterns
of participation at their institution. They provided no data
regarding individuals, meaning that this study did not technically
include ``human subjects'' and thus did not require IRB approval.
We requested data from institutions that play football in the
NCAA Division I (D1) Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) or in
NCAA Division 2 (D2). We searched the website of each
institution for an individual who was identified the primary
intramural organizer. We identified such an individual at 74 of
120 D1 institutions and 73 of 151 D2 institutions. We then
contacted these individuals by email; for D1 institutions, we did
this in late October and early November 2011; for D2 institutions
we did this in March 2012. We explained that we were conducting
a study of intramural sports participation to assess which sports are
most popular for men and women in different regions of the
United States. We asked which sports were offered as intramurals
at their institution, how many men and women registered or
participated in each sport and in all sports combined, and whether
each sport was offered as co-ed, single sex, or both. We requested
data regarding the past year and any previous years. If we received
no response, we sent one additional request about one week later.
Of the 74 D1 institutions, 36 responded but several did not
provide useful data (e.g., they did not distinguish male and female
registration); 19 provided data on overall sex differences in
registration of all kinds, single sex and co-ed together (Table 7),
five institutions provided data on male and female single-sex
registrations (University of Louisville, University of Mississippi,
University of Notre Dame, Wake Forest University, Western
Males Play Sports Much More than Females in U.S.
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 12 November 2012 | Volume 7 | Issue 11 | e49168
Michigan University); University of Nevada, Las Vegas provided
both kinds of information. Of the 73 D2 institutions, 29
responded; 15 provided data on overall sex differences in
registration of all kinds (Table 7); Millersville University provided
data on male and female single-sex registrations; Shippensburg
University provided data on both.
Our primary measure of participation was registration, and one
individual could register for several sports each year. If we had
focused on unique participants, the sex difference would have been
substantially smaller. However, total participations was the
appropriate measure for the current study, which aimed to
measure participation frequency, not simply its occurrence.
Although institutions provided us with the absolute number of
male and female registrants, we focused on the percentage of
registrants that were female, rather than assessing what factors
explained absolute variation in male or female registration across
institutions. It was inappropriate to make direct registration
comparisons across institutions because they varied widely in their
menu of sports offered, duration of playing season, participation
fees, and other factors.
Some institutions provided only total male and female
registrations but, in most cases, they provided information for
each sport, sometimes more than 30 in total. Whenever
information was available for each sport, we retained it so that
we could assess the popularity of particular sports (see Results
above). In addition, considering specific sports allowed us to
remove some that did not meet the anthropological definition of
sport provided at the outset of the paper (i.e., we excluded games
that did not involve physical skill). Among those excluded were
poker, ``NCAA tournament bracket challenge'', ``chili cookoff'',
``rock paper scissors'', and trivia games. We also removed video
games, despite that they might meet the definition of sport;
including them would have very slightly increased the sex
difference reported in this study. We combined different variations
of the same general sport (e.g., outdoor and indoor soccer). In
classifying sports as individual or team, we focused on each
activity's typical form of play so that, for example, doubles tennis
was classified as tennis and thus as an individual sport. Some
intramurals were described as tournaments, meaning play usually
occurred during one or a few days. We generally counted
tournaments in participation unless no information was provided
on participants' sex, which was the case at Texas A&M University
and Northwestern University. Data were generally from the 2010­
2011 academic year, although, in a few cases, they were only from
Fall 2011. We obtained data on institutional enrollments from the
National Center for Education Statistics [125].
Historical analyses were based only on institutions that provided
at least five years of data. Furthermore, we required that the data
be based on similar methods of data collection and a similar menu
of intramural options. In particular, at one institution, the number
of intramural registrations doubled from one year to the next,
suggesting that yearly comparisons would be unwarranted. Some
institutions provided yearly data summaries that were not strictly
comparable to ones shown in Table 7, which were based on 2010­
2011. For example, one institution apparently provided historical
data on unique registrations, not total registrations.
