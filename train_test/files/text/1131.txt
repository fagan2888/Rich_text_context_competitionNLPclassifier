How Many Deaf People Are There in the United States?
Estimates From the Survey of Income and Program
Participation

The Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) is
one of a few national surveys that regularly collects data
identifying the American population of persons with hearing
loss or deafness. Estimates from the SIPP indicate that fewer
than 1 in 20 Americans are currently deaf or hard of hearing.
In round numbers, nearly 10,000,000 persons are hard of
hearing and close to 1,000,000 are functionally deaf. More
than half of all persons with hearing loss or deafness are
65 years or older and less than 4% are under 18 years of
age. However, these findings are limited to those who report
difficulty hearing ``normal conversation'' and do not include
the larger population of persons with hearing loss for which
only hearing outside the range and circumstances of normal
conversation is affected. Policy makers, communications
technology manufacturers, health and education service
providers, researchers, and advocacy organizations have an
interest in these results.
The federal government has been the sole source or
vehicle for the collection of national data on the de-
mography of deafness in the United States. From 1830
to 1930, the decennial census of the United States
included the enumeration of deaf persons. However,
because it was clear that the census was not getting
reliable counts, questions about deafness were dropped
(Best, 1943; Schein & Delk, 1974). Not until 1957,
when the first national Health Interview Survey was
conducted, did the U.S. Bureau of the Census, as the
contract agent of the U.S. Public Health Service,
resume annual collection of data on hearing loss and
deafness in the population (Botman, Moore, Moriarty, &
Parsons, 2000; National Center for Health Statistics,
1963; Schein & Delk, 1974).
Since the implementation of the Health Interview
Survey, now known as the National Health Interview
Survey (NHIS), additional projects that include the
regular collection of data on hearing loss and deafness
in the United States have been initiated. These in-
clude the periodic National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey, initiated by the U.S. Public
Health Service in 1959 (e.g., National Center for
Health Statistics, 1963, 1964), the one-time-only
National Census of the Deaf Population, sponsored
by a Social and Rehabilitation Service grant to the
National Association of the Deaf in 1969 and which
heavily depended on cooperation with the 1971
Health Interview Survey and the 1971 Annual Survey
of Hearing Impaired Children and Youth (Schein &
Delk, 1974), and the annual Survey of Income and
Program Participation (SIPP), implemented by the
U.S. Bureau of the Census beginning in 1983 (e.g.,
U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1986). This article pro-
vides estimates of the size and age distribution of the
American population of persons with hearing loss or
deafness based upon data collected from the most
recent SIPP.

The Problem of Who Counts as Deaf
In the process of identification and enumeration of
deaf persons, or any other particular group within
the population, at least four constraints are encoun-
tered: the context of the inquiry, the indicators used to
establish group membership, the methods employed
to collect indicator data, and the resources available
to execute the project. The SIPP originated as a project
of the Social Security Administration in the 1970s
(U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1986). The survey is
designed to help determine how various personal
and social conditions affect the level and stability of
personal and household economic well-being in the
United States. The rehabilitation model (see, e.g.,
O'Brien, 2001), where functional impairment is to be
overcome in order to mitigate conditions that would
be disabling or otherwise cause difficulties, underlies
the SIPP inquiries about deafness and hearing loss
(Maag & Wittenburg, 2003).
Precisely how questions about hearing loss and
deafness are phrased strongly influences who is
counted and who is excluded from the count during
the enumeration process. This sensitivity to the selec-
tion of indicators is a critical issue for researchers,
policy makers, businesses, educators, providers of
health and social services, and other interested groups
or consumers of research findings. The demography of
deafness in the United States based upon the SIPP
does not provide the same profile as that obtained
from, say, the NHIS because hearing loss and deafness
are not defined identically across surveys (see, e.g.,
Lucas, Schiller, & Benson, 2004; note that estimates
for the number of persons with hearing loss from the
NHIS are appreciably larger than those from the SIPP
due, in part, to differences in how questions are
phrased). Here, careful attention is given to who is
being identified as a person with hearing loss or deaf-
ness in the SIPP.
At its most basic level, demographic analysis is about
studying changes in the size, growth rate, and composi-
tion of a population. It is important to remember that
no matter how a population is defined, there are
only two ways of entering it: being born into it; or
migrating into it. If the definition of the popula-
tion includes a social element in addition to the
customary geographic/temporal elements, the
``migration'' can include a change in the social
label, a process often referred to as ``social mobil-
ity.'' (Preston, Heuveline, & Guillot, 2001, p. 2)
On the surface, it seems perfectly straightforward
to talk about enumerating or estimating the size of the
population of persons in the United States with hear-
ing loss or deafness. Ostensibly, one would simply use
some agreed-upon measures to identify such attributes
as the cause of and age at which individuals first ex-
perienced hearing loss or deafness (or when and how
their hearing was restored or augmented). At the def-
initional level, however, the demography of deafness
becomes problematic when it is recognized that deaf-
ness is not only an audiological condition but also
a social label. Migration is not simply a matter of mov-
ing in or out of the United States (geography) or when
a person began to lose or regain hearing (a temporal
concern beyond date of birth or migration); there is
also social mobility. Here, this does not refer to social
class or economic mobility, though such employment,
education, and earnings differences certainly do exist
(e.g., Barnartt & Christiansen, 1996; McNeil, 2001).
Social mobility refers to how affiliation and group
membership can change, in this case, depending on
how individuals and those around them respond to
their hearing loss. The most prominent behavioral
distinction affecting which social label is applied to
persons experiencing deafness is the use of a signed
versus a spoken language across a variety of social
settings (Mitchell & Karchmer, 2004). Those who
identify and organize as a formal or informal associa-
tion of the Deaf emphasize the centrality of signing,
whereas those who take the label Hard of Hearing
focus on speech. Differing perspectives on how a
person's deafness is defined affect who is labeled
deaf, hard of hearing, or as a person with hearing loss
and, therefore, who is counted as among their number.
Typical of surveys of hearing loss or deafness,
when attempting to distinguish among those who are
hearing, hard of hearing, or deaf, the SIPP asks how
well a person can hear human speech (see, e.g., Schein,
1989) or, more precisely, ``normal conversation.'' The
SIPP asks each individual (age 15 or older) or infor-
mant (responding for children aged 6 to 14 years, as
Endnotes 113
well as some older persons) to respond to the following
two questions (U.S. Census Bureau, 2001a, Questions
ADQ6 and ADQ7; U.S. Census Bureau, 2001b,
Questions CDQ11 and CDQ12):
· ``Do you [Does the child] have difficulty hearing
what is said in a normal conversation with another
person even when wearing your [his/her] hearing
aid?'' [Note: the respondent is not forced to answer
yes or no; the individual may indicate ``Person is deaf''
in lieu of providing a yes or no response.]
· An affirmative response is followed by ``Are
you [Is the child] able to hear what is said in normal
conversation at all?''
These are fundamentally social questions; they pertain
to interactions between a person speaking and the
person (who may be experiencing hearing loss or deaf-
ness) being spoken to. Given that the idea of normal
conversation is commonly shared, it is this manner of
social interaction that defines hearing loss or deafness.
It is important to note that the SIPP defines hearing
loss and deafness in relation to an individual's difficulty
hearing normal conversation with the use of a hearing
aid (if worn); from a less conversationally functional
and more audiological perspective, some respondents
may have a hearing loss that is not going to be apparent
using the two questions above. Further consideration
needs to be given to whether the person uses a hearing
aid (U.S. Census Bureau, 2001a, Question ADQ2c;
U.S. Census Bureau, 2001b, Question CDQ7c). A per-
son who reports no difficulty hearing normal conver-
sation when wearing her/his hearing aid, nonetheless,
does have a hearing loss. This creates a special sub-
group among those with hearing loss or deafness re-
sponding to the SIPP: persons who have no difficulty
hearing normal conversation and use a hearing aid
(i.e., ``No'' response to Questions ADQ6 or CDQ11,
but ``Yes'' response to Questions ADQ2c or CDQ7c).
As noted, the SIPP allows individuals to select the
label ``deaf'' in lieu of indicating the degree of diffi-
culty hearing normal conversation. This alternative
response exists because people who are born deaf or
who experience hearing loss before acquiring spoken
language often do not identify themselves as having
difficultly with normal conversation; they identify
themselves as deaf (Hale, 2001). These respondents
understand that the standard referent is to normal
conversation, which implies that any alternative man-
ner of conversation or social intercourse to which one
may have ready access is not normal and does not
count; being deaf does count.
Another social basis for defining deafness, intro-
duced above, is the use of speech versus sign language,
particularly a preference for the use of one over the
other. Largely dependent on both the degree and tim-
ing of hearing loss, those who are hard of hearing are
distinguished from those who are deaf by their ability
and preference for the use of spoken language when
communicating with others. Clearly, there is more
room for social mobility by this definition because
language and communication skills and preferences
can change over time, affecting how a person with
hearing loss or deafness creates a self-presentation
and how that presentation is perceived by others.
However, the SIPP does not inquire about preferences
for the use of speech or sign language, though it does
request information about the intelligibility of the
individual's speech (e.g., U.S. Census Bureau, 2001a,
Question ADQ8: ``Do you have difficulty having your
speech understood?'').
As becomes evident in the presentation of findings
(see the Findings From the SIPP section), five cate-
gories of persons can be derived from the difficulty-
hearing-normal-conversation and hearing-aid-use
questions, ranging from no difficulty to deaf, but the
distinctions are too fine given the limited sample size
of the SIPP. Discussions about the demography of
deafness from the SIPP need to be limited to three
groups of persons: hearing, hard of hearing, and func-
tionally deaf. Persons who are considered hearing are
those with no difficulty hearing normal conversation
and who do not use a hearing aid. Persons who are
hard of hearing are those who either have no difficulty
hearing normal conversation but do wear a hearing aid
or have some difficulty hearing normal conversation
(regardless of hearing aid use). Persons who are func-
tionally deaf are those who indicated they are either
deaf or unable to hear normal conversation at all (even
when using a hearing aid). The SIPP includes too few
respondents in some or all age groups for those iden-
tified as deaf or as having no difficulty hearing normal
conversation when wearing a hearing aid, which means
114 Journal of Deaf Studies and Deaf Education 11:1 Winter 2006
that reliable estimates cannot be obtained at this level
of detail. Consequently, grouping respondents as hear-
ing, hard of hearing, or functionally deaf is the best
that the SIPP has to offer.
It turns out that the SIPP does not collect some
data highly relevant to the experience of deafness. In
particular, the timing of hearing loss, called the age at
onset (see, e.g., Schein, 1989), is not recorded. Instead,
and only for adults, hearing loss or deafness has to be
considered the ``main reason for [the individual's]
difficulties'' before the year (and month) of onset is
requested. If hearing loss or deafness is not considered
the cause of any difficulties with identified activities or
diminished sense of personal health, then no onset
date is requested. Further, only the main reason is
associated with a date, so persons with hearing loss
or deafness who perceive some other condition as their
main reason for difficulties or fair or poor health would
still not have an opportunity to report their age at
onset. There are no explicit requests for retrospective
accounts of the age at onset of hearing loss or deafness
independent of other conditions or perceptions.
Conduct and Design of the SIPP
The U.S. Census Bureau employs a multistage, strat-
ified, cluster sampling design to annually conduct the
multiwave panel, national household survey known as
the SIPP (see Westat, 2001, for details). That is, the
well-funded and extensively staffed SIPP utilizes
a complex sample design to follow a large group of
people (panel) over a few years, with data collection
occurring at regular intervals (waves) during that time
period. However, for any given panel, questions about
disability typically are asked during two waves only,
but neither the initial nor the final waves. This means
that the SIPP does not collect data on hearing loss
and deafness annually but does have two time points
separated by about 1 year. It should be noted that the
consistency of responses to inquiries about hearing
difficulty across the two time points for the 1993 panel
was not high (McNeil, 2000), which, at a minimum,
raises concern about data reliability for longitudinal
studies of hearing loss or deafness using the SIPP.
For the panel starting in 2001, the design includes
disability questions for two waves: Wave 5 and Wave 8.
For the cross-sectional analysis of available data, here,
the SIPP Panel 2001 Wave 5 interviews were con-
ducted from June through September of 2002.
The Panel 2001 Wave 5 interviews sample in-
cluded 29,532 sample units (households) with a total
of 69,413 persons (63,456 over 5 years of age); how-
ever, 3.4% of the eligible persons were not inter-
viewed. Thirty percent of the interviews for persons
aged 15 years or older were with proxies rather than
directly with the individual for whom data was recorded;
all data for children under age 15 were obtained
through proxy interviews.
Person-level weights are assigned to each respon-
dent. These weights are multipliers that increase or
decrease the contribution of each individual's re-
sponses in proportion to their expected prevalence
based on the sample design so that nationally repre-
sentative estimates for the civilian noninstitutionalized
resident population can be obtained (i.e., does not
include persons who are incarcerated, institutionalized,
on military bases, or outside of the United States).
Design-effect adjustments for the calculation of stan-
dard errors are provided by the U.S. Census Bureau
(Tupek, 2004) in a publicly available ``Source and
Accuracy Statement'' on the World Wide Web. The
design-effect adjustments are necessary because the
complex sample design employed by the SIPP in-
creases the measurement error associated with each
estimate when compared to the errors that would be
calculated if respondents had been sampled randomly
without regard to population clustering or assuring
that persons from all significant social strata were in-
cluded. As conventional for population estimates, 90%
confidence intervals are calculated (estimate 6 1.645 3
standard error) to highlight just how far away point
estimates based upon the SIPP sample may be from
the true numbers of persons in the population.
Findings From the SIPP
According to the estimates in Table 1, about
11,000,000 (10,688,525 6 491,406) people in the
United States over 5 years of age are deaf or hard of
hearing (4.1% of the population, or 41 per 1,000).
However, if estimates are restricted to those who have
at least some difficulty hearing normal conversation,
Endnotes 115
even with a hearing aid, then roughly 8,000,000
(8,188,468 6 432,052) children and adults would be
classified as deaf or hard of hearing (3.7% of the pop-
ulation, or 37 per 1,000). About 1,000,000 (993,499 6
152,421) are functionally deaf--either deaf or unable
to hear normal conversation at all, even when using
a hearing aid--(0.38% of the population, or fewer
than 4 per 1,000).
Finally, in the neighborhood of 200,000 (179,552 6
64,889) people in the United States were identified as
``deaf'' (0.07% of the population, or less than 1 per
1,000). That is, this last category of children and
adults did not identify with questions about difficulty
hearing normal conversation as an appropriate way to
characterize their hearing loss. (Note that these deaf
individuals are unlikely to actively identify with clas-
sification schemes based upon pure tone threshold
audiometry, which often have labels describing hearing
loss as ranging from slight to profound and typically
make reference to a better-or worse-ear average across
several frequencies.) However, there is little reason to
have confidence in the estimates from the ``deaf'' cat-
egory. A mere 45 out of 63,446 persons over 5 years of
age for whom survey responses were obtained (or
could be imputed) were identified as deaf. This means
that the standard errors on the estimates for this
category are very large, particularly when broken down
by age group. The 90% confidence interval for deaf
children ranges from 325 to 47,891 (0.00% to 0.09%
of the ages 6­17 population); from 53,197 to 151,095
(0.05% to 0.14%) for deaf young adults--ages 18 to
44; from 10,932 to 74,098 (0.02% to 0.11%) for deaf
middle-age adults--ages 45 to 64; and from ÿ5,123 to
26,689 (ÿ0.01% to 0.08%) for deaf seniors--adults
65 years and older. These estimates are not highly
reliable; the standard errors range in magnitude from
36% of the estimate (all ages) to 148% of the estimate
(seniors)! Of particular note is the negative lower
bound for seniors, which is due to difficulty estimating
standard errors for groups with almost no represen-
tation (i.e., three respondents); that is, the estimate
is so unreliable that the statistical error at the 90%
confidence level is larger than the estimate itself. With
respect to the disproportionality across age groups,
this is most likely due to wide, but reasonable, sam-
pling variability rather than being representative of the
distribution of deaf persons by age in the population.
Given the low reliability of the estimates for per-
sons who were identified as deaf, further discussions
about deafness are limited to findings for the number
of persons who are functionally deaf (i.e., combining
deaf with those unable to hear normal conversation at
all, even with a hearing aid). The number of respond-
ents identified as functionally deaf is large enough to
provide fairly reliable estimates. Similarly, the discus-
sion of lesser degrees of hearing loss is limited to
findings for the number of persons who are hard of
hearing (i.e., some difficulty hearing normal conversa-
tion or no difficulty hearing normal conversation, but
uses a hearing aid). Among hard-of-hearing persons,
there are an estimated 288,090 6 82,178 children,
1,100,606 6 161,121 young adults, 2,652,118 6
248,310 middle-age adults, and 5,644,212 6 360,335
seniors; among functionally deaf persons, there are an
estimated 36,974 6 29,453 children, 217,130 6 71,325
young adults, 225,074 6 72,645 middle-age adults,
and 514,321 6 109,759 seniors.

who are hard of hearing and who are functionally
deaf, by age group, is shown in Figure 1 (percentage

estimates are printed above each bar). Ninety-percent
confidence interval error bars are included in the
figure. Except for the group of functionally deaf
children, where the size of the standard error is 80%
of the estimate itself (only 10 respondents were iden-
tified), the standard error of the estimate for each age
group of functionally deaf persons is less than one
third of the value of the estimate itself. Although the
magnitudes of the standard errors are large enough to
leave appreciable room for uncertainty about the true
population size, they remain small enough to be con-
fident that, with the exception of functionally deaf
children, the point estimates are of the right order of
magnitude.
For over a century now, various U.S. census and
survey efforts have identified substantial age variation
in the population of persons with hearing loss or deaf-
ness (see, e.g., Best, 1943; Ries, 1994; Schein & Delk,
1974). The findings presented here, based on analysis
of the recent SIPP, confirm this pattern of age varia-
tion (see Figure 1). The absence of age at onset data,
however, does not prevent making inferences about the
time-dependent nature of hearing loss or deafness.
The dramatic growth in prevalence with increasing
age, even with increasing life spans (see, e.g., Arias,
2002) and possible cohort effects (e.g., the maternal
rubella ``bulge'' associated with the 1964­1965,
1958­1959, 1952­1953, 1943­1944, and 1935­1936
birth cohorts; see, e.g., Brown, 1986; Preblud,
Hinman, & Herrmann, 1980), could only occur if an
increasing number of people are becoming hard of
hearing or functionally deaf over their lifetimes. In
other words, there is no way that these numbers would
occur solely due to people being born into the popu-
lation with hearing loss. Further, despite relatively
high rates of immigration into the United States since
the 1970s (see, e.g., Schmidley, 2001), there is no
evidence that geographical migration could possibly
account for the more than 20-fold increase in prevalence
of hearing loss and deafness between childhood (ages
6­17) and late adulthood (ages 65 and older).
The SIPP Answer to ``How Many Deaf?''
The SIPP provides fairly tight estimates for the num-
ber of functionally deaf persons for most age groups
except children (ages 6­17) but does not do so for any
age group of persons identified as ``deaf.'' Sampling
rare populations is very difficult to do. Obtaining
highly reliable estimates for the rarest of persons with
deafness, namely children and those who identify as
``deaf,'' requires a different methodology than that
employed by the SIPP, one that raises the probability
of sampling the rare population (see, e.g., Kalton &
Anderson, 1986; Schein & Delk, 1974). Nonetheless,
the estimates obtained from the SIPP are reasonable
given previous research (e.g., National Academy on an
Aging Society, 1999; Niskar et al., 1998; Ries, 1994;
Schein & Delk, 1974), so long as the exact nature of
the questions asked is kept in mind.
In sum, as far as it relates to difficulty hearing
normal conversation, estimates from the SIPP indicate
that fewer than 1 in 20 Americans are currently deaf or
hard of hearing. In round numbers, nearly 10,000,000
persons are hard of hearing and close to 1,000,000 are
functionally deaf. More than half of all persons with
hearing loss or deafness are 65 years or older and less
than 4% are under 18 years of age.
