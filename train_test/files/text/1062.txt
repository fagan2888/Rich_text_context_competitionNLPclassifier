Context: There is growing recognition that bipolar dis-
order (BPD) has a spectrum of expression that is sub-
stantially more common than the 1% BP-I prevalence tra-
ditionally found in population surveys.
Objective: To estimate the prevalence, correlates, and
treatment patterns of bipolar spectrum disorder in the
US population.
Design: Direct interviews.
Setting: Households in the continental United States.
Participants: A nationally representative sample of 9282
English-speaking adults (aged 18 years).
Main Outcome Measures: Version 3.0 of the World
Health Organization's Composite International Diagnos-
tic Interview, a fully structured lay-administered diag-
nostic interview, was used to assess DSM-IV lifetime and
12-month Axis I disorders. Subthreshold BPD was de-
fined as recurrent hypomania without a major depres-
sive episode or with fewer symptoms than required for
threshold hypomania. Indicators of clinical severity in-
cluded age at onset, chronicity, symptom severity, role
impairment, comorbidity, and treatment.
Results: Lifetime (and 12-month) prevalence esti-
mates are 1.0% (0.6%) for BP-I, 1.1% (0.8%) for BP-II,
and 2.4% (1.4%) for subthreshold BPD. Most respon-
dents with threshold and subthreshold BPD had life-
time comorbidity with other Axis I disorders, particu-
larly anxiety disorders. Clinical severity and role
impairment are greater for threshold than for subthresh-
old BPD and for BP-II than for BP-I episodes of major
depression, but subthreshold cases still have moderate
to severe clinical severity and role impairment. Al-
though most people with BPD receive lifetime profes-
sional treatment for emotional problems, use of anti-
manic medication is uncommon, especially in general
medical settings.
Conclusions: This study presents the first prevalence es-
timates of the BPD spectrum in a probability sample of
the United States. Subthreshold BPD is common, clini-
cally significant, and underdetected in treatment set-
tings. Inappropriate treatment of BPD is a serious prob-
lem in the US population. Explicit criteria are needed to
define subthreshold BPD for future clinical and re-
search purposes.

THE ESTIMATED LIFETIME
prevalence of bipolar dis-
order (BPD) in population
surveys using structured di-
agnostic interviews and
standardized criteria is approximately
0.8% for BP-I and 1.1% for BP-II.1-8 De-
spite this comparatively low prevalence,
BPD is a leading cause of premature mor-
tality due to suicide and associated medi-
cal conditions, such as diabetes mellitus
and cardiovascular disease.9,10 Also, BPD
causes widespread role impairment.11,12
The recurrent nature of manic and depres-
sive episodes often leads to high direct and
indirect health care costs.13,14
The large discrepancy between rates of
BPD found in large-scale community sur-
veys1-8 and those derived from prospec-
tive longitudinal studies15 suggests that life-
timeprevalenceestimatesfromcommunity
surveys may underestimate the true preva-
lence of BPD. Prospective studies15 have
shown that the symptom inclusion crite-
ria and the diagnostic thresholds for BPD
are too restrictive to detect BPD in the gen-
eral population, particularly in young
adults, when the disorder is in evolution.
Although the precise definitions are as yet
unclear, recent studies15,16 that have in-
cluded assessment of subthreshold mood
disorders suggest that bipolar spectrum

disorder might affect up to 6% of the general popula-
tion. Therefore, the societal burden of BPD might be far
greater than currently estimated because of the lack of
inclusion of subthreshold BPD.
The purpose of this study is to present the rates and
treatment patterns of bipolar spectrum disorder in the
National Comorbidity Survey Replication (NCS-R),17 a
study of a nationally representative sample of the United
States.
METHODS
SAMPLE
The NCS-R is a nationally representative survey of mental dis-
orders in English-speaking household residents 18 years and
older in the continental United States. Interviews were con-
ducted with 9282 respondents between February 2001 and
April 2003. Verbal informed consent was obtained before data
collection. Consent was verbal rather than written to maintain
consistency with the baseline NCS. The response rate was
70.9%. Respondents were given a $50 incentive for participa-
tion. A probability subsample of hard-to-recruit predesignated
respondents was administered a brief telephone nonrespon-
dent survey, and results were used to weight the main sample
for nonresponse bias. Nonrespondent survey participants were
given a $100 incentive. The human subjects committees of
Harvard Medical School and the University of Michigan, Ann
Arbor, approved these recruitment and consent procedures.
The NCS-R interview was administered in 2 parts. Part I
included a core diagnostic assessment of all respondents
(N=9282). Part II included questions about correlates and
additional disorders administered to all part I respondents who
met the lifetime criteria for any core disorder plus a probability
(1 in 3) subsample of other respondents (n=5692). A more
detailed discussion of NCS-R sampling and weighting is pro-
vided elsewhere.18
BIPOLAR DISORDER
The NCS-R diagnoses are based on Version 3.0 of the World
Health Organization's Composite International Diagnostic In-
terview (CIDI),19 a fully structured, lay-administered diagnos-
tic interview. The DSM-IV criteria were used to define mania
(duration 1 week), hypomania (duration 4 days), and ma-
jor depressive episode (MDE). The requirement that symptoms
do not meet the criteria for a mixed episode (criterion C for ma-
nia/hypomania and criterion B for MDE) was not operational-
ized in making these diagnoses. Respondents were classified as
having lifetime BP-I if they ever had a manic episode and as
having lifetime BP-II if they ever had a hypomanic but not
manic episode and ever had an episode of MDE. The number of
lifetime episodes of mania/hypomania and MDE may be over-
estimated because we did not assess mixed episodes and the
rapid cycling subtype of BPD.
Classification of subthreshold BPD included any of the fol-
lowing: (1) recurrent subthreshold hypomania (2 criterion
B symptoms and all other criteria for hypomania) in the pres-
ence of intercurrent MDE, (2) recurrent (2 episodes) hypo-
mania in the absence of recurrent MDE with or without sub-
threshold MDE, and (3) recurrent subthreshold hypomania in
the absence of intercurrent MDE with or without subthresh-
old MDE. The number of required symptoms for a determina-
tion of subthreshold hypomania was confined to 2 criterion B
symptoms (from the DSM-IV requirement of 3, or 4 if the
mood is only irritable) to retain the core features of hypoma-
nia in the subthreshold definition. Recurrent hypomania or
subthreshold hypomania in the absence of intercurrent MDE
was included in the definition because it is part of the DSM-IV
definition of BPD not otherwise specified. For the present
study, we define the BPD spectrum as a lifetime history of
BP-I, BP-II, or subthreshold BPD as defined previously herein.
All diagnoses excluded cases with plausible organic causes.
Age at onset of manic/hypomanic episodes and of MDEs was
assessed using retrospective self-reports at the syndrome level.
Respondents classified as having lifetime BPD were defined as
12-month cases if they had an episode of MDE, mania, hypo-
mania, or subthreshold hypomania at any time in the 12 months
before interview. Persistence was assessed by asking respon-
dents to estimate the number of years in their life in which they
had a manic or hypomanic episode and, separately, the num-
ber of years in which they had an MDE. Clinical reappraisal
interviews for BPD using the lifetime nonpatient version of the
Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID)20 were ad-
ministered to a probability subsample of 50 NCS-R respon-
dents. This was a special clinical reappraisal sample that fo-
cused exclusively on BPD and was distinct from the larger clinical
reappraisal sample used to assess the validity of more com-
mon DSM-IV disorders.21
The CIDI cases were oversampled in the BPD clinical reap-
praisal sample, and the data were weighted for this over-
sampling. As described in more detail elsewhere,22 CIDI-SCID
concordance was excellent for any BPD (ie, BP-I, BP-II, or sub-
threshold BPD), with a  of 0.94, a positive predictive value
(percentage of CIDI cases confirmed using the SCID) of 0.88,
a negative predictive value (percentage of CIDI noncases con-
firmed as not being cases using the SCID) of 1.0, and nonsig-
nificant McNemar test findings (2
1
=0.6; P=.45). The McNemar
test evaluates whether the CIDI prevalence estimate differs sig-
nificantly from the SCID prevalence estimate. Concordances
() for individual diagnoses were lower but still acceptable: 0.88
for BP-I, 0.50 for BP-II, and 0.51 for subthreshold BPD, whereas
positive predictive values were 0.79, 0.41, and 0.58, respec-
tively. Negative predictive values were consistently greater than
0.99, and the McNemar test value was consistently nonsignifi-
cant (2
1
=0.1-0.3; P=.56 to .75).
Symptom severity was assessed in 12-month cases using a
self-report version of the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS)23
for mania/hypomania and the Quick Inventory of Depressive
Symptomatology Self-Report (QIDS-SR)24 for MDE. The YMRS
was based on a fully structured respondent report version de-
veloped for parent reports.25 Severity was assessed for the month
in the past year when symptoms of either mania or depression
were most severe. Standard YMRS and QIDS-SR cutoff points
were used to define episodes as severe (including original YMRS
and QIDS-SR ratings of very severe, with ratings in the range
25 on the YMRS and 16 on the QIDS-SR), moderate (15-24
on the YMRS and 11-15 on the QIDS-SR), mild (9-14 on the
YMRS and 6-10 on the QIDS-SR), or not clinically significant
(0-8 on the YMRS and 0-5 on the QIDS-SR). We did not col-
lect data on differences in the accuracy of recall for the 12 months
used in the present study compared with those of the QIDS-SR
(30 days) and the YMRS (7 days).
Role impairment in 12-month cases was assessed using the
Sheehan Disability Scale.26 As with the YMRS and the QIDS-
SR, in the Sheehan Disability Scale, the respondents were
asked to focus on the 1 month in the past year when their
mania/hypomania or MDE symptoms were most severe.
Respondents rated the degree to which the condition inter-
fered with their home management, work, social life, and per-
sonal relationships using a visual analog scale from 0 to 10
(none=0, mild=1-3, moderate=4-6, severe=7-9, and very
severe=10).

OTHER DISORDERS
Other core DSM-IV disorders assessed using the CIDI in-
cluded other anxiety disorders, mood disorders, impulse-
control disorders, and substance use disorders. Organic exclu-
sion rules and diagnostic hierarchy rules were used in making
all diagnoses. As detailed elsewhere,21,27 blinded clinical re-
peated interviews using the nonpatient version of the SCID20
with a probability subsample of NCS-R respondents found gen-
erally good concordance between CIDI/DSM-IV diagnoses of
anxiety, mood, and substance use disorders and independent
clinical assessments. Impulse-control disorder diagnoses were
not validated because the SCID clinical reappraisal interviews
did not include an assessment of these disorders.
OTHER MEASURES
Lifetime and 12-month treatment were also assessed by the spe-
cialty of the health care professional, including psychiatrists,
other mental health professionals, general medical providers,
human services professionals, and complementary and alter-
native medicine providers. Specific medications were also col-
lected for those who endorsed treatment during the past 12
months. Mood stabilizers, anticonvulsants, and antipsychot-
ics were classified as appropriate medications for BPD. Anti-
depressants and other psychotropic medications in the ab-
sence of antimanic agents were classified as inappropriate.
Twelve-month treatment was assessed separately for respon-
dents with 12-month BPD and for those with lifetime but not
12-month BPD (ie, maintenance treatment). Appropriateness
of medication was examined separately for those being treated
by a psychiatrist and a general medical provider.
All the analyses included controls for sex, age (18-29, 30-
44, 45-59, and 60 years), race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic white,
non-Hispanic black, Hispanic, and other), educational level (less
than high school, completed high school, some college, and com-
pleted college), and occupation (professional, technical, service-
clerical, and labor) for the average expected hours of work per
week (20-34, 35-44, 45).
ANALYSIS METHODS
Subgroup comparisons were used to study lifetime prevalence
and persistence of BP-I, BP-II, and subthreshold BPD. Age-at-
onset distributions were estimated using the 2-part actuarial
method implemented using a software program (SAS 8.2; SAS
Institute Inc, Cary, NC).28 The actuarial method differs from
the more familiar Kaplan-Meier29 method in using a more ac-
curate way of estimating the timing of onsets in a given year.30
The actuarial method, similar to the Kaplan-Meier method, as-
sumes constant conditional risk of onset at a given year of life
across cohorts. Persistence was examined by calculating means
and interquartile ranges of reported years in episode, number
of lifetime episodes, and the proportion of lifetime episodes that
were manic/hypomanic vs MDE. Comorbidity was assessed by
calculating odds ratios between BPD and other CIDI/DSM-IV
disorders. Clinical severity, severity of role impairment, and treat-
ment were examined by calculating distributions within the BPD
subgroups. Because the NCS-R sample design used weighting
and clustering, all statistical analyses were performed using the
Taylor series linearization method,31 a design-based method
implemented using a software system (SUDAAN version 8.01;
RTI International, Research Triangle Park, NC). Significance
tests of sets of coefficients were performed using Wald 2 tests
based on design-corrected coefficient variance-covariance ma-
trices. Statistical significance was evaluated using 2-sided design-
based .05-level tests.
RESULTS
PREVALENCE, AGE AT ONSET,
AND PERSISTENCE
Lifetime prevalence estimates are 1.0% for BP-I, 1.1% for
BP-II, 2.4% for subthreshold BPD, and 4.4% overall
(Table 1). Sex-specific (male and female) prevalence es-
timates are 0.8% and 1.1% for BP-I, 0.9% and 1.3% for
BP-II, and 2.6% and 2.1% for subthreshold BPD. Ap-
proximately one third (36.7%) of subthreshold cases have
a history of recurrent subthreshold hypomania in the pres-
ence of MDEs, whereas 41.9% have a history of recur-
rent hypomania in the absence of recurrent MDEs. The
remaining 21.4% have a history of recurrent subthresh-
old hypomania in the absence of MDEs. Twelve-month
prevalence estimates are 0.6% for BP-I, 0.8% for BP-II,
and 1.4% for subthreshold BPD.
Mean retrospectively reported age at onset of the first
manic/hypomanic or major depressive episode is some-
what earlier for BP-I (18.2 years) and BP-II (20.3 years)
than for subthreshold BPD (22.2 years). The interquar-
tile range (25th-75th percentiles of the cumulative age-
at-onset distribution) is between the late teens and the
early 40s for all 3 disorders, with the increase in cumu-
lative lifetime prevalence being fairly linear in that age
range (Figure). Persistence, indirectly indicated by the
ratio of 12-month prevalence to lifetime prevalence, is

higher for BP-I (63.3%) and BP-II (73.2%) than for sub-
threshold BPD (59.5%) (results available on request). The
same pattern is found for retrospectively reported mean
number of years in episode (10.3 for BP-I, 11.6 for BP-
II, and 6.8 for subthreshold BPD) and mean number of
lifetime episodes (77.6 for BP-I, 63.6 for BP-II, and 31.8
for subthreshold BPD). More detailed analysis (results
available on request) showed that low persistence of sub-
threshold BPD is limited to participants without a his-
tory of MDE. The ratio of lifetime manic/hypomanic epi-
sodes to total episodes is in the range of 0.5 to 0.6 for
respondents with lifetime BP-I or BP-II and consider-
ably higher (0.8) for subthreshold BPD due to the inclu-
sion of hypomania in the absence of MDE. Twelve-
month ratios are similar to lifetime ratios.
SOCIODEMOGRAPHIC CORRELATES
The sociodemographic correlates of BPD in the NCS-R
are modest in magnitude but fairly consistent across the
BPD spectrum. Bipolar disorder is inversely related to age
and educational level and is elevated in previously mar-
ried individuals compared with the currently married
(only for subthreshold BPD) and in the unemployed-
disabled compared with the employed. Bipolar disorder
is unrelated to sex, race/ethnicity, and family income (re-
sults not presented but available on request).
COMORBIDITY WITH
OTHER DSM-IV DISORDERS
Lifetime comorbidity with other DSM-IV/CIDI disor-
ders was reported by most respondents with a history of
threshold (95.8%-97.7%) and subthreshold (88.4%)
BPD (Table 2). Odds ratios of BPD with individual dis-
orders are uniformly significant and generally higher
for BP-I (5.2-13.7) and BP-II (2.6-16.7) than for sub-
threshold BPD (2.2-5.0). An exception is odds ratios
with substance use disorders being much higher for
BP-I than for either BP-II or subthreshold BPD. Comor-
bidity with 3 or more other disorders is dramatically
higher than comorbidity with only 1 disorder across the
BPD spectrum.
SEVERITY OF 12-MONTH CASES
The YMRS 12-month episode severity was rated as se-
vere in a higher proportion of BP-I (70.2%) than BP-II
(55.4%) or subthreshold BPD (31.5%) (Table 3). Most
manic/hypomanic episodes were classified as either se-
vere or moderate across the BPD spectrum (87.3%-
94.6%). The QIDS-SR 12-month severity was rated as
more severe for BP-II (84.0%) than for BP-I (70.5%) or
subthreshold BPD (46.4%). As with mania/hypomania,
most MDEs were classified as either severe or moderate
across the spectrum (92.3%-100.0%).
Severe role impairment due to 12-month mania/
hypomania was reported by 73.1% of those with 12-
month BP-I, 64.6% with BP-II, and 45.9% with subthresh-
old BPD (Table 4). Severe role impairment due to 12-
month MDE in people with BPD was reported by even
higher proportions of 12-month cases. As with clinical
severity, severe role impairment due to MDE was more
common in participants with BP-II (91.4%) vs BP-I
(89.3%) or subthreshold BPD (78.8%). Reports of mod-
erate or severe impairment were also more common for
MDE (98.6%-100.0%) than for mania/hypomania (87.3%-
100%). Impairment was common in all the domains as-
sessed using the Sheehan Disability Scale.
TREATMENT
Lifetime treatment of emotional problems by the time of
the interview was reported by 80.1% of respondents with
lifetime BPD (Table 5). A history of treatment is more
common for BP-I and BP-II (89.2%-95.0%) than for sub-
threshold BPD (69.3%), although even the latter is high
compared with other DSM-IV/CIDI disorders.32 Psychia-
trists were the most common providers for BP-I (64.9%)
and BP-II (62.2%) and general medical professionals for
subthreshold BPD (37.5%).

received inappropriate treatment during the past 12
months was significantly greater in those who received

The opposite pattern was found for the proportion re-
ceiving no medication (36.3% for BP-I, 45.7% for BP-II,
and 68.1% for subthreshold BPD). The numbers were too
small to distinguish 12-month cases with mania/
hypomania only, MDE only, and both mania/hypo-
mania and MDE with adequate statistical power. A sig-
nificant gradient was also found in the proportion of
lifetime cases without a 12-month episode (ignoring
whether they received 12-month treatment) that re-
ceived appropriate maintenance medication: 17.9% for
BP-I, 15.6% for BP-II, and 3.2% for subthreshold BPD.
The proportion of all lifetime cases that received inap-
propriate medication was also higher for BP-I (35.3%)
than for BP-II (24.5%) or subthreshold BPD (21.5%). The
opposite pattern was found for the proportion receiving
no medication (46.8% for BP-I, 59.9% for BP-II, and 75.3%
for subthreshold BPD).
COMMENT
There are several limitations of this study that should be
considered in interpreting these findings. First, use of the
fully structured, lay-administered CIDI precluded the col-
lection of information on the full spectrum of expres-
sion of BPD proposed in recent studies.16,34-36 Although
we could not modify the thresholds for some of the di-
agnostic criteria for mania and depression, our defini-
tion of subthreshold BPD is still more restrictive than the
definitions proposed by clinical researchers. Therefore,
our prevalence estimate of subthreshold BPD is likely to
underestimate bipolar spectrum disorder in the popula-
tion. A related limitation is the absence of information
on mixed episodes, rapid cycling, and brief episodes that
could only be assessed in more flexible semistructured
clinical interviews. Although the clinical reappraisal study
found good concordance of CIDI diagnoses with blinded

clinical diagnoses based on the SCID, concordance was
lower for BP-II and subthreshold BPD than for BP-I.22 The
less flexible nature of the CIDI than that of clinical in-
terviews could have also led to overestimation of comor-
bidity and bias in clinical severity and persistence. Fi-
nally, differences between the 1-year recall period of the
symptom scales used in the present study and those for
which the scales were standardized diminish the com-
parability of the present findings with those of previous
clinical samples.
In the context of these limitations, the results pro-
vide the first nationally representative US general popu-
lation prevalence estimates of subthreshold BPD. Preva-
lence estimates of BP-I and BP-II (1.0%-1.1%) are
consistent with estimates from earlier population-based
studies,1,3-8 except for a much higher lifetime prevalence

estimate of BP-I (3.3%) in a large recent national survey
of the United States.2 The lower NCS-R BP-I prevalence
estimate was confirmed by the clinical reappraisal study,
whereas no clinical validation of the 3-fold higher esti-
mate in the former study was reported.
The inclusion of symptom severity measures also dem-
onstrates the validity of the spectrum concept of bipo-
larity. The direct association between increasingly re-
strictive definitions of BPD and the indicators of clinical
validity, including number of episodes, chronicity, symp-
tom severity, impairment, comorbidity, and treat-
ment,1,34-36 provides evidence of the underlying dimen-
sional nature of bipolar illness. For example, the severity
of work impairment increased from 19.8% for subthresh-
old BPD to 47.5% for BP-II to 62.3% for BP-I, and the
severity of manic/hypomanic episodes rose from 31.5%
for subthreshold BPD to 55.4% for BP-II to 70.2% for BP-I.
Likewise, the mean age at onset ranged from 18.2 years
for BP-I to 20.3 years for BP-II to 22.2 years for the sub-
threshold BPD subgroup, and the estimated average num-
bers of lifetime episodes were 77.6 for BP-I, 63.6 for BP-
II, and 32.0 for subthreshold BPD. Although these
retrospective estimates may reflect recall bias to some ex-
tent, they are still within the range of estimates reported
in prospective studies and family studies.37,38 Since the
mean age at onset of BPD occurs at one of the most criti-
cal periods of educational, occupational, and social de-
velopment, its consequences often lead to lifelong dis-
ability. Not only does the disorder begin at an early age
but affected individuals spend an average of a decade of
their lives in episodes of illness.
The prevalence estimate of subthreshold BPD in the
NCS-R is broadly consistent with the findings of 2 large
community epidemiologic surveys in Europe.39,40 How-
ever, it is likely to be a lower bound because we did not
include reduced duration of hypomanic episodes. The
NCS-R results clearly document the clinical significance
of subthreshold BPD, as most subthreshold cases had mod-
erate-severe symptom profiles and role impairment based
on standard rating scales. As might be expected, there was
lower episode persistence and a lower severe-moderate ra-
tio in subthreshold vs threshold cases. Consistent with pre-
vious research,15 the proportions of those with depres-
sive episodes that were rated as severe were higher for BP-II
than for BP-I and lower for subthreshold BPD. The more
striking results from the perspective of subthreshold BPD
are that the clinical severity, role impairment, and comor-
bidity of subthreshold BPD are all high and, indeed, com-
parable with those of nonbipolar major depression re-
ported in previous NCS-R analyses.41 The findings on the
clinical significance of subthreshold BPD strongly argue
for inclusion of the BPD spectrum concept in the diag-
nostic classification system.
After controlling for time at risk,42 the high magni-
tude of comorbidity of threshold BPD with other men-
tal disorders is consistent with previous clinical43,44 and
population-based2-4,45-47 studies. However, although the
association between BPD and substance abuse has been
well-established, the high magnitude of comorbidity be-
tween BPD and anxiety disorders, particularly panic dis-
order, generalized anxiety disorder, and obsessive-
compulsive disorder, has not been widely recognized.48,49
Despite the higher disorder-specific comorbidity of thresh-
old than subthreshold BPD, comorbidity with at least 1
other disorder was nearly as common in subthreshold
(88.4%) as in threshold (95.8%-97.7%) cases. This means
that the generally lower bivariate comorbidity of sub-
threshold than threshold BPD is due to lower multimor-
bidity (ie, comorbidity with multiple conditions).50 This
pervasive comorbidity across the BPD spectrum is sug-
gestive of disturbances in multiple regulatory systems and
should be a topic for future research.

Most NCS-R respondents with threshold (87.1%-
91.5%) or subthreshold (67.8%) BPD reported lifetime
treatment for emotional problems. However, treatment
in the year before the interview was lower than lifetime
treatment for both threshold (65.8%-67.3%) and sub-
threshold (36.7%) cases, and only a few received appro-
priate medication (25.0% for BP-I, 15.4% for BP-II, and
8.1% for subthreshold BPD). Appropriate maintenance
medication of currently asymptomatic lifetime cases was
even lower than inappropriate maintenance medication
(17.9% for BP-I, 15.6% for BP-II, and 3.2% for subthresh-
old BPD). The proportions receiving inappropriate medi-
cation (primarily antidepressants in the absence of an-
timania agents) were considerably higher than those
receiving appropriate treatment (31.4% for 12-month
cases and 25.1% for asymptomatic lifetime cases), espe-
cially in patients undergoing general medical treatment
(73.1% for 12-month cases and 65.6% for asymptom-
atic lifetime cases). Appropriate medication use was much
higher and inappropriate medication use lower in pa-
tients receiving psychiatric treatment than those receiv-
ing general medical treatment, although fewer than half
of the psychiatric patients took appropriate medica-
tions (45.0% of 12-month cases and 41.1% of asymp-
tomatic lifetime cases). The high use of inappropriate
medications is a concern given the dangers associated with
the use of antidepressants in the absence of mood stabi-
lizers to treat BPD.51 Note that the treatment percent-
ages represent patients who took medications. The num-
ber of patients who were prescribed but did not take
medications was not recorded in the survey. It is pos-
sible that higher proportions were prescribed antimanic
agents but did not take them because subjective distress
is far lower in mania/hypomania than in depression.11
The present results reinforce the argument of other re-
searchers16,34-36 that clinically significant subthreshold BPD
is at least as common as threshold BPD. Although most
individuals with BPD receive treatment owing to comor-

*The denominator for total in parts I and II includes patients not being treated. The proportion with appropriate medication in the total exceeds the sum of the
weighted proportions in the other 2 areas owing to the fact that some respondents reported use of appropriate medications although they reported not having
seen either a psychiatrist or a general medical professional at any time in the past 12 months.
Significant difference across the 3 BPD subgroups in the row at the P=.05 level, 2-sided test.
Significantly different from the comparable percentage in the same row among patients treated by a psychiatrist.
Â§Part II presents data on 12-month maintenance medication among lifetime cases for which neither a mania/hypomania episode nor a major depressive episode
was reported in the past 12 months.

Correction
Errors in Funding/Support, Financial Disclosure, Tables, and Text. In the Origi-
nal Article by Merikangas et al titled "Lifetime and 12-Month Prevalence of
Bipolar Spectrum Disorder in the National Comorbidity Survey Replication,"
published in the May issue (2007;64[5]:543-552), there were several errors.
First, the following sentence in the Funding/Support section was incorrect:
"The preparation of this article was supported by AstraZeneca." AstraZeneca
did not provide any financial or scientific support for this study.
Second, in addition to the financial disclosure of Dr Hirschfeld, that sec-
tion should have contained the following: "Dr Akiskal is a consultant to or
serves on the advisory board of Abbott International, GlaxoSmithKline, and
Sanofi-Aventis. Dr Angst is a consultant to or serves on the advisory board of
AstraZeneca and Eli Lilly and Company. Mr Greenberg is a consultant to or
serves on the advisory board of AstraZeneca, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Eli Lilly
and Company, Forest Laboratories, Ortho Biotech, and Sanofi-Aventis.
Dr Kessler is a consultant to or serves on the advisory board of AstraZeneca,
Bristol-Myers Squibb, Eli Lilly and Company, Sanofi-Aventis, and Wyeth-
Ayerst.
Third, Table 1 and Tables 3 through 6 were labeled incorrectly with re-
gard to SD and SE. In Table 1, the mention of SD should have read SE. In Tables
3 through 6, the mentions of SE should have read SD. A corrected version of
Table 1 with SDs is available at http://www.hcp.med.harvard.edu/ncs/ftpdir
/PA377%20erratum.pdf.
Fourth, the reference to inappropriate pharmacological treatment of
bipolar disorder should have been restricted to bipolar disorders I and II and
not included subthreshold bipolar disorder.
Errors 3 and 4 were pointed out by Bernard Carroll, MD.
