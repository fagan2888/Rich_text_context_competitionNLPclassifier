Introduction
Hypertension is a common and complex human disease
that causes significant morbidity and mortality worldwide.
The etiology and pathogenesis of high blood pressure (BP)
are complicated by the varied molecular pathways, genetic
polymorphisms, and environmental conditions that con-
verge on BP regulation. The genetic component of hyper-
tension is strong and multiple genes from diverse molecular
pathways have been linked to BP. Among these pathways,
the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) is
important because of its effects on salt and water homeosta-
sis and autonomic control, as well as vascular structure and
function.
Inhibiting the RAAS has long been known as one of the
most successful therapies for the management of hyperten-
sion. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are
one of the RAAS inhibitors and one of the first-line agents
for the treatment of hypertension. However, the BPresponse
to ACE inhibitors varies markedly among individuals and
among different ethnic groups.1 Such variations suggest
that the genetic constitution of an individual may play an

Abstract
Introduction: The polymorphic angiotensinogen (AGT) gene is one of the most promising candidates for essential
hypertension. The aim of this study was to examine the association between the A-6G variant of the AGT gene and the
blood pressure response to angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in hypertensive subjects.
Methods: Five hundred and nine mildly to moderately hypertensive subjects received ACE inhibitors for six weeks
after a two-week run-in period. AGT genotyping was performed by direct polymerase chain reaction amplification and
deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) nucleotide sequencing from peripheral blood.
Results: The AA genotype, AG genotype, and GG genotype were present in 301 (59.1%), 186 (36.6%), and 22 (4.3%)
of patients, respectively. As compared with patients carrying the AA or AG genotype, those carrying the GG genotype
had significantly greater reductions in systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, pulse pressure and mean arterial
pressure (p=0.007, 0.014, 0.027 and 0.005, respectively). Moreover, stepwise multiple linear regression analysis showed
that the A-6G genotype was a significant predictor of systolic blood pressure and pulse pressure reductions (p=0.040
and 0.019, respectively).
Conclusion: Our study indicates that the A-6G variant of the AGT gene may be an important determinant of interin-
dividual variation in the response to ACE inhibitors.

important role in variation in the response to ACE inhibitor
therapy. Candidate genes for the pharmacogenomics of
ACE inhibitor therapy include genes in the RAAS pathway.
The angiotensinogen (AGT) gene, one of the major struc-
tural genes in this pathway, has been associated with hyper-
tension.2 A genetic variant A-6G (rs5051) in the proximal
promoter region of the AGT gene, an adenine to guanine
substitution six base pairs (bp) from the site of transcription
initiation, has been significantly associated with elevated
plasma AGT levels, AGT gene transcription and essential
hypertensive.3,4 Therefore, we hypothesized that this poly-
morphism may have the potential to predict the variation in
therapeutic response to ACE inhibitors treatment.
As we know, besides systolic blood pressure (SBP) and
diastolic blood pressure (DBP), BP is also characterized by
its pulsatile and steady components.5,6 The pulsatile com-
ponent, estimated by pulse pressure (PP), represents BP
variation and is affected by left ventricular ejection frac-
tion, large-artery stiffness, early pulse wave reduction, and
heart rate.7 The steady component, estimated by mean arte-
rial pressure (MAP), is a function of left ventricular con-
tractility, heart rate, and vascular resistance and elasticity
averaged over time.5,8 In this study, we aimed to investigate
whether the A-6G polymorphism of the AGT gene influ-
ences the SBP, DBP, PP, and MAP response to ACE inhibi-
tors and the distribution of the polymorphism in Chinese
essential hypertensive patients.
Materials and methods
Study population
The material studied comes from the Comparative Study of
Hypotensive Efficacy and the Cough Occurrence of
Imidapril versus Benazepril,9 which is a multicenter pro-
spective trial performed in 20 centers in 12 cities in China.
In this study both male and female Chinese Han patients
who met the following criteria were included: aged 18­79
years; history of essential hypertension; DBP90 mm Hg
and 109 mm Hg; and SBP<180 mm Hg. The exclusion
criteria were isolated systolic hypertension, secondary
hypertension, or known renal artery stenosis; congestive
heart failure, cerebrovascular accident, transient ischemic
attacks or myocardial infarction within the past year; a doc-
umented history of unstable angina pectoris within the past
six months; clinically important cardiac arrhythmia; uncon-
trolled diabetes mellitus (fasting plasma glucose>10.0
mmol/l); any clinically important abnormal laboratory
finding, such as glutamic­pyruvic transaminase/creatinine
twice the upper limit of normal; a history or suspicion of
alcohol or drug abuse; pregnant or lactating females; con-
comitant use of any agent that may cause an alteration of
BP; or known hypersensitivity or contraindication to ACE
inhibitors. The study complies with the Declaration of
Helsinki. All procedures were reviewed and approved by
the institutional review board of each participating institu-
tion, and written informed consent was obtained from all
participants.
A total of 640 patients with essential hypertension par-
ticipated in our study. All antihypertensive agents were
withdrawn before the start of a two-week single-blind pla-
cebo run-in period. By use of a double-blind design at the
end of the placebo period, a total of 570 qualified patients
were allocated randomly to groups receiving either 10 mg
benazepril or 5 mg imidapril orally once daily for three
weeks. Thereafter patients whose BP was less than 140/90
mm Hg continued with the same dose regimen for another
three weeks. In patients whose BP was not adequately con-
trolled (BP140/90 mm Hg), the dose of either regimen
was doubled for the next three weeks. Four patients in the
benazepril group withdrew from the study because of a
severe cough during the study. Thus 566 patients completed
the trial. The deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) of 509 patients
with complete data was successfully extracted for further
analysis. BP was measured by trained doctors or nurses
using a mercury sphygmomanometer after the patient had
rested for at least 10 min in a seated position and was deter-
mined as the mean of three measurements taken 1 min
apart. PP was calculated as the difference between SBP and
DBP. MAP was calculated as (2DBP + SBP)/3.
Genotyping
The sequence data were obtained from the GenBank data-
base (GenBank accession number NM_000029). The local-
ization of the variant is numbered by reference to the
transcription-initiation site as defined previously. The AGT
gene A-6G polymorphism was located at position-6 in the
promoter region. Genotyping was performed by direct
sequencing. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primers were
designed using Primer3 software. The genomic DNAs from
subjects were amplified using 5'-AGAGGTTTTTCA
GTCATCACC GT-3'as the forward primer and 5'-ACGG
TGATGACTGAAAAACCTCT -3' as the reverse primer.
PCR amplifications were carried out in a total volume of
50 µl with a reaction mixture containing 250 ng genomic
DNA, 12.5 pmol of each primer, 10×buffer, 0.6 mmol/l of
deoxynucleotide triphosphates (dNTPs) and 2 U Taq
DNA polymerase. The PCR amplification conditions
included an initial denaturation at 94°C for 2 min, fol-
lowed by 35 cycles with denaturation at 94°C for 30 s,
annealing at 55°C for 30 s, and extension at 72°C for 40
s, followed by a final extension step at 72°C for 5 min.
The amplification product (489 bp) contained nucleotides
-324 to 165 of the AGT gene, including the polymorphic
site mentioned above. The amplified PCR purpose frag-
ment was purified by Wizard PCR Preps DNAPurification
Resin (Promega) and then sequenced using the BIG DYE
dideoxy-terminator chemistry (Perkin Elmer) on an ABI
3100 DNA sequencer.

Statistical analysis
All analyses were performed using SPSS statistical soft-
ware (Version 13.0; SPSS, Chicago, Illinois, USA). Allele
frequencies were calculated from the genotypes of all sub-
jects. The Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) was
assessed by chi-square analysis. Continuous data are pre-
sented as mean±standard deviation (SD). Differences
between groups were tested by chi-square-test for qualita-
tive parameters and by one-way analysis of variance for
quantitative parameters. Finally, stepwise multiple linear
regression analysis was performed to investigate the possi-
ble influence of AGT genotypes on SBP, DBP, PP and MAP
reductions in the whole study cohort; sex (where 0 indi-
cates female and 1 indicates male), age, baseline SBP, base-
line DBP, baseline heart rate, dose (where 0 indicates
no-dose increase and 1 indicates dose increase), and the
A-6G genotype (where 0 indicates AA, 1 indicates AG, and
2 indicates GG) were included as independent variables.
The entry and removal criteria used were p values of 0.05
for variable entry and p values of 0.10 for variable removal.
The associations found in multivariate analyses are reported
as multiple regression coefficients (b) (± SD) and as stand-
ardized regression coefficients (). All tests were two-tailed
and p<0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Results
Characteristics of the participants
AGT genotypes were determined for all patients. At the
end of the placebo period, 250 (49.1%) patients were
randomized to receive benazepril and 259 (50.9%)
patients to receive imidapril. Table 1 shows the AGT gen-
otype distribution, clinical characteristics, and biochemi-
cal parameters of the patients. The AA genotype was
observed in 301 patients (59.1%), the AG genotype was
observed in 186 patients (36.6%), and the GG genotype
was observed in 22 patients (4.3%). Allele frequencies
were 77.4% for the A allele and 22.6% for the G allele.
The genotype frequencies were shown to be in HWE
(x2=1.018679, df=1, p=0.312833).
Association analyses
In our hypertensive group, there were no significant differ-
ences in clinical baseline characteristics among the AA,
AG, and GG genotype groups. There were also no signifi-
cant differences among the three genotype groups in BP, PP
or MAP before or after treatment (Table 1). But there was a
significant association of AGTA­6G with BP, PP and MAP
reductions in response to ACE inhibitors therapy after six
weeks treatment (Table 2). The SBP reductions in patients
with the AA genotype, AG genotype, and GG genotype
were 13.7±11.8 mm Hg, 14.3±13.4 mm Hg, and 22.5±12.1
mm Hg, respectively (p=0.007). The DBP reductions in
patients with the AA genotype, AG genotype, and GG gen-
otype were 8.9±6.7 mm Hg, 7.8±7.7 mm Hg, and 12.1±6.7
mm Hg, respectively (p=0.014). The PP reductions in
patients with the AA genotype, AG genotype, and GG gen-
otype were 4.8±10.1 mm Hg, 6.5±11.8 mm Hg, and
10.3±10.0 mm Hg, respectively (p=0.027). The MAP
reductions in patients with the AA genotype, AG genotype,
and GG genotype were 10.5±7.3 mm Hg, 9.9±8.3 mm Hg,
and 15.6±7.5 mm Hg, respectively (p=0.005). The reduc-
tions in SBP, DBP, PP and MAP were significantly greater
in patients carrying the GG compared to AA or AG geno-
types (p<0.05). Stepwise multiple linear regression analy-
sis was also performed to investigate the possible influence
of the AGT genotypes on the response to therapy with ACE
inhibitors. The results showed that the A-6G genotype was
a significant predictor of SBP and PP reductions (p=0.040
and 0.019, respectively) (Table 3), which confirmed the
association between this variant and the response to ACE
inhibitors.
Discussion
AGT is the first gene product in the RAAS physiological
cascade. The AGT gene polymorphisms have been associ-
ated with BP-related phenotypes within different ethnic
groups and have been tested for their association with
responses to many hypertensive therapies, but the results
have been inconsistent.10,11 The objective of the present
study was to examine the association between the A-6G
variant of the AGT gene and the response to therapy with
ACE inhibitors. To our knowledge, this study appears to be
the first prospective study to investigate the association of
this polymorphism with PP and MAP response to ACE
inhibitors treatment.
The present study showed a lack of association of the
A-6G polymorphism with BP in a hypertensive popula-
tion, because the pretreatment BP was similar in the three
genotype groups, which may appear to be consistent with
the findings of Marin et al.12 However, opposite results
were reported by Filigheddu et al.13 and Brand-Herrmann
et al.14 In this study, the reduction in SBP and DBP after
six weeks of ACE inhibitor treatment was significantly
greater in patients carrying the GG genotype compared
with those carrying the AA or AG genotype. Furthermore,
in stepwise multiple regression analysis the AGT geno-
type was a significant predictor of SBP response to ACE
inhibitor treatment. The finding in this study appears rea-
sonable. The acute BP response to ACE inhibitors is
mainly due to vasodilation induced by reduction of the
plasma concentration of angiotensin II.15 AGT is the pre-
cursor of angiotensin II, and the plasma concentration of
AGT may be reflected in differences in the rate of forma-
tion of angiotensin II. It can be speculated that the -6G
allele is positively correlated with the level of plasma
AGT and the patients carrying the GG genotype have
Yu et al. 543
increased levels of AGT which are beneficial to ACE
inhibitors treatment, because prior studies have found that
the -6G allele is associated with increased risk for hyper-
tension in the Chinese populations4 and the -6G variant
was associated with a higher transcriptional activity than
is -6A variant.16 However, different results were reported
by Inoue et al.3 and Sarzani et al.17 With regard to previ-
ous pharmacogenetic studies, there are two such studies
that have investigated the association of the A-6G poly-
morphism and the BP response to monotherapy with ACE
inhibitors. Filigheddu et al.13 didn't find an association
between the A-6G polymorphism and BP reduction in
response to Fosinopril (ACE inhibitors) after four weeks
of treatment in 191 white patients with hypertension.
Another study, by Marin et al.12 yielded different results.

inhibitors for three years, the subjects carrying the AA
genotype had the largest DBP decrease. Two explanations
may account for the discrepancy between the previous
studies and our present findings. The most likely explana-
tion for such differences is genetic heterogeneity between
different populations. The studies by Marin et al.12 or
Filigheddu et al.13 were conducted in white hypertensive
populations, whereas our study was carried out in a
Chinese hypertensive population. There are large differ-
ences in G allele frequencies between the present cohort
(0.226) and the white hypertensive patients (0.575 or
0.527) studied by Marin et al.12 or Filigheddu et al.13 This
different allele frequency may have affected the different
results between Chinese and whites. This might somewhat
reflect the racial difference. As mentioned above, another
reason for inconsistent results among the study by Marin
et al.12 or Filigheddu et al.13 and the present findings could
be the differences in population characteristics, selection
criteria of the sample, agents used, study protocols, study
durations, and outcome measures. These differences are
likely to influence their phenotypes and may have a bear-
ing on the study results.
PP is a predictor of cardiovascular disease, and genes
likely influence PP levels.18­20 Few studies thus far have
examined the relationship between AGT genotypes and PP.
The study performed by Lynch et al.20 demonstrated that
women with the GG genotype had a lower PP, while men
with the GG genotype had a higher PP, compared with those
carrying an A allele in a hypertensive cohort. However, in
the present study, we found no significant differences in PP
between individuals with different A-6G genotypes in our
hypertensive patients and there were also no such differ-
ences in PP in the analysis stratified by sex (data not shown).
As we know, PP was used as a measurement of arterial stiff-
ness. Increased arterial stiffness is recognized as a risk fac-
tor for cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events. Several
methods exist to measure arterial stiffness, of which PP is
the simplest. Although PP is not the most sensitive method
to measure arterial stiffness, it has the advantage over other
methods that it has been recognized as a risk factor for car-
diovascular disease (CVD) and stroke.21,22 In our study, the
reduction in PP after six weeks of ACE inhibitor treatment
was significantly greater in patients carrying the GG com-
pared with AA or AG genotypes, and the result of the step-
wise multiple regression analysis also showed that the AGT
genotype was a significant predictor of the PP response to
ACE inhibitor treatment. As we know, components of the
RAAS are expressed in vascular smooth muscle cells. Local
production of AGT occurs in the media in response to arte-
rial injury,23 and AGT was shown to have direct effects on
vascular wall remodelling in vivo in a rat model.24 So, our
results suggest that genetic variation in AGT promoter area
may primarily affect arterial stiffness, and therefore PP
under ACE inhibitor therapy.
MAP, which is highly correlated with either SBP or
DBP, is the steady flow of blood through the aorta and its

arteries and equals the cardiac output multiplied by vascu-
lar resistance.5 Dyer et al. found that the steady component
of BP (highly correlated with MAP) was more strongly
associated with CVD risk than PP in four Chicago epide-
miological studies.25 There are so far very few studies that
have examined the relationship between AGT genotypes
and MAP. The present study showed a lack of association
of the A-6G polymorphism with baseline MAP in a hyper-
tensive population, which may appear to be consistent with
the findings of Bhuiyan et al.26 However, in our study, the
reduction in MAP after six weeks of ACE inhibitors treat-
ment was significantly greater in patients carrying the GG
compared with AA or AG genotypes. To the best of our
knowledge, this study has, for the first time, found that the
A-6G polymorphism was related to the PP reduction (men-
tioned above) and MAP reduction in response to antihyper-
tensive drugs. We, therefore, speculated that the patients
carrying the GG genotype may derive extra benefits with
the use of ACE inhibitors.
A limitation of our study is the relatively short therapeu-
tic duration. However, with the significant reduction in BP
after six-week treatment, we had sufficient statistical power
to confirm the relationship between A-6G variant of the
AGT gene and interindividual variation in the response to
ACE inhibitors. Another limitation of our study is that the
patients were only recruited from the Chinese Han popula-
tion. Studies in other ethnic populations and in larger
cohorts may be needed before final conclusions can been
drawn.
In conclusion, in this prospective study, positive and
continuous associations were observed between the SBP,
DBP, PP, and MAP response to ACE inhibitors and A-6G
variant of the AGT gene in hypertensive subjects. Our
observation might support the view that interindividual
variation in the efficacy of antihypertensive medications
may be influenced by genetic factors. This implies the
advantage of genotyping for selecting the optimal antihy-
pertensive treatment for the individual patient.
