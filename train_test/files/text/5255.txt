Introduction
In the current political climate, the teaching profession,
which was once considered a "stable, high-status profession
for the African American middle-class" (Ladson-Billings,
2005, p. 2), has become tenuous and is experiencing decline.
Job-related factors that contribute to attrition among all
teachers include high-stakes testing, retrenchment of tenure,
and increased pressure to improve student outcomes (Moore,
2012). Factors that contributed to fewer Black1 teachers in
the profession have also been attributed to school desegrega-
tion (Madkins, 2011; Tillman, 2004), inadequate preparation
for college (Irvine, 1988), standardized testing for teachers
(Leonard & Martin, 2013; Madkins, 2011), and increased
access and opportunity to pursue other professional careers
(Madkins, 2011).
Tracing the history of Black teachers in the United States,
Foster (1997) reported that Black teachers grew more than
fourfold from about 15,000 in 1890 to 66,000 in 1910, which
was 40% of all Black professionals (Ladson-Billings, 2005).
Prior to the Brown vs. Board decision in 1954, approximately
50% of all Black professionals in the United States, some
who were graduates of Historically Black Colleges and
Universities (HBCUs), were teachers (Madkins, 2011).
However, after the Brown v. Board ruling, nearly 40,000
Black teachers lost their jobs in 17 southern states from 1954
to 1972 (Fine, 2004; Irvine, 2002; Madkins, 2011; Tillman,
2004). From that time, the percentage of Black teachers con-
tinued to decline to the point where they represented 7% of
the teacher workforce in 1986 (Madkins, 2011). In the pres-
ent decade, the Black teacher workforce is approximately
8% (National Center for Educational Statistics, 2010), while
Black students represent 16% of the school population
(Madkins, 2011). There is great disparity between the per-
centage of Black teachers in the workforce and the percent-
age of Black students enrolled in U.S. schools (Fine, 2004;
Irvine, 2002; Madkins, 2011; Tillman, 2004). Thus, it is criti-
cal that teacher education programs become proactive in
recruiting and preparing Black teachers to teach in urban
settings.
While all teachers, regardless of race, can be trained to be
effective teachers of Black students (Leonard, 2008), some
theorists believe "minority teachers are particularly adept at
motivating and engaging minority students because they
often bring knowledge of student background to the class-
room that enhances students' educational experience" (i.e.,
culturally responsive pedagogy [CRP]; Mitchell, 1998, p.
105). Villegas (as cited in Mitchell, 1998) argued that teach-
ers of color familiar with students' cultural backgrounds are
more likely to build positive relationships between the home
and school to enhance student learning. Black teachers are
important in the teacher workforce because it is important for
Black students to see them as successful role models (Cooper,
2002; Leonard & Evans, 2008; Madkins, 2011; Mitchell,
1998). Although behaviors cannot be generalized, Black
teachers are more likely to be familiar with the cultural
nuances and vernacular of Black students and have the skills
and ability to motivate them to learn. Moreover, Black teach-
ers, historically, have served as inspirational models for

Recruiting and Retaining Black Teachers
to Work in Urban Schools
Brian R. Evans1 and Jacqueline Leonard2
Abstract
The purpose of this article is to examine teacher preparation from the perspective of novice Black teachers. While all
teachers, regardless of race, can be trained to be effective teachers of Black students, Black teachers can be more adept
at motivating and engaging students of color. Six Black teachers were interviewed to determine their experiences during
teacher preparation and induction. Findings revealed the teachers believed their programs were high quality and prepared
them well to teach in urban spaces, but some expressed concern about the swift immersion into the classroom.

college attainment (Madkins, 2011; Mitchell, 1998). In terms
of student outcomes, Black students attending predominantly
Black schools in New Jersey had higher mathematics
achievement when they were taught by Black teachers (Barr,
Sadovnik, & Visconti, 2006). Black students are more likely
to succeed when they have teachers who meet their aca-
demic, psychological, social, and emotional needs (Mitchell,
1998). In this era of accountability and teacher reform, it is
imperative to recruit and retain Black teachers to prepare
Black students (and all students) to be productive citizens
and to lead productive lives. Teacher preparation programs
are critical to the recruitment and development of diverse
teacher candidates.
The purpose of this article is to examine teacher prepara-
tion from the perspective of the novice teacher (i.e., less than
3 years experience). We will discuss traditional and alterna-
tive teacher preparation programs and Black teachers' expe-
riences in these programs. These teachers'voices are missing
from the literature regarding teacher retention and attrition.
Moore (2012) found that Black teachers were dissatisfied
with their jobs after analyzing School and Staffing Survey
(SASS) teacher data using school environment factors to
predict school dissatisfaction. In this article, we examine the
experiences of five teachers enrolled in alternative certifica-
tion programs and one additional teacher who completed a
traditional teacher preparation program. Teachers were inter-
viewed to determine their experiences during teacher prepa-
ration and induction. These six Black teachers comprised a
sample of convenience that entered the teaching field from
different pathways. Black teachers' counterstories about
their experiences in teacher education programs and in urban
schools are important if we are to understand the reasons
why they chose to teach, stay in teaching or leaving the field.
Prior to presenting and analyzing data collected from the par-
ticipants, the conceptual framework and literature review on
teacher quality and teacher certification programs are pre-
sented below.
Conceptual Framework
The conceptual framework that undergirds the principles in
this article is critical race theory (CRT), and the constructs
that support this theory are culturally responsive pedagogy
(CRP) and social justice pedagogy (SJP). CRT allows for
examination of deeper questions around equity and race,
challenging the colorblind approach of a traditional liberal
civil rights stance, and examining how citizenship and race
interact (Delgado, 1995; Ladson-Billings, 1998). The con-
cept of CRP emerged from the multicultural education litera-
ture of the 1970s. Gay (2000) defined culturally responsive
pedagogy as "using the cultural knowledge, prior experi-
ences, frames of reference, and performance styles of ethni-
cally diverse students to make learning encounters more
relevant and effective for them" (p. 29). CRP is based on the
assumption that "responsiveness to cultural differences is
fundamental to effective teaching and learning" (Gay, 2009,
p. 190). It is validating, comprehensive, multidimensional,
empowering, transformative, and emancipatory (Gay, 2000).
CRP creates the opportunity for students to learn in a third
space where ethnic ways of knowing are valued alongside
dominant canons of knowledge (Gay, 2000; Lipka et al.,
2005). CRP is an attempt to use the cultural capital that stu-
dents bring from home and community as a springboard to
learn. Cultural capital embodies the norms, ideologies, lan-
guage, behavior, mores, and practices of a particular group
and is transmitted to children as cultural knowledge (Howard,
2003; Sheets, 2005).
Rather than adhering to a deficit theory, teachers should
view students' culture as an asset on which to build new
knowledge. It is critical to understand the importance of
other ways of knowing and other forms of mathematical
activity (Greer, Mukhopadhyay, Powell, & Nelson-Barber,
2009). Culture is embedded in the natural world and influ-
ences every aspect of our lives. According to Nieto (2002),
Culture is the ever-changing values, traditions, social and
political relationships, and worldview created and shared by a
group of people bound together by a common history, geographic
location, language, social class, and/or religion and how these
are transformed by those who share them. (p. 53)
We define SJP as holding specific social-justice-related
perspectives and actions that provide all students with oppor-
tunities to learn core content in meaningful ways that seek to
improve the economic and social conditions of marginalized
individuals and groups and that work toward the reduction (if
not the complete elimination) of deficit-oriented beliefs and
dispositions (Leonard & Evans, 2012, p. 100). We use a
mathematics example as the authors are both faculty in math-
ematics education. The Young People's Project (YPP), an
outgrowth of the Algebra Project, uses critical literacy to
engage students in community-based and social-justice-ori-
ented mathematics activities. Critical literacy means "to
approach knowledge critically and skeptically, see relation-
ships between ideas, look for underlying explanations for
phenomena, and question whose interests are served and
who benefits" (Gutstein, 2006, p. 5). The mission of YPP is
to use mathematics literacy as a tool to develop young lead-
ers and organizers who radically change the quality of educa-
tion and quality of life in their communities so that all
children have the opportunity to reach their full human
potential (YPP, n.d.).
Teacher Quality
Teacher quality has become a major issue in education in the
United States in the last decade with the requirements of the
No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB; 2002). According to the
United States Department of Education, a highly qualified
teacher is one who has a bachelor's degree, full state
Evans and Leonard 3
certification or licensure, and can demonstrate content
knowledge in the subject area (U.S. Department of Education,
2004). Evidence for the final criterion is provided by com-
pletion of a content area major or equivalent number of cred-
its, and passing a standardized content examination. Poor
teacher quality can have a direct and negative impact on the
learning of Black students (Desimone & Long, 2010), espe-
cially in mathematics, which we know is a gatekeeper course
for access to college education (Martin, Gholson, & Leonard,
2010). Students' standardized mathematics scores are corre-
lated to school variables more so than standardized reading
scores, which are associated with home variables (Barr et al.,
2006). Thus, teachers' content knowledge and pedagogical
practices in mathematics have a tremendous impact on stu-
dents, particularly Black students whose mathematical expe-
riences have largely been shaped by a teaching style known
as the "pedagogy of poverty" (Haberman, 1991), which pro-
motes seatwork over critical thinking and problem solving.
While content knowledge is an important variable, prior
research has found that students'trust in teachers and the belief
that teachers care about them (i.e., "ethic of care") are strong
variables for academic success, particularly among Black chil-
dren (Gay, 2000; Ladson-Billings, 2009). While teachers in
traditional programs may need strong intentional support from
their educational programs and professional development to
foster the instilment of trust and care in their students, the
quick immersion of alternative certification teachers into the
classroom makes the development of an "ethic of care" more
critical for these teachers. This is particularly true for teachers
who have students who have been conditioned by prior experi-
ence to expect apathy from teachers who have not exhibited
genuine concern and care (Haberman, 1991).
Student learning can and should be measured in a myriad
of ways, including grades and creative products and produc-
tions (e.g., essays, reports, oratorical contests, acting in
plays, mathematical modeling, science fair projects, music,
and artistic ability). In addition to academics, education
should focus on the development of the whole child, which
not only includes intellectual but psychological, social, and
emotional growth (Haynes & Comer, 1990). The affective
domain is just as critical in motivating children to learn and
should be considered in the teaching and learning process
(Mitchell, 1998).
Teacher Education Programs
Since the publication of A Nation at Risk (National
Commission on Excellence in Education, 1983), teacher
education has undergone several decades of change. In 1980,
"there was a shift in teacher education away from the train-
ing approaches" where "prospective teachers were taught to
engage in classroom specific behaviors that had been shown
to be effective through programs of research correlating
classroom processes" with student achievement (Cochran-
Smith, 2004, p. 8). Instead, teacher education began to focus
on "teacher thinking, teacher knowledge, and teacher learn-
ing" (Cochran-Smith, 2004), particularly as it is related to
content knowledge and pedagogical content knowledge
(PCK; Shulman, 1987).
The 1990s ushered in the Standards movement, and
teacher educators shifted toward inclusion of standards-
based practices in content-based methods courses. By the
year 2000, the context shifted toward accountability along
with the passage of NCLB in 2001, which led to a focus on
student outcomes. About the same time as teacher prepara-
tion programs began to focus to outcomes-based assess-
ment, another trend emerged that focused on the theme of
teaching for social justice in teacher education programs
(Enterline, Cochran-Smith, Ludlow, & Mitescu, 2008).
Social justice orientations are also critical in helping teacher
candidates develop dispositions to work with poor urban
students and students of color whose backgrounds differ
from the teachers and to build classroom environments that
foster deep learning.
Traditional Education Programs
Traditional teacher education programs are generally housed
in schools or colleges of education. Many programs, but not
all, are designed to grant teacher licensure after completion
of a bachelor's degree with a program of study in early child-
hood, elementary, or secondary education. Other programs
only grant teacher licensure at the graduate level. Most of
these traditional teacher preparation programs reflect demo-
graphics that reveal about 80% to 93% of teacher candidates,
depending on the region of the country, identify as White
middle-class females (Cochran-Smith, 2004; Cooper, 2002;
Leonard & Evans, 2008; Mitchell, 1998). Other publications
have noted the need for more diversity in the teaching force
(Bireda & Chait, 2011; Irvine & Fenwick, 2009; National
Collaborative on Diversity in the Teaching Force, 2004).
Furthermore, regardless of entry level, almost all tradi-
tional education programs require teacher candidates to pass
Praxis examinations prior to admission to candidacy in a
teacher education program. Some researchers contend that
use of Praxis examinations as a basis of admission to teacher
education is one reason for the decline of Black teacher can-
didates (Madkins, 2011). Darling-Hammond (2000) argued
that Praxis tests do not predict teacher effectiveness and are
not valid measures of teacher preparation. Yet, these assess-
ments have become the norm in the current political climate.
In response to low passing rates among Black teacher candi-
dates, HBCUs have responded by offering test preparation
programs to improve the passing rate of their teacher candi-
dates. Nevertheless, traditional programs are rigorous and
require completion of a major or minor in the content and
anywhere from 200 to 800 student contact hours (e.g., prac-
tica and student teaching) at the undergraduate level, or 18
months to 2 years of intensive study at the graduate level
with student teaching.

Alternative Certification Programs
Alternative certification programs have been promoted as a
solution to teacher shortages in less affluent high-need urban
schools highly populated by Black and Latina/o students
(New York City Teaching Fellows [NYCTF], 2012a; Teach
for America [TFA], 2011a). Alternative certification pro-
grams allow candidates to enter the teaching profession in
urban schools by quickly entering the classroom and teach-
ing with a temporary certificate while earning a master's
degree in education and initial certification. While these pro-
grams have been criticized as quick fixes to teacher shortages
and placing teachers in classrooms without a great deal of
prior training, these nontraditional routes to teacher certifica-
tion have expanded tremendously over the past 30 years
(Madkins, 2011). Furthermore, these programs tap a differ-
ent pool of teacher candidates than traditional programs,
which includes older career changers and minority teacher
candidates (Fiestritzer as cited in Madkins, 2011). Programs
like TFAand the NYCTF program have had minimal to some
success in recruiting Black teachers to teach in urban schools
(Evans, 2010). Other programs, such as Teach Tomorrow in
Oakland (TTO), have been successful in recruiting diverse
candidates into teaching. TTO claimed that a TTO teacher
will be a "qualified, culturally diverse, educator who lives in
and is dedicated to the Oakland community" (TTO, 2013).
The TFA and NYCTF programs quickly immerse teacher
candidates into the teaching profession over the course of
several months. While they receive full teacher salaries
beginning in September, they are given summer stipends
when they begin the program in June and receive subsidized
tuition at their partnering universities throughout their time
spent in the programs. TFA and NYCTF teachers also take
graduate education courses taught by professors in their pro-
grams at partnering universities. In New York, for example,
these alternative certification teachers receive a Transitional
B license, which is a temporary and conditional teaching
license issued by the New York State Education Department,
which allows them to teach for 3 years before earning initial
certification. TFA teacher candidates may also be licensed in
other states through a similar process. Each of the two pro-
grams is described below.
TFA Program. TFA is a nonprofit organization that began in
1990 with the goal of sending high-achieving college gradu-
ates to high-need schools to teach underserved students in
urban and rural communities. Wendy Koop, TFA's founder, a
graduate of Princeton University, was interested in doing
something substantial after graduation (Kopp, 2003). Koop
realized that many recent college graduates at highly ranked
universities in the United States would consider teaching if
given the opportunity. TFA developed into a teacher corps
that allowed new graduates of prestigious universities, with
an interest in teaching, to quickly begin teaching students in
the communities with the highest need. Kopp considered
TFA could be like the Peace Corps in the 1990s and that
teachers would stay in education or go into other sectors but
remain advocates for public education.
TFA's mission "is to build the movement to eliminate edu-
cational inequity by enlisting our nation's most promising
future leaders in this effort" (TFA, 2011b), and TFA's vision
is that "one day, all children in this nation will have the
opportunity to attain an excellent education" (TFA, 2011c).
TFA recognizes the importance of SJP and makes every
attempt to recruit teacher candidates who have dispositions
amenable to SJP, and TFA claims to address it in their
teacher-training program (W. Seamans, personal communi-
cation, April 5, 2010). The TFA program requires that recent
college graduates commit to teaching for 2 years while tak-
ing coursework in teacher education, and they would serve in
high-need schools throughout the United States in urban and
rural communities. Approximately 68% of TFA teachers are
White and 11% are Black (TFA, 2011a).
According to the TFA 2010 annual report, there are more
than 20,000 TFA alumni throughout the United States (TFA,
2011d). On completion of the commitment to the program,
nearly two thirds of alumni stay in the field of education,
which is about 13,000, with about half of those alumni
remaining in the classroom, which is about 6,500 (TFA,
2011d). This means that about one third of TFA alumni stay
in the classroom on completion of their commitment. For
those who stay in the classroom, about 90% of them teach in
underserved communities (TFA, 2011d). However, critics of
TFA believe that after becoming certified, many TFA teach-
ers leave the field (Darling-Hammond, Holtzman, Gatlin, &
Heilig, 2005). Lassonde (2010) claimed that only 11% of
TFA teachers reported planning to teach 10 years or more.
Teacher quality in TFA. The findings on TFA teacher qual-
ity have been mixed. Darling-Hammond et al. (2005) found
certified teachers had significantly higher student achieve-
ment gains as compared with uncertified teachers, including
uncertified TFA teachers. Laczko-Kerr and Berliner (2002)
found that students of equally inexperienced, but fully cer-
tified teachers performed better than the students of TFA
teachers. It appears that certification is a key factor because
students of uncertified TFA teachers performed at the same
level as did students of other uncertified teachers (Darling-
Hammond et al., 2005; Laczko-Kerr & Berliner, 2002).
Contrary to these findings, TFA teachers had significantly
higher student achievement in mathematics when compared
with certified teachers from Grades 4 to 8, and there was an
advantage for TFA teachers, specifically in the middle school
years (Boyd, Grossman, Lankford, Loeb, Michelli, et al.,
2006; Kane, Rockoff, & Staiger, 2006). Xu, Hannaway, and
Taylor's (2008) study of secondary mathematics and science
teachers found that uncertified TFA teachers were more
effective, as measured by student achievement variables,
than traditionally certified teachers, including more experi-
enced traditionally certified teachers. Xu et al. (2008) noted
Evans and Leonard 5
TFA "recruits and selects graduates from some of the most
selective colleges and universities across the country" (p. 2),
and 62% of TFA teachers were educated at the most selective
and very selective higher education institutions while only
22% of non-TFA teachers were educated at these institutions.
Xu et al. (2008) further claimed that TFA teachers had higher
standardized tests scores than did non-TFA teachers, point-
ing out that "disparities do exist between TFA and non-TFA
teachers in terms of their academic preparation" (p. 17). Xu
et al. (2008) concluded perhaps TFA teachers were able to
offset their lack of experience through better academic prep-
aration or motivation.
According to TFA (2009) documentation, the National
Principal Survey found that more than 90% of the 1,248 prin-
cipals surveyed reported they were satisfied with TFA teach-
ers: TFA teachers made a positive impact in their schools;
TFA teachers were as effective as other beginning teachers in
overall performance and impact on student achievement; and
TFA teachers had comparable teacher preparation. Nearly
90% of principals said they would hire TFA teachers again
and that the impact of TFA teachers on student achievement
was excellent or good. Of particular interest is that nearly
90% of principals found TFA teachers to be knowledgeable
in their subject matter.
NYCTF Program. The NYCTF program is an alternative certi-
fication program developed in 2000 by the New Teacher
Project and the New York City Department of Education
(Boyd, Lankford, Loeb, Rockoff, & Wyckoff, 2007) with the
goal of bringing professionals from other careers to fill the
large teacher shortage in the public schools of New York.
When the program began, there was a predicted shortage of
7,000 teachers, which raised fears that there could be up to
25,000 teacher vacancies in the first decade of the 21st cen-
tury (Stein, 2002). The mission of NYCTF is "to recruit and
prepare high-quality, dedicated individuals to become teach-
ers who raise student achievement in the New York City
classrooms that need them most" (NYCTF, 2012b). NYCTF
teachers, often called Teaching Fellows, generally teach in
high-need urban schools throughout the city (Boyd, Gross-
man, Lankford, Loeb, & Wyckoff, 2006).
The NYCTF program is the largest alternative certification
program in New York (Kane et al., 2006), and it grew rapidly
during its early years: "Fellows grew from about 1% of newly
hired teachers in 2000 to 33% of all new teachers in 2005"
(Boyd et al., 2007, p. 10). Teaching Fellows represent about
one fourth of all New York mathematics teachers (NYCTF,
2012a). As of 2012, there were more than 8,000 Teaching
Fellows, which represented about 11% of all teachers work-
ing in New York (NYCTF, 2012c).About 40% of the teachers
in the NYCTF program are persons of color (NYCTF, 2012b),
which makes NYCTF a model for one of the most diverse
recruitment and retention programs in the nation.
Retention of Teaching Fellows has been comparable with
the retention of traditionally prepared teachers (Kane et al.,
2006). NYCTF reports that 92% of Teaching Fellows com-
pleted their 1st year of teaching, 75% completed at least 3
years of teaching, and more than half had taught for at least 5
years (NYCTF, 2012c). Boyd, Grossman, Lankford, Loeb,
Michelli, et al. (2006) reported about 46% of Teaching
Fellows stayed in teaching after 4 years as compared with
55% to 63% of traditionally prepared teachers. Sipe and
D'Angelo (2006) found about 70% of Teaching Fellows who
were in their 2nd year of the program intended to stay in
education.
Teacher quality in NYCTF.Teaching Fellows have, on
average, higher content test scores than other teacher can-
didates (Boyd et al., 2007), as measured by content certifi-
cation examinations. They also generally have high content
knowledge (Kane et al., 2006), as measured by undergradu-
ate grade point average and mathematics SAT scores. How-
ever, few differences were found between the mathematics
achievement levels of students in Grades 3 through 8 taught
by Teaching Fellows compared with traditionally prepared
teachers (Boyd, Grossman, Lankford, Loeb, Michelli, et al.,
2006; Kane et al., 2006). Kane et al. (2006) found
students assigned to teaching fellows [sic] performed similarly
to students assigned to certified teachers in math . . . This
average difference belies somewhat larger gaps among novice
teachers . . . and no difference between teaching fellows [sic]
and certified teachers with multiple years of experience. (p. 41)
After several years of teaching experience, however, the stu-
dents of Teaching Fellows outperformed the students of tra-
ditionally prepared teachers (Boyd, Grossman, Lankford,
Loeb, Michelli, et al., 2006).
Method
CRT uses counternarratives as a method for qualitative anal-
ysis (Solórzano & Yosso, 2002) to tell the stories of "people
whose experiences are not often told, including people of
color, women, gay, and the poor" (Solórzano & Yosso, 2002,
p. 26). Counterstories are important because they present the
narratives of marginalized people, which often stand in con-
trast to dominant narratives. We use counterstories in this
article as a method to capture the voices and concerns of nov-
ice Black teachers, some who left and others who remain in
the teaching profession.
Setting
We chose to interview teachers who were trained in tradi-
tional or alternative certification programs in the Mid-Atlantic
region of the United States. Our assumption was that these
teachers had a variety of experiences and would most likely
work with predominantly Black and linguistically diverse
children in large urban districts. Four of the teachers we
6 SAGE Open
interviewed were trained in alternative certification programs
in New York City and another in Washington, D.C. We also
interviewed one teacher who completed a traditional prepara-
tion program in Philadelphia. These teachers consequently
worked in predominantly Black school districts in New York,
Washington, D.C., and Maryland, respectively.
Participants
We conducted interviews with six Black teachers who had
taught 3 years or less. They ranged from 22 to 60 years of age
when they began teaching. However, given that some of
these teachers had more teaching experience than others,
their ages ranged from 25 to 60 when they were interviewed.
Five of the teachers were female and one was male.
Pseudonyms are used for anonymity. Two of the teachers,
Dana (25 years old) and Faith (25 years old), were licensed
to teach through TFA--one in New York and one in
Washington, D.C., respectively. Three of the teachers, Carol
(24 years old), Alice (53 years old), and Benjamin (60 years
old) obtained licensure through the NYCTF program. The
sixth teacher, Elizabeth (31 years old) was licensed by com-
pleting a traditional graduate teacher education program.
These teachers taught a variety of levels from first grade to
middle school and regular to bilingual and special education
students.
Interviews
We developed a protocol that was emailed to each of the
teachers for completion. Then, we telephoned each teacher to
follow up on the interview protocol with additional queries.
Field notes were recorded during the telephone interview.
Interview responses and field notes yielded two pages of
responses per participant.
Analysis
We analyzed the interview data for themes and patterns using
the constant comparison method (Glaser & Strauss, 1967).
The analysis involved the two authors reading and rereading
the transcribed text separately, sharing independent ideas,
and then coming to consensus on the interpretative of data.
Findings
The themes that emerged, while a direct result of the protocol,
were (a) perceptions of program quality, (b) perceptions of
teacher preparedness, (c) teaching styles, and (d) teacher
retention and attrition. Summary statements and direct quotes
will be presented to examine these six Black teachers'experi-
ences in terms of induction, mentoring, and support.Although
their teaching experiences ranged from 8 days to 3 years, the
voices of teachers new to the field are needed to understand
retention and attrition issues among Black teachers.
Perceptions of Program Quality
As teaching for social justice has become a watchword in
many teacher education programs (Enterline et al., 2008),
we specifically queried whether SJP was part of these six
teachers' training. Five of the six teachers reported that
SJP was part of their training. The male teacher, Benjamin,
who was trained in the NYCTF program, was the only
teacher who did not think SJP was a major focus of his
program: "I think people step around it, but don't address
it too much . . . " Alice, another NYCTF stated that SJP
was only emphasized in one course. Carol was more spe-
cific stating, "There is disparity of resources in high-needs
schools, specifically in special education; wealthier com-
munities have more resources." Among the TFA teachers,
there was a mixed response. Faith, the D.C. teacher with
TFA training, stated that SJP was not part of her TFA train-
ing but part of the graduate program through a Foundations
of Education course. Dana, who was new to the TFA pro-
gram reported that SJP was part of TFA training and gradu-
ate courses. Dana's self-report is consistent with Seamans'
personnel communication that TFA addressed SJP in the
teacher training program. However, Seamans' comment
was based on his experience in the Western United States.
The information reported here reveals that emphasis on
SJP may vary within TFA for different regions of the
country.
In addition to SJP, the teachers were queried about the
strengths of their teacher education program. Self-reports
from the teachers reveal the following:
I had two different field placements focused on urban schools.
(Elizabeth, traditional program)
Teach for America offer [sic] a lot of support both inside and
outside of the classroom to its corps members. It is as if they
hold you by the hand through the process. While the work is
demanding, it is both necessary and important. (Dana, TFA)
Rigorous lesson planning with a collaborative team led by an
experienced Teach for America teacher for five weeks; graduate
school alternative certification and master's program with other
students new to teaching in the same school district; strong
course reading materials; TFA support throughout the year.
(Faith, TFA)
The program strength is centered on child psychology and
human development and the different courses and different
professors we have. The social justice aspect in one course really
helped me. Currently, I'm taking human development and it has
this [SJP] aspect to it and is interesting. (Alice, NYCTF)
Prepared you for what will see in terms of curriculum and
behaviors (classroom management). (Benjamin, NYCTF)
Curriculum planning and resources to connect to the Common
Core State Standards; lesson planning. (Carol, NYCTF)
Evans and Leonard 7
Analyses of these responses reveal Elizabeth, the tradi-
tional teacher, focused on field placement in urban schools,
which was probably important to her as a Black teacher.
Interestingly, a key word that was used by both of the TFA
teachers was support. Dana and Faith talked about the types
of support they received from the TFA network. However,
Faith was explicit in terms of describing the rigorous training
involved in learning to teach, specifically as it related to les-
son planning. A common thread among NYCTF teachers
was curriculum and courses.Alice resonated positively about
her child development courses, which were most likely
important to her as a middle school teacher. Benjamin was
the only teacher to mention classroom management at this
juncture. However, this was no doubt important to him as a
middle school special education teacher of autistic children.
When asked what they would change about their teacher
education program, the responses reveal changes in policies
or procedures that these novice teachers believed would
improve the quality of their teacher education program:
More diversity among graduate students. (Elizabeth, traditional
program)
I would allow people to obtain graduate degrees in more than
just teaching. I think there are other graduate programs that
would equip corps members with the proper training and
preparation to be a successful influence in urban communities.
(Dana, TFA)
Not feeling like we are using summer school students as "guinea
pig" subjects. (Faith, TFA)
It needs to be a little bit longer. Just having the summer and then
going into the schools is difficult. Sometimes you're lucky and
have great colleagues, who will help, but I have classmates who
go into schools without any help, and this is difficult on first-
year teachers. We have a lot of knowledge, but we don't know
where to start. It took a year to figure a lot of this out. They need
to give us more than 2-3 months before becoming teachers.
(Alice, NYCTF)
I took an autism workshop but hadn't done a lesson plan for an
autism class. How do I structure a unit or a lesson plan to meet
the body of students who cannot understand? That's challenging!
(Benjamin, NYCTF)
More workshops where we can have hands on materials and
actually create something. (Carol, NYCTF)
Interestingly, these teachers' comments are program spe-
cific. Elizabeth's comment about lack of diversity in tradi-
tional teacher education programs concurs with the literature
(Cooper, 2002; Irvine, 2002; Madkins, 2011; Tillman, 2002).
Dana, while new to TFA, suggested the program broaden its
availability of support for other types of graduate study. This
comment, while unintentional, actually creates a barrier to
retaining Black teachers in the field of education. Expanded
opportunities for Blacks to attain other degrees led to the
decline of education majors (Madkins, 2011). Faith's com-
ment reveals her personal values and mores about using stu-
dents as subjects to learn about practice. Whether contrived
or not, it is important for teachers to have field experiences.
Learning can be dialectic in such settings in which students
and teachers learn from each other. Notably, all of the
NYCTF mentioned receiving more training in terms of field
experience (Alice), lesson planning (Benjamin), or develop-
ment of curriculum resources (Carol). These comments, too,
concur with some critics of alternative teacher education pro-
grams that early immersion is detrimental to teachers and
students (Darling-Hammond et al., 2005).
Perceptions of Teacher Preparedness
The teachers in the NYCTF program indicated they felt well
prepared by their programs. Alice also mentioned emphasis
on social justice in her program. The others indicated plan-
ning and curriculum as program strengths. While Benjamin
indicated he felt well prepared by his program to teach urban
students, Alice and Carol indicated that it took them more
time to feel comfortable. They both alluded to not being pre-
pared for the lack of resources in the schools. In the case of
TFA teachers, Dana believed, although she had not yet
taught, that she would be well prepared by her program.
Faith also indicated that she felt well prepared and identified
classroom management courses and the TFA summer insti-
tute as assets that helped to prepare her for teaching in urban
schools. Elizabeth reported that her field placements were of
significant assistance in her preparation, particularly in
working with urban students. Elizabeth also mentioned prep-
aration in cultural relevance and SJP as part of her program
to prepare her to work with urban children.
Teaching Styles
When the data were analyzed, themes related to teaching
styles also emerged. Because mathematics achievement is
more aligned with school variables (Barr et al., 2006), we
asked teachers if they connected SJP to their teaching of
mathematics. When it came to pedagogy, Alice indicated
that she connected mathematics instruction to social justice
by attempting to connect the content to her students' experi-
ences and lives. She emphasized economics and used every-
day purchases as examples. An example of her mathematics
connection to increase student motivation included collect-
ing data on the music produced by famous hip-hop artists,
which also made connections to CRP. Carol, who had 2
years of prior teaching experience and taught early child-
hood special education students, indicated that she did not
connect mathematics to social justice as frequently as she
did with English and social studies, particularly noting that
connections to social justice were made during Black
History month. Benjamin had only been teaching for 8 days,
8 SAGE Open
and he reported not having the opportunity to make connec-
tions to social justice. Benjamin also stated he believed his
autistic students were too low functioning to connect this
well, but claimed he made connections to social justice with
parents and other teachers. However, he did not provide any
examples. Dana (TFA), who did not have the opportunity to
teach in an actual classroom setting prior to the interview,
indicated
I will try to. Teaching in an urban community, the issue of social
justice is important. Its importance should be obvious to the
students. If it is not naturally obvious, I think it is our jobs as
educators to make it known.
Elizabeth, who taught first-grade students in a large urban
school district in Maryland, reported using SJP only in liter-
acy but did not incorporate CRP even though her methods
courses addressed cultural relevance and funds of knowl-
edge. On further probing, she reported she was simply too
overwhelmed with curriculum implementation and class-
room management to make consistent links to CRP and SJP.
When queried, Faith stated that she did not use CRP or SJP
to teach core curriculum even though she taught PreK-5
English Language Learners. However, on further probing
she explained that she did use elements of culture to help her
students understand English vocabulary. Perhaps the
demands placed on these two teachers in Maryland and
Washington, D.C., inhibited them from going the extra step
to ensure their lessons were more relevant to the lives of their
students. New teachers have many tasks to attend to (e.g.,
taking attendance, collecting lunch money, communicating
with parents, classroom management, and lesson planning),
and, as a result, CRP and SJP may simply be overlooked.
When it came to implementing lesson plans, all three
NYCTF teachers indicated that they do not follow a script in
their teaching, which meant they had some freedom in their
instruction. It should be noted that New York State has
adopted the Common Core State Standards, which allows
teachers to develop their own lesson plans as long as the
Standards are met. Unlike the NYCTF teachers, Elizabeth
and Faith indicated they were more inclined to teach with a
script because the districts strictly aligned lesson planning to
Standards and were preoccupied with making Annual Yearly
Progress (AYP) as required by NCLB (2001).
Teacher Retention and Attrition
While three of the teachers had taught less than 1 year,
teacher retention and attrition emerged as a theme among
this group of novice Black teachers. Two of the NYCTF
teachers with less than 1 year of experience were older
nontraditional teacher candidates. Recall that Alice was 53
and Benjamin was 60. Alternative certification programs
often attract older teacher candidates who are most likely
to be career changers (Madkins, 2011). While it is difficult
to speculate what the attrition rate would be among teach-
ers with less than 1 year of experience, Alice (NYCTF)
stated,
I plan to stay in teaching and get certified in autism. This is the
biggest population I'm working with. I plan to teach for at least
the next 10 years and stay in special education. Maybe I'll be in
an administration position eventually. I work with the PTA, and
I think it's important to create a school community. Everyone
working together is like the village raising the child. We need
the sense of community, and we don't have this. There is not a
community investment. The only way to do that is to create
activities that create the school community. Students succeed
when there's a strong school community.
Alice's remarks reveal a strong sense of commitment to
teaching, students, parents, and the community. Her care,
concern, and values align with those of older teachers found
in Mitchell's (1998) study. Mitchell considered teaching as
more than the mere transfer of academic knowledge, but
considered variables in the affective domain such as cultur-
ally relevant pedagogy. Teaching was meaningful and engag-
ing work with ramifications that went beyond the schoolhouse
door. Like the teachers in Mitchell's study, Alice spent
money out of her own pocket on her students. Teaching was
not a profession but a calling. This evidence suggests that
Alice would most likely remain in education despite current
challenges.
This was not the case, however, for Faith and Elizabeth.
Recall Faith was a TFA teacher prepared in Washington,
D.C., and Elizabeth received licensure after completing a
graduate teacher education program. They were 24 and 26,
respectively, when they left the teaching profession. Both of
these young Black women were talented and gifted. They
graduated at the top of their high school classes and attended
prestigious undergraduate institutions in the Midwest. They
had very high ideals and goals when they entered the teach-
ing profession and were committed to their students. Faith
reported that she often stayed up until 10 or 11 p.m. prepar-
ing her lessons and only had 4 or 5 hours of sleep during the
week. Elizabeth often went to work at 6:30 a.m. and stayed
until 4 p.m. during her first 2 years to prepare her lessons and
make sure she attended to her first-grade students' academic
and developmental needs. When asked why they left the
field, they responded,
I did not like the testing requirements for students to measure
AYP. I had to proctor students who were in special education
while my own students had a sub because only certified teachers
could proctor special education students. It was a lot of stress
and confusion. My first-grade students did not like testing. We
were encouraged to minimized areas of instruction in health,
social studies, and the arts because they were not aligned with
the testing. I left teaching because I felt stifled and was not able
to be the creative teacher that I wanted to be. (Elizabeth,
traditional program)
Evans and Leonard 9
I did not feel like I had the support I needed from the school
district to succeed without stressing. I had met my two-year
commitment, and I was ready to move on. (Faith, TFA)
Elizabeth and Faith left the teaching profession after only
a few years, adding to the high rate of attrition and the teacher
shortage. According to Ingersoll (2002), about one third of
new teachers leave the field in the first 3 years. At the time of
this interview, Elizabeth was pursuing a doctorate degree in
education and planned to enter the professoriate. Thus,
although she left the classroom, she did not leave the field of
education and perhaps could make a difference in teacher
preparation. Faith, however, left the field of education alto-
gether. She recently began her own business and was work-
ing in New York in the fashion and cosmetic industry. While
the sample is too limited to draw any conclusions from the
data on teacher attrition, it is clear that school environment
factors such as overemphasis on student outcomes and lack
of support caused these two young Black teachers dissatis-
faction and ultimately caused them to leave their schools.
Discussion
While the sample of teachers interviewed in this study was
very small and cannot be generalized, the vignettes and find-
ings delineated above shed important insight into these six
Black teachers' experiences as teacher candidates and as
teachers in urban schools. First, they all believed their pro-
grams were of high quality and prepared them well to teach
in urban spaces. However, the traditionally trained teacher
was keenly aware of the lack of diversity in her program. If
teacher education programs are going to make a difference in
preparing teachers for urban schools, they must be serious
about the recruitment and retention of teachers of color in
their teacher preparation programs. This involves more than
putting pictures of diverse teacher candidates on brochures
but rather truly examining admission criteria and assessing
programs to ensure candidates from diverse ethnic and lin-
guistic backgrounds are made welcome, treated fairly, and
receive the supports they need to succeed. This also involves
recruiting and retaining teacher educators of color who can
serve as mentors and advocates for teacher candidates of
color (Ladson-Billings, 2005).
Second, some NYCTF teachers had expressed concern
that the swift immersion into the classroom may not be ideal
for them or their students. Being thrust into a classroom
without sufficient field experience and opportunities to
develop best practices can be disastrous. It forces new teach-
ers to sink or swim, and in many cases the teachers sink,
leaving the profession far too soon and thus doing more dam-
age to urban students who should receive the best teachers
(Darling-Hammond, 2000; McNeil, 2012).
Third, teacher educators must model how to engage in
pedagogical practices that research has shown to be effective
with children of color (e.g., CRP and SJP; Cochran-Smith,
2004; Ladson-Billings, 1995; Leonard, 2008; Tate, 2008).
Four of the six teachers in this sample who were actual class-
room teachers did not fully use CRP and SJP to their advan-
tage. One in particular noted that she only made connections
during Black History month. While use of CRP or SJP is not
a panacea, research has shown that these pedagogies can
motivate children of color to learn (Lipka et al., 2005;
Madkins, 2011; Villegas & Lucas, 2004). Future studies
should investigate to what extent novice teachers have the
flexibility to incorporate CRP and SJP into the curriculum
given the current impetus on student outcomes. It is impor-
tant that all teachers learn to teach for cultural relevance and
social justice to motivate and empower all students (affective
domain) and attend to content knowledge to impact student
outcomes (cognitive domain) to prepare more students for
college and inspire some of them to pursue teaching as a
career.
Finally, the collective experiences of these novice Black
teachers can be communicated to teacher candidates in initial
licensure programs and potential administrators in principal
licensure programs. Moreover, teacher educators and deans
of schools and colleges of education should be aware of the
barriers that inhibit the enrollment of Black teachers in tradi-
tional teacher education programs. While admission require-
ments such as passing Praxis I & II may be difficult to waive,
support such as tutorials like those offered at HBCUs
(Madkins, 2011) or financial support in the form of waivers
to take the exams can be provided. Principals and superinten-
dents should be made aware of variables that contribute to
teacher satisfaction. For example, teacher autonomy and
control over the curriculum are highly correlated with teacher
satisfaction (Moore, 2012). Administrators should use such
information to create school environments that encourage
teacher retention.
Policy Implications
Recently, teacher education programs have taken criticism in
regard to training high-quality teachers for urban classrooms
(McNeil, 2012). Secretary of Education,Arne Duncan, stated
that "teacher preparation is broken and that the best educa-
tors need to be teaching the highest-need children" (McNeil,
2012, n.p.). The teacher pipeline has become a "revolving
door" where one in five teachers quit annually (Ingersoll,
2002; Moore, 2012). Teacher stress coupled with pressure to
improve student outcomes on high-stakes tests have been
linked to teacher dissatisfaction (Moore, 2012). Recent
changes in education policy in regard to meeting AYP have
resulted in 33 states receiving waivers to opt out of NCLB
(Resmovits, 2012). It remains to be seen what impact this
will have on student performance and teacher retention.
Two of the six teachers interviewed in this study quit within
the first 3 years. Interestingly, both teachers felt compelled to
teach scripted lessons and listed teacher stress when queried
about their decisions to quit. One identified lack of resources
10 SAGE Open
and the other excessive testing, as additional reasons for leav-
ing the classroom. Once teachers are prepared and licensed,
schools and colleges of education have little to do with the
school environment where teachers work. Schools and dis-
tricts must also be accountable for teacher retention. Arne
Duncan surmised that there are no schools or districts that
"work `systematically'to identify the best teachers and princi-
pals, then place them with the children with the highest needs"
(McNeil, 2012, n.p.). Going a step further, we know of no
school or district that provides the newest teachers with the
best resources and latitude to creatively work with students
without mandates. School environments must be conducive to
teaching and learning and trust that teachers, who have com-
pleted more rigorous requirements than ever in the history of
education, can do the job. Rather than deskilling teachers, we
must find ways to restore respect for the position.
Recruiting and training Black teachers to work with Black
students in urban and small urban school districts should be
a national priority. High school dropout rates remain dispro-
portionally high among African American students and col-
lege attainment among underrepresented students of color is
below the national norm (Leonard & Evans, 2012; Mitchell,
1998; Viadero, 2005). It is important to increase the diversity
of the teacher workforce so that all students can experience
the passion and plurality that teachers of different back-
grounds bring to the classroom. Past history reveals that
Black teachers made a significant difference when it came to
educating Black children, even in the face of limited
resources (Irvine, 2002; Madkins, 2011; Mitchell, 1998;
Siddle Walker, 2000; Villegas & Lucas, 2004).
Alternative certification programs continue to increase in
size. These programs appear to be more attractive to older
career changers and prospective Black teachers. Rather than
criticizing these programs, perhaps schools and colleges of
education should work with leaders of alternative programs
to ensure that more diverse teachers are recruited, supported,
and trained to teach effectively in urban schools. Clearly,
changing the direction of the current course in teacher educa-
tion is needed if teacher preparation, as we know it, intends
to remain relevant. Adhering to the concerns voiced by the
teachers in this study may increase teacher satisfaction and
reverse the exodus of Black teachers from the field.
