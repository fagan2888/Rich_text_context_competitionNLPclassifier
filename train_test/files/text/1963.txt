An Empirical Investigation of Factors Influencing
Career Satisfaction of Primary Care Physicians
Satish P. Deshpande, PhD, and Jim DeMello, DBA
Background: The purpose of this study was to examine factors that influence career satisfaction of 3
types of primary care physicians (PCPs): internal medicine (IM) physicians, family/general medicine
(FGM) physicians, and pediatricians.
Methods: This was a secondary analysis of the Center for Studying Health System Change's 2008
Health Tracking Physician Survey. Regression analysis was done to examine the impact of environ-
mental-, practice quality­, compensation-, and demographic-related factors on career satisfaction
of IM physicians (n  504), FGM physicians (n  693), and pediatricians (n  363).
Results: Nineteen percent of PCPs have been practicing for >30 years. Pediatricians had the highest
career satisfaction. Although the threat of malpractice lawsuits significantly lowered career satisfaction
(  0.177, 0.153, and 0.146), patient interaction (  0.242, 0.321, and 0.346) and income
(  0.132, 0.151, and 0.170) significantly increased career satisfaction of IM physicians, FGM physi-
cians, and pediatricians, respectively. Ownership significantly lowered career satisfaction of IM physi-
cians and pediatricians (  0.168 and 0.114, respectively). Inadequate quality care significantly
lowered career satisfaction of pediatricians (  0.102). The 3 regression models accounted for only
16% (IM physicians), 17% (FGM physicians), and 21% (pediatricians) of the variance in career satisfac-
tion.
Conclusions: Steps like giving adequate time for interaction with patients, reducing potential threats
of malpractice lawsuits, and improving income may increase PCPs' career satisfaction. (J Am Board Fam

A number of studies in the recent past have exam-
ined physicians' career satisfaction.1­8 Research in-
dicates that physicians who are satisfied with their
careers are more likely to provide better health care
and have more satisfied patients.9,10 Moreover, dis-
satisfaction among physicians in a particular spe-
cialization can lead to declining numbers of medi-
cal graduates of that specialty,11,12 an increase in
rates of medical errors related to job stress,13
unionization,14 strikes,15 and even exodus from the
medical profession.16
Although the overall level of satisfaction
among physicians in the United States has been
consistently fairly high (around 80%), there is
noticeable variation of satisfaction levels among
various medical specialties.2 Primary care physi-
cians (PCPs; including family medicine, internal
medicine, pediatrics, and general practice) have
consistently ranked in the bottom tier.2,5 This is
disturbing because PCPs are in a unique position
to lower health care costs by having close contact
with patients, listening to them, and avoiding the
prescription of unnecessary and expensive medi-
cal procedures.17,18
Politicians and policy makers agree that one of
the main reasons why the US health care system
is in a state of disarray is the increased emphasis
on technology and specialty care at the expense
of quality primary care and prevention.19 PCPs
are expected to be the gatekeepers, care manag-

ers, and resource allocators in an integrated
health system, yet the current reimbursement
policies favor specialists and discount the services
provided by primary care. Longer work days,
lower pay, less prestige, and increased adminis-
trative headaches are eroding PCPs' satisfaction
and, in some cases, causing earlier retireme-
nts.20
As a result, the number of medical students
electing to go into primary care has been signif-
icantly declining. According to the American
Academy of Family Physicians, since 1997 the
number of US medical school students going into
primary care has dropped by 51.8%, and it is
estimated that by 2020 there will be a shortage of
more than 40,000 primary care doctors in the United
States. Moreover, because universal health care is a
reality and approximately 32 million currently unin-
sured Americans have to be absorbed into the system,
the need for PCPs is bound to escalate.21
The role of PCPs is bound to take on a much
higher level of importance if the push toward patient-
centered medical homes gains steam.19,20 These med-
ical homes are designed to deliver better coordinated,
easily accessible, continuous, comprehensive, family-
centered, and culturally sensitive primary health care
with a focus on prevention, safety, quality, and ap-
propriate reimbursement via a team approach.
Within such a system, much of the routine, time-
consuming tasks are performed by nurse practitio-
ners and physician assistants, leaving the PCPs
more time to listen to and adequately treat pa-
tients.19,20
Previous studies regarding career satisfaction of
PCPs have indicated some interesting trends and raised
some important questions. Buchbinder, Melick, and
Powe22 conducted a cohort study of 507 PCPs, aged
younger than 45 years, who were interviewed twice (in
1987 and again in 1991) and asked overlapping ques-
tions regarding their overall career satisfaction. Fifty-
five percent of all the PCPs had changed jobs
during the 5-year period, with 20% of the PCPs
having left 2 jobs. Thus, they concluded that
there is a clear link between PCP job satisfaction
and PCP turnover. They recommended that it is
important for health care planners to understand
the main reasons for PCPs' discontent and to
develop policies designed to reduce turnover.22
Another survey of PCPs conducted in 2006 for
Physicians Practice,23 a leading national medical
practice management publication, found that
more than 50% of PCPs considered themselves
"second-class citizens" compared with surgical
and diagnostic specialists. In addition, almost two
thirds of PCPs reported that they would choose
another field if they could do over their careers.
Approximately 39% of the 508 responding PCPs
said they would become surgical or diagnostic
specialists, whereas approximately 22% said they
would not choose medicine as a career.23
In an attempt to shed some light on the de-
clining level of satisfaction,24 decreasing sense of
professional autonomy,25 and "feelings of pow-
erlessness"26 in the complex health care environ-
ment within which PCPs operate,27 Katerndahl
et al28 used Community Tracking Survey data
collected during 3 consecutive periods (ie, 1996­
1997, 1998­1999, and 2000­2001) to examine
the relationships of both perceived autonomy and
perceived complexity of care on PCPs career
satisfaction. They concluded that there is consid-
erable interaction between perceived complexity
of care, perceived autonomy, and career satisfac-
tion of PCPs. However, they point out that,
because the predictors of career satisfaction in
their study explained less than 15% of the vari-
ance, there must be more factors involved in
satisfaction and perceived autonomy than those
they measured.
Given the significant role that PCPs play in an
integrated, complex health care system and the
impending shortage of PCPs that has been fore-
casted for the next decade, it is imperative for
health care policy makers and medical school
directors to have a good understanding of the
factors causing career dissatisfaction among
PCPs. This knowledge will help health care pro-
fessionals provide medical students with ade-
quate career counseling, frame policies that will
enhance the work environment, improve com-
pensation/reimbursement methods, and increase
satisfaction levels among PCPs, thereby improv-
ing the overall quality and access of primary care
in the United States. The purpose of this study
was to conduct an empirical investigation of the
relationship between career satisfaction of vari-
ous PCP specialty groups and factors associated
with their work environment, practice quality,
compensation, and demographics. The findings
helped to establish a new baseline that can be
used to track how various PCP specialty groups

like internal medicine, family/general medicine,
and pediatrics organize and practice medicine.
Methods
Sample
The Center for Studying Health System Change
(HSC)'s 2008 Health Tracking Physician Survey
was the source of the data used in this study.29 The
HSC is a Washington D.C.­based organization
that is partly funded by the Robert Wood Johnson
Foundation and that is affiliated with Mathematica
Policy Research. Part of its mission is to improve
the health of the public. This nonpartisan organi-
zation conducts studies about the US health care
system with the objective of ensuring that reliable
and unbiased information is available to those mak-
ing policy decisions. The 2008 HSC survey was
funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation
and the data files and documentation are available
through the Inter-University Consortium for Po-
litical and Social Research.30 One of the objectives
of this survey was to establish a new baseline to
track how physicians organize and practice medi-
cine.
The sample frame of this study was derived
from a list of physicians from the American Med-
ical Association. The American Medical Associ-
ation master file had a list of 735,378 physicians
as of July 2007. After deletion of inaccurate and
incomplete items in the data file, the HSC was
left with a sampling frame of 550,260 physicians.
The HSC used stratification procedures to iden-
tify a sample of physicians to be surveyed for the
study. The procedure ensured that there was an
adequate sample size for various populations and
that the respondents of the survey belonged to all
50 states and the District of Colombia. The HSC
surveyed 10,250 physicians between February
2008 and October 2008. One thousand two hun-
dred thirty-six physicians refused to participate
in the survey, and 2683 physicians did not re-
spond to the survey. One thousand six hundred
eleven returned surveys were rejected because
they were from ineligible physicians. The survey
excluded residents, fellows, Federal employees,
and foreign medical school graduates who were
temporarily licensed to practice in the United
States. It also did not include specialists whose
primary focus was not direct patient care. In the
end, 4720 completed surveys were received from
eligible physicians. The HSC 2008 Health
Tracking Physician Survey Methodology Report
provides detailed information about the stratifi-
cation procedure, target population, survey de-
sign, and data collection procedures.31
This study used only responses of PCPs (inter-
nal medicine, family medicine/general medicine,
and pediatrics) from the Health Tracking Physician
Survey. After list-wise deletion for missing values
we were left with a usable sample of 504 internal
medicine physicians, 693 family/general medicine
physicians, and 363 pediatricians. More informa-
tion about the variables used in this study is avail-
able online.32 In addition, information about the
measurement scale of each variable used in our
study is provided in Table 1.
Dependent Variable
Career satisfaction was the dependent variable of
this study. The overall satisfaction of a physician's
career in medicine was measured on a 5-point Lik-
ert scale, ranging from a high of very satisfied to a
low of very dissatisfied.
Independent Variable
The independent variables of this study were
grouped into 4 categories. They are (1) environ-
mental issues, (2) practice quality, (3) compensa-
tion, and (4) physician demographics.
Environmental Issues
Environmental issues consisted of degree of own-
ership, use of information technology, and if the
physicians worked most of their time in private
practice (yes/no). Ownership was measured (from
high to low) on a 3-point scale. Use of information
technology consisted of 16 items. These items ex-
amined the use of information technology in the
areas of clinical practice, patient information, and
prescription drugs.
Practice Quality
Practice quality factors included inadequate quality
care, threat of malpractice, and patient interaction.
Inadequate quality care consisted of 8 items that
could limit a physician's ability to provide high-
quality care to patients. These items included re-
jection of care decision by insurance, lack of qual-
ified specialists in the area, patients' inability to pay
for needed care, inadequate time with patients, not
getting reports in time, difficulty communicating
764 JABFM November­December 2010 Vol. 23 No. 6 http://www.jabfm.org
with patients, patients not complying with treat-
ment recommendations, and medical errors in hos-
pitals. These items were measured on a 3-point
scale.
Threat of malpractice was measured using 5
items. These items asked the respondents the ex-
tent to which they agreed that (1) they were con-
cerned that they will be involved in a malpractice
case sometime during the next 10 years, (2) they felt
pressure in their day-to-day practice by threat of
malpractice litigation, (3) they ordered tests or con-
sultations to avoid any appearance of malpractice,
(4) they asked for a consultation to reduce the risk
of being sued, and (5) they rely less on clinical
judgment than technology to make a diagnosis be-
cause of the threat of a malpractice lawsuit. Patient
interaction measured the extent to which the re-
spondents agreed that they have adequate time to
spend with their patients during their office visit.
Compensation
Compensation consisted of income level of the
physicians and benefits provided by drug and med-
ically related companies. Income was measured on
a 6-point categorical variable presented in Table 1.
Benefits provided by drug and medically related
companies consisted of 7 items that measured food
and/or beverages provided at work, free drug sam-
ples, honoraria for speaking, honoraria for partici-
pating in surveys, payment for consultation services,
cost of travel to meetings, and other compensation
from drug companies.
Physician Demographics
Demographic variables selected were sex, race, and
experience. Scales of these variables are also pre-
sented in Table 1.
Analysis
Each of the PCP categories (internal medicine phy-
sicians, family/general medicine physicians, and pe-
diatricians) was analyzed separately. Means and
SDs were calculated for each variable. Cronbach's
 was used to calculate the internal consistency or
reliability of variables with multiple items (infor-
mation technology use, inadequate quality care,
threat of malpractice, and benefits from drug com-
panies). Ordinary least square regression analysis was
done to examine the impact of various independent
variables on our dependent variable. Statistical anal-
ysis was done using SPSS Statistics version 17.0
(SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL).
Results
Table 2 presents descriptive statistics of the data
used in this study. An average internal medicine
and family/general medicine physician was a white
man who was "somewhat satisfied" with his career
in medicine. An average pediatrician was a white
woman who was "very satisfied" with her career in
medicine. An average physician in all 3 specialties
began his/her medical practice between 1991 and
1995. This physician had some ownership of her/
his private practice and made between $100,000
and $150,000 a year. For internal medicine, family/

of physicians in all 3 specialties was positively and
significantly impacted by patient interaction and
income, satisfaction was significantly and nega-

tively impacted by the threat of malpractice law-
suits. In fact, among all factors examined in this
study, patient interaction had the greatest impact
on career satisfaction of all specialties.
Discussion
This is not the first nationwide study to examine
the career satisfaction of PCPs. However, most of
the nationwide studies in the past used the Com-
munity Tracking Survey, a predecessor to the 2008
Health Tracking Physician Survey used in our
study. The Community Tracking Survey, a longi-
tudinal survey, was first conducted in 1996 and has
various limitations, which have been well docu-
mented.28,29 Besides being more current, the
2008 Health Tracking Physician Survey ad-
dresses many policy issues related to physician
care that are important today and were not cov-
ered in the Community Tracking Survey. The
2008 Health Tracking Physician Survey was cre-
ated to set up a new baseline for research about
physicians and included questions about many new
issues such as malpractice and physician ownership.
Our data indicates that 19% of PCPs have been
practicing since at least 1980. These physicians
who have been practicing for 30 years or more may
be contemplating retirement at a time when there
is a dire need in the United States for more PCPs.
This further emphasizes the need to create oppor-
tunities and systems to encourage medical students,
especially women and minorities, to specialize in
primary care. Mentorship programs and formal so-
cial support groups may help with recruiting more
women and minorities. Previous research about
career satisfaction of female physicians has indi-
cated that some female physicians report that they
have fewer opportunities for advancement and are
paid less than their male counterparts. Female
medical students are less likely to pursue those
specialties where these practices are prevalent.33,34
The attrition and "burn out" rate of PCPs also
needs to be addressed via better remuneration and
reimbursement methods so that their overall level
of career satisfaction can be significantly increased.
Most experts believe that a real transformation of
US health care will only occur when quality, access,
coordination, and accountability are enhanced, all
of which require excellent and motivated PCPs.
Our analysis found that those internal medicine
physicians and pediatricians who had some degree
of ownership in their practice were less satisfied with
their careers. This suggests that those PCPs who
worked as independent contractors or as employees
were more satisfied with their careers. Use of infor-
mation technology in the areas of clinical practice,
patient information, and prescription drugs and
working in a private practice had no impact on career
satisfaction. In addition, various benefits provided by
drug companies and working in private practice had
no significant positive or negative impact on the ca-
reer satisfaction of PCPs.
Practice quality factors were the most important
predictors of career satisfaction for PCPs in the 3
specialties. Inadequate quality of care had a signif-
icant negative impact on the career satisfaction of
pediatricians. Thus, career satisfaction of pediatri-
cians was negatively influenced by their inability to
refer a patient to a quality specialist, arrange non-
hospital admissions, provide high-quality outpa-
tient mental health services, and the absence of
interpreter services for non­English-speaking pa-
tients. In our study, patient interaction had the
biggest impact on career satisfaction of PCPs, fol-
lowed by the threat of malpractice. The income
level of physicians significantly impacted career sat-
isfaction of all types of PCPs. None of the demo-
graphic variables had a significant impact on career
satisfaction. It is possible that some of these non-
significant variables had an indirect impact on ca-
reer satisfaction. Future research needs to examine
the indirect impact of these factors using path anal-
ysis.
Because physician pay was associated with lower
satisfaction, this study suggests that increasing pay
could help attract more physicians to primary care
fields. For example, changes in reimbursement
have been recommended by many experts in health
care.20,21,35 However, more research needs to be
done to clarify the true relationship between in-
come and career satisfaction. For example, future
research could examine if a PCP's career satisfac-
tion is impacted by actual pay, pay relative to that of
other specialties, or both. The number of medical
students opting into a primary care specialty may
be able to be increased through the provision of
tuition waivers or loan forgiveness programs.20,35
Given the negative view of liability by the physi-
cians in this study, states may also increase the PCP
workforce by improving the professional liability
climate. Further, because satisfaction is dependent
on patient interaction, payment mechanisms that
doi: 10.3122/jabfm.2010.06.100075 Career Satisfaction of Primary Care Physicians 767
encourage time for patient interaction over vol-
ume--such as salary rather than fee per individual
service--could also increase the attractiveness of
the fields.
This study has several limitations. First, this
study is based on self-reported secondary data. Sec-
ond, our independent variables accounted for
only16% of the variance in career satisfaction for
internal medicine physicians, only 17% of the vari-
ance in career satisfaction for family/general prac-
tice physicians, and only 21% of the variance in
career satisfaction for pediatricians. Although many
researchers would consider them low, these values
are higher than what has been found in previous
research examining the career satisfaction of
PCPs.28 Because we used a secondary data set, our
analysis is limited to the variables studied by the
primary researchers. Clearly there are other signif-
icant variables that were not included in our study.
Previous health care research has shown that, be-
sides financial rewards, factors like ethical climate,
recognition, respect, empathy, and appreciation
can significantly impact job satisfaction and com-
mitment of employees. Future research needs to
investigate the impact of these factors on career
satisfaction. Research also needs to be done about
the impact on mentorship programs and formal
social support groups on the recruitment of women
and minorities. Third, the Cronbach's  for some
of our variables were low. Cronbach's  is impacted
by the number of items in the scale and the mag-
nitude of the correlation among the items. Fourth,
our regression model only accounts for direct ef-
fects. A path model with indirect effects may give us
a better understanding of the true impact of these
factors on career satisfaction.
Conclusion
To our knowledge, this is the first study that has
examined the factors that impact the career satisfac-
tion of different types of PCPs using the 2008 Health
Tracking Physician Survey. Our study found that
patient interaction, followed by the threat of malprac-
tice and income, had the most significant impact on
the career satisfaction of PCPs. Use of information
technology, the kind of practice, drug company bene-
fits, sex, race, and experience had no direct impact on
PCPs' career satisfaction. Although pediatricians re-
ported the highest level of satisfaction with their ca-
reers, factors indentified in our study can guide future
doctors in their decisions regarding whether or not to
pursue a career in primary care. Given the need for
more PCPs, the result of this study can help health
care managers come up with strategies to not only
ensure that physicians don't quit but also to persuade
physicians to delay early retirement.
