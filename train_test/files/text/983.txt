Health disparity by socioeconomic status has recently become an important public health concern.
Socioeconomic status may affect health status through several pathways including lifestyle choices. The authors
tested the link between socioeconomic status and lifestyle in China (in 1993) and in the United States (in 1994­
1996), countries with high contrasts in development, to understand health discrepancy issues cross-nationally.
Healthfulness of lifestyle was measured using the Lifestyle Index, a summary score that integrates four key
lifestyle factors: diet, physical activity, smoking, and alcohol consumption. Income and education were used as
indicators of socioeconomic status. In China, as socioeconomic status improved, lifestyle was less healthy
(relative odds for the highest socioeconomic status group = 0.19, 95% confidence interval: 0.10, 0.35).
Conversely, in the United States, higher socioeconomic status was related to a healthier lifestyle (relative odds
for the highest socioeconomic status group = 3.81, 95% confidence interval: 2.94, 4.94). The contrasting relation
between socioeconomic status and lifestyle depicts different phases of the lifestyle transition (changes in
lifestyles accompanying economic development). The differences may in part explain why nutrition-related
noncommunicable diseases are more prevalent in the developing world among people with a high socioeconomic
status, whereas often the opposite is found in developed societies. Public health programs may benefit by
advising each socioeconomic status group separately, while considering the country's level of development.

Socioeconomic status has been identified in the health
literature as a powerful determinant of health status (1).
Higher morbidity and mortality among people with a lower
socioeconomic status (most frequently referring to lower
income and lower education) have been reported across a
wide range of health issues (2­4).
Various factors that can affect health outcomes are
summarized in figure 1. The influence of lifestyle, including
diet, physical activity, smoking, and alcohol consumption,
on long-term health outcomes (pathway e) is strongly indi-
cated in the literature (5). Other pathways by which socio-
economic status influences health outcomes include
inequality of access to health care (6) and health care quality,
such as diagnosis, treatment, and control (pathways f and i)
(7). Differential exposure and responses by socioeconomic
status to environmental, biologic, social, and psychological
factors, such as neighborhood, pathogens, support, and
stress, can also result in health inequality (1, 8, 9).
In recent years, the pathways where the effect of income
and education on health status is mediated by lifestyle
choices (pathways a through d in figure 1) have become
more evident, as the disparity in health status presented
across socioeconomic status groups seemed to reflect the
apparent changes in lifestyle observed worldwide. The life-
style transition, a set of changes occurring in lifestyle behav-
iors along with the progress of economic development, is
spreading worldwide. The direction of the shift, however,
seems to differ among socioeconomic status groups across
countries depending on their various levels of development.
The most rapid changes in diet are found in the lower-
income countries as economic development increases (10).
The shift is most often toward an unhealthy diet character-
ized by higher fat levels and greater amounts of added sugar,
especially among the higher socioeconomic status groups in
developing countries (11). As societies have grown more
dependent on labor-saving devices, sedentary lifestyles have
become more common around the world. Less time is spent

in voluntary physical exercise among all groups in devel-
oping countries and less privileged socioeconomic status
groups in developed countries (12). These changes in life-
style are in line with the discrepant patterns of health status
seen around the world. In developed societies, people with a
high socioeconomic status are healthier than those with a
low socioeconomic status (13). However, in the developing
world, nutrition-related noncommunicable health conditions
(such as obesity) are often more prevalent as socioeconomic
status improves (14).
These observations motivated us to test whether there is a
link between socioeconomic status and lifestyle that may
lead to contrasting health profiles worldwide. The authors
hypothesized that there is a systematic difference in health-
fulness of lifestyle by socioeconomic status, with the pattern
depending on the country's level of development, which
may explain the difference in the relation of health with
socioeconomic status from country to country. This study
examined the hypothesis by modeling pathways a through d
(shown in figure 1) separately for China and the United
States, countries with a high contrast in their levels of
economic development.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Data and subjects
National in-depth surveys from China and the United
States were analyzed for this study. The 1993 China Health
and Nutrition Survey included approximately 14,000 indi-
viduals drawn by a multistage, random cluster process in
eight provinces, whose socioeconomic and other health,
nutritional, and demographic factors vary substantially (15).
The data collection for the China Health and Nutrition
Survey followed human subject-approval procedures of the
human subjects protection committees of the University of
North Carolina at Chapel Hill School of Public Health and
the Chinese Academy of Preventive Medicine. The 1994­
1996 US Continuing Survey of Food Intakes by Individuals
surveyed a representative national probability sample of the
US population consisting of more than 16,000 individuals
who were drawn by a complex, multistage, area probability
sample design. The data collection details for each survey
have been previously described (15, 16). Both data sets have
comparable information on socioeconomic status and life-
style behaviors. Our study subjects were adults aged 20 or
more years who provided lifestyle data and who were not
pregnant or lactating. To effectively contrast the socioeco-
nomic status profiles of those with healthier and unhealthy
lifestyles, we included in our statistical modeling analysis
groups in the upper and lower tiers of healthfulness of life-
style, which resulted in a sample size of 5,280 persons from
the China Health and Nutrition Survey and 6,301 persons
from the Continuing Survey of Food Intakes by Individuals.
Measures
Healthfulness of lifestyle was measured using the Life-
style Index for the individuals of the study samples. The
Lifestyle Index is a summary measure created for cross-
national comparisons based on global health concerns, inte-
grating four key lifestyle factors: diet, physical activity,
smoking, and alcohol use (17). Each factor of the Lifestyle
Index was given differential weights (0.2, 0.3, 0.3, and 0.2,
respectively), reflecting its relative importance in health
(18­21). Diet quality was assessed with respect to variety,
adequacy, moderation, and overall balance by measuring
intakes of various foods and nutrients. Physical activity was
evaluated by level of physical activity. Both status and
amount of smoking determined the smoking score. Alcohol
consumption was assessed by the type of alcohol drinking
(regular or binge), as well as by the amount of alcohol

consumed. Each component index (and thus the Lifestyle
Index) has a gradient of scores based on the healthfulness of
lifestyle: the higher the score, the healthier the lifestyle. The
Lifestyle Index scores range from zero to 100 points, with
100 points implying the successful achievement of healthy
lifestyle goals.
We categorized the continuous measures of healthfulness
of lifestyle (the Lifestyle Index scores) into three groups:
low (below 60 points), middle (from 60 to 80 points), and
high (more than 80 points). These Lifestyle Index score
groups, created by the absolute cutpoints, approximated the
tertile groups of the Lifestyle Index score in both countries.
This implies that the groups also reflect the relative posi-
tioning of healthfulness of lifestyle in each country. The
outcome in the modeling analysis was a healthy (high Life-
style Index scores) or unhealthy (low Lifestyle Index scores)
lifestyle.
Information on income and education was used to repre-
sent socioeconomic status as the main independent variables.
Because our focus was to compare how relative socioeco-
nomic status (rather than exact level of income or education)
relates to healthfulness of lifestyle across the countries, the
socioeconomic status indicators were categorized with
country-specific cutoff points. For China, the total house-
hold income per capita (average monthly income from work,
including subsidies and bonuses, and household income
from other sources, adjusted using a price index) was catego-
rized into tertiles. For the United States, the annual approxi-
mated income from all sources, earned by all of the
household members before taxes, was expressed as a
percentage of the poverty threshold based on income and
head count of the household members. Cutoffs of 185
percent and 350 percent of the poverty threshold were used
to distinguish low-, middle-, and high-income groups for the
United States.
The level of education was measured by the number of
years of education in formal school. The distribution of years
of education in China and the United States varied substan-
tially. For China, those with no formal education (more than
20 percent of the analyzed sample) were put into the low-
education group, those with formal education up to or
including the sixth grade were put into the middle-education
group, and those with more than a sixth grade education
were put into the high-education group. For the United
States, we used cutoffs of less than 12 years (low), 12 years
(middle), and greater than 12 years (high) of education. For
those with no education data available in the United States
(n = 102, 1.6 percent of the analyzed sample), we imputed
the educational level with the use of a regression equation
relating years of education to age, gender, area of residence,
region, income, occupation, and race.
As control variables, sociodemographic factors that may
simultaneously be related to socioeconomic status and
healthfulness of lifestyle were included in the analysis. For
example, in China, gender is highly associated with both the
level of education and smoking and alcohol consumption
behaviors. Therefore, gender may confound the relation
between education and lifestyle. The control variables
included age, gender, area of residence, and region in both
countries and, additionally, race in the United States. We
categorized age in years into three groups, with cutoff points
at 35 years and 55 years of age. For China, we used two cate-
gories for area of residence: urban and rural. For the United
States, three urbanization categories were available based on
Metropolitan Statistical Area status: central city, outside
central city, and non-Metropolitan Statistical Area. For the
region variable in China, the eight provinces surveyed were
categorized into two geographic groups, southern and
northern. For the United States, four regional distinctions
(Northeast, Midwest, South, and West) were used. Addition-
ally, for the United States, five racial groups (White, African
American, Asian and Pacific Islander, American Indian and
Alaskan Native, and other) and an imputed-income indicator
(described in detail below) were included.
Statistical analysis
We summarized, separately for China and the United
States, the distribution of the variables in each sample. The
effect of income and education on healthfulness of lifestyle
was examined using logistic regression. The effect of socio-
economic status on lifestyle was initially tested with more
finely divided Lifestyle Index score groups. Moreover, the
socioeconomic status of individuals in the highest tertile or
quartile of the Lifestyle Index score was contrasted against
the socioeconomic status of those in the lowest tertile or
quartile of the Lifestyle Index score. However, all of the
models with finer outcome categories or with different
cutoffs of Lifestyle Index scores showed very similar results.
Therefore, this study presents the results by logistic regres-
sion with the dichotomous outcome of low versus high Life-
style Index scores based on absolute cutoffs of less than 60
points versus greater than 80 points, the most interpretable
categories.
This study modeled, separately for China and the United
States, pathways a through d, shown in figure 1. In other
words, we did not combine the two samples into one large
data set but examined each country separately with compa-
rable specifications. The models were built as comparably as
possible between China and the United States, but some
deviation was allowed to make each model most appropriate
for its country. The full models included income and educa-
tion (used as the main effect variables) and interaction terms
between income and education, as well as sociodemographic
variables (used as control variables). None of the variables in
the models was collinear. By including both income and
education in the same model, we could assess the indepen-
dent effect of each. Interaction between income and educa-
tion was included to examine any modification of income
effect by education or vice versa, as well as the cumulative
effect of income and education in relation to healthfulness of
lifestyle. To evaluate the interaction, we compared the full
model with a reduced model without income-education
interaction terms. First, the difference in odds ratio between
the strata of the main effect variables was examined from the
full model. A difference greater than 50 percent between the
strata was considered significant (22). Next, we performed a
likelihood ratio test at an alpha level of 20 percent,
comparing the reduced model with the full model (23).
Confounding by the control variables was examined by
Socioeconomic Profiles and Healthier Lifestyles 187

excluding the control variables from the full model, one at a
time. A change in estimate greater than 10 percent was
considered significant (22).
For variables that were initially continuous measures but
categorized for analysis (i.e., income, education, and age),
we assigned indicator variables for the group distinction. We
chose the lowest levels (low income, low education, and 20­
35 years of age) as the referent group in all of the analyses.
Indicator variables were also used for the other sociodemo-
graphic variables. For both countries, we chose females and
rural area as the referent group. Additional referent groups
included the northern province for China and the Northeast
region and the White race for the United States. In the
Continuing Survey of Food Intakes by Individuals, the
income level of households that had not provided the exact
information on income had been imputed by the US Depart-
ment of Agriculture based on either a broader income cate-
gory, monthly income, regression equation, or segment-level
mean income (16). In our analysis sample, income values of
13, 2.6, 8.7, and 0.43 percent of the sample were found to
have been imputed by the four imputation methods, respec-
tively. Because a substantial proportion of the sample (24.7
percent) had imputed income values, we included addition-
ally for the United States a dummy variable that distin-
guished households with an imputed income to adjust for
any estimation error.
In both the China and US surveys, data were collected
from multiple members of the same households whose life-
styles may be correlated. We incorporated a Huber correc-
tion to adjust for the correlation among the same household
members, using a cluster option that corrects variances.
Design effects were also taken into account for the China
Health and Nutrition Survey data, combining the province
and city/county distinctions as a cluster variable. For the
United States, adjustment by the sampling weights made the
results representative of the total US population. All anal-
yses were performed using Stata statistical software, version
7 (24).
RESULTS
The distribution of the outcome, main effect, and control
variables among the analysis sample in each country is
summarized in table 1. All the variables were fairly evenly
distributed except area of residence in China and race in the
United States. The distributions were comparable between
China and the United States.
The key findings from the logistic regression analysis are
shown in table 2. The odds ratio and its 95 percent confi-
dence interval are presented for the referent groups including
low income, low education, younger age, female gender, and
rural area for both China and the United States; the northern
region for China and the Northeast for the United States;
and, additionally, White race and reported income for the
United States. For both China and the United States, the
interaction between and the additional cumulative effect of
income and education were not significant. Removal of
gender and age from the model each changed the estimates
of the main exposure variables greater than 10 percent for
China (most notably those of education), illustrating the
confounding effect of gender and age. None of the control
variables in the United States changed the odds ratio esti-
mates significantly.
In China, as the income level increased, the likelihood of
having a healthier lifestyle decreased significantly in a linear
trend. Compared with the lowest tertile income group, the
highest tertile income group was 2.5 times less likely to have
a healthier lifestyle. A similar trend was seen for education.
As the level of education increased, the likelihood of having
a healthier lifestyle decreased. Compared with people with
no formal education, those with more than 6 years of educa-
tion (high education group) were 1.8 times less likely to have
a healthier lifestyle.
Conversely, in the United States, as the income level
increased, the likelihood of having a healthier lifestyle
increased. People in the highest income category were about
1.6 times as likely to have a healthier lifestyle than people in
the lowest income group. A similar but even more
pronounced trend was shown by educational level. People
with more than a high school education were 2.8 times more
likely to have a healthier lifestyle than were people with less
than a high school education.
Next, we present the likelihood of having a healthy life-
style with both income and education taken into account, by
summarizing nine combinations of the income and education
groups (low, middle, and high of each) into five socioeco-
nomic status groups: low (both low income and low educa-
tion), lower middle (one low and the other middle), middle
(both middle, or one low and the other high), higher middle
(one middle and the other high), and high (both high). Figure
2 shows the likelihood of healthy lifestyle from the full
model by those five socioeconomic status groups by country,
with the lowest socioeconomic status group (low income and
low education) as the referent. The average of the odds ratios
within the five groups is illustrated on a logarithmic scale. A
contrasting gradient in the likelihood of having a healthier
lifestyle for China and the United States is clearly seen. In
China, as socioeconomic status improved, the odds of having
a healthier lifestyle decreased; conversely, in the United
States, the odds increased with a similar magnitude. The
highest socioeconomic status group in China was more than
five times less likely than the lowest to have a healthier life-
style (odds ratio for the highest socioeconomic status
group = 0.19, 95 percent confidence interval: 0.10, 0.35); in
the United States, the highest socioeconomic status group
was about four times more likely than the lowest to have a
healthier lifestyle (odds ratio for the highest socioeconomic
status group = 3.81, 95 percent confidence interval: 2.94,
4.94).
DISCUSSION
In studying China and the United States, we found a clear
contrast in the relation of socioeconomic status and health-
fulness of lifestyle, which may explain the differential
patterns of change in health profiles observed worldwide. In
developing countries, nutrition-related noncommunicable
diseases are more prevalent among those with a high socio-
economic status; in developed societies, often the opposite is
found. A rapid change in lifestyle is consistently predicted in
188 Kim et al.

the literature to lead to a similar increase in chronic diseases
among specific socioeconomic status groups (25, 26). The
prevalence of lifestyle-related chronic disease may rise even
faster, especially in the lower-income countries, as the life-
style transition accelerates. Although research on Brazil and
the Latin American countries indicates a shift toward more
obesity among the poor (27), this trend has not been consis-
tently found in Asia, Africa, or the Middle East. Studies on
dietary behavior in China indicate that the burden of a
higher-fat diet is expected to shift toward the poor by the
year 2012 (28, 29).
The marked contrasts in the relation between socioeco-
nomic status and healthfulness of lifestyle shown in China
and the United States suggest that the various socioeconomic
status groups experience different patterns of the lifestyle
transition, depending on the country's level of development.
In developing countries like China, only the low socioeco-
nomic status group seems to maintain a healthy lifestyle.

Most available and affordable diets in these countries
include natural food sources that are high in fruits, vegeta-
bles, and grains and low in fat, rather than processed foods,
which are commonly high in fat, salt, and refined sugar (30).
Processed foods are usually more costly in these countries.
In addition, people in lower-income countries are, out of
necessity, engaged in a more physically active lifestyle.
However, as people with a higher socioeconomic status

become exposed to a Western lifestyle, they readily adopt
some of its unhealthy aspects of lifestyle (including a diet
high in fat and sugar and becoming more sedentary), in part
because these choices are viewed as privileges of the
wealthy. Such behaviors may have become even more
apparent in China since the market system was introduced
(28). The drastic change that started in the late 1970s from
the government-controlled food distribution system to a free
market may be continually leading people in the high socio-
economic status groups to change their food-buying habits
to select foods that are not only more expensive but also less
healthy. In China, the overall level of education does not
appear to be high enough to support healthier lifestyle
choices.
In the developed societies, people have become accus-
tomed to unhealthy lifestyle behaviors, which evolved
almost by default as a result of economic development. This
type of lifestyle is characterized by a poor quality diet (low
in fruits, vegetables, and grains; low in micronutrients) and
lack of physical activity. Processed foods, which in these
countries cost less but are poor in quality compared with
natural foods, are readily available. People are less active
because of increased use of energy-saving devices and
motorized transportation. Choosing healthier lifestyle
behaviors involves making deliberate choices that people
with a higher socioeconomic status can most easily afford
(e.g., buying natural rather than processed foods, joining
health clubs, investing in sports equipment). Even engaging
in walking or running warrants a safer environment that is
usually available for those with a higher socioeconomic
status.
Smoking and alcohol drinking behaviors themselves, as
well as the relation between socioeconomic status and the
behaviors, may be less sensitive to the level of development
than is diet or physical activity. Smoking and alcohol use
seem to reflect more of the cultural practices associated with
sociodemographic factors that are also related to socioeco-
nomic status. In China, smoking and alcohol drinking behav-
iors are found almost exclusively among the males. Higher
education is also greatly associated with the male gender in
China. Therefore, the relation between socioeconomic status
and lifestyle is strongly confounded by gender in China. The
relation is also confounded by age, as older people are signif-
icantly less educated and engaged more in unhealthy behav-
iors than the younger generation in China. In the United
States, although the proportions of smokers and heavy
alcohol drinkers are higher among males than females, the
difference between genders is not as great as in China. In
addition, gender is not significantly related to education in
the United States.
It is interesting to note the similarity of the health behav-
iors among those in the highest socioeconomic status group
in China and the lowest socioeconomic status group in the
United States. A vision of a broader development process
might potentially suggest a U-shaped relation between the
level of development and healthfulness of lifestyles.
However, this was not within the analysis of this study.
Of the pathways shown in figure 1, we modeled only path-
ways a through d. Our results, in combination with the
existing literature, suggest that the contrasting relation
between socioeconomic status and healthfulness of lifestyle
may affect the link between lifestyle and health outcomes
accordingly. However, testing the pathway (pathway e in
figure 1) was beyond the scope of this study. There are other
factors involved in the pathway that could not be examined
in this study. The route by which income and education
affect health outcomes through other factors, such as health
care and environmental, biologic, social, and psychological
influences (pathways f and i), may have different patterns for
China and the United States. For example, people with a
higher socioeconomic status in China have better access to
and quality of health care and more positive social interac-
tions than those with a lower socioeconomic status. These
positive elements related to a higher socioeconomic status
would offset the negative effect of their unhealthy lifestyles
on health status. Therefore, the net result of health outcomes
for China may not reflect the differences in healthfulness of
lifestyle by socioeconomic status groups as clearly as for the
United States. People with a higher socioeconomic status in
the United States have both healthier lifestyles and better
health care. Therefore, the effect of socioeconomic status on
health outcome may be rather amplified by the other factors.
Parameters of socioeconomic status may be intertwined in
influencing health behaviors differently, depending on the
level of development. In developed countries where people
are generally well educated, cultural norms agree with
healthy lifestyle choices. In this setting, the higher cost of
healthy lifestyles may be a realistic barrier to healthy life-
style choices. In developing countries, a healthy lifestyle is
usually more affordable than an unhealthy one. Because the
level of education is not high enough to form healthy cultural
norms in these countries, the healthy choices, despite the
favorable cost, frequently lose their place to desires for the
novel and Westernized that are often unhealthy. In this case,
it probably is not the cost that prevents people from engaging
in healthy behaviors but the norms related to education.
Applying a market segmentation technique in the health
field has been documented in the literature (31). Undoubt-
edly, public health promotions would be more effective if
targeted to subpopulation groups for their specific needs.
The findings of this study suggest that global health promo-
tion efforts include developing strategies that take socioeco-
nomic status and level of economic development into
account. In developing countries, the focus should be on
redirecting the lifestyle transition, especially among the
higher socioeconomic status groups, so that they can regain
a healthier lifestyle. Developing countries may benefit
greatly by establishing healthy cultural norms that encourage
healthier lifestyle choices through education. In developed
countries, an effective strategy may include tackling the cost
barrier by modifying the environment to one that promotes
more physical activity and makes healthier foods more avail-
able and affordable, especially to the lower socioeconomic
status groups. As the world increasingly faces lifestyle tran-
sitions toward an unhealthy lifestyle, both in developing and
developed countries, these focused interventions would have
a particularly effective impact on global public health.
