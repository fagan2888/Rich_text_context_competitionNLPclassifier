The Structure of Common Mental Disorders
Robert F. Krueger, PhD
Background: This report presents the results of con-
firmatory factor analyses of patterns of comorbidity
among 10 common mental disorders in the National
Comorbidity Survey, a national probability sample of
US civilians who completed structured diagnostic inter-
views.
Methods: Patterns of comorbidity among DSM-III-R
mental disorders were analyzed via confirmatory factor
analyses for the entire National Comorbidity Survey
sample (N = 8098; age range, 15-54 years), for random
halves of the sample, for men and women separately, and
for a subsample of participants who were seeing a pro-
fessional about their mental health problems. Four mod-
els were compared: a 1-factor model, a 2-factor model
in which some disorders represented internalizing prob-
lems and others represented externalizing problems, a
3-factor variant of the 2-factor model in which internal-
izing was modeled as having 2 subfactors (anxious-
misery and fear), and a 4-factor model in which the
disorders represented separate affective, anxiety, sub-
stance dependence, and antisocial factors.
Results: The 3-factor model provided the best fit in the
entire sample. This result was replicated across random
halves of the sample as well as across women and men.
The substantial empirical intercorrelation between anx-
ious-misery and fear (0.73) suggested that these factors
were most appropriately conceived as subfactors of a
higher-order internalizing factor. In the treatment sample,
the 2-factor model fit best.
Conclusions: The results offer a novel perspective on
comorbidity, suggesting that comorbidity results from
common, underlying core psychopathological pro-
cesses. The results thereby argue for focusing research
on these core processes themselves, rather than on their
varied manifestations as separate disorders.

COMORBIDITY among men-
tal disorders is com-
monly observed in both
clinical and epidemiologi-
cal samples.1-5 The robust-
ness of this observation is rarely ques-
tioned; however, what is at issue is its
meaning. Is comorbidity "noise"--
nuisance covariance that researchers
should eliminate by seeking "pure" cases
for their studies--or a "signal"--an indi-
cation that current diagnostic systems are
lacking in parsimony and are not "carv-
ing nature at its joints?"
Recently, my colleagues and I6 ar-
guedthatthelatterpositiondeservedgreater

in this case, a clear interpretation of the findings is com-
promised8; that is, the findings could be due to the disor-
der of interest, or they could be due to other disorders.
A dimensional approach offers potential means for
resolving these problems. Rather than conceiving of com-
mon mental disorders as discrete, dichotomous entities,
these disorders are conceived as extreme points on con-
tinua that span a range of emotional and behavioral func-
tioning. This dimensional conception brings the robust
empirical data on comorbidity into sharper resolution.
If such continua underlie multiple common mental dis-
orders, these disorders should show strong patterns of
covariance (ie, comorbidity).
In the current research, diagnoses of major depres-
sive episode (MDE), dysthymia (DYS), panic disorder
(PD), agoraphobia (AGPH), social phobia (SOP), simple
phobia (SIP), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), alco-
hol dependence (AD), drug dependence (DD), and an-
tisocial personality disorder (APD) were submitted to con-
firmatory factor analysis (CFA), a formal statistical means
of evaluating dimensional accounts of comorbidity among
mental disorders. Four competing models, positing from
1 to 4 latent factors, were evaluated to determine their
fit in the entire NCS sample, in random halves of the
sample, in the male and female halves of the sample, and
in a subsample of persons in treatment for mental dis-
order.
RESULTS
TETRACHORIC CORRELATIONS
AMONG 10 MENTAL DISORDERS
Tetrachoric correlations among the 10 lifetime mental
disorders were computed, along with their SEs
(Table 1). (These correlations cannot be properly ana-
lyzed without their accompanying asymptotic covari-
ances; this matrix is too large to reproduce here but is
available from the author on request.) A 2-factor pattern
is noticeable in these correlations, with larger values
occurring in the upper left (above AD) and lower right
(to the right of PD) triangles and smaller values occur-
ring in the lower left rectangle (beneath PD and to the
left of AD). Thus, not only are the liabilities to experi-
METHODS
SAMPLE
The NCS participants constitute a national probability
sample of noninstitutionalized US civilians aged 15 to 54
years (N = 8098).7 Data were collected between Septem-
ber 1990 and February 1992, with an overall response rate
of 82.6%. Informed consent was obtained from all partici-
pants and also from the parents of minor participants. The
data were weighted to adjust for nonresponse, to adjust for
variation in probability of selection within and between
households, and to approximate the distribution of major
demographic variables in the US population. Results from
the NCS have been covered extensively in the ARCHIVES and
elsewhere7; these previous publications may be consulted
for further details about the NCS.
ASSESSMENT OF MENTAL DISORDERS
The analyses in this report focused on lifetime diagnoses
in the NCS, which were based on DSM-III-R9 criteria. In
accordance with standard practice in psychiatric epidemi-
ology, the diagnoses examined were made without the im-
position of hierarchical exclusionary rules.7,10 Interviews
were conducted by trained nonclinician interviewers us-
ing a modified version of the World Health Organization
Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI): the
University of Michigan CIDI. Acceptable reliability and va-
lidity data have been obtained for the CIDI11 and the Uni-
versity of Michigan CIDI.12,13
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
The NCS diagnostic data were analyzed via CFA. Briefly,
CFA is a means of explaining the correlations (ie, patterns
of comorbidity) among variables (ie, DSM-III-R mental dis-
orders) by postulating that these correlations arose
because of the influence of a smaller number of underly-
ing, latent dimensions. Specifically, the computer program
PRELIS (version 2.20; Scientific Software International Inc,
Lincolnwood, Ill) was used to create tetrachoric correlation
matrices and asymptotic covariance matrices from the NCS
lifetime diagnostic variables. Tetrachoric correlations are
appropriateindicesofassociationwhenoneadoptsaliability-
threshold model for the disorders of interest--a model
appropriate for common mental disorders.14
My analyses focused on a subset of the DSM-III-R dis-
orders assessed in the NCS. To ensure reliable, stable es-
timates of interrelationships among disorders, the lowest
base rate disorders (ie, nonaffective psychosis and mania)
were excluded. Clinical reappraisal studies in the NCS have
documented the low prevalence (1%) of verifiable cases
of these disorders.7,15 With rare disorders, the confidence
intervals surrounding correlations estimated between these
disorders and other disorders become unacceptably large,
approaching the size of the correlations themselves (analy-
ses verifying this in the NCS can be obtained from the author
on request). Alcohol abuse, drug abuse, panic attack, adult
antisocial behavior, and conduct disorder were excluded
because their more severe variants (AD, DD, PD, and APD)
were included. In addition, posttraumatic stress disorder
was excluded because this disorder requires the occur-
rence of an event external to the person and is therefore a
less meaningful indicator of a latent, endogenous "core psy-
chopathological process" and because this disorder was only
assessed for a subset of the total NCS sample.16 The life-
time disorders remaining after these exclusions were made--
MDE, DYS, PD, AGPH, SOP, SIP, GAD, AD, DD, and APD--
were submitted to CFA.
Four competing models were evaluated. First, a 1-fac-
tor model was evaluated in which all disorders were pre-
sumed to be indicators of a single, unitary propensity to
experiencecommonmentaldisorders.17 Althoughthismodel
may at first seem far-fetched, overall severity of maladjust-
ment has been recognized by the DSM-III, DSM-III-R, and
DSM-IV, but is recorded on the fifth axis as the Global

ence these common mental disorders correlated, they
are systematically correlated. Specifically, the liabilities
to experience affective and anxiety disorders are highly
correlated, the liabilities to experience substance disor-
ders and APD are highly correlated, and the correlations
between these two broad domains are smaller. Also, the
SEs for these correlations are relatively small. It is rea-
sonably certain that these correlations present an accu-
rate representation of the structure of lifetime mental
disorders in the US population as they were accurately
estimated in the NCS sample, which was painstakingly
designed to represent the US population.
THE STRUCTURE OF 10 MENTAL DISORDERS
Fit indices were computed for the 4 potential dimen-
sional models in the entire sample (Table 2). Looking
across the 3 fit indices, a compelling argument can be
made for the superior fit of the 3-factor model. The 3-fac-
tor model achieved the only negative BIC value and was
superior to the other models at reproducing the ob-
served sample correlations (RMR, 0.06).

internalizing factor in the Figure had very large loadings

ingful way to express the 3-factor model.
The SEs for the parameters in this model (Figure)
ranged from 0.02 to 0.04, and hence all the parameters
were significant, with z values ranging from 2.29 to 41.34
(P.05 for all). The factor labels were generated by con-
sidering the core features of the disorders loading on each
factor. These labels highlight a novel finding: GAD has
Assessment of Functioning score (as opposed to being of-
fered as an account of comorbidity among Axis I disor-
ders). Second, a 2-factor model was evaluated in which af-
fective and anxiety disorders were presumed to reflect
internalizing problems, and alcohol/drug dependence and
antisocial personality to reflect externalizing problems. This
model was inspired by reports on childhood behavioral and
emotional problems, which consistently show a concep-
tually similar 2-factor pattern.18,19 Third, a 3-factor variant
of the 2-factor model was evaluated. Initial exploratory fac-
tor analyses of the NCS data suggested that the internaliz-
ing factor has 2 highly correlated subfactors: an anxious-
misery factor formed by MDE, DYS, and GAD and a fear
factor formed by PD, AGPH, SOP, and SIP. The external-
izing factor in this model remains as it was in the 2-factor
model (ie, a factor indicated by AD, DD, and APD). Fi-
nally,a4-factormodelinspiredbytheorganizationalschemes
of recent DSMs and by current trends in research special-
ization was evaluated. In this model, MDE and DYS formed
an affective disorders factor; GAD, PD, AGPH, SOP, and SIP
formed an anxiety disorders factor; AD and DD formed a sub-
stance dependence disorders factor; and APD formed an an-
tisocial behavior disorder factor.
Themodelswereexaminedintheentiresample,inran-
domhalvesofthesample,inbothsexes,andwithinatreatment-

stance use problems; persons who responded affirmatively
tothisquestionwereselectedforinclusionintheclinicalsub-
sample, which was weighted using a weight specifically de-
signed for the analysis of part II participants (n = 251).
The CFA models were tested using the LISREL com-
puter program (version 8.20; Scientific Software Interna-
tional Inc). The model parameters were estimated using
weighed least squares, a procedure that requires the afore-
mentioned asymptotic covariance matrices. The weighted
least squares procedure is appropriate for the analysis of
patterns of comorbidity among common mental disorders
because, unlike other fit functions (such as maximum like-
lihood), it does not assume that the measured variables
(ie, mental disorders) have a joint multivariate normal dis-
tribution in the population. The fit of the models was evalu-
ated using multiple fit indices: the 2 goodness of fit sta-
tistic, the root mean residual (RMR), and the Bayesian
information criterion (BIC). Each of these indices is com-
monly reported in CFA analyses, and each provides a
complementary perspective on the fit of a CFA model.
Briefly, the 2 value for a model indexes the discrepancy
between the model-estimated and sample-derived correla-
tions; smaller 2 values result from better-fitting models.
The RMR indexes how far off the model-estimated corre-
lations are from sample-derived correlations (on average)
and hence should be small for well-fitting models. Finally,
the BIC deserves special mention in the current context, as
it has been very useful in balancing fit and parsimony con-
siderations in large samples (such as the NCS).20 Because
models with more parameters make weaker claims about the
structure of the data, simply including more parameters can
typically reduce the 2 value for a model. Such "overparam-
eterized" models are scientifically unappealing because they
lackparsimony.TheBICprefersmodelsthatsucceedinmaxi-
mizing both fit and parsimony. Larger, more negative val-
ues of BIC are found for such models. Moreover, when com-
paring 2 models, the difference between these models' BIC
scorescorrespondsdirectlywiththeposteriorodds--theodds
ratio formed by taking the probability that the second model
is correct, given the data, over the probability that the first
model is correct, given the data.20 Specifically, a difference
of 6 between 2 BIC scores corresponds with posterior odds
of 20:1 and is regarded as "strong" evidence in favor of the
model with the larger, more negative BIC score. A differ-
ence in BIC of 10 corresponds with posterior odds of 150:1
andisregardedas"verystrong"evidenceinfavorofthemodel

a greater affinity for MDE and DYS than for the other anxi-
ety disorders (this can also be seen by examining the GAD
correlations in Table 1). Another notable finding is that
the factor loadings in the Figure are uniformly large; each
disorder is a reliable indicator of its corresponding factor.
To alleviate concerns that these findings were spe-
cific to lifetime disorders, the models were refitted us-
ing past-year diagnoses in place of lifetime diagnoses (with
the exception of APD, which was assessed only on a life-
time basis). The 3-factor model was also the best-fitting
model when past-year diagnoses were used. Discrepan-
cies between the standardized parameter estimates in the
Figure and those obtained using past-year diagnoses were
minor, ranging from 0.00 to 0.07.
STRUCTURAL REPLICATION ACROSS
SEXES AND RANDOM HALVES
First, the NCS participant sample was split into random
halves. Because this random split was performed on the
actual, unweighted participants, when these partici-
pants' weights were reapplied, the weighted sample sizes
for the halves were roughly but not exactly equal. Nev-
ertheless,theCFAresultswithintheserandomhalves were
similar (Table 2). The 3-factor model emerged as the best-
fitting model, producing the consistently best indices of
fit. Moreover, standardized parameter estimates derived
from the 3-factor model for both random halves were simi-
lar to each other and to those for the total sample. Com-

tor models were all reasonable, the 2-factor model
achieved the largest negative BIC value.
COMMENT
This article examined the factor structure of 10 com-
mon mental disorders in the NCS, the first epidemio-
logical study to administer a structured psychiatric in-
terview to a US national probability sample. For the entire
NCS sample, across sexes, and across random halves, a
3-factor model provided the best fit to the correlations
among the 10 disorders. Because of the high correlation
between the anxious-misery and fear factors in the 3-fac-
tor model (0.73), these factors were meaningfully ex-
pressed as subfactors of a higher-order internalizing fac-
tor. However, in a treatment-seeking subsample, the
2-factor model provided the best fit. Thus, at the high-
est level of the factor hierarchy, a broad internalizing fac-
tor (with anxious-misery and fear subfactors) and a broad
externalizing factor explained the pattern of correla-
tions among liabilities to experience common mental dis-
orders. Within a treatment-seeking sample, however, it
was not possible to recover the subfactors of internaliza-
tion.
The strengths and weaknesses of the study should
be kept in mind when interpreting these results. The NCS
sample is a strength because of its large size and repre-
sentativeness; results from this study can be safely gen-
eralized to the population of US adults and its subcom-
ponents (ie, men, women, and people who seek
treatment). This extends and replicates my prior work
on the 2-factor structure of common mental disorders,6
which was limited to people in late adolescence and did
not examine replicability across sex and treatment-
seeking status.
Nevertheless, two weaknesses are notable. First,
interviews in the NCS were administered by nonclinicians,
and supplementary information, such as informant re-
ports, was not used in making the diagnoses. Examina-
tion of the factor structure of common mental disorders
when clinicians make diagnoses using all available in-
formation is an important goal for future research. Sec-
ond, the NCS study was cross-sectional, and hence, of
necessity, retrospective reports were relied on when life-
time diagnoses were made. Although logistically daunt-
ing in terms of time and expense, fine-grained longitu-
dinal studies of the experience of common mental
disorders and their symptoms in large, representative
samples would be valuable in refining our current no-
sological understanding.
In spite of these concerns, the value of the study rests
on the utility and generativity of the structural model in
the Figure. Evidence that the model helps to organize ob-
servations and suggest directions for future research comes
from three domains: psychiatric epidemiology, psycho-
pharmacology, and psychiatric genetics. First, the model
organizeskeyfindingsfrompsychiatricepidemiology.One
key finding is that common mental disorders exhibit con-
sistently positive intercorrelations (ie, comorbidity) that
vary in magnitude (ie, rate of comorbidity) (Table 1).
Rather than viewing these correlations as nuisance co-
variance, the model in the Figure renders them psycho-
logically sensible. The model organizes common psy-
chopathological variance into internalizing patterns, such
as pervasive anxiety and sadness (anxious-misery) and
phobic avoidance of others and the external world (fear)
as well as externalizing patterns involving antisocial be-
haviors (APD) and lifestyles (AD, DD). Psychologically
speaking, the model suggests that maladjustment can be
expressed primarily inward, as anxious-misery and/or fear,
or primarily outward, as antisocial, disruptive behavior.
Another key finding from psychiatric epidemiol-
ogy is the positive association between comorbidity and
severity of psychopathological dysfunction; that is, the
severity of a disorder predicts not only its intensity and
longevity, but also the likelihood of meeting criteria for
other disorders.1 The model in the Figure also renders
this finding sensible. If multiple mental disorders are in-
dicators of a finite number of latent, continuous factors,
those mental disorders should be correlated (ie, they
should be comorbid).
Second, the model predicts the observed effective-
ness of similar pharmacological interventions for puta-
tively different common mental disorders. For example,
the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), al-
though initially regarded as antidepressants, have been
found to be effective in treating other internalizing con-
ditions, such as PD21 and DYS.22 Indeed, the SSRIs are
now being marketed as treatments for diverse internal-
izing conditions. The SSRIs may be effective in treating
all these conditions because they influence a core inter-
nalizing process--perhaps the personality trait of neu-
roticism/negativeemotionality,whichhasalsobeenshown
to be reduced by SSRI administration.23,24
Third, consider research on the genetic etiology of
common mental disorders. Internalizing disorders share
genetic variance. As predicted by the model in the Fig-
ure, MDE and GAD are closely linked,25,26 PD and the pho-
bias are closely linked,27 and MDE and the phobias, al-
though significantly linked, are linked to a lesser degree.28
In addition, APD and substance use disorders share sig-

nificant genetic variance.29-31 Although multivariate and
molecular genetic research framed in terms of the model
in the Figure is needed to verify this possibility, the ex-
isting research suggests that the model in the Figure may
organize common psychopathological variance by shared
genetic etiology. These three lines of evidence from psy-
chiatric epidemiology, psychopharmacology, and psy-
chiatric genetics support the utility of the model in the
Figure. Considered together, they make a strong case for
refocusing the study of common mental disorders on their
common substrates: broad, higher-order internalizing and
externalizing dimensions.
