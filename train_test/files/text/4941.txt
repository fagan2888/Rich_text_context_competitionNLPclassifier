Introduction
The Taklimakan Desert, the largest desert in China and the
second largest in the world, is called the "Dead Sea". A
nomadic tribe, the Keriyans, live in the center of the
Taklamakan Desert along the seasonal Keriya River. This is
one of the most harsh, hot and arid areas in the world with
an annual rainfall of less than 20 mm and temperature highs
of between 50-60°C. In a sense, the Keriyans offer some
important advantages for scientific research since they are
almost entirely secluded from the world due to undevel-
oped traffic, the monotone nature of genetic background
due to less communication with others and low education,
and the economic blockade due to their nomadic lifestyle.
They survive on meat products and desert sap seepage, and
live in tribe-dominated familial clusters, which yield close
marital relationships. Therefore, the Keriyans are a clan-
nish tribe with their own characteristics, for example in
terms of lifestyle, marriage, diet and drinking-water. In the
present study, we aimed to explore the traditional risk fac-
tors of hypertension in the Taklimakan Desert of Xinjiang
Province as well as the association of hypertension with
their diet and water quality.
Methods
The protocol of the study was approved by the Ethics
Committee of the First Affiliated Hospital of Xinjiang
Medical University and Hetian Region Government.
Informed written consent for participation in the study was
obtained from each participant.
Study population
We conducted medical surveys in the Keriyan Village
twice in September 2005 and October 2008. The first med-
ical surveys were conducted in the Keriyan Village in

Abstract
Introduction: The Keriyans live in the hot, arid areas of Taklimakan Desert and maintain a primitive way of life. They
have a low incidence of hypertension. However, little is known about the adaptive compensation in the organism. In the
present study, we explored the the traditional risk factors of hypertension in the Keriyans.
Materials and methods: We performed an epidemiological survey of Keriyans in a randomly selected natural popula-
tion including 508 individuals aged 16 years or more, using the WHO MONICA scheme and 151 randomly selected age/
gender-matched controls, Uighurs, from the nearest villagers to the Keriyans.
Results: The incidence of hypertension in the Keriyans was significantly lower than that in the controls(p<0.001).
Multivariate logistic regression analysis indicated that age, hyperglycemia and salt consumption as well as sodium intake
in diet were associated with traditional hypertension risk factors. Correlation between water quality and hypertension
showed that calcium was positively associated with the detection rate of hypertension.
Conclusions: Age, hyperglycemia and salt consumption as well as sodium intake in diet were correlated with hyperten-
sion risk factors, which leads to the speculation that the water of the desert draught area which is characterized by low
calcium and high magnesium levels might account for the low incidence of hypertension in Keriyans.

September 2005, i.e., Phase I. The total population
included 985 individuals according to local registration in
Phase I. The total population included 1171 individuals
according to local registration in October 2008, i.e. Phase
II. A total of 790 individuals were randomly sampled. Of
these, 508 (61%) (290 males and 218 females) were
between 16­29 years of age, and 282 (173 males and 109
females) were older 30 years of age. As a reference we
also randomly selected 151 Uighur adults (age30 years,
mean 48.99±13.84) including 77 males and 74 females in
the Yutian county (they are the nearest villagers to the
Keriyans. At present, most people think Keriyans are
related to the Uighurs, but this remains to be confirmed.
Questionnaire survey
The standardized methods of the World Health Organization
(WHO) MONICA project were used to collect information
on anthropometry (body height, weight, waist and hip cir-
cumference abdominal perimeter) and lifestyle habits
(including 24 h diet recall). Other measurements included
blood pressure, an electrocardiograph and an echocardio-
gram. Cigarette smoking was defined as smoking at least
one cigarette per day for one year or more. According the
National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism
(NIAAA) criteria, alcohol drinking was defined as drinking
at least 8 g alcohol per week.
Physical examination and sample collection
Body height, weight, waist circumference, blood pressure
were checked. Body mass index (BMI) was calculated as
mass in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters.
Ethylene Diamine Tetraacetic Acid (EDTA)-blood samples
were obtained after a fasting period. Blood electrolyte, glu-
cose, cholesterol, renal and liver functions and a serum iron
assay were determined by use of an automatic biochemical
analyzer in the central laboratory of the First Affiliated
Hospital of Xinjiang Medical University. Fasting plasma
glucose was detected by a Glucorder Analyzer (Roche).
Collection and analysis of water samples
Local drinking water samples in the Taklimakan Desert and
Yutian country were collected according to the standard crite-
ria for drinking water, as stipulated by the People's Republic
of China in July 2007. The water was assayed for hardness,
chloride, sulfide, fluoride, iron, magnesium and calcium
using the graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrophotom-
etry method according to the criteria of GB/T 5750.12-2006.
Diet evaluation
A 24 h dietary recall as well as a food frequency question-
naire was obtained. The nutrient intake was calculated
using the nutrition calculator version 1.6 (Chinese Disease
Control Center (CDC), China).
Diagnostic criteria
Hypertension was diagnosed as a blood pressure mean of
three independent measurements of systolic/diastolic blood
pressure greater than or equal to 140/90 mm Hg (1 mm
Hg=0.133 kpa) or the use of antihypertensive medication
according to the Guidelines for Prevention and Treatment
of Hypertension in China (2004)1.
Criteria for overweight and obesity
BMI was calculated as weight/height2 (kg/m2). The
Working Group on Obesity2 in Chinese recommended a
cut-off level for defining normal weight as a BMI of
18.5-23.9 kg/m2, overweight as BMI of 24.0-27.9 kg/m2,
and obesity as BMI of 28.0 kg/m2 or more.
Statistical analysis
SPSS 15.0 was used to perform the statistical analysis.
Continuous data was expressed as a mean±standard devi-
ation (SD). Student's t-test with two-tailed values was
used to compare groups when continuous variables were
normally distributed and the homogeneity of variance.
Groups were compared using the Chi-squared test for the
categorical variables. Statistical significance was accepted
at p<0.05.
Results
Baseline characteristics
The mean age of 508 Keriyans aged 16 years or more was
36.14±15.96 years, and the mean systolic and diastolic
blood pressures were 109.81±18.36 mm Hg and
72.58±11.39 mm Hg with a hypertension detection rate of
10.89%. In adults with age30 years (mean 47.09±14.52),
the hypertension detection rate was 14.55% for the Keriyans
and 42.95% for the Yutian population which was signifi-
cantly different (p<0.05 ).
When comparing the two populations with ages30
years, statistically significant differences were observed for
BMI, Serum triglycerides (TG), the total cholesterol (TC),
the high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDLC), the low
-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDLC), fasting glucose,
fat and salt intake (p<0.05), whereas no difference was
noted for waist circumference (Table 1). Univariate analy-
sis indicated that age, gender, alcohol drinking, overweight
and obesity, waist circumference, low LDLC, high plasma
glucose levels, high salt intake and high fat intake served as
the hypertension risk factors of Keriyans population in this
study. Multivariate unconditional logistic regression analy-
sis showed that age, gender, waist circumference, high
plasma glucose levels and a high salt intake were signifi-
cantly associated with hypertension for Keriyans popula-
tion (Table 2),but also were significantly associated with
hypertension for Yutian population except waist (Table 3).

Nutrition intake in diet and
hypertension
The association of the nutrition intake for the Keriyans
(age30 years) with hypertension was, in general, weak. In
the univariate analysis, no significant associations were
noted for energy, fat, carbohydrate, prandial fiber, protein,
cholesterol, vitamin A, aneurin, riboflavin, nicotinic acid,
vitamin C and E, phosphorus, magnesium, potassium, iron,
zinc, selenium, manganese and copper. Calcium, sodium,
salt intake were risk factors with hypertension. In the multi-
variate unconditional regression analysis salt intake, ribofla-
vin, calcium and sodium were positive associated with
hypertension, whereas nicotinic acid showed negative asso-
ciations. Stepwise logistic stepwise regression analysis
incorporating the nutriment of significance showed that salt
intake (odds ratio (OR)=1.724) and sodium intake
(OR=1.002) as the risk factors showed significant and posi-
tive associations with hypertension. And for Yutian popula-
tion, this analysis showed that sodium intake (OR=1.001) as
the risk factors with hypertension (Table 4).
Correlation analysis of the water samples indicated that
the coefficients were significant at 0.05 level with hyper-
tension and showed a positive correlation for water
calcium(r=0.642), Negative associations were found for
solids (r=0.813), sulfate (r=0.748), chloride (r=0.855),
potassium (r=0.954), sodium (r=0.829) and magnesium
(r=0.710). No statistically significant difference was
observed for water hardness, manganese, copper and iron.
Discussion
The Keriyans have adapted to the extreme hot and arid
environment in the Taklimakan Desert. They hardly sweat
or feel thirsty even when they graze their livestock in the
desert at about 50­60°C during the day. It is speculated that
they have a special fitness index, acid-base and electrolyte
balance regulation system or genetic basis for this. The
Keriyans are isolated from the rest of the world because
their environment is inaccessible for the others. Moreover,
they are generally married within their community and
rarely marry anyone else from the outside world. Thus, the
characteristics of the Keriyans result from gene-environment
interaction. The Keriyans live in a different way from the
control group. They have two meals a day with low calorie
intake but they consume much energy when they graze
livestock among the sparse Populus euphratica trees and
sand dunes. The Keriyans are seldom fat and the incidence
rate of hypertension, diabetes is very low according to our
survey.
First, soil salt is the main seasoning for Keriyans, who
consume low levels of sodium in diet. It is estimated that
the average salt intake (±SD) among adult Keriyans is
5.02±1.43 g, and the average sodium intake is 98.44±29.72
mmol; thereof intake of less than 100 mmol accounts for
58.5%. In contrast, among Yutian adults the average salt
intake is estimated at a significant high level of 10.85±2.44
g (p<0.001), as well as the average sodium intake at
199.93±51.42 mmol p<0.001) with the intake of less than
100 mmol accounting for 1.0%.
Evidence is mounting to suggest that the dietary intake
of potassium, sodium, calcium and magnesium are closely
associated with blood pressure variation. The aborigines on
the Pacific Islands have been accustomed to a virtually no-
salt diet, and there are almost no hypertension cases
reported.3 In contrast, the average salt intake among resi-
dents in Hokkaido reaches as high as 15-20 g per day, even
26-55 g per day, which results in a high incidence of hyper-
tension (84%).4 Experimental animal studies also support
the notion that high sodium intake can accelerate the devel-
opment of hypertension and vascular damage.5,6 Secondly,
the drinking water of the Keriyans is from the sap seepage,
which contains high levels of magnesium (119.23 mg/l)
when compared with the standard threshold (20-30 mg/l),
while the calcium content is relatively lower than the stand-
ard baseline (40-80 mg/l).
Our correlation analysis indicated that the calcium con-
tent of the water was associated with the hypertension
detection rate in a positive manner, while for magnesium in
a negative manner, which could lend some support for the
antagonistic action of calcium and magnesium in blood
pressure regulation. However, in general, the drinking
water in the Taklimakan Desert is characterized by high
magnesium content, in line with the low detection rate of
hypertension in this study. We thus speculate that the low
incidence of hypertension among Keriyans might be attrib-
uted to their drinking water. Since the establishment of the
Tongguzbasti village in 1990 in Hetian City, modern ways
are gradually infiltrating this previously closed region and,
accordingly, the incidence of hypertension might increase
and so need periodic follow-ups. It is reported that calcium

content in drinking water is positively related to systolic
blood pressure and has also served as a risk factor for car-
diovascular diseases.7 In 1999, Yang and Chiu documented
that there is a significant protective effect of magnesium
intake from drinking water on the risk of hypertension,8
which leads to the speculation that magnesium plays an
important role in blood pressure regulation. The potential
mechanisms for magnesium to lower blood pressure might
be (a) the dilatation of renal vessels; (b) the acceleration of
prostaglandin release; (c) the stimulation of sodium pump-
ing and adenosine kinase, which is increased in case of
magnesium loss; (d) the regulation by renin of magnesium
can make the blood vessels constricted. On the other hand,
magnesium excess can dilate the vascular smooth muscular
or block ganglions, which can dilate the peripheral vessels,
and hence lower blood pressure.8 Magnesium is involved in
in a variety of physiological processes of the vascular tis-
sues, and is related closely to blood pressure regulation. In
the peripheral vasculature, magnesium and calcium are
involved in regulation via neurohumoral effects, the kid-
neys and adrenal glands.9,10
Conclusion
Correlation analysis indicated that age, hyperglycemia and
salt consumption were correlated with Keriyans' hyperten-
sion risk factors, which leads to the speculation that the
water of the desert area which is characterized by low cal-
cium and high magnesium might account for the low inci-
dence of hypertension in Keriyans. The Keriyans live a
different lifestyle from the controls. They have a low calo-
rie intake but they expend much energy. They consume
significantly lower levels of sodium than other groups. We
speculate that low salt intake is the most important factor
of the low incidence of hypertension and low calcium and
high magnesium levels in water might be another reasons
for the low incidence of hypertension in Keriyans.
To our knowledge, this is the first epidemiologic
study of hypertension risk factors in the Keriyans in
Taklimakan Desert. Our results may be helpful to study
mechanisms of how people adapt to the extreme hot and
arid environment.
