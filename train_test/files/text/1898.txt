We report data from 60 patients with polycystic ovary syn-
drome (PCOS) who had undergone assessment of insulin re-
sistance, pancreatic -cell function, obesity, and androgen
levels to elucidate the complex relationships among these
traits. Homeostasis model assessment was used to quantify
insulin resistance and -cell function. A reference population
was derived from the National Health and Nutrition Exami-
nation Study (NHANES III, 1988­1994). Indices of insulin re-
sistance, insulin secretion, bioavailable testosterone, and
body mass index all exhibited significant pairwise correla-
tions. Multiple regression analysis clarified the phenotypic
relationships, demonstrating that insulin resistance and bio-
available testosterone were independent predictors of -cell
function; -cell function and obesity were independent pre-
dictors of insulin resistance; and -cell function was an inde-
pendent predictor of bioavailable testosterone. Of note, com-
parison with normal women from NHANES revealed a
significantly stronger relationship between -cell function
and insulin resistance in PCOS, raising the possibility of an
intrinsic defect in -cell function whereby increasing insulin
resistance leads to a greater insulin response in PCOS than
normal. The altered relationship of -cell function and insulin
resistance coupled with the fact that -cell function, not in-
sulin resistance, was a predictor of hyperandrogenemia sug-
gests that -cell dysfunction may be a key pathogenic deter-
minant in PCOS. (J Clin Endocrinol Metab 90: 310­315, 2005)
POLYCYSTIC OVARY SYNDROME (PCOS) is found in
4­7% of women of reproductive age, making it the
most common endocrine disorder in women (1, 2). For many
years, obesity has been an important feature of the syndrome.
More recently, investigators recognized insulin resistance,
which characterizes 50­90% of PCOS women (3­5), as a
central component of PCOS, possibly playing an underlying
pathogenic role (6). PCOS, in turn, may confer a risk of
insulin resistance in addition to that caused by obesity (7, 8).
However, it is not clear whether insulin resistance itself or the
resultant compensatory hyperinsulinemia leads to the hor-
monal abnormalities in PCOS. Of the handful of studies that
address insulin secretion in PCOS, some describe increased
insulin secretion (9­16), although others suggest decreased
insulin secretion (17­19).
For these reasons we sought to better understand the role
of pancreatic insulin secretion in PCOS, in particular to place
it in the context of insulin resistance, hyperandrogenemia,
and obesity. To achieve this goal, we analyzed a cohort of
PCOS patients who had undergone detailed characterization
of these phenotypes and compared it with a matched normal
population. Simple correlation and multiple regression anal-
yses were used to describe the relationships among these
traits. We found an altered relationship between -cell func-
tion and insulin resistance in PCOS compared with normal
women.
Subjects and Methods
We conducted an Institutional Review Board-approved retrospective
chart review of patients presenting to S.G.K.'s university-based (David
Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA) reproductive endocrinology clinic
with chief complaints of hirsutism, alopecia, acne, or weight gain. Cri-
teria defining PCOS were those of the 1990 National Institute of Child
Health and Human Development Consensus Conference (20), namely
that there was evidence of hyperandrogenism and oligo-ovulation with
exclusion of other disorders known to result in a hyperandrogenic
syndrome, such as Cushing's disease or congenital adrenal hyperplasia.
Hyperandrogenism was either clinical in the form of hirsutism, acne, or
alopecia, or biochemical in the form of an elevated serum androgen level.
Clinical assessment was made by the same physician in all cases. Oligo-
ovulation was considered to be present if the patient gave a history of
a reduced frequency of menses (missed periods or secondary amenor-
rhea) or if anovulation was demonstrated by luteal phase progesterone
measurement.
Exclusion criteria included a hyperandrogenic disorder other than
PCOS, such as Cushing's syndrome, 21-hydroxylase deficiency, or hy-
perandrogenic insulin resistance acanthosis nigricans syndrome. 21-
Hydroxylase deficiency presenting as adult-onset (nonclassical) adrenal
hyperplasia was diagnosed using standard criteria (21, 22). Also ex-
cluded were patients who at presentation were receiving medications
that could alter the endocrine and metabolic parameters under inves-
tigation, because we wanted to characterize PCOS as it affects women
before treatment. Such medications included oral contraceptives, met-
formin, glucocorticoids, and dexamethasone. Patients were also ex-
cluded if they had impaired fasting glucose, diabetes mellitus, anorexia
nervosa, hypopituitarism, prolactinoma, or active thyroid disease, with
the latter assessed by prolactin and TSH measurements. Hypopituitar-
ism was excluded biochemically when a suggestive history or physical
exam findings were present. In light of the above entry and exclusion

criteria, 60 cases of PCOS (of 143 charts reviewed) were deemed ap-
propriate for inclusion in this study.
Anthropometric and laboratory data were always measured during
initial evaluation, before institution of therapy. A clinic nurse obtained
the weight, height, and blood pressure of each subject. Age was deter-
mined at time of presentation. Body mass index (BMI) was calculated as
kg/m2. All 60 had a morning fasting glucose, insulin, and total and
bioavailable [non-sex-hormone-binding globulin (non-SHBG)-bound]
testosterone, as previously described (23). The laboratory performing
the blood tests (Quest Diagnostics, San Juan Capistrano, CA, for hor-
monal measurements) provided normal values; all other tests were done
at the University of California, Los Angeles, Clinical Laboratory.
The homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) was used to calculate
indices of insulin resistance and insulin secretion for each patient (24,
25). The computer-based HOMA calculator (available at www.dtu.ox.
ac.uk/homa) uses fasting glucose and insulin to generate the index of
insulin resistance, HOMA-IR, and the index of -cell function, HOMA-
%B. An ideal, normal-weight person less than 35 yr of age has a
HOMA-IR of 1 and HOMA-%B of 100% (26).
Data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Study
(NHANES III) (27) were used to obtain a population of normal women
for comparison with women with PCOS. Subjects from NHANES III
who had glucose and insulin levels obtained after at least 8 h fasting were
selected to match the age, BMI, and racial/ethnic distribution of the
PCOS group. Thus, the groups were comparable in age (NHANES mean
age, 27.8 yr with a range of 15­39 yr; PCOS mean age, 26.2 yr with a range
of 13­46 yr) and BMI (NHANES mean BMI, 30.0 kg/m2 with a range of
24­69 kg/m2; PCOS mean BMI, 30.6 kg/m2 with a range of 19­64
kg/m2). Both populations had equal proportions of Caucasian subjects
(64%), Mexican-Americans (11%), African-Americans (9%), and other
ethnic groups (16%). We excluded participants who were using insulin
or who had a fasting glucose greater than 110 mg/dl (6.1 mmol/liter)
or a glycosylated hemoglobin greater than 6% to remove individuals
with glucose intolerance or diabetes, yielding 486 subjects for analysis.
The methods used for glucose, insulin, and lipid levels are detailed in
the NHANES report (27).
Statistical analysis
Parameters that had a skewed distribution (weight, BMI, insulin,
HOMA-IR, HOMA-%B, and total and bioavailable testosterone values)
were log transformed for all analyses to reduce skewness. Henceforth
reference to these variables will always mean their log-transformed
values. Student's t test was used to compare means between PCOS and
NHANES. A P value  0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Simple correlation analyses were carried out comparing all possible
pairwise combinations of the variables HOMA-%B, HOMA-IR, age,
BMI, bioavailable testosterone, and total testosterone for both the PCOS
and NHANES populations (testosterone was not measured in
NHANES). A large sample test (28) was used to compare corresponding
correlation coefficients between the two populations. In the PCOS
group, multiple regression analysis was conducted 1) with HOMA-IR,
age, BMI, and bioavailable testosterone as independent variables and
HOMA-%B as the dependent variable; 2) with HOMA-%B, age, BMI,
and bioavailable testosterone as independent variables and HOMA-IR
as the dependent variable; and 3) with HOMA-IR, HOMA-%B, age, and
BMI as independent variables and bioavailable testosterone as the de-
pendent variable. Analyses were conducted using Statview 5.01 and SAS
software (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).
Results
Phenotypic correlations in PCOS
The phenotypic correlations among insulin resistance,
-cell function, testosterone levels, age, and BMI, assessed by
pairwise correlations, are displayed in Table 1. HOMA-IR
values indicated a wide range of insulin resistance from
0.35­6.9. HOMA-%B values ranged from 58­382%, indicat-
ing a broad range of insulin secretion. The highly significant
correlation (r  0.91; P  0.0001) between HOMA-IR and
HOMA-%B indicated increasing (compensatory) insulin se-
cretion with increasing insulin resistance.
Obesity is known to correlate with insulin resistance. As
predicted, in PCOS, there was a significant correlation be-
tween BMI and HOMA-IR (r  0.57; P  0.0001). BMI was
also correlated with HOMA-%B (r  0.50; P  0.0002), but
age was not significantly correlated with HOMA-IR (r 
­0.13; P  0.32) or HOMA-%B (r  ­0.19; P  0.16).
Total and bioavailable testosterone values were available
for the PCOS group only. Total testosterone was not signif-
icantly correlated with insulin resistance, insulin secretion,
age, or BMI. However, bioavailable testosterone was corre-
lated with fasting insulin (r  0.44; P  0.0005), with
HOMA-IR (r  0.42; P  0.0016), and with HOMA-%B (r 
0.49; P  0.0002). Bioavailable testosterone was also corre-
lated with BMI (r  0.33; P  0.016).
Given the complex of interrelationships among insulin-
related traits, hyperandrogenemia, and body mass, we next
used multiple regression analyses to elucidate the most im-
portant independent predictors of insulin resistance, -cell
function, and bioavailable testosterone.
Independent factors influencing -cell function, insulin
resistance, and bioavailable testosterone in PCOS
Table 2 displays the results of analyses that employed
HOMA-%B, HOMA-IR, and bioavailable testosterone as de-
pendent variables in separate multiple regressions. In
women with PCOS, regression of age, BMI, HOMA-IR, and
bioavailable testosterone on HOMA-%B showed that age
and BMI were not significant predictors of HOMA-%B (P 
0.33 and 0.71). The strongest predictor of HOMA-%B as
judged by standardized regression coefficients (SRC) was
HOMA-IR (SRC  0.86; P  0.0001), followed by bioavailable
testosterone (SRC  0.15; P  0.023).
Multiple regression of HOMA-IR on age, BMI, HOMA-
%B, and bioavailable testosterone revealed that the most
important predictors of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) were
BMI (SRC  0.15; P  0.033) and HOMA-%B (SRC  0.88;

P  0.0001). In contrast to -cell function, bioavailable tes-
tosterone was not a significant predictor of HOMA-IR in this
analysis.
HOMA-IR and HOMA-%B, as well as age and BMI, were
examined as independent predictors of bioavailable testos-
terone. In this analysis, the only independent predictor of
bioavailable testosterone was HOMA-%B (SRC  0.74; P 
0.023).
Insulin resistance and -cell function: PCOS vs.
normal women
Anthropometric and metabolic characteristics of the PCOS
patients and the age-, BMI-, and ethnicity-matched normal
women from NHANES are presented in Table 3. Average
levels of fasting glucose and insulin-related traits did not
differ significantly between the two groups.
In the NHANES group, all of the correlation coefficients
were highly significant because of the large sample size (Ta-
ble 4). The simple correlation between BMI and HOMA-IR
(r  0.47; P  0.0001) was similar to that observed in PCOS
(P  0.34 for comparison of coefficients). In NHANES, the
simple correlation between HOMA-IR and HOMA-%B (r 
0.77; P  0.0001) gave a smaller coefficient than that observed
in PCOS. A small but statistically significant correlation ex-
isted between age and HOMA-%B (r  ­0.23; P  0.0001),
and age and HOMA-IR were marginally correlated (r  ­0.1;
P  0.049).
The observed differences in correlation coefficients between
women with PCOS and normal women led us to ask whether
the relationship between HOMA-%B and HOMA-IR was
different between the two groups. A large sample test
showed there was a significant difference in the correlation
of HOMA-%B to HOMA-IR between PCOS and NHANES
(P  0.0076) with the correlation in PCOS being considerably
stronger (0.91 vs. 0.77). To illustrate the differential relation-
ship of HOMA-%B and HOMA-IR, Fig. 1 presents overlaid
regression plots for HOMA-%B vs. HOMA-IR for PCOS and
NHANES. These plots depict the effect of incremental in-
creases in HOMA-IR on HOMA-%B. The greater effect of
HOMA-IR on HOMA-%B in PCOS is reflected in the steeper
slope of the regression line for PCOS (Fig. 1), indicating that
a given increase in HOMA-IR results in a larger increment in
HOMA-%B in women with PCOS than in those without.
Discussion
This study aimed to characterize the most important in-
dependent determinants of -cell function, insulin resis-
tance, and hyperandrogenemia in PCOS. Although all pair-
wise correlations of HOMA-%B, HOMA-IR, and bioavailable
testosterone were statistically significant, multiple regres-
sion analyses allowed identification of the most significant
predictors of each trait. Our study was unique in that we
compared inter-trait correlations between PCOS and normal
women, not simply mean values. This approach demon-
strated a disproportionate elevation of -cell function com-
pared with insulin resistance in PCOS compared with nor-
mal women, a dramatic finding given that the two groups
had similar mean values of these insulin-related traits.
The use of women from NHANES provided a very large
normal control group; even if 5% of this population had
PCOS it would not have altered the results. In fact, the pres-
ence of PCOS in the NHANES population would tend to
hinder detection of differences in a comparison of our PCOS
patients with NHANES. Direct comparison of mean trait
values, as in Table 3, must be interpreted with some caution
because the glucose and insulin determinations were made
in different laboratories.
The unsuspected importance of -cell function
In PCOS and normal women, the most significant predic-
tor of -cell function was insulin resistance. This is consistent
with the concept of compensatory insulin hypersecretion in
response to insulin resistance. Compensatory hyperinsulin-
emia serves to maintain normal plasma glucose levels in the
face of insulin resistance. Because the patients were selected
to have normal fasting glucose levels (range, 69­105 mg/dl
or 3.8­5.8 mmol/liter), they had adequate -cell function.
The most insulin-resistant patients with PCOS in this study
had -cells secreting insulin at very high levels. These pa-
tients may be at increased risk of -cell exhaustion and de-
velopment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (29).

In contrast to insulin resistance in PCOS, there have been
comparatively few studies examining -cell function/insulin
secretion in PCOS. Several studies demonstrated increased
insulin secretion in PCOS compared with normal (9­16),
although other studies demonstrated decreased insulin se-
cretion in PCOS (17­19). Different results have been observed
depending on whether insulin secretion was assessed in the
basal vs. postabsorptive state (30). Another possible con-
founding factor is that many studies quantified insulin se-
cretion without accounting for the prevailing level of insulin
resistance; this is essential to accurate interpretation of in-
dices of -cell function because insulin secretion and insulin
sensitivity have been shown to have a hyperbolic relation-
ship (31). Insulin secretion may be adjusted for insulin re-
sistance using statistical means or by employing the dispo-
sition index, the product of an index of insulin secretion with
an index of insulin sensitivity. Nevertheless, even among
careful studies making this adjustment, conflicting results
regarding insulin secretion in PCOS are found in the liter-
ature (14, 18, 32). We avoided this problem by examining the
relationship between insulin secretion and insulin resistance,
rather than comparing mean values. Although we did not
find BMI to be an independent predictor of -cell function,
others have observed differences in -cell function between
lean and obese women with PCOS, with increased insulin
secretion in lean PCOS and decreased insulin secretion in
obese PCOS (32). Insulin secretion tends to be decreased in
women with PCOS and impaired glucose tolerance; a study
of obese, insulin-resistant adolescents with PCOS found that
those with impaired glucose tolerance or diabetes had im-
paired -cell response to the same degree of insulin resis-
tance as the normoglycemic patients (17). In a separate study,
normal glucose-tolerant women with PCOS had increased
insulin secretion, whereas those with impaired glucose tol-
erance had decreased insulin secretion (14). Similarly,
women with polycystic ovaries and a history of gestational
diabetes have impaired -cell function (33, 34). Thus, the
heterogeneity observed in -cell function in PCOS may re-
flect its assessment at different stages of the disorder, with
increased -cell function in lean subjects with normal glucose
tolerance and decreased -cell function in obese subjects who
have mild (manifesting during pregnancy as gestational di-
abetes) or overt impairment in glucose tolerance.
A key finding in this study was the altered relationship of
-cell function and insulin resistance in PCOS in comparison
with normal women. The correlation coefficients relating
HOMA-%B to HOMA-IR were higher in PCOS, indicating a
greater degree of compensatory insulin secretion for a given
increment in insulin resistance. The basis of this difference is
unknown. Perhaps in PCOS there is a genetic variant in the
pancreatic -cell that leads to insulin hypersecretion. In fact,
in studies of families of women with PCOS, insulin secretion
levels, quantified directly by the frequently sampled iv glu-
cose tolerance test, showed significant heritability, suggest-
ing a genetic component to -cell function in PCOS (35).
Higher proinsulin levels in women with PCOS compared
with normal have been observed, supporting the hypothesis
of altered -cell function in PCOS (36). Another study ob-
served that weight loss in a group of women with PCOS led
to normalization of insulin resistance but did not alter insulin
hypersecretion, suggesting that the latter is a primary, in-
trinsic factor in PCOS (16). Given that HOMA-%B was a
significant predictor of bioavailable testosterone in PCOS, it
is possible that the tendency to insulin hypersecretion leads
to elevated levels of insulin that then contribute to hyperan-
drogenemia. Indeed, much experimental evidence exists to
suggest that insulin has the ability to stimulate ovarian tes-
tosterone production (37­39). Whether increased insulin se-
cretion stimulates adrenal androgen hypersecretion is more
controversial; however, one study of PCOS women found
that during an insulin infusion, adrenal -5 androgen output
was exaggerated compared with saline infusion, suggesting
that hyperinsulinemia potentiated the adrenocortical re-
sponse to ACTH (40).
The place of insulin resistance
We used HOMA-IR to quantify insulin resistance because
this tool has been shown to be a reliable reflection of insulin
resistance with a good correlation (r  0.6­0.88) with the
euglycemic hyperinsulinemic glucose clamp study (24, 26,
41). A recent report showed HOMA-IR to have a better cor-
relation with clamp results than even indices derived from
oral glucose tolerance tests (42). In women with PCOS and
in normal women, HOMA-%B and BMI were significant
correlates of HOMA-IR. Whether the insulin resistance often
observed in PCOS is because of obesity or an effect of PCOS

itself is controversial. Some studies showed similar insulin
resistance in weight-matched PCOS and control subjects (19,
43), whereas others demonstrated increased insulin resis-
tance in PCOS compared with weight-matched controls (3,
30, 44). What is widely accepted is that women with both
PCOS and obesity have the highest risk for insulin resistance.
In multiple regression analysis in PCOS, BMI was signif-
icantly related to HOMA-IR but not to HOMA-%B. This is in
agreement with a study wherein weight loss normalized
insulin resistance in women with PCOS but did not reduce
their increased insulin secretion (16). In another study of lean
and obese women with PCOS, insulin resistance was most
prominent in the obese subjects, whereas insulin hyperse-
cretion was found in all hyperinsulinemic PCOS patients,
regardless of obesity (10). This again highlights the potential
importance of pancreatic -cell function in the pathophysi-
ology of PCOS. If a tendency to insulin hypersecretion is a
primary characteristic of PCOS, insulin resistance may yet
have importance as a physiological stressor that, by increas-
ing the body's need for insulin, causes the insulin secretory
abnormality to become manifest. This is suggested by the
greater slope of the HOMA-%B vs. HOMA-IR line in PCOS
vs. normal (Fig. 1).
The role of androgens: bioavailable testosterone
Some studies suggest that insulin resistance/hyperinsu-
linemia may cause hyperandrogenemia (37­40, 45), whereas
others suggest the reverse (46, 47). The current study found
a significant correlation between insulin resistance and hy-
perandrogenemia; however, in multiple regression analysis,
the relationship between these traits was insignificant. On
the other hand, a robust relationship was found between
-cell function and bioavailable testosterone. As discussed
above, this raises the possibility that insulin hypersecretion
causes hypersecretion of androgens. Conversely, elevated
androgen levels may influence -cell function, leading to
insulin hypersecretion. Consistent with this possibility, a
study demonstrating increased insulin secretion in PCOS
compared with normal found no difference after adjusting
for free androgen index (14). Another alternative is that a
common cellular defect leads to both insulin hypersecretion
and androgen hypersecretion. Our results demonstrate a
significant correlation between HOMA-%B and bioavailable
testosterone but do not allow conclusions on causation. What
can be inferred is that the correlation of insulin resistance and
hyperandrogenemia often observed in PCOS is likely medi-
ated via compensatory insulin hypersecretion.
Bioavailable (non-SHBG-bound) testosterone exhibited
significant pairwise correlations with BMI and with HOMA-
%B. Although both obesity and hyperinsulinemia may con-
tribute to decreased levels of SHBG, resulting in higher bio-
available testosterone, multiple regression analysis showed
that -cell function had the most direct effect on hyperan-
drogenemia. It has been suggested that hyperinsulinemia
may mediate the decrease in SHBG seen with increasing
adiposity (48). Thus, insulin suppression of hepatic synthesis
of SHBG (49) may contribute to the correlation of -cell
function and bioavailable testosterone, in addition to a pos-
sible effect of insulin on ovarian steroidogenesis (37­39). The
fact that total testosterone exhibited no significant inter-trait
correlations demonstrates the importance of low SHBG in the
hyperandrogenemia of PCOS.
Implications
Insulin resistance is clearly found in many subjects with
PCOS and may contribute to increased risk of the metabolic
syndrome, development of type 2 diabetes, and cardiovas-
cular disease (6). However, this study demonstrates the
under-recognized importance of -cell function in PCOS.
-Cell function, not insulin resistance, was an important
correlate of bioavailable testosterone levels. Women with
PCOS demonstrated an altered relationship between insulin
resistance and insulin secretion, consistent with an intrinsic
-cell defect wherein insulin resistance leads to an excessive
amount of compensatory insulin secretion, with attendant
consequences on androgen production and SHBG levels.
Insulin hypersecretion may also help to explain the intense
hunger experienced by PCOS patients and their ability to
gain large amounts of weight in a short period of time.
Possibly this insulin hypersecretion was evolutionarily ad-
vantageous in times of nutritional deprivation. More re-
search, both at the clinical and cellular levels, is needed to
better understand the importance of insulin secretion in
PCOS. If -cell function is indeed a central pathogenic defect
in PCOS, therapies that directly modulate insulin secretion
may achieve greater success than insulin-sensitizing thera-
pies commonly used today.
