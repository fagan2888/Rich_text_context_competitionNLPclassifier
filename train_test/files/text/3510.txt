Abstract
Reactive oxygen species (ROS) act as signaling molecules that regulate nervous system physiology. ROS have been related to
neural differentiation, neuritogenesis, and programmed cell death. Nevertheless, little is known about the mechanisms
involved in the regulation of ROS during neuronal development. In this study, we evaluated the mechanisms by which
ROS are regulated during neuronal development and the implications of these molecules in this process. Primary cultures
of cerebellar granule neurons (CGN) were used to address these issues. Our results show that during the first 3 days of
CGN development in vitro (days in vitro; DIV), the levels of ROS increased, reaching a peak at 2 and 3 DIV under depolarizing
(25 mM KCl) and nondepolarizing (5 mM KCl) conditions. Subsequently, under depolarizing conditions, the ROS levels
markedly decreased, but in nondepolarizing conditions, the ROS levels increased gradually. This correlated with the
extent of CGN maturation. Also, antioxidants and NADPH-oxidases (NOX) inhibitors reduced the expression of Tau
and MAP2. On the other hand, the levels of glutathione markedly increased at 1 DIV. We inferred that the ROS increase
at this time is critical for cell survival because glutathione depletion leads to axonal degeneration and CGN death only at 2
DIV. During the first 3 DIV, NOX2 was upregulated and expressed in filopodia and growth cones, which correlated with the
hydrogen peroxide (H2
O2
) distribution in the cell. Finally, NOX2 KO CGN showed shorter neurites than wild-type CGN.
Taken together, these results suggest that the regulation of ROS is critical during the early stages of CGN development.

Introduction
The development of the nervous system represents a
highly coordinated event that includes different processes
such as neural differentiation, neuritogenesis, and pro-
grammed cell death. A primary aim of neurobiology is
to unravel the molecular mechanisms that control neur-
onal development that is essential for the correct assem-
bly of neuronal networks (Barnes and Polleux, 2009).
Reactive oxygen species (ROS) have been implicated
in several pathological conditions, but they have also
emerged as endogenous modulators of numerous physio-
logical functions. ROS are formed from the univalent
reduction of molecular oxygen, leading to the production
of superoxide anions (OÀ
2
), considered the primary ROS.
Subsequently, the OÀ
2
is converted enzymatically and
nonenzymatically into hydrogen peroxide (H2
O2
), which
is considered the major ROS that regulates cell
physiology (Kamata and Hirata, 1999; Droge, 2002;
Valko et al., 2007; Pourova et al., 2010).
In the nervous system, ROS have been mainly
associated with the cause and progression of different
neurologic disorders (Barnham et al., 2004; Sorce and
Krause, 2009). Nevertheless, increasing evidence also
support a physiological role of ROS in the developing

and adult nervous systems. Some major functions of
ROS in the central nervous system (CNS) include its
involvement in hippocampal long-term potentiation,
associative memory (Thiels et al., 2000), as well as its
role as neuromodulator of dopamine release in the stri-
atum (Avshalumov et al., 2005, 2008; Sidlo et al., 2008).
During nervous system development, different neurogenic
regions express high levels of ROS. This expression
pattern varies from one brain region to another and is
also related to the developmental process at a given
time--such as proliferation of neural stem cells
(Yoneyama et al., 2010; Dickinson et al., 2011; Le Belle
et al., 2011), neurogenesis (Tsatmali et al., 2005, 2006;
Le Belle et al., 2011), cell migration (Le Belle et al.,
2011), axonal growth (Munnamalai and Suter, 2009;
Munnamalai et al., 2014), axonal guidance (Morinaka
et al., 2011), and programmed cell death (Valencia and
Moran, 2004). The variety of ROS functions in the CNS
is wide ranging from cell proliferation to cell death.
Interestingly, several studies have shown that the mech-
anism that governs the physiological action of ROS may
be similar to those underlying their pathological actions.
Thus, studies pertaining to ROS actions during neuronal
development may contribute to the understanding of the
development and the disease of the nervous system.
NADPH-oxidases (NOX) family is one of the main
ROS forming complexes in neurons. The NOX family
comprises seven homologues (NOX 1-5 and DUOX
1-2) that produce superoxide anion and H2
O2
from
molecular oxygen. NOX enzymes are widely expressed
in most cell types, including neurons and glial cells
(Bedard and Krause, 2007; Sorce and Krause, 2009).
Although the physiological functions of NOX enzymes
in the nervous system are largely unknown, studies have
shown that NOX might be involved in some processes
such as the early phase of the long-term potentiation in
hippocampus (Kishida et al., 2006) and neurogenesis and
neuronal maturation.
The members of the NOX family can be activated by
several regulators of nervous system development, includ-
ing growth factors (neurotrophins and fibroblast growth
factor [FGF]), cytokines, and the activation of N-methyl-
D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR), among others
(Suzukawa et al., 2000; Kim et al., 2002; Miller et al.,
2007; Brennan et al., 2009). On the other hand, previous
studies in vitro have shown that ROS produced by NOX
induce neuronal differentiation of PC12 cells (Suzukawa
et al., 2000; Goldsmit et al., 2001; Kamata et al., 2005),
SH-SY5Y cells (Nitti et al., 2010), and P19 cells
(Kennedy et al., 2010). Furthermore, it has been shown
that NOX2 participates in the neurogenesis in the sub-
ventricular zone (Le Belle et al., 2011), as well as in the
regulation of the actin cytoskeletal dynamics of axonal
growth cones in Aplysia neurons (Munnamalai et al.,
2014). In the developing cerebellum, we recently showed
that a transient increase of ROS produced by NOX seems
to be involved in the cerebellar foliation and motor
function (Coyoy et al., 2013). In view of this, the
developing cerebellar cortex constitutes a suitable model
for studying the mechanisms by which ROS regulate
neuronal development.
The intracellular ROS levels depend not only on
the ROS sources but also on the antioxidant systems in
the cells. In this regard, the glutathione is a major anti-
oxidant system in the nervous system (Dringen, 2000).
Glutathione scavenges a variety of ROS and is an
obligated cosubstrate of glutathione peroxidase, which
is a major mechanism of defense against H2
O2
(Franco
and Cidlowski, 2009; Lubos et al., 2011). In addition,
changes in the reduced glutathione (GSH)/oxidized gluta-
thione (GSSG) ratio are considered important determin-
ants in the redox environment and redox signaling in the
cells (Schafer and Buettner, 2001; Jones, 2006; Franco
and Cidlowski, 2012). Therefore, the actions exerted by
ROS during nervous system development may be influ-
enced by the glutathione antioxidant system.
Not much information is available on the glutathione
levels during cerebellar development, and the experimen-
tal evidence is rather controversial. Rice and Russo-
Menna (1998) reported a sudden increase in glutathione
from postnatal day 12 that remianed high until the adult.
However, other study indicates that the levels of glutathi-
one transiently increase during the first week and then
values return to basal levels, remaining relatively low
during the subsequent stages of cerebellar development
(Nanda et al., 1996).
Although some studies have established a physio-
logical role of ROS during nervous system development,
little is known about the interdependence of ROS
and NOX enzymes during neuronal development.
Furthermore, the mechanisms through which ROS are
regulated in the developing neurons remain largely
unknown. In this study, we aim to determine the physio-
logical role of ROS in neuronal development of cerebellar
granule neurons (CGN) and evaluate the role of
NOX and glutathione in the regulation of ROS during
this process. To address these issues, we employed
cultured CGN that represents a model of study that
recapitulates many of the stages of the development of
the CGN in the cerebellar cortex in vivo. (Powell et al.,
1997; Wechsler-Reya and Scott, 1999; Konishi et al.,
2004; Ito and Takeichi, 2009). In the cerebellum, postmi-
totic CGN precursors generate neurites and migrate to
the internal granule layer, where they develop dendrites
and establish synaptic contacts with mossy fibers (Solecki
et al., 2006). The presynaptic inputs at this stage seem to
play a key role in the maturation and survival of CGN.
The state of depolarization of CGN influences their sur-
vival (Gallo et al., 1987), the activation of the enzymes
involved in the synthesis of cell-specific neurotransmitters
2 ASN Neuro
(Caballero-Benitez et al., 2004), and their dendritic
pruning and maturation (Shalizi et al., 2006; Ramos
et al., 2007).
Here, we determined the changes in the basal levels
of ROS in CGN cultures under depolarizing and nonde-
polarizing conditions throughout CGN development, as
well as their effects on CGN maturation. To elucidate the
role of glutathione in the developing CGN, we examined
the outcome of glutathione depletion on cell viability and
axonal integrity. Subsequently, we measured the expres-
sion of NOX2 at different stages of CGN development
and its localization in these neurons. We also explored
the specific production of H2
O2
in growth cones and filo-
podia. Finally, we evaluated the physiological relevance
of ROS, glutathione, and NOX2 during CGN
neuritogenesis.

Cell Culture
All animals used for experimentation described in the
present study were treated in accordance with the
accepted standards of animal care and with the proced-
ures approved by the local Committee of Research
and Ethics of the Instituto de Fisiologi´a Celular,
Universidad Nacional Auto
´ noma de Me
´ xico. The proto-
col used followed the Guidelines for the Care and Use of
Mammals in Neuroscience as well as guidelines released
by the Mexican Institutes of Health Research and the
National Institutes of Health guide for the care and
use of laboratory animals. All efforts were made to min-
imize animal suffering and to reduce the number of ani-
mals used.
CGN cultures were prepared from postnatal Day 8
Wistar rats and from postnatal Day 7 NOX2À/À and
wild-type mice as previously described (Moran and
Patel, 1989). CGN were plated at a density of
265 Â 103 cells/cm2 in plastic dishes or coverslips coated
with poly-L-lysine (5 mg/mL). Culture medium contained
basal Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-
inactivated fetal calf serum, 2 mM glutamine, 25 mM
KCl, 50 U/mL penicillin, and 50 mg/mL streptomycin.
Cells were maintained under these conditions between
0 and 8 days in vitro (DIV). Culture dishes were incubated
at 37C in a humidified 5% CO2/95% air atmosphere.
To prevent the development of nonneuronal cells, cyto-
sine arabinoside (10 mM) was added 24 hr after seeding.
At the end of the preparation, CGN cultures contained
approximately 95% neurons. The colonies of NOX2
(gp91phox) knockout mice on a C57BL6 background
were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar
Harbor, ME, USA) and bred in our Institute.
Cell Viability
CGN were incubated with calcein (10 mM) and propidium
iodide (5 mM) for 15 min at 37C, and cells were
photographed in a fluorescence microscope using filters
with the following characteristics: excitation filter wave-
length/dichromatic mirror cut-on wavelength/barrier
filter wavelengths of 450-490/500/515 and 510-560/565/
590 nm for calcein and propidium iodide, respectively.
Subsequent analysis involved the determination of immu-
nopositive cells from at least two different images for each
condition. Results are expressed as the percentage of

viable cells (calcein-positive cells) from the total number
of cells (calcein-positive cells þ propidium iodide-positive
cells) evaluated per field.
Metabolic Activity
Mitochondrial activity was determined by the conversion
of tetrazolium MTT (3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5
diphenyl tetrazolium bromide) into formazan crystals.
CGN were seeded during different days in the same
multiwell plate. MTT (0.5 mg/ml) was added to CGN
for 15 min at 37C; the formazan crystals produced
from MTT were extracted with 100% DMSO and quan-
tified spectroscopically at 560 nm.
ROS Detection
CGN were seeded during different days in the same
multiwell plate. Cells were washed twice with Locke
medium (154 mM NaCl, 25 or 5 mM KCl, 3.6 mM
NaHCO3
, 2.3 mM CaCl2
, 5.6 mM glucose, and 10 mM
HEPES) and then incubated with 3.2 mM of dihydroethi-
dium for 35 min. After that, cells were washed twice with
Locke medium, and images were acquired in an epifluor-
escence microscope using a filter with the following
characteristics: excitation filter wavelength/dichromatic
mirror cut-on wavelength/barrier filter wavelength of
510-560/565/590 nm. Two images from the same field
were acquired, one in phase contrast and the other in
fluorescence. Fluorescence measurements of the ethidium
cation (Eþ), which is the product of the oxidation of
dihydroethidium, were performed tracing a region of
interest (ROI) in the soma of 15 cells. These ROI were
considered in the fluorescence image, and the mean gray
intensity values were averaged. The backgrounds of two
different fields were subtracted from the fluorescence
values of each measured cell. At least two different
images of each condition were evaluated. We measure
the fluorescence of 15 cells per photograph, and the aver-
age of four wells per experiment was considered as n ¼ 1.
Results are expressed as absolute values, or data were
normalized with respect to 2 DIV.
Measurement of Glutathione Content
Glutathione was assayed using enzymatic recycling
method for a 96 microwell plate (Tietze, 1969; Rahman
et al., 2006). CGN were grown on 35 mm culture dishes
from 0 to 5 DIV. Cells were washed in PBS and sonicated
in 0.1% Triton X-100 and 0.6% sulfosalicylic acid in
KPE (0.1 M potassium phosphate buffer with 5 mM
EDTA disodium salt, pH 7.5). Next, samples were
mixed with equal volumes of DTNB and glutathione
reductase, after which 30 s b-NADPH was added.
Immediately, kinetic measurements of the absorbance
changes at 412 nm were recorded for 15min.
Absorbance recordings and the injection of solutions
were performed in the microplate reader Synergy HT
(BioTek Instruments, USA). To determine GSSG levels,
the samples were preincubated with 2.5% vinylpyridine
for 60 min and neutralized with triethanolamine prior
to kinetic measurement. Glutathione and GSSG standard
curves were prepared to calculate the actual concentra-
tion in the sample. GSH was calculated from the subtrac-
tion of GSSG from the total glutathione.
Western Blot
CGN were grown on 60 cm culture dishes from 0 to
3 DIV in presence or absence of the antioxidants
Ebselen (10 mM) and Euk-134 (20 mM) and the NOX
inhibitors AEBSF (50 mM) and apocynin (400 mM) in
24 hr treatments at the indicated times. Cells were
washed twice in ice-cold PBS and homogenized in lysis
buffer (25 mM Trizma, 50 mM NaCl, 2% Igepal, 0.2%
SDS, and complete protease inhibitors, pH 7.4). The
protein concentration of cellular homogenates was deter-
mined by using the Lowry method. A total of 60 mg of
soluble protein per lane was loaded on SDS-PAGE and
electrotransferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF)
membranes which were blocked with fat-free milk (5%
in Tris-buffered saline (TBS)/Tween 20 (TTBS) buffer
[100 mM Trizma, 150 mM NaCl, and 0.1% Tween,
pH 7.5]) and incubated overnight at 4C with the follow-
ing specific primary antibodies: 1:3000 mouse
anti-GAPDH, 1:500 mouse anti-Tau, and 1:500 rabbit
anti-MAP2.
Measurement of NAPDH-Oxidase Activity
in Living Cells
The NAPDH-oxidase activity was determined by
extracellular superoxide anion production that was mea-
sured by the reduction of cytochrome c. CGN were
seeded during different days in the same multiwell plate;
cells were washed twice with Locke medium and then
were incubated with 100 ml of Locke media containing
cytochrome c (250 mM) and b-NADPH (200 mM).
Cytochrome c reduction absorbance (550 nm) was
recorded at 37C in the microplate reader Synergy HT.
The amount of superoxide anion released was calculated
using an extinction coefficient of 21 mMÀ1 cmÀ1. It was
considered 300 mm as the distance that occupies a volume
of 100 ml in a well plus the base of the plate.
Quantitative Real-Time Reverse-Transcription
Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-qPCR)
Total RNA was extracted from CGN grown in depolar-
izing conditions from 0 to 5 DIV using Trizol Reagent
4 ASN Neuro
according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNA qual-
ity was assessed by denaturing agarose gel electrophoresis
and with NanoDro p2000 spectrophotometer (Thermo
Scientific, USA). One mg of total RNA from each
sample was reverse transcribed into cDNA using
M-MVL Reverse Transcriptase with an oligo (dT)12-18
primer. One microgram of cDNA was used to determine
the relative gene expression, which was performed in a
thermal cycler Rotor-gene 6000 (Corbett Life Science),
using TaqMan Universal Master Mix 2X and TaqMan
Assay reagent for NOX1 (Rn00586652_m1), NOX2
(Rn00576710_m1), and GAPDH (Rn01775763_g1;
Applied BiosystemsÕ, USA). The relative level of ampli-
fied mRNA was normalized to the expression of the
housekeeping gene GAPDH. The average Ct value of
the endogenous control (GAPDH) for every sample was
subtracted from the Ct value for each target gene, result-
ing in the ÁCT
value. Fold change was calculated using
the 2ÀÁÁCT method where the comparative cycle thresh-
old (ÁÁCT
) was defined as the difference between ÁCT
of
1 to 5 DIV minus ÁCT
of the DIV in which the expres-
sion reached its maximum.
Immunocytochemistry
CGN were plated at a density of 50 Â 103 cells/cm2 and
were grown onto poly-L-lysine-coated glass slides from 0
to 3 DIV. Cells were washed twice in PBS and fixed with
4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min. Subsequently, cells
were blocked and permeabilized overnight at 4C in
blocking solution (PBS containing 0.5% Triton X-100
and 10% normal goat serum) and then were incubated
overnight at 4C in blocking solution with 1:250
(0.4 mg/ml) rabbit anti-NOX2 and 1:500 mouse anti-Tau
antibodies. The primary antibody anti-NOX2 was
detected with an Alexa FluorÕ 488 goat anti-Rabbit
IgG (HþL) secondary antibody (1:1000) incubated for
2 hr at room temperature. The primary antibody anti-
Tau was detected with a DyLight 594 goat anti-Mouse
IgG (HþL) secondary antibody (1:1000) incubated for
2 hr at room temperature. Coverslips were mounted
using Vectashield mounting media with DAPI. Images
were captured in the FV10i-LIV confocal microscope
(Olympus, USA). Coverslips incubated without primary
antibody or with 1:50 (10 mg/ml) normal rabbit IgG
showed no staining. The staining for Tau detection did
not affect the detection of NOX2 and vice versa.
Measurements of H2
O2
Localization in Living Cells
CGN were transfected before plating with 5 mg of
HyPer-cyto (Evrogen, Rusia), using the Nucleofector
program C-13. CGN were visualized in a microscope
Axiovert 200 M (Carl Zeiss Microscopy, Germany) with
a Lambda DG-4 system (Sutter Instrument, USA) and
a PECON system (PECON, Germany) for cell culture
and microscopy; an objective Fluar 40x/1.30 Oil M27
was used to visualize the cells. HyPer fluorescence was
acquired in two different channels: CH1 (excitation
460­480 nm, beamsplitter 493 nm, emission 505­530)
and CH2 (excitation 379­395 nm, beamsplitter 410 nm,
emission 465­555) in time-laps imaging. The images are
expressed as the ratio of CH1 to CH2 minus their
respective backgrounds. A higher index corresponds
to higher levels of H2
O2
. In order to determine the
regions where the levels of H2
O2
were higher, an ROI
was traced, and the mean fluorescence intensity was
registered during different photograms; the average of
these points was normalized with the average of the
fluorescence in the soma. The measurements were
only considered in the photograms where the ROI
was in focus. The measurement of each structure rep-
resents n ¼ 1. The image analysis was performed in
AxioVision 4.8.2 and Image J.
Axonal Morphology
CGN were labeled with PKH67 in a proportion of
10 Â 103 labeled cells and 18 Â 106 nonlabeled cells.
PKH67 is a dye used for membrane labeling, which
is composed by a green fluorescent dye with long ali-
phatic tales that intercalates into lipid regions of the
membranes (Wallace et al., 2008). Cells were treated
with BSO (100 mM) at the time of plating and, in some
experiments, the cells were treated with Euk-134
(10 mM) 24 hr after plating. Cells were visualized in a
fluorescence microscope and photographed. The
morphology of the axons was classified into three dif-
ferent categories that were as follows: unaltered, with
multiple spheroids, and collapsed. The proportion of
neurons categorized into these three types of morphol-
ogies was determined per experiment and averaged in
independent experiments.
Axonal Growth
CGN were labeled before plated with 3 mM PKH67 at
room temperature for 5 min. An equal volume of 1%
BSA in PBS was then added, and the cells were further
incubated for 1 min to stop the staining reaction. The
labeled cells were then centrifuged at 400 g for 8 min at
room temperature and resuspended in culture medium in
a proportion of 10 Â 103 labeled cells and 18 Â 106 non-
labeled cells. The neurites were measured manually, and
only those neurites longer than the cell diameter and that
did not show contacts with other neurites were con-
sidered; in the case of bipolar CGN, only the longest
neurite was considered. The measurement of each neurite
represents n ¼ 1. The measurements were made in Image J
with the plugin Neuron J.

Statistical Analysis
Statistical analysis was done by using SigmaPlot 12.1
software. Data are expressed as means Æ SEM, unless
otherwise indicated. Pairwise comparison within multiple
groups was done by analysis of variance (ANOVA) fol-
lowed by the Holm­Sidak post hoc test; in some cases,
ANOVA nonparametric test was performed. The statis-
tical significance in the comparisons between two groups
was determined by the Student's t test and by the Mann­
Whitney U test. For the time course results, a paired t test
was used; p values less than 0.05 were considered statis-
tically significant.
Results
The Levels of ROS Are Differentially Regulated
During CGN Development
In order to determine the basal levels of ROS throughout
CGN development, we cultured CGN in depolarizing
(25 mM KCl) and nondepolarizing (5 mM KCl) concen-
trations of potassium chloride. This enabled us to com-
pare two conditions of neuronal development in vitro
where neurons under depolarizing conditions develop
normally, while those in nondepolarizing conditions
mature only partially and died by 8 DIV in a ROS-depen-
dent manner (Schulz et al., 1996). Under these condi-
tions, we measured the cell viability and the metabolic
activity of CGN during the first 5 DIV in order to deter-
mine the time at which cell survival is compromised
during CGN development. In agreement with Gallo
et al. (1987) and others, CGN survival, measured as cal-
cein-propidium iodide incorporation, was dependent on
the state of depolarization after 3 DIV. Figure 1 shows
that when CGN were cultured in nondepolarizing condi-
tions, the cell viability diminished from 4 DIV, while in
depolarizing conditions, the cell viability remained unal-
tered (Figure 1(a) and (b)). On the other hand, the meta-
bolic activity, measured as MTT transformation, was
reduced by 30% at 5 DIV in nondepolarizing conditions
(Figure 1(c)). In contrast, the metabolic activity of CGN
grown in depolarizing conditions showed a sustained
increase during the first 5 DIV (Figure 1(c)).
We also evaluated the basal levels of ROS by the oxi-
dation of dihydroethidium in depolarizing and nondepo-
larizing conditions during the first 5 DIV (Figure 1(d)).
When CGN were cultured in depolarizing conditions, the
levels of ROS increased steadily over time from 0 to 1
DIV (160%) and from 1 to 2 DIV (110%). The maximum
levels reached at 2 DIV were sustained until 3 DIV
(Figure 1(e) and (f)). Subsequently, the levels of ROS
decreased to similar values to those found at 1 DIV
(Figure 1(e)). Then, the levels of ROS remained low
until 8 DIV (Figure 1(f)). On the other hand, when
CGN were cultured in nondepolarizing conditions, the
levels of ROS were similar to those observed in depolar-
izing conditions from 1 to 3 DIV (Figure 1(e)); however,
at 4 and 5 DIV, the levels of ROS increased gradually
(Figure 1(e)). Thus, under these conditions, ROS levels
show two distinct phases: the first phase, from 0 to 3 DIV,
which is independent of the state of depolarization, and a

state of depolarization.
Increased Glutathione Levels Are Required for CGN
Survival During Early Development
The levels of ROS in the cell are determined by the equi-
librium between the production of ROS and the levels
and activity of the antioxidants (Halliwell, 2009).
Among the numerous antioxidants, we evaluated the
glutathione system that is one of the most relevant anti-
oxidant systems in neurons. Moreover, it has been
reported glutathione content changes during the cerebel-
lar cortex development (Nanda et al., 1996; Rice and
Russo-Menna, 1998). Thereby, in order to evaluate a
possible relationship between glutathione and ROS
levels throughout CGN development, we estimated the
levels of GSH and GSSG throughout CGN development
in depolarizing and nondepolarizing conditions. Figure
2(a) shows that when CGN were grown in depolarizing
conditions, the GSH content increased during the first 2
DIV. It is important to note that the most significant
increase was recorded between 0 and 1 DIV ($90%)
that was followed by a slight increase of 10% between
1 and 2 DIV, which persisted until 5 DIV. At 8 DIV, the
levels of GSH significantly decreased to values similar to
those observed at 0 DIV (Figure 2(b)). When cells were
grown in nondepolarizing conditions, the increase in the
levels of GSH was similar to that in depolarizing condi-
tions from 0 to 2 DIV; however, after 3 DIV, the level of
GSH decreased significantly in CGN under nondepolar-
izing conditions at 5 DIV (Figure 2(a)). Interestingly, the
level of GSSG did not change throughout the different
stages of CGN development, and no significant difference
was observed between depolarized and nondepolarized
cells (Figure 2(a).
Considering that the levels of glutathione increase in
correspondence with ROS, we hypothesized that gluta-
thione might be involved in the actions of ROS during
the first 3 DIV. This is further supported by previous
studies showing that high levels of ROS induce cell
death in these cells. It is possible that the observed
decrease in glutathione content in CGN maintained in
nondepolarizing conditions during 3 DIV could either
be a cause or the result of the cell death observed at this
time. In this regard, it has been shown that glutathione
depletion triggers cell death and that glutathione deple-
tion occurs during the cell death process (Franco and
Cidlowski, 2009, 2012).

Based on these evidences, we evaluated the role of
glutathione in CGN survival by reducing the glutathione
content in CGN cultures treated during the last 24 hr or
48 hr of culture with BSO, an inhibitor of g-glutamylcys-
teine synthetase, which is the first and rate-limiting
enzyme for the biosynthesis of glutathione. Figure 2(c)
and Supplementary Figure 1 show that BSO treatment
for 48 hr, markedly decreased GSH content at 2, 3, 5,
and 8 DIV. Similarly, GSSG content were also signifi-
cantly reduced by BSO at all ages measured. When cell
viability was evaluated, we found that BSO did not affect
CGN survival at any time when cultures were treated
during the last 24 hr (Figure 2(d); however, when cultures
were treated for 48 hr, we observed a significant complete
reduction of cell viability in CGN cultures at 2 DIV
(Figure 2(e). The observed effect of BSO was completely
prevented by the antioxidant Euk-134 (Figure 2(f) and
(g)), suggesting that cell death induced by BSO at 2
DIV is due to an oxidative stress induced by glutathione
reduction. Interestingly, under these conditions, cell
viability was not affected in cultures of 3 to 8 DIV.
These results indicate that CGN vulnerability to cell
death related to oxidative stress is present only at 2
DIV, when CGN are in the process of maturation. The
fact that the levels of glutathione were also completely
diminished in CGN treated with BSO plus Euk-134 at 2
DIV (Figure 3(c)), a condition that does not affect cell
viability, indicates that glutathione estimation was not
affected by the antioxidant nor by the low protein content
induced by the cell death process. Thus, there seems to be

a narrow developmental time window where ROS seem
to play a critical role not only for neuronal survival but
also for neuronal maturation. In addition, from 3 to 8
DIV, ROS are no longer required for cell maturation, but
the lack of trophic influences (nondepolarizing condi-
tions) could induce some mechanisms leading to an
increase in ROS levels and then to cell death.
ROS Promote CGN Development
Previous studies suggest that ROS regulate some events
of the nervous system development (Tsatmali et al., 2006;
Le Belle et al., 2011; Celotto et al., 2012; Coyoy et al.,
2013). In order to evaluate the relevance of ROS during
CGN development, we tested the effect of two antioxi-
dants, the mimetic of glutathione peroxidase Ebselen
(Parnham and Kindt, 1984) and the mimetic of
superoxide dismutase and catalase Euk-134 (Baker
et al., 1998), as well as two general inhibitors of
NOX1-2, AEBSF and apocynin (Diatchuk et al., 1997;
Cheret et al., 2008; Hernandez-Enriquez et al., 2011;
Dvoriantchikova et al., 2012; Lu et al., 2012) on the
expression of Tau and MAP2 during CGN development.
The expressions of these proteins are indicators of neur-
onal maturation (Dehmelt and Halpain, 2004). First, we
determined the relative levels of Tau and MAP2 from 0 to
3 DIV, and, as expected, we found a correlation between
the levels of these two proteins and the CGN develop-
ment (Figure 3(a)). In both cases, the highest increase was
between 1 and 2 DIV. When CGN were treated with
Ebselen and Euk-134 at 0 DIV during 24 hr, no effect
on the levels of Tau and MAP2 were observed; however,
AEBSF and apocynin significantly diminished the levels
of Tau by 50%, while AEBSF, but not apocynin treat-
ment, significantly diminished the levels of MAP2 by
70% (Figure 3(b)). When CGN were treated during
24 hr at 1 DIV, the antioxidants had no effect on the
levels of Tau, but diminished MAP2 levels by 30%. In
contrast, both AEBSF and apocynin significantly
reduced the expression of Tau and MAP2 by 60% and
30%, respectively (Figure 3(c)). Finally, when CGN were
treated from 2 to 3 DIV, none of the treatments had any
effect in the levels of Tau and MAP2 (Figure 3(d)).
NADPH Oxidase Activity and the Expression
of NOX Homologues Change During CGN
Development
It has been shown previously that NOX enzymes are
major source of ROS in several cell types (Bedard and
Krause, 2007; Sorce and Krause, 2009). Because NOX
inhibitors interfere with CGN maturation, we hypothe-
sized that members of the NOX family could be mediat-
ing ROS production during CGN development. In order
to determine the relevance of ROS producing enzymes in
developing CGN, we measured the NOX activity in cul-
tured CGN by determining the extracellular reduction of
cytochrome c by superoxide anion produced by NOX
(Figure 4(a)). In CGN grown under depolarizing condi-
tions, the NOX activity gradually increased between 1 to
3 DIV ($50%) and then the activity decreased to levels
close to those found at 2 DIV, which is similar to the
ROS production observed from 1 to 5 DIV (Figure 1(e)).
To evaluate the importance of some NOX homologues
in the CGN development, we determined the expression of
NOX1 and NOX2 in CGN cultured in depolarizing condi-
tions from 0 to 5 DIV by using quantitative real-time RT-
PCR (Figure 4(b) to (e)). Under these conditions, we found
that NOX1 and NOX2 showed the lowest expression at 0
DIV. NOX1 reached the highest expression at 1 DIV and
afterwards it gradually decreased (Figure 4(b)). NOX2 pre-
sented a marked increase from 1 to 2 DIV and a minor
increment between 2 and 3 DIV. Afterwards, the levels of
NOX2 diminished abruptly from 3 to 4 DIV (Figure 4(c)).
When the relative mRNA expression of NOX1 and NOX2
were compared, we observed a higher abundance of NOX2
than NOX1 at both 1 and 3 DIV (Figure 4(d) and (e)).
NOX2 and H2
O2
Localization in Developing CGN
Some studies have highlighted the importance of the com-
partmentalization of ROS production in cells (Mishina
et al., 2011), which may allow ROS to activate particular
redox signaling events in specific regions of the cells
(Ushio-Fukai, 2009). Accordingly, we studied the local-
ization of NOX2 in developing CGN cultured in depolar-
izing conditions, based on the finding that this is one of
the most abundant homologues in CGN (Figure 4(d) and
(e)). Supplementary Figure 2 shows an immunocyto-
chemistry study at normal density, in which the mark
of NOX2 is localized in the axons, but no details of the
specific location of the label can be appreciated.
Therefore, the immunolocalization of NOX2 was carried
out in cultures with a lower density than in the rest of the
experiments in order to visualize the NOX2-positive
structures. This condition did not affect the cell survival
(data not shown). Figure 5 shows that NOX2 was mostly
distributed in neurites, and it was closely associated with
the growth cones at 0 and 3 DIV. Particularly, at 0 DIV,
NOX2 was preferentially concentrated in the growth
cones of most developing neurites (Figure 5(a)), as well
as in some protrusion. In the more advanced stage of
development (3 DIV), NOX2 was enriched in filopodia,
axonal varicosities, and growth cones (Figure 5(b)); thus
suggesting that ROS might be produced in specific regions
of the developing neurons. The distribution of Tau, a
marker of early neurites, showed a close correlation with
NOX2 labeling, particularly at 3 DIV (Figure 5).
Several studies have shown that ROS are produced in
axonal growth cones during axonal outgrowth and

guidance (Munnamalai and Suter, 2009; Morinaka et al.,
2011; Munnamalai et al., 2014). To evaluate ROS com-
partmentalization, we used an experimental approach
that allowed the detection of variations of ROS levels
in real time with a high time and spatial resolution.
This was achieved by transfecting CGN with the plasmid
HyPer that is a genetically encoded fluorescent sensor
designed for high specific detection of cytoplasmic H2
O2
(Belousov et al., 2006), which has been suggested to be
the most suitable signaling ROS. The ratiometric sensor
used has one emission peak at 516 nm and two excitation
peaks at 420 nm and 500 nm. The emission fluorescence
changes upon exposure to H2
O2
; while the excitation
peak at 420 nm decreases, the peak at 500 nm increases,
which allows us to determine the difference in H2
O2
levels
in different regions of the neuron, independently of the
amount of protein expressed. We found that H2
O2
is
heterogeneously distributed throughout neurons cultured
during 1 to 3 DIV under depolarizing conditions

CGN of 2 DIV. At this time, ROS reach their maximum
levels, and the plasmid HyPer also reaches its maximum

Figure 6(a) to (f) show that, although basal level of
H2
O2
was present in all the neuronal structures, there is
a clear difference in H2
O2
levels between the soma and the
axon and dendrites. H2
O2
is evenly distributed in the
soma, and the levels are relatively low (Figure 6(a), (c),
and (e)). The levels of H2
O2
in the soma did not change
with time under basal conditions, but the fluorescent
signal increased when cells were treated with exogenous
H2
O2
(Supplementary Figure 3(a) to (d) and
Supplementary videos 16­17). In contrast, the distribu-
tion of the H2
O2
along the axon shaft was variable under
basal conditions; in some areas, the concentration was
slightly lower than those observed in the soma, while
some other areas showed relatively higher H2
O2
levels
than in the soma. In the regions where no filopodia or
varicosities are presented, the average level of H2
O2
was
approximately equal to the values recorded in the soma
(Figure 6(a) to (f)). Interestingly, the axonal zones showing
high levels of H2
O2
corresponded to regions with high
growing or remodeling activity, such as axonal growth
cones and filopodial regions (Figure 6(b) to (d) and (f)).
In all cases, these zones showed H2
O2
levels that doubled
the levels detected in the soma or other regions of the axon
(Figure 6(h)). We also observed that, regardless of the
magnitude of movement in the axonal growth cones,
these regions always showed high levels of H2
O2
(Supplementary videos 6 to 9). High levels of H2
O2
were
also found in dendritic growth cones (Figure 6(a), (c), and
(h)). Not all the dynamic regions corresponded to high
levels of H2
O2
, but also in the varicosities (Figure 6(d)
and (h)). The relative levels of H2
O2
in the different regions
of the axon are indicated in Table 1.
As mentioned, high levels of H2
O2
are localized in the
regions of the axon shaft where filopodia are located
(Figure 6(f) to (h)); this was more prominent in regions
where filopodia are constantly remodeling (dynamic
zones). In these regions, we found clear variations in
H2
O2
levels that are restrained to microdomains of the
axon shaft where filopodia are growing and retracting. It
was generally observed an increase in H2
O2
levels
immediately before the filopodia formation, which
reached its peak during the process and then dropped
to the basal value at the end of the process. In certain
cases, high levels were found inside the filopodia, par-
ticularly in situations when filopodia were very motile
or other protrusions were formed in the filopodia
(Figure 6(g) and (i)). These findings are illustrated in
Figure 6(g), in which serial images of the dynamic zone
are shown.
The observed changes in H2
O2
levels occurred in a
time scale of minutes (such as in the case of axonal
growth cones, the axon, the soma, and varicosities) or
in a range of seconds (such as in the case of dendritic
growth cones, dynamic zones, and filopodia).
Supplementary Figure 3(e) and (f) show that although
H2
O2
levels are continuously fluctuating during the
period registered, the levels of H2
O2
are always relatively
high. Each image presented in this study has its corres-
ponded supplementary video (see Supplementary videos
1­6) . The scales bars of Figure 6(e) and (f) are different
than in Supplementary Figure 3(c) and (f) in order to
allow a proper measurement of the ratio during the
H2
O2
perfusion.
Glutathione Maintains Axonal Integrity During the
Early Development of CGN
High levels of ROS have been associated with an
alteration of cell physiology and structural damage that
leads to cell death (Ryter et al., 2007). Also, as we men-
tioned above, glutathione is a major antioxidant system
in neurons. Thus, we evaluated the effect of glutathione
depletion by BSO treatment in the structural integrity
and H2
O2
levels of CGN axons. To achieve this, we
visualized a partial population of CGN stained with
PKH67 dye, which allowed us to study individual axons
(Supplementary Figure 4). Figure 7(a) shows that 2 DIV
CGN treated with BSO during 42 hr show a clear alter-
ation in the axonal structure. Some cells show axons with
multiple spheroid-like structures (Figure 7(b)). In other
cells, these structures seem to increase in size and number
leading to a collapse-like appearance of the axon. No
evident alteration in the structure of the somas was
detected. The observed effects of BSO are mediated by
ROS because the presence of the antioxidant Euk-134
completely prevented the mentioned alterations
(Figure 7(a) and (b)). The quantification of the morpho-
logical alteration induced by BSO is shown in Figure 7(c).
About 40% of the BSO-treated cells showed a collapsed-
like axon and 50% corresponded to CGN with little spher-
oid-like structures. Also, about 10% of the cells with
spheroid-like structures were not rescued by Euk-134,
and no collapsed-like axons were observed in the presence
of the antioxidant, suggesting that the formation of the
small spheroids precede the formation of the collapsed-
like axons and that neurons show different susceptibility
to glutathione depletion. When CGN transfected with the
plasmid HyPer were treated with BSO for 42hr, we found
that practically all the spheroid-like structures contained
high levels of H2
O2
, which was more evident in the col-
lapsed-like axons. No evident increment in H2
O2
levels
was detected in the somas (Figure 7(d) and
Supplementary videos 10­15). We also observed that
axonal continuity was not lost in the collapsed-like
axons, as it was possible to observe the continuity of the
axons in neurons transfected with HyPer (data not shown).

NOX2 Regulates Neurite Outgrowth of CGN
We hypothesized that NOX2 might be involved in the
neurite outgrowth of CGN because NOX2 is expressed
in growth cones, and NOX inhibitors partially
decreased the expression of Tau and MAP2. To
address this, we measured the neurite outgrowth and
ROS levels in CGN obtained from NOX2 KO and
wild-type mice (Figure 8). Under these conditions, we
found no apparent differences in wild-type and NOX2
KO CGN in the phase contrast images at 1 and 2 DIV
(Figure 8(c)). When CGN were stained with PKH67
and the neurites were measured, we found that CGN
neurites from wild-type mouse showed a consistent
growth that was markedly increased by about 3 times
from 1 to 2 DIV (Figure 8(a) and (b)). In contrast, the
neurite outgrowth of NOX2 KO CGN was about 25%
(at 1 DIV) and 20% (at 2 DIV) lesser than that
observed in CGN from wild-type animals (Figure
8(a) and (b)). When we measured the levels of ROS
in wild-type and NOX2 KO CGN, we found that
ROS levels increased by twofold from 1 DIV to 2
DIV (Figure 8(c) to (e)). When we compared the
levels of ROS between wild-type and NOX2 KO
CGN at 1 and 2 DIV, no differences were found
(Figure 8(f)).

ROS and NOX During CGN Development
In this study, we found that ROS production is regulated
throughout CGN development. In this regard, we pro-
pose that CGN development could be divided into two
distinct phases. In the first phase, ROS increase during
the first 2 DIV and remain high until 3 DIV, which is
independent of the state of depolarization. In the second
phase, the levels of ROS are dependent on the state of
depolarization; in depolarizing conditions, ROS levels
diminish at 4 DIV and then remain low during the sub-
sequent days, while in nondepolarizing conditions, ROS
levels continue increasing at 4 and 5 DIV (Figure 9(a) and
(b)). During these two phases, CGN undergo different
developmental processes. During the first phase, CGN
initiate the biochemical (Gallo et al., 1987) and morpho-
logical (Powell et al., 1997) processes of maturation, and
at 3 DIV, most CGN have already developed the axon
and multiple short dendrites (de la Torre-Ubieta et al.,
2010). The second phase is coincident with a dependence
of CGN survival on depolarization (Gallo et al., 1987)
and dendrite maturation (Shalizi et al., 2006; Ramos
et al., 2007).
Our results show that, in spite of the high levels of
ROS observed at 2 and 3 DIV, CGN viability is not
compromised regardless the state of depolarization. In
contrast, during the second phase, our data show a cor-
relation between low ROS levels and CGN survival in
depolarizing conditions, but in nondepolarizing condi-
tions, high ROS levels are associated with a reduction
of the metabolic activity and cell survival (Figure 9(a)
and (b)). In this regard, we have previously shown that
ROS could be signals that trigger the process of apoptotic
cell death of CGN at 8 DIV when CGN are switched
from a depolarizing condition to a nondepolarizing
condition (Ramiro-Cortes and Moran, 2009; Ramiro-
Cortes et al., 2011). Together, these results suggest
that the regulation of ROS during CGN development
may be critical for the survival of CGN during the
second phase.
Glutathione Regulation During CGN Development
Here, we also addressed the possibility that glutathione
could be responsible for regulating the levels of ROS
during development, this is supported by the idea that
the balance between ROS production and the expression
and activity of the antioxidant systems determine ROS
levels in the cells. It is known that during nervous system
development, neurons and glial cells contain glutathione,
and by the postnatal Day 5, most neurons have decreased
the levels of glutathione, while olfactory mitral and
granule cells, CGN, and dorsal root ganglion neurons
consistently retain high levels of glutathione throughout
development and in adulthood (Beiswanger et al., 1995).
Moreover, glutathione deficient mice die before the embry-
onic Day 8.5 by massive apoptosis (Shi et al., 2000), and
mice lacking of glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPx4) die before
the embryonic Day 8 also by an increase in apoptosis
(Yant et al., 2003). Interestingly, while GPx4 is expressed
in neurons, glial cells are devoid of GPx4 (Savaskan et al.,
2007); furthermore, it seems that the developing brain con-
stitutes a major site for GPx4 expression, while the specific
suppression of GPx4 between the embryonic Days 7.5 and
10.5 led to microcephaly and abnormal hindbrain devel-
opment (Borchert et al., 2006). These studies suggest a
fundamental role of glutathione during nervous system
development.
In this study, we found changes in the levels of gluta-
thione content during CGN development. In the first
phase, when ROS levels are relatively high, the

glutathione content increases independently of the state
of depolarization; in general, during the time when ROS
are in their highest levels, the glutathione content are also
in its highest levels. One possibility to explain this obser-
vation could be associated with a mechanism to balance
the levels of ROS required for optimal redox signaling
and to prevent the deleterious effects of ROS during the
first phase. The major increase of glutathione content
occurred from 0 DIV to 1 DIV which precedes the
major increase observed in ROS (Figure 9(a) and (b)).
Thereby, these results might suggest that glutathione con-
tent in CGN development responds to an internal genetic
program of the cells, which is independent of the trophic
conditions and ROS levels. The idea is supported by the
fact that in vivo, the glutathione content in the developing
cerebellum increases by the time when CGN precursors
begin their process of differentiation CGN (Nanda et al.,
1996; Rice and Russo-Menna, 1998; Komuro and
Yacubova, 2003).
It is known that chronic treatments with BSO and
oxygen in rat-pups lead to a high rate of apoptosis in
the hippocampus, cerebellum, basal forebrain, and stri-
atum (Taglialatela et al., 1998). In this regard, our results
demonstrate that the increase in the glutathione content

is necessary to allow CGN development because glutathi-
one depletion at 2 DIV drastically reduces CGN survival,
but it does not affect CGN survival in later stages of
CGN development. This process could be explained by
two major mechanisms of action of glutathione, one is
the interaction of glutathione with proteins, which modi-
fies signaling pathways during variations in ROS homeo-
stasis (Grek et al., 2013) and by a second mechanism that
involves the antioxidant actions of glutathione. The fact
that the antioxidant Euk-134 completely rescues CGN
viability under glutathione depletion strongly suggests
that the effect of glutathione in CGN survival is due to
its antioxidant properties.
During the second phase, the levels of glutathione con-
tent are dependent on the state of depolarization. In
depolarizing conditions, glutathione remains high from
3 to 5 DIV, a time when ROS levels decrease markedly.
In contrast, in nondepolarizing conditions, the glutathi-
one content diminishes since 4 DIV, which correlates with
the observed decrease in CGN survival and high ROS
levels (Figure 9(a) and (b)). This decrease in glutathione
content can be considered an early hallmark of the cell
death progression (Franco and Cidlowski, 2012). To rule
out the possibility that the decrease of glutathione con-
tent is responsible for the cell death observed during the
second phase in nondepolarizing conditions, we dimin-
ished the levels of glutathione with BSO; however,
although glutathione content was importantly reduced
with BSO treatment, the cell viability at the incubation
tested times did not alter CGN survival at 5 DIV under
depolarizing conditions, indicating that a decrease in
glutathione content is not sufficient to trigger cell death
in developing CGN and that the decrease in glutathione
content during the second phase in nondepolarizing

process.
ROS and NOX in CGN Maturation
The possibility that ROS are required for CGN develop-
ment in the first phase is supported by our results show-
ing that antioxidant conditions markedly diminished the
levels of Tau and MAP2 proteins. Interestingly, we found
that the antioxidants Ebselen and Euk-134 only reduced
MAP2 expression at 2 DIV, while the NOX inhibitors,
AEBSF, and apocynin diminished the levels of Tau at 1
and 2 DIV, suggesting a more specific action of the ROS
produced by NOX activity in this process (Figure 9(c)
and (d)). None of these treatments diminished the expres-
sion of these proteins at 3 DIV, which could be explained
by the fact that between 2 and 3 DIV the levels of these
two proteins are not significantly increased under control
conditions or that by this time the maturational process
of CGN is no longer dependent on ROS.
It is noteworthy to mention that, based on the pro-
posed mechanism of inhibition of AEBSF and apocynin,
their primary target would be the NOX1 and NOX2
homologues (Jaquet et al., 2009). However, because the
effect of these inhibitors is only partial, in this study, we
cannot exclude the contribution of other NOX homo-
logues and other sources of ROS in the CGN develop-
ment. Also, although we cannot discard that part of
the effects of apocynin or AEBSF could be due to unspe-
cific actions, their effects are validated with the use of a
second NOX inhibitor (apocynin or AEBSF). Thus, we
think that the results obtained using separately both
inhibitors with similar results may indicate that NOX is
involved in the production of ROS required for CGN
maturation.
Our results are in accordance with previous observa-
tions indicating that ROS produced by NOX enzymes
may act as signaling molecules in the regulation of the
neuronal differentiation of PC12 cells. In these cells, it is
well known that the neurotrophin NGF induces the
expression of different neuronal markers such as bIII-
tubulin, GAP-43, and neurofilament L through the acti-
vation of the receptor TrkA which leads to the activation
of the signaling pathway Ras/Raf/MEK/ERKs (Kaplan
and Miller, 2000; Patapoutian and Reichardt, 2001).
Besides, NGF induces an increase in the levels of ROS
produced by NOX after 10 min of treatment (Suzukawa
et al., 2000). These ROS induce the phosphorylation of
TrkA through the inhibition of protein tyrosine phos-
phatases and the formation of complexes with the scaf-
fold proteins Shc, Grb2, and Sos, which are required for
the activation of the MAPK pathway (Kamata et al.,
2005). On the other hand, NGF also induces the phos-
phorylation of ERKs after 30 min, which induces the
expression and activity of the mitochondrial super oxide
dismutase (MnSOD), and the H2
O2
resulting from the
MnSOD activity induces a second phosphorylation of
ERKs, which is essential for PC12 differentiation
(Cassano et al., 2010).
Further studies have shown that NOX enzymes medi-
ate the neuronal differentiation in different models (Wang
et al., 2007; Kennedy et al., 2010; Nitti et al., 2010; Le
Belle et al., 2011). In the present study, we found that
NOX shows a pattern of activity similar to the ROS levels
observed during the first and second phases of CGN
development in depolarizing conditions. Different NOX
homologues could contribute to the observed NOX activ-
ity, which is in line with our findings about the expression
of NOX1 and NOX2 enzymes that are highly regulated
throughout CGN development. Overall, in the first
phase, the mRNA levels of both NOX1 and NOX2 are
upregulated, while in the second phase, they are down-
regulated. Interestingly, each NOX homologue showed a
slightly different pattern of expression, which suggests
that these enzymes might have distinct roles during
CGN development.
It is important to note that the expression of NOX2
follows more closely both the total NOX activity and the
ROS levels. Furthermore, the mRNA levels of NOX2 are
considerably more abundant than mRNA NOX1 levels.
Thereby, we hypothesize that NOX2 could be the main
source of the ROS produced during CGN development.
However, we found no differences in the levels of ROS
measured by dihydroethidium between NOX2 KO and
wild-type CGN at 1 DIV and 2 DIV. Thus, these results
suggest that NOX2 is not responsible for the increase of
ROS observed during the first phase of CGN develop-
ment. Nevertheless, we cannot discard a possible com-
pensatory mechanism in the NOX2 KO CGN, which
has been demonstrated in other preparations where an
upregulation of NOX4 occurs in NOX2 KO mice in
cells where NOX2 gene has been silenced (Pendyala
et al., 2009) or when an indirect downregulation of
NOX2 leads to an overexpression of NOX4 (Sedeek
et al., 2010).
Despite the fact that ROS levels measured by dihy-
droethidium were not affected in NOX2 KO CGN, we
found a slight decrease in the length of CGN axons at 1
DIV and 2 DIV, which corroborates the importance of
NOX2 during CGN development. Our findings that
NOX2 KO CGN showed a reduction of neurite outgrow
is in agreement with other studies carried out in Aplysia
neurons that shows that NOX inhibitors reduce actin
flow and its assembly at the leading edge of the axonal
growth cone, leading to a decrease of the neurite out-
growth (Munnamalai and Suter, 2009). The regulation
of NOX2 in the axonal growth cones of Aplysia neurons
seems to be bidirectional because the stimulation of
NOX2 produces H2
O2
, which regulates F-actin dynamics
and neurite outgrowth; on the other hand, the
Olgui

stimulation of neurite outgrowth induces the proximity of
the cytoplasmic subunit of NOX2, p40phox, to its cata-
lytic subunit, gp91phox, indicating that the regulation of
cytoskeleton dynamics affects NOX2 activity
(Munnamalai et al., 2014).
The relevance of NOX2 in the nervous system devel-
opment is strengthened by the alterations of the brain
physiology observed in NOX2 KO mice. These animals
display deficits in hippocampal synaptic plasticity and
mild impairments in cognitive function, as well a slight
deficiency in motor learning (Kishida et al., 2006), which
might be attributed to an altered function in either the
cerebellar cortex or the deep cerebellar nuclei (Caston
et al., 1995). Moreover, these mice have less proliferating
cells in the subventricular zone, less migrating cells
and fewer neuronal differentiation in the olfactory bulb
than in wild-type mice (Le Belle et al., 2011). However, it
has not been reported if the alterations in motor behavior
observed in NOX2 KO mice are due to aberrations in
the formation of cerebellar circuits or alterations in the
synaptic plasticity and function. In a previous study,
we found that the treatment of developing rats with apoc-
ynin or with the antioxidant MnTmPyP, produced alter-
ations in the cerebellar foliation as well as a deficiency
in motor behavior, measured as alteration in the rod
walking and Rotarod tests (Coyoy et al., 2013).
The results obtained in the present study suggest that
part of the actions of ROS and NOX could be related
to neurite development during cerebellar cortex
formation.
H2
O2
and NOX Localization
In line with the above findings, we explored the possibility
that H2
O2
were produced locally in developing CGN, as
well as the possible contribution of glutathione as a regu-
lator of H2
O2
. Although it is not completely understood
how redox signaling occurs, there is increasing evidence
indicating that the physiological function of ROS, and
particularly H2
O2
, might occur by the activation of spe-
cific signaling pathways through reversible redox modifi-
cations of proteins in subcellular compartments (Chen
et al., 2009; Ushio-Fukai, 2009; Gough and Cotter,
2011; Mishina et al., 2011; Kaludercic et al., 2014).
Interestingly, we found different regions of the developing
axons and dendrites where H2
O2
is continuously pro-
duced. These regions apparently correspond to those
regions where NOX2 is expressed. For example, NOX2
is enriched in filopodia, either in the axonal shaft where
filopodia are located or inside the filopodia, coincident
with the microdomains where H2
O2
is continuously pro-
duced (Figure 9(f)), which suggest that both NOX2 and
H2
O2
might be related to filopodial dynamics. Moreover,
we also observed that the increase of H2
O2
inside the
filopodia occurs previous to the filopodia elongation
and that after the process of filopodia retraction, the
amount of H2
O2
returns to basal levels. Together,
these results strongly suggest that H2
O2
is involved in
filopodia formation and that NOX2 might be a possible
source for the H2
O2
produced. This idea is supported by
previous studies showing that ROS control actin dynam-
ics (Munnamalai and Suter, 2009; Sakai et al., 2012; Lee
et al., 2013; Munnamalai et al., 2014). In neutrophils,
the physiological levels of H2
O2
produced by NOX2
negatively regulate the actin polymerization by inducing
actin glutathionylation, while the overexpression of glu-
taredoxin 1, which is the enzyme that catalyzes actin
deglutathionylation, leads to multiple pseudopodia for-
mation (Sakai et al., 2012). In macrophages, the forma-
tion of filopodia and actin polymerization are regulated
by the reversible oxidation of two methionine residues
by MICAL1 and MICAL2; the oxidation of these resi-
dues leads to actin disassembly, while the reduction of
these residues by the methionine-R-sulfoxide reductase
B1 lead to actin assembly, which in conjunction orches-
trate actin dynamics and macrophage function (Lee
et al., 2013). Therefore, we speculate that redox reac-
tions might control filopodia formation in developing
CGN.
On the other hand, the localization of NOX2 in the
axonal growth cones also correlates with the observed
high levels of H2
O2
. This result suggests that H2
O2
might be related to axonal growth cone dynamics and
that H2
O2
could be produced by NOX2, which is in
line with the observation that NOX2 KO CGN showed
less axonal growth than the wild-type CGN (Figure 9(d)
and (f)). This association has been previously examined in
Aplysia neurons, where the H2
O2
produced by NOX2
modulates f-actin dynamics and promotes axonal
growth (Munnamalai et al., 2014). On the other hand,
it has also been shown that H2
O2
negatively regulates
axonal growth. In dorsal root ganglion neurons,
semaphorin3A induces growth cone collapse by the regu-
lation of cytoskeleton through CRMP2. Semaphorine3A
induces the generation of H2
O2
in the axonal growth
cone through MICAL, which oxidizes CRMP2 and
induces the formation of a transient disulfide-linked
homodimer between the cysteines 504 of two CRMP2
proteins. Then, this homodimer is reduced by thiore-
doxin that forms a disulfide bond with one molecule of
CRMP2. This complex is crucial for CRMP2 phosphor-
ylation by GSK3-b, which ultimately produces the
growth cone collapse of these neurons (Morinaka
et al., 2011). Although it is not completely understood
the regulation of the axonal growth cone dynamics by
H2
O2
, it seems that multiple ROS sources are localized
in this region, and it is clear that ROS regulate the mech-
anisms responsible for the morphological organization of
these structures; thereby, further studies are required to
asses these issues.

Finally, we explored the possibility that axonal integ-
rity were altered in the absence of glutathione.
Interestingly, while we found no evident alterations in
the neuronal soma, we observed a severe aberrant
axonal alteration in CGN treated with BSO that con-
duces to axonal degeneration followed by cell death,
which suggest that ROS levels are critical for both
axonal formation and integrity (Figure 9(e) and (g)).
The spheroid-like structures formed in BSO treatments
are possibly formed by the dysregulation of the H2
O2
production in the axon because these structures are
enriched in H2
O2
and their formation is drastically inhib-
ited by the antioxidant treatment. The spheroid-like
structures found in CGN treated with BSO resemble the
structures found in a classic model of axonal degeneration.
This could have clinical implications because axons degen-
erate before cell bodies in different neurodegenerative dis-
eases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Alzheimer's
disease, Parkinson's disease, and Huntington's disease,
among others (Coleman, 2005; Conforti et al., 2014),
which has been related to a process of oxidative stress
(Barnham et al., 2004). Thereby, we speculate that the
dysregulation of the mechanisms that regulate ROS
during neuronal development could be similar to those
that are involved in neurodegenerative diseases.
Conclusions
In the present study, we showed evidence suggesting
that ROS regulate different aspects of CGN develop-
ment. During the first 3 DIV, ROS increased which is
necessary for CGN maturation. If the production of
these molecules is not regulated in the subsequent
days due to the trophic conditions (i.e., low potassium),
ROS lead to CGN death. Before the peak of ROS,
glutathione content increased, which seems to be
required for CGN to complete their development
because the pharmacologically induced depletion of
glutathione at this time conduced to CGN death.
Most of the ROS produced at this stage are probably
produced by NOX2, which is mainly localized in filo-
podia and growth cones. These regions correspond to
microdomains in which H2
O2
is continuously produced.
In line with these results, neurite outgrowth is less in
NOX2 KO CGN than in wild-type CGN, which suggest
that NOX2 is important during the early stages of CGN
development. Finally, the pharmacological depletion of
glutathione demonstrated the importance of glutathione
as a regulator of the H2
O2
produced in CGN axons
and the importance of ROS during the axonal morpho-
genesis. Together these results suggest that the
H2
O2
produced by NOX2, in combination with glutathi-
one, controls axonal morphogenesis in CGN, which con-
tribute to our understanding about neuronal
development.
Summary
The antioxidant systems involving glutathione and the
pro-oxidant NOX2 system regulates the reactive oxygen
species levels involved in the axonal morphogenesis and
cell survival of cerebellar granule neurons during the
early stages of development in an in vitro model.
