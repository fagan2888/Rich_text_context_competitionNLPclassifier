N-acetyl-S-(2-hydroxyethyl)-L-cysteine (2-hydroxyethyl mercapturic acid, HEMA) is a urinary metabolite of several hazardous chemicals, including vinyl
chloride (VC), ethylene oxide (EO), and ethylene dibromide (EDB). Information about the levels of HEMA in the general population is useful for assessing
human exposures to HEMA parent compounds, including VC, EO, and EDB. To establish reference range concentrations for HEMA, we analyzed urine
samples from 412 adult participants in the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III) by using isotope-dilution high-performance
liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS). HEMA was detected in 71% of the samples examined. Creatinine-corrected
concentrations ranged from less than 0.68 g/g creatinine to 58.7 g/g creatinine; the 95th percentile concentration was 11.2 g/g creatinine; and the geometric
mean and median creatinine-corrected concentrations were both 1.6 g/g creatinine. We observed a statistically significant difference (P=0.0001) in the
creatinine-corrected geometric mean concentration values of HEMA between smokers (2.8 g/g creatinine) and nonsmokers (1.1 g/g creatinine). The high
levels of HEMA seen among smokers likely originated from HEMA-producing chemicals known to be present in tobacco smoke.
Introduction
As a result of industrialization, humans are exposed to
increasing amounts of environmental toxicants. Among
these toxicants are the volatile organic compounds (VOCs),
a group of low molecular weight chemicals that have been
linked to cancer and other adverse health effects (Comstock
et al., 1976; Ramsey and Flanagan, 1982; IARC, 1995).
VOCs are used as chemical intermediates, dry-cleaning
chemicals, solvents, degreasers, paint components, and
other industrial products. Some VOCs are present in
cigarette smoke, gasoline, and automobile exhausts, and
they are also formed during the chlorination of drinking
water and certain combustion processes.
Vinyl chloride (VC) is a VOC used in the production of
polyvinyl chloride (PVC). PVC is employed to manufacture
plastic and vinyl products such as pipes, electrical wire and
cable coatings, furniture and automobile upholstery, wall
coverings, packaging materials, housewares, and automotive
parts (ATSDR, 1997). VC is a known human carcinogen
(ATSDR, 1997). Long-term exposure to low levels of VC has
been associated with liver tumors, including hepatic angio-
sarcoma (Heath et al., 1975; Thomas et al., 1975; Wagoner,
1983;ATSDR,1997),andacuteexposurestoVChaveresulted
in death (ATSDR, 1997). Sources of release of VC to the
environment include the emissions and effluents from plastic
industries, the disposal of VC wastes in landfills, the
incompletecombustionofPVC,andtobaccosmoke(ATSDR,
1997). In general, inhalation is the most important route of
exposuretoVC;ingestionofcontaminateddrinkingwaterand
food are other minor routes of exposure.
Ethylene oxide (EO) is another VOC that is used
extensively as a chemical intermediate in the polymer
industry (e.g., in the production of ethylene glycol), as a
fumigant, and for the sterilization of medical instruments
and supplies. EO is also produced endogenously in humans
at low nanograms per liter levels (Filser et al., 1992) as a
metabolic product of ethylene, a natural body constituent
(Filser et al., 1992; Bolt, 1996). Like VC, EO is also found
in cigarette smoke (Hoffmann and Hoffmann, 1997). EO is

a known human carcinogen (IARC, 1994), and studies have
reported increased spontaneous abortions among EO-
exposed women (Rowland et al., 1996). Inhalation is the
most prominent route of EO exposure.
Ethylene dibromide (EDB), another VOC, formerly used
as a fumigant, is currently used as a scavenger of lead
compounds in gasoline. The decreasing market of leaded
gasoline in the U.S. has resulted in lower EDB usage, but
the disposal of EDB and resultant contamination of water
supplies remain an environmental concern. EDB is a known
animal carcinogen and a suspected human carcinogen
(Alexeeff et al., 1990; ATSDR, 1992). EDB is also irritating
to the skin and eyes, and EDB exposure may harm sperm
and decrease fertility in humans (Alexeeff et al., 1990). The
most important route of exposure to EDB is ingestion
of contaminated drinking water (Pignatello and Cohen,
1990).
It is important to monitor human exposure to VC, EO,
and EDB because of the adverse health effects of these
VOCs (ATSDR, 1992, 1997; IARC, 1994). Laboratory
surveillance of human exposure to VC, EO, and EDB
requires information on reference range values of these
toxicants in the general population. Reference range
concentrations are defined as concentrations of a chemical
obtained from a reference population with only minimal or
no known exposure to this chemical or its parent
compound(s) (Pirkle et al., 1995; Needham et al., 1996).
Reference range values for VC, EO, and EDB are not
known. The purpose of our study was to determine the
reference range concentrations for N-acetyl-S-(2-hydro-
xyethyl)-L-cysteine (2-hydroxyethyl mercapturic acid,
HEMA), a urinary metabolite of VC, EO, EDB, acrylonitrile
(ACN), and other electrophilic compounds with a two-
carbon backbone (Van Bladeren et al., 1981; Linhart et al.,
1988; Vermeulen et al., 1989; Van Welie et al., 1992).
HEMA has been used as a biomarker of exposure to EO and
other VOCs in animals (Gerin and Tardif, 1986; Gerin et al.,
1988; Tardif et al., 1987) and also in humans (Popp et al.,
1994). We report here the levels of HEMA in a reference
sample of the U.S. adult population, and the relationship of
HEMA levels to tobacco smoke exposure.
Materials and methods
The urine samples analyzed for this study were a subset
selected from those collected during the Third National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III).
NHANES III, designed to examine a representative sample
of the civilian, noninstitutionalized U.S. population, was
conducted from 1988 to 1994 (NCHS, 1994). Participants in
our study were selected to adequately represent persons 20
to 49 and 50 to 59 years of age, both sexes, and urban and
rural residences. We used a cutoff of 100,000 inhabitants per
county to distinguish between rural and urban areas. The
demographic characteristics of the participants in this study
are summarized in Table 1. The study was approved by the
National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) Institutional
Review Board.
HEMA was measured using isotope-dilution high
performance liquid chromatography-atmospheric pressure
chemical ionization-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-
APCI-MS/MS) (Barr and Ashley, 1998). Briefly, the
method involves the use of a solid-phase extraction cleanup
step, followed by the analysis of HEMA by HPLC-APCI-
MS/MS; with this method, specific fragment ions of HEMA
and its deuterated internal standard analog are monitored for
quantification and confirmation. The limit of detection
(LOD) for HEMA in a 1-ml urine sample is 0.68 g/l.
All the NHANES III samples, including those used for
this study, were stored at À708C until the time of analysis.
Before analysis, samples were left to thaw overnight at 58C.
After analysis, the samples were stored at À708C. No
chemical degradation of HEMA was detected in the quality
control samples and standards used for this study under
these storage conditions.
For the participants in this study, blood benzene, styrene,
and toluene concentrations were measured by isotope-
dilution purge-and-trap high-resolution mass spectrometry
(Ashley et al., 1992), and have been reported elsewhere
(Ashley et al., 1994). Likewise, serum cotinine has been
measured previously by isotope-dilution HPLC-APCI-MS/
MS (Bernert et al., 1997) for these participants, and the data
were reported elsewhere (Pirkle et al., 1996).
Statistical analyses of the data were performed using the
Statistical Analysis System (SAS Institute, Cary, NC)
software. For univariate analysis, we calculated geometric
mean values of HEMA by smoking status (based on serum
cotinine levels, see below), gender, age, urban/rural
residence, and demographic group. The variance of the
HEMA concentration (dependent variable) was analyzed as
a function of gender, age, urban/rural residence, blood
benzene levels, blood styrene levels, blood toluene levels,
serum cotinine levels, and smoking status (independent

variables) by using a general linear model procedure (i.e.,
PROC GLM). A P-value less than 0.05 was considered
significant. HEMA levels less than the LOD were assigned
a concentration of half the LOD for the analyses before
corrections were made for creatinine concentrations.
Although we report the results both as creatinine-
corrected and uncorrected HEMA concentrations, we will
focus our discussion of the statistical analyses on the
creatinine-corrected HEMA concentrations, because in
studies involving measurements of `spot' urine samples, it
is generally helpful to adjust for urine dilution to allow for
comparison of urinary measurements. Creatinine measure-
ments are commonly used to `correct' for dilution. Because
the log-transformed HEMA concentrations were more
normally distributed, we used them in the univariate and
regression analyses based on a linear regression model (i.e.,
PROC REG).
Results
Tables 2, 3, 4, and 5 report the results of the analyses for
HEMA in urine samples from 412 adults living in the U.S.
Tables 2±5 report the number of adults (N), the frequency of
detection, the geometric mean HEMA concentration, and
the HEMA concentrations at the 5th, 50th (median), and
95th percentiles in micrograms per liter. Tables 2±5 also
report the creatinine-corrected geometric mean HEMA
concentrations and the creatinine-corrected HEMA concen-
trations at each percentile in micrograms per gram of
creatinine (g/g creatinine). The creatinine-corrected
HEMA concentrations are given only for those urine
samples with creatinine values greater than or equal to 30
mg/dl. Those with values lower than 30 mg/dl are generally
considered to be too dilute to provide results that can be
validly interpreted (Lauwerys and Hoet, 1993). Table 2
summarizes the results of the analysis of HEMA for all 412
samples, and Table 3 shows the results of the analysis of
HEMA for the eight demographic subsets of our reference
population group. Table 4 summarizes the measurements of
HEMA by gender, age, and urban/rural residence; and
Table 5 shows the results of the analysis of HEMA by
smoking status. Serum cotinine concentrations were used to
distinguish between smokers (>10 g/l) and nonsmokers

( 10 g/l) (Pirkle et al., 1996). Cotinine, a metabolite of
nicotine, has been extensively used as a biomarker for
smoking (Pirkle et al., 1996; Bernert et al., 1997).
HEMA was found at detectable concentrations in 71% of
the samples examined (Table 2). We assessed the influence
of urban/rural residence, gender, and age on HEMA levels.
The creatinine-corrected geometric mean HEMA concen-
trations are higher, but not statistically higher, among
individuals residing in urban areas than among residents in
rural areas (Table 4). Likewise, the creatinine-corrected
geometric mean HEMA concentrations were higher, but not
statistically higher, for persons !50 years old than for
persons <50. Finally, the creatinine-corrected geometric
mean concentration of HEMA in urine was statistically
higher among women than among men (P= 0.0086).
We also assessed the effect of smoking on HEMA
levels and found that the creatinine-corrected geometric
mean HEMA concentrations were significantly higher
(P= 0.0001) among smokers than among nonsmokers
(Table 5). The median HEMA concentrations and creati-
nine-corrected median HEMA concentrations were also
substantially higher among smokers than among nonsmo-
kers (Table 5).
It has been shown that smoking increases the blood levels
of VOCs such as benzene, styrene, and toluene (Ashley et
al., 1995). We conducted a linear regression analysis of the
correlation between the concentration of HEMA and the
blood concentrations of benzene, styrene, and toluene. In all
cases, the analysis did not show any significant relationship
(P > 0.05) between these VOCs and HEMA (data not
shown).
Results of multiple regression analyses of the relation-
ship between HEMA levels and age, gender, residence,
smoking status, and urinary creatinine levels are shown in
Table 6. As expected, HEMA levels were higher in
concentrated urine than in diluted urine. Females had
slightly higher levels than males. Persons living in urban
areas had higher levels than persons residing in rural areas,
and smokers had higher levels than nonsmokers. Age was
not a statistically significant predictor of HEMA levels.
Discussion
Reference range concentrations for environmental toxicants
or their biomarkers provide information about the magni-
tude of exposure to these toxicants in the general population

(Pirkle et al., 1995; Needham et al., 1996). This information
may be used in studies of risk exposure assessments, in
monitoring trends of exposure involving exposed popula-
tions, and for other public health efforts, such as studies of
long-term effects on exposed populations. In this study, we
have measured urinary concentrations of HEMA, a
biomarker for exposure to several hazardous VOCs
(Vermeulen et al., 1989), to obtain information about
background exposure to the HEMA parent compounds
among a sample of the U.S. population. The detection of
HEMA in about three-quarters of our reference population
suggests that the general population is frequently exposed to
one or more of the HEMA parent compounds. The high
frequency of HEMA detection also reflects the high
sensitivity of our analytical method (Barr and Ashley,
1998) and demonstrates its value for future studies assessing
environmental exposure to HEMA parent compounds.
The fact, that the creatinine-corrected geometric mean
HEMA concentrations were statistically higher among
women than among men in our study population, suggests
an association between HEMA levels and gender. This was
an interesting finding since we did not expect exposure to
the toxicants that metabolize into HEMA to be gender-
dependent in our reference population. The formation of
mercapturic acids as a mechanism of detoxification for
electrophilic toxicants has been well characterized (Hinch-
man and Ballatori, 1994; Lash, 1994), but the underlying
mechanisms of the observed differences between HEMA
levels among men and women remain unknown. We
speculate that these differences may be due to gender-
related variations in the metabolism of HEMA.
We also analyzed HEMA levels by urban/rural residence
because of the potential for increased exposure to HEMA
parent compounds in industrialized or polluted urban areas.
Although we observed higher creatinine-corrected geo-
metric mean HEMA concentrations in urban areas than in
rural areas, these differences were not statistically signifi-
cant in the bivariate analysis. Similarly, age-related
differences in creatinine-corrected geometric mean HEMA
concentrations were not statistically significant.
We observed a strong association between smoking and
elevated mean HEMA levels (Figure 1). The mean HEMA
concentrations were statistically higher among smokers than
among nonsmokers regardless of the manner in which the
analyses of the data were performed (i.e., log-transformed
vs. log-untransformed). Moreover, in each segment of our
reference population grouped by either age, gender, or
urban/rural residence, the highest concentrations of HEMA
were always found in smokers. The elevated mean HEMA
level among smokers is most likely due to direct exposure to
tobacco smoke, which is known to contain several HEMA
parent compounds (e.g., VC, EO, ACN) (Hoffmann and
Hoffmann, 1997; Hoffmann et al., 1976). Thus, smoking
status should be taken into consideration in future studies
involving exposure to HEMA parent compounds from other
sources.
Because smoking elevates the blood levels of the VOCs
benzene, toluene, and styrene (Ashley et al., 1995), and we
have shown that it also increases the levels of HEMA, we
analyzed the correlation between HEMA and VOCs
concentrations. Likewise, because smoking also increases
the levels of serum cotinine, we examined the correlation
between HEMA and serum cotinine levels. Our findings,
that HEMA and tobacco-related VOC levels, and HEMA
and serum cotinine levels did not correlate, suggest that
although tobacco smoke is a common source for HEMA,
VOCs, and cotinine, exposure to sources other than tobacco
smoke also contributes to the presence of HEMA in urine.
About 6% of the nonsmokers (15 individuals) had
HEMA concentrations that were above the mean for
Figure 1. Distribution of HEMA levels in the urine of the reference
population by smoking status.

smokers. We believe that these elevated HEMA levels may
be related to an acute exposure to any of the HEMA parent
compounds (e.g., PVC from a new automobile). Other
explanations, such as exposure to environmental tobacco
smoke (ETS), are also a possibility. However, when we
compared the serum cotinine values for these nonsmokers
with reported (Pirkle et al., 1996) serum cotinine values
associated with ETS exposure, we found a poor correlation
between the two. Thus, we doubt that ETS exposure was a
main contributor to the elevated HEMA levels in this group
of nonsmokers. Similarly, in another study, ETS did not
correlate with high blood levels of tobacco-related VOCs
(e.g., benzene, styrene, and toluene) found among a group
of nonsmokers (Ashley et al., 1995).
In summary, we have reported the first population-based
reference range study for HEMA. These data provide
information about background exposure of the general
population to several hazardous VOCs. Both the analytical
method used for this study and these reference range data
will be useful for the investigation of human exposure to
HEMA parent compounds. We have also identified smoking
as a significant source of exposure to HEMA parent
compounds.
