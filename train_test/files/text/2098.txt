Purpose: Despite the high rates of drug selling among youth in juvenile justice and youth
residing in disadvantage neighborhoods, relatively little is known about the patterns of illicit
drug selling among youth in the general population.
Methods: Using the public-use data file from the adolescent sample (N = 17 842) in the
2008 National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH), this study employed multiple logis-
tic regression to compare the behavioral, parental involvement, and prevention experiences of
youth who sold and did not sell illicit drugs in the past year.
Results: Findings from a series of logistic regression models indicated youth who sold drugs
were far more likely to use a wide variety of drugs and engage in delinquent acts. Drug-selling
youth were significantly less likely to report having a parent involved in their life and have
someone to talk to about serious problems but were more likely to report exposure to drug
prevention programming.
Conclusion: Selling of drugs by youth appears to be a byproduct of substance abuse and
deviance proneness, and the prevention programs these youth experience are likely a result of
mandated exposure derived from contact with the criminal justice system. Assuming no major
drug supply side reductions, policies, and practices associated with increasing drug abuse
treatment, parental involvement and supervision, and school engagement are suggested.

Introduction
The participation of youth in illicit drug selling is a serious public health concern.
Research suggests that adolescent participation in drug dealing has increased over
the last several decades.1 Prior studies have found correlations between illicit drug
selling and high levels of substance use,2,3 violence,4,5 gang participation,6 and other
forms of delinquency.4,7,8 As such, large numbers of youth who come in contact with
the juvenile justice system have a history of illicit drug selling.1,8­10
Research on adolescent drug selling in urban, disadvantaged areas, including youth
living in public housing, reveals that between 6% and 20% had sold drugs at some
point.2­4,7,11,12 The concern with respect to this relatively high prevalence is fueled by
the combustive relationship between drug selling and a range of problematic behaviors.
For example, studies have found an association between drug dealing and cigarette,
alcohol, and illicit drug use.2,3,5,12
A number of studies have also found strong associations between drug sell-
ing and participation in violence and delinquency.5,7,9,11 In an effort to clarify the

relations between drug selling and drug use, Altschuler and

Brounstein7 compared the following four groups from their
sample of young people in schools and community centers:
(1) drug users and sellers, (2) drug sellers who do not use,
(3) drug users who do not sell, and (4) youth who take part in
neither activity. Results showed that youth in the drug users
and sellers group were the most delinquent, and drug sellers
that did not use drugs were more delinquent than the other two
groups. Fagan and Chin5 found that levels of violence were
intimately tied to the type of drug being sold. Of course, urban
rates of violence in the 1980s and early 1990s were directly
tied to the crack cocaine market. The dynamic relationship
between selling illicit drugs (especially crack cocaine)
and handguns as a driver of violence is consistent with the
drug­gun diffusion hypothesis.13 Although the directionality
with respect to causation among these factors is not firmly
established, and is likely to be complex and conditional, drug
selling is part and parcel of a nexus of dangerous and costly
behaviors. In a way, drug selling serves as a sort of vector
for a wide swath of risky behaviors.
Current study purpose
Despite the high rates of drug selling among youth in juvenile
justice and youth residing in disadvantage neighborhoods,
relatively little is known about the patterns of illicit drug
selling in the general population. In particular, little is known
about how youth who sell drugs differ from those who do
not sell drugs. Knowledge of these patterns can provide a
deeper understanding of the association between illicit drug
selling and the extent to which these youth are embedded in
substance abuse, are involved with their families, and have
encounters with prevention programming. The inclusion of
family variables is important because bonds and connections
to adults have shown to be a form of social control via behav-
ioral monitoring, and breakdowns increase the likelihood of
problem behavior such as drug selling.14,15 In the present study
we sought to extend previous research by answering several
questions. For example, how much more likely are youth who
sell drugs likely to use drugs compared with youth who do
not sell drugs?To what extent are youth who sell drugs likely
to have a parent involved in their lives and in what aspects?
Do youth who sell drugs encounter or participate in youth
activities or prevention-related programming? National stud-
ies have not established the extent to which these factors are
correlated with drug selling among youth. This is important
to do so, because developing prevention or policy efforts
without knowing the magnitude of these correlates in national
samples render these efforts less efficient. The goal of this
study is to answer the aforementioned research questions and
contribute to the empirical foundation that informs preven-
tion strategies aimed toward reducing drug selling among
adolescents in the USA.
Methods
Sample and procedures
This study is based on data from the NSDUH.16 NSDUH is
designed to provide population estimates of substance use
and health-related behaviors in the US general population.
It utilizes multistage area probability sampling methods to
select a representative sample of the US civilian, noninstitu-
tionalized population aged 12 years or older for participation
in the study. Multistage sampling designs are commonly used
designs when attempting to provide nationally representative
estimates.This is because interviewing all participants is not
feasible, so larger units are the first stage selected from, with
subsequent levels of strata partitioned until individuals from
households are selected. With respect to the NSDUH, all
50 states and the District of Columbia were employed.Within
this state-level stage one sample, secondary sampling units
(stage two) were based on regions within large states com-
posed of 48 regions and remaining states parsed in 12 regions.
Census tracts within these secondary sampling regions
were then used from which to select household or dwelling
units and individuals. Study participants include household
residents (residents of shelters, rooming houses, and group
homes), residents of Alaska and Hawaii, and civilians resid-
ing on military bases. To improve the precision of drug-use
estimates for subgroups, adolescents aged 12­17 years and
young adults aged 18­25 years were oversampled.
NSDUH study participants were interviewed in private
at their places of residence. Potential participants were
assured that their names would not be recorded and that their
responses would be kept strictly confidential. Participants
were paid US$30 for their participation.All field interviewers
signed a confidentiality agreement, and the procedures and
protections were carefully explained to potential participants
in the informed consent protocol. The NSDUH interview
utilizes a computer-assisted interviewing (CAI) methodol-
ogy to increase the likelihood of valid respondent reports of
illicit drug-use behaviors.16 The CAI methodology includes
a combination of computer-assisted personal interview-
ing (CAPI) and audio computer-assisted self-interviewing
(ACASI) methodologies. ACASI is designed to provide the
respondent with a highly private and confidential means of
responding to questions and is used for questions of a sensi-
tive nature (eg, substance use). Respondents read questions

on the computer screen or questions were read to respondents
through headphones, and then respondents entered their
responses directly into the computer.
A total of 68 736 respondents aged 12 years or older
completed the 2008 survey. Weighted response rates were
89% for household screening and 74.4% for interviewing.16
Each independent, cross-sectional NSDUH sample was
considered representative of the US general population
aged 12 years or older. NSDUH design and data collection
procedures have been reported in detail elsewhere.16 The
current study restricted analyses to the adolescents aged
12­17 years (N = 17 842).
Measures
Drug selling
Adolescents who sold illicit drugs (N = 599) were identi-
fied based on whether they responded affirmatively to the
question "During the past 12 months, how many times have
you sold illegal drugs?" Drug sellers were coded as 1 (yes)
or 0 (no).
Behavioral variables
A host of risk variables including substance use and

delinquent behaviors was used. Substance use variables
assessed were self-reported past-year use of alcohol and illicit
drugs (marijuana, inhalants, hallucinogens, cocaine/crack
cocaine, heroin). These were dichotomously measured as
use and nonuse. Delinquent variables were self-reported as:
past-year stealing an item worth 50 dollars or more, attacking
someone with the intent to injure, arguing or fighting with
a parent, serious fighting at school or work, and carrying
a handgun. These were also measured dichotomously (ie,
yes or no). Two dichotomously coded items were used to
assess risk propensity including: "How often do you get a
real kick out of doing things that are a little dangerous?" and
"How often do you like to test yourself by doing something
a little risky?"
Sociodemographic and mental health covariates
The following demographic variables were used: age,
gender, race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic
black, Hispanic, and other [American Indian orAlaska Native,
Asian, other Pacific Islander or Native Hawaiian, and persons
reporting more than one race]), school status (in school versus
not in school), having a father in the home or not, ever jailed or
incarcerated, total annual family income (less than US$20 000,
US$20 000­$49 999, US$50 000­$74 999, and US$75 000 or
more), and metropolitan population density (nonmetropolitan
area, large metropolitan area $1 million, small metropolitan
area ,1 million). Family income was ascertained by asking
respondents: "Of these income groups, which category best
represents your total combined family income during the pre-
vious calendar year?" Proxy responses were accepted from a
household member identified as being better able to give the
correct information about family income for adolescents who
were unable to respond to the income question. Additionally,
we also examined lifetime history of depression and anxiety.
This was based on whether the respondents were told by a
doctor or other medical professional if they had either of
these disorders.
Parental involvement covariates
Due to the importance of monitoring, supervision, and con-
nectedness for youth, several family involvement variables
were included. Seven items (0 = no, 1 = yes) were used to
assess various forms of parental involvement. Sample items
included: "During the past 12 months, how often did your
parents provide help with your homework when you needed
it?"; "During the past 12 months, how often did your parents
limit the amount of time you went out with friends on school
nights?"; and "During the past 12 months, how often did
your parents tell you they were proud of you for something
you had done?"
Youth experience covariates
We identified a number of variables that reflected contact
with prosocial activities and formal programming. Seven
items (0 = no, 1 = yes) were used to assess experiences that
youth had with prevention programming both in and out of
school. Sample items included: "During the past 12 months,
have you participated in a violence prevention program
where you learn ways to avoid fights and control anger?";
"
During the past 12 months, have you participated in an
alcohol, tobacco, or drug prevention program outside of
school where you learn about the dangers of using and how
to resist using, alcohol, tobacco, or drugs?"; and "During the
past 12 months, in how many different kinds of school-based
activities, such as team sports, cheerleading, choir, band,
student 
government, or clubs, have you participated?"
Statistical analysis
Weighted prevalence estimates and standard errors were com-
puted using Stata 10SE (StataCorp LP, College Station,TX).
This system implements aTaylor series linearization to adjust
standard errors of estimates for complex survey sampling
design effects including clustered data. A series of multiple

logistic regression analyses was conducted to first assess the
associations between demographic and behavioral variables
and drug selling. Next, we examined the associations between
prior youth experiences, including contact with prevention
programming, and illicit drug selling. Finally, we assessed the
correlates of indicators of parental supervision and involve-
ment on drug selling. Final adjusted models controlled for the
effects of age, race/ethnicity, gender, family income, lifetime
anxiety and depression, and lifetime drug use.Adjusted odds
ratios (AORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) are pre-
sented to reflect association strength.AORs were considered
statistically significant only if associated confidence intervals
did not include the value 1.0.
Results
Sociodemographic and behavioral
correlates of drug selling
Table 1 shows the sociodemographic and behavioral
characteristics of youth who have and have not reported
selling drugs in the past year. Adolescents reporting a his-
tory of drug selling were more likely to be male (odds ratio
[OR] = 2.23, 95% CI = 1.72­2.89), not have a father in the
home (OR = 1.49, 95% CI = 1.15­1.92), and to have been
incarcerated (OR = 5.61, 95% CI = 4.22­7.45). There were
no significant differences found with respect to race/ethnicity
and school dropout.
With respect to behavioral correlates, numerous vari-
ables were found to have large effects. Youth who reported
carrying a handgun (OR = 16.11, 95% CI = 11.85­21.90),
having stolen items worth US$50 or more (OR = 17.40,
95% CI = 13.13­23.06), attacking someone (OR = 8.24,
95% CI = 6.22­10.92), arguing/fighting with a parent
(OR = 2.81, 95% CI = 2.18­3.62), and serious fighting at
school (OR = 4.11, 95% CI = 3.18­5.30) had increased odds
of selling drugs. Lifetime use of illicit substances was also
strongly associated with drug selling, including marijuana
(OR = 31.99, 95% CI = 22.21­46.07), ecstasy (OR = 20.32,
95% CI = 14.05­29.39), hallucinogens (OR = 26.96, 95%
CI = 19.44­37.40), cocaine/crack cocaine (OR = 31.99,
95% CI = 22.21­46.07), and heroin (OR = 19.38, 95%
CI = 8.39­44.24). Age of first drug use (marijuana) also
was associated with increased probability of drug selling.
Two items reflecting risk propensity (sometimes/always),
including "getting a kick out of doing things" (OR = 11.26,
95% CI = 7.57­16.75) and "liking to do risky things"
(OR = 7.88, 95% CI = 5.48­11.35) increased odds of

selling drugs. Finally, lifetime depression (OR = 3.67, 95%
CI = 2.45­5.49), but not anxiety, incremented the probability
of selling drugs.
To what extent are youth who sell illicit
drugs less likely to have a parent involved
in their lives and in what aspects?
Table 2 compares the prevalence of various forms of parental
involvement and supervision for adolescents reporting and
not reporting illicit drug selling. Results of AORs indicate
that most forms of parental involvement and supervision
were uniformly and significantly associated with a reduced
likelihood of selling drugs. The strongest correlates were
found for adolescents who reported that parents telling them
they had done a good job in the past year (OR = 0.50, 95%
CI = 0.37­0.67), parents checking to see if they had done their
homework in the past year (OR = 0.55, 95% CI = 0.42­0.73),
and parents mentioning they were proud of them (OR = 0.58,
95% CI = 0.43­0.78). Parents helping with homework and
limiting the amount of television and time out on school
nights also were significantly associated with reduced drug
selling. Having a parent who talked with youth about the
danger of tobacco/alcohol/drugs was not significantly associ-
ated with reduced likelihood of selling drugs.
Do youth who sell drugs participate
in drug and/or violence prevention
programs?
Table 3 examines various prevention experiences among
adolescents reporting past-year drug selling compared
with youth who did not report selling drugs. AORs reveal
that adolescents who sell drugs were less likely to have
someone to talk with about serious problems (OR = 0.41,
95% CI = 0.23­0.71). However, adolescents who reported
selling drugs were more likely to participate in drug pre-
vention programming outside of school (OR = 1.52, 95%
CI = 1.02­2.26) and a program to help reduce their drug
abuse (OR = 2.41, 95% CI = 1.52­3.82).
Discussion
In the present study we sought to elucidate the pat-
terns and correlates of drug selling and answer three key
research questions. The first question, with respect to
substance use among drug-selling youth, reveals that these
youth were far more likely to use a wide variety of drugs
than non-drug-selling youth. Although not surprising,

these associations were so strong that selling drugs can be
regarded as part and parcel of substance abuse. Youth who
reported drug use in the past year were also at increased odds
of being involved in a wide swath of delinquent behaviors
and have a history of incarceration.
Thesecondresearchquestion,pertainingtofamilyinvolve-
ment and supervision, showed a strong pattern of inverse cor-
relation. These associations were robust and uniform.
Third, and perhaps most interesting, are the study results
related to exposure to prevention programming. Drug-selling
youth were substantially less likely to report having someone
in their lives to talk to about serious problems. However,
drug-selling youth were more likely to have participated
in drug prevention programming outside of school and a
program to help with drug abuse. Although a seemingly
paradoxical finding, it is more likely that youth who have

used and sold drugs, have been in trouble, and have had
contact with the criminal justice system have been exposed
to these sorts of mandated programming.This is further cor-
roborated by the finding that drug-selling youth were also
less likely to have been exposed to drug education while
in school. However, the duration and quality of the role of
these types of youth experiences is unknown and requires
further research. Although little research has accrued on
court-mandated interventions for youth, initial research
indicates that the use of evidence-based treatments in these
contexts can reduce substance-related problems.17 Several
quantitative reviews have shown that interventions such as
multidimensional family therapy can effectively reduce drug
use in court-referred youth.18,19
Although findings from the present study are nation-
ally representative, they do converge with results from
previous nonrepresentative studies with respect to drug
selling in relation to alcohol and illicit drug use,3­5,12 and
correlations between drug selling and participation in vio-
lence and delinquency.7,9,11 While the present study found
powerful associations between drug use and drug selling
there is no data in the NSDUH available to disentangle
this relationship. However, recent research by Shook et al20
found that 69% of the youthful offenders who sold drugs
reported that they kept more than half of the drugs they
purchased for their own use and 57% reported that they
worked alone in their drug-selling activities. Importantly,
findings from this study suggest that many of these youth
who sell drugs are not merely engaged in an economic
activity, or part of a broader drug trafficking enterprise,
but their engagement in drug selling is tied, at least in
part, to their drug use.
Although youth who engage in a wide variety of prob-
lem behaviors such as drug selling are in need of positive
redirection, this task is not as simple as surrounding them in
extant services. These youth typically present with difficult
temperaments, impulsivity, may have parents who are them-
selves antisocial, and reside in difficult surroundings where
desperation and urgency are common. Although findings
from this study reaffirm that effective parenting, communica-
tion, and parental supervision can attenuate the relationships
among drug selling, drug usage, and related problem behav-
iors, implementing these practices is no small task. Many
of these youth are in families experiencing daily struggles
related to employment, but also the parents

risk, rejected by prosocial peers, and developing deviant peer
affiliations is not easy.
The sheer volume of illicit substances in circulation
tempers optimism regarding the reduction in drug selling
by youth. Absent major supply-side reductions, there are
still reasonable strategies that potentially may be helpful.
In particular, treatment for adolescent substance abusers
appears sensible given the high rates of drug misuse among
youth who sell drugs.21 Certainly, this assumes a willing-
ness to enter treatment or that coerced treatment would be
effective. Finding innovative ways to target youth, who are
the most severe substance abusers and the most violent, is
important.
Study limitations
Results from the current study should be interpreted within
the context of several limitations. First, the assessment of
selling drugs was based on one item and did not capture
the frequency and extent of drug selling or the specific
reasons for doing so. Although it was a single item,
convergent relations with substance use and risk-taking
supported its validity. Second, causal determinations
cannot be made with respect to the associations identified
due to the cross-sectional study design. Another limita-
tion is that the NSDUH relies on respondent recall and
is therefore subject to the usual under- or over-reporting
inherent in such assessments. Although the NSDUH is a
nationally representative sample and its scope is perhaps
unsurpassed, the survey does not include important con-
textual, situational, and precipitating information, which
is necessary for a fuller illumination of the drug-selling
phenomenon.
Despite these limitations, results do provide useful
insights into the relations among drug selling, behavioral
risk, parental involvement, and prevention programming
among youth in the USA.
