Readiness of Primary Care Practices for Medical
Home Certification
WHAT'S KNOWN ON THIS SUBJECT: Practice characteristics, such
as practice size, have been associated with the readiness of adult
primary care practices for medical home certification. Little is
known about how ready primary care practices for children are
for medical home certification.
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: Primary care practices for children
attained only 38% of the infrastructure required for medical home
certification. Smaller practice size was significantly associated
with lower infrastructure scores. Medical home programs need
effective approaches to support practices with limited resources.
abstract
OBJECTIVES: To assess the prevalence of medical home infrastruc-
ture among primary care practices for children and identify practice
characteristics associated with medical home infrastructure.
METHODS: Cross-sectional analysis of restricted data files from 2007
and 2008 of the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey. We mapped
survey items to the 2011 National Committee on Quality Assurance's
Patient-Centered Medical home standards. Points were awarded for
each "passed" element based on National Committee for Quality
Assurance scoring, and we then calculated the percentage of the total
possible points met for each practice. We used multivariate linear
regression to assess associations between practice characteristics
and the percentage of medical home infrastructure points attained.
RESULTS: On average, pediatric practices attained 38% (95% confi-
dence interval 34%­41%) of medical home infrastructure points,
and family/general practices attained 36% (95% confidence interval
33%­38%). Practices scored higher on medical home elements
related to direct patient care (eg, providing comprehensive health
assessments) and lower in areas highly dependent on health
information technology (eg, computerized prescriptions, test ordering,
laboratory result viewing, or quality of care measurement and
reporting). In multivariate analyses, smaller practice size was
significantly associated with lower infrastructure scores. Practice
ownership, urban versus rural location, and proportion of visits
covered by public insurers were not consistently associated with a
practice's infrastructure score.
CONCLUSIONS: Medical home programs need effective approaches to
support practice transformation in the small practices that provide the
vast majority of the primary care for children in the United States.

ARTICLE
The medical home has become the
central model in efforts to transform
primarycarepracticetoimprovehealth
care delivery, enhance patient experi-
ence, and control costs.1­4 To partici-
pate in medical home programs and
qualify for additional reimbursement
from insurers, primary care practices
are typically required to go through
a certification process.5­8 The National
Committee for Quality Assurance's
(NCQA) Patient-Centered Medical Home
(PCMH) program is one of the most
common medical home certification
programs and measures practices on
27 specific elements grouped into 6
standards.5 In the 2011 NCQA PCMH
standards, practices are scored on
a 100-point scale with 35 as a minimum
level for certification.5 Many medical
home programs base payments on
whethera practice meets the minimum
requirement,4 and some programs
have increasing payments for higher
certification scores.9
The services and infrastructure re-
quired for medical home certification
are resource-intensive to implement
and maintain,10,11 raising the possibility
that primary care practices with lim-
ited resources will be at a disadvan-
tage for medical home certification
and be ineligible for additional re-
imbursement that could be used to
improve care. Studies in adult primary
care suggest that smaller and in-
dependent practices are less likely to
have the infrastructure needed for
medical home certification.12­16 Pri-
mary care practices that serve chil-
dren may be at an added disadvantage
for medical home certification because
of the high proportion of children en-
rolled in Medicaid,17 which pays sig-
nificantly less than other insurers,
potentially limiting practices' resour-
ces to implement the services and in-
frastructure needed for medical home
certification.18 Little is known about the
readiness formedical homecertification
in primary care practices serving chil-
dren, however.
This study was designed to address
the following questions: (1) to what
degree do primary care practices for
children have the infrastructure re-
quired for medical home certification;
and (2) are practice characteristics
associated with a practice's medical
home infrastructure. Based on the
adult literature,12­16 we hypothesized
that smaller and physician-owned pri-
mary care practices would be less
ready for medical home certification
compared with larger and health-
system­owned practices. We also hy-
pothesized that primary care practices
with a higher proportion of patient
visits from publicly insured children
would be less ready for medical home
certification.
METHODS
Sample
We used restricted data files from the
2007 and 2008 National Ambulatory
Medical Care Survey (NAMCS), an an-
nual multistage probability sample of
outpatient visits to randomly selected,
non­federally employed, office-based
physicians in the United States.19 Be-
cause physicians are one of the sam-
pling stages for the survey, results can
be used to produce national estimates
of physician-reported practice charac-
teristics using published methods.20
For this study, we were interested in
primary care practices for children.
Therefore, we included physicians with
reported specialties of pediatrics,
family practice, and general practice.
We excluded physicians from pediatric
subspecialties and sports medicine.
There was insufficient sample size to
includeadolescentmedicineorinternal
medicine/pediatrics. We restricted the
analyses to physicians with at least 5%
of their visits involving individuals ,19
years old.
Data Collection
During the physician sampling stage of
NAMCS, an induction interview was
performed with the physicians that
included questions about a variety of
physician and practice characteristics.
For confidentiality reasons, many of
these physician and practice charac-
teristics are not included in the NAMCS
public data files, but they are available
in restricted data files available from
the Research Data Center of the Na-
tional Center for Health Statistics.21
Measuring Medical Home
Infrastructure
As in a previous study,16 we measured
medical home infrastructure by map-
ping practice characteristics reported
by physicians in NAMCS to the NCQA
PCMH certification standards. For this
study, we used the 2011 NCQA PCMH
standards.5 NCQA assigns a point value
to each of the elements in the PCMH
standards for a total possible score of
100. We were able to map items from
NAMCS to each of the 6 NCQA PCMH
standards and represent 56 of the
NCQA points, including (1) enhance
access and continuity (12 points); (2)
identify and manage patient pop-
ulations (16 points); (3) plan and
manage care (3 points); (4) provide
self-care support and community
resources (6 points); (5) track and co-
ordinate care (6 points); and (6) mea-
sure and improve performance (13
points) (Table 1).
To generate the medical home in-
frastructure score, we first determined
the presence of practice character-
istics mapped to the NCQA standards
and assigned points to the practice
based on the NCQA scoring system.5 We
then generated a cumulative point total
for the practice by summing the points
across all practice characteristics that
were present. For practices with com-
plete data, the maximum point total
was 56, and for practices with missing

data, the maximum point total was
based on nonmissing data. The medical
home infrastructure score for each
practice was then calculated by di-
viding the total points for the practice
by the maximum possible points. The
medical home infrastructure score
represents the percentage of measur-
able NCQA medical home elements
present in the practice. It is important
to note that the NCQA standards in-
clude 6 "must-pass" elements that are
required for certification, regardless
of overall score (Table 1). We were able
to map NAMCS items to only 3 of the 6
must-pass elements and chose to
score them in the same manner as
other elements.
Practice Characteristics
Severalpracticecharacteristicsthatwe
hypothesized to be associated with
medical home infrastructure were
identifiable in NAMCS, including prac-
tice size, practice ownership, urban
versus rural location, and the pro-
portion of visits covered by public
payers (Medicaid and the State Child-
ren's Health Insurance Program
[SCHIP]). Practice size was categorized
based on the number of physicians in
the practice: solo/2 physicians, small
(3­5 physicians), medium (6­10), or
large ($11).20 Practice ownership was
categorized as physician or physician
group, community health center, or
health system. Health systems included
health maintenance organizations, ac-
ademic medical centers, hospitals, and
other health care corporations. Urban
versus rural location was categorized
in NAMCS based on the zip code of the
practice. The proportion of visits cov-
ered by public payers was determined
by the percentage of visits for individ-
uals ,19 years old with expected
payment from Medicaid or SCHIP dur-
ing the NAMCS sampling period for that
physician.
Statistical Analyses
We generated nationally representative
practice-level estimates by deriving
a medical practice estimator by using
methodology suggested by the National
Center for Health Statistics.20 This ap-
proach allowed us to make practices,
rather than physicians, our unit of
analysis. We corrected the SEs of our
estimates to account for the complex
survey design, including the use of
survey weights and stratification. We
then assessed bivariate and multivar-
iate associations between practice
characteristics and the medical home
infrastructure score by using linear
regression.
We used Stata 11.0 (Stata Corp, College
Station, TX) for all statistical analyses
with appropriate adjustments for the
complex survey design. The University of
MichiganHealthSciencesandBehavioral
Sciences Institutional Review Board
determined that this study was exempt
from oversight.
RESULTS
Characteristics of Primary Care
Practices for Children in the United
States
The final sample included 222 primary
care pediatric practices, representing
.12 000 practices nationally, and 398
family and general practices, repre-
senting .20 000 practices nationally
(Table 2). Most visits for children oc-
curred in pediatric practices (78%
[95% confidence interval (CI) 74%­
82%]) versus family and general prac-
tices. In pediatric practices, nearly all
visits in pediatric practices were for
children ,19 years old (98% [95% CI
96%­99%]), whereas children accoun-
ted for a much smaller percentage of
visits in family/general practices (15%

physician group (Table 2). Most pedi-
atric practices were in large metro-
politan areas, whereas most family and
general practices were outside large
metropolitan areas. Pediatric practices
had higher proportions of visits for
children that were expected to be paid
for by Medicaid or SCHIP compared
with family and general practices, but

all types had no visits for children
covered by Medicaid or SCHIP (20%
[95% CI 12%­30%] for pediatrics and

Elements of Medical Home
Infrastructure
Of the 6 NCQA PCMH standards, most
primarycarepracticesforchildrenmet
NAMCS items mapped to the NCQA
standards for enhanced access and
continuity, and providing self-care sup-
portandcommunityresources(Table1).
In terms of enhanced access, more
than half of all practices offered ad-
vice by telephone and used other
providers during visits, such as regis-
tered nurses, physician assistants, and
nurse practitioners. In most pediatric
practices, patients could be seen
during the evening or on weekends;
these services were available in only
a minority of family/general practi-
ces. Very few practices offered advice
throughelectronic communication, such
as e-mail. In the standard for providing
self-care support, nearly all practices
reported providing health education to
patients at visits.
In contrast, fewer than half of primary
care practices met NAMCS items in the
NCQA standards for planning and
managing care, tracking and co-
ordinating care, and measuring and
improving performance (Table 1). Low
scores in these standards were largely
a result of few practices reporting
computerized systems that facilitated
patient management tasks, such as
writing prescriptions, test ordering,
viewing laboratory results, or mea-
suring and reporting quality of care.
Results in the NCQA standard for iden-
tifying and managing patient pop-
ulations were more mixed (Table 1). A
significant majority of practices
reported a computerized system with
patient demographic information, but
fewer than half of practices had sys-
tems that included problem lists or
prompts for guideline-based screening
or interventions. In this standard,
results were also mixed for services
that could be considered part of a com-
prehensive health assessment, such as
screening and education about nu-
trition, development, or tobacco use/
exposure.
Medical Home Infrastructure Score
On average, pediatric practices met
38% (95% CI 34%­41%) of the possible
medical home infrastructure points,
and family and general practices met
36% (95% CI 33%­38%) of the possible
points. In bivariate analyses, medical
home infrastructure score was signif-
icantly associated with practice size for
both pediatric and family/general
practices, with smaller practices hav-
ing lower scores (Table 3). The medical
home infrastructure score was not
associated with practice ownership,
urban versus rural location, or pro-
portion of visits covered by Medicaid/
SCHIP for either type of primary care
practices for children.
In multivariate analyses, practice size
was independently associated with the

practice's medical home infrastructure
score (Table 4). Compared with solo/2-
partner pediatric practices, medium
and large pediatric practices had sig-
nificantly higher medical home in-
frastructure scores (10% and 14%
higher on the 100-point scale, re-
spectively). The association between
practice size and the medical home
infrastructure score was similar for
family and general practices. Location
in a nonmetropolitan (rural) area was
associated with lower medical home
infrastructure scores for pediatric
practices but not for family and gen-
eral practices (Table 4). There was no
significant difference in the medical
home infrastructure score between
practices with a high proportion of
visits covered by Medicaid/SCHIP and
practices with no visits covered by
Medicaid/SCHIP (Table 4). Practices
with a medium proportion of visits
covered by Medicaid and SCHIP had
significantly higher medical home in-
frastructure scores compared with
practices with no visits covered by
Medicaid/SCHIP. There were no signifi-
cant associations between practice
ownership and the medical home in-
frastructure score.
DISCUSSION
In this nationally representative study
of primary care practices for children,
practices generally score low on an
overall measure of medical home in-
frastructure, averaging ,40% of in-
cluded medical home elements. With
a minimum threshold of 35 for medical
home certification in the NCQA pro-
gram,5 a significant proportion of
practices would not qualify for the
lowest level of certification. We found
that smaller primary care practices
were at a distinct disadvantage for
overall medical home infrastructure.
Our results are similar to those for
adult primary care practices,12­16 but
to our knowledge, this is the first study

to assess the medical home in-
frastructure in a nationally represen-
tative sample of primary care practices
serving children.
These findings add to a growing body of
literaturethatsuggestthatpracticesize
is a key factor in practices having the
infrastructure required for medical
home certification.12­16 This presents
a significant challenge for medical
home implementation in primary care
practices for children, because our
results suggest that at least two-thirds
of these practices are solo or 2-partner
models. Implementation of medical
home processes is time and resource
intensive for primary care practices,11,23
and it has been postulated that
practices with higher levels of organi-
zational reserve, or "slack," are more
likely to be successful at medical home
implementation.24 Larger practices
may be more likely to be able to real-
locate physicians and staff time away
from direct patient care to implement
new systems of care. Larger practices
may also be more likely to have the
financial resources to invest in health
information technology,12,13 which is
a core aspect of medical home certi-
fication, particularly in the NCQA
program.25 In this study, 25 of the 56
NCQA points we assessed were de-
pendent on health information tech-
nology, and this may be a rate-limiting
factor for many small, independent
practices.
The resources needed for medical
home certification raises questions
about the degree to which individual
primarycarepracticescanbeexpected
to implement these services and in-
frastructure on their own. Fortunately,
this issue has been increasingly rec-
ognized by policy makers involved in
primary care transformation. The
Health Information and Technology for
Economic and Clinical Health portion
of the American Recovery and Rein-
vestment Act of 2009 included billions
of dollars in incentives for providers to
adopt electronic health records and
funded regional extension centers to
support clinical practices in adopt-
ing these systems.26 In addition to
supporting electronic health record
adoption, it has been proposed that
these extension centers could be lev-
eraged to provide primary care prac-
tices with support for adopting other
components of the medical home.26­28
In response to the drive toward more
integrated care through accountable
care organizations, larger health sys-
tems are again aggressively buying
out primary care practices, and these
large health systems may provide
small primary care practices with the
infrastructure needed for medical
home implementation.29 In parallel,
many state and private payers have
developed initiatives to encourage
and support small practices in shar-
ing the resources necessary for
medical home implementation while
maintaining their organizational in-
dependence.28,30
Our findings also suggest that pediatric
practicesinthemostruralsettingsmay
also be at a disadvantage in medical
home certification, regardless of size.
Although they are a small group, these
practices could represent another im-
portant target for policies supporting
primary care transformation. Inte-
restingly, family and general practices
in rural settings scored equal to their
urban counterparts. It is possible that
family practices in rural settings may
have relatively more financial resour-
ces compared with rural pediatric
practices because of higher reim-
bursement through Medicare for adult
patients compared with Medicaid for
pediatric patients.18
Concernshavebeenraisedthatpractices
that serve low-income populations may
be at a disadvantage for medical home
certification, although the only study
specifically examining this issue found
that safety-net practices may be at a rel-
ative advantage.31 In our results, it was
encouraging to find that a higher pro-
portion of practice visits covered by
Medicaid/SCHIP was not associated with
lower medical home infrastructure
scores and was actually associated
with higher infrastructure scores for
pediatric practices with moderate lev-
els of Medicaid/SCHIP visits.
The overall low scores are concerning
for many practices'ability to effectively
and efficiently care for children and
youth with special health care needs.
Few practices reported computerized
systems that facilitate the prospective
care, such as reminders for routine
tests and preventive care, or tracking
and follow-up of test results and im-
aging that are particularly important
for high-needs populations. Although it
is possible to have such systems and
qualify for NCQA certification without
an electronic health record, health in-
formation technology can help stan-
dardize and automate these processes
of care that are critical for children and
youth with special health care needs
and facilitate medical home certifica-
tion for practices.
The results of our study should be
viewed in the context of several limi-
tations. First, the medical home in-
frastructure score we used is based on
the NCQA PCMH certification program,
while there are now a wide variety of
other certification programs spon-
soredbynot-for-profitorganizations,6­8
private payers,32 and state agencies.30
Additionally, the NCQA PCMH standards
have been criticized for relying too
heavily on process measures, particu-
larly health information technology,
while relatively neglecting other as-
pects of the medical home model, such
as interpersonal communication and
patient experience, and patient out-
comes.33,34 However, the NCQA medical
home certification process is currently
the most widely used standard in
480 ZICKAFOOSE et al
medical home programs, and it largely
resembles other medical home certi-
fication standards.4,34 Second, we were
able to assess only approximately half
of the points in the NCQA PCMH stand-
ards (56 of 100) and only 3 out of 6
must-pass elements. However, a sensi-
tivity analysis in a previous study using
the same methodology suggested that
the trends found would be consistent
even with the inclusion of the other
NCQA PCMH elements.16 Third, the
mapping of NAMCS items to NCQA
PCMH elements was indirect for sev-
eral items. In the previous study using
this methodology, exclusion of in-
directly mapped items did not sub-
stantially change results,16 and in the
absence of other nationally represen-
tative data sets directly measuring
medical home infrastructure in pri-
mary care practices for children,
NAMCS represents the best available
option. Fourth, the variable available to
categorize practice ownership did not
allow us to differentiate between small
practices that were owned by large
physician groups versus small in-
dependent practices. Last, these data
are from 2007 and 2008; it is unclear
whether the various policies and pro-
grams promoting the medical home in
the past 5 years are likely to increase
or close the gaps in medical home in-
frastructure between primary care
practices.
CONCLUSIONS
Primary care practices for children are
generally ready for the lowest levels of
medical home certification, but very few
had higher levels of medical home in-
frastructure. Small primary care prac-
ticesthatservechildrenaresignificantly
less likely to be prepared for medical
home certification. If the goal is to
transformallprimarycarepracticesinto
medicalhomes,medicalhomeprograms
will need to move beyond the vanguard
practices that have been part of initial
efforts and find effective approaches to
support practice transformation in the
small practices that compose the vast
majority of the primary care system for
children in the United States.

COACHES FOR FIRE: My daughter recently finished her high school soccer career.
At the end of the season I congratulated her coach on another successful cam-
paign and asked about his plans for next year. He told me that he had been
coaching the team for more than 25 years, but had no plans to retire or change
positions. This seemed such a remarkable difference from the coaching carousel
that occurs in Division I schools, particularly in football programs. While high
school sports and Division I football are entirely different entities, in either
program deciding when to replace a coach (and at what cost) is not easy.
However, in Division I football, universities quite frequently replace coaches at
a fantastic cost. As reported in The New York Times (Sports: November 28, 2012),
over the past decade approximately 10% of major college football programs
replaced their coaches each year for performance-related reasons. Sometimes
the cost associated with firing coaches seems unbelievable. One university must
pay the fired coaching staff 11 million dollars and another almost 9 million
dollars over the next several years. For one of the coaches, that amounts to more
than $200,000 a month for three years to sit in the stands rather than coach from
the sidelines. Surprisingly, little data exists to support such practices. A recently
published study examined the performance of major college football teams in the
five years following a coaching change and compared it to the performance of
teams with similar records at the onset who had not changed coaches. Overall,
for teams with losing records, changing or retaining coaches had little impact;
for teams that had won about half their games, teams that changed coaches had
worse outcomes. Why the results are not better is unknown, but it could be that
teams need time to adjust to new systems and develop new recruiting networks.
As for universities, football is often a window to their school, and individual
examples of success do abound, so they are willing to invest heavily in college
coaches who can potentially bring immediate success and recognition to the
school. With the average salary of a head coach at a major college program now
at approximately $1.6 million dollars a year, the investment is quite large indeed.
Personally, I am not a huge fan of the increasingly higher salaries being paid now
to college, let along professional coaches and managers, and relish the idea that
the CVU high school coach will return for his 26th year because he is invested in
his players and the game of soccer.
