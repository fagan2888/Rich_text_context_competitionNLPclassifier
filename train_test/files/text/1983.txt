OBJECTIVEdTo test the association of family history of diabetes with the adoption of di-
abetes risk­reducing behaviors and whether this association is strengthened by physician advice
or commonly known factors associated with diabetes risk.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODSdWe used cross-sectional data from the 2005­
2008 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) to examine the effects of
family history of diabetes on the adoption of selected risk-reducing behaviors in 8,598 adults
(aged $20 years) without diabetes. We used multiple logistic regression to model three risk
reduction behaviors (controlling or losing weight, increasing physical activity, and reducing the
amount of dietary fat or calories) with family history of diabetes.
RESULTSdOverall, 36.2% of U.S. adults without diabetes had a family history of diabetes.
Among them, ~39.8% reported receiving advice from a physician during the past year regarding
any of the three selected behaviors compared with 29.2% of participants with no family history
(P , 0.01). In univariate analysis, adults with a family history of diabetes were more likely to
perform these risk-reducing behaviors compared with adults without a family history. Physician
advice was strongly associated with each of the behavioral changes (P , 0.01), and this did not
differ by family history of diabetes.
CONCLUSIONSdFamilial risk for diabetes and physician advice both independently
influence the adoption of diabetes risk­reducing behaviors. However, fewer than half of par-
ticipants with familial risk reported receiving physician advice for adopting these behaviors.
Diabetes Care 34:2393­2399, 2011
The Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC) recently reported
that 25.8 million people in the U.S.
(8.3% of the population) have diabetes
(1). A total of 1.9 million new cases of
diabetes were diagnosed in people aged
$20 years in 2010 in the U.S., and 25.6
million (11.3%) people in this age-group
have diabetes. Worldwide, it is estimated
that 280 million people had diabetes in
2010da number that is projected to in-
crease to 430 million by 2030 (2). Studies
have reported strong and consistent evi-
dence that lifestyle factors might prevent
or delay type 2 diabetes among people at
high risk, including those with a family his-
tory of the disease (3,4). In 2002, the World
Health Report (5) identified risk-reducing
behaviors (such as controlling or losing
weight, increasing physical activity, and
reducing fat or calories) as important life-
style risk factors for a number of chronic
diseases, including diabetes, cardiovascu-
lar disease, and cancer.
Many variables, including genetic,
environmental, medical, and socioeco-
nomic factors, influence the development
of diabetes (6). The association of family
history of diabetes with risk for the dis-
ease has been well documented (7).
Although a 2009 National Institutes of
Health State of the Science conference
concluded that there was insufficient evi-
dence to support the routine use of family
history as a screening tool for risk of com-
mon complex conditions in primary care
(8), an individual patient's family history
remains a critical element in risk assess-
ment for many chronic conditions, in-
cluding diabetes (9). While accurate and
complete family history information needs
to be collected to identify high-risk individ-
uals, substantial barriers exist to obtaining
this information in primary care practice,
though cliniciansare trained todo so.These
barriers include lack of time to collect the
information, lack of proper training to in-
terpret the information, and lack of reim-
bursement (10).
Evidence also supports the effective-
ness of physician advice on lifestyle mod-
ifications to prevent or delay the risk of
chronic diseases (11). A recent study on di-
abetes risk reduction behaviors found that
the proportion of adults with prediabetes
who reported performing risk reduction
behaviors was higher among those who re-
ceived physician advice compared with
those who did not receive such advice (12).
In light of the evidence summarized
above, we used data from the 2005­2008
National Health and Nutrition Examina-
tion Survey(NHANES),a large population-
based and nationally representative
survey of the U.S., to test the hypotheses
that a family history of diabetes is associ-
ated with greater adoption of diabetes
risk­reducing behaviors and that the asso-
ciation is strengthened by the receipt of
physician advice regarding these behaviors,
in addition to other commonly known fac-
tors associated with diabetes risk.

for Health Statistics of the CDC (13). The
survey is designed to provide national sta-
tisticsonthehealthandnutritionalstatus of
the civilian, noninstitutionalized popula-
tion of the U.S. This current study includes
behavioral, environmental, and clinical in-
formation available from the 2005­2006
and 2007­2008 NHANES surveys. Details
of the surveys are available online (13). We
restricted our analyses to adults (aged $20
years; n = 10,549) and then excluded those
whowerepregnant(n = 393) and those who
had diagnosed or undiagnosed diabetes
(n = 1,558 [definition below]). This resulted
in a sample of 8,598 adults, among whom
3,205 had afamilyhistory ofdiabetes,5,203
had no family history of diabetes, and 190
were missing information on family history.
Definition of diabetes
Participants with self-reported diabetes
(those who acknowledged being told by a
physician that they have diabetes) or par-
ticipants with HbA1c
levels $6.5% (14)
were defined as diabetic and excluded
from all analyses.
Definition of family history of
diabetes
We classified all participants without di-
abetes into two distinct groups based on
their self-reported family history (FHx) of
diabetes:1)FHx+,$1biologicalfirst-degree
relative (parents or siblings) with diabetes
and 2) FHx2, no first-degree relatives
with diabetes.
Definition of outcomes and
covariates
We assessed three risk reduction behaviors
from the NHANES diabetes questionnaire
file. All participants were asked whether
they are now 1) controlling their weight or
losing weight, 2) increasing their physical
activity or exercise, or 3) reducing the
amount of fat or calories in their diet. Par-
ticipants were also asked whether they had
been told by a physician or health profes-
sional in the past 12 months to perform
each of these behaviors.
Demographic factors included in the
analyses were sex, age (#45 or .45
years), race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic white,
non-Hispanic black, Mexican American,
other), and education (either less than
high school or greater than or equal to
high school). Clinical factors were obtained
from medical examination and laboratory
data. BMI was dichotomized as $25 or
,25 kg/m2. Participants with systolic
blood pressure $140 mmHg or diastolic
blood pressure $90 mmHg or currently
taking antihypertension medication were
defined as hypertensive. Participants with
serum total cholesterol $240mg/dL orcur-
rently taking cholesterol-lowering medica-
tion were defined as hypercholesterolemic.
Statistical analyses
We used multiple logistic regression to
model the likelihood of adopting three
diabetes risk­reducing behaviors among
adults without diabetes according to the
presence of a family history of diabetes
(yes or no). Predicted margins and 95%
CIs were estimated for the differences
across groups (15). The level of statistical
significance was set at 0.05. All models in-
cluded NHANES sample weights for the
variables included in the model (sex, age,
race/ethnicity, education, BMI, hyperten-
sion, hypercholesterolemia, and physician
advice). We tested interactions between
family history and commonly known fac-
tors associated with diabetes risk, including
physician advice, to further examine
whether the adoption of each of the three
behaviors varied by family history of diabe-
tes and whether the included participants
received physician advice on these behav-
iors. We used x2 statistics based on the log
odds ratio to determine the significance of
the selected characteristics of the partici-
pants by family history of diabetes. We
used the Satterthwaite-adjusted F statistic
to account for the unequal selection prob-
abilities and nonresponse rates within
NHANES. Statistical analyses were con-
ducted using SAS-callable SUDAAN 10.0
(Research Triangle Institute).

teristics of the included NHANES partic-
ipants are presented in Table 1. Overall,

Familial risk, diabetes risk­reducing behaviors
age-group or hypercholesterolemia status.
Among FHx+ adults, ~39.8% reported re-
ceiving advice from a physician (or other
health professional) during the past year
regarding at least one of the three selected
behavioral changes compared with 29.2%
of FHx2 adults (P , 0.01 [data not
shown]).
Figure 1 displays the unadjusted
prevalence of the three risk reduction be-
haviors among adults without diabetes
who, in the past 12 months, reported per-
forming risk-reducing behaviors (regard-
less of receiving physician advice),
reported receiving physician advice, or re-
ported both receiving physician advice
and performing the behavioral changes.
Compared with FHx2 adults, FHx+
adults were more likely (P , 0.01) to
have controlled or lost weight, increased
exercise, or changed their diet regardless
of physician advice (53.2 vs. 46.5%, 48.5
vs. 44.4%, and 51.9 vs. 44.5%, respec-
tively). For each individual risk reduction
behavior, FHx+ adults were also more
likely (P , 0.01) to have received physician
advice about these behavior changes com-
pared with FHx2 adults (25.2 vs. 17.0%,
32.2 vs. 23.8%, and 28.8 vs. 19.3%, re-
spectively). However, among adults who
received and followed the physician advice,
there were no significant differences
(P$ 0.15)betweenFHx+andFHx2adults
regarding the percentage of individuals
performing each of the three risk-reducing
behaviors (77.2 vs. 80.5%, 67.7 vs.
70.7%, and 78.5 vs. 81.2%, respectively).
In univariate analyses (Supplemen-
tary Table 1), clinical and demographic
variables commonly associated with dia-
betes were strongly associated (P , 0.01)
with reports of engaging in any of the
three risk reduction behaviors, except
for the associations between age and in-
creasing exercise (P = 0.12) and the asso-
ciation between race/ethnicity and
reducing fat or calories in the diet (P =
0.19). When physician advice was given
in the past 12 months, the odds of people
engaging in any of the three activities in-
creased 3.8­6.7 times compared with
participants who were not given advice
(P , 0.01 for each behavior). A family
history of diabetes was also strongly asso-
ciated with each of the behavioral changes
(P , 0.01). This association with family
history remained significant with control-
ling or losing weight after adjusting for
all the selected demographic and clinical
variables (odds ratio 1.13 [95% CI
1.01­1.26], P = 0.03 [data not shown]).
However, the associations of family his-
tory with increasing exercise (1.05 [0.94­
1.18], P = 0.36) and with reducing fat or
calories in the diet (1.13 [0.98­1.31],
P = 0.10) disappeared after multivariate
adjustment (data not shown). In multi-
variate analyses, physician advice was
also strongly associated with each of the
behavioral changes (4.05 [3.24­5.05] for
controlling or losing weight [P , 0.01],
3.39 [2.87­4.01] for increasing exercise
[P , 0.01], and 5.40 [4.68­6.23] for
reducing fat or calories in the diet [P ,
0.01] [data not shown]).
Table 2 displays the adjusted preva-
lence of the selected risk-reducing behav-
iors by family history, regardless of
physician advice. Overall, there were
few significant differences in the perfor-
mance of the selected behaviors across
demographic or clinical variables. Inter-
estingly, FHx+ adults who were not over-
weight were more likely to be engaged in
controlling or losing weight (P , 0.01) or
in changing their diet (P = 0.02) than
FHx2 adults, though the same relation-
ship was not present in overweight adults.
Also, hypertensive FHx2 adults were
more likely to have increased their phys-
ical activity than hypertensive FHx+
adults (P = 0.01). In these multivariable
analyses, physician advice was associated
with a higher prevalence of both FHx+
and FHx2 participants engaging in each
of the three behavior changes compared

Familial risk, diabetes risk­reducing behaviors
with those who had not received physi-
cian advice (Table 2). Overall, physician
advice on each of the three behaviors var-
ied by family history of diabetes (P #
0.05), with FHx2 participants slightly
more likely to perform the risk-reducing
behaviors if they received physician ad-
vice compared with FHx+ participants.
Among adults who received physi-
cian advice, ~70­80% also engaged in
each risk-reducing behavior (Supplemen-
tary Table 2). However, the adoption of
these behaviors after receiving physician
advice was not influenced by any of the
examined clinical or demographic varia-
bles commonly associated with diabetes
when stratified by family history of diabe-
tes (P . 0.05 for each variable). When
examining the participants who did not
receive physician advice (Supplementary
Table 3), fewer than half reported per-
forming these risk-reducing behaviors.
The performance of one or more of the
behaviors in the past year varied by edu-
cational attainment, BMI, and hyper-
tension status among those with and
those without a family history of diabetes
(P , 0.05).
CONCLUSIONSdOur data suggest
that slightly more than one-third of U.S.
adultswithout diabetes had a familyhistory
of diabetes in 2005­2008 but that fewer
than half reported receiving a physician's
or health professional's advice during the
past year about diabetes risk­reducing be-
havioral changes. Although there is sub-
stantial evidence that diabetes can be
prevented by healthy lifestyle changes,
our data show that no more than one-
half of U.S. adults without diabetes repor-
ted trying to perform these risk-reducing
behaviors in the past 12 months. How-
ever, when physician advice was received,
.70% of U.S. adults without diabetes re-
ported following the advice and engaging
in one or more of these behavioral
changes. In contrast, a smaller percentage
of people who did not receive physician
advice acknowledged making these
changes.
Consistent with prior studies (11),
our study confirms independent associa-
tions of physician advice and diabetes risk
factors, including familial risk for diabe-
tes, with diabetes risk­reducing behav-
iors in the general adult U.S. population
without diabetes. However, the effect of
family history of diabetes on risk-reducing
behavior changes was diminished after
accounting for all commonly known asso-
ciated risk factors for diabetes.
Family history is an important risk
factor that reflects inherited genetic sus-
ceptibility, shared environment, and
common behaviors. Valdez et al. (7) re-
ported that approximately one of every
three adults in the U.S. population has a
moderate or high familial risk of diabetes.
People with a family history of diabetes
have been found to have two to six times
higher risk of having type 2 diabetes (16).
Studies have suggested that the use of
family history as a screening tool to detect
diabetes and cardiovascular diseases is an
inexpensive method of extracting geno-
mic information (17). Regardless, a re-
cent study on the impact of a positive
family history and genetic risk variants
on the incidence of diabetes reported a
difference in diabetes incidence accord-
ing to family history in the early years of
intervention but that this difference dis-
appeared upon follow-up (18). Our data
suggest that people with a reported fam-
ily history of diabetes participate more in
risk-reducing behavior changes than
those with no family history (without ac-
counting for all commonly known asso-
ciated risk factors, including the reception
of physician advice). This could be because
FHx+ individuals are more aware of their
risk of diabetes than are FHx2 individuals
(19).
In agreement with other studies (20),
our data suggest a strong effect of physician
advice on the adoption of risk-reducing be-
havioral changes in the previous year,
which varied by demographic characteris-
tics. However, the prevalence of perform-
ing risk-reducing behaviors did not differ
by family history of diabetes for those who
received and followed physician advice on
behavioral changes. Given the high per-
centage of people performing these behav-
iors if in receipt of advice, our data suggest
that this advice was effective but that the
knowledge of a positive family history did
not increase the already high percentage of
people adopting the preventive behaviors.
A prior study on lifestyle modification to
improve blood pressure control in indi-
viduals with diabetes concluded that phy-
sician advice is effective at changing
hypertension-related lifestyle factors
among people with diabetes, regardless
of sex or race/ethnicity (11). Studies also
reported that patients with type 2 diabetes
might visit their family physicians up to
nine times yearly (21), giving physicians
and other health care professionals many
opportunities to assess and to encourage
patients to engage in risk-reducing behav-
iors. In spite of the influence of family
history in risk-reducing behavior changes
and the important role of physician advice
on lifestyle changes, our data suggest that
more than one-half of people at high risk
(i.e., with a positive family history of di-
abetes) had not received physician advice
on lifestyle changes in the past 12 months.
Using our data and data from a recent
CDC diabetes report (1), we estimate
that there are .49 million people aged
$20 years who do not have diabetes but
who are at high risk because of a positive
family history who have not received
physician advice on lifestyle changes or
recommended interventions. These find-
ings indicate a great challenge in diabetes
prevention, particularly for high-risk
individuals.
Previous studies have reported that
numerous factors may influence the rou-
tine provision of physician advice on life-
style changes, for example, lack of time for
counseling, physician training and educa-
tion, limited staff support, reimbursement
for preventive services, knowledge of suc-
cessful strategies, community resources,
limited English proficiency, and perceived
success rate (11). Despite these barriers,
adoption of these risk-reducing behaviors
could be substantially promoted if physi-
cian advice is provided (22). Therefore, as
physicians are increasingly encouraged to
offer preventive care, effective strategies
need to be developed to promote lifestyle
changes and to help physicians overcome
barriers to promoting a healthy lifestyle.
Strengths and limitations
This study has several strengths. First, we
conducted this study using data from a
nationally representative sample of the
U.S. population, making our estimates
generalizable to the entire population
of U.S. adults without diabetes. Second,
NHANES provides substantial data on
biological and lifestyle factors, all of
which were collected using standard labo-
ratory and physical measurements. Fi-
nally, our study includes 4 years of data
and, thus, a large sample size, powering
our statistical ability to detect associa-
tions. However, there are several limita-
tions. First, NHANES is cross-sectional,
so we could not formally assess the tem-
poral relation between physician advice
and family history with behavior changes
or assess these factors in relation to di-
abetes incidence. We were only able to
evaluate how risk-reducing behaviors
associated with family history and how
much of this association is due to physi-
cian advice. We accessed the association

of family history on reports of behavioral
changes for the preceding 12 months.
Nevertheless, it is unclear whether these
lifestyle changes would continue long term.
Second, there may be substantial social de-
sirability bias introduced by self-reported
responses regarding lifestyle changes and
the receipt of physician advice. There are
no separate methods in NHANES to vali-
date self-reported variables, including
family history of diabetes. Third, family
history of diabetes could only be defined
based on first-degree relatives, since infor-
mation for other relatives was not asked in
the 2005­2008 NHANES. As reported in a
previous study (23), differences in the def-
inition of family history between studies
may lead to inconsistent findings. Fourth,
the terms "physician advice" and "physi-
cian counseling" may not be interpreted
consistently (11). Therefore, there should
be some caution when comparing our es-
timates of the effect of physician advice on
the adoption of diabetes risk reduction be-
haviors with the findings of other studies.
In addition, other factors affect the influ-
ence of physician advice, such as the use of
effective counseling techniques, the dura-
tion of counseling, how often patients
have physician visits and get counseled,
and the physician's attitude and percep-
tions (24). These factors were not consid-
ered in the current study. Finally, the
results of this study may be influenced
by the misclassification of diabetes (25).
We did not use measures of fasting plasma
glucose or results from glucose tolerance
tests because these tests were performed
in only a subset of NHANES participants,
which would have largely reduced our sam-
ple size. Therefore, we defined diabetes by
self-report and by using the new HbA1c
cri-
teriarecentlyrecommendedbytheAmerican
Diabetes Association (14).
In conclusion, our data suggest that
family history of diabetes and advice
from a health professional both influence
the adoption of diabetes risk­reducing be-
haviors. Our data also indicated that peo-
ple with family history are more likely to
have a discussion with their doctors on
behavior changes. There is room for im-
provement regarding the proportion of
adults who actually receive such advice.
However, once the advice is provided, fa-
milial risk does not seem to affect the
adoption of these behaviors. It appears
likely that the continued development of
practical methods and effective strategies
to promote behavioral changes is needed
to contain, and perhaps reverse, the mod-
ern epidemic of diabetes.
