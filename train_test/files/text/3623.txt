Institutionalizing Big Data methods
in social and political research
Pertti Ahonen
Abstract
We expect Big Data methods to contribute to research with results that are not inferior to those attained in other ways
but possibly better, or hard or impossible to generate in other ways. Those who apply these methods may also aspire to
augment the arsenal of research methods, offer surrogates for existing research designs, and re-orient research.
Moreover, we can critically examine the institutional, societal and political effects of the Big Data methods and the
conditions for the solid institutionalization of these methods in social and political research. To reach its primary
objective, this article elaborates conclusions on how Big Data methods, not only by means of their `social life' but
also by their `political life', may influence the institutionalization of social and political research. To reach its secondary
objective, the article re-examines a study of budgetary legislation in 13 countries carried out by means of Big Data
methods to draw conclusions concerning the augmentation of the arsenal of research methods, the surrogation of
existing research designs, and the re-orientation of research.

Introduction
We expect Big Data methods to contribute to research
with results that are not inferior to those attained in
other ways but are possibly better, or hard or impos-
sible to generate in other ways. Those who apply these
methods may also aspire to use them to augment the
available arsenal of research methods, offer surrogates
for existing research designs, and re-orient research
(Edwards et al., 2013). Moreover, we can critically
examine the direct and indirect societal and political
effects and conditions of the institutionalization of
Big Data methods (Law and Ruppert, 2013).
The primary objective of this article is to elaborate
conclusions on how Big Data methods, not only by
means of their `social life' (Law and Ruppert, 2013)
but also their `political life' (a notion that will be
explained in the next section), influence the institution-
alization of social research with special reference to pol-
itical research. To support its pursuit of its primary
objective, the article also pursues a secondary objective,
comprised of the re-examination of a study of budget-
ary legislation in 13 countries carried out by means of
Big Data methods. The purpose of this re-examination
is to elaborate conclusions on the augmentation of the
arsenal of research methods, the surrogation of existing
research designs, and the re-orientation of research.
The following two sections elaborate the theoretical
rationale of this article and reproduce the research
hypotheses of the study that the article re-examines.
The subsequent section and Appendix 1 introduce the
Big Data methods and the research material of the re-
examined study. Utilizing the re-examined study as a
context, this article examines in its next two sections
two methods of Big Data analysis, comprising a
method of unsupervised latent trait scaling and a
method of topic modeling. The purpose of the last sec-
tion is to summarize the contributions of this article.

The theoretical rationale of this article
In important respects this article leans on neo-institutional
analysis with no fewer than seven to twelve present-day
orientations (Lowndes and Roberts, 2013; Peters,
2010). Making its pick from among this multitude, the
article follows authors starting from Berger and
Luckmann but principally comprising John W Meyer
and his colleagues and followers (see Powell and
Colyvas, 2008). Berger and Luckmann (1991) under-
stood institutionalization to take place by means of
habituation and resulting taken-for-grantedness (p. 72):
`Institutionalization occurs whenever there is reciprocal
typification of habitualized actions by types of actors.
Put differently, any such typification is an institution.'
This article shares the assumption that not only
human beings but also artifacts and therefore also Big
Data methods and Big Data itself play active roles in
research and other institutionalized action (generally
see, for instance, Cecez-Kecmanovic et al., 2014;
D'Adderio, 2011; Latour, 2005). The article fixes its
attention to institutionalization related to Big Data
methods in an analogous although not identical way
to Law and Ruppert (2013), who elaborate the
examination of the `social life' of methods by means
of characterizing what they call the relevant `patterned
teleological arrangements'. Moreover, this article
agrees with boyd and Crawford (2012) that mytholo-
gies of institutionalization in Big Data contexts need
study, and therefore pays attention to the examination
of `rationalized myths' of Big Data, which rather than
fulfilling common explicit promises to contribute to
rationality support institutional legitimation (Meyer
and Rowan, 1977).
This article not only seeks to examine the habitually
institutionalized social life of Big Data methods but
also the `political life' of disruptions and radical trans-
formations related to these methods. The article shares
the understanding of politics of Pocock (1975: 156) as
the `art of dealing with the contingent event,. . . with
pure, uncontrolled, and unlegitimated contingency',
and also fixes its attention to the role of performativity
(Austin, 1975) that catalyzes the disruptions and trans-
formations indicated. We find analogous arguments on
performativity in political theory (Skinner, 2009), sci-
ence and technology studies (D'Adderio, 2008, 2011;
Latour, 2005), and organization research (D'Adderio,
2014; Deroy and Clegg, 2015; Maguire and Hardy,
2009). The authors indicated locate disruptive, radical
institutional change in situations in which contentious
actors, finding that unprecedented opportunities have
opened up, mobilize performatives by means of which
these actors may successfully de-legitimate the incum-
bent actors and those performatives that have helped
entitle the latter actors to their positions.
The rationale of this article also pushes it to exam-
ine chances to augment the arsenal of existing meth-
ods, offer surrogates for known research designs, and
more generally re-orient research (see Edwards et al.,
2013). A common motivation to use Big Data meth-
ods is to try to reap economies of scale in managing
large datasets, data dredging, and implementing
research designs. Moreover, Big Data methods may
lead researchers to transcend boundaries between
research fields and re-orient research in other ways
(Ruppert, 2013).
The hypotheses proposed in the study
that this article re-examines
Big Data methods can be used either in exploratory
analysis (O'Neil and Schutt, 2013) or explanatory
research, the latter being the case in the study that
this article re-examines. The empirical subject matter of
the study indicated comprised a ubiquitous trite prac-
tice, namely government budgeting. However, the
objectives of the study that this article re-examines
had pushed it away from entrenched research on
budgetary governance (de Haan et al., 2013;
Hallerberg et al., 2007) or adaptations of generic
research on public sector reform adapted to examine
government budgeting (see, for instance, Hyndman
et al., 2013). Instead, the study indicated examined his-
torical legal traditions as possible influences on govern-
ment budgeting.
The study that this article re-examines started with
observations that despite indications that legal trad-
itions are dead (Lindahl and Schadewitz, 2013;
Pargendler, 2012), research acknowledging these trad-
itions continues (Ma, 2012; Painter and Peters, 2010).
Moreover, heterogeneity between national systems of
government budgeting despite decades of global har-
monization called for explanation (International
Monetary Fund (IMF), 2013; Jones et al., 2013;
Lienert, 2013; OECD, 2005; Wanna et al., 2010). The
indicated study proposed hypotheses that legal system
traditions indeed explain differences in government
budgetary legislation according to entrenched histor-
ical, social, cultural, and political divisions in
common law with British origins, Napoleonic civil
law first codified in France, civil law of the German
type, and Nordic law resembling German law in
many respects (Glenn, 2010; Zweigert and Ko
¨ tz,
1998). The study that this article re-examines
approached differences between the legal systems
taking the less common inroad of examining differences
in legal language (Brake and Katzenstein, 2013;
Kischel, 2009).
The first three hypotheses proposed in the study
that this article re-examines were tested by means of a
2 Big Data & Society
Big Data method of unsupervised latent trait scaling.
The first two of these three hypotheses were:
Hypothesis 1: A grand division into common law legal
systems and civil law legal systems explains differences
in government budgetary legislation.
Hypothesis 2: Within countries of civil law traditions,
finer divisions into Napoleonic, German and Nordic
legal systems explain differences in government budget-
ary legislation.
The longer-term harmonization efforts of government
budgeting indicate countries with common law trad-
itions as the foremost present-day global ideal models
(IMF, 2013; Wanna et al., 2010). A third hypothesis
was proposed:
Hypothesis 3: The older the budgetary legislation is in a
civil law country, the wider its differences from budget-
ary legislation in common law countries.
The last two hypotheses of the study that this article re-
examines were tested by means of a Big Data method of
topic modeling. These hypotheses were:
Hypothesis 4: Divisions into legal system traditions
explain divisions into topics in government budgetary
legislation.
Hypothesis 5: Divisions within government budgetary
legislation according to different topics explain differ-
ences in the vocabularies of these topics in the legisla-
tion indicated.
Research methods and the research
material in the study that this article
re-examines
Methods
The foremost methods of the study that this article re-
examines comprised a method of unsupervised latent
trait scaling and a method of topic modeling.
A brief background characterization follows, and
Appendix 1 gives more details.
Latent trait scaling first appeared in social research
of the political science variety in the shape of supervised
latent scaling (Laver et al., 2002), which requires the
researcher first to feed a `seed text' and next utilize
machine learning algorithms to do the scaling. Later,
unsupervised scaling evolved (Proksch and Slapin,
2008), using machine learning algorithms throughout
the research process. First and foremost, both two scal-
ing methods have been applied to examine ideological
polarization in politics by means of using such Big Data
textual materials as parliamentary speeches, political
statements of government ministers, or political party
programs (Lowe and Benoit, 2013).
Topic modeling found its way into social research at
about the same time as unsupervised latent trait scaling
evolved within the political science variety of this research
(Grimmer and Stewart, 2013). Rather than within polit-
ical science research (Clark and Lauderdale, 2010), this
method has found applications in sociological research
(see, for instance, DiMaggio et al., 2013; Fligstein et al.,
2014; Levy and Franklin, 2013).
Research material
The research material in the study that this article
re-examines comprised legislation on federal or
national government budgeting in the stable and
highly developed Western democracies of Australia,
Austria, Canada, Estonia, Finland, France, Iceland,
Italy, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Sweden, Spain,
and the United Kingdom (Table 1). It would have been
both relevant and interesting to examine the United
States, Germany, Switzerland, and Belgium, but these
countries were omitted because of their complex federal
structures. The corpus examined had 13 documents
with a total of 270,000 words.
Most of the materials were derived from a World
Bank (2013) website with legal texts in English or
English translation. Two texts derived were from gov-
ernmental websites, in English translation (Austria,
2013) or in Italian (Italy, 2013), of which the latter
was translated into English. Applying a common and
allowable practice of Big Data research for the UK and
Finland, two separate legal documents were merged
into a single text.
Examining augmentation, surrogation,
and re-orientation in research by means
of Big Data methods
Examining unsupervised latent trait scaling
The method of unsupervised latent trait scaling used in
the study that this article re-examines (for technical
details see Appendix 1) enables delivering estimating
and testing results on what the developers of this
method have named the fixed effects related to individ-
ual words (, theta), the fixed effects related to each
different document included in the data (, alpha), the
word weights (, beta), and the positions taken in the
documents (!, omega). The notion of `fixed effect' is
generic to many varieties of quantitative analysis, indi-
cating that a variable is treated for the technical pur-
poses of quantitative analysis as if it were non-random.
All that is specific to estimating fixed effects by means
Ahonen 3
of latent trait scaling derives from the character of this
method as a Big Data method of textual analysis. The
results obtained by means of using this method are typ-
ically uninteresting as concerns the fixed effects, the cal-
culation of which therefore plays only a subordinate
technical role to enable the calculation of the word
weights and the positions taken in the documents.
Moreover, the calculation of the fixed effects may essen-
tially enhance the possibilities graphically to display the
estimation of the word weights, the positions taken in
the documents, or both the weights and the positions.
Words best discriminating between the documents
examined and therefore between the countries from
which these documents derive situated themselves at
the extreme ends of  values, as is generally expected
in applications of the unsupervised latent trait scaling
method. This pinpoints an asset of this method: it
emphasizes rare as opposed to frequent words discrimi-
nating between text documents. This very characteristic
also eliminates the confounding effects of the different
lengths of the texts examined. However, the assets of
the unsupervised latent trait scaling examined must be
weighed against its less outstanding characteristics,
which included a graphical output plot with no fewer
than 2992 different words according to their weights
(), or far too many either to present meaningfully or
to make subject to a sensible substantive interpretation.
In their turn, the  (alpha) fixed effects, related to docu-
ments and the countries behind these documents, are of
no interest for the model interpretation, but the dimen-
sion they represent usefully takes visually apart the pos-
itions taken in the documents, or the important !
(omega) values (Figure 1).
As proposed in Hypothesis 1 of the study that this
article re-examines, a grand division indeed prevails
between countries with common law traditions and
countries with civil law traditions. Hypothesis 2 could
also be sustained, although the countries examined do
not arrange themselves quite neatly into the
Napoleonic, German, and Nordic variants of civil
law. Certain countries sharing legal system traditions
received resembling ! (omega) values, such as Spain
and Italy, or Sweden and Finland, but there were
exceptions such as Iceland more resembling Spain and
Italy than the two other Nordic countries of Sweden
and Finland. Moreover, Austria, one of the two repre-
sentatives of the German tradition in the analysis,
received a resembling ! (omega) value with Sweden
and Finland. The Netherlands, with its Roman­
Napoleonic­German legal characteristics (Glenn,
2010), comprised a unique case as could be expected.
The fact that budgetary legislation was old at the time
of the investigation both in Estonia and Iceland sug-
gested the acceptance of Hypothesis 3 on differences
between civil law countries with older as opposed to
more recently reformed budgetary legislation.
In the study that this article re-examines, statistical
credibility intervals were calculated for the ! (omega)

values of each document and, indirectly, for the coun-
try which each document represents (Table 2).
According to the results, certain documents and coun-
tries were similar enough to receive overlapping cred-
ibility intervals with the intervals for other documents
and countries. Australia and New Zealand did not
differ statistically from each other, nor did Austria,
Finland and Iceland, or Estonia and Spain. The other
countries, Canada, Italy, France, the Netherlands,
Sweden, and the United Kingdom, were empirically
more unique.
Examining topic modeling
The topic modeling program library used in the study
that this article re-examines would have set no technical
limits to estimating high numbers of topics, but
Hypotheses 4 and 5 and their background argumenta-
tion indicated a maximum of four topics that could
be given a substantive interpretation. However, a
German topic and a Nordic topic did not evolve separ-
ately in the four-topic estimation, although this is
understandable given the closeness of the two civil
law varieties. Only a three-topic solution is presented
(Table 3).
The topic modeling results (Table 3) allowed
Hypothesis 4 to be sustained, revealing three topics: a
joint topic of `German and Nordic law', a topic of
`common law', and a topic of `Napoleonic law'. As is
commonplace in topic modeling, many words appear in
two or all three topics. However, some of these words
only illustrate that the corpus comprised legal texts (for
instance, `law', `must', `shall', and `may'), or indicated
references and cross-references common in legal texts
(for instance, `section', `article', or `paragraph').
Looking at words of substance that characterize cer-
tain topics rather than others, Hypothesis 5 on differ-
ences between the legal vocabularies of different legal
systems could be sustained (Table 3). Words dealing
with the contents of budgeting can be observed in the
first topic of `German and Nordic law', such as
`budget', `finance', `financial', `expenditure' (both in
the singular and the plural), `cash', `assets', and `provi-
sions'. In the `common law', topic words were found to

characterize the institutionalization of budgetary gov-
ernance with special reference to the key actors: `min-
ister', `crown', `corporation', `treasury', `board',
`parliament', `council', and `governor'. Finally, words
characterizing accountability received emphasis on the
third, `Napoleonic' topic: `accounts', `accounting',
`report', and `auditing'. Unfortunately, the relation-
ships between different regimes of budgetary govern-
ance and different textual frames of budgetary
legislation were too under-researched to receive an
elaboration proper in the study that this article re-
examines, and have to await future study.
In the study that this article re-examines, the distri-
bution of the three topics in the documents examined
and, respectively, in the countries that these documents
represent gave further support to Hypothesis 5
(Table 4). In the Austrian document, only the
German-Nordic topic was present. This was almost
the case in the Swedish and Finnish documents,
whereas the weight of this same topic in the Icelandic
document was about two-thirds. In Estonia, despite its
predominantly German legal heritage (Glenn, 2010),
more than two-thirds of the vocabulary examined rep-
resented the `Napoleonic law' topic. Only future studies
can examine the reasons for this aberration.
The countries in which only the second, `com-
mon law' topic was present comprised Canada,
New Zealand, and Australia, and this topic also
predominated in the United Kingdom with a weight
over half of the total. According to the estimation
results, in Spain and Italy only the third, `Napoleonic
law' topic was present. France, in its turn, represented
itself rather as a hybrid between the Napoleonic topic
and the German-Nordic topic, possibly reflecting the
historical influence of German legal traditions in
northern France and the characteristics of the Code

Napoleon as a hybrid between the law of southern
France and northern France (Glenn, 2010).
In documents representing six countries (Australia,
Austria, Canada, Italy, New Zealand, and Spain) only
one topic evolved, which was almost the case in Finland
and Sweden. In Estonia, France, and Iceland a domin-
ant topic and a minor topic could be found, and in the
United Kingdom and the Netherlands the study that
this article re-examines revealed a dominant topic and
two minor topics.
Baseline comparisons concerning the Big Data
methods that this article examines
Baseline comparisons have been carried out before
between traditional methods and the unsupervised scal-
ing method that the study that this article re-examines
utilized (see, for instance, Gru
¨ n and Hornik, 2013;
Lowe and Benoit, 2013). The performative struggles
between researchers using traditional methods (see,
for instance, Biernacki, 2014; Budge, 2013) on the one
hand, and researchers using Big Data methods
(DiMaggio et al., 2013; Laver et al., 2002; Proksch
and Slapin, 2008) on the other, also offer lessons for
baseline comparisons.
The baseline comparisons in this article receive
support from long-time researcher familiarity with
both quantitative research and semiotic and rhetorical
textual analysis. During the preparation of an
international refereed article that went into press in
2014, extending a three-country study (Hyndman
et al., 2013) to cover a fourth country, the laborious
material collection, the tedious and error-prone manual
coding and dissatisfaction with the analysis of word
frequencies made methods of Big Data analysis attract-
ive (for the methods actually chosen, see Appendix 1).
Given this modest baseline, the study that this article
examines, once completed, represented a substantial
improvement.
While preparing the study indicated above, the path
led to the best-evolved Big Data methods to examine
ideological polarization, comprised of methods of
latent trait scaling. An additional interest to learn
what unsupervised rather than supervised scaling
would deliver made the Wordfish program (Proksch
and Slapin, 2009) the choice. The study that this article
re-examines was driven towards topic modeling by two
additional forces. The former of these comprised
researcher familiarity with the classical rhetorical exam-
ination of (Aristotle, 2006) and the resulting curiosity
to learn about the performance of a Big Data method
that steps forward as an inheritor of the classical trad-
ition. The latter driving force was a technical interest in
using two methods of Big Data analysis as baselines in
respect to each other in examining the same research
material.
Conclusions and discussion
Augmentation, surrogation, and re-orientation
of research
From among the two types of Big Data methods that
this article has examined, latent trait scaling has
evolved with the explicit purpose of augmenting
(Edwards et al., 2013) earlier methods. The authors of
both supervised latent trait scaling (Laver et al., 2002)
and unsupervised latent scaling (Proksch and Slapin,
2008) have been critical towards the conventional
methods applied in a minor international research pro-
ject started in the mid-1980s to examine political pref-
erences of parties since 1945 finally in more than 50
countries (MARPOR 2015). Although sensitizing
MARPOR representatives towards vulnerability in
their methods, the altercations have ended in
stalemate (Budge, 2013; Volkens et al., 2013), and com-
parative examinations of the merits of the traditional
and Big Data methods (see, for instance, Lowe and
Benoit, 2013) have failed to resolve the fundamental
disputes.
Big Data methods of topic modeling originate from
within hybrids of computer science and statistics rather
than from within social research. Topic modeling expli-
citly augments traditional latent variable modeling

initiated with Karl R Pearson's principal component
analysis at the beginning of the 20th century and
continued with such methods as LL Thurstone's
factor analysis in the 1930s (Blei, 2014; Grimmer and
Stewart, 2013). However, researchers with classical
humanist inclinations may want to critically consider
how much topic modeling actually augments the
2500-year rhetorical tradition of examining topics or
other procedures of classical humanist textual interpret-
ation (see, for instance, Biernacki, 2014).
The results of this article suggest agreement with
Edwards et al. (2013) that Big Data methods may not
easily provide surrogates for conventional research
designs of social research despite the fact that such
advances are not ruled out (see, for instance, Hale
et al., 2014; Nickerson and Rogers, 2014). In the
study that this article has re-examined, the research
design was cross-sectional and comparative by modest
default rather than by explicit design. A possible future
step forward would lead to longitudinal Big Data
research of texts of budgetary legislation in a number
of countries (for analogous examples of longitudinal
Big Data analysis, see, for instance, DiMaggio et al.,
2013; Grimmer, 2010; Proksch and Slapin, 2008).
Edwards et al. (2013) indicate that the re-orientation
of research by means of Big Data methods may start
from where their mere augmentation of conventional
methods stops. The empirical results on government
budgetary legislation in the study that this article has
re-examined suggest that latent trait scaling has poten-
tial in empirical research over and above the study of
the ideological dimensions of politics (Laver et al.,
2002; Lowe and Benoit, 2013; Proksch and Slapin,
2008). More specifically, in the study indicated, a spe-
cific method of unsupervised latent trait scaling was
used to discern latent traits of legal traditions in gov-
ernment budgetary legislation in 13 countries by means
of examining the texts of this legislation. Big Data
research has been evolving within legal research
proper (see, for instance, Hildebrandt, 2012; Surden,
2014), but the study that this article has examined indi-
cates re-orientation within political science research on
government budgeting and legal policy-making rather
than legal studies.
The foremost contribution of the topic modeling
application in the study that this article has re-
examined was confined to social research of the polit-
ical science variety. This is possibly a contribution in
itself, as topic modeling has been applied within politi-
cal science research comparatively rarely thus far (but,
see, for instance, Clark and Lauderdale, 2010), whereas
it has been substantially more common within socio-
logical research (DiMaggio et al., 2013; Fligstein et al.,
2014; Levy and Franklin, 2013; more generally, see also
Bail, 2014).
The social and political life of Big Data methods
influencing the institutionalization of research
As indicated at the beginning, as its foremost objective
this article examines the `social life' and the `political
life' of Big Data methods as influences on the institu-
tionalization of research. The social structures, the
organization and the identity of Big Data research,
and its researchers within the social and political sci-
ences were still weak rather than entrenched in most
countries and most research fields in the mid-2010s.
At the same time, mainstreaming of Big Data methods
was still advancing within statistics proper rather than
having been fully accomplished (see, for instance,
EMC, 2015). Genuine innovations in social and
political research concerning Big Data methods have
been relatively few thus far although not nonexistent
(see, however, Grimmer and Stewart, 2013; Laver
et al., 2002; Proksch and Slapin, 2008). However, the
Big Data activism of distinguished social and political
scientists (see, for instance, DiMaggio et al., 2013;
Fligstein et al., 2014; Laver et al., 2002) may be chan-
ging the situation.
According to one scenario, social and
political research utilizing Big Data methods will insti-
tutionalize itself, that is, it will become habitual and
taken-for-granted in social and political research.
However, should this institutionalization take place, it
would also generate its `rationalized myths' (Meyer and
Rowan, 1977) with the exaggeration of the merits and
contributions of these methods and formal rather than
substantive commitment to them. We would also
witness not only the enhancement of the rationality of
the core analytic processes of research by means
of the Big Data methods, but also the strengthening
of the external legitimation of institutions of research
by the same means.
For a social researcher in political science, particu-
larly interesting characteristics of the political life of the
Big Data methods include the performative roles that
these methods and their applications may play in
disrupting the achieved institutionalization of research
and, possibly, in catalyzing institutional transform-
ations. This article has indicated two specific
performative struggles. The first one of these struggles
has revolved around a long-term international project
examining ideological political polarization
(MARPOR, 2015), and has been waged between
those who defend traditional methods (Budge, 2013;
Volkens et al., 2013) on the one hand, and those who
apply Big Data methods (Laver et al., 2002; Proksch
and Slapin, 2008) on the other. As indicated above,
proposals of appeasement (Lowe and Benoit, 2013)
have reaped little success so far. The other performative
struggle, which to this date has been milder, has been
8 Big Data & Society
waged between those who apply Big Data methods
including topic modeling (DiMaggio et al., 2013;
Fligstein et al., 2014) on the one hand, and those who
prioritize methods derived from classical humanistic
traditions (Biernacki, 2014) on the other.
In the mid-2010s, time has generally been working to
the advantage of those social and political researchers
who apply or promote Big Data methods, as observa-
tions accumulate that in many countries public sector
and private sector funding authorities have placed
heavy emphasis upon Big Data research projects.
Exhibiting a `vivid awareness of the relationship
between personal experience and the wider society'
better known as `sociological imagination' (Mills,
1959: 3), these developments have lately become
keenly acute not only for numerous global colleagues
but also for the research team from among whose prod-
ucts this article is one. Observations of opportunities
intermingle with experiences of smaller or larger
moments of success in attracting external research
funding and having refereed article manuscripts
accepted in international journals, winning variable
success in mainstreaming Big Data research and related
teaching in academia, and disappointments insofar as
funding applications or article manuscripts receive
rejections. What else do the current characteristics of
the `political life' of Big Data methods and its research-
ers represent than politics in the very sense of Pocock
(1975: 156) as the `art of dealing with the contingent
event. . . with pure, uncontrolled, and unlegitimated
contingency'?

Big Data methods in the study that this article
re-examines
Text pruning. The 13 texts examined were first trans-
formed into a raw text form. Next, the corpus com-
prised of these texts was pruned by means of a text
mining program library included in the R system of
program libraries (Feinerer, 2013), such as eliminating
numbers, punctuation marks, stopwords, and all words
present in only one or two of the 13 texts of the corpus,
leaving 2992 of the original 5351 different words.
Unsupervised latent trait scaling. The unsupervised latent
trait scaling applied a version of the Wordfish program
included in the R library system (Lowe, 2011; Proksch
and Slapin, 2009). Wordfish supports the examination
of word frequencies in texts on the assumption that the
number of times that a word, j, is present in a document
derives from a Poisson distribution. The general form
of the Wordfish model is:
yij $ PoissonðijÞ ð1Þ
ij
¼ exp i
þ j
þ j
x !i
À Á
ð2Þ
In equation (1), yij
is the count of word j in docu-
ment i, and in equation (2),  is the set of fixed effects
related to a document, is the set of fixed effects
related to words,  is the set of estimates of word-spe-
cific weights to capture the importance of each indivi-
dual word in discriminating between positions that the
texts represent, and ! is the set of estimates for the
position that each document represents (for explana-
tions of these notions see the text proper of this article).
In the Wordfish method of unsupervised latent trait
scaling, the estimation and testing of the fixed effects,
 and j,
technically control for the common possibility
that different documents may include some words
rather than others, and that some documents have
more words than others. Moreover, the estimation
results of the fixed effects are instrumental in visually
displaying the results of Wordfish unsupervised latent
trait scaling (see the text proper of this article and, for
an example, see Figure 1). Unsupervised latent trait
scaling first and foremost estimates the s, indicating
the words that differentiate between the positions taken
in the documents examined, and the !s, indicating the
positions of each document derived from the positions
that its constituent words express.
The right-hand side of equation (2) is estimated by
means of an expectation maximization algorithm to
compute maximum likelihood estimates for the latent
variables (Proksch and Slapin, 2009). First, starting
values for , , , and ! are obtained. Second, the
document parameters ! and  are estimated condi-
tional on the expectation for the word parameters
and  by maximizing a log-likelihood function for
each of the documents examined. Third, the word para-
meters and  are estimated conditional on the expec-
tation of the document parameters ! and , obtained in
step 2. For each word, a log-likelihood function is max-
imized. Fourth, the log-likelihood of the model is cal-
culated as the sum of the individual word
log-likelihoods obtained in step 3. Fifth, steps 2­4 are
repeated until the model converges. Last, credibility
intervals are calculated for the scaling estimates of the
s and !s by means of a parametric bootstrap with a
Wordfish default of 500 iterations. As is commonplace
with Big Data methods, the Wordfish latent trait scal-
ing method in some respects utilizes analogous elements
as older statistical methods on the one hand, but adds
certain new elements and procedures on the other let
alone represents a novel combination of its constituent
elements (more generally, see EMC, 2015).
Topic modeling. `Topics', first evolved in classical rhetoric
(Aristotle, 2006), comprise devices that language users
invent or innovatively transfer from other uses to those
of their own to influence the cognitions, emotions, and
perceptions of their audience, including their opponents
(Greer, 2011; Walter and Uhr, 2013). The research
methods of topic modeling support the detection and
interpretation of topics in texts. The study that this
article re-examines applied program scripts of probabil-
istic topic modeling called `latent Dirichlet allocation'
(LDA; Blei et al., 2003).
Applications of LDA discern latent topics that sup-
port the persuasive capacity of texts by means of inclu-
sions and emphases and exclusions and omissions in
these texts. LDA builds on the understanding that the
documents examined comprise mixtures of topics that
regulate the probability that different words find their
way into these documents. The topics and their prob-
ability distributions in documents are understood to
Ahonen 11
comprise hidden random variables, which are built into
a hierarchical probabilistic model, and estimated by
means of approximating the conditional distribution
of these variables in the documents. In the topic mod-
eling program library used in the study that this article
re-examines (Gru
¨ n and Hornik, 2013), this was done by
means of Gibbs sampling and constructing a Markov
chain Monte Carlo algorithm (Blei, 2012). These char-
acteristics comprise another example on how Big Data
methods combine elements of known earlier methods
with newer elements (EMC, 2015).
The examination advanced as follows in the study
that this article re-examines. First, the probability dis-
tribution of words, , was determined for each topic,
assuming a Dirichlet probability distribution, :
 $ Dirichlet 
ð Þ ð3Þ
Second, the topic distribution, , was determined for
each document w, also assuming a Dirichlet distribu-
tion, :
 $ Dirichlet 
ð Þ ð4Þ
Third, for wi
, or each of the N words, each topic, zi
,
was chosen on the assumption of the multinomial dis-
tribution of this topic:
zi $ Multinomial 
ð Þ ð5Þ
Fourth, wi
, each of the N words, was chosen on the
assumption of a multinomial prior distribution of these
words, each of which is conditioned on the topic, zi
:
zi
: pðwijzi
, Þ ð6Þ
After the four steps, the log-likelihood of the
research material, calculated as the sum over the log-
likelihoods of all documents included, was maximized
with respect to the model parameters  and .
However, no mathematical criteria are available to
decide how many topics, k, the researcher should dis-
tinguish, but he or she has to decide the number of
topics based on the study objectives, the background
theory, and the hypotheses proposed. In the study that
this article re-examines, the model was fitted using the
function LDA included in the program library utilized
in the analysis. The fitting required assigning an initial
value to the Dirichlet prior , defining the number of
iterations to reach as stable estimates as possible, and
introducing a random `seed word' with which to start
the estimation to ensure the reproducibility of the
results (Gru
¨ n and Hornik, 2013). Last, a topic model
function called `posterior' was used to obtain the dis-
tribution of words on each topic and the distribution of
topics in each document.
