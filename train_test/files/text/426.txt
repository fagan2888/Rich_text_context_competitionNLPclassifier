Abstract. Kuo H-K, Yen C-J, Bean JF (National
Health Research Institute and National Taiwan
University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan; and Harvard
Medical School and Spaulding Rehabilitation
Hospital, Boston, MA, USA). Levels of
homocysteine are inversely associated with
cardiovascular fitness in women, but not in men:
data from the National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey 1999­2002. J Intern Med
2005; 258: 328­335.
Objectives. Cardiovascular fitness represents the
ability of active skeletal muscle to utilize oxygen
during aerobic exercise. Elevated homocysteine,
causing tissue injury by such mechanisms as
oxidative stress, endothelial damage, and protein
homocysteinylation, is associated with increased
risk of cardiovascular disease, dementia and
osteoporotic fracture. However, the association
between elevated homocysteine and cardiovascular
fitness has not been reported.
Design. Population-based cross-sectional study.
Setting. National Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey from 1999 to 2002 in the USA.
Subjects. A total of 1444 noninstitutionalized adults
aged 20­49 years with reliable measures of
cardiovascular fitness and nonmissing values in
homocysteine.
Main outcome measures. Cardiovascular fitness,
estimated maximal oxygen uptake or VO2
max
(mL kg)1 min)1), was obtained by a submaximal
exercise test. Levels of homocysteine were measured
by the Abbott homocysteine assay, a fully
automated fluorescence polarization immunoassay
method and were natural-log-transformed due to
right skewness.
Results. After adjustment for age, race and body
mass index, there was a 0.70 mL kg)1 min)1
decrease (P ¼ 0.033) in the estimated VO2
max for
each standard deviation (SD) increase in the
natural-log-transformed homocysteine level for
women. Additional adjustment of hypertension,
diabetes, smoking status, alcohol intake, use of
lipid-lowering agents, physical activity, self-report
health condition, as well as levels of folate, vitamin
B12
, creatinine, C-reactive protein, total cholesterol
and haemoglobin seemed to influence the
association. In the fully adjusted model, we
observed a 1.18 mL kg)1 min)1 decrease (P ¼
0.003) in the estimated VO2
max for each SD
increase in the natural-log-transformed
homocysteine level in women. There was no
association between cardiovascular fitness and
homocysteine levels in men.
Conclusion. High homocysteine levels were
inversely associated with cardiovascular fitness in
women, but not in men. The results suggest that
homocysteine levels are important indicators of
exercise tolerance amongst women and may be
useful in targeting female individuals requiring
endurance intervention to prevent loss of
cardiovascular fitness and function.

Introduction
Homocysteine is a sulphur-containing amino acid
derived from the metabolism of methionine. Unfa-
vourable lifestyles, such as smoking, lack of exercise,
excessive alcohol intake, high coffee consumption as
well as nutritional deficiencies in B vitamins are
associated with elevated levels of homocysteine [1,
2]. Abundant data support the notion that elevated
homocysteine is an independent risk factor for
several multi-system diseases [3], including coron-
ary heart disease [4­6], stroke [4, 7], dementia and
Alzheimer's disease [8], as well as osteoporotic
fracture [9, 10].
Evidence suggests that elevated homocysteine
levels may cause toxicity by such mechanisms as
oxidative stress [11] and endothelial damage [11,
12]. Cardiovascular fitness represents an individ-
ual's ability to perform aerobic exercise, that being
the ability of active skeletal muscle to utilize oxygen
during exercise. Cardiovascular fitness is an import-
ant correlate of several clinically important out-
comes, including stroke [13], myocardial infarction
[14], metabolic syndrome [15], or other cardiovas-
cular diseases and risk factors [16­18]. Theoretic-
ally, poor cardiorespiratory capacity can be derived
from pathological changes peripherally affecting the
tissues and the associated vasculature or centrally
perturbing the heart and coronary arteries. These
pathological changes, to some extent, may be
attributed to elevated levels of homocysteine and
the related tissue toxicity.
However, there is no existing data examining the
association between cardiovascular fitness and levels
of homocysteine, not to mention the fact that the
association may be different for both genders.
Therefore, the aim of this cross-sectional study was
to examine the association between homocysteine
and cardiovascular fitness in both men and women
using data from the National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey (NHANES) 1999­2002.
Methods
Study population
The NHANES is a population-based survey designed
to collect information on the health and nutrition of
the US household population. The NHANES used a
stratified and cluster sampling design to obtain a
representative sample of the noninstitutionalized
civilian US population. Beginning in 1999, the
NHANES became a continuous, annual survey
rather than the periodic survey that it had been in
the past. The survey data are released every 2 years.
Detailed survey operation manuals, consent docu-
ments and brochures of the NHANES 1999­2002
are available in the NHANES website [19, 20].
In NHANES 1999­2002, cardiovascular fitness
test was administered to 6687 subjects aged
between 12 and 49 without the following charac-
ters: (i) physical functioning limitations, such as
difficulties in walking/standing, having fractures or
bone/joint injuries, requiring a cane or a wheel-
chair, having amputations of legs or feet, blind,
diabetic retinopathy, loss of balance/consciousness
on a regular basis, and obese (>350 lb); (ii) cardio-
vascular conditions/symptoms, such as congestive
heart failure, coronary heart disease, angina, stroke,
myocardial infarction, pacemaker implantation, self-
reported heart or stroke problems, and resting
tachycardia (>100 min)1) or high blood pressure
(systolic blood pressure >180 mmHg or diastolic
blood pressure >100 mmHg); (iii) pulmonary con-
ditions/symptoms, such as orthopnoea, short of
breath when walking at own pace on level ground,
self-reported lung or breathing problems, emphys-
ema, frequent (>12) or severe (limit speech) attacks
of wheezing during the past 12 months; and (iv)
usage of certain medications including anti-dys-
rhythmics, beta-blocker (including eye drops), cal-
cium channel blockers, digitalis, nitrates, central
nervous system stimulants and ephedra-based
weight loss medications. We excluded 3875 subjects
aged <20 because some confounding variables for
the analysis, such as smoking status and alcohol
intake, were not available.
Amongst those aged 20­49, 2812 subjects were
eligible for cardiovascular fitness test. During the
cardiovascular fitness test, 1310 subjects experi-
enced the following problems which might result in
inaccurate VO2
max estimations (683 subjects) or
even missing values (627 subjects): subjects' refusal
of undergoing or continuing the test (15), technical
problems occurring during the test (707), partici-
pant discomfort or distress, such as chest pain,
dizziness, or development of wheezing, which was
observed by the health technician or reported by the
participant (35), significant haemodynamic chan-
ges, such as exercise blood pressure >260 systolic

and/or 115 mmHg diastolic, or significant drop
(>20 mmHg) in systolic blood pressure during
exercise, arising during the test and resulting in
safety concerns (513), not able to calculate VO2
max
because heart rate obtained at the end of stage 2 of
treadmill test was lower than that at the end of stage
1, or the heart rate difference between stages 1 and
2 was 5 min)1 or less (15), or other reasons not
specified (25). These subjects were excluded in order
to have reliable data on estimated VO2
max in the
analysis. The subjects excluded from the analysis
(1310) were more likely to have higher body mass
indexes (BMIs) and more likely to be male (57.2% vs.
49.3%) and non-Hispanic black (21.5% vs. 16.4%).
Amongst the 1502 subjects with reliable meas-
ures of estimated VO2
max, 58 subjects were further
excluded because of missing values in homocysteine
examination. Therefore, the final analytic sample
was confined to 1444 subjects aged 20­49 with
reliable estimated VO2
max and nonmissing values
in the measurements of homocysteine.
Measurement of cardiovascular fitness
Cardiovascular fitness can be measured via an
exercise tolerance test in which inspired oxygen
and expired carbon dioxide are directly measured
during testing. More commonly, in clinical settings
including the NHANES protocol, inspired and expired
gases are not measured, but cardiovascular fitness is
evaluated through surrogate measures including
observation of heart rate and perceived exertion.
Based on age, gender, BMI, and self-reported level
of physical activity, participants were assigned to
one of eight treadmill test protocols. Each protocol
includes a 2-min warm-up, two 3-min exercise
stages, and a 2-min cool down period. The goal of
each protocol is to elicit a submaximal exercise effect
with heart rate that is approximately 75% of the
age-predicted maximum (220 minus age) by the end
of the test. By monitoring heart rate response to
each of the 3-min stages, maximal oxygen uptake
(VO2
max) can be estimated by using measured
cardiovascular responses to known levels of exercise
workloads, assuming the relationship between heart
rate and oxygen consumption is linear during
exercise [21].
The estimated VO2
max is the main outcome of
cardiovascular fitness in the NHANES. The estimated
VO2
max was further categorized to three cardiovas-
cular fitness levels: i.e. low, moderate and high, based
on gender-age specific cut-off points of estimated
VO2
max. The reference cut-off points used for adults
aged 20­49 years are based on data from the
Aerobics Center Longitudinal Study (ACLS) [16,
21]. Low level of cardiovascular fitness was defined
as an estimated VO2
max below the 20th percentile of
the ACLS data of the same gender and age group;
moderate cardiovascular fitness was defined as a
value between the 20th and 59th percentile, and
high cardiovascular fitness level was defined as at or
above the 60th percentile. The reference ranges for
VO2
max are summarized in the Table 1.
Measurement of homocysteine
Blood specimens were collected at mobile examina-
tion centres and were frozen before analysis. Plasma
homocysteine was measured by the Abbott homo-
cysteine assay (Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL,
USA), a fully automated fluorescence polarization
immunoassay (FPIA) method. Plasma total homo-
cysteine concentrations were calculated by the
Abbott IMx Immunoassay Analyzer using a
machine-stored calibration curve. The FPIA method,
used by the NHANES as a primary tool to determine
homocysteine levels, was fully equivalent to other
frequently used method such as high performance
liquid chromatography [22].

*The reference cut-off points of fitness levels used for adults aged
20­49 years are based on data from the ACLS: low level of
physical fitness was defined as an estimated VO2
max below the
20th percentile of the ACLS data of the same gender and age
group; moderate fitness as a value between the 20th and the 59th
percentile; and high fitness level as at or above the 60th per-
centile.

Covariates
Age, gender, race/ethnicity and smoking status were
obtained from self-report. Diabetes was defined by
self-report of a doctor's diagnosis, the presence of a
plasma glucose level >200 mg dL)1 or the use of
diabetic medications (including insulin injection
and/or oral hypoglycaemic agents). The presence
of hypertension was defined by self-report of a
doctor's diagnosis, the use of anti-hypertensive
medications or averaged blood pressure >140/
90 mmHg. The use of lipid-lowering medications
was obtained by self-report. BMI was calculated as
weight in kilograms divided by the square of height
in metres. Self-reported general health condition was
ascertained by the questionnaire `How would you
say your health in general is?' and was categorized
to excellent, very good, good, fair, or poor. Average
levels of physical activity were obtained by self-
report and categorized into the following categories:
sitting during the day and not walking about very
much; standing or walking about a lot during the
day, but not having to carry or lift things very often;
lifting light loads or having to climb stairs or hills
often; and doing heavy work or carrying heavy
loads. Alcohol intake was determined by the ques-
tionnaire `In any one year, have you had at least 12
drinks of any type of alcohol beverage?' and was
dichotomized. Nutritional markers including serum
vitamin B12
and folate levels were measured by
using the Bio-Rad Laboratories (Hercules, CA, USA)
`Quantaphase II Folate/vitamin B12
' radioassay kit.
Given that C-reactive protein (CRP) has been shown
to be associated with cardiovascular fitness [23­25],
CRP level was adjusted as a covariate and was
quantified by utilizing latex-enhanced nephelometry
with a Behring Nephelometer Analyzer System
(Dade Behring, Deerfield, IL, USA). Total cholesterol
levels, haemoglobin levels as well as serum creati-
nine were also obtained.
Analysis
The distributions of plasma levels of homocysteine in
both men and women were positively skewed.
Therefore, we used natural-log-transformed values,
which provided the best-fitting model for analysis in
which the homocysteine levels were treated as a
continuous variable. For men, standard deviation
(SD) scores of homocysteine were obtained from the
formula Xi
) Xm
/SD, where Xi
is the natural-log-
transformed homocysteine levels in the individual
male subject, Xm
the mean natural-log-transformed
homocysteine level in the male subjects, and SD the
standard deviation of the natural-log-transformed
homocysteine level in the male subjects. The SD
scores of homocysteine in women were obtained
from the same formula. This calculation allowed us
to determine the changes in the cardiovascular
fitness for each increment of 1 SD in the natural-log-
transformed homocysteine levels. The association
between homocysteine and cardiovascular fitness
was also evaluated with a quartile-based analysis.
Multiple linear regression was used to examine the
relationship of homocysteine levels with estimated
VO2
max. We used an extended-model approach for
covariates adjustments: model 1 ¼ age, race,
and BMI; model 2 ¼ model 1 + chronic diseases
(hypertension and diabetes) + health behaviours
(smoking, alcohol consumption and physical activ-
ity) + self-report health condition + use of lipid-
lowering agents; whilst model 3 ¼ model 2 + levels
of folate, vitamin B12
, creatinine, CRP, total choles-
terol and haemoglobin.
We also re-assessed the association between
plasma homocysteine levels and odds of low cardio-
vascular fitness by using multiple logistic regression.
Given the fact that the NHANES population weights
are only applicable to analyses that use the entire
population and we limited our analyses to a special
subset of subjects, we did not use the NHANES
1999­2002 population weights for the purposes of
this study. Data management and analysis were
performed using STATA 8.0 software (STATA Cor-
poration, College Station, TX, USA).
Results
Baseline characteristics
Table 2 lists the characteristics of the participants
according to sex. The mean age amongst the 714
men was 33.1 years, and amongst the 730
women it was 33.5 years. Men smoked more than
women and consumed more alcohol. Men had
higher estimated VO2
max, haemoglobin levels,
serum creatinine, total cholesterol, as well as
homocysteine concentrations than women. The
cut-off values for homocysteine quartiles amongst
men were: quartile 1 (<6.63 lmol L)1), quartile 2

(6.63­7.72 lmol L)1), quartile 3 (7.73­9.10
lmol L)1) and quartile 4 (>9.10 lmol L)1);
whilst amongst women they were: quartile 1
(<5.28 lmol L)1), quartile 2 (5.28­6.30 lmol L)1),
quartile 3 (6.31­7.43 lmol L)1) and quartile 4
(>7.43 lmol L)1). Men were comparable to women
in terms of BMI, race, as well as presence of
hypertension and diabetes mellitus.
Estimated VO2
max and levels of homocysteine
High homocysteine levels were inversely associated
with estimated VO2
max amongst the women
(Table 3). After adjustment for age, race/ethnicity
and BMI, each increment of 1 SD in the natural-log-
transformed homocysteine level was associated with
a 0.70 mL kg)1 min)1 decrease (P ¼ 0.033) in the
estimated VO2
max. Interestingly, additional adjust-
ment of covariates further strengthened the associ-
ation between homocysteine and estimated VO2
max.
In model 2 (adjusted for demographics, chronic
diseases profile, health behaviours, use of lipid-
lowering agents and self-report health condition)
and model 3 (adjusted for levels of folate, vitamin B12
,
CRP, total cholesterol and haemoglobin in addition
to covariates in model 2), each SD increase in the
natural-log-transformed homocysteine level was
associated with a 0.75 and 1.18 mL kg)1 min)1
decrease in the estimated VO2
max respectively. We
did not find any association between homocysteine
and estimated VO2
max amongst men.

We subsequently analysed the homocysteine lev-
els divided into quartiles and showed that estimated
VO2
max for women in the highest homocysteine
quartile were 2.64 mL kg)1 min)1 less than that for
women in the lowest quartile after adjustment for
age, race and BMI (significant trend across homo-
cysteine quartiles with P ¼ 0.003). Likewise, sup-
plementary adjustment for additional covariates
showed an even stronger association between hom-
ocysteine and cardiovascular fitness amongst
women. Homocysteine was not related to estimated
VO2
max amongst men in the quartile-based
approach. We did not find any interactive effect of
homocysteine with folate, vitamin B12
and CRP on
estimated VO2
max in both men and women. Stra-
tified by gender, adjusted means of VO2
max based
on different homocysteine quartiles were obtained
from the fully adjusted regression models and
illustrated in Fig. 1.
The conclusions did not vary with the 683
subjects (who met technical, physical or safety
issues during cardiovascular fitness testing) with
nonmissing, yet nonreliable values of estimated
VO2
max included in the analyses.
Low cardiovascular fitness and levels of homocysteine
Association between homocysteine and gender-age
specific cardiovascular fitness levels, defined by the
ACLS, was examined by using a logistic regression
approach (Table 4). In the fully adjusted model
(model 3), the odds ratio (OR) of low cardiovascu-
lar fitness for each increment of 1 SD in the
natural-log-transformed homocysteine level was
1.61 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.25­2.08]
amongst women. By using a quartile-based
approach, the OR of low cardiovascular fitness
comparing women in the highest quartiles of
homocysteine to the lowest were 2.73 (95% CI
1.34­5.55) with a significant trend across quartiles
(P ¼ 0.006). Again, we did not find any associ-
ation amongst men.

ASSOCIATION BETWEEN HOMOCYSTEINE AND CARDIOVASCULAR FITNESS 333
Discussion
Amongst women without significant cardiovascular
disease, there was an inverse association between
cardiovascular fitness and levels of homocysteine.
The relationship was independent of age, race, BMI,
hypertension, diabetes, smoking status, use of lipid-
lowering agents, alcohol consumption, physical
activity, self-report health condition, and levels of
folate, vitamin B12
, creatinine, CRP, total cholesterol,
as well as haemoglobin. The association did not exist
amongst men. To the best of our knowledge, there are
no available data on the association of cardiovascular
fitness and homocysteine. This is the first report to
describe the association in both men and women.
Our findings support and extend a previous study
examining the relationship between homocysteine
and physical function. Kado et al. [26] from the
longitudinal MacAuthur Study of Successful Aging
followed 499 independent community-dwelling
elders for 3 years and suggested that people with
elevated plasma homocysteine levels were at an
increased risk of decline in physical function. How-
ever, they did not have the opportunity to measure
the exercise capacity in the evaluations of physical
function. In addition, subgroup analysis, such as
gender-specific approach, was not performed, poss-
ibly due to a relatively small sample size. The present
study has the advantage of examining the inde-
pendent role of homocysteine on cardiovascular
fitness by using a relatively healthy, geographically
dispersed, and ethnically diverse national popula-
tion-based sample. Additionally, covariates that may
confound the measures of association in our study
were appropriately considered and controlled.
Homocysteine is metabolized to homocysteine
thiolactone by methionyl-tRNA synthetase. Homo-
cysteine thiolactone acylates lysine residues of cellu-
lar and extracellular proteins, a process called protein
homocysteinylation [27]. Protein homocysteinyla-
tion is a possible mechanism of homocysteine-related
protein damage [27] and may thus result in impaired
cardiovascular fitness and function. However, protein
homocysteinylation cannot explain why the associ-
ation between homocysteine and cardiovascular
fitness exists only in women. There may be an effect
modification of sex hormones, including oestrogen
and androgen, in the association and further
studies to determine whether sex hormones play an
important role in mediating a toxic effect of homocy-
steine are needed.
Our results have clinical implications. Homocyste-
ine may be associated with capacity of aerobic
exercise because of improvement in cardiovascular
function. Thus, in addition to the predictive ability of
cardiovascular disease, homocysteine might serve as
an important correlate of exercise habit and recent
physical activity in women. Homocysteine levels may
be useful in screening and targeting female indivi-
duals who may require endurance intervention to
prevent loss of cardiovascular fitness and function.
Our study has some limitations that deserve
comments. First, due to the cross-sectional design
of the study, causality between cardiovascular
fitness and levels of homocysteine cannot be estab-
lished. Elevated homocysteine level may be simply a
marker of unhealthy lifestyle that is associated with
poor exercise capacity. The relationship between
levels of homocysteine and cardiovascular fitness
should be study prospectively. Secondly, the NHA-
NES did not have a direct measure of maximal
oxygen uptake (VO2
max), the most valid method of
measuring cardiovascular fitness. Submaximal exer-
cise capacity is also a valid measure of cardiovascu-
lar fitness level [28, 29] because we perform most
daily activities at submaximal levels. Additionally, it
is commonly used in clinical contexts and can be
extrapolated to maximal aerobic capacity by the
methods the NHANES used. Finally, although the
data were drawn from a national population-based
sample, 46% of the subjects (out of 2812) eligible for
cardiovascular fitness test were excluded due to
technical, physical or safety reasons. As a result, the
analytic sample was limited to a special subset of
subjects aged between 20 and 49 with reliable
measures of cardiovascular fitness. Thus, our results
were not generalizable to the entire US population.
In conclusion, elevated levels of homocysteine are
independently associated with low cardiovascular
fitness in women, but not in men. There is no
interaction of homocysteine with CRP as well as B
vitamins on levels of cardiovascular fitness. Our
study provides data in an important area where data
currently do not exist.
