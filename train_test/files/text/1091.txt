Objective: To estimate the incidence and direct medical costs for fatal and non-fatal fall injuries among US
adults aged >65 years in 2000, for three treatment settings stratified by age, sex, body region, and type
of injury.
Methods: Incidence data came from the 2000 National Vital Statistics System, 2001 National Electronic
Injury Surveillance System-All Injury Program, 2000 Health Care Utilization Program National Inpatient
Sample, and 1999 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey. Costs for fatal falls came from Incidence and
economic burden of injuries in the United States; costs for non-fatal falls were based on claims from the
1998 and 1999 Medicare fee-for-service 5% Standard Analytical Files. A case crossover approach was
used to compare the monthly costs before and after the fall.
Results: In 2000, there were almost 10 300 fatal and 2.6 million medically treated non-fatal fall related
injuries. Direct medical costs totaled $0.2 billion dollars for fatal and $19 billion dollars for non-fatal
injuries. Of the non-fatal injury costs, 63% ($12 billion) were for hospitalizations, 21% ($4 billion) were for
emergency department visits, and 16% ($3 billion) were for treatment in outpatient settings. Medical
expenditures for women, who comprised 58% of the older adult population, were 2­3 times higher than
for men for all medical treatment settings. Fractures accounted for just 35% of non-fatal injuries but 61% of
costs.
Conclusions: Fall related injuries among older adults, especially among older women, are associated with
substantial economic costs. Implementing effective intervention strategies could appreciably decrease the
incidence and healthcare costs of these injuries.
Fall related injuries are a serious public health issue
among people aged >65 years in developed countries.1­3
More than a third of older adults fall each year4 5 and
10% to 20% of falls cause serious injuries such as fractures or
head traumas.6 Non-fatal fall injuries are associated with
considerable morbidity including decreased functioning and
loss of independence7 as well as significant use of healthcare
services.3 8 9 In 2002, over 12 900 older adults in the United
States died as a result of falls,10 1.67 million older adults were
treated in emergency departments (EDs) for fall related
injuries and 388 000 were subsequently hospitalized.10 The
vast majority of these falls (.99.9%) were unintentional.10 In
a study comparing medical expenditures for 18 leading
medical diagnoses for older adults, ``injuries and poisoning''
ranked seventh (after circulatory diseases, nervous system
disorders, mental disorders, respiratory diseases, digestive
diseases, and neoplasms.)11
A number of previous studies in the US have estimated the
medical costs associated with older adult falls. Two studies
calculated only the costs for hospitalized fall injuries,6 8 one
included costs for combined treatment settings within a
limited geographic area,12 and others examined the costs for
two types of fall injuries--osteoporotic fractures13 and hip
fractures.14 One study assessed national costs of fatal and
non-fatal falls for people aged >65 years in 1994 and
reported that direct medical costs and productivity losses
totaled $20.2 billion ($31 billion in year 2000 dollars).15
In addition to being dated, these studies were limited by
the populations they included, the modeling techniques used
to estimate unit medical costs, and the degree to which they
were able to stratify costs by key injury characteristics. This
study provides estimates of the costs of fatal and non-fatal
falls in persons aged >65 years using recent data to assess
the incidence and medical costs of falls stratified by age, sex,
body region, type of injury, and treatment setting.
METHODS
Incidence and cost estimates were derived from a number of
different data sources because no single nationally represen-
tative data set would allow us to estimate fatal and non-fatal
fall incidence and direct medical costs. A complete descrip-
tion of the methodology to assess incidence and costs of fatal
falls is provided by Finkelstein et al.16 A short summary of this
methodology follows.
Fatal falls
Incidence data for fatal fall injuries in 2000 were obtained
from the National Center for Health Statistics' National Vital
Statistics System (NVSS). We computed unit medical costs
separately for five places of death identified in the NVSS
data: death-on-scene/at home, death-on-arrival to the hospi-
tal, death at the ED, death at the hospital after inpatient
admission, and death at a nursing home. Depending on the
place of death, the medical costs incurred could include
coroner/medical (C/ME), medical transport, ED, inpatient
hospital, and nursing home charges.
All fatalities were assigned C/ME costs of $530.17 Deaths on
arrival to the hospital, in the ED, or after admission also were
assigned the cost of one-way transport ($212) which was
based on average ambulance transport costs for injury victims
found in the 1999 Medicare 5% sample. For deaths on arrival
or in the ED, we also added average costs for injury fatalities
in the ED computed from 363 injury deaths in 1997
Nebraska, New Hampshire, and South Carolina ED discharge
data. (These were the only states for which data with charges
and discharge destinations were readily available.)

For deaths that occurred in the hospital, we included the
transport and C/ME costs plus the cost for an inpatient
admission that resulted in a fatality, using the 2000
Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project­Nationwide
Inpatient Sample (HCUP-NIS) file for those who died in
the hospital. HCUP-NIS includes discharge abstracts for 7.45
million inpatient stays from approximately 1000 hospitals.
For all inpatient facility estimates from HCUP-NIS, we first
multiplied the estimates by cost-to-charge ratios provided by
the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, and then
adjusted for non-facility services­­such as professional
services used while in the hospital but not included in the
admissions billing (for example, surgeon, anesthesia, physi-
cal therapy). (See Finkelstein et al17 for a complete description
of all adjustments.) For deaths that occurred in nursing
homes, we included the transport and C/ME costs plus the
adjusted HCUP-NIS cost for an acute care hospitalization
with live discharge for those with the same injury diagnosis,
plus the average cost of nursing home care computed from
the 1999 National Nursing Home Survey.
Non-fatal falls
Non-fatal fall injury incidence included injuries that resulted
in hospitalization with survival to discharge and injuries that
received medical attention without hospitalization. The latter
category included injuries that resulted in an ED visit, an
office based visit, or a hospital outpatient visit. Fall injuries
that did not receive medical attention were excluded from
this analysis.
We estimated the incidence of non-fatal injuries that
resulted in medical treatment using the 1999 Medical
Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) for office based and
outpatient visits. This is a nationally representative survey of
the US civilian, non-institutionalized population that quan-
tifies the use of health services for approximately 25 000
individuals. We used the 2000 HCUP-NIS for hospitalizations
and included records that indicated a live discharge and an
injury diagnosis in any of the first three diagnosis fields, and
used the 2001 National Electronic Injury Surveillance
System­All Injury Program (NEISS-AIP) for ED visits.
NEISS-AIP collects detailed ED injury data from a nationally
representative sample of 66 hospitals. MEPS, HCUP-NIS, and
NEISS-AIP include weights that were applied to generate
nationally representative estimates. We limited our sample to
those aged >65 years.
Non-fatal medical costs were based on claims data from
1998 and 1999 Medicare fee-for-service 5% Standard
Analytical Files that covered services for about four million
Medicare enrollees. The claims contained detailed payment
information for all covered services for hospital inpatient,
outpatient, skilled nursing, home health, hospice, physicians/
supplier services, and durable medical equipment. Our
sample was restricted to beneficiaries aged >65 years. We
excluded about 356 000 people (17%) who were enrolled in a
Medicare HMO because Medicare does not collect informa-
tion on the number, nature, or costs of their medical visits, as
well as people who did not have complete coverage for both
physician and hospital services for the full period of analysis.
These exclusions assured that we had complete claims for the
remaining sample. We further excluded anyone who had any
injury related visit during the first three months of 1998 as
these may have been for follow up treatment of injuries that
occurred in 1997. Finally, we selected the fall related E-codes
E880-E886, E888, E957, E968.1, and identified 22 514
beneficiaries in 1998 and 29 347 in 1999 who had sustained
fall related injuries.
We used a case crossover approach (previously described
elsewhere)18 and compared the monthly costs in the
12 months before and in the 12 months after the fall. This
approach is a modification of the matched case control design
in which each case acts as his or her own control. Because the
fallers comprised their own comparison group, it was not
necessary to control for demographic characteristics or for the
costs associated with treating coexisting health conditions.

Each person had 24 observations, one for each month of the
two-year period. We used a generalized linear regression
model to estimate the monthly fall injury cost and summed
the resulting estimates to compute costs for 12 months for
those injured in the analysis year. We included a variance
correction to account for clustering within individuals across
months. Estimates were computed for total costs and costs
stratified by age, sex, body region, and type of injury.
RESULTS
Fatal falls
There were nearly 10 300 fatal fall injuries in 2000 that
incurred an estimated cost of $179 million. Both the
incidence and medical costs increased with age and were
nearly 20% higher for women than for men (table 1). The age
specific costs differed for men and women. For people aged
65­74, men's costs were 44% higher than women's ($18
million v $12 million); for ages 75­84, costs for men and
women were similar ($32 million v $32 million). For people
aged 85 and older, men's costs remained essentially
unchanged ($31 million) while women's costs increased
67% (to $53 million).
When analyzed by body region, traumatic brain injuries
(TBI) and injuries of the lower extremities were the most
frequent and costly injuries; these accounted for 78% of
fatalities and 79% of costs. Two types of injuries, fractures
and internal injuries, were responsible for 70% of fatal
injuries and almost three quarters (73%) of injury costs.
However, 25% of fatal injury costs were attributed to
unspecified types of injuries.
The pattern for fatality rates differed from that seen for
incidence and costs. For all three age groups, the rates for
men exceeded those for women. Although rates for both men
and women increased with age, the relative rate (RR = rate
for men/rate for women) was highest for those aged 65­74
(RR = 1.8), somewhat lower for those aged 74­84 (RR = 1.5)
and lowest for those aged >85 (RR = 1.1).
Non-fatal falls
Non-fatal injury rates, like fatality rates, increased with age
for both men and women. However, women's rates exceeded
men's in each age group. The RR (rate for women/rate for
men) was lowest for people aged 65­74 (RR = 1.3), some-
what higher for those aged 74­84 (RR = 1.5), and highest for
people aged >85 (RR = 1.9).
There were an estimated 2.6 million non-fatal fall injuries
with a total annual cost of $19 billion (table 2). Although the
incidence of non-fatal falls varied little by age, the costs
doubled between ages 65­74 and 75­84 and then remained
the same. Women made up 58% of older adults19 while the
incidence of fall injuries among women was 2.3 times higher
and the cost was 2.8 times higher than for men. Among
women, the incidence of injuries increased 40% from ages
65­74 to 75­84 (0.5 million to 0.7 million) while costs
doubled ($3 billion to $6 billion.) However, from ages 75­84
to ages >85, the incidence of fall injuries decreased 14% (from
0.7 million to 0.6 million) while costs did not change. In
contrast, men had no increase in incidence from ages 65­74
to 75­84 (0.3 million for both age groups) although costs
doubled (from $1 billion to $2 billion.) From ages 75­84 to
ages >85, both the incidence and costs decreased.
The most frequent non-fatal injuries were those to the
lower and upper extremities. Although the number of injuries
was similar, lower extremity injuries accounted for almost
half (48%) of direct medical costs while injuries of the upper
extremities were responsible for 13%. Fractures were both the
most frequent and expensive type of injury--accounting for

just over a third of all non-fatal injuries and 61% of costs. The
second most frequent type was superficial injuries/contu-
sions. Fractures and superficial injuries combined were
responsible for three quarters of non-fatal fall injury costs.
Medical costs varied by treatment setting (table 3).
Hospitalized injuries were the most costly, followed by
injuries treated in EDs and in outpatient settings (outpatient
clinics and doctors' offices). The highest percentage of
hospitalization costs was for people aged 75­84; the highest
percentage of ED treatment costs was for people aged >85.
Direct medical expenditures for women, who made up 58% of
the older population, were 2­3 times higher than for men for
all treatment settings. Women aged >85 accounted for 6% of
the older population and incurred 33% of the total fall injury
costs.
When examined by body region, lower extremity injuries
were responsible for the majority (62%) of hospitalization
costs and the largest proportion (28%) of outpatient costs. In
contrast, injuries to the torso and upper extremities were the
most costly injuries treated in EDs. Among the different types
of injuries, fractures accounted for 80% of hospitalization
costs and almost a third of outpatient costs while superficial
injuries/contusions were responsible for about a third of ED
costs.
DISCUSSION
This study provides national estimates of the incidence and
direct medical costs associated with fall related injuries
among adults aged >65 in the United States. In 2000, there
were 10 300 fatal and 2.6 million non-fatal fall related
injuries. Estimated direct medical costs for these injuries
totaled $0.2 billion dollars for fatal and $19 billion dollars for
non-fatal falls. By comparison, largely omitting nursing
home costs and looking just at the medical costs traceable
directly to falls without fully capturing the costs of
complications using the case crossover method, Finkelstein
et al16 estimated medical costs at $12.8 billion for the same
cases analyzed here. One study found that 12% of older
adults who fell subsequently required long term nursing
home care.20 Hip fractures are especially traumatic. Older
adults who survive hip fracture often experience significant
disability and loss of independence.21 22 After hospitalization,
many hip fracture patients are discharged to nursing homes
where up to 25% of these formerly independent older adults
remain for at least a year.23
Our findings are more similar to those reported by
Englander and colleagues15 who estimated the direct costs
of falls in the US in 1994 was $21 billion (in year 2000
dollars). A recent study using 1997 MEPS data estimated the
cost of fall related injuries among non-institutionalized older
adults was $6.9 billion (in year 2000 dollars).24 This analysis,
based on a sample of 4000 seniors, used self-reported falls
data which often are underestimated.25 In addition, this study
excluded hospital patients and nursing home residents who
are at much higher risk of sustaining fall related injuries than
are community dwelling seniors.26
International studies underscore the substantial economic
burden caused by fall related injuries, regardless of the
medical care system. A recent study reported that, in 1999,
ED and hospital care for fall related injuries among people
aged >60 cost the United Kingdom almost £1 billion (US$1.9
billion)3 A Western Australia study estimated ED treated and
hospitalized fall injuries among people aged >65 cost the
Australian healthcare system $86.4 million (US$66.1 mil-
lion)9
Cost estimates differed by treatment settings. Of the direct
medical costs for non-fatal injuries, almost two thirds were
for injuries that required hospitalization, one fifth for injuries
treated in EDs, and one eighth for injuries treated in
outpatient settings. Twelve billion dollars, or 61%, was for
treatment of fractures. This is similar to a study that used
1999 Medicare claims data and found that 67% of injury

claims were for fractures.27 These injuries accounted for 80%
of hospitalization costs, 27% of ED costs, and 32% of
outpatient costs.
Medical expenditures for women, who made up 58% of the
older population,19 were 2­3 times higher than for men for all
treatment settings. It is likely that this difference represented
treatment costs for osteoporotic fractures, principally hip
fractures. Osteoporosis is a metabolic disease that causes
bones to become porous and susceptible to fracture and it
disproportionably affects older women.28 Women sustain hip
fractures at a significantly higher rate than men29 30 and
treatment typically includes surgery and hospitalization,
frequently followed by nursing home admission and exten-
sive rehabilitation.31 Although we could not identify specific
kinds of fractures (the type of fracture is incompletely coded
for fatalities and ICD-9 coding is not included in NEISS-AIP),
a 1995 study found that 63% of direct medical expenditures
for osteoporotic fractures were for hip fractures.32
Falls are the most common mechanism of TBI33 and are the
leading cause of hospital admissions for TBI.34 If a fall related
head injury occurs, older adults are particularly susceptible to
intracranial hemorrhage, especially if they are taking anti-
coagulants.35 TBI accounted for almost half of fatal falls and
associated costs. Fatality rates from TBI are highest among
the oldest old, those aged >85.36 To reduce these serious and
often fatal injuries, it is essential that we implement fall
interventions.
Injuries to internal organs were responsible for 28% of
deaths and 29% of medical costs for fatal falls. The high
prevalence of this type of fall related injury has not been
reported previously. Additional research is needed to clarify
why older adults are at risk of dying from these types of
injuries and how such fatalities could be prevented.
Although the estimated economic impact is substantial,
direct medical costs do not fully portray the financial burden
of fall related injuries. Our data did not permit us to estimate
the costs associated with lost wages and housework for the
injured or their informal caregivers, or for non-medical
expenditures (for example, wheelchair ramps), insurance
claims processing costs, reduced quality of life, and decreased
functional capacity of many older adults who sustained fall
related injuries.
This analysis has a number of limitations. We derived the
incidence and cost estimates from different data sources
which adds uncertainty to the total cost estimates. This was
necessary because no single nationally representative data set
would allow us to estimate detailed fatal and non-fatal
incidence and costs. For example, Medicare data exclude
those in Medicare HMOs and therefore could not be used to
estimate injury incidence. Our analysis quantified costs for
12 months post injury. However, without additional analyses
we could not identify which services were responsible for the
increase in costs. Finally, most of the data sources were
subject to some reporting and measurement errors which
increased the lack of precision around the estimates, may
have introduced some additional bias, and precluded
computation of standard errors.
The magnitude of this economic burden underscores the
need to implement cost effective intervention strategies. A
recent meta-analysis of the intervention literature found that
fall prevention programs, analyzed as a group, effectively
reduced the risk of falling by 11%,37 and a systematic review
reported that multicomponent interventions for community
dwelling seniors reduced fall risk 27%.38 Among people at
high risk (for example, those who have fallen at least once
before), clinical assessment combined with individualized fall
risk reduction and patient follow up was effective, lowering
the risk of falling by 18%.37
Among community dwelling older adults, the risk of falling
is 3­4 times higher among people with muscle weakness or
gait and balance disorders.39 40 The most effective single
intervention was exercise which, overall, lowered the risk of
falling between 12%37 and 20%.38 Types of effective exercises
included Tai Chi,41 42 balance and gait training, and strength
building.43­45
Because falls are frequently the result of interactions
between individuals and their environments, effective multi-
component interventions generally address multiple risk
factors.46 These might include risk factor screening; exercise
or physical therapy to improve gait, balance and strength;
medication management (which involves reducing the
number of medications, especially psychoactive medica-
tions); education about fall risk factors; referrals to health-
care providers for treatment of chronic conditions; vision
assessment and correction; and home hazard reduction.47­51
Implications for prevention
Our results show that fall related injuries among older adults,
especially among older women, are associated with sub-
stantial economic costs that are borne by individuals, society,
and the medical care system. Although research has
identified interventions that can reduce fall related injuries,
implementation remains limited. Additional efforts are
needed to successfully disseminate cost effective fall preven-
tion programs, and to promote widespread adoption at the
local level. By employing effective interventions, we can
appreciably decrease the incidence of fall related injuries,
improve the health and quality of life of older adults, and
significantly reduce healthcare costs.

Key points
N Direct medical care costs totaled $0.2 billion for fatal
and $19 billion for non-fatal fall related injuries among
people aged >65.
N Medical expenditures for women, who made up 58%
of the older adult population, were 2­3 times higher
than for men for all medical treatment settings.
N Fractures were both the most frequent and most
expensive type of non-fatal injury.
N The economic burden of fall related injuries under-
scores the need for effective interventions.
