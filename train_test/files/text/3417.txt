Introduction
The present study extends previous research, which aimed to
explore parental beliefs concerning involvement, facilitators/
barriers, and benefits of physical activity (PA) in young peo-
ple with Down syndrome (DS; Alesi & Pepi, 2015).
Specifically, the sample was enlarged to compare beliefs
concerning the involvement in sport activities among the
parents of children with DS and the parents of typically
developing children (TDC).
Benefits of regular PA in people with DS have recently
been addressed in several research (Alesi, Battaglia, et al.,
2014; Golubovic, Maksimovic, Golubovic, & Glumbic,
2012; Palisano et al., 2001; Vogt, Schneider, Abeln,
Anneken, & Strüder, 2012). Population with DS was found
to have typically sedentary lifestyle, to participate less in
sport activities, and to fail the Chief Medical Officer's
(2011) recommendation of 60-min moderate to vigorous PA
a day (Frey, Stanish, & Temple, 2008; Gonzalez-Aguero
et al., 2010; Phillips & Holland, 2011; Shields, Dodd, &
Abblitt, 2009; Temple & Stanish, 2009). The direct conse-
quence is the risk of intensifying clinical diseases by devel-
oping specific health-related complications such as the
accumulation of bone mass, the type 2 diabetes, and motor
functional impairments (Barr & Shields, 2011). Similarly,
high levels of inactivity are stated in typically developing
people despite data demonstrating physiological and psy-
chological gains from PA. A 60% of inactivity is reported in
Italy, as shown by data from the Special Eurobarometer 412
(March 2014) on the issue "Sport and Physical Activity."
Nevertheless, the participation in sport activities is a mul-
tidimensional construct that involves a variety of facilitators
and barriers. The first are positive factors enhancing the par-
ticipation of people with DS in PA, for example, parental
support, opportunities and programs for participation, acces-
sible transportation, access to resources, and so on. The lat-
ter,thebarriers,areadversefactorsthatlimitthisparticipation,
such as narrowed information about PA; developmental
delays; health problems; lack of transport and independence;
beliefs about the disability of parents, coaches, and teachers;
insufficient programs of social inclusion; few adapted equip-
ment; and so on.

Investigating Parental Beliefs Concerning
Facilitators and Barriers to the Physical
Activity in Down Syndrome and Typical
Development
Marianna Alesi1
Abstract
Family is a crucial factor to determine the amount, the duration, and the complexity of children's sport activities. This study
aims at comparing the beliefs concerning the involvement in sport activities among parents of children with Down syndrome
(DS) and parents of typically developing children (TDC). A phenomenological theoretical framework was adopted to realize
semistructured interviews with the parents. The participants were 35 parents: 19 with children and adolescents with DS
and 16 with TDC. The main facilitation/barrier themes identified by the parents of children with DS were the family and
the expert at Adapted Physical Activity (APA) instructors. Conversely, the parents of TDC identified social factors related
to family as the only barrier. One of the issues that emerge from this study is the lack of home-based physical activity (PA)
intervention programs aimed at involving families and children.

A number of research investigating factors underlined the
engagement in PAby the adapted model of theYouth Physical
Activity Promotion (YPAP) designed by Welk (1999). In the
original model, higher predictors of child engagement in PA
are the predisposing factors, such as child's self-efficacy,
attitudes and personal beliefs on PA, and physical self-com-
petence. Moreover, reinforcing factors are conditions sup-
porting PA behaviors in childhood, such as family, peer, and
teacher/coach influence. Equally important are enabling fac-
tors such as the child's physical skills and fitness level as
well as the access to gyms and environment. Indirect influ-
ence is played by personal demographics, such as age, eth-
nicity, and socioeconomic status. Recently, an adapted model
of the YPAP was developed by Downs, Boddy, Knowles,
Fairclough, and Stratton (2013). It included enabling, predis-
posing, and reinforcing factors to PA for children with DS.
Enabling factors involved environment, seasonal variation
such as decrease in PA during winter months, access and
transport, level of fitness and kind of activity (swimming,
trampolining, dance, bowling), skills, and independence.
Predisposing factors to PA engagement included enjoyment
and play, social interaction, understanding of PA, and to be
able to follow the instructions. Finally, reinforcing factors to
PA were support and opportunities, and parents and care pro-
viders' education about the importance of PA.
So, as for children with intellectual disability, three main
category factors influence the engagement in PA: individual,
familiar, and environmental variables (Downs et al., 2013;
Mahy, Shields, Taylor, & Dodd, 2010). Individual character-
istics include age, gender, the level of sport motivation,
motor and cognitive abilities, and the kind and the severity of
disability. Females, older individuals, and people with lower
level of education and higher level of severity of disability
are more likely to show decrease in variety, frequency, and
duration of PA (Kristen, Patriksson, & Fridlund, 2002;
Lippold & Burns, 2009). Therefore, personal factors which
encourage greater participation are higher level of self-
esteem or self-determination and mastery motivation to face
challenging motor tasks (Badia, Orgaz, Verdugo, Ullan, &
Martìnez, 2011; Hutzler & Korsensky, 2010; Kwan, Cirney,
Hay, & Faught, 2013). Second, family variables that might
encourage greater participation in PA are mainly emotional
and economic support. The first arouses the children's sense
of competence and determination, while the latter allows to
bear the costs of Adapted Physical Activity (APA) programs
(George, Shacter, & Johnson, 2011; Trost, Kerr, Ward, &
Pate, 2001). Finally, environmental characteristics might
concern the availability of APA programs for children with
DS (Badia et al., 2011; Barr & Shields, 2011). From now on,
PA and APA will be used in an interchangeable way. As com-
pared with traditional, the APA is an individualized PA that is
specifically modified to address the needs of people with dis-
abilities in accordance with the international classification of
functioning (ICF) model (World Health Organization
[WHO], 2001). It enhances the acceptance of individual
differences by promoting the access to active lifestyle and
sport encompassing gymnastics, dance, movement, exercise,
sports, games, recreation, and physical education.
Consequently, the APA employs adapted methods, such as
peer tutoring, in the context of large size class teaching;
adapted equipment and rules, such as bigger balls to enable
bouncing; adapted environmental variables such as a lower
net height for the volleyball; and qualified and expert at dif-
ferent kinds of disabilities coaches (Hutzler & Sherrill,
2007).
To sum up, personal, familiar, and environmental charac-
teristics are interrelated by reciprocally reinforceing links.
For example, the few number of gyms offering APA exercise
programs can oblige families to move for long distances by
enhancing the costs of transportation and, in the long run,
decreasing the motivation to engage in PA.
However, barriers and facilitators are to be found by
focusing on factors influencing parents' decisions to stimu-
late their children in sport participation. Family support
revealed to be a crucial factor influencing the choice of sport
and leisure activities and the subsequent maintenance of
compliance to exercise programs in the population with DS
(Inglis, Lohn, Austin, & Hippman, 2014).
Menear (2007) investigated parental beliefs concerning
PA needs in DS by interviewing parents of children with DS
from preschool age to adolescence. She compared themes
derived from four focus groups (preschoolers' parents, ele-
mentary-age children's parents, teenagers' parents, and
mixed age groups). Four themes were quite frequent across
all four of the focus groups: (a) short- and long-term health
benefits of PA on their children, (b) social benefits from rela-
tionship with peers, (c) sport opportunities to play an indi-
vidual sport for teenagers, and (d) need to receive parent
education concerning home-based PA intervention programs
or to enhance community-based PA programs delivered for
children with DS. So, Menear pointed out the need to edu-
cate parents and care providers on the benefits of PA and
active lifestyle.
Based on these issues, this study aims at comparing the
beliefs on facilitators and barriers to participation in PA
among parents of children1 with DS and parents of TDC.
A phenomenological theoretical framework was chosen
to carry out semistructured interviews with the parents.
Method
Participants
The participants were 35 families subdivided into two groups:
the first group was composed of 19 families with children and
adolescents with DS and the second one was composed of 16
families with TDC. In the first group, there were 11 mothers
and 8 fathers. The parents'median age was 54.59 years (range
= 37-69; ±8.82). The children were 10 boys and 9 girls with a
median age of 20.94 years (range = 7-31; ±9.5). All the
Alesi 3
children had the diagnosis of Trisomy 21 and from early
childhood had been engaged in structured speech therapy or
psychomotor activities or music therapy. Parents' inclusion
criteria were (a) to be a parent of a child with DS, (b) to have
present or past experience with their children's engagement in
sport activities, (c) to be an Italian speaker, and (d) to be
Caucasian race.
In the second group, there were 13 mothers and 3 fathers.
The parents' median age was 40.54 years (range = 25-43;
±7.23). The children were eight boys and eight girls with a
median age of 8.25 years (range = 5.2-10.11; ±4.5). All the
children were typically developing. These parents were
matched to those of the first group along with their chil-
dren's, here hypothesized, cognitive profile. We chose this
criterion, despite their chronological age, because of the big
difference in lifestyle among adolescents and young ones
with DS and typically developing peers.
All the parents were from medium socioeconomic level.
The parents of children with DS were recruited through
gyms or nonprofit associations offering support and commu-
nity resources for people with DS and their families. They
were invited to meet with researchers, to become familiar
with the goals of the study and its procedures. Following this
first meeting, the participation rate to the interview was of
about 60%, while the parents of TDC were recruited through
schools attended by their children.
Prior to the start of the study, appropriate local ethics
committee approval provided by the University of Palermo
was obtained.
Interview
A semistructured interview was developed to investigate
the parental beliefs on facilitators/barriers to activities as
well as physical and psychological benefits of sport in
children.
First, data were collected on the children's history and the
family background by the evaluation of parameters such as
parents' academic history and jobs. Second, the interviewer
followed a schedule of focused and open questions on facili-
tators/barriers and benefits of PA.
All the interviews were conducted by the same researcher
and lasted no more than 25 min.
Data Analysis
All the interviews were transcribed to allow the thematic
analysis of answers. Transcripts were read independently by
two researchers to identify quotes revealing meaningful
themes and remove inappropriate quotes. Consequently, the
accepted quotes were clustered into categories highlighting
common themes which were classified on the basis of their
frequency of occurrence to identify the most important
themes as facilitation or barrier. Similar procedure was fol-
lowed for both the groups.
The identified themes were displayed into four figures:
Two figures show facilitators to PA identified by the parents
of children with DS and TDC (Figures 1 and 2), and two
figures show barriers to PA identified by the parents of chil-
dren with DS and TDC (Figures 3 and 4).
Results
In the group of parents with children with DS, three main
facilitation themes were identified: (a) the support from fam-
ily, (b) the presence of expert at APA instructors and coaches

and the availability of gyms, and (c) the challenging nature
of sport activities (Figure 1).
The family revealed to be considered the first facilitator.
The parents of children with DS showed to recognize the key
role of siblings (11) and themselves (18) to motivate their
children in sport participation. However, the majority (13) of
them judged not relevant to their personal engagement as a
model for children. The second facilitator was the availabil-
ity of instructors able to train children with DS using theAPA
(18). This factor was strictly associated to gyms with special-
ized sport machines and without architectural barriers (13).
The last facilitating theme identified in our interviews was
the nature of PA: socialization (19), challenging (15), or
enjoying (11). Sport activities were considered as an oppor-
tunity to experiment successes by facing up to themselves
and the others with similar characteristics.
In the group of parents with TDC, two main facilitation
themes were identified: (a) the support from family and (b)
the characteristics of sport activities (Figure 2).
In this group, the family revealed to be considered the
first facilitator. The key role of siblings (5) and them-
selves (16) to motivate their children in sport participa-
tion and to act as a model (11) was recognized. The
second facilitator was the expertise of instructors at PA
(14) as well as the nature of PA characterized by chal-
lenge (13), enjoyment (10), experience of success (13),
and agonistic activity (5).
With concern to the barriers, the parents of children with
DS identified three main themes: (a) the lack of expert at
APA instructors and coaches, (b) the DS characteristics, and
(c) the worries of parents (Figure 3).
Parents argued that the lack of adapted exercise classes
(13) and programs of inclusion (10) for children with DS
were the main barriers. Moreover, the scarce presence of
expert at APA coaches was acknowledged (13).
Another significant barrier concerned the physical and
medical characteristics of DS, such as gross motor impair-
ments (11), hypotonicity (9), weight (8), heart impairments
(7), and coordination difficulties (4). With regard to psycho-
logical domain, limited cognitive abilities (7) were consid-
ered as a barrier to the engagement in sport more than the
limited communication abilities (2). Taken together, these
factors increased the worries of parents (7) by creating an
extra obstacle.
The parents of TDC recognized the family as the
main barrier: no time to spend for sport activities (13),
the difficulties of transportation (13), the economical
resources (10), and the worries about eventual failures
(9) (Figure 4).
Finally, similar physical and psychological benefits were
advanced by all our interviewed parents (Figures 5 and 6).
For the parents of children with DS, the physical benefits
included reducing the obesity (12) and improving the motor
coordination (9). The psychological benefits concerned
increasing self-esteem (16) and self-image (13), and improv-
ing socialization skills (13) and cognitive functions such as
memory and attention (8).

For the parents of TDC, the physical benefits were reduc-
ing the obesity (15), improving the motor coordination (16),
preventing the diabetes (15), and decreasing the insomnia
(12). The psychological benefits included increasing self-
esteem (16) and self-image (16), and improving socializa-
tion skills (16) and cognitive functions such as memory and
attention (16).
Discussion
The main goal of the described study was to investigate the
parental beliefs concerning facilitators/barriers and benefits
of PA among the families of children with DS and the fami-
lies of TDC.
On the whole, all the interviewed parents stated that fam-
ily plays a key role to influence children's engagement in PA.
The parents of children with DS recognized the role of fam-
ily both as facilitator and barrier to the participation of chil-
dren in PA. This result is consistent with previous research,
which demonstrated how parents deliver emotional/motiva-
tional and economic support. These are necessary to face
challenging tasks as well as the transportation and the costs
of activities (Badia et al., 2011; Downs et al., 2013; Mahy
et al., 2010; Shikako-Thomas, Shevell, & Schmitz, 2013).
The costs of sports programs, the equipment, and the trans-
portation are expensive and rely on family available econom-
ical resourcess (Cordes & Howard, 2005; Van Naarden
Braun, Yeargin-Allsopp, & Lollar, 2006).
However, as previously mentioned, family is consid-
ered as a barrier at the same time because of parental wor-
ries regarding gross motor impairments, hypotonicity,
overweight, heart impairments, and limited cognitive and
communication abilities linked to the specific disability of
their children. All these factors may increase the family
overprotection by limiting the participation to sport activ-
ity in their children (Frey et al., 2008). These parents, as
opposed to the parents of TDC, did not recognize their role
of model to influence the starting and maintaining compli-
ance to exercise programs by their children. Research
describes the family modeling as an important factor in
determining the amount, the duration, and the complexity
of their children's sport activities (Temple & Stanish,
2011; Trost et al., 2001).
The study findings showed that the availability of expert
at APA instructors and coaches is another main factor, both
as facilitator and barrier, which plays a crucial role in the
engagement in PA by children with DS. This staff was
required to be specifically trained for the special needs of
their children. Our parents identified that a support staff may
initiate and sustain the participation in PA over the time.
These findings are in agreement with other research that
found a close relationship between the limited opportunities
to participate in PA and the lack of specific training programs
addressed to people with DS (Mahy et al., 2011). Moreover,
this barrier is often strengthened by the lack of accessible
services and facilities such as gyms and buildings with spe-
cialized sport machines and without architectural barriers.
Other differences in parental beliefs between our two
groups emerged in the perception of features characterizing
sport activities. The parents of children with DS evidenced
characteristics such as socialization, challenge, and enjoy-
ment. This result agrees with research on this issue.
Socialization features derive from social opportunities in
sport including cooperating with others, respecting rules,
mastering new skills suitable for everyday life, experiencing
personal achievement, and obtaining the encouragement of
other people with the same disorder (Battaglia et al., 2013).
PA is also judged enjoyable because of the opportunity to
experiment leisure experiences and execute lovely and excit-
ing exercises with music and games (Mahy et al., 2011).
Nevertheless, the nature of sport allows to develop indepen-
dence skills by facing challenging tasks and experimenting
the sense of competence and self-empowerment (Badia et al.,
2011; Downs et al., 2013).
The parents of TDC introduced in this category two new
characteristics such as having successful experiences and par-
ticipating in agonistic activities. This last result is explained
as the product of stereotypes widely spread in Western societ-
ies which associate sport and values such as success, power,
competition, and the importance of winning.
All our interviewed parents stated the physical and psy-
chological benefits of PA. For the parents of children with
DS, physical benefits were the prevention or the control of
medical diseases such as obesity and motor coordination
impairments. Specifically, the control of the obesity was con-
sidered the main benefit. It is now largely recognized how
high levels of overweight and obesity among people with
intellectual disability are closely associated to higher level of
inactivity and unhealthy dietary practices (Battaglia et al.,
2013). So, PA was acknowledged by parents as a worthy
weight control intervention as an alternative to medicine ther-
apies (Slevin, Truesdale-Kennedy, McConkey, Livingstone,
& Fleming, 2014).
For the parents of TDC, physical benefits were more gen-
eralized. They not only included the prevention of over-
weight, but they also take account of other factors such as the
prevention of diabetes and the decreasing of insomnia. On
the whole, the great importance attributed by all parents to
PA in the control of overweight confirms the awareness of
the crucial role of family in the weight management by con-
trolling the quantity and the quality of food, making the rules
on food and meals, and outlining a healthy home environ-
ment (Prussing, Sobo, Walker, & Kurtin, 2005).
Psychological benefits concerned for all parents the
increase of self-esteem and self-image, as well as the
improvement of cognitive functions such as memory and
attention. The main difference between the two groups was
that the parents of children with DS attribute more impor-
tance to motivational benefits rather than cognitive improve-
ments. In recent years, researchers have shown how regular
6 SAGE Open
PA is useful to face the fear of humiliation, the low athletic
self-perception, and low self-efficacy because it allows self-
evaluation by comparing oneself performance with others on
a variety of physical and motor tasks (Alesi & Pepi, 2013;
Pepi & Alesi, 2005).
Moreover, parents of TDC stated positive effects of PA on
memory and attention. This is consistent with results from
studies using magnetic imaging techniques (functional mag-
netic resonance imaging [fMRI]) which demonstrated how
regular aerobic exercises modifie the brain function in the
anterior cingulate cortex withimprovements in cognitive per-
formances such as speed of processing, working memory,
planning and control strategy employ (Alesi, Bianco, et al.,
2014; Best, 2010).
On the whole, the current findings are added to a grow-
ing body of literature on the parental beliefs of PA as a key
factor to contribute to well-being of their children. It is
widely accepted by researchers and practitioners that a sed-
entary lifestyle is an important risk factor able to exacer-
bate medical diseases and enhance welfare assistance and
use of medical services. So, high economic health costs are
the consequence.
The main shortcoming of this study is the age range of the
children which is widely disparate, with young adults
included in the group of people with DS, and only children
younger than teen age years in the TDC group. However, this
may be the strength of this study as the results within each
group are homogeneous. What parents think about PA may
not be influenced by the age of their children but by their
developmental age and disability. All parents recognized the
physical and psychological benefits associated with chil-
dren's participation in PA. However, the primary benefits
identified by the parents of children with DS concerned
physical themes as reducing obesity or improving motor
coordination as well as psychological gains like increasing
self-esteem, self-image, and socialization skills. These par-
ents wished for APA intervention programs that better met
their children's needs and encouraged their participation. On
the contrary, the parents of children with TDC stated other
benefits as decreasing the insomnia or increasing memory
and attention. So the findings of this study, although prelimi-
nary, suggest some interesting implications on the educa-
tional field for future practice. First, it is crucial to organize
settings aimed at encouraging the sport participation in typi-
cal and atypical population. Second, it would be decisive to
develop specially designed programs and training aimed at
increasing participation in PA involving both children with
DS and their parents.
