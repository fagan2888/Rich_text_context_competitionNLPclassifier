The Impact of Medicaid Expansion on
Medicaid Focused Insurers in California
Michael J. McCue, DBA1
Abstract
To gain insights into the impact of Medicaid Expansion under the Affordable Care Act, this study assesses the enrollment,
utilization, and financial performance measures of California Medicaid focused health insurers. The study compares these
quarterly measures, during the expansion period of 2014 to the same quarterly measures in 2013 and 2012. During 2014,
Medicaid focused insurers expanded enrollment, decreased inpatient days, and generated higher profit margins.

Original Research
Introduction
In January 2014, the Affordable Care Act (ACA) expanded
Medicaid coverage for adults up to the age of 65 with
incomes under 138% of the federal poverty level. (A major
limitation of this study is that the membership increase in
Medicaid may also stem from the "out of wood work effect,"
whereby individuals who were previously eligible for Medi-
Cal, but were not enrolled, were found to be eligible when
signing up for health care insurance under the ACA. One
analysis estimates that at least 5% of California Medi-Cal
members were previously eligible [see Gorn D, "Medi-Cal
Enrollment Jumps to 11.3 Million," CaliforniaHealthline.
http://www.californiahealthline.org/capitol-desk/2014/11/
medical-jumps-to-11-3-million. November 12, 2014.])
California's Medicaid program called the "Medi-Cal" pro-
gram has the largest Medicaid enrollment1 in the United
States.2 (Total Medi-Cal enrollment grew to 11.9 million
members by December of 2014 compared with 8.6 million
members at the beginning of 2014.) To assess the impact of
Medicaid Expansion, this study measures the enrollment,
utilization, and financial measures of Medicaid focused
health insurers during the quarterly time periods of 2014.3,4
Study Data and Methods
The study initially identified 27 full-service health insurers
with Medi-Cal members in 2014. (The study excluded one
specialty full-service insurer that was focused on aids treat-
ment and one insurer with a senior care focus.) To assess the
direct impact of the Medi-Cal expansion on utilization and
financial measures,5 the study identified 17 insurers with
70% of their enrollment in the Medi-Cal program. Enrollment
and utilization data of these insurers were collected from the
financial statement database of the California's Department
of Managed Care.6 (In 2013 and 2014, one Medicaid focused
health insurer did not report inpatient days per thousand and
ambulatory encounter data. Therefore, the utilization analy-
sis is based on 16 health insurers. For 2012, only 12 Medicaid
focused plans reported encounter data and one Medi-Cal
health insurer's Medicaid enrollment was below 70% in
2012.) The study design was an "interrupted time series
design," whereby the quarterly financial performance and
utilization measures during the expansion period of 2014
were compared with the same quarterly measures in the prior
years of 2013 and 2012.7 (The growth analysis of these data
points is defined as quarter over quarter basis. The major
weaknesses of this design is the lack of a comparison group
of health insurers that did not experience Medicaid Expansion
in the state of California during these periods, which would
enable the design to control for other extraneous events that
occurred during these time periods. Given this design, the
study compared over time each respective quarterly period of
2014 with its respective quarterly periods of 2013 and 2012.
The strength of this design is that each Medicaid focused
health insurer is able to act as its own control for seasonal
effects that may occur from enrolling and dis-enrolling
members as well as managing their care.)

Enrollment and Utilization Results
Medicaid focused insurers increased their total Medi-Cal
enrollment in the last quarter of 2014 by 47% to 7.7 million
members, from 5.2 million members for the last quarter of
2013 (see Table 1). In addition to enrollment gains, Medi-Cal
members'utilization patterns changed in response to Medicaid
Expansion. The first and fourth quarters' ambulatory care
encounters per member per month (PMPM) were reduced by
more than 0.06 encounters PMPM from 2013 to 2014 (see
Table 1). Non-physician to physician ambulatory encounters
for last three quarters of 2012 were significantly higher than
their respective values for 2013 and 2014. Although relative
to 2013 findings, non-physician versus physician ambulatory
encounters for 2014 trended downward to an almost identical
median ratio of 0.27 in 2013 (Quarter 4) and 0.29 in 2014
(Quarter 4). Finally, starting in the second quarter for 2012
and 2013, inpatient days per thousand trended upward, while
in 2014, inpatient days per thousand increased in the third
quarter and declined slightly in the fourth quarter. However,
starting in the second quarter of 2014, inpatient days were
substantially lower than their respective prior quarters of
2012 and 2013. The greatest difference occurred in the fourth
quarter with a reduction of 56 days from 279 days in 2013 to
223 days in 2014 (see Figure 1).
Financial Performance Results
The medical loss ratio for the Medicaid focused insurers
trended downward (see Table 2) each quarter in 2014 and
declined to 86.6% for the fourth quarter of 2014, which
was 330 basis points lower than medical loss ratio for the
2013 fourth quarter. (Data were collected from the
Department of Managed Health Care Financial Summary
dataset on a quarterly basis. For the denominator of each
measure, the study used total revenues and not premium
revenues as this date element is not available on the sum-
mary quarterly data. As a result, the medical loss ratio and
administrative cost ratio values may be lower than medical
loss and administrative cost ratios based on premium rev-
enues as total revenues include not only premium revenues
but also other revenues such as interest income and sales
tax revenues and grants. Profit margin was computed by
summing medical and administrative expenses and sub-
tracting this summary value from total revenues. The profit
margin ratio was profit margin divided by total revenues.
Median values for each performance ratio do not sum
across the three financial performance ratios.) Quarterly
medical loss ratios for 2013 trended downward for 2013
from 91% in the first quarter to 89.9% in the last quarter,
whereas 2012 quarterly medical loss ratios remained
around 92% for three out of four quarters. Quarterly
administrative cost ratios decreased over the four quarters
of 2014 and were more than 100 basis points lower for
three out of four quarters in 2013. Quarterly administrative
cost ratios between 2012 and 2013 were not substantially
different for each quarter. Quarterly profit margin ratios
grew from 3.55% in the first quarter to 9.36% in the fourth
quarter compared with 1.99% in the first quarter of 2013
and 4.79% in the last quarter of 2013. Quarterly profit mar-
gin ratios for 2012 were less than or equal to 1% for each
reporting period whereas quarterly profit margins for 2013
were more than 4 times higher in last 3 quarters of 2012.
Conclusion
From the first quarter to the last quarter of 2014, Medi-Cal
membership increased by almost 1.7 million members for

Medicaid focused insurers.To control their medical expenses,
Medicaid focused insurers appear either to enroll members
who required less care due to their health status or were more
effective in managing the care of these new members. This
outcome supports preliminary studies that expected these
newly enrolled Medicaid members, specifically childless
adults, under ACA to use less inpatient care over time,8,9 The
utilization measures support these findings as well, specifi-
cally with respect to inpatient days per thousand in the last
quarter, which was 56 days lower than prior year's last quar-
ter. Except for the first and last quarters of 2014, ambulatory
encounters by members appear to be similar to prior years,
which suggests that these insurers continue to manage their
care on an outpatient basis.
Increased membership may have contributed to achieving
the effects of economics of scale due to fixed administrative
costs, especially in terms of compensation. As a result of the
declines in the medical loss ratio and administrative cost
ratio, the Medicaid focused insurers were able to generate
substantially higher profits that grew from 3.55% in the first
quarter to 9.36% in the last quarter of 2014. However, the
study has several major limitations, specifically related to the
smaller sample size, lack of comparison group, and the gen-
eralizability of findings to only one state. Future studies
should expand this analysis on a national basis to assess the
utilization and financial impact of Medicaid health insurers
in the 30 states that expanded the Medicaid program com-
pared with remaining states that did not.
