Introduction
The (new) sociology of childhood1 has contributed much to
thinking about children and young people, including under-
standing childhood as a social construction and recognizing
the diversity of childhood(s). This way of thinking about
children and childhood has been significant in disrupting
dominant frameworks of developmental psychology and
socialization, to instead conceptualize children as "being"
(rather than "becoming") and social actors in their own right.
While diversity is mentioned, attention to the specific impli-
cations of factors such as gender is largely absent from the
sociology of childhood. Ferreira (2004) argues that in the
process of socially defining childhood, sociologists removed
all the heterogeneity of children, ignoring other factors such
as gender, ethnicity, and social class. Relatedly, Eriksson
(2007) argues that, "[e]ven though gender has been a central
dimension for some of the key researchers in the field . . . so
far childhood scholars in general cannot be said to engage
deeply with gender studies" (p. 62).
Generally, when gender is mentioned in the sociology of
childhood, it tends to be fleeting, in binary terms, and/or is
not discussed in relation to feminist gender theories. In this
sense, gender is often reduced to a list of differences between
boys and girls with no further exploration of how these dif-
ferences are constructed or what they mean to children.
Therefore, what is actually missing is a critical standpoint
that accounts for the social construction of gender and the
influence of gender relations and hierarchies among
children.
There appears to be little dialogue between the sociology
of childhood and feminist studies.2 Recent works by key
writers in the field of the sociology of childhood, such as
James and James (2012) and Alanen (2012), have celebrated
and encouraged the interdisciplinarity of studies of children
and childhood, mentioning diverse fields of thought: sociol-
ogy, social anthropology, psychology, history, geography,
philosophy, economics, ethics, medicine, social policy, law,
pedagogy, art, and literature. However, there is no specific
mention of feminist studies as a current or potentially useful
contributor to understandings about children and childhood.
Parallels between the sociology of childhood and feminist
studies, such as listening to previously unheard voices in
research, and the ways in which childhood studies can learn
from feminist studies, have been noted, including by Alanen
(1994) herself (see also Thorne, 1987). Within feminist stud-
ies, children have historically been ignored or not included
as research participants (see Alanen, 1994; Oakley, 1994;

Accounting for Gender in the Sociology of
Childhood: Reflections From Research in
Australia and Brazil
Clare Bartholomaeus1 and Adriano Souza Senkevics2
Abstract
The (new) sociology of childhood has contributed much to thinking about childhood as a social construction and recognizing
the diversity of childhood(s). However, age and generation are often the primary focus of sources in the field. We argue that
attention to gender is rare in the sociology of childhood and, when it is mentioned, is under-theorized. Although there is
now a growing amount of feminist research with pre-teen children, there is a lack of discussion between the broad field of
feminist studies and the sociology of childhood. In this article, we draw on our own research studies in Brazil and Australia, as
well as previous key studies about gender and children, to consider the ways in which gender and age can be conceptualized
together, and to demonstrate the significance of gender in children's lives.

Rosemberg, 2001). This absence likely related to the desire
to break the link between women and children, where women
and children were viewed as having the same interests and a
"natural" connection, and as women tried to separate them-
selves from maternal responsibilities (Burman & Stacey,
2010). Important early feminist thinking about gender and
children appeared in the late 1980s and early 1990s, by writ-
ers such as Davies (2003/1989), Thorne (1993), and
Walkerdine (1990). Since then, there have been an increasing
number of studies with children examining gender from fem-
inist perspectives, although it is worthwhile noting that this
work has been published far more often in education journals
rather than feminist studies or childhood journals. Despite
the growth of research about gender and children, many
studies do not specifically consider the implications of
(socially constructed) age for gender.
In this article, we argue that a consideration of gender
drawing on feminist theorizing has much to offer the sociol-
ogy of childhood. We draw on our own studies, in Australia
and Brazil, to provide ways of examining gender and age
together and to show how gender is relevant in children's
lives. We focus our discussion on two topics--play and
sport--which are often discussed in studies with children
and relate to our research. Importantly, we situate our
research in the contexts in which it was conducted. In some
ways, both countries can be viewed as belonging to the
"global South," although Australia also has strong connec-
tions to the "global North" (for an in-depth discussion of
theorizing in relation to the South, see Connell, 2007).
Importantly, we are writing from outside the places where
the (new) sociology of childhood has been developed and is
the strongest, such as in the Nordic countries, the United
States, and the United Kingdom. In Australia, children are
largely absent from sociology and the national body The
Australian Sociological Association (TASA) does not have a
thematic group dedicated to childhood (for an overview of
children and sociology in Australia, see van Krieken, 2010).
Discussions about children and childhood, including in terms
of gender, tend to be concentrated in education, where there
is a large body of work advocating for feminist-informed
teaching and education (for an overview discussion of femi-
nism and education in Australia, see Yates, 2008). Children
are also not a focus of sociology in Brazil. While there are
some attempts to consolidate a sociology of childhood in
Brazil (see Faria & Finco, 2011), as in Australia, most of the
research in this regard is undertaken in the education field
(Castro & Kosminsky, 2010). At the same time, gender has
not been a priority in childhood studies, where it is almost
absent in the so-called foundational texts such as Quinteiro
(2002).
Absences of Gender in the Sociology of
Childhood
In our research conducted in two distinct countries, we
noticed independently that gender was largely absent from
the sociology of childhood. This is a widespread occurrence
in many countries. In a recent special issue of Current
Sociology, childhood sociology was mapped in 10 different
countries with an article on each country (Australia, Brazil,
the United States, the United Kingdom, Finland, France,
Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, and Romania). Overall,
there is little consideration of gender in these overview arti-
cles, and only two mention specific research about children
and gender (in the United States and Finland, respectively;
Bass, 2010; Strandell, 2010).
There are surprisingly few critiques of the relative absence
of gender in the sociology of childhood. An exception is
Haavind (2005) who, in a review of several key sociology of
childhood books, notes that "[h]ere and there particular
chapters hint at observations of gender differences, but this
tends to be laid out as a descriptive fact without further
reflection on or interpretation of what it means" (p. 150; see
also Eriksson, 2007). The lack of attention to gender may
relate to the fact that the sociology of childhood is dominated
by a small number of influential texts, writers, and concepts
that, as Bühler-Niederberger (2010) argues, "produces a
global scientific influence which initiates and shapes child-
hood sociological research" (p. 376). The centrality of age
and generation in these writings is also likely to be a factor.
In addition, this absence may also relate to the little consid-
eration of children in their own right in feminist studies
broadly, as mentioned above. Although we do not expect
gender to be a key focus of all sociology of childhood
sources, the scarce mention of gender, and the lack of in-
depth theorizing is surprising. In this section, we provide a
brief overview of what has been written about gender in the
sociology of childhood, focusing on several key writers and
texts in the field.
In the sociology of childhood, gender appears to be dis-
cussed most when bodies and/or play are the focus of analy-
sis. For example, Prout's (2000) edited book The Body,
Childhood and Society mentions gender more than other key
collections in the sociology of childhood. Gender is dis-
cussed to some degree in four of the nine chapters. Most
notably, Prendergast (2000) draws on feminist theories about
bodies, including the work of Grosz and Gilligan, to discuss
girls' growing bodies, focusing on their early knowledge
about and experiences of menstruation.
A notable writer in the sociology of childhood, Corsaro,
occasionally includes some reference to gender in his work
on play, peer culture, and interactions. Although Corsaro
(2014) references some key feminist thinkers such as Thorne,
Walkerdine, Davies, and Connell, his approach often stresses
gender differences in terms of distinct peer cultures, as can
be seen in his international study comparing the United
States and Italy (Aydt & Corsaro, 2003). Moreover, he
focuses on differences between boys' and girls' interactions,
rather than considering the constructions behind "being" a
boy or a girl or the power relations between genders.
Even though gender is sometimes mentioned in the soci-
ology of childhood, it is largely under-theorized. A key text
Bartholomaeus and Senkevics 3
Theorizing Childhood (James, Jenks, & Prout, 1998) includes
some discussion of gender and research about gender and
childhood, particularly in relation to the work of Thorne.
However, for the most part, the authors are less interested in
the gender content and theories in these works and instead
tend to focus on the contributions to thinking about child-
hood broadly. The entry for "Gender" in Key Concepts in
Childhood Studies outlines that "gender is a critical compo-
nent of childhood's diversity" (James & James, 2012, p. 61),
where it is one aspect of children's social identity that needs
to be considered in relation to age, ethnicity, and class (i.e.,
broader social structures) in the context of their culture and
society. However, although James and James draw on some
feminist research, engagement with feminist gender theories
is notably absent. Thus, gender is occasionally mentioned in
discussions of diversity, but without being expanded on.
Another example is James and Prout (1997) who acknowl-
edge "the danger that in collectivizing children into `child-
hood' significant differences (of gender, class, ethnicity,
disability etc.) between children are underplayed" (p. xiii).
However, in these accounts, ultimately age is viewed as more
important than other differences.
The view that generation and age are the most important
categories to examine, at the expense of all other intersec-
tions, is most clear in the work of Qvortrup (see, for exam-
ple, 2000, 2010). He views attention to gender, class, or race
as problematic because they assume similarity among chil-
dren based on particular categories:
[t]here is of course nothing wrong in studying gender or class or
race issues among children, but one has to be aware that such
choices are by the same token not addressing generational
questions, i.e. they may be unwarrantedly assuming similarities
among children. In this respect Coles (1967: 322) made an
important point when he observed that "in a sense white and
Negro children have more in common with each other than with
their parents." (Qvortrup, 2000, p. 94, n5)
Thus, Qvortrup privileges age over any other category,
downplaying, for example, shared experiences by children
and adults, including in terms of structural inequality.
Although many writers in the sociology of childhood view
age and generation as the most important category of analy-
sis when studying children, Qvortrup is explicit in his rejec-
tion of the need to consider other categories. Indeed, he
views them as a threat to the perspective of childhood as a
structural element present in every society (Qvortrup, 2010).
The attention to diversity and multiple social structures
that Qvortrup so fears is what interests us most. We view age
as a significant category in children's lives but not the only
category and not the most important category in every con-
text. Even though our focus in this article is on the insufficient
attention paid to gender in the sociology of childhood, we
acknowledge that this is part of a larger lack of consideration
of how age intersects with other forms of diversity too,
such as ethnicity, race, sexuality, class, and so on. Rather than
considering these as separate categories that can be "added
in," we view them as intersecting, and creating contextually
specific experiences for children. The rest of the article
focuses on feminist-informed research about gender and chil-
dren, including our own, showing how these studies contrib-
ute to thinking about the interweaving of gender and age.
Research About Gender and Children
There is now an increasing amount of feminist-informed
research about gender and children that sits largely apart
from the sociology of childhood. Broadly, this research
examines gender as a social construction. It has been influ-
enced particularly by the work of Connell (2000, 2005) and
by post-structuralist theories. Connell's theories about the
"gender order" and gender hierarchies, particularly in terms
of multiple and hierarchical forms of masculinities (see, for
example, Connell, 2000, 2005), have been influential in
examining gender relations and patterns among children (as
well as teenagers and adults). Her concept of hegemonic
masculinity, which denotes the most culturally exalted form
and produces complicity and upholds the "gender order," has
been frequently used in discussions of young masculinities.
Feminist post-structuralist accounts of gender are often used
in combination with Connell's theories in research about
gender and children. Post-structuralist approaches, such as
the work of Foucault and Butler, emphasize the fluidity of
subjects and view power as produced through discourse.
Although there is diversity among writers drawing on these
theories for research about gender and children, Connell's
gender theories and feminist post-structuralist approaches
have been most frequently drawn on and therefore appear
useful for theorizing gender in the sociology of childhood.
In this section, we draw on our own research in Brazil and
Australia, focusing on the ways in which we use gender theo-
ries in our research, and highlighting the contributions they
make to understanding gender and age. Although we are
aware of the difficulties of discussing two different studies
together, we believe that they are useful to explore how socio-
logical studies of gender among children can be undertaken in
different countries. To focus the scope of this article, we offer
a consideration of two topics: play and sport. Play is a topic
that has received much attention in work about childhood and
sport is a key theme discussed in studies about masculinities
and boys. To provide a context for our own research, we start
both sections with a brief discussion of some of the existing
examples of research studies that have considered the inter-
weaving of gender and age in childhood.
Feminist Research About Play, Gender, and
Children
Play in its various forms is often a focus of research with
children and, therefore, is an important topic to examine in
terms of what has been written about gender. Research about
4 SAGE Open
play, children, and gender has been influenced by and built
on feminist-informed gender theories, including the view
that gender is fluid and contextual, that ideas about gender
can influence and restrict children's play, and that there are
power relations between and within genders.
How gender, play, and children are conceptualized has
been greatly influenced by Thorne's (1993) foundational
book Gender Play, which draws on ethnographic research in
the United States in 1976 to 1977 and 1980. Thorne's work is
influenced by postmodern feminist theory (specifically Flax,
1987, Butler, 1990, and Scott 1988) and the work of Connell.
Thorne demonstrates that play can be fun but it is not triv-
ial--it is important to understanding gender constructions
among children. Thorne (1993) developed the influential
concept of "borderwork" to examine "interaction across--
yet interaction based on and even strengthening--gender
boundaries" (p. 64). She examines the different kinds of bor-
derwork that take place in elementary schools--contests
between boys and girls, chasing/kiss chasing, and ideas of
gender pollution--showing how these work to strengthen
notions of "boys" and "girls" as opposites. Thorne shows
that both age and gender are important in the lives of children
at school, along with other factors (such as class and ethnic-
ity), and that context is central to the significance of gender
and age.
Davies also offers a sophisticated consideration of the
intersection of gender and age. Her work has some similari-
ties to Thorne's in that she draws both on Connell and post-
structuralism and moves away from understanding gender as
a binary, although Davies offers a more thorough-going post-
structuralist account. Davies's (2003/1989) research with
preschool children in Australia, documented in Frogs and
Snails and Feminist Tales, shows how gender affected chil-
dren's lives in a number of ways, from how they could play
in the "home corner" to awareness of male power to the way
in which dress-up clothes were viewed by children as infused
with multiple meanings and possibilities. She draws on the
concepts of the "male­female binary" and "category-mainte-
nance work," arguing that "category-maintenance work"
occurs around gender boundaries where "deviants" are
policed and gender categories are maintained regardless of
individual deviations (Davies, 2003/1989, p. 31). Davies's
post-structuralist account of theorizing gender means that
she views gender as an ongoing construction, never fixed
and never unitary, where individuals are positioned in differ-
ent ways in different contexts.
Ferreira (2004) offers an example from a Portuguese con-
text in her book A gente gosta é de brincar com os outros
meninos (We like to play with the other boys), which draws
on an ethnography in a public kindergarten with 3- to 6-year-
old children. Drawing particularly on Scott's post-structural-
ist approach to gender, Thorne's ethnography, and Connell's
conceptualization of masculinities, Ferreira pays careful
attention to how gender is actively reproduced and/or trans-
formed by children throughout their play and interactions.
She argues that children negotiate plural, unstable, and contra-
dictory "gender identities," and thus no child simply embodies
a coherent model of being a boy or a girl. Paying attention to
children's participation in this process, the author adopts the
notion of "dealing with" a certain "model," "ideal" or "dis-
course." In addition, Ferreira (2004) acknowledges the coexis-
tence of multiple masculinities and femininities as well as
"their ludic and/or strategic usage by the same actor, according
to the circumstances" (p. 358; authors' translation).
Much of the research about gender and play is undertaken
in education settings, which are seen as important places for
the construction of childhood. However, many other places
are relevant sites where children construct gender as they
play, learn, and interact, such as their local neighborhoods.
With this in mind, the second author's research in Brazil pro-
vides an example of how play, access to neighborhood
spaces, and domestic work intersect and relate to gender.
Playing Outdoors, Working Indoors: A
Consideration From Brazil
Conducted in Brazil, the second author's research draws on a
qualitative study examining gendered family practices
among children from working-class backgrounds in São
Paulo city. The data were collected at one public school,
where children gave their viewpoints about their school, par-
ents, siblings, and home. These results were useful to under-
standing how gender affects children's schooling
achievements considering, as a starting point, that girls over-
all have better outcomes than boys in education in Brazil
(Carvalho, 2009; Rosemberg & Madsen, 2011). A key find-
ing of the research was the leisure­housework balance,
where the possibility to play on the street compared with the
constraints of working at home was experienced differently
depending on the gender of the children.
The research was undertaken in 2012, in a co-educational
public school with students from urban working-class com-
munities (in this context, children came from families who
worked in low-level and often informal jobs). One Year 3
class participated in the research, involving 25 students who
interacted with the researcher around twice a week for one
semester. After a couple of weeks informally talking and
playing with the students, six individual and seven paired
interviews were conducted with 20 children (12 girls and 8
boys), aged mostly 8 or 9 years. During the interviews, chil-
dren were asked about their routines at home and the range of
activities they engaged in once they left school in the after-
noon. Connell's (2005) concept of masculinities and her
emphasis on social practices were adopted to examine what
children did in their daily routines, how these activities
related to gender, and the potential effects of these on the
schooling process among girls and boys.
A sharp difference in the leisure time, range of play activi-
ties, and access to the street was found between boys and
girls (as also found by Fiaes, Marques, Cotrim, & Bichara,
Bartholomaeus and Senkevics 5
2010; Silva, Pontes, Silva, Magalhães, & Bichara, 2006).
While the street was a site that boys could often access, meet
friends, and have fun through the practice of play and sports,
risks concerning the public space were often pointed out by
girls. Fear of being kidnapped, meeting drunk people, or
even catching influenza were evoked to compose a list of
dangers that were expressed by girls and could be seen as
encouraged by gendered parental concerns that related to dis-
tinct rules and expectations among their offspring. None of
the girls felt that they were free to play on the street as much
as they wanted. The public space itself was perceived as dan-
gerous for girls, while for a lot of boys those risks did not
appear to be a limit in their daily routines, even though they
lived in the same communities as their female classmates.
Thus, masculinities were constructed taking as a reference
point the public space and the range of games and activities
that boys could play after the school. Playing on the street
gains a special importance in working-class children's lives
in Brazil because leisure opportunities are scarce. No public
gardens or parks characterize low-income communities in
São Paulo, nor do these houses have yards to play in. Without
entering the public space, there remain only the small spaces
of houses to play in, where children undertook activities such
as playing with dolls, watching television, playing video-
games, or using the computer. That is why having access to
the outdoors (playing football on the street, having fun on the
sidewalks, or interacting in any empty land) is so relevant for
children who were allowed to dedicate part of the day to play
there.
Alongside perceptions of risk, girls' participation in
housework diminished their access to leisure time, and to
play on the streets and elsewhere (see also, for example,
Valentine, 2004). This process may have influenced the con-
struction of femininities defined by responsibilities and dis-
cipline that were rare features among their brothers and male
classmates who spent most of the day playing. This fed back
into the school success among girls that, according to
Carvalho, Senkevics, and Loges (2014), seems to rise from
within the practices that constrained girls' access to leisure
and sociability. In other words, girls' limitations to playing
meant that they spent more time on school work, had more of
an interest in going daily to school, and had a more positive
relationship with this institution than boys.
In addition, two contradictory processes were evident in
children's interviews. On one hand, girls were critical of
their brothers'low level of engagement in housework, report-
ing situations when boys had more opportunities to play in or
outside the house. Such inequality was not readily accepted
and, though girls continued to do housework, they also criti-
cized boys' benefits. On the other hand, participating in the
gendered division of domestic work was in a certain way
naturalized among girls. For most girls, doing housework
was not a kind of "help" or "contribution," but a responsibil-
ity and a duty. The sharing of responsibilities was implied
among sisters, which did not occur between sisters and
brothers. Moreover, only one boy was really engaged in
domestic work. Interestingly, this boy had few leisure oppor-
tunities, no siblings of a similar age to play with, and almost
no access to public space.
This research suggests that, even within the same family,
children may experience distinct childhoods due to gendered
expectations, according to which housework is part of a gen-
dered routine that mostly relies on girls'engagement. In con-
trast, having the whole day to play, especially outside home,
is a male privilege.
Feminist Research About Sport, Gender, and
Children
Commonly viewed as a form of play, sport is often a key
focus of feminist-informed research about boys and mascu-
linities in primary school, especially in Anglophone coun-
tries. Sport tends to be written about in terms of school
settings rather than early childhood settings, highlighting the
importance of age and context. Studies with primary school
boys frequently draw on Connell's (2000, 2005) theoretical
framework of a hierarchy of multiple masculinities, particu-
larly her concept of hegemonic masculinity (see, for exam-
ple, Bhana, 2008; Renold, 1997; Swain, 2006). Such studies
often examine sport in relation to privileged and hierarchical
masculinities as well as hierarchical relations between mas-
culinities and femininities.
The role of peer group settings is particularly important
for boys' constructions and understandings of masculinities,
including in relation to sport. Keddie's (2003) research with
five male friends aged 6 to 8 years in an Australian primary
school shows the importance of gender in the lives of these
boys by examining their investments in (Australian Rules)
football and how this links to gendered, heterosexist, and
homophobic understandings of masculinity (drawing on the
work of Connell, among others). Keddie draws on feminist
post-structuralist theorizing, particularly the work of Davies,
to examine dominant understandings of gender. She uses
post-structuralist theorizing to be able to examine how social
power was exercised and to reconsider "dominant and domi-
nating ways of being" (Keddie, 2003, p. 75). In addition, by
closely examining small-group peer culture, Keddie's
research illuminates how gender was collectively constructed
and understood, including the discrepancies and challenges
to dominant understandings of masculinity.
Sport has also been examined in terms of the ways in
which gender interweaves with race and class in childhood.
Bhana (2008) analyzes the significance of sport among 8-
and 9-year-old boys in two distinct primary schools in South
Africa. She discusses the multiple hierarchies at work, where
sport was key to the privileging of some boys over "weaker"
boys and girls. In addition, some sports were viewed as more
"masculine" than others, which was notably contested among
the White and Black boys. Bhana utilizes Connell's concept
of hegemonic masculinity to examine gender hierarchies in
6 SAGE Open
her research, which she analyzes particularly in relation to
race and class. She considers boys' understandings and con-
structions of masculinities and sport as being influenced by
the contexts of the schools, the areas in which the students
lived, and broader aspects in South Africa, such as the his-
tory of rugby and middle-class White men, and soccer and
working-class Black men.
Research has found that despite their young age, boys
(and girls) draw on broader discourses about gender and
sport, including those in the media and professional sport
(see also, for example, Keddie, 2003), to construct mascu-
linities in particular ways and create gender hierarchies.
Even though boys do not have access to these adult mascu-
linities, they can still act them out in some ways. Bhana
(2008) notes that regardless of the physical bodies of boys, it
is important to recognize that strong, sporting adult bodies
help shape discourses around gender for boys. Lodge (2005)
similarly argues that "[e]ngagement in football and aptitude
in the game allows young boys to participate in a game that
is also a high status adult male activity" (p. 184). The inter-
section of gender and age in terms of sport is discussed in
more depth below in relation to the first author's research in
Australia.
Sport and Gender Hierarchies: A Consideration
From Australia
The first author's research examined constructions and
understandings of gender in two Australian primary schools.
The research focused on the intersection between gender and
age, and considered the usefulness of implicitly adult gender
theories, particularly those about masculinities, to under-
stand gender among primary school-age students. A key
finding of the research was the importance of sport in con-
structing a privileged masculinity among boys, as well as
upholding a distinction between boys and girls, where boys
were viewed as superior to girls (for an earlier discussion,
see Bartholomaeus, 2011). This research and the previous
studies discussed above demonstrate the complex gender and
age dimensions of sport in childhood, where sport is more
than a social or fitness activity.
Research was conducted in two co-educational primary
schools in metropolitan Adelaide, South Australia, in 2009.
St. Catherine's Primary was a small Catholic school with
over half of the students from Anglo/White backgrounds.
Socrates Primary was a Greek Orthodox school, comprising
mainly students from Greek and/or Cypriot backgrounds.
Both schools were largely middle class, with students from
Socrates Primary more likely to be from privileged back-
grounds than those from St Catherine's Primary. Two classes
from two age groups participated at both schools, involving
a total of 95 students aged 6 to 7 and 11 to 13 years. Students
participated in a number of verbal and written activities in
groups and individually across five sessions that provided
them with different avenues to reflect on their ideas about
being girls and boys (for full details, see Bartholomaeus,
2012). Class teachers and interested parents were inter-
viewed about how they thought gender was understood by
the students.
In this research, sport and physical bodies were drawn on
to construct a legitimating masculinity that influenced many
boys and was also supported by a number of girls. The per-
vasiveness of this idea was highlighted by the fact that the
research was conducted solely in the classroom, which meant
that the author did not interact with the students when they
were playing sport. The author reconsidered Connell's (2000,
2005) multiple masculinities framework in light of the data,
noting where her theories were useful, and where the find-
ings could not be easily interpreted into the patterns she
writes about. A consideration of the impact of young age on
gender indicated a need to understand gender as more fluid
than Connell's theorizing allows for. Applying Foucault's
notion of discourse was most beneficial in theorizing this flu-
idity, yet many of Connell's theories were still useful in theo-
retically framing the findings. The author followed the lead
of others who have drawn on the notion of a discourse of
hegemonic masculinity (Beasley, 2008) to theorize that
which is most influential in defining what is most "mascu-
line" in any given setting, and that ensures men's (as a group)
authority over women (as a group).As Beasley (2008) writes,
"hegemonic masculinity [may be viewed] as a political
mechanism--as a discursive ideal mobilizing legitimation"
(p. 100). This concept enables an examination of the fluidity
of other practices that work alongside or present challenges
to a discourse of hegemonic masculinity, including fluidity
relating to age and context (Bartholomaeus, 2013).
Therefore, the privileging of sport for constructing mas-
culinities could be understood as a discourse of hegemonic
masculinity. Sporting masculinities were the most privileged
when considering different masculinities in relation to each
other; sport was constructed as something that was important
to being a boy; and sport was often constructed as being for
boys and not for girls. The cultural exaltation of sporting
masculinities was evident when students were asked to rank
eight famous faces from most "manly" to least "manly," giv-
ing reasons for their choices. Athletes were commonly
viewed by the students as the most "manly," above other men
such as actors and the then Australian Prime Minister (Kevin
Rudd). Athletes were not privileged in the same way in a
related activity ranking female famous faces from most
"womanly" to least "womanly." The privileging of sporting
masculinities was also evident when students wrote about
people they looked up to, where it was clear that boys looked
up to only male athletes, and that these represented adult
masculinities. In contrast, none of the girls wrote about look-
ing up to any athletes.
Sport was also constructed as being for boys by claiming
that it was not for girls. This included the view that girls do
not play sport or are less skilled at it than boys (see also, for
example, Renold, 1997; Swain, 2006). At the same time,
Bartholomaeus and Senkevics 7
some girls, as well as some boys who did not like or engage
in sport, also equated sport with boys. Generally, girls'
involvement in sport was mentioned by girls only when pro-
voked or challenged by boys, such as when boys made claims
to be more skilful at sport than girls. Importantly, alongside
the construction of boy/girl divisions in terms of sport, hier-
archies of sports were used to create a discourse of hege-
monic masculinity (see also Bhana, 2008; Keddie, 2003;
Swain, 2006), with soccer being the most privileged for boys
at both schools.
Key broader influences on constructing sport as important
for masculinity included the media, schools and teachers,
and parents. For example, the lack of women's sports shown
in the (Australian) media was drawn on by a 6-year-old boy
in particular to ascertain that "only men and boys play soc-
cer." Another example of a broader influence came from the
mother of a Year 6 boy who suggested that expectations in
terms of gender coming from her husband involved
"push[ing]" their two sons into sport, which was not the
same for their daughter.
This research supports the contention that, in Australia at
least, it appears that a discourse of hegemonic masculinity
begins with sport. Importantly, due to their young age, boys
are unlikely to have access to other factors often related to
hegemonic masculinity, such as work, sexuality, and/or
fatherhood (Connell, 1983). However, students often drew
on adult men in their understandings of privileged masculin-
ity in terms of sport and to enhance the gendered power rela-
tions in their own lives. The young age of the students was a
barrier to accessing a broader discourse of hegemonic mas-
culinity, even to those boys who embraced sports and associ-
ated aspects of physicality. This research shows how the
complex interweaving between gender and age plays out in
relation to sport.
Conclusion
In this article, we have argued that though gender is not a key
concern in the sociology of childhood, it is an important fac-
tor in children's lives. When gender is included in this field,
it tends to be under-theorized, where gender is often reduced
to a list of differences between boys and girls or it is simply
mentioned as one factor relating to diversity. Drawing on a
feminist analysis of gender together with a sociological
approach to the study of children and childhood helps to
account for the varied positions that children occupy in soci-
ety and their experiences, including in relation to gender.
By drawing on our own research in Brazil and Australia,
as well as previous research, we explored how gender was
taken up and constructed in children's lives and the ways in
which this can be theorized. We examined the complex inter-
weaving in Brazil of play and other factors such as responsi-
bilities in housework and risks concerning public space, with
specific attention to how gender influenced how this was
experienced by children. Although children's experiences in
terms of access to leisure and constraints relating to house-
work were often divided by gender, this can be seen as a
construction often put in place by parental and broader soci-
etal views of risk and responsibilities in terms of girls.
Indeed, some of the girls expressed critical standpoints
against the imposed gender dualism. The research in
Australia showed how gender and age interweave to produce
particular privileged gender discourses, where masculinities
are often constructed via sport and as distinct from feminini-
ties. Importantly, a discourse of hegemonic masculinity
based on sport was something that many boys aspired to but
did not necessarily have access to. Thus, power relations
between different practices of masculinities were evident as
well as between masculinities and femininities.
Despite the differences between our two studies, some
commonalities in our approach should be highlighted.
Broadly, we both argue for the importance of examining chil-
dren's experiences of gender and how gender relations play
out between boys and girls as well as among boys and among
girls. Furthermore, a consideration of the power relations
inherent in interactions and structures is necessary, including
to better understand children's pleasures and felt restrictions
in relation to gender. We feel that it is important to consider
how children engage with, construct, take up, and challenge
dominant gender discourses as well as to examine how gen-
der matters in children's lives, including when it is important
and when it is less important, and how age influences this. In
particular, we want to go beyond an examination of gender
binaries to explore the complexity of gender in children's
lives. This is not to deny that gender can work as a binary in
children's lives, including how they may explicitly talk about
it, such as constructing sport as for boys and not for girls, and
how it restricts their everyday activities, such as girls not
being allowed to play on the street when boys are. Going
beyond identifying binaries and viewing them as taken for
granted, it is important to examine the social and cultural
mechanisms keeping this binary working, and how children
experience it.
More broadly, we feel that it is important to reconsider the
concept of "child" in the sociology of childhood. We would
like to ask how much can be inferred from the experiences of
children if they are devoid of other social and structural fac-
tors and contexts. We agree with the central tenet of the soci-
ology of childhood that "childhood" is both a social
construction and a structural category that is important in
children's lives. However, the tendency to view age as the
most important category in all contexts, places, and times
ignores children's experiences of other factors, and how
these factors intersect with age to produce specific experi-
ences and positions. Although we have focused on gender in
this article, there is also clearly a need to extend conversa-
tions about diversity in the sociology of childhood. This
involves paying attention to other social categories such as
ethnicity, race, sexuality, and class. and considering how
these intersect with age (and gender). Exploring the ways in
8 SAGE Open
which age interweaves with gender goes some way toward
enhancing the discussion about accounting for diversity
among children, which is mentioned in the sociology of
childhood but rarely examined in depth.

Notes
1. The (new) sociology of childhood is now sometimes referred
to as "the new social studies of childhood" (see, for example,
James, Jenks, & Prout, 1998) to incorporate a wider range of
disciplines. However, despite this broadening of the name,
feminist studies still seems to be overlooked. We use "the soci-
ology of childhood" in this article because it best represents
our approach.
2. We use feminist studies to include gender studies, masculinity
studies, and sexuality studies. We chose this term to emphasize
that we are focusing on work that draws on some form of femi-
nist theories.
