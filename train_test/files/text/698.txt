BACKGROUND: National survey data show increases in mean body mass index (BMI) and in the prevalence of
overweight and obesity for adults and children in the United States, indicating a change in the distribution of BMI.
OBJECTIVE: To apply graphical methods to describe changes in the distribution of BMI.
DESIGN: BMI values from the third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III: 1988 ± 94) were
compared with data from earlier cross-sectional nationally representative surveys for adults 20 ± 74 y of age and for
children and adolescents 6 ± 17 y of age. Tukey mean ± difference plots were used to investigate the changes in the
distributions of BMI within sex ± age groups.
RESULTS: Mean ± difference plots allow qualitative visual comparisons of the distributions of BMI between surveys.
For all sex ± age groups, there was increasing skewness with a greater shift in the upper part of the distribution so
that, within each group, the heaviest subgroup was heavier in NHANES III than in prior surveys. For the youngest
children, the lower part of the distribution showed virtually no change. With increasing age the whole distribution
tended to shift upward slightly, suggesting an increase in BMI across the entire population.
CONCLUSIONS: These changes in the distribution of BMI suggest the combination of both profound environmental
determinants and a population with a high degree of susceptibility. The reasons for the increasing prevalence of
obesity should be sought in part by seeking to understand the factors causing increases in the population as a whole.

Introduction
The prevalence of overweight and obesity have
increased markedly in the United States for both
children and adults.1 ± 3 National survey data show
that between 1976 ± 80 and 1988 ± 94 the age-adjusted
prevalence of obesity (body mass index (BMI)
! 30.0) increased by 8 percentage points, from
14.5% to 22.5%, in the US adult population ages
20 ± 74 y. Mean levels of BMI also increased, from
25.3 to 26.5. The prevalence of overweight also
increased markedly for children and adolescents in
the United States over the same period. Before these
observations, previous surveys had shown only slight
increases from the 1960s to 1980 for both children and
adults.1 ± 3
Little is known about the reasons for these increases
in obesity in the population, although similar trends
have been seen elsewhere in the world as well. Within
a given population, these increases are likely to be
responses to changes in environmental and social
factors, rather than to genetic changes in the popula-
tion or to the effects of immigration and emigration.
As Rose has pointed out, increases in the prevalence
of an elevated level of a characteristic such as blood
pressure or BMI tend to be associated with shifts in
the distribution of that characteristic in the entire
population.4 ± 6
Several general models for the increase in the
population prevalence of obesity are possible. One
subgroup of the population may be heavier than the
comparable subgroup in the past, with little change in
the rest of the population. Or all subgroups of the
population might be heavier than the comparable
subgroups were previously. Because both these
changes, as well as many other types of changes,
would lead to increases both in the prevalence of
overweight and in mean BMI, these increases do not
in themselves show exactly what the underlying
changes in the population distribution of BMI might
be. The Rose model would suggest that increases in
the prevalence of obesity are likely to be related to
changes in the distribution of BMI in the population as
a whole.
The objective of this paper is to apply graphical
methods to investigate the changes in the distribution
of BMI in the United States, using data from cross-
sectional nationally representative health examination
surveys. Because these comparisons are based on
successive cross-sectional surveys, each of which
examined a different sample of individuals, these

increases over time do not show changes on an
individual level. However, the differences in the
distribution of BMI between two surveys can be
examined.
Because we found no standard approach in the
literature for comparing distributions of BMI, we
reviewed a number of graphical methods. We selected
Tukey mean ± difference (m ± d plots)7 to compare the
distribution of BMI in NHANES III to the distribution
of BMI in prior surveys for the same sex ± age
categories. Since these plots may be unfamiliar, we
®rst describe the construction and use of m ± d plots
and give some examples. We then apply this method
to data for the US population. We previously
published some examples of m ± d plots for a few
selected age ± sex groups for adults from the ®rst
phase of NHANES III (1988 ± 91) and for children
and adolescents.3,8
Methods
NHANES III
The third National Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey (NHANES III) was conducted from 1988 to
1994 by the National Center for Health Statistics
(NCHS) of the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention. A nationally representative sample of
the US civilian non-institutionalized population was
selected using a complex, strati®ed, multistage prob-
ability cluster sampling design. Informed consent was
obtained from all respondents and the protocol was
reviewed and approved by the NCHS NHANES
Institutional Review Board. A home interview was
followed by a physical examination in a mobile
examination center. A description of the plan and
operation of the survey has been published.9
NHANES III is the most recent in a series of cross-
sectional health examination surveys carried out by
NCHS. Although each survey provides representative
national data, different individuals are examined each
time. In all surveys, weight and height were measured
using standardized techniques and equipment.1 Body
mass index (BMI) was calculated as weight (kg)
divided by the square of height (m). For adults,
obesity was de®ned as a BMI value ! 30.0. For
children and adolescents, overweight was de®ned as
a BMI value equal to or greater than the preliminary
month-of-age-and sex-speci®c 95th percentile values
from the revision of the NCHS growth charts.
For adults aged 20 ± 74 y, we compared the distri-
bution of BMI in NHANES III with the distribution of
BMI in the preceding survey, NHANES II, which was
conducted from 1976 to 1980 using a similar design
and similar methods. A description of that survey has
also been published.10 In NHANES III there was no
upper age limit. However, because for NHANES II,
the upper age limit was 74 y, comparisons for adults
are limited to the age range 20 ± 74 y. Women who
were pregnant at the time of the examination are
excluded from these analyses. Unweighted sample
sizes by sex and age group for adults are presented
in Table 1.
For children and adolescents aged 6 ± 17 y, we
compared the distribution of BMI in NHANES III
with the distribution of BMI in two earlier surveys in
the series. Cycles II and III of the National Health
Examination Survey (NHES II, 1963 ± 65; NHES III,
1966 ± 70). Descriptions of these surveys have also
been published.11,12 NHES II was limited to children
aged 6 ± 11 y and NHES III was limited to children
and adolescents aged 12 ± 17 y. Because the preva-
lence of overweight in these two earlier surveys was
similar to that in NHANES II and because these
surveys had large sample sizes for children and
adolescents, these surveys were selected as the basis

NHANES III. Unweighted sample sizes for children
and adolescents are presented in Table 2. Pregnant
girls aged 17 (n  15) in NHANES III were excluded
from these analyses: pregnancy status was not avail-
able for younger girls or for earlier surveys.
Mean-difference plots
To examine the changes in the distribution of BMI,
we used Tukey mean ± difference plots (m ± d plots) to
compare the distributions from the two surveys.7 A
mean ± difference plot is a graphical method for com-
paring distributions that is related to the quantile ±
quantile (q ± q) plot of Wilk and Gnanadesikan.7 For
both types of plots, shifts in distributions are investi-
gated by comparing corresponding quantiles (for
example, percentiles) from two distributions. To con-
struct a q ± q plot, the quantiles from one distribution
are graphed against the corresponding quantiles from
the other distribution. To construct an m ± d plot, the
differences between the corresponding quantiles are
graphed on the y axis against the means of the same
quantiles on the x axis. The points on the plot
represent the differences between two distributions
at a given quantile level plotted against the means of
the same quantile level from the two distributions. For
example, if the value of the 40th percentile for one
distribution was 21.5 and for the other distribution
was 20.0, the plot would include a point for that
percentile that showed the difference between the
two values (1.5) plotted against the mean of the two
values (20.75). If the two distributions were the same,
the quantiles would be equal and the differences
would all be zero. The location of the plotted point
on the y axis shows the direction and magnitude of the
shift. The shift is assessed by judging differences from
the horizontal line representing zero.
Another graphical method sometimes used to com-
pare distributions is a plot that shows the cumulative
percent of the population from each distribution at
each BMI value.13 ± 15 The information in a plot of
cumulative distributions is similar to that contained in
an m ± d plot. However, the plot of cumulative dis-
tributions can be dif®cult to interpret and a clearer
visual assessment of the type of shifts between the two
distributions can often be derived from the m ± d plot.
The m ± d plot shows the differences more explicitly
than the cumulative distribution plot and is easier to
assess visually because of the horizontal orientation. It
also shows the numeric value of the shift more clearly.
Three simpli®ed examples showing several types
of possible differences between two distributions are
presented in Figures 1, 2 and 3, along with the m ± d
plots and cumulative distribution plots corresponding
to those differences. In the ®rst example, both
distributions have the same shape but the second
distribution is shifted rightward (upward) by a con-
stant amount relative to the ®rst distribution (Figure
1). The constant shift appears in the m ± d plot as a
constant difference between percentiles of the two
distributions. The amount of the constant shift can be
read directly from the m ± d plot axis.
The second example also shows two distributions
(Figure 2). At the lower end, the two distributions are
very similar and correspond closely, but at the upper
end, one distribution is more skewed to the right than
the other. In the corresponding m ± d plot, the differ-
ences corresponding to the lower percentiles are close
to zero, showing no shift of the distribution at the
lower percentiles, and increase progressively at higher
percentiles, showing the increasing skewness.
The third example (Figure 3) combines the features
of the ®rst and second examples. The second distribu-
tion, relative to the ®rst, is both shifted upward
and more skew. The corresponding m ± d plot shows
both the shift at lower percentiles and an increasing
difference at upper percentiles indicating increased
skewness as well.
These three ®gures provide schematic representa-
tions of three possible changes in the distribution of
BMI, all of which would result both in an increased
mean BMI and in an increase in the prevalence of
obesity. These are presented simply as examples to
show how m ± d plots represent some speci®c changes

between two distributions. Many other types of
changes could also occur.
As a real-life example, a frequency distribution plot
for men aged 40 ± 49 y is presented in Figure 4 with
the corresponding m ± d plot and cumulative distribu-
tion plot. The frequency distribution is sensitive to the
choice of intervals for the plots. In this example, the
interval is 1 BMI unit. A wider interval would produce
a smoother plot but lose detail and obscure some
features of the distributions. A ®ner interval would
produce a more detailed but more jagged plot. In
contrast, the quantiles used for m ± d plots are not
affected by the choice of intervals. Although with
smaller intervals between quantiles the number of
points on the plot will increase, the value of any
given point such as the 90th percentile is not affected
by the choice of interval. As can be seen from this
example and the preceding examples, in both the
frequency distribution and the cumulative distribution
plot, it is dif®cult to evaluate changes at the extremes
of the distribution. It is also dif®cult to assess how
constant or how variable the shift might be across the
distributions. The m ± d plot permits evaluation of
both these features.
Data analysis and statistical methods
For adults, age was de®ned as age in years at the time
of the household interview, which generally preceded
the examination by 2 ± 3 weeks. The age groups used
were 20 ± 29 y 30 ± 39 y, 40 ± 49 y, 50 ± 59 y, 60 ± 69 y
and 70 ± 74 y. For children and adolescents ages 6 ±
17 y age was de®ned as age at the time of the
examination. Single year of age groupings were
used for children and adolescents because over this
age range BMI increases with age and the BMI values
for children of different ages are not directly compar-
able. In the age range 6 ± 17 y, ®ndings should be
interpreted cautiously because the unweighted sample
sizes for the NHANES III data are small, particularly
for adolescents.
Statistical analyses were carried out using SAS and
SUDAAN.16,17 For each survey, sampling weights

have been calculated that take into account the
unequal probabilities of selection resulting from the
sample design and from planned oversampling of
certain subgroups. Con®dence intervals were calcu-
lated using variance estimates that took into account
the complex sample design of the surveys.
Weighted percentiles were calculated using the
sampling weights. We calculated the even percentile
values for each distribution (2nd, 4th, 6th percentile,
etc., up to the 98th percentile). For each percentile
level, we then calculated the mean of the correspond-
ing percentile values from the two distributions and
the difference between the corresponding percentile
values from the two distributions, calculated as
NHANES III minus the other survey. Each point on
the plot represents the mean (on the x axis) and the
difference (on the y axis) for an even percentile from
the 2nd to the 98th percentile. Data were omitted from
the m ± d plots for one adolescent male age 14 y who
had both a very high BMI (49.4) and a high sampling
weight, making this single point unduly in¯uential.
For children and adolescents, analyses were repeated
limiting the sample to white children and adolescents
in NHES and to non-Hispanic white children and
adolescents in NHANES III. The results were similar
to those found including all race-ethnic groups (data
not shown).
Results
Increases in mean BMI and the prevalence of obesity
For adults the increases in mean and median BMI and
in the prevalence of obesity (BMI ! 30.0) between the
two surveys are shown in Table 3. For children and
adolescents, the differences in mean and median BMI
are presented in Table 4 by single year of age, and the
differences in the prevalence of overweight are pre-
sented in Table 5 for broader age groups. For every
age ± sex group, both mean and median BMI and the
prevalence of overweight or obesity were greater in
NHANES III than in the previous survey, suggesting
that for both children and adults the distribution of

BMI values in NHANES III differs from previous
surveys. For the changes in mean BMI and the
changes in the prevalence of overweight, 95% con-
®dence intervals generally did not include zero. For
children and adolescents, the median BMIs were
always greater in NHANES III than in NHES IIaIII
although the con®dence intervals generally included
zero.
Mean ± difference plots
M ± d plots comparing the distribution of BMI in
NHANES III with the distribution of BMI in NHES
II are shown in Figure 5 by single year of age for
children aged 6 ± 11 y. The y-axis shows the value
of the difference between corresponding percentiles
of the two distributions and can be interpreted as
showing the direction and distance of any shift
between the distributions. The shape of the line
formed by the points suggests the nature of the
shift. These are qualitative graphical methods
designed to summarize and display differences
between two distributions. Because of this and
because of the small sample sizes for some age
groups the general patterns are more important than
the individual details.
For 6-y-old children, both male and female, the m ±
d plots show that the distributions of BMI from the
two surveys are virtually identical over most of the
range. Most of the differences are very close to zero.
However, at the upper (higher) end of the distribution,
the differences begin to increase progressively until at
the highest percentiles, the percentiles for NHANES
III are 4 ± 6 BMI units greater than the corresponding
NHES II percentiles. These large differences show a
marked upward shift and increased skewness at the
upper end of the distribution, while most of the
distribution is unchanged.
Although there are differences in detail, the patterns
for children aged 6 ± 11 y are broadly similar. Most of
the plots suggest that the distributions of BMI in the
two surveys have changed little if at all at the lower
end, where the mean differences are close to and
sometimes less than zero. However, at the upper end
of the distribution all plots, except for 11-year-old

girls, show a large difference of at least 2 BMI units
and often much more. This shows pronounced
increases in skewness with large shifts at the upper
end of the distribution. Thus the changes in the
distribution of BMI for children between NHES II
and NHANES III are characterized by little or no
difference at the lower end of the distribution, increas-
ing skewness and large changes at the upper end of the
distribution.
M ± d plots comparing the distribution of BMI in
NHANES III with the distribution of BMI in NHES
III are shown in Figure 6 by single year of age for
adolescents aged 12 ± 17 y. Here again, the pattern is
similar with little change at the lowest part of the
distribution but strikingly large changes of 2 ± 6 BMI
units at the upper percentiles for most groups, except
for girls aged 15 and 16 y.
M ± d plots comparing the distribution of BMI in
NHANES III with the distribution of BMI in
NHANES II are shown in Figure 7 for men and
women aged 20 ± 74 y by 10 year age groups.
Although the details differ between sex Ð age
groups, there are some broad similarities. In
almost every case, the percentiles from NHANES
III are greater than the corresponding percentiles
from NHANES II. This shows that there is some
upward shift in the distribution of BMI for every
sex ± age group. All age ± sex groups also show
greater differences in the upper portion of the
distribution. This shows that there is also increased
skewness in the distribution of BMI for every sex ±
age group. The magnitude of the differences varies
from group to group. However, in most groups, the
largest differences are approximately 3 ± 4 BMI
units and are seen at the highest percentiles of the
distribution.
For younger men (aged 20 ± 49 y), the differences at
the lower end of the distribution are small ( ` 1 BMI
unit) and fairly constant. However, at the upper end of
the distribution, the differences are much larger and
are progressively greater at higher percentile levels.
This pattern shows that, at these ages, there is a slight
upward shift of the entire distribution and in addition a
large increase at the upper end of the distribution, so
that the distribution is also becoming more skewed.
For men in the older age ranges (50 ± 74 y), the
pattern is similar, but the degree of the shift is greater
at lower levels and less at higher percentiles than for
the younger age groups. This pattern suggests that for
older men, the upward shift is stronger and the
increased skewness at the upper end of the distribution
is less than for younger men.
For women, the pattern is different. For most age
groups of women, the differences increase steadily
across percentiles. This shows that the entire distribu-
tion is shifting upward and becoming progressively
more skewed at higher levels. Compared with men in
the same age range, the shifts in the distribution for
women are greater at lower percentiles for the age
range 20 ± 49 y.
Discussion
Increases in mean and median BMI and in the pre-
valence of BMI ! 30.0 all show that the distribution of
BMI for adults in NHANES III differs in some way
from the distribution of BMI in NHANES II. Similar
®ndings for mean and median BMI and the prevalence
of BMI ! 95th percentile also show that the distribu-
tion of BMI for children and adolescents in NHANES
III differs from the distribution of BMI for the
corresponding age ± sex groups in NHES II and III.
However, these ®ndings do not in themselves give a
complete picture of how the distributions of BMI have
changed over time.
The changes in the distributions can be represented
graphically by mean ± difference plots. These graphi-
cal methods by their nature include a very large
number of individual data points, as compared with
summary statistics such as the mean or standard
deviation. The purpose of these methods is not to
focus closely on any given individual data point, but
rather to depict graphically the overall differences in
the two distributions. These methods are not suited,
for instance, clearly to identify with certainty a
particular value of BMI above which the distribution
shifts. However, they can show broad qualitative
differences between the distributions.
These plots show that for both adults and children,
the distribution of BMI is becoming more skewed in
all sex ± age groups. The heaviest subgroup of the
population is much heavier in NHANES III than was
the heaviest subgroup in previous surveys. In addition,
for adults, the entire distribution of BMI is shifted
upward in NHANES III relative to NHANES II.
However, these plots show that this is not a uniform
shift across the whole distribution.
The degree of these changes in the distribution
differs by age. For younger children and to some
extent for adolescents, the lower portion of the dis-
tribution seems to be anchored with no substantive
change over time. In these age groups, the principal
effect is increased positive skewness at the upper part
of the distribution. For younger men (aged 20 ± 49 y)
the principal change is also increased positive skew-
ness at the upper part of the distribution, but there is in
addition a slight upward shift that tends to be small
and fairly consistent. The differences in the lower
portion of the distribution are small ( ` 1 BMI unit).
For older men (aged 50 ± 74 y). however, the upward
shift is more pronounced and the shift at the upper
end, indicating skewness, less pronounced. For
women, there is a more gradual increase across the
entire distribution, suggesting both an upward shift
and increasing positive skewness.
Taken together, these observations suggest that for
adults some factors causing increases in BMI are
affecting the entire distribution of BMI, although the
changes in the distribution of BMI are most marked at
the upper end of the distributions. These plots show

that for adults in all age ± sex groups, almost the entire
distribution of BMI appears to have shifted upward
to some extent in NHANES III compared with the
corresponding distributions in NHANES II. Thus
these ®ndings do not suggest that the increases in
mean BMI and in the prevalence of BMI ! 30.0 in
NHANES III, relative to NHANES II, are due solely
to the heaviest people in NHANES III being heavier
than the heaviest people in NHANES II. For adults,
there is no part of the distribution that is clearly
unresponsive to the in¯uences that are causing the
population increase in BMI and the prevalence of
obesity. For older men there is almost a complete shift
of the distribution.
These ®ndings suggest that the causes for the
increase in obesity should be sought in part at the
population level rather than focusing on individuals.
From the perspective of individual behaviors, changes
in physical activity, energy intake and smoking initia-
tion or cessation may lead to changes in energy
balance and thus to the increases in overweight and
obesity. However, these changes in behaviors are
likely to be related to social and environmental
changes that may affect the whole population. Accord-
ing to Rose, to ®nd the determinants of prevalence and
incidence rates, we need to study characteristics of
populations, not of individuals.4 The social and envir-
onmental causes of changes in BMI are unclear but
might include increased availability of food, changes
in food composition, changes in patterns of food
intake, fewer opportunities for physical activity,
increased use of labor-saving devices, changes in
cigarette smoking, and perhaps also changes in cul-
tural and social attitudes and values that might directly
or indirectly affect body weight.18 ± 20
The changes observed in the US affect the popula-
tion broadly enough that they appear unlikely to be
due to the effects on the population of immigration
and emigration. Nor are they likely to be due to trends
in the race ± ethnic composition of the US population.
The increases in the prevalence of overweight are as
large or larger for non-Hispanic white children and
adults than for other subgroups.1 ± 3 When the analyses
were repeated limiting the sample to white children
and adults, the general ®ndings were unchanged.
These changes might represent either a differential
response to changing environmental conditions, or a
subset increasingly exposed to changing environmen-
tal conditions, or possibly some combination of
differential exposure and differential response. These
data do not permit these effects to be disentangled.
However, these ®ndings are not inconsistent with a
gene ± environment interaction effect. The factors that
are causing the increase in obesity appear to operate
broadly and have an effect on the distribution of BMI
for almost the entire adult population, but to have a
stronger effect on the upper portion of the distribution,
suggesting there may be a subgroup of the population
that is more susceptible to these in¯uences. These data
also broadly support Rose's suggestion that changes in
the upper portion of the distribution re¯ect changes
occurring in the whole distribution.5
This interpretation is less true for children, how-
ever. For children, particularly younger children, and
to some extent also for adolescents and young men,
the main effect appears to be on the upper part of the
distribution of BMI. This suggests that, for these
groups, the increase in prevalence is chie¯y due to
the heaviest individuals being heavier in NHANES III
than were the heaviest individuals in earlier surveys.
This is consistent with Price's ®ndings for secular
trends in overweight among young Danish inductees,
in which BMI could be modeled as a mixture of
distributions of a `normal' and `overweight' compo-
nent.14 Secular trends in overweight among young
Danish men could be explained by an increase in the
proportion in the overweight component, with no
change in the mean of either the normal or the over-
weight component, leading to the speculation that the
increases in overweight might represent a differential
response to environmental change, possibly mediated
by genotype. Although methodological differences
preclude exact comparisons, our ®ndings for children,
adolescents and young men, showing only small or no
shifts in the lower part of the distribution but with a
much larger shift in the upper portion of the distribu-
tion, are consistent with the notion of a differential
response in these age groups. For older men, however,
our data suggest a more uniform response affecting all
portions of the distribution.
Many investigations of BMI phenotypes suggest
that BMI can often be modeled as a mixture of several
components, although ®ndings about the number and
characteristics of these components vary from study
to study.15,21,22 These shifts over time in the distribu-
tions of BMI, which appear to vary by sex and age,
may affect such phenotypic comparisons of BMI and
could make it more dif®cult to ®nd stable models for
these distributions.23,24
Rose and Day examined cross-sectional data on
blood pressure, BMI, alcohol intake and sodium
intake from 52 populations in the Intersalt study and
found that the distributions of most health related
characteristics appeared to move up and down as a
whole so that the population mean predicted the
number of deviant individuals.5 In the case of BMI,
however, the distributions of BMI in the populations
with higher values were not only shifted upward but
also tended to become more skewed.6 This increasing
skewness is similar to that seen in the NHANES data
for adults, where small increases in mean and median
BMI values are accompanied by greater than expected
increases in the prevalence of high values because of
the increasing skewness.
Within a given population, differences in character-
istics such as serum cholesterol probably re¯ect prin-
cipally genetic variability with some effects of be-
havioral differences. However, the large differences
seen between populations in characteristics such as
serum cholesterol suggest profound effects of social

and environmental determinants of such characteris-
tics. The environment includes not just the physical
environment, but also social and cultural forces affect-
ing work, leisure, time allocation, food patterns and
availability, psychological factors and many other
determinants. These trends in BMI suggest the com-
bination of both profound environmental determinants
at work and a population with a high degree of
susceptibility. Following the line of thought put
forth by Rose,4 ± 6 this would imply that the reasons
for the increasing prevalence of obesity should be
sought not by comparing obese and non-obese indi-
viduals but rather by seeking to understand what
factors are causing increases in the population as a
whole. Interventions may need to focus on the popu-
lation rather than solely on the heaviest individuals.
