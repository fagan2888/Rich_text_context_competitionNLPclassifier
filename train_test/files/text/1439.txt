Microalbuminuria, a biomarker of endothelial 
dysfunction, is
associated with increased cardiovascular, renal, and cerebro
vascular morbidity and mortality.1­5 Its presence in hyper
tension, even in the setting of normal renal function, confers
additional risk for cardiovascular disease.6 Microalbuminuria
is a common finding in diabetes and hypertension, respec
tively, the first and second leading causes of end-stage renal
disease in the United States. Both diseases disproportion
ately affect racial and ethnic minorities, but the relationship
between hypertension and 
diabetes and microalbuminuria in
relation to race/ethnicity is not completely understood.
Previous studies have examined the relationship between
microalbuminuriaandhypertension,7­11 buttoour
knowledge,
no one has examined racial or ethnic differences in the preva
lence of microalbuminuria among the JNC 7 blood pressure
(BP) categories, especially prehypertension and persons with
treated controlled hypertension. The objective of this analysis
was to use recent data from the National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey (NHANES) to compare the prevalence
of microalbuminuria by JNC 7 BP categories and to exam
ine racial and ethnic differences in microalbuminuria among
adults with hypertension, prehypertension, and treated con
trolled hypertension.

NHANES is an ongoing, cross-sectional, and nationally

representative survey designed to measure the health and
nutritional status of noninstitutionalized US civilians. The

Control and Prevention conducts the NHANES. The survey

Background
Microalbuminuria, a biomarker of endothelial dysfunction, is
associated with increased cardiovascular, renal, and cerebrovascular
morbidity and mortality, especially among ethnic minorities.
Methods
A total of 16,567 adults in the National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey (NHANES) from 1999 through 2006 were
categorized according to JNC 7 blood pressure (BP) definitions.
Microalbuminuria was defined as spot urinary albumin/creatinine
ratio (ACR) of 30­299mg/g. Logistic regression estimated the odds
of having microalbuminuria among BP categories compared with
normal BP after adjusting for age, race/ethnicity, sex, education level,
smoking status, body mass index (BMI), systolic BP, and diabetes.
Results
Prevalence of microalbuminuria was 4.5% for normal BP, 6.3%
for prehypertension, 12.4% for stage 1 hypertension, 25.3% for
stage 2 hypertension, and 11.3% among those with treated,
controlled hypertension. Compared with participants with normal
BP, the adjusted odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CIs)
for microalbuminuria were 1.3 (1.0­1.7, P = 0.03) for those with
prehypertension, 2.3 (1.8­3.0, P < 0.01) with stage 1 hypertension,
4.8 (3.7­6.3 P < 0.01) with stage 2 hypertension, and 1.6 (1.3­2.1,
P < 0.01) with treated, controlled hypertension.The treated controlled
hypertension group exhibited the strongest race­ethnicity gradient.
Conclusions
Participants with hypertension and prehypertension had a higher
likelihood of microalbuminuria than those with normal BP, especially
ethnic minorities, suggesting greater target organ damage. Our
observations suggest that further research is necessary to determine
whether microalbuminuria can be used as a screening tool in
adults with prehypertension, to identify adults at highest risk for
cardiovascular disease or decline in renal function.

data were collected continuously from 1999 through 2006 but
released in 2-year increments. Informed consent was obtained
and approval for the survey granted by the National Center
for Health Statistics Research Ethics Review Board. Data were

collected in two steps: a home interview followed by a detailed
physical examination and laboratory tests in a mobile exami
nation center.
Of the 18,986 adults aged 20 years, who were interviewed
and examined, 16,567 (87.7% of those eligible) met the criteria
for inclusion in our study after we excluded pregnant women
(n = 1,082), and adults with missing values due to item non
response for BP (n = 760), urinary albumin and/or urinary
creatinine (n = 382) or both (n = 195). In addition, data for
participants whose body mass index (BMI) (n = 301), 
smoking
status (n = 18), and education level (n = 25) could not be
determined due to item nonresponse were excluded from the
appropriate analyses.
Measurement of BP, urinary albumin, and creatinine concen-
trations. Licensed physicians measured participants' BP in the
mobile examination center according to the American Heart
Association's standardized protocols.12 Participants who
reported currently taking any antihypertensive medication,
had an average systolic BP of 140mmHg, or had an average
diastolic BP of 90mmHg were classified as having hyper
tension. The mean of all available BP readings was used for
this analysis. BP was then categorized according to the JNC
7 report.6
BP was classified as normal if the average systolic BP
was <120mmHg and the average diastolic BP was <80mmHg.
Prehypertension was defined as an average systolic BP of
120­139mmHg or an average diastolic BP of 80­89mmHg.
Hypertension was further classified into two stages: stage 1
hypertension (an average systolic BP of 140­159mmHg or
an average diastolic BP of 90­99mmHg) and stage 2 hyper
tension (an average systolic BP of 160mmHg or an average
diastolic BP of 100mmHg). A higher category for classifi
cation was used if the systolic BP and diastolic BP levels fell
into different categories. Participants taking antihypertensive
medications were defined as having their BP controlled if
their systolic BP was <140mmHg and their diastolic BP was
<90mmHg. Persons taking antihypertensive medications were
defined as stage 1 hypertension if their systolic BP was between
140 and 159mmHg or their diastolic BP was between 90 and
99mmHg; otherwise they were defined as stage 2 hyperten
sion if either value exceeded that cut point.
Urinary albumin and creatinine concentrations were meas
ured according to established protocol.13 The spot 
urinary
albumin/creatinine ratio (ACR) was measured in milli
grams per gram (mg/g) and classified as normal (ACR <30),
microalbuminuria (ACR 30­299), and macroalbuminuria
(ACR >300).
Selected characteristics of the study population. Socio
demographic information about participants was obtained
by interviews conducted in the participants' homes. Age was
documented at the screening interview. Race was determined
by self-reported responses to race and ethnicity was defined
according to Hispanic origin. Race/ethnicity was then cate
gorized by NHANES as non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic
black, Mexican American, or all other (other Hispanics,
Asians, Native Americans, or participants who self-reported
as more than one race/ethnic group). Smoking status was
defined as never smoked, current smoker (i.e., participants
have smoked 100 cigarettes in their lifetime and are still smok
ing), and former smoker (i.e., participants have smoked at
least 100 cigarettes in their lifetimes but do not smoke now).
Anthropometric dimensions were obtained by a trained exam
iner and used to calculate BMI (weight in kg divided by height
in m2). BMI was then classified as underweight (<18.5kg/m2),
normal (18.5­24.9kg/m2), overweight (25.0­29.9kg/m2), or
obese (30kg/
m2).14 Diabetes mellitus was defined by self-
report of physician diagnosis of "diabetes or sugar diabetes" or
current use of medications for diabetes mellitus.
Statistical analysis. Statistical analysis was conducted with
SAS software, version 9.1 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). The data
were weighted appropriately by using mobile examination
center examination sampling weights to adjust for population
distribution and nonresponse. An 8-year weight variable was
created by assigning 1/2 of the 4-year weight for 1999­2002 if
the person was sampled in 1999­2002 or assigning 1/4 of the
2-year weight for 2003­2004 and 2005­2006 if the person was
sampled in 2003­2004 or 2005­2006.15 We adjusted for the
complex sampling design of NHANES with SUDAAN software
(Research Triangle Institute, Research Triangle Park, NC). All
tests were based on a statistical significance level of P  0.05.
A detailed description of the survey and its sampling tech
niques has been published elsewhere.15­18 Differences in
selected characteristics among the BP groups were compared
by 2-tests. Multivariate logistic regression was used to esti
mate the odds and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for micro
albuminuria among JNC 7 categories compared with normal
BP after adjusting for age, race/ethnicity, sex, education level,
smoking status, BMI, and the presence of diabetes melli
tus (defined as self-report of physician diagnosis of "diabetes
or sugar diabetes" or current use of medications for diabetes

mellitus). A second multivariate model added systolic BP to
the other covariates to determine whether racial or ethnic dif
ferences observed in participants with higher BP levels also
could account for any observed differences in microalbu
minuria on the basis of race or ethnicity. For racial or ethnic
comparisons among the hypertension and prehypertension
subgroups, 
multivariate logistic regression models included
participants of races/ethnicities other than non-Hispanic white
(the 
referent), non-Hispanic black, and Mexican American,
but the results were not reported.

treated controlled, BP levels. The characteristics of the four BP
stages as well as the treated controlled hypertensives are shown
in Table 1. The proportions of young participants (<45 years),
participants with >12 years of education, and current smokers
declined with higher BP category (Table 1). The proportion of
non-Hispanic blacks increased with BP levels. Prehypertension
and stage 1 hypertension categories had greater proportions of
men (61.3 and 51.7%, respectively) than other BP categories.
Overall, the prevalence of microalbuminuria was 4.5%
(95% CI, 3.9­5.3%) for normal BP, 6.3% (95% CI, 5.4­7.3%)
for prehypertension, 13.4% (95% CI, 11.8­15.2%) for stage 1
hypertension, and 25.3% (95% CI, 22.8­28.1%) for stage 2
hypertension and 11.3% (95% CI, 9.9­12.9%) among those
with controlled, treated hypertension (Table 2).
Compared with participants with normal BP, the adjusted
odds ratios and 95% CI for participants with 
microalbuminuria
were 1.3 (1.0­1.7, P = 0.03) for prehypertension, 2.3 (95% CI,
1.8­3.0, P < 0.01) for stage 1 hypertension, 4.8 (95% CI, 3.7­
6.3, P < 0.01) for stage 2 hypertension, and 1.6 (95% CI, 1.3­
2.1, P < 0.01) for treated, controlled, hypertension.
The prevalence of microalbuminuria increased among all
racial/ethnic groups (all P < 0.05) with increasing BP 
levels
(Figure 1). When the magnitude of the differences in the

prevalence of microalbuminuria between participants with
uncontrolled hypertension and participants with normal BP
levels was compared, we observed an approximately fourfold
difference among non-Hispanic whites (P = 0.0001), a fivefold
difference among non-Hispanic blacks(P = 0.0001), and a six
fold difference among Mexican Americans(P = 0.0001).

as self-report of physician diagnosis of "diabetes or sugar

ariates, showed that among participants with prehypertension,
there was a higher adjusted odds ratio for having microalbu
minuria among non-Hispanic blacks (1.4; 95% CI, 1.0­2.0; P =
0.05) and Mexican Americans (1.6; 95% CI, 1.1­2.4; P = 0.02)
than for non-Hispanic whites (Table 3). Similarly, higher odds
ratios were obtained for those with treated, controlled hyper
tension, and uncontrolled hypertension. In multivariate logis
tic regression model 2 (Table 3), systolic BP was included as a
covariate in addition to the covariates included in model 1. In
this model, the magnitude of racial or ethnic differences among
non-Hispanic blacks and Mexican Americans remained the
same for the treated, controlled hypertension group, but was
reduced in the uncontrolled hypertension group (Table 3). We
conducted a formal test of interaction of race­ethnicity and BP
categories and there was no interaction (P = 0.45).
Discussion
NHANES participants with hypertension and prehypertension
had higher odds of having microalbuminuria than participants
with normal BP. We observed that 6.3% of participants with
prehypertension already had evidence of kidney damage in the
form of microalbuminuria. Participants with prehypertension
had 30% greater odds of microalbuminuria than participants
with normal BP. A higher prevalence of microalbuminuria
was observed among ethnic minorities with hypertension and
prehypertension than among non-Hispanic whites in these
BP categories. The finding that the adjustment for systolic BP
reduced the odds ratio for microalbuminuria among Mexican
Americans and non-Hispanic blacks supports the argument
that racial and ethnic minorities may have higher BP levels and
greater target organ disease. After adjusting for differing levels
of systolic BP, the odds of having microalbuminuria among
persons with hypertension remained significantly higher
among racial and ethnic minorities. This finding suggests that
other factors, such as access to health care or comorbidities,
also may play a role in this excess risk.
Several NHANES studies also have examined the asso
ciation between microalbuminuria and various conditions,
such as diabetes, metabolic syndrome, hypercholesterolemia,

hepatitis C, and elevated C-reactive protein.19­23 The preva
lence of microalbuminuria was 13.4% for stage 1 hypertension
and 25.3% for stage 2 hypertension in the present study. This
finding is similar to the documented prevalence of microalbu
minuria among adults with hypertension, which ranges from
8 to 23%.1
A strong relationship between microalbuminuria, BP level,
and increased risk for renal and cardiovascular disease among
persons with established hypertension has been previously
described in several cross-sectional and clinical studies.3,24­26

patients at high risk for microalbuminuria. The detection of
microalbuminuria, a biomarker of cardiovascular risk may
prompt consideration for earlier screening in this group of
prehypertension.
Although several cohort and clinical studies have examined
associations between microalbuminuria and hypertension, our
study is the first to report racial and ethnic variations in micro
albuminuria among defined JNC 7 BP categories in addition
to the treated, controlled hypertension group. Knight et al.9
examined the association between high-normal BP (systolic
BP of 130­139mmHg and diastolic BP of 85­89mmHg) on
the basis of JNC 6 classification and microalbuminuria. They
found that high-normal BP was associated with increased
odds of microalbuminuria.9 Although we used the JNC 7 as
opposed to the JNC 6 classification, we also demonstrated that
adults with prehypertension had higher odds of microalbu
minuria. In our study, among persons with either hypertension
or prehypertension, both non-Hispanic blacks and Mexican
Americans had higher odds of developing microalbuminuria
than non-Hispanic whites.
Previous studies that stratified by the presence of diabetes in
the NHANES population showed that racial and ethnic minori
ties had greater odds of microalbuminuria compared with
whites.11,19 No comparisons were made between hypertension
categories. In our analysis, we adjusted for the presence of dia
betes rather than stratify because of small numbers; our results,
however, remained significant, although the effects of diabetes
on microalbuminuria may be underrepresented in Mexican
Americans in our analysis. A major strength of our study is
that NHANES is a nationally representative sample of the US
noninstitutionalized population. However, because NHANES
is a cross-sectional survey, we could only examine associations
and could not determine causality. In addition, we combined
NHANES data from 1999 to 2006 to create a larger study popu
lation with a sizeable representation of racial and ethnic groups.
The limitations of our study include the use of spot measure
ments of urinary albumin and creatinine. These measurements
may differ because of laboratory and intraperson variability
and by sex and ethnicity.27 In addition, persistent microalbu
minuria also has been used as a measure of chronic kidney
disease.28 However, the use of spot ACR is recommended by
JNC 7 as a reliable measurement of albuminuria.6 As a cross-
sectional study, the detailed history of hypertension of the
individual respondent is not known. For example, a partici
pant with untreated hypertension for several years, resulting in
renal dysfunction in form of microalbuminuria, may now have
controlled BP.
As expected, those with treated, controlled hypertension
had lower prevalence of microalbuminuria, even though, still
higher compared to normal BP, indicating the importance of
early treatment.
Our observations indicate that adults with prehypertension
and hypertension may require earlier screening and pharma
cologic intervention for microalbuminuria. Rapid progression
from prehypertension to hypertension can occur over 4 years,
as seen in the Framingham study;29 therefore, early screening
for microalbuminuria, especially in adults with prehyperten
sion and stage 1 hypertension, may be beneficial. This approach
could identify adults who may need earlier pharmacologic
intervention with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or
angiotensin receptor blocker treatment and clinical follow-up,
thus preventing the progression of microalbuminuria.
Given that the current treatment recommendation for
patients with prehypertension is the adoption of a healthy

aPrehypertension (average systolic BP of 120­139mmHg or average diastolic BP of 80­89mmHg). bUncontrolled hypertension (average systolic BP 140mmHg, an average diastolic
BP 90mmHg, taking antihypertensive medications). cTreated, controlled hypertension (taking antihypertensive medications, average systolic BP <140mmHg and average diastolic
BP <90mmHg). dMultivariate logistic regression model 1 included age, race/ethnicity, sex, education level, smoking status, body mass index, and diabetes as covariates. The model
excluded 372 participants with macroalbuminuria. eMultivariate logistic regression model 2 included age, race, sex, education level, smoking status, body mass index, diabetes, and
average systolic blood pressure as covariates.The model excluded 372 participants with macroalbuminuria.

lifestyle (except for patients with diabetes or chronic renal
disease), our observations suggest that further research is
necessary to determine if microalbuminuria can be used as
a screening tool in adults with prehypertension, to identify
adults at highest risk for cardiovascular disease or decline in
renal function.
