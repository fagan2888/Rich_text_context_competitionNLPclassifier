ADIPOSE TISSUE PREVIOUSLY WAS
considered a passive storage
depot for fat but is now
known to play an active role
in metabolism.1,2 Among the recently
discovered compounds expressed in
human adipose tissue is the proinflam-
matory cytokine interleukin 6 (IL-6).3,4
Moreover, IL-6 produced in the adi-
pose tissue of healthy humans is re-
leased into the circulation.4,5 Adipose
tissue is estimated to produce about
25% of the systemic IL-6 in vivo.4 Be-
cause of the inflammatory properties of
IL-6, including the stimulation of acute-
phase protein production in the liver,6,7
the release of IL-6 from adipose tissue
may induce low-grade systemic inflam-
mation in persons with excess body fat.

flammationistheacute-phaseC-reactive

METHODS
Survey Design and Data Sources
The study included 16 616 adult par-
ticipants of the Third National Health
and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANESIII),1988-1994.NHANESIII
was conducted by the National Center
for Health Statistics of the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention.14 The
survey had a complex, stratified, mul-
tistage probability-cluster design for se-
lecting a sample of approximately
40 000 persons representative of the
noninstitutionalized civilian US popu-
lation. Children younger than 5 years,
persons aged 60 years or older, Mexi-
can American persons, and non-
Hispanic blacks were sampled at higher
rates than others. Eighty-one percent

Context Human adipose tissue expresses and releases the proinflammatory cyto-
kine interleukin 6, potentially inducing low-grade systemic inflammation in persons
with excess body fat.
Objective To test whether overweight and obesity are associated with low-grade
systemic inflammation as measured by serum C-reactive protein (CRP) level.
Design and Setting The Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey,
representative of the US population from 1988 to 1994.
Participants A total of 16 616 men and nonpregnant women aged 17 years or older.
Main Outcome Measures Elevated CRP level of 0.22 mg/dL or more and a more
stringent clinically raised CRP level of more than 1.00 mg/dL.
Results Elevated CRP levels and clinically raised CRP levels were present in 27.6% and
6.7% of the population, respectively. Both overweight (body mass index [BMI], 25-29.9
kg/m2) and obese (BMI, 30 kg/m2) persons were more likely to have elevated CRP
levels than their normal-weight counterparts (BMI, 25 kg/m2). After adjustment for
potential confounders, including smoking and health status, the odds ratio (OR) for el-
evated CRP was 2.13 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.56-2.91) for obese men and 6.21
(95% CI, 4.94-7.81) for obese women. In addition, BMI was associated with clinically
raised CRP levels in women, with an OR of 4.76 (95% CI, 3.42-6.61) for obese wom-
en. Waist-to-hip ratio was positively associated with both elevated and clinically raised
CRP levels, independent of BMI. Restricting the analyses to young adults (aged 17-39
years) and excluding smokers, persons with inflammatory disease, cardiovascular dis-
ease, or diabetes mellitus and estrogen users did not change the main findings.
Conclusion Higher BMI is associated with higher CRP concentrations, even among
young adults aged 17 to 39 years. These findings suggest a state of low-grade sys-
temic inflammation in overweight and obese persons.

of all eligible adults consented to an ini-
tial interview in their household. Of the
20 050 persons aged 17 years or older
who were interviewed, 18 162 were
subsequently examined in a mobile ex-
amination center or in their homes. Per-
sons with missing data on height, body
weight, or serum CRP level (n = 1239)
and pregnant women (n = 307, vali-
dated by urine pregnancy test) were ex-
cluded, leaving 16 616 persons (7938
men and 8678 women) available for the
statistical analyses.
Body weight and height were
measured using standardized proce-
dures.15 Bodymassindex(BMI)wascal-
culated as weight in kilograms divided
by the square of height in meters and
used as an indicator of body fat.16,17 The
1998 clinical guidelines18 were used to
defineoverweight(BMI,25-29.9kg/m2)
and obesity (BMI 30 kg/m2).
Waist circumference was measured
at the level of the high point of the iliac
crest and the circumference at the level
of maximum extension of the but-
tocks.15 The waist-to-hip ratio, calcu-
lated as waist circumference divided by
hip circumference, was used as an in-
dicator of abdominal visceral fat.19
Serum specimens for the measure-
ment of CRP were stored at -70°C and
analyzed within 2 months after phle-
botomy. C-reactive protein was ana-
lyzed using a modification of the Beh-
ring Latex-Enhanced CRP assay on the
Behring Nephelometer Analyzer Sys-
tem (Behring Diagnostics, Westwood,
Mass) (M.H.W., Phyllis R. Daum, MT
[ASCP], G.M.M., unpublished data,
1999). Both within- and between-assay
qualitycontrolprocedureswereusedand
thecoefficientofvariationofthemethod
was 3.2% to 16.1% through the period
of data collection. The assay could de-
tectaminimalCRPconcentrationof0.22
mg/dL, and values below this level were
classified as undetectable. The assay was
designed primarily to detect inflamma-
tion and was included as part of the
NHANES III cohort to help detect in-
flammationasaconfoundingvariablefor
interpretation of nutrition markers. Be-
cause most individuals had values less
than the minimum detectable concen-
tration, CRP is treated as a categorical
rather than a continuous variable.
Racewasdefinedbyself-reportasnon-
Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, or
MexicanAmerican.Peopleoutsidethese
categorieswereclassifiedasother.Smok-
ing status was based on self-report and
categorized as never, former, or current
smoking. All persons with a serum co-
tinine concentration of more than 57
nmol/L (10 ng/mL)20 as measured by
high-performance liquid chromatogra-
phy and atmospheric-pressure chemi-
cal ionization tandem mass spectros-
copy21 were categorized as current
smokers, irrespective of self-report. In-
flammatory disease prevalence was de-
termined through self-report of physi-
cian-diagnosed conditions (chronic
bronchitis, asthma, emphysema, and
rheumatoid arthritis) and self-report of
"having a cold" in the past few days. A
serumtubedilutionlatexfixationtestfor
rheumatoid factor was assessed in per-
sons aged 60 years or older.22 All per-
sons with a positive test result (1:40
titer) were categorized as having rheu-
matoid arthritis or a related inflam-
matory disorder, irrespective of self-
report. Cardiovascular disease included
self-reported physician-diagnosed myo-
cardial infarction and stroke and an-
gina as assessed by the Rose Angina
Questionnaire.23 Diabetes mellitus was
defined as self-reported physician-
diagnosed diabetes mellitus with insu-
linuseor,inthecaseofundiagnoseddia-
betes mellitus, a fasting plasma glucose
level of at least 6.99 mmol/L (126
mg/dL).24,25 Estrogen use was based on
self-report, categorized as contracep-
tive medications (oral or implant) or es-
trogen replacement therapy.
Statistical Analyses
The study population was divided into
2 categories based on CRP concentra-
tion, undetectable (0.22 mg/dL) and
elevated (0.22 mg/dL). The popula-
tion was also divided into 2 categories
based on the conventional clinical cut
point for inflammation, a CRP concen-
tration of more than 1.00 mg/dL. Two
outcome variables were defined: el-
evated CRP level (0.22 mg/dL), which
was compared with undetectable CRP,
and clinically raised CRP level (1.00
mg/dL), which was compared with CRP
levelofnomorethan1.00mg/dL.Within
each sex, the relationship between BMI
and CRPconcentrationcategory was ex-
amined by multiple logistic regression
analysis.Wecalculatedoddsratios(ORs)
and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for
BMI as a categorical variable according
to the clinical guidelines, with normal
weight (BMI 25 kg/m2) as the refer-
ence category, and for BMI as a continu-
ous variable, expressed per 5-kg/m2
(about 1 SD) increment. Moreover, ORs
per SD increment of waist-to-hip ratio
(0.1 units) were calculated. Adjust-
mentsweremadeforpotentialconfound-
ers, including age, race, smoking
status, estrogen use, inflammatory dis-
ease, and other diseases associated with
low-grade inflammation, including car-
diovascular disease8,26,27 and diabetes
mellitus.28 To assess potential effect
modificationbyage,smokingstatus,dis-
ease status, or estrogen use, the analy-
ses were repeated, restricted to young
(aged 17-39 years), healthy non­
estrogen-using nonsmokers. Odds ra-
tios do not approximate risk ratios when
the prevalence of the outcome variable
in the study population is greater than
10%.29 The calculated OR for elevated
CRP concentration therefore should not
be interpreted as a risk ratio. Analyses
were performed using SAS (SAS Insti-
tute Inc, Cary, NC) and SUDAAN (Re-
search Triangle Institute, Research Tri-
angle Park, NC) and incorporated
sampling weights to account for over-
samplingandnonresponsetothehouse-
hold interview and examination.30 Vari-
ance estimates were calculated with
SUDAAN, incorporating the complex
sampling design of NHANES III.30

in both men and women (FIGURE).
However, with increasing BMI the
prevalence of clinically raised CRP level
increased among women only; the
prevalence was 4.0% (95% CI, 3.3%-
4.8%) in normal-weight women, 7.7%
(95% CI, 6.4%-9.4%) in overweight
women, and 20.2% (95% CI, 18.1%-
22.5%) in obese women.
Obese men were 2.13 times more
likelyandobesewomen6.21timesmore
likely to have elevated CRP levels com-
pared with their normal-weight coun-
terparts(TABLE 2).Per1-SDincreasein
BMI, men were 1.38 and women were
2.04 times more likely to have elevated
CRPlevels.Amongwomen,BMIwasalso
associatedwithclinicallyraisedCRPlev-
els.Obesewomenwere4.76timesmore
likely to have clinically raised CRP lev-
elscomparedwithnormal-weightwom-
en. Per 1-SD increment in BMI, wom-
en were 1.69 times more likely to have
clinically raised CRP levels.
The waist-to-hip ratio was indepen-
dentlyassociatedwithbothelevatedand
clinically raised CRP levels in men and
women. Per 1-SD increase in waist-to-
hip ratio, men were 1.41 and women
were 1.21 times more likely to have el-
evated CRP levels (Table 2). The OR for
clinically raised CRP levels per 1-SD in-
crease in waist-to-hip ratio was 1.36 in
men and 1.28 in women.
The association between BMI and
CRP was also investigated after stratifi-
cation by age group (young = 17-39
years; middle-aged = 40-59 years;
old = 60 years). Among women, the
association between BMI and CRP cat-
egories was influenced by age group.
Older obese women were less likely to
have elevated or clinically raised CRP
levels than young obese women. A simi-
lar effect modification by age group in
womenwasobservedusingBMIasacat-
egorical variable. No effect modifica-
tion by age group was observed in men.
To avoid any potential effect modi-
fication by age, inflammatory disease,
cardiovascular disease, diabetes melli-
tus, current smoking, or estrogen use,
the analyses were repeated restricted to
healthy, nonsmoking, non­estrogen-
using persons aged 17 to 39 years. The
positive association between BMI cat-
egory and elevated CRP level re-
mained statistically significant after ad-
justment for age, race, smoking status
(never and former smoking only), and
waist-to-hip ratio (TABLE 3). In this re-
stricted analysis, BMI also remained
positively associated with clinically
raised CRP levels among women.
COMMENT
Previous studies in middle-aged and el-
derly persons have reported a positive
association between BMI and CRP con-
centration.12,26,27 However, in these age
groups, the association may have been
confounded by disease. Rheumatoid ar-
thritis, diabetes mellitus, and cardio-
vascular disease are prevalent diseases

in older persons and are associated with
both obesity31-33 and increased CRP con-
centrations.8,26-28,34 We carefully con-
trolled for inflammatory disease and
other factors known to influence CRP
concentrations. A higher prevalence of
low-grade systemic inflammation was
observed in overweight and obese per-
sons compared with normal-weight per-
sons. Most importantly, our study ex-
tends these findings to young adults
aged 17 to 39 years, in whom the preva-
lence of any confounding subclinical
disease is generally very low. Of inter-
est is our observation that the distri-
bution of body fat is associated with
CRP concentration independent of BMI.
A high waist-to-hip ratio, indicative of
a large amount of abdominal visceral
fat, was associated with low-grade sys-
temic inflammation in men and women.
Ourresults,togetherwiththeevidence
ofpreviousstudies,haveimportantim-
plications for the health risks of over-
weightandobeseindividuals,including
thoseatyoungages.BasedonNHANES
III data, we estimated that 53.9% of US
adults aged 17 years or older are over-
weight or obese. Overweight, obesity,
andalargewaist-to-hipratioposeacon-
siderable health risk, including cardio-
vascularhealth.33,35-37 Low-gradesystemic
inflammationhasbeenshowntoincrease
the risk for cardiovascular disease.9-13
Someoftheincreasedriskforcardiovas-
cular disease in overweight and obese
personsmaybeexplainedbyourobser-
vationthatincreasedCRPconcentrations
are more prevalent in these persons.
C-reactiveproteinconcentrationswell
below the conventional clinical upper
limit of normal of 1 mg/dL have been as-
sociated with a 2- to 3-fold increase in
risk of myocardial infarction, ischemic
stroke, and peripheral arterial disease in
healthy men and women.9-13 In addi-
tion, elevated CRP levels are predictive
of cardiac complications inpatients with
unstable angina or myocardial infarc-
tion38,39 and CRP induces the produc-
tion of tissue factor, a potent procoagu-
lant, in monocytes.40 Moreover, elevated
CRP concentrations are associated with
increased coronary heart disease mor-
tality and total mortality.9,41
Approximately25%ofcirculatingIL-6
isestimatedtobereleasedbyhumansub-
cutaneous adipose tissue in vivo,2 and
IL-6 stimulates the production of acute-
phase proteins in the liver.6,7 This might
explain the observed associations be-
tweenBMIandCRP.Invitro,humanab-
dominal visceral adipose tissue releases
more IL-6 compared with subcutane-
ous adipose tissue,5 possibly explaining
our observation that a higher waist-to-
hip ratio, after adjustment for BMI and
several confounders, was indepen-
dentlyassociatedwithelevatedCRPlevel.
Body mass index is an important
clinicalindicatorofoverweightand obe-
sity,18 but its use as an indicator of body
fatness has limitations. At a similar BMI,
women have more body fat than men.42
Thisdifferencewasreflectedinour data,
showing a higher prevalence of el-
evated and clinically raised CRP levels
in women compared with men in over-
weight and obese persons (Figure). The
higher prevalence of elevated and clini-
cally raised CRP levels among obese
women compared with obese men
could also be due to by the fact that
women were more likely to be ex-
tremely obese: a BMI of 35 to 40 kg/m2
was prevalent among 3.4% of men and
6.4% of women, and a BMI of 40 kg/m2
or more was present among 1.7% of
men and 3.6% of women. Both phe-
nomena might also explain why BMI
was associated with clinically raised
CRP levels in women but not men.
Persons with a normal body weight
(BMI 25 kg/m2) were used as the ref-
erence group. However, this group in-
cluded a small percentage (1.3% of men
and 3.8% of women) of underweight
persons (BMI 18.5 kg/m2) who might
be more likely to be in poor health, with
associated higher CRP concentra-
tions. However, when the analyses were

repeated after exclusion of under-
weight people in the reference group,
similar results were obtained.
Because the lower detection limit of
the CRP assay was 0.22 mg/dL, serum
CRPlevelwasusedasacategoricalvari-
able.Itisunlikelythattheuseofamore
sensitiveassaywouldhavechangedthe
conclusions of the study. The associa-
tion between obesity and CRP concen-
tration was observed regardless of the
CRP cut point that was used (0.22 or
1.00mg/dL).Second,althoughthecut

calstudieshaveshownanincreasedrisk

We used a single CRP measurement
that may not accurately reflect long-
term inflammation status. The biologi-
cal variability of CRP is substantial, with
reported values ranging from 10.6% to
63.0%.43-46 However, because random
misclassification due to biological vari-
ability will lead to underestimation of
true associations, this limitation is un-
likely to explain our findings.
Measurements of the serum concen-
tration of IL-6 were not available in the
present study. Although the results sup-
port the hypothesis that IL-6 pro-
duced by the adipocytes increase CRP
concentration, direct assessment of IL-6
concentration is needed in future stud-
ies to further test this hypothesis.
In conclusion, the results of this
large-scale cross-sectional study show
that higher BMI is associated with
higher CRP concentrations that could
not be explained by inflammatory dis-
ease or other factors or diseases known
to increase CRP concentrations. Be-
cause these associations also were ob-
served among young adults aged 17 to
39 years, subclinical disease is un-
likely to explain our findings. These
data suggest that a state of low-grade
systemic inflammation is present in
overweight and obese persons.
