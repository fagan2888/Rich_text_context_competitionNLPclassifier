The psychological needs, mental factors, and personal pecu-
liarities of learners are proven to be of paramount importance
when we seek to develop a reliable and well-informed theory
of teaching and achieve the crème de la crème out of the
classroom practice (Lightbown & Spada, 2006). According
to Ryan and Deci (2000, 2002), a psychological need is an
inherent source of motivation for learners that generates a
proactive desire to interact with the environment to advance
one's personal growth, social development, and psychologi-
cal well-being. The three psychological needs central to
learners are autonomy (AU), competence, and relatedness
(Deci, Vallerand, Pelletier, & Ryan, 1991). Learners need to
feel autonomous, competent, and related to others to grow, to
make progress, and to be, by and large, well (O'Donnell,
Reeve, & Smith, 2012).
AU is the psychological need to experience self-direction
in the initiation and regulation of one's behavior (Deci &
Ryan, 1985). Current English as a foreign language (EFL)
pedagogical trends seem to primarily focus on a student-
centered methodology in which learner AU is given a great
value (Akbari, 2008; Bell, 2003; Benson, 2003). This is to
say that EFL learners are now given a meaningful role in
pedagogic decision making by being treated as active and
autonomous players (Kumaravadivelu, 2008, 2012).
Accordingly, language learners are becoming the focus of
curricula design (Nation & Macalister, 2010), and research-
ers are recognizing the significant role of learner AU in their
teaching (Bell, 2003; Benson, 2003; O'Donnell et al., 2012).
AU, according to Scharle and Szabó (2000), is the free-
dom and ability to manage one's own affairs, which entails
the right to make decisions as well. An autonomous person,
according to Paul and Elder (2008), is not dependent on oth-
ers for the direction and control of one's thinking. They
assert that it is the self-authorship on one's beliefs, values,
and ways of thinking. The basis of learner AU, according to
Chang (2007), is that learner accepts responsibility for his or
her learning. Little (1995) argues that the pursuit of AU in a
formal educational context is a matter of both learning and
learning how to learn.

Metacognitive Attributes and Liberated
Progress: The Association Among
Second-Language Learners' Critical
Thinking, Creativity, and Autonomy
Mania Nosratinia1 and Alireza Zaker2
Abstract
Owing to the cardinal and acknowledged importance of autonomy (AU) in learning, especially second-language learning,
and influenced by the importance of inspecting its nature and the way it is associated with other psychological/cognitive/
metacognitive factors, this research investigated the relationship among English as a foreign language (EFL) learners' AU,
creativity (CR), and critical thinking (CT). The population for this study comprised of undergraduate EFL learners, between
the ages of 19 and 40 (M
age
= 22 years), from which 182 male and female subjects were selected via random selection. These
participants, who were receiving formal instruction mainly through English, filled out three questionnaires related to CR, CT,
and AU. Pearson's product­moment correlation coefficient was used to analyze the data obtained. The results indicated that
there is a significant and positive relationship between EFL learners' CR and AU, CR and CT, as well as their CT and AU.
Considering AU as the predicted variable for this study, it was confirmed that CT makes the strongest unique contribution
to explain AU. It is hoped that the results of this study will reveal the nature of AU more and will equip EFL teachers with a
wider perspective on the characteristics of AU and the way CR and CT can predict and promote AU among EFL learners.

2 SAGE Open
A very obvious reason for promoting learner AU is that
teacher may not always be available for guiding or instruct-
ing. Therefore, according to Nation and Macalister (2010),
AU proffers learners the capability to know "how to learn a
language and how to monitor and be aware of their learning,
so that they can become effective and independent language
learners" (p. 38). There is an intimate relationship between
AU and effective learning. In other words, the development
of AU implies better language learning (Benson, 2001). The
explicit recognition of AU as an important and highly influ-
ential mental attribute in the process of learning a new lan-
guage gives ample justification for investigating the way it is
related to the other mental and personal factors and the way
it can be enriched directly or indirectly (Nosratinia & Zaker,
2013a, 2013b).
AU requires support from environmental conditions, and
the key source of support for learners'AU in the classroom is
the teacher (O'Donnell et al., 2012). It is believed that when
EFL teachers are AU supportive toward learners, it would
directly affect the degree of AU among learners (Chan,
2001). However, to develop the sense of AU among learners,
teachers need to have a broader perspective on the process of
learning and the affecting factors which directly or indirectly
affect the process of learning, AU in learning, and target lan-
guage competence (Bell, 2003; Kumaravadivelu, 2012;
Lightbown & Spada, 2006; Little, 1991). Therefore, any
attempt to establish AU enhancing techniques and to know
the nature of AU seems to be perfectly justified. In this
regard, discovering the relationship between AU and other
psychological/cognitive/metacognitive factors not only
reveals the nature of AU more but also equips EFL teachers
with a higher degree of knowledge and a wider perspective
regarding the characteristics of learners and the way they
will better progress in their learning.
The main purpose of the present study was to investigate
the way AU is related to creativity (CR) and critical thinking
(CT) among EFL learners. CR and CT are not only among
the hot topics in the teaching English as a foreign language
(TEFL) profession, but they are also widely acknowledged
to be among the metacognitive factors, which substantially
affect, influence, and shape the process of learning English
as a second/foreign language (Connolly, 2000; Kabilan,
2000; Sarsani, 2006). The above-mentioned premise is in
line with Kabilan's (2000) statement where he argues that for
learners to become proficient in a language, they clearly
need to employ creative and critical thinking through the tar-
get language. Therefore, inspecting the relationship among
AU, CT, and CR seems justified, indispensable, essential,
and promising toward the elevation and advancement of
classroom practice and teacher education.
Socrates began the tradition of CT by reflectively ques-
tioning common beliefs and expectations, and separating
beliefs that are reasonable and logical from those that lack
evidence or rational foundation (Zireva & Letseka, 2013).
According to Kress (1985), CT is a social practice and is
language itself. CT, as a high level of cognitive function, "is
a purposeful, self-regulatory judgement which results in
interpretation, analysis evaluation, and inference, as well as
explanations of evidential, conceptual, methodological or
contextual considerations upon which the judgement is
based" (Astleitner, 2002, p. 53). Willingham (2008) argues
that CT makes it possible to look at issues from different
perspectives. Educators have also argued for the importance
of promoting higher order thinking skills in English as a sec-
ond language (ESL) and EFL classrooms (Chamot, 1995;
Tarvin & Al-Arishi, 1991), and empirical evidence supports
the effectiveness of teaching CT skills along with learning
and teaching English as a second or foreign language
(Chapple & Curtis, 2000).
CR is another metacognitive trait which can be justifiably
included in the category of learning affecting elements
(Mishan, 2005).As Pink has stated (as cited in Rao & Prasad,
2009), humankind is "entering a new age where creative
thinking is becoming increasingly important" (p. 31). Thanks
to the outstanding attempts made by Guilford and Torrance,
the field of CR has developed as it is widely known today
(Sternberg, 2009). In the modern world, CR is fundamentally
important in all aspects of life, and as CR is complex in
nature, different viewpoints have been put forward to explain
the concept emphasizing its different aspects (Sarsani, 2006).
As stated by T. I. Lubart (1999), CR is generally character-
ized as the ability to create new and original products which
are considered appropriate for the features and limitations of
a given task, where products can refer to a variety of ideas,
viewpoints, and innovations. T. Lubart and Guignard (2004)
believe that these products must be original because they
cannot be just a mere copy of what already exists.
Humans are all born with a huge potential for CR and
learning in varying degrees, and CR can be nurtured "at all
ages and in all fields of human endeavor" (Sarsani, 2005,
p. 47). To this end, developing CR at all levels in the educa-
tion system is increasingly recognized as being critical in
improving educational attainment and life skills (Agarwal,
1992). Second/foreign language teaching of course is one
such educational attainment and arguably a life skill.
Moreover, in the words of Carter (2004), "Discussions of
creativity in relation to language teaching and learning have
been extensive and continue to be a very major point of
application of a wide range of theories of creativity" (p. 213).
According to Sarsani (2005), "Philosophy sees creativity
as a process of change" (p. 132). Education must thus "enable
people to generate and implement new ideas and to adapt
positively to different changes in order to survive in the cur-
rent world" (Jeffrey & Craft, 2001, p. ix). In all actuality,
"Creativity is an inherent aspect of all pedagogical tasks"
(Mishan, 2005, p. 83). Therefore, it seems to be quite reason-
able to state that the TEFL/TESOL (teaching English to
speakers of other languages) practice and its product which
is second-language (L2) proficiency can be highly influ-
enced by CR (Fahim & Zaker, 2014).
Nosratinia and Zaker 3
The put forward premises give ample justification for wit-
nessing a growing body of research in our field that aims at
conducting further investigation into the nature of CR, CT,
and AU and the way they promote learning a new language.
However, the question that is raised here is whether CR, CT,
and AU are associated to each other and if so, to what extent.
This issue intrigued the researchers of this study to investi-
gate the relationship among EFL learners' CR, CT, and AU.
To fulfill this objective, the following research questions
were proposed:
Research Question 1: Is there any significant relation-
ship between EFL learners' CR and CT?
Research Question 2: Is there any significant relation-
ship between EFL learners' CR and AU?
Research Question 3: Is there any significant relation-
ship between EFL learners' CT and AU?
Assuming a significant relationship among the three vari-
ables, the following research question was posed:
Research Question 4: Is there any significant difference
between EFL learners' CR and CT in predicting AU?
Method
Participants
The participants in this research consisted of undergraduate
EFL learners majoring in English translation and English lit-
erature at the Islamic Azad University, Central Tehran and
Roudehen branches. In these full-time undergraduate
courses, English is the main medium of instruction; however,
occasional use of learners' first language (L1; Persian) is
allowed. This point is based on the fact that the initial level
of English language proficiency among these undergraduate
students is assumed to be intermediate to upper-intermediate,
as tested by the university entrance examinations in Iran.
From the above-mentioned population, 182 male and female
EFL learners (134 females, 74%, and 48 males, 26%),
between the ages of 19 and 40 (Mage
= 22 years), were
selected via cluster random sampling. There is no age limit
for enrolling in these undergraduate courses; therefore, it
was observed that a limited number of participants (n = 3)
were fairly older than the rest of the participants.
Instruments
Three instruments utilized to collect data pertaining to the
subjects' levels of CR, CT, and AU were as follows:
1. A questionnaire of AU by Spratt, Humphreys, and
Chan (2002);
2. A questionnaire of CR created by O'Neil, Abedi, and
Spielberger (1992); and
3. A questionnaire of CT developed by Honey (2000).
Learner AU Questionnaire
To evaluate participants' level of AU, a questionnaire of AU
including 52 items was administered. The questionnaire
though designed by Spratt et al. (2002), is strongly influ-
enced by Holec's (1981) definition of AU. Holec defines AU
as "the ability to take charge of one's own learning and where
to take charge of one's learning is to hold the responsibility
for all the decisions concerning all aspects of this learning"(as
cited in Spratt et al., 2002, p. 249).
Holec, according to Spratt et al. (2002), argues that ability
and responsibility are functioning in five principal areas:
"determining objectives; defining contents and progressions;
selecting methods and techniques to be used; monitoring the
procedure of acquisition; and evaluating what has happened"
(p. 249). All these notions of ability and responsibility are
incorporated in the questionnaire.
The questionnaire has four sections. The first section (13
items) focuses on examining students' views of their respon-
sibilities and those of their teachers. The second section (11
items) evaluates participants' confidence in their ability to
operate autonomously. The third section (1 item) aims to
measure the levels of student motivation to learn English.
The fourth section (27 items) investigates students' practice
of autonomous learning in the form of both inside and out-
side class activities.
Respondents were asked to indicate their answers in 20
min in a Likert-type scale, sequentially assigning values 1, 2,
3, 4, and 5 to options not at all, a little, some, mainly, and
completely in Section 1. Counting 1 for "very poor" to 5 for
"very good" in Section 2. Setting 5 to 1 beside the first to the
last choices in Section 3; and attributing values of 1, 2, 3, and
4 to options of "never," "rarely," "sometimes," and "often"
in Section 4. In this regard, the result can vary from 52 to
233. It is self-evident that the higher the mark, the more
autonomous the participant is.
In this study, the Persian version of this questionnaire that
was translated and validated by Fahim and Sheikhy (2011)
was employed to make sure the participants fully compre-
hended it. The reliability of AU questionnaire was estimated
to be .84 using Cronbach's alpha coefficient, which demon-
strated a good degree of reliability.
CR Questionnaire
This questionnaire was originally designed by O'Neil et al.
(1992) and is called the Abedi­Schumacher Creativity Test
or the ACT (as cited in Cropley, 2000). According to Abedi
(2002), the estimated correlation coefficient between the
four subscales of the ACT and the Torrance Test of Creative
Thinking (TTCT) was meaningful at .01 level of signifi-
cance. Therefore, the concurrent validity of ACT was estab-
lished. It is worth noting that the TTCT is one of the best
4 SAGE Open
known tests of CR, which consists of two sections: verbal
and nonverbal or figural sections. In fact, the development of
the ACT was an attempt to shorten the time needed for the
administration and scoring of the TTCT. The estimated reli-
ability of each of the subscales of the ACT was .61 to .75,
which demonstrated that the test is also reliable (Auzmendi,
Villa, & Abedi, 1996).
In this study, the Persian version of this questionnaire,
developed and validated by Zaker (2013) based on the origi-
nal test, was utilized. Zaker provides the following sections
to assess and appraise the validity of the instrument: a report
on content validity, checking the criterion-related validity, an
analysis of the internal structure of the instrument using
exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses, and a report on
the reliability of the instrument including 50 items. The 50
multiple-choice items of this test have three options ranging
from least to most creative responses with a range of scores
between 0 and 2; therefore, the scores of the test could range
from 0 to 100, and the participants are allocated 50 min to
respond to the questionnaire. In this study, the internal con-
sistency of this test was estimated to be .87 using Cronbach's
alpha coefficient.
CT Questionnaire
The CT questionnaire intends to explore what a person might
or might not do when thinking critically about a subject.
Developed by Honey (2000), the questionnaire aims at evalu-
ating the three main skills of comprehension, analysis, and
evaluation of the participants. This questionnaire is a Likert-
type questionnaire with 30 items, which allows researchers to
investigate learners'ability in note-taking, summarizing, ques-
tioning, paraphrasing, researching, inferencing, discussing,
classifying and outlining, comparing and contrasting, distin-
guishing, synthesizing, inductive and deductive reasoning.
The participants were asked to rate the frequency of each
category they use on a 5-point Likert-type scale, ranging
from never (1 point), seldom (2 points), sometimes (3 points),
often (4 points), to always (5 points). The participants' final
scores are calculated by adding up the numbers of the scores.
The ultimate score is computed in the possible range of 30
to150. The participants were allocated 20 min to complete
the questionnaire.
In this study, the Persian version of this questionnaire was
employed, which was translated and validated by Naeini
(2005). In a study conducted by Nosratinia and Abbasi
(2013) on EFL learners, the reliability of this questionnaire
was estimated to be .79 using Cronbach's alpha coefficient.
In this study, the reliability of CT questionnaire was esti-
mated to be .81 using Cronbach's alpha coefficient, which
demonstrated a fair degree of reliability.
Procedure
In descriptive research, the procedures should be described
as accurately and completely as possible, so that the
replication of research by other researchers would become
possible (Best & Kahn, 2006). To achieve the purpose of this
study and address the questions posed, certain procedures
were pursued which are explained below.
After obtaining a formal approval for conducting the
research in the universities mentioned above (see partici-
pants), for every session of administration, three available
classes were codified. Next, one class was chosen randomly
and the other two classes were excluded from the study. This
procedure resulted in having samples selected on a cluster
sampling basis, which according to Springer (2010) and Best
and Kahn (2006) would increase the validity and generaliz-
ability of the findings of a descriptive study. All the EFL stu-
dents in the selected class were then informed about the aim
of the study and were given the choice whether to fill in the
questionnaires or not. They were also informed that the
information supplied by them will be treated as confidential.
Before administering the questionnaires, the participants
were fully briefed on the process of completing the question-
naires. This briefing was given in Persian by explaining and
exemplifying the process of choosing answers. Due to the
nature of this correlational study, no criterion for establishing
homogeneity was adopted. Moreover, the researchers inten-
tionally randomized the order of questionnaires administered
to control the impact of order upon the completion process
and validity of the data.
Thereafter, the three questionnaires were administered to
the participants. The researchers randomly observed the fill-
ing out process of some individuals to make sure that they
were capable of fully understanding the questions and
responses. It should be added that the whole length of the
class periods of 90 min was devoted to administering these
questionnaires and the responses were handled with
confidentiality.
Subsequently, the questionnaires were scored to specify
the participants' CT ability, the degree of AU, and the degree
of CR. This was followed by the statistical analyses which
will be elaborated later in the following parts. It is worth
mentioning here that, of the initial 300 administered ques-
tionnaires, 182 sets of fully answered questionnaires of all
the three ones were considered for statistical analyses to
determine the relationship among the variables. The other
118 sets of questionnaires were excluded from the analyses
due to their incomplete answers.
Results
The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship
among EFL learners' CR, CT, and AU. Accordingly, the
researchers conducted a series of pertinent calculations and
statistical routines to investigate the questions raised and
came up with certain results that are elaborated comprehen-
sively in this part.
The data analysis provided both descriptive statistics and
inferential statistics. Descriptive statistics such as mean,
standard deviation, and standard error of the mean were
Nosratinia and Zaker 5
obtained. Next, to check the normality of distribution, the
assumptions of linear correlation were checked. Moreover,
the reliability of the research instruments was estimated
through Cronbach's alpha coefficient. In view of the normal
distribution of the variables in the inferential statistics,
Pearson's product­moment correlation was then applied to
the data. The design of the present study is descriptive as the
primary motivation of the researchers was to investigate the
relationship among the three variables with no preceding
manipulation (Best & Kahn, 2006; Springer, 2010;
Tabachnick & Fidell, 2007). CR and CT were the predictor
variables of the predicted variable, AU. Furthermore, age
and gender were categorized as an intervening variable.
Checking the Assumptions of Linear Correlation
To run correlation, according to Tabachnick and Fidell
(2007), the following assumptions should be checked:
1. Linear relation between each pair of variables,
2. Normality of the distribution of the variables, and
3. Homoscedasticity.
Linear relation between each pair of variables.To check the
linearity of relations, it was needed to visually inspect the
data by creating scatter plots. As there were multiple vari-
ables in the study, the researchers created a multiple scatter-
plot for CR, CT, and AU, which showed that there was no
kind of nonlinear relationship between the scores on CR, CT,
and AU, such as a U-shaped or curvilinear distribution.
Normality of the distributions.To check the normality of the
distributions, the descriptive statistics of the data were
obtained and are reported in Table 1. As demonstrated in
Table 1, the distribution of data for CR, CT, and AU was
normal as both the skewness and kurtosis ratios fell within
the range of -1.96 and +1.96. This means that the distribu-
tion did not show a significant deviation from normality.
Moreover, the actual shapes of the distributions for CR, CT,
and AU were inspected by checking the histograms of distri-
butions. This inspection demonstrated that scores were nor-
mally distributed.
Homoscedasticity.To check the assumption of homoscedas-
ticity, that is, the assumption that variance of residuals for
every pair of points on the independent variable is equal
(Tabachnick & Fidell, 2007), the residuals plot was exam-
ined (Figure 1). As demonstrated in Figure 1, the cloud of
data is scattered randomly across the plot and thus the vari-
ance is said to be homogeneous. As the assumptions of linear
correlation were all observed for CR, CT, and AU, the data
were analyzed by Pearson's correlation with the aim of seek-
ing the answers to the questions of the study.
The First Research Question
It has been a common belief among many educators and psy-
chologists that CR and CT are closely associated, and they
both amplify and foster higher order thinking (Chamot,
1995; Kabilan, 2000; Sarsani, 2006). However, to systemati-
cally investigate the way CT and CR are associated among
EFL learners, the following question was posed as the first
research question of this study:
Research Question 1: Is there any significant relation-
ship between EFL learners' CR and CT?
To answer this question, the data were analyzed by
Pearson's product­moment correlation coefficient. The
results showed that there was a significant and positive cor-
relation between the two variables, r = .82, n = 182, p < .05,
and high levels of CT were associated with high levels of

CR. This signified a large effect size (Cohen, 1992; Larson-
Hall, 2010) supplemented by a very small confidence inter-
val (CI = [0.76, 0.86]).
The Second Research Question
As discussed earlier, there is a significant body of literature
which acknowledges CR and AU as highly influential factors
in today's education (Benson, 2003; Sarsani, 2005). However,
to systematically investigate the relationship between CR
and AU among EFL learners, the subsequent question was
posed as the second research question of this study:
Research Question 2: Is there any significant relation-
ship between EFL learners' CR and AU?
To answer this question, the data were analyzed by
Pearson's product­moment correlation coefficient. The
results obtained showed a significant and positive correlation
between the two variables, r = .66, n = 182, p < .05, and high
levels of CR were associated with high levels of AU. This
signified a large effect size supplemented by a very small
CI = [0.57, 0.73].
The Third Research Question
By giving EFL learners the role of autonomous players in
pedagogic decision making (Kumaravadivelu, 2008, 2012)
and considering the empirical evidence which supports the
profound impact of CT on the process of second or foreign
language learning (Chapple & Curtis, 2000), another objec-
tive of the present study was investigated by analyzing the
relationship between these two factors; in this regard, the
third research question was posed as follows:
Research Question 3: Is there any significant relation-
ship between EFL learners' CT and AU?
To answer this question, the data were analyzed by
Pearson's product­moment correlation coefficient. The
results showed that there was a significant and positive cor-
relation between the two variables, r = .73, n = 182, p < .05,
and high levels of CR were associated with high levels of
AU. This signified a large effect size supplemented by a very
small CI = [0.66, 0.79].
The Fourth Research Question
As the correlations between the three variables, CR, CT, and
AU, turned out to be significant, the researchers could legiti-
mately opt for the multiple regression analysis between the
variables to answer the following research question:
Research Question 4: Is there any significant difference
between EFL learners' CR and CT in predicting AU?
As reported in Table 2, R turned out to be .74 and R2 was
.553. This means that the model explains 55.3% of the vari-
ance in AU. Table 3 reports the results of ANOVA,
F(2, 179) = 110.54, p = .0005, which were considered significant.
Also, Table 4 demonstrates the Standardized Beta
Coefficients, which signify the degree to which each predic-
tor variable contributes to the prediction of the predicted
variable. Inspection of the significance values showed that
both CR and CT make statistically significant unique contri-
butions to the equation as both significance values were less
than .05. However, the comparison of beta values revealed
that CT has the largest beta coefficient ( = .587, t = 6.627,
p = .0005). This means that this variable makes the strongest
statistically significant unique contribution to explaining
AU. Therefore, it was concluded that CT could predict more
significantly the AU scores of the participants.
Ultimately, although normality of the distributions was
checked for correlation in the previous sections, the residuals
table (Table 5) also verified the absence of outstanding outli-
ers as the Cook's distance values did not exceed 1 and
Mahalanobis distance values did not exceed 13.82
(Tabachnick & Fidell, 2007). Thus, the P­P plot (Figure 2)
was used to visually inspect the result.

Discussion and Conclusion
The current study attempted to investigate the possible rela-
tionships among EFL learners' CR, CT, and AU. Based on
the pertinent data analyses carried out, the researchers
observed that there were significant relationships among the
above-mentioned variables. The relationship between EFL
learners' CT and CR showed a high degree of significance
r = .825), which supports the notion that CR and CT as two
principal metacognitive and mental factors are closely
related. This finding was supported by previous research
where it was reported that both CR and CT significantly
intensify and contribute to the quality of mental processes
and, as a result, the quality and extent of learning (Agarwal,
1992; Chamot, 1995; Chapple & Curtis, 2000; Jeffrey &
Craft, 2001; Halpern, 2014; Kabilan, 2000; Ku, 2009;
Scriven & Paul, 2004; Wagner, 1997). However, the results
of the multiple regression analysis indicated that between CT
and CR, CT plays a more important role in predicting AU
among EFL learners ( = .587 > .181).
The observed significant relationship between CT andAU
was in line with the results of another study conducted by
Fahim and Sheikhy (2011) where a significant, though
smaller, relationship was observed between CT and AU (r =
.546). However, this study attempted to not only follow a
more careful and systematic pattern of progress but also to
compare the relationship between CT and AU with the rela-
tionship between CR and AU. This study confirmed that a
significant relationship exists between CR and AU (r =
.665), which indicates that CR and creative thinking can sig-
nificantly contribute to the degree of AU among EFL learn-
ers. It was systematically confirmed that CR makes a large
(maybe not the largest) unique contribution to explaining AU
among EFL learners.
By and large, the results of the present study revealed that
when there is variance in any of the observed variables,
namely, CR, CT, and AU, there also exists variance in the
other variable(s). Put simply, the three variables are closely
and significantly interrelated. Furthermore, between CR and
CT, CT is a better predictor of AU among EFL learners, as
observed in this sample. These points may provide EFL
teachers with a deeper understanding of learners' CR and CT
and the way their components are associated. Therefore,
their basic components, that is, those of CR (fluency, flexi-
bility, originality, imaginativeness, and elaboration) and CT
(identifying and challenging assumptions, imagining, explor-
ing, and enumerating other options, respecting evidence and
reasoning, defining the context, listing reasons explicitly,
and self-correction) should be considered as important fac-
tors among EFL learners. These factors, as the practical dem-
onstrations of CT and CR, not only would encourage each
other but would also promote AU and better learning among
EFL learners. The above-mentioned relationship gives ample
justification for integrating all of the components of CR and
CT into the classroom practice through different stages (from
making decision on the content to assessment and evaluation
process) and the body of tasks to increase the chance of pro-
moting AU as well as the chance of promoting learning as
the direct influence of CR and CT.
Due to the importance of the above-mentioned factors,
this study suggests that EFL teachers inform EFL learners of
the ways through which CT, CR, and AU can contribute to a
more independent, reliable, and effective learning process. In
this research, it was revealed that the more creative and criti-
cal thinker the learners are, the more they are equipped to act
autonomously and independently, which would result in a
more personalized learning. Therefore, EFL teachers are rec-
ommended, when planning classroom activities, to include
CT-, CR-, and AU-oriented activities. These activities would
be based on highlighting the basic components of CT and
CR, as stated in the previous paragraph. Creating an environ-
ment in which CR, CT, and AU are properly valued and in
which learners take the responsibility for their own learning
seems to be a considerable step toward benefiting from the
potential capacities of CR, CT, and AU toward learning.
Based on the peculiarities of each context and the peda-
gogical objectives, EFL teachers might be able to orchestrate
the instruction to arm learners with CR, CT, and AU, which
are believed to bring about significant advantages for EFL
learners. These attempts may include helping learners mak-
ing appropriate choices and encouraging them to expand

their capabilities by attempting to come up with innovative
and original ideas. All in all, teachers are expected to realize
their role as a contributor to the improvement of their learn-
ers' mental capacities by exposing them to different innova-
tive, problem-solving, andAU strategies on one hand, and by
providing a way to progress gradually to be more active and
responsible for their own learning, on the other hand.
Due to the fact that language learning is a multidimen-
sional phenomenon, not only language teachers but language
learners also are required to play their role properly to facili-
tate and optimize this complicated process. Therefore, the
results of the current study have implications for language
learners, encouraging them to become more creative, auton-
omous, and critical about their learning activities. It is hoped
that the results of this study would make EFL learners more
internally motivated to value autonomous learning and cre-
ative and critical thinking. Furthermore, improving thinking
skills in a learning context can help learners to be equipped
with tools designed to instill positive attitudes toward learn-
ing a new language and positive views of themselves as
learners. When students are empowered with metacognitive
skills in tandem with AU-oriented activities, they become
confident, independent, autonomous, and fluent learners.
Given the content of EFL/ESL materials, in the present era
and influenced by the heightened knowledge of TEFL, the
language learners are also becoming the focus of curricula
design (Kumaravadivelu, 2008, 2012; Nation & Macalister,
2010; Yang, 1998). This way, the results of this study would
also assist syllabus designers and curriculum developers to
integrate AU, CR, and CT into the body of EFL materials in a
way that serves the purpose of instruction and teaching best.
Moreover, possessing a higher degree of understanding
regarding these metacognitive variables (CR, CT, and AU)
would enable syllabus designers and curriculum developers
to proffer the learners the capability to know how to learn a
language, how to monitor themselves, and how to develop
their learning, so that they can become effective and indepen-
dent language learners (Nation & Macalister, 2010).
Syllabus designers, as providers of a great portion of the
language learning setting, have a fundamental role to make
the process easier. They are expected to appreciate the
immense value and great potential of CR and CT for enhanc-
ing the level of learning and AU among EFL learners, which
results in having intellectual, active learners that through
using thinking skills can overcome their learning difficulties.
Syllabus designers are strongly recommended to incorporate
CR and CT tasks into EFL materials in which fluency, elabo-
ration, identifying the problem, defining the context, enu-
merating choices, analyzing options, listing reasons
explicitly, and self-correction are valued. This way, the learn-
ing context is given the chance to let thinking skills surface
through learning activities. It is also reasonable and well-
justified to incorporate CR, CT, and AU into the body of
achievement and diagnostic tests where it might provide the
context-sensitive teachers with a better understanding of the
mental and cognitive states of the learners and the way the
instruction has been successful or should be adapted. In the
same vein, it is also suggested to include CR, CT, and AU in
the prognostic tests of English courses, namely placement
tests.
The findings of this study confirmed that CR and CT
would facilitate learning a new language through promoting
AU. Moreover, it was observed that, in this context, CT
makes the strongest unique contribution to explain AU.
However, considering the inherent lack of control or knowl-
edge regarding the influential factors in correlational research
(Best & Kahn, 2006; Springer, 2010), further studies may
inspect the way other mental and personality factors interact
with the variables of this study. Moreover, the same study
could be conducted among other age groups regarding the
difference among different age groups with respect to mental
and personal qualities. This study can also be replicated
employing some qualitative instruments, for example, inter-
views, to increase the validity and generalizability of the
findings.
