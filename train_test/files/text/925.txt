This paper presents national estimates of the population likely to
identify with more than one race in the 2000 census as a result of
a new federal policy allowing multiple racial identification. A large
number of race-based public policies--including affirmative action
and the redistricting provisions of the Voting Rights Act--may be
affected by the shift of some 8­18 million people out of traditional
single-race statistical groups. The declines in single-race popula-
tions resulting from the new classification procedure are likely to
be greater in magnitude than the net undercount in the U.S. census
at the center of the controversy over using census sampling. Based
on ancestry data in the 1990 census and experimental survey
results from the 1995 Current Population Survey, we estimate that
3.1­6.6% of the U.S. population is likely to mark multiple races. Our
results are substantially higher than those suggested by previous
research and have implications for the coding, reporting, and use
of multiple response racial data by government and researchers.
The change in racial classification may pose new conundrums for
the implementation of race-based public policies, which have faced
increasing criticism in recent years.
racial classification  government statistics  U.S. census
Aminor change in wording in the 2000 census may have major
implications for population statistics in the United States.
Instead of limiting respondents to a single race, the new census
instructions will allow respondents to mark ``one or more'' races
(1). The decision to allow multiple racial identification repre-
sents a sea change in the U.S. system of racial statistics, which has
until now relied on a set of mutually exclusive, single-race
categories. Counts of the population by race are used for
enforcing a broad set of race-based public policies, including the
redistricting provisions of the Voting Rights Act, equal oppor-
tunity laws, and affirmative action (2). The treatment of multi-
ple-race responses is likely to be a challenge for race-based
policies in the United States, many of which already face a rising
tide of public and political criticism.
The new method of racial classification will have impacts on
both population counts and on the treatment of individuals. If
those marking more than one race differ from those who mark
single races, then this reclassification could also affect estimates
of group characteristics such as health status, income, and
educational attainment. At an individual level, multiple re-
sponses will create a series of conundrums for race-based
policies. To give just two examples: Does someone who used to
identify as ``White'' and now marks ``White'' and ``American
Indian'' now qualify for a minority small business loan? Does
someone who formerly marked ``Black'' but now marks ``White''
and ``Black'' no longer qualify? The indeterminacy of race is not
new for people with mixed heritage, but whereas the old system
put the burden of choosing a single race on individuals, the new
system will put this burden on the government, institutions, and
users of racial data.
This paper presents new national estimates of the size and
characteristics of the population likely to mark more than one
race. Based on ancestry data from the 1990 census and exper-
imental results from the 1995 Current Population survey, we
create two sets of independent estimates that place the count of
the multiple-race population between 8 and 18 million people.
To put this into perspective, the controversy over census adjust-
ment in the 1990 census involved a net undercount of only about
4 million persons. Our estimates of the multiple-race population
are higher than previous estimates based on the introduction of
a separate ``multiracial'' category into the census question, which
ranged from 1 to 1.5% of the U.S. population, about 3 million
people (4, 5, 7). Based on the results presented here, we expect
the population counts of single-race groups to decline by 3­6%
for Whites, 3­7% for Blacks, 15­25% for American Indians, and
4­9% for Asians and Pacific Islanders.
The change in racial statistics is part of a new federal statistical
policy on race that will go beyond the 2000 census to affect all
federal statistics, including those dealing with health, economics,
and program participation. Furthermore, federal statistical pol-
icy has a strong ``trickle-down'' effect and is usually imitated by
state and local governments as well as most private and public
research. Researchers in medicine, public health, and the eco-
nomic and social sciences will be affected. The results given in
this paper thus have implications for all research and program
administration that collects or analyzes data on race.
Despite the fielding of experimental surveys during the four-
year review of the policy on racial and ethnic statistics, the ``mark
one or more'' option remains virtually untested. The multiple
response option emerged relatively late into consideration, and
most research focused on the introduction of a separate ``mul-
tiracial'' category (3, 4). The only survey that did include a ``mark
one or more'' format was the 1996 Race and Ethnicity Targeted
Test (RAETT) (5). To ensure large sample sizes, the RAETT
sampled only census tracts with very high proportions of par-
ticular racial or ethnic groups. As a consequence the survey was
not able to produce results that would be ``generalizable to the
national population'' (5). In fact, other research shows that
people living in racially segregated census tracts have lower
intermarriage rates than the national population (6). Further-
more, respondents living in homogeneous areas who are of
mixed ancestry may be less likely to identify multiple races than
those living in more diverse settings.
In the absence of a national survey testing the actual ``mark
one or more'' format, we turn to two large, nationally represen-
tative surveys that gathered multiple-race identities in ways that
differ somewhat from the planned 2000 census question but still
allow estimation of the population likely to mark multiple races.
First, we analyze the results of the 1990 census. Responses to the
census ancestry item, which allowed multiple responses (in an

open format), can, in combination with responses to the tradi-
tional single-format census race question, be used to estimate the
multiple-race population. As a second source of data, we analyze
one of the panels from the Current Population Survey (CPS)
May 1995 Supplement on Race and Ethnicity. The CPS has been
previously analyzed (4), but in a different manner than here. We
estimate the number of multiple-race respondents based on
follow-up questions that gave single-race respondents the chance
to list additional races to ``better describe'' themselves. In
addition to obtaining counts, the sources we use also allow us to
examine the socioeconomic characteristics of the multiple-race
population and to order multiple responses by an approximate
measure of the strength of identification.
Framework
Distinguishing between mixed and unmixed racial ancestry can
only be meaningful if consideration is limited to relatively recent
times. Scientists have long abandoned the search for rigid
biological distinctions between races (8, 9). Current research on
human origins concerns itself not with the question of whether
common origins exist--this is taken for granted--but, rather,
with when our most recent common ancestors lived and when
subpopulations branched off from this common ancestor. The
concept of the four single-race groups used in the United States
(American Indian, Asian and Pacific Islander, Black, and White)
usually relies on the view that these populations were somehow
unmixed and therefore definable at the time of their arrival in
North America. Only from such a perspective is it possible to
distinguish between those whose ancestors are entirely within a
single racial population and those whose ancestors come from
more than one of these populations.
With the above caveat in mind, it is useful to distinguish
between three different concentric definitions of the multiple-
race population: (i) by genealogy, (ii) by awareness, and (iii) by
identification. A genealogical definition includes everyone with
mixed ancestry, even at a remove of many generations. A
definition taking into account awareness limits this genealogi-
cally defined population to those who know of their mixed
ancestry. An identification-based definition further limits itself
to those who actively identify, for example on surveys, with more
than one racial group. When we refer to the population that will
mark more than one race in the 2000 census, we are referring to
this last definition.
The logical relation of these populations is shown in Fig. 1. We
see that each subsequent definition is a subset of the previous
one (i.e., C  B  A). This figure also shows that the children
of interracial unions form only a subset of the aware multiple-
race population (B). We do this to highlight that not all
multiple-race people have parents who identify with distinct
races and that not all of the children of interracial unions will
necessarily identify with both races.
The proportion of the population identifying with multiple
races can be expressed in terms of the following identity:
A
N 
B
A 
C
B 
C
N
where N is the national population, and A, B, and C are the
counts of the populations identified in Fig. 1. This decomposition
illustrates that the proportion of the national population enu-
merated with multiple racial identities is a product of the
demographic history of a country (represented by AN), the
degree of awareness about racial ancestry (BA), and the
strength of multiple-race identification (CB). All of these
factors are subject to change over time, whether through chang-
ing demography, changes in the population's awareness of its
ancestry, or social changes that affect the appeal of identifying
with more than one race.
From a definitional standpoint, the count of the multiple-race
population also depends on the definition of single-race cate-
gories. As part of the revision of the directive on racial statistics,
the former ``Asian and Pacific Islander'' category has been
divided into two separate categories. Such changes in category
definitions affect the sizes of all of the variously defined multiple-
race populations A, B, and C. If in the future the concept of
multiple race included Hispanic responses, there could be a great
increase in the number of multiple respondents.
Most of the factors that contribute to the size of the multiple-
race population are not subject to measurement using survey
research. In the end, we can only measure C and N, since we do
not know the racial genealogy of the American population, nor
can we ask about awareness in a way that does not involve at least
some filter on the part of respondents of choosing to identify
their multiple ancestry in a survey. Still, some estimates do exist
for the size of the genealogically mixed population in the United
States. It has been suggested that the proportion of population
identifying as Black with some degree of White ancestry is as
least three-quarters and perhaps closer to 90% (10, 11). The
proportion of American Indians with multiple-race heritage is so
high that no federally recognized tribes have blood quantum
levels for membership greater than one-half (12). We cite these
examples to illustrate that the ratio CA of those who actively
identify with multiple races to those who potentially could
identify as such is probably quite small.
A final consideration in terms of measuring the multiple-race
population is the effect of questionnaire design. About 0.5% of
respondents in the 1990 census and in recent national surveys
mark at least two races despite instructions to ``mark only one''
race (7). In the year 2000, the number of multiple respondents
may depend in large part on what proportion of the population
actually reads and notices the instructions reading, ``Mark one or
more.'' An additional uncertainty is whether media attention will
make the public broadly aware of the multiple-race option even
before census forms are delivered. After publication of the 2000
census results, awareness of the multiple-race option will prob-
ably increase.

population in the United States according to various criteria. The population
C identifying more than one race on surveys and the census will be only a
subset of those with mixed racial ancestry, whether this is defined by gene-
alogy A or by awareness B. Only the populations N and C will be enumerated
in the 2000 census and other federal statistics. The population C marking more
than one race differs from the population that would mark a separate
``multiracial'' category (the right-most dashed-line ellipse), the option re-
jected in the revised federal statistical standard. It also differs from the
population made up of the children of interracial unions (the left-most dashed
ellipse).

Data and Methods
We use two data sources to estimate the number of respondents
who are likely to mark more than one race in the 2000 census.
First, the 1990 census provides an indication of multiple-race
respondents because it includes both a single-response race
questionandanopen,write-inquestiononancestry(http:www.
ipums.umn.edu) (13). The ancestry question included explicit
instructions that ``persons who have more than one origin and
cannot identify with a single ancestry group may report two
ancestry groups (for example, German-Irish)'' (14). Using an
algorithm developed by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, we map
the roughly 500 detailed ancestry codes to the major racial
groups: American Indian and Alaskan Native; Asian and Pacific
Islander; Black; White; and Other. For example, we code Irish
ancestry as "White," Japanese ancestry as "Asian and Pacific
Islander," and Nigerian ancestry as "Black." We code the
single-race response to the race question as r1, the assigned race
of the first ancestry as r2, and the assigned race of the second
ancestry as r3. If the responses to any two of these three racial
designations (r1, r2, r3) corresponded to distinct single-race
groups, we coded the individual as identifying multiple races.
About 90% of census respondents gave at least one ancestry, and
30% gave at least two. Our algorithm tries to err on the
conservative side by not counting ``other'' responses to the race
question or ancestry responses that are mapped to ``other'' as
indicating distinct single races. To further reduce the risk of
making ``false positive'' (15) identifications of the multiple-race
population, we changed the Bureau of Labor Statistics ancestry-
to-race algorithm so that those who wrote in ``American'' as their
ancestry were coded as listing an ``other'' race. The original
Bureau of Labor Statistics algorithm coded these responses as
``White.''
The second data source we use is Panel 2 of the Current
Population Survey May 1995 supplement on Race and Ethnicity
(http:www.bls.census.govcpsracethnsdata.htm), which
was fielded as part of the federal research effort accompanying
the revision of standards for racial and ethnic statistics. We
compare responses to the CPS ``control card'' single-response
race question administered several months before the supple-
ment to a modified race question and follow-up items in the
supplement. The modified race question in the supplement
included a separate ``multiracial'' category in addition to the
standard single-race categories. Two types of follow-up questions
were then asked. First, respondents who identified ``multiracial''
were asked to identify component single races. Second, respon-
dents who identified with a single-race group (instead of the
``multiracial'' category) in the supplement's first race question
were asked to list additional races if they would choose more than
one group to ``better describe'' themselves. We defined multiple-
race respondents both as (i) those who chose ``multiracial'' and
then listed at least two distinct races in follow-up questions and
(ii) those who chose a single-race and then listed at least one
additional single race to ``better describe'' themselves.
A large number of respondents chose ``Something else'' as one
of the races listed in follow-up questions in the CPS. We used two
systems of classification to reflect the uncertainty about how
such individuals would respond to the 2000 census question. A
larger multiple-race population is obtained by counting ``Some-
thing else'' responses as reflecting a distinct racial category from
that already stated. We call this the ``CPS High'' estimate. A
more conservative set of estimates was obtained by counting as
"multiple race" only those ``Something else'' respondents who
gave other indications that they were referring to a second
distinct race. These indications came from either the original
control-card race question or from a separate ancestry question
(recoding ancestry to race).
We estimated the number and proportion of multiple-race
respondents by using unweighted counts from our analysis of the
census and CPS. Estimates of the sampling error, unless other-
wise indicated, were made assuming independent multinomial
sampling. The standard errors for our estimates are considerably
smaller than those in previous research because we do not
compare question formats across independently drawn samples.
Instead, we take advantage of the fact that the same populations
were administered different question formats in a manner
similar to repeated trial experimental design (16).
Characteristics of the multiple-race population were also
estimated from both data sources. Respondents' primary single
race was determined by answers to the single-response race
questions, the census race question and the CPS control card
race question. We interpret primary race as indicating the
preferred single-race identity of multiple-race individuals when
faced with the historical system of mutually exclusive single-race
categories. Primary race was also used to estimate the single-race
groups from which multiple-race respondents would be drawn.
Household income was used as a measure of socioeconomic
well-being. We rely on household rather than individual income
to minimize any systematic age differences between the popu-
lations. The multiple-race population tends to be somewhat
younger, because of the increase in interracial unions in recent
decades (17).
Results
Table 1 summarizes our estimates of the multiple-race popula-
tion from the CPS and 1990 census. It also provides, for contrast,
the estimates of the targeted population from the RAETT (5).
It should be kept in mind that for the RAETT the row labels
refer to the race of the targeted population and not necessarily
to the race of the actual respondents. The size of the entire
multiple-race population is 3.1% according to our low CPS
estimate, 3.7% according to our 1990 census-based estimate, and
6.6% according to our high CPS estimate. The census-based and
CPS-based estimates are consistent with each other, with the

census-based estimate between the ``high'' and ``low'' CPS
estimates. All of our estimates are higher than the 1­1.5%
estimates given by previous researchers (3, 5, 7).
The multiple response option will have differential effects on
existing single-race populations. Most strongly affected will be
the American Indian population, who may see their numbers
shrink by about 14­20%. The Black and Asian-and-Pacific-
Islander populations may see declines ranging from about 5­8%.
It appears that the White population will be least affected, but
could still shrink by 3­6%.
The finding that all single-race groups will be affected by
allowing multiple responses is in sharp contrast with previous
research, which found statistically significant declines for Alas-
kan Native and Asian-and-Pacific-Islander targeted samples but
not for White, Black, or American Indian populations (5). This
earlier research differed from ours not only in that it focused on
racially segregated populations, but also because estimates were
less precise (and therefore less likely to find statistically signif-
icant differences) as a result of comparing independently drawn
rather than repeatedly tested samples.
The standard errors attached to the estimates in Table 1
measure only the uncertainty introduced by random sampling.
Recoding and sample frame bias are two other potential sources
of uncertainty. In the case of our estimates, the recoding
uncertainty is much greater than the sampling error, as can be
seen by comparing the CPS high and low estimates. However, the
national sample frame of the CPS and the census do not
introduce additional bias. In the case of the RAETT results,
there is no recoding error since the ``mark one or more'' format
was used directly as part of the survey instrument. However, the
bias introduced by the targeted sample frame is potentially large.
Taking advantage of the multiplicity of questions on race in
both the CPS and census data sets, it is possible to order the
primary and secondary identities of multiple-race respondents.
This will not be possible using data gathered under the ``mark
one or more'' format planned for the 2000 census, since no
follow-up questions will elicit the strength of identification.
Table 2 provides estimates of the joint primary-secondary race
distribution of the multiple-race population obtained from the
CPS ``high'' classification and the census data. The table also
provides estimates from two additional surveys, the 1993 round
of the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (http:www.
umich.edupsid) and the National Health Interview Survey
(J. Kuo, personal communication), which did not explicitly allow
multiple responses but did code multiple responses if they were
given. We see in Table 2 that all four sources show a consistent
pattern: the vast majority--from 64 to 82%--of the multiple-
race population list White as their primary race. The most
common secondary race is American Indian. According to the
CPS estimates, almost two-thirds of multiple-race respondents
list White as their first race and American Indian as their second.
In the census, the numbers are even higher, with almost three-
quarters of the multiple-race respondents being of this type. The
prevalence of American Indian as a second ancestry is consistent
with the growth in American Indian race and ancestry responses
in the 1970, 1980, and 1990 censuses, which has far outstripped
rates of natural increase (19). By contrast, Black-White and
White-Black combinations form a small portion of the multiple-
race population. Although people of mixed Black and White
heritage have been among the most vocal advocates of aban-
doning the mutually exclusive single-race system of racial clas-
sification, they constitute only about one-tenth of the population
likely to be enumerated as multiple-race in the 2000 census. It

appears that the multiple-race population will consist mostly of
people who currently identify with the White majority and not
with historically disadvantaged Black, American Indian, and
Asian populations.
To indicate the relative socioeconomic status of multiple-race
respondents and the multiple-race population considered as a
whole, we report the median household income of the popula-
tions obtained from the census and CPS in Table 3. We see from
the CPS data that the $27,500year median household income
of the entire multiple-race population is half-way between that
of single-race Whites and Asians ($37,500year) on the one hand
and single-race Blacks and American Indians ($17,500year) on
the other. The intermediate status of the multiple-race popula-
tion hides important variation within the multiple-race popula-
tion, in which median household income ranges from $17,500 for
respondents whose primary race is Black to $45,000 for those
whose primary race is Asian or Pacific Islander. The variation of
income by primary race within the multiple-race population is
not substantially less than that by race within the single-race
population. It appears that primary racial identity, not whether
one has single or multiple heritages, drives income differences.
A systematic difference that does appear between single- and
multiple-race populations is that people who list Black, Asian,
and American Indian as a primary race tend to have slightly
higher incomes if they list additional races. The reverse is true
for those listing White as their primary race. One possible
explanation is that the family backgrounds of multiple-race
respondents might be wealthier than single-race respondents,
particularly since most multiple-race respondents report some
White ancestry, and Whites have enjoyed a historical economic
advantage. A second possible explanation is that the tendency to
identify multiple races might itself increase with household
income. Selective reporting might mean that the multiple-race
population defined by surveys (population C) is more affluent
than the multiple-race population defined by ancestry (A) or
even by awareness (B). A third possibility is that being multiracial
may itself have consequences for income, due perhaps to dif-
ferences in discrimination.
Discussion
The new multiple-response format for racial statistics provides
a new set of options for Americans filling out census forms and
other data collection instruments. The decision by individuals
about whether to identify with more than one race is a personal
one, making any estimates concerning the size of the more-than-
one-race population inherently uncertain. Many people may be
aware of their mixed heritage, but how many will choose it? It
appears that the factor that will most affect the counts of the
multiple-race population is not how the children of interracial
unions will identify, but rather how those with more distant,
often American Indian, ancestry choose to identify themselves.
In the 1990 census, 2.9% of the national population identified
American Indian ancestry while at the same time choosing a race
other than American Indian. If all of these people mark two races
in the year 2000, then the multiple-race population will be at
least this high, even before any other racial combinations are
counted.
The 1990 U.S. census and the May 1995 Current Population
Survey allow estimates of the multiple-race population likely to
be enumerated by the 2000 census. We found that 3.1­6.6% of
the national population actively identifies with more than one
racial group. While neither source included question formats
identical to the planned census question, the estimates derived
from these sources may prove better predictions of the 2000
census results than those previously made from samples that
were not representative of the national population (5) or from
tests of a separate ``multiracial'' category (3, 4). In particular, the
multiple response option may prove much more attractive than
a separate ``multiracial'' category, because instructions to mark
``one or more'' categories involve a supplementation rather than
replacement of previously identified single-race identities.
Unlike previous research, we find that multiple-race identifi-
cation could indeed reduce the counts of all single-race popu-
lations. If multiple responses are counted separately from single-
race responses, we estimate that single race counts will decline
by about 3­6% for Whites, 3­7% for Blacks, 15­25% for
American Indians, and 4­9% for Asians and Pacific Islanders.
The width of these estimates is due to uncertainty in the coding
of certain multiple responses and will depend in part on how the
Census Bureau and others decide to code multiple responses,
one of which is ``Other race.'' Such declines are larger in
magnitude than the net census undercount from the 1990 census,
which is estimated at about 4.4 million people, or less than 2%
of the national population.
Our quantitative conclusions are limited to the extent that our
sources are indeed comparable to the ``mark one or more''
format to be used in the 2000 census race question. It may be that
Americans will be more reluctant to report additional ``races'' on
the census form than they were to either report additional
``ancestry'' on previous census forms or to list additional races in
an interviewer-based survey such as the CPS. The similarity of
results obtained from these two sources does, however, add
confidence to our results. Still, it is clear that precise estimates
of the effect of changing the question format will require the
fielding of surveys that use the actual "mark one or more"
format. Such surveys were, unfortunately, not undertaken as part
of the research effort accompanying the revision of the directive
on race and ethnicity. We recommend that future surveys
include the ability to match responses to the new format with
previous responses to the former single-race format. Such a
method will provide estimates of the effect of question change
with much smaller sampling errors than the independent panel
format previously used. As a final consideration, we note that the
effect of any publicity or public discussion on awareness of the
multiple-race format is left out of pilot tests and will have to
await the 2000 census itself.
Does the multiple-race population form a meaningful cate-
gory, one that should be used for race-based policies like
affirmative action, redistricting, and other civil rights enforce-
ment? Perhaps most remarkable about the population marking
multiple races is its diversity. Depending on the combination of
racial backgrounds, the multiple-race population includes those
from the most historically disadvantaged groups (e.g., those with
a mix of American Indian and Black ancestry) and those from the

wealthiest segments of society (e.g., the offspring of recent White
and Asian unions). As a whole, the socioeconomic situation of
the multiple-race population is fairly close to the national
average. Membership in a multiple-race category is not, in and
of itself, terribly predictive. However, knowledge of a particular
combination of racial backgrounds appears to be quite predic-
tive. Because multiple-race Americans, as a group, differ little in
their socioeconomic characteristics from the general population,
it may prove tempting to exclude this population from the
protections given to disadvantaged groups. Such an approach
would, however, clearly exclude a number of people from
protections to which they had a right under the old system of
classification.
The diversity of the more-than-one-race population poses
some serious problems for any method of classification and for
the treatment of this population under existing civil rights
legislation. The option of counting anyone with any non-white
ancestry as a minority may lead to controversy over whether
those who were previously counted as White should now be
included in counts of the minority population and be entitled to
policies aimed at the non-white population, a sensitive issue
given the current climate against race-based public policies. On
the other hand, multiracial people as a group might be consid-
ered exempt from programs that seek to benefit traditional,
single-race minorities, but this would bring to life fears already
expressed by minority groups regarding the reduction of their
constituency base. In any case, the government will have to be
careful to avoid accusations of reinventing a modern ``one-drop
rule'' or of counting whole people as fractions in a manner
similar to the original wording of the U.S. constitution (20). The
Voting Rights Act makes racial classification unavoidably polit-
ical; classification decisions which affect where district lines
are drawn may be subject to accusations of a new form of
gerrymandering.
For researchers in the health and social sciences, the change
in racial statistics also creates the need for decisions and rules
when using multiple-race data. Like government agencies, they
also face the complications of discontinuity in time series
information. Our results suggest that the addition of the multi-
ple-race option will indeed affect the counts of single-race
groups and may also affect estimates of group characteristics.
Taken together, the issues raised by multiple-race reporting
may fuel criticism not only of race-based policies but also of the
rationale for the collection of racial statistics in the first place.
The growing presence of mixed-race Americans, and of immi-
grants who do not find an obvious place for themselves in U.S.
racial categories, will continue to raise questions about what is
meant by ``race'' and why we are trying to measure it.
