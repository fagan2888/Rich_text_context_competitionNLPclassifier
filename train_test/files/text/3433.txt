Hospital and Emergency Department Use
Among Beneficiaries With Dementia

Abstract
Understanding expenditure patterns for hospital and emergency department (ED) use among individuals with dementia is
crucial to controlling Medicare spending. We analyzed Health and Retirement Study data and Medicare claims, stratified by
beneficiaries' residence and proximity to death, to estimate Medicare expenditures for all-cause and potentially avoidable
hospitalizations and ED visits. Analysis was limited to the Medicare fee-for-service population age 65 and older. Compared
with people without dementia, community residents with dementia had higher average expenditures for hospital and ED
services; nursing home residents with dementia had lower average expenditures for all-cause hospitalizations. Decedents
with dementia had lower expenditures than those without dementia in the last year of life. Medicare expenditures for
individuals with and without dementia vary by residential setting and proximity to death. Results highlight the importance of
addressing the needs specific to the population with dementia. There are many initiatives to reduce hospital admissions, but
few focus on people with dementia.

Original Research
Introduction
People with long-term care needs and multiple chronic ill-
nesses have high health expenditures compared with people
without these characteristics. For example, in 2006, beneficia-
ries with both chronic conditions and functional impairments
had average Medicare expenditures of $15833 compared with
$2245 for beneficiaries with neither chronic conditions nor
functional impairments.1 As a result, this population is respon-
sible for a disproportionate share of Medicare and health
spending, especially hospital spending. Many studies have
documented that a substantial portion of this utilization and its
related expenditures are avoidable or preventable.2-5 Several
initiatives are underway to address this problem, including the
development of resource use measures (ie, measures that assess
potentially preventable utilization or relative spending) for
Medicare's public reporting programs6 and the Centers for
Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) Initiative to Reduce
AvoidableHospitalizationsAmongNursingFacilityResidents.2
People with dementia are an important subgroup of the
population with functional impairments and multiple chronic
conditions. Because most people with dementia are Medicare
beneficiaries due to age (65 years or older) and many are also
Medicaid beneficiaries, the impact on public payers of their
hospital and emergency department (ED) use is substantial.
These implications are likely to grow as the number of people
older than 65 with Alzheimer's disease (the most common
type of dementia) is projected to nearly triple by 2050.7
Utilization and expenditures among older people with
dementia have generally been found to be significantly
higher as a result of their more complicated medical and
long-term care needs.8-12 However, current understanding of
expenditure patterns associated with hospital and ED use by
people with dementia relative to those without dementia--
particularly with potentially avoidable use--remains limited.
Many estimates of Medicare expenditures associated with
dementia use data prior to 2000 and do not distinguish by
place of residence or proximity to death.9,12-18
Moreover, although a number of studies have estimated
Medicare expenditures associated with dementia among cer-
tain Medicare or Medicaid populations,9,12-19 and some studies

have assessed potentially avoidable hospitalizations,20,21 we
identified only a few studies that assessed both Medicare
expenditures and potentially avoidable hospitalizations among
patients with dementia.9,17,19 One study by Bynum et al9 ana-
lyzed nationally representative data prior to 2000 and found
increased Medicare expenditures and odds of hospitalization
for people with dementia, both overall and for ambulatory care
sensitive conditions. Lin et al17 found higher Medicare expen-
ditures and increased odds for some but not all types of poten-
tially avoidable hospitalizations among beneficiaries with
dementia. The third study, Zhu et al,19 analyzed data for a pro-
spective cohort of community-based Medicare beneficiaries
and found significantly higher Medicare expenditures and
inpatient utilization among people with dementia, but results
on hospitalizations for ambulatory care sensitive conditions
were mixed. None of these studies assessed whether there
were differences by residential setting.
Some estimates of Medicare expenditures for nursing
home residents with dementia have shown higher costs as the
disease progresses,22 and other work has documented sub-
stantial variation in costs.23 In both studies, expenditures for
hospitalizations and hospice were major drivers of total
spending.
This study aims to address these research gaps with recent
and nationally representative data. The objective is to pro-
vide estimates of Medicare expenditures for hospitalization
and ED use, both overall and potentially avoidable, among
fee-for-service (FFS) Medicare beneficiaries with dementia
across residential settings (community vs nursing home) and
at end-of-life (EOL) compared with beneficiaries without
dementia.
Methods
Data and Study Population
We analyzed 5 waves of survey data from the Health and
Retirement Study (HRS) merged with Medicare claims for
2000-2008. The HRS is a biennial survey that collects infor-
mation on a nationally representative sample of older adults
aged 50 years and above. It contains data about respondents'
health status including cognitive status, physical functioning,
and chronic conditions, along with a broad set of sociodemo-
graphic, economic, and other characteristics.24
Medicare enrollment and claims data from CMS are
linked for consenting HRS respondents. The claims provide
detailed information on health care utilization and expendi-
tures, which is more reliable than the self-reported data in the
HRS. Given our focus on Medicare expenditures, the study
population includes HRS respondents aged 65 years or older
enrolled in FFS Medicare.
We conducted stratified analyses on 4 subsamples: (1)
community residents (n = 11921 persons with 37127 obser-
vations), (2) nursing home residents (n = 1081 persons with
1604 observations), (3) community decedents (n = 2630
persons), and (4) nursing home decedents (n = 615 persons).
Nursing home residence was defined as residing in a nursing
home at the time of the HRS interview at each wave.
Measure of Dementia
Previous research has shown that using 1 source for classify-
ing dementia leads to underreporting of prevalence25,26 and
expenditures.27 To address this problem, we measured
dementia by combining diagnostic information from the
Medicare claims and a cognitive impairment measure from
the HRS; the latter incorporates information on cognitive
functioning from respondent and proxy reports. The HRS-
based cognitive measure was developed and validated with
diagnostic data from the Aging, Demographics, and Memory
Study, a subsample of HRS respondents aged 70 and
older.28,29 For self-respondents, cognitive performance was
assessed using a modified Telephone Interview for Cognitive
Status, a 27-point index based on items for short-term mem-
ory, working memory, and speed of processing; scores of 0 to
6 on this index are considered dementia. For respondents
assessed by proxies, cognitive status was measured on an
11-point index based on reports of memory deficiencies,
instrumental activities of daily living (ADL) limitations, and
an interviewer assessment, with scores of 6 to 11 indicating
dementia. From the linked Medicare claims, we used the
Chronic Condition Data Warehouse indicator for a diagnosis
of Alzheimer disease and related dementias (ADRD) or
senile dementia. We created a dichotomous variable to flag
beneficiaries who either met the HRS definition of dementia
or had an ADRD diagnosis from Medicare claims.
Expenditure Outcomes
Two sets of Medicare expenditure outcomes were defined for
hospitalizations and ED visits, respectively: expenditures for
overall utilization and expenditures for potentially avoidable
utilization. For beneficiaries alive at the HRS interview, each
outcome was defined annually over a calendar-year period
during the year of the HRS survey. For decedents, the out-
come was for the last year of life.
Hospitalization expenditures.We identified all hospitaliza-
tions from the linked Medicare inpatient claims and further
distinguished those hospitalizations that were potentially
avoidable. For each beneficiary, we calculated yearly Medi-
care expenditures (ie, program payments) for all-cause and
potentially avoidable hospitalizations. Following the defini-
tion developed by Walsh and colleagues3 and refined by
Feng and colleagues,20 we identified potentially avoidable
hospitalizations using a list of conditions and diagnosis-
related groups judged by an expert panel as either prevent-
able or manageable outside of the acute care setting.
Consistent with these studies, we used one set of poten-
tially avoidable conditions--those deemed preventable or
Daras et al 3
manageable in the community--to define potentially avoid-
able hospitalizations in both the nursing home and commu-
nity setting.3,20 The community list does not include all of the
conditions in the nursing home list because fewer medical
resources are available in the community, which means that
some conditions that are preventable in a nursing home may
not be preventable in the community; thus, our estimated
expenditures among the nursing home sample are likely
conservative.
ED Visit Expenditures
Yearly expenditures for ED visits included total Medicare
payments for outpatient ED visits that did not result in inpa-
tient admissions, which were identified from hospital outpa-
tient claims using either the Healthcare Common Procedure
Coding System classification codes (99281-99285) or
Revenue Center Codes (045x or 0981). There is no widely
used method to identify potentially avoidable ED visits spe-
cific to the elderly population. Therefore, we utilized the
same definition for potentially avoidable ED visits as that
used for potentially avoidable hospitalizations. In addition,
we distinguished potentially avoidable ED utilization only
among outpatient ED visits not resulting in inpatient admis-
sions given these are more likely unavoidable despite the
fact that the associated hospitalization may be classified as
potentially avoidable. In these instances, a physician deter-
mined whether to admit the patient. Therefore, our poten-
tially avoidable ED utilization results may also be somewhat
underestimated.
Other Variables
In multivariate models predicting annualized expenditures,
we controlled for a range of risk factors for hospital and ED
use, including beneficiary age, gender, race and ethnicity,
education, marital status, types of insurance coverage,
number of limitations in ADL, chronic conditions, self-
reported health status, income, urban residence, and geo-
graphic regions.
Statistical Analysis
We calculated Medicare expenditures for each beneficiary
per year for (1) all-cause hospitalizations, (2) potentially
avoidable hospitalizations, (3) all-cause outpatient ED visits,
and (4) potentially avoidable outpatient ED visits. These
expenditure measures were annualized by adjusting for time
"at risk" for service use during each year. We also inflation-
adjusted expenditures in terms of 2008 dollars based on the
Consumer Price Index (CPI) for medical care services devel-
oped by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
To address the fact that Medicare expenditures often are
skewed and not normally distributed--in this case as a result
of beneficiaries with no utilization--we used a 2-part
generalized linear model (GLM) which is a common
approach used in health care expenditure studies.30-33
In the first part of the model, we estimated the probability
of having any positive expenditure using generalized esti-
mating equation (GEE) logistic regression for the subsam-
ples, to account for repeated observations, and regular
logistic regression for the subsamples of decedents. The sec-
ond part of the model predicts expenditures conditional on
the probability of having any positive expenditure. Next,
using predicted values from these models, we calculated the
predicted expenditures per person by multiplying the proba-
bility of having any positive expenditure (from the first part)
by the expected expenditures (from the second part).
Similar to estimating the counterfactual, we recalculated
the predicted expenditures by recoding the dementia variable
to 0 for the sample while holding constant their values for all
other risk factors meaning that individuals with dementia
were modeled as if they did not have dementia. Finally, we
calculated the differential between the 2 sets of predicted
expenditures for each person, which can be considered the
marginal dollar amount of expenditures attributable to
dementia, independent of all other risk factors. We report
results on the adjusted mean annual expenditures per benefi-
ciary by dementia status in each subsample.
All multivariate regression models adjusted for each per-
son's exposure time or count of months survived and enrolled
in FFS Medicare during the outcome measurement period.
The HRS survey year or year of death was also included to
account for time trends, which would pick up any unob-
served changes in Medicare policy or payment changes over
the time period. All analyses were further adjusted for sam-
pling weights. This study was approved by the institutional
review board (IRB) at RTI International. The Medicare
claims data analyzed in this research were authorized under
a data use agreement (DUA #24379) with CMS.
Results
Table 1 summarizes the characteristics of all 4 subsamples.
In all, 12% of community residents had dementia, compared
with 84% of nursing home residents. In contrast, 34% of
community decedents and 87% of nursing home decedents
had dementia. The community and nursing home subsam-
ples, both overall and for decedents, were significantly dif-
ferent across most characteristics.
The unadjusted and adjusted results of expenditures for
the overall HRS sample, separately for community and nurs-
ing home residents and by dementia status, are reported in
Table 2. Unadjusted expenditures were significantly higher
for community residents with dementia than for community
residents without dementia; the average annual unadjusted
expenditures were $3489 higher for all-cause hospitaliza-
tions, $960 higher for potentially avoidable hospitalizations,
$97 higher for all-cause ED visits, and $20 higher for poten-
tially avoidable ED visits. However, among nursing home
4 INQUIRY
residents, the unadjusted mean expenditures did not differ by
dementia status.
Multivariate regression adjusted expenditure estimates
showed that among community residents, beneficiaries with
dementia had adjusted expenditures that were $2121 higher,
on average, than those without dementia for all-cause hospi-
talizations ($6709 vs $4588); for potentially avoidable hos-
pitalizations, the marginal difference was $606 ($1465 vs
$859). Community residents with dementia also had higher
adjusted expenditures for all-cause and potentially avoidable
outpatient ED visits than those without dementia. Although
statistically significant, both the absolute amounts and mar-
ginal differences in expenditures for both types of ED visits
were much smaller, compared with hospitalization-associ-
ated expenditures.
Among community residents, the differences in adjusted
expenditures by dementia were similar with those found in
unadjusted expenditures: Average adjusted expenditures were
higher compared with unadjusted expenditures for all utiliza-
tion categories regardless of dementia status. In addition, the

marginal difference in adjusted expenditures between those
with and without dementia was lower, relative to unadjusted
expenditures, but remains substantial for hospitalization
expenditures.
However, for nursing home residents, the pattern is some-
what less consistent, where the adjusted estimates were
higher for all utilization categories except for all-cause hos-
pitalizations for residents without dementia for which the
adjusted estimates were lower than unadjusted. Moreover,
unadjusted marginal differences by dementia status were not
significant for any type of utilization, whereas the adjusted
expenditures for all-cause hospitalizations were significantly
lower ($2035 less) for those with dementia.
Results of the unadjusted and multivariate regression
adjusted expenditures for HRS decedents are reported in
Table 3. Among decedents, only the unadjusted expenditures
associated with all-cause hospitalizations were significantly
lower for beneficiaries with dementia compared with those
without dementia, regardless of residence. The adjusted
results show that among community decedents, the adjusted
expenditures for all-cause hospitalizations in the last year of
life were $3320 lower for decedents with dementia ($19817)
than for those without dementia ($23
138). Among nursing
home decedents, the adjusted expenditures for all-cause hos-
pitalizations were $8808 lower, on average, for individuals
with dementia ($13
688) than for those without dementia
($22
496). Similarly, the adjusted expenditures for poten-
tially avoidable hospitalizations were lower for decedents
with dementia than for those without dementia, by $366 for
community decedents and $2497 for nursing home
decedents.

dementia vary by residential setting and proximity to death.
Specifically, community-residing people with dementia
incurred greater average Medicare expenditures for all-cause
hospitalizations and potentially avoidable hospitalizations
than those without dementia.Among nursing home residents,
the average Medicare expenditures were lower for residents
with dementia.
These expenditure patterns for beneficiaries with demen-
tia relative to those without dementia largely mirror their
hospitalization and ED utilization profiles. Previous research
using the same data shows that in the community, individuals
with dementia are more likely to be hospitalized than those
without dementia.20 That same research found no significant
difference in hospitalization rates by dementia status among
nursing home residents or among decedents in the last year
of life. Yet in the current study, our estimates of hospitaliza-
tion-associated Medicare expenditures for hospitalizations
are significantly lower for nursing home residents and
decedents with dementia than those without dementia. It is
possible that when people with dementia are hospitalized,
they may be treated with less aggressive or less costly care
relative to others without dementia.
The finding of higher Medicare expenditures among ben-
eficiaries with dementia in the community is consistent with
other studies.9,13 However, our study provides more current
estimates and distinguishes potentially avoidable utilization
and expenditure patterns by residential setting. Our results
suggest that the growing numbers of Medicare beneficiaries
with dementia will likely increase hospital expenditures,
more so than what may be expected among beneficiaries
without dementia.
Limitations of this work relate to study measures and
data. First, people were identified as having dementia
through survey responses and Medicare claims rather than
through individual physician diagnosis. We used a hybrid
definition of dementia, taking advantage of both Medicare

claims­based dementia diagnosis and HRS survey­based
data to identify dementia. Given evidence that relying on 1
source for classifying Alzheimer's disease leads to underre-
porting of prevalence25,26 and expenditure estimates,27 this
hybrid approach likely represents an improvement over stud-
ies that only use survey or claims data. However, the possi-
bility of under- or overidentification or misclassifications
remains. Furthermore, our dichotomous dementia measure is
not sensitive to disease severity or progression
In addition, our definition of potentially avoidable hospi-
talization and ED visits is the product of expert opinion
rather than an assessment of whether specific hospitaliza-
tions actually are avoidable.3,34-36 Moreover, there is limited
research on potentially avoidable ED visits and no standard
definitions, especially for older people and nursing home
residents; however, our approach is consistent with other
work.37
Finally, the generalizability of our results is limited to
elderly FFS Medicare beneficiaries who responded to the
HRS and consented to provide access to their Medicare
records. Thus, our results are not necessarily generalizable to
the general elderly population. This study focused only on
expenditures for hospital and ED use, and did not estimate
total health care expenditures.
The major study finding that Medicare expenditures asso-
ciated with hospital and ED use vary by dementia status,
residential setting, and proximity to death points to several
areas for further investigation. In light of the policy attention
to hospitalizations, including readmissions and potentially
avoidable hospitalizations among Medicare beneficiaries,
assessing the impact of ongoing initiatives or developing
new ones to reduce hospitalizations and readmissions among
community and nursing home residents with dementia is an
important area for future research. In addition, as suggested
by Clevenger and colleagues,38 further research is needed to
inform evidence-based practice for treating people with
dementia who present in the ED. Although some research
has examined the prevalence of dementia and associated
costs in the Medicare managed care population,12,39-41 much
of it is quite old. Thus, another important policy question
pertains to understanding the Medicare managed care popu-
lation with dementia, especially given that roughly one-quar-
ter of elderly Medicare beneficiaries are enrolled in managed
care organizations.42 Finally, considering the known varia-
tion in EOL expenditures,43 more in-depth study is needed to
shed light on EOL expenditures for beneficiaries with
dementia, including those associated with hospice use.
Our results on hospital and ED-associated Medicare
expenditures highlight the importance of addressing the
needs specific to the population with dementia. There are
many Medicare and Medicaid initiatives to reduce hospital
admissions, but none focus on people with dementia, who
account for a large share of expenditures for potentially
avoidable hospitalizations and ED use. However, it is not
obvious what strategies would be effective in reducing these
inappropriate expenditures. A recent systematic review of 10
interventions designed to reduce hospitalizations among
community-dwelling individuals with dementia found only 1
to be effective.44 The high hospitalization and ED-related
expenditures by people with dementia in the community
strongly suggest the need to strengthen primary care for peo-
ple with dementia in the community. Future policy and
research efforts should focus on specific initiatives to address
people with dementia that have the potential to reduce unnec-
essary Medicare expenditures and improve the quality of life
of people with these conditions.
