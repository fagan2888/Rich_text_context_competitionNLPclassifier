Objective: To compare rates of motor vehicle crash (MVC) fatalities among different race/ethnic
groups in urban and rural Arizona.
Method: Using the Fatality Analysis Reporting System and the National Center for Health Statistics
Multiple Cause of Death file, MVC fatalities in Arizona from 1990­96 inclusive were classified by
gender, race/ethnicity, and urban or rural residence. Age adjusted rates of total, occupant,
pedestrian, and alcohol related fatalities were calculated. The total MVC fatality rate for each race/
ethnic group was then adjusted for proportion of rural residence.
Results: Compared with non-Hispanic whites (NHWs), American Indians had raised relative risks for
MVC fatality in all gender and residence subgroups. Hispanic females and rural Hispanic males had
lower relative risks, as did rural African-American men.
Raised relative risks for American Indian men and women included all subgroups: total, occupant,
pedestrian, and alcohol related. Hispanic and African-American men both had raised relative risks of
pedestrian related fatalities, and Hispanic men had a slightly higher relative risk while Hispanic women
had a lower relative risks, for alcohol related fatality. Hispanic men and women and African-American
men had lower occupant fatality rates. Close to half (45%) of the excess MVC fatality among American
Indians can be attributed to residence in rural areas, where MVC fatality rates are higher. There were
1.85 occupants in crashes involving NHW deaths compared with 2.51 for Hispanics and 2.71 for
American Indians (p<0.001). The proportion of occupants not using a seatbelt was higher in Hispanics
and American Indians in both urban and rural areas.
Conclusion: The major disparity in MVC fatality in Arizona is among American Indians. The higher
MVC fatality rates among American Indians occur in all age groups, in both urban and rural areas,
and among occupants and pedestrians. Rural residence, lower rates of seatbelt use, higher rates of
alcohol related crashes, a greater number of occupants, and higher rates of pedestrian deaths all con-
tribute to the American Indian MVC fatality disparity.
High rates of pedestrian fatality occur in men in all three race/ethnic minorities in Arizona and among
American Indian women. In contrast to other studies, African-Americans and Hispanics did not have
raised total MVC fatality rates and compared to NHWs actually had lower rates in the rural areas of
the state.
Unintentional injuries are the fifth leading cause of death
in the US and 45% of injury deaths are caused by motor
vehicle crashes (MVC). The MVC death rate differs by
race/ethnicity being 16.2/100 000 among non-Hispanic
whites, 16.5 among African-Americans, and 14.3 among
Hispanics.1
There has been little scientific research into the causes of
different racial/ethnic MVC fatality rates. The bulk of the
literature addresses the excess MVC fatality among American
Indians.2­12 In addition, Schiff and Becker have documented
higher MVC fatality rates among both Hispanics and
American Indians compared with non-Hispanic whites
(NHWs) in New Mexico.9 Harper et al found that from 1991­95
in Colorado, Hispanics had MVC fatality rates 1.7 times those
of NHWs with higher rates among drivers, occupants, and
pedestrians.13 Baker et al found similar rates of occupant fatal-
ity among African-Americans, Hispanics, and whites among
those ages 5­19 years but when these rates were adjusted for
vehicle miles traveled, African-Americans had higher fatality
rates in the age range 5­12, followed by Hispanics whereas
Hispanics had the highest rates among those 13­19 years of
age.14
Various explanations have been offered for these differ-
ences. Several studies have documented higher rates of alcohol
involvement5 7 8 10 15 and higher rates of pedestrian
fatalities5­8 16 among American Indians. Hispanic fatalities in
Colorado were associated with higher rates of seatbelt
non-use, speeding, and older vehicles.13 Others have found
lower rates of seatbelt use among Hispanics,17­20 African-
Americans,19 20 and American Indians.19 20
Several studies found increased rates of alcohol involve-
ment among African-Americans and Hispanics13 21­24 but two
studies using self reported behavior found the same number
of, or fewer, episodes of African-American and Hispanic
alcohol impaired driving compared with non-Hispanic
whites.25 26
It has been documented that rural residents have higher
MVC fatality rates than urban residents.27 To the extent that
racial/ethnic minorities disproportionately live and drive in
rural areas, their MVC rates would be higher partly for this
reason.8
The purpose of this study is to explore the contribution of
alcohol involvement, pedestrian fatalities, and rural residence
to differences in race/ethnic specific MVC fatality in one state.
We hypothesized that there would be race/ethnic specific

help explain existing MVC disparities.
METHODS
This study covers the years 1990 through 1996, inclusive. The
Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) is a national data
set with information on the vehicle, each person involved, and
the circumstances of each fatal MVC. The race of each person
killed is not listed. We used all FARS records for crashes that
occurred in Arizona during the study period. The National
Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) multiple cause of death
file is compiled from death certificates and includes the causes
of death, personal information including race, and residence.
We used the NCHS records for Arizona residents that listed an
International Classification of Diseases code of E810 through E825
(motor vehicle fatalities).
Using a method first described by Fife, we matched FARS
records to NCHS records to create a data set comprising vari-
ables from both files.28 We first matched on the common vari-
ables of age, gender, date of death, and county of death.
Matched records were then extracted from each data set. Since
some records differed only by county where the death
occurred, we then matched using age, gender, and date of
death; again, matched records were extracted. The final match
sequence included age, gender, county, and date of death but
allowed the age from the FARS record to vary by one year from
the NCHS age. We excluded motorcycle and bicycle fatalities.
There were 5500 NCHS records and 6227 FARS records that
met the criteria noted; 4307 matches were achieved using all
four common variables, 287 matches resulted after excluding
the county, and 181 matches used all four variables with age
allowed to vary by one year. Thereby, a total of 4775 matches
were achieved, 87% of NCHS records and 77% of FARS records,
representing 4305 crashes. There was no significant difference
between the proportion of death certificates matched for
American Indians, African-Americans, Hispanics, and NHWs.
Each fatality was then classified according to race/ethnicity,
gender; and urban, rural. We classified race into five groups:
African-American, American Indian, NHW, Hispanic, and
others based on information from the NCHS record. For the
urban/rural variable we classified two counties as urban: Mar-
icopa County, which contains Phoenix, has a population den-
sity of 231 per square mile, and Pima County, which contains
Tucson, has a density of 73 per square mile. The other 13 Ari-
zona counties, with population densities ranging from 3­24
per square mile, were classified as rural. (One American
Indian reservation in Pima County, the Tohono O'odham, was
classified as rural due to its size and distant location from Tuc-
son.) Each death was classified as an occupant (drivers and
passengers) or pedestrian using the FARS data. Seatbelt use,
number of occupants, and the designation of alcohol related
were taken from FARS. The alcohol related variable used was
the police designation of whether the crash was alcohol
related.
Population denominators for each year were derived from
the 1990 census and the 1995 population estimate (US Census
Bureau). When calculating rates for the entire period, the 1993
population estimates were used. Age adjusted rates were cal-
culated using the direct method with the 2000 US population
as a standard. Annualized rates were calculated by dividing
the rates for the entire period by seven.
An urban/rural adjustment was performed by calculating
what each race/ethnic specific age adjusted MVC rate would be
if the urban/rural residence distribution were the same as for
NHWs. Significance levels were set at p<0.05 and 95% confi-
dence intervals were calculated for all statistical tests except
for the age group comparisons where, due to the number of
comparisons, a p<0.01 was used.
RESULTS
Of the 4775 matched FARS/NCHS records 2758 involved
NHWs, 1024 were Hispanic, 825 American Indians, 114
African-American, and 54 other. Because of the low number in
the "other" category, these were excluded from further analy-
sis. There were 833 pedestrian deaths: 393 NHWs, 200
Hispanics, 200 American Indians, and 27 African-Americans
(13 were not listed).
Table 1 shows the annualized, age adjusted MVC fatality
rates by gender and residence for each race/ethnic group.
American-Indians had the highest rate in all four groups.
Their relative risks were over three times those of NHWs in all
groups. Hispanics had lower rates than NHWs in all groups
except urban males whereas African-Americans had lower
rural rates in males.
Tables 2 and 3 show the occupant, pedestrian, and alcohol
related MVC fatality rates for males (urban and rural
combined) and females respectively. Compared with NHW
males, Hispanic males had lower rates of occupant and total
MVC fatality and higher rates of pedestrian and alcohol
related fatality while African-American men had a higher
pedestrian fatality rate. American Indian males had higher
rates in all categories. Compared with NHW females, Hispanic
females had lower occupant, alcohol related and total fatality
rates, African-Americans had lower occupant fatality rates,
and American Indians had higher rates in all categories.
Women had lower total, occupant, pedestrian, and alcohol
related fatality rates than men in each racial/ethnic group but
American Indian women had higher rates in each category
than did men in all other racial/ethnic groups.
Table 4 shows what the total MVC fatality rate for each
race/ethnic group would be if their urban/rural residence dis-
tribution were the same as NHWs (80% urban). The
urban/rural adjustment changes the Hispanic and African-
American rates only slightly whereas the American Indian
rate declines by 26%. Close to half (45%) of the excess
mortality of American Indians (the difference between the
American Indian and NHW rates) is accounted for by their
higher proportion of rural residents.
Table 5 lists the total MVC fatality rate by age for each race/
ethnic group. Compared with NHWs, Hispanic females have
lower rates in the ages 15­24, 45­54, 65­74, and 75 and above.
American Indian men had significantly higher rates in all age

women had significantly higher rates in seven out of nine age
groups. African-American males had significantly higher rates
for children under age 5.
The number of occupants (driver plus passengers) did differ
by driver race/ethnicity being 1.85 for NHWs, 2.51 for Hispan-
ics, and 2.71 for American Indians (both comparisons with
NHWs were significant at p<0.001). Seatbelt non-use by
occupants (drivers and passengers) was 86% for American
Indians, 81 % for African-Americans, 77% for Hispanics, and
68% for NHWs in urban areas (p<0.001) and 88% for Ameri-
can Indians, 85% for Hispanics, 72% for NHWs, and 67% for
African-Americans in rural areas (p<0.001).
DISCUSSION
This study has several limitations including the use of police
designation of alcohol involvement and the use of race/ethnic
identifiers in the NCHS and census data. The police
designation of alcohol involvement can be a subjective
judgment and may or may not be corroborated by a blood

alcohol concentration (BAC) measurement. One study in
western Washington state found that police assessment of
driver intoxication was reasonably accurate when investigat-
ing crashes that involved a driver who was transported to a
trauma center.29 Whether this degree of accuracy is achieved
around the country in fatal crashes involving drivers of differ-
ent races/ethnicities is unknown. There are several variables in
FARS pertaining to alcohol, each with limitations. To the
extent that a race/ethnic group is subject to bias or police pre-
conceived notions of alcohol impairment, their rates of alcohol
involvement will be higher or lower depending on the
direction of the bias. This issue is deserving of further study. In
our data, there were no race/ethnic differences in the
proportion of urban fatalities with BAC measured. However,
only 20% of American Indian fatalities in rural areas had a
BAC measured compared with 29% of Hispanics and 33% of
NHWs (p<0.001). There was an across-the-board lower
proportion of fatalities with BAC measured in rural areas
(27%) compared with urban areas (60%).
Another limitation is the lack of vehicle and pedestrian
exposure data. Without knowing the vehicle miles driven or
pedestrian miles walked for different race/ethnic groups, we
cannot tell if differences are due to amount of exposure or to
other variables.
The problems with race/ethnic identification are well
known. The NCHS classification is taken from death
certificates and is subject to the degree of accuracy in the state
agency responsible for vital statistics (in Arizona, the Arizona
Department of Health Services). In New Mexico high accuracy
has been found for the designation of Hispanics9 but it is
unknown if Arizona also achieves this rate of accuracy.
Under-classification of American Indian deaths is well
documented.30 Under-counting American Indian deaths will
result in a mortality rate that will be underestimated. Census
classification of race/ethnicity is self designated. There is per-
sistent concern in Arizona that race/ethnic groups are under-
counted; this is especially a potential for Hispanics because of
the large number of undocumented Hispanics who reside in
the state. To the degree that this undercounting occurs, calcu-
lated mortality rates will be overestimated.
With the cautions just discussed in mind, this study found
that the only race/ethnic group to have consistently higher
rates of MVC fatality was American Indians. In comparison
with NHWs, Hispanics had significantly lower rates except for
urban males. African-American males had slightly higher
rates in urban areas but lower rates in rural areas;
African-American females had rates similar to NHWs.
Higher mortality rates for American Indians were found
among both occupants and pedestrians, in both men and
women in urban and rural areas, and in most age groups.
Close to half of the excess American Indian MVC fatalities can
be attributed to the proportion who live in rural areas. Alcohol
use, number of occupants, seatbelt non-use, and pedestrian
deaths were all contributors to the raised American Indian
MVC fatality rate. A similar result was found in the Pacific
Northwest where raised MVC injury rates were found among
American Indians, more so in rural than in urban areas, and
alcohol impairment and seatbelt non-use were higher among
American Indians.31
This study is consistent with one conducted a decade ago
that also showed increased rates of rural, occupant, pedes-
trian, and alcohol related mortality rates among American
Indians in Arizona.8 Since that time MVC mortality rates have
improved among all Arizonans, except American Indian
females. However, the improvements have been greater in
non-American Indian males and this, plus the lack of
improvement in American Indian females, has caused
increased American Indian relative risks of MVC mortality in
1990­96 (3.17­4.11) compared with 1979­88 (2.3­3.1).
One issue regarding motor vehicle safety in rural Arizona is
the autonomous legal status of reservations. Arizona has 22
Indian reservations, each with separate traffic laws and differ-
ing levels of resources devoted to enforcement. This can lead to
more lenient law enforcement, which can influence rates of
speeding, seatbelt use, or driving under the influence of alco-
hol. There are examples of motor vehicle safety programs and
enhanced enforcement in American Indian communities that
have been successful.2 32 33 At the time of the study one tribe
had passed its own seatbelt law and six others had adopted
the Arizona state law, resulting in 82% of the American Indian
reservation population being covered by one or the other laws.
In addition, the Indian Health Service initiated an emergency
medical system on reservations in the 1980s.34 However, it
takes about 10 years before such systems can be expected to
reduce MVC mortality.35
There are a number of programs communities can adopt to
attempt to reduce MVC fatalities. The Task Force on Commu-
nity Preventive Services has published recommendations on
how to increase the use of child safety seats and seatbelts and
how to reduce alcohol impaired driving. These recommenda-
tions include a combination of community education, stronger

laws, and enhanced law enforcement.36 To the extent that
American Indian communities adopt these strategies, their
MVC fatality burden should decline.
In addition, half of the American Indian reservations in
Arizona prohibit the sale and possession of alcohol, including
the two largest. For residents of large and isolated reservations
this can mean a long drive or walk to obtain alcohol. The effect
of these policies on total MVC mortality is unknown. In urban
areas increased availability of alcohol is associated with
increased rates of alcohol related crashes,37 whereas research
in rural areas has had mixed results when examining the
relationship of distance to alcohol outlets and the incidence of
alcohol related crashes.38­40 However, none of these studies are
specific to American Indian communities.
This study found lower MVC fatality rates in Hispanics
compared with NHWs even though Hispanic men had higher
relative risks for alcohol related and pedestrian deaths and
men and women combined had a higher proportion of seatbelt
non-use among occupants killed. This may reflect fewer vehi-
cle miles traveled compared with other race/ethnic groups.
This result is not consistent with two other studies performed
in the Southwest where higher MVC fatality was found
among Hispanics in Colorado and New Mexico.9 13 One of
these, by Schiff and Becker, took place 32 years ago, however.9
In addition, New Mexico has a higher proportion of the popu-
lation that is rural than does Arizona and rural and urban
crashes were not analyzed separately. Harper et al used a simi-
lar method in a nearby state.13 While that study included resi-
dence (urban, rural) in the variables studied, and Hispanics
had a lower proportion of fatalities occurring in rural areas
than did whites, separate urban and rural rates were not cal-
culated. It is not possible to discern what the results of adjust-
ing for residence would be. Our results should serve to caution
against extrapolating race/ethnic differences in one state to
another, even if the states are in the same geographic region.
While this study shows, in our state, that Hispanics and
African-Americans have population based MVC rates similar
to NHWs, it does not allow any conclusion about risk related
to vehicle miles driven or trips taken. It is also unclear how
socioeconomic factors, such as income levels, educational lev-
els, employment rates or occupations, affect MVC fatality
rates. The higher pedestrian fatalities among the three ethnic
minority groups may be related to less access to motor vehicle
transportation and public transportation, and increased rates
of traveling by foot, and specific circumstances of pedestrian
travel that are particularly hazardous such as on roads with
poor lighting and no sidewalks.5 The greater mean number of
passengers among American Indians and Hispanics may also
be related to less availability of car transportation, thereby
placing a greater number of individuals at risk during a crash.
Using an older car can increase risk because of lower safety
standards. However, the age of cars at the time of the crash in
this study did not differ by the race/ethnicity of the drivers.
Income probably also affects the number of miles driven and
the exposure to risk of a MVC. All these issues deserve further
study.
While improvements in MVC fatality continue to be made,
there remains a marked disparity in Arizona for American
Indian MVC fatality. Ways to decrease pedestrian and alcohol
related fatalities, increase use of seatbelts and to affect the
factors associated with rural related MVC fatality, such as road
conditions and access to emergency services, need to be found
if this disparity is to be reduced.

Key points
· In Arizona, from 1990­96, American-Indians had raised
relative risks, compared with non-Hispanic whites, of motor
vehicle crash fatalities, in both men and women, in urban
and rural areas, and among both vehicle occupants and
pedestrians.
· Much of the excess American-Indian mortality is associated
with rural residence, lower rates of seatbelt use, alcohol
related crashes, and high rates of pedestrian fatalities.
· High rates of pedestrian fatalities occur among Hispanic
men, African-American men, and American Indian men
and women.
· African-Americans and Hispanics did not have raised total
rates of motor vehicle crash fatalities compared with
non-Hispanic whites and actually had lower rates in rural
areas.
· Motor vehicle fatality rates are declining among all racial/
ethnic groups but at a slower rate among American-Indians
leading to increasing relative risks for this population.
