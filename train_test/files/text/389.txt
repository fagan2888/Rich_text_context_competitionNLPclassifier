Trends in Hypertension Prevalence, Awareness, Treatment,
and Control Rates in United States Adults Between
1988­1994 and 1999­2004

Abstract--This study assesses trends in hypertension prevalence, blood pressure distributions and mean levels, and
hypertension awareness, treatment, and control among US adults, age 18 years, between the third National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey (1988­1994) and the 1999­2004 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, a
period of 10 years. The age-standardized prevalence rate increased from 24.4% to 28.9% (P0.001), with the largest
increases among non-Hispanic women. Depending on gender and race/ethnicity, from one fifth to four fifths of the increase
could be accounted for by increasing body mass index. Among hypertensive persons, there were modest increases in
awareness (P0.04), from 68.5% to 71.8%. The rate for men increased from 61.6% to 69.3% (P0.001), whereas the
rate for women did not change significantly. Rates remained higher for women than for men, although the difference
narrowed considerably. Improvements in treatment and control rates were larger: 53.1% to 61.4% and 26.1% to 35.1%,
respectively (both P0.001). The greatest increases occurred among non-Hispanic white men and non-Hispanic black
persons, especially men. Mexican American persons showed improvement in treatment and control rates, but these rates
remained the lowest among race/ethnic subgroups (47.4% and 24.3%, respectively). Among all of the race/ethnic
groups, women continued to have somewhat better awareness, treatment, and control, except for control rates among
non-Hispanic white persons, which became higher in men. Differences between non-Hispanic black and white persons
in awareness, treatment, and control were small. These divergent trends may translate into disparate trends in
cardiovascular disease morbidity and mortality. (Hypertension. 2008;52:818-827.)

Hypertension, or high blood pressure (HBP), is the most
important cardiovascular risk factor worldwide, contrib-
uting to one half of the coronary heart disease and approxi-
mately two thirds of the cerebrovascular disease burdens.1 In
the United States, the estimated prevalence of hypertension
(defined as systolic blood pressure [BP] 140 mm Hg and/or
diastolic BP 90 mm Hg and/or receiving antihypertensive
medication) derived from the 1988­1994 Third National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III) was
42 million adults. An additional 8 million Americans reported
having been told twice by a health professional that they have
HBP, but their BP was 140/90 mm Hg at the NHANES III
examination.2­4 This subgroup, termed "twice told," in-
creased the hypertension prevalence estimate to 50 million
persons. In 1999­2000, prevalence was estimated as 59
million among US adults.4 There were an additional 6 million
persons twice told, yielding a total estimate of 65 million
persons based on the NHANES 1999­2000 data.4
Since the 1960s, national examination surveys (including
NHANES) conducted by the National Center for Health
Statistics have been the principal means to track progress in
preventing, treating, and controlling hypertension and have
been benchmarks for the National High Blood Pressure
Education Program and related health objectives for the
nation.5,6 These data have generally indicated favorable
trends, ie, improvements in hypertension prevalence, aware-
ness, treatment, and control rates. Except for prevalence,
these trends persisted through 1999­2000. There was an
8.3% relative increase in the prevalence rate during the
1990s, partially attributable to the epidemic of overweight
and obesity occurring in the United States during the past 2
decades.7
In addition to articles describing hypertension trends
through the year 2000,4,7 there have been several other reports
using more recent NHANES data. A National Center for
Health Statistics data brief updated the overall trends in
hypertension through 2006 but did not address trends in
awareness, treatment, and control and did not address
changes in BP distributions or mean values.8 A report by
Ostchega et al9 analyzed trends through 2004 but only in

older persons and without the level of detail in this report. A
recent publication by Gu et al10 investigated data through
2004 but was focused primarily on hypertension treatment
patterns. This current report adds to these previous findings
through a detailed analysis of NHANES 1999­2004 related
to trends in prevalence; trends in awareness, treatment, and
control; evaluation of the role of changes in body mass index
(BMI) in the changes in hypertension prevalence; and anal-
ysis of changes in the mean values and distributions of BP
values.
Methods
Data from the NHANES are used to assess the health and nutritional
status of the civilian, noninstitutionalized US population. A nation-
ally representative sample is obtained using a complex, stratified,
multistage probability cluster sampling design. Selected subpopula-
tions are oversampled, thereby providing a larger subsample size to
yield more reliable estimates for these groups. The data used in this
article are from NHANES III (1988­1994) and NHANES 1999­
2004. Informed consent was obtained from all of the participants,
and the protocol was approved by the institutional review board of
the National Center for Health Statistics.
NHANES data were collected through a standardized household
interview with additional interviewing and a physical examination in
a mobile examination center. Respondents who were pregnant or for
whom no BP data were available were excluded from the analysis.
Because of coding changes, pregnant women could not be excluded
from the 2003­2004 portion of the data. From previous estimates,
this has an insignificant effect and would alter the prevalence of
hypertension by approximately one tenth of a percent. In both
surveys, the protocol called for 3 BP measurements at the mobile
examination center by a physician using a mercury sphygmoma-
nometer after a 5-minute rest. For NHANES III, 99% of the study
population had 3 BP measurements; for NHANES 1999­2004, the
figure was 91%. The final analytic sample consisted of 16 351
respondents for NHANES III and 14 430 respondents for NHANES
1999­2004, all age 18 years. Additional information about overall
NHANES methodology and BP measurement is available
elsewhere.11­13
Respondents were defined as having hypertension if their average
systolic BP was 140 mm Hg, their average diastolic BP was
90 mm Hg, or they reported current use of antihypertensive
medication. Awareness was defined as hypertensive respondents
having been told at least once by a health professional that they had
hypertension. Hypertensive adults were included in the treatment
category if they reported the use of a prescribed medicine for
hypertension. Among hypertensive persons, control was defined as a
systolic BP 140 mm Hg and a diastolic BP 90 mm Hg.
BMI was defined as measured weight in kilograms divided by
squared height in meters. There were 3 BMI categories: under-
weight/normal, defined as a BMI 25 kg/m2; overweight, 25 to 30
kg/m2; and obese, 30 kg/m2. Respondents were grouped into 6 age
groups: 18 to 29, 30 to 39, 40 to 49, 50 to 59, 60 to 69, and 70 years
of age. Respondents were categorized into 4 racial/ethnic groups
according to self-reported race and ethnicity: non-Hispanic white
(NHW), non-Hispanic black (NHB), Mexican American (MA), and
other. Because the "other racial/ethnic" category is a diverse group,
separate results for this group are not shown.
SAS for Windows14 (SAS Institute, Inc) and SUDAAN15 (Re-
search Triangle Institute) were used for data management and
statistical analysis. All of the estimates were weighted according to
the inverse probability of being sampled for the examination.
Sampling weights provided with the data were also adjusted for
person-level nonresponse and a poststratification adjustment to the
estimated US population.16 Age standardization was done using the
year 2000 standard17 and the age groups defined above.
Comparisons of the differences in means and percentages between
the 2 surveys were performed using linear contrasts in the SUDAAN
descript procedure. Differences between surveys for population
distributions among BP categories as defined in the Seventh Report
of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evalua-
tion, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure were evaluated using 2
tests. P values 0.05 were considered statistically significant. To
examine the effect of BMI on the trends in hypertension, logistic
regression models were examined within each racial/ethnic gender
subgroup. Each model included age as a continuous variable and the
time period of the surveys (1988­1994 or 1999­2004) as a categor-
ical variable. Two sets of models were compared, first without and
then with BMI (as a continuous variable). Adjusted odds ratios were
calculated using the logistic procedure in SUDAAN. Odds ratios of
which the 95% CI did not include unity were considered significant.
Results
Between NHANES III and the NHANES 1999­2004, the
age-standardized prevalence rate of hypertension increased
from 24.4% to 28.9% (P0.001), an 18% relative increase
(Table 1). Although there were increases in age-standardized
prevalence rates in all of the racial/ethnic-by-gender sub-
groups, increases were greater for women, and the changes in
NHW and MA men were not statistically significant. Non-
Hispanic white and black women experienced absolute in-
creases of 5%. These represent relative increases of 24% in
NHW women and 14% in NHB women. The absolute
increases in NHW and NHB men and MA women were
similar (3.0% to 3.6%).

Age-specific prevalence rates increased significantly in all
of the age groups of NHW women aged 40 years but only
in those 60 among NHW men. Similarly, in both NHB men
and women, age-specific prevalence rates increased the most
in those 60 years of age. In general, age-specific prevalence
rates did not increase significantly in MA men and women.
It is important to evaluate the relationship of increased
hypertension prevalence rates to the increasing prevalence of
overweight/obesity in the US population. The Figure presents
age-standardized prevalence rates by racial/ethnic gender
subgroups within categories of BMI for the 2 time periods.
Although the statistically significant increases between the 2
time periods are predominantly among women with BMI 30
kg/m2, there is an observed increase within every BMI strata for
all 3 of the racial/ethnic subgroups of women and NHB men.
Although the Figure shows a graphical representation of
the changes in hypertension prevalence after stratification for
levels of BMI, an evaluation using statistical modeling is
presented in Table 2. A comparison is made of the relative
increase in hypertension between the 2 periods, first adjusting
for age, which is analogous to comparing age-standardized
prevalence rates in Table 1. Note that the age-adjusted ratios
in Tables 1 and 2 are not exactly the same, because they
perform age-adjustment using different methodology, and
Table 2 shows odds ratios and Table 1 shows a ratio of
prevalence rates. Table 1 also shows the relative increase
between the 2 periods modeled as if there had been no
increase in BMI (ie, adjusted for both age and BMI). The
relative increase is measured by an odds ratio, because the
logistic model is used. For men, the relative increase (odds
ratio) in the recent NHANES compared with the earlier was
0.97 in MA men, 1.18 in NHB men, and 1.23 in NHW men.
After adjustment for BMI, there was no statistically signifi-
cant change in hypertension in men (0.87, 1.08, and 1.04,
respectively, for the same groups), indicating that the increase
in BMI accounted for nearly all of the increase in hyperten-
sion in men. For women, there were much larger relative
increases in the prevalence of hypertension in the recent
NHANES (1.33, 1.42, and 1.59 in MA, NHB, and NHW
women, respectively). However, equivalent to results from
the Figure, after adjustment for BMI there continued to be
large relative increases in the prevalence of hypertension
(1.27, 1.29, and 1.44, respectfully), indicating that some of
the increases in hypertension in women were attributable to
factors other than their increases in BMI in the recent
NHANES period.

Table 3 presents time trends in the BP distributions in the
untreated US population by Seventh Report of the Joint
National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation,
and Treatment of High Blood Pressure categories of BP.
The most notable change seen in most race-gender groups
was the upward shift in BP values, lowering the percentage
in the normal group and increasing the percentage in the
prehypertension group. This distribution change did not occur
in the MA group. The distribution change also did not occur
in those in the top 2 BMI categories but did occur in the
lowest BMI group.
Table 4 indicates that, overall, there has been some
improvement in awareness of hypertension, from 68.5% to
71.8%. However, this is most clear in NHW men (from 63%
to 70%). Overall, awareness in NHB persons has increased as
well, from 71% to 76% between the 2 time periods, mainly
among the middle-aged group. Awareness rates have not
improved for MA or NHW women and remain only 45% in
MA men ages 18 to 49 years.
Treatment rates tended to improve in all of the race-gender
subgroups, significantly in NHW and NHB men (P0.001
for each) and in NHB women (P0.05), although only
approximately half as much as in NHB men. Increases in
men, except NHW men, were largest in the middle-aged
group, whereas improvements in women were largest over
age 70 years. MA men continued to have the lowest treatment
rates, 40% overall, and only 25% in young men.
Control rates improved overall and tended to improve in all
racial/ethnic-gender groups--more among men than women.
NHB and NHW men experienced the largest increases
between the 2 time periods, and the highest control rate in
1999­2004 was observed in NHW men, who experienced an
increase from 22% to 39%. NHB men experienced a relative
increase of 80%, from 17% to 30%. Significant improve-
ment in control rates in women overall was not been
observed, although middle-aged NHB women and older MA
women experienced clear increases (each 12% absolute
change). NHW women had the highest control rate among the
racial/ethnic-gender groups in 1988­1994 but did not expe-
rience a significant increase. MA men and women continued
to experience low control rates, especially among young men
(16%) and older women (19%).
Table 5 presents the net results of the changes in terms of
mean BP levels. Age-standardized mean systolic BP in-
creased in women, by 3 mm Hg overall, whereas there were
significant increases only in nonhypertensive men. In con-
trast, age-standardized mean diastolic BPs were lower in men
in almost all of the subgroups, with an overall decrease of
3 mm Hg. Mean diastolic BP in women remained essentially
unchanged between the 2 time periods except in the treated
hypertension group.
When the definition of hypertension is expanded to ac-
count for those persons possibly obtaining BP reduction from
nonpharmacological means (ie, adding those persons with
normal BP but twice told that they have hypertension), the
age-adjusted prevalence of hypertension becomes 28.8% in
NHANES III and 32.6% in NHANES 1999­2004, 4%
higher for each time period than found in Table 1. The crude
prevalence rate of hypertension in 1999­2004 is 32.0%, with
the components of the definition being 18.8% defined by
elevated BP, 10.2% defined by control of BP from medica-
tions, and 3.0% defined by control of BP from other means.
Using this expanded definition, of all persons with hyperten-
sion in 1999­2004, 74% were aware, 65% were being treated
(56% by medications and 9% by other means), and 41% had
their HBP under control (32% by medication and 9% by other
means).
Discussion
This article updates hypertension-related trends using recent
NHANES data for the adult US population. The major
observations are as follows: (1) age-standardized hyperten-
sion prevalence rates are increasing in general, and there is no
subgroup in which they are declining, suggesting that pre-
vention efforts have not been strongly successful; (2) part but
not all of the increase in prevalence can be explained by
increasing overweight/obesity; (3) awareness, treatment, and
control rates continue to improve, so that they are higher than
ever reported; (4) among untreated persons, there is a de-
crease in the proportion with normal BPs and an increase in
the prehypertension category; (5) among each race/ethnic
group, 1 of the foregoing trends are more favorable in men
than in women, and the differentials are particularly striking
among NHW persons; and (6) although there have been
apparent gains in treatment and control among MA persons,
their rates (including awareness) remain substantially lower

How to directly measure interventions to prevent chronic
diseases continues to be difficult.18 Effective prevention of the
development of hypertension in the US population would be
evidenced by a left shift in the BP population distribution curve
over time in nonhypertensive persons.2,5,19­21 The rising preva-
lence of adults with excess weight over the study time
period partly explains why prevention of hypertension
among the US adult population has not improved.22,23 An
estimated 65% of US adults had excess weight in 1999­2002
compared with 56% in 1988­1994, and, on average, overweight
adults are getting heavier.24 The presence of obesity is strongly
associated with the development of hypertension.25 The achieve-
ment and maintenance of a more optimal standardized weight
using a healthful dietary plan, recommended levels of regular
physical activity, and other behavioral approaches are associated
with a significant reduction in BP.6,26
The presence of a similar positive relationship between
BMI and hypertension prevalence for each gender/racial/
ethnic subpopulation as observed for both time periods of this
study is consistent with results of other reports.27,28 In the
present study, increases in BMI accounted for some but not
all of the observed increases in hypertension prevalence
among adults: inclusion of BMI in the logistic regression
model reduced odds ratios associated with the survey period
by more than half in NHW and NHB men but much less in
women. Trends in obesity prevalence between 1988­1994
and 1999­2000 were similar in men and women among
NHW and MA but greater among NHB women than men.29

As of the Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure, a systolic
BP of 120 mm Hg together with a diastolic BP of 80 mm Hg has been defined as "normal BP." The successively higher categories are classified
as determined by the higher category for systolic BP or diastolic BP. NS indicates not statistically significant, P0.05.
*Survey A is NHANES 1988­1994 and survey B is NHANES 1999­2004.
The P value is a test of a difference in the distribution of BP categories between surveys A and B.

More recently, obesity or overweight have been increasing
more in men than in women.30
Factors other than obesity likely contributed to the increase
in hypertension over the study time period, such as improved
survival of hypertensive persons because of better treatment.
Other potential determinants could include increasing con-
sumption of dietary sodium, the increasingly sedentary life-
style of the US population (regular physical activity at
recommended levels is associated with lower BP), suboptimal
levels of health literacy among the general US population
(adoption and maintenance of healthful behaviors may be
correlated with higher levels of health literacy), lack of early
access to health plan coverage or to high-quality preventive
healthcare services, and other factors including changes in
alcohol and potassium consumption.31­33 In 1999­2002, 9%
to 10% of US adults 18 to 64 years of age had health plan
coverage from public sources, and 72% to 75% had private
health plan coverage.34 Effective treatment of hypertension
significantly reduces the risk of adverse clinical outcomes,
including end stage renal disease and morbidity/mortality
attributable to myocardial infarction, stroke, and heart
failure.6,35,36

The more favorable overall trend for men compared with
women in this study was unexpected in view of a generally
greater access to care for women.37 On the other hand,
access to care may play a role in recent trends, because in
2002 more women than men did not get medical care
(5.2% versus 4.2%) or delayed it because of concerns
about cost (7.1% versus 6.0%).37
Subgroup analyses among the race/ethnic subpopulations
showed similar men-more-than-women improvement pat-
terns as the overall population, but with women retaining
higher rates. Among hypertensive NHB persons, both men
(by 14%) and women (by 7%) showed significant improve-
ments in treatment rates (33% and 11% in relative terms,
respectively). Whether these outcomes reflect the impact of
gender/racial/ethnic-focused efforts or are the result of other
factors remains to be determined.38 Although there was a
nonsignificant improvement in the treatment and control rates
among MA men, their very low awareness, treatment, and
control rates demonstrate the need for and use of additional
focused efforts in this subpopulation.39
The ultimate clinical practice objective for the manage-
ment of hypertensive individuals and a very important public
health target is the achievement of BP control.40 Estimated
hypertension control rates improved from 26.0% to 35.0%, a
relative increase of 34.5% for the overall US adult popula-
tion. The overall gender difference in improvement of control
rates over the study period is striking and may represent the
results of targeted efforts. The 50% relative improvement in
the control rate for MAs was significant and consistent with
observations for treatment rates, but the persisting low rates
underscore the need for additional attention.
The new findings show that men had higher systolic and
diastolic BP than women, but the differences were signifi-
cantly less in 1999­2004 compared with 1988­1994. The
observed 2-mm Hg increase in mean systolic BP among the
overall US adult population over the study period is primarily
attributable to the SBP increase among women. Conversely,
mean diastolic BP fell by 1 mm Hg overall because of a
statistically significant 3-mm Hg decline in men, whereas
there was no significant change in women. The basis for the
more favorable overall BP trends for men compared with
women may be attributable to the increased percentage who
are aware, treated, and controlled in men but not in women.
Qualifications and Limitations
Hypertension prevalence rates reported in this study are for
the overall nonpregnant, noninstitutionalized, nonmilitary US
population. Accordingly, a potential underestimation bias
may exist in view of the fact that a relatively high proportion
of adults in nursing homes, hospices, chronic disease hospi-
tals, and other chronic care facilities have hypertension.
Although this effect is offset by exclusion of adults likely to
have normal BP (eg, many military personnel), the extent of
the offset was not estimated.
Estimates are provided that both exclude and briefly
include a subpopulation that has been traditionally over-
looked: those who were nonhypertensive at the time of the
survey but who have been told at least twice that they have
hypertension. Exclusion of this subpopulation permits a more
direct comparison with previous studies that only evaluated
adults who were hypertensive by direct measurement or
reported use of antihypertensive medication. Inclusion of this
subpopulation who reported previously confirmed hyperten-
sion but whose BP was controlled by means other than
antihypertensive medication (eg, nonpharmacologic therapy
or diminished left ventricular function) is more representative
of the overall population.41,42
Each data collection period occurred over 6 years. This
approach ensures a large enough sample size and represents a
strength of this study. However, trends occurring within each
6-year period were not evaluated in these analyses.
Although the sample size for the MA subpopulation was
smaller than for the other racial/ethnic groups in NHANES
III, it was actually larger than for the NHB subpopulation in
the 1999­2004 survey. Accordingly, the historical difficulties

with achieving large enough sample sizing by oversampling

Perspectives
Effective prevention, detection, treatment, and control of
HBP continue to be important goals for health policy, public
health, and medical care decision makers, as well as advo-
cates and individuals at risk for hypertension.43 A positive
impact of their aggregate efforts, interventions, and health
behaviors will likely be reflected in improvements in key
BP-related trends (or vice versa). For example, hypertension
control rates have risen progressively from 1976 to 1980 to
1999 to 2004. However, the same data underscore the fact
that there is still much that needs to be accomplished to
further improve hypertension control rates for the US
population.44
The overall hypertension prevalence trend for 1988­1994
to 1999­2004 is upward, driven primarily by a rise among
women. This is contrary to the Healthy People 2010 objective
that set as a goal to reduce the percentage of hypertension to
an overall age-standardized prevalence in adults of 14%.45
The fact that rates are rising in the context of progressive rise
in age and BMI of the overall population is of particular
concern from a public health policy, as well as a medical care
perspective. There are important unanswered questions about
why the proportion of women with hypertension is rising 2
times faster than for men.
Although important progress continues to be made in the
area of awareness, treatment, and control, the need continues
to be high for interventions that will ultimately halt and
reverse this rising tide of hypertension prevalence. The rapid
improvements in BP control in some groups does suggest that
the Health People 2010 objective to achieve a goal of 68%
under control may have a chance of succeeding, eg, in NHW
men. However, the very low control rates in some groups,
such as 21% in MA men, indicate continued critical dispar-
ities in health care access and implementation. A better
understanding of what is impeding further progress in the
treatment of hypertension in women, especially NHW
women, is needed. To the extent that it reflects a lack of
appreciation of the importance of cardiovascular disease in
women, progress may be stimulated by campaigns launched
since 2003 by the federal government, voluntary agencies,
and advocacy groups focusing on raising public and clinician
awareness regarding the importance of preventing, detecting,
and treating heart disease in women.
