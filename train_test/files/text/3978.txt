Introduction
Several faith-based organizations are engaged in social ser-
vice, which also entails personal spiritual growth and devel-
opment of faith among the recipients (Weisbrod, 1998). This
service engagement can be seen as their partnering in larger
development goals in an essentially resource-limited setting
(Hester, 2002; Kline, 2010; Wills et al., 2009). Generally, the
main mission of faith-based organizations is to propagate
faith, and hence religious imagery accompanies the service
mission (Ebaugh, Pipes, Chafetz, & Daniels, 2003). This in
turn influences aspects of leadership in faith-based organiza-
tions, practical functioning, finance, and policy issues (Cook,
1997). The overall understanding is to cultivate a faith-based
context for service (Kaplan, Calman, Golub, Ruddock, &
Billings, 2006; Kaplan et al., 2009).
This faith-based service also generates a social capital
among stakeholders, as it develops communes and associa-
tions around faith institutions (Boix & Posner, 1998). Social
capital is defined by Putnam (1995) as "features of social
organization such as networks, norms and social trust that
facilitate co-ordination and co-operation for mutual benefit"
(p. 66). Viewed as an asset for mutually beneficial collective
action, Putnam (2000) has further specified two types of
social capital--bonding and bridging. Bonding social capital
is more inward looking and tends to reenforce exclusive
identities and homogeneous groups. Bridging social capital
is oriented toward external linkage to assets and information
diffusion and can generate broader identities and reciprocity.
Religion and faith are instruments in promoting social capi-
tal through varied institutional forms (Fukuyama, 1995).
Faith-based service efforts in particular create a net of stake-
holders, which take the shape of communes and habitus of
adherents. In the case of social services (such as health, edu-
cation, livelihood initiatives, and other social projects), there
are project beneficiaries who align to these institutions.
The focus of this article is to look at the beneficiaries or
recipients of social service initiatives of a particular type of
faith-based organizations in India--broadly termed as Indic
faith-based organizations (IFBOs). According to Berger
(2003), faith-based voluntary organizations can be defined as
formal organizations whose identity and mission are self-
consciously derived from the teachings of one or more reli-
gious or spiritual traditions and which operate on a nonprofit,
independent voluntary basis to promote and realize

Beneficiaries of Social Initiatives of Indic
Faith-Based Organizations: Profiles,
Service Experiences, and Implications
Samta P. Pandya1
Abstract
This article is based on a study of a sample of 966 beneficiaries of selected social initiatives across nine Indic Faith-Based
Organizations (IFBOs) in India. Findings revealed that IFBO beneficiary profiles resemble the general public welfare user
in terms of financial/economic status. Service experiences entailed duration, type, influence of faith in terms of teachings,
vision­mission familiarity, and personnel contact. In general, there was a fairly sustained duration of service obtained and
sacredness/faith permeated into varied aspects of service provision. The main beneficiary self-implication was functional need
fulfillment. Some transcendental aspects and faith cohesiveness also entered the picture. Perceived implications for society
were in terms of contribution to social growth and development, spreading the organizational message, and demonstration
of social innovations guided by organizational ideology. Some contentions on perceived differentials vis-à-vis other social
initiatives were that the teacher/members of the order and faith marked the difference.

collectively articulated ideas about the public good at the
national or international levels. Although faith-based volun-
tary organizations operate within the same legal and political
frameworks of secular civil society institutions, their mis-
sions and operations are guided by a concept of the divine
and the recognition of the sacred nature of human life
(Anhelm, 1999). In contrast to the rights-based approach of
many secular NGOs, the starting point of religious organiza-
tions is the duty-oriented language of religion characterized
by obligations toward the divine and others, by a belief in the
transformative capacities and a concern for justice and rec-
onciliation (Falk, 2001). Carlson-Thies (1999) proposed that
faith-based organizations specialize in or are particularly
well suited for certain kinds of social service activities such
as holistic social service delivery that focuses on personal
transformation. This assumption is evident in the "ur-text" of
compassionate conservatism, and it is often made explicit by
those who advocate for an expanded role for faith-based
organizations in the social welfare system. There are condi-
tions that facilitate the flourishing of faith-based organiza-
tions, which entail providing followers an access to the
sacred at the deep level, engendering experiences of the
sacred, breaking down the dichotomy between mind and
body in worship so as to experiment with worship styles
(sometimes including music) and hence communicating with
the new generation, and giving credence to theology as
emerging out of members' own experiences of the sacred
(Landres & Bolger, 2007).
The origins of Indic faith-based voluntary organizations
can be traced to the 19th-century period of Hindu reform
movements. Similar to congregations in the United States,
these faith-based voluntary organizations have formed an
integral aspect of voluntary action/initiatives in the area of
welfare and development in the Indian context
(Mukhopadhyay, 1995; Paul Chaudhary, 1971; Sen, 1998). A
theoretical support to this epistemic link comes from Weber's
emphasis on faith as an independent causal element influenc-
ing action throughout history. In the Weberian sense, just like
how Calvinist modernity inspired political revolutions,
which since the 17th century irreversibly transformed
Western feudal societies into bourgeoisie democratic nation-
states, the Indian version of Reformation (to use Talal Asad's
cultural contextualization) was marked by the rediscovery,
reinterpretation and public dissemination of Vedanta or the
philosophy of nonduality (Van Bijlert, 2003), which these
organizations undertook on a grand scale.
IFBOs are those aligning and adhering to tenets of Indic
faiths and syncretic tenets therein. Indic faiths are system-
atized faiths that have their origin in the Indian subcontinent
and constitute the core subject matter of Indological studies
(Madan, 2004). In terms of Indic faith-based voluntary orga-
nizations, there is a further bifurcation--those aligning to the
tenets of the theistic gnostic school inferring particularly
from Vedic tenets, post-Vedic developments and contempo-
rary strands within the purview of Hinduism. The stances
could be purist or syncretic depending upon the orientation
of the charismatic leader/teacher (Copley, 2000). The other
category is of those organizations adhering primarily to the
atheistic agnostic school--the Indic pragmatists aligning to
tenets of Jainism, Buddhism, and the multifarious sects and
cults therein (Warder, 2000).
Most of the organizations within the theistic gnostic realm
are headed by teachers or gurus and/or their disciples, their
ideological leanings basically translating into the ideology,
vision, or mission of the organizations. These are institution-
alized religious structures that represent change of religion as
a social institution over time. They question hegemony and
yet remain traditional in many ways, thereby characterizing
a soft revolution (because they do not take on issues directly
but do so by remaining within norms of tradition; Rustau,
2003). Beckerlegge (2003) posited these organizations as
signifying a simplification of traditional tenets. "Hindu
India" (as the imagination of an ideal nation conceived by
them) herein is presented as an embodiment of the divine and
the focus is on "service" of the "Hindu nation." Two ele-
ments that characterize these organizations are spiritual uni-
versalism and cultural nationalism, that is, universality of the
spiritual reality or Brahman and the cultural importance of
"one India" (Heehs, 2003). These organizations answered
challenges posed by colonialism by the "invention of tradi-
tion" and "translation of carefully selected elements of the
indigenous cultural repertoire of the orient vis-à-vis the occi-
dent." However, in doing so, they also ended up confirming
the hegemonic claims of these alien categories (Fischer-Tine,
2003). These organizations are in many ways "Hinduizing
agents" popularizing the nationalist ideology of Hindutva
proponents. However, the contemporary phenomenon is that
of avatar gurus--important element in whose endeavor to
fulfill the earthly missions is the setting up of institutional
organizations. There are elaborate mechanics of institutional
building: ethics of seva (service) as crucial to the spirit of
institution building. Thus, seva is panegyric, that is, it consti-
tutes an expression of the Hindu topography of the self where
the prototypical act of worship is the glorification of the
divine (Warrier, 2003).
Characteristically thus, IFBOs have an associate/adherent
base, undertake social initiatives and attempt to "reach out"
and thereby also constitute a beneficiary base. The process is
a dual one--wherein at one level IFBOs attempt to "serve"
and at another "spread the normative-ideational message"
and thereby consolidate their base. With social projects as
the entry point, this article attempts to examine these IFBOs'
beneficiaries' profiles, service experiences, and perceived
implications for self and society. Through this profile map-
ping of IFBOs' social service projects beneficiaries, looking
at their service experiences and the perceived implications of
this service for themselves and society at large, the attempt is
to then broadly analyze the social stake of IFBOs. Social
stake refers to understanding IFBOs as actors in civil society
and as generators of social capital.

Faith-Based Program Beneficiaries
Studies have attempted to look at the effectiveness of pro-
grams administered by faith-based organizations. Primarily,
the focus has been on beneficiary/clientele satisfaction as a
parameter for efficacy (Ferguson, Wu, Sprujit-Metz, &
Dyrness, 2007). Earlier studies are those of church-based
programs for prisoner beneficiaries (Johnson, 2002; Johnson,
Larson, & Pitts, 1997; O'Connor, Su, Ryan, Parikh, &
Alexander, 1997) and church/congregation-based health pro-
grams for larger beneficiary groups (Brudenell, 2003;
Campbell et al., 2000; Fox, Stein, Gonsalez, Farrenkopf, &
Dellinger, 1998). Yet another genre is on church programs
for youth beneficiaries on areas of substance abuse and crime
prevention (Berrien, McRoberts, & Winship, 2000; Hood,
2000). Further beneficiaries of employment generation pro-
grams of churches/congregations have been studied
(Kennedy & Bielefeld, 2003; Kim, 2001). Evaluation studies
on church's work with youth and vulnerable families have
also been undertaken (Thompson, 1994; Winship &
Reynolds, 2003; Wuthnow, Hackett, & Hsu, 2004).
In the Indian context in particular, there are a few studies
on "devotees" of faith-based organizations, with little focus
on faith-based organizations' social programs and the corre-
sponding beneficiaries. Studies are largely descriptive
accounts of socioreligious organizations highlighting their
ideological underpinnings, social outreach, and implications
(White, 1992; Williams, 1984). Some ethnographic works
have highlighted the involvement of these organizations with
"subaltern groups" or "people on the margins" (Hardimann,
2007; Shah, 2006). Translation of IFBOs' social service
efforts in the diaspora with beneficiaries of other nations
(other than India) has received a mention in works of
Squarcini (2000), Crnic (2009), and M. Wood (2010).
Squarcini and Crnic have studied the devotees of International
Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON) in the
Diaspora and M. Wood has looked at the devotees of the
Jalaram Bapa (a 19th-century Gujarati saint) tradition in the
United Kingdom. Further specific faith and spiritual tech-
niques of Art of Living Foundation called the Sudarshan
Kriya and Pranayama (SK&P) and Integral Yoga (IY) of Sri
Aurobindo Ashram and Society, have received scientific
treatments. Other such practices are Integrated Meditation,
Transcendental Meditation, and Raja Yoga. There is a body
of systematic scientific literature examining the efficacy of
SK&P procedure for health and well-being--such as effi-
cacy for dysthymic patients and for patients of depression
and melancholia (Gangadhar, Janakiramaiah, Sudarshan, &
Shetty, 1999; Janakiramaiah et al., 2000). Efficacy of SK&P
on brain function, regulating blood cortisol or stress hor-
mone, and for treatment of stress, anxiety, and depression has
also been studied. The effects of SK&P for improving the
health and well-being of individuals with HIV/AIDS and
substance abuse (Vedamurthachar et al., 2006) have also
been examined as also in counseling postdisaster situations
(Descilo et al., 2009). With respect to the IY technique, some
of the interpretations available are that of reversal of con-
sciousness (Dalal, 2001); and the alterations in the con-
sciousness process (which in turn encompasses three
functional subsystems--attention, awareness, and memory;
Narayanan, 2001). Considering that IFBOs historically have
engaged in social service activities, cumulative data on their
social service project beneficiaries are required. An initial
effort has been made in the present study.
Method
The objectives are to examine the (a) sociodemographic pro-
files, (b) service experiences, (c) perceived self-society
implications of the beneficiaries, and (d) perceived distinc-
tiveness from other social initiatives. A two-stage sampling
procedure was adopted. In the first stage, the range of IFBOs
was mapped and the universe of IFBOs (inferring from the
theistic gnostic school) was charted. With the core criteria of
social engagements, the sampling frame was determined
from which nine IFBOs were selected with the additional cri-
teria of era of origin, core ideological orientation as in the
vision­mission (primarily faith-oriented and spiritual or pri-
marily political) and size. Seven of the nine organizations
selected qualify as faith-based movements with a global
spread and two have intercountry branches and a different
kind of translocal presence entailing a virtual export of the
charisma. Virtual export refers to online presence of the
IFBO and its charismatic teacher. Two projects/social initia-
tives per organization (total 18) were identified through con-
venience and selective sampling. Permissions were a key
component in determining which social projects would be
selected. Three projects were on health issues (including out-
reach programs and health support services), two on liveli-
hoodissues,fiveonruraldevelopment,twoonecology-related
issues (natural resource development) and one each on edu-
cation, disaster management/rehabilitation, customized pro-
gram, that is, training/outreach program backed by the
IFBO's ideology, residential institution and services for the
elderly, residential institution for children, economic empow-
erment, and leadership skills/life skills development.
In the second stage, beneficiaries, that is, those availing of
the project services on record were identified through a mod-
ified version of probability proportional to size (PPS) sam-
pling. Herein the sites were preidentified as the 18 projects/
programs of the IFBOs. The cumulative total number of ben-
eficiaries for each project (as available in documented form)
is the universe/population, which was 19,322 (across 18
project sites). One twentieth of the total (keeping in mind
cost and time considerations) was the desired sample size,
that is, the sampling interval was fixed at 20 and random start
at one. Starting from the first project to the 18th, every 20th
beneficiary was interviewed (with movement to next in
range in case of nonresponse). This ensured equivalent cov-
erage across projects as also a random and representative
4 SAGE Open
sample considering the range of projects, issues covered,
geographical spread as also aspects of access, permission,
and language. Defining the sampling universe by placing all
project beneficiaries in a single sequence and identifying the
sample from the cumulative total of beneficiaries ensured a
"probability proportional to project beneficiary population
size" sample. The total sample size for beneficiaries is 966,
and the average response rate was 74.76%. Beneficiary data
were collected through a structured interview schedule.
Specific questions were on sociodemographic profile, dura-
tion, and nature of service obtained, perceived influence of
faith on service delivery, familiarity with respective IFBOs'
vision­mission as well as teachings and personnel contact
during service delivery. Semi-open-ended questions were
posed in terms of perceived implications for self, society, and
perceived differentials vis-à-vis other social initiatives.
Qualitative responses on perceived implications were coded
using the Atlas ti computer package prior to statistical proce-
dures. The statistical analysis was done using the SPSS 15
computer package. Univariate and bivariate analysis of data
has been undertaken with regression analysis of perceived
implications by beneficiaries for self and society at large. All
the predictor nominal variables were recoded into binary
(dummy) or suitable contrast variables for the multiple linear
regression procedures.
Main Findings
Project/Program Type and Background
Characteristics of Beneficiaries
As depicted in Table 1, the beneficiaries of the IFBOs under
the study sampled as per the PPS sampling strategy were dis-
tributed as per the project/program type thus. Close to one
fourth (26.7%) were beneficiaries of the rural development
programs of the IFBOs. About 17.1% were beneficiaries of
ecology-related programs and 13.5% of the health projects.
Close to one tenth (9.3%) benefited from the livelihood pro-
grams followed by economic empowerment and leadership
skills/life skills development programs (7.3%). Other pro-
grams included disaster management, residential institutions,
and services for the elderly, customized programs referring
to group-specific projects (such as training of trainers and
prison programs), and educational and residential institu-
tions for children. Age distribution revealed that majority
(70.4%) were in the age groups 30 to 69 years. Close to three
fifth of the beneficiaries (59.3%) resided in rural areas and
approximately one fourth (26.1%) resided in semiurban set-
tings. About 50.8% of the beneficiaries were women and
49.2% were men. Majority (62.2%) were married, about one
tenth (9.5%) were never married, and close to one fourth
(23.3%) were widowed. Majority (81.9%) were Hindus and
therestalignedtootherreligions(whichincludedChristianity,
Zoroastrianism, Sikhism, and Islam in small proportions). A
third (32.6%) belonged to the general category in terms of
ethnicity, about 30.4% belonged to backward classes, sched-
uled caste (28.2%), and scheduled tribes (8.8%).
In terms of education level, one tenth of the beneficiaries
were graduates and 7.8% had no formal education. Close to
a fourth each had education up to primary school (23.2%), up
to secondary school (24.9%), and up to higher secondary
school (26%). About 8% had postgraduate and professional-
level qualifications. Majority (32.6%) were undertaking
agricultural labor, two fifth (20.3%) undertook part-time
work, 16% were self-employed, and 12.3% were never
employed. About 9.1% were in service, 5.1% were retired,
and 4.6% undertook some home-based work. Approximately
half (51.6%) had a monthly per capita expenditure estimate
(MPCE; in INR) of less than INR500. About one third
(30.1%) had an estimate ranging from INR501 to INR1,000.
Hence, majority (81.7%) of the beneficiaries' had lower
expenditure levels and half were in the poverty bracket.
Service Experiences
In terms of duration of services obtained, as depicted in
Table 2, more than two fifth (42.4%) had availed of project/
program services of IFBOs for 2 years and more. About one
fifth had obtained services for 6 months to 2 years (22.3%)
and 3 to 6 months (19.2%), respectively. Hence majority
(83.9%) had obtained services for 3 months and more. Nature
of services obtained included approximately one third
(29.9%) availing services entailing development of liveli-
hood means. About 13.8% availed health-related services and
12.3% used watershed and farm mechanism support. Other
services included renewable energy/natural resource develop-
ment programs (9.9%), listening to spiritual discourse for
self-development (9.3%), education services (6.1%), housing
support/reconstruction (6.2%), technical support for agro/cot-
tage industry (6.5%), residential care (95.4%), and food relief
and other modes of sustenance (0.5%).
About two fifth (39.9%) of the beneficiaries did not see
the influence of faith in service delivery. Close to one third
(34.8%) of them perceived the influence to some extent and
one fourth (25.4%) saw the influence to a large extent. In
terms of familiarity/orientation to the organizational vision­
mission, close to one fourth proposed that it happened at the
initial stage (24.9%). About 24.1% said that the organiza-
tional vision­mission was not discussed. Few however said
that it was done occasionally (21%) or that periodic sessions
were held (20%). About one tenth of the beneficiaries pro-
posed that such exercises were undertaken always. Majority
(65%) of the beneficiaries were familiar with the teachings
of the charismatic guru (the main teacher or seer to whom the
followers have been attracted on the basis of their allure).
Close to a third (32.2%) proposed that the personnel contact
during service was of the monastic order members. More
than two fifth (42.4%) proposed that staff contact was most
during service delivery and a tenth (10.4%) proposed that
they came in contact with senior member adherents.

On the Pearson's chi-square test of association, most of
the background variables had significant association with
the duration of services obtained. In a similar vein, some
associations between background characteristics and
nature of services found to be significant were place of
residence, 2(18) =565.073, p < .001, contingency coeffi-
cient = .608; sex, 2(9) = 128.396, p < .001, contingency
coefficient = .343; ethnicity, 2(27) = 460.587, p < .001,
contingency coefficient = .568; MPCE, 2(27) = 626.791, p
< .001, contingency coefficient = .627; religion, 2(9) =
60.576, p < .001, contingency coefficient = .243; marital
status, 2(27) = 302.971, p < .001, contingency coefficient
= .489; education, 2(36) = 545.886, p < .001, contingency
coefficient = 0.601; and occupation, 2(36) = 1,087.537, p
< .001, contingency coefficient = 0.728. The association
between project/program type and nature of services was
highly significant, 2(45) = 3,738.323, p < .001, contin-
gency coefficient = 0.891.
In terms of influence of faith during service delivery, on
the Pearson's chi-square test of significance of association,
except sex, 2(2) = 4.623, p = .099, contingency coefficient
= .069, all the other associations were significant. Further
in terms of familiarity/orientation to organizational vision­
mission­objectives (i.e., the primary ideology and goal
with which they work and things they propose to do),
except religion, 2(4) = 1.227, p = .874, contingency coef-
ficient = .036, all the other associations were significant.
This shows the bridging character of IFBOs wherein famil-
iarization of organizational vision­mission­objectives to
those who came in contact happened irrespective of their
religion of origin.
Similarly in terms of familiarity with teachings of the
charismatic guru, all associations were significant, except
sex, 2(1) = 0.944, p = .331, contingency coefficient = .031,
and to some extent religion, 2(2) = 6.099, p = .047, contin-
gency coefficient = .079. In terms of personnel contact dur-
ing service delivery, on the Pearson's chi-square test of
significance, all the associations except religion were signifi-
cant. This probably provides testimony to the fact that IFBOs
undertake mass outreach through monastic order members,
senior adherents, staff, and volunteers and endeavor to cater
to maximum possible beneficiaries irrespective of their reli-
gion of origin. The idea could be to accumulate as much reli-
giosocial capital and brand building through bridging
policies.
Perceived Implications for Self, Society, and
Distinctiveness From Other Social Initiatives
In terms of implications for self, as depicted in Table 3,
approximately half (49.9%) of the respondents proposed that
IFBOs projects enabled meeting their livelihood needs and
ensured self-sufficiency. About 16.6% saw them as building

as contributing to social growth and development. The direct
corollary was that of service (31.5%)--IFBOs engagement
perceived as doing noble service to society. Close to one
tenth proposed that the IFBOs through their service projects
enabled spreading the organizational message (10.7%), pro-
vided support to similar other initiatives (9.3%) and demon-
strated social innovations guided by organizational ideology
(9.1%).
In terms of perceptions of difference from other social ini-
tiatives, approximately one third (32.3%) of the beneficiaries
proposed that the teacher/members of the order made the dif-
ference. A little more than one fifth (22.3%) proposed that
something is unique in terms of orientation (i.e., they felt that
something was different and distinct in their ideology and
approach)--however, they could not articulate the exact
nature of the difference. About 16.9% said that there was no
difference between IFBOs social initiatives and those of
other organizations and an equal proportion (16.8%) said
that they could not say what the difference was. However,
about one tenth (11.8%) of the beneficiaries clearly proposed
that faith made the difference.
On the Pearson's chi-square test of significance, all the
associations between background characteristics as also
intermediary service experiences variables and perceived
implications for self were significant. Similarly on the
Pearson's chi-square test of significance of association, all
the associations between the background variables, service
experience variables, and perceived implications
for society were significant. Hence, all the factors of the
background variables contributed in some measure to dif-
ferentials in views on perceived implications of the IFBOs
social service engagement for society. In terms of perspec-
tives on difference vis-à-vis other social initiatives, on the
Pearson's chi-square test of significance, except religion
all the other associations were significant. Hence, religion
of the beneficiaries did not significantly affect their per-
ceptions on whether the IFBO social initiatives were dif-
ferent vis-à-vis other social initiatives. All associations
between service experiences variables and perceived dis-
tinctiveness of IFBOs social initiatives, were significant as
follows: duration of services, 2(16) = 39.766, p < .001,
contingency coefficient = .199; nature of services, 2(36) =
308.615, p < .001, contingency coefficient = .492; influ-
ence of faith during service delivery, 2(8) = 90.520, p <
.001, contingency coefficient = .293; familiarity with orga-
nizational vision­mission­objectives, 2(16) = 236.597, p
< .001, contingency coefficient = .444; familiarity with the
teachings of the charismatic guru, 2(4) = 106.579, p <
.001, contingency coefficient = .315; and, personnel con-
tact during service delivery, 2(12) = 58.071, p < .001, con-
tingency coefficient = .240.
In the regression model depicted in Table 4, the adjusted
R2 is 27.5%, that is, about 27.5% of the variability of the
perceived implications on self (of beneficiaries' of IFBOs'
services/projects) is explained by background characteristics
and intermediary variables/constructs. The standard error of

Discussion and Conclusion
IFBOs' beneficiary respondents of the study aligned to a
range of programs, the core ones being rural development,
ecology, health as also livelihood development, and economic
empowerment projects. Residential services and customized
programs also featured on the list. From Wuthnow et al.'s
findings (2004), it can be concluded that the

recipients/beneficiary profiles of IFBO services resemble
those of general public welfare user profile in terms of finan-
cial/economic status. However, contrary to global faith-based
organizations that claim to attract a diverse constituency of
people with needs, the IFBOs under study had a different
take. Although they claim to cater to a cross-sectional benefi-
ciary group, in reality, the leaning is more toward majoritar-
ian/Hindu preferences. This takes the form of ethnoreligious
nationalism, which asserts the primacy of Hindu worldview
(which is the religion of the majority in India) and seeks to
establish a Hindu nation based upon conservative interpreta-
tion of Hindu religious values (Hansen, 2009). Hence, vis-à-
vis Putnam's bridging capital, what is probably seen in terms
of IFBO beneficiary outreach is a selective-exclusive bridg-
ing--cross-sectional in principle but parochial in reality. This
could also be due to the faith paraphernalia that generally
accompanies the service delivery package. Access/service
attainment then automatically gets restricted to those for
whom the accompaniment is palatable (this is assuming that
in a social service providing scenario with multiple choices,
recipients have the agency of informed decision making).
Faith influence in service delivery and the degree of ben-
eficiaries' familiarity with respective IFBO ideologies and
teachings of the charismatic guru shows the faith-embedded-
ness of IFBOs' service. Faith-embeddedness refers to the
fact that all social service activities of these IFBOs have a
strong and ingrained component of faith in them. The idea is
to bring faith in the public forum beyond rituals and toward
a community orientation (Isaac, 2003). This is what then the
beneficiaries tended to identify as an anchor. Sacredness as
permeating into varied aspects of the social--diffusing but
never diminishing, becomes the operational protocol
(McCorkle, Bohn, Hughes, & Kim, 2005). Although the
comprehension of IFBOs' social services is within certain
cultural­social­economic­political contexts (see Bertrand,
2005; Johnsdotter, Ingvarsdotter, Östman, & Carlbom,
2011), faith revivifies the service story (see also Gilbert,
2010; Joseph, 2011). Furthermore, although the service per
se has an unblemished, puritan overtone with the modus ope-
randi belying a secularist feel, components of the IFBOs'
characters seep into the beneficiary consciousness as well
(see E. Wood, Watson, & Hayter, 2011). One of the ways this
happens is the recognition and acceptance of religiosity/spir-
ituality as an important psychosocial variable (see also
Pargament, Murray-Swank, & Tarakeshwar, 2005; Pesut,
Clark, Maxwell, & Michalak, 2011; Schettino et al., 2011).
This religiosity/spirituality, in relation to the "beneficiary
self," leads to virtue and cultural development (see also
Sandage & Harden, 2011).
The fourfold beneficiaries' perceived implications of self
can be grouped as (a) functional need fulfillment, (b) self-
enhancement and actualization, (c) communitas develop-
ment, and (c) faith-embeddedness. Functional need
fulfillment is generally seen as enhancing the quality of life,
providing social support and aiding coping and adjustment
efforts, that is, sociocultural adaptation (see also Ai, Tice,

Huang, Rodgers, & Bolling, 2008; Klemens & Bikos, 2009;
Krause, 2010; Somlai & Heckman, 2000). Self-enhancement
and actualization is viewed as a processual focus on con-
sciousness--transcending the ego and cultivating an image
of God in the psyche. A dual emphasis is thus placed on the
totality of the conscious and unconscious mind; and God
image as an object relational concept tending toward the
divine (see alsoAird, Scott, McGrath, Najman, &Al Mamun,
2010; Schaap-Jonker, Eurelings-Bontekoe, Verhagen, &
Zock, 2002; Watts, 2000). Inferring from Valentine and
Sweet (1999), it can be said that IFBOs mediate a mindful-
ness among the beneficiaries--of the faith orientation and
the charismatic guru. Most of them who are aware and famil-
iar with the teachings and IFBO vision­mission valorize
them and align to them--consciously and unconsciously.
There develops, among the beneficiary subset, a trajectory of
relational and contextual reasoning entailing recognition,
reconciliation, and transcendence of contradiction (Blakeney,
Blakeney, & Reich, 2005) toward a spiritual awakening of
sorts. The beneficiary self is deemed to then move from an
existential split to a recovered integrity facilitated by the
IFBOs (see also Tarakeshwar, Hansen, Kochman, &
Sikkema, 2005). Communitas development entails a subjec-
tive social support through the faith-based program partici-
pation (see also Dulin, 2005). Faith-embeddedness is a
manifestation of salience and practice frequency and belief
in the remedial capacities of divine intervention--something
that emerges out of faith-based program affiliation (see also
Baker & Cruickshank, 2009; Kwilecki, 2004; Village, 2005).
For IFBOs, the mandate is to bring faith back into the pub-
lic realm. The service ideology is mediated actively by reli-
gious­civil practices combining philanthropy and rituals.
Norms of community organizing around the faith principle
are created. Hence, in mapping the beneficiary contours of
IFBOs, what also emerges is that apart from service provision
and material need fulfillment, the mandate of ideational/ideo-
logical proliferation persists. Hence the social capital forma-
tion and social outreach through the social service exercise
does get colored to some extent with the "faith agenda" of the
IFBOs. In the complexity of the fabric with the "push of
IFBO faith" and the "pull of larger socioeconomic needs,"
drawing boundaries of mandate and determining the "best fit"
service package that does not impinge too hard ideationally
on the beneficiaries' belief systems remains a challenge.
