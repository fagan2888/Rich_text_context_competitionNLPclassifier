Introduction
Fear and anxiety are accompanied by similar and over-
lapping responses; however, there are important differ-
ences. Anxiety is a response to an anticipated threat,
uncertainty, or lack of control, while fear is an emotional
response to a specific situation or stimulus that is per-
ceived as a danger.1­4 Both fear and anxiety are adaptive
responses, associated with autonomic activation, that
can negatively affect the cat's health and welfare, weaken
the human­animal bond and lead to behavioral issues
such as aggression, avoidance and soiling, which are a
major cause of relinquishment.1,5 However, behavioral
strategies differ depending on the individual, stimulus
and environment. Fear triggers defensive behaviors
including fight, flight and freeze, fearful facial
expressions and body postures, startle and displacement
behaviors arising from conflict (eg, yawning, lip licking,
circling).1,2,4 In addition, fear suppresses distress vocali-
zation.6 The anxiety response is related to uncertainty

Abstract
Objectives This study assessed the anxiolytic effectiveness of a test diet (Royal Canin Feline Calm diet)
supplemented with L-tryptophan and alpha-casozepine.
Methods Subjects were 24 cats that were classified as mildly or markedly fearful based on the presence of a
person in their home room. Three different protocols were used to assess anxiety: (1) evaluation of the response
to a human in the cat's home room (home room test); (2) analysis of the response to placement in an empty test
room (open-field test); and (3) analysis of the response to an unfamiliar human (human interaction test). All three
protocols were first run at baseline, and the results were used to assign the animals to control and test diet groups
that showed equivalent fear and anxiety. Both groups were retested on the three protocols after 2 weeks (test 1)
and again after 4 weeks (test 2).
Results The diet groups differed for two behavioral measures in the open-field test: inactivity duration and inactivity
frequency. The control group showed statistically significant increases in inactivity duration between baseline and
test 1 and baseline and test 2, while the group fed the test diet showed a marginally not significant decrease in
inactivity duration between baseline and test 1 and a not significant decrease for test 2. There was also a significant
increase in inactivity frequency between baseline and test 1 in the test diet group and marginally not significant
decrease in the control group. There were no differences between groups in the approach of the cats toward people
for the home room test and the human interaction test.
Conclusions and relevance These results suggest that the test diet reduced the anxiety response to placement in
an unfamiliar location, but that fear in the presence of an unfamiliar person was not counteracted by the diet.

and lack of control that might be expressed as hyper-
vigilance, restlessness, escape or avoidance, circling,
yawning, lip licking and distress vocalization.1,2,4
Pharmacological therapy, in combination with envi-
ronmental and behavioral modification, is often indi-
cated to deal with the problem and address the wellbeing
of the pet. To date, however, no pharmacologic thera-
peutics have been approved for the treatment of fear and
anxiety in cats. While a variety of natural products claim
to be effective in reducing anxiety, these claims have not
been comprehensively assessed.
Royal Canin Feline Calm is an alpha(a)-casozepine
and L-tryptophan supplemented balanced diet. Both
nutrients have been reported to have anxiolytic effects.7­9
Tryptophan is an essential amino acid and the metabolic
precursor to melatonin and serotonin (5HT) that has been
implicated in the regulation of many behavioral pro-
cesses, such as mood, aggression and susceptibility to
stress.10­13 L-tryptophan has been evaluated in the treat-
ment of behavior disorders in cats including signs of
repetitive behavior, vocalization and agonistic behaviors.8
However, supplementation with L-tryptophan alone may
not be effective, because of limitations in its ability to pass
through the blood­brain barrier as it competes with other
large neutral amino acids for a common transporter.
Therefore a lowered level of large neutral amino acids in
relationship to tryptophan may increase tryptophan avail-
ability, leading to increased 5HT synthesis in the brain.13
a-casozepine is a bioactive peptide originating from a
S1 casein, a protein in cow's milk, which has an affinity
for gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptors in the
brain. It is reported to have an anxiolytic effect similar to
benzodiazepines, with none of the side effects such as
incoordination and disinhibition of aggression.9,14,15
Beata et al reported that fear of strangers, contact with
familiars, general fears, fear-related aggressions and
autonomic disorders were all significantly improved.9 In
a recent study, the `Calm' diet was found to reduce uri-
nary cortisol and increase the plasma tryptophan/large
neutral amino acid ratio; however, no behavioral changes
were observed. In that study, all enrolled cats were per-
ceived to be normal, which limited the possibility of
observing a reduction in stress.16
The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the
effectiveness of the Royal Canin Feline Calm diet (test
diet) in reducing fear and anxiety in cats in an open-field
test (OFT) and a human interaction test (HIT). We have
previously demonstrated that cats that exhibit fear of
people show greater inactivity in an OFT than non-
fearful cats, and that inactivity in cats with mild fear of
people is intermediate.6 In the HIT, non-fearful cats had
significantly shorter and more frequent bouts of inactiv-
ity than either mildly fearful or highly fearful cats.
Treatment with diazepam caused a reduction in inactiv-
ity in both the OFT and HIT.6 Therefore, in this study we
selected cats that had been categorized as either fearful
or mildly fearful.
Materials and methods
Experimental design
A parallel group design was used to evaluate the anxio-
lytic effectiveness of the test diet. At baseline, physical
examination, complete blood count, biochemical profile
and urinalysis were all within normal limits. Cats were
fed twice daily in separate feeding cages. Each cat was
given a measured amount of the prescribed food calcu-
lated for its optimum weight. All cats were initially
placed on the control diet (Purina Cat Chow) for 2 weeks
of adaptation, after which they were tested in the home
room, OFT and HIT over three consecutive days. These
baseline data were used to place subjects into two groups
that showed equivalent fear and anxiety. One group was
then switched to test diet and the other maintained on
control diet for the following 4 weeks. Subjects were
retested on the three tasks after 2 and 4 weeks.
All procedures were approved by the animal use and
care committee and were conducted in accordance with
the guidelines set forth by the Canadian Council on
Animal Care. The facility is a licensed animal research
facility under the Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Farms
and Rural Affairs.
Subjects
The subjects were 24 domestic shorthair cats (five males;
19 females) from the Vivocore colony, ranging in age
from 4­12 years. Cats were selected from the population
of fearful and mildly fearful cats as described in our ini-
tial study6 (Table 1).
Test protocols
Three different test protocols were conducted to assess
measures of fear and anxiety. The first involved charac-
terizing the cat's response to an unfamiliar person enter-
ing their home room (home room test).6 The second
(OFT) examined the cat's response to placement in an
empty test room. The final protocol examined the cat's
response to placement in the test room with an unfamil-
iar person (HIT). Both the OFT and HIT have been previ-
ously described.6
Home room test
All cats had been categorized using a home room test as
described in our model development study.6 Home room
assessment was performed by the first author (GL), a vet-
erinary behaviorist with whom the cats had minimal
familiarity. Briefly, the cats classified as fearful had been
obtained approximately 6 months earlier from a research
facility in which they had been identified as fearful. These
cats were housed together and continued to actively
avoid their caregivers. In the home room test, they
596 Journal of Feline Medicine and Surgery 19(6)
actively avoided and displayed threats if approached.
The other cats were intermixed in various housing rooms.
The cats were assessed as non-fearful if they would vol-
untarily approach or did not withdraw when approached
and would solicit or accept physical contact (touch,
stroke) without signs of fear or avoidance. Those cats that
would allow approach but would withdraw when con-
tact was attempted were considered mildly fearful, and
those cats that actively avoided approach or displayed
signs of threats or aggression were considered fearful.
Non-fearful cats were excluded from the study.
Open-field test
The OFT was conducted over 10 mins in a dedicated room
(2.74 m × 3.66 m and 2.98 m in height) that included three
cameras for recording movement, with one of the cameras
set up to also record audio. The behavioral measures were
recorded with the use of a behavioral tracking system,
EthoVision XT (Noldus). Behavioral measures included:
distance traveled; duration and frequency of inactivity,
defined as when an animal was sitting or lying down or not
exhibiting any overt behavior; and vocalization frequency.
Human interaction test
In the HIT, a person unfamiliar to the cat was seated on
the floor in the center of the room before entry of the cat.
For each test a different person was used but the same
person was used for all cats at each test. The person was
instructed not to wear any perfume or cologne. During
the test the person was instructed not to move, look
directly at the animals or make any attempt to elicit
attention. The human interaction was conducted over
10 mins and we recorded the same behavioral measures
that were assessed in the OFT. In addition, we quantified
frequency and time spent in proximity to the person
(within 0.5 m) and in contact with the person.
Statistical analyses
All statistical analyses were conducted using Statistica
version 11.0 software package with significance set to
P <0.05. Analysis of data obtained during the treatment
phase for each measure for measures that were common
to both the OFT and HIT was based on a repeated meas-
ures analysis of variance (RMANOVA) with time of test
(baseline, test 1 and test 2) and task (open field and
human interaction) as within-subject variables and both
group (control, treatment) and level of fear (mildly fear-
ful, fearful) as the between-subject variables. For all
analyses in which the tasks were compared, task (open
field vs human interaction) was added as a second
within-subject variable. For the home room test data,
task was not included as a main effect in the RMANOVA.

Post-hoc analyses were carried out using Fisher's least
significant difference test. For the HIT the Mann­
Whitney U-test was used for group comparisons due to
the skewed nature of score distributions which violated
the assumptions necessary for use of parametric statis-
tics. As guidelines for statistical interpretation, we used
the 0.05 level of significance to evaluate whether or not
we could reject the null hypothesis. In cases where the
level of significance was >0.05 and <0.10, we a priori
characterized the result as marginally not significant,
which justified further examination.
Results
Home room test
The group means for the home room test are summa-
rized in Table 2. The home room scores for each group
were compared using an RMANOVA with time of test
(baseline, 2 weeks and 4 weeks) as a within-subject
variable and group as the between-subject variable.
There were no differences between groups, but there
was a change with time of test [F(2,44) = 6.186705,
P <0.005]. A post-hoc Fisher's test revealed that home
room scores for both test 1 (M = 2.6042; SEM = 0.2369;
P <0.005) and test 2 (M = 2.6875; SEM = 0.2655;
P <0.01) were significantly lower than baseline
(M = 3.2917; SEM = 0.279).
Behavioral measures of anxiety
Table 3 summarizes the grouped data for the OFT.
Distance traveled
The RMANOVA revealed a statistically significant main
effect of level of fear (F[1,21] = 10.5974, P <0.005,
which reflected less activity in the fearful animals
[M = 6.809, SEM = 5.623] than in the mildly fearful
[M = 29.229; SEM = 3.98]). The analysis also revealed a
marginally not significant treatment by task by group
effect (F[2,42] = 2.737, P <0.08). To explore this further,
we next looked at each group separately for both the
OFT and HIT, using an RMANOVA on distance traveled,
with time of test as a within-subject variable.
For the OFT (Table 3, raw data for which can be found
in the supplementary material), the analysis for the con-
trol group revealed a significant effect of treatment day
(F[2,22] = 3.504; P <0.05). For the treatment group, by
contrast, the effect was non-significant (P >0.1). We then
used the Dunnett test to compare baseline with test
sessions for both the control and treatment group. The
analysis revealed a statistically significant decrease
between baseline and test 1 (P = 0.05) and a marginally
not significant decrease between baseline and test 2
(P <0.09) for the animals on the control diet, and a non-
significant increase for the animals on the test diet. Figure 1
shows that these results reflect reduced activity with
repeated testing in control group, but not in the group with
the test diet. In the HIT there were no significant changes.
Inactivity duration
There were two significant effects. The first was a signifi-
cant main effect of level of fear (F[1,21] = 8.325143,
P <0.01) and the second was a significant three-way
interaction between time of test, task and group
(F[2,42] = 5.349922, P <0.01). The level of fear effect was
due to a significantly (P <0.01) lower overall inactivity

duration in the mildly fearful animals (M = 474.11, SEM
= 16.06) than in the fearful animals (M = 554.36, SEM
= 22.707). The origins of the three-way interaction were
due to open-field inactivity decreasing on the first test
session in the test diet group, but increasing in the con-
trol group. In the HIT, inactivity went down in both
groups on test session 1.
To further analyze the data we then looked at the OFT
separately using an RMANOVA comparing the groups
at each of the three time points. There was a significant
level of fear effect (F[1,21] = 9.486518, P <0.05) and a
significant time of test by group interaction (F[2,42] =
4.28005, P <0.05). For the fear effect, a post-hoc Dunnett
test revealed that the anxiety effect in the open field was
due to fearful cats having a greater inactivity duration
compared with mildly fearful (P <0.05).
To assess the origins of the interaction we first looked
at the Tukey HSD test and compared each score with
every other score. None of the differences achieved sta-
tistical significance. In order to assess potential trends,
we then examined the data using the Fisher multiple
comparison test. This revealed statistically significant
increases in inactivity duration between baseline and
test 1 for the control animals (P <0.05). By contrast, the
test diet group showed a marginally not significant
decrease between baseline and test 1 (P <0.07). For test 2
there was a significant increase from baseline in
inactivity in the control group (P <0.05) while the test
diet group maintained a non-significant decrease in
inactivity (Figure 2).
Inactivity frequency
The results of the analysis of inactivity frequency revealed
a statistically significant effect of level of fear (F[1, 21] =
6.812399, P <0.05) and a statistically significant three-way
interaction between time of test, task and group (F[2,42] =
3.859167, P <0.05). To determine the origins of the interac-
tion we compared inactivity frequencies separately in the
OFT and HIT using an RMANOVA. The results of the
ANOVA in the OFT demonstrated a significant effect of
level of fear (F[1,21] = 7.899711, P <0.05) and a significant
interaction between time of test and group (F[2,42] =
5.053722, P <0.05). The post-hoc Dunnett test revealed
that the anxiety effect in the open field was due to mildly
fearful cats having a greater inactivity frequency com-
pared with fearful cats (P <0.05). For post-hoc analysis of
group effects, we first compared means for each of the
groups at each time point using the Tukey HSD test,
which did not reveal any statistically significant differ-
ences. Next, to determine whether there were any clear
trends we used the Fisher LSD test; the group effect due to
an increase in inactivity frequency between baseline and
test 1 for the test diet group was P <0.05 and was non-
significant for test 2, while the control group showed a
marginally not significant decrease at test 1 P <0.08 and
non-significant decrease at test 2 (Figure 3). For the HIT,
there were no significant differences.
Vocalization frequency
The results revealed a significant main effect of task
(F[1,21] = 11.25315, P <0.005]) and no other significant

main effects or interactions. Figure 4 shows that the task
effect reflected greater vocalization in the OFT than in
the HIT, which is consistent with the findings in our
model development study.6

Additional measures for the human interaction test
For each of the HIT sessions, there were four measures
related to frequency and duration of approach and con-
tact. For each of the measures, the data were negatively
skewed because a large percentage of animals in both
groups showed no contact and no approach (4/12 con-
trol and 6/12 treatment) (Table 4). Since the score distri-
butions violated the assumptions necessary for use of
parametric statistics, the group comparisons were made
with the Mann­Whitney U-Test, which did not reveal
any statistically significant effects (0.40 P 0.887).
Discussion
The purpose of this study was to compare the effective-
ness of a diet supplemented with L-tryptophan and
-casozepine (Royal Canin Feline Calm diet) with a
control diet in reducing fear and anxiety in cats that
showed fearfulness to people.6 We looked at three
different test protocols: (1) response to an unfamiliar
environment (OFT); (2) response to an unfamiliar person
(HIT); and (3) assessment of fear in the home room
(home room test).
Behavioral measures of fear and anxiety were based
on activity, inactivity and vocalization, which were
quantified using a behavioral tracking system. In the
HIT, we also monitored time spent close to and in con-
tact with the person.
For the inactivity measures in the OFT, the group on
the control diet showed increases in inactivity compared
with baseline while the group on the test diet showed
decreases, which resulted in significant interactions
between group and time of test. Although the paired
comparisons using the more conservative Tukey HSD
test did not reveal statistically significant differences
from baseline, the Fisher multiple comparison test found
a statistically significant increase over baseline on both
the first and second treatment test in the control group.
By contrast, the group fed the test diet showed a margin-
ally not significant decrease between baseline and the
first OFT and a non-significant decrease in test 2.
Similarly, for distance traveled there was a significant
decrease in distance traveled at test 1 in the control group
and a non-significant increase in the test diet group.
The other measure that showed sensitivity to the test
diet in the OFT was inactivity frequency. This is a meas-
ure of the number of times that an animal stops moving
and then restarts; the results parallel the inactivity dura-
tion data, with the test diet group showing a significant
increase in inactivity frequency over baseline at test 1
and the control group a marginally not significant
decrease.
Given the link between inactivity in an unfamiliar
environment and anxiety, these results provide potential
evidence of the anxiolytic effectiveness of the test diet.
These findings are consistent with the effects seen with
diazepam treatment in our previous study, in which
inactivity duration was significantly decreased and inac-
tivity frequency increased6 (Figure 5).
There were no significant effects of diet in the HIT.
Given the results from the OFT, this absence of signifi-
cant effects in the HIT may reflect a selective benefit of
the test diet in reducing anxiety, but not fear. Similarly,
Figure 4 Vocalization frequency in open-field and human interaction tests. Vocalization frequency was significantly greater
(P <0.005) in the open-field test than the human interaction test
Landsberg et al 601
we have previously shown that in the HIT, the anxiolytic
drug diazepam did not promote approach to humans in
fearful cats.6
The decline in vocalization frequency from the OFT to
the HIT in both groups is consistent with our previous
study, in which much higher levels of vocalization were
seen in the OFT than the HIT. One possible interpreta-
tion is that the presence of the person increased fear,
which reduced vocalization.6
We also found differences in fear level with mildly
fearful cats when compared with fearful cats, showing a
decrease in distance traveled and inactivity duration,
and greater inactivity frequency. This result replicates
our previous observation in which fearful cats were
more inactive than non-fearful cats, with mildly fearful
cats intermediate.6
We interpret these results to indicate that the effec-
tiveness of the test diet in reducing overall anxiety is
probably limited to moderate anxiety-provoking situa-
tions. The absence of an effect on the fear response in
the presence of an unfamiliar person may indicate a
dissociation between reducing anxiety associated with
an unfamiliar location but not in reducing the fear
toward an animate stimulus. Another possibility is that
the cats used in this study, which were pre-selected
based on a fearful response to people, may have been
too fearful for the diet to effect any improvement.
Similarly, in our previous study fearful cats given diaz-
epam spent the greatest time away from an unfamiliar
person. Therefore a future study might be designed
to evaluate a greater number of cats using cats that
are minimally fearful or non-fearful in the home room

assessment. In addition, as a previous study with
a-casozepine found that some cats improved in the sec-
ond month of treatment, further studies might consider
a longer course of therapy.8
As the test diet is supplemented with both a-casozepine
and L-tryptophan, the present results do not distinguish
whether the beneficial effects are a result of either of
these alone, or the two in combination.
Conclusions
These results are suggestive of an anxiolytic effect of the
Royal Canin Feline Calm diet to placement in an unfa-
miliar location based on a reduction in inactivity dura-
tion and increased inactivity frequency in the Calm diet
compared with an increase in inactivity duration and
decreased inactivity frequency in the control diet. Future
studies of longer duration might further confirm the
effect of the diet on fear and anxiety.
