Introduction
Welcome to the age of big data, a revolutionary era where
technology has transformed how businesses make decisions.
According to a report by the McKinsey Global Institute, a
trusted advisor for many influential businesses, "decision
making will never be the same; some organizations are
already making better decisions by analyzing entire data sets
from customers, employees, or even sensors embedded in
products" (Manyika et al., 2011, p. 5). In addition to intuition
and judgment, businesses now use various software to draw
conclusions from data sets and to thereby make decisions.
Surprisingly, schools do not teach students the same soft-
ware that businesses look for. In his article that measures the
popularity of many data analysis software, Robert Muenchen
notes that discovering the software skills that employers are
seeking would "require a time consuming content analysis of
job descriptions" (Muenchen, 2014). However, he finds
other ways to figure out the statistical software skills that
employers seek. One of these methods is to examine which
software they currently use. Muenchen includes a survey
conducted by Rexer Analytics, a data mining consulting
firm, about the relative popularity of various data analysis
software in 2010. The results of the survey are pictured in
Figure 1. As seen, data miners use R, SAS, and SPSS the
most. Because 47%, 32%, and 32% of respondents use R,
SAS, and SPSS, respectively, it can be inferred that these are
the software skills that the greatest proportion of employers
will continue to look for. However, this method only exam-
ines the software that employers might seek if they are hir-
ing, so it does not accurately measure the software that they
currently look for. Muenchen's other method does this,
studying software skills that employers currently seek as
they try to fill open positions. In this approach, Muenchen
puts together a rough sketch of statistical software capabili-
ties sought by employers by perusing the job advertising site,
Indeed.com, a search site the comprises the major job
boards--Monster, Careerbuilder, Hotjobs, Craigslist--as
well as many newspapers, associations, and company web-
sites (Muenchen, 2014). He summarized his discovery in
Figure 2.
As seen--in contrast to R's greater usage by companies
over SAS, illustrated in Figure 1--job openings in SAS sub-
stantially lead open positions that require any other data
analysis software. For employers, SPSS and R skills finish in
second and third place. This second estimation method of
Muenchen measures the software skill deficits in the job
market. It seems that the demand for people with SAS skills
outweighs the number of individuals with this capability.
One reason for this disconnect could be that colleges and
universities are not teaching SAS skills in proportion to the
demand for these skills.
The convenience sample is collected based on school's
answering our questionnaire. There was no other way to
collect the data. We had to rely on the questionnaire that we

Selection of Statistical Software for
Solving Big Data Problems: A Guide for
Businesses, Students, and Universities

Abstract
The need for analysts with expertise in big data software is becoming more apparent in today's society. Unfortunately,
the demand for these analysts far exceeds the number available. A potential way to combat this shortage is to identify the
software taught in colleges or universities. This article will examine four data analysis software--Excel add-ins, SPSS, SAS, and
R--and we will outline the cost, training, and statistical methods/tests/uses for each of these software. It will further explain
implications for universities and future students.

sent to establish this connect between software used and soft-
ware sought. To assess this potential disconnect, we surveyed
18 departments--small and large, state and private, under-
graduate and graduate, East and West--and, as expected, we
discovered a discrepancy between the software taught and
the software sought. The survey results are outlined in Table
1. The responses indicate that although SAS boasts a com-
manding lead in job openings, data analysis software taught
at universities does not reflect this dominance. Only a few
more departments teach SAS than R or SPSS. Some depart-
ments do not teach any software at all! Although this survey
has a small sample size, the results do roughly sketch a trend
seen in quantitative, engineering, and business departments
across the country. College and university departments have
not aligned their use of statistical packages to the skills
demanded by employers. In many departments, SAS and

SPSS training are offered as noncredit generating instruc-
tions and also as part of mentoring. The skills required to
teach Excel and SAS are very different. The departments
need to invest in teachers who are capable of teaching these
specialized courses using Excel, SAS, SPSS, and R.
The use of Excel as a software is very different than use
of SAS or SPSS, but the cost and training is significantly
higher for SPSS or SAS. We can use Excel add-ins to deal
with the deficiency in software. We cannot solve as big of
problems with Excel as with SAS or SPSS. However, Excel
can still be useful software, especially with add-ins for
small businesses.
Paying attention only to job availability, it seems that
many schools need to reconsider their software choice in
favor of implementing SAS. Nevertheless, there are many
factors to consider other than the popularity within the job
market. Schools must also consider the cost and time effec-
tiveness of incorporating each software into their curriculum.
Furthermore, specific departments within the school should
consider which software best fits their area of study. One aim
of this article is to provide this necessary information by out-
lining the cost, training requirement, statistical techniques,
and specific uses within industry of leading data analysis
software.

This article will not only assist schools in this software
choice, but it will also help businesses decide which software
is best to bring them to the next level of capability as big data
analysis has become less of a privilege and more of a neces-
sity. As Manyika et al. (2011) state,
The impact of developing a superior capacity to take advantage
of big data will confer enhanced competitive advantage over the
long term and is therefore well worth the investment to create
this capability. But the converse is also true. In a big data world,
a competitor that fails to sufficiently develop its capabilities will
be left behind. (p. 5)
In other words, big data can no longer be ignored because
companies that take advantage of it are winning the race
against their less-modern competitors. More companies must
consider implementing this type of analysis to stay competi-
tive, and in doing so, they will need to understand which
software is most appropriate for their business. This article
will help gather and condense the necessary information for
this type of decision. For those progressive companies that
already utilize software to realize their goals, they can recon-
sider their current software choice in light of this comprehen-
sive information.
Medical research is often weakened by poor statistical
practice, and inappropriate use of statistical computer soft-
ware is part of this problem. The statistical knowledge that
medical researchers require has traditionally been gained in
both dedicated and ad hoc learning time, often separate from
the research processes in which the statistical methods are
applied. Computer software, however, can be written to flex-
ibly support statistical practice (Buchan, 2000).
All in all, this article will focus on SAS, SPSS, and R
software because both methods in Muenchen's study indi-
cate that they are the three most competitively sought soft-
ware in industry. The article includes a complete collection
of the cost-effectiveness, training, uses, and specific uses
within industry of each of these software. It will begin,
though, with an investigation of Excel and its add-ins because
of their cost-effectiveness, utility, and availability.
Excel Add-Ins
What Are Excel Add-Ins?
Add-ins are programs that add optional features and com-
mands to the traditional capabilities of Microsoft Excel.
Excel has created add-ins for a multitude of purposes: data
analysis, presentation, investment, business, personal, utili-
ties and productivity tools, and organization. Within data
analysis, some of the most popular add-ins include the
Analysis Toolpak, Solver, and MegaStat. While the Analysis
Toolpak and Solver are free add-ins, MegaStat is not. This
section will focus on MegaStat and its usefulness in
industry.
Cost
MegaStat costs US$13.50, and prospective users can pur-
chase it on McGraw-Hill's website.
Training
With the focus on science, technology, engineering, and
mathematics (STEM) fields in this day and age, chances are
most people who have used Microsoft Excel at some point
during their lifetime. Although they may not have used the
statistical analysis tools of Excel, they have used it to swiftly
perform calculations of data, or at least to organize data. The
creator of MegaStat, Orris Burdeane, explains, "Since
MegaStat looks and works like Excel, almost anyone could
use it to generate some output with just a few minutes of
training" (O. Burdeane, personal communication, January
29, 2014). After all, MegaStat has dialog and input boxes,
buttons, and checkboxes that work largely the same as those
in standard Excel. Therefore, the 53-page tutorial pdf--com-
plete with a step-by-step process to using each test that
MegaStat performs, and pictures at every step--will likely
provide more than enough guidance for trainees to effec-
tively use this software.
Statistical Method/Tests/Uses
As will be seen later in this article, MegaStat can execute
many of the same jobs that more costly software do.
According to the McGraw-Hill website, MegaStat can per-
form a multitude of statistical operations: descriptive statis-
tics, frequency distributions, probability, confidence intervals
and sample size, hypothesis tests, ANOVA, regression, time-
series/forecasting, chi-square, nine nonparametric tests,
quality control process charts, and generation of random
numbers ("Megastat," 2014). The creator of MegaStat him-
self acknowledges that SPSS and SAS, specifically, have
more advanced options, "especially in the area of multivari-
ate statistics" (O. Burdeane, personal communication,
January 29, 2014). However, he believes that "MegaStat can
handle most things encountered by non-PhD statisticians"
(O. Burdeane, personal communication, January 29, 2014).
The major caveat for this cheap and easy-to-use software
is its size capability. For example, Burdeane experimented
with the number of data points that MegaStat can handle a
few years ago. "I did find a file with 10 columns and 152630
rows. That is over 1 ½ million data points and MegaStat did
a descriptive statistics analysis on it in about 10 seconds" (O.
Burdeane, personal communication, January 29, 2014).
While the capability to analyze a million and a half data
points sounds like a tremendous feat, and it is, this capability
does not meet the demand of large companies like Wal-Mart
and Facebook. An article published by SAS called "Big Data
Meets Big Data Analytics" puts it plainly: "Wal-Mart han-
dles more than a million customer transactions each hour and
Ozgur et al. 5
imports those into databases estimated to contain more than
2.5 petabytes of data," and "Facebook handles more than 250
million photo uploads and the interactions of 800 million
active users with more than 900 million objects (pages,
groups, etc.) each day" (SAS, 2014b). Extracting this data
and making use of it using MegaStat is just not feasible.
Burdeane also mentioned a couple of other restrictions of
MegaStat, including its limitation to 12 independent vari-
ables in multiple regression and further restrictions on vari-
ables and table size (O. Burdeane, personal communication,
January 29, 2014). While MegaStat does have all of these
constraints, the fact remains that it is an extremely powerful
software given the cost and training required.
Specific Uses in Industry
The creator of MegaStat believes that this software is used
by a different group of people from the major statistical
packages. Burdeane (personal communication, January 29,
2014) states,
I would guess that most use of MegaStat in companies is by
people who are not professional statisticians. I think people with
formal training in statistics beyond an introductory course would
have experience with one of the big packages (SAS, SPSS,
Minitab) and would tend to stick with that software even if it
was overkill for many analyses.
He suggests that many analyses do not require major
packages, like SAS, SPSS, and R, but statisticians stick to
them because they are comfortable.
However, companies within industry do still use Excel.
For example, a global appliance manufacturer uses Excel
"for extensive `What If' analysis around budgeting" and to
forecast (J. Ward, personal communication, January 20,
2014).
SPSS
What Is SPSS?
SPSS, originally termed Statistical Package for the Social
Sciences, was released in 1968 as a software designed for the
social sciences. Since then, IBM has replaced SPSS Inc. as the
owner, and the software has expanded its user base past this one
area. The software's former acronym has been replaced with
Statistical Product and Service Solutions to reflect the greater
diversity of its clients. Arguably, it still remains the leading sta-
tistical analysis software package for the social sciences.
Cost
Obviously, consumers can buy SPSS software packages sep-
arately by choosing a particular product that they think will
satisfy their need; however, SPSS offers bundles that cost
much less than paying for the programs independently. SPSS
offers three of these bundles: standard, professional, and
premium.
Within each of these bundles, SPSS gives four options: an
authorized user license, authorized user initial fixed term
license, concurrent user license, and concurrent user initial
fixed term license. Thus, when customers decide they want
to purchase SPSS, they have to make two decisions: user
license versus initial fixed term license and authorized user
versus concurrent user. User licenses never expire, while ini-
tial fixed term licenses last for 12 months.An authorized user
is a single licensee who buys the right to use the program; a
concurrent user is the right for a single person to use the pro-
gram at a given time, but it does not distinguish who this
person has to be.
With these descriptions in mind, beneath in Table 2 are
the prices for purchasing the three different bundles of SPSS.
SPSS also offers student packages for college attendees.
Students can purchase the single user initial fixed-term
license "SPSS GradPack" software from their college or uni-
versity, or they can buy it from SPSS's official distributors,
like Creation Engine, On the Hub, StudentDiscounts.com,
Studica, and ThinkEDU (IBM, 2014b). For example, on the
Creation Engine website, students can buy the SPSS Statistics
Premium GradPack for US$98.95 ("IBM SPSS Statistics
Premium GradPack 22," 2014).

ogy, Ashley Crossman addresses the difficulty--or lack
thereof--of using SPSS for the first time. She explains,

6 SAGE Open
SPSS provides a user interface that makes it very easy and
intuitive for all levels of users. Menus and dialogue boxes make
it possible to perform analyses without having to write command
syntax, like in other programs. It is also simple and easy to enter
and edit data directly into the programs. (Crossman, 2014)
On the surface, these descriptions make SPSS sound a lot
like Excel. In fact, SPSS does look similar to typical spread-
sheet applications like Excel, and its ease of use is very com-
parable to Excel as well.
Statistical Method/Tests/Uses
There are many differences between Excel and SPSS that
suit SPSS to better handle statistical methods. For one,
"SPSS was designed specifically for statistical processing of
large amount of data at an enterprise level," while spread-
sheets are broadly applicable to many different tasks outside
of statistical computing (Robbins, 2012). An advantage of
this specialized design is that SPSS "keeps calculated statis-
tics and graphs separate from the raw data but still easily
accessible" (Robbins, 2012). SPSS software furthermore has
a much more convenient platform for performing statistical
tests. For instance, performing a one-sample t test in Excel
requires some independent calculations by the user, whereas
with SPSS, the user only needs to "select a variable and sup-
ply the value to compare with [the] sample" and click "Ok"
(Robbins, 2012). Another advantage of SPSS is that it links
numerically coded data to its original meaning (Robbins,
2012). With most data being electronically stored in numeri-
cal fashion, this feature of SPSS is highly valuable.
For these reasons, SPSS is well suited to statistical analy-
sis, but what statistical procedures can SPSS handle? SPSS's
standard bundle includes its statistics base, advanced statis-
tics, bootstrapping, custom tables, and regression capabili-
ties. Purchasing the professional bundle further supplies the
consumer with the categories, data preparation, decision
trees, forecasting, and missing values features. The most
comprehensive bundle, premium, provides the user with the
complex samples, conjoin, direct marketing, exact tests, neu-
ral networks, amos, sample power, and visualization designer,
in addition to all of the packages from the professional bun-
dle ("SPSS Statistics," 2014).
After the statistical analysis is complete, SPSS is also use-
ful for generating plots of distributions and trends, charts,
and tabulated reports.
Specific Uses in Industry
IBM's SPSS software has spanned many industries. On its
website, prospective clients can read about SPSS success
stories in fields like automotive, banking, chemical and
petroleum, computer services, consumer products, educa-
tion, electronics, energy and utilities, and on and on. They
can also access a list of SPSS's clients, such as Barclays,
Kaplan, and Wimbledon Championships. Below are a couple
more specific examples of SPSS at work within industry.
·
· Infinity insurance uses SPSS's predictive analytics
feature to detect fraudulent claims (IBM, 2014c).
·
· "By mining alumni and stakeholder records, social
media and other unstructured data-sets with text ana-
lytics software, [Michigan State University] gains
insights into the engagement, sentiments and behavior
of current and potential donors," which enables
smarter fund-raising ("Success Stories for SPSS,"
2014).
·
· The Guardia Civil, Spain's very first national law
enforcement agency, has investigated crimes and psy-
chology using SPSS ("Success Stories for SPSS,"
2014).
·
· One distinguished hospital uses SPSS to forecast pay-
ment behavior. It tries "to better identify patients who
are most likely to pay their hospital bills" by what it
calls "predict[ing] patient payment potential"
("Success Stories for SPSS," 2014).
SAS
What Is SAS?
SAS (Statistical Analysis System) is a commercial statistical
package that was developed during the 1960s and 1970s at
North Carolina State University as part of an agricultural
research project. Its usage has grown exponentially since
then. Nowadays, 91 of the top 100 companies on the 2013
Fortune Global 500 list use the software (SAS, 2014a). This
article will discuss the two main SAS starter packages:
Analytics Pro and Visual Data Discovery.
An important fact to note about SAS is that the software
does not run on Mac computers very easily (one way to run
the software is through parallels, where users buy and run the
Windows interface as well).
Cost
An individual license of the Analytics Pro version of SAS
costs US$8,700 for the first year and US$2,436 for each year
thereafter. The cost for each renewal is 28% of the amount
originally paid in the first year. With a few more features
than the Analytics Pro system, the Visual Data Discovery
package costs US$10,800 for the first year of use. Like
Analytics Pro, renewing this package costs 28% of the origi-
nal cost, so it costs US$2,822.40 for each additional year.
However, these prices only apply to customers working with
their own data. If a user wishes to perform data analysis for
the benefit of some other party, then he must secure a differ-
ent license by consulting a SAS representative (SAS, 2014d).
One of these alternative licenses is a server-based license.
These licenses certainly save schools and businesses money
Ozgur et al. 7
by allowing their affiliates each to access the software
through a web-based connection or a network. SAS fills
these requests on a case-by-case basis, so interested custom-
ers should speak to SAS directly to get a quote (SAS, 2014d).
On top of these two versions, SAS has created an
OnDemand edition, which is available at no cost to degree-
granting institutions. Professors can set up an account online,
and they and their students can access the software anywhere
with an Internet access. Although this free software "has
been reported to be slow at times," it definitely provides a
great opportunity for schools to teach students the basics of
SAS programming (Loomis Lofland & Ottesen, 2013, 3).
While the proper versions of SAS do come at a steep
financial cost, they furthermore cost time in the form of
installation. Chelsea Loomis Lofland and Rebecca Ottesen
speak to this expense in their article, "The SAS Versus R
Debate in Industry and Academia." They explain, "SAS can
be difficult for users to obtain and the initial installation is
sometimes tricky . . . long and difficult" (Loomis Lofland &
Ottesen, 2013, p. 3). However, in contrast to some other soft-
ware (like R, as will be seen later), SAS only requires this
initial installation. It does not require users to install any
packages in the future. Everything is included in this set-up.
Training
Ashley Crossman accurately advises, "SAS is a great pro-
gram for the intermediate and advanced user because it is
very powerful, can be used with extremely large data sets,
andcanperformcomplexandadvancedanalyses"(Crossman,
2014). After all, SAS requires more training than Excel and
SPSS because it largely runs on programming syntax rather
than point­click menus that other software boast.
The amount of training necessary for individuals to prop-
erly use SAS depends on many factors, including the trainee's
background and the type of analysis she will need to perform.
In terms of background, prospective SAS programmers with
prior programming experience will have a much easier time.
SAS syntax resembles that of other programming languages,
so experience with one language often helps learn another.
For instance, SAS is similar to Java in that both contain data
values, function calls, identifying key words at the beginning
ofeachline,andsemicolonsattheendofeachline(Boudreaux,
2003). But, even if the syntax of SAS and a previously learned
language are completely different, experience with coding is
extremely helpful because the art of programming is a differ-
ent kind of thinking. It is easy to migrate from one tool to the
other. The "primary" push is to get organizations to use proper
tools. The training required also depends on the type of analy-
sis that the trainee must carry out. If the trainee only needs to
run the same type of test repeatedly, then she may only need
training in a specific aspect of SAS programming; however, if
the trainee will need to develop a process based on each new
task, then she will need more sound understanding of the
software.
Fortunately, experts have written copious texts about how
to use SAS, and SAS has a strong user support system, so
even if users do not have complete understanding of the soft-
ware, they can run it. While there exists no easy way to cal-
culate the number of books written about SAS, Robert
Muenchen did as best he could to estimate these statistics by
searching for books published with "SAS" in their title. He
found that close to five hundred of these books were pub-
lished between 2001 and 2011 (Loomis Lofland & Ottesen,
2013). In addition to all these useful texts, experts really can-
not pinpoint any issues with the user support of SAS. Loomis
Lofland and Ottesen clarify,
SAS has extensive online documentation, expert technical
support, professional training courses, many excellent books in
press, and a tight-knit user group and web-based community.
Problems can be addressed to SAS directly via tech support who
replies very quickly and will work with the user to solve the
problem. (Muenchen, 2014)
They designate the user support service of SAS as one of
its main specialties. Therefore, even though SAS requires
some programming skills, the strength of SAS's support sys-
tem makes it more manageable for less advanced users.
Statistical Method/Tests/Uses
SAS's Analytics Pro bundle comes with three of the most
popular SAS products: Base SAS, SAS/STAT, and SAS/
GRAPH. The corporation's Visual Data Discovery collection
includes SAS Enterprise Guide (SAS's only point­click
interface) and JMP software to make discovery and explor-
atory analysis easier.
With either of these toolsets, programmers can perform a
number of statistical tests. The Institute for Digital Research
and Education website outlines a multitude of statistical tests
and their corresponding SAS codes. The list includes 32 tests
that come from statistical categories such as regression, fac-
tor analysis, discriminant analysis, ANOVA, nonparametric
tests, and correlation (UCLA: Statistical consulting group,
2014). The full list can be seen in Table 3.
SAS can perform many more statistical tests than just
these, though. It also functions well with forecasting, time-
series analysis, and many other advanced statistical tech-
niques. In fact, SAS has created specialized programs for
these methods. The SAS website's "Products & Solutions"
page has a complete list of these programs.
Also on this page, SAS has additional packages to access
that are industry-specific. For example, there is a "SAS Drug
Development" package that "enables the efficient develop-
ment, execution, and management of analysis and reporting
activities for clinical research"; a "SAS Fraud Management"
package that "delivers a full-service enterprise-wide fraud
management system that offers real-time scoring of accounts
by looking at all card transactions--including purchases,
8 SAGE Open
payments and nonmonetary transactions"; and a "SAS Risk
Management for Insurance" package that "implements the
Solvency II standard model approach for calculating risk-based
capital with [its] comprehensive solution for preforming risk
analysis and risk-based capital calculations" (SAS, 2014c). On
top of these specialized packages for health care, banking, and
insurance, SAS has formulated software with built-in functions
for other areas like law enforcement, communications, retail,
casinos, utilities, and sports, among others.
SAS's advantageous functions extend beyond just carry-
ing out statistics, though. It has superior qualities for both
before the statistical analysis and after. Prior to the actual
statistics, it facilitates the reading in and managing disorga-
nized data. Real-life data are rarely clean and analysis ready.
SAS can interpret messy data sets, convert them to a clean
form, and manipulate them in ways that other software can-
not (Loomis Lofland & Ottesen, 2013). After the user per-
forms the statistics, SAS has impressive graphics and report
writing features that will help disseminate the findings in
clear and appealing ways. But, these aesthetic products come
with a caveat according to Loomis Lofland and Ottesen.
They explain, "SAS provides many useful procedures for
creating detailed and polished reports"; however, "some of
the more detailed reporting procedures . . . have a learning
curve that takes place before being able to use them cor-
rectly" (Loomis Lofland & Ottesen, 2013, pp. 3-4).
Specific Uses in Industry
As stated in the previous section, SAS has built-in, func-
tional packages for many specific industries, including health
care, banking, insurance, law enforcement, communications,
retail, casinos, utilities, sports, and more. Below are a couple
of real-life uses of SAS within some of these industries.
·
· A leading medical device company utilizes SAS "for
clinical study data analysis" (K. Kleckner, personal
communication, February 1, 2014). This same company
furthermore uses the software "for setting sample sizes
for pre-clinical studies and human clinical studies; [and]
for setting controls on manufacturing operations" (K.
Kleckner, personal communication, February 1, 2014).
·
· A global appliance manufacturer uses SAS for quality
control by performing predictive analyses of product
defects (J. Ward, personal communication, January
20, 2014).
R
What Is R?
R is a free, open-source statistical software. Colleagues at the
University of Auckland in New Zealand, Robert Gentleman
and Ross Ihaka, created the software in 1993 because they
mutually saw a need for a better software environment for
their classes. R has certainly outgrown its origins, now boast-
ing more than 2 million users according to an R Community
website (Revolution Analytics, 2014).
Cost
R is free and is downloadable from the Internet. To repeat, it
has no subscription fees, user limits, or license managers.
However, this presents a danger. As open-source software, R
could be a security concern for large companies because the
software can be freely used, changed, and shared by
anyone.
Like SAS, R can be expensive in a form other than mon-
etary. While the base for R is very easy to install, users must
download packages to perform specific analyses, which can
be very time-consuming (Loomis Lofland & Ottesen, 2013).
For example, as of this article, there are 5,508 available
packages, and this number grows weekly if not daily
(Comprehensive R Archive Network, 2014). This provides
many options, but searching through the assemblage of
choices can be difficult and time-consuming. One of the
strengths of R is its ability to find packages that have very
specific solutions or we may generate solutions.
Training
Again, like SAS, the training necessary for effectively using
R depends on the previous computing experience of the
trainee. Computing experience is helpful because data analy-
sis in R requires writing functions and scripts, not just

pointing and clicking like in Excel or SPSS. In many ways,
though, R is comparable with other programming languages.
For instance, similar to many other languages, it is a com-
mand line interface. In addition, its source code is similar to
that of C and Fortran, and it supports matrix arithmetic and
data structures like APL and MATLAB. Having used any of
these in the past could lessen the training time necessary to
learn R. As stated with SAS above, though, having any pro-
gramming experience at all often will speed up the learning
process for trainees as programming problems are a com-
pletely different type of puzzle.
Sources report varied answers when identifying the train-
ing necessary to successfully utilize R. Some believe that R
does not necessitate much knowledge of computer program-
ming after all. For example, Daryl Pregibon of Google testi-
fies that R "allows statisticians to do very intricate and
complicated analyses without knowing the blood and guts of
computing systems." He is saying that packages abstract the
programmer from the implementation of specific tools (deci-
sion trees/forests, etc.). Ashlee Vance of The New York Times
informs, "R has quickly found a following because statisti-
cians, engineers and scientists without computer program-
ming skills find it easy to use" (Vance, 2009). R is, after all,
not as daunting as other languages, having very natural and
expressive syntax for data analysis. The syntax is not very
common to traditional programmers. Some programmers
may even label its syntax as quirky. In R language,
"anova(object_1, object_2)" produces an ANOVA table,
"coef(object)" extracts the regression coefficient, and
"plot(object)" produces plots showing residuals, fitted val-
ues, and other diagnostics ("An Introduction to R," 2014).
Still, R does require the use of objects, operators, and func-
tions before applying these intuitive commands.
Fortunately--as stated earlier--many packages are available
for download and use off the Internet, so users do not neces-
sarily have to know the code or write it. This is another rea-
son why some people say that R does not require much
programming knowledge.
However, because of errors in some of these packages and
lack of user support for R, others believe that advanced train-
ing investment is necessary to use the software. Two people
who hold this viewpoint are Loomis Lofland and Ottesen,
who say,
[R] users rely on what others put out there about the software. . . .
Packages are not written by the R Development Core-Team;
therefore, they are not well polished and some could have
questionable validity. It is also difficult to direct an issue to a
particular person or support system. (Loomis Lofland & Ottesen,
2013, p. 3)
Although R may be usable without much coding experi-
ence, when a problem arises, the lack of programming
knowledge will become evident and costly due to a dearth of
documentation and technical support for resolving the issue.
In other words, people without sufficient knowledge of the R
programming language can implement the syntax in their
own use, but they do not necessarily have solid understand-
ing of what the code actually says. This lack of R coding
knowledge makes debugging difficult if not impossible, and
it could lead to erroneous results with severe decision-making
consequences.
Loomis Lofland and Ottesen also explain that report writ-
ing in R is difficult. They claim that the extensive program-
ming required to code a report in R is quite a time investment,
as "R does not have a defined way of producing reports"
(Loomis Lofland & Ottesen, 2013, p. 3).
Statistical Method/Tests/Uses
R is a comprehensive statistical analysis toolkit. It can per-
form any statistical analysis desired, but users must either
write the code or access the code from someone who has
already written it. As stated on its website, people have
already designed many standard data analysis tools "from
accessing data in various formats, to data manipulation
(transforms, merges, aggregations, etc.), to traditional and
modern statistical models (regression, ANOVA, GLM, tree
models, etc.; "Why Use R?" 2014)". Actually, programmers
have designed many more packages than just these. As stated
earlier in this section, programmers have already coded
5,508 packages. These include packages for Bayesian statis-
tics, time-series analysis, simulation-based analysis, spatial
statistics, survival analysis, and many, many more
(Comprehensive R Archive Network, 2014). For a complete
list of packages already designed for R, visit http://cran.us.r-
project.org/web/packages/.
The key feature of R that differentiates it from other sta-
tistical softwares is its acceptance of customization. On one
hand, the aforementioned software have "data-in-data-out
black-box procedures" ("Why Use R?" 2014). In other
words, the developers have written the code for a certain
function, such as performing decomposition for a time-series
model, and users have never seen this built-in code that runs
in the background. All they need to do is use a "decomp"
command, or something of the sort, and the statistical pack-
age will perform the decomposition for them. However, R is
an interactive language. It requires users to write the code
(for the decomposition, or whatever procedure desired) or to
paste the code in from someone who already wrote it.
Because the function's code is visible in their command box,
users can manipulate the commands however they see fit.
Thus, R enables experimentation and exploration by allow-
ing users to improve the software's code or to write varia-
tions for specific tasks. They can even mix-and-match
models for better results. With the prepackaged functions in
the other statistical software, this is not as easy.
After completing a statistical analysis with R, the soft-
ware is known for generating appealing charts and tables.
The custom charting capabilities of R create "stunning
10 SAGE Open
infographics seen in The New York Times, The Economist,
and the FlowingData blog" (Revolution Analytics, 2014).
With R, though, it is important to acknowledge that it can-
not manage messy data as easily as other available statistical
software. Loomis Lofland and Ottesen warn,
The design of R was focused around statistical computing and
graphics, so data management tends to be time consuming and
not as clean as SAS. . . . Students who have used solely R have
an unrealistic expectation of the state of the data they receive.
(Loomis Lofland & Ottesen, 2013, p. 3)
But, once the data is organized, as stated, R is an invalu-
able data analysis performer and graphics creator.
Specific Uses in Industry
The usage of R across diverse domains is undeniable. A New
York Times article cites its practice in major companies, like
Google, Pfizer, Merck, Bank ofAmerica, the InterContinental
hotels Group, and Shell (Vance, 2009). For specific exam-
ples, see below.
·
· Google "taps R for help understanding trends in ad
pricing and for illuminating patterns in the search data
it collects" (Vance, 2009).
·
· Pfizer has engineered its own custom packages in R,
which allows scientists to manipulate their own data
during nonclinical drug studies instead of hiring a
statistician to do the work for them (Vance, 2009).
·
· A financial services company utilizes dozens of R
packages to perform derivatives analysis (Vance,
2009).
Conclusion
Excel add-ins are well suited to small companies and small
projects because of their availability and low cost, while
SPSS, SAS, and R work well for large projects and large
businesses because of their ability to handle large sums of
data efficiently. As discovered at the beginning of the article,
Excel's MegaStat option can execute many important statis-
tical procedures that people trying to interpret smaller data
sets can utilize for low financial cost and training cost.
However, as stated, MegaStat can only manage a certain
amount of data. Therefore, larger data sets, such as those
accumulated by Wal-Mart and Facebook, require a higher
powered software, like SPSS, SAS, or R. Differentiating
between which of these software best fits the analysis of
these larger data sets depends on a number of factors, and
each statistical package has its own strengths and weak-
nesses. Hence, this article has investigated the cost, installa-
tion procedure, training necessary, built-in packages, level of
desire to manipulate code, user support, importance of
appealing graphics, and many other considerations in hopes
of providing businesses and universities with details that can
ease their choices of software.
Implications
With the tremendous (and growing) focus on big data in
today's society, businesses, universities, and future students
should actively participate. Big data are a mixture of struc-
tured and unstructured data and not just number of records.
Big data capabilities go beyond the maximum number of
rows and columns a software can handle. Big data consist of
both structured and unstructured data; the McKinsey Global
Corporation explains why. It states,
The use of big data will become a key basis of competition and
growth for individual firms. . . . From the standpoint of
competitiveness and the potential capture of value, all companies
need to take big data seriously. In most industries, established
competitors and new entrants alike will leverage data-driven
strategies to innovate, compete, and capture value from deep
and up-to-real-time information. Indeed, we found early
examples of such use of data in every sector we examined.
(Manyika et al., 2011, p. 6)
Noncredit courses taught at Universities should also be
included in the discussion of teaching these software, such as
SPSS, SAS, and R. To repeat, businesses are leveraging big
data in every sector that McKinsey examined. Hence, busi-
nesses need to take notice. McKinsey further explains,
There will be a shortage of talent necessary for organizations to
take advantage of big data. [By 2018,] we project that demand
for deep analytical positions in a big data world could exceed the
supply being produced on current trends by 140,000 to 190,000
positions. (Manyika et al., 2011, p. 6)
In other words, McKinsey estimates that by 2018, the
United States will lack at least 140,000 people with expertise
in big data. Big data analysis does not occur by hand, so
McKinsey essentially predicts that the United States could
need this many more people with expertise in software that
can handle big data. For this reason, colleges, universities,
and future students should assume the preparatory measures
necessary to combat this deficit. After all, future students
with training from college and universities will need to fill
these gaps.
This article aimed to help businesses, schools, and stu-
dents recognize what they can do to improve their perfor-
mance and utility in this data-driven society. To begin, from
this article, businesses can learn the most effective tools to
suit their context. New businesses can learn the tools that
they should buy (or simply download), while older busi-
nesses can learn the software that could better serve their
needs than the one they currently have. Finding the suitable
software is important because companies that employ the
most efficient data analysis software will compete better
Ozgur et al. 11
against competition, by effectively accessing and using their
stockpiles of data to make better decisions.
Colleges and universities could improve job placement by
preparing students in the specific software that hiring com-
panies use. As seen in the introduction, the majority of com-
panies use the software reported in this article. Therefore,
schools would benefit from teaching students to use these
software.
Students can add a "software taught" category to their list
of traits sought in higher education to prepare themselves for
job placement. One of the most important decisions that
future students make is selecting a major. Often, a student's
desired major can influence the selection set. However, other
decisions are growing in importance too. In terms of finding
a job, employers are increasingly seeking out recent gradu-
ates who have experience with big data software, like SPSS,
SAS, and R. Therefore, it is becoming more important for
students to seek out a university that will prepare them with
knowledge of pertinent software, which will increase their
likelihood of finding a satisfying job. Obviously, careers in
big data will be abundant, so prepared students will have lit-
tle trouble finding a job in that area. Nevertheless, students
trained on high demand software will have more and better
options for job placement.
Future Research
We plan to continue our research of software. While we
acknowledge that no one software is suitable for every project
within a specific sector of industry, we do believe that certain
software may be best matched to the majority of projects
within an industry. By further surveying the use of software
by particular businesses, we hope to discover which software
is best suited to business, mathematics, statistics, engineering,
and other majors. This information should benefit businesses,
schools, and students. We would also like to compare this
with the software that academics use in their research.
Furthermore, we will study database software in much the
same manner that we studied statistical software. As we sur-
veyed businesses and universities about the statistical soft-
ware that they utilize and teach, respectively, many of these
establishments included database software in their responses.
After all, database software serves as the means to organize
the data sets, so the ability to work with database software is
often just as important as the ability to analyze the data sets
with statistical software.
Also, we will look at statistical software and their effective-
ness in teaching. This article has focused primarily on big data
software and their usefulness for finding a job within the busi-
ness world.Another avenue to explore is the feasibility of using
these software and others as tools for learning statistical con-
cepts. Perhaps big data software such as SAS, SPSS, and R are
extremely effective for business tasks, but they are not as effec-
tive for learning statistical concepts in the classroom. Statistical
software that may better suit the classroom environment
include Minitab or Statistica. An analysis of the pros and cons
for these software (and potentially others) is another future goal
of ours.
