Abstract
While research on question­answer sequences has yielded important insights into the structures
of responses and the actions they implement, the advising literature has illuminated how advice-
giving may be resisted or avoided in certain institutional contexts. In this study, we examine the
audio-recorded Q&A sections of applicant webinars delivered by a major philanthropic foundation
in the United States, with a particular focus on the foundation representatives' complex responses
to audience members' yes­no questions that seek specificity. Within a conversation analytic
framework, we show how the practice of going general is engaged to manage the demands of being
helpful to the individual questioner without appearing to guarantee a particular outcome while
foregrounding the foundation's principles and priorities for the broader audience. Findings of this
study may be useful for formulating recommendations for foundation representatives tasked with
communicating effectively with potential grantees.

Introduction
Webinars are an increasingly popular means of conducting presentations, lectures, and
trainings online (Zoumenou et al., 2015). In addition to being a convenient and cost-
effective platform, webinars provide opportunities for real-time interaction between
facilitators and participants (De Gara and Boora, 2006). Managing these interactions,
however, is not always a problem-free undertaking. In informational webinars for pro-
spective grant applicants, for example, the foundation representative's agenda of dis-
seminating `general interest' information may at times conflict with the prospective
applicant's interest in seeking out recommendations on how to proceed with a particular
project in mind. As such, foundation representatives are placed in the somewhat difficult
position of giving advice vis-a-vis the individual projects while preserving the official
stance of disseminating information for the wider audience. In this article, we describe
how representatives of a philanthropic foundation strike a delicate balance by engaging
the practice of what we have roughly glossed as going general (also see Waring, 2017)
in response to yes/no questions that seek specificity, and we do so within a conversation
analytic framework (see `Data and method' below).
Background
Responses to questions
In conversation analysis (CA), a growing body of studies has been dedicated to the vari-
ous issues involved in responding to questions (Enfield et al., 2010; Lee, 2013). One
major finding is that not all responses are equal: some are `preferred' (i.e. occur with
greater frequency or treated as expected), and others `dispreferred'; preferred responses
are typically produced without delay, mitigation, or accounts, while dispreferred
responses are produced with these features (Pomerantz, 1984).Answers, for example, are
preferred over non-answers such as I don't know or silence (Stivers and Robinson, 2006).
In addition, responses to questions that embody aligning actions (e.g. granting of a
request, acceptance of an invitation or offer) are preferred over those that convey non-
aligning actions (Schegloff, 2007). Finally, with regard to yes/no questions, yes responses
are preferred over no responses (Sacks, 1987). Of particular relevance to the focus of our
study, type-conforming responses (i.e. responses that contain yes, no or an equivalent
token such as yeah or uh huh) are preferred over nonconforming responses (i.e. responses
that do not contain such tokens) (Raymond, 2003). Based on 325 instances of grammati-
cally formed yes/no interrogatives (YNIs) from 10 large corpora of naturally occurring
British and American conversations, Raymond (2003) found that type-conforming
responses are far more frequent than nonconforming responses, which indicate some
Waring et al. 309
trouble with or resistance to the question (see below). The author also calls attention to
the notable restriction to type-conforming responses in certain institutional settings (e.g.
courtrooms, standardized surveys).
Asecond major finding is that responses may be formatted in ways that display various
stances toward, or degrees of resistance to, questions (e.g. Clayman and Heritage, 2002;
Drew, 1992; also see Raymond, 2003 above). One can evade answering by engaging overt
practices such as justifying the shift or covert practices such as using subversive word
repeats or operating on the question (Clayman, 2001). One can also treat a question as not
having a straightforward answer by prefacing the response with well (Schegloff and
Lerner, 2009) or a response as motivated independently of a prior action (Clayman, 2013).
One can further push back on the underlying terms of the questions by prefacing a response
with oh (Heritage, 1998), providing repetitional rather than yes/no answers (Heritage and
Raymond, 2012), producing a clausal versus a phrasal response to a specifying wh-ques-
tion (Fox and Thompson, 2010), challenging the question's presuppositions (Ehrlich and
Sidnell, 2006), and responding in ways that retroactively transform the terms and/or the
agenda of the question (Stivers and Hayashi, 2010). Based on data from English and
Japanese everyday conversations, Stivers and Hayashi (2010) show that a response can be
designed to resist (1) the question's terms through specifying or replacing an element in
the question or (2) the question's agenda by adjusting its focus, bias, or presupposition.
Similar responding practices for resisting the constraints of questions are found in lan-
guages other than English and Japanese such as Russian (Bolden, 2009), Danish
(Heinemann, 2009), and Catalan and Spanish (Clemente, 2015).
As can be seen, the existing work on responding to questions has yielded important
insights into the preference structures of responses as well as the actions they implement,
such as resisting a question's terms, agenda, and presuppositions. Our phenomenon of
interest also concerns to some degree the foundation representatives' resistance to ques-
tions and, in particular, the specificity (or potential guidance/advice) sought by the audi-
ence's yes­no questions. To some extent, this resistance to specificity has been
documented in the advising literature.
Resistance to advice-giving
A persistent theme in the advising literature has been the avoidance of overt advice-giv-
ing (e.g. Butler et al., 2010; Limberg and Locher, 2012; Shaw et al., 2015 Silverman,
1997; Vehviläinen, 2012). By framing advice as general information for everyone (e.g.
We strongly recommend that people do X), for example, the ambiguity of giving advice
and giving information can be exploited to manage advice resistance (Kinnell and
Maynard, 1996; Peräkylä and Silverman, 1991; Sarangi, 2000).
Aside from camouflaging advice as some other innocuous activity to manage advice
resistance, participants may also resist advice-giving by maintaining a non-directive
stance in certain institutional settings. Such a stance can be found in the context of risk
communication in genetic counseling, driven by the counselor's particular domain of (in)
expertise as well as the principle of non-directiveness (Sarangi, 2010; Sarangi and
Clarke, 2002). In response to clients' requests such as We would like your advice, for
example, the counselors would avoid direct advice-giving by giving information on what
310 Discourse & Communication 12(3)
others normally do in similar situations (Sarangi, 2010). In their study on Down
Syndrome screening in a Hong Kong prenatal hospital, Zayts and Schnurr (2012) found
that medical professionals respond to specific requests for advice such as Which is the
best for me? by complying with these requests implicitly through information-giving,
thereby upholding the ideology of promoting patient-centered autonomy. Promoting `cli-
ent' autonomy also figures centrally in education, where such promotion tends to clash
with the need to provide guidance to students (Waring and Song, in press). Vehviläinen
(2003), for example, shows how counselors in labor market training at a Finnish adult
education center avoid providing solutions in response to student requests regarding mat-
ters that they should deal with themselves. The counselors do so by responding to the
request but sanctioning it afterwards (e.g. You should not count on me for answers.) or by
withholding advice and shaping the interaction into a questioning sequence, after which
advice can be given as a reaction to the student's response. These practices are imple-
mented, according to Vehviläinen, with the aim of promoting students'self-directedness.
The institutional mandate to empower students'own decision-making that constrains the
teacher's advice-giving is also found in Limberg's (2010) analyses of office hours at a
German university. Similarly, resistance to advice-giving is revealed in He's (1994)
study on academic counseling at an American university, where advisors withhold cer-
tain information from students (e.g. personal opinions or expert judgment) for the pur-
pose of fostering the latter's ability to navigate the university system and make decisions
for themselves.
Several studies have also explored how participants resist addressing a specific
advice-seeking individual for the benefit of informing a wider audience. In his study on
expert advising on call-in radio, for example, Hutchby (1995) shows how the expert
tends to package his advice as general prescriptions and answers more than what the
question asks. In an American Internet health column, the writer manages the public and
personal domains of advice-giving through broadening the scope of the responding letter
and addressing the wider readership directly, among other strategies (Locher, 2006).
Clearly, resistance to advice-giving is part and parcel of navigating certain institution-
specific concerns and constraints (Drew and Heritage, 1992), such as promoting auton-
omy and appealing to a wider audience. The foundation representatives in our data face
similar issues, especially with regard to the goal of informing the wider audience listen-
ing in on the webinar. In addition, the representatives also have an obligation to be
informative without appearing to privilege or guarantee a particular outcome for a poten-
tial applicant (i.e. avoiding the pitfall of leading someone down a `rabbit hole', as one
foundation officer put it). The current project continues to explore how this tension
between generality and specificity is managed and does so with a focus on responses to
yes­no questions within a previously unexplored context ­ that of information webinars
designed by foundation representatives for prospective grantees.
Data and method
Our database consists of 17 publicly available audio-recordings of webinars conducted
in English, and in which presenters on behalf of a major philanthropic foundation in the
United States present information on funding opportunities and address questions from
Waring et al. 311
an audience of prospective applicants. Presenters typically include not only foundation
officers but also individuals from other non-profit organizations, government agencies,
or academic institutions who may be grantees or in partnership with the foundation in
advancing its mission. As such, all presenters represent the foundations'interests to vari-
ous extents and are referred to as `foundation representatives' in our article.
In this study, we examine a collection of 138 yes/no question-response sequences in
which an audience member asks a yes/no question potentially relevant to preparing a
particular proposal, and the response deploys the practice of going general. For each
webinar, the audience is invited to submit questions through an on-screen chat box
throughout the presentations. These questions are to be answered during the Q&A por-
tion of the webinar after the presentations. There is routinely a brief delay before a ques-
tion is responded to, which, according to one of the foundation officers, mainly involves
`negotiating who is best equipped to reply'.
The Q&A portions were transcribed in their entirety using conversation analytic
notations (see Appendix 1) and analyzed within a conversation analytic framework.
CA aims to uncover the tacit methods of social interaction, or how participants
understand each other and make themselves understood. Analysis revolves around
`consistently and insistently' asking a single question: why that now ­ that is, why
something is said or done in that particular way at that particular time? (Heritage and
Clayman, 2010: 14).
As noted earlier, our focus is on detailing how foundation representatives manage
responding to specific audience questions within the institutional requirement of
providing general information for the wider audience. The foundation's written
`guiding principles' emphasize the importance of fair selection of grantees, respon-
siveness to grantees, and open and clear communication with the public. Although
these principles do not translate directly into instructions for how to handle specific
questions, one might argue that while responsiveness calls for individualized atten-
tion, upholding the principle of fairness requires not privileging one potential project
over another (or suggesting a favorable outcome if one does X or Y), and open and
clear communication involves in part the consistent reiteration of the foundation's
primary objectives.
The fact that there is indeed a concern for `going general' oriented to by the partici-
pants themselves in interaction can be seen in the directives representatives give at the
beginning of the Q&A sessions, such as Please ask ONLY general interest questions. Not
surprisingly, the specific audience questions we examine are also produced in ways that at
least blur the boundary between the specific interest in any individual project and general
interest for the wider audience. One might argue, for example, that the X in Would the
foundation be interested in X? is potentially relevant to, not just the question asker, but
others in the audience as well. Our interest, however, is in showing how the responses are
to various degrees designedly resistant to the individualized advice-giving trajectory ­ an
option rendered possible and available by the questions. In responding to the question of
Would the foundation be interested in X?, for example, a simple and definitive yes would
be hearable as potentially advising the questioner to pursue the project related to X. On the
other hand, a less straightforward formulation such as What we are looking for is ... would
constitute information-giving vis-a-vis the yes/no question.
312 Discourse & Communication 12(3)
Analysis
As will be shown, while audience members routinely ask yes/no questions on specific topics
presumably relevant to their own proposals, foundation representatives routinely orient to
their institutional mandate to provide information that is useful to the audience as a whole
and to avoid the appearance of offering specific advice on how to proceed with any one
project.Apractice that we have roughly glossed as going general (also see Waring, 2017) is
mobilized to navigate this subtle tension between doing informing and doing advising.
For the purpose of this study, going general involves the foundation representatives'prac-
tice of designing maximally informative responses to specific yes/no questions while resisting
advice-giving on the potential projects to which those questions are addressed. This practice of
going general is implemented through three different multi-unit turn response formats:
(a)yes/no+
(b) clausal yes/no+
(c)non-yes/no
Yes/no+ entails a clear yes/no (or equivalent lexical tokens such as sure, absolutely,
certainly) somewhere in the response, but mostly at or near the turn-beginning, plus
further talk. Clausal yes/no+ includes a clause that implements a yes/no response with-
out using the tokens yes or no (e.g. Program evaluation would not be appropriate) plus
additional talk. These clausal responses do not always repeat the exact wording of the
questions but are nevertheless inferable as a yes or no. For example, with the question
Would the foundation be receptive to X?, a clausal yes response might be X is something
we would be open to evaluating. As will be shown in the following analysis, the plus (+)
portions of (a) and (b) are not simple reiterations of confirmation or disconfirmation as
in, for example, Yes, we are interested in X, but entail a great deal of interactional work.
Finally, a non-yes/no response consists of a multi-unit turn that does not address the yes/
no aspect of the question at all. Of the 138 yes/no question-response cases, 50 are yes/
no+ (36%), 24 are clausal yes/no+(17%), and 64 are non-yes/no (47%).
With this range of responses, (a) would be considered type-conforming, while (b) and
(c), although not a format distinction made by Raymond (2003), nonconforming. Contrary
to their rare occurrences in Raymond's corpus, the nonconforming responses in our data are
almost twice as many ­ a stark contrast to the institutional settings of courtrooms and stand-
ardized surveys discussed in Raymond (2003). Most importantly, however, while Raymond
(2003) shows that type-conforming responses accept the constraints of the questions, and
nonconforming ones problematize the questions, the focus of our analysis is on how the
three response formats, regardless of their type-conformity, transcend to various degrees the
constraints of the questions in ways that are both responsive and sensitive to specific institu-
tional concerns associated with delivering informational webinars for (grant) applicants.
Yes/no+ format
In this section, we show three exemplars of `yes/no+'responses deployed by the founda-
tionrepresentativesinansweringaudiencequestionsthatseekspecificity.Type-conforming,
unmitigated yes occurs on rare occasions; more often than not, the yes comes with some
Waring et al. 313
sort of hedging, as is the case in our first example. Immediately prior to the segment,
Dana has announced the commencement of the final Q&A session and that she will be
reading through a couple of the chatted-in questions. As the segment begins, Dana reads
a question that concerns the composition of the leadership institute, to which she herself
proceeds to respond in line 06:
(1) five different organizations (WBA9 4208-4310)
01 Dana: .HH the first one i:s (0.2) u:h ((reads))-should
02 (.) the participants attending the leadership
03 institute be representative of fi:ve different
04organizations ideally.
05(.)
06  .hhh U:::M: Yes.

08 we:: we- (0.2) um (.) expect to see diversity: in

25 .hhh >but we do wanna see< diversity in
26that group.
27(2.0)
28>and the< next question i:s: ((reads))
As can be seen, Dana's type-conforming and emphatically delivered yes is preceded by
an inbreath and an elongated um as if a dispreferred response were forthcoming
(Schegloff, 2010). This hedged delay may be alerting the audience to the fact that the
ensuing yes is perhaps not as unproblematic as it looks and that it is expandable. Indeed,
after a brief 0.2-second gap, Dana proceeds to state, not without some difficulty (see
elongation, cut-off, pauses, and the repair initiating um), what we the foundation expect
to see (line 08), thereby clearly marking what's coming up as officially upheld by the
foundation. In particular, she invokes diversity as the guiding principle for composing
the leadership institute. Note that although the audience's yes­no question seeks confir-
mation on the need to include five different organizations (lines 03­04), Dana's response,
as headlined by the `banner' of diversity, lists a much wider range of configurations that
include representatives from different sectors (lines 11­18). What gets highlighted is a
314 Discourse & Communication 12(3)
good mix (line 19) as opposed to the simple and straightforward five different organiza-
tions (lines 03­04) suggested by the questioner. Dana's turn ends with a reiteration of we
do wanna to see diversity in that group (lines 25­26), again conveying the foundation's
perspective through the institutional we.
Dana's yes response to the audience question is qualified by her own talk both preceding
and following the yes. While the yes confirms the acceptability of five different organiza-
tions, its preceding and subsequent qualifications caution the audience against a narrow
understanding of eligibility by explicating and exemplifying the diversity principle. In the
end, in addition to answering the question as framed by the audience member, the question
Dana ends up answering also concerns the broader issue of how to select participants for
the leadership institute ­ an issue applicable across contexts and relevant to the wider audi-
ence. In so doing, she traverses beyond the terms of the question and succeeds in maintain-
ing her mission as a foundation representative of effectively disseminating information.
Our next case involves a no response to the audience's question. The segment begins
with Betty reading a question regarding whether a proposal should be aligned with one
of the three hubs (lines 05­07), to which Joy responds in line 09:
(2) align with hubs (WBA10 5435-5513)
01 Betty: um the next question. ((reads))-in
02 addition to explaining how our proposal fits
03 with the objective of the CfP, and advances
04 the culture of health, .hh should
05 applicants try to align proposals with the
06 work (.) of the ((university name)) team?=or one of
07 the three hubs?
08(0.8)
09 Joy:  um ((clears throat)) no. (it) necessarily (.) does
10 not have to align with one of us?=um (0.2) what
11 we were- >speaking to earlier< was if you're
12 going to work in an area (0.2) um that >one of
13 the hubs< is already doing we would
14 want you to make sure >that there's no

16 only mimic what's going on at- at ((university name))
17 >or one of the hubs.<
18(3.2)
19 Betty: $all r(h)ight$ hhuh heh heh ( ) um so
20you're ((continues with a clarification question))
Joy's response begins with a turn-initial um (Schegloff, 2010) that suggests a possible
dispreferred second pair-part in the works, as materialized in the ensuing no (Sacks,
1987). In keeping with the typical format of dispreferred responses that involves delay,
mitigation, or accounts (Pomerantz, 1984), Joy's no is then expanded into a full clausal
no that slightly mitigates the negative response with necessarily does not (lines 09­10).
She then rushes past the possible completion of the clausal turn-constructional unit
(TCU) (Sacks et al., 1974) and stops at a point of maximal grammatical control (Schegloff,
Waring et al. 315
1996) (i.e. after the um which clearly projects more to come) (line 10). What follows is
a clarification of what they were speaking to earlier (line 11) ­ one that entails the no
duplication principle that, again, the institutional `we' expects from a wide range of pro-
posals (lines 13­15). Like the principle of diversity invoked in the prior extract, the
principle of `no duplication' is what Joy resorts to as she resists catering exclusively to
the specificity pursued by the question. This resistance is further evidenced in the ending
of her turn, where she conveys a negative stance toward that specificity by replacing the
questioner's positively framed align with the negatively intoned mimic as she empha-
sizes what we're not asking you to do (lines 15­16)
In both segments, the foundation representative produces a response that transcends
the type-conforming yes/no to spotlight a certain guiding principle upheld by the founda-
tion that is applicable, but not limited, to the specific matter being queried. In other words,
beyond answering the question of whether a specific X should be done, the `plus' portion
of the representative's response shifts to answer a different sort of question ­ that of what
the driving principle behind decisions on X is (also see Stivers and Hayashi, 2010). In so
doing, the foundation representative resists the restraint projected by yes/no questions that
seek specificity related to individual projects and chooses, instead, to use the opportunity
to reiterate basic foundation principles for the wider audience that may in turn effectively
address a range of questions that no longer need to be asked. Stivers and Heritage (2001)
also show how in comprehensive history-taking during doctor­patient interaction, patients
sometimes go beyond the yes/no by bringing in additional materials from their life world
as a way of expressing their concerns. The plus portions of our foundation representatives'
responses, as has been shown, manifest a different set of institution-specific concerns.
Clausal yes/no+ format
Responses to the audience's yes/no questions do not always include a type-conforming
yes or no or their lexical equivalents. In some cases, foundation representatives offer a
yes/no-equivalent response in clausal form. Instead of Yes, for example, in response to
Do you fund qualitative research?, a yes-equivalent clausal response would be We do
fund qualitative research or We're open to qualitative research. A clausal yes/no+
response then includes the yes/no-equivalent clause plus additional components. In this
section, we consider two such cases, with the first involving a no-equivalent response
and the second a yes-equivalent one. In the first segment below, the audience question
concerns whether there is a preference toward certain types of data sources and method-
ologies (lines 02­03). While foundation guidelines may stipulate which types of propos-
als are appropriate, preference is a less definable matter. In other words, the question
does not lend itself to an easy yes/no answer:
(3) preference for data or methods (WBA19 2023-2058)
01 Bonnie: .hh u::h here's a question, Mary for
02you::. ((reads))-is there a preference
03towards certain types (.) of data sources
04and methodologies?
316 Discourse & Communication 12(3)
05(1.0)
06 Mary:  °so° I wouldn't say there's a preference?
07 um but we a::re looking for stro::ng
08 empirica::l (.) research?=um >with
09 reasonable and rigorous< me:thods.=and (.)
10 .hh given the investigator initiated approach
11 of this call for proposals? .h we:: leave this
12 open?=to:: the:: applicants to determine the
13 methods that are best suited to answer their
14 research questio:ns.=as well as (.) .hh what
15 data sources a::re available and
16appro#priate.#
17(1.0)
18 Bonnie: <and here's another question? ((reads))
Note that after Mary's turn-initial so, delivered in raised pitch and sotto voce and
hearable as projecting a `long story', her no-equivalent clausal response is packaged
with the hedging I wouldn't say as well as rising intonation (line 06). While `there's
no preference' would constitute a categorical denial, I wouldn't say frames the issue
as a matter of wording and invites the recipient to search for what I would say.
Indeed, as with the other cases we have observed, Mary does not stop at answering
the question as it is asked. Her denial of a preference is immediately followed by an
account, prefaced with um but, of what we are looking for (line 07). As can be seen,
in lieu of certain types of data sources and methodologies in the audience question,
Mary emphasizes strong empirical research and reasonable and rigorous methods
(lines 07­08). In so doing, she resists the question's agenda (Stivers and Hayashi,
2010) that seeks clarity on the foundation's preference and appears to presuppose
such a preference for certain data and methods (e.g. qualitative vs quantitative). She
then further resists offering a solution by highlighting the investigator initiated
approach that invites the applicants to determine the suitability of their data sources
and methods to answering their questions (lines 10­14). Mary, in other words, man-
ages to formulate a response to the question in such a way that foregrounds the
foundation's priorities of supporting strong and rigorous research for an audience
with a variety of potential data sources and methods suited to their individual
projects.
In the next segment, the audience queries whether X is considered research (lines
05-07), and upon being selected by Ellen, Nora accepts with sure and proceeds to explic-
itly frame her response as an answer to the question (line 10). As it turns out, however, the
answer is not a definitive one but a possible yes delivered in a clausal format (line 10):
(4) evaluation of implementation (WBA6 2903-3023)
01 Ellen: the first question .hh i:s, (0.2)

In line 10, Nora's clausal response is prefaced with um followed by a micro-pause and
tch, possibly adumbrating trouble of some sort (Schegloff, 2010). Thereafter, instead
of producing a straightforward `yes' or `no', she places what follows in the frame of
the answer is that along with a partial repetition of the question's subject evaluation of
uh program or policy, thereby further delaying the actual answer. The predicate or the
actual answer is yet again delayed with the (0.8) second pause (line 11) before it is
produced with the stressed and elongated epistemic modal can, suggesting the possi-
bility of such work being considered research ­ a possibility contingent upon a list of
criteria introduced by the phrase but it depends on (line 12). By appending the possibly
yes-clausal response as such then, Nora manages to rise above the specificity of pro-
gram or policy evaluation to espouse the foundation's interests in seeking and support-
ing rigorous and generalizable research (line 13, 15 and 20). At the same time, she is
able to address the audience's specific concerns in the case of program evaluation by
outlining what would not be considered rigorous (lines 15­16) and what should not
receive the majority of fundings (line 17).
In sum, the clausal format appears to be a useful resource for delivering more nuanced
responses to questions that do not clearly lend themselves to a straightforward yes/no. In
both cases above, while the clausal yes/no answers the specific questions, in the plus por-
tion of the responses, the foundation representatives go general by underscoring the
foundation's priorities, the reasoning behind the priorities, and further interpretations of
those priorities. In so doing, they partially resist the constraints set forth by the questions
while preserving their footing as ambassadors charged with the task of publicizing the
foundation's missions.
318 Discourse & Communication 12(3)
Non-yes/no format
Some clausal responses do not contain any yes/no answers to the questions. As will be
shown, the foundation representatives choose instead to skirt the issues by reiterating
what they are looking for, explicating why they are looking for X, and inviting potential
grantees to make their own decisions on the appropriateness of their projects in light of
the foundation's priorities. We consider two such cases in this section. In the first excerpt
below, the audience's question of whether the foundation would give a grant to a certain
type of organization is responded to with neither a yes/no+ nor a clausal yes/no+:
(5) durable medical equipment (WBA12 3453-3522)
01 David: ((reads))-will the foundation consider
02 granting an organization. that supplies
03 durable medical equipment to
04 under-served people with disabilities.
05(0.8)
06  we are looking for organizations that
07 represent the four sectors. business,
08 philanthropy, media, a:nd (1.0)
09 Cate: °faith-based°
10 David: and faith-based.
11 Cate: °>that's [right.<°]
12 David: [if the- ] if the applying
13 organization fits in those categories. (0.8)
14 then the answer's yes.
15 Cate: °>mhm,<°
16 Cody: ((reads))-does nonprofit association ((continues))
Notably, David restates what we are looking for ­ organizations that represent four sectors
(lines 06­07) ­ information that is presumably included in the general call for proposals.
The listing of the four sectors is completed in collaboration with Cate (lines 07­11). He
then goes on to invite the audience to decide for themselves whether their specific organi-
zation fits into these categories (lines 12­14). Note that although we see the yes token in
line 14, it is certainly not a yes response to the audience question. Rather, it is a yes that
the audience has to arrive at on their own based on their own judgment. In so doing, David
offers the resources for the audience to find answers without committing to an interest in
any specific organization. In fact, shifting the responsibility of finding answers back to the
audience (e.g. it's up to you) is a move foundation officers repeatedly deploy in our data
set. In the meantime, David's listing of the four sectors serves as a useful reminder for the
wider audience who may then check their own eligibility against these categories. In other
words, while responding to the question to some extent, David also resists specific advice-
giving by going general and maintaining the information-giving stance.
While David's response provides the resources for audience autonomy, Claire's
response in the next segment rejects the terms of the question entirely when the audi-
ence asks whether a particular citation format needs to be followed (lines 02­04):
Waring et al. 319

27(1.0)
28 we have another question? ((reads))
Claire's resistance to the question's agenda can be observed as early as line 04 in the
midst of her reading of the question as she speeds up and abandons the reading entirely
with a cut-off. The ensuing assertion of we not being sticklers for form is preceded,
not surprisingly, by some trouble (uh- you know (0.2)), given its `(self)-interruptive'
and dis-aligning stance toward the question. The contrastive nO:T being sticklers
with its prosodic emphasis is hearable as treating the question as pre-supposing that
the foundation are sticklers. The claim of the foundation's concern for substance (line
06) is then further specified with what we're not looking at (lines 08­11). Similar to
what we have observed in the prior segment, Claire then essentially invites the audi-
ence, beginning with the if clause that embeds the principle regarding the inclusion of
references, to decide for themselves whether such inclusion would be appropriate
(lines 14­18), at which point her response is presumably complete.
With a but followed by a brief pause and some quick speech perturbation, however,
Claire continues with a reiteration of we're looking for substance (lines 19­20), which is
explicated with the importance of diving into a needy and worthy problem ... to change
the world (lines 21­23). She ends with a so-prefaced summative statement using the
320 Discourse & Communication 12(3)
anaphoric that to highlight the rationale of the program (i.e. resources devoted to sub-
stantive change in the world) (lines 24­26).
In the segment then, the foundation representative rejects the terms of the question
entirely and responds with an alternative framing and reiteration (also see Stivers and
Hayashi, 2010), not just for the questioner, but the general audience, of the institutional
priority on substance and what such substance entails. An advice-giving stance in this
case would perhaps involve further engagement with the specifics of which citations
may or may not qualify as `appropriate'. One might argue then that the direct reaching
for the general policy embodies a degree of resistance to advice-giving in part through
suggesting that the wrong question is being asked.
In the above two cases, the individual questions are not directly responded to. Rather,
the foundation representatives reject the terms of the question entirely or shift the deci-
sion-making responsibility back to the questioner before returning to an explication of
the foundation's focus, priority, or mission. In so doing, they resist, or at least limit, the
possibility of engaging with individual advising while fulfilling their responsibility of
clearly and effectively disseminating information to an audience of potential grantees. At
the same time, audience questions that seek specificity are arguably addressed to varying
extents as well, just not within the parameters within which they are raised.
Discussion and conclusion
In this article, we have shown that in responding to prospective grantees' yes/no ques-
tions that seek specificity, foundation representatives routinely deliver `big package'
responses with multi-unit turns that do more than answer the question as posed. As such,
they leverage the three formats of yes/no+, clausal yes/no+, and non-yes/no to transcend
the specifics of the question and reiterate the foundation's principles and priorities, which
are regularly introduced with linguistic routines such as again, as long as, and what
we're looking for is with the institutional we. While remaining responsive to audience
questions to various extents, this move to go general or reach for the bigger picture
embodies various degrees of resistance to the terms dictated by the questions and to
individualized advice-giving. While yes/no+ provides (dis)confirmation of the issues
raised by the questions, clausal yes/no+ does so with greater qualification or indirect-
ness, and non-yes/no represents the more extreme approach of not directly addressing the
questions at all.
The three different formats present different affordances for the foundation representa-
tives to accomplish their professional work. While yes/no+ is fitted to the availability of a
straightforward response, clausal yes/no+ facilitates the delivery of a more nuanced yes/
no, and non-yes/no is done to reject the terms of the question, handle rare exceptions, and
firmly shift the responsibility of assessing how specific projects fit with foundation priori-
ties back to the questioners. With this range of formats, the foundation representatives
manage the delicate balance between giving advice and giving information, which can be
represented on a continuum with increasing emphasis on informing, or in other words,
resistance to the appearance of doing individual advising (see Figure 1).
In sum, we started with an interest in the ways in which the multi-unit responses in
our data appear to resist the specificity sought by the questions and aim instead to
Waring et al. 321
address broader issues and principles related to funding opportunities. We propose that
this practice of going general is one way in which the foundation representatives navi-
gate a tension between doing informing on general matters and doing advising on
specific matters related to particular projects. By going general, foundation representa-
tives are able to provide potentially useful information on how to interpret application
instructions and requirements, and they can do so without appearing to be giving
advice on particular projects, or by extension, guaranteeing a favorable outcome for
any particular proposal.
While Steensig and Heinemann (2013) have shown how certain yes/no questions
(e.g. expansion eliciting questions) are designed to elicit responses that expand upon
the type-conforming `yes' or `no' (also see Raymond, 2010), our focus has been not on
the questions, but on the `big package' responses and what these responses may look
like in the institutional context of informational webinars for (grant) applicants. As
such, our findings contribute to the growing body of literature that documents the com-
plexity, and in particular, resistance, involved in responding to questions. Similar to
Fox and Thompson's (2010) claim that clausal responses to specifying wh-questions
may indicate resistance to prior questions, we have shown that such resistance exists
in the case of yes/no questions as well. Similar to Stivers and Hayashi's (2010) partici-
pants in ordinary conversation, the foundation representatives in our data also produce
transformative answers but do so not for the sole purpose of problematizing the terms
and agenda of the questions. The transformation is leveraged here to manage being
helpful to the individual while remaining maximally informative to the wider audi-
ence, as in part evidenced in the yes/no+ format (absent in Stivers and Hayashi's data)
that includes a clear and straightforward response to the question. Compared to the
scarcity of nonconforming questions in Raymond (2003), their prevalence in our data
may speak to the particular institutionality of informational applicant webinars where
foundation representatives face a complex set of interactional demands that defy the
straightforwardness embodied in type-conforming responses. We have also made a
further distinction between two specific formats of nonconforming (clausal yes/no and
non-clausal) and demonstrated the interactional affordances of these formats. More
importantly, we have shown that even with what would be considered type-conforming
responses delivered in the yes/no+ format, the participants display some sort of resist-
ance to the constraints of the question through the plus (+) portion of the talk. In other
words, the three formats represent a nuanced set of resources, with increasing or
decreasing resistance to the question's agenda, for crafting complex responses sensi-
tive to the needs of the individual, the audience, and the foundation ­ responses that
Figure 1. Three response formats.
322 Discourse & Communication 12(3)
cannot be easily categorized as conforming or nonconforming, or accepting or resist-
ing. While such degrees of question resistance are gauged in Stivers and Hayashi
(2010) by whether the resistance targets only the question's terms or includes its
agenda as well, we offer another lens for considering degrees of resistance ­ via a set
of response formats in informational webinars.
These findings also contribute to the advising literature with regard to resistance to
advice-giving in particular. First, similar to the advice-givers in Hutchby (1995) and
Locher (2006), who package their advice for a broader audience over the radio and the
Internet, the foundation officers in our data also design their responses, especially in
the `plus' portions of yes/no+ and clausal yes/no+, for a wider audience that extends
beyond the individual questioner. Second, rather than exploiting the advice-informa-
tion ambiguity to camouflage advice as information, thereby softening its edge as
targeting an advice recipient, in the context of applicant webinars, information-giving
is deployed in a slightly different way ­ to move away from or to withhold advice-
giving. The issue, therefore, is less about giving advice diplomatically and more about
striving to maintain some distance from giving advice at all. Finally, this resistance to
advice-giving is reminiscent of that in education and medical contexts, where advice
may be withheld for the benefit of promoting autonomy (e.g. He, 1998) or upholding
a patient-centered ideology (e.g. Sarangi, 2010). In the context of informational webi-
nars for grant applicants, while promoting autonomy is a palpable concern as mani-
fested in such routine phrasings as it's up to you, there appear to be other constraints
specific to the setting as well. In addition to striving to frame discussions as relevant
to the whole audience and doing so within a single response slot, without the benefit
of the interactive back-and-forth featured in other types of advising encounters, the
officers also have an obligation, as noted earlier, to be informative without appearing
to guarantee a particular outcome for a potential applicant.
By foregrounding how the institutional tension between `doing (general) inform-
ing' and `doing (individual) advising' may be navigated, our detailing of this profes-
sional expertise may offer a useful basis for developing materials for training future
`ambassadors' for the foundation's mission ­ a step toward identifying `best prac-
tices' for webinar facilitation (Zoumenou et al., 2015) in a particular context. Aside
from articulating and making available a range of strategies for handling such ques-
tions, training sessions may be held where future ambassadors are invited to con-
sider, for example, the specific cases as documented in the paper, brainstorming for
potential responses to particular questions and examining actual responses for the
specific ways in which they are effective. While existing training is likely to involve
the delivery of monologic `stump' speeches, a focus on handling sometimes unfore-
seen audience questions would fill an important gap in such training. Finally, while
the webinar format has the clear advantage of being efficient, the `one-shot' question
and answer format necessarily incurs certain limitations. There is no way to gauge,
for example, whether a question has been adequately addressed from an audience's
perspective as the moderator is the one who typically offers the sequence-closing
third (Schegloff, 2007). Reflecting on the profits and pitfalls of this particular format
for information dissemination may yield useful insights into maximizing its
affordances and minimizing its constraints.
