Abstract. A shape bias for extending names to objects that look visually similar has been commonly
accepted but it is hard to define which kind of shape dissimilarities are diagnostic for the identity
of an object. Here, we present a transformational approach to describe shape differences that can
incorporate many significant shape features. We introduce two kinds of transformations: one kind
concerns linear transformations of the image plane (affine transformations), generally limiting shape
variations within the borders of basic-level categories; the other kind concerns nonlinear continuous
transformations of the image plane (topological transformations), allowing all kinds of shape variation
crossing and not crossing the borders of basic-level categories. We administered stimulus pairs
differing in these shape transformations to children of 3 years to 7 years old in a delayed match-
to-sample task. With increasing age, especially between 5 years and 6 years, children became more
sensitive to the topological deformations that are relevant for between-category distinctions, indicating
that acquired categorical knowledge in early years induces perceptual learning of the relevant generic
shape differences between categories.
1 Introduction
Not all shape changes are equally important. Variation in metric properties is generally
allowed between different exemplars of the same basic-level category, whereas differences
in other shape features are sometimes crucial to distinguish between objects belonging to
different categories. For example, bowls can be deeper or shallower and bottles can be longer
or shorter and thinner or thicker, but bowls and bottles differ categorically in the curvature
variation along their contours. In this study, we hypothesize that children become more
sensitive by age to shape changes that imply a category change (eg from bowl to bottle) than
to shape changes that imply no category change (eg from a shallow bowl to a deeper one).
To test this idea we apply a transformational approach to shape perception. Specifically,
we use a procedure which was first introduced in computer vision (so-called thin plate
splines; see Bookstein 1989), which interpolates the contour changes from a primary contour
to a target contour towards the whole image plane. Each planar transformation involves
two components: a planar affine (linear) transformation and a (nonlinear) topological trans-
formation. The latter kind allows contour changes that are relevant for making categorical
distinctions and the former kind allows variation in metric properties that are less relevant for
categorical distinctions. An interesting aspect of this procedure is that it can also be applied
to random (nonexisting) contours, allowing us to contrast the sensitivity for these two kinds
of transformations between everyday objects and similar nonsense shapes.
Suppose that children become more sensitive to relevant shape changes (nonlinear
topological transformations) compared with irrelevant shape changes (linear topological
transformations). In principle, such a differential development of sensitivity can be localized
on two levels. First, category representations might enhance the detection of shape differ-
ences for two objects belonging to different categories. Then, we expect that our hypothesis
holds only for contours derived from existing objects. However, when the hypothesis holds
122 B Ons, J Wagemans
for existing and nonexisting objects, we can conclude that children acquired different modes
of shape processing for relevant and irrelevant shape properties independently from the
relevant category representations. In other words, relevant and irrelevant shape properties
would then be processed automatically and independently from interpretations resulting
from identification or categorization processes. We test this hypothesis using a delayed
match-to-sample task with outlines derived from everyday objects as well as with outlines of
nonsense shapes, sharing similar properties and undergoing similar shape transformations.
Before we describe the study in more detail, we provide somewhat more background to
support our hypothesis and to substantiate our design choices.
1.1 Shape-based categorization
In several different tasks, it has been demonstrated that names are generalized to new objects
that preserve the shape properties of a category (Landau and Leyton 1999; Landau et al 1988,
1998; Smith 2003). The shape bias for extending categories to new exemplars increases by age.
For instance, in Landau et al (1988) participants generalized from a reference object towards
new instances and they seemed to rely even more on shape cues when the reference objects
were labeled. These kinds of results have led to the consideration that shape perception
forms a precursor for category development in children as well as adults. Nouns used in
everyday language refer often to rather general classes (eg the noun `dog' to refer to a German
shepherd or a golden retriever). General classes that are referred to by nouns in everyday
language have often been called the basic level of abstraction (Jolicoeur et al 1984; Rosch and
Mervis 1975; Rosch et al 1976). From the perspective of shape perception, the basic level of
category inclusiveness is the level of shape abstraction that maximizes within-category shape
similarity and between-category shape dissimilarity, and children might be predisposed to
form perceptual categories that group objects together that look similar and to separate
objects that look dissimilar.
In contrast, other theories have indicated that the basic level might appear later in
development through differentiation of more general classes and the generalization of deep
properties (Dewar and Xu 2009; Mandler and McDonough 1993). According to this alternative
view, categories are formed on the basis of category membership and by a subdivision of
objects into kinds. Such a mechanism could also lead to a reliance on shape perception but
then only as a by-product of an acquired correlation between shapes and kinds that has been
learned through experience. Although the primacy of shape in language development is part
of a long-standing debate, the weaker version of the shape bias--the expectation that same
shaped objects are referred to by the same labels--is widely accepted.
In former views, word learning and language development were frequently thought of as
a gradual learning process based on some predispositions and some acquired skills. Contrary
to language development, shape perception was often thought of as part of a granted and
consolidated skill in an early stage of development. In the present study, however, we focus
instead on the further development of shape perception in young children between the ages
of 3 years and 7 years. Although children have acquired a massive body of language skills at
that age, it makes sense to believe that just like language skills the acquisition of perceptual
skills is also subject to ongoing learning, and, furthermore, that both vital functions evolve in
parallel and interact with each other throughout the life span. More specifically, we believe
that the abstraction process which underlies concepts and categories is also reflected in the
development of children's sensitivity to perceive shape properties that are crucial for basic-
level discrimination and abstraction (see Son et al 2008). However, before we can investigate
the interplay between language and visual perception, a good general description of shape
perception is mandatory and in the next section we will devote a great deal of attention to a
general procedure to describe two-dimensional (2D) contour shape differences.
Development of differential shape sensitivity 123
1.2 Within- and between-category shape changes
We will first describe our shape manipulations in the light of shape perception and object
identity. The most crucial information about shape is contained in the bounding contours
(eg De Winter and Wagemans 2004; Feldman and Singh 2005). Closed contours can always
be transformed into any other closed contour through a smooth transformation. In line
with the generative approach by Leyton (1987) and the transformational approach by Graf
(2002), and building on the mathematical framework of a hierarchy of transformations (Klein
1939 [1872]), we can classify shape differences between any pair of contours in terms of
the transformations needed to match them (see also Todd et al 1998; Van Gool et al 1994;
Wagemans et al 1997).
The most general class of smooth transformations between two contours are topological
transformations. Some generic examples of topological transformations are illustrated in
the left-hand columns of figure 1. The direction of the arrows indicates the direction of the
transformations from one 2D vector space, the original image plane, towards another 2D
vector space, the transformed image plane. As a consequence of the image transformations,
the contours deform in a specific manner in order to match the contours of the bowls
onto the contours of the bottles and the contours of the cups onto the contours of the
pans. Projective transformations form a subgroup of the more general class of topological
transformations but they allow less freedom in matching two contours. They are perfectly
suitable for describing viewpoint differences between projections in the image plane from a
three-dimensional solid shape. Similarly, affine transformations form a subgroup embedded
in the more general class of projective transformations. A contour match through affine
transformations is far from trivial and succeeds only for specific pairs of contours like the
examples illustrated in the right-hand columns of figure 1. The arrows represent the direction
of the image transformation that is needed to match the bowl, bottle, cup, and pan on the left
to the more sheared bowl, bottle, cup, and pan on the right. Finally, within the class of affine
transformations, metric transformations form a subgroup that is able to match identical
shaped contours that differ only in orientation and position in the image plane (including
reflections).
When two objects are matched through a metric transformation, they are often inter-
preted as identical images. A match in affine and projective transformations leads to object
pairs that are often conceived as identical objects or objects belonging to the same basic-
level class. Also, some minor nonlinear topological transformations can create variation
that is still allowed in the same basic-level category. More generally, however, topological
deformations often lead to interpretations of objects belonging to different basic-level
classes--for example, like the left-hand columns in figure 1. In sum, the more constrained the
geometric freedom for matching two shapes, the more likely that two images are interpreted
as similar objects (see also Feldman 2009). This proposal relates also to similar notions from
biologists who attempted to describe variations of form within and between different kinds
(D'Arcy Thompson 1942; see also Graf 2002, 2006).
We should add two cautionary notes at this point. First, when we are referring to
topological transformations in this paper, we do not imply to make use of all degrees
of freedom which are generally allowed by them (making all closed contours without
holes essentially equivalent). We just want to refer to the larger class of transformations
containing both the linear and nonlinear transformations. Second, by suggesting a rough
correspondence between linear versus nonlinear shape transformations and within- versus
between-category shape differences, we do not claim to have solved the deep and difficult
question as to when exactly a nonlinear transformation (or a linear one for that matter)
actually creates a shape change which is going to be perceived as a qualitative or basic-level
124 B Ons, J Wagemans
distinction. We use our approach as a first approximation, but we leave a thorough and
detailed examination of this issue for future research.
In the present study we will focus on two groups of transformations: the topological
(nonlinear) deformations to generate contour differences for objects belonging to different
basic-level categories and the affine (linear) transformations to generate instances for objects
belonging to the same basic-level class. Note that the aim of describing shape differences
through transformations is not to present a new theory on visual processing; rather, the aim
of the introduced approach is to provide a general description of shape differences relevant
for many theories of visual processing. Indeed, many views of visual processing and shape
descriptions can be related to the invariants emerging from the transformational approach.
In the next section we will highlight some correspondences with some eminent theories on
visual processing.
Figure 1. Examples of topological deformations (two columns on the left) and affine transformations
(two columns on the right) between and within bowls and bottles (upper two rows), and between and
within cups and pans (bottom two rows). The contours are derived from the Snodgrass and Vanderwart
set (1980; see De Winter and Wagemans 2004; Wagemans et al 2008). The deformation of the coordinate
grids shows how the space transforms from a straight rectangular grid into a nonrectangular grid.
Deformation was accomplished through the thin plate spline procedure (Bookstein 1989; see appendix
A). Note that the horizontal pairs depict contours from the same basic-level category, while the vertical
pairs show stimuli from different basic-level categories. Note also that each set of four contours on the
left is exactly the same as the corresponding four contours on the right.
1.3 Planar transformations and theories on visual processing
In addition to being grounded in solid mathematical work, the distinction between affine
and topological invariants also seems to correspond quite naturally to a number of relevant
perceptual shape characteristics. First, it relates to the part-based view on object repre-
sentations. Tversky (1989) found that 5-year olds detect missing parts faster when they
belong to the contour and when they affect shape (for the importance of parts in children's
Development of differential shape sensitivity 125
categorization, see also Rakison and Butterworth 1998). In structural description models
such as Biederman's (1987) recognition-by-components (RBC) theory, object representations
consist of structural relations among volumetric parts. Objects are perceived by first analyzing
them into their volumetric constituents and then matching their configuration to memory
representations. The broader class of deformations depicted in the left-hand columns of
figure 1 can create new parts (eg a bowl consisting of one-part transforms into a bottle
consisting of two parts), while the linear transformations preserve the same kind and number
of parts. The distinction between these two kinds of shape changes therefore seems to
take into account the importance of parts that are visible along the contour for category
membership.
Second, in Biederman's (1987) RBC theory, a distinction is also made between changes
of metric properties of shape primitives (eg length, angle) and changes of so-called
nonaccidental properties (NAPs) (eg symmetry, parallelism). In order to derive the basic
primitives quickly and robustly from the input images, some shape changes are treated in
a dichotomous or categorical way by the visual system (Kukkonen et al 1996; Wagemans
1992, 1993; Wagemans et al 2000). For example, the axis of parts can be straight or curved,
and the edges can be straight or curved, parallel or not parallel, elongated or not elongated,
etc. It is obvious from figure 1 that the planar linear transformations preserve most of these
NAPs (eg the edges of the bottle will be parallel and the axis will be straight for all exemplars
created by affine transformations), while the nonlinear transformations cause categorical
shape differences (eg from straight to curved lines, from parallel to nonparallel). The linear
transformations all preserve affine shape properties such as parallelism and straightness,
while the broader class of topological transformations destroy such properties generally (eg
straight lines can become curved). In a recent study Kayaert and Wagemans (2010) have
shown that infants and toddlers are more sensitive to categorical shape changes (eg the
transformation of a trapezium into a triangle) than to metric shape changes (eg changing the
aspect ratio of the shapes). Here, we extend this to much more subtle shape changes applied
to more complex shapes, and tested with older children.
Third, in a series of approaches (eg Bhatt et al 2006; Biederman 1987; De Winter and
Wagemans 2006; Feldman and Singh 2005; Hoffman and Richards 1984), it is assumed that the
visual system tracks the shape boundary and searches for concave regions and discontinuities
along the edges of objects that are thought to be significant for part decomposition. Such a
mechanism for signaling the part joints can be achieved from bottom-up information alone
and does not need any knowledge beforehand about the object and its part composition.
A recent study from our laboratory demonstrated that points of maximal curvature along
the concave regions of the boundary are marked more easily as salient when the boundary
makes a sharp turn in a point and when the 2D part connected to the point is less compact
and sticks out more (De Winter and Wagemans 2008). Furthermore, recognition speed for
fragmented contours showed an early advantage in closure of contour fragments when
the presented fragments were located away from salient points (easier to view part shape),
whereas a converse advantage was found in later matching processes when the fragments
were located around salient points that could signal the part structure of the object (Panis
and Wagemans 2009; Panis et al 2008a). Points of maximal curvature along the boundary are
preserved for all variants of linear image transformations, while salient points are not always
preserved among nonlinear image transformations. It should be noted that salient points
are important not only in part-based theories of object recognition but also in theories of
continuous shape spaces and holistic views (eg Bülthoff and Edelman 1992; Edelman 1999).
Moreover, the specific transformation procedure using thin plate splines (see methods and
126 B Ons, J Wagemans
appendix A) makes use of a measure called bending energy which can be interpreted as a
measure of similarity between different shapes in a shape space (see Edelman 1999).
In sum, the dichotomous shape manipulation that is presented here can embrace many
features that are believed to be of psychological importance in object recognition and
although different theories on visual processing propose different crucial properties, they
are all structurally related to each other.
1.4 The present study
In the present study we investigate how shape sensitivity for two kinds of shape dissimilarities
develops in young children: one kind of shape dissimilarity (see figure 1, left-hand two
columns, changes in the vertical direction) can be related to shape differences between
basic-level categories, while the other kind of shape transition (see figure 1, right-hand two
columns, changes in the horizontal direction) is rather generally restricted within a basic-level
class. As young children develop an impressive vocabulary and name objects preferably at
the basic level of abstraction, we expected that the use of basic-level abstractions should lead
to an increase in sensitivity for relevant shape properties that are helpful for making these
distinctions in everyday life. That is, we predicted a more profound increase in sensitivity
for shape dissimilarities between members of different basic-level classes compared with
shape dissimilarities between members of the same basic-level class. In other words, we
investigated the influence of categorization on the development of shape perception.
The task we used was a delayed match-to-sample task using a single shape as target and
two shapes (one identical and one similar) as test pair. The shape which was similar to the
target shape was derived from it by one of the transformations of interest. The two shape
classes involved in the experiment are labeled LIN (see figure 1 and figure 2), referring to the
linear behavior of the planar grid for affine transformations, and NONLIN1, referring to the
nonlinear behavior of the image grid for the broader class of topological transformations.
A third shape class involved a more intense nonlinear transformation of the image plane
consisting of the shape differences combining the LIN and NONLIN shape differences.
Although such a combination is also a nonlinear transformation, in order to distinguish it
from the second class, NONLIN1, we referred to this class by the label NONLIN2. Hence,
in the delayed match-to-sample task, children viewed a target stimulus followed by two
simultaneously presented stimuli located at random positions on the screen. One of the
two stimuli consisted of the target, while the second stimulus consisted of a distracter
created from three possible transformations: LIN, NONLIN1, or NONLIN2. In short, we
measured children's ability to differentiate shapes defined by their contour at various ages
and estimated the developmental trend for the three types of shape differences.
2 Method
2.1 Participants
Eighty-one children between the ages of 3.2 and 7.1 participated in the study (mean 4.90, SD
0.98). They were recruited from two schools in two communities near Antwerp in Belgium
(Laerhof in Merksem and De Vlinder in Brasschaat). Participation was voluntary and the study
was conducted according to the American Psychological Association's guidelines (including
informed consent procedure). We focused on the age between 3 and 7 because vocabulary
continues to develop rapidly at that age and children are identifying objects regularly by their
basic-level class nouns. Additionally, they already have the capability to participate in an
experiment that looks like a computer game.
2.2 Stimuli
Three stimulus pairs were selected from our set of outlines (Wagemans et al 2008) derived
from the Snodgrass and Vanderwart (1980) set: lamp and wineglass, bottle and guitar, and
Development of differential shape sensitivity 127
doll and ostrich (see figure 2, upper two rows). In addition, there were three artificial stimulus
pairs created by the addition of multiple line fragments randomly selected from contours
of the Snodgrass and Vanderwart set. The additions of two successive line fragments were
carried out in such a way that the curvature in the joints was limited and smooth (almost
straight). The variable that distinguishes between these two kinds of contours (existing versus
nonexisting) was labeled KIND.
Warping algorithms are usually carried out on landmarks and these landmarks are chosen
computationally or subjectively in correspondence to what someone believes to be important
corresponding points for matching two sets. For dissimilar contours of objects from different
basic-level categories, no satisfactory criteria are possible for choosing landmarks that
correspond to each other (which is the reason why previous studies focusing on continuous
shape changes working with real-world object contours were limited to within-category
shape changes; see Gillebert et al 2009; Panis et al 2008b, 2008c). Therefore, we have chosen
1500 locations on equidistant positions along the perimeter of the contour. Subsequently, we
determined the corresponding points between a pair of to-be-matched contours by applying
an alignment algorithm that minimizes the total Euclidean distances between corresponding
points and that is invariant for Euclidean similarity transformations (Marques and Abrantes
1997). By choosing equidistant points on the contour and by matching the order of the
corresponding points in the most optimal way, the deformation appeared as a smooth 2D
topological transformation.
A so-called pair of thin plate splines (PTPS) (Bookstein 1989) was used to match the
two sets of 1500 counted contour points. Appendix A contains more technical details of the
warping procedure; here we sketch the main aspects of the procedure. The PTPS procedure
disentangles the deformation into an affine transformational component before initiating
a nonlinear deformation of the image plane. By means of an iterative procedure, affine
transformations were computed by the PTPS procedure and carried out partly in each step
in order to obtain two contours for which the new PTPS affine component approached
the identity matrix. In other words, the PTPS procedure was actually used to obtain two
contours for which the affine component of the whole transformation was filtered out. The
two modified contours served as target­distracter pair for the condition NONLIN1 as they
did not involve any linear transformation between the sets of contour points (ie the two
left stimuli in each set of four, constituting one of six panels in figure 2). The modified
contour pairs within each set of four were then submitted to one custom chosen affine
transformation.(1) The affine transformations applied on the two modified contours created
two new contours that formed the second pair in the condition NONLIN1 (ie the two right-
hand stimuli in each panel of figure 2). The upper two and the lower two contours in each set
of four constituted the target­distracter pair for the condition LIN. In the condition NONLIN2
we paired the stimuli in each set that had linear and nonlinear planar shape differences (ie
upper left and bottom right, upper right and bottom left in each set of figure 2).
We started with a preliminary pilot experiment (N = 7) to develop stimulus pairs for which
3-to-7-year olds had comparable sensitivity for the LIN and NONLIN1 target­distracter
pairs. The morphing distance between NONLIN1 pairs was adapted to obtain comparable
(1) Regular affine transformations were chosen, such as a change in aspect ratio or a shear. The
affine transformations chosen for each of the six panels, from left to right and from top to bot-

sensitivity between the LIN and the NONLIN1 pairs. Especially in the doll­ostrich set, we
needed to reduce the morphing distance substantially for the NONLIN1 pairs leading to
stimuli that resemble the initial doll and ostrich stimulus from the Snodgrass and Vanderwart
set to a lesser extent. In Kayaert and Wagemans (2010), metric (LIN) and categorical
(NONLIN1) shape differences were matched for pixel dissimilarity and toddlers were much
more sensitive to the categorical shape differences. Here, by adjusting psychophysically
the absolute differences in sensitivity between the LIN and NONLIN1 pairs, we can focus
better on the differences between the developmental trends for the LIN and NONLIN1
shape differences when both trends are in each other's neighborhood with respect to overall
difficulty level.
2.3 Procedure
The task was embedded in a game-like animation which contained a colored landscape with
a large white cloud as a natural part of the scene (see figure 3). This white cloud served as
the place holder for the stimulus shapes. An experimental trial began with the presentation
of a blank cloud for 1000 ms followed by the target outline for 1000 ms presented in the
middle of the cloud. An attentional cue in the form of a blue circle enclosing the target and a
ringing sound was added during the target presentation to capture the attention of the child.
The target interval was followed by a blank cloud for 1000 ms, and, subsequently, the two
outlines (target­distracter pair) were displayed at random positions inside the cloud. The
child was instructed to select the target outline between the two alternatives and responded
by touching the chosen outline on a touch screen. The alternatives stayed on the screen until
the child responded. In the landscape an ascending hill was also pictured. A correct answer
resulted in an upward jump of a kangaroo that could reach the top of the hill in seven jumps.
An incorrect answer had no effect on the animated kangaroo. When one kangaroo reached
Development of differential shape sensitivity 129
the top, a new kangaroo in a different color started at the base of the hill. The children tried to
lead as many kangaroos as possible to the top of the hill by pointing out the correct contour
from two alternatives.
Figure 3. An example of a trial.
Each child (N = 81) received two successive blocks of seventy-two trials and a pause of 5
min in between. The target­distracter trials of existing and nonexisting objects were mixed
and presented in random order. In each set of four outlines in figure 2, there were two LIN
pairs, two NONLIN1 pairs, and two NONLIN2 pairs. Within each block, each pair from each
set was presented two times for which each outline served exactly one time as target stimulus.
Note that all outlines were equally often involved in each condition as target and distracter
because they were members of exactly one LIN pair, one NONLIN1 pair, and one NONLIN2
pair. Two presentations for six pairs of six sets makes seventy-two trials in each experimental
block.
2.4 Apparatus
The experiments were conducted on a Microtouch 3M Inc., 15-inch touch screen and a
Pentium IV 3.2 GHz computer. The experiment was programed in Eprime 1.3 and the stimuli
were created in Matlab R2007b.

3 Results
The delayed match-to-sample task was modeled by the ABX design in signal detection
theory (Macmillan and Creelman 2005). The advantage of transforming proportion-correct
responses into d' is the model-based possibility of comparing performances across different
values of a physical linear sensitivity scale. Within a subject we measured six performance
levels, corresponding to the conditions LIN, NONLIN1, and NONLIN2, for existing and
nonexisting objects, respectively.
To analyze the data we used the method of locally weighted regression or LOESS procedure
in SAS9.2 (Cleveland 1979; Cleveland and Devlin 1988; Cleveland and Grosse 1991). In all
plots, local linear fitting was used with a weight function specified by the tricube function.
This regression method uses similar assumptions as ordinary linear regression methods. To
compare the contribution of the variable KIND, we first aggregated the data of the existing
and nonexisting shapes and we applied the LOESS procedure searching for the most optimal
smoothing parameter. Subsequently, we applied the LOESS procedure for the existing and
nonexisting datasets separately by using the same smoothing parameter. We compared the
residual sum of squares for both procedures by means of an F-test. The results are displayed
in table 1.

We did not find a significant effect for the variable KIND in any kind of shape difference.
This result indicates that children treated the existing and nonexisting objects in the same
way. However, by adding this variable in the experimental design, we are more confident that
the association between contours and former acquired category representations for existing
objects could play only a minor role in the discrimination of two contours. Naturally, children
learn specific shape properties that go together with specific categories like, for instance,
the shape of a dog tail or the shape of table legs. The aim of the study was to investigate
abstract category-related shape properties like, for instance, strong concave regions in the
contour that can signal the existence of an important part for category ownership. When
perceptual learning would involve only specific category-related properties, then a difference
in sensitivity should be noticed between existing and nonexisting contour differences.
Abstract shape properties are not explicitly related to one particular category but involve
important a priori shape information before specific characteristics can be processed. When
children learn to perceive abstract shape properties more successfully, then sensitivity should
transfer to nonexisting objects as well, as indeed was the case.
In a second series of analyses we applied the LOESS procedure to conduct tests on finding
differences in sensitivity between the different sorts of shape differences. In the first column
of table 2 the two sorts of shape differences that were compared are displayed. We used the
LOESS procedure one time for the aggregated data of the two kinds of shape differences. The
same smoothing parameters were used a second time when applying the LOESS procedure
for each sort of shape difference separately.

The results indicated a significant difference between the developmental trend for the
sensitivity of LIN versus NONLIN1 shape differences and LIN versus NONLIN2 shape
differences. Sensitivity for the shape differences caused by the two kinds of nonlinear
topological transformations was not significantly different.
Figure 4. Optimal fits with the LOESS procedure. Observations are depicted with empty circles.
In figure 4 we plotted the estimated curves separately with optimal smoothing parameters
according to the LOESS procedure in SAS with default settings. A larger smoothing parameter
needs fewer free parameters for curve fitting and LOESS reduces the smoothing parameter
only on condition that more variations can be captured in correspondence with Akaike's
Information Criterion (AIC) (Akaike 1974). The AICs in figure 4 were 0.77, 1.23, and 1.73,
respectively. The fact that the optimal smoothing parameter for the LIN curve was 1
(corresponding to 100% of the observations) suggests a linear trend.
Finally, to compare the developmental age-related effects more directly, we plotted the
trends for the LIN (red), NONLIN1 (blue), and NONLIN2 (green) performances for the
aggregated data over existing and nonexisting shapes using identical smoothing parameters
(figure 5). For each curve, a two-tailed 95% confidence interval was plotted in the same color
as the trend lines. When there was no overlap between confidence intervals, the red, green,
and blue (RGB) colors were used; when two or three confidence intervals did overlap, we
used the mixture of the initial colors in the RGB color palette. The confidence intervals are
wider at both ends of the trend lines because the smoothing windows take fewer measures
into account at the endings.
For the linear topological transformations, we found nearly a linear increase in sensitivity
by age. In all plots we see that the NONLIN1 and NONLIN2 lines show a steeper increase
in sensitivity compared with the LIN line starting around 4.5 years of age and becoming
significantly different from the LIN line around 5.4 years of age. Qualitatively, the NONLIN1

and NONLIN2 developmental trends seem to have similar shape characteristics, while the
LIN developmental trend looks different. The NONLIN2 line is running more or less parallel
to the NONLIN1 line over the whole range. Indeed, the NONLIN2 line represents sensitivity
for shape differences resulting from topological transformations just like the NONLIN1 line,
and therefore it is not surprising that both curve paths are more or less parallel to each other.
Adding the linear (affine) component seemed to have introduced only a constant additive
increase in sensitivity compared with the NONLIN1 line, although they are not significantly
different from each other.
All fitted curves in figure 5 seem to level off in the older age region suggesting a ceiling
effect. However, because the curves level off at different d' levels, the scoring limits of the
task itself cannot cause the leveling off of the curves. It is rather a property of the different
kinds of shape transformations, and, more specifically, it probably indicates different limits
of extracting information from shape differences which are causing different asymptotes.
4 Discussion
We found a sharper increase in sensitivity for the nonlinear topological transformation
around 4.5 to 5 years of age compared with the linear topological transformations (affine
transformations) of the image plane. In general, the results provide evidence for an influence
from object categorization on perceptual shape processing skills during development­­that
is, children become more sensitive to the kind of shape differences that account for basic-
level distinctions, and therefore become better experts in object recognition at the basic
level of category ownership. The findings suggest that the shape differences that are useful
to differentiate objects at the basic level of category ownership become more dominant in
development. This is a plausible conclusion in the light of evolutionary functional needs
as, for example, differentiating between a snake and a cow is probably more important
than differentiating between a shorter and a longer snake. Experience in categorization and
recognition might lead to a differentiation between relevant and irrelevant properties in
shape perception at the most common level of abstraction, the basic level (Jolicoeur et al
1984). Children might learn that they become more efficient when they omit the irrelevant
shape differences (in the current study the planar linear transformations) in order to increase
their capacity for more relevant salient properties like the proposed topological deformations

that can account for some shape differences between different kinds. This view corresponds
to the view of Son et al (2008), and others before them (eg Landau et al 1988; Smith 2003), who
argued that abstraction is in part simplification and enables generalization because it requires
the removal of irrelevant information. Similarly, shape perception also involves abstraction
of shape properties. Children learn to process shape better in respect to their functional
needs by abstracting shape properties like strong concave contour segments that signal the
existence of a characteristic features. Moreover, the lack of a difference between existing
and nonexisting contours demonstrates that they have acquired a perceptual sensitivity for
generically relevant shape features, not specific object features associated with one particular
category.
Shape differences have been described by a transformational approach (Graf 2002, 2006).
However, within the transformational framework there are an infinite number of possibilities
to match two different shape configurations and the procedures differ in their criteria to
transform the space in the most optimal way. We adopted a computer vision algorithm, a
PTPS (Bookstein 1989), and applied it to human perception for the creation of two different
shape dimensions that we administered to young children in a behavioral research paradigm.
We showed in the introduction that this approach can capture many structural features
that are believed to be of importance in previous studies on visual processing. There are, of
course, many more algorithms in computer vision that might provide a shape description
that captures many important features in human perception. A challenge from a vision
science perspective is to find a particular procedure that corresponds to the human mode
of perceiving shape differences in magnitude and in shape kind. Such a procedure would
eventually lead to a parametric shape space that can serve as a mental shape space of
similarity in humans to model categorization and identification (for similarity spaces, see eg
Edelman 1998, 1999; Panis et al 2008b, 2008c; Shepard 1987; for an overview, see Palmeri and
Gauthier 2004).
In a recent study it has been shown that categorization training in a laboratory context can
affect perceived shape similarity related to specific category formations and its underlying
specific shape representations in the human lateral occipital cortex (see Gillebert et al 2009;
Panis et al 2011). The current results add to this finding that abstract shape differences
reflecting the class of overall shape properties between categories in everyday life affect
perceptual discriminability too. More often than not, visual perception and language
development are treated in separate fields of research. Nevertheless, both different aspects
of human behavior seem to be involved in a dynamic interplay. Some studies demonstrate
that different shape kinds are innate or present very early in development (eg Haaf et al 2003;
Kayaert and Wagemans 2010; Quinn 2002), but within the present experimental context
children's perceptual sensitivity seems to continue to develop between the ages of 3 and
7. Moreover, the curves fitted to the data suggested a rather abrupt increase in sensitivity
for the nonlinear transformation relevant for basic-level distinctions and a rather steady
increase for the linear transformations. This is consistent with the hypothesized relevance of
the nonlinear type of transformation for distinctions between objects belonging to different
basic-level categories, which is developmentally quite important for learning different object
classes and their names.

Appendix A
The warping algorithm that we used to create the topological transformations of the image plane,
originally formulated by Bookstein (1989), is here explained with more technical details following
the textbook by Dryden and Mardia (1998).
Consider two contours described by K equidistant points (landmarks) along their paths with T =
[t1,t2, ... ,tk]T for the first figure and Y = [y1, y2, ... , yk]T for the second one, and t and y are points
consisting of the position coordinates
xt
yt
and
xy
yy
=
1(t)
2(t)
, then the PTPS is given by the
bivariate function [1(t), 2(t)]T = c + At +W Ts(t), where s(t) = (t -t1), (t -t2), ... , (t -tK ) T
,
and (h) = h ln h if h > 0, and (h) = 0 if h = 0.
A natural thin plate spline obeys the equation

, where 11 constitutes the first K ×K elements
in the upper-left part of the inverse matrix; then W = 11Y and
cT
AT
= 21Y . The solution for the
nonlinear component W, the affine component A, and the translation component c complete the
previous bivariate function 1(t), 2(t) T
.
The bivariate function interpolates the displacement of points from a 2D vector space to a 2D
vector space minimizing the function

also called the bending energy.
A PTPS usually results in a topological transformation from a 2D vector space to a 2D vector
space. However, if many points are recruited in T and Y, 1(t), 2(t) is not necessary a function.
Some regions of the image of 1(t), 2(t) may overlap. To reduce the risk of this outcome and to cir-
cumvent unnecessary rotations, we can use the code of the shape alignment algorithm of Marques
and Abrantes (1997), allowing for an optimal initial point estimation and pose an estimation for the
set of ordered points in T and Y.
