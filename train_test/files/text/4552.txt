Introduction
Sarcoidosis is a chronic systemic granulomatous disease
characterized by accumulation of activated T lympho-
cytes and mononuclear phagocytes, which form non-case-
ating epitheloid granuloma in the affected organs.1
Although the etiology of sarcoidosis is not fully under-
stood, it has been suggested that antigens act persistently
to induce an exaggerated immune response in genetically
predisposed individuals.2
Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) converts angio-
tensin I into angiotensin II and inactivates bradykinin via
the kallikrein-kininogen system.3,4 Angiotensin II, as a
potent vasoconstrictor, is the main effector molecule of the
renin-angiotensin-system (RAS). The RAS contributes to
electrolyte homeostasis and to the regulation of blood pres-
sure in vivo.3 Dysregulation of this system can contribute to
the development of essential hypertension. Furthermore,
angiotensin II is a potent pro-inflammatory modulator that
augments the immune response.4­7 Elevated serum ACE
levels have been observed in patients with active sarcoido-
sis.8 Since serumACE levels may reflect the mass of granu-
loma in the body and are a consequence of the activation of
the monocyte-macrophage-epitheloid cell system, they are
considered to be an activity marker of the disease.9 Thus,
ACE is thought to play a key role in the pathogenesis of
sarcoidosis.
The ACE gene, located on chromosome 17q23, contains
an insertion (I)/deletion (D) polymorphism within intron 16
that may contain or lack a 250 to 287 bp repeat sequence.10
The DD genotype is associated with an approximately two-
fold higher tissue11,12 and plasma concentration of ACE
than the II genotype.10 Thus, the D allele could play a role
in the pathogenesis of sarcoidosis.
The ACE I/D polymorphism has been studied in the con-
text of sarcoidosis. However, published results on the

Abstract
Introduction: The purpose of this study was to examine whether the insertion (I) or deletion (D) of angiotensin-
converting enzyme (ACE) polymorphism confers susceptibility to sarcoidosis.
Methods: A meta-analysis on the associations between the ACE I/D polymorphism and sarcoidosis was conducted.
Results: Seventeen comparison studies consisting of 1556 cases and 2381 controls were available for the meta-analysis.
Meta-analysis revealed a significant association between the D allele and sarcoidosis (OR 1.206, 95% CI 1.049­1.386, p =
0.009). An ethnicity-specific meta-analysis of the DD+ID genotype showed an association with sarcoidosis in East Asians
(OR 1.342, 95% CI 1.041­1.729, p = 0.023). An association was found between the DD genotype of the ACE I/D poly-
morphism and sarcoidosis (OR 1.251, 95% CI 1.070­1.463, p = 0.005). Furthermore, stratification by ethnicity indicated
an association between the DD genotype and sarcoidosis in Europeans (OR = 1.215, 95% CI = 1.010­1.462, p = 0.039).
Conclusions: Our meta-analysis demonstrates that the ACE I/D polymorphism is associated with susceptibility to sar-
coidosis in European and East Asian populations.

genetic associations of the ACE I/D polymorphism are con-
troversial and inconclusive.13­27 This may be because of
small sample sizes, low statistical power, and/or clinical
heterogeneity. In order to overcome the limitations of indi-
vidual studies, resolve inconsistencies, and reduce the like-
lihood that random errors are responsible for false-positive
or false-negative associations, we employed a meta-analy-
sis to further characterize the association and to investigate
whether the ACE I/D polymorphism contributes to suscep-
tibility to sarcoidosis.
Materials and methods
Identification of eligible studies and data
extraction
A search of the literature for studies that examined the asso-
ciation between the ACE I/D polymorphism and sarcoido-
sis was conducted. We utilized the MEDLINE and
EMBASE citation indices to identify articles published
until December 2012 in which the ACE I/D polymorphism
was identified in sarcoidosis patients and controls. In addi-
tion, all references mentioned in the identified articles were
reviewed to identify studies not indexed by MEDLINE and
EMBASE. The following keywords and subject terms were
used in the search: "angiotensin-converting enzyme,"
"ACE," and "sarcoidosis." Studies were included in the
analysis if: (1) they were case-control studies, (2) contained
original data, and (3) included sufficient data to calculate
odds ratios (ORs). No language restriction was applied. We
excluded the following: (1) studies including overlapping
data; (2) studies in which the number of null and wild geno-
types or alleles could not be ascertained; (3) studies in
which family members were studied because their analysis
was based on linkage considerations; and (4) studies in
which the genotype distribution in controls was not consist-
ent with the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE), because
deviation from the HWE among controls suggests the pos-
sibility of bias during control selection or genotyping
errors. The following information was extracted from each
identified study: author, year of publication, ethnicity of the
study population, demographics, numbers of cases and con-
trols, the frequencies of the genotypes and alleles of the
ACE I/D polymorphism, and type of sarcoidosis.
Evaluation of publication bias and study
quality
The chi square test was used to determine if the observed
genotype frequencies in controls conformed to Hardy-
Weinberg (H-W) expectations. Funnel plots are often used
to detect publication bias, but they require a range of stud-
ies of varying sizes and subjective judgments; therefore, we
evaluated publication bias using Egger's linear regression
test.28 Egger's linear regression test measures funnel plot
asymmetry on a natural logarithmic scale of ORs.
Evaluation of statistical associations
We performed meta-analyses using (1) allelic contrast (D
vs. I); (2) recessive (DD vs. ID + II); (3) dominant (DD +
ID vs. II); and (4) codominant (DD vs. ID vs. II) models.
Point estimates of risks, ORs, and 95% confidence intervals
(CIs) were calculated for each study. In addition, within-
and between-study variations and heterogeneities were
assessed using Cochran's Q-statistic. Cochran's Q-statistic
test assesses the null hypothesis that all studies evaluated
the same effect. The effect of heterogeneity was quantified
using I2 with a range between 0% and 100%, representing
the proportion of between-study variability attributable to
heterogeneity rather than to chance.29 I2 values of 25%,
50%, and 75% were nominally assigned as low, moderate,
and high estimates. The fixed-effects model assumes that a
genetic factor has a similar effect on disease susceptibility
across all studies investigated and that observed variations
among studies are caused by chance alone.30 The random-
effects model assumes that different studies show substan-
tial diversity and assesses both within-study sampling error
and between-study variance.31 When study groups are
homogeneous, the two models are similar. If the study
groups lack homogeneity, the random-effects model usu-
ally provides wider CIs than the fixed-effects model. The
random-effects model is most appropriate in the presence
of significant between-study heterogeneity.31 Statistical
manipulations were undertaken using the Comprehensive
Meta-Analysis computer program (Biosta, Englewood, NJ,
USA). The power of each study was computed as the prob-
ability of detecting an association between the ACE poly-
morphism and sarcoidosis using a significance level of 0.05
and assuming an OR of 1.5 (small effect size). Power anal-
ysis was performed using the statistical program G*Power
(http://www.psycho.uni-duesseldorf.de/aap/projects/
gpower).
Results
Studies included in the meta-analysis
Fifty-two studies were identified by electronic and manual
searches, 18 of which were selected for full-text review
based on title and abstract details.13­27,32,33,41 One study was
excluded because it contained a polymorphism different
from the ACE I/D polymorphism.33 Thus, a total of 17 stud-
ies met our inclusion criteria.13­27,32,41 Two eligible studies
contained data on two different sarcoidosis groups,19,22 and
these were treated independently. Thus, a total of 19 sepa-
rate comparisons met our inclusion criteria. However, two
of the 19 separate comparisons were excluded because they
had a genotype distribution in controls that was not in
HWE.22,32 Thus, a total of 17 separate comparisons from 16
studies met our inclusion criteria. These studies consisted
of 12 European, three East Asian, one West Asian, and one
Turkish studies, and included 1556 cases and 2381 controls
Song et al. 221
in total. Selected details of the individual studies are sum-
marized in Table 1 and Figure 1. The statistical powers of
these 17 studies ranged from 18.0% to 66.2%. None of the
studies had a statistical power exceeding 80%.
Frequencies of the D allele of the ACE I/D
polymorphism in different ethnic groups
The mean frequency of the D allele of the ACE I/D poly-
morphism was 46.2% among all normal controls, and East
Asians had a lower D allele prevalence than the other ethnic
groups (34.6%).Among normal controls, the frequencies of
the D allele in East Asian, Indian, European, and Turkish
populations were 34.6, 40.1, 52.1, and 54.3%, respectively
(Table 2).
Meta-analysis of the association between
the ACE I/D polymorphism and sarcoidosis
A meta-analysis of all sarcoidosis patients and of each eth-
nic group was performed. A summary of the meta-analysis
findings of the relationship between the ACE I/D polymor-
phism and sarcoidosis is provided in Table 3. The meta-
analysis revealed a significant association between the D
allele and sarcoidosis (OR 1.206, 95% CI 1.049­1.386, p =
0.009) (Table 3, Figure 2). Stratification by ethnicity indi-
cated no association between the D allele of the ACE I/D
polymorphism and sarcoidosis in Europeans (OR 1.103,
95% CI 0.979­1.243, p = 0.107), or in East Asians (OR
1.156, 95% CI 0.965­1.384, p = 0.116) (Table 3). Analysis
using homozygote contrast showed the same D allele pat-
tern in Europeans and Asians (Table 3). However, an eth-
nicity-specific meta-analysis of the DD+ID genotype
showed an association with sarcoidosis in East Asians (OR
1.342, 95% CI 1.041­1.729, p = 0.023), but not in
Europeans (OR 1.036, 95% CI 0.845­1.270, p = 0.734)
(Table 3, Figure 3). An association was found between the
DD genotype of the ACE I/D polymorphism and sarcoido-
sis (OR 1.251, 95% CI 1.070-1.463, p = 0.005) (Table 3).
Furthermore, stratification by ethnicity indicated an asso-
ciation between the DD genotype and sarcoidosis in
Europeans (OR 1.215, 95% CI 1.010­1.462, p = 0.039),
but not in East Asians (OR 0.970, 95% CI 0.677­1.389, p
= 0.867) (Table 3, Figure 4). Associations were observed
in Europeans under the DD vs. ID model (OR 1.227, 95%
CI 1.007­1.493, p = 0.042) and in East Asians under the ID
vs. II model (OR 1.403, 95% CI 1.074­1.834, p = 0.013)
(Table 3).
Heterogeneity and publication bias
Between-study heterogeneity was identified in the meta-
analyses of the D allele and the DD+ID genotype over all
groups (Table 3). However, the heterogeneity was resolved
by an ethnicity-specific meta-analysis (Table 3). Publication
bias causes a disproportionate number of positive studies,

Discussion
ACE is expressed in a wide range of tissues, including the
kidneys, heart, lungs, vascular endothelium, skin, joints,
and testes.11,12 ACE plays an important role in RAS, angio-
tensin II conversion, directly increases vascular smooth
muscle cell contraction, and affects smooth muscle prolif-
eration, monocyte adhesion, platelet adhesion, and aggre-
gation.3,4 The ACE I/D polymorphism accounts for 47% of
the variation in ACE plasma activity,10 therefore the source
of the majority of the variation still remains to be discov-
ered. Measuring plasmatic ACE activity provides a good
indicator of activity of sarcoidosis and treatment success,
but the genetic component (I/D polymorphism) studied
here does not account for the majority of that variation,
therefore a linear association cannot and must not be
assumed. This polymorphism has been studied in connec-
tion with several diseases, including Alzheimer's disease,34
myocardial infarction,35 cerebral infarction,36 hyperten-
sion,37 and vasculitis.38 These studies reported associations
between susceptibilities to these diseases and the DD geno-
type and D allele.34­38 Considering the high serum ACE
levels observed in sarcoidosis and the role of ACE as a bio-
chemical marker of sarcoidosis, ACE may be a candidate
gene for sarcoidosis.9
In this meta-analysis, we combined evidence on the
associations between the ACE I/D polymorphism and sus-
ceptibility to sarcoidosis. Meta-analysis of the DD+ID gen-
otype (dominant model) and ID vs. II genotype (codominant

in East Asians. Furthermore, meta-analysis stratified by
ethnicity indicated an association between the DD geno-
type (recessive model) and DD vs. ID genotype (codomi-
nant model) of the ACE I/D polymorphism and sarcoidosis
in Europeans. The difference in genetic models for an asso-
ciation of the ACE I/D polymorphism and sarcoidosis
between Europeans and East Asians may be explained
partly by the ethnic difference of the D allele frequency.

I/D polymorphism and susceptibility to sarcoidosis in
Europeans as well as East Asians.
Sarcoidosis involves complex interactions between
genes and external agents. An antigen-driven process
may result in an exaggerated Th1-type immunological
response in genetically susceptible people in sarcoidosis.2
Epithelioid cells in granulomas are the main source of
ACE. The serum ACE level is increased in active sarcoido-
sis, and is a marker for monitoring sarcoidosis activity.8
ACE is expressed in T cells and activates macrophages and
augments CD4+ T-cell infiltration. Angiotensin II, which
is produced by conversion from angiotensin I by ACE,
modifies the inflammatory response. Moreover, in view of
the fact that the ACE I/D polymorphism accounts for
approximately one-half of the variance in ACE plasma lev-
els,10 it is likely that the ACE I/D polymorphism plays a
role in susceptibility to sarcoidosis.
The results of this meta-analysis differ from those of a
previous meta-analysis on the relationship between the
ACE I/D polymorphism and sarcoidosis risk performed by
Medica et al.39 The present study included four more stud-
ies,13­16 encompassing 347 more sarcoidosis patients and
345 more controls, than the Medica et al. study, and only
studies consistent with HWE were included. In addition, an
ethnicity-specific meta-analysis was conducted for
Europeans and East Asians. This meta-analysis revealed an
association between the ACE I/D polymorphism and sar-
coidosis risk in European and East Asian populations, in
contrast with the results of the previous study.
The ACE I/D polymorphism may influence the antihy-
pertensive response of ACE inhibitors (ACEI). The ACEI
has been known to be associated with better response for
hypertension in the DD genotype compared with the II gen-
otype.40 Our meta-analysis confirmed the association
between the ACE I/D polymorphism and sarcoidosis. Thus
there is a possibility that the ACEI use is associated with
better clinical improvement of sarcoidosis in patients carry-
ing the DD genotype in comparison with the II genotype.
Further evaluation is needed to clarify the relation between
the ACE I/D polymorphism and response to ACEI therapy
in patients with sarcoidosis.
The present study has some limitations that should be
considered. First, heterogeneity and confounding factors
may have distorted the analysis. Second, other ACE poly-
morphisms capable of affecting ACE activity could also be
associated with sarcoidosis. However, the limited amount
of data available prevented further meta-analysis. Third,
there are varying levels of disease severity, and the activity
level of sarcoidosis was unclear. Further research is required
to examine whether an association exists between the ACE
I/D polymorphism and the activity or clinical features of
the disease. Fourth, we included data from European, East
Asian, Indian, and Turkish patients in our meta-analysis,
but our ethnicity-associated results are applicable only to
European and East Asian ethnic groups.
In conclusion, this meta-analysis of the ACE I/D poly-
morphism, which was based on a total sample of 1556
patients and 2381 controls, demonstrated that the ACE I/D
polymorphism is associated with susceptibility to sar-
coidosis in Europeans and East Asians. Accordingly, our
findings support the notion that the ACE I/D polymor-
phism plays a role in the pathogenesis of sarcoidosis.
Larger-scale studies in populations with different ethnici-
ties are needed to explore the relationships between the
polymorphisms of the ACE gene and the pathogenesis of
sarcoidosis.
