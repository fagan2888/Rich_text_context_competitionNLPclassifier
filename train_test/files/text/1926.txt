VISUAL impairment--a condition affecting a sizable
proportion of the elderly population--profoundly in-
fluences quality of life. Although prevalence rates vary de-
pending upon the definition applied, current population
estimates indicate that about one fifth of adults over the age
of 60 experience some degree of visual impairment (Eye
Diseases Prevalence Research Group, 2004; Lighthouse
Research Institute, 1995; Pleis & Lethbridge-Çejku, 2007;
Steinmetz, 2006). These impairments often result from age-
related eye disorders that are less amenable to correction
with glasses or contact lenses, such as glaucoma, cataract,
macular degeneration, and diabetic retinopathy (Prevent
Blindness America, 2008). Although visually impaired
older adults generally retain some degree of residual vision
(Harvey, 2003; Prevent Blindness America, 2008), adjust-
ing to visual impairment after a lifetime as a sighted person
is a difficult experience (Brennan & Cardinali, 2000;
Horowitz, 2004; McKinzie, Reinhardt, & Benn, 2007), as
indicated by research examining quality of life. Visually im-
paired older adults score consistently lower than their unim-
paired peers on two common indicators of quality of life:
They rate their life satisfaction lower and are between two
and five times more likely to experience depression
(DiNuzzo, Black, Lichtenstein, & Markides, 2001; Horowitz,
2003; Horowitz, Brennan, & Reinhardt, 2005; Reinhardt,
1996). Concerns about the diminished quality of life of
visually impaired older adults are magnified by the adverse
outcomes associated with low quality of life, including
poorer physical health and increased risk of mortality
(Lyyra, Tormakangus, Read, & Rantanen, 2006; Maier &
Smith, 1999).
Although the negative effects of visual impairment on
quality of life are well documented, we know little about
the underlying mechanisms. Several mediating processes
are suggested by studies reporting that greater visual im-
pairment is associated with having more activity limitations
and fewer economic, social, and psychological resources
(Furner, Rudberg, & Cassel, 1995; McAuley et al., 2006;
Ormel et al., 1997; Reinhardt, Boerner, & Benn, 2003;
Verbrugge & Patrick, 1995; Vu, Keeffe, McCarty, & Taylor,
2005). However, few studies directly examine these associ-
ations as possible explanations for the lower quality of life
of visually impaired older adults. The handful of studies
that have explored this issue focus on a single explanation
rather than on a more comprehensive set that would allow
an assessment of their relative contributions. Existing stud-
ies also are limited by their tendency to rely on relatively
small nonrepresentative samples and cross-sectional data.
Our study addresses these limitations by using two waves
of nationally representative data to examine four potential
explanations for the negative impact of visual impairment
on quality of life, as indicated by depressive symptoms and
life satisfaction, among older adults. The explanations cen-
ter on the effect of visual impairment on activity limitations

Objectives. We examine 4 potential explanations for the lower quality of life reported by older adults with greater visual
impairment.
Methods. Using 2 waves of data from a nationally representative sample of older persons (a subsample of the Americans'
Changing Lives Study, 1986 and 1989), we run residual change regression analysis to assess the extent to which the effect
of visual impairment on quality of life, indicated by depressive symptoms and life satisfaction, is explained by changes in each
of the following: (1) activity limitations; (2) socioeconomic resources, measured as income and financial strain; (3) social
resources, indicated by social integration and perceived support; and (4) psychological resources, measured by self-efficacy.
Results. Higher levels of visual impairment are associated with more depressive symptoms and lower life satisfaction
over the 3-year period. Each hypothesized mediator plays a role in explaining the effect of visual impairment on declines
in quality of life; however, the strongest mediating effects are found for self-efficacy.
Discussion. By identifying multiple pathways through which visual impairment diminishes quality of life among older
adults, this study highlights the importance of multipronged intervention efforts.
Key Words: Coping resources--Quality of life--Visual impairment.
VISUAL IMPAIRMENT AND QUALITY OF LIFE 365
and economic, social, and psychological resources. Because
each of these processes points to a different intervention ap-
proach, clarifying our understanding of the underlying
mechanisms is a precursor to enhancing the quality of life
of visually impaired older adults.
Explanations for the negative consequences of visual
impairment for quality of life
The influence of vision loss on activity limitations is one
possible mechanism that reduces quality of life. Visual im-
pairments require a renegotiation of basic activities of daily
life, such as bathing and dressing, as well as instrumental
tasks, like housekeeping and running errands. Compared
with other common age-related conditions, visual impair-
ment more strongly impacts the ability to carry out such
activities (Furner et al., 1995; Verbrugge & Patrick, 1995).
Visually impaired older adults experience greater activity
limitations--and a steeper decline over time--than those
without visual impairment (Brennan, Su, & Horowitz,
2006; Crews & Campbell, 2001; DiNuzzo et al., 2001; West
et al., 2002). Although these patterns suggest that increases
in activity limitations may underlie the negative effect of
visual impairment on quality of life, this possibility has not
been directly examined using large samples of adults with a
wide range of visual functioning. However, studies using
small samples of adults with visual impairments suggest
that activity limitations make a modest contribution to ex-
plaining the diminished quality of life of visually impaired
adults. For example, a longitudinal study using a sample of
51 respondents diagnosed with bilateral age-related macu-
lar degeneration revealed that the strength of the association
between degree of visual impairment and depressive symp-
toms diminished with activity limitations controlled, but the
relationship remained significant (Rovner & Casten, 2002).
Visual impairment also may reduce quality of life by
challenging one's economic security. Compared with the
unimpaired, visually impaired individuals have lower in-
come and greater financial strain (Horowitz et al., 2005;
Horowitz, Brennan, & Reinhardt, 2005; Salive et al., 1992;
Tielsch et al., 1991)--factors that predict lower quality of
life (Kessler, 2010; Silver, Mulvey, & Swanson, 2002).
Socioeconomic status (SES) is typically included in stud-
ies of visual impairment and quality of life, but, to our
knowledge, it has not been examined as a potential media-
tor (e.g., Brennan et al., 2006; Furner et al., 1995). Instead,
it is treated as a control variable because financial con-
straints are a risk factor for visual impairment, as evidenced
by the observation that common eye diseases are often un-
diagnosed or untreated among people of limited means
(Horowitz et al., 2005; Horowitz, Brennan, & Reinhardt,
2005). Though receiving less attention, the opposite causal
direction also seems likely: Visual impairment may prompt
or exacerbate financial hardship. Research finds that the ef-
fect of visual impairment on quality of life remains significant
with indicators of SES controlled (Congdon, Friedman, &
Lietman, 2003; Tielsch et al., 1991). However, a rigorous
test of the mediating role of socioeconomic resources re-
quires longitudinal data in order to disentangle the likely
bidirectional relationship between visual impairment and
socioeconomic resources.
A third explanation for the negative effect of visual im-
pairment on quality of life centers on social resources. Vi-
sual impairment is associated with lower social integration
and perceived support (Mitchell; the Australian National
Health and Medical Research Council, 2001; Reinhardt
et al., 2003; Vu et al., 2005), which diminish psychological
well-being (Miech & Shanahan, 2000; Turner & Brown,
2010). The challenges of maintaining supportive social ties
are illustrated by research and personal accounts document-
ing frequent expressions of pity or sympathy toward people
with visual impairments, as well as social avoidance
(Kleege, 2005; Monbeck, 1973). However, the role of social
resources in explaining the diminished quality of life of
people with visual impairments may be modest. Providing
support for this claim, a community study of Dutch older
adults finds that social support does not account for the
greater psychological distress reported by people with vi-
sual impairments compared with their unimpaired counter-
parts (Ormel et al., 1997). This conclusion is limited,
however, by two features of the study. It relies on cross-
sectional rather than longitudinal data and does not present
analyses permitting the consideration of the unique mediating
role of social resources independent of personal resources
and activity limitations. Research employing samples lim-
ited to persons with visual impairments also suggests that
social resources account for only a modest portion of varia-
tion in depressive symptoms. For example, a longitudinal
study of 313 older adult applicants to a vision rehabilitation
agency found that greater family support was associated with
fewer depressive symptoms at baseline but was not associ-
ated with changes in depressive symptoms over a one-year
period; in contrast, greater friend support predicted a decline
in symptoms over time but was not associated with baseline
depressive symptoms (Reinhardt, Boerner, & Horowitz, 2009).
Similar to its impact on social resources, visual impair-
ment may reduce quality of life by diminishing psycholog-
ical resources such as self-efficacy--a concept referring to
the perceived ability to control one's life circumstances
(Bandura, 1997). Persons with greater visual impairments
report less control over their life circumstances and envi-
ronment, which is associated with lower quality of life
(McAuley et al., 2006; Ormel et al., 1997). Although the
cross-sectional study of Dutch older adults previously
mentioned indicates that self-efficacy partially mediates
the association between visual impairment and psycholog-
ical distress (Ormel et al., 1997), the analyses did not allow
for an examination of the explanatory contribution of this
psychological resource relative to other potential media-
tors. The explanatory capacity of self-efficacy receives
BROWN AND BARRETT

additional, albeit indirect, support from a study of older
adults seeking vision rehabilitation services (n = 584),
which finds that lower feelings of self-efficacy are associ-
ated with increased risk of subthreshold and major depres-
sion (Horowitz, Reinhardt, & Kennedy, 2005). However,
the study did not consider the independent influence of
self-efficacy, and because data were cross-sectional, it is
not clear whether declines in self-efficacy over time pro-
vide a further explanation for reductions in quality of life
among people with visual impairments.
In summary, studies documenting the negative effect of
visual impairment on activity limitations and the avail-
ability of socioeconomic, social, and psychological re-
sources point to several pathways generating diminished
quality of life among visually impaired older adults. How-
ever, few studies directly examine potential explanations
for the effect of visual impairment on quality of life, and
none of those of which we are aware examine the relative
contributions of multiple explanations. Studies also are
limited by their tendency to use data drawn from small
nonrepresentative samples comprised entirely of persons
with visual impairments (e.g., Reinhardt et al., 2009;
Rovner & Casten, 2002). Although such examinations are
useful for understanding within-group variation among
people with visual impairments, they provide limited in-
sight into the mechanisms generating diminished quality
of life among those with visual impairments--compared
with their unimpaired counterparts. Another limitation is
introduced by the reliance of most studies on cross-
sectional data (e.g., Horowitz et al., 2005; Horowitz,
Brennan, & Reinhardt, 2005; Ormel et al., 1997) that pre-
vents an examination of changes not only in quality of life
over time but also activity limitations and resources that
may influence them. Addressing these limitations, we ex-
amine four potential explanations for the diminished qual-
ity of life of visually impaired older adults using two
waves of a nationally representative sample followed over
a three-year period. We test the following three hypotheses
(with each referring to effects net of control variables):
Hypothesis 1: Compared with their less impaired coun-
terparts, older adults with greater visual impairment report
lower quality of life and greater decline in quality of life
between the two waves.
Hypothesis 2: Compared with their less impaired coun-
terparts, older adults with greater visual impairment report
more functional limitations and fewer socioeconomic, so-
cial, and psychological resources. They also report greater
increases in functional impairment and greater declines in
these resources over the two waves.
Hypothesis 3: The negative effect of visual impairment
on quality of life is partially mediated by each of the follow-
ing factors: functional limitations and socioeconomic, so-
cial, and psychological resources. Collectively, these factors
account for the negative effect of visual impairment on
quality of life.
Design and Methods
Data
Data are drawn from the first two waves (T1 and T2) of
the nationally representative Americans' Changing Lives
Study collected in 1986 and 1989 (for details, see House,
1997). Our study sample (n = 1,221) includes respondents
who were between 60 and 96 years at T1. The lower age
boundary was derived from evidence indicating that beyond
60 years the prevalence of visual impairment increases sub-
stantially among White--and particularly among African
American--older adults (Eye Diseases Prevalence Re-
search Group, 2004). The baseline study implemented a
multistage stratified area probability sampling strategy with
African Americans and individuals over 60 sampled at
twice the rate of their counterparts. The second wave had a
success rate of 73% among this sample. Although two addi-
tional waves of data were later conducted (in 1994 and
2006), we limit our analyses to the first two waves of the
study because of the large number of cases lost after T2.
More than 40% of the respondents aged 60 years or older at
T1 did not complete the T3 survey, and more than 75% did
not complete the survey in 2006.
Respondents with missing or incomplete data at T2 (n =
448) and those of race­ethnic groups other than White or
African American (n = 25) are excluded from analyses.
Omitted respondents reported significantly more depressive
symptoms, lower life satisfaction, and greater visual impair-
ment at T1 than those included in the study sample. These
patterns suggest that our results may underestimate the ef-
fects of visual impairment on quality of life.
Measures
Summary statistics for all study variables are found in
Table 1. We examine two indicators of quality of life that
have been argued to assess different dimensions: (1) depres-
sive symptoms, based on psychiatric standards of life qual-
ity and (2) life satisfaction, viewed as an overall assessment
of life experiences (Campbell, 1981; Campbell, Converse,
& Rodgers, 1976; Schuessler & Fisher, 1985). Although
conceptually similar, depressive symptoms reflect present
emotional affect, whereas life satisfaction represents more
stable and cognitive dimensions of life quality (George,
2006, 2010).
The depressive symptoms measure is an abbreviated
form of the 20-item Center for Epidemiological Studies­
Depression scale (National Center for Health Statistics,
1980; Radloff, 1977). The 11-item summated measure has
high reliability (a =.83) and produces results similar to the
full scale (National Center for Health Statistics, 1980). Re-
spondents were asked how often in the past week they felt
each of the following (with responses of hardly ever, some
of the time, or most of the time): depressed, that everything
was an effort, sleep was restless, happy, lonely, that people
VISUAL IMPAIRMENT AND QUALITY OF LIFE 367
were unfriendly, enjoyed life, poor appetite, sad that people
disliked me and that I couldn't get "going." Life satisfaction
is assessed by responses to the question, "Now please think
about your life as a whole. How satisfied are you with it?"
Responses range from not at all satisfied (1) to completely
satisfied (5). Prior research indicates that this single-item
measure is consistent with multiple-item life satisfaction
measures (Thoits & Hewitt, 2001).
Our focal independent variable is visual impairment, mea-
sured at T1. The Americans' Changing Lives Study uses
two items to assess self-reported visual impairment. The
first item asks whether respondents use a visual aid (1 = yes,
0 = no). Those answering affirmatively are asked how well
they can see even with a visual aid--not at all well, not too
well, somewhat well, quite well, or very well. Using the
same five response categories, those who do not use a visual
aid are asked how well they can see. We elected to combine
these measures because the majority of the sample (94.5%)
report using some forms of visual aid; but, we control for
the use of visual aids in all analyses (see control variables
below). Higher scores on the visual impairment indicator
reflect greater self-assessed impairment. It should be noted
that self-report measures of visual impairment used in survey
research are found to describe visual impairment less precisely
than clinical measures (for a review, see Horowitz, 2004).
However, because visual acuity is only one aspect of visual
function, self-assessments may provide a fuller understand-
ing of functional visual status (Horowitz, 2004; Smeeth &
Iliffe, 1998). We note that visual impairment was not as-
sessed at the second wave, thus preventing an examination
of change in vision over time. We also note that additional
analyses were conducted examining visual impairment as a
dichotomous variable (coded 1 for not at all well and not
too well and 0 for somewhat well, quite well, and very well
in response to the question of how well one can see). Re-
sults did not differ substantively from those using the indi-
cator capturing the full range of responses (i.e., visual
impairment predicts lower quality of life and the pattern of
mediation is similar). We retain the continuous measure to
provide a clearer understanding of the association between
degree of visual impairment and changes in quality of life.
We explore four sets of potential mediators of the effect
of visual impairment on quality of life. For each, we exam-
ine baseline (T1) levels of these factors, as well as changes
in levels from T1 to T2 (D Variable = T2 Value - T1 Value).
Higher values on the change measure reflect greater change
from T1 to T2, with positive values reflecting increases and
negative values reflecting decreases. The t tests of differ-
ences between mean values from T1 to T2, as reported in
Table 1, reveal several significant differences: On average,
income, social integration, and self-efficacy declined,
whereas financial strain increased.
Activity limitations are assessed by a standardized index
(a =.84) drawn from 12 items that gauge ability to perform
activities of daily living (ADLs) and instrumental activities
of daily living (IADLs). The ADLs include tasks related to
self-care, such as bathing, dressing, and grooming; IADLs
include tasks that one must be able to perform in order to
live independently, such as housekeeping, grocery shop-
ping, and meal preparation. Responses were none, a little,
some, a lot, or cannot do (coded 0 to 4).
Socioeconomic resources are assessed by two measures--
income and financial strain. Total household income before
taxes is a 10 category variable: less than $5,000; $5,000 to
$9,999; $10,000 to $14,999; $15,000 to $19,999; $20,000
to $24,999; $25,000 to $29,999; $30,000 to $39,999;
$40,000 to $59,999; $60,000 to $79,999; and $80,000 or
higher. Responses were coded to the midpoint of each cate-
gory, and means were imputed for missing cases (n = 311).
Financial strain is a standardized index (a =.79) using three
items assessing how difficult they found their financial situ-
ation, meeting monthly payments on bills, and their finances
working out at the end of the month. Responses ranged
from not difficult (0) to extremely difficult (4).
Social resources are measured by two indices: social
integration and perceived support. Social integration is a
standardized index (a = .74) summing responses to four
items--two tapping informal social integration (i.e., fre-
quency of visiting with friends and talking on the telephone
with friends, neighbors, or relatives) and two measuring

formal social integration (i.e., frequency of attendance at
church or club/organization meetings and frequency of vol-
unteering). Responses to each item range from never (0) to
more than once a day (5). Perceived support is a standard-
ized index (a =.72) that sums responses to six items assess-
ing the extent to which friends or relatives make the
respondent feel loved and cared for. Responses to each item
range from not at all (0) to a great deal (4).
Our psychological resource measure, self-efficacy, is a
standardized index based on the degree to which respon-
dents disagree or agree with five statements: "All in all, I
am inclined to feel that I am a failure"; "I can do just about
anything I set my mind to"; "Sometimes I feel that I am
being pushed around in life"; "There is really no way I can
solve the problems I have"; and "At times I think I am no
good at all." Responses--ranging from strongly agree (0) to
strongly disagree (3)--were coded so that higher values
reflect greater self-efficacy. The Cronbach's alpha for this
index (.69) is at the threshold of acceptability. We retain
this measure because evidence of its validity and reliability
has been reported (e.g., House, Lantz, & Herd, 2005;
Maciejewski, Prigerson, & Mazure, 2000). Providing further
support for the construct's validity, our data reveal patterns
consistent with research using other samples. Lower self-
efficacy is associated with reporting more depressive symp-
toms, lower life satisfaction, and greater visual impairment
(e.g., Ormel et al., 1997). Patterns consistent with those
observed in other samples also are found for the social distri-
bution of self-efficacy, such as lower self-efficacy among
women and those of lower SES (e.g., Turner & Roszell, 1994).
Control variables include sociodemographic characteris-
tics, use of a visual aid, chronic conditions, and baseline
measures of quality of life. Sociodemographic characteris-
tics are age (years, ranging from 60 to 96), gender (1 =
women, 0 = men), race/ethnicity (1 = African American, 0 =
White), and education (number of years of school com-
pleted, ranging from 0 to 17). The use of a visual aid is a
dichotomous variable (1 = yes, 0 = no). Chronic conditions
are indicated by a count of the following 10 conditions cur-
rently experienced: arthritis or rheumatism; lung disease;
hypertension; heart disease, heart attack, or other heart trou-
ble; diabetes or high blood sugar; cancer or malignant tu-
mors; circulation problems; stroke; fractured or broken
bones; and bladder problems/incontinence. Baseline mea-
sures of depressive symptoms and life satisfaction (col-
lected at T1) are measured using items identical to those
tapping these dimensions of quality of life at T2. An exam-
ination of the latent roots and latent vectors of a pairwise
correlation matrix including all study variables and variance
inflation factors provided no evidence of multicollinearity.
Analytic Strategy
We use residual change regression models (Allison,
1990; Kessler & Greenberg, 1981) to assess the influence of
visual impairment at T1 on changes in quality of life from
T1 to T2. In order to investigate potential explanations for
this effect, we compare the coefficient and level of signifi-
cance for visual impairment before and after the hypothe-
sized mediator is added to the model, with a reduction in the
magnitude of the effect of visual impairment on quality of
life providing support for the mediational hypothesis. We
use Sobel­Goodman tests to formally assess the extent to
which a mediator carried the influence of visual impairment
to quality of life (MacKinnon & Dwyer, 1993; Mackinnon,
Warsi, & Dwyer, 1995; Preacher & Hayes, 2004).
We present six regression models for each of the two in-
dicators of quality of life. Model 1 regresses the dependent
variables (i.e., depressive symptoms and life satisfaction at
T2) on the T1 measures of visual impairment, use of a vi-
sual aid, age, gender, race­ethnicity, education, and chronic
conditions. It also includes T1 measures of quality of life in
order to assess the influence of visual impairment on
changes in quality of life from T1 to T2. Models 2 through
5 each include a hypothesized mediator. Model 6 includes
all variables entered in previous models in order to assess
their collective role in explaining the effect of visual impair-
ment on change in quality of life.
Results
As part of our examination of whether the Sobel­Goodman
criteria for mediation are met (Mackinnon et al., 1995;
Preacher & Hayes, 2004), we conducted ordinary least
squares (OLS) regression predicting each of the hypothe-
sized mediators as a function of visual impairment, use of
a visual aid, age, gender, race­ethnicity, education, and
chronic conditions. These analyses, presented in Table 2,
reveal that visual impairment is significantly associated
with each of the following hypothesized mediators at T1:
activity limitations, income, financial strain, social integra-
tion, and self-efficacy. Visual impairment also is a signifi-
cant predictor of change fromT1 toT2 in activity limitations,
financial strain, social integration, and self-efficacy. Each
of these associations is in the expected direction: Greater
visual impairment predicts more limitations and financial
strain and fewer resources. The finding that visual impair-
ment predicts increases in financial strain is also noteworthy
because it provides support for the argument that visual im-
pairment influences financial hardship rather than simply
being a consequence of it.
Table 3 presents the results of OLS regression analyses
examining the effect of visual impairment (ba) on depres-
sive symptoms. Net of the control variables and baseline
measure of depressive symptoms, greater visual impairment
significantly predicts an increase in depressive symptoms
over the three-year period (Model 1). We note that use of a
visual aid is not significantly associated with change in de-
pressive symptoms.
VISUAL IMPAIRMENT AND QUALITY OF LIFE 369
Models 2 through 5 test our hypothesized mediators of
the influence of visual impairment on change in depressive
symptoms. Model 2 reveals that baseline levels and in-
creases in activity limitations significantly predict increases
in symptoms between the waves, and they jointly account
for about 28% of the relationship between visual impair-
ment and depressive symptoms. Additional analyses (not
presented) indicate that each accounts for about half of the
observed mediating effect. Model 3 demonstrates that
higher baseline levels and increases in financial strain are
associated with more symptoms and they collectively ex-
plain about 12% of the influence of visual impairment on

change in symptoms. Mediation tests of each economic re-
source (not shown) reveal that baseline financial strain ac-
counts for the majority of this effect. Model 4, which
examines social resources, indicates that higher baseline
levels and increases in social integration predict declines in
symptoms between waves. Separate tests show that baseline
levels and increases in social integration play nearly equal
roles in explaining the elevated symptoms of more visually
impaired older adults. Contrary to a large body of research
(e.g., Turner & Brown, 2010), we do not find that perceived
support significantly predicts depressive symptoms. How-
ever, we note that cross-sectional analyses using the first
wave (not presented) indicate that perceived support pre-
dicts depressive symptoms with the effects of visual impair-
ment, social integration, and the control variables held
constant. Of the mediators that we examined, psychological
resources play a largest role in accounting for the elevated
depressive symptoms of the visually impaired (Model 5).
Higher baseline levels and increases in self-efficacy are as-
sociated with declines in symptoms and account for about
35% of the association between visual impairment and
change in depressive symptoms. When the collective contri-
bution of the four hypothesized mediators is considered
(Model 6), the coefficient for visual impairment is reduced
by 64% and does not reach significance.
Table 4 presents the results of the regression of life satis-
faction on visual impairment. Greater visual impairment
predicts a decrease in life satisfaction from T1 to T2 (Model
1). We also note that using visual aids emerges as a signifi-
cant variable; it predicts increases in life satisfaction be-
tween the waves. Model 2 demonstrates that activity
limitations and changes in activity limitations--both signif-
icant predictors of declines in life satisfaction--explain
about 26% of the relationship between visual impairment
and change in life satisfaction, with further tests (not pre-
sented) revealing that baseline impairment plays a larger
role. Turning to economic resources, 38% of the relationship
between visual impairment and change in life satisfaction is
explained by the effect of financial strain (Model 3). Sepa-
rate mediation tests (not shown) reveal that financial strain
accounts for the largest proportion of this effect. Model 4
reveals that the positive effects of social integration and per-
ceived support and increases in social integration on life sat-
isfaction account for 33% of the effect of visual impairment
on change in life satisfaction over the three-year period.
Separate analyses (not shown) reveal near-equivalent medi-
ating effects of baseline level and change in social integra-
tion. Of the four sets of explanations that we examined, the
strongest effects are found for psychological resources. Both
initial levels and changes in self-efficacy are significant pre-
dictors of quality of life (Model 5). With self-efficacy con-
trolled, the effect of visual impairment on change in life
satisfaction declines by 61% and is no longer significant,
with further tests (not presented) revealing that nearly all of
this effect is explained by baseline level of self-efficacy. In
Model 6, which includes all variables entered in previous
models, the effect of visual impairment on change in life
satisfaction declines by 97% and fails to reach significance.

VISUAL IMPAIRMENT AND QUALITY OF LIFE 371
Discussion
Although visual impairment is a common occurrence in
later life, it is nevertheless characterized by lower quality of
life (Brennan & Cardinali, 2000; DiNuzzo et al., 2001;
Horowitz, 2003, 2004). Research has given little attention
to specific mechanisms through which visual impairment
diminishes quality of life. Furthermore, none of the studies
directly testing explanations for this relationship examine
multiple processes or employ longitudinal data. Drawing on
previous research documenting the associations of visual
impairment with activity limitations and economic, social,
and psychological resources, we examine each of these sets
of factors as a potential explanation for the lower quality of
life of visually impaired older adults. We explore these pos-
sibilities using a two-wave panel study of a nationally rep-
resentative sample of adults aged 60­96 years.
Our findings provide further evidence of the negative ef-
fect of visual impairment on quality of life and a range of
factors that influence it. Consistent with previous work and
supporting our first hypothesis, we find significantly greater
declines in quality of life, as indicated by more depressive
symptoms and lower life satisfaction, among older adults
who report a greater degree of visual impairment. Our re-
sults also support our second hypothesis. We find that expe-
riencing greater visual impairment is significantly associated
with more activity limitations and fewer socioeconomic, so-
cial, and psychological resources at baseline. In addition,
greater visual impairment significantly predicts increases in
activity limitations and financial strain and declines in so-
cial integration and self-efficacy over three years.
We elaborate on prior studies of visual impairment by
examining multiple processes that may contribute to re-
duced quality of life. The results for depressive symptoms
and life satisfaction support our third hypothesis predicting
that the negative effect of visual impairment on change in
quality of life is partially mediated by each of the following
factors: activity limitations and economic, social, and psy-
chological resources. We further hypothesized that these
factors collectively explain the negative effect of visual im-
pairment on quality of life. We find that these factors ex-
plain 64% of the effect of visual impairment on depressive
symptoms and 97% of its effect on life satisfaction. With
these four sets of factors included in the models, visual im-
pairment significantly predicts neither depressive symp-
toms nor life satisfaction.
Although we find some evidence to support each of the
four processes we examined, the results reveal that their
contributions to explaining the lower quality of life of more
visually impaired older adults, compared with their less im-
paired counterparts, vary. Self-efficacy plays the largest me-
diating role. It accounts for about 35% of the effect of visual
impairment on depressive symptoms and over 60% of the
effect on life satisfaction. Considerably smaller--though
significant--mediating effects are observed for other expla-
nations that we examined. However, the magnitude of these
effects differed for depressive symptoms and life satisfac-
tion. Our findings suggest that economic and social re-
sources play larger roles in explaining the effect of visual
impairment on more stable and cognitively based appraisals,
such as life satisfaction, compared with more emotional di-
mensions of life quality, as indicated by depressive symp-
toms. An exception is found for activity limitations, which
nearly equally account for the effects of visual impairment
on depressive symptoms and life satisfaction.
These patterns have implications for interventions aimed
at increasing the quality of life of older adults with visual
impairments. In general, our findings suggest the value of
pursuing multiple interventions that improve physical func-
tioning, economic circumstances, social involvement, and,
particularly, perceptions of control over one's life. How-
ever, they also reveal that interventions may have different
degrees of success for reducing depressive symptoms com-
pared with enhancing life satisfaction. Assessments of life
satisfaction, given their more cognitive than emotional na-
ture, may be more strongly impacted by efforts to improve
the structural features of the lives of visually impaired older
adults, such as reducing financial strain and providing op-
portunities for greater social integration. Consistent with
this conclusion, we find that use of visual aids is associated
with improvements in life satisfaction but not depressive
symptoms. Although our study suggests that improving
structural conditions is important, particularly to enhancing
life satisfaction, the findings also imply that intervention ef-
forts will be limited if they fail to consider more subjective
aspects of living with a visual impairment--particularly its
effect on one's sense of personal agency.
Our study contributes to the literature by identifying mul-
tiple pathways through which the quality of life of visually
impaired older adults may be improved; however, its limita-
tions should be noted. Although this represents the first at-
tempt (of which we are aware) to explore multiple
explanations for the visual impairment--quality of life as-
sociation using longitudinal data, our study includes only
two waves and spans just three years. Across the explana-
tions we examined, we find that in some instances, baseline
levels (i.e., of activity limitations and resources) exert stron-
ger mediating effects than do changes over the study period,
whereas in other cases, the reverse is true. These patterns
should be reexamined using data following adults over a
longer span of time. We also are limited in our ability to
assess change in visual impairment over time. Common
age-related eye disorders, such as glaucoma, cataract, and
macular degeneration, tend to be associated with a gradual
course of decline (Harvey, 2003). As a result, we may be
underestimating the extent to which visual impairment re-
duces quality of life over time. The ability to consider
changes in visual impairment also would allow for a clearer
assessment of the potentially bidirectional relationship of
visual impairment and economic resources. We find that
greater visual impairment predicts increases in financial

strain but is unable to determine whether financial strain in-
fluences degree of visual impairment.Another possible con-
cern is that our data were collected two decades ago. We do
not believe that this limitation renders our study irrelevant
for understanding the association between visual impairment
and quality of life because, while there have been some ad-
vances in the treatment of aging-related eye disorders (most
notably for the treatment of cataract; Harvey, 2003), visual
impairment remains a common problem and the use of aids
does not eliminate its negative effect on quality of life.
In addition to examining effects of visual impairment on
quality of life as they unfold over a longer time span, future
research should examine whether the strength of the effects
or underlying processes vary across segments of the elderly
population. Sources of potential variation include gender,
race­ethnicity, and SES, as well as the community-dwelling
population compared with nursing home residents; each of
these contrasts points to variation in levels of resources
to address challenges faced in later life, including visual
impairment.
