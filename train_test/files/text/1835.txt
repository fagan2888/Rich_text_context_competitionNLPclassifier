Thirty percent of people with diabetes
are undiagnosed (1), and up to 25%
already have microvascular compli-
cations at diagnosis (2). The American
Diabetes Association recommends
screening adults 45 years of age, espe-
cially those with a BMI 25 kg/m2, at
3-year intervals with a fasting plasma glu-
cose (FPG) measurement (3). However,
physicians infrequently use an FPG for
screening. For example, in a large health
maintenance organization within the Uni-
versity of Michigan health system, 184 phy-
sicians at 22 separate locations screened
5,752 (69%) of 8,286 people without dia-
betes over a 3-year period. Ninety-five per-
cent of the screening tests were random
glucose measurements, 3% were FPGs, and
2% were A1Cs (4). Random glucose levels
depend on the length of time after the pre-
vious meal and the carbohydrate content of
that meal. There is no agreement on what
random glucose values should lead to fur-
ther investigations.
Because A1C levels reflect average
glycemia during the preceding 3­ 4
months, meal issues are not a factor. To
determine what A1C level should lead to
further tests to diagnose diabetes, we ex-
amined the 1999­2004 National Health
and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES) population of those not
known to have diabetes to determine the
sensitivity and specificity with which var-
ious A1C levels identified people with
diabetes.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND
METHODS -- NHANES oversampled
African-American and Hispanic individu-
als to obtain enough data for analysis in
this minority subset. Accordingly, results
were weighted to reflect the U.S. popula-
tion. SUDAAN statistical software was
used to obtain weighted estimates that ac-
count for the complex survey design of
NHANES (5). Of the 8,881 subjects with
a 6-year weighting variable identified,
6,036 were 20 years of age or older and
6,012 had fasting blood samples drawn.
Glycated hemoglobin levels were mea-
sured by a boronate affinity high-
performance liquid chromatography
(HPLC) system and converted to A1C lev-
els (6). The normal range was 4.0­6.0%
(personal communication, Randie Little,
PhD, University of Missouri School of
Medicine, Columbia, MO). Subjects were
queried by questionnaire, and 532 were
excluded because of a previous diagnosis
of diabetes. An additional 535 subjects
were excluded due to missing question-
naire data and 10 for missing laboratory
data. The final dataset included 4,935 in-
dividuals. Those whose FPG concentra-
tions were 126 mg/dl were diagnosed
with diabetes. The results were analyzed
by a receiver operating characteristic
(ROC) curve.
RESULTS -- Of the final cohort of
4,935 subjects, 3,280 were normal (FPG
100 mg/dl), 1,485 had impaired fasting
glucose (FPG 100­125 mg/dl), and 170
had previously undiagnosed diabetes
(FPG 126 mg/dl). The relationship be-
tween A1C level and diagnosis of diabetes
is shown in Fig. 1. An A1C level of 5.8%
yielded the highest combination of sensi-
tivity (86%) and specificity (92%) in the
total population. Analyses of subsets of
these NHANES subjects revealed sensitiv-
ities of 84, 90, 84, 93, and 95% in 2,334
men, 2,601 women, 2,631 non-Hispanic
whites, 874 African Americans, and
1,295 Hispanics, respectively. Specifici-
ties were 92, 92, 93, 86, and 91%, respec-
tively. The 135 subjects who listed their
race as "other" were not analyzed sepa-
rately because of their small number.
CONCLUSIONS -- The American
Diabetes Association recommends confir-
mation of an FPG level to diagnose dia-
betes (3). Requiring confirmation (not
available in NHANES data) would de-
crease sensitivity and increase specificity.
However, an A1C level of 5.8% is consis-
tent with the results of a previous ROC
analysis on the 1988­1994 NHANES III
population utilizing an ion exchange
HPLC A1C assay (normal 5.17  0.45%
[SD]) with diabetes also diagnosed by an
FPG 126 mg/dl. They concluded that
the best screening value lay between 1
and 2 SDs above the mean (7). The two
NHANES studies relate A1C levels to the
prevalence of diabetes. Two studies have
related A1C levels to the incidence of di-
abetes. In 1,253 veterans aged 45­64
years, the 3-year incidence of diabetes (by
self-report, FPG 126 mg/dl or A1C
7.0%) at baseline A1C levels of 5.5,
5.6­6.0, and 6.1­6.9% was 0.8, 2.5, and
7.8 per 100 person-years, respectively
(8). In 2,820 French people aged 30­65
years whose baseline A1C levels were split
into deciles, the 6-year incidence of dia-
betes (diabetes drugs or FPG 126 mg/
dl) was 2.5, 5.0, and 10% in the upper
three A1C deciles of 5.7, 5.8, and 5.8­
7.1%, respectively (9).
Based on the results of these studies
relating A1C levels to both prevalent and
incident diabetes, an A1C value in a
DCCT (Diabetes Control and Complica-
tions Trial)-standardized assay (10) of
5.8% could effectively serve to identify
individuals in whom further investiga-

tions might be fruitful. Since fasting is not
necessary for A1C measurements, this ap-
proach would markedly reduce the num-
ber of people required to return for a
fasting test. Given the A1C result, both
physicians and their patients might be
more motivated to further explore the po-
tential diagnosis of diabetes.
Alternatively, an argument can be
made to utilize only A1C levels for the
diagnosis of pre-diabetes/diabetes. The
levels of glycemia that are associated with
the microvascular complications of diabe-
tes are generally agreed upon as appropri-
ate diagnostic criteria (11). In both type 1
(12­14) and type 2 (15,16) diabetic pa-
tients, these complications did not de-
velop or progress for 6­9 years when the
average A1C level was kept at 7.0%.
Supporting this relationship, when A1C
levels in three large diabetic populations
were divided into deciles, the mean value
in the first decile, in which retinopathy
increased, ranged from 6.7 to 7.5% (17).
Regarding A1C levels and pre-diabetes,
people in the DPP (Diabetes Prevention
Program) (18) with values of 6.1­6.9%
were twice as likely to progress to diabetes
as those with lower values (19).
Thus, we propose that individuals
with A1C levels measured in a DCCT-
standardized assay of 6.0% are normal,
6.1­6.9% have pre-diabetes, and 7.0%
have diabetes. Since metformin is recom-
mended for those with type 2 diabetes
(20) and in younger obese people with
pre-diabetes (19), A1C levels should be
confirmed in these patients. Alternatively,
an A1C level of 5.8% could lead to a
glucose measurement (an FPG or even an
oral glucose tolerance test). In either ap-
proach, diabetes will be diagnosed in
those at clear risk for microvascular com-
plications. Those with pre-diabetes will
be identified so that appropriate measures
can be adopted to reduce their chances of
developing diabetes.
