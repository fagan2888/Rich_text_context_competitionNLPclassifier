Introduction
Exercise is considered a safe, feasible, and effective adju-
vant therapy for people with breast cancer.1 Exercise may
reduce treatment-related side effects, the risk of breast can-
cer recurrence, and mortality and enhance health outcomes
and quality of life.1,2 For breast cancer survivors who
develop lymphedema, resistance exercise has been demon-
strated to improve symptom severity, strength, endurance,
and mobility of the affected limb, without exacerbating
lymphedema.3-5 However, breast cancer survivors face a
number of difficulties and barriers to exercise participation.
These include treatment-related side effects such as fatigue,
nausea, pain, weight gain, and depression6 as well as the
presence of uncertainty and fear toward exercise, in that it
may lead to worsening of lymphedema or its associated
symptoms.7 Lymphedema risk reduction and management

Abstract
Background. Resistance exercise is emerging as a potential adjunct therapy to aid in the management of breast cancer­
related lymphedema (BCRL). However, the mechanisms underlying the relationships between the acute and long-term
benefits of resistance exercise on BCRL are not well understood. Purpose. To examine the acute inflammatory response to
upper-body resistance exercise in women with BCRL and to compare these effects between resistance exercises involving
low, moderate, and high loads. The impact on lymphedema status and associated symptoms was also compared. Methods.
A total of 21 women, 62 ± 10 years old, with BCRL participated in the study. Participants completed low-load (15-20
repetition maximum [RM]), moderate-load (10-12 RM), and high-load (6-8 RM) exercise sessions consisting of 3 sets of 6
upper-body resistance exercises. Sessions were completed in a randomized order separated by a 7- to 10-day wash-out
period. Venous blood samples were obtained to assess markers of exercise-induced muscle damage and inflammation.
Lymphedema status was assessed using bioimpedance spectroscopy and arm circumferences, and associated symptoms
were assessed using Visual Analogue Scales for pain, heaviness, and tightness. Measurements were conducted before and
24 hours after the exercise sessions. Results. No significant changes in creatine kinase, C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, and
tumor necrosis factor- were observed following the 3 resistance exercise sessions. There were no significant changes in
arm swelling or symptom severity scores across the 3 resistance exercise conditions. Conclusions. The magnitude of acute
exercise-induced inflammation following upper-body resistance exercise in women with BCRL does not vary between
resistance exercise loads.

affected limb to reduce the risk of infection and cellulitis
occurring as a result of impaired lymphatic function.8 This
includes avoiding needles, injections, blood draws and
blood pressure cuffs, and cuts and scratches on the affected
hand and arm.9 As a result, difficulties exist in undertaking
invasive studies evaluating resistance exercise in women
with breast cancer­related lymphedema (BCRL).
Accordingly, the volume of previous research examining
the physiological effect of resistance exercise in this cohort
is limited. In addition, the mechanisms underlying the rela-
tionships between the acute and long-term benefits of resis-
tance exercise and BCRL are not well understood.
Single bouts of resistance exercise elicit muscle tissue
damage and an acute inflammatory response.10-12 The extent
of this response is affected by the mode (eccentric and/or
concentric muscular contractions), volume (total work of
the session), load (weight lifted), and intensity (extent of
neuromuscular fatigue) of resistance exercise.13-15 High-
volume and eccentric resistance exercise causes a greater
magnitude of exercise-induced muscle damage and inflam-
mation.11,16-19 This response is characterized by a tran-
sient increase in creatine kinase (CK) and inflammatory
biomarkers (eg, interleukin-6 [IL-6], tumor necrosis factor
 [TNF-], and C-reactive protein [CRP]) up to 72 hours
postexercise.11,20-24 Whereas single bouts of resistance exer-
cise cause increases in these biomarkers, chronic adaptation
to regular exercise has an anti-inflammatory effect associ-
ated with downregulation of various inflammatory bio-
markers.20,25-28 This adaptation is characterized by lower
resting levels of inflammatory biomarkers. The acute
inflammatory response to resistance exercise has been
reported in healthy trained and untrained individuals14 but
has yet to be examined in women with BCRL who have
compromised lymphatic system function. There is a percep-
tion among health professionals and patients that if resis-
tance exercise is conducted it should be prescribed at light
loads. This perception is based on the assumption (yet to be
empirically evaluated) that lighter loads elicit a lower
inflammatory response in women with BCRL. However, it
has been reported that at least in young healthy men, there
are no differences to the response of CK, IL-6, or TNF- 24
hours after upper-body resistance exercise at 4 different
loads (ranging from 50% to 110% of maximal muscular
strength; ie, 1 repetition maximum [RM]).29 At present, it is
unknown if the impaired lymphatic system of women with
BCRL prompts a different inflammatory response to vary-
ing loads of resistance exercise. The response may differ
from that in healthy adults because the lymphatic system is
implicated in cytokine production and removal. It is sug-
gested that in addition to the blood, cytokines may also
enter the lymph fluid, which can modify plasma cytokine
levels.30 Furthermore, lymphatic fluid passes through lymph
nodes, a site where immune cells are removed. As a result,
cytokine production may be modulated when components
of damaged muscle pass through lymph nodes.30 However,
it is unknown whether the excision of lymph nodes and
lymphatic fluid accumulation in BCRL may alter the
inflammatory response to exercise.
Women who develop BCRL experience impairment
within the lymphatic system, resulting in reduced or stag-
nant flow of lymph fluid.31,32 As a result of lymph stasis,
fibrosis, fat accumulation, and inflammation occur within
the affected limb.33 This impaired lymph flow results in the
buildup of protein-rich fluid, which is associated with
inflammation in the lymphadetamous limb.33-35 Ongoing
and worsening inflammatory processes of the skin, subcuta-
neous tissue, and lymphatic system also occur.36 As a result
of the pathological changes in the affected limb, it is plau-
sible that the normal inflammatory response to a bout of
upper-body resistance exercise is exacerbated or at least
altered in patients with BCRL. This may have important
implications in understanding the pathophysiology, upper-
limb rehabilitation, and prescription of optimal resistance
exercise loads for women with BCRL. Therefore, the aim of
the present study was to examine the acute inflammatory
responses to resistance exercise in women with BCRL.
Markers of exercise-induced muscle damage and inflamma-
tion (CK, CRP, IL-6, and TNF-) in women with unilateral
BCRL were evaluated after performing acute bouts of low-,
moderate-, and high-load upper-body resistance exercises.
The impact on lymphedema status and associated symp-
toms (pain, heaviness, and tightness) were also assessed.
Methods
Participants
A total of 126 women with BCRL were screened for partici-
pation in this study between August 2011 and February
2012 (Figure 1). Potential participants were identified
through referral from oncologists or physiotherapists and
existing databases of the investigators. A total of 25 women
were enrolled to participate. To be eligible, participants had
to have had a histological diagnosis of breast cancer and a
clinical diagnosis of unilateral BCRL defined as: (1) an
impedance ratio of at least 3 standard deviations (SDs)
greater than normative data;37,38 (2) a volume difference
between affected and unaffected limbs of at least 5%;38,39
and (3) a difference in circumference between affected and
unaffected limbs of at least 5%.5,38,39 Women were excluded
from participation if they had unstable lymphedema, which
was defined as receiving intensive therapy (ie, decongestive
therapy or antibiotics for infection) within the previous 3
months. Any potential participants were also excluded if
they had a musculoskeletal, cardiovascular, and/or neuro-
logical disorder that could inhibit them or place them at risk
of harm from exercising, as determined by their general
physician. This study was approved by the university's
310 Integrative Cancer Therapies 15(3)
human research ethics committee, and all participants pro-
vided written informed consent.
Experimental Design
A randomized, cross-over design was implemented in which
participants completed 3 experimental conditions separated
by a wash-out period of at least 1 week. Prior to any experi-
mental conditions, all participants completed a series of 4
familiarization sessions implemented twice weekly for a
fortnight. These sessions involved familiarizing participants
with the resistance exercises and loads performed during the
experimental conditions. The experimental conditions
involved an upper-body resistance exercise session under-
taken using: (1) low load; (2) moderate load; or (3) high
load. Sessions were completed in a randomized order as
determined by a random assignment computer program. A
series of assessments were conducted immediately prior to
and 24 hours after each of the experimental conditions.
Instructions were provided to all participants to maintain
their normal lymphedema management strategies through-
out the duration of the study. Additionally, participants were
instructed to maintain their standard diet and physical activ-
ity levels throughout the study period.
Resistance Exercise Sessions
Each of the experimental sessions involved a series of 6
standard resistance exercises targeting all the major muscle
groups in the upper body. Specifically, the exercises
Figure 1. Flow of participants throughout trial.
Cormie et al 311
included the chest press, lat pull-down, bicep curl, triceps
extension, lateral raise, and wrist curl. Three sets of each
exercise were performed in each session, whereas the load
lifted and number of repetitions completed in each set dif-
fered between the 3 experimental conditions. The low-load
trial involved sets of 15 to 20 RM (ie, load corresponding to
the maximum weight that could be lifted 15-20 times). The
moderate-load trial involved sets of 10 to 12 RM. The high-
load trial involved sets of 6 to 8 RM. These RM ranges were
estimated to represent 55% to 65%, 65% to 75%, and 80%
to 85% of the 1 RM (ie, maximal strength), respectively.40
These loading protocols have been shown to be safe for
women with BCRL3,4 and are consistent with common
resistance exercise prescriptions used in clinical practice.41
The participant's perception of exertion associated with
each of the experimental conditions was assessed using the
Rating of Perceived Exertion (RPE) Scale, which quantifies
the difficulty of the exercise session on a scale from 6 (no
exertion at all) to 20 (maximal exertion).42 Perceived toler-
ance of each exercise session was assessed using a 7-point
Likert scale, ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7
(strongly agree) in response to the statement, "I have found
the exercise session to be tolerable." All exercise sessions
were supervised by an accredited exercise physiologist.
Inflammatory Markers
Venous blood samples were collected from the nonaffected
arm by a qualified phlebotomist immediately prior to and
24 hours following the exercise sessions. Because of risk
reduction guidelines among this cohort (ie, guidelines to
minimize injections to the hand and arm), we aimed to min-
imize patient burden by allowing 24 hours between blood
withdrawals. This sampling time point (24 hours) also
allowed us to determine whether a robust and sustained
inflammatory response was induced by exercise. Samples
were assessed for CK, CRP, IL-6, and TNF- using stan-
dard techniques. CK was assessed by a commercial pathol-
ogy laboratory using the ADVIA Chemistry System
(Western Diagnostics, Perth, Western Australia). The assay
sensitivity was <1 U/L, and the precision (coefficient of
variation) was 1.5%. CRP, IL-6, and TNF- were assessed
using multiplex bead-based immunoassays on the Luminex
platform (Luminex, Austin, TX). Assays were conducted
using magnetic multiplex kits in accordance with manufac-
turer's protocol (Merck Millipore, St Charles, MO). The
sensitivity was 451 ng/mL for CRP, 0.13 pg/mL for IL-6,
and 0.23 pg/mL for TNF-. The precision was 8.8% for
CRP and IL-6 and 6.6% for TNF-.
Lymphedema Status and Associated Symptoms
The extent of swelling was determined by 2 independent
techniques: bioimpedance spectroscopy (BIS) and arm
circumferences. In accordance with the manufacturer's
guidelines for the BIS device (ImpediMed IMPTM DF50;
ImpediMed, San Diego, CA), the impedance of the extracel-
lular fluid in the affected and nonaffected arms was assessed
using a range of frequencies and compared to produce a
L-Dex score.37 Regional arm circumferences of the affected
and nonaffected arms were assessed according to established
protocols.38,43 The participant was seated with the arm
abducted at 90°; a constant tension tape was used to measure
circumferences immediately distal to the metacarpal-pha-
langeal joint and at 5-cm intervals to the base of the axilla.
Arm circumference swelling was reported as the percentage
difference in total circumference between the affected and
nonaffected arms. The severity of lymphedema symptoms
was assessed using Visual Analogue Scales (VAS) for pain,
heaviness, and tightness.44 The scales ranged from 0 (no dis-
comfort) to 10 (worst imaginable), and participants rated
both the affected and nonaffected arms.
Statistical Analyses
Summary descriptive statistics for participants' characteris-
tics included counts (and percentages) for categorical vari-
ables and means ± SDs or medians, minimum, and
maximum for continuous variables. Generalized estimating
equations (GEEs) were used to model continuous primary
outcomes (CK, CRP, TNF-, and IL-6) to determine time
(pre-exercise and 24-hours postexercise) and trial (low-,
moderate-, and high-load) effects and Time × Trial interac-
tions. GEEs were considered the most appropriate multi-
variate modeling technique. In comparison to conventional
repeated-measure techniques, GEEs incorporate all avail-
able data (including from participants with missing data at
various time points). Secondary outcomes (lymphedema
status and associated symptoms) were analyzed using
repeated-measures analysis of variance. All tests were
2-tailed, with an  level of P  .05 as the criterion for statis-
tical significance. No imputation of data was generated.
Data were analyzed using SPSS Statistics for Windows,
Version 21 (IBM SPSS, Chicago, IL).
Results
Participant Characteristics
Participants were on average 61.5 years old and had had
lymphedema for an average of 9 years (Table 1). Most par-
ticipants were either overweight or obese (91%) as deter-
mined by body mass index and had undergone previous
surgery (96%), with an average of 17 lymph nodes removed.
Between 60% and 80% of participants had had previous
radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy or were currently and/or
previously taking hormone therapy. According to the
American Physical Therapy Association lymphedema
312 Integrative Cancer Therapies 15(3)
criteria,39 41%, 18%, and 41% of participants had mild,
moderate, and severe lymphedema, respectively. Most par-
ticipants (86%) self-reported being physically active prior
to study participation. All participants maintained their
usual lymphedema self-care management, physical activ-
ity, and diet behaviors for the duration of the study. One
participant completed only the low-load trial and withdrew
from the study as a result of a change in work commit-
ments, whereas another participant did not complete the
moderate-load trial (because of unrelated health concerns).
Three participants did not complete the 24-hour assessment
after moderate-load resistance exercise. It was also not pos-
sible to perform the BIS assessments on 1 participant.
Resistance Exercise Sessions
Mean ratings of perceived exertion for the 3 exercise condi-
tions were similar. The participants rated the exercise ses-
sions between "light" and "somewhat hard" (Table 2).
Participants rated the 3 exercise conditions as equally toler-
able (Table 2). The load lifted across all 6 exercises differed
significantly between the 3 exercise conditions (low load =
31.7 ± 18.5 kg; moderate load = 40.7 ± 21.2 kg; high load =
46.9 ± 26.8 kg; P < .001 [Table 2]). Total volume-load (load
[kg] × repetitions × sets) was 1300 ± 1091 kg in the low-
load trial, 840 ± 514 kg in the moderate-load trial, and 1011
± 650 kg in the high-load trial. There were no adverse
events during participation in the resistance exercise ses-
sions, including no exacerbations of lymphedema or symp-
tom severity.
Inflammatory Markers
There was no significant interaction effect between time
and trial for CK, CRP, IL-6, and TNF- (Table 3,
Supplementary Table [available at http://ict.sagepub.com/
supplemental]). There was a trend for CK to increase (non-
significantly) 24 hours after each of the 3 exercise condi-
tions, with no significant differences between the low-,
moderate-, and high-load conditions. There were no clear
trends in terms of the impact of resistance exercise load on
CRP, IL-6, or TNF- from pre-exercise to 24 hours postex-
ercise in any of the 3 conditions. Individual responses var-
ied markedly from no change to increases and/or reductions
in CK, CRP, TNF-, and IL-6 (Figure 2).
Lymphedema Status and Associated Symptoms
No significant increases were observed in BIS or interlimb
circumference difference at any time point during the 3
exercise conditions (Table 4). BIS scores and interlimb cir-
cumference differences generally tended to decrease at 24
hours after exercise in all 3 conditions. Circumference dif-
ference decreased significantly 24 hours after low-load
resistance exercise (P = .02). There was no worsening of
symptom severity of the affected arm at any time through-
out the study. Tightness ratings of the affected arm decreased
significantly 24 hours after the high-load trial (P = .015).
Discussion
The main findings of this study were the following: (1) no
significant changes in indicators of muscle damage or

women with BCRL; (2) the acute inflammatory responses
in women with BCRL were similar across low-, moderate-,

exercise did not acutely exacerbate BCRL, regardless of the
resistance exercise load; and (4) participants reported no

observed following all 3 conditions in the present study
were modest and not clinically relevant (all changes repre-

intracellular signaling molecules involved in initiating the
inflammatory responses to exercise-induced muscle damage
and adaptation.14,30 Clinicians have been hesitant to recom-
mend resistance training (and in particular moderate to high
loads) for women with BCRL. There is a perception that
lighter-load resistance training will produce less muscle dam-
age and inflammation compared with higher-load resistance
training (eg, large increases in CK have been observed after
strenuous exercise46), and there are concerns that the inflam-
mation would exacerbate BCRL as a result of impaired lymph
flow. Furthermore, there are concerns that resistance exercise
with heavy loads may exacerbate lymphedema symptoms,
and women with BCRL are typically apprehensive about lift-
ing weights, especially at heavier loads.7 However, participa-
tion in an acute high-load resistance exercise session has
recently been demonstrated to not acutely increase swelling or
symptom severity of the affected limb in women with BCRL.3
Importantly, the current study extends these previous observa-
tions to indicate that there may be no difference in the inflam-
matory response 24 hours following participation in acute
bouts of resistance exercise involving low, moderate, or high
loads. Because inflammatory markers returned to normal
within 24 hours, there is little evidence that any clinically
important inflammation occurred. However, it is important to
note that these are preliminary observations based on a small
sample of patients who were relatively active. Higher-load
resistance exercise is known to stimulate greater morphologi-
cal and neural adaptations compared with lower loads.41,47,49
As such, these preliminary findings suggest that women with
BCRL can safely participate in moderate- to high-load resis-
tance exercise.
Resistance training­induced muscle damage and subse-
quent inflammatory responses are mediated by a range of
individual and training program variables.14,15 In the current
study, increasing the load of resistance exercise did not elicit
a significantly greater inflammatory response. Similarly, pre-
vious findings suggest that the load of upper-body resistance
exercise may not affect the magnitude of change in blood
markers of muscle damage and inflammation. Uchida et al29
compared 4 different loads of upper-body resistance exercise
(ranging from 50% to 110% of 1 RM) on various inflamma-
tory biomarkers, including CK, IL-6, and TNF- in physi-
cally trained men. Regardless of the loading protocol, no
changes in IL-6 or TNF- were observed 24 hours after exer-
cise. Uchida et al29 reported significant increases in CK 24
hours after each exercise trial; however, no difference was
observed between the different loading protocols in the mag-
nitude of CK change.29 Although there were clear differences
in the participants sampled, exercise protocols, blood sam-
pling, and measurement techniques between the previous and
current studies, the findings were consistent. These initial
findings suggest that BCRL and its associated pathology do
not alter acute inflammatory response in the 24 hours follow-
ing low-, moderate-, and high-load resistance exercise.
Although more than half of the participants had chronic
lymphedema (present for on average 9 years), our findings
suggest that symptom severity may still acutely improve
with appropriately prescribed resistance exercise. Consistent
with previous findings,50 a significant reduction in tightness
of the affected arm was observed 24 hours after a high-load
resistance exercise session. The possible mechanisms of
such benefit are unknown, but it could be speculated that
more effective hydrostatic pressure drove lymph return with
more forceful muscle actions. In addition, more forceful
muscle actions may result in favorable hormone and cyto-
kine production, affecting the tissue locally and systemi-
cally. The observation that high-load resistance exercise did
not induce significantly greater exercise-induced muscle
damage or inflammation in the present study is supported by
the subjective improvements in symptom severity of the
affected limb 24 hours after exercise. It is also important to
consider that although many of the participants in the study
were not accustomed to performing regular resistance exer-
cise, participants were generally physically active and had
undergone a 2-week familiarization protocol. Regular exer-
cise may cause a cumulative anti-inflammatory effect in
response to repeated bouts of exercise.25,51 Participants were
likely accustomed to physical activity (albeit not resistance
exercise in particular); therefore, these findings may not rep-
resent the acute inflammatory response of sedentary or less
physically active women with BCRL. However, previous
research in healthy individuals indicates that even a single
bout of eccentric exercise results in considerable protection
from muscle damage in subsequent training sessions.30
This is the first study to our knowledge that has com-
pared whether resistance exercise load influences the exer-
cise-induced inflammatory response and the potential
implications this may have for women with BCRL. We
examined various markers of exercise-induced muscle
damage and inflammation in response to varying exercise
loads. Importantly, all levels of loading (low, moderate,
and high) were equally tolerable in this sample of women
with BCRL. Nevertheless, our study was subject to several
limitations that are worthy of comment. First, our study
was limited by a relatively small sample size, which may
limit our ability to detect statistically significant differ-
ences. Second, blood samples were only assessed 24 hours
postexercise. As a result, we cannot discount that the lack
of significant increase or difference among the 3 exercise
bouts may be a result of the clearance of cytokines prior to
blood withdrawal.Although more frequent sampling would
have been preferable to demonstrate changes in cytokines
following resistance exercise (eg, Izquierdo et al19), 24
hours between blood samples was selected to alleviate
patient concerns and burden among patients with BCRL.
Additionally, systemic biomarkers were assessed, and it is
acknowledged that local responses within skeletal muscle
may differ.

Findings from the present study add to the existing body
of knowledge by establishing that acute bouts of moderate-
and high-load resistance exercise may not induce a greater
level of muscle damage or inflammation compared with
low-load resistance exercise in breast cancer survivors who
have established lymphedema. This extends previous
research demonstrating that high-load resistance exercise
does not exacerbate lymphedema or associated symptoms of
the affected limb.3,4 Data from this present study may inform
future exercise intervention studies, and given the greater
time efficiency and strength adaptation resulting from mod-
erate- to high-load resistance training,41 the efficacy of low-
load resistance exercise appears limited.41 It is well
established that a strong dose-response relationship exists
with resistance exercise load.41 Greater improvements in
muscle strength and hypertrophy, physical function, and
health-related quality of life are experienced with higher
load resistance exercise compared with low loads.47,48,52
Participants reported the same tolerability and RPE regard-
less of load, further supporting the potential appropriateness
of moderate to high loads for this population. Because regu-
lar exercise has been shown to reduce resting levels of
inflammatory cytokines in breast cancer survivors without
lymphedema,51 future studies should aim to examine changes
in chronic low-grade inflammation with longer-term (eg,
12 weeks) exercise in women with BCRL.
Conclusions
As research continues to emerge demonstrating the safety
and efficacy of resistance exercise in women with BCRL,
there remains a limited amount of research investigating
the physiological responses underlying these benefits.
Findings from the current exploratory study demonstrate
that the magnitude of exercise-induced muscle damage
and inflammation following upper-body resistance exer-
cise in women with BCRL may not be dependent on the
load of resistance exercise and that low-, moderate-, and
high-load upper-body resistance exercise may not result in
a greater 24-hour inflammatory response in individuals
with impaired lymph flow in the upper limb. Lymphedema
status and symptom severity as well as perceived tolera-
bility and exertion of resistance exercise were also not
affected by the load lifted. Given the extensive evidence
that moderate to high loads in resistance training produce
greater strength and morphological adaptations as well as
physical function and health-related quality of life com-
pared with low loads,47,48,52 this study lends further sup-
port for the prescription of moderate- to high-load exercise
for women with BCRL.
