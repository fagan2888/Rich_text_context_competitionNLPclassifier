Have Small-Group Health
Insurance Purchasing
Alliances Increased Coverage?
No, but they have produced demonstrable benefits to participating
employers and employees.
by Stephen H. Long and M. Susan Marquis
Health insurance purchasing alli-
ances (for brevity, we use the term
"alliances") are one component of
many state and national health reform plans
intended to move us toward the goal of uni-
versal coverage.1 Alliances were intended to
expand coverage by making insurance more
attractive and affordable to small employer
groups. The presence of an alliance also was
hoped to stimulate competition in the rest of
the small-group market, thereby leading to
expanded coverage outside of the alliance as
well. Previous work, based on qualitative
methods and the perceptions of key inform-
ants, suggests that alliances have not gener-
ally offered lower prices. However, some ob-
servers believe that they have had important
spillover benefits to the market as a whole.
The most important feature of alliances
that might make insurance more attractive is
permitting employers to offer their employees
a choice of plans, something that was not
practical for small groups otherwise.2 Some,
however, have questioned the importance to
employees of expanded choice, especially for
those in very small groups. The Florida alli-
ances, for example, planned to eliminate the
choice requirement for very small employers
(those with four or fewer employees).3 The
choice feature is thought to have helped small
employers offer managed care without forcing
all oftheiremployees into a single health main-
tenance organization (HMO).4 In one state the
alliance may have speeded small groups' mov-
ing from indemnity to managed care.5
Making insurance more affordable is
viewed as critical to getting more small
groups to offer coverage.6 Alliances are seen as
a means of lowering administrative costs and,
in principle, giving small groups collective
purchasing power to negotiate lower rates
from insurance carriers and health plans. The
latest information available from states that
have implemented alliances suggests that
prices inside and outside the alliances are
comparable, however.7 Hopes of lower admin-

We use data from 1993 and 1997
employer surveys to assess whether the three
largest statewide small-group health insurance
purchasing alliances--in California, Connecticut,
and Florida--increased coverage in small busi-
ness. They did not. Specifically, they did not re-
duce small-group market health insurance premi-
ums, and they did not raise small-business
health insurance offer rates. We explore and dis-
cuss some reasons why. Alliances do permit em-
ployers to offer much greater choice in the
number and types of plans; employees are found
to take advantage of this wider choice.

istrative costs have not been borne out, both
because most alliances have not attained sub-
stantial scale of operations and because they
have duplicated rather than substituted for
many of the functions performed both by
health plans and by agents and brokers.8 In
California, where the alliance negotiated with
health plans on price, it is reported that prices
in the first year were 10­15 percent below
those in the outside market, while over the
next two years price trends inside and outside
the alliance were similar. This suggests that
alliance prices in California remained below
market for the first several years. However,
recent reports suggest that pricing in Califor-
nia's alliance now merely accords to that in
the outside market. Florida appears to have
had a similar experience.9
The lack of a price advantage to purchasing
within most alliances is cited as a critical fac-
tor accounting for their low market penetra-
tion. Although some alliances grew very rap-
idly from their small base levels at first, their
ultimate market penetration has fallen far
short of initial expectations.10 Many also point
to the initial failure of some alliances to recog-
nize the important role that agents and bro-
kers play in the small-group market (or to
reimburse them adequately). Many brokers
saw the alliances as a threat to their business
and, as a result, refused to promote the alli-
ance products to employers.11 A final impedi-
ment to success for some alliances has been
limited marketing.12
Nonetheless, many observers have credited
alliances with being catalysts for change in
the small-group market overall.13 Pricing par-
ity inside and outside the alliance does not
necessarily spell failure in making insurance
more affordable. Officials in several states be-
lieve that the presence of an alliance promoted
price competition, leading to generally lower
prices for small groups. This is attributed, in
part, to the ease of comparative shopping that
the alliance provides, with its standardized
benefit packages and published rates.14 Alli-
ances also have been credited with inducing
some insurers to offer multiple benefit designs
to their small-group clients, thereby increas-
ing choice outside the alliance.15 In these
ways, the presence of an alliance may indi-
rectly lead to expanded coverage, even if the
alliance does not directly enroll a large
number of newly insured groups.
The purpose of this study is to explore
these issues in the three states with the larg-
est small-group alliances in the nation. We
use data from 1997 employer surveys that in-
terviewed both alliance participants and non-
participants. Our contribution to the litera-
ture comes from using quantitative methods
to assess the effects of several different alli-
ances in a parallel fashion. Thus, it comple-
ments the previous literature reporting re-
sults based on qualitative methods.
The Study Alliances
We studied the Health Insurance PlanofCali-
fornia (HIPC), sponsored by the California
Managed Risk Medical Insurance Board;
Health Connections, sponsored by the Con-
necticut Business and Industry Association
(CBIA); and the Florida Community Health
Purchasing Alliances (CHPA).16 The alliances
were similar in severalimportant ways, yet their
differences permit us to better generalize about
the variety of alliance designs in existence.17
All three alliances operated statewide in
1997 and were based on managed competition
principles--that is, choice of plans, stan-
dardized benefits, and annual open enroll-
ment. California offered complete employee
choice of all participating plans operating in
the employer's geographic area, which at the
time of our study included numerous HMOs
and some point-of-service (POS) plans and
preferred provider organizations (PPOs).
Connecticut offered employer choice from
among sixteen options--four insurers times
two plan types times two benefit levels--
with full employee choice encouraged. Florida
offered employer choice among all participat-
ing plans in the area but required employers
to offer at least some choice. Employee choice
was limited to those plans selected by the em-
ployer, although in fact most employers of-
fered the full array of options in their area.
Each alliance was introduced against a back-

drop of small-group reforms that guaranteed
issue of coverage and placed some rating re-
strictions on the entire small-group market,
both inside and outside the alliance.
The alliances differed greatly in their gov-
ernance. California's was a single, state-
sponsored alliance, managed by an inde-
pendent state agency that had an independent
policy-making board. Florida had eleven area
CHPAs, each a private, nonprofit organiza-
tion. The CHPAs were started with seed
money from the state government and func-
tioned under state charter and with state
agency oversight and management. The CBIA
is a private association; Health Connections is
open to all small businesses in Connecticut.
In California and Connecticut the alliance
was permitted to contract selectively with
health plans. In Florida the alliances could not
contract with plans and were required to
make available all plans that wished to be of-
fered at their market prices. In fact, most in-
surers in that state were prohibited from of-
fering different premiums based on claims
costs for groups in and out of the alliance and
could vary only the administrative costs in the
premium. Connecticut also prohibited plans
from offering different premiums to groups in
and out of the alliance. Both Connecticut and
Florida required employers to enroll through
a broker. In California, employers could enroll
through a broker or directly through the alli-
ance. California initially offered a cost advan-
tage to employers in purchasing directly, but
this was later eliminated in order to increase
brokers' cooperation with the alliance.
Study Data And Methods
We examined employment-based coverage
for alliance and nonalliance participants in
the three states using data from the 1997
Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF)
Employer Health Insurance Survey. To inves-
tigate effects of the alliance on the small-
group market as a whole, we measured
changes in the market between 1993 and 1997
in the three states and contrasted these with
changes occurring in the rest of the nation.
Our estimates for 1993 come from the Na-
tional Employer Health Insurance Survey
(NEHIS). The two surveys were comparable
in sample and measurement design, admini-
stration, and processing. General background
on these two surveys has appeared else-
where.18 The following details the specific fea-
tures unique to the present study.
n Sample. The sample frame for both sur-
veys was the Dun's Market Identifiers national
census of employment establishments.19 The
RWJF sample was supplemented by a list
sample of participants in the three states' alli-
ances. The alliance frame in each state was
stratified by geography and establishment
size; within each state, the alliance sample
was selected in proportion to the nonalliance
sample in the same stratum.20
The focus of our analysis is small employ-
ers: establishments of firms with fifty or fewer
employees. The number of small employers
interviewed in the RWJF survey was 15,059
and 18,035 in the NEHIS. The 1997 survey in-
cluded 1,433 small employers in California,
1,253 in Connecticut, and 1,422 in Florida.
Among these, 161 were selected from the list of
participants in the California HIPC, 87 from
the Health Connections list, and 149 from the
Florida CHPA's list of participants. The
number of small employers interviewed in the
NEHIS was 624 in California, 346 in Con-
necticut, and 473 in Florida.
n Measurement. We measured alliance
participation rates and the types of insurance
choices offered by alliance and nonalliance
participants in the three states in 1997.21 De-
tails about each insurance plan offered were
collected as part of the interview. For estab-
lishments that were selected from the alliance
lists, however, the plan characteristics were
measured from administrative records. Em-
ployers were classified as offering a choice of
plans if they offered two or more plans,
whether of the same or different types and
whether through the same or different carri-
ers. We also examined the number of employ-
ers offering more than one type of health in-
surance plan--defined as an HMO, POS, PPO,
or indemnity plan.22 For nonalliance partici-
pants, plan types were classified based on the

respondent's self-assessment; for alliance par-
ticipants, the plan type was defined in the
administrative record.
We compared costs facing alliance partici-
pants and nonparticipants using the premium
for single coverage for each plan offered. The
premiums were adjusted for actuarial differ-
ences in the benefits of different plans.23 We
computed an average single premium for the
establishment as the enrollee-weighted aver-
age for all of the separate plans offered.
All small employers in the three states
were asked whether they were aware of the
alliance operating in their state.24 They also
were asked whether the company consulted
an agent or broker to help in evaluating differ-
ent plans. Alliance participants consulting
brokers were asked whether the broker had
provided information about plans outside of
the alliance; nonparticipants were asked
whether their broker informed them about al-
liance plans.
We estimated the alliances' spillover effect
on the small-group market in each of the three
states by examining the change between 1993
and 1997 in the share of employers offering
insurance, the share offering a choice of plans,
and premiums for single coverage. This base-
line period was prior to the emergence of the
Connecticut and Florida alliances. The Cali-
fornia alliance started issuing policies in July
of that year, so it was unlikely to have greatly
affected the small-group market.
We used multivariate regression methods
to control for changes over the period in the
composition of small employers (industry,
size, and business age composition), in the
characteristics of their employees (share of
union, part-time, and low-wage workers),
and the nature of small-group insurance mar-
ket reforms in place in the state (guaranteed
issue for some or all products, and prohibition
against using health differences in pricing
plans). To control for unmeasured temporal
change that might affect the small-group mar-
ket, we compared the change in market char-
acteristics over time in each of the three states
with that in the small-group market in the
rest of the nation.25 This is usually called a
"difference-in-difference estimate." Our
difference-in-difference estimate for each
state accounted for any difference between
each alliance state and the rest of the nation in
the changing composition of small employers.
The difference-in-difference estimate ac-
counts for state-invariant temporal factors;
however, there may have been state-specific
changes over time unrelated to regulations
that could bias this comparison. To control
for state-specific temporal effects, we as-
sumed that these factors affected medium-
size (51­150 employees) as well as small em-
ployers in the state. We then compared the
change in outcomes over time between small
and medium-size employers in each of the
three alliance states with the change between
small and medium-size employers in the rest
of the nation. This is referred to as a "differ-
ence-in-difference-in-difference" estimate.26
Results
n Alliance participation. Each alliance had a
very low share of its state's small-group mar-
ket (Exhibit 1). Among small employers that
offered insurance as a benefit, only 2­6 per-
cent purchased it through the alliance. Em-
ployers that had offered insurance for two
years or fewer were not significantly more
likely to purchase through the alliance than
were employers that had offered insurance
longer. Therefore, the alliances do not seem to
have contributed to attracting new employers
to offer insurance. We also did not find differ-
ences in the alliance market shares among
very small employers (ten or fewer workers)
and other small employers (not shown).27
Awareness of the alliance varied consider-
ably across the three states (Exhibit 1). Only
about 40 percent of small businesses in Cali-
fornia that offered insurance reported that
they had heard about the California HIPC. In
contrast, more than three-quarters of small
employers in Connecticut that offered insur-
ance were aware of its alliance.28 Even among
those knowledgeable about the alliance, how-
ever, its market share did not exceed 10 per-
cent in any state.
The vast majority of all small businesses

offering insurance reported that they used an
agent or broker in selecting their employee
health benefits, whether or not they partici-
pated in the alliance (Exhibit 2).29 However, a
minority of employers that purchased outside
of the alliance reported that their agent pro-
vided information about the alliance product.
One-quarter or fewer of nonalliance partici-
pants in California and Florida were provided
with information about the alliance by their
agent, but the comparable figure in Connecti-
cut was almost half. In contrast, three-
quarters or more of alliance participants were
presented with information about one or
more nonalliance insurance plan options.
Selected characteristics of workers that
are related to risk--sex, age, and earnings--
did not differ between businesses that did and
did not participate in the alliance (Exhibit 2).
This suggests that alliances have not attracted
groups of greater or less health risk than the
broader small-group market.
n Choice of plans. Providing small em-
ployers with both the ability and a simple
means to offer a choice of plans is widely cited
as alliances' strongest selling point. Many em-
ployers must offer a choice if they are to par-
ticipate. Thus, it is not surprising to find that
most employers in the alliance offered a
choice, whereas few other small employers
did so (Exhibit 3). Moreover, employees in a
substantial fraction of employer groups in the
alliance exercised choice by enrolling in more
than one of the offered plans. We observe this
exercise of choice in a large number of groups,
even though the small size of many of them

would make it not surprising to find all work-
ers in a single plan. This suggests that employ-
ees have heterogeneous preferences for insur-
ance that employers cannot fully accommodate
by offering a single insurance plan.
The choice offered by the alliance typically
provided access to different types of plans
(HMO, PPO, and POS) and therefore with ac-
cess to options about restrictions on choice of
providers.30 In many groups, employees made
different enrollment choices between plan-
type options, which is further evidence that
choice provided value to employees.
Participation in an alliance greatly in-
creased employees' opportunity to enroll in an
HMO. Access to HMOs was nearly universal
for alliance participants, and a large fraction
of these groups had one or more employees
who elected the HMO option. In contrast, the
number of nonalliance employers offering an
HMO ranged between 43 percent and 57 per-
cent in the three states. The alliance may have
been a vehicle for small employers to move
more rapidly to HMOs while still providing
employees who wished a broader choice of
providers to pick an alternative type of plan.
Enrollment in HMOs among employees in
participating businesses was about twenty-
five to thirty-three percentage points higher
than enrollment among other employees (not
shown).
n Cost. Premiums for plans purchased in
the California alliance were significantly
lower than were premiums for plans offering
comparable benefits purchased outside of the
alliance, as has been found in other studies
addressing this period (Exhibit 4).31 In con-
trast, the alliances in the other two states ap-

peared to provide little cost advantage. There
was no statistically significant difference in
monthly premiums for employee coverage
whether purchased in or outside of the alli-
ance in Connecticut or Florida.
n Competitive effects on the market.
There is little evidence that any of the three
alliances had broader effects on the small-
group market in their state. Exhibit 5 shows
three key characteristics of that market--em-
ployer insurance offer rates, percentage of em-
ployers offering a choice of plans, and premi-
ums--in 1993, largely prior to the alliance
operations, and in 1997. The 1993 values are
adjusted to account for changes that occurred
between 1993 and 1997 in the composition of
employers in the state and for other market
reforms.32 Changes in offer rates in all three
states between 1993 and 1997 were small and
not statistically significant; moreover, the di-
rection of the effect was a decline in two
states (California and Connecticut). Changes
in offer rates in the three states also did not
differ significantly from those in the rest of the
nation (the "difference-in-difference" meas-
ure). Again, even the direction of change in
California and Connecticut compared with
changes occurring in the nation does not indi-
cate that the alliance increased the availability
of insurance to workers in small businesses.

The "difference-in-difference-in-difference"
measure compares changes over time in the
small-group market in the state with changes
in the mid-size market and contrasts these to
the national trends. This controls for state-
specific changes over time that affect both
small and mid-size employers. This change
measure is also small in magnitude and sug-
gests that the alliance did not lead to an ex-
pansion in coverage.
The results in Exhibit 5 also do not sup-
port the hypothesis that alliances led to more
choice in the broad market for small employ-
ers. The three measures of change are typically
small and of inconsistent sign. The only statis-
tically significant change is the increase in
choice in Florida, and this change is also sig-
nificantly greater than the increase in choice
offered in the small-group market nationally
(the difference-in-difference estimate). How-
ever, this appears to be a trend occurring in
the state rather than a factor attributable to
the alliance, as evidenced by a negative (al-
though insignificant) sign for the difference-
in-difference-in-difference measure.
Similarly, alliances do not appear to have
led to increased price competition in any of
the three states. Changes in premiums for em-
ployee-only coverage in the small-group mar-
ket in these states tended to mirror trends
nationally--as seen by the small and insignifi-
cant difference-in-difference measures.
Discussion
We hark back to the question posed in our
title: "Have alliances increased coverage?" The
answer is no--at least, not in the states and
time periods we studied, which contain the
three largest small-group alliances imple-
mented to date. These alliances encompass a
range of models, including public and private
sponsorship. Therefore, governance does not
appear to be a factor in this conclusion.
What, then, prevented these alliances from
contributing to expanded coverage? Except
for California, they did not offer insurance at
prices lower than those for comparable prod-
ucts in the broader market. The Florida and
Connecticut alliances were prohibited by law
from doing so. The California alliance aggres-
sively negotiated rates with plans, and plans
were not permitted to offer lower prices out-
side of the alliance. Despite the apparent price
advantage in the California alliance, few em-
ployers chose to participate. We believe that
this reflects the alliances' initial failure to ap-
preciate the way in which most smaller busi-
nesses purchase insurance. Many small em-
ployers rely heavily on their insurance agents
for advice, and the alliance failed to obtain the
full cooperation of brokers. Brokers' resis-
tance was also a problem confronting the Flor-
ida alliance, as evidenced by the infrequency
with which brokers presented the alliance op-
tions to customers in these states. Hence, their
growth was limited.
In contrast, the Connecticut alliance en-
deavored to develop good relationships with
agents and established an agent advisory
board to do so. We see evidence of greater
cooperation by agents in presenting the alli-
ance in Connecticut. Nonetheless, with a
product that was not less costly, the Con-
necticut alliance captured only a slightly
greater market share than did the others we
studied.
Alliances, not having achieved significant
market penetration, did not induce enough
competitive pressure on the outside market to
achieve the hoped-for spillover effects on
prices. Moreover, low market penetration
makes continued participation in the alli-
ances less attractive to insurers, thereby
threatening the alliances' long-term viability.
Withdrawal of plans is a problem that has
confronted the California and Florida alli-
ances and a factor that has led to the closing of
the Florida alliance altogether.
We rephrase our question to ask, "Can alli-
ances increase coverage?" What would con-
stitute a more favorable set of circumstances?
The ability to engage in selective contracting
is a necessary condition to offering lower
prices, but it is unlikely to be sufficient to
expand coverage if alliances cannot attract
greater market share. Growth might be faster
and last longer with full broker cooperation.

number of regulatory mechanisms that would
encourage the growth of alliances, including
requiring that offerers in the small-group
market also offer through the alliance, or re-
quiring that small-group coverage only be of-
fered through the alliance.33 Such options
could firm up the alliance's position in the
existing market. However, without substan-
tial subsidy support to enhance employees'
demand for coverage, major coverage expan-
sion seems unlikely. Most states that intro-
duced alliances did so during debate about
national health care reform and expected that
subsidies or mandates would be a component
of reform. Thus, they did not expect alliances
alone to solve the problem of the uninsured.
Although we conclude that voluntary alli-
ances are unlikely to expand coverage in the
small-group market, they have produced de-
monstrable benefits to employers that partici-
pate. Their employees have much greater
choice in the number and types of plans avail-
able to them and take advantage of this
choice. Alliance participants also moved to
managed care more rapidly than did other
small groups. This may have allowed partici-
pating employers to reap the cost savings af-
forded by managed care earlier than their coun-
terparts in the broader market, and without the
disadvantage of restrictingallof theiremployees
to a single highly managed care option.

prompted by concerns about adverse selection;
however, the alliances also argued that for small
groups the availability of expanded product

tage now operates the California alliance. The
CBIA has sponsored pooled purchasing of life
and health insurance for a wider range of em-
ployer sizes since 1946. The Florida alliance was
closed in summer 2000. In an earlier study we
examined a much broader set of pooled purchas-
ing arrangements for firms of all sizes, in con-
trast to the present study, which is limited to
small businesses participating in three specific
alliances. See S.H. Long and M.S. Marquis,
"Pooled Purchasing: Who Are the Players?"
Health Affairs (July/Aug 1999): 105­111.

based on our own direct contact with the alli-
ances and on several references, including the
Institute for Health Policy Solutions Web site,
ihps.org/chpglist.html (all); Ross, "Health Insur-
ance Purchasing Cooperatives"(CA, FL); Wicks
et al., Barriers (CA, FL); and Yegian et al., "The
Health Insurance Plan of California."
18. A summary is found in M.S. Marquis and S.H.
Long, "Trends in Managed Care and Managed
Competition, 1993­1997," Health Affairs (Nov/Dec
1999): 75­88. For details of the 1997 RWJF sur-
vey, see 1997 Employer Health Insurance Survey: Final
Methodology Report (Research Triangle Park, N.C.:
Research Triangle Institute, 1998); and P.
Kemper et al., "The Design of the Community
Tracking Study: A Longitudinal Study of Health
System Change and Its Effects on People," Inquiry

19. The sample frame included employers with at
least one employee; self-employed individuals
with no employees were excluded.
20. The weights for the 1997 survey adjusted for the
probability of sampling from multiple frames
(the Dun's list and the alliance list) for alliance
participants.
21. Participation rates are for groups with 1­50 em-
ployees. The Florida alliance was also open to
self-employed individuals with no employees,
which comprised a substantial share of partici-
pants. They are excluded from our measures.
22. The alliances offered indemnity plans to out-of-
state employees only; however, many non-
alliance participants offered indemnity plans.
23. The actuarial value is the ratio of the expected
plan benefit payments to the expenditures for a
standardized population.
24. The question was, "Was your company aware
that as a small employer it could purchase health
insurance coverage for employees through the
[relevant alliance]?"
25. This includes medical cost inflation. The premi-
ums for 1993 and 1997 are not adjusted for gen-
eral increases in price, which therefore would be
represented in the simple change for each alli-
ance state but is controlled for in the difference-
in-difference estimate. It also includes any
changes in the generosity of plans over time. The
premiums in our time-series analysis are not ad-
justed for actuarial differences in plans because
we do not have actuarial values for the 1993
plans. Therefore, we assume that changes in ac-
tuarial values that occur over time are similar
nationwide.

27. Others have reported that the Florida alliance
did attract a large number of "microgroups" with
one or two persons to the group insurance mar-
ket that previously would not have been able to
participate in the group insurance market. See,
for example, M.A. Hall and E. Wicks, "An Evalu-
ation of Florida's Small-Group Health Insurance
Reform Laws" (Winston-Salem, N.C.: Wake
Forest University School of Medicine, 1999). Our
survey did not include the self-employed with no
employees, however, which comprise the one-
person groups.
28. The CBIA sold health insurance to trade associa-
tion members for many years prior to estab-
lishing the Health Connections alliance for small
businesses. It is possible that some small em-
ployers in Connecticut were aware of the asso-
ciation plan and so reported awareness of the
alliance.
29. In Connecticut and Florida, alliance participants
are required to purchase through an agent or
broker. Reported use of a broker by alliance par-
ticipants in these states may be less than 100
percent if the survey responses reflect use of a
broker to help evaluate options, rather than sim-
ply who sold the product.
30. In the period of our study, the California alliance
included HMO, PPO, and POS options. How-
ever, subsequently all PPOs and most POS plans
withdrew. The Florida alliance included HMO
and PPO plans, whereas the Connecticut alli-
ance offered a choice among several HMO and
POS plans.

fornia"; and Buchmueller, "Managed Competi-
tion."
32. The adjusted values are predicted values from
the multivariate regression for employers with
the characteristics of those in the state in 1997
and for market reform characteristics set to the
state's 1997 values, as if they were observed in the
year in question.
