Context: Twin studies suggest that conduct disorder
(CD) is under substantial genetic influence, which is stron-
ger for aggressive than for nonaggressive symptoms. Stud-
ies of migrating populations offer an alternative strategy
for separating environmental and genetic influences on
psychiatric disorders.
Objectives: To examine variation in the prevalence of
CD associated with migration from Mexico to the United
States and to determine whether this variation is similar
for aggressive and nonaggressive CD symptoms and symp-
tom profiles.
Design: The prevalences of CD, different types of CD
symptoms, and CD symptom profiles were compared
across 3 generations of people of Mexican origin with in-
creasing levels of exposure to American culture: fami-
lies of origin of migrants (residing in Mexico), children
of Mexican migrants raised in the United States, and Mexi-
can-American children of US-born parents.
Setting: General population surveys conducted in Mexico
and the United States using the same diagnostic inter-
view.
Participants: Adults aged 18 to 44 years in the house-
hold population of Mexico and the household popula-
tion of people of Mexican descent in the United States.
Main Outcome Measures: Conduct disorder crite-
ria, assessed using the World Mental Health version of
the Composite International Diagnostic Interview.
Results: Compared with the risk in families of origin of
migrants, risk of CD was lower in the general popula-
tion of Mexico (odds ratio [OR],0.54; 95% CI, 0.19-
1.51), higher in children of Mexican-born immigrants who
were raised in the United States (OR,4.12; 95% CI, 1.47-
11.52), and higher still in Mexican-American children
of US-born parents (OR,7.64; 95% CI, 3.20-18.27). The
association with migration was markedly weaker for ag-
gressive than for nonaggressive symptoms.
Conclusions: The prevalence of CD increases dramati-
cally across generations of the Mexican-origin popula-
tion after migration to the United States. This increase
is of larger magnitude for nonaggressive than for aggres-
sive symptoms, consistent with the suggestion that non-
aggressive symptoms are more strongly influenced by en-
vironmental factors than are aggressive symptoms.

CONDUCT DISORDER (CD) IS
defined in the DSM-IV1 by
persistent patterns of
child or adolescent behav-
ior involving aggression
or other violations of age-appropriate
norms that cause significant clinical im-
pairment. Children who meet criteria for
CD are at high risk for substance use dis-
orders2 and high school dropout3 as ado-
lescents and unemployment, incarcera-
tion, and early mortality as adults.4-6
Conduct disorder is also a strong predic-
tor of a broad range of adult psychiatric
disorders, including other impulse con-
trol disorders, such as intermittent explo-
sive disorder, substance use disorders, and
internalizing disorders (eg, major depres-
sion and generalized anxiety disorder).7,8
Recent nationally representative studies in
the United States have estimated the life-
time prevalence of CD to be 9.5%, based
on retrospective self-reports of adults aged
18 to 44 years,9 and the past-year preva-
lence to be 2.1%, based on parental re-
ports on children aged 8 to 15 years.10
A large body of literature11-13 on behav-
ioral genetics aims to identify environ-
mental and genetic influences on CD.
Comparisons of concordance between
monozygotic and dizygotic twins suggest
that approximately 50% of population vari-
ability in CD symptoms is attributable to
inherited liability, with significant com-
ponents of risk attributable to both shared
and unshared environmental factors.14,15

Genetic and environmental influences may differ across
CD symptoms. Some studies16,17 report stronger herita-
bility and weaker environmental influence for aggres-
sive symptoms (eg, cruelty to others and fighting with a
weapon) than for nonaggressive symptoms (eg, stealing
without confrontation and truancy). Although there are
significant exceptions to this finding,18 a recent meta-
analysis19 estimated that genetic factors account for 65%
of population variation in aggressive symptoms and 48%
of population variation in nonaggressive symptoms.
Migration provides an alternative strategy for sepa-
rating genetic and environmental influences on CD.20,21
Populations that migrate alter their environmental con-
ditions without altering their genetic composition. Vari-
ability in the risk for a disorder associated with migra-
tion from one country to another indicates an
environmental influence.22 Epidemiologic compari-
sons23 of immigrant-sending countries in the Caribbean
and immigrant-receiving countries in Europe have found
higher risk for psychotic disorders in the receiving coun-
tries, consistent with a hypothesized environmental in-
fluence on these disorders. In the United States, large dif-
ferences associated with United States vs foreign nativity
have been found24,25 in risk for mood, anxiety, and sub-
stance use disorders for some, but not all, immigrant
groups. A study26 of Puerto Ricans found no significant
differences in disruptive behaviors between samples of
children in San Juan, Puerto Rico, and the South Bronx,
New York.
In the present study, we examined variation across im-
migrant generations in CD symptoms in a transnational
sample of people of Mexican origin in Mexico and the
United States, the largest sustained international labor
migration in the world today. Differences in CD symp-
toms were examined dimensionally, according to symp-
tom counts, and categorically, according to symptom pro-
files. This study is unique in migration studies in
psychiatry because it included representative samples on
both sides of the border, assessments using the same struc-
tured interview, and the ability to distinguish sub-
samples representative of successive generations with in-
creasing exposure to American culture, from families of
origin in Mexico to descendants of US-born Mexican-
Americans in the United States. We addressed 2 ques-
tions. First, to what extent does the prevalence of CD vary
across immigrant generations in this population? Sec-
ond, are differences in prevalence across immigrant gen-
erations consistent for aggressive and nonaggressive symp-
toms? We hypothesized that, because of differences in
heritability, there would be less variation in the preva-
lence of aggressive than nonaggressive symptoms.
METHODS
SAMPLE
Data came from surveys conducted in Mexico and the United
States using the same face-to-face interview, the World Men-
tal Health version of the Composite International Diagnostic
Interview (WMH-CIDI).27 The Mexico survey, the Mexican Na-
tional Comorbidity Survey (MNCS),28 is a stratified, multi-
stage area probability sample of household residents in Mexico
aged 18 to 65 years living in communities of at least 2500 people.
A total of 5782 respondents were interviewed between Sep-
tember 1, 2001, and May 31, 2002. The response rate was 76.6%.
Data on the Mexican-origin population in the United States were
obtained from 2 component surveys of the Collaborative Psy-
chiatric Epidemiology Surveys (CPES),29 the National Comor-
bidity Survey Replication (NCS-R),30 and the National Latino
and Asian American Study (NLAAS).31 The NCS-R is a strati-
fied, multistage area probability sample of the English-
speaking household population of the continental United
States.32 The NLAAS was based on the same sampling frame as
the NCS-R, with supplements to increase representation of the
survey's target ethnic groups, including monolingual Spanish
speakers.31,33 Spanish-language interviews in the NLAAS used
the same translation of the diagnostic interview as the MNCS.
The NCS-R was conducted from February 1, 2001, through April
30, 2003, and had a 70.9% response rate; the NLAAS was con-
ducted from May 1, 2002, through December 31, 2003, and
had a 75.5% response rate for the Latino sample. A total of 1442
respondents in the CPES were of Mexican origin.
To reduce the impact of recall bias, the sample was re-
stricted to respondents younger than 45 years. The resulting
sample comprised 1736 MNCS respondents and 927 CPES re-
spondents (268 from the NCS-R and 659 from the NLAAS).
DEFINITIONS OF MIGRANT GENERATION
The MNCS respondents were asked whether they had ever mi-
grated to the United States and whether they had a member of
their immediate family (Miembro de la familia nuclear o inme-
diata) living in the United States. Respondents to the CPES were
asked their country of birth, the nativity (United States vs other)
of their parents, and, if they were born outside the United States,
the age at which they arrived in the United States. Using this
information, the sample was divided into 4 groups based on
their migration history, the presence of migrants in their im-
mediate family, and the nativity (Mexico vs United States) of
their parents. Definitions of the 4 groups and the sample sizes
originating from each survey are presented in Table 1.
Group 1, Mexicans in nonmigrant households, is composed
of MNCS respondents with no history of migration or a member
of their immediate family living in the United States. Group 2,
Mexicans from migrant households who spent their childhood
(at least through age 15 years) in Mexico, is composed of MNCS
respondents who had a family member living in the United States
or had themselves previously lived in the United States and CPES
respondentswhowereborninMexicoandmigratedtotheUnited
States after age 15 years. Immigrants who migrated after age 15
years were included in this group because their early childhood
and the majority of their period of risk for CD symptoms oc-
curredinMexico.Group3,childrenofMexican-bornparentswho
were raised in the United States before age 15 years, is composed
of CPES respondents who were born in Mexico and arrived in
the United States at age 15 years or earlier or were born in the
United States to 2 Mexican-born parents. Group 4 is composed
of Mexican-Americans born in the United States with 1 or more
US-born parents.
Comparisons between these 4 groups, adjusted for age and
sex, were specified to test study hypotheses regarding associa-
tions of migration with CD and CD symptoms. Group 2, which
represents the families of origin of Mexican migrants in
the United States, was specified as the reference group. Differ-
ences between group 2 and group 1 indicate household-level
migrant selection, ie, differences between individuals in mi-
grant vs nonmigrant households in Mexico.34 Differences
between groups 2, 3, and 4 indicate potential influences of
migration.

ASSESSMENT
The CD module of the WMH-CIDI assesses 15 CD symptoms
and additional information required to establish a DSM-IV di-
agnosis, ie, impairment, clustering of symptoms within a 12-
month period, and age at symptom onset. A clinical validity
study35 in an adolescent sample found excellent sensitivity (96.8)
and specificity (98.7) for the diagnosis of CD compared with a
structured clinical interview. Studies of the NCS-R (adult)
sample have shown strong associations of the WMH-CIDI di-
agnosis of CD with established demographic correlates, in-
cluding male sex, low educational attainment,36 urban resi-
dence, and divorce.9 Moreover, NCS-R respondents who met
DSM-IV CD criteria are more likely than other respondents to
have a broad range of other psychiatric disorders, including
anxiety, mood, substance use, and impulse control disorders.9
Diagnoses of CD in the present study refer to a history of CD
in childhood.
Information from the CD assessment was used to identify
respondents who met DSM-IV criteria for CD and respon-
dents who met the symptom count criteria (3 symptoms) re-
gardless of whether they met the additional DSM-IV criteria.
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
The sample design variables for the combined MNCS/CPES used
the primary stratum and primary sampling unit identification
codes and the sampling weight variables developed by the sample
design team at the Institute for Social Research, including the
integrated CPES sampling design and weight variable devel-
oped to account for the overlapping coverage of Mexican-
Americans by the NCS-R and NLAAS.29,37,38 Sampling stratifi-
cation variables were modified to ensure that codes used for
the CPES and MNCS components did not overlap.39 Sampling
weights reflect adjustments for unequal selection and re-
sponse probabilities as well as poststratification adjustments
to enhance the representativeness of weighted inferences with
respect to contemporaneous national census estimates of tar-
get population sizes. An additional rescaling factor was ap-
plied to the sampling weights in the cross-national data set so
that the weighted sample sizes would reflect the relative sizes
of the Mexican-origin target populations in Mexico and the
United States, enhancing the suitability of the weights for use
in design-based analyses involving the full population as well
as population subgroups.38,40
Associations between migrant generation and CD outcomes,
with statistical adjustment for age and sex, were estimated using
theappropriatelogisticregressionmodelusingtheSUDAANsoft-
ware package to correct standard errors for survey design ef-
fects.41 Binary outcomes, eg, presence of DSM-IV CD, were ex-
amined using binary logistic regression models, symptom counts
wereexaminedusingorderedlogisticregressionmodels,andpoly-
tomous outcomes, eg, CD profiles, were examined using multi-
nomial logistic regression models. Latent class analysis was con-
ducted with the Mplus software package.42
RESULTS
Table 2 shows the age and sex distribution of the sample.
Members of group 3 were slightly younger than those of
the other groups.
The prevalence of CD symptoms in the entire sample
ranged from 0.1% (forced sex) to 12.8% (truancy)
(Table 3).Threeormoresymptomswerepresentin11.5%
of the sample, and 2.0% met DSM-IV criteria for CD. There
was a strong pattern of higher symptom prevalence in
groups 3 and 4 relative to groups 1 and 2, with differences
in prevalence reaching statistical significance for 12 of the
15 symptoms. Symptom prevalence was at least twice as
common among group 4 compared with group 2 for all but
3 symptoms and was frequently much larger in group 4.
For instance, respondents in group 4 were more than 13
timesaslikelytoendorsedamagingpropertyandmorethan
9 times as likely to endorse stealing without confronta-
tion as respondents in group 2. The 3 symptoms for which
this difference in prevalence was less than 2-fold were all
aggressivesymptoms(crueltytoanimals,stealingwithcon-
frontation, and forced sex). Forced sex was endorsed very
rarely in this sample (n=3).
The prevalence of 3 or more symptoms and DSM-IV
CD similarly increased across these groups. Respon-
dents in group 4 were more than 5 times as likely to have
3 or more symptoms and more than 7 times as likely to
have DSM-IV CD as were respondents in group 2.
The pattern of increasing risk for CD was confirmed
in logistic regression models for having 3 or more CD

symptoms or meeting DSM-IV CD criteria, with statis-
tical adjustment for age and sex (Table 4). In these
models, group 2 was specified as the reference group
because this group represented the families of origin
of US migrants and thus was the appropriate point of
comparison for subsequent generations. Members of
group 2 were more likely to have both outcomes com-
pared with Mexicans from nonmigrant families (group
1), although this difference did not reach statistical
significance for DSM-IV CD. Compared with group 2,
risk for both outcomes was higher in group 3 (odds
ratio [OR],3.28 and 4.12) and higher still in group 4
(OR,9.66 and 7.64).
Ordered multinomial regression models were speci-
fied to examine differences in the number of symptoms
across the migration groups, with statistical adjustment
for age and sex (Table 4). When all symptoms were con-
sidered together, there was a strong relationship be-
tween migrant group and CD symptoms, with risk in-
creasing across generations. Note that the confidence
intervals for the ORs associated with groups 3 and 4 (rela-
tive to group 2) do not overlap.
To examine associations of migrant generation with
different types of symptoms, separate ordered logistic re-
gression models were specified for counts of aggressive
and nonaggressive symptoms. Migration is significantly
associated with both types of symptoms, but the asso-
ciation is weaker for aggressive than for nonaggressive
symptoms. The ORs relating risk for aggressive symp-
toms in groups 3 and 4 to those in group 2 were 1.51
and 3.07 for aggressive symptoms and 3.45 and 10.50
for nonaggressive symptoms.

Respondents were then classified into 4 mutually ex-
clusive CD profiles based on the presence of aggressive
vs nonaggressive symptoms: (1) no-CD, no CD symp-
toms; (2) aggressive, 1 or more aggressive symptoms and
no nonaggressive symptoms; (3) nonaggressive, 1 or more
nonaggressive symptoms and no aggressive symptoms;
and (4) combined, 1 or more of both aggressive and non-
aggressive symptoms. On the basis of this categorical
scheme, the contrast between aggressive and other CD
classes is even more pronounced (bottom 3 rows of
Table 4). There were strong associations between mi-
grant group and both the nonaggressive and combined
CD profiles, with increasing risk in groups 3 and 4 rela-
tive to group 2. However, there was no significant dif-
ference in risk for the aggressive profile in group 3 or 4
relative to group 2. Note that here too, group 2 is at higher
risk for all 3 CD classes relative to group 1, significantly
so for the aggressive and combined classes.
ADDITIONAL ANALYSIS: EMPIRICALLY
DERIVED CLASSES
To identify subtypes of CD on the basis of empirically de-
rived symptom configurations, we estimated latent class
models. The best-fitting model according to model fit in-
dices included 4 latent classes. Model fit statistics for la-
tent class models with 2 through 5 classes are presented
intheeTable(http://www.archgenpsychiatry.com).Theen-
tropy of the 4-class model was 0.898, above the threshold
of 0.8 recommended for modeling associations between la-
tent class assignments and auxiliary covariates.43
Table 5 shows the prevalence of each CD symptom
in each of the 4 classes identified by latent class analy-
sis. The first class (no CD) was characterized by low preva-
lence of all 15 symptoms. The second class (rule breaking/
deceit) was characterized by high prevalence of rule
breaking and theft/deceit symptoms and low prevalence
of most aggressive symptoms. The third class (aggressive)
was characterized by high prevalence of aggressive and
low prevalence of all other symptoms. The fourth class
(severe) was characterized by high prevalence on all symp-
toms. Respondents in the severe class were more severe
in having a higher prevalence of symptoms characteris-
tic of the rule-breaking/deceit and aggressive classes, as
well as having a high prevalence of destructive symp-
toms (fire setting, damage to property) and breaking and
entering, which are uncommon in the other classes.
No respondents in the no-CD class had 3 or more
symptoms. In the 2 intermediate classes, rule-breaking/
deceit and aggression, the prevalence of 3 or more symp-
toms was high at 53.3% and 40.8% respectively; the preva-
lence of DSM-IV CD was 7.9% and 5.5% respectively. All
respondents in the severe class endorsed 3 or more symp-
toms, and 40.4% met criteria for DSM-IV CD.
The prevalence of the no-CD class decreased sharply
across the migrant groups from 86.7% in group 2 to 38.6%
in group 4 (bottom rows of Table 5). The increase was
not evenly distributed across the 3 remaining classes. The
prevalence of the rule-breaking/deceit and of severe classes
increased dramatically across groups, and the preva-
lence of the aggressive class increased slightly, from 2.4%
in group 2 to 3.3% in group 4.
This pattern of association between migrant group and
latent class membership was sustained with adjustment
for age and sex (Table 6). The strength of this associa-
tion was modest for the aggressive class: compared with
group 2 (families of origin of migrants), risk for being
in the aggressive class was not significantly elevated in
group 3 but was elevated in group 4 (OR,3.55; 95% CI,
1.28-9.88). Associations between migration and the other
2 classes were much stronger. Compared with group 2,
the ORs associated with being in the rule-breaking/
deceit or severe classes were 3.55 and 6.08, respec-
tively, in group 3 and 10.73 and 29.43, respectively, in
group 4. Differences between group 3 and group 4 were
statistically significant.

aAll models include statistical adjustment for age and sex. Risk for having 3 or more CD symptoms and DSM-IV CD was analyzed using binary logistic
regression models. Symptom counts were examined using ordered logistic regression models, with 0, 1, 2, and 3 or more symptoms as the ordered outcomes;
0 symptoms is the reference group. Symptom profiles were defined a priori as follows: (1) no-CD, 0 CD symptoms; (2) aggressive, 1 or more aggressive
symptoms and no nonaggressive symptoms; (3) nonaggressive, 1 or more nonaggressive symptoms and no aggressive symptoms; and (4) combined, 1 or more
of both aggressive and nonaggressive symptoms. Associations between migrant group and profile were estimated in a multinomial regression, with no-CD as the
reference group. Group 1 consisted of Mexicans in nonmigrant households; group 2, Mexicans from migrant households who spent their childhood through age
15 years in Mexico; group 3, children of Mexican-born parents who were raised in the United States before age 15 years; and group 4, children of 1 or more
US-born parents.

COMMENT
This study has several unique strengths. Data were col-
lected in both the sending and host countries using the
same survey instrument, and information was available
to identify subsamples representing families of mi-
grants in Mexico and successive generations of Mexican-
Americans in the United States. The ability to account
for migrant selection bias34,44 by identifying families of
migrants in Mexico (group 2) turned out to be particu-
larly important because respondents from these fami-
lies were more likely to report having had CD symp-
toms than were respondents in families without migrants
(group 1). Had we not made this distinction and simply
compared Mexican-Americans in the United States with
the general Mexican population, the increase in risk for
CD associated with migration to the United States would
have appeared larger. Selection effects were minimized,
although not eliminated, by including individuals who
migrated at age 16 years or older and return migrants in

the Mexico group. In addition, differences between chil-
dren of migrants raised in the United States (group 3)
and those of US-born parents (group 4) suggest that risk
continues to increase within the US population, inde-
pendent of possible migrant selection effects.
The results suggest that there is a large difference in
risk for CD between Mexicans in Mexico and people of
Mexican descent in the United States. Only 2% of people
in families of migrants (group 2) met DSM-IV criteria for
CD; 11.5% of US-born Mexican-Americans with at least
1 US-born parent (group 4) met these criteria. The preva-
lence of CD in group 4 was close to that in the non­
Mexican-American, US-born sample of the CPES of 10.6%.
Adjusting for age and sex, the odds of CD were 7.64 times
as high in group 4 as they were in group 2. This is a dra-
matic increase in risk for one of the most serious child-
hood psychiatric disorders. The fact that this increase in
risk occurred across generations within a migrating popu-
lation strongly suggests the influence of early childhood
environmental conditions in the United States. The find-
ing highlights the importance of identifying environ-
mental factors that are potentially modifiable and may
offer opportunities to reduce the prevalence of CD in the
United States.
The increase in risk for CD in the United States is par-
ticularly concerning because of the strong relationship
of CD in childhood with a wide range of adverse life events
in adolescence and adulthood, as well as most forms of
adult psychopathologic disorders.9,45,46 In fact, CD may
be an indicator of influences that affect not only child-
hood psychiatric disorders but also contribute to differ-
ences in risk for later mood, anxiety, and substance use
disorders between immigrants and US-born individuals
that have been observed in studies of Mexican-Ameri-
cans and some other immigrant groups in the United
States.24,47-50
Convergent evidence from analysis of symptom counts
and symptom profiles suggests that differences associ-
ated with migration are weaker for aggressive symp-
toms than for nonaggressive symptoms. In the analysis
of symptom counts, aggressive and nonaggressive symp-
toms were significantly higher in groups 3 and 4 rela-
tive to group 2, but the association was much stronger
for nonaggressive symptoms than for aggressive symp-
toms. A limitation of the analysis of symptom counts is
that no distinction is made between "pure" and "mixed"
symptom profiles. When classes of CD were defined on
the basis of the a priori distinction between aggressive
and nonaggressive symptoms, there was a strong asso-
ciation of migration with the nonaggressive and com-
bined types of CD profile and no association of migra-
tion with the aggression-only profile. Similarly, analysis
of the empirically derived latent classes found much stron-
ger associations with migration for the rule-breaking/
deceit and severe latent classes than for the aggressive
latent class.
These findings are consistent with hypothesized dif-
ferences in the extent of genetic influence on different
types of CD symptoms. If, as twin studies suggest,19 ag-
gressive symptoms are more strongly influenced by ge-
netic factors compared with nonaggressive symptoms, we
would expect to find the pattern of results observed in
this study, that is, a much smaller intergenerational change
in aggressive than in nonaggressive symptoms. These data
do not allow us to quantify the heritability of either type
of symptom, and the results should not be interpreted
as evidence that aggressivity is predominantly genetic.
Rather, this study provides confirmation of the findings
from twin studies regarding the relative contribution of
environmental and genetic factors to different types of
symptoms using different methods. In contrast with twin
studies, inferences based on this study do not depend on
the equal environments assumption. In addition, the range
of variation in environment is greater in this study than
in twin studies, which are generally limited to a single
country or region.
The difference in association with migration be-
tween aggressive and nonaggressive symptoms was larger
in the analysis of CD profiles than in the analysis of symp-
tom counts. One potential explanation for this pattern
is that aggressive behaviors that occur along with other
CD symptoms are more likely to be situational, that is,
contextually normative or premeditated,51,52 and there-
fore more influenced by environmental factors than ag-
gressive behaviors that occur in isolation from other CD
symptoms. For instance, adolescents who are more likely
to break rules may, through that rule breaking, get into
situations or relationships in which aggressive behav-
iors are more common, such as drug trafficking or gang
activity. There is some empirical support for a distinc-
tion between aggressive and nonaggressive CD53,54 (with
the former uniquely associated with emotional dysregu-
lation) that may help explain these differences.
Evidence of environmental influences on risk for CD
does not rule out the possibility that there are inherited
liabilities that are triggered or suppressed by environmen-
tal conditions.55-57 Twin studies of substance use,58 smok-
ing,59 and externalizing behaviors60 have found that, in
settingsinwhichtheprevalenceoftheseoutcomesishigher,
their heritability is greater. For instance, there might be
an inherited liability to CD common to Mexico and the
United States that is more frequently expressed in the
United States because of environmental influences. This
pattern would suggest that CD among Mexican-
Americans in the United States would be concentrated
among offspring of migrants with liability--expressed or
not--to CD. Alternatively, there could be distinct inher-
ited liabilities to CD in the 2 environments. This pattern
would suggest that CD would be heritable within both
populations but not heritable between migrants and their
offspring. Family studies with follow-up of migrants on
both sides of the border are needed to examine these al-
ternative models.
Although the dramatic increase in CD symptoms across
generations within this migrant population implicates en-
vironmental influences, specification of the particular en-
vironmental factors remains elusive. The environmen-
tal changes experienced by migrating populations are
comprehensive, involving virtually all aspects of social
institutions, identity, family relationships, language, and
diet. Generations of researchers have focused on the dis-
tinctive social circumstances of immigrants. In the 1920s,
Faris and Dunham61(pp8-9) observed a configuration of so-
cial conditions among immigrant groups living in ur-

ban areas of Chicago that they suggested led to increas-
ing risk for juvenile delinquency as well as substance use
and mental disorder. The authors believed that immi-
grant parents were marginalized from mainstream cul-
ture, while their children were caught between their cul-
ture of origin, to which they often felt little connection,
and their host culture, which was likely to reject them.
Similar explanations in terms of differential accultura-
tion62 and discrimination63,64 have been proposed in re-
cent studies for observations of increased risk for men-
tal disorders in children of immigrants relative to their
parents.
Observation of the increase in risk for psychiatric dis-
orders among descendants of migrants in terms of ex-
periences distinctive to migrant communities would sug-
gest that risk is particularly high in these communities
relative to more established populations that do not share
these circumstances. However, epidemiologic evidence
does not support this prediction. Differences among eth-
nic groups in the United States are much smaller than
are differences between immigrants and US-born indi-
viduals, and members of ethnic minorities tend to have
lower rather than higher risk for most psychiatric disor-
ders.65,66 An alternative explanation for the observed
changes across immigrant generations is that immi-
grants in the United States share the same cultural and
social conditions that account for high risk for psychi-
atric disorders in the United States relative to immi-
grants' countries of origin.67 This explanation implies that
differences observed across migrant generations are due
to influences on the US population as a whole that con-
tribute to large cross-national differences in disorder
prevalence.
The association between migration and CD symp-
toms in this sample should not be generalized across
migrant groups. Bird and colleagues26 did not find dif-
ferences in disruptive behaviors between samples of
Puerto Rican children on the island and in the South
Bronx. However, in that study, parental acculturation
was related to disruptive behavior in both samples.68
Other studies24,47 have found that the association
between US nativity and psychopathologic characteris-
tics differ between the Mexican and Puerto Rican
populations.
Results of the present study should be interpreted in
light of its reliance on retrospective reporting of CD symp-
toms and other DSM-IV criteria by adults, a method
known to result in underestimates of prevalence due to
failures of recall.69,70 To minimize the impact of recall er-
rors, the sample was limited to respondents younger than
45 years, but this restriction is unlikely to fully correct
for recall errors. Recall errors bias estimates of the preva-
lence of CD downward but would also affect estimates
of the relative risk of CD if recall accuracy is associated
with migration. Results of tests for statistical interac-
tions between age and migrant group were not signifi-
cant in any of the models.
A second potential limitation arises from the reliance
on contemporaneous samples of generational groups
rather than the samples drawn from actual multigenera-
tional families. This is a common method in migration
studies, but the assumption that these groups represent
biologically connected successive generations may not
be accurate. However, the validity of this assumption is
supported by the consistency in the finding that Mexican-
born immigrants to the United States have lower risk for
psychiatric disorders compared with the US-born Mexi-
can-American population from the early 1980s71 through
the early 2000s.72
International migration across societies presents a valu-
able opportunity for biobehavioral research to advance
understanding of the interplay between environments and
gene expression in the etiology of CD and other com-
plex psychiatric disorders. Although migration studies
lack the mathematical formalism that underlies the quan-
titative estimation of trait heritability in twin studies, they
provide valuable insight into the role of environmental
factors in the etiology of disease.73 In this study, com-
parisons across representative samples of successive gen-
erations within a migrating population suggest that the
environmental influence on CD is large but restricted to
certain subtypes of the disorder. Future studies may be
able to identify the specific genetic and environmental
factors involved in this complex epidemiologic shift in
psychiatric morbidity, particularly if they include samples
of migrant families with members in both the sending
and receiving communities.
