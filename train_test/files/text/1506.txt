Abstract
Background: Current US surveillance data provide estimates of diabetes using laboratory tests at
the national level as well as self-reported data at the state level. Self-reported diabetes prevalence
may be biased because respondents may not be aware of their risk status. Our objective was to
estimate the prevalence of diagnosed and undiagnosed diabetes by state.
Methods: We estimated undiagnosed diabetes prevalence as a function of a set of health system
and sociodemographic variables using a logistic regression in the National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey (2003-2006). We applied this relationship to identical variables from the
Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (2003-2007) to estimate state-level prevalence of
undiagnosed diabetes by age group and sex. We assumed that those who report being diagnosed
with diabetes in both surveys are truly diabetic.
Results: The prevalence of diabetes in the U.S. was 13.7% among men and 11.7% among women
 30 years. Age-standardized diabetes prevalence was highest in Mississippi, West Virginia,
Louisiana, Texas, South Carolina, Alabama, and Georgia (15.8 to 16.6% for men and 12.4 to 14.8%
for women). Vermont, Minnesota, Montana, and Colorado had the lowest prevalence (11.0 to
12.2% for men and 7.3 to 8.4% for women). Men in all states had higher diabetes prevalence than
women. The absolute prevalence of undiagnosed diabetes, as a percent of total population, was
highest in New Mexico, Texas, Florida, and California (3.5 to 3.7 percentage points) and lowest in
Montana, Oklahoma, Oregon, Alaska, Vermont, Utah, Washington, and Hawaii (2.1 to 3 percentage
points). Among those with no established diabetes diagnosis, being obese, being Hispanic, not
having insurance and being  60 years old were significantly associated with a higher risk of having
undiagnosed diabetes.
Conclusion: Diabetes prevalence is highest in the Southern and Appalachian states and lowest in
the Midwest and the Northeast. Better diabetes diagnosis is needed in a number of states.

Background
Diabetes Mellitus is the sixth leading cause of death in the
United States (U.S.), accounting for approximately
70,000 annual deaths. Age-standardized adult diabetes
death rates across U.S. states ranged from approximately 2
per 10,000 people in Arizona and Florida to 4.5 to 5 in
West Virginia and the District of Columbia (D.C.) [1].
There may be two reasons for this large variation: First,
there may be variation in diabetes prevalence across states
due to differences in risk factors for diabetes. For example,
the prevalence of obesity in a number of Southern states
is almost 60% higher than Colorado, where obesity is
lowest [2]. Second, there may be differences across states
in diagnosis and treatment of diabetes or of cardiovascu-
lar risks among diabetics. Reliable information on diag-
nosed and undiagnosed diabetes prevalence at the state
level is important because states are important adminis-
trative units for funding and implementing programs that
influence diagnosis and treatment.
Currently, the only source of information on diabetes
prevalence at the state level is the Behavioral Risk Factor
Surveillance System (BRFSS), a state-representative tele-
phone survey. However, the BRFSS data are based on self-
reports and do not provide estimates of undiagnosed dia-
betes. The National Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey (NHANES) uses laboratory measurements and
provides estimates of diagnosed and undiagnosed diabe-
tes, but is representative only at the national level. In this
study, we combined data from NHANES and BRFSS to
estimate diabetes prevalence and diagnosis at the state
level. Our results provide information for state diabetes
prevention and control programs, and our methods can
be used for regular low-cost monitoring of diabetes at the
state level.
Methods
Data Sources
NHANES uses a complex multistage stratified clustered
probability design to measure health and nutrition char-
acteristics of a nationally representative sample of the
civilian non-institutionalized population aged two
months and older. NHANES includes an in-person inter-
view and a subsequent physical examination and meas-
urement component in a mobile examination clinic
(MEC) or at home for those unable to visit the MEC. We
used NHANES data from 2003 to 2006. The response
rates for the household interviews were 80% for 2003-
2004 and 79% for 2005-2006. The corresponding
response rates for the medical examination after the
household interview were 95 to 96%.
Each interviewed participant was randomly assigned to
either a morning or afternoon/evening MEC session. Sub-
jects  20 years old assigned to the morning session were
asked to fast for 8 to 24 hours, with the exception of those
on insulin or those who were excluded for other safety
reasons. The NHANES MEC and fasting sample weights
account for exclusion, non-response, and inappropriate
fasting time. Additional information on NHANES design
and methods, including on diabetes measurement, is
available elsewhere [3,4] and online http://www.cdc.gov/
nchs/nhanes.htm.
The BRFSS is an annual cross-sectional telephone health
survey. Currently, the survey is conducted in all 50 states
and the District of Columbia using random-digit dialing
to obtain a state-representative sample of the civilian,
non-institutionalized population aged 18 and over. In
2003, the response rate among eligible subjects who
answered the phone was 77%. Additional information on
the design is available elsewhere [5,6] and online http://
www.cdc.gov/brfss.
We included adults aged 30 and older in NHANES and
BRFSS who had answered the self-reported diabetes ques-
tion, which asked if they had ever been told by a health
professional that they had diabetes. The response rate for
this question was more than 99.8% in both surveys. We
did not include younger participants because diabetes
prevalence is relatively low in these ages.
Statistical Analysis
Consistent with previous analyses [4], we defined total
diabetes as either having answered yes to the diabetes
diagnosis question: "Other than during pregnancy, have
you ever been told by a doctor or health professional that
you have diabetes or sugar diabetes?" or having a fasting
plasma glucose (FPG) level of  126 mg/dL. We used FPG
because it is used to define diabetes by the American Dia-
betes Association [7].
We used data from NHANES, which is representative at
the national but not at the state level, to characterize the
relationship between undiagnosed diabetes status
(defined as FPG  126 mg/dL) and a set of health system,
sociodemographic, and risk factor variables listed in Table
1 using a logistic regression. These variables were selected
a priori based on their potential association with diabetes
prevalence. We excluded education from the primary list
of predictors as including it did not improve the fit of the
model. In addition, 50.2% of observations in NHANES
were missing either smoking or insurance status or both.
We used a missing indicator to include these observations
in the regression model. The regression incorporated
appropriate sampling weights.
We estimated the individual-level probability of having
diabetes in BRFSS 2003-2007 in two steps: First, partici-
pants who had answered "yes" to the diabetes diagnosis
question were, by definition, assigned a probability of 1.0
for having diabetes. Second, the probability of having

undiagnosed diabetes (i.e., FPG  126 mg/dL) for those
who answered "no" to this question was estimated using
the coefficients of the logistic regression fit on the
NHANES dataset. Estimates of diabetes prevalence and
diabetes diagnosis by age, sex, and state were obtained
from the BRFSS using appropriate sample weights. The
difference between total diabetes and self-reported diabe-
tes is undiagnosed diabetes. In separate analyses, we used
linear regressions to model the relationship between FPG
as a continuous variable and self-reported diabetes diag-
nosis, medication use, and the health system, sociodemo-
graphic, and risk factor variables in Table 1 (results for
continuous FPG analysis are available from authors by
request). We used STATA version 10 for all analyses (Stata-
Corp Texas). We present the results in two age groups: 30-
59 and  60 years.
Results
The national prevalence of diabetes among US adults  30
years was 13.7% (95% Confidence Interval 12.0%,
15.4%) for men and 11.7% (CI95 10.4%, 13.0%) for
women in the pooled 2003-2006 NHANES. Nationally,
approximately 32% of all diabetes cases in 2003-2006
were undiagnosed, a percentage that has changed little
since 1999-2002 [4].
Regression results
Among those who answered "no" to having been diag-
nosed with diabetes, being male and being older was asso-
ciated with a higher probability of having diabetes (Table
1). The effect of age on diabetes risk was largest in those
60 to 69 years old and declined slightly in those  70 years
old, consistent with the available evidence on the age
association of blood glucose [8]. Overweight and obesity
were associated with higher prevalence of undiagnosed
diabetes, with obese participants (body mass index, BMI
 30 kg/m2) having 4.29 times (95% CI 2.25, 8.17) the
odds of having undiagnosed diabetes compared to nor-
mal weight. After controlling for all other factors, Hispan-
ics had twice (95% CI 1.07, 3.83) the odds of having
undiagnosed diabetes compared to whites, and the unin-
sured had 1.58 (95% CI 0.83, 3.02) times the odds com-
pared to insured subjects.
We evaluated the performance of the prediction model
using both internal and external validations. For internal
validation, we applied the regression coefficients to
NHANES 2003-2006 observations (i.e., the same data
used in estimating the regression model) to predict diabe-
tes prevalence. The differences between the predicted and
actual diabetes prevalence for different age, sex, and race
groups were on average 0.5 percentage points and at most
8.4 percentage points. The Pearson correlation coefficient
for the observed and predicted diabetes prevalence for dif-
ferent age, sex, and race groups was 0.98. For external val-
idation, we applied the coefficients of regressions
estimated using the 2003- 2006 rounds to the same varia-
bles in pooled data from two previous rounds of NHANES
(1999-2000 and 2001-2002). The observed-predicted dif-
ferences for individual age, sex, and race groups were at
the extreme slightly worse than those in the internal vali-
dation; specifically, the 60- to 69-year-old males from
"other race" had a 20 percentage point discrepancy. This
may, however, be because the composition of this race
changed between the two surveys. The Pearson correlation
coefficient for the observed and predicted diabetes preva-
lence for different age, sex, and race groups was 0.93. On
average, the predicted prevalence was 0.1 percentage
points higher than the actual prevalence (versus 0.5 lower
percentage points in the internal validation).
National-level prevalence of diabetes and undiagnosed
diabetes
The predicted national prevalence of diabetes in 2003-
2007 was 14.4% (14.3%, 14.5%) for men and 11.4%
(11.3%, 11.5%) in women. The only sociodemographic
group whose predicted and measured prevalences were
significantly different was the uninsured, who had an
actual prevalence of 9.2% (7.4%, 11.0%) but a predicted
prevalence of 11.9% (11.6%, 12.2%).
State-level prevalence of diabetes and undiagnosed
diabetes
In 2003-2007, the lowest prevalence of diabetes was in
the Midwest and the Northeast, including Vermont, Min-
nesota, Montana, and Colorado, with age-standardized
prevalence ranging from 11.0% to 12.2% for men and
7.3% to 8.4% for women (Figure 1 and Table 2). Diabetes
prevalence was highest in the primarily Southern and
Appalachian states, including Mississippi, West Virginia,
Louisiana, Texas, South Carolina, Alabama, and Georgia,
where age-standardized diabetes prevalence was 15.8% to
16.6% for men and 12.4% to 14.8% for women, i.e.,
approximately 30% to 51% higher for men and 48% to
103% higher for women than the states with lowest prev-
alence. The same geographic pattern was observed when
younger (30-59 years) and older ( 60 years) age groups
were considered separately. The Spearman rank correla-
tion coefficient of state diabetes prevalence and mean BMI
was 0.53 for men and 0.76 for women [2].
Age-standardized diabetes prevalence was higher in men
than women in all states, with the largest differences in
Minnesota, Colorado, Utah, and Maine, where prevalence
in men was 32% to 38% higher than among women. The
smallest male-female differences were in the District of
Columbia, Mississippi, West Virginia, and Louisiana,
ranging from 6% to 18% (Figures 1 and 2). Men also had
higher prevalence of diabetes than women in almost all
states and age groups, except in the youngest ages (30 to

* The standard error of prevalence reported here reflects the sampling variability in the predicted diabetes prevalence but does not incorporate
uncertainty in the prediction model (parameter uncertainty and stochastic uncertainty) and thus is an underestimate for the true standard error of
prevalence. We included the parameter and stochastic uncertainty of the modeling using a multiple imputation approach in which we imputed the
prevalence of diabetes for individuals who did not report having diabetes 10 times, drawing from a multivariate Normal distribution of the
coefficients and drawing randomly from the posterior binomial distribution of revalence. We estimated the standard error of the national
prevalence of diabetes using these 10 imputed values for each sex. The standard error was 0.8% for men and 0.4% for women, which is almost 10
times larger than the standard error estimated using sampling uncertainty only.

39 years), consistent with the national results from
NHANES. Correlation between age-standardized male
and female diabetes prevalence across states was 0.9.
The age-standardized proportions of diabetes cases that
were undiagnosed were lowest in Hawaii, Mississippi,
West Virginia, and Tennessee (19.5% to 21.4% of all dia-
betes cases) and highest in Minnesota, Montana, North
Dakota, Vermont, and Colorado (31.1% to 33.3% of all
diabetes cases). However, the absolute prevalence of undi-
agnosed diabetes, as a percent of total population, was
highest in New Mexico, Texas, Florida, and California (3.5
to 3.7 percentage points) and lowest in Montana, Okla-
homa, Oregon, Alaska, Vermont, Utah, Washington, and
Hawaii (2.1 to 3.0 percentage points) (see Table 3 for
prevalence of undiagnosed diabetes by age, sex, race and
insurance status).
Men in all states had higher proportions of undiagnosed
diabetes than women, with the male-female difference in
undiagnosed proportion being largest in Hawaii, Missis-
sippi, District of Columbia, West Virginia, and Idaho,
where the proportion undiagnosed among men was
34.1% to 39.0% higher than among women. The male-
female diagnosis disparity was smallest in Colorado,
Pennsylvania, Vermont, and Minnesota (12.9% to
19.8%). When stratified on race, the proportion of cases
undiagnosed was highest among Hispanics (33%), fol-
lowed by whites (28%) and blacks (19%), and it was low-
est in the residual group of "other races" (6%). One-third
of diabetes cases were undiagnosed in participants who
did not have insurance compared to one-fourth among
insured Americans.
Discussion
To our knowledge, this is the first study to estimate the
total prevalence of diabetes and the proportion of diabe-
tes that is undiagnosed at the state level. The Southern and
Appalachian states had the highest diabetes prevalence,
with Mississippi faring the worst. The Northern plains, the
Northeast and the Midwest had the lowest prevalence.
Prevalence of undiagnosed diabetes also varied across
states, with Southern states and California having the
highest prevalence. The proportion of undiagnosed diabe-
tes was higher in men, Hispanics, and the uninsured com-
pared to women, whites and insured. In fact, one-half of

diabetes cases were undiagnosed in uninsured Hispanic
men. These findings are important for the development
and implementation of adequate state programs to pre-
vent, diagnose, and control diabetes.
This analysis has a number of limitations: First, although
our regression models included important sociodemo-
graphic, lifestyle, and health system determinants of dia-
betes risk and diagnosis, there are other factors that affect
diabetes, such as diet and quality of care [9,10]. For
instance, we were unable to include family history of dia-
betes, physical activity, alcohol use and specific dietary
risk factors of diabetes [11-14] in the model because
BRFSS does not include a sufficiently detailed dietary
questionnaire or any questions on family history of diabe-
tes and because the questions used to measure alcohol use

* The standard error of prevalence reported here reflects the sampling variability in the predicted diabetes prevalence but does not incorporate
uncertainty in the prediction model (parameter uncertainty and stochastic uncertainty) and thus is an underestimate for the true standard error of
prevalence. See footnote to Table 2 for an example of how the inclusion of these sources would affect standard errors.

and physical activity are different from those used in
NHANES. The effects of some such factors may be cap-
tured by the variables in our model (e.g., self-reported dia-
betes, BMI, smoking, insurance status, visit to a doctor,
etc.). If the unexplained effects vary systematically across
states, the model may underestimate cross-state variation
in diabetes prevalence, making our results conservative.
Second, we conducted our analysis using FPG because of
its availability for the most recent rounds of NHANES and
because it is used by the American Diabetes Association to
define diabetes. Other definitions of diabetes, e.g., based
on glucose tolerance test, may have led to slightly different
estimates. Third, BRFSS response rate varies across states.
This may affect the state comparisons if the determinants
of non-response are associated with diabetes prevalence.
The single best way to reduce uncertainty in our analysis
would be the addition of a validation component to
BRFSS, which includes measured blood glucose for a ran-
dom sample of interviewees. Finally, because 50.2% of
observations in NHANES were missing either smoking or
insurance status, we used a missing indicator in our
regression models to include these observations. Drop-
ping these observations would decrease the precision of
our regression coefficients but would not affect the predic-
tions of diabetes prevalence by states materially.
Despite uncertainties, our results currently provide the
only estimates of total diabetes and undiagnosed diabetes
in U.S. states, and should provide motivation, guidance,
and benchmarks for designing, implementing, and evalu-
ating diabetes prevention and control programs at the
state level. Further, our methods allow states to combine
the relatively low-cost BRFSS telephone survey with
NHANES to regularly monitor the prevalence of diabetes
and progress in diabetes diagnosis.
Increasing the coverage of lifestyle, e.g., physical activity
and pharmacological interventions for diabetes, should
be a priority in states with high diabetes prevalence. Some
states also need to improve diagnosis, especially among
men, because early diagnosis and intensive glycemic con-
trol reduces the future incidence of microvascular compli-
cations [15,16]. Further, diabetes diagnosis will facilitate
interventions that lower blood pressure and cholesterol,
and hence the risk of cardiovascular disease, among dia-
betics [17,18]. The states with the highest estimated diabe-
tes prevalence in our analysis also have the highest levels
of blood pressure and cardiovascular disease risk [19,20].
This geographical distribution of cardiovascular risks and
diabetes points to the need for lifestyle and health care
interventions that reduce blood pressure and other cardi-
ovascular risks in high-diabetes states.
