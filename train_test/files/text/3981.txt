Abstract: Past research suggests that various courtship rituals, such as romantic kissing,
may convey useful mate quality information. Two studies were carried out to examine how
purported romantic kissing abilities, as a potential cue to some form of mate information,
affect appraisals of potential mating partners. In Experiment 1, 724 participants were
presented with vignette descriptions of potential mating partners and were asked to rate
partner desirability for various mating-related situations. The primary result of this
experiment was that purported kissing ability increased mate desirability in "casual sex"
mating situations for women to a greater extent than for men. Experiment 2 repeated the
same procedure with another 178 participants, this time including visual information
alongside vignette descriptions containing kissing-related information to examine the
relative effects of these two modalities. It was found that the presence of a picture
alongside a descriptive vignette negated the effect of kissing-related information only when
rating potential partners on attractiveness or desirability for further courtship, though not
when evaluating partners for casual sex or long-term relationship scenarios. Visual
information containing "attractive" photos of potential partners was also found to have a
greater effect on men's ratings of partner desirability than on women's ratings of partner
desirability. The results are discussed in light of romantic kissing's potential function of
conveying important mate quality and desirability information, and its relative role in the
presence of additional visual mate cues.

Introduction
Selecting an appropriate mate is arguably one of the most important decisions that
any sexually reproducing animal must make in order to ensure the successful propagation
of their genes. In recent years, it has been found that humans display distinct aptitudes
when it comes to evaluating the suitability of potential mating partners. The construct of
Romantic kissing and mate desirability

"attractiveness," many aspects of which are cultural universals (Langlois et al., 2000;
Perrett, May, and Yoshikawa, 1994; Singh, 1993), seems to be utilized heuristically to
assess mate desirability and is purported to act as a proxy for a mate's underlying genetic
fitness. Attractiveness (as rated subjectively by observers) has variously been found to
signal genetic health by virtue of fluctuating asymmetry (Grammer and Thornhill, 1994),
masculine/feminine physical dimorphism (Little, Burt, Penton-Voak, and Perrett, 2001),
female waist-to-hip ratio (Pawlowski and Dunbar, 2005; Singh, 1993), voice quality
(Collins and Missing, 2003), skin color (Stephen et al., 2012) and various olfactory cues
(i.e., Rikowski and Grammer, 1999).
Signals of mate quality, such as attractiveness, seem to be assessed in differing
ways by the two sexes due to the differing levels of minimal parental investment found
among humans, with the greater reproductive burden placed squarely on the shoulders of
women in the form of an extended period of gestation and lactation (Trivers, 1972).
Because of this difference, it appears that each sex has evolved behavioral predispositions
that place the greatest value on mate selection criteria that complement these different
reproductive costs. It has been found that, compared to men, women undertake a more
rigorous and discriminatory mate-selection process that places the highest value on both
traits signaling high genetic quality and parental investment potential. Men, on the other
hand, tend to prioritize the pursuit of short-term mating partners, focusing almost
exclusively on signs of genetic quality and fecundity, and displaying a willingness to
pursue a much broader spectrum of potential mates with lower levels of these traits (Buss
and Schmitt, 1993; Candolin, 2003; Grammer, Kruck, Juette, and Fink, 2000; Schmitt,
2003).
Because selecting a mate is often made within the context of a wider "biological
marketplace" of individuals who each compete for mating partners, it follows that each
individual must also consider their own "mate value" when formulating mating aspirations
(Kavanagh, Robins, and Ellis, 2010; Noe and Hammerstein, 1994). Previous research has
shown that attractiveness is generally considered to be the most desirable trait among
women, is of considerable importance to men, and serves as a reliable surrogate measure
for an individual's mate value. Research in this field has demonstrated that attractive
women show increased preferences for male masculinity and symmetry (putative good
gene indicators), while also demanding higher standards of potential mating partners than
less attractive females in areas such as resource acquisition potential and good parenting
indicators (Little et al., 2001; Shackelford, Schmitt, and Buss, 2005; Todd, Penke, Fasolo,
and Lenton, 2007).
It has been proposed that kissing, a near-ubiquitous custom among human cultures
(Eibl-Eibesfeldt, 1972; Kirshenbaum, 2011), may play a significant role in the process of
human mate assessment and relationship maintenance (Hughes, Harrison, and Gallup,
2007; Walter, 2008; Wlodarski and Dunbar, 2013a). Kissing might aid mate appraisal in
humans by facilitating olfactory assessment of various cues for genetic compatibility (see
Wedekind, Seebeck, Bettens, and Paepke, 1995), health (Durham, Malloy, and Hodges,
1993; Nicholson, 1984), genetic fitness (Thornhill and Gangestad, 1999), or even menstrual
cycle phase and fertility (Thornhill et al., 2003). Although limited kissing behaviors have
occasionally been observed in our closest primate cousins, bonobos and chimpanzees (de
Waal and Lanting, 1997; de Waal, 2000), these rarely occur in mate assessment situations.

Romantic kissing is also thought to play a secondary role in established relationships,
helping mediate the kinds of long-term pair-bonds that aid in the process of rearing
offspring to maturation (Geary, 2000; Hughes et al., 2007; Wlodarski and Dunbar, 2013a).
Although it is unclear at this point exactly which of these mate assessment and
retention functions romantic kissing might serve, it is almost certain that, like our other
mate assessment competencies, it works primarily at a sub-conscious level (Buss and
Schmitt, 1993). Just as individuals may decide that someone is attractive without being
aware that their appraisal is based on the fluctuating asymmetry that signals basal genetic
fitness, it is likely that romantic partners evaluate a kissing situation, sensing that a
potential partner is a "good" kisser for example, without being cognizant that this
assessment may result from a sub-conscious appraisal of some variant of their genetic
suitability. Indeed, research into the differences between partner preferences and real-life
partner choices seems to confirm that individuals sometimes lack self-awareness when it
comes to factors that influence their actual mate choice behavior (Eastwick and Finkel,
2008).
Recent research into kissing behavior among college students has found interesting
differences between men and women in their perceptions of the importance of kissing
during various courtship and mating situations. Using self-report measures, it was found
that men generally placed less emphasis on kissing than women, and that women placed
greater value on kissing during both the early stages of courtship, potentially as a mate
assessment device, and in the later stages of a long-term relationship, possibly to maintain
and monitor the pair-bonds that underlie such relationships (Hughes et al., 2007). More
recent evidence has also found that participants who are generally more sensitive to cues
signaling genetic quality, including women, high mate-value participants, and participants
high in sociosexual orientation, placed greater importance on kissing in early stages of
romantic relationships and were more likely to have their attraction to a potential mate
influenced (either positively or negatively) by an initial kiss (Wlodarski and Dunbar,
2013a). Attitudes towards kissing in romantic interactions have also been found to vary
across the menstrual cycle, with women in high conception risk cycle phases, who typically
show the greatest sensitivity to cues signaling fitness (Gangestad and Thornhill, 1998;
Havlicek, Roberts, and Flegr, 2005; Little, Jones, and Burriss, 2007; Penton-Voak et al.,
1999), stating that kissing was more important at initial relationship stages than women at
low conception risk cycle phases (Wlodarski and Dunbar, 2013b).
The aim of the present experiment was to determine whether romantic kissing-
related information can affect the process of human mate assessment. It was hypothesized
that participants led to believe that a potential mating partner is a "good kisser," a manifest
cue potentially signaling a mate's underlying genetic quality/suitability, will find them
more attractive, will be more willing to pursue further courtship (i.e., a date) with them,
will be more interested in pursuing non-committal sex with them, and be more willing to
consider pursuing a long-term relationship with them. It was further hypothesized that
alleged kissing abilities will have a greater influence on female partner preferences than on
male partner preferences, as they have been found to be the more selective sex when it
comes to utilizing signals of mate fitness. It is believed that individuals who are higher in
"mate value," as well as female participants, will generally be more discerning in their
appraisals of potential romantic partners, less likely to find potential partners desirable, and

will place a greater premium on kissing abilities.
Experiment 1
Methods
Participant recruitment
An online questionnaire was distributed to several public US- and UK-based online
psychological testing repositories, as well as to colleges at the University of Oxford, to
recruit a convenience sample of participants. Participants were required to be over 18 years
of age to complete the survey. No identifying personal data were collected, and participants
were informed that their responses were completely voluntary and anonymous. Participants
provided informed consent and were offered the chance to enter a prize draw for an online
shopping voucher upon completion of the questionnaire. Although these data were
collected as part of a larger study on kissing, with results relating to kissing attitudes
published separately in Wlodarski and Dunbar (2013a), the results presented here on
vignette ratings have never been published.
In total, 724 participants took the survey to completion, of whom 244 were male
and 480 were female, ranging in age from 18 to 63 (M = 24.9, SD = 8.1). Of the sample,
14.8% of men and 3.5% of women stated that they were either mostly or exclusively
attracted to the same sex. The majority of the participants self-identified as being ethnically
Caucasian (77.5%); 4.8% were Latino and 2.8% South Asian. The sample was mostly
made up of North American (39.1%), British (35.8%), and Western European (6.8%)
nationals. High school education was completed by 99.3% of participants, with 47.6%
having attained a diploma or some college experience. Roughly half of the participants
(54.6%) stated that they were in a relationship at the time of the survey.
The study was approved by Oxford University's Research Ethics Committee.
Questionnaire design
Participants were presented with descriptive vignettes of four different target
individuals of the sex they stated they were most attracted to, and were asked to answer
several questions about each. The vignettes were developed to represent descriptions of
various personality and relationship-history traits describing each hypothetical target
individual, who was also assigned a common English first name. Aspects of target
individual "personalities" were described using six to seven positive, as well as two to three
negative, adjectives made up of positive or negative antonyms (e.g.,
trustworthy/untrustworthy, warm/cold, intelligent/unintelligent), which previous research
found consistently rated as desirable or undesirable personality attributes (Anderson, 1968)
and which have been used successfully in previous research to create descriptive vignettes
(e.g., Fisak, Tantleff-Dunn, and Peterson, 2007). Negative descriptions were included
because early pilot testing indicated that purely positive descriptions were less believable or
"realistic" than mixed positive and negative descriptions. Several neutral descriptions of
pastimes and casual hobbies (such as running or cooking) were also included to improve
authenticity. The second half of each vignette consisted of a "third-hand" account
describing the target individual's relationship and sexual competences and experience; for
Romantic kissing and mate desirability

example, a description of how good their previous partner thought they were in bed, or
whether they "enjoyed physical intimacy." One of the competencies described in all the
vignettes was the target individual's kissing abilities, which acted as the independent
variable. The exact same four vignettes were presented to every participant, except that half
of the participants were randomly assigned to see vignette 1 and 4 altered to say the target
individual was a "good kisser" and vignettes 2 and 3 altered to say the individual was a
"bad kisser," whereas the other half of the participants were presented with the same
vignettes stating the opposite about their kissing abilities, with vignettes 1 and 4 describing
the target individual's kissing skills negatively and vignettes 2 and 3 describing them
positively. The comparison of responses between participants seeing the same vignettes
describe a target individual as either a "bad" or "good" kisser formed the primary
independent variable of interest (i.e., the kissing condition).
An example vignettes is included below:
Rob has been described by friends as pretty trustworthy and honest. One of his
favourite pastimes is cooking and staying in at home to read a good book. Though
he is not very sociable, and some people see him as downright unfriendly and
rude, he is very intelligent and open to trying new experiences. When his personal
relationship skills were evaluated by his previous partners, they reported that Rob
could be quite romantic at times, that he was a good kisser, and can be a bit
adventurous when it comes to love making. He is very respectful of others and
warm once you get to know him.
Upon being presented with a vignette, each participant was asked four questions
about the person described in the vignette (target individual), including "How `attractive'
do you find this person?" "How interested would you be in going on a date with this
person?", "How interested would you be in having a casual, one-off sexual encounter with
this person?", and "How interested would you be in pursuing a committed, long-term
relationship with this person?" Responses were collected using a 5-point Likert-type scale
ranging from 1 ("not at all") to 5 ("extremely"). Participants in relationships were asked to
imagine they were single for the purposes of answering these questions. Multivariate
analysis confirmed that there were no significant differences in mean answers to these four
questions between single participants and participants in a relationship, F(4, 719) = 1.87, p
= .114.
Because self-ratings of attractiveness have previously been found to correlate highly
with both other-rated judgments of attractiveness and with behaviors related to mating
aspirations (Kavanagh et al., 2010; Roberts and Little, 2008), self-rated attractiveness was
used as a proxy measure for real-world mate value. Participants were asked to answer the
questions "How do you think other people would rate you on physical attractiveness?" and
"How do you think other people would rate you on sexual attractiveness?" on a 7-point
Likert-type scale ranging from "very low" to "very high." Mate value was estimated by
averaging participant responses to these two questions, with this mean score then further
grand mean centered for inclusion in the MLM analyses as a covariate of interest. The
second half of the questionnaire also asked various demographic questions about sex, age,
education, ethnicity and nationality.

Statistical analyses
The experiment involved asking every participant four questions about each of the
four vignettes they read, with the effects of purported kissing quality analyzed using
multilevel modelling techniques. Multilevel modelling was most appropriate in this context
because it allowed interpretable aggregate ratings of attractiveness/mate-desirability despite
multiple measures being taken for each participant and the non-independence of these
ratings within each participant. Mixed Linear Models (MLM) were created to run these
analyses, with participant ratings of the different vignettes treated as random factors (with
random slopes and intercepts) in each model. Each MLM model also had two predictor
variables included as fixed factors: kissing condition and participant sex. The predictor
variable of participants' mate value (as estimated by their self-rated attractiveness) was also
included in each model as a fixed covariate. Each MLM included tests for the main fixed
effects of every predictor variable, as well as two-way and three-way interactions between
the main predictor variable of interest (kissing condition) and the other two factors.
Answers to the rating questions for each target vignette were the level 1 units of analysis,
with participants acting as the level 2 units of analysis. The independent variable of
"kissing quality," that is whether each participant was rating a vignette describing someone
as a "bad" or a "good" kisser, was a level 1 factor.
All analyses were carried out in SPSS (version 22.0, SPSS Inc., 2013). All
significance values within each of the MLM models are automatically adjusted for multiple
comparisons by SPSS, and further adjustment between models was not deemed appropriate
in this context as all the main analyses carried out in this paper were planned in advance,
rather than being carried out as post-hoc analyses.

For the question "How interested would you be in having a casual, one-off sexual

value, with a significant interaction effect found between kissing condition and sex, and
with no other interaction effects found to be significant (see Table 3).

value of participants, the more interested they were in pursuing casual sex (slope parameter
 = 0.11, SE = 0.04). Post-hoc MLM analyses of the interaction effect suggested that
although kissing had a significant effect on interest in casual sex amongst men (bad kisser:
M = 2.65, SE = 0.07; good kisser: M = 2.81, SE = 0.07; F(1, 728) = 7.05, p = .008), among
women this effect was more pronounced (bad kisser: M = 1.80, SE = 0.04; good kisser: M
= 2.11 SE = 0.04; F(1, 1436) = 56.32, p < .001) (see Figure 1).
Figure 1. Effect of sex and kissing condition on interest in casual sex
Effects of purported kissing quality on willingness to pursue a long-term relationship
For the question "How interested would you be in pursuing a committed, long-term
relationship with this person?", main effects were found for kissing condition, sex, and
mate value, with the interaction effect between sex and kissing condition approaching
significance and no other interaction effects (see Table 4).
When answering questions relating to willingness to pursue a long-term
relationship, it was found that participants who were told a target individual was a good
kisser were more interested in having a long-term relationship with them (M = 2.91, SE =

were generally more willing to pursue a relationship with target individuals (M = 2.51, SE
= 0.05) than women (M = 2.33, SE = 0.03) (see Figure 2), and the higher the mate value of
participants, the less likely they were to wish to pursue a relationship (slope parameter  = -
0.05, SE = 0.03).

Discussion
The results of this experiment indicate that participants led to believe that someone
was a "good kisser" rated them as more attractive, and were more willing to go on a date
with them, to have casual sex with them, and to pursue a committed relationship with them
than if they were led to believe that the same individual was a "bad kisser." Overall, men
were more likely to rate target individuals as attractive and were more willing to pursue a
date, casual sex, or a long-term relationship with them than women. The effect of kissing
ability on mate desirability was significantly more pronounced among women than among
men, but only when rating willingness to pursue a casual sex encounter. It was also found
Romantic kissing and mate desirability
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 12(1). 2014. -187-
that participants high in mate value were less interested in a romantic relationship, but more
interested in casual sex, with a potential partner.
These findings support those of previous research that indicate kissing can play a
role in mate assessment, with purported kissing abilities of a potential partner affecting
their attractiveness and desirability for different mating situations, including courtship,
casual sex, and long-term relationship contexts. On its own, this result may merely reflect
the fact that any domain general trait rated as "good" might positively affect overall mate
desirability. However, once this result is examined in light of its interaction with sex, the
role of kissing becomes more obvious. It was found that the positive impact of purported
"kissing quality" on a participant's willingness to have casual sex with a potential partner
was significantly greater for women than it was for men, suggesting that women may be
particularly influenced by this factor. When examined in light of previous findings that
women are the more selective sex during the mate assessment process, and are particularly
attuned to, and discriminating about, cues signaling superior genetic fitness (Candolin,
2003; Grammer et al., 2000; Kenrick, Sadalla, Groth, and Trost, 1990), this result is highly
suggestive of the conclusion that kissing may convey some mate quality information.
These findings support previous research on attitudes towards romantic kissing
across different stages of mate assessment. Experiments have suggested that women
generally place greater importance on romantic kissing in most romantic partner
interactions and seem to do so because it serves both to convey information regarding mate
quality and/or suitability, and to help in the mediation of established long-term attachment
bonds (Hughes et al., 2007; Wlodarski and Dunbar, 2013a). Our data seem to confirm the
use of romantic kissing as a tool for initial mate assessment, by showing that women, more
than men, were significantly influenced by kissing quality in casual sex situations (where it
may convey genetic quality information). A similar trend can be seen in our data when it
came to assessing mates in long-term relationship contexts, with kissing quality seeming to
have a greater effect on women than men, suggesting that kissing may also be useful in
long-term relationship situations (where it can mediate pair-bonds). However, this trend did
not reach statistical significance levels (interaction effect p = .066), and therefore is only
suggestive at this point. These trends were not evident when merely judging general mate
attractiveness or showing interest in pursuing a "date," situations which have less
immediate fitness consequences than casual sex or a long-term relationship (either in the
form of pregnancy resulting from casual sex, or the significant time and effort investments
of a relationship). This suggests that kissing-acquired information may be particularly
pertinent for mating situations with immediate fitness outcomes, perhaps due to the fact
that romantic kissing is not without its risks, such as exposing relative strangers to
numerous potential infection hazards (Cowan et al., 2002; Schoch-Spana, 1992; Tully et
al., 2006).
The current experiment also found that men were more likely across the board to
find descriptions of potential mating partners more attractive, were more willing to date
them, much more willing to have casual sex with them, and more willing to pursue a
relationship with them. This result is in line with previous observations that the smaller
minimal parental investment burden shouldered by men favors short-term mating strategies
involving the pursuit of a much broader range of potential mating partners (Buss and
Schmitt, 1993; Candolin, 2003; Grammer et al., 2000; Schmitt, 2003). That women are the
Romantic kissing and mate desirability
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 12(1). 2014. -188-
more discerning sex when it comes to partner choice was most clearly highlighted by their
much lower willingness to pursue casual sexual encounters as compared to men, the one
situation that carries the highest immediate risk of incurring parental burden, and one that
might be considerably more onerous if choice of mating partner is poor.
Our findings also demonstrate that mate value can play a role in the evaluation of
potential romantic partners. Participants of higher mate value (i.e., those who rated
themselves as more attractive) were found to be less interested in pursuing a romantic
relationship with a potential partner, although they were more interested in pursuing casual
sex. This variation in mate desirability among participants with differing mate values is
partly explained by the theory that mate choice exists in the context of a wider "biological
marketplace," where individuals who are in high demand, and are cognizant of the fact that
they are in high demand, can be generally more selective when choosing potential mates
(Noe and Hammerstein, 1994; Pawlowski and Dunbar, 1999). In this case, high mate value
individuals were less likely to wish to pursue long-term relationships with any of the target
individuals described in the vignettes, perhaps because they can afford to be selective about
with whom they wish make such significant mating investments. Attractive men and
women have been previously found to be more promiscuous in their mating strategies (i.e.,
Little et al., 2001; Perilloux, Cloud, and Buss, 2013; Rammsayer and Troche, 2013),
preferring casual sexual encounters to long-term relationship situations, with these
strategies potentially explaining why we found higher mate value to be associated with
greater interest in pursuing casual sex.
Experiment 2
Because kissing is just one of many cues that are used when assessing the value of
potential mates, it is likely that the effects of kissing might be affected by the presence of
other mate cue information. Humans are a primarily visual species, and although past
research suggests that there is multi-modal interplay between the senses when it comes to
mate assessment, it is visual cues that are generally prioritized over our other senses
(Foster, 2008; Kovacs et al., 2004; Saxton, Lyndon, Little, and Roberts, 2008). Because of
this, it seems likely that in the presence of both kissing-related informational cues and
traditional visual cues, visual cues may take precedence when it comes to making
assessments about a potential mate. Furthermore, as research shows that men are
neurologically more responsive to visual sexual stimuli than women (Hamann, Herman,
Nolan, and Wallen, 2004), sex differences may exist in the relative value placed on visual
cues of attractiveness as compared to other cues, such as olfactory cues as assessed by
romantic kissing. This suggests that the presence of visual cues may affect the impact of
any mate quality cues inherent in kissing.
To examine the role of visual cues, a smaller sample of participants were presented
with the same kissing vignettes as in Experiment 1, but alongside visual mate information
(i.e., a profile picture). It was predicted that kissing information would generally be less
effective at influencing mate assessments when placed alongside visual mate information,
which is the dominant sensory modality in humans. Furthermore, it was predicted that men
would be more influenced by the presence of visual cues than women, due to their greater
reliance on visual mate information.

Methods
Participant recruitment was the same as for Experiment 1. A total of 178
participants completed the survey with pictures present alongside each descriptive vignette,
including 64 men and 114 women, ranging in age from 18 to 63 (M = 23.9, SD = 7.4). Of
the sample, 10.9% of men and 3.5% of women stated they were either mostly or
exclusively attracted to the same sex. Participants predominantly self-identified as
Caucasian (80.3%), with 4.5% identifying as South Asian and 3.4% as Latino. The sample
was mostly made up of British (51.7%), North American (26.4%), and Western European
(5.6%) nationals. High school education was completed by 98.9% of participants, with
44.4% having attained a diploma or some college experience. Slightly more than half of the
participants (57.9%) stated that they were in a relationship at the time of the survey. A
multivariate test again showed that there were no significant differences between single
participants and participants in a relationship on answers to questions about partner
desirability, F(4, 173) = 2.78, p = .063.
Questionnaire design
The design of the questionnaire in this experiment was identical to that of
Experiment 1, except that participants were also shown four different "headshot" images of
hypothetical mating partners (target individuals), with one image paired with each of the
four vignettes. The images consisted of life-like composite photos (corrected to be
indistinguishable from real photos) of faces that had been previously rated as either highly
attractive (two photos) or unattractive (two photos) (Braun, Gründl, Marberger, and
Scherber, 2001; Jones et al., 2010). The design ensured that each participant viewed two
vignettes with partners described as bad kissers, one vignette partnered with an attractive
photo and one with an unattractive photo, and two vignettes rating partners as good kissers,
one with an attractive photo and one with an unattractive photo.
Participants were again asked four questions about the target individual based on
their vignette and photo: "How `attractive' do you find this person?", "How interested
would you be in going on a date with this person?", "How interested would you be in
having a casual, one-off sexual encounter with this person?", and "How interested would
you be in pursuing a committed, long-term relationship with this person?" Responses were
collected using a 5-point Likert-type scale ranging from 1 ("not at all") to 5 ("extremely").
Statistical analyses
The same Mixed Linear Model analyses were carried out as in Experiment 1, with
the addition of "partner attractiveness" as a fixed factor, both as a main effect and as an
interaction effect with the other predictor variables in each model.
Results
Effects of purported kissing quality on ratings of attractiveness
For the question "How attractive do you find this person?", significant main effects
were found only for attractiveness of the picture presented, with no main effects for kissing
condition, sex, or mate value. Significant two-way interactions were found between kissing

condition and mate value and between sex and picture attractiveness (see Table 5).

This analysis indicated, not surprisingly, that potential partners with more attractive
pictures were rated as generally much more attractive (attractive picture: M = 2.89, SE =
0.06; unattractive picture: M = 1.90, SE = 0.06). The first interaction suggests that for target
individuals described in vignettes as bad kissers, higher mate value participants were less
likely to find them attractive (slope parameter  = -.13, SE = .04, t(356) = -3.01, p = .003),
whereas for target individuals with vignettes describing them as good kissers, mate value
had no effect (slope parameter  < -.01, SE = .05, t(356) = 0.06, p = .950). The second
interaction indicates that whereas men rated target individuals with the attractive picture as
much more attractive (M = 3.16, SE = 0.09) than target individuals with the unattractive
picture (M = 1.77, SE = 0.09), F(1, 191) = 203.34, p < .001, among women this difference
was much smaller (attractive picture: M = 2.64, SE = 0.07; unattractive picture: M = 2.05,
SE = 0.07; F(1, 341) = 52.09, p < .001) (see Figure 3a).
Effects of purported kissing quality on willingness to go on a date
For the question "How interested would you be in going on a date with this
person?", significant main effects were found only for attractiveness of the picture, with no
main effects for kissing condition, sex, or mate value. Significant two-way interactions
were found between sex and picture attractiveness (see Table 6).
This analysis again indicated that when presented with descriptions of potential
partners that included attractive pictures, participants were generally more willing to go on
a date with those partners (attractive picture: M = 2.68, SE = 0.06; unattractive picture: M =

date with potential partners represented by attractive pictures (M = 2.93, SE = 0.10) than
unattractive pictures (M = 2.01, SE = 0.10), F(1, 191) = 60.71, p < .001, among women this

Effects of purported kissing quality on willingness to engage in casual sex
For the question "How interested would you be in having a casual, one-off sexual
encounter with this person?", main effects were found for kissing condition, picture
attractiveness, and sex, with no main effects for mate value. A significant interaction was
found between sex and picture attractiveness, and between kissing condition, picture
attractiveness, and mate value (see Table 7).
These results indicate that when asked about casual sex: participants told a target
individual was a good kisser were more interested in having a casual sexual encounter with
them (M = 2.06, SE = 0.07) than when a target individual was described as a bad kisser (M
= 1.92, SE = 0.07); males were generally much more willing to have casual sex with target
individuals (M = 2.32, SE = 0.09) than females were (M = 1.63, SE = 0.07); and all
participants were more likely to wish to pursue casual sex with any target partner
represented by an attractive picture than an unattractive picture (attractive picture M = 2.36,
SE = 0.07, unattractive picture M = 1.62, SE = 0.07). The interaction suggests that while
males were more willing to have sex with a target partner represented by an attractive
picture (M = 2.91, SE = 0.12) than an unattractive picture (M = 1.75, SE = 0.12), F(1, 191)
= 107.19, p < .001, among females this difference was smaller (attractive picture M = 1.80,
SE = 0.07, unattractive picture M = 1.50, SE = 0.07, F(1, 340) = 18.11, p = .001) (see

Post-hoc analyses of the three way interaction (adjusted for multiple comparisons)
suggested that when it came to rating bad kissers, participants were more willing to pursue
casual sex with targets represented by an attractive picture (M = 2.09, SE = 0.08) than an
unattractive picture (M = 1.55, SE = 0.08), F(1, 175) = 33.35, p < .001. However, when it
came to rating good kissers, an interaction effect suggested that when a target was
represented by an unattractive picture, there was no effect of mate value (slope parameter 
= -0.02, SE = 0.07), but when a target was represented by an attractive picture, higher mate
value individuals were less willing to pursue casual sex with them than were lower mate
value individuals (slope parameter  = -0.27, SE = 0.07), interaction F(1, 176) = 11.28, p <
.002.
Effects of purported kissing quality on willingness to pursue a long-term relationship
For the question "How interested would you be in pursuing a committed, long-term
relationship with this person?", main effects were found for kissing condition, picture
attractiveness, and mate value, with no main effect for sex. A significant interaction was
found between sex and picture attractiveness (see Table 8).
When answering questions relating to willingness to pursue a long-term
relationship, it was found that participants who were told a target individual was a good
kisser were more interested in having a long-term relationship with them (M = 2.14, SE =
0.06) than with target individuals described as a bad kissers (M = 1.96, SE = 0.06),
individuals were more likely to wish to pursue a relationship with a target individual
described using attractive pictures (M = 2.25, SE = 0.06) than unattractive pictures (M =
1.85, SE = 0.06), and the higher the mate value of participants, the less likely they were to

desire a relationship (slope parameter  = -0.10, SE = 0.08). The interaction effect meant
that men were more willing to pursue a relationship with target individuals with attractive
pictures (M = 2.51, SE = 0.10) than with unattractive pictures (M = 1.78, SE = 0.10), F(1,
190) = 39.31, p < .001, whereas among women there was no significant difference
(attractive picture: M = 2.00, SE = 0.08; unattractive picture: M = 1.93, SE = 0.08; F(1,
340) = 0.77, p = .380) (see Figure 3d).

Discussion
The results from Experiment 2 show that although the presence of visual
information alongside a descriptive vignette eliminated the effect of "good kissing"
abilities on ratings of partner attractiveness and interest in going on a date with that partner,
the presence of visual cues did not alter the positive effect of kissing quality information on
partner desirability for casual sexual encounters or long-term relationships. Not
surprisingly, participants presented with attractive pictures of a hypothetical target partner
rated them as more attractive, and were more willing to go on a date, pursue casual sex, or
a committed relationship with them. In all cases, however, this effect was moderated by
sex, with attractive visual information having a much greater effect on men's ratings of
partner desirability than on women's ratings.

These findings highlight the conflicting roles that different mate cues might play in
the process of assessing and selecting a mate. That the presence of visual information
interferes with kissing-related mate information, though only in certain mate selection
situations, suggests there is a more complex interplay between these two cues than initially
assumed. When it came to assessing potential mates on relatively innocuous mate
assessment criteria, such as rating their attractiveness or going on a "date," participants
seemed to rely exclusively on visual information. However, when partners were assessed in
light of the potentially more "costly" mating situations of pursuing casual sex or a
relationship, where the consequences of poor mate choice are more immediate and severe,
then kissing-related information managed to significantly affect partner assessment even in
the presence of visual cues. This suggests that kissing might convey salient information
about a potential mate, either about their genetic fitness (compatibility) or their long-term
relationship potential, which is at least as important as information that can be garnered
from visual cues. This finding mirrors past research suggesting a complex multi-modal cue
interplay whereby people take into account, and prioritize, certain cues depending on the
mating context that they find themselves in (Foster, 2008; Kovacs et al., 2004; Saxton et
al., 2008).
Results from Experiment 2 also suggest that men and women react differently to
picture attractiveness, with men rating potential partners much more positively on all
criteria in the presence of an attractive picture than women, suggesting that they are more
Romantic kissing and mate desirability
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 12(1). 2014. -195-
influenced by picture attractiveness than women. This finding is in line with a large body of
past research that indicates men in general tend to prioritize cues of physical attractiveness
and fecundity in potential partners more than women (Buss, 1989; Townsend and
Wassermann, 1998; Waynforth and Dunbar, 1995). Furthermore, men also show higher
physiological responses to visual sexual stimuli than women (Hamann et al., 2004), thus
further explaining the greater influence of visual cues on mate decisions found in this
experiment. It is interesting to note that although visual cues still had some effect on female
ratings of attractiveness and willingness to pursue a date or casual sex, they did not affect
female ratings of interest in pursuing a relationship. This is likely because women place
greater value than men on mate cues signaling potential, long-term parental investment
(Bjorklund and Shackelford, 1999; Buss, 1989; Shackelford et al., 2005), which may be
more difficult to assess from basic morphological visual information alone.
Lastly, when it came to mate value this experiment replicated some of the findings
of Experiment 1, showing that high mate value participants were less likely to wish to
pursue a relationship with target individuals in the presence of a picture, while also being
less likely to pursue casual sex with a "good kisser" target individual in the presence of an
attractive picture. Furthermore, it was also found that high mate value participants rated
potential partners as less attractive if they were also rated as a bad kisser. These results may
again demonstrate the increased levels of selectivity displayed by high mate value
participants, who can afford to be more selective and thus may discount a greater
proportion of potential mates as less desirable across multiple different mating situations.
General Discussion
The primary finding of this study is that purported kissing abilities can influence a
potential mate's attractiveness and general desirability, particularly for women in casual
sex situations. Whereas previous research on attitudes towards romantic kissing has been
conducted using self-report attitude measures (i.e., Hughes et al., 2007; Wlodarski and
Dunbar, 2013a), this study is the first to use an experimental design in an attempt to
measure whether romantic kissing conveys information that is actively utilized in the
process of mate assessment. Although the findings presented here corroborate the notion
that kissing serves a functional role in mating situations, we can still only speculate at this
point as to the mechanisms by which kissing might carry out these functions. It is likely
that kissing works to affect initial mate assessment by bringing two individuals into close
proximity so as to facilitate some kind of olfactory/gustatory assessment, since olfaction in
most mammals, as well as in humans, can play an important role in assessing potential
mates (e.g., Penn and Potts, 1999; Wedekind et al., 1995). In established relationships, on
the other hand, the contact and physiological arousal initiated by continued romantic
kissing is likely to also affect feelings of attachment between individuals over time,
influencing the release of neuropeptides (including oxytocin and vasopressin), dopamine,
and opioids, which have all been variously associated with human pair-bonding (de Boer,
van Buel, and Ter Horst, 2012). Future, more methodologically challenging research is
needed to help clarify which of these mechanisms is the most likely pathway by which
kissing can affect mating interactions.
These studies are also the first to examine the relative roles of kissing-based and
Romantic kissing and mate desirability

classical visual mate information. The vast majority of research into human mate selection
has focused on visual mate cues, perhaps justifiably so as vision dominates human
interaction with the world (Levin, 1993). However, these results suggest that other mate
cues, such as the kinds of olfactory cues that might be assessed during romantic kissing,
may also play an important role in this involved process. As olfaction is an important and
evolutionarily-conserved mode of mate assessment across mammal taxa (Clutton-Brock
and McAuliffe, 2009), the possibility exists that this sense may be a more accurate form of
mate assessment than visual senses, which have only recently evolved to become the
dominant sense in humans. Furthermore, these results highlight the need to take into
account the type of mate assessment being made by an individual (i.e., merely rating
attractiveness versus rating desirability for long-term relationships), as these differing
mating interactions seem to be affected in divergent ways by different mate cue modalities.
