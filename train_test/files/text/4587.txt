Abstract
Objective: To determine risk factors for multi-drug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (MDR-AB)
nosocomial infections in intensive care units in a tertiary care hospital, Makkah, Saudi Arabia.
Methods: We performed a hospital-based, matched case­control study in patients who were
admitted to Al Noor Specialist Hospital between 1 January 2012 and 31 August 2012. The study
included cases of A. baumannii nosocomial infection and controls without infection. Controls were
matched to cases by age and ward of admission.
Results: The most frequent site of infection was the respiratory tract (77.3%). Susceptibility to
antimicrobial MDR-AB was 92.0% for ceftazidime and ciprofloxacin, while it was 83.3% for
imipenem, 83.0% for trimethoprim, 79.0% for amikacin, and 72.7% for gentamicin. Multiple logistic

Introduction
More than 2 million people, or approxi-
mately 5% to 10% of hospitalized patients,
are affected by nosocomial infections with
an estimated 90,000 deaths every year.1,2 As
well as the disease burden regarding signifi-
cant morbidity and mortality of nosocomial
infections, high healthcare costs are incurred
in managing nosocomial infections. A study
that was performed in Rhode Island
Hospital showed that the cost of patients
with hospital-acquired infections was more
than three times higher than that of those
without infectious diseases.3 Nosocomial
infections are usually transmitted by poor
hygiene practice, followed by the provision
of outpatient treatment and invasive med-
ical procedures. Patients' impaired defence
against bacteria (e.g., because of pre-term
birth or immunodeficiency) increases the
chance of infection.4 Additionally, because
medical staff are associated with patients in
different units, they may carry and spread
pathogens.5
One of the major gram-negative bacteria
responsible for nosocomial infections is
Acinetobacter. Acinetobacter may cause
severe pneumonia and infections of the urin-
ary tract, bloodstream, and other parts of the
body. Acinetobacter is primarily found in
hospitalized patients with a reduced immune
defence who are affected by drug-resistant
gram-negative germs. These bacteria can
survive on surfaces in the hospital for a long
time and attack the body through wounds
and invasive devices. According to recent
data from the U.S. National Healthcare
Safety Network, more than 30% of hospi-
tal-acquired infections are due to gram-
negative bacteria, and the majority of venti-
lator-associated pneumonia (47%) and urin-
ary tract infection (45%) cases are associated
with these bacteria.6 Acinetobacter baumannii
also causes community-acquired infections,
albeit at a lower percentage than hospital-
acquired infections.
Management of A. baumannii infections
may be difficult because of intrinsic resist-
ance to some antibiotics, as well as new
mechanisms of resistance throughout treat-
ment.7 These infections form a large pro-
portion of hospital infections. A report from
Turkish hospitals showed that 16.6% of
nosocomial infections were due to A. bau-
mannii, with the majority (68.9%) of them in
ICU (Intensive care unit) patients; more
than half (52.5%) of these patients suffered
from respiratory tract infections.8 A. bau-
mannii is the most common species of
genus,9 which is widely present in the hos-
pital environment. A. baumannii can cause
severe or fatal illnesses, especially in critic-
ally ill patients with low immune responses,5
and can increase patient mortality along
with hospital costs. Therefore, multi-drug
resistance is a major public health emer-
gency. Additionally, A. baumannii is a spe-
cies of pathogenic bacteria and is an
aerobic gram-negative bacterium known
1182 Journal of International Medical Research 45(3)
for resistance to most antibiotics. A. bauman-
nii can survive in dry environments for weeks,
which enables transmission through contam-
inants in hospitals.10 Patients, who are the
main reservoirs of A. baumannii, can con-
taminate attending staff, leading to further
cross-transmission11 Therefore, hospitals are
thought to be the main source of A. bauman-
nii infections. A study carried out in Spain
showed that more than 90% of A. baumannii
infections were of nosocomial origin, and
only 4% originated from the community.12
While antimicrobial agents are considered
as a solution for infectious disease, resistance
of microorganisms to various drugs has
raised new problems, especially for hospital-
acquired infections. There has been an
increasing amount of research conducted on
factors related to the transmission of such
infections. However, multi-drug resistance
makes the illnesses more serious because of
limited treatment options.
Several studies have identified general
characteristics of patients that place them
at increased risk for acquisition of multi-
drug-resistant outbreak strains.4 However,
the diversity of risk factors suggests that
separate investigations should be performed
in each hospital setting.7 Therefore, asso-
ciated factors contributing to infection
should be assessed to apply basic prevention
and control measures.
Methods
Study design and setting
We performed a hospital-based, retrospect-
ive case­control study to determine the
demographic characteristics and factors
that may be associated with mortality and
morbidity related to multi-drug-resistant A.
baumannii (MDR-AB) nosocomial infec-
tion. We included patients in Al Noor
Specialist Hospital, Makkah, Kingdom of
Saudi Arabia.
The study was conducted at an approxi-
mately 500-bed tertiary care hospital
providing all major specialties (e.g., adult
cardiology, internal medicine, nephrology,
urology, neurology, plastic surgery, dental
health, emergency medicine, and adult
intensive care; 29 beds). Patients requiring
paediatrics and maternity care are trans-
ferred to the regional maternity and chil-
dren's hospital in Makkah. Al-Noor
Specialist Hospital is a referral hospital for
Hajj and Umrah pilgrims with multiple
nationalities.
This hospital deals with a variety of
patients with multiple risk factors.
Therefore, there are strict infection control
measures in hospital in general and intensive
care unit to control the spread of infections.
Measures are implemented and supervised
by the infection control department.
Standard precautions are taken (e.g., hand
hygiene and use of protective devices) health
care professionals to prevent spreading
infection.
The study population consisted of all
patients aged 18 years and older in the
intensive care unit, and surgery, medicine,
neurology, and urology wards in this hospital
from 1 January 2012 to 31 August 2012.
The cases were patients with one or more
clinically positive cultures for MDR-AB,
where clinical evidence of infection was
present 48 hours after admission.13 Multi-
drug resistance was defined as resistance to
more than three classes of antibiotics (ami-
noglycosides, beta-lactams, quinolones, and
tetracyclines).13 Therefore, patients who had
isolated MDR-AB from their clinical speci-
men within 48 hours of admission were not
included in the case group. Each A. bau-
mannii infection case was matched by age
(within 5 years) and ward of admission with
two control patients without A. baumannii.
Matching of the controls to cases was per-
formed by enrolling the same percentage of
patients without isolated A. baumannii in
their clinical specimen who were within the
same age category and who stayed in the
same ward as the cases.

Data collection. Specially designed data col-
lection forms were used to collect demo-
graphic and clinical data. Two slightly
different forms, specific to the case and
control groups, were used. Data on demo-
graphic characteristics, host and therapeutic
factors, laboratory and bacteriology results,
antibiotic therapy, and outcomes were col-
lected using medical and laboratory records.
Data on a previous history were collected
from previous medical records.
Statistical analysis
Descriptive analysis. In this study, a single
variable was analysed at a time. No com-
parisons were made between variables. For
nominal or ordinal (categorical) variables,
the frequency and proportion were used,
while for continuous or discrete (numerical)
variables, the mean and standard deviation
are shown. After processing the analysis
using SPSS, independent variables are
described using tables, pie charts, and bar
charts. Distribution of the study sample by
demographic and clinical variables was
analysed using this method.
Multivariate analysis. Factors with a p
value < 0.05 were considered statistically
significant and analysed using multivariate
regression. A multivariate logistic regression
model was created with MDR-AB (and
clinical outcomes of these cases) as the
dependent variable. All variables with
p < 0.05 in univariate analysis were included
in the multivariate model as independent
variables to identify independent predictors
of multi-resistance. A p value was con-
sidered to be two-tailed and p < 0.05 was
considered statistically significant.
Ethics approval and consent to participate
This study was first approved by the
Institutional Review Board of Al-Noor
Specialist Hospital, Ministry of Health
(approval #: HJ/3065). The study was con-
ducted retrospectively and the patients'
information was retrieved from medical
records. Therefore, written consent was not
necessary.
Results
In the study population, 57% were males
and 43% were females. The mean age was
53.5 Æ 21.9 years for cases and 50.4 Æ 22.1
years for controls (Table 1). The majority
(80.3%) of patients in the case group
remained in hospital for longer than 1
week (Figure 1). The most frequent site of
infection was the respiratory tract (77.3%,
Figure 2). A total of 92% of A. baumannii
cases were susceptible to ceftazidime and
ciprofloxacin, 83% to trimethoprim, and
79% to amikacin. The highest resistance
(Figure 3) was observed for imipenem
(83.3%) and gentamicin (72.7%). All of
the isolates were susceptible to colistin and
tigecycline.
The results of multiple logistic regression
of risk factors associated with MDR-AB are
shown in Table 2. Immunosuppression was
a significant risk factor. Patients with
immunosuppression were three times more
likely to become infected than those with a
good immune status [Odd ratio (OR) ¼ 2.9;
95% Confidence Interval (CI) ¼ 1.5À5.6;
p ¼ 0.002]. Furthermore, undergoing
invasive procedures had a significant and

Discussion
This study investigated infections with
MDR-AB in a specialist hospital in
Makkah. This phenomenon is not specific
to this hospital alone because an increased
rate of MDR-AB has been reported5,6,9 in
health care settings elsewhere. A previous
study showed that male sex was among
the major predictors for MDR-AB.14 In
this study, we found that the majority
(80.3%) of patients in the case group
stayed in the hospital for longer than 1

week. Another study in Taiwan found that
prolonged hospital stay affected disease
outcome and increased the mortality rate
of patients.10
In the present study, the respiratory tract
was the most frequent site of infection. This
finding is similar to a previous report.8
The most resistant antibiotics were imipenem
and gentamicin. This finding is comparable
with previous findings where patients who
were treated with imipenem had increased
mortality (17.5%) because of underlying
illnesses and lowered immunity.15 Our find-
ings are also in agreement with other
studies16­18 that reported that A. baumannii
was resistant to several antibiotics. In our
study, patients with immunosuppression
were three times more likely to be infected
compared with those without immunosup-
pression (OR ¼ 2.9; 95% CI 1.5­5.6;
p ¼ 0.002). A previous study15 in Riyadh,
Saudi Arabia, supports this finding, showing
that A. baumannii is more common in
patients who have intravascular catheters,
have prior antibiotic use, and use ventilator
support. Our results are also consistent with
findings of study15 that reported the anti-
microbial resistance pattern among commu-
nity-acquired organisms in pilgrims. A.
baumannii is highly resistant to carbapenems
and quinolones.
Furthermore, in our study, invasive
procedures had a significant effect and
were strongly associated with A. baumannii
infection (Table 2). In particular, patients
who had a central venous catheters or
endotracheal tube were more susceptible to
A. baumannii infection (Table 3). These
findings are similar to previous studies19­21
that reported that previous antibiotic treat-
ment, major surgical procedures, burns,
immunosuppression and using invasive
devices, especially mechanical ventilation,
predisposed patients to acquiring A. bau-
mannii infection.
Conclusion
Widespread A. baumannii nosocomial
infections are increasing, and the situation
is becoming more serious each day, with
growing drug resistance. Difficulties in
treatment are hard to manage. Some of
these infections may be reduced if pre-
vention programmes are timely and effect-
ively applied. Avoidance of unnecessary
antimicrobial treatment, invasive devices,
and some other procedures, as well as
shortening the length of hospital stay by
applying effective treatment for underlying
illnesses, may make infections easier to
control. Furthermore, good sanitation
practices and staff hygiene may also con-
tribute to controlling the threat of A.
baumannii.
