Firearm-Related Criminal Activity Among
Authorized Purchasers of Handguns

Context.--Under current federal law, many persons with prior convictions for
misdemeanor offenses pass criminal records background checks and legally pur-
chase handguns.
Objective.--To determine whether authorized handgun purchasers with prior
misdemeanor convictions are more likely than those with no criminal history to be
charged with new crimes, particularly offenses involving firearms and violence.
Design.--Retrospective cohort study.
Setting and Participants.--A total of 5923 authorized purchasers of handguns
in California in 1977 who were younger than 50 years, identified by random sample.
Main Outcome Measures.--Incidence and relative risk (RR) of first charges for
new criminal offenses after handgun purchase.
Results.--Of the 5923 authorized purchasers, 3128 had at least 1 conviction for
a misdemeanor offense prior to handgun purchase, and 2795 had no prior criminal
history. Follow-up to the end of the 15-year observation period or to death was
available for 77.8% of study subjects and for a median 8.9 years for another 9.6%.
Handgun purchasers with at least 1 prior misdemeanor conviction were more than
7 times as likely as those with no prior criminal history to be charged with a new
offense after handgun purchase (RR, 7.5; 95% confidence interval [CI], 6.6-8.7).
Among men, those with 2 or more prior convictions for misdemeanor violence were
at greatest risk for nonviolent firearm-related offenses such as weapon carrying
(RR, 11.7; 95% CI, 6.8-20.0), violent offenses generally (RR, 10.4; 95% CI,
6.9-15.8), and Violent Crime Index offenses (murder or non-negligent manslaugh-
ter, forcible rape, robbery, or aggravated assault) (RR, 15.1; 95% CI, 9.4-24.3).
However, even handgun purchasers with only 1 prior misdemeanor conviction and
no convictions for offenses involving firearms or violence were nearly 5 times as
likely as those with no prior criminal history to be charged with new offenses involv-
ing firearms or violence.
Conclusions.--Handgun purchasers with prior misdemeanor convictions are at
increasedriskforfuturecriminalactivity,includingviolentandfirearm-relatedcrimes.
JAMA. 1998;280:2083-2087
IN 1995, 1.2 million firearm-related vio-
lent crimes were committed in the
United States, including 13 673 firearm
homicides.1,2 In1994,anestimated60 900
persons were treated in hospital emer-
gency departments for nonfatal gunshot
wounds received during an assault; 60%
required hospitalization.3
One generally accepted policy to pre-
vent firearm-related violence is to pro-
hibit the purchase of guns by persons
believed to be at high risk for future
criminal activity. The Gun Control Act
of 19684 outlaws the purchase and pos-
session of firearms by felons, fugitives
from justice, persons adjudicated to be
mentally ill, and others. Under the pro-
visions of the Brady Handgun Violence
Prevention Act,5 background checks of
prospective handgun purchasers are
conductednationwide.Theyidentifyap-
proximately 70 000 prohibited persons
each year, most of whom have been con-
victed of felonies.6-8
For editorial comment see p 2120.
It is a common misperception that
such policies prohibit gun purchase by
all but the law-abiding. In fact, many
thousands of persons with a history of
criminal activity legally purchase fire-
arms every year. It is well established
that persons with a history of even a
single prior arrest are, as a group, sub-
stantially more likely than persons with
no such history to engage in criminal be-
havior in the future.9-12 The possibility
therefore exists that some authorized
handgun purchasers are at higher risk
than others for later criminal activity.
This is not just a theoretical concern; it
hasbeennotedthat"aconsiderablefrac-
tionofpeoplewhocommitviolentcrimes
are legally entitled to own guns."13
To study this issue, we undertook a
long-term retrospective cohort study of
criminal activity among 5923 persons
younger than 50 years who legally pur-
chased handguns in California in 1977,
with follow-up through the end of 1991.
The study population included 3128
handgun purchasers with at least 1 prior
convictionforamisdemeanoroffenseand
2795 handgun purchasers with no prior
criminal history. (Misdemeanors are less
seriouscrimesthanfelonies;theyarepun-
ishable by incarceration, typically in a lo-
cal facility and for 1 year or less.14) All
these purchasers passed a criminal rec-

criteria in the Gun Control Act of 1968,
which differ only slightly to those cur-
rently in force under federal law.
Our hypotheses were that (1) handgun
purchasers with prior misdemeanor con-
victions would be at increased risk for
later criminal activity, particularly for
violent and firearm-related offenses, (2)
the increase in risk would be related in-
verselytoageanddirectlytothenumber
of prior convictions that subjects had re-
ceived,and(3)purchaserswithpriorcon-
victions for offenses involving firearms
or violence would be at greatest risk for
such offenses after handgun purchase.
METHODS
Sampling and Cohort Formation
The study population was identified
by random sampling from a computer-
ized registry of all persons who pur-
chased a handgun from a licensed fire-
arms dealer in California in 1977, the
first year such a registry was compiled.
Duplicate entries for persons who pur-
chased more than 1 handgun that year
wereremovedpriortosampling.There-
maining entries were stratified by a no-
tationthat,whenpresent,indicatedthat
the purchaser had a record on file with
the California Department of Justice
(CDOJ) at the time of handgun purchase
and may have had a criminal history at
that time. One sample was drawn from
each stratum.
Preliminary sampling suggested that
approximately half of all handgun pur-
chaserswithanypriorcriminalhistoryhad
been charged with an offense involving
firearms or violence. Sample sizes were
plannedtomaximizestatisticalpowerfor
comparisonsinvolvingthissubgroup,with
the size of the cohort sufficient to detect
a relative risk (RR), depending on the in-
cidence of a specific outcome event, of 1.5
or higher with an  of .05 and a power of
0.8 or higher.15
Criminal records were requested for
all sampled purchasers, and final deter-
mination of eligibility and study group
assignment was made only after the rec-
ordshadbeenobtainedandreviewed.Of
3002 sampled persons (among 126 903
eligible) whose registry entries did not
indicatethatarecordwasonfileatCDOJ,
41 were found to have had a criminal his-
toryatthetimeofhandgunpurchaseand
were assigned to that study group. Of
16 637sampledpersons(among45 472eli-
gible) whose registry entries indicated a
record was on file at CDOJ, 7095 were
found to have no criminal history at the
time of handgun purchase; their records
wererelatedtoemploymentscreeningor
other matters. A random sample of 435
of these were assigned to the no prior
criminal history study group, such that
thesepurchaserswereappropriatelyrep-
resentedinthatgroup,andtherestwere
excluded.
This initial review of criminal records
also identified 4162 persons who were
foundtohavehadacriminalhistoryprior
to handgun purchase but whose records
hadsubsequentlybeenpurgedandwere
not available. The CDOJ periodically re-
views a portion of its inactive criminal
records and purges those that meet de-
fined criteria. Records must be retained
for specified periods after an arrest or
conviction; the retention period is con-
tingent on the nature and the severity of
the offense.16 In practice, CDOJ's purg-
ing program focuses on records for the
oldest persons in its file. Among our po-
tential study subjects, the proportion
whoserecordshadbeenpurgedwassub-
stantially higher for those 50 years or
older than for younger handgun pur-
chasers.Wethereforeexcludedfromthe
study all persons who were 50 years or
older at the time of handgun purchase.
There remained 2555 persons younger
than 50 years whose criminal records
had been purged.
Another 1148 handgun purchasers
were excluded because, while they had
previously been arrested, they had not
been convicted of any crime prior to pur-
chasing their handguns. A total of 276
persons were excluded because it could
not be determined whether they had a
criminal history at the time of handgun
purchase, another 85 because their rec-
ords were missing for unknown reasons,
and25becausetheyneverreceivedtheir
guns or transferred them to other own-
ers shortly after purchase.
Data Acquisition and Management
Senior CDOJ criminal records techni-
cianstrainedourprojectstaffincriminal
record review, and ambiguous criminal
recordswerediscussedwithCDOJstaff.
We used double data entry procedures
for all study data sets, with computer-
ized and manual comparisons.
All convictions and charges were re-
corded.Convictionswerenotcountedas
evidenceofpriorcriminalactivityifthey
had also been dismissed before handgun
purchase. A charge for a new offense
during the period of follow-up was con-
sidered to be evidence of new criminal
activity.
Crimes were grouped into the follow-
ing classes: those involving neither fire-
arms nor violence (eg, petty theft, driv-
ing under the influence of alcohol), those
involving firearms but not violence (eg,
carrying a concealed firearm in a public
place),thoseinvolvingviolence(eg,simple
assault, robbery) and, as a subset of vio-
lent offenses, those classified by the Fed-
eral Bureau of Investigation as Violent
Crime Index offenses: murder and non-
negligentmanslaughter,forciblerape,rob-
bery, and aggravated assault.
Similarly, subjects with prior misde-
meanor convictions were grouped by
whether they had been convicted of fire-
arm-related or violent offenses as fol-
lows: (1) prior conviction(s), but none for
offensesinvolvingeitherfirearmsorvio-
lence; (2) prior conviction(s) involving
firearms, but none involving violence;
and (3) prior conviction(s) involving vio-
lence.Nosubgroupofsubjectswithprior
convictions involving violence, but none
involving firearms, could be established
as it was not possible to distinguish be-
tween violent offenses that involved
firearms and those that did not. For ex-
ample, of 843 charges of assault with a
deadly weapon filed against study sub-
jects, only 158 (18.7%) specified the na-
ture of the weapon.
The follow-up period began 15 days
following application for handgun pur-
chase, the first day on which legal acqui-
sition of the handgun could have oc-
curred, and ended December 31, 1991.
Only arrests occurring in California
were eligible for consideration as out-
come events since reliable data were not
available for events occurring else-
where. Subjects were considered to be
at risk for those events for only so long
as their continued residence in Califor-
nia could be verified independently. This
was done by linkage to the state's driv-
er's license records, credit agency data,
registries of property owners, tele-
phone directories, city directories, and
state and national mortality files.
This study was approved by the Uni-
versityofCalifornia,Davis,HumanSub-
jects Review Committee.
Statistical Analysis
The main outcome event was the first
occurrence of a charge for a new offense.
Observedincidencedensityratedatawere
used to estimate RRs by Poisson regres-
sion,15 with adjustment for sex, race, age
at purchase, and time since purchase, and
stratification by the type and number of
offenses for which subjects had previ-
ously been convicted. Interactions be-
tween the demographic variables and
criminal history were incorporated when
necessary.Confidenceintervals(CIs)were
calculatedusinglikelihoodmethods.Good-
ness of fit was assessed by likelihood ra-
tio statistics and residual analysis.
In a separate analysis, these results
were weighted to account for the hand-
gun purchasers who were known to have
a criminal history at the time of hand-
gun purchase but whose records had
been purged. This was accomplished as
follows. First, of all potential subjects

or conviction history at the time of hand-

eligible" persons whose criminal rec-
ords met all the CDOJ criteria for purg-
ing. Of these, 744 persons with at least 1
misdemeanor conviction had been en-
rolled as study subjects. We calculated,
on an age-, race-, and sex-specific basis,
theproportionofthe1301purge-eligible
persons who had prior misdemeanor
convictions and applied these propor-
tions to the 2555 handgun purchasers
whose records had been purged. We es-
timated on that basis that 1455 of these
2555 handgun purchasers had prior mis-
demeanor convictions.

In each separate analysis, the weights

TheseproceduresassumedthatCDOJ
staff, having determined which criminal
records were eligible for purging, exer-
cised no selection bias in determining
which records would actually be purged.
We therefore also conducted a sensitiv-
ity analysis to estimate the maximum ef-
fect due to potential selection bias, in
which we adopted the extreme assump-
tion that no purchaser whose record had
beenpurgedwaschargedwithanycrimi-
nal activity after handgun purchase.
RESULTS
By extrapolation from our samples,
weestimatethatof139 052handgunpur-
chasers younger than 50 years in Cali-
fornia in 1977, 13 750 (9.9%) had at least
1 prior misdemeanor conviction and
118 560(85.3%)hadnopriorcriminalhis-
tory. (The remaining handgun purchas-
ers had previously been arrested, but
had no prior convictions.) Our study
population of 5923 included 3128 hand-
gunpurchaserswhowereknowntohave
had at least 1 misdemeanor conviction
prior to handgun purchase and 2795 who
had no prior criminal history. Demo-
graphic differences between the study
groups,andbetweensubjectswhoserec-
ords were eligible for purging and hand-
gun purchasers whose criminal records
had been purged, were relatively minor
(Table 1).
Independent evidence of subjects'
continued residence in California for the
entire period of follow-up or to their
deaths was available for 77.8% of study
subjects. Another 9.6% of subjects were
confirmed as remaining in the state for
part of the follow-up period (median, 8.9
years).
Asoftheirdateofapplicationforhand-
gunpurchase,the3128handgunpurchas-
ers with at least 1 prior conviction for a
misdemeanor offense had amassed 7907
suchconvictionsintotal,including337for
nonviolent firearm-related offenses and
672 for violent offenses (Table 2). A total
of 1628 (52.0%) of 3128 persons had been
convicted of 2 or more offenses. In total,
15 868 criminal charges had been filed
againstthesehandgunpurchasers(Table
2). Felony charges had been filed against
1631 persons (52.1%), more than once for
826 persons (26.4%), and 576 persons
(18.4%) had been charged with a Violent
Crime Index offense.
In the first year of follow-up, 18.5% of
purchasers with at least 1 prior misde-
meanor conviction, and 1.6% of those
with no criminal history, were charged
with at least 1 new offense. By the end of
the study period these proportions had
risen to 50.4% and 9.8%, respectively
(Table 3). Multiple new arrest charges
were filed against 33.4% of purchasers
with at least 1 prior misdemeanor con-
viction and 5.1% of those with no prior
criminal history.
Handgun purchasers with at least 1
priormisdemeanorconvictionweremore
than 7 times as likely as purchasers with
no prior criminal history to be charged
with a new offense (RR, 7.5; 95% CI, 6.6-

and was moderately related to sex and
race(Table4).Menwerealsoatincreased

COMMENT
Under current federal law, persons
who have been convicted of misde-
meanor crimes, including violent crimes
and those involving firearms, generally
remain eligible to purchase handguns.
In our study population, handgun pur-
chasers with prior misdemeanor convic-
tions had substantially higher rates of
criminalactivityafterhandgunpurchase
than did purchasers with no prior crimi-
nal history. Overall a strong dose-re-
sponse relationship between extent of
prior criminal history and risk for later
criminal activity was observed. Hand-
gun purchasers who had more than 1
prior conviction for a violent offense
were more than 10 times as likely to be
charged with new criminal activity, and
15 times as likely to be charged with
murder, rape, robbery, or aggravated
assault, as were those with no prior
criminal history. But those whose prior
misdemeanorconvictionsdidnotinvolve
firearms or violence were also at in-
creased risk for those types of offenses
after handgun purchase. And handgun
purchaserswhohadpriorconvictionsfor
nonviolentfirearm-relatedoffensessuch
as carrying concealed firearms in public,
but none for violent offenses, were at in-
creased risk for later violent offenses.
Atthesametime,itisimportanttonote
that most handgun purchasers in this
study--approximately 50% of those with
a misdemeanor conviction at the time of
handgun purchase and more than 90% of
those with no prior criminal history--
were not charged with new criminal ac-
tivity after purchasing their handguns.
Our findings of a dose-response rela-
tionship and of an increase in risk for
new criminal activity among handgun
purchasers with relatively minor prior
criminalrecordsaresimilartothosefrom
studies of recurrent criminal behavior in
otherpopulations.9-12,17-19 Ourestimatesof
the low incidence of new criminal activ-
ity among handgun purchasers with no
prior criminal history also appear to be
similar to those from general population
studies.20-22 Thisisnotsurprising,asmore
than 40% of adults in the United States
liveinahouseholdwithfirearmsand25%
own a firearm themselves.23,24
We chose to require a conviction as
evidence of prior criminal activity and
used arrest as a measure of new criminal
activity. In the former case, our decision
isconsonantwithpublicpoliciespertain-
ing to the criminal history screening of
prospective handgun purchasers where
prior conviction (or felony indictment),
rather than arrest, is the standard on
which eligibility to purchase is deter-
mined. The use of arrest as a measure of
recurrentcriminalactivity,orrecidivism,
iscommonincriminologicresearch.9-12,17-22
The probability of type I error (class-
ifying a subject as having committed a
newcrimewhenhe/shehasnot)basedon
the use of arrest is considered to be sub-
stantially less than the probability of
typeIIerror(classifyingasubjectasnot
having committed a new crime when he/
she has) based on the use of convic-
tion.19,25
Criminal records had been purged for
a sizeable number of handgun purchas-
ers who would otherwise have been eli-
gibleforthisstudy.Thisinjectsalevelof
uncertainty into our final findings that
cannot be completely quantified. How-
ever, our weighted analysis and partic-
ularly our sensitivity analysis, which
relied on the extreme assumption that
none of these handgun purchasers was
charged with any crimes after handgun
purchase, still found that handgun pur-
chasers with prior misdemeanor convic-

Thequestionarisesofwhetherourre-
sults for persons who purchased hand-
guns in 1977 are applicable to present
handgun buyers. However, the criteria
under which our subjects passed a back-
ground check differ only slightly from
those that remain in force today at the
federal level and in most states.
Severalsourcesofconservatisminour
resultsdeservemention.First,handgun
purchaserswithpriormisdemeanorcon-
victions in other states would have been
classified by us as having no prior crimi-
nal history if those convictions did not
appear on their California criminal rec-
ords. Continuing criminal activity by
even a small number of such subjects
would have substantially increased the
observed rate of new criminal activity
among purchasers classified as having
no prior criminal history; the RRs re-
ported herein would then be underesti-
mates. Second, we were not able to pre-
sent results for offenses involving both
firearms and violence with which sub-
jects were charged, either before or af-
ter handgun purchase. In our data, only
18.7% of charges of assault with a deadly
weapon specified the type of weapon in-
volved, and only 5.3% were reported to
involve a firearm. Nationally, approxi-
mately 20% of such offenses involved a
firearm.26 Finally,westudiedonlythein-
cidence of first offenses following hand-
gunpurchaseanddidnotprovidedataon
the total number of new offenses with
which the handgun purchasers in our
study population were charged.
Long-standing federal and state stat-
utes deny the purchase of firearms to
persons who, as a result of their prior
criminal history or for other reasons, are
consideredtobeatunacceptablyhighrisk
for later criminal activity. Our findings
indicate that the characterization of high
risk also applies to handgun purchasers
with prior convictions for misdemeanor
offenses,regardlessofthenatureofthose
offenses. Whether or not that increased
risk is acceptable is a public policy deci-
sion.Wenotethatin1996,Congressacted
to deny handgun purchase to persons
withmisdemeanordomesticviolencecon-
victions.27 Californiaandotherstatesnow
include prior convictions for selected vio-
lent misdemeanors as grounds for denial
of handgun purchase.28
Expanding the criteria for denial of
handgun purchase would complicate the
process of screening prospective hand-
gun purchasers. The Brady Handgun
ViolencePreventionActof1994requires
that an "instant check" screening of pro-
spective handgun purchasers be imple-
mented.5 That system became opera-
tionalonNovember30,1998.Itwouldnot
befeasibleeitheratpresentorinthenear
future to implement an "instant check"
system to identify prospective handgun
purchasers with prior misdemeanor con-
victions.29,30
Results of a new nationwide survey
indicate that, depending on the nature of
the offense, as much as 95% of the popu-
lation--and 91% of gun owners--support
prohibiting the purchase of firearms by
persons convicted of misdemeanor
crimes.31 And there now is evidence that
denialofhandgunpurchasereducesthein-
cidence of subsequent criminal activity
among high-risk persons.32 These find-
ings might justify expanding the criteria
for denial of handgun purchase, even if a
waiting period for handgun purchase re-
mained necessary as a result.
