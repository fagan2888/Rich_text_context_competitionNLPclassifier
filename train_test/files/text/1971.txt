It has been suggested that the association between anthropo-
metric measures of adiposity (e.g., waist circumference (WC)
and body mass index (BMI)) and high blood pressure vary by
race.1 These anthropometric measures, however, only broadly
capture more complex underlying patterns of body composi-
tion and adiposity (e.g., visceral vs. subcutaneous adipose
tissue, upper body vs. abdominal fat), which also vary by sex
and race.2 Despite their relative lack of specificity with respect
to adiposity, techniques for assessing anthropometric meas-
ures such as BMI and WC are comparatively inexpensive and
widely accessible. Thus, further elucidation of how these rela-
tively simple measures are associated with disease remains
important.
The present study describes the association between WC and
systolic blood pressure (SBP), with a focus on how these rela-
tions may vary by race and sex, using a large nationally repre-
sentative sample of young adults in the United States. We focus
on SBP in the present study because, although associations
have been shown to vary by age,3 many studies have shown SBP
to be more important than diastolic blood pressure (DBP) with
respect to health risk,4­9 and also possibly more responsive than
DBP to changes in modifiable risk factors such as exercise, diet,
and weight loss.10 WC has been shown to add to the prediction
of visceral fat beyond measurements of BMI.11,12 Visceral adi-
pose tissue is an independent predictor of the metabolic syn-
drome in both men and women,13 and has also been found to
add to the prediction of hypertension.14,15 Following Tybor et
al.,16 we use statistical partialling to remove the effect of BMI
from the association between WC and SBP. WC partialled for
BMI reflects WC independent of overall body size, and thus,
by definition, must reflect body shape or body fat distribution.
We also allow for the possibility that these associations may be
nonlinear. Examination of these questions in this manner may
provide more precise information about the pathophysiology
underlying high blood pressure and also further guide risk
stratification in clinical practice.
Methods
Participants. The present study uses data from the Add Health
study, a nationally representative sample of ~15,000 young adults
that was designed to assess the effects of health-related behaviors
Background
Adiposity, or more specifically, underlying body fat distribution, has
been associated with systolic blood pressure (SBP), and it has been
suggested that these associations vary between whites and blacks,
as well as by gender.
Methods
Here, we use data from the National Longitudinal Study of
Adolescent Health (Add Health), a US study of over 15,000
participants (median age 29.0 years), to characterize the associations
between measures of body fat distribution--waist circumference
(WC) andWC adjusted for body mass index (BMI) (WC
-bmi
)--with SBP
within white and black race and gender subgroups.
Results
Our findings suggest that, at lower levels ofWC
-bmi
, white women
have significantly higher SBP as compared to black women, whereas
black men have higher SBP than white men. Black women with
WC
-bmi
>90cm have higher SBP compared to white women with
similarWC
-bmi
, whereas among black and white men the associations
are essentially similar across the full range ofWC
-bmi
.
Conclusions
The present results suggest that associations among anthropometric
measures of adiposity and blood pressure are nonlinear, and
importantly, vary for whites and blacks by gender. In black women,
SBP increased more asWC increased from low- to mid-range levels,
whereas it was only at higherWC levels that black men exhibited
higher SBP than white men.

during adolescence and into young adulthood. The study began
with adolescents were in grades 7­12 in the United States during
the 1994­1995 school year, and the cohort has been followed into
youngadulthoodwithfourin-homeinterviews.Thelastinterview
was in 2008 and the sample was aged 24­32. Add Health partici-
pants have been assessed with regard to an extensive number of
psychosocial variables, e.g., social, economic, and psychological
well-being. In addition, specific contextual data on the family,
neighborhood, and other social environments may be linked
to health outcomes in young adulthood. Wave four interviews
were expanded to collect biological data, e.g., blood pressure.
The Add Health study was reviewed and approved by the institu-
tional review board at the University of North Carolina­Chapel
Hill and written consent was obtained at all waves from either the
respondent or the parent if the respondent was under age 18. For
detailed information regarding the study and its design, please
see ref. 17. Data for the present study were collected at Wave IV, as
SBP was not assessed at prior Waves.
Measures. Age was recorded in years; and gender 0 = men;
1 = women. Race was self-identified, and coded as white = 0,
black = 1. education was coded as: 0 = some high school or
less, or G.E.D.; 1 = graduated high school; 2 = some college
or vocational-tech; 3 = bachelor's degree; 4 = some graduate
school or more.
For detailed information regarding assessment and reliabil-
ity of SBP, see ref. 18. Trained and certified field interviewers
measured respondents' resting, seated systolic and DBPs (mm
Hg) and pulse rate (beats/min). Following a 5-min seated rest
three serial measurements were performed at 30-s interval
using a factory calibrated, Microlife BP3MC1-PC-IB oscillom-
etric blood pressure monitor (MicroLife USA, Dunedin, FL).
SBP was constructed as the average of measures two and three.
For cardiac medication status, participants were first asked,
"Have you taken any medications in the last four weeks?" If the
respondent answered yes, they were asked to collect their med-
ications and the interviewer recorded a list of medications pro-
vided. We represented medication using a dichotomous yes/no
variable that included all classes of medication prescribed that
might lower blood pressure.
Height was measured to the nearest 0.5cm. Weight was
measured to the nearest 0.1kg. BMI was calculated: BMI (kg/
m2) = weight (kg)/height (m2). Height and weight were meas-
ured at Wave IV. WC was measured to the nearest 0.5cm at the
superior border of the iliac crest, including pregnant women.
Alcohol consumption was defined as: 0 = nondrinker; 1 =
occasional drinker, drink 2 or fewer days of the week; 2 = light
drinker, drink 5­7 days/week and drink 2 or fewer drinks (1 or
fewer if female); 3 = moderate drinker, drink 5­7 days/week, 3
drinks for males, 2 drinks for females; 4 = heavy drinker, drink
5­7 days/week, >3 drinks for males, >2 for females. Smoking
was represented by a dichotomous yes/no variable that indi-
cated whether or not the participant was a daily smoker.
Statistical analyses. Sample characteristics were described using
medians and interquartile ranges for continuous variables and
frequency and percentage for categories. In a preliminary anal-
ysis,weexaminedmeanSBPlevelsacrossraceandgenderusing
the general linear model. We then used ordinary least squares
regression to examine associations between body size variables
and SBP. In each model, we included age, level of education,
smoking, alcohol consumption, and use of cardiac medication
as adjustment variables. We estimated two regression models
the first included WC but not BMI, the second included both
WC and BMI. We modeled SBP, BMI, and WC as continuous
variables, allowing the effect of BMI and WC variables to be
nonlinear, using a three-knot restricted cubic splines,19 a flex-
ible nonparameteric smoother. Models contained two three-
way interaction terms, gender × race × waist and gender × race
× BMI, as well as all corresponding lower-order terms. BMI
and waist were allowed to be nonlinear within each interac-
tion term, again using a three-knot spline. The primary effects
of interest were the three-way interactions described above.
Regression models were weighted using the grand sample
weights, and within-school clustering was accounted for by
including the school cluster codes in the model as covariates.
The sample was limited to the 10,102 black and white study
participants. We further excluded participants who had miss-
ing data on the BMI or waist variables, or who had no sample
weight assigned. This resulted in a final sample size of 9,906
participants for the analysis. This small percentage (1.6%) of
missing data generally does not require imputation.20
Results
See Table 1 for presentation of sample characteristics. In an
initial analysis, we examined the levels of SBP across race and
gender, adjusting for age, level of education, cardiac medica-
tion use, smoking, and alcohol intake. The gender × race inter-
action was statistically significant (P < 0.001). Black women
had a higher predicted mean SBP of 123.8 (95% confidence
interval = 122.8, 124.9) mm Hg, compared to white women,
120.1 (95% confidence interval = 119.5, 120.8) mm Hg (Tukey's
adjusted P < 0.001). SBP also was slightly higher among black
men, 130.9 (95% confidence interval = 129.9, 132.0) mm Hg
compared to white men, 130.0 (95% confidence interval =
129.3, 130.6) mm Hg, though this difference was not statisti-
cally significant (Tukey adjusted P = 0.31).
In both regression models, which included WC and then
WC and BMI simultaneously, the race × gender × WC inter-
action term was statistically significant (P = 0.02, P = 0.03,
respectively).
In addition, in the full model, the race × gender × BMI inter-
action also was statistically significant (P < 0.001). Among the
adjustment covariables, cardiac medication, smoking, and
heavier alcohol intake were associated with higher SBP. Age
also was positively related to SBP, but was nonsignificant. See
Supplementary Appendix online for the regression results for
these latter variables. Regression weights from spline terms are
not readily interpretable, particularly when involved in interac-
tions. We therefore focus on interpreting the interaction graphi-
cally. The left panel of Figure 1 displays the association between
SBP and WC without adjustment for BMI for each race and

gender combination. When WC was relatively low (roughly
<70cm), Black and white women tended to have similar SBP.
At the middle range of WC (~70­100cm), however, the regres-
sion slope is somewhat steeper for black women than for white
women, with black women exhibiting higher SBPs across this
range, the races converging again at WC levels of about 140cm.
White and black men tended to have similar SBP when WC
was under ~100cm, but black men exceeded white men when
WC exceeded ~100cm. The right panel of Figure 1 displays
the predicted values for WC after adjusting for BMI (WC-bmi
).
White women with WC-bmi
lower than about 70cm had higher
SBP than black women in the same range, but their SBP slope

was relatively flat across the entire range of WC-bmi
. The slope
for black women was curvilinear, with the difference between
black and white women quickly becoming more pronounced
for WC-bmi
values greater than about 70cm. Black men with
WC-bmi
lower than about 70cm had higher SBP compared to
White men in the same WC-bmi range
, whereas the difference
diminishes after WC-bmi
approaches ~100cm. For both unad-
justed and adjusted analyses, the wide confidence limits for the
very high levels of WC and WC-bmi
reflect the relative sparse-
ness of the data in that region, thus limiting inferences for those
individuals with WC and WC-bmi
in that region.
Discussion
The present findings, in a large sample of young adults, suggest
that the relations between SBP and WC differ for whites and
blacks, as well as by gender, and that these associations are not
linear. In black women, SBP increased more as WC increased
from low- to mid-range levels. In contrast, it was only at higher
WC levels that black men exhibited higher SBP than white men.
Adjustment for BMI tended to amplify the difference between
black and white women, but diminish the race difference in
males. The additional predictive ability of WC might reflect
the involvement of fat depots more closely associated with WC
than BMI, such as visceral fat.11 Studies of more direct meas-
ures of visceral fat will be needed to test this hypothesis. Very
few studies appear to have examined both race and gender
differences with respect to BMI-adjusted WC and blood pres-
sure. Janssen et al.21 found that after adjustment for BMI, WC
remained a significantly associated with hypertension in both
men and women in a cohort of middle-aged adults (mean age
~43 years), but did not examine ethnic differences (nor is the
ethnic composition of the sample reported). Of strictly meth-
odological interest, Janssen et al. also showed that the use of
artificially categorized body size variable led to potential dis-
tortions in the estimation of associations. Tybor et al.'s16 lon-
gitudinal study did examine race and gender differences in the
association between BMI-adjusted WC and blood pressure and
found that changes in BMI-adjusted WC predicted changes in
SBP and DBP, but only in white women. In our cross-sectional
design, the association between BMI-adjusted WC and SBP
was actually weakest among white women. Among the criti-
cal differences between the present study and Tybor et al., is
that as the present study used data from young adults around
age 29, whereas Tybor et al. studied adolescents through the
periods of about age 11­19 years. Thus, differences in findings
across studies may reflect developmental differences in physiol-
ogy. It also may be that Tybor et al.'s longitudinal design may be
addressing a different question than the present study. Schaie22
for example, has long argued that cross-sectional data cannot
be extrapolated to within-person change.
Strengths of the present study include the large, well-

described group of participants taken from a nationally rep-
resentative sample and highly reliable measures of body shape
and blood pressure. The large sample also enabled us to exam-
ine relatively complex interactions with some confidence in
the power and precision of the estimates. Consequently, our

analytic approach allows for a richer, more nuanced descrip-
tion of the associations under study. There also are, however,
several limitations to our approach. First, as with all obser-
vational studies, unmeasured confounding or explanatory
variables may be producing spurious associations. Second, it
is simply not practical to examine all possible interdependent
effects. In other words, there may be other variables with which
race, gender, BMI, and WC interact, such as age, income, edu-
cation, alcohol intake, etc. To summarize, the mechanisms by
which WC confers additional cardiovascular risk are complex
and seem to differ between whites and blacks, as well as by race
and gender.
