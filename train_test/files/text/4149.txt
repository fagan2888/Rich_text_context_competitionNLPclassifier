Abstract
We report on the results of two online experiments designed to compare different soundtracks
that had been composed (by various researchers and sound designers) in order to evoke/match
different basic tastes. In Experiment 1, 100 participants listened to samples from 24 soundtracks
and chose the taste (sweet, sour, salty, or bitter) that best matched each sample. Overall, the
sweet soundtracks most effectively evoked the taste intended by the composer (participants chose
sweet 56.9% of the time for the sweet soundtracks), whereas the bitter soundtracks were the least
effective (participants chose bitter 31.4% of the time for the bitter soundtracks), compared with
chance (choosing any specific taste 25% of the time). In Experiment 2, 50 participants rated their
emotional responses (in terms of pleasantness and arousal) to the same 24 soundtrack samples
and also to imaginary sweet/sour/salty/bitter-tasting foods. Associations between soundtracks and
tastes were partly mediated by pleasantness for the sweet and bitter tastes and partly by arousal
for the sour tastes. These results demonstrate how emotion mediation may be an additional
mechanism behind sound-taste correspondences.

Introduction
In recent years, a growing body of empirical research has started to emerge demonstrating the
intriguing relationship between what we hear and what we taste. Naturally, part of this

relationship involves how the sounds of consumption affect the experience of eating, for
example, amplifying food crunching sounds has been shown to increase the perception of
crispiness of crisps (Zampini & Spence, 2004; see also Dematte
` et al., 2014, and Spence, 2015,
for a recent review). Another such area involves background noise and its impact on taste
perception (Spence, Michel, & Smith, 2014). For example, white noise mimicking the
conditions inside an airline cabin has been shown to selectively reduce the perceived intensity
of sweet tastes (Yan & Dando, 2015). Meanwhile, performing a vocal shadowing plus musical
distraction task can significantly impair participants' ability to discriminate the alcohol content
of a drink (Stafford, Agobiani, & Fernandes, 2013; see Spence, 2014, for a review).
Moving beyond environmental sounds and their impact on taste/texture/flavor perception,
one also has to consider the influence of crossmodal correspondences. These are the general
associations that people make between seemingly unrelated attributes (or dimensions) of
different sensory modalities (see Spence, 2011, for a review). A growing list of
correspondences have now been documented between specific sound and taste
attributes--such as, for example, between high pitch and sourness, or between low pitch
and bitterness (e.g., Crisinel & Spence, 2009, 2010; Mesz, Trevisan, & Sigman, 2011; see
Kno
¨ ferle & Spence, 2012, for a review).
As part of this growing movement to study sound-taste correspondences, a number of
researchers and sound designers have recently started to compose their own soundtracks to
match (or, in some sense, go together well with) specific tastes. Increasingly, such
soundscapes/soundtracks are being used in both scientific research and artistic
performances (e.g., Crisinel et al., 2012; Knoeferle, Woods, Ka
¨ ppler, & Spence, 2015;
Kontukoski et al., 2015; Mesz, Sigman, & Trevisan, 2012; Reinoso Carvalho, Van Ee,
Rychtarikova, Touhafi, Steenhaut, Persoone, & Spence, 2015; Reinoso Carvalho, Van Ee,
Rychtarikova, Touhafi, Steenhaut, Persoone, Spence, & Leman, 2015; Wang, 2013). Such
soundtracks could have either or both of the following aims: (a) to demonstrate a connection
between taste and sound in terms of participants being able to associate certain soundtracks
with specific tastes and (b) to alter the perceived taste of food and drink while participants
listen to such soundtracks.
While the connection between soundscapes and tastes (or taste words) can initially seem
surprising, it can also be seen as an extension of the power of music to express abstract ideas.
Many years ago, when Rigg (1937) tested how well a group of college students could interpret
the intended meanings of musical compositions, the participants could only reliably
distinguish between broad categories of joyful and sad music but were unable to
discriminate between more specific categories like farewell or mourning. More recently,
however, Watt and Quinn (2007) have shown that music can be reliably associated with
many higher level concepts, such as gender (i.e., male vs. female) and age (young vs. old).
The fact that certain soundtracks can be reliably matched to particular taste words
(e.g., Knoeferle et al., 2015; Mesz et al., 2012) demonstrates the strength of the crossmodal
correspondences that exist between sound/music and taste.
One potential explanation for such matching of sound/music with taste is emotion
mediation. That is, certain crossmodal correspondences may be explained by the common
emotional associations (such as pleasantness or arousal, see Collier, 1996, for a reduction of
emotion space down to two dimensions) of the various different stimuli involved. In general,
such a hedonic matching account between seemingly unrelated stimuli presented in
different sensory modalities has been suggested by a variety of sources (see e.g., Palmer,
Schloss, Xu, & Prado-Leo
´ n, 2013; Schifferstein & Tanudjaja, 2004; Velasco, Woods,
Deroy, et al., 2015; Velasco, Woods, Liu, et al., 2016). Relevant evidence pertaining to the
case of crossmodal correspondences between audition and taste has, however, been limited to
2 i-Perception 6(6)
the pleasantness account. In an experiment designed to test for any crossmodal mappings
between differently flavored chocolates (milk, marzipan, and dark) and sounds varying in
their pitch and timbre (i.e., by instrument type), Crisinel and Spence (2012) reported that
while their participants' choice of instrument could be predicted by the pleasantness ratings
they gave to the various chocolates, their choice of pitch was not. Besides pleasantness, to
date, no one has looked at the potential role of emotional arousal levels in crossmodal
correspondences between audition and taste.
Up until now, the soundtracks produced by various researchers and designers have never
been tested in the same setting. Furthermore, some of the soundtracks, such as those used in
Knoeferle et al. (2015) and Mesz et al. (2012), have only previously been tested in a
constrained context in which the participants were essentially given a four-alternative-
forced-choice task (i.e., with four soundtracks to listen to and four taste words to choose
from). Therefore, in Experiment 1, we tested a group of these recently created taste-inspired
soundtracks together in the same sound and taste word matching task. The participants were
free to choose any taste word they wished for each of the soundtracks, in order to determine
which of them exhibited the strongest association with a given taste. In Experiment 2, we used
the same soundtracks in order to measure the role of emotion as a possible mediator in the
soundtrack-taste matching task. We did not ask participants to match the soundtracks to
taste words but instead asked for their emotion ratings (for pleasantness and arousal) of the
soundtracks and of bitter/salty/sour/sweet-tasting foods. These emotional ratings were then
combined with the soundtrack-taste matching results from Experiment 1 in order to calculate
the potential role of pleasantness and arousal in mediating the crossmodal correspondence
between audition and taste.
Experiment 1
Methods
Participants. One hundred participants (51 women, 49 men) aged between 21 and 62 years
(M ¼ 34.06, SD ¼ 9.53) took part in the study. The participants gave their informed consent
and reported no cold or other impairment of their senses of smell, taste, or hearing. The
participants were recruited from Amazon's Mechanical Turk. The experiment was approved
by the central university research ethics committee of Oxford University (MSD-IDREC-C1-
2014-205).
Auditory stimuli. Twenty-four root-mean-square normalized soundtracks (McCarthy, 2007)
were used (five bitter, five salty, seven sour, and seven sweet). The soundtracks varied
originally from 30 seconds to 6 minutes in length. Since the soundtracks were generally
uniform in texture, we decided to use only the first 15 seconds of each soundtrack in order
to have uniform length auditory stimuli and to limit the overall length of the experiment.
Here is a brief description of the motivation and origins of the soundtracks, categorized by
composer/designer (in alphabetical order):
Condiment Junkie: A UK sound branding agency recently released an EP album of taste
soundtracks. We used excerpts of the sweet, sour, salty, and bitter soundtracks from the
album. Note that an earlier version of the sweet and bitter soundtracks had been used
previously in a study by Crisinel et al. (2012). There, the participants rated samples of
bittersweet toffee on a 7-point bitter-sweet scale while listening to the two sounds.
Their results revealed that the participants rated the cinder toffee samples (which came
from the same batch) significantly differently under the two auditory conditions. In the
same study, the two soundtracks were pretested in a control experiment in order to ensure
Wang et al. 3
that the participants rated the soundtracks differently on a 1 to 9 bitter-sweet scale.
As expected, the sweet soundtrack (M ¼ 6.68, SD ¼ 1.78) was rated as significantly sweeter
on the bitter-sweet scale than the bitter soundtrack (M ¼ 2.97, SD ¼ 1.14).
Jialing Deng and Harlin Sun: Designed a set of sweet, bitter, salty, sour, and umami
soundtracks for synesthetic appetizer, part of Deng's Masters of Arts Thesis project
(June, 2015). The stated aim was to create a narrative environment of a synesthetic world
by offering augmented eating experiences through crossmodal interactions. The soundtracks
were designed to evoke specific tastes, with the goal of helping those who suffer from some
form of sensory dysfunction and who might not otherwise be able to taste normally.
Evan Kassof: Designed sounds to match each of the four basic tastes. These sounds were
used in a citizen science experiment as part of the science museum cravings exhibit in
London, UK. The participants could either access the experiment at the gallery or online,
via the science museum's homepage or the cravings exhibition information page (http://
www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/visitmuseum/Plan_your_visit/exhibitions/cravings/cravings-exp
eriment.aspx). The sounds were composed from four basis soundtracks that, when combined
in different ratios, created composite soundtracks that varied in terms of their articulation,
pitch, loudness, and consonance (see Kno
¨ ferle & Spence, 2012, Table 1). In the science
museum experiment, the participants were presented with individual sounds and had to
match them to a taste word (sweet, bitter, sour, salty, umami, or else indicated that they
were unsure).
Klemens Knoeferle and Florian Kau
¨ ppler: Designed a set of taste soundtracks (sweet, bitter,
sour, and salty) inspired by Knoeferle et al.'s (2015, Experiment 1) study in which the
participants had to match a number of auditory parameters (attack, discontinuity, pitch,
roughness, sharpness, and speed) to basic taste words (bitter, sweet, salty, and sour). Based
on these results, low-level properties of a 30-second piece of synthesized music were
systematically manipulated in order to create soundtracks matching different tastes
(Knoeferle et al., 2015, Experiment 2). These soundtracks were then tested online with
participants from the United States and India in a matching task where all four
soundtracks and four taste words were presented as a group. On average, the North
American participants matched 1.75 sounds correctly while the Indian participants matched
1.38 sounds correctly (as compared with matching one sound correctly by chance).
Importantly, both groups performed at a level that was significantly better than chance.
Bruno Mesz: A group of musicians were initially asked to improvise on a MIDI keyboard
based on the taste words sweet, sour, bitter, and salty (Mesz et al., 2011). Based on those
improvisations, different loudness, pitch, duration, and articulation features were extracted
for each taste. Those features were then used to design an algorithm that automatically
generated music of specific tastes by combining fragments of classical and popular music
that matched the aforementioned auditory features (Mesz et al., 2012). Note here that Mesz
also composes his own pieces based on the same principles and uses his compositions for both
research and multisensory performances. Five pieces from Mesz were tested in the present
study (see Table 2 for details on each soundtrack).
Felipe Reinoso Carvalho: In collaboration with the Institute for Psychoacoustics and
Electronic Music at the University of Ghent, Reinoso Carvalho designed sweet and bitter
soundtracks. The soundtracks were produced by Tim Vets @ IPEM, UGent; coproduced by
Felipe Reinoso Carvalho, Sander de Keer, and Tomas Serrine; and mastered by Felipe
Reinoso Carvalho at sonictaste.flavours.me (2013).
The bitter and sweet soundtracks (along with a neutral soundtrack which was not used in
the present study) were used in a recent chocolate-tasting study (see Reinoso Carvalho, Van
Ee, Rychtarikova, Touhafi, Steenhaut, Persoone, Spence, & Leman, 2015). These
4 i-Perception 6(6)
soundtracks were designed to be congruent with the taste of bitter and sweet
chocolate, respectively. The soundtracks were inspired by Crisinel and Spence's
(2010; Crisinel et al., 2012) previous work.
The sounds were first tested in an online study by 78 participants, who rated the
soundtracks as significantly different on a 6-point bitter-sweet scale. During the actual
study, the participants first matched chocolate samples to the soundtracks and then tasted
the samples while listening to the soundtracks.
Qian (Janice) Wang: Designed a sour soundtrack for a study on the effect of taste-
congruent sounds on taste evaluation, as part of her masters' degree at the MIT Media
Lab (Wang, 2013). The soundtrack was composed in Ableton Live with features of high
pitch, fast tempo, and high dissonance (Mesz et al., 2011). The soundtrack consisted of notes
played by synthetic instruments. The pitch of the notes ranged from C2 to C6. During the
study, the participants listened to bitter, sweet, and sour soundtracks (bitter and sweet
soundtracks were the same as used in Crisinel et al., 2012) while rating juice samples in
terms of their bitterness, sweetness, and sourness.

Procedure. The experiment was programmed on the Xperiment experiment-design and hosting
platform.1 Before the actual study began, the participants specified their gender, age, country
of origin, and self-rated their musical expertise levels (the choices were none, amateur,
intermediate, or advanced). The participants had to listen to all 24 soundtracks in a
random order. After each soundtrack, the participants had to choose which basic taste
(sweet, sour, bitter, or salty) best matched the sound clip that they had just heard and rate
how confident they were in having decoded the correct taste on a scale from 0 to 100. The
presentation of taste choices was randomized for each trial.
The study lasted for approximately 10 minutes, and the participants were paid $1.20 USD
for taking part in the study.
Results
The choices for the best-matching taste word were tallied for each soundtrack (see Figure 1
for chart and Appendix A for a table listing the precise values). The soundtracks with the
highest rate of matching for each taste were as follows: for bitterness, Condiment Junkie
(42% of participants matched it with bitter, and they were 1.82 times more likely to match it
with bitter than with salty, the next most popular choice); for saltiness, Deng (58% of
participants matched it with salty and were 2.76 times more likely to match it with salty
than with sour, the next most popular choice); for sourness, Mesz­Tango (58% of
participants matched it with sour and were 1.76 times more likely to match it with sour
than with bitter, the next most popular choice); and for sweetness, Deng (89% of
participants matched it with sweet and were 14.83 times more likely to match it with sweet
than with salty, the next most popular choice). In comparison, had the participants been

responding randomly, 25% of them would have been expected to match each taste (bitter,
salty, sour, and sweet) to any given soundtrack.
Averaging over all of the soundtracks that were associated with each taste, 31.4% of the
participants' responses were correct for bitter soundtracks, 44.4% of participants' responses
were correct for salty soundtracks, 41.7% of the participants' responses were correct for sour
soundtracks, and 56.9% of participants' responses were correct for sweet soundtracks
(see Figure 2). A chi-square test for independence was conducted in order to assess
whether different taste words were chosen for different taste soundtracks, tallied over all of
the soundtracks that had been generated for each taste. The results indicated that the
different taste soundtracks influenced the choice of taste words (2(9, 2400) ¼ 720.62,
p < .0001). The strength of this effect, measured by computing Cramer's V, can be
classified as medium (V ¼ .32).
A chi-square test of goodness of fit was calculated for each soundtrack to determine which
of them induced a distribution of taste matches that was significantly different from chance.
In fact, out of the 24 soundtracks, only three had nonsignificant preferences in the choice of
taste matches (Knoeferle-bitter, Knoeferle-sour, Kassof-sweet). The resulting chi-square
values can be seen in Table 3. Out of the 21 soundtracks with nonrandom distributions of
responses, for 14 of them, the most chosen taste word was also the one intended by the
composer (see Figure 1).
To check that there was no response bias from the participants (i.e., there were not some
taste words that were simply chosen more frequently than others), we computed the total

were designed to evoke in Experiment 1. The chart reveals the distribution of participants' choice of taste

number of responses given to each taste word. There were a total of 595 bitter responses, 587
salty responses, 606 sour responses, and 612 sweet responses. A chi-square test of goodness of
fit was calculated and we did not find a distribution that was significantly different from
chance (2 (3, 2400) ¼ 0.62, p ¼ .89). In other words, we did not find any response bias from
the participants (Erlebacher & Sekuler, 1971).
Out of 100 participants, 29 identified themselves as having no particular musical
expertise, 51 identified themselves as amateurs, 17 identified as intermediates, and 3 as
advanced. The participants were assigned to two groups, those with no expertise
(29 people) and those with some expertise (71 people). For each soundtrack, we
performed a chi-square test of independence to determine whether there was an
association between musical expertise and choosing the intended taste word to match
the soundtracks (see Appendix B). Did musical expertise contribute to our participants'
ability to match tastes? Out of 24 soundtracks, only Mesz's sweet Makea soundtrack was
found to have a different distribution of right/wrong choices depending on the self-
reported musical expertise of the participant. In particular, a higher percentage of those
participants without musical expertise chose to match the soundtrack with sweetness than
participants with musical expertise.
The confidence ratings for each soundtrack are shown in Figure 3. Repeated measures
analysis of variance (ANOVA) testing was performed within each group of soundtracks
(categorized by taste) to determine if there are significant differences in confidence ratings
between soundtracks. We found significant differences in confidence ratings between
soundtracks in each group. For the bitter soundtracks, F(3.75, 371.0) ¼ 14.24, Z2 ¼ .126,

F(6, 594) ¼ 8.16, Z2 ¼ .076, p < .0005.
More specifically, for bitter soundtracks, participants were the least confident about their
taste word choice for the Deng bitter soundtrack compared with all other bitter soundtracks.
The participants were also less confident about the Condiment Junkie bitter soundtrack as
compared with the Reinoso Carvalho bitter soundtrack (p < .005 for all comparisons).
Ironically, the two bitter soundtracks that participants were the least confident
about--Deng and Condiment Junkie--were also the only soundtracks where bitter was
chosen by the highest percentage of participants. For salty soundtracks, participants were
significantly more confident about the Deng salty soundtrack than for Mesz and Knoeferle,
and more confident about the Condiment Junkie soundtrack than for Knoeferle (p < .05 for
all comparisons). This together with the fact that the Deng salty soundtrack was the most
matched with salty validates the effectiveness of the soundtrack in evoking salty tastes. For
sour soundtracks, participants were significantly more confident about their taste matches for
the Mesz­Tango soundtrack than for the Kassof, Wang, and Knoeferle soundtracks;
participants were also more confident about the Deng soundtrack as compared with the
Wang and Knoeferle soundtracks; finally, they were more confident about the Condiment
Junkie soundtrack than the Knoeferle soundtrack (p < .05 for all comparisons). The Mesz­
Tango soundtrack was also the one that was most frequently matched with sourness,
followed by the Deng soundtrack. For sweet soundtracks, participants were significantly
more confident about the Deng soundtrack than all other sweet soundtracks. In addition,
they were more confident about the Condiment Junkie soundtrack than all other sweet
soundtracks except for Deng's (p < .005 for all comparisons). As in the sour soundtrack
case, the Deng soundtrack was also the soundtrack that was matched most with sweetness,
followed by Condiment Junkie's soundtrack. All post-hoc comparisons used Bonferroni
corrections.
In summary, for the salty, sour, and sweet soundtracks, the soundtracks that were most
frequently matched with the tastes that had been intended by the composers were also those
where the participants were most confident about their choices. The only exception was for
the bitter soundtracks.
On average, the confidence levels for the bitter soundtracks were 57.80, SD ¼ 17.57, for
the salty soundtracks: M ¼ 64.50, SD ¼ 17.03, for the sour soundtracks: M ¼ 68.18,
SD ¼ 16.18, and for the sweet soundtracks: M ¼ 69.53, SD ¼ 15.78 (see Figure 4).
A repeated measures analysis of variance with Huynh-Feldt corrections was performed on
the average of the confidence ratings, where significant differences were found between the
confidence ratings F(2.59, 297) ¼ 51.01, p < .0005, Z2 ¼ 0.34. Specifically, pairwise
comparisons with Bonferroni corrections revealed that the confidence ratings for the bitter
soundtracks were significantly lower than for all of the other soundtracks (p < .0005 for all
comparisons), the confidence ratings for the salty soundtracks were significantly higher than
for the bitter soundtracks (p < .0005) but lower than for the sweet (p < .0005) and sour
(p ¼ .001) soundtracks, and confidence ratings for sour and sweet soundtracks were not
significantly different from each other, but both were significantly higher than for bitter
and salty.
Discussion
Overall, based on the taste-matching and confidence rating data, the results of the present
study demonstrate that out of 24 soundtracks (five bitter, five salty, seven sour, and seven
Wang et al. 11
sweet) the sweet soundtracks most effectively evoked the tastes intended by the composer
(i.e., sweetness), while the bitter soundtracks were the least effective. Specifically, 56.9% of
the participants' responses were correct for sweet soundtracks, and confidence ratings for
sweet soundtracks were significantly higher (M ¼ 69.53, SD ¼ 15.78) than for bitter and
salty soundtracks; on the other hand, 31.4% of participants' responses were correct for
bitter soundtracks, and confidence ratings were significantly lower for bitter soundtracks
(M ¼ 57.80, SD ¼ 17.57) than for all other soundtracks. The reason why our participants
found it easiest to match soundtracks to sweetness is possibly because, out of all the
tastes, people typically like sweetness most (Robin, Rousmans, Dittmar, & Vernet-Maury,
2003). Unlike the other tastes, sweetness is almost always pleasant, so perhaps there is a
straightforward association here for participants with music and soundscapes that they
find pleasant, whereas all the other tastes become associated with unpleasant music. In
addition, it is perhaps worth noting that sweetness is the only taste term that is also used
in musical notation, that is, dolce, meaning to play in a gentle, sweet style (see Fallows,
2015). Therefore participants--especially those with musical training--might more readily
associate music with sweetness (though, it should be said, we did not observe this in the
present study). Furthermore, our finding that sweetness somehow stands out from other
tastes does not only apply to sound-taste correspondences; in shape-taste matching
studies, sweetness is consistently matched to round shapes, whereas all of the other
tastes are consistently matched to shapes that are more or less angular (Velasco et al.,
2015, 2016).
Looking more closely at Table 1, we can try to deduce why certain soundtracks were more
highly matched with tastes other than the one that had been intended by the composer.2 For
instance, the Reinoso Carvalho bitter soundtrack was the only nonlegato bitter soundtrack
and it was matched mostly with salty or sweet tastes. Similarly, Mesz­Makea, the only
nonconsonant sweet soundtrack, was rated as more bitter than sweet.
Given the above-chance results of participants in matching soundtracks to their
intended tastes, we were curious whether emotion played a role in mediating the
associations between the soundtracks and tastes, and whether the degree and type
(pleasantness or arousal) of emotion mediation differed for each basic taste. These
questions are addressed in Experiment 2.

Experiment 2
Methods
Participants. Fifty participants (21 women, 29 men) aged between 20 and 64 years (M ¼ 35.71,
SD ¼ 11.30) took part in the study. The participants gave their informed consent and
reported no cold or other impairment of their senses of smell, taste, or hearing. The
participants were recruited from Amazon's Mechanical Turk (Buhrmester et al., 2011;
Crump et al., 2013). The experiment was approved by the central university research ethics
committee of Oxford University (MSD-IDREC-C1-2014-205).
Procedure. The experiment was programmed on the Xperiment experiment-design and hosting
platform. Before the actual study began, the participants specified their gender, age, country
of origin, and self-rated their musical expertise levels (the choices were none, amateur,
intermediate, or advanced). The participants had to listen to all 24 soundtracks in a
random order. After each soundtrack, the participants had to rate how pleasant and how
energizing/exciting they found the soundtrack, each on a scale from 0 to 100. At the end of
the test, participants were also asked how pleasant and how energizing/exciting they found
bitter/salty/sour/sweet-tasting foods.
The study lasted for approximately 10 minutes, and the participants were paid $1.20 USD
for taking part in the study.
Results
The mean pleasantness and arousal ratings for each soundtrack are shown in Figure 5. The
mean pleasantness and arousal ratings for foods of a given taste are shown in Figure 6.
To analyze the role of pleasantness and arousal in mediating the matching
between soundtracks and a given taste (T), we used the method documented in
Schifferstein and Tanudjaja (2004). For each of the 24 Â 4 ¼ 96 possible soundtrack-
taste combinations, we calculated the absolute difference between the mean pleasantness
rating of the soundtrack and the mean pleasantness rating of the given taste. We then
calculated the correlation between this soundtrack-taste difference and the % of responses
that matched the given taste to the soundtrack. If the pleasantness of a taste T and of a
soundtrack S influenced the way people matched T and S, then we would expect the
measure of pleasantness difference between taste T and soundtrack S to be negatively
related to the % responses that match taste T to soundtrack S. The same procedure was
repeated for arousal.
For pleasantness, Pearson correlation coefficients of À0.85 (p < .0005) were observed for
bitterness, À0.15 (p ¼ .48) for saltiness, 0.53 (p ¼ .008) for sourness, and À0.84 (p < .0005) for
sweetness (see Figure 7(a) for plots). This suggests that pleasantness partly mediates the
soundtrack-taste correspondence for bitterness and sweetness.
As far as arousal was concerned, Pearson correlation coefficients of 0.19 (p ¼ .39) were
obtained for bitterness, À0.323 (p ¼ .12) for saltiness, À0.60 (p ¼ .002) for sourness, and 0.67
(p < .0005) for sweetness (see Figure 7(b) for plots). This suggests that arousal partly mediates
the soundtrack-taste correspondence for sourness.
Furthermore, we calculated partial correlation coefficients to assess whether the effects for
pleasantness and arousal are independent. The coefficient for pleasantness remained
significant for the soundtrack-bitter taste (r ¼ À.78, p < .0005) and soundtrack-sweet taste
Wang et al. 13
(r ¼ À.72, p < .0005) matches when it was controlled for the effect of arousal. Similarly, the
coefficient for arousal (r ¼ À.53, p ¼ .009) remained significant for soundtrack-sour taste
matches when the effect of pleasantness was controlled for.
General Discussion
The results of Experiments 1 and 2 demonstrate that participants performed at an above-
chance level in matching soundtracks to their intended tastes, and that pleasantness and

arousal partially mediated this sound-taste association. So then, to summarize, what are the
factors governing people's associations of these soundtracks with basic tastes (taste words)?
First and foremost, the studies where many of the soundtracks originated have already
demonstrated associations between auditory parameters and tastes (Bronner, Frieler,
Bruhn, Hirt, & Piper, 2012; Crisinel & Spence, 2009, 2010; Mesz et al., 2011; see Knoferle
& Spence, 2012, for a review). For instance, bitterness appears to be associated with sounds
that are low in pitch (Crisinel & Spence, 2009; Knoeferle et al., 2015; Mesz et al., 2011);
interestingly, Condiment Junkie's bitter soundtrack, the most effective bitter soundtrack, also
had the lowest pitch of all the bitter soundtracks (in fact, it had the lowest pitch of all 24 of
the soundtracks). It has also been shown that the sound of the piano is most closely matched
with sweetness (Crisinel & Spence, 2010); the Deng sweet soundtrack, which was matched
with the word sweet by 89% of participants, makes liberal use of consonant high piano notes
in the composition.
In addition, an important role of emotional mediation was also highlighted. As shown by
the results of Experiment 2, pleasantness partly mediates soundtrack-taste matches for

sweetness and bitterness, while arousal partly mediates soundtrack-taste matches for
sourness. Whether intentional or not, the soundtrack designers seem to have captured
some emotional aspects of tastes in their soundtracks. For instance, sweet soundtracks
tend to be pleasant, whereas bitter soundtracks tend to be unpleasant. As for sour
soundtracks, they tend to be the most arousing/exciting of all the soundtracks.
Lastly, some of the soundtracks--such as those by Condiment Junkie and Deng--also
used semantic associations in the form of salt shaker sounds in the salty soundtrack (in fact,
the prominent salt shaker sound in the background of Deng's soundtrack might have been
the reason why it had the highest matching rate--58%--out of all the salty soundtracks). In
light of the emotion mediation results from Experiment 2, it is interesting to note that
saltiness is the only taste whose crossmodal correspondence with the soundtracks does not
appear to be mediated by pleasantness or arousal. Perhaps this is why the use of straight-
forward semantic associations was so effective for the salty soundtracks. On the other hand,
relying on semantic associations obscures crossmodal correspondences that are yet to be
discovered between sounds and saltiness. In the future, it may be useful for researchers
and designers to focus their energy on a creating a salty soundtrack which does not
involve salt shaker sounds!
Incidentally, it is interesting to note that for three out of the seven sour soundtracks, bitter
and sour constituted the majority of the responses (for instance, Mesz­tango had 58
responses for sour and 33 responses for bitter, Deng's sour soundtrack had 50 responses
for sour and 32 for bitter. See also Figures 1 and 2). Relevant here are previous findings that
people tend to confuse sour and bitter more than the other tastes (e.g., Meiselman &
Dzendolet, 1967; O'Mahony, Goldenberg, Stedmon, & Alford, 1979). So, for instance,
O'Mahony et al. found that when participants were asked to apply taste adjectives (sweet,
sour, salty, and bitter) to actual taste solutions, the most common error was calling the citric
acid solution bitter instead of sour. In the context of the present study, the sour soundtracks
might have evoked the idea or sensation of sourness, but for those participants who associate
the feeling of sourness with the word bitter, they might have chosen to match the soundtracks
with bitterness instead of sourness. A follow-up experiment in which the participants are
asked to match soundtracks with unlabeled taste solutions as opposed to taste words would
verify whether the sour-bitter confusion contributed to many sour soundtracks being labeled
as bitter.
To be fair, some of the soundtracks--such as those created by Knoeferle and
Kassof--were designed as a set in which some auditory parameters varied over the same
melody (while others remained constant). This may not be as effective when participants are
asked to match the sounds to tastes without having the relevant context (in Knoeferle et al.'s,
2015, study, e.g., the participants heard all four sounds and were asked to make a one-to-one
mapping with the four taste words), which might account for why we did not observe a
distribution of responses that was significantly different from chance for some of the
soundtracks by Knoeferle and Kassof.
In addition, a possible limiting factor in the design of the present study was the fact that
we only used a 15-second excerpt from each soundtrack. One could argue that, because we
did not use the soundtracks in their entirety, the excerpts that were sampled might not have
been the ideal (most informative) sections for matching with the desired tastes. Our decision
to limit the length of each sound sample was designed to avoid participant fatigue. As all the
soundtracks were looping and fairly uniform in texture, it should not make a difference where
we sampled the music. To be sure, this is quite different from traditional music where there is
a defined beginning, middle, and end. For taste, music is usually atmospheric and hence has
more of a repetitive nature.We thought the first 15 seconds should be sufficient to evoke the
Wang et al. 17
desired tastes, especially for the soundtracks used in experiments involving tasting real food
products (soundtracks by Condiment Junkie, Mesz, Reinoso Carvalho, and Wang), where
participants should feel the effect of matched taste as soon as possible.
Lastly, the present results highlighted an example of the role that musical expertise can
play in matching music with tastes. For Mesz's sweet Makea piece, those with no musical
experience were significantly more likely to match it to sweetness than those with musical
experience (for whom bitterness was the most common choice). This was potentially because
Makea features dissonant chords and high pitched piano instrumentation; as musical novices
tend to focus on timbre while those with musical experience tend to focus on melody and
harmony (Wolpert, 1990), perhaps novices matched the high-pitched piano sounds to
sweetness, while more experienced listeners matched the dissonant chords to bitterness.
This highlights the importance for future compositions to have consistent musical features
across all levels of music cognition.
The recent explosion of studies and performances that have attempted to bring together
sound and taste demonstrate the level of interest in sonic seasoning, by which sound can be
used to alter the taste of a dish. This study contributes to the effort by validating which
soundtracks that people can reliably match to tastes. Once these correspondences are found,
one can then study any perceptual effects of these soundtracks on the taste of real foodstuffs.
From the soundtracks studied here, the earlier versions of bitter and sweet soundtracks by
Condiment Junkie have been shown to significantly change people's ratings of toffee on a
bitter-sweet scale (Crisinel et al., 2012). Meanwhile, the bitter and sweet soundtracks
generated by Reinoso Carvalho were used in a chocolate-tasting study in which the sweet
soundtrack significantly changed people's rating of bitter chocolate on a bitter-sweet scale
(Reinoso Carvalho, Van Ee, Rychtarikova, Touhafi, Steenhaut, Persoone, Spence, & Leman,
2015). It remains to be seen whether the most effective soundtracks here, such as Mesz' sour
tango soundtrack or Deng's sweet soundtrack, can lead to measurable taste modifications.
Surely, in the years to come, the demand for future research into sound-taste
correspondences will only increase, especially in the light of recent studies showing how
customers are willing to pay significantly more for food/drink when it is accompanied by
matching multisensory stimuli than without (Michel, Velasco, Gatti, & Spence, 2014;
Reinoso Carvalho, Van Ee, Rychtarikova, Touhafi, Steenhaut, Persoone, & Spence, 2015).
The hope is that this type of comparative study will help guide design decisions for
soundtracks and experiments as more people explore this intriguing area between sound
and taste.
