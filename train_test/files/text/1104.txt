Objective: To determine if television viewing is asso-
ciated with the risk of initiating sexual intercourse in
young adolescents.
Design: Secondary analysis of data obtained from 1994
through 1996.
Setting: The National Longitudinal Study of Adoles-
cent Health.
Participants: The 4808 students younger than 16 years
whohadnotinitiatedintercoursebeforebaselineinterview.
Exposures: Primary exposure was self-reported daily tele-
vision watching, categorized as low (2 hours) or high
(2 hours) use. Secondary exposure was parental regu-
lation of television programming watched.
Main Outcome Measure: Odds ratio for initiating in-
tercourse by 1-year follow-up, adjusted for potential con-
founders.
Results: At baseline, 2414 (48.8%) subjects watched tele-
vision 2 or more hours per day. By 1-year follow-up, 791
(15.6%) subjects had initiated intercourse. Sexual ini-
tiation was associated with high television use (ad-
justed odds ratio, 1.35; 95% confidence interval, 1.01-
1.79) and lack of parental regulation of television
programming (adjusted odds ratio, 1.35; 95% confi-
dence interval, 1.01-1.80). Most subjects (73.8%) re-
ported strong parental disapproval of sex; their overall
rate of initiation was 12.5%, and their risk was indepen-
dently associated with high television use (adjusted odds
ratio, 1.72; 95% confidence interval, 1.24-2.40) and lack
of parental regulation of television programming (ad-
justed odds ratio, 1.35; 95% confidence interval, 1.01-
1.81). Among adolescents who did not report strong pa-
rental disapproval, the rate of sexual initiation was higher
(24.1%) but unrelated to television use.
Conclusion: Among young adolescents who reported
strong parental disapproval of sex, watching television
2 or more hours per day and lack of parental regulation
of television programming were each associated with in-
creased risk of initiating sexual intercourse within a year.

INITIATION OF SEXUAL INTER-
course by younger adolescents is
associated with risky sexual be-
haviors and increases the risk of
multiplepartners,unwantedpreg-
nancy, sexually transmitted infections, and
pelvic inflammatory disease.1-5 Several pre-
dictors of sexual intercourse during early
adolescentyearshavebeenidentified.These
predictors include early puberty, poor self-
esteem, depression, poor academic perfor-
mance, being less religious, low parental
education, lack of attentive and nurturing
parents, and cultural and family patterns of
earlysexualexperience.6-12 Exposuretotele-
vision is another proposed factor.13,14 Al-
though television watching appears to be
useful in predicting certain behaviors, most
notably violent behavior,15 it is less clear
whether television watching is linked to
sexual behavior.
Survey research results demonstrate
that television programming watched by
adolescents contains high levels of sexual
content, includes little information about
sexual risks, and is an important source
of information about sex for adoles-
cents.16-18 Results of a 2005 Kaiser Family
Foundation survey showed that the mean
amount of television watched per day was
more than 3 hours for teens aged 11 to 14
years and about 2.5 hours for those aged
15 to 18 years.19 Content analysis demon-
strates that 70% of the programs favored
by teenagers include sexual content.18
Moreover, adolescents aged 13 to 15 years
rank entertainment media as their leading
source of information about sexuality
and sexual health.16 Almost 75% of 15- to
17-year-olds believe that sexual content on
television influences the behavior of their
peers "somewhat" or "a lot."17
As recently reviewed by Escobar-
Chaves et al,14 few studies have directly ad-
dressed the question of whether adoles-
cent exposure to television affects sexual

behavior, and only 2 have been based on longitudinal
data.20,21 Peterson et al21 found some evidence for a re-
lationship between amount of television viewed and sexual
experience in certain subgroups of adolescents. In the
other study, Collins et al20 found that viewing more sexual
content on television was associated with an increased
1-year risk of sexual initiation.
We performed a secondary analysis of longitudinal data
from a large nationally representative sample of adoles-
cents to determine whether self-reported hours of tele-
vision viewed was associated with initiation of sexual in-
tercourse in young adolescents (aged 16 years) during
the subsequent year. We also studied whether parental
regulation of television programming was associated with
risk of initiation. We hypothesized that adolescents would
be more likely to initiate intercourse within 1 year if they
(1) watched more television or (2) lacked a parental rule
about television programming.
METHODS
SAMPLE
We used data from waves 1 and 2 of the National Longitudinal
Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health).22 The sampling frame
was all high schools in the United States that had an 11th grade
and at least 30 students. A systematic, random sample of 80
high schools and 52 associated feeder schools from across the
United States was then selected, stratified according to region,
urbanicity, school type, ethnic composition, and school size.
Subjects were weighted on the basis of the complex sampling
design to establish a representative cohort of all 7th through
12th grade students in the United States.23 In Add Health, 20 745
of the original in-school sample were randomly selected for in-
home interviews, conducted in 1995, which included ques-
tions about more sensitive health behaviors. Of these, 16 706
were selected for a second interview approximately 1 year later,
and 13 568 completed the interview and received a weight. Me-
dian interval between baseline and follow-up interviews was
11 months (interquartile range, 10-12 months). Adolescents
who were younger than 16 years at baseline interview and com-
pleted 2 interviews (n=7063) were included in our study if they
reported at baseline interview that they had never had sexual
intercourse (n=5518), if they provided information about the
primary exposure of interest (hours of television per week,
n=5497), and if covariate data were complete (n=5178). Be-
cause of small sample sizes of other races/ethnicities, we fur-
ther restricted our analysis to subjects who reported their race/
ethnicity as non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, or Hispanic
(n=4808).
MEASURES
Exposure Variables
Hours of television watched per day at baseline interview was
the primary exposure of interest and was calculated from self-
reported hours (0-99) of television watched per week. We chose
to categorize television use as low (2 h/d) or high (2 h/d).
A cutoff of 2 h/d was selected to correspond to the American
Academy of Pediatrics24 recommended limit for children's tele-
vision exposure. Two hours per day was also the median daily
television exposure for subjects in our sample. In our final mod-
els, we explored television hours parameterized as a continu-
ous variable and used an alternate categorization scheme to look
for a dose-response effect by using the following categories of
hours of television watched: 0 to less than the 25th percentile,
25th to less than the 50th percentile, 50th to less than the 75th
percentile, 75th to less than the 90th percentile, and 90th per-
centile or greater.
Parental monitoring was a secondary exposure of interest.
At baseline interview, subjects were asked if their parents al-
low them to make their own decisions about which television
programs they watch. We refer to adolescents as having a con-
tent rule if they answered no to this question. Subjects were also
asked if they made their own decisions about how much tele-
vision they watch, but we excluded this amount rule variable
from our final models because of the concern that it may be
highly correlated with hours of television viewed.
Outcome Variable
Initiation of sexual intercourse (defined as penile-vaginal in-
tercourse) was the primary outcome of interest and was re-
ported (yes/no) at follow-up interview. Answers to this and other
sensitive questions were obtained by using a confidential com-
puter-assisted self-interviewing system and were entered into
a laptop computer.
Covariates
Sociodemographic variables included in this analysis were age
(years/months) at baseline interview, sex, race/ethnicity, and
maternal education. Race/ethnicity was self-reported and cat-
egorized as non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, or His-
panic. Maternal education was reported by the resident mother
or mother figure for most subjects or, otherwise, by the sub-
ject; responses were classified as less than high school, high
school graduate, more than high school, or college or more.
Parental presence was assessed by asking each respondent how
frequently his/her mother or father was present before school,
after school, and at bedtime. We created a dichotomous vari-
able that defined decreased parental presence at home as occur-
ring when a parent was sometimes, almost never, or never pres-
ent at any of these times. Perceived parental tolerance of
intercourse was measured by asking subjects at baseline inter-
view if mother and/or father would approve of them having sex
at this time of life. If subjects reported anything other than strong
disapproval they were placed in the category of does not per-
ceive strong parental disapproval of sex. Depression was as-
sessed using the sum of responses to 19 items selected from
the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale, which
measures depressive symptoms in the community and has been
validated in junior and senior high school students.25,26 Higher
scores indicated more depressive symptoms. For the purposes
of our study, we defined depression as scoring in the top quar-
tile on this scale. Self-esteem was assessed by summing 6 of 10
items modified from the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Inventory, which
has good reliability (Cronbach =.86).7 We defined low self-
esteem as a score below the median. Subjects were asked to as-
sess the importance of religion by using a 5-point scale. We re-
coded these answers and created a dichotomous variable that
classified as less religious all who did not respond that religion
was very important. Educational aspirations were measured with
a question asking subjects to rank on a scale of 1 to 5 how likely
it is that they will go to college. We recoded answers dichoto-
mously and placed subjects who did not answer highly likely
in the category of less likely to attend college. Other potential
covariates that were explored in the univariate analyses but ex-
cluded from multivariate models were taking a virginity pledge
(yes/no), intelligence as measured by means of the Add Health
Picture Vocabulary Test, and pubertal status.

DATA ANALYSIS
Data were weighted by using commercially available software
(Stata version 9.0; Stata Corp, College Station, Tex) according
to Add Health recommendations to account for complex sam-
pling design.27 We performed univariate and multivariate lo-
gistic regression analyses to examine the relationship between
baseline television viewing and 1-year initiation of sexual in-
tercourse. Preliminary analysis demonstrated that this rela-
tionship varied according to parental attitude toward adoles-
cent engagement in sexual intercourse; therefore, we stratified
subsequent analyses according to this variable. We chose to in-
clude only covariates that appeared to be related to primary ex-
posure and outcome in univariate analysis or that had been in-
cluded in previous literature on this subject. We tested for 2-way
multiplicative interactions between amount of television watched
and all other covariates at the P.01 level.
RESULTS
Our final study sample (n=4808) included approxi-
mately equal numbers of male and female subjects and
had significantly more whites than blacks or Hispanics.
Subjects in the final sample watched television a mean
of 2.5 h/d and a median of 2.0 h/d. Table 1 shows se-
lected characteristics of subjects. We stratified analyses
according to parental attitude toward sex (strong disap-
proval vs all others) on the basis of differences between
the 2 groups in the relationship between television watch-
ing and sexual initiation (Table 2).
HOURS OF TELEVISION WATCHED
Overall, subjects who watched television 2 or more hours
per day were more likely to initiate sex within 1 year (ad-
justed odds ratio [aOR], 1.35; 95% confidence interval
[CI], 1.01-1.79). Table 3 shows that this relationship
was even stronger (aOR, 1.72; 95% CI, 1.24-2.40) for sub-
jects who reported strong parental disapproval of sex. We
failed to find a statistically significant relationship be-
tween watching television 2 or more hours per day and
1-year sexual initiation for subjects who did not report
strong parental disapproval (Table 3).

PARENTAL REGULATION OF TELEVISION
PROGRAMMING (CONTENT RULE)
Lack of parental regulation of television programming
was significantly associated with 1-year sexual initia-
tion in subjects who reported strong parental disap-
proval of sex, and the relationship persisted after con-
trolling for multiple possible confounders (Table 3).

school or less, being less religious, and being more de-
pressed. For subjects who reported anything other than
strong parental disapproval of sex, 1-year initiation of
sexual intercourse was independently associated (P.05)
with increased age at baseline interview and being black.

COMMENT
We used longitudinal data to examine the relationships
between amount (hours per day) of television viewing
and parental regulation of content on sexual initiation.
Studying data in a large, nationally representative sample
of young adolescents, we found a positive association be-
tween viewing television 2 or more hours per day and
the subsequent 1-year risk of initiation of sexual inter-
course in adolescents who report strong parental disap-
proval of sex. We also found that lack of parental regu-
lation of television programming was associated with
increased 1-year risk of sexual initiation in these adoles-
cents. The magnitude of these associations remained con-
stant after controlling for multiple potential confound-
ers. Although we failed to find any statistically significant
interaction between the amount of television watched and
parental regulation of content, we found that among sub-
jects who reported strong parental disapproval of sex, the
rate of initiation was highest among those who watched
television 2 or more hours per day and had no content
rule and that the risk of sexual initiation was approxi-
mately twice that observed in subjects who watched less
television and reported a content rule.
Our finding that hours of television viewed is associ-
ated with 1-year sexual initiation differs somewhat from
results of the 2 other longitudinal studies available on
this subject.20,21 Peterson et al21 found a positive, but in-
consistent, relationship between hours of television
watched and sexual initiation for boys; however, this study
was based on television viewing data from the 1970s,
which may not reflect more recent programming. Col-

lins et al20 reported that the amount of sexual content
viewed, but not hours of television watched, was a sig-
nificant risk factor for sexual initiation. This finding was
based on a multivariate model that, by design, retained
separate variables for amount of television watched and
amount of sexual content watched.20 Because we did not
have any data available on the sexual content of pro-
grams watched by the subjects in our study, it is difficult
to compare our results directly with those of Collins et al.20
Previous research results showed that adolescent per-
ception of parental attitude toward sex is related to sexual
initiation.28,29 On the basis of our results, we hypoth-
esize that for adolescents who do not perceive strong pa-
rental disapproval of sex and are already at higher risk
for sexual initiation, television may not have affected their
behavior. However, for adolescents who perceive strong
parental disapproval of sex and are at lower risk for sexual
initiation, contradictory messages, such as those seen on
television, may be more influential.
Although results of our study and those of Collins et
al20 provide evidence that television watching increases
the risk of sexual initiation by adolescents, neither study's
results resolve the question of whether attempting to con-
trol content or limit amount of television watched would
be most likely to reduce this risk. Limiting amount of tele-
vision may be easier and more effective than limiting con-
tent, given the pervasiveness of sexual content in televi-
sion programming.18 In addition, unlike limiting content,
limiting the amount of television children watch may have
collateral benefits such as prevention of obesity30 and re-
duction in aggressive behavior.31
We found that adolescents in the top 10th percentile
of television viewing (5 h/d) were not at increased risk
of sexual initiation. This result provides support for a theo-
retical babysitter effect20 or displacement effect in which
certain adolescents may spend extraordinary amounts of
time viewing television and are therefore less likely to
participate in other activities or to initiate sexual activ-
ity. Failure to account for such an effect may distort at-
tempts to understand the true effect of increased televi-
sion watching, especially if amount of television is
modeled as a continuous variable.
We found that lack of a content rule was associated
with 1-year sexual initiation only among adolescents who
reported strong parental disapproval of sex, a result re-
lated to that of Peterson et al,21 who found that coview-
ing television and discussing television with parents were
related to decreased sexual initiation in certain adoles-
cents. These results support the hypothesis that paren-
tal regulation of television viewing may affect television-
related outcomes in some adolescents.
Effects of parental regulation have been studied pre-
viously. Although results of some studies showed that
certain types of regulation are associated with differ-
ences in television-related behavior,32-34 additional re-
search is needed to understand whether mediation of tele-
vision use by parents might influence television-related
sexual behavior.
Strengths of this study include use of a data set that is
longitudinal, provides a nationally representative sample,
and has good measures of individual and family charac-
teristics that are important control variables. Using lon-
gitudinal data eliminates the potential for reverse cau-
sality, a possible problem in cross-sectional studies.35,36
The generalizability of our study results is strengthened
by the comparability of mean hours of television watched
in our sample to that in other large nationally represen-
tative samples.19
Our study has several limitations. First, the available
measure of television exposure, a self-reported global es-
timate, was crude and may be less accurate than a view-
ing diary or other format that includes more than 1 mea-
sure across time. We recommend that future surveys
designed to explore determinants of adolescent health in-
clude more extensive questions to establish the quan-
tity and quality of adolescent exposure to multiple types
of media. Second, although we adjusted for many poten-
tial confounders, our results still may be subject to re-
sidual confounding due to unmeasured social or envi-
ronmental factors. In particular, rules about television
content may be a proxy measure for parental willing-
ness to monitor other behaviors that may be associated
with the risk of sexual initiation. Third, available data
provided no direct measure of the content of television
programming watched. Although this is an important limi-
tation given the diversity of programming that different
adolescents are likely to select, it is still reasonable to as-
sume that those who watch more television will see more
sexual content given the high level of sexual content in
shows that adolescents watch. Fourth, our outcome mea-
sure was limited to sexual intercourse defined as vaginal/
penile intercourse, and we had no information on oral
sex or other types of sexual behavior that are increas-
ingly prevalent among teens. Future surveys should in-
clude questions about other types of sexual behavior. Fifth,
because we excluded those who had already initiated in-
tercourse, we necessarily selected for subjects who were
slightly younger, included somewhat more female and
white subjects, included fewer black subjects, and had a
higher maternal educational status (data not shown). Fi-
nally, the data used for the study were almost 10 years
old, and the sexual content of television programming
has changed over that time.18 In addition, as adolescents
have increasing sources of media available to them, such
as the Internet, the amount of television they watch and
its role in their lives may be changing.19
The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that
children and adolescents view television no more than
2 hours each day and that parents take an active role in
guiding television use.24,37 Although there is limited evi-
dence about the effectiveness of these recommenda-
tions, our results suggest that successful implementa-
tion of these guidelines may diminish the risk of early
sexual initiation by young adolescents. Further re-
search is needed to understand how families might ef-
fectively minimize the potential harms to children and
adolescents associated with television exposure, whether
by limiting total amount of television watched or by lim-
iting access to specific types of programming. Interven-
tions, including clinic-based interventions, designed to
alter television use and improve parental mediation of
television use should continue to be developed and tested
to determine if they are feasible and effective in chang-
ing television use and its behavioral effects.
