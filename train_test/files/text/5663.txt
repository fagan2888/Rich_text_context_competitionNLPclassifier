Introduction
Acute bronchiolitis represents the most important
cause of lower respiratory tract infection during
the first year of life and is the leading reason for
hospitalization for infants beyond the neonatal
period [Leader and Kohlhase, 2003]. The disease
is usually associated with substantial direct and
indirect costs, not only for healthcare systems,
Impact of the implementation of an
evidence-based guideline on diagnostic
testing, management, and clinical outcomes
for infants with bronchiolitis

Abstract
Background: Although bronchiolitis poses a significant health problem in low- and middle-
income countries (LMICs), to the best of our knowledge, to date it has not been determined
whether evidence-based bronchiolitis clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) complemented
by standardized educational strategies reduce the use of unnecessary diagnostic tests and
medications and improve clinically important outcomes in LMICs.
Methods: In an uncontrolled before and after study, we assessed the impact of the
implementation of an evidence-based bronchiolitis CPG on physician behavior and the
care of infants with bronchiolitis by comparing pre-guideline (March to August 2014) and
post-guideline (March to August 2015) use of diagnostic tests and medications through an
electronic medical record review in a children's hospital in Bogota, Colombia. We also sought
to assess the impact of the implementation of the CPG on clinically important outcomes such
as lengths of stay, hospital admissions, intensive care admissions, and hospital readmissions.
Results: Data from 662 cases of bronchiolitis (pre-guideline period) were compared with
the data from 703 cases (post-guideline period). On comparing the pre- and post-guideline
periods, it was seen that there was a significant increase in the proportion of patients with
an appropriate diagnosis and treatment of bronchiolitis (36.4% versus 44.5%, p = 0.003),
and there were statistically significant decreases in the use of a hemogram (33.2% versus
26.6%, p=0.010), procalcitonin (3.9% versus 1.6%, p=0.018), nebulized beta-2 agonists
(45.6% versus 3.4%, p < 0.001), nebulized anticholinergics (3.3% versus 1.4%, p= 0.029), and
nebulized epinephrine (16.2% versus 7.8%, p < 0.001). Likewise, a significant increase in
the use of nebulized hypertonic saline was seen (79.6% versus 91.7%, p < 0.001). However,
implementation of the CPG for bronchiolitis was not associated with significant changes in
clinically important outcomes.
Conclusions: The development and implementation of a good quality bronchiolitis CPG is
associated with a significant increase in the proportion of cases with an appropriate diagnosis
and treatment of the disease in the context of a university-based hospital located in the capital
of an LMIC. However, we could not demonstrate an improvement in clinically important
outcomes such as any of the bronchiolitis severity parameters.

but also for families and society as a whole
[Paramore et al. 2004]. Bronchiolitis poses a sig-
nificant health problem in high-income countries,
but it is an even greater problem in low- and mid-
dle-income countries (LMICs), due to higher
mortality rates [Berman, 1991].
Although several clinical practice guidelines
(CPGs) of acceptable quality have been devel-
oped [Rodríguez-Martínez et al. 2016], there is
still significant unexplained variability in the clini-
cal practice [Christakis et al. 2005; Florin et al.
2014]. This variability has been associated with
inappropriate use and overuse of medications
with insufficient evidence of effectiveness [Ochoa
Sangrador et al. 2014] and the use of unnecessary
diagnostic tests [Rodríguez Martínez and Sossa
Briceño, 2011], generating unnecessary and
costly resource use with no improvement in
important clinical outcomes [Christakis et al.
2005]. In an attempt to reduce the variability in
clinical practice for bronchiolitis, several different
CPGs have been developed [Rodríguez Martínez
et al. 2016], but many physicians fail to prescribe
in accordance with these CPGs [Florin et al.
2014]. This lack of impact of CPGs on physician
behavior has been deemed to be associated with
the persistence of variability in the use of medica-
tions, diagnostic tests, and resources despite lack
of strong evidence supporting recommendations
for their routine use [Florin et al. 2014].
Previous evidence has suggested that develop-
ment of CPGs alone may not change physician
behavior; it may also be necessary to execute an
implementation strategy showing how the rec-
ommendations can be put into practice [Florin
et al. 2014]. The development and implementa-
tion of evidence-based clinical pathways has been
shown to positively impact clinically important
outcomes such as use of unnecessary diagnostic
tests, use of medications with insufficient evi-
dence of effectiveness, and length of stay
[Perlstein et al. 1999; Wilson et al. 2002].
However, to the best of our knowledge, no previ-
ous study has investigated if the development
and implementation of evidence-based bronchi-
olitis CPGs improve clinically important out-
comes in LMICs. Additionally, while some
studies have found good self-reported compli-
ance with local bronchiolitis CPGs, this method
of reporting compliance is potentially inaccurate
and could provide information of what physi-
cians think they do rather than what they actually
do [Barben et al. 2008; Touzet et al. 2007].
The objective of the present single-center study
was to assess the impact of the implementation of
an evidence-based bronchiolitis CPG on physi-
cian behavior and the care of infants with bron-
chiolitis by comparing pre-guideline and
post-guideline use of diagnostic tests and medica-
tions through an electronic medical record review
in one of the most representative children's hospi-
tals in Bogota, Colombia. We also sought to
assess the impact of the implementation of the
CPG on clinically important outcomes such as
length of stay, hospital admissions, intensive care
admissions, and hospital readmissions.
Methods
Study site
The Fundacion Hospital La Misericordia is a ter-
tiary care university-based children's hospital
located in the metropolitan area of Bogota, the
capital city of Colombia, a tropical LMIC located
in South America. The hospital has 287 beds and
serves the city of Bogota (7,363,782 inhabitants)
as well as other cities of the country. For the lat-
ter, it mainly functions as a referral center that
admits about 12,000 children (of which about
2000 are due to bronchiolitis) and registers more
than 60,000 emergency room visits per year (of
which about 3000 are due to bronchiolitis). The
majority of admissions to the hospital come from
the emergency department and from inpatient
transfers from outlying primary and secondary
clinics and hospitals. All emergency and inpatient
services are provided with the assistance of pedia-
tricians, residents, interns, and medical students.
Guideline development
The evidence-based bronchiolitis CPG used in
the present study was developed by a team com-
prised of resident pediatricians, pediatric pulmo-
nologists, and clinical epidemiologists, supported
by the Institute for Clinical Investigations,
Universidad Nacional de Colombia. Because
international CPGs from authoritative sources
may not be directly applicable to a local setting
and rigorous guideline development often carries
significant personnel, resource, and time implica-
tions, the team decided to adapt high quality
existing CPGs.
For this purpose, the first step was to conduct a
systematic search for CPGs on the diagnosis or
treatment of acute viral bronchiolitis in infants
R Henao-Villada, MP Sossa-Briceño et al.
http://tar.sagepub.com 427
published from 2010 to 2013, with no language
restriction. We did not search for CPGs pub-
lished before 2010 because evidence-based CPGs
need to be updated regularly and the resultant
CPG developed was concerned with the most up-
to-date evidence. The systematic search for CPGs
was carried out by searching in the TRIP (Turning
Research into Practice) database web sites of
major international agencies that elaborate or
compile CPGs, clearinghouse websites, Google,
Google Scholar, and the US National Library of
Medicine database (through PubMed). A trial
search coordinator with the Iberoamerican
Cochrane Collaboration provided search support
for the review team authors.
The process of identification and selection of
appropriate and relevant documents yielded three
CPGs for further quality evaluation. The AGREE
II instrument was used to evaluate the quality of
the selected CPGs because this tool is currently
the most widely accepted and validated instru-
ment for appraising the quality of CPGs [Brouwers
et al. 2010]. In total, two independent reviewers
with experience in developing and appraising
CPGs evaluated the three selected CPGs using
the AGREE II instrument, which was pilot-tested
to ensure proper use. After comparing the scores
of the three selected CPGs, the CPG of the
Spanish National Healthcare System [Working
Group of the Clinical Practice Guideline on Acute
Bronchiolitis and Sant Joan de Déu Foundation,
2010] was rated as `recommended', and was the
selected CPG for the adaptation process.
However, due to the fact that classic adaptation of
CPGs could also involve a long and costly pro-
cess, the team developed and used a short-term
strategy for the adaptation process [Galindo et al.
2014]. The adaptation of the selected CPG
started in September 2013, and was carried out
over a period of 6 months. The complete adapta-
tion process comprised the following steps: (1)
creating a coordinating committee; (2) prioritiz-
ing the conditions for the CPG; (3) building the
Guidelines Adaptation Group; (3) defining the
guideline's scope and objectives; (4) searching for
the CPG; (5) selecting related titles (two review-
ers); (6) assessing the quality using the AGREE II
instrument (two reviewers); (7) selecting the
guidelines to be adapted; (8) defining the rele-
vance of the adapted CPG questions (five maxi-
mum); (9) assessing the need for a new question
to be answered; (10) searching for tables of evi-
dence; (11) validating the qualification of the
evidence; (12) adjusting the recommendations to
the local context; and (13) drawing up the final
document [Galindo et al. 2014].
Guideline content
The resultant CPG after the adaptation process
recommends against routine use of diagnostic
tests such as a hemogram, C-reactive protein, and
procalcitonin and suggested that C-reactive pro-
tein and procalcitonin should be ordered only for
infants with suspected serious bacterial infec-
tions. Likewise, the CPG recommends against
routine use of chest radiography, suggesting that
it should be ordered only for infants with diagnos-
tic uncertainty, severe disease, or an atypical dis-
ease course.
With respect to the pharmacological treatment,
the CPG also recommends against routine use of
inhaled bronchodilators (beta 2 agonists, anticho-
linergics), nebulized epinephrine, and anti-inflam-
matories (inhaled or systemic corticosteroids), but
allows for the option of a monitored trial of inhaled
bronchodilators or nebulized epinephrine, con-
tinuing their administration only if there is a docu-
mented positive clinical response to the trial using
an objective means of evaluation. Finally, the
CPG also recommends that nebulized hypertonic
saline could be administered to infants hospital-
ized for bronchiolitis in order to shorten hospital
stay, but recommends against its use in the emer-
gency department.
Guideline implementation
Standardized educational strategies were imple-
mented in the study hospital in two phases
between February and March 2015. The first
phase was carried out in February 2015 and com-
prised individual educational interventions tar-
geting general practitioners and pediatricians
working in the emergency department and in the
general ward. The second phase was carried out
in March 2015 and involved group educational
interventions targeting pediatric residents, gen-
eral practitioners, and pediatricians. A Power
Point presentation showing levels of evidence and
grades for the main recommendations of the
newly-developed CPG was used in the second
phase. Both phases were complemented by an
interactive session of questions and answers.
Additionally, in both phases each participant was
given written material containing the levels of evi-
dence and grades for the main recommendations
Therapeutic Advances in Respiratory Disease 10(5)
428 http://tar.sagepub.com
of the newly developed CPG and a validated scale
for assessing the severity of bronchiolitis. The
above mentioned implementation strategy was
complemented by the availability of an easily
accessible written version of the CPG in the elec-
tronic medical record platform.
Study design and study population
We conducted an uncontrolled before and after
study through a review of the hospital's electronic
medical record of patients 24 months of age and
younger who were admitted to the emergency
department or who were hospitalized with a dis-
charge diagnosis of acute bronchiolitis (ICD-10
codes J21, J21.0, J21.1, J21.8, J21.9) during the
pre-guideline (March to August 2014) and post-
guideline (March to August 2015) periods. We
chose these two time periods because they roughly
coincided with the main bronchiolitis season in
the city [Rodríguez et al. 2014].17 Eligible patients
were identified by daily review of the electronic
medical record of the emergency department and
the general ward and were confirmed by consulta-
tion with the physician caring for the patient. Due
to the fact that patients with subsequent bronchi-
olitis readmissions are usually managed differently
from those who present with their first episode,
we analyzed only the data regarding the first
admission. However, hospital readmission was
analyzed as an outcome measure. Patients with
incomplete data were excluded from the analysis.
After reviewing the electronic medical record, we
collected the following demographic, clinical, and
disease-related information: date of emergency
department attendance or admission, age, gen-
der, presence of underlying disease conditions
(prematurity, pre-existing respiratory conditions,
bronchopulmonary dysplasia, congenital heart
disease, and pulmonary hypertension), use of
diagnostic tests (hemogram, C-reactive protein,
procalcitonin, and chest radiography), use of
medications (beta 2 agonists, anticholinergics,
epinephrine, inhaled and systemic corticoster-
oids, or antibiotics), type of virus identified, if a
bronchiolitis severity classification was used, and
if so, which scale for assessing the severity was
used and what the severity level the disease was.
In the same manner, we collected information
related to outcomes of care or bronchiolitis sever-
ity parameters such as length of stay, hospital
admissions, intensive care admissions, assisted
ventilation requirement, ambulatory oxygen
requirement, and hospital readmissions.
Outcomes
As the primary outcome of interest, we defined a
priori a composite outcome score, which we
termed `appropriate diagnosis and treatment of
bronchiolitis'. This composite outcome score
aggregated the use of diagnostic tests (hemogram,
C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, and chest radi-
ography), the use of medications (nebulized beta
2 agonists, inhaled beta 2 agonists, nebulized
anticholinergics, inhaled anticholinergics, nebu-
lized epinephrine, inhaled corticosteroids, sys-
temic corticosteroids, antibiotics, and nebulized
hypertonic saline), and the use of a scale for
assessing the severity of bronchiolitis. Each of
these 14 items had a binary score: 0 indicating
that the diagnostic test or the medication was not
used and 1 indicating that they were used (except
for the use of a scale for assessing the severity of
bronchiolitis, which also had a binary score, but
with 0 indicating that a scale was used and 1 indi-
cating that it was not used). The total score was
calculated by adding up the scores for the 14
items, resulting in a total score ranging from 0­14
(best to worst). A composite outcome score >3
was designated as `inappropriate diagnosis and
treatment of bronchiolitis', whereas scores 3
were deemed as `appropriate diagnosis and treat-
ment of bronchiolitis', provided they did not
include the use of anticholinergics (nebulized or
inhaled) or corticosteroids (inhaled or systemic).
Additionally, the use of nebulized hypertonic
saline was deemed as appropriate for inpatients
but not for outpatients.
Secondary outcomes included bronchiolitis sever-
ity parameters such as length of stay, hospital
admissions, intensive care admissions, assisted
ventilation requirement, ambulatory oxygen
requirement, and hospital readmissions. The
study protocol was approved by the local ethics
board.
Statistical analysis
Continuous variables are presented as mean
standard deviation (SD) or median interquartile
range(IQR),whicheverisappropriate.Categorical
variables are presented as numbers (percentage).
The differences in the proportion of use of diag-
nostic tests and medications and categorical
bronchiolitis severity variables between pre-
guideline and post-guideline assessment periods
were evaluated using the McNemar test. The dif-
ference in length of stay between pre-guideline
and post-guideline periods was assessed using the
R Henao-Villada, MP Sossa-Briceño et al.
http://tar.sagepub.com 429
paired Student's t-test or the Wilcoxon signed-
rank test, whichever was appropriate. We used
general linear models (GLMs) to examine the
association between the implementation of the
guideline and the `appropriate diagnosis and
treatment of bronchiolitis', adjusting for baseline
values and potential confounders. Likewise, we
used GLMs to examine the association between
the implementation of the guideline and bronchi-
olitis severity parameters, adjusting for baseline
values and potential confounders. Results of the
multivariate analyses are presented as an odds
ratio (OR) with their respective 95% confidence
interval (CI). All statistical tests were two-tailed,
and the significance level used was p < 0.05. The
data were analyzed with the statistical package
Stata, version 12.0 (Stata Corporation, College
Station, TX, USA).
Results
Characteristics of the study population
After reviewing the electronic medical record, a
total of 1365 cases of bronchiolitis were identi-
fied using ICD-10 codes. Data from 662 cases of
bronchiolitis (188 who attended the emergency
department and 474 inpatients) from the
6-month period before implementation of the
CPG (March to August 2014) were compared
with the data from 703 cases (170 who attended
the emergency department and 533 inpatients)
from the 6-month period after implementation of
the CPG (March to August 2015). Of the 1365
included patients, 756 (55.4%) were males, and
the median (IQR) age was 5.0 (2.0­9.0) months.
The age group distribution was: 850 (62.3%) less
than 6 months, 374 (27.4%) between 7 and 12
months, and 126 (9.2%) between 13 and 24
months. As expected, in both years the majority
of cases of bronchiolitis (873, 63.9%) occurred
during the 3-month period from March to May,
the main rainy season in the city. Regarding the
presence of underlying disease conditions, it was
found that 104 (7.6%) patients had a history of
prematurity, 28 (2.1%) patients had a history of
previous respiratory disease, 11 (0.8%) patients
had a history of congenital heart disease, and 11
(0.8%) patients had an underlying neurologic
disease. Of the total of 1354 cases of bronchioli-
tis, 499 (36.6%) had respiratory syncytial virus
infections, 22 (1.6%) had adenovirus infections,
5 (0.4%) had influenza infections, and in the
remaining 839 (61.4%) cases no virus was
identified or no test was ordered for identifying
the causative virus. There were significant differ-
ences in the months of disease occurrence and
the type of viral respiratory infection between
pre-guideline and post-guideline periods (Table
1). The remaining demographic and clinical
characteristics measured did not differ between
study periods (Table 1).
Use of diagnostic tests
Use of diagnostic tests in the 6-month period
before implementation of the CPG was as fol-
lows: hemogram in 220 patients (33.2%),
C-reactive protein in 119 (18.0%), procalcitonin
in 26 (3.9%), and chest radiography in 315
(47.6%).
Use of diagnostic tests in the 6-month period
after implementation of the CPG was as follows:
hemogram in 187 patients (26.6%), C-reactive
protein in 149 (21.2%), procalcitonin in 11
(1.6%), and chest radiography in 307 (43.7%).
On comparing the pre- and post-guideline peri-
ods, it was seen that there were statistically sig-
nificant decreases in the use of hemogram
(p = 0.010) and procalcitonin (p = 0.018).
Use of medications
Rates of use of medications for each study period
are presented in Table 2.
On comparing pre- and post-guideline periods, it
was seen that there were statistically significant
decreases in the use of nebulized beta 2 ago-
nists (p < 0.001), nebulized anticholinergics
(p = 0.029), and nebulized epinephrine (p < 0.001).
Additionally, there was a statistically significant
increase in the use of nebulized hypertonic saline
in the post-guideline period (p < 0.001). Rates of
use of inhaled beta 2 agonists, inhaled anticholin-
ergics, corticosteroids, and antibiotics did not dif-
fer between study periods.
Use of a bronchiolitis severity classification
There was no significant difference in the rate of
use of a bronchiolitis severity classification
between pre-guideline and post-guideline periods
(2.7% versus 2.4%, p = 0.73). Among those
patients that had severity classification, there were
no statistical significant differences regarding the
Therapeutic Advances in Respiratory Disease 10(5)

bronchiolitis severity when comparing pre-guide-
line and post-guideline periods (p = 0.081).
Bronchiolitis severity parameters
On comparing the pre- and post-guideline peri-
ods, it was found that there were no statistically
significant differences in outcomes of care or
bronchiolitis severity parameters such as length
of stay [4.0 (0.0­7.0) versus 5.0 (2.0­8,0),
p = 0.37], hospital admissions (71.6% versus
75.8%, p = 0.07), intensive care admissions
(1.2% versus 0.7%, p = 0.39), assisted ventilation
requirement (0.5% versus 0.1%, p = 0.63),
ambulatory oxygen requirement (35% versus
37.8%, p = 0.20), and hospital readmissions
(1.5% versus 0.6%, p = 0.18).
Appropriate diagnosis and treatment of
bronchiolitis
There was a statistically significant increase in the
proportion of patients with an appropriate diag-
nosis and treatment of bronchiolitis between pre-
guideline and post-guideline periods (36.4%
versus 44.5%, p = 0.003).

Predictors of appropriate diagnosis and
treatment of bronchiolitis through multivariate
analysis
Multivariate analyses were conducted to deter-
mine independent factors associated with an
appropriate diagnosis and treatment of bronchi-
olitis. The predictor variables included in the
multivariate models were age, presence of under-
lying disease conditions, the type of virus identi-
fied, the months of disease occurrence, and the
implementation of the CPG. After controlling for
these potential confounders, it was found that the
implementation of the CPG (OR 1.31; CI 95%
1.05­1.64; p = 0.017), age (OR 0.93; CI 95%
0.91­0.96; p < 0.001), respiratory syncytial virus
(RSV) as the causative virus identified (OR 1.33;
CI 95% 1.06­1.68; p= 0.014), and the absence of
any underlying disease condition (OR 2.02; CI
95% 1.14­3.59; p = 0.016) were independent
predictors of an appropriate diagnosis and treat-
ment of bronchiolitis in our sample of patients
(Table 3).
Predictors of bronchiolitis severity parameters
through multivariate analyses
Multivariate analyses were conducted in order to
determine independent factors associated with
bronchiolitis severity parameters. Implementation
of the CPG was not statistically associated with
length of stay, hospital admissions, intensive care
admissions, assisted ventilation requirement,
ambulatory oxygen requirement, or hospital read-
missions (data not shown).
Discussion
The present study suggests that the development
and implementation of a good quality CPG for
bronchiolitis is associated with a significant
increase in the proportion of cases with an appro-
priate diagnosis and treatment of the disease.
This appropriate diagnosis and treatment of
bronchiolitis was mainly due to a decrease in use
of diagnostic tests such as a hemogram and proc-
alcitonin and changes in the use of medications
such as nebulized beta 2 agonists, nebulized
anticholinergics, nebulized epinephrine, and neb-
ulized hypertonic saline. However, implementa-
tion of the CPG for bronchiolitis was not
associated with significant changes in outcomes
of care or bronchiolitis severity parameters such
as length of stay, hospital admissions, intensive
care admissions, assisted ventilation requirement,
ambulatory oxygen requirement, or hospital
readmissions.
The findings of the present study point to the
usefulness of the implementation of a good qual-
ity bronchiolitis CPG in impacting physician's
behavior with respect to the use of unnecessary
diagnostic tests and the use of medications with
insufficient evidence of effectiveness. This opti-
mization of the use of diagnostic tests and treat-
ments could help to reduce the variability in the
clinical practice and the direct costs of bronchi-
olitis, leading to a more efficient diagnostic and
therapeutic approach to the disease. Additionally,
the findings of the present study provide further
evidence of the effectiveness of a strategy for
implementing a bronchiolitis CPG, which is one
of the main flaws of the majority of the available
bronchiolitis CPGs [Rodríguez-Martínez et al.
2016]. Although we could not demonstrate a
significant change in clinically important out-
comes such as length of stay, hospital admis-
sions, intensive care admissions, assisted
ventilation requirement, ambulatory oxygen
requirement, or hospital readmissions, the sig-
nificant increase in the proportion of cases with
an appropriate diagnosis and treatment of the
disease is probably associated with lower use of
resources and with a lower proportion of the
adverse effects of unnecessary medications or

treatments. However, our study was not designed
to measure the above factors.
The findings of the present study are in line with
previous research intended to assess the impact of
implementing bronchiolitis CPGs on resource
use. Kotagal and colleagues reported a significant
decrease in the proportion of patients who
received albuterol after the implementation of an
evidence-based CPG [Kotagal et al. 2002]. Mittal
and colleagues demonstrated a significant reduc-
tion in the use of tests and treatments (hemo-
gram, chest radiography, bronchodilators,
corticosteroids, and antibiotics) after the imple-
mentation of a CPG that included the presence of
an easily accessible online CPG document [Mittal
et al. 2014]. Likewise, after the implementation of
an evidence-based CPG, Perlstein and colleagues
reported a 30% decrease in the use of at least
one beta-agonist therapy, as well as a significant
decrease in nasopharyngeal washings for RSV,
chest radiographs, respiratory therapies, and
mean costs for respiratory care services [Perlstein
et al. 1999]. However, in contrast to our findings,
previous reports in the literature have shown sig-
nificant improvements in outcomes of care or
bronchiolitis severity parameters such as length of
stay (LOS) and hospital admissions after the
implementation of the CPG. Kotagal and col-
leagues reported a significant decrease in length
of stay after the implementation of an evidence-
based CPG [Kotagal et al. 2002]. Likewise,
Perlstein and colleagues reported a 30% decrease
in the rate of hospital admissions and a decrease
of 17% in the mean LOS after the implementa-
tion of an evidence-based CPG [Perlstein et al.
2000]. These discordant results can be explained,
at least in part, by a residual confounding bias
(where the OR of the intervention is specifically
biased downward) due to the fact that a known
potential confounder, severity of bronchiolitis,
could not be included in the multivariate models
because a disease severity classification was used
only in 2.4% of cases. This is a viable hypothe-
sis, because local epidemiological surveillance
reports in the city (Secretary of Health of Bogota)
showed an increase in the severity of acute lower
respiratory infections in the first semester of
2015 compared with the same period in 2014
[Secretary of Health of Bogota, 2015]. An alter-
native explanation is that, as opposed to the use
of diagnostic tests, if there has been a failure to
demonstrate that the use of medications such
as bronchodilators and nebulized epinephrine
(which accounts for the highest proportion of
changes between pre-guideline and post-guide-
line periods) has a significant impact on clinically
important outcomes, this does not necessarily
mean that the choice not to use them does have a
significant impact on these outcomes. It is simply
that the disease follows its natural course, and
there are no significant differences between
administering and not administering these medi-
cations. Another finding that deserves attention is
that in the post-guideline period, the use of nebu-
lized bronchodilators decreased whereas the use
of inhaled bronchodilators remained unchanged.
The reason for this is not clear but it could be
attributed to the fact that the CPG implemented
in the study promotes the use of the inhaled
instead of the nebulized form in order to perform
the monitored trial with bronchodilators.
We are aware that our research may have two
limitations. The first is that we used an uncon-
trolled before and after study to determine the
impact of the implementation of an evidence-
based bronchiolitis CPG on physician behavior
and the care of infants with bronchiolitis.
Although it is not possible to definitely attribute
any observed changes to the intervention with the
foregoing design of the study, it is very probable
that the observed changes in physician behavior
and the care of infants with bronchiolitis were
attributable to the intervention, because no other
factors or interventions occurred during the study
periods to which those significant changes could
be ascribed. The second is that we used a nonvali-
dated definition for an appropriate diagnosis and
treatment of bronchiolitis. Although other studies
have used different definitions of an appropriate
diagnosis and treatment of the disease [Ochoa
Sangrador et al. 2013; Acuña-Cordero et al.
2014], these definitions have not been validated
and have not included variables that we consid-
ered important, such as the use of a scale for
assessing the severity of the disease. Finally, our
results need to be interpreted with caution,
because residual confounding cannot be excluded.
The main strength of the study is that it offers
crucial evidence for the impact of a relatively sim-
ple intervention in a LMIC, aimed at improving
the diagnosis and the management of a disease
that is an important cause of morbidity and mor-
tality in these countries.
In conclusion, the findings of the present study
show that the development and implementation
of a good quality bronchiolitis CPG is associated
with a significant increase in the proportion of

cases with an appropriate diagnosis and treatment
of the disease in the context of a university-based
hospital located in the capital of an LMIC.
However, although the improvement in the pro-
portion of cases with an appropriate diagnosis
and treatment of the disease was due to changes
in the proportion of the use of diagnostic tests and
medications as recommended in a good quality
CPG, we could not demonstrate an improvement
in clinically important outcomes. Further studies,
with a sample of patients/physicians more repre-
sentative of the whole country, and taking into
account the severity of bronchiolitis as a potential
confounder, will need to be undertaken in the
future. Additionally, future research on a vali-
dated definition of an appropriate diagnosis and
treatment of bronchiolitis should be undertaken.
