The Dynamics of Neighborhood Structural Conditions:
The Effects of Concentrated Disadvantage on
Homicide over Time and Space
Jacob H. Becker*

Several recent spatial analyses conclude the strong positive association typically
found between neighborhood concentrated disadvantage and crime in cross-
sectional studies significantly differs across neighborhoods. It is possible this
spatial variation is due to within-neighborhood dynamics of continuity and change,
as suggested by ecological theories of neighborhood crime. Using ordinary least-
squares and geographically weighted regression models, I explore the role of within-
neighborhood change on the disadvantage-homicide relationship across Chicago
neighborhoods and find that controlling for historical changes in disadvantage
within neighborhoods reduces--but does not eliminate--spatial variation in the
cross-sectional relationship. Within-neighborhood changes in concentrated disad-
vantage from 1970 to 2000 are positively related to homicide rates, net of the level
of disadvantage in 2000. This suggests the relationship is influenced to some degree
by temporal continuity or change in the neighborhood ecological structure, consis-
tent with the dynamic conceptualization of neighborhoods inherent to ecological
theories of crime like social disorganization.
INTRODUCTION
In a long tradition of research on neighborhood conditions and crime, ecological the-
ories rooted in the Chicago School emphasize the importance of structural conditions
for crime outcomes. To some degree, however, there has been a disjunction between
theorizing on how neighborhood dynamics affect crime and empirical examination of
these processes. Ecological theories are often used to explain between-neighborhood
differences in crime rates, but less attention is paid to within-neighborhood change over
time. This is a substantial gap in our understanding of how structural conditions are
linked to crime, as the theoretical influence of neighborhood conditions emerges over
time as a function of dynamic processes. These simplifications overlook the possibility
that neighborhoods may appear similar in cross-section--that is, share a comparable
level of some structural condition like economic disadvantage--but have substantially
different histories of change (or continuity).

DYNAMICS OF NEIGHBORHOOD STRUCTURAL CONDITIONS
Sampson (2012) has recently proposed that we consider neighborhoods from a devel-
opmental or life-course perspective. He points out that neighborhoods change over time
in ways that can be considered "trajectories," and that they experience transitions and
turning points (in the vocabulary of the age-graded theory of informal social control; see
Sampson and Laub 1993). It is logical then that the "present" of a neighborhood is de-
pendent on its "past" much like an individual's current state is conditional on his or her
prior biography.
A parallel body of work has examined spatial aspects of the associations between struc-
tural conditions and crime (Baller et al. 2001; Messner et al. 1999) and tested several
assumptions of nonspatial models. Among these is spatial invariance, which assumes that
the relationship between a predictor and an outcome is the same across geographic
units (or "stationary"). Research generally finds this does not hold--the association is
significantly different across locations (Deller and Deller 2012; Graif and Sampson 2009;
Light and Harris 2012). Our understanding of how contexts contribute to neighborhood
crime would benefit from a deeper consideration of how dimensions of time and space
manifest in ecological dynamics. There has been growing attention in both criminol-
ogy and sociology about spatial and temporal variability in individuals' exposure to con-
textual influences, exemplified by work on the "uncertain geographic context problem"
(UGCoP; Kwan 2012). It is possible there is an analogous issue at the neighborhood level,
moving beyond debates of the appropriate unit of analysis (the "modifiable areal unit
problem" or MAUP; Anselin 1999; Hipp 2007; Weisburd et al. 2009) to incorporate issues
of timing and duration. My goal is thus to explore temporal continuity and change in one
important neighborhood condition--concentrated disadvantage--and how change (or
lack of it) may link structural conditions with crime. In doing so, I will demonstrate how
accounting for these dynamics can partly explain previous findings of spatially variant
associations between structural conditions and crime, and contribute to a developmental
perspective on neighborhoods and crime that explicitly addresses these associations as
part of a dynamic temporal process.
THE SOCIAL ECOLOGY OF CRIME
Rooted in the Chicago School of social ecology (Park et al. 1967), Shaw and McKay
(1969) found that in the presence of relatively rapid changes in composition, neighbor-
hoods with high levels of poverty had more crime than neighborhoods with less poverty.
Because high-poverty neighborhoods tended to remain impoverished over long periods
of time, they proposed that a dynamic process, part of a larger trend of city growth
and expansion, produced neighborhoods where poverty led to high residential turnover
and racial/ethnic heterogeneity. Poverty was a distal cause of high crime rates operat-
ing through proximate mechanisms of residential instability and heterogeneity, creating
"socially disorganized" neighborhoods where social control was limited. Later modifica-
tions of this perspective focused on the theoretical mechanisms linking structural condi-
tions to crime and disorder. The establishment of community attachment and network
ties in the "systemic model" (Kasarda and Janowitz 1974; Sampson 1988; Warner and
Rountree 1997), the exertion of social control at multiple levels (Bursik and Grasmick
1993; Sampson and Groves 1989), and the channeling of social capital through social
bonds to produce "collective efficacy" (Sampson and Raudenbush 1999; Sampson et al.
65
CITY & COMMUNITY
1997) have all been found to mediate the effects of neighborhood structure on crime and
disorder. These relationships may be part of nonrecursive cycles (Sampson 2012) and can
be complex. For example, in tests of the "negotiated coexistence" model, the regulatory
power of collective efficacy on crime was reduced in areas that had strong social net-
works (Browning 2009; Browning et al. 2004). Social ties between residents appeared to
simultaneously contribute to collective efficacy while offering offenders a source of social
capital that protected them from becoming "targets" of informal social control. Others
have reached similar conclusions; Pattillo (1998) found the incorporation of individuals
like gang members into largely prosocial resident networks could prevent those networks
from being completely efficacious. Criminals remained community members embedded
in networks who shared "mainstream desires for neighborhood order" but were "given a
degree of latitude to operate in the neighborhood" (Pattillo 1998, p. 770). Here, the sta-
bility of the networks played a large role in determining how embedded residents, both
criminal and not, became in the community.
These variations on social disorganization have a common thread: There is a social
process through which neighborhood conditions influence crime rates. Whatever the
process, it is by definition temporal. It does not immediately follow from structural con-
ditions but requires time to emerge and exert its influence. It follows that change--
or its inverse, continuity--in neighborhood conditions (whether good or bad) plays a
critical role in the operation of the social processes linking structure to crime (Bursik
1986; Kirk and Laub 2010). However, many studies overlook the inherent dynamism of
neighborhoods, due in part to a reliance on cross-sectional data. For example, Park et al.
(1967, p. 53) characterized metropolitan areas as units of growth and change, part of a
metabolic process which affected the ability of an area to maintain some degree of con-
tinuity and make a "natural but adequate readjustment in the social organization" of a
city. Disorganization was not pathological but a normal stage of development preceding
reorganization, which could not commence while change was ongoing as it disrupted
existing patterns of social routine--producing a "moving equilibrium of social order"
(Park et al. 1967, p. 54)--and led to neighborhoods with intractably high levels of crime,
delinquency, and other social ills. Disruption was expected to be succeeded by a period
of reorganization if and when the pace of change slowed or halted. In areas of persis-
tent high poverty or disadvantage, neighborhoods may already be in the end stages of
reorganization, though along qualitatively different criteria given that old standards of
behavior have broken down and "new . . . standards have arisen" (Whyte 1943, p. 38).
The ecological perspective rests on an understanding of neighborhoods as dynamic
organisms, and previous work has shown that the ecological structure of neighbor-
hoods is often not in a state of equilibrium (Bursik 1986; Bursik and Webb 1982;
Schuerman and Kobrin 1986). The associations between structural conditions and
crime appear sensitive to the stability of neighborhood ecological systems (Bursik and
Grasmick 1993, p. 50), implying theoretical mediating processes like disorganization
are dependent on the internal dynamics of the neighborhood itself. Neighborhoods
which are on their surface disorganized or lacking social control may experience
less crime than statistical models of structural conditions would predict. To illustrate
how this dynamism matters, I turn now to a neighborhood condition which consid-
erable research has shown plays a large role in neighborhood crime: concentrated
disadvantage.

DYNAMICS OF NEIGHBORHOOD STRUCTURAL CONDITIONS
CONCENTRATED DISADVANTAGE AND CRIME
Economic conditions within a neighborhood are key predictors of any number of social
outcomes, including crime. Early studies typically relied on a single measure-- poverty--
and its association with processes linking neighborhood structural conditions to crime,
like residential mobility and racial/ethnic heterogeneity (Shaw and McKay 1969). More
recent work has reconceptualized neighborhood deprivation as the intersection of several
negative conditions in time and space, including high levels of poverty, female-headed
households, and unemployment. Wilson (1996) described the emergence of "concen-
trated disadvantage" in urban areas toward the end of the 20th century as the result
of larger social and economic processes at work in the United States at the time (also
see Massey and Denton 1993). The confluence of multiple dimensions of deprivation
created a substantively different type of disadvantage than had existed previously; neigh-
borhoods were no longer simply poor but suffered from a particularly severe form of
deprivation. Historical conditions (i.e., time) were essential for explaining the spatial
concentration of African Americans in disadvantaged neighborhoods. For example, non-
poor black families had once acted as a "social buffer" for poor black families by acting
as sources of neighborhood economic and social capital from which all coresidents could
benefit. When nonpoor families began to migrate to other neighborhoods, the resources
they supplied also left, leaving behind a concentration of disadvantage linked to a variety
of negative social outcomes such as crime and violence.
At roughly the same time Wilson (1996) was exploring the growth of concentrated dis-
advantage in American cities, a debate emerged in macrocriminology on the conceptu-
alization of "deprivation." Prompted in part by critiques of poverty-based explanations of
crime (e.g., Blau and Blau 1982; Rosenfeld and Messner 1995) and inconsistent findings
across empirical research, this debate culminated in the work of Land et al. (1990). They
found the relationships between 11 commonly employed structural covariates and crime
were inconsistent across models using different units of analysis (e.g., cities or metropoli-
tan areas) and time periods (1960, 1970, and 1980), and concluded a single factor in-
corporating "resource deprivation/affluence" variables like the poverty rate and propor-
tion of single-parent families was more appropriate. The effect of this factor on crime
rates was robust over time periods and different levels of measurement, in keeping with
Wilson's assertion that multiple dimensions of disadvantage influenced the social pro-
cesses linking structural conditions to crime.
Within criminology, Wilson's (1996) work and the conclusions of (Land et al. 1990)
contributed to the widespread adoption of this conceptualization of deprivation and
stratification (Sampson 2013). While essential to studies of urban neighborhoods and
crime, focusing on the distribution of disadvantage across neighborhoods had the unin-
tended consequence of removing attention from the theoretical relationships between
ecological change, social disorganization, and crime originally suggested by Shaw and
McKay (1969). Most contemporary research examines the harmful effects of neighbor-
hood concentrated disadvantage through cross-sectional studies of neighborhoods with
varying degrees of disadvantage (though see Solari 2012), but rarely acknowledges that
this new type of disadvantage differs in a critical way from that depicted by Park et al.
(1967) or Shaw and McKay (1969). Traditionally, poverty was linked to higher crime rates
through processes that promoted neighborhood change; for example, higher population
67
CITY & COMMUNITY
mobility, weaker community attachment, and less social control. Concentrated disadvan-
tage, however, has commonly been conceptualized as inhibiting neighborhood change.
Neighborhoods suffering from high levels of concentrated disadvantage are likely to re-
main that way by isolating and trapping residents in conditions that represent a "tangle of
pathologies" and are durable over time (Sampson 2009, 2012). This type of disadvantage
therefore does not lead to a lack of "equilibrium" but instead may promote the continuity
that fosters neighborhood reorganization. A similar mechanism has been found in rural
areas, where poverty appears to increase rather than decrease residential stability, with
concurrent reductions in crime (Osgood and Chambers 2000). Social disorganization re-
tains a positive relationship with area crime rates, but the indirect relationship between
poverty and disorganization is reversed.
In the face of continuous and stable disadvantage, neighborhoods may have crime
rates which are somewhat lower than predicted by their level of concentrated disadvan-
tage alone. Inversely, neighborhoods with relatively low levels of disadvantage may expe-
rience higher-than-expected crime rates if current levels of disadvantage were preceded
by a period of substantial change (i.e., decreased disadvantage). This reasoning is consis-
tent with previous work on neighborhood change and crime/delinquency. Bursik and
Grasmick (1992) found increasing levels of residential stability within neighborhoods
from 1930 to 1970 were significantly and positively related to declines in delinquency
over time. Similarly, both positive (e.g., decreased disadvantage) and negative change
were linked to higher levels of violence in Baltimore (Covington and Taylor 1989; Taylor
and Covington 1988). On its face, neighborhood revitalization/gentrification is bene-
ficial, leading to improved conditions like lower disadvantage and less crime (though
these benefits may be race-specific; see Papachristos et al. 2011). For example, Seattle
census tracts which gentrified in the 1990s saw reductions in crime relative to nongentri-
fying tracts as theoretically expected (Kreager et al. 2011). Viewed as a process, however,
mortgage investment had a curvilinear relationship with crime, suggesting even favor-
able change like gentrification can be disruptive. Disruption, in turn, leads to a dimin-
ished capacity for informal social control until some "tipping point" is reached and stable
gentrification is associated with reduced crime (Kreager et al. 2011, p. 634).
DISADVANTAGE OVER SPACE AND TIME
Since processes linking structural conditions to crime are embedded in the neighbor-
hood's historical development, we should reconsider how neighborhood effects emerge
and operate. If the relationship between concentrated disadvantage and crime is affected
by "when" in the neighborhood's history we are looking (Bursik and Webb 1982), it can
be characterized as time-variant. In cross-section, this would likely appear as a spatially
variant relationship across neighborhoods; that is, the association between disadvantage
and crime would differ among neighborhoods with similar levels of disadvantage at a
given time point but substantially different histories. This line of reasoning would account
for previous findings that did not support assumptions of spatially invariant associations
between neighborhood conditions and crime.
This potential link between temporal processes and spatial invariance offers another
reason to attend to spatial organization's role in the study of neighborhoods. Nonspatial
analyses treat all observations (e.g., neighborhoods) as discrete geographical units, which
rests on two key assumptions: (1) spatial independence and (2) spatial invariance. Spatial
68
DYNAMICS OF NEIGHBORHOOD STRUCTURAL CONDITIONS
independence implies that structural conditions and crime within one geographic unit
have no association with crime in proximate units. A growing literature addressing spatial
independence finds substantial evidence that this assumption is largely unmet (Baller
et al. 2001; Messner and Anselin 2004), though the form that spatial dependence takes is
still unclear (e.g., diffusion; see Morenoff et al. 2001).
The second assumption has received less attention to date, though this is changing.
Spatial invariance posits the association between a structural predictor and the outcome
of interest is constant across space, or "stationary" (Fotheringham et al. 2002). Nonspa-
tial methods like ordinary least-squares (OLS) regression produce a single estimate of
the relationship, referred to as a "global" effect, which represents the average associa-
tion within the entire sample. This assumes the relationship is relatively consistent across
units, potentially masking substantial and statistically significant spatial variation in the
strength and direction of the relationship. If the true relationship includes both signif-
icant negative and significant positive associations, in a global estimate these opposing
forces may "wash out" and produce a Type II error. Cases where the relationship is very
large may alter the mean association of that variable with the outcome (like a univariate
outlier influences a sample mean); where the true relationship is nonsignificant, the pres-
ence of outlier coefficients may overestimate the mean relationship (in either a positive
or negative direction) and produce a Type I error.
Limited research using geographic information systems (GIS) and geographically
weighted regression (GWR) suggests the effects of important structural predictors
of crime do vary across space. Graif and Sampson (2009) noted the concentrated
disadvantage-homicide rate relationship was spatially variant across Chicago tracts, and
Light and Harris (2012) found the relationship between structural disadvantage and ar-
rests was spatially variant in a sample of U.S. counties. A study of Portland, Oregon, em-
ploying GWR also found the associations between structural covariates and violent crime
varied across block groups (Cahill and Mulligan 2007). None of these studies, however,
explored what might be producing this spatial variation, like the within-neighborhood dy-
namics of structural stability and change that could influence the social processes linking
conditions to crime. This study focuses on how within-neighborhood stability and change
may explain spatial variation in the relationship of concentrated disadvantage and crime
rates in cross-section.
CURRENT STUDY
Given the theoretical importance of neighborhood dynamics to ecological explanations
of crime, and prior findings of spatially variant cross-sectional associations between struc-
tural conditions and crime, I test a hypothesis that links these temporal processes to spa-
tial models of neighborhood effects: I predict that controlling for neighborhood struc-
tural continuity and change will account for previously­observed spatial variation in the
cross-sectional disadvantage-crime relationship. The relationship will become spatially in-
variant net of within-neighborhood change in concentrated disadvantage over time. The
level of disadvantage is still expected to have a positive association with crime. More dis-
advantaged neighborhoods will have higher crime rates than those with less, a common
finding in this area (Morenoff and Sampson 1997; Stults 2010). What remains unclear
is how change in disadvantage will influence the relationship. Change at any level of
69
CITY & COMMUNITY
disadvantage may be detrimental and lead to higher crime rates by disrupting mecha-
nisms that limit crime, such as the formation of community attachment, social bonds,
or collective efficacy; even relatively advantaged neighborhoods would have higher rates
of crime than their level of disadvantage suggests (Kreager et al. 2011; van Wilsem et al.
2006). Neighborhoods experiencing more change will have higher rates of crime than
those with less (or none), net of the level of disadvantage-- I characterize this as the
"temporal disruption" hypothesis. Alternatively, the effects of continuity may depend on
the level of disadvantage within a neighborhood. At high levels, the detrimental effects of
concentrated disadvantage could accumulate over time, so neighborhoods with contin-
uous high disadvantage would have higher crime rates than expected. Continuity would
be favorable in less disadvantaged neighborhoods because benefits would accrue over
time, weakening the disadvantage-crime relationship and producing lower than expected
crime rates, leading to the "temporal accumulation" hypothesis.
In the "temporal lag" hypothesis, the effect of change could depend on its direction.
Community attachment, social ties, and the ability of a neighborhood to establish trust
and exercise informal social control are types of social capital. Neighborhoods with in-
creasing disadvantage have "savings" of capital built in a less disadvantaged past, so the
negative effects of disadvantage will only emerge once this is depleted. In cross-section,
neighborhoods with increasing disadvantage would have lower crime rates than pre-
dicted because the relationship would be weaker than expected due to the time lag. In-
versely, neighborhoods experiencing declines in concentrated disadvantage require time
to translate increases in resources into social capital. In this case, the relationship between
disadvantage and crime would be stronger than expected in cross-section. The final pos-
sibility is that neighborhood histories of disadvantage have no significant effect on the
social process that links structural conditions to crime. The time necessary for concen-
trated disadvantage to impact a mediating social process like collective efficacy could be
relatively short and longer histories of disadvantage would not have a substantial effect on
neighborhood crime rates. This seems unlikely, however, given how any ecological pro-
cess mediating the structure-crime relationship is temporally dependent-- for example,
how long it likely takes to build trust and shared expectations for informal social control
within a neighborhood.
DATA AND METHODOLOGY
I explore the dynamics of concentrated disadvantage and homicide rates in Chicago
neighborhoods with several data sources. Decennial census data on Chicago are used to
construct measures of structural conditions from 1970 to 2000 in "neighborhood clusters"
(NCs), a unit of measurement created as part of the Project on Human Development in
Chicago Neighborhoods (Earls et al. 2007). NCs are designed to represent ecologically
meaningful units in studies of neighborhoods (Morenoff et al. 2001; Silver and Miller
2004; Zimmerman and Messner 2010). I standardized 1970, 1980, 1990, and 2000 tract
boundaries using the Neighborhood Change Database (Geolytics) to ensure identical
geographical units were compared over time and aggregated tract-level data to the NC
level using "crosswalk" data supplied by the PHDCN into a final sample of 342 NCs. Data
on neighborhood homicides from 2001 to 2005 were obtained from the Chicago Police
Department's online database CLEAR (CLEAR 2012).
70
DYNAMICS OF NEIGHBORHOOD STRUCTURAL CONDITIONS
DEPENDENT VARIABLE
The outcome of interest is the five-year average homicide rate per 100,000 residents for
each NC in Chicago. The Chicago Police Department's online database tracks crimes
known to the police by type and year, and each "event" includes information on where
the crime occurred. All homicides from 2001 through 2005 were geocoded to the appro-
priate tract in ArcGIS and aggregated to the NC level. From this I calculated the average
yearly number of homicides and constructed a rate per 100,000 residents. A multiyear
average rate is commonly used to reduce potential bias introduced by year-to-year fluc-
tuations in crime, especially relatively rare types like homicide (Martinez et al. 2010).
The distribution of the homicide rate across NCs was substantially skewed and was trans-
formed using a natural log function, in keeping with previous work.
INDEPENDENT VARIABLES
Contemporary research often focuses on three summary measures of neighborhood con-
ditions: concentrated disadvantage, immigrant concentration (a modern analogue to
Shaw and McKay's (1969) measure of racial/ethnic heterogeneity), and residential in-
stability. Several highly collinear univariate measures are combined in a single concep-
tually distinct factor for a given dimension in a factor regression procedure, a relatively
straightforward strategy when examining a single year but more complicated when ap-
plied to multiple time points. Comparisons of the factor loadings across 1970 to 2000
showed the same components loaded in substantively similar fashion over time; however,
the distributions of these variables changed considerably. Because final factor scores are
normalized, direct comparisons over time are affected by shifts in intercepts between
years, which represent the mean levels of factors across the sample of NCs for a given
year. For example, an NC with a level of concentrated disadvantage in 1970 equal to the
mean disadvantage for the entire sample would have a standardized score of zero for
1970. The same NC could again have a level of disadvantage in 2000 equal to the sam-
ple mean and a standardized factor score of zero, so disadvantage would not appear to
have changed within this NC. However, if the mean level of disadvantage across all NCs in
Chicago actually rose (or fell) in real terms, a change-score measure would be misleading.
All it would indicate is whether an NC's level of disadvantage, relative to the entire sample of
Chicago NCs, changed over time. To avoid this problem, I based the current factor scores
on the distributions of the univariate measures across the entire period. The results of
these models are the rotated factor loadings of component variables from 1970 through
2000 (available upon request), and normalized factor scores based on the average distri-
bution of the components over time. It is now possible to directly compare NC levels of
disadvantage, immigrant concentration, and residential stability over time.
The factor measures produced with this strategy are consistent with earlier work
(Sampson et al. 1997). The primary independent variable of interest, concentrated dis-
advantage, consists of the proportion of residents in an NC who are black, the proportion
unemployed, and the proportion of households which are female-headed, below poverty,
or on public assistance ( = .94). The other two factor measures are employed as controls
and constructed in a similar fashion. Immigrant concentration is determined by the propor-
tion of Hispanic and foreign-born residents ( = .81), while residential stability comprises

the proportion of residents living in the same location five years prior and the propor-
tion of owner-occupied housing units ( = .69). In later models, I control for within-NC
change in disadvantage. The measure of change was constructed by summing the amount
of absolute change in concentrated disadvantage over each 10-year period (1970­1980,
1980­1990, and 1990­2000). Taking a simple change score from 1970 to 2000 would have
obscured changes in opposing directions that occurred over shorter periods and failed to
truly capture structural continuity/change. However, using the absolute change in con-
centrated disadvantage makes it impossible to assess how the direction of change may
matter; this study is limited to exploring the more basic role of structural stability. The
distribution of the absolute change in concentrated disadvantage from 1970 to 2000 was
divided into quartiles where the first quartile represents little or no change, with each sub-
sequent quartile evidencing greater within-neighborhood changes (both increases and
decreases) in concentrated disadvantage than the last. For parsimony, dummy variables
representing the quartiles of change were calculated for each NC (1 = yes, 0 = no) to
characterize shifts in the level of disadvantage over time. Descriptive statistics for the
2001­2005 homicide rate and the 2000 structural predictors are shown in Table 1.
ANALYTIC STRATEGY
As laid out earlier, I believe within-neighborhood dynamics may account for spatial vari-
ation in the associations between structural conditions and homicide, so I first test for
the presence of a spatially variant relationship between concentrated disadvantage and
homicide across Chicago NCs in cross-section using GWR. These results are compared
to those of a traditional OLS model which assumes spatial invariance. In traditional OLS
regression, the constant () and the coefficient () are the same regardless of location
(i)
yi
=  + xi
+ ei (1)
so the model produces a single parameter estimate for each predictor for the full sample.
In GWR, however, the relationship is not assumed to be independent of location (i.e.,
spatially invariant) and the constant and coefficient are allowed to vary by observation
yi
=  (ui
, vi
) +  (ui
, vi
) xi
+ ei (2)
The values of the constant and the coefficient are a function of the location, denoted
here as geographic coordinates (ui,vi) which allow the location of every observation to
be determined relative to other sample observations. Each NC in the sample becomes
72
DYNAMICS OF NEIGHBORHOOD STRUCTURAL CONDITIONS
the center of a local regression employing a subsample of locations surrounding it. The
result is a set of local parameter estimates and model fit statistics for each sample NC.
The optimal local sample size is a trade-off between minimizing model bias and max-
imizing the variance within each local regression. I use a spatially adaptive weighting
function (Fotheringham et al. 2002) where observations closer to (ui,vi) are weighted
more heavily than those further away, in keeping with Tobler's (1970) "first law of ge-
ography" that nearer places are more similar than distant ones. The size of the local
sample kernel or bandwidth is smaller in areas with many data points and extends fur-
ther in areas with less. This schema accounts for the distribution and size differences of
NCs across Chicago, which tend to be smaller and denser closer to the city center, and
keeps the sample size and standard errors relatively consistent across local regressions.
This weighting schema assumes the spatial relationship is generally linear--that is, simi-
larities between neighborhoods are greatest among adjacent places and diminish as the
distance between them increases. This is not strictly the case in Chicago, where abrupt
changes in neighborhood conditions are possible (Sampson 2012), but map-based sup-
plemental explorations suggest this assumption generally holds.
A geographical variability test of spatial variation in the distribution of parameter
estimates indicates whether any observed variation is statistically different from zero
(Fotheringham et al. 2002). Any significant spatial variation in the disadvantage-
homicide relationship across Chicago would suggest that a given level of disadvantage
operates differently across NCs. I then add the dummy measures of within-neighborhood
change to the model to observe if and how structural stability/change accounts for
spatial variation in the cross-sectional disadvantage-homicide relationship.
RESULTS
Neighborhood cluster homicide rates were first regressed on the three factor measures
of structural conditions using GWR and the results compared to those from an OLS
regression model. The results of these "baseline" models appear in Table 2. In keeping
with prior research, in the OLS model (Panel B) concentrated disadvantage in 2000 has
a large, positive association with homicide rates (b = .557, p < .001) and is by far the
largest standardized coefficient in the model ( = .775). The three factor measures of
structural conditions explain about two-thirds of the variation in homicide rates across
Chicago NCs (adjusted R2 = .670).
Consistent with previous studies, NCs with higher levels of concentrated disadvantage
are predicted to have higher homicide rates, controlling for immigrant concentration
and residential stability. However, this model is nonspatial and cannot address the pos-
sibility that the true relationship varies across NCs. GWR allows me to test for spatial in-
variance and map local parameter estimates for visual inspection. I specified an identical
baseline model in the program GWR 4.0 using the adaptive weighting function described
above, and the model converged at a local sample size of 41 NCs. Local parameter es-
timates and model fit statistics, as well as fit statistics for the overall GWR model, are
displayed in Table 2, Panel A. The results are organized as 5-number summaries across
all NCs, indicating the distribution of local effects for the three predictors, the direction
of significant relationships, and if they vary significantly across space.

DYNAMICS OF NEIGHBORHOOD STRUCTURAL CONDITIONS
The results clearly indicate that the relationship between concentrated disadvantage
and homicide rates varies across Chicago neighborhoods. It ranges from a null to statis-
tically significant positive relationship, with local b-coefficients of concentrated disadvan-
tage extending from -.58 to .92. The geographical variability test reveals this variation is
statistically significant (p < .001), indicating the spatial invariance assumption does not
hold. The same is true of immigrant concentration, with the parameter estimates of vary-
ing significantly across Chicago (p < .001). Overall, the GWR model (AIC = 164.89) fits
the data better than the OLS model (AIC = 297.80), with a significant improvement in
model fit (F = 3.36, p < .001), and accounts for 15 percent more variation in homicide
rates (adjusted R2 = .79) than the OLS model (adjusted R2 = .67).
Local GWR models account for anywhere from 27 percent to 89 percent of the varia-
tion in homicide rates (not shown), confirming that traditional OLS models mask sub-
stantial and systematic differences in explanatory power across NCs. The relationship
between concentrated disadvantage and homicide rates also exhibits a spatial pattern
across Chicago. The t-test values of the local concentrated disadvantage parameter esti-
mates from the baseline model are mapped in Figure 1, Panel A; lighter shades denote
smaller t-values. In about 25 percent of the NCs (84 of 342), the relationship is not sta-
tistically significant. The remaining 75 percent exhibit a significant positive relationship,
as expected; however, the strength of this relationship fluctuates substantially across NCs.
There are distinct clusters of NCs within Chicago where concentrated disadvantage has a
much stronger association with homicide rates than others; in over a fifth of the neigh-
borhoods (70 of 342), the t-value is at least 6.
The statistical and visual evidence suggests cross-sectional estimates of the concentrated
disadvantage-homicide relationship are sensitive to where it is measured. If one examined
NCs in the central business district of Chicago, the findings would be quite different than
a study of neighborhoods on the fringe of the city. I hypothesized that this variation may
be due to neighborhoods having dissimilar histories of concentrated disadvantage though
they have similar levels at a given time point. Accounting for within-NC changes in con-
centrated disadvantage from 1970 to 2000 allows me to examine this prospect: I added
the dummy variables representing quartiles of change to the GWR model to assess if and
how neighborhood dynamics might account for spatial variation in the cross-sectional
concentrated disadvantage-homicide relationship. The first quartile, representing minor
or no change in disadvantage, was the omitted reference group. The results of the GWR
model were again compared to OLS estimates. The resulting 5-number summaries of the
local regressions, in Table 3, Panel A, indicate the inclusion of the change variables in
the "expanded" GWR model has a notable effect. The range of the b-coefficient for con-
centrated disadvantage shrinks by about 13 percent (-.60 through .70) and the variation
across local regressions is smaller, though still statistically significant. Presented visually in
Figure 1, Panel B, the relationship between concentrated disadvantage and homicide now
appears more consistent across NCs compared to the t-surface map of the baseline model
in Panel A. The t-surface map of the expanded model reveals that it is now more com-
mon for the local associations to be nonsignificant (120 of 342 NCs) while the number of
neighborhoods where the local t-value is 6 or above is less than 3 percent (9 out 342 NCs).
Having established that changes in disadvantage partly account for cross-sectional
spatial variation in the disadvantage-homicide relationship across NCs, a closer look at
these dynamics is warranted. The spatial invariance assumption is still not completely
supported, but for the purposes of comparison with prior research a return to OLS

regression is merited. The results of the expanded OLS model presented in Table 3,
Panel B are similar to the baseline model examined earlier. Roughly 70 percent of the
variation in homicide rates across NCs is explained in the expanded model; this is a signif-
icant but substantively small improvement compared to 67 percent in the baseline model
(F = 11.38, p < .001). However, there is a sizable reduction in the strength of the global
relationship between concentrated disadvantage and homicide (b = .428, p < .001) in
comparison to Table 2, Panel B. The relationship remains the strongest of the structural
predictors ( = .596) but is about 23 percent smaller than when the change variables
were omitted in the baseline OLS model (b = .557,  = .775).
The amount of within-neighborhood change in disadvantage clearly matters. Com-
pared to the omitted first quartile-- which includes neighborhoods experiencing little
or no change from 1970 to 2000-- neighborhoods with more change are predicted to
have significantly higher homicide rates. This relationship seems to follow a somewhat
linear pattern, with each subsequent change quartile predicting higher homicide rates.
The cross-sectional association between an NC's level of concentrated disadvantage and
its homicide rate appears to be influenced by whether that level has been relatively steady
over time.
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION
Previous research has found that a key assumption of nonspatial models of neighbor-
hood structural conditions and crime-- spatial invariance-- was not supported (Cahill
and Mulligan 2007; Graif and Sampson 2009; Light and Harris 2012; Tita and Cohen
2004). This study was designed to test the hypothesis that within-neighborhood changes
in concentrated disadvantage would account for spatial variation in the cross-sectional
disadvantage-homicide rate relationship. Prior work is largely descriptive and alludes
to but does not directly test for the influence of theoretical mechanisms like "diffu-
sion" of crime across spatial units, opportunities for violence, or interactions between
neighborhoods and the larger spatial geography. This study both adds to a body of ev-
idence that suggests empirical models of macrostructural conditions and crime should
not assume these relationships are invariant at a given point in time and suggests a
potential avenue for future research. One explanation for the spatial variation in the
disadvantage-homicide relationship found here (also see Graif and Sampson 2009; Light
and Harris 2012) is the role of dynamic structural conditions within neighborhoods.
Given the theoretical importance of within-neighborhood continuity and change to the
production and maintenance of social processes hypothesized to mediate the relation-
ship (e.g., collective efficacy), I explored how changes in neighborhood disadvantage
impact estimates of the concentrated disadvantage-homicide rate association in cross-
section, leading to my key finding. A comparison of the "basic" and "expanded" models
suggests that within-neighborhood disadvantage dynamics influence the cross-sectional
association between disadvantage and homicide. The inclusion of controls for how much
change had occurred within neighborhoods prior to 2000 produced two notable re-
sults. First, controlling for changes in disadvantage reduced the spatial variation in the
disadvantage-homicide relationship (though the variation remained significant). Second,
changes in concentrated disadvantage over time mattered for the prediction of homicide
rates; net of the level of concentrated disadvantage in 2000, higher degrees of change
78
DYNAMICS OF NEIGHBORHOOD STRUCTURAL CONDITIONS
prior to 2000 predicted higher homicide rates in 2001­2005. This indicates there may
be a substantive difference in how concentrated disadvantage affects homicide rates, de-
pendent to some extent on whether the neighborhood has experienced minor, moder-
ate, or major historical shifts in its level of concentrated disadvantage. This reintroduces
an important temporal dimension to theorizing on the role of neighborhood structural
conditions in producing or reducing crime. Neighborhoods with dissimilar histories of
disadvantage, though they have equivalent levels of disadvantage in cross-section, may ev-
idence substantial variation in how much crime occurs within the neighborhood. While
this study limited its examination to homicide rates, future work should also test if spa-
tially varying relationships and the role of historical change in disadvantage apply to other
types of violent and property crime.
The findings are generally congruent with the "disruption" hypothesis; historical
increases in concentrated disadvantage predicted higher homicide rates, net of the
level of disadvantage in 2000. However, this study was limited by the decision to model
absolute change. I outlined several ways historical dynamics might account for spatial
variation in the disadvantage-homicide relationship, but this framework was an idealized
conceptualization: Neighborhoods could have high or low levels of disadvantage in
2000, potentially preceded by increases, decreases, both, or no change. As this study was
largely exploratory, I chose to focus on internal neighborhood changes in disadvantage
as an absolute; it was not possible to compare neighborhoods with similar degrees of
internal change, but in opposite directions, with the measure employed here. A fruitful
direction for future research would be examining neighborhoods and/or time periods
which capture the full range of possible neighborhood histories. I also chose to focus on
a setting that has been well-studied (Park et al. 1967; Sampson 2012; Shaw and McKay
1969) so results could be compared to an extensive literature on the disadvantage-crime
relationship.
Any conclusions about the theoretical mechanisms linking the dynamics of neighbor-
hood disadvantage to crime rates through a mediating social process are necessarily spec-
ulative and beyond the scope of this research. My purpose was to explore how change or
continuity in concentrated disadvantage might contribute to neighborhood crime and
prompt a deeper consideration of the ecological dynamics operating within neighbor-
hoods over time. I did find, however, that greater change in concentrated disadvantage
was linked to higher homicide rates, net of disadvantage in 2000. This conforms to so-
cial disorganization theories of neighborhood crime (Sampson and Groves 1989; Samp-
son et al. 1997; Shaw and McKay 1969). In neighborhoods with shifting disadvantage,
it would be more difficult to establish social ties or expectations of informal social con-
trol, regardless of the level of disadvantage at any given time. Inversely, neighborhoods
which experience relatively steady levels of disadvantage (whether high or low) would
have a greater capacity to control crime; even criminals become embedded in primarily
noncriminal social networks over time and are subject to informal control in the neigh-
borhood (Pattillo 1998). While disadvantage has concentrated in some neighborhoods,
creating "traps" and high levels of social isolation (Massey and Denton 1993; Sampson
2009; Wilson 1996), there may be a very slender silver lining. Acute levels of disadvantage
in these neighborhoods drive crime rates upward, but it is possible continuity engendered
by the concentration process may inhibit the amount of crime occurring there. This is
not to suggest that concentrated disadvantage is a benefit-- the detrimental effects of the
level of disadvantage found here far outweigh any favorable effects of its consistency.

These findings also indicate there may be a macrolevel analogue to the UGCoP de-
scribed by Kwan (2012). The spatial and temporal uncertainty of "context" has received
substantial attention in individual-level sociological and criminological research, but
neighborhood-level studies tend to focus on spatial uncertainty (MAUP; see Hipp 2007)
while failing to consider the temporal dimension. Lacking measures of mediating pro-
cesses theorized to link neighborhood conditions and crime, I cannot say if structural
continuity/change indirectly influences crime through a relationship with some social
process (e.g., collective efficacy), and if so, how. Future work should look to further spec-
ify the models examined here and include measures of relevant theoretical mediators.
Furthermore, while I believe these results suggest that within-neighborhood structural
stability influences homicide rates, the use of GWR to explore how this change partially
accounts for spatially variant structure-crime relationships is necessarily limited. There
is a large literature that generally concludes there are other spatial forces at work-- for
example, spatial lag and spatial error models-- across adjacent neighborhoods (Baller
et al. 2001; Light and Harris 2012). A promising direction for future research would be
to examine spatial variation in the structure-crime associations (addressing the spatial
invariance assumption) while controlling for spatial lag or error (addressing the spatial
independence assumption). It is theoretically possible that both the internal mechanisms
of continuity/change suggested by this work and external mechanisms like spatial lag
found in previous work would operate simultaneously.
The principal goal of this paper was to examine neighborhood effects in a dynamic
context. The ecological perspective of the Chicago School in which most contempo-
rary macrocriminological theories are rooted held that continuity and change were cru-
cial to explanations of neighborhood-level associations. By and large, however, studies
of neighborhood effects have been limited to cross-sectional examinations of between-
neighborhood differences. While these can tell us a great deal about how and why the
level of a particular structural condition matters for crime-related outcomes, they fail to
incorporate a dimension of neighborhood dynamism. These dynamics are theoretically
important and appear to partly account for spatial variation in the disadvantage-crime re-
lationship across Chicago neighborhoods. It is possible the temporal nature of the mech-
anisms linking structural conditions to homicide expresses itself (to some degree) in the
form of spatially variant cross-sectional relationships. This would link two influential the-
oretical paradigms in contemporary criminology: the social ecology of "neighborhood
effects" research and the individual-level developmental/life-course perspective. Employ-
ing GWR and explicitly including a measure of within-neighborhood changes in disadvan-
tage, I have demonstrated one possible strategy for exploring the intersection of "social
mechanisms and dynamic processes" (Sampson 2012, p. 46) that moves beyond descrip-
tion and correlation and into a potentially more complete explanation of neighborhood
effects.
