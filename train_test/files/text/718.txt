Tobacco Control Initial Outcomes Index Gilpin et al.
Index for US State Tobacco Control Initial Outcomes

Public health tobacco control efforts have increasingly targeted communities in addition to individuals. Before
population smoking decreases, effectiveness might be detected from initial outcomes reflecting these efforts,
such as higher cigarette prices or more workplace and home smoking restrictions. Presumably, these initial
outcomes will eventually influence smoking behavior. State-specific estimates of percentages of the population
working or living under smoking bans are available from the 1992­1993 tobacco use supplement to the Current
Population Survey, conducted annually by the US Bureau of the Census. In addition, the tobacco industry
reports the average state cigarette price yearly.The authors constructed a tobacco control initial outcomes index
(IOI) by using values of these variables for each state and correlated it with state-specific adult (aged 25 years)
and youth (aged 15­24 years) smoking prevalence computed from the Current Population Survey and per capita
cigarette consumption data computed from sales and Census Bureau data. Both adult smoking prevalence (r =
­0.70) and per capita consumption (r = ­0.73) were significantly correlated with the IOI; youth smoking
prevalence correlated less well (r = ­0.34). Although the analysis is not definitive, deseasonalized 1983­1997
consumption trends for IOI-based tertile groups were divergent beginning in 1993, with the high IOI group
showing the greatest decrease. A high relative IOI index may be predictive of future smoking decreases and
should be considered when tobacco control efforts are evaluated. Am J Epidemiol 2000;152:727­38.

There is increased recognition that smoking behavior is
strongly influenced by the social environment (1). Thus,
tobacco control efforts are now generally focused on entire
communities in addition to the traditional approaches aimed
at individuals. Community-based efforts generally take the
form of comprehensive US state-level tobacco control pro-
grams (1­7). Such programs require careful evaluation so
that they can be improved and to justify the level of
resources committed to them. Since evaluative efforts
involve comparisons across states to account for secular
trends that occur independently of any specific program, an
index to rank states according to their tobacco control activ-
ity would be useful (8).
Comprehensive tobacco control programs include
resources (both monetary and human) to employ a wide
variety of efforts aimed at influencing the social environ-
ment. These efforts include 1) working to educate the pub-
lic (via paid mass media programs, public service announce-
ments, or media advocacy), 2) encouraging enactment of
new legislation or policies (to increase tobacco taxes, create
smoke-free workplaces, or regulate tobacco advertising), 3)
fostering smoking cessation (by increasing awareness of and
access to existing programs or developing new cessation
methods or programs), and 4) advocating for increased
enforcement of existing laws (including youth access laws
or laws restricting smoking). The immediate results of these
tobacco control efforts are what we have labeled "initial out-
comes." These outcomes can be quantified and can serve as
early indicators of tobacco control efforts (8). Examples of
initial outcomes include greater population exposure to anti-
tobacco messages or news coverage, increased tobacco
taxes, stronger laws for regulating smoking in public places,
more smokers receiving smoking cessation assistance,
increased compliance checks, and assessment of penalties to
prevent illegal tobacco sales to minors or for violations of
workplace smoking restrictions. Initial outcomes can be
viewed as the first steps along a continuum of change that
ultimately should result in reduced tobacco use by the gen-
eral population. To rank states according to these initial out-
comes requires uniform measures for each state, some assur-
ance that these outcomes can influence smoking behavior,
and some variability in the measures among states.
Appropriate measures currently are not available for all of
these initial outcomes. However, all states include tobacco
excise taxes in the retail price paid by the consumer, and
each year the tobacco industry uniformly reports the price of
cigarettes in each state to the Federal Trade Commission.
The average price per pack differs considerably among
states, and there is ample evidence that price affects smok-

ing behavior (9, 10). Community concern about the harmful
effects of secondhand tobacco smoke has led to local and
statewide ordinances restricting smoking in public places as
well as in the workplace (11, 12). Adoption of workplace
smoking restrictions has not been uniform across all states
(11, 12), but when these restrictions are in effect, they have
been shown to modify smoking behavior (13­18). Concern
about the health consequences of secondhand smoke also
can lead to considerable pressure against exposure to smoke
in one's personal environment (19). One form of this pres-
sure is imposition of home smoking restrictions, and com-
plete home smoking bans have also been associated with
smoking behavior (20). State-level measures of the propor-
tion of the population working or living under smoking bans
are available from the tobacco use supplement to the
Current Population Surveys (CPS) of 1992 and 1993. These
measures vary considerably. As standard measures become
available for other initial outcomes, they may also prove to
be candidates for inclusion in the index. For the present
study, we focused on three initial outcomes: cigarette price,
workplace smoking bans, and home smoking bans.
We ranked the 50 US states and the District of Columbia
(referred to in this paper as the 51 states) according to each
of these three initial outcomes; in this paper, we report the
correlation of each outcome with common measures of
smoking behavior: per capita cigarette consumption and
smoking prevalence. We also created z scores for the initial
outcomes, summed each of the standardized variables to
form an index, and correlated the resulting initial outcomes
index (IOI) with the smoking behavior measures. Finally,
we divided the 51 states into three groups determined by IOI
tertiles and examined the group mean smoking prevalence
and trends in per capita cigarette consumption.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Data sources
Current Population Surveys. Data were gathered from
three CPS surveys (September 1992, January 1993, and
May 1993) that included a special supplement on tobacco
use. The US Bureau of the Census continuously conducts
the CPS to monitor the labor force, covering the civilian,
noninstitutionalized population of persons aged 15 years in
the United States (21). These household surveys select a
stratified probability sample of clusters of households iden-
tified from the Census Bureau and other sources (22). The
CPS design calls for surveying about 56,000 households
each month, and each household is part of a panel that is
interviewed eight times over a 16-month period. All respon-
dents to the 1992­1993 tobacco use supplements were inter-
viewed only once in September 1992, January 1993, or May
1993. About a quarter of the interviews were conducted in
person (first or fifth time in a panel); the remainder were
conducted by telephone (second, third, fourth, sixth, sev-
enth, or eighth time in a panel). Except for the tobacco use
supplement, for which every effort was made to interview
each person aged 15 years residing in the household, one
knowledgeable member responded for all others. To maxi-
mize the proportion of self-respondents to the tobacco use
supplement, three attempts were made to reach each respon-
dent, either in person or by telephone depending on the
household's panel order, before a proxy interview with
another household member was accepted (22). Response
rates for the tobacco use supplement for eligible CPS
respondents were 88.5, 89.1, and 86.1 percent for
September, January, and May, respectively. Overall, 82 per-
cent of supplement respondents for smoking status (preva-
lence) were self-respondents.
Because the public-use data files for these three surveys
include weighting variables for all respondents (n 
291,054) and for self-respondents (n  237,733), popula-
tion estimates could be determined. The weights are com-
puted to be consistent with 1990 US Census totals based on
state population and are representative of the US population
by gender, age, and race/ethnicity distributions. Persons for
whom data were missing (<1 percent) for smoking status
were omitted from the analysis.
Cigarette price. Each November, The Tobacco Institute
publishes the weighted average price per pack of cigarettes
for each US state and the District of Columbia (23). The
price analyzed includes state and federal (but not local)
excise taxes and state (but not local) sales tax. The weight-
ing reflects the brand mix, whether the cigarettes were pur-
chased by the pack or the carton, and the type of store in
which the cigarettes were purchased. However, the weights
are national rather than state specific. We did not attempt to
adjust cigarette price by a cost-of-living indicator for each
state because there is no agreed-upon method for accom-
plishing such an adjustment.
Cigarette sales. The Tobacco Institute also compiles
data and reports on tax payments from all packs of cigarettes
removed from wholesale warehouses to retail outlets within
each state (24). The reporting unit is the number of cigarette
packs on which taxes were paid in any given month. The
present analysis included data from February 1983 through
March 1997. While consumption estimates obtained from
this source are subject to monthly and seasonal variations
that are business related rather than reflect variation in con-
sumption patterns, these data are gathered uniformly across
states and are the usual source for estimates of national per
capita cigarette consumption. This data source is used by
both the US Surgeon General's Office for its reports on
smoking and health and by the US Department of
Agriculture (25).
Measures of smoking behavior
Smoking prevalence. CPS respondents were asked,
"Have you (or the person responded for) smoked at least
100 cigarettes in your (his or her) entire life?" Those with
"yes" responses were considered ever smokers and were
asked a second question: "Do you (or the person responded
for) now smoke cigarettes every day, some days, or not at
all?"
We computed the percentage of current smokers (defined
as those who smoked at least 100 cigarettes in their lifetime
and indicated at the time of the survey that they smoked
either every day or some days) among adults aged >24 years
Tobacco Control Initial Outcomes Index 729
Am J Epidemiol Vol. 152, No. 8, 2000
and also considered the percentage of current smokers
among young people aged 15­24 years. Both self- and
proxy reports of smoking status were included in the deter-
mination of smoking prevalence.
Per capita cigarette consumption. Changes in total ciga-
rette sales within a state may not be related to changes in
smoking behavior if the population of that state has
changed. We estimated per capita consumption for a given
state in any given year by using US Bureau of the Census
estimates for the state population aged 18 years. We fol-
lowed the Surgeon General's age criterion of 18 years (9)
because only about 1 percent of the cigarettes sold in the
United States are smoked by people aged 18 years (26). We
used decade US Census population data computed as of
April 1, 1980 and 1990 and supplemental within-decade
estimates computed as of July 1 of each year (27, 28). To
obtain monthly estimates of state populations, we interpo-
lated from regression lines fitted to the yearly census data.
Our per capita consumption estimates were based on the
total number of packs removed from wholesale warehouses
in a given month divided by the population estimate for that
month. Since retail outlets appear to stock up on cigarettes
in the last month of both the fiscal and calendar years, we
partially removed this source of variation by considering
bimonthly averages (e.g., December/January, February/
March). To further distinguish the underlying or deseasonal-
ized trends, we applied the SABL procedure (available in
the statistical package S-Plus) to the bimonthly data (29,
30). As a point estimate of per capita cigarette consumption
for 1992­1993, we considered the mean per capita con-
sumption for the 10-month period from August/September
1992 through April/May 1993, a period that encompassed
the CPS tobacco use supplements.
Measures of tobacco control initial outcomes
Cigarette price. We used the mean of the weighted aver-
age price of cigarettes for November 1992 and November
1993 to adjust for price fluctuations during the period corre-
sponding to the interval during which CPS data were col-
lected. During this period, 16 states increased their tobacco
excise taxes (13­65 cents), and the federal excise tax on cig-
arettes increased by 4 cents on January 1, 1993. However, in
most states, the weighted average per-pack price of ciga-
rettes was 5­15 cents lower in November 1993 than it was
in November 1992 as a result of a tobacco industry price cut
for premium brands of cigarettes (31).
Workplace smoking bans. CPS tobacco use supplement
self-respondents were asked, "Which of these best describes
the area in which you work most of the time?" A response
indicating that the person worked indoors and outside the
home and was not self-employed led to a further question,
"Does your place of work have an official policy that restricts
smoking in any way?" Those who answered "yes" were then
asked, "Which of these best describes your place of work's
smoking policy for work areas?" and "Which of these best
describes your place of work's smoking policy for indoor pub-
lic or common areas?" Those who reported that smoking was
"not allowed" (one of the response choices) in any work areas
and was "not allowed" in any public areas were considered to
be covered by a workplace smoking ban. State workplace
smoking ban status was calculated as the percentage of self-
respondent ever smokers aged 15 years who were eligible to
be asked the questions regarding a workplace smoking ban.
Percentage of ever smokers was used because smoking bans
would be more likely to influence current and former smokers
than never smokers. The only possible behavioral effect on
never smokers would be to prevent smoking uptake in some
young people (aged 15­24 years) by making it difficult for
them to establish nicotine tolerance. Current smokers may
modify their smoking behavior in response to bans, and for-
mer smokers may be less likely to relapse if they work where
they cannot smoke. Recent former smokers may also have
quit in response to smoking bans.
Home smoking bans. CPS tobacco use supplement self-
respondents were also asked about the existence of smoking
restrictions in their homes: "Which statement best describes
the rules about smoking in your home?"We considered a home
smoking ban to be in place if the respondent indicated that "no
one is allowed to smoke anywhere." As defined for workplace
smoking bans, state home smoking ban status was taken as the
percentage of self-respondent ever smokers aged 15 years
that reported a home smoking ban. Since all household persons
aged 15 years responded to the full tobacco use supplement,
discrepant reporting was possible about the existence of a
home smoking ban. Although agreement concerning the exis-
tence of a home smoking ban was high, it was not perfect.
Statistical analysis
For each of the three index factors--cigarette price per
pack, workplace smoking bans among ever smokers, and
home smoking bans among ever smokers--we computed z
scores for each of the 51 states. Next, we summed the z scores
for the three factors to form a tobacco control IOI and com-
puted a Cronbach's alpha coefficient (32). The IOI was then
correlated (Pearson's) with adult and youth smoking preva-
lence and the point estimate of per capita cigarette consump-
tion. Correlation coefficients were also computed for the
index component variable z scores among themselves and
with prevalence and the point estimate of per capita cigarette
consumption.
Finally, we classified the states into three groups based on
tertiles (n  17 each) of the IOI. Mean smoking prevalence
and per capita cigarette consumption (from the point estimates
for each state) among the three groups of 17 states were com-
pared by using analysis of variance with correction for multi-
ple comparisons (two-tailed Bonferroni's method). As
described above, we also plotted the bimonthly raw per capita
data from February/March 1984 to February/March 1997 for
each tertile group along with the deseasonalized trends.
RESULTS
Tobacco control IOI
Cigarette prices varied considerably among the 51 states;
they ranged from a high of 229.7 cents per pack in Hawaii to
730 Gilpin et al.
Am J Epidemiol Vol. 152, No. 8, 2000
a low of 147.6 cents per pack in Kentucky. The mean cigarette
price over all 51 states was 184.4 cents per pack. The per-
centage of ever smokers living in households with a home
smoking ban varied more than threefold, from a high of 42.2
percent in Utah to a low of 12.5 percent in Kentucky. The
overall mean was 26.6 percent. Finally, the percentage of ever
smokers working in an indoor setting with reported work-
place smoking bans also varied by about a factor of 2.5, from
a high of 61.1 percent in Washington State to a low of 24.9
percent in Kentucky; overall, the mean was 46.6 percent.
When the z scores for all three factors (cigarette price per
pack, workplace smoking bans, home smoking bans) were
summed, Washington State had the highest IOI, indicating the
most evidence of tobacco control activity. California was a
close second, Utah was third (despite its relatively lower
average cigarette price), and Kentucky ranked by far the low-
est. The Cronbach's alpha coefficient for the IOI was 0.78.
Table 1 shows the correlations among the index factors' z
scores that comprise the IOI and for each factor with adult
smoking prevalence, youth smoking prevalence, and the
point estimate of per capita cigarette consumption. The rel-
ative level of ever smokers in each state who were indoor
workers with workplace smoking bans was highly corre-
lated with the relative level of ever smokers with home
smoking bans. The correlations of these factors with ciga-
rette price were not as strong. All three index factors showed
a significant relation to the outcome measures of adult
smoking prevalence and per capita cigarette consumption.
However, the relations were weaker for youth smoking
prevalence, and only the correlation of home smoking bans
with youth smoking prevalence was statistically significant.
Of note is that price correlated highly with per capita ciga-
rette consumption but less strongly with adult smoking
prevalence.
Correlation of the IOI with prevalence and consumption
The IOI scores for the states were highly correlated with
the statewide prevalence of cigarette smoking among adults
aged 25 years (r  ­0.70, p < 0.0001, figure 1) but were
less well correlated with the prevalence of smoking among
young people aged 15­24 years (r  ­0.34, p < 0.05, fig-
ure 2). There was also a strong and significant relation
between the IOI and the point estimate of per capita ciga-
rette consumption (r  ­0.73, p < 0.0001, figure 3). When
Kentucky was omitted from the correlation analysis, the
correlations of IOI with adult smoking prevalence, youth
smoking prevalence, and per capita cigarette consumption
were ­0.64 (p < 0.0001), ­0.27 (p  0.056), and ­0.67 (p <
0.0001), respectively.
Grouping of states by IOI tertiles
Tables 2­4 show the US states in each of the three tertile
groups and the data used to determine the state z score, the
resultant z score, and the final index, which is the sum of the
z scores for each of the three factors. Also displayed are esti-
mates of the prevalence of smoking in individual states
computed from the 1992­1993 CPS data and the point esti-
mates of per capita cigarette consumption. At the bottom of
each table is the mean value for each of the index factors and
the smoking behavior measures (refer to the Materials and
Methods section).
Figure 4 plots the state-specific estimates of smoking
prevalence for adults (aged 25 years) in the states in each
tertile group. The dashed line shows the overall prevalence
estimate for this age group in the United States as 24.0 per-
cent. The mean adult smoking prevalence was not signifi-
cantly lower for the states in the highest IOI tertile (23.3 per-
cent) compared with the prevalence over all states in the
middle tertile (24.2 percent), but the smoking prevalence
estimates for both the highest and middle tertile groups were
significantly lower than the prevalence estimate for the low-
est tertile group (26.9 percent). In the highest IOI group, the
state-specific smoking prevalence ranged from a high of
28.0 percent in Maine to a low of 17.5 percent in Utah. The
smoking prevalence estimates for five states in this group
were higher than the overall US prevalence estimate. In the
middle group, prevalence ranged from a high of 29.1 per-
cent in Nevada to a low of 21.4 percent in Massachusetts. In
10 states in this group, the prevalence estimate was higher
than the overall US average. The state-specific prevalence in
the lowest group ranged from a high of 32.1 percent in
Kentucky to a low of 23.4 percent in Iowa. In 15 states in

this group, the smoking prevalence estimates were higher
than the overall US average. The mean adult smoking preva-
lences for the highest and middle tertiles were significantly
different from that of the lowest tertile (overall analysis of
variance, followed by pairwise comparisons, p < 0.05).
As the relatively weak correlations in table 1 suggest, the
tertile group means for youth smoking prevalence were not
significantly different, and prevalence varied considerably
within groups. For instance, in the lowest tertile group (table
4), youth smoking prevalence ranged from a high of 26.4
percent in West Virginia to a low of 14.1 percent in
Mississippi. California and Utah, both in the highest tertile
group (table 2), were the only other two states whose youth
smoking prevalences were lower than that in Mississippi.
The prevalence for Maine, also in the highest tertile group,
was 25.5 percent, close to that for West Virginia.
In the highest tertile group, per capita cigarette consump-
tion ranged from a low of 6.3 packs per month in Hawaii to
a high of 12.7 packs per month in Vermont, with a mean of
9.1. In the middle tertile group, per capita consumption

to 18.0 packs per month in Kentucky, for a mean of 12.2.
The mean per capita consumption for the highest tertile
group was statistically significantly different from the two
lowest tertile groups (overall analysis of variance, followed
by pairwise comparisons, p < 0.05).
Figure 5 shows the bimonthly raw per capita cigarette
consumption data and the SABL deseasonalized trends for
the three groups of states from February/March 1983 to
February/March 1997. Before 1991, per capita cigarette
consumption in the tertile groups seemed to be different,
but the downward trends were roughly parallel. Between
1991 and 1994, the downward trends for the highest and
middle groups continued, but the downward trend for the
lowest IOI group seemed to diminish. After 1994, the trend
for the lowest tertile group indicated an increase in con-
sumption, the middle tertile group no longer showed a
downward trend, and the trend for the highest group was
still downward.
DISCUSSION
Our analyses indicate that tobacco control initial out-
comes are substantially and inversely correlated with smok-
ing prevalence and per capita cigarette consumption. It is
possible that states that have a high level of tobacco control
advocacy produce initial outcomes that affect smoking
prevalence and cigarette consumption, but it also may be the
case that states that have lower levels of prevalence and con-
sumption are politically more able to advocate for tobacco
control policy that produces initial outcomes. The diverging
trends for tobacco consumption in the tertile groups deter-
mined from the IOI after 1992­1993, the time period for the
data used in the correlation analysis, suggest that the level of
initial outcomes does influence final outcomes rather than
vice versa. A more comprehensive time-series analysis that
accounts for secular trend and population differences is
needed to demonstrate that initial outcomes lead to lower
consumption over time. Nonetheless, when one state is com-
pared with others in the evaluation of its tobacco control
program, it would be important to know each state's IOI
standing.

There were significant correlations among the IOI com-
ponents, which is to be expected, since most current tobacco
control programs use a shotgun approach. The multiple
interventions may exhibit some degree of synergy. For
instance, a smoker who works where smoking is banned
may be more likely to agree to a smoking ban at home.
When additional standard and widely available measures for
initial outcomes become available, it is likely that they will
correlate with these components and among themselves. It
will be important to keep the index parsimonious and add
only those variables that have been demonstrated to be
related to smoking behavior and that vary considerably
among the states. Other possible additional factors include
assessment of actual state or local antitobacco legislation
and a measure of exposure to antitobacco-related media (8).
Although there were significant and strong correlations
between both the IOI components and the overall index with
per capita cigarette consumption and adult (aged 25 years)
smoking prevalence, only home smoking bans were corre-
lated with smoking prevalence for young people aged
15­24-years. The youth smoking prevalence estimates were
less precise than the adult ones because of small state-level
sample sizes. Also, proxy reports of smoking status for
younger people may be more likely to be in error, because
more people in this age group are occasional smokers (33).
Both of these factors may hinder detection of any underly-
ing relation that might exist between prevalence and work-
place smoking bans or cigarette price. The fact that only
about 16 percent of the younger people in our study were
indoor workers further limited the possibility of detecting a
relation. The lack of a significant relation between price and
youth smoking prevalence is more difficult to explain. Most
evidence of a price effect on youth smoking comes from
econometric analyses of cross-sectional data (34­36). A
number of research projects are currently investigating this
issue further, some in the setting of multistate longitudinal
studies. Perhaps it will be essential that initial outcomes
more directly related to youth smoking, such as success in
restricting access or tobacco advertising and promotions,
will be required to develop a useful index for the younger
population.
We considered using different definitions of tobacco con-
trol initial outcomes in the index. The amount of new state
excise taxes adopted between 1989 and early 1993 would
have been a fairly direct measure of an initial outcome from
tobacco control activity. However, the price data we used

included both federal and state excise taxes and sales taxes.
Furthermore, since the tobacco companies can manipulate
the price of cigarettes (31), tax increases may not always be
reflected in cigarette price. The CPS data provided a rea-
sonably accurate estimation of workplace smoking bans
based on workers' self-report of the types of smoking
restrictions at their workplace. In the future, information
from the National Cancer Institute's State Cancer
Legislative Database (12) could also be included; this data-
base would provide information concerning the type of state
legislation restricting workplace smoking in effect in each
state.
Interestingly, as in previous analyses (37), current smok-
ers who worked indoors were less likely to report workplace
smoking bans (36 percent) than were former or never smok-
ers (both 49 percent). We repeated the entire analysis by
considering all indoor workers, regardless of smoking sta-
tus, and just current smokers (rather than ever smokers), and
the results were only slightly different. Another potential
definitional problem was an inconsistency in the report of
home smoking bans. Reanalyzing the data (counting a report
by an ever smoker of a home smoking ban only if all other
adults in the home also reported the ban) did not improve the
correlation of this variable with smoking prevalence.
Because both workplace and home smoking bans might be
considered an indication of societal norms rather than a
direct influence on smoking behavior, home smoking bans
were also analyzed for the entire population, not just for
ever smokers. Since there was a very high correlation (r 
0.96) between the two measures, the results changed only
slightly. Finally, we examined the percentage of ever smok-
ers in each state with workplace and home smoking bans
computed only for those aged 25 years, which would cor-
respond to the adult population considered in the present
study; again, the results changed very little.
As one measure of smoking behavior, we used the num-
ber of packs of cigarettes removed from wholesale to retail
outlets as a surrogate measure of per capita cigarette con-
sumption. However, some cigarettes sold are probably never
smoked, and cigarettes that smokers acquire from other than
retail outlets (e.g., military bases, Indian reservations, state
or national cross-border smuggling) are not included.
Econometric models could potentially account for the
impact of these and other factors (e.g., differences in state
demographic composition) on consumption (38), and such
refinements might improve the correlation of per capita con-
sumption with the IOI. When the mean self-reported daily
cigarette consumption for smokers included in the CPS was
used instead of the sales data as a measure of cigarette con-
sumption in each state, the correlation with the IOI was
somewhat lower (r  0.64, p < 0.0001). As expected,
reported daily cigarette consumption and per capita con-
sumption computed from the sales data were substantially
correlated (r  0.74, p < 0.0001). We also were concerned
that smoking prevalence may vary among states more
because of demographic factors than because of tobacco
control activity. However, a partial correlation analysis that
adjusted for the state population percentages of females,
Tobacco Control Initial Outcomes Index 737
Am J Epidemiol Vol. 152, No. 8, 2000
African Americans, and Hispanics and for median age
changed the results only slightly.
Despite these potential limitations, the correlations
between the tobacco control IOI and the adult smoking
prevalence and per capita cigarette consumption are signifi-
cant, fairly strong, and robust with respect to variations in
definition and analysis. The observed trends in per capita
consumption (figure 5) support the hypothesis that those
states that have more tobacco control initial outcomes are
reducing consumption more than states with lower levels of
these outcomes. It is interesting that tobacco-growing states
(e.g., Kentucky, Tennessee, North Carolina, South Carolina,
and West Virginia) were all included in the lowest tertile
group, which suggests that if there is significant economic
dependence on tobacco, there also may be more resistance
to efforts to reduce tobacco use.
Whether the IOI will be associated with changes in state-
level adult smoking prevalence must await further data and
analyses. However, our findings that price was related more
strongly to per capita consumption than to adult smoking
prevalence and that the correlation of the IOI with con-
sumption was marginally greater than it was with preva-
lence suggest that the relation of the IOI to declines in
prevalence may be less strong than for consumption.
Smokers may take many years to quit successfully (39) but
respond in the short term to tobacco control interventions by
reducing their consumption (40).
Ranking of tobacco control activity by the IOI should,
over time, prove useful in determining whether statewide
tobacco control efforts are producing initial outcomes that
should eventually lead to reduced smoking. It is expected
that states with the relatively highest IOI scores will eventu-
ally see the greatest declines in smoking. Furthermore, low
scores may provide an incentive for some states to adopt
new tobacco control measures.
