Banks in India have focused on non-interest income streams to complement their income
from traditional interest earning activities for some years now. This move to innova-
tion adoption and new income streams has been more pronounced for new private and
foreign banks, while there appears to have been certain hesitation on the part of public
sector and old private banks. This article studies the impact of the move to new income
streams and the consequent rising diversification on performance (as measured by prof-
itability and stability of income) for Indian banks.
A comparative analysis of income generated from these income streams for different
bank groups in India shows that new private banks and foreign banks in India have
been more successful than public sector banks in generating a greater proportion of
their income from non-interest and fee-based sources. However, this increasing diver-
sification cannot be linked to better risk-adjusted performance in the Indian context.
Using multiple regression analysis, the impact of diversification and increasing share
of fee-based income on profitability and risk-adjusted profitability is questioned for all
banks in India over the period 2005­2012.
The article finds that the rising share of fee-based income and non-interest income in
total income and diversification has a positive impact on profitability, but the impact
on risk-adjusted performance and hence stability is not statistically significant. While
the results show a positive impact of diversification on profitability, the article under-
lines that the impact direction of diversification measures may be negative, which is
in agreement to what many studies have shown in the US, European, Australian and
Indian contexts.
This article considers the impact of diversification in non-interest income separately
from diversification in total income. This diversification score helps to know if the banks
are generating their non-interest income from only fee income or only their own invest-
ments or have they diversified the non-interest income generation by focusing on both.
Importantly, there is a positive impact of increasing share of `fee income' in both total
income and non-interest income on profitability as well as risk-adjusted measures. The
results underscore that while public sector banks need to generate more income from
fee-based activities, it would be imperative to choose sources of fee-based income that
remain stable and have a positive impact on risk-adjusted measures.

28 BANKING INNOVATIONS AND NEW INCOME STREAMS: IMPACT ON BANKS' PERFORMANCE
VIKALPA · VOLUME 40 · ISSUE 1 · JANUARY-MARCH 2015 29
Innovation, one of the key drivers of growth, has
been defined by the Oxford Dictionaries,1 simply,
as a new method, idea, product, etc. Innovation
is a long process depending critically on recogni-
tion of new, external information, assimilating it and
applying it to commercial ends (Cohen & Levinthal,
1990). Along this process, several of the new concepts
may get waylaid even in the gestation period and be
forced to exit. There are coherent patterns in the stimuli
for innovation, types of innovation, and in barriers to
innovation, including economic barriers (Utterback
& Abernathy, 1975). Economic barriers to innovation
can include the need to create necessary incentives for
adoption and for destabilization of incumbents (see,
for example, Morris, 1986).
This appears to be especially relevant while discussing
innovative bank income streams in the Indian context.
Innovation in banking has encapsulated new tech-
nology and channels, new products and services, new
markets and institutions and new business models.
This has led the banks to diversify into new income
streams comprising non-interest income, of which
fee income is a crucial component. This article asks
whether the move to innovation in income streams
and the consequent rising diversification in income
has impacted profitability and stability of income posi-
tively for Indian banks. While banks have adopted
new income streams owing to an overriding concern
to reduce dependence of profitability on fund-based
sources and diversify the income generation, the conse-
quences in terms of stability of earnings seems unclear.
While some studies (see, for example, Busch & Kick,
2009; Davis & Tuori, 2000; Smith, Staikouras & Wood,
2003) point to a positive impact of diversification on
financial performance and risk profile, others show a
negative impact of the move into fee-based activities
on risk-adjusted performance of banks (De Young &
Roland, 2001; Stiroh, 2004; Stiroh & Rumble, 2006). In
the Indian context, RBI's former Deputy Governor,
Gopinath (2011) indicated that fee-based income may
not be less risky than traditional lending activities and
there is a need to understand the underlying risks and
effectively monitor the provision of such services.
Diversification has been more pronounced for banks in
the United States and Europe. De Young and Rice (2001)
observed that between 1980 and 2001, non-interest
income in the US commercial banking system increased
from 0.77 per cent to 2.39 per cent of the aggregate
banking industry assets, and increased from 20.31 per
cent to 42.20 per cent of the aggregate banking industry
operating income. For developed countries, Kaufman
and Larry (1994) showed an increase in the share of
non-interest income to total income in the banking
sectors of most developed countries between 1982 and
1990. Esho et al. (2004) pointed out that Australian
credit unions diversified their activities in the 1990s to
reduce their reliance on interest revenue which took
three primary forms: (i) a change in pricing policy with
transaction fees on loans and deposits; (ii) new finan-
cial services including insurance, funds management
and off-balance sheet activities that generated commis-
sions and facility fees; and (iii) shift in the portfolio mix
of assets away from personal loans and advances into
residential lending.
Importantly, Feldman and Schmidt (1999) pointed
out that the composition of non-interest income had
been changing for the US economy with fee income
becoming the dominant source of non-interest income
received by banks made possible by technological and
regulatory changes opening up new sources of non-
interest income.
Gamra and Plihon (2011) suggested that emerging
market banks are required to innovate in services and
products, to differentiate strategies, and fundamen-
tally transform their business into a much wider array
of non-traditional services. This article shows that from
1997 to late 2007, emerging market banks saw non-
interest income as a share of net operating revenue
rise from 28.2 per cent to around 36.7 per cent with the
biggest increase of non-interest income being in trading.
The shift towards non-interest income has been
significant for Indian banking. Umakrishnan and
Bandopadhyay (2005) compared the difference in
income composition for new generation private sector
banks, foreign banks, public sector and cooperative
banks during 1999­2004 and concluded that the share
of interest income in total income had been declining
over the years. The RBI Report on International Trade
in Banking Services (2010) showed that foreign bank
branches operating in India had been more successful in
generating income from fee-based services than Indian
banks' branches operating outside India. Interestingly,
the report also pointed out that while for foreign banks
operating in India, derivative, stock, securities, foreign
exchange trading services' and `financial consultancy
and advisory services' were the major source of fee
income, for Indian banks operating abroad, the largest
proportion of fee income came from `credit-related
30 BANKING INNOVATIONS AND NEW INCOME STREAMS: IMPACT ON BANKS' PERFORMANCE
services' and `trade­finance related services'. Uppal
(2010) showed that for banks in India, interest income
was continuously decreasing on account of deregu-
lation in interest rates and non-interest income was
rising. Sahoo and Mishra (2012) related greater extent
of operational diversification in banks with greater
fluctuations in financial performance.
Much of such shift in the Indian context has been
contributed by the private sector and the foreign sector.
Private sector banks and foreign banks in India have
been successful in generating a greater proportion of
their income from fee-based sources, while public sector
banks in India have lagged behind in this context. In the
recent years, there have been increasing efforts by public
sector banks to reduce dependence on fund-based
sources majorly through sale of third party products.
However, as Table 1 shows, the proportion of non-in-
terest income in total income has not changed much
for public sector banks, implying a full-fledged resist-
ance in adoption of non-interest streams. The economic
explanation of such behaviour could be that banks are
unsure of the strategic implications of such a shift.

The primary role of a bank is to accept deposits and
make loans, profit being the difference between the costs
of deposits and the earnings from lending. However,
in the last two decades, the environment facing banks
have changed drastically, with banks' income no longer
confined to lending and income generated from its
own funds. Fee-based income or income earned from
sources that do not involve exposure to bank's own
funds is globally becoming more and more important
for the bank's income statement.
Following the methodology of diversification scores
developed by Stiroh and Rumble (2006), this article
uses such diversification scores generated for a
comparative analysis of bank groups in India. Using
multiple regression analysis, it questions the impact
of diversification and increasing share of fee-based
income on profitability and risk-adjusted profitability
measures for all banks in India over the period 2005­
2012. The article thus tries to delve into the diversi-
fication brought about by the move to innovative
income sources and its impact on bank profitability
and income stability.
LITERATURE REVIEW
The primary role of banks as intermediaries chan-
nelizing savings into investments is underlined by
deposit-taking and lending activities. Smith et al. (2003)
pointed out that while the basic functions of banks and
other financial service companies remained relatively
constant over time, these functions are now being
provided through different products and services.
Economic forces have led to financial innovations, in
turn fostering competition and diminished to an extent
of cost advantage. Traditional banking, as a result, has
lost profitability, with banks diversifying into new
activities that may bring higher returns.
The shift of banks towards new business lines and
fee-based income has been more prominent in devel-
oped countries and therefore much of such litera-
ture has emanated from the banking industries of
Europe and the US. De Young and Rice (2004b) docu-
mented that for the US economy, a part of increases
in non-interest income flow was coming from new
lines of business made possible by deregulations
introduced since 1990s while a part stemmed from
producing traditional banking services with new
production processes that were made possible by
advances in information technology, communications
channels and financial processes.
In this context, a vital question being raised in economic
literature is whether the growth in income from
fee-based activities has contributed to greater stability
in bank income. Davis and Tuori (2000) showed that
banks obtained diversification benefits in increasing
non-interest income, which in turn helped to smooth
profitability. Smith et al. (2003) examined the varia-
bility of interest and non-interest income and their
correlation for banking systems of EU countries for the
period 1994­1998. This article finds that an increased
importance of non-interest income for most bank cate-
gories have stabilized profits in the European banking
system in the given years. However, it does not estab-
lish that non-interest income is invariably more stable
than interest income.
VIKALPA · VOLUME 40 · ISSUE 1 · JANUARY-MARCH 2015 31
Chiorazzo, Milani and Salvini (2008) found that
income diversification increased risk-adjusted returns
for Italian banks during the period 1993­2003. Busch
and Kick (2009), studying the impact of growth of
non-interest income on the financial performance and
risk profile of German banks between 1995 and 2005,
found evidence that risk-adjusted returns on equity
and total assets had both been positively affected
by higher fee income activities for German universal
banks. They also found that savings and commer-
cial banks having a greater share of fee-based income
charged lower interest margins, implying subsidization
between interest and fee business.
Inaba and Hattori (2007) showed that Japanese commer-
cial banks had also been expanding their fee-based
business and found a positive correlation between
Japanese commercial banks' fee business income and
net interest income in the second half of the 1990s. They
pointed out that this relationship led to an increase in
the variability of their Return on Assets (ROA) but did
not affect their management stability over that period.
However, during 2001­2005, such a positive correlation
was not clearly observed.
Umakrishnan and Bandopadhyay (2005) indicated that
diversifying to fee-based income was a more viable
option for banks in the long run and needed constant
feel of the market requirement, innovation and skill
upgradation. Arora and Kaur (2009) examined the
internal determinants for diversification of banks in
India using aggregate bank level data for foreign sector
banks, nationalized banks, private banks and the SBI
group. They found that risk, cost of production, regu-
latory cost and technological change were very signif-
icant for bringing variation in the income structure of
the banks.
However, many studies pointed to a greater depend-
ence on non-interest income contributing to increased
volatility in bank income. De Young and Roland (2001)
and Stiroh (2004) found this to hold for the US firms.
De Young and Roland (2001), analysing the quarterly
movements in revenues and profits at 472 large and
medium-sized banks between 1988 and 1995, found
that earning volatility increased with greater share
of revenue coming from fee-based activities. They
pointed out three reasons why fee-based income may
not be more stable than traditional banking activities.
First, banks may have qualitatively different relation-
ships with their fee-based customers as opposed to
their traditional banking customers, the relationship
with the latter tending to be stronger. For example,
during a downturn, the fall in revenue from fee-based
income like mutual fund sales may be sharp while
interest earnings from lending activities is not likely
to fluctuate much. Second, expanding production
of fee-based activities requires much greater fixed
costs than increasing production of lending activities.
Third, as fee-based activities do not require banks to
hold capital against them, banks can take advantage
of this to raise return to equity. This creates incen-
tives for banks to arbitrage risk-based capital regu-
lations by transforming on-balance sheet risk from
interest-based activities to off-balance sheet risk from
fee-based activities.
De Young and Rice (2003) showed that large banks
tended to generate relatively more non-interest income.
The article also found that well-managed banks relied
less heavily on non-interest income while relation-
ship banking tended to generate non-interest income.
Further, some technological advances (e.g., cash-
less transactions, mutual funds) are associated with
increased non-interest income while other technolog-
ical advances (e.g., loan securitization) are associated
with reduced non-interest income at banks.
Stiroh (2004), examining the link between risk-ad-
justed bank performance and diversification for
community banks from 1984 to 2000, showed that
higher non-interest income was negatively linked with
risk-adjusted performance. Esho et al. (2004) pointed
out, in their study spanning 198 Australian credit
unions, that increased reliance on fee income gener-
ating activities was associated with increased risk.
Stiroh and Rumble (2006) showed that diversification
benefits were more than offset by increased exposure
to non-interest activities. These non-interest activi-
ties were volatile but not more profitable than lending
activities. Stiroh and Rumble (2006) decomposed
the impact of the move to greater fee-based activities
into a `direct exposure effect' (coming from a greater
dependence on new activities) and an `indirect diver-
sification effect' (coming from the resultant change in
revenue concentration). Analysing the performance of
the US financial holding companies (FHCs) from 1997
to 2002, this article showed that while FHCs adopted
`cross-selling' for diversifying revenue and lowering
costs, this actually meant exposure to multiple income
streams with similar shocks and the greater correlation
across revenue streams significantly hampered diversi-
fication benefits.
32 BANKING INNOVATIONS AND NEW INCOME STREAMS: IMPACT ON BANKS' PERFORMANCE
Vallascas, Crepi and Hagendorff (2011), analysing the
impact of income diversification on the performance of
Italian banks during the recent financial crisis, showed
that institutions which were diversified before the
crisis experienced the largest decline in performance
during the financial crisis.
In the Indian context, Sahoo and Mishra (2012) found
that the banks with greater extent of operational
diversification suffered from the problem of greater
fluctuations in financial performance and a larger
asset base did not necessarily help a bank to bring
in stability in its financial performance. Moreover,
greater efforts by the banks towards creating entry
barrier or image advantage raised fluctuations in their
financial performance.
While banks in India have recognized the impor-
tance of raising income from fee-based income activ-
ities and thereby reducing the dependence on fund-
based income, there are many challenges in the way
of moving to more fee-based activities and sustaining
them, especially for public sector banks. It may be that,
banks face certain barriers to adopting the orientation
relevant to such new business lines, recognizing that
fee-based income may not contribute to stable income
and that the right choice of activities for income diver-
sification are unclear.
DEFINITIONS AND METHODOLOGY
The empirical analysis uses data on revenue sources and
performance measures of banks in India for the period
2005­2012. The key variables to be used are identified
and the importance of these variables is discussed in
the context of the study.
Variables Definitions
Diversification Scores
Following methodological construct of Stiroh and
Rumble (2006), diversification scores are built for the
banks. In this article, `two' diversification ratios are
considered. The first considers the diversification in
bank income into interest and non-interest income and
the second considers the diversification of non-interest
income into `commission, exchange and brokerage
income' and other components. `Other Income' for
banks in India comprises of `commission, exchange and
brokerage', net profit (loss) on sale of investments, net
profit (loss) on revaluation of investments, net profit
(loss) on sale of land and other assets, net profit (loss)
on exchange transactions, and miscellaneous income.
In the study, the income from `commission, exchange
and brokerage' is denoted as `fee income'.2
This methodologically improves upon the existing
literature by introducing a diversification score for
non-interest income which will help to underline
`how' banks are generating their non-interest income.
The components of non-interest income other than fee
income are largely income generated from the bank's
own investment. This diversification score thus helps
to know if the banks are generating their non-interest
income from only fee income or only their own invest-
ments or they have diversified the non-interest income
generation by focusing on both.
Further, this refinement in methodology also helps to
find the impact of such diversification of non-interest
income on bank performance. This is important in the
face of many studies showing that trading/invest-
ment income tends to be volatile and generates lower
risk-adjusted returns (Gamra & Plihon, 2011; Stiroh
& Rumble, 2006; Umakrishnan & Bandopadhyay,
2005). Importantly, it is `commission, exchange, and
brokerage' which `encapsulates income being gener-
ated from provision of new services and products
by banks in the recent years'. Considering a sepa-
rate diversification score for this component implies
that focus can be on the impact of diversification of
non-interest income on profitability and stability of
income for banks. The first diversification score simply
sees the impact of diversified income on bank perfor-
mance. However, the second diversification score goes
beyond that to underline the impact of the banks'
movement into `newer income streams' (which had
the most profound impact on `fee income' in the years
under study) on bank performance.
It helps to analyse whether with banks focusing on
generating non-interest income, the movement to
newer income streams (which will raise `fee income')
should bring in better performance or should the banks
focus more on income from their own investments to
positively impact profitability and stability. Further,
the focus can also be on the `distribution' of non-in-
terest income into fee-based and other components of
non-interest income.
Further, along with studying the impact of the share
of fee income in total income (SH
FEE
), and the share of
non-interest income in total income (SH
NON
) on bank
VIKALPA · VOLUME 40 · ISSUE 1 · JANUARY-MARCH 2015 33
performance, the article also considers the impact of the
share of fee-income in non-interest income (SH
FOT
) on
bank performance. It becomes crucial to consider sepa-
rately the income generated from `fee income', along
with `other or non-interest income' to see the implica-
tion of both the increasing share of non-interest income
and the increasing `fee-income' in non-interest income
on bank profitability and stability.
Thus, diversification scores are generated from these
two different indicators. Following methodological
construct of Stiroh and Rumble (2006), diversification
scores are defined as follows:
DIV (1) = 1 ­ (SH
NON
2 + SH
IN
2)(1)
DIV(2) = 1 ­ (SH
FOT
2 + SH
OT
2)(2)
where,
SH
IN
= Share on interest income in total income
SH
NON
= Share of non-interest income or other income
in total income
SH
FOT
= Share of `fee-income' in non-interest/other
income
SH
OT
= Share of `other components'3 in non-interest/
other income
DIV 1 measures the degree of diversification in the
bank's revenue and a higher score reflects a greater
degree of revenue diversification for the bank. A score
of zero would suggest that all of the bank's revenue is
coming from fee-based or fund-based sources, while
a score of 0.5 would mean a complete diversification.
Again DIV 2 reflects the diversification in non-in-
terest income. Thus, a score of zero would suggest
that the bank is generating all its non-interest income
from either `fee-income' or `other components' and a
score of 0.5 would suggest that the bank is generating
non-interest income equally from both the components.
The diversification scores are calculated from interest
income, other income and `fee income' averaged over
the period 2005­2012 for each individual bank, unlike
in Stiroh and Rumble (2006) where diversification
scores for each period were averaged.
Risk-adjusted Measures of Performance
Risk-adjusted returns on equality (RAROE) and
risk-adjusted returns on assets (RAROA) (see, for
example, Busch & Kick, 2009; Stiroh & Rumble, 2006)
are constructed as below:
RAROA ROA ROA
=  (3)
RAROE ROE ROE
=  (4)
where, ROA is the average Return on Assets for the
individual banks over the period 2005­2012, ROE is the
average Return on Equity for the individual bank over
the period 2005­2012, 
ROA
and 
ROE
represent standard
deviation of ROA and ROE. It may be seen that RAROA
and RAROE are `Sharpe ratios' defined by the average
profits divided by the standard deviation of profits and
represent profits per unit of risk.
A third measurement of risk-adjusted performance is
also introduced following Stiroh and Rumble (2006),
the `Z' score defined as:
Z RAROA E A ROA
= +
[ / ]/ (5)
where, E/A is the mean equity to asset ratio; the Z score
thus shows risk-adjusted performance, with a higher
score denoting a better performance.
Methodological Construct
1. A comparative study of the share of income coming
from fee-based activities for public sector banks4
vis-à-vis private sector banks (old and new) and
foreign banks5 is done.
2. The Z scores are compared with the diversification
ratios for banks groups.
3. For analysing the impact of diversification on
risk-adjusted performance, two basic empirical
specifications are used:

tions 1 and 2; SH
NON

FEE
are Share of `fee-in-
come' and non-interest income and other income
in total income respectively. The first specifica-
tion is denoted as Model 1, second specification as
Model 2 and the third specification as Model 3. It
may be underlined that Model 1 sees the impact
of non-interest income share and diversification of
total income on dependent variables, while Model
2 assesses the impact of `share of fee-income' in
non-interest income and diversification of non-in-
terest income on dependent variables. Model 3 sees
the impact of `share of fee-income' in total income
and diversification of non-interest income on
dependent variables.
For independent variables, both average diversifica-
tion ratios and average SH
FEE
and SH
NON
are consid-
ered. This is to ascertain that the impact of increasing
income being derived from non-interest/fee-based
sources is clearly understood. Control variables Log
(Assets) [LASS], Log (Capital) [LCAP], Ratio of Net
Non-Performing Assets to net Advances [RNPA] are
also introduced (see, for example, De Young & Rice,
2004; Stiroh & Rumble, 2006).
Data Source
Data on income, expenditure, assets, liabilities and
important ratios for banks in India over the period
2005­2011 are obtained from RBI database6, CMIE
Prowess database, and ACE Equity database. Data is
obtained on 81 banks in total as banks not in operation
in 2011 are not considered in the sample. Z scores cannot
be computed for all banks in the sample due to unavail-
ability of data on total capital for some banks in the
group. Data of the cross-sectional sample of 81 banks
in India is thus obtained, providing one observation
averaged over the period 2005­2011. Only those banks
which have data for the last year, 2011, are included.
This means that a bank incorporated in any year from
2005 to 2010, would be included, while if it closed down
business in any year from 2005 to 2011, it would not be
included in the sample.
EMPIRICAL FINDINGS
The article considers the share of income generated
from fee-based and non-fee based sources for banks
in India over the period 2005­2011. It first presents
a comparative analysis of income generated from
fee and non-fee income for different bank groups in
India. Using diversification ratios, DIV 1 and DIV 2,
it further compares the diversification in portfolio for
banks groups in India and uses Z scores to compare
the risk-adjusted performance between different bank
groups. Additionally, the impact of diversification in
income and rising share of fee-based income in other
income on risk-adjusted performance for banks in India
is examined using regression analysis.
Distribution and Diversification of Total Income
For public sector banks, the proportion of fee-based
income in total income over the period 2005­2011 is on
an average 6.25 per cent, while for new private sector
banks and foreign banks, it is 14.41 per cent and 16.10
per cent respectively. Table 1 shows the percentage of
income coming from fee-based activities for the three
groups of banks considered in this study. As shown in
Table 1, the percentage of fee-based income (commis-
sion, exchange, and brokerage) in total income for
public sector banks has fallen marginally from 6.67
per cent in 2007 to 5.84 per cent in 2009. It stood at
6.31 per cent in 2011. For private sector banks (Old),
there has been a fall from 5.4 per cent in 2006 to 4.71
per cent in 2011.
Both private sector banks (new) and foreign banks have
been active in generating a considerable amount of
their income from fee-based services. For private banks
(new), the percentage of fee-based income (commis-
sion, exchange, and brokerage) in total income has
increased from 13.9 per cent in 2005 to 15.05 per cent in
2011. For foreign banks, percentage of fee-based income
(commission, exchange and brokerage) in total income
stood at 16.2 per cent in 2011.
Table 2 gives the percentage of `interest income' and
`other income' in total income for the three groups of
banks considered for the study. As seen from the table,
the percentage of non-interest income in total income
for public sector banks has increased from 13.71 per
cent in 2005 to 16.74 per cent in 2011. For private sector
banks (old), there has been a rise from 10.53 per cent in
2005 to 11.88 per cent in 2011. For private banks (new),
the percentage of non-interest income in total income
has increased from 21.66 per cent in 2005 to 23.15 per
cent in 2011. For foreign banks, share of non-interest
income in total income stood at 29.65 per cent in 2011.
Evidently, while for all banks, the share of non-interest
income in the total income has increased over this
period, the same cannot be said about the proportion of
VIKALPA · VOLUME 40 · ISSUE 1 · JANUARY-MARCH 2015 35
fee-income in total income which has increased mark-
edly only for new private and foreign banks. Table 3
shows the share of fee income in non-interest income
and diversification in non-interest income for different
bank groups, and Table 4 gives the diversification scores
for the different groups and their Z scores. It may be
seen that diversification of total income for public sector
banks stand at around 0.23 (DIV1) suggesting a moder-
ately diversified portfolio with low variability in diver-
sification between banks in this group. The diversifica-
tion of total income for private banks (new) is slightly
better at 0.3, and while for foreign banks, it is around
0.34 (DIV1), the variability in diversification between
banks in this group is much higher. Private banks (old)
have a moderately diversified portfolio again (DIV1 at
0.22) with higher variability in diversification compared
to public sector and new private sector banks. Z scores
giving risk-adjusted performance are the highest for
public sector banks (6.98) though with high variability
between banks in the group. While foreign banks have
low Z scores at 1.54, the variability of risk-adjusted
performance is also lower than for other bank groups.
It may also be seen from Table 5 that for the Indian
banking industry as a whole, the share of non-interest
income in the total income (SH
NON
) stands at 11 per
cent with a maximum of 51 per cent. Again the share
of fee income in total income (SH
FEE
) is 9 per cent for
the industry.
Distribution and Diversification of Non-interest
Income
It is also observed that the share of `fee income' in
non-interest income stands at an average of 46 per
cent for the Indian banking industry (Table 3). This
implies that the distribution of non-interest income
is in favour of an increasing share of fee income, also
corroborated for the different bank groups as seen in
Table 5. The diversification in total income stands at
0.27 implying a moderately diversified portfolio for
the Indian banks. However, diversification in non-in-
terest income is quite high at 0.39, implying a greater
diversification of non-interest income compared to
total income (Table 3). Looking once again at Table
5, it is observed that public sector banks not only
generate much of their non-interest income from `fee

senting a moderately diversified portfolio for the banks
in India. Diversification in non-interest income stands
higher at 0.39.
The share of income coming from commission, exchange
and brokerage activities averages around 9 per cent for
banks in India while the share of income contributed by
non-fund based activities together averages around 11
per cent for Indian banks (Table 3). The share of `fee'
income in non-interest income is high at 46 per cent.
Further, control variables (Log Assets, Log Capital,
Ratio of Non-performing Assets to Income) are intro-
duced, all of which can have potential impact on perfor-
mance (as measured by profitability and risk-adjusted
profitability). Here again, there is a wide variability in
these variables for banks in India over this period.

Analysing the impact of diversification and increasing
share of income coming from fee-based sources, using
the empirical specifications in equation (6), (7) and (8),
the author fails to accept the null hypothesis that there
is no improvement in the relation between the set of
independent variables and dependent variables when
predictor variables are added. As seen in Table 7, the
ANOVA F values are significant, for all of the three

diversified non-interest income base. Private banks
(new) have around 62 per cent of non-interest income
coming from `fee income' with high diversification of
non-interest income. Private banks (old) also have a
well-diversified non-interest income portfolio, with 40
per cent of the non-interest income coming from `fee
income'. Foreign banks have relatively lesser diversi-
fication in non-interest income, but 49 per cent of the
non-interest income is generated from `fee income'.

Impact of Diversification on Risk-adjusted
Performance
The descriptives of key dependent variables, aver-
aged over 2005­2011, as given in Table 6, show that
there is high variability in performance measures and
risk-adjusted performance for banks in India over this
period. ROA averages around 0.90 for banks in India
while ROE averages around 11.26 but with a high
variability; however, risk-adjusted performance meas-
ures (RAROA, RAROE and Z score) average around
4­4.5 with considerable variability.

The descriptive statistics for the key predictor variables
and control variables is seen in Table 3. As seen in the
table, diversification in total income (DIV1) varies from
0.1 to 0.5, with a mean of 0.27 for the sample repre-

The beta values and significance are presented in Table

shown in Table 9. The collinearity statistics suggests
that tolerance levels are high. It is seen that for the
dependent variable ROA, the impact of diversification
on total income and increasing share of fee-income in
both total income and non-interest income are signifi-
cant. However, for ROE and risk-adjusted measures,

measures. However, increasing non-interest income
in total income has positive impact direction while
increasing diversification of non-interest income may
have negative impact on profitability and risk-adjusted

cant. Again, the impact direction and beta values show
a positive impact of increasing share of `fee income' in
both total income and non-interest income on profita-
bility as well as risk-adjusted measures.

IMPLICATIONS OF RESULTS
The article questions how the innovation-led diver-
sification has been impacting bank profitability and
stability of income in the Indian context. There are
two distinct ways in which this article tries to add
to the existing body of literature. First, it tries to see
the impact of diversification in non-interest income
separately from diversification in total income. The
rationale behind this is the fact that the major compo-
nents of non-interest income in recent years have come
from innovative income streams and gestation of new
products and services which have all contributed to
increasing `fee income' and consequent diversifica-
tion of non-interest income. This is in keeping with
global and Indian studies that have focused sepa-
rately on fee-income based diversification and other
non-interest income based diversification strategies
(Gamra & Plihon, 2011; Sahoo & Mishra, 2012; Stiroh &
Rumble, 2006; Umakrishnan & Bandopadhyay, 2005).
Second, while the results show a positive impact of
diversification for profitability, the article underlines
that the impact direction of diversification in total
income on risk-adjusted measures clearly suggests the
need to choose stable sources of fee-income for future.
Moreover, the diversification in non-interest income
may not impact profitability and risk-adjusted income
positively as discussed.
Evidently, for foreign and private sector banks (new)
a greater proportion of income comes from fee-based
activities, compared to public sector banks. However,
as seen in the empirical results, while diversification
and increasing share of fee-income in total income
positively impact ROA, the impact on ROE or other
risk-adjusted performance measures is not statistically
significant. Moreover, the impact direction of diversi-
fication measures may be negative, which is in agree-
ment to what many studies have shown in the US,
European, Australian and Indian context (De Young &
Roland, 2001; Esho et al., 2004; Inaba & Hattori, 2007;
Sahoo & Mishra, 2012; Stiroh, 2004; Stiroh & Rumble,
2006). The results suggest that while public sector banks
need to generate more income from fee-based activities,
it would be imperative to choose sources of fee-based
income that remain stable and have a positive impact
on risk-adjusted measures.
The choice of income streams from which non-interest
income can be generated under these circumstances
becomes relevant. Encouragingly, greater proportion
of `fee-income' in non-interest income impacts posi-
tively both profitability and risk-adjusted performance
measures. However, diversification of non-interest
income may, in fact, negatively impact profitability or
stability of income. Economic literature points out that
the impact of fee-based income and other components
of non-interest income, especially trading income, will
be different on stability of income. Gamra and Plihon
(2011), for example, show that fee income can generate
some improvement in the risk-adjusted measures,
while trading income imply lower performance as
measured by risk-adjusted returns. Stiroh and Rumble
(2006) point to trading income as the most volatile
part of the non-interest income. Again, for fee-based
income, the choice of new products or streams can
determine the likely stability of income. Umakrishnan
and Bandopadhyay (2005) also point out in the Indian
context that investment income is the most volatile
across all ownership groups.
CONCLUSION
The article looks at the impact of new business lines and
income streams on banks' profitability and stability. It is
clear that adoption of innovations leading to new busi-
ness lines confront certain barriers even as these evolve
from gestation to implementation. Globally, the impact
VIKALPA · VOLUME 40 · ISSUE 1 · JANUARY-MARCH 2015 39
of adoption of these income streams and the consequent
diversification, on profitability and stability of income
for banks has not been clear.
In Indian banking, the move to innovation adoptions
and new income streams has been more pronounced
for new private and foreign banks, while there appears
to have been certain hesitation on the part of public
sector and old private banks. The study points out that
while the impact of diversification of both total income
and `non-interest' income (encapsulating newer income
streams) on profitability is positive and significant, the
other impact on stability is not. However, profitability
may not have become a driving force behind strategic
shifts in business orientation of banks, particularly in
respect of adoption of innovations. In such regards,
concerns over the stability of income from non-interest
income sources may be a significant economic barrier
to innovation adoption. The implications of the study
may be that banks adopting new income streams
must choose those that are likely to enhance stability
of income. As seen in the article, the distribution of
non-interest income can significantly impact stability
of income as increasing `fee-income' in non-interest
income may have a positive impact on risk-adjusted
performance. Trading income, an important compo-
nent of non-interest income, seems to be more volatile
while core service income or the fee, commision and
brokerage income generated from provision of new
products and services may lead to greater stability in
income. Future research needs to delve deeper into
these aspects of innovation led businesses that banks
may consider for adoption.
LIMITATIONS AND FUTURE RESEARCH
DIRECTION
The study has confined itself to finding the impact of
increasing diversification on performance for banks in
India, and has not delved into the impact separately
for different bank groups. This could be an important
direction of research in future. Further, on acccount of
data being unavailable on the various components of
non-interest and fee income, the impact of increasing
share of various components of fee-based income on
profitabiltiy and stability could not be analysed, which
needs to be looked into in future. This will help in
understanding which components of fee-income can
contribute to profitability and stabiltiy for banks.
