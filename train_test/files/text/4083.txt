Introduction
Social entrepreneurship (SE) is a young but yet vibrant field
undergoing conceptual definitions among practitioners and
academics (Mair, 2010). As a dynamic business model incor-
porating elements of commercialism, social involvement,
and innovation, tensions inevitably result from conflicting or
unclear objectives and responsibilities (Dey & Steyaert,
2012; Teasdale, 2012). In this context, mapping and under-
standing accountability relationships is likely to be a chal-
lenging task (Eisenberg, 2005).
Describing Accountability
Accountability is ambiguous as a term, complex and context
dependent (A. P. Williams & Taylor, 2013). From the descrip-
tive sense, it is possible to view accountability in a social
context as a holistic framework in the not-for-profit sector,
the public sector, or private sector (A. P. Williams & Taylor,
2013). Accountability can also be viewed in a legal, adminis-
trative, professional, or social framework (Bovens, 2007).
The academic literature proposes various definitions based
on the broader environment in which accountability functions.
For example, there are different models of accountability
depending on the political, bureaucratic, legal, and business
perspectives and along dimensions of vertical, lateral, and
diagonal orientations (Bovens, 2007). Accountability has also
been defined for individuals as well as for organizations where
often the proxy of an individual is used to define the account-
ability of the organization (Bovens, 2007).
Accountability has been defined as being responsible to
an audience with reward or punishment power (Brandsma &
Schillemans, 2013, p. 954), or as "the obligation to explain
and justify conduct" (Bovens, 2007, p. 9). It often involves a
relationship between parties, groups, or individuals and is a
mechanism for guiding the behavior of people involved.
One of the ways that accountability is modeled in the lit-
erature is from the viewpoint of relationships (Laughlin,
1990; Romzek & Ingraham, 2000). Romzek and Ingraham
(2000) have described a "web of accountability relationships"
(p. 241) that may create inter-party conflicts and non-optimal
solutions. The relationships can be cast in a matrix of four
quadrants describing hierarchical, legal, professional, and
political relationships classified according to levels of auton-
omy and positioning of control or expectations (p. 242).
Similarly, Behn (2001) and Sorensen (2012) have character-
ized accountability as a relationship issue between an account-
ability holder and an accountability holdee.

A Scoping Review of Accountability
in Social Entrepreneurship
Ruben Burga1 and Davar Rezania1
Abstract
The aim of this article is to do a scoping review of accountability in the context of social entrepreneurship. Social
entrepreneurship is becoming an important business model, while the concept of accountability is prevalent in today's
environment. The scoping review is a type of literature search with certain important distinctions from a literature review.
Systematically, the scoping review explores the literature from a relevance viewpoint rather than by evaluating the quality
of the research. Then the data are mapped or charted to identify key themes and gaps in the literature. We observe that
accountability in social entrepreneurship is viewed and studied in three different ways: as a relationship between parties,
as an outcome, or as a predictor variable. We also observe that most of the research is done in the United States, Europe,
and Australia. Finally we observe that research methodologies utilized are primarily based around qualitative methods or
conceptual descriptions.

Brandsma and Schillemans (2013) view the accountabil-
ity process in terms of outcomes by quantifying the transfer
of information, the concentration of bilateral discussions,
and the use of power to enforce accountability. They attempt
to map "the intensity of all three phases" (p. 960) and create
a three dimensional model of accountability within a public
institution.
However, Koppell (2005) views accountability as an inde-
pendent variable that is a predictor of dysfunction in an orga-
nization. He defines a typology that includes "transparency,
liability, controllability, responsibility, and responsiveness"
(p. 94) as elements of accountability. The problem of meeting
"conflicting expectations," according to Koppell (2005),
determines the efficiency and effectiveness of problem reso-
lution at an organizational level.
Obtaining a general sense of how accountability is described
in the literature is not straightforward. However, from the
accountability literature discussed here, three themes seem to
be predominant. Accountability can be framed from the view-
point of relationships, in terms of outcomes, and as predictors
of dysfunction.
Describing SE
SE is a recent business construct where the typical entrepre-
neurship drive for profit is also complemented by an active
concern for the environment and social issues (Austin,
Stevenson, & Wei-Skillern, 2006). The formation of SE has
been described as achieving both financial gain and providing
social benefits (Battilana, Lee, Walker, & Dorsey, 2012).
Roper and Cheney (2005) have discussed that SE is a "hybrid
between private, non-profit and public sectors" (Roper &
Cheney, 2005, p. 101). As social constructs, these types of
firms are shaped by the environment in which they are
launched which is reflected in their definition and the ambig-
uous terminology that is used around this definition (Dhesi,
2010). In North American society, SE firms generate revenue
but yet have a primary drive for social and environmental
concerns (Kerlin, 2006). The distinctions between profit-
oriented and non-profit SE firms in North America relates to
legislative nomenclature that determine a firm's taxation sta-
tus (Kerlin, 2006). From the SE field, whether they are con-
sidered for profit-oriented or non-profit has been defined by
the allocation of those profits or re-investing of those profits
into the social venture (Lepoutre, Justo, Terjesen, & Bosma,
2013). In Europe, the business model has traditionally been
oriented around community-oriented firms with less concern
about the generation of revenue for profit purposes (Kerlin,
2006). In developing countries, SE firms are agents of change
that "allows the impoverished . . . to enter the circle of eco-
nomic and social development" (Mair & Marti, 2007, p. 493).
Their institutional impact from the viewpoint of profit orien-
tation has not been extensively studied (Mair & Marti, 2007).
Globally across the academic literature, profit-oriented and
non-profit firms are currently accepted as models of the spec-
trum of SE firms (Battilana et al., 2012).
The terminology describing SE is also multi-faceted.
Light (2008) examines various components of SE and
focuses on the entrepreneurial component of these ventures.
Similar definitions are found in research articles by Dees
(1998), Lepoutre et al. (2013), and Mair and Marti (2007).
However, there are also researchers who equate social entre-
preneurial firms with social ventures (Dees & Anderson,
2003), social enterprises (Defourny & Nyssens, 2008;
Nicholls, 2009), and other similar terms linked to socially
responsible businesses (Yunus, Moingeon, & Lehmann-
Ortega, 2010). Consequently, a scoping review within the
context of SE will also need to consider some of the possible
variations of SE terminology such as social enterprise and
social ventures for completeness in the review process.
The Research Problem
The problem of accountability in the SE model is both theo-
retical and practical. From the theoretical standpoint, the
concept underlies the models for governance of a firm.
From a practical standpoint, as concerns for environmental
and social sustainability increases, improved accountability
to the public gains practical relevance. The objective of this
study and its research question is to provide an overview or
scoping of the type, extent, and quantity of research avail-
able in the current accountability literature related to SE.
This scoping review will examine the academic literature
as it relates to accountability and SE and tease out themes
and common ideas. As part of the scoping study methodol-
ogy, there will not be an exclusive focus on entrepreneur-
ship or entrepreneurs but instead the scoping survey will
review articles exploring the SE concept. Exploration of
this kind may help to surface gaps in the literature that
would need addressing and where no gaps are clearly iden-
tified, common trends can be described (Arksey &
O'Malley, 2005).
Methodology
The scoping review is a type of literature review but with
certain important distinctions. Systematically, the scoping
review looks at the literature from a relevance viewpoint
rather than by evaluating the quality of the research. This
addresses the exploratory nature of a scoping review. Then
the data are mapped or charted to identify key themes, and
potential gaps in the literature. Finally, a consultation process
with subject matter or contextual experts can be optionally
used to validate the findings (Arksey & O'Malley, 2005).
Arksey and O'Malley (2005) specify five stages to the scop-
ing review. These stages will be integrated throughout this
article: "identifying the research question" (p. 23), "study
selection" (p. 25), "charting the data" (p. 26), collating and
reporting on the results (p. 27). There is a final and optional
step of consulting a subject matter expert that may be used if
the remaining themes and issues do not identify a gap in the
literature (p. 28).
Burga and Rezania 3
We started the scoping review with a literature search
which was conducted to identify peer-reviewed, English lan-
guage, academic literature that was relevant to this article's
question. Boolean search expressions, as shown in Figure 1,
were used to narrow the search results.
The initial search used terms that were used to represent
SE with the "AND" Boolean operator to capture all of the
available literature within the searched databases. Using the
term "accountability" focused on articles that were more
concerned on accountability rather than accounting-related
papers. From the initial results, a different Boolean operator
was used to ensure that both terms were within 10 words of
each other. In the ABI-INFORM database search, we used
"NEAR/10" and in the EBSCO database search we used
"N10." We stayed with the search results from the WEB OF
SCIENCE search. Focusing on the full text forABI-INFORM
and the full text for EBSCO, and using the WEB OF
SCIENCE search engines ensured that papers focused on
both issues of accountability and SE could be selected.
Subsequently the papers were reviewed for duplication
and for papers that considered accountability rather than sim-
ply mentioned it. The main research questions of the relevant
articles were paraphrased or extracted. Their research
methodology and the way that "accountability" was used
within the paper were listed. Similarities and themes from
the theoretical viewpoint were teased out and reviewed.
Accountability articles were grouped according to the
three principal themes that were described in the introduc-
tion: accountability relationships in SE (Romzek & Ingraham,
2000), accountability as dependent variables or outcomes in
SE (Brandsma & Schillemans, 2013), and accountability as
independent variables or predictor elements in SE (Koppell,
2005). The themes as listed in Table 1 were determined from
reading the articles. The research methodology defined by
the content of the articles is listed in the second major col-
umn of Table 1 summarized from the detailed listings in the
appendix.
Results
The results described in Table 1 show three main account-
ability groupings and the methodology used by the research-
ers. Research questions were listed and whether the articles
referred to non-profit/not-for-profit or for-profit firms was
reviewed and listed in the appendix. As suggested by scop-
ing review methodology, the articles were not analyzed in

depth aside from their initial categorizations (Arksey &
O'Malley, 2005).
Our first observation is that there are almost an equal
number of articles for each accountability theme, indicating
a variety of opinions of how accountability is considered.
This is in line with general accountability literature where
accountability is modeled as predictors, outcomes, or as the
relationship between parties.
Our second observation is that the research methodology
utilized in this field is primarily based around qualitative
methodology with one article using quantitative methodol-
ogy and the remaining articles of a conceptual nature. Most
of the articles used case study methodology to describe or
explore issues related to accountability. This type of qualita-
tive methodology is expected around emerging issues and
theories (Yin, 1981) and where "descriptive inferences" with
incomplete data need to be made (Gerring, 2004). Given that
several of the reviewed papers have focused on accountabil-
ity as dependent variables or independent variables (out-
comes or predictors), one would expect more quantitative
studies of accountability in SE.
Another observation is that most of the research is based
in the United States, Europe, and Australia with one article's
research originating in Jamaica and another in India. The
accountability context is primarily oriented around social
and administrative categories rather than political or legal
categories (Bovens, 2007). This makes logical sense as this
literature deals with the scope of SE activities that tend to be
related to small firms involved in social activities (Battilana
et al., 2012).
In the next stage, an iterative process as described in scop-
ing review methodology (Arksey & O'Malley, 2005) was
applied to the research results to view the results through the
lens of different management theories. The results shown in
Table 2 indicate the main management theories discussed in
the articles as detailed in the appendix. The earliest published
articles were from 2001 and 2002 which indicates a young
research area. Based on Table 2, certain theoretical areas are
represented more frequently: stakeholder theory, social capi-
tal theory, entrepreneurial theory, ethical responsibility the-
ory, critical theory, and economic responsibility theory.
Mainstream theories such as agency theory, stewardship
theory, and institutional theory have previously been advanced
as important theories to consider in the consideration of
accountability (Mansouri & Rowney, 2014). Interestingly,
neither stewardship theory nor agency theory were mentioned
in any of the 27 articles. This could indicate the potential for
additional research on accountability in SE using other theo-
retical perspectives.
Discussion
The objective of this study was to provide an overview of
the type, extent, and quantity of research available on cur-
rent accountability literature related to SE through a rapid
gathering of literature and a mapping of the results. Arksey
and O'Malley (2005) identify this technique as one that
identifies research gaps without necessarily commenting
on the quality of the extant research. Davis, Drey, and
Gould (2009) suggest that the limits of the technique be
clearly specified to improve the usefulness and applicabil-
ity of the results. In the following discussion, the results
will be analyzed and the limitations of the analysis will be
presented.
This scoping review looked at accountability in social
entrepreneurial settings and determined that this field of
study has not been extensively researched. Of the 890 peer-
reviewed articles dealing with accountability and some ver-
sion of SE terminology, only 27 relevant articles were found
from a search of the EBSCO, Proquest ABI-INFORM, and
WEB OF SCIENCE databases that integrated both concepts.
Our search methodology could have missed papers that did
not describe accountability and SE within the number of
words and with the terminology for SE that were defined in
our search algorithm.
Our search methodology also included a manual revision
of the 65 articles that were generated prior to narrowing the
relevant articles to 27 (shown in Figure 1). During this revi-
sion, we were subjective in our interpretation of both the
context of SE and how accountability was described within
this context. As a limitation of this review, it is possible that
we may have excluded some of the articles because of their
marginal inclusion of accountability or marginal context of
SE according to our interpretation of the concepts.

We found that there are gaps relating to the inclusion of
theories that are described in the accountability literature
resulting from our search. In particular, we could not find
discussions of agency theory or stewardship theory. Agency
theory has been described as driving accountability relation-
ships (Bovens, 2007; Brandsma & Schillemans, 2013).
Stewardship theory, institutional theory, and agency theory
are also described within the context of accountability
(Mansouri & Rowney, 2014). From the results of the scoping
survey, accountability in a SE setting may derive more of its
work from theories related to social dimensions such as
stakeholder theory, social capital theory, and ethical respon-
sibility theory among the others shown in Table 2.
This scoping review reveals that the literature on account-
ability of SE is still scarce. Dees (1998) in describing one of
the five main roles of a SE firm discussed that they should be
"exhibiting a heightened sense of accountability to the con-
stituencies served and for the outcomes created" (Dees,
1998, p. 4). The different ways of defining accountability
within the SE context shows that researchers are examining
various facets of this variable using qualitative and concep-
tual articles. Accountability can be viewed as a predictor, as
an outcome, or as the context or relationships in which SE
operates.
We found that the articles selected did not specifically
focus on defining accountability except for the article by
Achleitner, Lutz, Mayer, and Spiess-Knafl (2013) who
defined "voluntary accountability" (p. 105). We found that
the other articles focused on the application of accountability
practices in the SE context rather than focus on the concep-
tual definition of accountability.
Academic researchers continue to debate accountability
in SE. There are ample opportunities to continue researching
this area and contribute further to SE literature. We highlight
some of the potential research areas.
Further research is needed to examine accountability in
relation to the governance of the SE. Like any other corpora-
tions, social entrepreneurial firms need to be transparent in
all aspects of their governance. They need to demonstrate
accountability to their shareholders, as well as to stakehold-
ers within and outside the firm. They need to deal with issues
such as conflicting expectations and multiple accountabili-
ties through proper governance structures. Good governance
requires proper provision of information, proper debate of
issues, and proper decision-making structures and processes.
Even though governance of firms have been the subject of
several studies, the specific characteristics of SE in relation
to multiple expectation and accountabilities justify further
studies of governance in the context of SE.
From the firm's perspective, it is important to understand
how accountability issues are raised, challenged, and resolved.
When is accountability a predictor, an outcome, or a nexus of
relationships? Further studies of how accountability is enacted
in the context of SE are necessary to help practitioners design
and implement proper governance structures.
From the social perspective, accountability in the context
of SE implies multiple accountability scenarios. We expect
that these relationships may be fluid in the context of a
dynamic SE model and that they will impact the SE firm.
What theory can be used to model multiple accountability
scenarios and how can this be empirically described and
measured?
From the critical perspective, accountability and SE can be
researched from the viewpoint of whether SE should even be
considered a business model as it is mostly assumed in the
current literature search. Some critical perspectives discuss

SE as extending beyond the business model (Hjorth, 2013)
and as "a zero-sum game" (Teasdale, 2012, p. 515).
Accountability in this critical context could be explored using
institutional theory or stakeholder theory to account for their
multiple accountability relationships.
The extant literature utilizes many organizational theories to
explain that behavior results from control mechanisms, includ-
ing accountability, whether formal or informal. Behavior takes
place in a social context and is influenced by mutual excep-
tions, norms, and mutual patterns of behavior. More research is
needed to understand the relationship between accountability
and decision-making, how accountability guides behavior of a
social entrepreneur, and what processes are implemented
within a SE to enable accountability.
Conclusion
The purpose of this scoping review was to identify gaps with-
out doing an exhaustive review of the literature. One of the
gaps identified related to a lack of homogeneity in the theo-
ries used. The other main gap that was identified related to a
lack of empirical and more specifically quantitative research
on accountability in the social entrepreneurial sector.
Through this scoping review, we also identified mul-
tiple definitions of accountability in the context of SE.
The lack of agreement in defining accountability as a
theoretical construct and the lack of homogeneity in its
operationalization in the research papers that were identi-
fied show both an opportunity and a challenge. The
opportunity is to identify the specific SE context where
accountability is most important. The challenge lies in
that accountability as a construct may require anchoring
to a particular theory to be able to define its relationship
in the SE context.
SE continues to be a vibrant field and mapping account-
ability within this field is unexplored. This scoping study
provides a launching pad for further conceptual and empiri-
cal research of accountability within SE.

Mason (2014)
"There are increasing calls for more diverse (and qualitative)
empirical studies of many aspects of social enterprise,
and this naturally supports innovations in conceptual
developments (Low, 2006; Spear et al., 2009). This paper
works towards the second goal, presenting the findings
from a small study of social enterprise governance in the
UK." (p. 181)

corporate governance
Nicholls (2010) "The research uses these approaches to examine the
disclosure and reporting mechanisms designed for CICs
in terms of the `regulatory space' (Hancher & Moran,
1989) within which a range of key actors and discourses
interacted to institutionalize the new legal form's reporting
and disclosure practices. Of particular significance here are
the boundary factors that determine the regulatory context
within which disclosure logics are negotiated and practices
subsequently established" (p. 395)

Partzsch and
Ziegler (2011)
"Here, we examine the role and potential of one such agent--
the social entrepreneur--and we focus on one important
sector for sustainable development--the water sector. In
what sense are social entrepreneurs change agents in the
water sector? What, if anything, gives these agents authority
to pursue these social and environmental goals? . . . If
social entrepreneurs are change agents, what might be the
legitimating reasons that transform power into authority?"
