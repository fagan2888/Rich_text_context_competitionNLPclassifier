ABSTRACT
Background: Nonmedical opioid use has become a major public health concern due to increases in
treatment admissions, overdoses, and deaths. Use has also been linked to heroin initiation.
Reliable data on nonmedical opioid use are needed to continue to inform prevention. Objective:
To determine the prevalence and correlates of discordant self-report of nonmedical use of opioids
in a national sample. Methods: Utilizing a nationally representative sample of 31,149 American
high school seniors in the Monitoring the Future study (2009­2013), discordant responses
between self-reported 12-month nonmedical opioid use and self-reported 12-month nonmedical
Vicodin and OxyContin use (reporting Vicodin/OxyContin use, but not reporting "opioid" use)
were assessed. We also used multivariable logistic regression to determine the characteristics of
students who were most likely to provide a discordant response. Results: 37.1% of those reporting
nonmedical Vicodin use and 28.2% of those reporting nonmedical OxyContin use did not report
overall nonmedical opioid use. Prevalence of nonmedical opioid use (8.3%) would increase when
factoring in Vicodin, OxyContin, or both, by 2.8%, 1.3%, and 3.3%, respectively. Females were
more likely to provide a discordant response to Vicodin and highly religious students were more
likely to provide a discordant response regarding OxyContin use. Those who reported cocaine or
nonmedical tranquilizer use were at consistently low odds for discordant responses. Nonmedical
amphetamine users were at low odds for providing a discordant Vicodin response. Conclusion:
Prevalence of nonmedical opioid use may be underreported on some surveys, particularly among
specific subpopulations. Further research on the effect of question order and skip-patterns (e.g.,
"gate" questions) is needed. Reliable data on nonmedical opioid use are needed to continue to
accurately inform prevention.

Introduction
Nonmedical use of prescription opioids (a.k.a.: narco-
tics, analgesics, pain-killers) among adolescents in the
United States (US) is high, with 9.5% of high school
seniors reporting lifetime use in 2014 (1). Everyday, an
estimated 1,300 adolescents initiated nonmedical
opioid use for the first time in 2014, with an average
age of initiation of 21.6 years (2). The US experienced a
183% increase in emergency department visits related
to nonmedical opioid use between 2004 and 2011 (3),
an 8% increase in opioid related admissions to sub-
stance abuse treatment centers between 2002 and 2012
(4), and increases in opioid-related overdose deaths
between 1999 and 2011 (5). According to the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), opioids are
associated with nearly 75% of prescription medication
overdoses in the US (6). In addition, frequent
nonmedical opioid use is associated with increased
risk for heroin initiation (7).
Among prescription opioids commonly used in a
nonmedical manner, Vicodin (hydrocodone plus acet-
aminophen) and OxyContin (oxycodone) are of parti-
cular concern, considering the high frequency with
which they are prescribed and used. According to the
National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH),
Vicodin appears to be the most prevalent opioid used
in a nonmedical manner in the US, used by an esti-
mated 14.2% of adults aged 18­25 in 2013 (8). While
nonmedical OxyContin use is less prevalent (used by an
estimated 5.4% of adults aged 18­25) in the US com-
pared to Vicodin and other opioid formulations such as
Percoset (8), nonmedical OxyContin use is particularly
prevalent among opioid dependent individuals (9­11).
OxyContin is known for its high potency (12,13)
although its abuse appears to have been somewhat

curtailed since introduction of abuse-deterrent formu-
lations in 2010 (14). Data collected from Monitoring
the Future (MTF), a nationally representative survey of
high school seniors in the US, asks students about
nonmedical use of Vicodin and OxyContin within the
last 12 months, and in 2014, 4.8% of students reported
Vicodin use and 3.3% of students reported nonmedical
OxyContin use (1).
Many drug surveys ask respondents about nonme-
dical use of opioids as a general class of drugs (often
including examples of drugs in that category).
However, few surveys ask specifically about types (or
brands) of opioids used. Considering the popularity
and potential dangers associated with use of specific
prescription opioids such as Vicodin and OxyContin,
it is essential to assess the accuracy of reporting non-
medical opioid use generally as compared to reporting
use of specific types of opioid drugs. The self-report of
illicit drug use compared to urinalysis typically pro-
duces good validity findings (15­19); however, specific
prescription opioids used in a nonmedical manner
(e.g., Vicodin, OxyContin) may be viewed differently
by users as they are commonly prescribed (e.g., gov-
ernment approved, pharmaceutical grade pills) and
thus different from other "street" drugs.
Furthermore, underreporting of nonmedical opioid
use has been found to be common in some popula-
tions (e.g., among pregnant women, those who are
dependent, veterans, adolescents) (20­25), but under-
reporting may also be due, in part, to confusion
regarding which drugs are opioids, or in regard to
medical versus nonmedical/recreational use. A study
assessing validity of using a self-report questionnaire
compared to self-report via identification of specific
opioids from color photographs found that validity
was higher for OxyContin, but lower for generic
extended-release oxycodone ( = 0.62 and 0.46,
respectively) when compared to some other opioids,
such as methadone wafers/disks, methadone tablets, or
Dilaudid (9), suggesting that reporting of the use of
individual types of opioids may not always be reliable.
Of concern is that most data on validity of drug use
self-report have been conducted in groups of indivi-
duals in drug treatment programs, rather than in gen-
eral population samples. A study on the validity of drug
use self-reports in MTF found that lifetime use of most
illicit drugs remained consistent in the sample even
after re-query of respondents on seven different occa-
sions, indicating validity of drug use self-report (26).
However, consistency in responses was lower for psy-
chotherapeutic (prescription) drugs, although this
study did not specifically examine validity for opioid
use (26). The authors suggest that discordance of
reporting of psychotherapeutic drugs may be due to
ambiguity in drug definitions (e.g., a student may
have difficulty categorizing Xanax as a benzodiazepine).
A major limitation of paper and pencil surveys such as
MTF (27) is that complex branching of questions (or
"skip patterns") are often too difficult to utilize as they
may confuse the participant (28), and thus all students
are asked every question, regardless of previous
responses to the use of specific types of drugs.
In this analysis, we seek to describe differences in
self-reporting of nonmedical opioid use among high
school seniors assessed in the annual MTF survey,
who were asked about both general nonmedical opioid
use and also specifically about nonmedical Vicodin and
OxyContin use. We examine and compare prevalence
of self-reported nonmedical opioid use overall with
prevalence of self-reported nonmedical use of Vicodin
and OxyContin--questions that are asked of all stu-
dents regardless of responses to the general nonmedical
opioid use questions. As nonmedical opioid use has
become a major public health issue in the US, results
will help determine whether students may be under- or
over-reporting use of specific opioids, potentially due to
confusion regarding definitions.
Methods
Procedure
MTF is a nationally representative cross-sectional study
of high school students in the US. About 15,000 12th
graders (high school seniors) are surveyed every year
from approximately 130 public and private schools
throughout the 48 coterminous states. A multi-stage
random sampling procedure is utilized: geographic
areas are first selected, then schools within areas are
selected, and then classes within schools are selected.
Since two of the main variables of interest (nonmedical
Vicodin and OxyContin use; discussed below) were
only assessed in half of the sample (via three out of
six survey forms), in order to have adequate power, this
analysis focused on aggregated data collected from the
five most recent cohorts with available data (2009­
2013). MTF protocols were approved by the
University of Michigan Institutional Review Board
(IRB) and the authors' IRB deemed this secondary
data analysis exempt from review.
Drug use
Before students were asked about last-year (12-month)
nonmedical use of opioids, the survey explained that,
"There are a number of narcotics other than heroin,
2 J. J. PALAMAR ET AL.
such as methadone, opium, morphine, codeine, Demerol,
Vicodin, OxyContin, and Percocet. These are sometimes
prescribed by doctors." They were then asked, "On how
many occasions (if any) have you taken narcotics other
than heroin on your own--that is, without a doctor tell-
ing you to take them--during the last 12 months?"
Answer options were used on 1) 0 occasions, 2) 1­2
occasions, 3) 3­5 occasions, 4) 6­9 occasions, 5) 10­19
occasions, 6) 20­39 occasions, and 7) 40 or more occa-
sions. Later on in the survey, students were asked addi-
tional questions about 12-month nonmedical Vicodin
and OxyContin use, and all students were asked, regard-
less of their response to the first opioid item. Specifically,
students were asked, "During the last 12 months, on how
many occasions (if any) have you taken Vicodin (without
a doctor's orders)?" and in a separate question they were
given the same item, but with regard to "OxyContin
(without a doctor's orders)." We dichotomized each of
the three items into 12-month use: yes/no, and created
variables indicating whether there was discordance in
reporting (e.g., a discordance by which they reported
Vicodin use, but not opioids). We could not examine
lifetime use as MTF did not ask about lifetime Vicodin or
OxyContin use. However, we did consider lifetime use of
other drugs assessed as covariates: alcohol, marijuana
(cannabis), cocaine, and nonmedical use of amphetamine
and tranquilizers.
Sociodemographic variables
Students were asked their sex, age (predefined by
MTF as <18, 18 years), and race/ethnicity (i.e.,
black, white, Hispanic). Level of religiosity was
assessed via two ordinal items which asked about
the level of religious attendance and importance. A
composite was computed and divided into tertiles to
indicate low (1.0­2.0), moderate (2.5­3.0), and high
(3.5­4.0) religiosity. Students were also asked how
many nights they typically go out per week for fun
and we coded answers into 1) 0­1, 2) 2­3, and 3)
4­7. Coding and justification of the entry of variables
were based on previous MTF analyses as these cov-
ariates are commonly related to the use of various
drugs--including nonmedical opioid use (7,29­31).
Thus, we examined common correlates from MTF
that may allow us to delineate discordant responses
and we hypothesized that those at higher risk for
other drug use would be less likely to provide a
discordant response due to possible experience, expo-
sure, or knowledge of drugs.
Analyses
Analyses focused on students with complete opioid use
data (weighted N = 31,149). We first examined descrip-
tive statistics for all variables. Next, we produced cross-
tabulations to examine self-reported nonmedical use of
Vicodin and OxyContin by self-reported nonmedical
use of opioids as a general category. Among students
reporting nonmedical use of Vicodin/OxyContin, we
computed the prevalence of not reporting nonmedical
use of opioids in general, overall and by each covariate
aforementioned. Logistic regression models were also
used to generate unadjusted odds ratios (ORs) and
adjusted ORs (AORs) for each covariate to determine
which students were most likely to report discordant
responses (e.g., reported Vicodin use but not opioid use
as the outcome variable as per the variable indicating
whether or not the response was discordant). For unad-
justed (bivariable) analyses, we implemented a
Bonferroni statistical correction to account for multiple
testing ( = 0.05/10 = 0.005). All analyses were design-
based for survey data (32) and sample weights were
included in all analyses. SAS 9.3 software (SAS
Institute, 2011) was used for all analyses.
Results
Sample characteristics and self-reported drug use are
presented in Table 1. With regard to recent (12-month)
nonmedical opioid use, 8.3% reported any use; 7.6%
reported nonmedical Vicodin use and 4.4% reported
nonmedical OxyContin use. Most students who did not
report nonmedical use of opioids also did not report
nonmedical use of Vicodin (96.9%) and OxyContin
(98.6%). As shown in Table 2, among those reporting
nonmedical Vicodin use, 37.1% did not report nonme-
dical use of opioids in general and among those report-
ing nonmedical use of OxyContin, 28.2% did not report
nonmedical opioid use in general (relative percentages).
With regard to absolute percentages, the estimated
prevalence of nonmedical opioid use if we include dis-
cordant reports of Vicodin use would increase from
8.3% to 11.1% (95% CI: 10.7, 11.5; 8.3% + 2.8% [abso-
lute difference when including Vicodin]). Including
OxyContin would increase the estimate from 8.3% to
9.6% (95% CI: 9.2, 9.9; 8.3% + 1.3% [absolute difference
when including OxyContin]). Including discordant
responses to both Vicodin and OxyContin would
increase the estimated prevalence from 8.3% to 11.6%
(95% CI: 11.2, 12.0; 8.3% + 3.3% [absolute difference
when including Vicodin and OxyContin]).

We then examined whether demographic characteris-
tics and drug use were related to reporting nonmedical
use of Vicodin or OxyContin, but not reporting general
nonmedical opioid use (discordant reporting). As shown
in Table 3, females were more likely to report a discor-
dance regarding Vicodin (AOR = 1.34, p = 0.013).
Compared to white students, black and Hispanic students
were at high odds for reporting Vicodin use without
controlling for other covariates, but these associations
were no longer significant upon controlling for all other
covariates. Likewise, religious students were more likely
to report the use of Vicodin, but not general opioid use,
but significance was lost when controlling for all other
covariates. Students who said they go out for fun 4­7
nights per week (compared to those who said they go
out 0­1 nights per week for fun) were at reduced odds for
reporting use of Vicodin, but not general opioid use, but
this, too, lost significance when controlling for all other
covariates. Alcohol and marijuana use were associated
with decreased odds of reporting this discordance and
significance was lost when controlling for all other cov-
ariates; however, cocaine use, and nonmedical use of
amphetamine and tranquilizers were all consistently and
robustly associated with decreased odds of reporting this
discordance with regard to Vicodin.
With regard to students reporting OxyContin use, but
not use of opioids (Table 4), compared to white students,
black and Hispanic students were at increased odds for
reporting the OxyContin discordance, but the signifi-
cance disappeared when controlling for all other vari-
ables. Moderate religiosity and high religiosity were
associated with high odds for reporting this discordance
although the strength of associations weakened when
controlling for all other covariates. Going out 4­7 nights
per week for fun was also significant until controlling for
all other variables. Alcohol use and nonmedical amphe-
tamine use were associated with decreased odds for use
until controlling for all other covariates. Marijuana use,
cocaine use, and nonmedical tranquilizer use were con-
sistently and robustly associated with decreased odds of
reporting this discordance.
Discussion
Since nonmedical opioid users in the US take specific
drugs such as Vicodin or OxyContin, it is essential that
survey-takers and tools designed to assess the prevalence
of opioid use do not misclassify use of specific drugs with
regard to this drug category. Accurate prevalence of use is
needed to inform prevention, as underestimation of pre-
valence may lead to less public health concern. In this
analysis of data from MTF, a nationally representative
sample of American high school seniors, we found that
8.3% of high school seniors reported nonmedical use of

opioids within the last 12 months, with 7.6% reporting
Vicodin use and 4.4% reporting OxyContin use within
the same time period. Relative percentages of students
who reported nonmedical use of Vicodin or OxyContin
but did not report nonmedical use of opioids (as a general
category) were high­37.1% and 28.2%, respectively. Thus,
about a third of students who reported nonmedical use of
Vicodin or OxyContin reported no nonmedical opioid
use. This suggests that the prevalence of self-reported
nonmedical opioid use (as a general drug category) is
being underestimated (by up to 3.3%). Our analyses of
the characteristics of students who provided discordant
responses may give some insights into why these indivi-
duals reported nonmedical use of specific opioids, but not
of nonmedical use of opioids in general.
Black and Hispanic students were both more likely
to provide discordant responses than white students in
bivariable models, but not in multivariable models.
This adds to earlier findings by Johnston and
O'Malley (26), who found racial and ethnic minorities,
and in particular African­American students, were
more likely to provide discordant reports of drug use
in an MTF validation study. Similarly, a reliability study
of the NSDUH found that white individuals were more
likely to consistently report substance use (33). In gen-
eral, whites reportedly use opioids nonmedically more
frequently than other racial/ethnic subgroups (34),
whites are more likely to be prescribed opioid drugs
for pain than other racial/ethnic groups (35), and they
are also more likely to "doctor shop" for pills (36).
Thus, white students may in fact be more familiar
with and/or knowledgeable about specific types of
opioid drugs such as Vicodin and OxyContin, and
therefore less likely to provide discordant responses.
However, we found that confounding factors such as
other drug use appear to weaken such significant
associations.
Religiosity was also associated with increased odds of
discordant reporting. Religiosity has previously been
shown to be associated with decreased risk of drug
use (37,38) and decreased approval of drug use (39),
as well as increased disapproval and stigma toward
drug users (40,41). It may be that individuals who are
both highly religious and have used are thus less likely
to accurately self-report drug use due to fear of disap-
proval, or perhaps they are more likely to lack the
knowledge that these controlled pills can in fact be

drugs of abuse when used outside of prescribed
purposes.
Reporting lifetime use of alcohol and some other
illicit drugs examined were associated with decreased
odds of discordance between reporting nonmedical
Vicodin or OxyContin use and general nonmedical
opioid use--although some associations diminished
when controlling for all other covariates. We hypothesize
two pathways to explain this finding: 1) individuals who
use licit and illicit drugs may perceive less social disap-
proval of drug use, and therefore be less subject to
reporting bias; and moreover, 2) individuals who use
licit and/or illicit drugs may be more knowledgeable
about drugs and drug classes and therefore less subject
to information bias. Previous studies have shown indi-
viduals who use drugs perceive less disapproval in regard
to use of that drug (40,42), and toward use of other
"hard" drugs (39), and therefore these individuals may
be likely to self-report drug use more accurately because
of less perception of disapproval. Furthermore, indivi-
duals who report use of other licit and illicit drugs may
be more knowledgeable about drugs (43,44), and there-
fore be less likely to report discordance due to
information bias. In addition, self-reported use of other
psychoactive drugs which are legal when used as pre-
scribed--amphetamine (e.g., Adderall) and tranquilizers
(e.g., Xanax, Valium)--were consistent and robust pre-
dictors of not providing a discordant response. It may be
that students who use amphetamines and/or tranquili-
zers in a nonmedical manner are more familiar with
and/or knowledgeable about pills they use in other cate-
gories such as opioids.
Another factor previously shown to be associated
with discordant drug use reporting is the initiation of
opioid use for pain management (21). Individuals who
started using opioids to treat pain may be more familiar
with drug names, and may be more likely to report the
use of specific drugs, while not reporting the use of
opioids generally; however, research is needed to con-
firm this. One study found that over a third (36.9%) of
adolescents access opioids through their own leftover
prescriptions, and these individuals primarily use such
drugs to reduce physical pain (45). While many ado-
lescents are familiar with opioid use via their own
prescriptions, a substantial percentage of the adolescent
population may be underreporting opioid use.

Although many surveys today are electronic and ask
follow-up questions via skip-patterns and piping meth-
odology, results from MTF (which is administered via
paper and pencil) provided us with a unique opportunity
to examine concordant versus discordant responses.
While discordant responses are in fact problematic, elec-
tronic surveys generally do not allow discordant
responses. For example, respondents may be asked a
"gate" question about nonmedical use of specific opioids.
If the individual responds that no opioid was used in a
nonmedical manner, then they are taken to questions
about a different drug, with no opportunity to later
provide a discordant (but accurate) response. Likewise,
if a respondent accidentally checks off "no" to a group of
drugs earlier on (even though all drugs of interest were
listed), the opportunity is then lost for further questions
related to those listed drugs. NSDUH (8) respondents
are asked "gate" questions about nonmedical use of
specific opioids; however, they are also shown a card
depicting photographs of different opioid pills and lists
of opioid names to help them identify opioids they have
used nonmedically. The card depicts and/or lists 21
different opioids including Vicodin, Percoset, and
OxyContin. However, few electronic surveys depict
photographs of specific drugs. While branching, piping,
and skip patterns are beneficial with regard to electronic
surveys, research is needed to determine whether such
technology may lead to underreporting.
Limitations
MTF was not able to assess those who dropped out of high
school and this can affect the generalizability of findings.
Public MTF data are cross-sectional, so we were unable to
examine patterns of self-report over time. While MTF asks
about lifetime, 12-month and 30-day nonmedical use of
opioids, it only asks about 12-month nonmedical use of
Vicodin and OxyContin, so analyses had to be limited to
last-year use. MTF also only asks about Vicodin and
OxyContin via three (of six) survey forms, so we could
only examine data for half of the national sample. We also
had no way to determine whether discordant self-reported
use of Vicodin or OxyContin was due to reporting errors.
While adding more specific questions to a survey may
likely result in better data, surveys were not complemented
with interviews or biological testing.
Missing data were also an issue. Of those with miss-
ing data for the overall nonmedical opioid use variable
(4.3%, n = 1,539), 32.2% (n = 496) had Vicodin data
(1.6% of those with opioid data) that had to be omitted
from analyses. Of those with missing data for the over-
all nonmedical opioid use variable, 32.8% (n = 505) had
OxyContin data (1.6% of those with opioid data).
While percentages of missing data were relatively
small, we discovered a systematic difference in preva-
lence when comparing the prevalence of Vicodin and
OxyContin use according to who also had general
nonmedical opioid use data (the analytic sample) and
who did not have data for all three opioid variables
(excluded from analyses). Specifically, those excluded
due to missing opioid data reported significantly higher
prevalence (p < 0.001) of Vicodin (15.9%, 95% CI: 12.5,
19.3) and OxyContin (12.3%, 95% CI: 9.2, 15.4) use.
Therefore, an important bias appears to have been dis-
covered in which many students who reported the use of
Vicodin or OxyContin were likely to skip the earlier
question about overall nonmedical opioid use. We also
found significantly different levels of missingness for
Vicodin and OxyContin across survey forms (p <
0.001) (but not general nonmedical opioid use); how-
ever, patterns of missingness are similar (across forms)
for self-reported 12-month use of other drugs assessed
by MTF along with Vicodin and OxyContin: cough
medicines, synthetic cannabinoids, ketamine, andro,
creatine, Ritalin, and Adderall (all ps < 0.001).
Conclusions
In this analysis of a nationally representative sample of
American high school seniors, we found discordance in
reporting of nonmedical opioid use by a specific type of
opioid (i.e., Vicodin, OxyContin) and general nonmedi-
cal use of opioids. These findings suggest that the overall
estimates of opioid use may be underestimated in some
studies, and future tests of validity may be required to
ensure that respondents recognize and provide appro-
priate responses for use of the drugs assessed.
