Women With Histories of Gestational
Diabetes but Without Current Diabetes

OBJECTIVE: To compare the cardiovascular disease risk
factor profiles of parous women with a history of gesta-
tional diabetes who had not developed diabetes, parous
women with diagnosed diabetes, and parous women
with neither condition.
METHODS: We conducted cross-sectional analyses of
4,631 parous women who were not currently pregnant in
the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey (1988­1994). Women were classified by self-
report as having a history of gestational diabetes who
were not currently diabetic (n85), diagnosed diabetics
(n218), or as having neither condition (n4,328). We
compared these groups with respect to cholesterol sub-
types, blood pressure, uric acid, microalbuminuria, insu-
lin, glucose, and clustering of risk factors, before and after
adjustment for demographic and behavioral factors and
central obesity.
RESULTS: In unadjusted comparisons, women who had a
history of gestational diabetes who were not currently
diabetics had a more favorable or similar risk factor
profile compared with unaffected women, with two
exceptions: greater levels of mean fasting glucose (94.0
mg/dL compared with 106.8 mg/dL, P<.001) and mean
fasting insulin (10.2 international units/L compared with
14.0 international units/L, P<.001). These patterns were
attenuated after adjustment for demographic factors and
waist circumference, but remained significant for fasting
glucose and the ratio of urine microalbumin/creatinine.
Parous women with diagnosed diabetes had significantly
worse cardiovascular disease risk profiles than unaffected
women before and after adjustment.
CONCLUSION: Women who had a history of gestational
diabetes who were not currently diabetics have a similar
cardiovascular disease risk profile to unaffected women,
with the exception of insulin and glucose levels.

LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: II
Gestational diabetes is defined as glucose intoler-
ance first identified during pregnancy.1 Although
this glucose intolerance resolves with delivery in
about 90% of cases,2 women with histories of gesta-
tional diabetes are at increased risk of developing
diabetes, the metabolic syndrome, and cardiovascular
disease.3­8 A previous study suggests that women with
histories of gestational diabetes have less favorable
cardiovascular risk factors compared with unaffected
women.8
The degree to which women with histories of
gestational diabetes are at risk for cardiovascular
disease, beyond their predisposition to future diabe-
tes, is unclear. Women with histories of gestational
diabetes may be at increased risk of cardiovascular
disease primarily through their development of dia-
betes, or alternatively may be at increased risk of
cardiovascular disease even if they have not devel-
oped diabetes. Using the National Health and Nutri-
tion Examination Survey III (NHANES III), a popu-
lation-based cross-sectional study, we examined levels
of cardiovascular risk factors and the number of risk
factors along with metabolic syndrome components.
We compared unaffected parous women, women
with histories of gestational diabetes who had not
been identified with diagnosed diabetes, and women

factor levels and clustering of risk factors would be
progressively elevated among unaffected women
compared with women with histories of gestational
diabetes and compared with women with diagnosed
diabetes. We also hypothesized that these associations
would be attenuated after adjustment for risk factors,
particularly for waist circumference.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The study population was a sample from the
NHANES III, which was conducted using a multi-
stage sampling design representative of the noninsti-
tutionalized civilian population in the United States
between 1988 and 1994. A detailed description of the
objectives and data collection procedures of the
NHANES III has been reported previously.9 Briefly,
each NHANES wave consists of a detailed standard-
ized medical examination in a mobile examination
unit and an interview to obtain information on socio-
demographic characteristics and cardiovascular risk
factors. Participants were selected at random for
fasting glucose testing. The selection process was as
follows: Each household was randomly assigned to
either a morning or an afternoon/evening examina-
tion session. Plasma glucose values were not obtained
for people who did not participate in the examination
(n811), were examined at home where fasting was
not required (n209), were examined in the after-
noon/evening (n311), had medical and safety rea-
sons for exclusion (n10), became faint or ill (n2),
refused the venipuncture (n28), had unsuccessful
venipuncture (n27), fasted for less than 9 hours
(n369) or less than 24 hours (n8) or had an
unknown fasting time (n89), and for other reasons
(n137). Plasma glucose values were obtained after
an overnight fast of 9 to less than 24 hours for 6,587
people (77%). There were no statistically significant
differences in a variety of sociodemographic and
clinical variables between subjects assigned to the
morning session compared with subjects assigned to
the afternoon/evening session. In addition, for those
in the morning session, there were no significant
differences between subjects for whom plasma glu-
cose values were obtained compared with those for
whom plasma glucose values were not obtained.
Thus, data from the subsamples are considered to
represent the entire NHANES III sample.10 For the
purposes of this report, we excluded women who
were nulliparous, pregnant at the time of data collec-
tion, or had missing data regarding pregnancy status
or previous diabetes or histories of gestational diabe-
tes diagnoses, for a total sample of 4,631 women. This
study was declared institutional review board exempt
by the University of Michigan institutional review
board.
Parous women were stratified based on their
health status at the time of the NHANES interview
and categorized hierarchically based on their risk
strata as having diabetes, histories of gestational dia-
betes, or neither condition. Women were asked 1)
Have you ever been told by a doctor that you have
diabetes or sugar diabetes? 2) Were you pregnant
when you were told you had diabetes? 3) Other than
pregnancy, has a doctor ever told you that you have
diabetes or sugar diabetes? Based on these questions,
women were classified as having diagnosed diabetes if
they reported a diagnosis of diabetes, either type 1
diabetes mellitus or type 2 diabetes mellitus, outside
of pregnancy (n4,328).11 Women were classified as
having histories of gestational diabetes without cur-
rent diabetes if they reported having a diagnosis of
diabetes made during pregnancy and no diagnosed
diabetes at interview (n85). Women were classified
as unaffected if they did not have histories of gesta-
tional diabetes or diagnosed diabetes (n218). Be-
cause we were focused on the risk factor profile of
women with histories of gestational diabetes who had
not yet developed diabetes, women who had diabetes
and histories of gestational diabetes (n29) were
classified as having diagnosed diabetes. In the
NHANES III, it is not possible to combine partici-
pants with diagnosed and undiagnosed diabetes for
risk analysis, because the denominator for the esti-
mate of undiagnosed diabetes is different from the
one for the estimate of diagnosed diabetes; undiag-
nosed diabetes was assessed in a subsample of nondi-
abetic persons who were randomly assigned to a
morning fasting examination, whereas diagnosed di-
abetes was assessed for the entire sample. Therefore,
for the purposes of this report, fasting glucose levels
were not used to identify women with diagnosed
diabetes.
Information on age, sex, race/ethnicity, family
history of diabetes, income, smoking, and alcohol
intake were collected by interview.9 Women were
classified as having a family history of diabetes if a
first-degree relative (biologic parents or siblings) had
diabetes. The poverty index was calculated using
self-reported family income and the poverty threshold
value produced annually by the U.S. Census Bu-
reau.12 Measurements of height, weight, and waist
circumference were performed in a standardized
manner, and body mass index (BMI) was calculated
as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters
squared. Leg length, a measure of early life socioeco-
876 Kim et al Risk Profile Among Women With Histories of GDM OBSTETRICS & GYNECOLOGY
nomic deprivation, was calculated by subtracting
sitting height from standing height.13,14 A history of
cardiovascular events was determined if women an-
swered "yes" to any of the following questions: 1) Has
a doctor ever told you that you had a heart attack? 2)
Has a doctor ever told you that you had a stroke? 3)
Has a doctor ever told you that you had congestive
heart failure?
We defined risk factors for cardiovascular disease
using the Adult Treatment Panel III guidelines.15
Cardiovascular risk factors included self-report of the
following risk factors: age older than 55 years; family
history of cardiovascular disease; current cigarette
smoking; and presence of diabetes, hypertension, or
dyslipidemia. Family history of cardiovascular disease
was defined as a first-degree male relative with car-
diovascular disease aged younger than 55 years or a
first-degree female relative with cardiovascular dis-
ease at younger than 65 years. Hypertension was
defined as a systolic blood pressure 140 mm Hg or
more or diastolic blood pressure 90 mm Hg or more
upon examination, or participant report of physician-
diagnosed hypertension on at least two occasions with
current use of antihypertensive medication. Dyslipi-
demia was defined as a total cholesterol 240 mg/dL or
more or participant report of physician-diagnosed
dyslipidemia that was currently treated with lifestyle
modification or medication.
Metabolic syndrome was defined as the presence
of three or more of any of the following components:
waist circumference 35 inches or more; systolic blood
pressure 130 mm Hg or more or diastolic blood
pressure 85 mm Hg or more; fasting blood glucose
110 mg/dL or more (6.1 mmol/L or more); serum
high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level (HDL) 50
mg/dL or more (1.29 mmol/L or more); and total
triglyceride level 150 mg/dL or more (1.69 mmol/L
or more).16 If participants used hypertensive medica-
tion or statin medication, they were classified as
having elevated blood pressure or dyslipidemia, re-
spectively. Newer criteria for metabolic syndrome use
the fasting blood glucose cutoff of 100 mg/dL, but we
used the older definition because this was the one in
use when the data were collected. Levels of low-
density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, triglycerides,
insulin, and glucose were estimated using the morn-
ing fasting sample of participants; insulin and glucose
were not measured on persons with diagnosed diabe-
tes who were on insulin therapy. Albuminuria is
expressed as milligrams per gram of creatinine: nor-
mal (less than 30 mg/g creatinine), microalbuminuria
(from 30 or more to 299 mg/g creatinine), and
macroalbuminuria (300 mg/g creatinine or more).17
All analyses accounted for the complex, multi-
stage, stratified, cluster-sampling design of NHANES
III by using sample weights, strata, and primary
sampling units provided by the survey designer as
part of the public data. First, we compared unaffected
women, women with histories of gestational diabetes,
and women with diagnosed diabetes across exposure
and outcome variables. For continuous variables, we
conducted tests of trend using the Fisher-Yates test,
and for categorical variables, we conducted 2 tests. In
multivariable models, we calculated predicted mar-
ginal probabilities and 95% confidence intervals for
levels of individual cardiovascular risk factors and
metabolic syndrome components.18
Multivariable models were constructed in several
stages. The first set of models (Model 1) adjusted for
age, race/ethnicity, family history of diabetes, ciga-
rette smoking, and alcohol intake. Next, we added
waist circumference, a measure of central obesity
(Model 2). The third set of models also adjusted for
self-reported cardiovascular disease (Model 3). The
next model also adjusted for leg length (Model 4). The
last model also adjusted for the poverty-index ratio as
a measure of current, rather than early-life, socioeco-
nomic deprivation (Model 5). Due to the fact that
both leg length and education are measures of early-
life deprivation,13,14 we used leg length rather than
education in the models.
We also constructed multivariable models for the
presence of metabolic syndrome (yes/no), defined as
the presence of three or more metabolic syndrome
components, as well as adjusted models for the pres-
ence of three or more cardiovascular risk factors.
Adjusted predicted marginal probabilities were esti-
mated from each model and used to calculate ad-
justed prevalence ratios for the histories of gestational
diabetes and diagnosed diabetes groups (referent
group, unaffected women). Due to the small number
of cardiovascular events, we did not examine actual
cardiovascular events as an outcome. The models
examining metabolic syndrome did not additionally
adjust for waist circumference, because these were
already included in the definition of metabolic syn-
drome. Statistical analyses were conducted using
SUDAAN 9.0 (SUDAAN, Research Triangle Insti-
tute, NC) software.
RESULTS
The characteristics of women in our sample are
illustrated in the first section of Table 1. Women with
diagnosed diabetes were significantly older than
women with histories of gestational diabetes or unaf-
fected women and were more likely to report African-

American or non-Hispanic African-American race/
ethnicity, family history of diabetes, the least
favorable poverty to income ratios, the fewest number
of alcoholic drinks per day, and the greatest waist
circumferences. Unaffected women tended to have
the longest leg length and women with histories of
gestational diabetes more often tended to be current
smokers, but these associations were not significant.
In unadjusted comparisons, women with diag-
nosed diabetes had worsened levels of cardiovascular
and metabolic syndrome factors than unaffected
women (Table 2). In comparison, differences between
women with histories of gestational diabetes and
unaffected women were less marked. Women with
histories of gestational diabetes actually had more
favorable cholesterol subtypes and blood pressure
levels than unaffected women. The exceptions were
fasting insulin and glucose levels. Fasting insulin and
glucose did increase across categories of glucose
intolerance (Table 2). When we examined the num-
ber of metabolic syndrome components or cardiovas-
cular risk factors, which dichotomized risk factor
levels, the number of components was greatest in
women with diagnosed diabetes, followed by women
with histories of gestational diabetes. Self-reported
cardiovascular was uncommon, reported in 6.7%
(n18) of women with diagnosed diabetes, 0.7%
(n2) of women with histories of gestational diabetes,
and 1.6% (n91) of unaffected women (P.048).
When we adjusted for patient covariates, the largest
differences were again seen between women with diag-
nosed diabetes and other groups (Table 3). After adjust-
ment for age, race/ethnicity, family history of diabetes,
cigarette smoking, and alcohol intake (Table 3, Model
1), women with diagnosed diabetes had similar risk
factor patterns compared with unadjusted analyses.
Women with diagnosed diabetes had poorer LDL,
HDL, total cholesterol, systolic blood pressure, insulin,
glucose, and microalbumin levels than unaffected
women. The exception to this pattern was that uric acid
levels, triglyceride levels, and diastolic blood pressure
levels no longer differed significantly. Women with
diagnosed diabetes were also more likely to have met-
abolic syndrome and to have three or more cardiovas-
cular risk factors than unaffected women. Women with
diagnosed diabetes also had poorer HDL and total
cholesterol, fasting glucose, and microalbuminuria than
women with histories of gestational diabetes.
After adjustment (Table 3, Model 1), women with
histories of gestational diabetes still tended to have
more favorable risk factor levels compared with un-
affected women, although these comparisons were
not significant. Women with histories of gestational
diabetes had a similar chance of having metabolic
syndrome and of having three or more cardiovascular
risk factors as unaffected women.
After additional adjustment for waist circumfer-
ence (Model 2), women with diagnosed diabetes no

longer differed in their HDL cholesterol levels or
systolic blood pressure levels from unaffected women,
but the greater presence of microalbuminuria and
elevated insulin, glucose, and total cholesterol per-
sisted. Women with diabetes were still more likely
than unaffected women to have three or more cardio-
vascular risk factors compared with unaffected
women. After additional adjustment for waist circum-
ference (Model 2), women with diagnosed diabetes
still had worsened microalbuminuria, insulin, glucose,
and total cholesterol compared with women with
histories of gestational diabetes. After adjustment for
waist circumference, women with histories of gesta-
tional diabetes were still more likely to have three or
more cardiovascular risk factors compared with unaf-
fected women. The addition of waist circumference to
demographic risk factors (Model 2) explained a sig-
nificantly greater proportion of variance than demo-
graphic factors alone (Model 1). When waist circum-
ference was not included as an adjuster, as was the
case when metabolic syndrome was the outcome, the R2
for multivariable models was much lower than the R2
for the cardiovascular models where the outcome was
also dichotomous.
Further adjustment for cardiovascular, leg length,
and poverty-index ratio did not change this pattern
for individual cardiovascular risk factors or for the
metabolic syndrome and number of cardiovascular
risk factors (results not shown). Of note, the additional
proportion of variance or the increase in R2 in Models
3, 4, and 5 tended to be slight compared with Models
1 and 2. In other words, models adjusting for demo-
graphic factors, behavioral factors, and waist circum-
ference explained similar variance to models that also
adjusted for cardiovascular, leg length, and poverty-
index ratio. This may be because the number of
cardiovascular events was low and only small differ-
ences in leg length were observed, and/or the effects
of these factors were mediated through others.
In sensitivity analyses, we substituted BMI for
waist circumference to determine if this increased the
explained variance of the model or otherwise
changed point estimates. We found that these BMI
models had slightly lower R2 than models with waist

circumference and did not have point estimates that
differed significantly from models using waist circum-
ference (results not shown). Therefore, we report
results with waist circumference. Relatively few
women had microalbuminuria levels that were more
than 30 micrograms/g, so in multivariable models,
the urine microalbuminuria/creatinine was dichoto-
mized as less than 30 micrograms/g compared with
more than 30 micrograms/g and the results expressed
in predicted marginal probabilities. We examined
whether using the newer cutoff of FPG100 mg/dL
affected the metabolic syndrome definition; propor-
tions were not significantly different (results not
shown). Finally, among women classified as having
histories of gestational diabetes, eight (9.4%) had
fasting glucose levels more than 126 mg/dL, and
among women classified as unaffected by either his-
tories of gestational diabetes or diagnosed diabetes, 50
(1.2%) had fasting glucose levels more than 126
mg/dL. In a sensitivity analysis, we examined only
women who had a fasting glucose as well as fasting
glucose levels less than 126 mg/dL (n1,900), but this
did not alter our pattern of effects, so the larger
sample is included in this report.
DISCUSSION
This cross-sectional study of the female population of
the United States suggests that women with histories
of gestational diabetes who have not developed diag-
nosed diabetes had similar levels of each metabolic
syndrome factor and each cardiovascular risk factor
compared with unaffected women, with the exception
of insulin and glucose levels. When factors were
dichotomized, women with histories of gestational
diabetes only had only a slightly greater number of
metabolic syndrome components and cardiovascular
risk factors than unaffected women. In contrast,
women with diagnosed diabetes had a significantly
worsened profile than other women.
In a cross-sectional analysis of the Genetics of
Non­Insulin-Dependent Diabetes Mellitus (GENNID)
study, Carr and colleagues8 found that women with
histories of gestational diabetes were more likely to
have metabolic syndrome and to experience cardio-
vascular events than women without histories of
gestational diabetes, and moreover, that these cardio-
vascular events occurred at a younger age. In their
study, the definitions of histories of gestational diabe-
tes and diagnosed diabetes were not mutually exclu-
sive, so that more than 90% of women with histories
of gestational diabetes had developed diabetes, and
63% of the women without histories of gestational
diabetes had developed diabetes. The high preva-
lence of diabetes was presumably due to the study
requirement that at least two first-degree relatives be
affected by diabetes. Other studies have documented
the presence of metabolic syndrome among women
with histories of gestational diabetes as well.5,19,20 Our
results may have differed from these studies for
several reasons. Carr and colleagues examined a
population at extremely high risk for diabetes,
whereas we examined a population-based sample.
Similarly, for other hospital-based analyses, it is pos-
sible that the women with histories of gestational
diabetes who return for follow-up represent a higher-
risk cohort, perhaps having greater glucose dysregu-
lation during pregnancy. Second, we surmise that
women with histories of gestational diabetes at highest
risk for diabetes (and other risk factors) may have
already developed the condition before their
NHANES interview, and thus only women at lower
risk for diabetes (and other risk factors) remain in the
histories of gestational diabetes sample. Had we been
able to examine women closer to delivery, before
anyone in the cohort developed diabetes, we might
have detected greater differences in cardiovascular
risk factors or metabolic syndrome components.4
The women with histories of gestational diabetes
in our study may have fairly benign risk factor profiles
for reasons other than their lack of development of
diabetes. It is possible that inadequate time has
elapsed to allow progression of their profiles. How-
ever, after we adjusted for age, the relationship was
not changed. In addition, women with histories of
gestational diabetes had similar leg length to women
with diagnosed diabetes, suggesting that they had
experienced similar deprivation in early life. Alterna-
tively, women with histories of gestational diabetes
who do not develop diagnosed diabetes may be
healthier than women with histories of gestational
diabetes who do develop diagnosed diabetes, or
women with histories of gestational diabetes may
have had their risks of early life deprivation modified
by improved circumstances in later life.21 Along these
lines, women with histories of gestational diabetes
may have adopted lifestyle changes that prevent them
from developing diabetes and also improved their
cardiovascular risk profile. However, in other popu-
lation-based surveys, the physical activity level and
dietary intake of women with histories of gestational
diabetes were poor.22
The addition of waist circumference to the mul-
tivariable models notably increased the proportion of
variance in cardiovascular risk factor levels explained
by the models, beyond the variance explained by
demographic factors and behavioral factors such as

alcohol intake. Greater waist circumference ac-
counted for differences in HDL cholesterol and blood
pressure levels between women with diabetes com-
pared with unaffected women and women with dia-
betes compared with women with histories of gesta-
tional diabetes, although it did not account for
differences in glucose and insulin. Waist circumfer-
ence and waist­hip ratio are commonly used mea-
sures of central obesity,23 and the importance of
central obesity as an independent predictor of cardio-
vascular risk as well as mortality has been recognized
in prospective cohort studies in women.24,25 Our
findings about the poor cardiovascular risk factor
profiles of women with diabetes are similar to those of
previous studies, particularly in NHANES.26,27
The study has several limitations. NHANES is
cross-sectional, and observations regarding levels of
metabolic syndrome components or cardiovascular risk
factors across worsening glucose intolerance states do
not necessarily reflect disease progression in individuals.
As mentioned earlier, we deliberately selected healthier
populations by examining women who had not devel-
oped diabetes, so our results do not apply to the women
with histories of gestational diabetes who develop dia-
betes. We included approximately 90 women with
histories of gestational diabetes, comparable to others'
reports, and although NHANES can distinguish be-
tween women with histories of gestational diabetes and
women with histories of gestational diabetes and diag-
nosed diabetes, the numbers of women in these sub-
groups were too few to allow comparisons.
In conclusion, women with histories of gesta-
tional diabetes may have elevated cardiovascular risk,
but this risk may be most evident through their risk
for diagnosed diabetes. Although we expected to see
greater metabolic dysfunction in women with histo-
ries of gestational diabetes, this may represent a
greater opportunity for prevention of future glucose
intolerance and associated metabolic dysfunction.
Postpartum screening after delivery for glucose intol-
erance and diabetes prevention interventions may
also be the most effective measures for lowering of
cardiovascular risk.
