Introduction
Meditation training is currently applied widely in a variety of
settings, where both its popularity as a therapeutic interven-
tion and evidence for its effectiveness are growing (Galla,
O'Reilly, Kitil, Smalley, & Black, 2014; Goyal et al., 2014;
Kabat-Zinn, 2005; Khoury et al., 2013; Sequeira, 2014).
However, meditation interventions and research are pres-
ently being carried out with little or no understanding of the
underlying philosophical grounding and the ontological
basis of contemplative traditions. The absence of a well-
developed theoretical methodological foundation has given
rise to various challenges within this field, such as not having
a standardized approach to define "meditation" (Awasthi,
2013), an inability to make sense of different types of medi-
tation practices, along with other challenges (Awasthi, 2013;
Rao, 2011; Sedlmeier et al., 2012). While most meditation
research has explored the psychological and neuroscientific
perspective, little work has investigated the underlying phil-
osophical grounding of contemplative traditions.
Considering that much of the understanding and practice
of meditation within psychology arose from dialogue with
Buddhist traditions (Kabat-Zinn, 2005, p. 43; Kang &
Whittingham, 2010; Lutz, Slagter, Dunne, & Davidson,
2008), this article carefully explores an ancient model of the
mind known as "the five aggregates" portrayed in Buddhist
teachings.1 This model is explored as a potential theoretical
resource that could guide meditation/mindfulness interven-
tions. This article also attempts to understand how conscious-
nessisanalyticallyconceivedinthesetraditions.Methodologies
of neuroscience are also examined in this article, and how
these methodologies relate to the five-aggregate model is
considered. Practical applications of the five-aggregate
model are also presented.
The Five-Aggregate Model of the Mind
The five-aggregate model of the mind describes subjective
conscious experience from a first-person perspective, and
this model has been recently described as a useful theoretical
resource that could have promising new directions for inves-
tigating the mind (Davis & Thompson, 2013). However, this
model has not been critically examined to explore whether it
could facilitate our understanding of the mind and to con-
sider its potential applications in meditation interventions.
The five aggregates are described as constituting the basic
components that make up "oneself" (Analayo, 2006, p. 201;
Bodhi, 1995, p. 27). The first aggregate is material form that
includes both the physical body and external matter (see
Table 1). The other four aggregates are feelings, perception,
volition, and sensory consciousness. In this model, feelings
relate to the subjective affective repercussions of an

The Five-Aggregate Model of the Mind
Nandini D. Karunamuni1
Abstract
The purpose of this article is to explore a model of the mind generally known as "the five aggregates" described in Buddhist
teachings that relates to understanding subjective conscious experience from a first-person perspective. This model is explored
as a potential theoretical resource that could guide meditation/mindfulness interventions. According to the five-aggregate
model of the mind, all our experience involves material form, feelings, perception, volition, and sensory consciousness. The
mind stream that is constantly changing from moment to moment is extensively analyzed in this tradition. This article explains
that methodologies in neuroscience increase our understanding of neurophysiological underpinnings of mental phenomena
and also provide important evidence on the practical utility of meditation. When considering moment-by-moment changes
that happen in the mind, however, these investigations represent sensory consciousness followed by perception that happens
within the mind stream itself. Practical applications of the model are also presented.

experience, perceptions represent being aware of attributes
of an object, and volition describes the reactive or purposive
aspect of the mind (including both intention and behavior).
Volition can find expression in bodily behavior, verbal behav-
ior, or psychological behavior. The term sensory conscious-
ness in this context refers to being conscious of something,
and constitutes experiencing a sensory stimulus (i.e., visual,
tactile, olfactory, auditory, or taste), or being conscious of a
thought (a thought concerning the past, present, or future).
The teachings describe that sensory consciousness2 can result
in the generation of any of the other three aggregates, namely
feelings, perception, or volition (Analayo, 2006).
The five aggregates are also described in terms of "internal"
and "external" (Analayo, 2006, p. 203).We experience, observe,
and analyze not only the external world but also observe and
analyze the internal world that includes attempting to under-
stand the structure/function of various organ systems of the
human body. For example, studying the musculoskeletal system
in detail happens as observations (sensory consciousness), fol-
lowed by perception (aggregate of perception). Furthermore, in
studying and analyzing the brain, it is the mind that makes infer-
ences (aggregate of perception) in terms of how the brain works
as the brain cannot talk for itself. The mind also thinks about
ourselves and about the mind itself (as we are doing right now).
The description of the aggregates is in agreement with
research investigations that show mental phenomena can orig-
inate as a result of an input from the five senses, or as a result
of a thought (known as "stimulus independent thoughts")
that intrudes into a person's awareness unintentionally
(Kvavilashvili & Mandler, 2004; Mason et al., 2007;
Smallwood & Schooler, 2006). A great deal of research shows
that the generation of mental phenomena (that follow sensory
consciousness) happens automatically, and their generation is
also influenced by individuals' previously conditioned atti-
tudes and past associations (Bargh, 2014; Dijksterhuis &
Aarts, 2010; Galdi, Arcuri, & Gawronski, 2008).
Understanding the "Stream of
Consciousness"
William James (1890), the father of American psychology,
referred to the constant change and wandering that happens
in the mind as the "stream of consciousness." Considering
the above discussion, this "stream" would represent moment-
to-moment changes that happen in conscious experience
consisting of the five aggregates.
In terms of first-person analysis of the here-and-now
moment, the present act of reading this article constitutes
visual sensory stimuli, followed by perception that under-
stands the meaning of the words. As one reads this article,
depending on the reader's conditioned attitudes and views,
various feelings may come up. Intruding thoughts (stimulus-
independent thoughts that could relate to the past or the
future) may also momentarily arise and cease. Because of
volition, one may either read on or put the article aside, per-
haps to read later. Any thoughts of disagreement or doubt
that may arise based on the content presented in this article
also represent volition.3
Table 1. The Five Aggregates and Their Descriptions With Examples.
Aggregate Description Example/s
1. Material form Elementary componentsa that make up not
only the physical body but the external
environment.
Atoms and molecules that continuously move to and
from the body.
2. Feelings Subjective affective repercussions of an
experience.
Pleasant, unpleasant, or neutral feelings.
3. Perception Being aware of attributes of an object or an
event.
Recognizing the color of an object, its shape, size, or any
other perceptions that result from analyzing the world,
our material bodies or the mind.
4. Volitionb Reactive or purposive aspects of the mind
that include intention as well as behavior.
Volition can manifest as follows: (a) Bodily behavior
(any activity), (b) Verbal behavior (speech, scolding,
etc.), (c) Psychological behavior (proliferating thoughts,
cultivating thoughts of compassion, analyzing, practicing
mindfulness, etc.).
5. Sensory consciousnessc Being conscious of something. Knowing a sensory stimulus (visual, tactile, olfactory,
auditory, or taste) or a thought (concerning the past,
present, or future).
Note. The teachings describe that all experienced moments (aggregates) are impermanent, arising, and perishing from moment to moment (Analayo,
2006).
aElementary components in original teachings refer to solidity, liquidity, heat, and motion (Analayo, 2006; Bodhi, 1995).
bThis aggregate is sometimes translated as "mental formations" (Bodhi, 1995, p. 27), as it represents a wide range of mental factors of which volition
constitutes the major factor. Volition is described as having a conditioning influence on the manifestation of the other aggregates (Analayo, 2006, p. 110;
Bodhi, 2006; Mahathera, 1933).
cSensory consciousness can result in the generation of any of the other three mind-related aggregates. The six different ways this can happen (via the
five senses or as a thought) are generally presented as "the six senses" in the Buddhist teachings (Analayo, 2006, p. 204; Bodhi, 1995, p. 27). Sensory
consciousness could also trigger mental proliferation, which represents a series of mental events.
Karunamuni 3
The present moment is experienced as a sensory stimulus
relating to visual, tactile, olfactory, auditory, taste or as a
stimulus-independent thought. However, the past and the
future are experienced as thoughts in the present moment. A
sense impression in the present moment (such as something
one hears) can come up as a mental phenomenon a few
moments later in the future (i.e., thinking about what was
heard). These sense impressions and mental phenomena
come to pass one at a time (Shapiro, Arnell, & Raymond,
1997). Studies have also shown that the ability to attend to
moment-to-moment changes of this fast-moving mind stream
is enhanced with meditation and mindfulness training (Cahn,
Delorme, & Polich, 2013; Slagter et al., 2007).
In Buddhist traditions, first-person analysis of the five
aggregates is carried out with the goal of gaining deep insight
into experience and to investigate the nature of conscious-
ness (Analayo, 2006; Bodhi, 2006; Nanaponika, 1962). In
terms of the first aggregate, the material form, the teachings
consider the similarity between material elements that make
up the material body and elements in the external environ-
ment where materials are continuously moving to and from
the material body (Analayo, 2006).4
Consciousness is understood in these traditions by directly
attending to the constantly changing mind stream, a process
that necessitates carefully monitoring the moment-to-
moment changes that happen in subjective experience. To do
this, however, the mind has to be calm. The normal tendency
of the mind is to continually leap from thought to thought
(Kvavilashvili & Mandler, 2004; Mason et al., 2007;
Smallwood & Schooler, 2006), resulting in mental prolifera-
tions where all types of associations concerning the past,
present, and future can arise.5 Focused attention meditation
practice that involves directing attention on a chosen medita-
tion object (such as the breath sensation or body sensations)
has the goal of calming the mind, reducing distractions
(Analayo, 2006; Braboszcz, Hahusseau, & Delorme, 2010;
Lutz et al., 2008; Nanaponika, 1962). On the other hand,
open monitoring meditation (where one is attentive moment
by moment to anything that occurs in experience without
focusing on any explicit object) is used to gain insight into
the nature of experienced phenomena (Analayo, 2006; Lutz
et al., 2008; Nanaponika, 1962). Open monitoring medita-
tion forms the basis for mindfulness practice (Lutz et al.,
2008) that is described as a state of non-judgmental aware-
ness of the present moment (Kabat-Zinn, 2005).
One insight gained by investigating this way is that all
experienced moments are impermanent, arising, and perish-
ing from moment to moment (Analayo, 2006; Bodhi, 1995).
The teachings explain that consciousness is in a dynamic
continuum of constantly changing experience, where past
phenomena continue to influence and condition the ever-
changing present moment (Analayo, 2006; Bodhi, 1995).6
Each experienced moment arises if causes and conditions are
there for it to come up at that moment. The commentaries of
Buddhist teachings list five causal laws or factors that can
influence how the aggregates arise in the present moment
(Mahathera, 1933). These are physical laws, biological laws,
psychological laws, volitional laws, and universal laws. Of
these, the first three laws are familiar to science. Volitional laws
refer to the aggregate of volition, and this aggregate is described
as having a conditioning influence on the manifestation of the
other aggregates (Analayo, 2006; Bodhi, 2006; Mahathera,
1933). Universal laws refer to laws of nature, such as the
impermanence of everything.
It is useful to note that other religious/spiritual traditions
also engage in the practice of meditation where the mind's
attention is often directed toward a single point of reference
in the present moment (Benson, 1976).
Methodologies of Neuroscience
Scientific investigations that continue to advance the quality
of life of people utilize third-person methodologies to sys-
tematically study the physical and natural world. Likewise,
methodologies of neuroscience that investigate neural acti-
vation patterns and pathways in the brain increase our under-
standing of neurophysiological underpinnings of mental
phenomena, and such knowledge can have various practical
applications. Uncovering both state and trait neurophysio-
logical changes that occur in the brain as a result of medita-
tion practice also continues to provide important evidence on
the practical use of meditation, especially in terms of its
potential clinical applications (Braboszcz et al., 2010;
Sequeira, 2014; Tang & Posner, 2013).
Apart from biological factors, it should be noted that
numerous other non-biological factors contribute to our sub-
jective experience in the present moment. Furthermore,
when the five-aggregate model is applied to moment-to-
moment changes that happen in consciousness, third-person
methodologies also ultimately involve observations (aggre-
gate of sensory consciousness), conducting experiments
(aggregate of volition), drawing conclusions (aggregate of
perception), as well as carrying out interventions (aggregate
of volition) that happen within an individual's mind stream.
Neurophysiological studies that indicate an individual's
intention to engage in a specific task is initiated as cerebral
activity several seconds before it enters the individual's
awareness (Bode et al., 2011; Custers & Aarts, 2010; Soon,
He, Bode, & Haynes, 2013) can be used to further illustrate
the point addressed above. In these experiments, the brain
cortex activity of a participant is monitored by a researcher,
and a participant is asked to initiate an activity (such as
pressing a button or moving a finger) as soon as he or she
feels the urge to do so. In such an experiment, the first-per-
son experience of the research participant and the researcher
can be analyzed separately, in terms of the moment-to-
moment changes that happen in the mind stream of each
individual. In the participant, when he or she was given
instructions to engage in the experimental task (auditory or
visual sensory stimuli), after the participant understood the
4 SAGE Open
instructions (aggregate of perception), the intention to initiate
the activity (aggregate of volition) was automatically generated
in his or her mind, which the participant was aware of. In terms
of the researcher's mind stream, first there was planning fol-
lowed by conducting the experiment (aggregate of volition).
Observing the brain cortex activity of the participant happened
next (visual sensory stimuli), followed by conclusions
(aggregate of perception) relating to the activity of the par-
ticipant's brain.
Two Levels of Analyses
Methodologies used in neuroscience versus analyzing the
constantly changing mind stream can be conceptualized as
representing two different levels of analysis. The former typ-
ically involves third-person analyses (that often combine
data from large groups of individuals) and has the aim of
generating practical knowledge. Attempting to understand
the constantly changing mind stream however involves anal-
yses conducted from a first-person perspective.
A distinction between phronesis and sophia proposed by
Aristotle (Trowbridge, 2011) is useful to conceptualize these
two levels of analyses. Phronesis represents practical knowl-
edge that is concerned with living well in the social world.
Major religions often refer to this level of analysis as relative
or conventional reality (Bodhi, 2006; Trowbridge, 2011). All
of science currently operates at this level of analysis. Sophia,
in contrast, involves a level of analysis referred to as "tran-
scendent wisdom" that is acquired through meditation and
contemplation. This level of analysis is often referred to as
ultimate or absolute reality by major religions (Bodhi, 2006;
Trowbridge, 2011).
In Buddhist traditions, analysis of the five aggregates is
carried out with the ultimate aim of "enlightenment," which
is described as seeing things just as they are, unadulterated
by habitual reactions and projections (Analayo, 2006, p. 60;
Bodhi, 2006, p. 55; Nanaponika, 1962). Other spiritual tradi-
tions focus on intuitive knowing of ultimate reality
(Trowbridge, 2011).
Applications of the Five-Aggregate
Model of the Mind
Research studies have shown that rumination and excessive
mental proliferation are significant transdiagnostic factors in
the manifestation of a variety of emotional disorders
(Brosschot, Gerin, & Thayer, 2006; McLaughlin & Nolen-
Hoeksema, 2011; Querstret & Cropley, 2013), and that the
practice of meditation not only leads to reductions in rumina-
tion and mental proliferation (Gu, Strauss, Bond, & Cavanagh,
2015; Kabat-Zinn, 2005; Querstret & Cropley, 2013) but also
brings about several psychological benefits, including reduc-
tions in anxiety, depression, and stress (de Frias & Whyne,
2015; Galla et al., 2014; Goyal et al., 2014; Kabat-Zinn, 2005;
Khoury et al., 2013; Larouche, Hudon, & Goulet, 2015). The
practice of meditation has also been found to be beneficial for
physical health (Carlson, 2012; Robins, Kiken, Holt, &
McCain, 2014; Tomfohr, Pung, Mills, & Edwards, 2015),
and therefore these practices are useful to be incorporated
into ordinary individual's day-to-day living.
Considering that the five-aggregate model of the mind
systematically describes one's content of experience in the
present moment, this model is an especially useful and rele-
vant theoretical resource to guide meditation interventions.
The five-aggregate model of the mind can also be helpful for
individuals who engage in meditation practices to become
more attuned to one's own emotional changes in daily living
situations, and may also enable one to gain self-understand-
ing as well as wisdom into human experience.
If the five-aggregate model is used to comprehend the
present moment, it is possible to recognize that each mental
phenomenon arises as a result of sensory consciousness.
Being cognizant of this has practical utility, especially when
dealing with unpleasant thoughts. For example, one can be
attentive to sensory consciousness (i.e., triggers) that brings
about unpleasant mind states, and even be prepared to face
such reactions with mindful awareness.
It is also useful to consider how the volition aggregate can
have a conditioning role on the manifestation of the other
aggregates (as described in the five-aggregate model). Let us
consider an individual who has an aggressive tendency, and
assume that this person received an auditory sensory stimu-
lus that he or she interpreted as an insult (aggregate of per-
ception). Then, an unpleasant feeling (aggregate of feeling)
would automatically arise in his or her mind stream, which
could lead to the arising of anger and aggressive behavior
(aggregate of volition). Aggressive behavior could lead to
many unfavorable repercussions to the individual, including
having to face accusations, regret, and even depression (these
are possible examples of manifested aggregates in the mind
stream of this individual). Now, suppose this person trained
in mindfulness meditation (aggregate of volition). Then,
when an auditory sensory stimulus arises, he or she would be
able to maintain awareness countering the impulse toward
either reaction or suppression, and thereby deactivating the
emotional and attentional pull of anger. This example is sup-
ported by research evidence that has shown practicing mind-
fulness meditation reduces mind wandering, anger, and
aggression (Rodriguez et al., 2014; Shonin, Van Gordon,
Slade, & Griffiths, 2013; Yusainy & Lawrence, 2015). If the
above two scenarios are analyzed, it was volition (reacting to
anger vs. being mindful and letting go anger) that resulted in
the difference in outcome in the individual's mind stream.
As described in Buddhist teachings, volition itself can
influence other volitional activities. For example, the cultiva-
tion of patience, self-control (engaging in ethical behavior,
etc.) and nurturing positive emotions such as compassion and
forgiveness are described as supporting the progress of medi-
tation practice (Analayo, 2006; Bodhi, 1995; De Silva, 2014).
After a period of systematic meditation practice, individu-
als can observe the impermanence of all thoughts. This is
illustrated in an intervention that targeted marginalized
Karunamuni 5
women with histories of trauma and was dealing with sub-
stance abuse issues (Vallejo & Amaro, 2009). The study
reports that following a mindfulness-based intervention,
these women were able to witness their own thoughts objec-
tively without having to act on them, which is particularly
useful in working with impulse control when a craving
arises. One participant of this study described how she was
able to watch distressing thoughts as passing clouds that
come and go (Vallejo & Amaro, 2009).
There is a substantial knowledge base on various neural
structures in the brain that are associated with healthy mental
functioning (National Institute of Mental Health, 2005), as
well as an accumulating body of evidence that show medita-
tion training brings about favorable changes in important neu-
ral structures (Holzel et al., 2011; Larouche et al., 2015;
Posner, Tang, & Lynch, 2014; Sequeira, 2014; Tang & Posner,
2013). Therefore, neuroscientific investigations of meditation
practice can continue to play a role in both primary and sec-
ondary prevention of mental disorders. In addition, recent
research has shown the feasibility of using real-time func-
tional magnetic resonance imaging (rt-fMRI) to link mea-
sures of brain activity with reports of ongoing subjective
experience (Garrison et al., 2013; Sarkheil et al., 2015).
Rt-fMRI investigations may enable one to examine how the
five-aggregate model operates neurologically in real time,
and such investigations may have practical applications. One
rt-fMRI investigation that linked measures of brain activity
with reports of ongoing subjective experience showed that
meditators, but not non-meditators, were able to manipulate a
feedback graph volitionally (by focusing on their breath sen-
sation), and this was associated with significant deactivation
in the posterior cingulate cortex (the hub of the default mode
network that is linked to mental proliferation) in meditators
but not non-meditators (Garrison et al., 2013).
Summary and Conclusion
Numerous scientists have stated that the entire outside world
is experienced within the brain.7 However, as explained in
this article, the brain is also analyzed within the mind's
stream of experience. The mind stream of each individual is
constantly changing. In the Buddhist practice, it is this mind
stream itself that is extensively investigated and analyzed
from a first-person perspective. As described in the five-
aggregate model, the moment-to-moment manifestation of
the mind constitutes feelings, perception, volition, and sen-
sory consciousness.
Although scientific interest in meditation reflects a recent
shift in cognitive science toward viewing first-person experi-
ence of participants as a valuable object of scientific investiga-
tion (Braboszcz et al., 2010), there appears to be confusion in
terms of clearly separating first-person and third-person analy-
ses due to the lack of understanding of meditation in the origi-
nating traditions. Research in neuroscience uncovers various
associations between mental phenomena and neural activation
patterns. Such investigations increase our understanding of
biological factors associated with mental phenomena and also
provide important evidence on the practical utility of medita-
tion. When considering the moment-by-moment manifesta-
tion of the mind, however, these investigations also represent
observations (sensory consciousness), followed by thoughts
(perception) that happen within an individual's mind stream.
Considering that the five-aggregate model comprehen-
sively describes the moment-to-moment changes that happen
in the mind stream, it not only provides a guideline for medi-
tation/mindfulness interventions and research but it could
also be helpful in instructing and teaching mindfulness.

Notes
1. The term Buddhist teachings in this article refers to the earliest
known teachings of the Buddha that are recorded in the Sutta
Pitaka section of the Pali Cannon in the Theravada Buddhist
tradition. The description of the five aggregates (and the medi-
tation methods based on the five aggregates) presented in this
article specifically originates from the Satipatthana Sutta, a
foundational Buddhist discourse on meditation practice that is
listed in the Sutta Pitaka.
2. According to the teachings, sensory consciousness happens by
way of "contact." Contact refers to the coming together of the
sense organ (e.g., the organ eye), the sense object (e.g., the
visual object), and attention or conscious engagement. If one
of the three is missing, sensory consciousness does not happen
(Maha-hatthipadopama Sutta, MN 28, 2003).
3. This example is modified from a practical illustration of the
aggregates given by Analayo (2006).
4. This is in line with scientific understandings of the physical
body where thousands of metabolic reactions happen all the
time, and material elements that make up the body are con-
stantly moving to and from the environment (as a result of our
eating, drinking, breathing, and eliminating).
5. According to the Buddha's analysis of experience, mental pro-
liferation can make one a victim of one's own associations and
thoughts where the "thinker" becomes almost a helpless prey
(Analayo, 2006, p. 222).
6. Together with the physical body, Buddhist teachings consider
the human being as a constantly changing psycho-physical unit,
where everything is in a state of constant flux (Mahathera, 1933).
