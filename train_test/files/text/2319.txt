National Trends in Psychotropic Medication Use in
Young Children: 1994­2009
WHAT'S KNOWN ON THIS SUBJECT: Studies of psychotropic use in
very young US children in the last decade have been limited by the
regions, insurance types, or medication classes examined. There
is a paucity of recent, nationally representative investigations of
US preschool psychotropic use.
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: In a national sample of 2 to 5 year olds,
the likelihood of psychotropic prescription peaked in the mid-
2000s, then stabilized in the late 2000s. Increased psychotropic
use in boys, white children, and those lacking private health
insurance was documented.
abstract
OBJECTIVE: To examine recent national trends in psychotropic use for
very young children at US outpatient medical visits.
METHODS: Data for 2- to 5-year-old children (N = 43 598) from the
1994­2009 National Ambulatory and National Hospital Ambulatory
Medical Care Surveys were used to estimate the weighted
percentage of visits with psychotropic prescriptions. Multivariable
logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with
psychotropic use. Time effects were examined in 4-year blocks
(1994­1997, 1998­2001, 2002­2005, and 2006­2009).
RESULTS: Psychotropic prescription rates were 0.98% from 1994­1997,
0.83% from 1998­2001, 1.45% from 2002­2005, and 1.00% from 2006­
2009. The likelihood of preschool psychotropic use was highest in
2002­2005 (1994­1997 adjusted odds ratio [AOR] versus 2002­2005:
0.67; 1998­2001 AOR versus 2002­2005: 0.63; 2006­2009 AOR versus
2002­2005: 0.64), then diminished such that the 2006­2009 probability
of use did not differ from 1994­1997 or from 1998­2001. Boys (AOR
versus girls: 1.64), white children (AOR versus other race: 1.42), older
children (AOR for 4 to 5 vs 2 to 3 year olds: 3.87), and those lacking
private insurance (AOR versus privately insured: 2.38) were more
likely than children from other groups to receive psychotropic pre-
scriptions.
CONCLUSIONS: Psychotropic prescription was notable for peak usage in
2002­2005 and sociodemographic disparities in use. Further study is
needed to discern why psychotropic use in very young children stabi-
lized in 2006­2009, as well as reasons for increased use in boys, white
children, and those lacking private health insurance. Pediatrics

ARTICLE
There is increasing recognition that
significantmentalhealthproblemsmay
occur in very young children.1,2 Epide-
miologic studies have documented two-
to threefold increases in psychotropic
prescriptions for US preschool children
during 1991­2001,3,4 even though few
psychotropic medications are approved
for this age group by the US Food and
Drug Administration (FDA).5,6 However,
there is a paucity of nationally repre-
sentative studies investigating more
recent trends in preschool psychotropic
medication usage.7 The impact of more
recent commercial developments (in-
cluding new product releases)8 and
scientific advisories (such as FDA "black
box warnings" and public health advi-
sories regarding psychotropic medi-
cations)9­11 is not well characterized for
this age group.
Most previous studies of preschool psy-
chotropic use have been demographi-
cally limited, focusing on Medicaid
samples, region-specific managed-care
health maintenance organization (HMO)
populations, or privately insured chil-
dren,3,4,12,13 whereas others have con-
centrated on a single medication class
(eg, stimulants14,15 or atypical anti-
pyschotics16). There is a need to un-
derstand better the sociodemographic
trends in psychotropic use among very
young children. For example, 2 studies
have noted higher rates of psychotropic
medication use during the 1990s in pre-
schoolers enrolled in Medicaid com-
pared with non-Medicaid groups,
whereas 1 study did not.3,12,17 Other
sociodemographic predictors may in-
clude gender and race/ethnicity. Pre-
vious studies in the late 1990s and early
2000s have revealed increased psycho-
tropic prescription rates in preschool
boys compared with girls,4,12 and in very
young white compared with black chil-
dren,4,17 but these samples were de-
mographic groupspecific (Medicaid-only
or region-specific HMO populations). The
extent of differences in psychotropic
prescription based on health insurance
type, gender, and race have not been
determined in updated, more socio-
demographically diverse samples of very
young children.
The current study examined trends in
and sociodemographic predictors of
psychotropic medication use among 2-
to 5-year-old children in a US nationally
representativesampleofvisitstooffice-
based practices and hospital-based
outpatient clinics over a 16-year pe-
riod (1994­2009). We further examined
trends in mental health diagnoses to
determine which diagnoses were as-
sociated with the highest medication
rates, and the relationship between
changing rates of behavioral diagnoses
and the likelihood of psychotropic
medication receipt over time.
METHODS
Data Source and Design
We used data from the National Am-
bulatory Medical Care Survey (NAMCS)
and the National Hospital Ambulatory
Medical Care Survey (NHAMCS), which
collectdataonpatientvisitstocommunity,
non­federally funded, office-based physi-
cian practices and hospital-based out-
patient clinics throughout the United
States.18 We did not include hospital-
based emergency department data to
maintain a focus on medication pre-
scriptionsatnonemergentvisits.Thus,we
analyzeddatafromoffice-basedphysician
practice and hospital-based outpatient
clinicvisits(N=43 598)between1994and
2009 for 2- to 5-year-old children.
Thesurveysuseamultistateprobability
design as described previously.19 The
NAMCS has a 3-stage sampling design,
with sampling based on geographic lo-
cation, physician practices within a geo-
graphic location (stratified by physician
specialty), and visits within individual
physician practices. The NHAMCS has a
4-stage sampling design, with sampling
based on geographic area, hospitals
within a geographic area, clinics within
hospitals, and patient visits within clin-
ics. Each visit is weighted to allow cal-
culation of national estimates by using
selection probability, adjustment for
nonresponse, ratio adjustment to fixed
totals, and weight smoothing.
Visit-Level Data
For each visit, participating physicians
or their staff members provided pa-
tient sociodemographic and clinical
information, including visit diagnoses
and medications.20
Visit Diagnoses
Visit diagnoses were recorded on the
basis of International Classification of
Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modifi-
cation, codes. Up to 3 diagnoses were
recorded for each visit. Mental health
diagnoses were grouped into 8 catego-
ries: (1) attention-deficit/hyperactivity
disorder (ADHD)/hyperkinesis, (2) dis-
ruptive behavior disorders, (3) perva-
sive developmental disorders, (4) sleep
problems,(5)anxietydisorders,(6)mood
disorders, (7) adjustment disorders, and
(8) psychosis (see Appendix 1).
Medications
Medications prescribed, supplied, ad-
ministered,orcontinuedatthevisitwere
documented. Up to 5 medications were
recorded per visit in 1994 and up to 6
medications per visit were recorded in
1995­2002. Starting in 2003, the maxi-
mum number of recorded medications
per visit was increased to 8. Beginning
in 2006, NAMCS/NHAMCS grouped all
medications on the basis of Multum's
therapeutic classification system.20
NAMCS/NHAMCS-supplied code was
used to convert pre-2006 medication
information to Multum's classification
system before analysis.
Children were considered to have been
taking a psychotropic if any medication
from the following 6 classes was en-
dorsed for the visit: (1) anxiolytics, sed-
atives,andhypnotics;(2)centralnervous
616 CHIRDKIATGUMCHAI et al
system stimulants; (3) antidepressants;
(4) antipsychotics; (5) antiadrenergic
agents; and (6) mood stabilizers. Ap-
pendix 2 lists medications within each
class. We did not count antihistamines
(eg, diphenhydramine and hydroxyzine)
as psychotropic medications because
they are used for a variety of non-
psychotropicpurposes.Benzodiazepines,
barbiturates, and mood stabilizers with
indications for seizure treatment were
counted as psychotropic medications
only if the patient did not have a seizure
diagnosis. Antiadrenergic agents were
counted as psychotropic medications
only if the patient did not have a hyper-
tension diagnosis.
Primary Sources of Visit Payment
Visit payment primary source was des-
ignated in NAMCS/NHAMCS as private
health insurance, Medicaid/SCHIP (State
Children's Health Insurance Program),
self-pay, no charge/charity, or "other."
Because of low numbers of children re-
ceiving psychotropic medications in the
self-pay, no charge/charity, or "other"
groups (n = 70 for entire study period),
these groups were combined with the
Medicaid/SCHIP group into a single
"other type" category for analysis.
Race
Child race was designated in NAMCS/
NHAMCS as white, black/African Ameri-
can,Asian,nativeHawaiianorAlaskan,or
"more than one race reported." Because
of low numbers of children receiving
psychotropic medications in the Asian,
native Hawaiian or Alaskan, and "more
than one race reported" groups (n = 38
for the entire study period), these
groups were combined with black/
African American patients into a single
"nonwhite" category for analysis.
Data Analysis
To account for the complex survey de-
sign, sample weights and design varia-
bles were applied according to NAMCS/
NHAMCS guidelines for all analyses.21­25
Analyses were performed by using SAS
statistical software, version 9.3 (SAS
Institute, Cary, NC).
Descriptive statistics on the rate of visits
with at least 1 recorded psychotropic
medication were calculated for the
sample overall by year. To obtain more
robust and reliable estimates for para-
metric analyses (such that estimates
were based on .30 unweighted obser-
vations and relative standard error [SE]
,30%20 unless otherwise specified),
data were combined into 4-year periods
(1994­1997, 1998­2001, 2002­2005, and
2006­2009), and rates of visits with any
psychotropic medicationuse,any central
nervous system stimulant use, and any
coded behavioral diagnosis were repor-
ted by sociodemographic subgroup.
Multivariable logistic regression iden-
tified factors independently associated
with psychotropic use, stimulant use,
andbehavioraldiagnosesamong2-to5-
year-old children. Covariates in the
multivariablelogisticregression model
were age, gender, race, health in-
surancestatus,and4-yearstudyperiod.
The 2006­2009 period served as the
reference category in the analyses to
determine if the most recent rates of
psychotropic usage or behavioral di-
agnosis differed from that of previous
periods. Analyses using the period of
highest psychotropic usage as the ref-
erence group were also conducted.
The institutional review board of Cin-
cinnati Children's Hospital determined
this study to be exempt from review
due to the use of deidentified data.
RESULTS
Table 1 shows study population char-
acteristics.
Overall Patterns of Psychotropic
Medication Use
A psychotropic medication was pre-
scribedat1.07%ofoffice-basedmedical
visits between 1994 and 2009 for 2- to
5-year-old children. Annual rates of
visits with psychotropic prescriptions
varied from 0.46% in 1998 to 1.85% in
2004 (Fig 1). Rates of psychotropic pre-
scriptionvaried by timeperiod(Table 2).
The likelihood of psychotropic pre-
scription was highest in 2002­2005,
with the likelihood of treatment in other
time periods 33% to37% less. The 2006­
2009 probability of psychotropic use
was significantly lower than that in
2002­2005, and did not differ from that
in 1994­1997 or 1998­2001 (Table 2).
The likelihood of psychotropic use was
higher in boys versus girls, in 4 to 5 year
olds versus 2 to 3 year olds, in white
versus nonwhite children, and in those
lacking versus those with private health
insurance (Table 2).
Stimulants were the most commonly
prescribed psychotropic medication
class in all study periods. The stimulant
usepatternover timewassimilar tothat
of overall psychotropic use, with stimu-
lant prescription likelihood during the
1994­1997 and 1998­2001 periods 49%
to 58% lower than that in 2002­2005,
whereas the 2006­2009 likelihood of use
did not differ from any previous time
period (Table 2). No medication class
other than stimulants had estimates for
all time periods meeting our pre-
determined level of reliability (.30 un-
weighted observations and relative SE
,30%, see Supplemental Table 4). Esti-
mates for rates of combined psycho-
pharmacology (use of .1 psychotropic
class) also fell below our reliability cri-
teria (see Supplemental Table 4).
Patterns of Behavioral Diagnosis
From 1994 to 2009, the overall rate of
having $1 behavioral diagnosis at
office-based medical visits for 2 to5 year
olds was 1.56%, with rates showing
a relative increase of 56% from the first
study interval to the last (Table 2). The
likelihood of having a behavioral di-
agnosis increased during each 4-year

study interval in a stepwise fashion. Boys,
older children (4­5 years old), and those
lacking private insurance were more
likely than children from other groups to
have behavioral diagnoses (Table 2).
From 1994 to 2009, ADHD was the most
common diagnosis with a rate of 0.78%,
followed by disruptive behavior, perva-
sive developmental, sleep, anxiety, mood,
and adjustment disorders (Table 3).
Psychotropic Medication Use
Among Children With Behavioral
Diagnoses
Among children with $1 behavioral
diagnosis, the psychotropic medication
rate during the 1994­2009 study period
was 35.9% compared with 0.5% among
children without behavioral diagnoses
(Table 3). Psychotropic prescription
rates were highest for children with
ADHD and mood disorder diagnoses
(57.8% to 65.7%) (Table 3). Psychotro-
pic usage rates among children with
behavioral diagnoses decreased over
the study period from 43.4% in 1994­
1997 to 29.2% in 2006­2009 (Fig 2). In
fact, the likelihood of psychotropic use
among children with a behavioral di-
agnosis in 1994­1997 was more than
double that of 2006­2009 (Fig 2).
DISCUSSION
This study provides the first evaluation,
to our knowledge, of changes in psy-
chotropic medication rates in a nation-
ally representative sample of very
young children from the 1990s to the
later 2000s. The likelihood of psycho-
tropic medication use in 2 to 5 year olds
was higher in the early 2000s (2002­
2005) compared with the 1990s, but
then stabilized such that the 2006­2009
likelihood did not differ from that of the
1994­1997 and 1998­2001 periods. In
contrast, the likelihood of receiving a
behavioral diagnosis increased through-
out the study interval. Surprisingly, in-
creased diagnosis was not accompanied
by an increased propensity toward psy-
chotropic prescription, because the like-
lihood of psychotropic use in 2006­2009
was half that of the 1994­1997 period
among those with a behavioral diagnosis.
The temporal trends in psychotropic
prescriptionweobservedwereconsistent
with those of previous non­nationally
representative studies documenting a
substantial increase in preschool psy-
chotropic use from 1991 to 2001.3,4 The
psychotropic usage stabilization we
found in the late 2000s was also ob-
served in a study in privately insured,
very young children13 and in a nationally
representative sample that limited its
examination to psychostimulants.15 The
overall psychotropic prescription rates
we documented were generally compa-
rable to those of previous US preschool
samples. Our 1994­1997 and 1998­2001
psychotropic prescription rates were
within the ranges found in previous
studies of these time intervals (0.8% to
1.8%7,17 and 0.3% to 2.3%,4,12,13 re-
spectively). Our 2002­2005 psychotropic
usage rate was higher than that of
a North Carolina cohort (0.3%) during
this time period,26 with the discrepancy
likely explained by our relatively older
sample (2 to 5 years old compared with
0 to 4 years old) or by state-specific
variation in use, because previous
studies have documented substantial
region-specific variation in psychotropic
prescription rates.27­29 Our 2006­2009
psychotropic prescription rate was
somewhat lower than the rate (1.5%)
documented in a privately insured
sample.13 The reasons for this discrep-
ancy are unclear, but may be due to

being counted as psychotropic medi-
cations in the previous study (ie, the
previous study does not specify whether
hydroxyzine or diphenhydramine were
included, whereas we excluded them).
Stimulants were the most commonly
prescribed psychotropic class in ours
as well as previous studies in this age
group.3,4,12,13 Our 1994­1997, 1998­2001,
and 2006­2009 stimulant prescription
rates were all within the ranges ob-
served previously in these time inter-
vals.3,4,7,13­15,17 Our 2002­2005 stimulant
prescription rate was somewhat higher
than the 2002­2003 rate (0.3%) ob-
served by Zuvekas and Vitiello,15 with
the discrepancy likely explained by our
use of a relatively older sample (2 to 5
years old versus 0 to 5 years old).
Wefoundthattheprobabilityofreceiving
a behavioral diagnosis increased in
a stepwise fashion in each successive
study interval, with a 55% higher likeli-
hood observed in the last study interval
compared with the first. There is a pau-
city of data on rates of behavioral di-
agnoses at nationally representative
preschool outpatient medical visits.
Some studies in regional and privately
insured samples are available, although
theirmethodologydifferedfromourown.
A 1997­1998 study of preschool regional
HMO visits documented a somewhat
higher rate (2%) for emotional/behavior
symptoms and/or diagnoses, whereas
our rate during this time period in-
cluded only coded diagnoses.12 Consis-
tent with our findings, Olfson et al13
found an increasing rate of behavioral
diagnosis coding from 1999­2001 (3.2%)
to 2007 (3.9%), with diagnostic rates at
both time points higher than our ob-
servations, possibly because unlike the
previous study, we did not count mental
retardation and communication/learning
disorders as behavioral diagnoses. Our

study aligned with previous preschool
samples in that ADHD was the most
common behavioral diagnosis.12,13
Our findings reveal not only a stabili-
zation of overall psychotropic use over
time in very young children but a di-
minishedlikelihoodofpsychotropicuse
for those with behavioral diagnoses.
This finding may be explained in part by
public response to US FDA warnings on
psychotropic medications in the mid- to
late-2000s, including the 2004 black box
warning on antidepressant medications
regarding child and adolescent suici-
dality risk,33 the 2005 Public Health Ad-
visory regarding potential for serious
cardiovascular events with amphet-
amines,9 the 2005 black box warning on
atomoxetine regarding potential sud-
den death and suicidal ideation,10 the
2006 FDA Advisory Committee recom-
mendation for a black box warning on
psychostimulants (which was later re-
versed),11,34 and the 2007 directive to
ADHD medication manufacturers to no-
tify patients about adverse cardiovascu-
lar events and psychiatric symptoms.11
Indeed, although not focused on pre-
schoolers, several previous studies have
shown that rates of pediatric antide-
pressant use were significantly de-
creased after the 2004 FDA black box
warnings,35­37 which is congruent with
the antidepressant usage pattern we
observed (see Supplemental Table 4).
However, this phenomenon did not occur
uniformly across psychotropic classes;
similar to 3 previous studies, only 1 of
which looked at 0 to 5 year olds sepa-
rately from older children,15,34,38 we did
not find that the likelihood of stimulant
prescription was significantly different
in the periods before and after the FDA
stimulant warnings.
We found that very young children who
were older, male, white, and lacking
private insurance were more likely to
receive psychotropic medications. This
finding is consistent with previous
studies documenting higher rates of
psychotropicuseinoldercomparedwith
younger,4,12 male compared with fe-
male,4,7,12 and white compared with Af-
rican American preschool children.4,17
Our finding that children lacking private
insurance were more likely than those
with private insurance to take psycho-
tropic medications confirmed results of
2 previous preschool samples3,12 and
a US nationally representative 1996 sur-
vey of 0 to 18 year olds,7 but contrasted
with findings from a 1996 preschool
sample.17 Additional study is needed to
determine why certain groups of very
young children are more likely to receive
psychotropic medications and to de-
termine the appropriateness of these
prescriptions. Possible reasons for
sociodemographicdisparitiesinusemay
include factors such as certain groups
having higher rates of behavioral dis-
orders (due to increased exposure39,40 or
susceptibility41 to mental health risk
factors), a bias toward higher rates of
disorder identification,42 more favor-
able attitudes toward psychotropic
medication use,43 or diminished ac-
cess to or acceptability of behavioral
interventions.44
Our study has several limitations. The
relatively small number of 2- to 5-year-
old children receiving psychotropic
medications makes it difficult to provide
reliable yearly usage estimates and
prohibitsthereliableestimationofrates
foreach medication class separately for
the 4-year time intervals, with the ex-
ception of the psychostimulants. Spe-
cifically, changes in antidepressant,
atypical antipsychotic, antiadrenergic,
andmood stabilizer usage over timeare
of substantial interest, but we cannot
make definitive comments on them. Due
to the low numbers of preschool chil-
dren using .1 psychotropic class, we
also cannot draw firmconclusions about
trends in psychotropic polypharmacy in
this age group over time. In addition,
NAMCS and NHAMCS medication data
were recorded by physicians or their
office staff. We were unable to cross-
check data with pharmacy records or
patient/family reports of use, so it is not
known if psychotropic prescriptions
were actually filled and administered.
Data are also limited in the number of
medications (5­8) and diagnoses (3)
recorded foreach visit, so if children had
psychotropic medications and behav-
ioral diagnoses that were listed more
distally in their records, they would not
have been recorded. In addition, data on
diagnoses reflect physicians' coding
practices, but children did not have
standardized diagnostic assessments to
determinethe validity oftheirdiagnoses.
CONCLUSIONS
Despite public concern about an in-
exorable increase in pediatric psycho-
tropicmedicationuse,wefoundthatthe
likelihood of psychotropic medication

prescription in nationally representa-
tive office medical visits for 2- to 5-year-
old children peaked in 2002­2005, and
then stabilized such that the 2006­2009
likelihood did not differ from that of the
1994­1997 and 1998­2001 periods.
Stabilization of psychotropic pre-
scriptions cannot be explained by a
diminished emphasis on mental health
issues during preschool medical visits,
because the likelihood of receiving
a behavioral diagnosis increased over
time. In fact, among those with behav-
ioral diagnoses, psychotropic usage
decreased over time from 43% in
1994­1997 to 29% in 2006­2009. Future
study is needed to determine why boys,
white children, and those lacking pri-
vate insurance had an increased like-
lihood of psychotropic use, and to
design interventions to ensure that
differences in use are congruent with
well-informed family goals and pref-
erences. In addition, our findings un-
derscore the need to ensure that
doctors of very young children who are
diagnosing ADHD, the most common
diagnosis, and prescribing stimulants,
the most common psychotropic medi-
cations, are using the most up-to-date
and stringent diagnostic criteria and
clinical practice guidelines.45 Further-
more, given the continued use of psy-
chotropic medications in very young
children and concerns regarding their
effects on the developing brain, future
studies on the long-term effects of
psychotropic medication use in this
age group are essential.46
