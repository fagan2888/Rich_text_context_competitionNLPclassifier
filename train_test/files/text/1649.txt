Abstract
Evidence supports active smoking as a major source of
exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH),
compounds that are mutagenic and carcinogenic in
humans. The influence of involuntary exposure to
tobacco smoke on PAH exposure levels among non-
smokers, however, is unknown. This study evaluated
the association between both active and involuntary
tobacco smoke and biomarkers of PAH exposure in the
general U.S. population. A cross-sectional analysis of
5,060 participants z6 years of age was done using data
from the 1999-2002 National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey (NHANES). PAH exposure was
measured by urinary concentrations of 23 monohydroxy-
lated metabolites of nine PAH compounds. Tobacco
smoke exposure was defined as no exposure, involun-
tary exposure, and active exposure by combining serum
cotinine levels, smoking status, and presence of house-
hold smokers. PAH metabolite levels ranged from
33.9 ng/L for 9-hydroxyphenanthrene to 2,465.4 ng/L for
2-hydroxynaphthalene. After adjustment for age, sex,
race/ethnicity, education, household income, and
broiled/grilled food consumption, participants invo-
luntarily and actively exposed to tobacco smoke had
urinary metabolite concentrations that were increased
by a factor of 1.1 to 1.4 and 1.5 to 6.9, respectively,
compared with unexposed participants. Associations
for involuntary smoking were stronger and statistically
significant for 1-hydroxypyrene, 2-hydroxyfluorene,
3-hydroxyfluorene, 9-hydroxyfluorene, 1-hydroxyphe-
nanthrene, 2-hydroxyphenanthrene, and 3-hydroxyphe-
nanthrene compared with other metabolites. Involuntary
exposure to tobacco smoke was associated with elevated
urinary concentrations of most PAH metabolites in a
representative sample of the U.S. population. Policy
and educational efforts must continue to minimize
PAH exposure through active and involuntary tobacco
smoke exposure. (Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev

Introduction
Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), a group of
more than 100 different compounds, are widely distrib-
uted in the environment as a result of incomplete
combustion of natural and man-made organic materials
(1, 2). Listed by the United States Environmental
Protection Agency as priority environmental pollutants
(3), many PAHs are established human carcinogens,
mutagens, and cocarcinogens (1, 4-9). Major sources of
nonoccupational exposure include tobacco smoke, con-
taminated foods, and polluted air and water (10-13).
Tobacco smoke, a major source of indoor air pollution,
contains >60 known carcinogens, including PAHs, in
both mainstream and sidestream fractions (14-16).
Sufficient evidence has shown higher PAH exposure
levels among current smokers compared with non-
smokers (17-20). Although the health effects among
nonsmokers who live with or spend time in the
proximity of smokers are well established (8), few studies
have evaluated the contribution of involuntary tobacco
smoke exposure (also known as secondhand smoke,
passive smoke, or environmental tobacco smoke) to PAH
levels (21, 22).
Our objective was to investigate the association
between both active and involuntary tobacco smoke
exposure with PAH as measured by urinary concen-
trations of monohydroxylated PAH metabolites in a
representative sample of the civilian noninstitutionalized
U.S. population using data from the National Health
and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 1999-2002
(23, 24). Twenty-three metabolite isomers of the nine
parent PAH compounds (benz[a]anthracene, benzo[a]
pyrene, benzo[c]phenanthrene, chrysene, fluoranthene,
fluorene, naphthalene, phenanthrene, and pyrene) were
selected for study in NHANES 1999-2002 by the National
Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). We hypothesized
that the levels of tobacco smoke exposure are positively
associated with urinary PAH metabolite concentrations
in a dose-response manner in the general population.

ipants z6 y of age. Details of the survey design, data
collection methods, and data files for NHANES are
available from the NCHS Web site1 (23, 24). The
NHANES protocol was reviewed and approved by the
NCHS Institutional Review Board. All participants
provided written informed consent at the time of
household interview and physical examination.
NHANES 1999-2002 completed a total of 19,759
household interviews and standardized physical exams
at a mobile examination center (response rate, 78%).
One third of those z6 y of age were randomly selected
for urinary monohydroxylated PAH metabolite measure-
ments (n = 5,546), and over the period of 4 y, a total of
5,108 participants had 13 PAH metabolite measurements
(23, 24). The analytic sample was reduced by about
half for the 3-hydroxyfluoranthene (3-OHFrt) metabolite,
which was only available in NHANES 1999-2000
(n = 2,457) and for the 3-hydroxybenzo[a]pyrene
(3-OHB[a]P), 1-hydroxychrysene (1-OHChr), 2-hydroxy-
chrysene (2-OHChr), 4-hydroxychrysene (4-OHChr),
9-hydroxyfluorene (9-OHFle), 4-hydroxyphenanthrene
(4-OHPhe), 9-hydroxyphenanthrene (9-OHPhe), 1-
hydroxynaphthalene (1-OHNap), and 2-hydroxynaphtha-
lene (2-OHNap) metabolites, which were only available
in NHANES 2001-2002 (n = 2,748). Additionally, sample
sizes varied slightly for individual PAH metabolites due
to missing levels for some metabolites (Table 1).
Urinary Monohydroxylated PAH Metabolites. A
5-mL aliquot from each spot urine specimen was
taken for PAH metabolite measurements. The following
23 monohydroxylated metabolites were measured at
the Division of Environmental Health Laboratory
Sciences of the Centers for Disease Control and Preven-
tion: 1-hydroxybenz[a ]anthracene (1-OHB[a ]A),
3-hydroxybenz[a]anthracene (3-OHB[a]A), 3-OHB[a]P,
1-hydroxybenzo[c]phenanthrene (1-OHB[c]P), 2-hydrox-
ybenzo[c]phenanthrene (2-OHB[c]P), 3-hydroxybenzo[c]
phenanthrene (3-OHB[c]P), 1-OHChr, 2-OHChr,
3-hydroxychrysene (3-OHChr), 4-OHChr, 6-hydroxy-
chrysene (6-OHChr), 3-OHFrt, 2-hydroxyfluorene
(2-OHFle), 3-hydroxyfluorene (3-OHFle), 9-OHFle,
1-OHNap, 2-OHNap, 1-hydroxyphenanthrene (1-OHPhe),

threne (3-OHPhe), 4-OHPhe, 9-OHPhe, and 1-hydroxy-
pyrene (1-OHPyr; refs. 23, 24).
The analytic procedure for measurement of monohy-
droxylated metabolites of PAH involved enzymatic
hydrolysis of urine, solid-phase extraction, derivatiza-
tion, and analysis using capillary gas chromatography
combined with high-resolution mass spectrometry

following previously described methods (25, 26). Isotope
dilution with 13C-labeled standards was used for
quantification. Blanks, urine pools, and internal standard
samples were used in each analytic run for quality
control purposes. The ranges for the interassay coeffi-
cients of variation for each metabolite are shown in
Table 1. The limits of detection (LOD) varied by
metabolite and survey years, ranging from 2 ng/L for
1-OHPyr to 15.3 ng/L for 3-OHPhe (Table 1). The NCHS
imputed a default value of LOD divided by the square
root of two for those subjects with metabolite levels
below the LOD. Metabolites for which >20% of partic-
ipants were below the LOD were not considered further
for this study.
Smoking Status and Tobacco Smoke Exposure.
Participants z20 y of age were classified as never,
former, or current smokers based on the household
interview items: ``Have you smoked at least 100
cigarettes in your entire life?'' and ``Do you now smoke
cigarettes?'' Smoking status among participants 12 to
19 y of age was derived from audio-computer-assisted
interview items: ``Have you ever tried cigarette smoking,
even 1 or 2 puffs?'' and ``During the past 30 days, on how
many days did you smoke cigarettes?''
Serum cotinine, a metabolite of nicotine, was deter-
mined using isotope dilution high-performance liquid
chromatography/atmospheric pressure chemical ioniza-
tion tandem mass spectrometry (23, 24). The LOD for
serum cotinine was <0.05 ng/mL.
Similar to Weitzman et al. (27), we defined current
active smoking exposure, involuntary smoking exposure,
and no exposure to tobacco smoke by combining cotinine
levels, living with a smoker in the household, and
smoking status as follows: (a) active smoking exposure
was defined as self-reported current smoking or cotinine
levels z10 ng/mL (28); (b) involuntary exposure to
tobacco smoke was defined as parental report of any
smoker in the home or detectable but <10 ng/mL
cotinine levels in children <12 y of age (28, 29), and
as self-report of any smoker living in the home in
the absence of self-reported smoking or detectable but
<10 ng/mL cotinine levels in adolescents and adults;
and (c) no exposure to tobacco smoke was defined as
cotinine levels below the LOD, not living with a smoker,
and not being a current smoker. Three children ages 6 to
11 y with cotinine levels z10 ng/mL were dropped from
our analyses; thus, no active smoking exposure category
existed for this age group.
Other Variables. Potential determinants of PAH
metabolites evaluated in our analyses included age, sex,
race/ethnicity, education, poverty income ratio (PIR),
consumption of grilled/broiled meat and alcohol, body
mass index (BMI), current occupation, physical activity
level, and urinary creatinine. Age, sex, race/ethnicity,
education, current occupation, physical activity, and
alcohol consumption were obtained during the interview
based on self-reported information. PIR is a ratio of
self-reported family income to the family's poverty
threshold values, which were standardized by family
size and inflation rates based on tables published
annually by the U.S. Bureau of Census (30). Self-reported
grilled/broiled meat intake was obtained from the
dietary interview component of NHANES and recoded
as ``yes'' or ``no'' according to whether participants
reported having eaten any grilled or broiled red meat in
the past 24 h. Data on description of food and cooking
method consumed by each participant were obtained
from the U.S. Department of Agriculture food and
nutrition database (31). Alcohol consumption in adults
was classified as never, former, and current. The level
of physical activity was computed from the total
metabolic equivalent of task scores for all physical
activities done in the previous 30 d.
BMI (kg/m2) in adults was computed from measured
weight and height and categorized into normal (BMI,
<25 kg/m2), overweight (BMI, 25-29 kg/m2), and obese
(BMI, z30 kg/m2). BMI in children and adolescents
(<20 y old) was based on the age- and sex-specific BMI
growth charts (32) as normal (BMI, <85th percentile),
at risk for overweight (BMI, 85-95th percentile), and
overweight (BMI, z95th percentile; ref. 33). Urinary
creatinine was measured in the same specimen as PAH
metabolites by using a photometric Boehringer Mannheim/
Hitachi 912 analyzer (23, 24).
Statistical Analysis. All statistical analyses were
conducted with STATA version 9.2 statistical software
(Stata Corp.) using appropriate sampling weights devel-
oped by NCHS for this random subsample to obtain
accurate estimates representative of the noninstitution-
alized U.S. population (34). The Taylor linearization
method was used to obtain proper SEs of all estimates.
PAH metabolites were right skewed and log10
trans-
formed for the analyses. Geometric means and inter-
quartile ranges were computed for all metabolites. To
assess determinants of PAH exposure, the ratios and
95% confidence intervals (95% CI) of the geometric mean
PAH metabolite levels were estimated using linear
regression models on log10
-transformed metabolite levels
by main determinants including age, sex, race/ethnicity,
education, PIR, self-reported dietary grilled/broiled
meat, cotinine levels, smoking status (never/former/
current), and current exposure to tobacco smoke (none/
involuntary/active).
To examine the association of each metabolite with
current exposure to tobacco smoke, linear regression
models on log10
-transformed PAH metabolite levels were
first adjusted for age, sex, race/ethnicity, education level,
and PIR. We then further adjusted for self-reported
dietary grilled/broiled meat, a known source of PAH
exposure (2). Because urinary PAH metabolites were
measured in a spot urine sample, and thus influenced by
factors such as fluid intake, perspiration, and glomerular
filtration rate (35), we added urinary creatinine to each
final model to adjust for individual differences in urine
concentration (36). We also assessed other potential
confounding by current occupation, BMI, alcohol use,
and levels of physical activity by adding them one at a
time to multivariable models. No noticeable changes
were observed (data not shown) and these additional
variables were not included in our final models.

sample of the U.S. population z6 years of age are
presented in Table 1. PAH levels varied widely by
metabolite, with geometric means ranging from 2.3 ng/L
for 4-OHChr to 2,465.4 ng/L for 2-OHNap. For meta-
bolites of phenanthrene (4-OHPhe), fluoranthene
(3-OHFrt), benzo[a]pyrene (3-OHB[a]P), benz[a]anthra-
acene (1-OHB[a]A and 3-OHB[a]A), benzo[c]phenan-
nthrene (1-OHB[c]P, 2-OHB[c]P, and 3-OHB[c]P), and
chrysene (1-OHChr, 2-OHChr, 3-OHChr, 4-OHChr, and
6-OHChr), the levels were below the LOD in >20% of
the population. Therefore, these metabolites were not
considered in further analyses. For the other 10 PAH
metabolites, the proportion of detectable values ranged
from 83.9% for 9-OHPhe to 100% for 2-OHNap.
Sociodemographic Determinants of Urinary PAH
Concentrations. Men had higher levels for all metabo-
lites (Fig. 1). Urinary PAH concentrations for almost all
metabolites varied somewhat by age, with the highest
geometric means found in persons 20 to 39 years old.
By race/ethnicity, non-Hispanic Black participants had
higher levels of PAH exposure than non-Hispanic White
and Mexican American participants for most metabolites.
The geometric means of most PAH metabolites were
lower in participants with higher education level and
with higher PIRs (higher adjusted income).
After multivariable adjustment, urinary concentrations
of most PAH metabolites were comparable in men and
women, although 1-OHPhe and 2-OHNap concentra-
tions were significantly higher in women (Table 2). The
adjusted ratios of geometric means for most metabolites
were lower in participants 12 to 39 years of age with
respect to the youngest age group (6-11 years of age) for
most metabolites, except 2-OHPhe. Except for 1-OHNap,
3-OHFle, 1-OHPhe, 3-OHPhe, and 9-OHPhe, which were
significantly lower in Mexican Americans, and 1-OHPhe
and 9-OHPhe, which were lower in non-Hispanic Blacks
compared with non-Hispanic Whites, no major racial/
ethnic differences were observed. Inverse associations
between income (as measured by PIR) and education
levels with PAH metabolite concentrations remained
present for most isomers.
Grilled/Broiled Meat and Urinary PAH Concentra-
tions. After multivariable adjustment, self-reported
grilled/broiled meat consumption was associated
with increased concentrations of most PAH metabolites
(Table 2). For 3-OHPhe, 9-OHPhe, 1-OHNap, and
2-OHNap, the adjusted ratios of the geometric means
were statistically significant and increased by 18% to
37% compared with participants who did not report
eating grilled/broiled meat.
Exposure to Tobacco Smoke and Urinary PAH
Concentrations. Current smokers had higher urinary
PAH metabolite concentrations compared with non-
smokers for all metabolites (Fig. 1), but no substantial
differences were observed between nonsmokers and
former smokers. Urinary concentrations of PAH meta-
bolites also increased with increasing serum cotinine
levels. Levels of all isomers were highest in the active
tobacco smoke exposure group and lowest in partici-
pants not exposed to tobacco smoke. Participants
involuntarily exposed to tobacco smoke had intermediate
concentrations (Fig. 1).

After multivariable adjustment, tobacco smoke expo-
sure status remained strongly associated with urinary
concentrations of most isomers, showing a dose-response
trend (Table 2). For example, the ratios of geometric
means for 1-OHPyr in participants involuntarily and
actively exposed to tobacco smoke were 1.43-fold (95%
CI, 1.27-1.62) and 2.86-fold (95% CI, 2.45-3.35) greater,
respectively, compared with the unexposed group.
Ratios were similar for other isomers (Table 2; Fig. 1).
Adjusted R2 of full models accounted for 24% to 53% of
the observed variability of most PAH metabolite concen-
trations. The addition of tobacco smoke exposure status
to the final models explained approximately 3% to 24%
of the outcome variability, supporting the hypothesis
that tobacco smoke exposure was an important predictor
of PAH metabolite concentrations in urine.
Exposure to Tobacco Smoke and Urinary PAH
Concentrations by Sociodemographic Characteristics.
Increasing levels of exposure to tobacco smoke remained
consistently and strongly associated with increased urine
1-OHPyr concentrations among children >6 years,
adolescents, and adults (Table 3). For most subgroups,
the adjusted ratios of geometric means of 1-OHPyr
among participants involuntarily exposed to tobacco
smoke were f1.5 times higher compared with unex-
posed groups. The corresponding adjusted ratios for
active smokers compared with unexposed were 2.4 to
3 times higher. Similar patterns were observed in
subgroups defined by sex, race/ethnicity, education,
poverty level, and self-reported dietary grilled/broiled
meat. Similar findings by sociodemographic character-
istics were observed for the association of tobacco smoke
with other PAH metabolites (data not shown).
Discussion
Summary of Findings. In a representative sample of
the U.S. population, children and adults involuntarily
and actively exposed to tobacco smoke had higher
concentrations of PAH metabolites in urine compared
with those not exposed. The association persisted after
adjustment for other determinants of PAH exposure,
including age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, income,
and broiled/grilled meat consumption. A consistent
dose-response relationship was observed between recent
levels of tobacco smoke exposure (active/involuntary/
unexposed) and by cotinine levels with almost every
metabolite. No differences in PAH levels were observed
between never and former smokers, supporting the view
that urinary PAH metabolites reflect recent and ongoing
exposure to tobacco smoke, including involuntary
exposure, but not past or cumulative exposure.
PAH Exposure--Comparison with Other Countries.
Urinary monohydroxylated PAH metabolite concentra-
tions obtained in our study were similar to those
previously reported for the 1999-2000 NHANES popula-
tion (37) but generally lower than concentrations in
selected nonoccupationally exposed populations in
Canada (38), Germany (39), Sweden (40), and the
Netherlands (11). Urinary PAH concentrations in this

U.S. sample were also much lower than in populations in
China, where the average ambient air levels of PAH
in urban areas are much higher (116 ng/m3; ref. 41)
compared with average PAH levels in ambient air
in urban and rural areas of the United States (0.15-
19.3 ng/m3 and 0.02-1.2 ng/m3, respectively; refs. 42, 43).
Differences in target populations and in the method-
ology used in different studies, including differences in
analytic techniques, make comparisons across studies
difficult (37). Whereas most studies have measured
PAHs in selective occupationally exposed individuals
or in individuals living in areas with significant
environmental sources of PAH, NHANES is a nationally
representative sample of the U.S. general population. In
the United States, levels of PAH concentrations in the
ambient air are generally low and food and tobacco
smoke are likely to be the most significant sources of
PAH exposure. Given important recent reductions in
active smoking (44) and in involuntary exposure to
tobacco smoke at home and in public places in the United
States (45), it is possible that lower PAH metabolite
concentrations in the U.S. population also reflect lower
exposure to tobacco smoke compared with other
countries. Because this was the first time that PAH
metabolites were measured in the general U.S. popula-
tion, however, it is not possible to compare our findings
with previous times.
Tobacco Smoke Exposure. Urinary excretion of PAH
metabolites was increased in participants with involun-
tary and active tobacco smoke exposure by a factor of
1.1 to 1.4 and 1.5 to 6.9, respectively, compared with
unexposed participants. The contribution of active
cigarette smoking to PAH exposure is well established.
Multiple studies have consistently reported 1-OHPyr
concentrations in urine to be 1.5 to 3 times higher among
current smokers compared with nonsmokers (18, 20, 39,
46, 47). Although less frequently studied, similar trends
have been observed for other monohydroxylated PAH
metabolites, such as 2-OHFle (48), 1-OHPhe, 2-OHPhe,
3-OHPhe, 4-OHPhe, and 9-OHPhe (39, 49), 3-OHB[a]P
(20), and 1-OHNap and 2-OHNap (48, 50).
A limited number of studies have evaluated the effect
of involuntary tobacco smoke exposure on PAH bio-
markers (11, 22, 49, 50), with some detecting a positive
association with urinary 1-OHPyr (52, 53) and with
PAH-albumin adducts (22). Merlo et al. (52) estimated
that the contribution of involuntary tobacco smoke
exposure to 1-OHPyr urinary excretion would be similar
to exposure among police officers working in a traffic
setting. In addition, consistent with our findings in
children, Tsai et al. (53) reported an average 9.6%
increase in urinary 1-OHPyr in preschool children per
one cigarette smoked by the child's father. The higher
concentrations of urinary PAH metabolites in non-
smokers who are involuntary exposed to tobacco smoke
compared with unexposed can be related to high PAH
levels in the sidestream fraction of tobacco smoke, the
main fraction to which nonsmokers are exposed (54-56).
In a controlled atmosphere experiment, high concen-
trations of several PAH compounds were measured in
aged and diluted sidestream tobacco smoke particles
(57). Increased levels of multiple PAH compounds have
also been reported in field studies comparing smoking
with control environments (58). In the present study, the
statistically significant differences in PAH metabolites
between involuntarily exposed and unexposed partic-
ipants were observed for 1-OHPyr, 2-OHFle, 3-OHFle,
9-OHFle, 1-OHPhe, 2-OHPhe, and 3-OHPhe, but not for
9-OHPhe or 1-OHNap and 2-OHNap isomers, suggest-
ing that involuntary tobacco smoke exposure could be
a relevant source for these PAH metabolites. Overall,
the higher concentrations of PAH metabolites in the
urine of nonsmokers involuntarily exposed to tobacco
smoke compared with the urine of unexposed non-
smokers suggest that inhalation of tobacco smoke­
contaminated air contributes significantly to PAH excre-
tions in urine.
Grilled/Broiled Meat Consumption. Diets that are
rich in PAHs are recognized as one of the most important
sources of PAH exposure for nonoccupationally exposed
nonsmokers (17, 59). Several studies have reported
elevated urinary PAH biomarkers, particularly 1-OHPyr,
with consumption of foods that are rich in PAH, such
as those cooked by open-flame methods. In a controlled
experimental study of 21 nonoccupationally PAH-
exposed volunteers, urinary levels of 1-OHPyr increased
after consuming 170 g/d barbecued hamburgers for
5 days compared with baseline (17). Similarly, urinary
excretion of 1-OHPyr glucuronide increased 10- to
80-fold following the ingestion of broiled beef (60).
Compared with a control group, exposure to dietary
PAH from charcoal-grilled meat resulted in a 4- to 12-
fold increase of 1-OHPyr level in urine (61). However,
few studies have evaluated the effect of dietary PAH
exposure on other monohydroxylated metabolites,
although Hoepfner et al. (49) did observe a 2-fold
increase in urinary excretion of OHPhe in subjects with
a PAH-rich diet.
In the present study, we found only a weak association
between reported consumption of grilled/broiled meat
in the past 24 hours and 1-OHPyr levels in urine,
possibly related to incomplete assessment of all relevant
food items and cooking methods. It is important to note
that grilled/broiled meats contribute less than half
the PAHs consumed through dietary sources (12). The
associations, however, were stronger for 3-OHPhe,
9-OHPhe, 1-OHNap, and 2-OHNap, even after adjusting
for smoking and other confounding factors, suggesting
that these metabolites, rather than 1-OHPyr, may be
relevant biomarkers for monitoring low-level PAH
exposure related to intake of PAHs from foods.
The observed variability in the relationship of grilled/
broiled meat consumption across individual PAH
metabolites in urine may be explained by interindividual
variation in doses and bioavailability of ingested PAHs,
and possibly by interindividual variation in genetic
polymorphisms that encode enzymes involved in PAH
biotransformation as suggested by Rihs et al. (60, 62-65).
Alternatively, the induction of metabolizing enzymes
through chronic exposure could lead to differential
metabolism of individual PAHs. Active smokers may
metabolize ingested PAHs differently from unexposed
individuals (66).
Other Sociodemographic Determinants. In our
study, age and household income level, and to a lesser
extent race/ethnicity and education attainment, were
significant determinants of urinary excretion of PAH

metabolites. The influence of age and race/ethnicity on
PAH metabolite levels has not been extensively studied.
The inverse association between low income and
education levels with urinary excretion for most PAH
metabolites after adjustment for tobacco exposure may
reflect additional sources of PAH exposure, either inside
or outside the home.
Strengths and Limitations. Important strengths add to
the relevance of the study findings. First, this is a large
study, multiethnic, and representative of the general
U.S. population z6 years old. Second, we were able to
evaluate multiple PAH metabolites in urine. Urine PAH
levels integrate several sources of exposure and are
considered validated markers, even at low levels. Third,
involuntary exposure to tobacco smoke was defined by
combining serum cotinine levels and self-reported
measures of smoking status, thus reducing the likelihood
of smoking status misclassification. Other strengths of
this study include the ability to control for several
relevant covariates, including dietary factors, the consis-
tency of the findings by participant characteristics, and
the high quality measures and procedures used by
NHANES.
Several limitations must be considered. First, although
we used a commonly used cutoff for cotinine (z10 ng/mL;
refs. 28, 45) to classify active versus involuntary smoke
exposure, it is possible that some infrequent smokers
who denied smoking remained classified as involuntarily
exposed. Conducting sensitivity analyses using 5 ng/mL
as a cutoff, however, did not substantially affect the
study findings. Second, although PAH concentrations in
food can vary depending on type of meat, method of
preparation, cooking temperature, and fuel sources (67),
NHANES dietary data were limited, thus restricting our
ability to estimate and control for those aspects related
to PAH content in food items. This might have affected
our analysis of the association between grilled or broiled
meat and PAH levels. It is unlikely to have confounded
the relationship between tobacco exposure and PAH
metabolites, however, because our findings were consis-
tent according to participant characteristics such as
differences in gender, ethnicity, education level, and
age, including young children. Third, the possibility of
reporting bias with regard to smoking status could not
be ruled out. Current smokers who had not recently
smoked a cigarette may have been classified as a
nonsmoker if they incorrectly reported their smoking
history. Similarly, nonsmokers with extreme levels of
environmental tobacco exposure and consequent high
levels of cotinine, such as those working in smoky
environments, may have been classified as smokers.
Although our study included subjects as young as
6 years, infants and preschool children were not
evaluated because PAH measures were not available in
NHANES data for children <6 years of age. Thus, we
were unable to address the implications of involuntary
smoke exposure for this important group. Other poten-
tial limitations include the cross-sectional design of
NHANES, uncontrolled confounding, and potential
biases resulting from nonparticipation and response
error.
Conclusions. This study supports the hypothesis that
involuntary and active tobacco smoke exposure is
associated with urinary levels of several PAH metabo-
lites. The clear dose-response relationship between levels
of tobacco smoke exposure and elevated urinary concen-
trations of 1-OHPyr, 2-OHFle, 3-OHFle, 9-OHFle,
1-OHPhe, 2-OHPhe, and 3-OHPhe suggests that envi-
ronmental tobacco smoke is a source of PAH exposure.
The finding of involuntary exposure to tobacco smoke
as a relevant source of mutagenic and carcinogenic PAH
compounds underscores the public health relevance of
this study and the need for public health and medical
professionals to continue policy and educational efforts
to minimize active and involuntary tobacco smoke
exposure.
