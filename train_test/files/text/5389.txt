Abstract. The purpose of this essay is to provide the reader with a brief overview of several
recent person-artifact-context relational models that explain the complex interaction of the processes
that underlie an ongoing aesthetic experience with visual art forms. Recent progress towards a
comprehensive understanding of these processes has been made possible in large part by experi-
mental approaches that take advantage of recent advances in computer technology and electronic
sophistication. To illustrate this point, three experimental techniques at the forefront of the field of
experimental aesthetics are highlighted here. They include the investigation of viewers' body postural
adjustments to depicted pictorial depth and movement in paintings; the use of hand-held computers
known as personal data assistants to record audience members' on-going emotional reactions to live
performances of dance; and the contribution of audio tour information to museum visitors' interaction
with and aesthetic evaluation of sculptures and paintings. Finally, the eMotion: Mapping Museum
Experience project, which has the potential to make a tremendous contribution to the understanding
of the complex interaction of factors that contribute to a museum visitor's experience, is described.
Keywords: experimental aesthetics, aesthetic experience, posturography, personal data assistants, audio-
augmented guided museum tours.
1 Introduction
Theoreticians and researchers working in the field of experimental aesthetics have in the
last decade emphasized that the sensory, perceptual, and cognitive processes that underlie an
aesthetic experience with visual art are driven by a complex interaction among characteristics
of the art object, the viewer, and the physical, social, and historical contexts in which the
experience takes place. Progress towards a full understanding of the nature of an encounter
with art, therefore, depends on deepening our understanding of the complex interplay
among these factors and processes. However, given the many factors known to contribute
to the cognitive and emotional reactions to an artwork, one might assume that it would
be very difficult, if not impossible, for science to subject aesthetic phenomena to rigorous
experimental scrutiny and identify the underlying interactive processes involved. But, in
fact, researchers in the field of experimental aesthetics have in recent years begun to make
tremendous strides in doing just that due in large part to the application in aesthetic science
of recent advances in computer technology and electronics. Neuroimaging techniques
and other psychophysical methods have also provided insights into biology's interactive
contribution to an aesthetic experience. This extensive body of knowledge has been used
by theoreticians to create comprehensive information-processing stage models of aesthetic
processing as well as frameworks describing the important variables that influence a viewer's
interaction with art.
The purpose of this essay is to provide the reader with a brief overview of some of
these recent person-artifact relational models. Additionally, I highlight three experimental
techniques at the forefront of the field of experimental aesthetics to illustrate how contem-
porary aesthetic science is contributing to an evaluation, clarification, and extension of these
frameworks. They include the investigation of viewers' body postural adjustments to depicted
movement in paintings, the use of hand-held computers known as personal data assistants
to record audience members' on-going emotional reactions to live performances of dance,

and the contribution of audio tour information to museum visitors' interaction with and
aesthetic evaluation of sculptures and paintings. This article is a very truncated version of a
much more detailed account of the state of the art of contemporary experimental aesthetics,
including models, experimental techniques, and findings, published in two chapters by this
author (Locher in press­a, in press­b).
2 Contemporary models accounting for aesthetic experience with visual art forms
Conceptual models and frameworks that have appeared in the literature to explain
aesthetic judgment and appreciation of visual art tend to focus on either the factors
that influence aesthetic experience or the underlying neural, perceptual, and cognitive
processes involved in such an experience. Jacobsen (2006) has proposed a framework for
the psychological study of aesthetic processing of artworks that consists of seven multilevel
and highly interrelated factors that should be investigated when studying the nature of
an aesthetic experience. These factors, which have been identified by a long history of
experimental research, include: (1) the Body or biology's contribution to our understanding
of aesthetics revealed chiefly by recent advances in cognitive neuroscience; (2) the structural
qualities, or Content, of the artifact; (3) the Person's individual processing characteristics
and preferences; (4) the time and place at which an aesthetic experience occurs, that is, the
Situation; (5) changes in aesthetic behavior over time (Diachronia) from the perspective
of evolutionary biology and cultural and ontogenetic development; (6) the vantage point
of comparisons within a given time segment (Ipsichronia) with focus on social processes,
cultures, and sub-cultures; and (7) the Mind as represented by contemporary psychological
theories and models accounting for aesthetic experience with art. Of course, no one study can
incorporate all of these factors into its research design, and many investigations including
different combinations of the various factors are needed before a comprehensive explanation
of how an aesthetic experience with a certain type of artifact can be achieved.
Bacci (2011) has recently written that the aesthetic object that one contemplates as an
observer is the result of the complex interaction of many of the same factors included in
Jacobsen's (2006) framework. She suggests that because of this complexity, it may in fact be
virtually impossible to fully evaluate the behavior and aesthetic reaction of an observer in
front of original art in a museum or an electronic or paper reproduction of it in a setting
such as a research laboratory. One key reason for this according to Bacci is that the viewer
of an artwork lacks a "period eye". This concept, introduced by the art historian Michael
Baxandall (1972), asserts that people living within a certain historical time and culture share
ways of thinking that influence how they perceive, understand, and respond to visual images,
including art. Thus, Bacci asserts that we can be certain that the cognitive mechanisms of
Rembrandt's contemporaries, to take one artist as an example, triggered by the perception of
one of his paintings functioned in a significantly different way when compared with museum
visitors looking at this work today. With respect to viewers interacting with art created
in the modern period for which they have a period eye, a considerable body of research
demonstrates that yet another similar factor, which might be called an "aesthetically fluent
eye," influences the way viewers experience art produced during their lifetimes. Aesthetic
fluency, a concept introduced by Smith and Smith (2006), is defined as the knowledge base
that a person has about art and aspects of life closely related to art that has been acquired both
formally (ie, through training in the arts) and through life experiences with art. Additionally,
Bacci points out that researchers, for the most part, don't have art historical background
information for the artworks they use as stimuli. These include such issues as an artist's
intentions for creating a work and his intended message. Nor do they have the original
Contemporary experimental aesthetics 699
viewing conditions for an original artwork such as its final placement, lighting conditions,
and distance from the observer.
Most of these and other limitations to the acquisition of valid findings in the field of
experimental aesthetics outlined by Bacci, especially those related to art historical issues,
have been addressed by the new and very innovative Parallellepipeda project describe by
Wagemans (2011) elsewhere in this special issue. Experiments 3, 4, and 5 described in his pa-
per illustrate very nicely the primary goal of this new form of experimental aesthetics, namely,
collaboration between scientists and artists to generate research questions concerning the
nature of an aesthetic experience with art and the art stimuli, procedures, and methodologies
to implement their studies. Wagemans points out that this approach produces results that
do full justice to the artworks used as stimuli and the artist's intentions for creating these
works using traditional scientific methods of enquiry. While Bacci may still be right that it is
impossible to fully evaluate the behavior and aesthetic reaction of an observer to art, the new
experimental aesthetics typified by the Parallellepipeda project, and also by the eMotion:
Mapping Museum Experience research project described below, will certainly bring us closer
to a comprehensive understanding of the nature of an experience with art.
Other models of aesthetic experience focus on the underlying mechanisms responsible
for aesthetic appreciation while taking into account the role of the factors that influence the
interplay of these mechanisms. Leder et al (2004) have published a detailed multicomponent
information-processing model that describes the interactions between a sequence of five
perceptual and cognitive processing stages that occur across the time course of a viewer's
encounter with abstract art. The model also incorporates the influence on these processes of
several variables involved in aesthetic experience, including the affective state of an observer;
observer characteristics such as personal taste, interests, and domain specific knowledge;
and the museum as context. The two outputs of the model are aesthetic emotions and
aesthetic judgments.
Some of the same frameworks used to explain an observer's experience with art have
been applied formally to a user's interaction with and emotional reaction to a design product
(see, eg, Norman 2004). Recently, however, the rise in development of interactive electronic
products has been accompanied in the design field by a growing interest in the aesthetics
of interactive systems--and not just of the appearance of artifacts, the traditional focus of
the aesthetics of design. According to this view, the aesthetics of an artifact emerge out of
a dynamic interaction between the user of an interactive product and the product and is
an integral part of what has been labeled an aesthetic interaction. Recently, Locher et al
(2010) published a theoretical information-processing framework for understanding the
nature of a user's aesthetic interaction with design products that incorporates factors that
moderate the processes that underlie an aesthetic experience with art described above.
Additionally, because interaction with a product involves the simultaneous use of visual and
haptic (exploratory touch) perception, the framework explains how handling an object can
add to the perception and aesthetic evaluation of an artifact beyond vision's contribution.
(Auditory qualities of many artifacts also contribute to the aesthetics of a multisensory
interaction, but this modality is not incorporated in the model.) Thus, the notion of aesthetic
interaction and the research studies it has generated that use the same techniques employed
in the field of experimental aesthetics (see, eg, Frens 2006) deserve mention in this essay
because they are expanding the understanding of the nature of an aesthetic experience with
artifacts beyond art forms.

3 Studying the multifaceted processes underlying aesthetic experience
A primary goal of investigators working in the field of experimental aesthetics is to
understand the components and underlying mechanisms responsible for aesthetic apprecia-
tion. This is achieved using empirical approaches and techniques that generate continuous
response data across the time course of an encounter with art. The study of an observer's eye
fixation patterns as he or she looks at and responds to an artwork has provided this type of
data for many years, starting with the pioneering work in this field conducted by Guy Thomas
Buswell (1935), which he described in his book How People Look at Pictures. Eye movement
studies continue to make substantial contributions to the understanding of how viewers look
at and respond to art (eg, Heidenreih and Turano 2011; Kapoula et al 2009; Locher et al 2007).
Neuroimaging techniques have been shown in recent years to be important tools in every
area of the arts to help localize and connect the components of an aesthetic process with
specific events in the brain (see reviews of this literature by Skov and Vartanian 2008 and
Shimamura and Palmer in press). They have opened up a window into biology's contribution
to aesthetics, and some (eg, Tallis 2008) have argued that the future understanding of
aesthetics is to be found in neurology. Massey (2009) cautions, however, that neuroscience is
more effective in the analysis of component processes than in their synthesis--that is, neural
data can reveal the components of an aesthetic experience, but they are much less successful
in understanding how these components interact to produce an aesthetic experience or why
one artwork is perceived to be more beautiful than another.
3.1 Measuring viewers' reactions to art using computerized dynamic posturography
In addition to neuroimaging techniques, computerized dynamic posturography is a tech-
nique with great untapped potential to measure physiologically a viewer's reaction to art
during an aesthetic experience. This is a non-invasive system that quantifies and records
body sway in real time originally developed for use in the diagnosis of balance disorders
and in physical therapy and postural re-education. The body is not perfectly still when
one is looking at an object or some aspect of the visual world. Rather, continuous postural
adjustments are made that involve the dynamic coupling of sensory, motor, and cognitive
processes to control and maintain posture and balance. Time series data are recorded as a
viewer stands on an instrumented platform, or force plate, connected to sensitive detectors
that measure changes in the weight exerted on the surfaces of the two feet. Changes in
excursion of the center of pressure of the body, instantaneously adjusted for a person's height
and weight, distance from the source of stimulation, and base rate, are recorded in both the
anterior-posterior and medial-lateral directions. Speed of body sway and the pressure on the
soles of each foot are also recorded.
The study of postural adjustments to the structural elements and compositional organi-
zation of paintings can provide a physiological measure of a viewer's reactions temporally to
these pictorial characteristics and artistic universals. To date, however, only one published
investigation has tapped the potential of this technique for experimental aesthetics. Kapoula
et al (2011) conducted investigations into the effects of pictorial depth in paintings on body
sway. In one study participants freely explored two reproductions of abstract paintings by
Maria Elena Vieira Da Silva (Egypt and O Quarto Cinzento), each of which provides a vivid
perception of recessed space as well as an altered cubist transformation of each work that
removed the sense of depth seen in the originals. Throughout the experiment participants
were required to maintain a quiet, constant stance by holding their arms at their sides and
refraining from speaking, clenching their teeth, or making body movements of any kind. It
was found that viewing the original paintings significantly increased postural sway relative to
their manipulated cubist versions: that is, greater sway was recorded for the works containing
the greater intensity of visual depth cues--the originals. In a second experiment Kapoula et
Contemporary experimental aesthetics 701
al found a significantly greater increase in body sway when observers were asked to fixate
the principal background area versus the foreground of Piero della Francesca's painting the
Annunciatio, a work whose structural organization provides a powerful representation of
perspective and a sense of recessed space in the pictorial field. Thus, pictorial depth cues in
both abstract and representational paintings differentially produce postural instability in
viewers.
To follow up on this line of research Professor Kapoula and I have recently conducted
an investigation of the effects of another compositional property of paintings--depicted
pictorial movement--on viewers' postural body movements. If any compositional feature
of a painting should produce postural sway, it most likely would be depicted movement.
Many methods are used to achieve movement in a painting and give it a sense of kinetic or
dynamic energy. These range from the global properties of a composition, such as the scene
or event it represents, to the lively character and direction of brush strokes employed (Cutting
2002). Our art stimuli consisted of two paintings by Monet entitled in English Study of a
Figure Outdoors--Facing Left and Study of a Figure Outdoors--Facing Right. They differ in
degree of depicted motion produced by the force of the wind but are very similar in content,
composition, color, and image size. In both paintings a woman, who is the primary feature
of interest in both works, is standing at the top of a grassy knoll and the wind is depicted as
blowing from right to left as indicated by the pictorial cues for perceived movement generated
by the clouds, the woman's scarf and dress, and vegetation. Each painting was shown in
its original orientation and as a mirror-image reversal of it to examine the influence of the
lateral organization of implied motion cues which has been shown to influence aesthetic
preference of paintings.
Participants' body movements were recorded as they viewed an artwork shown in one of
the four painting by lateral orientation conditions. They performed an attention-demanding
task that consisted of examining the painting for as long as they wished to obtain the informa-
tion needed to describe it to someone who had never seen it. The apparatus, procedure, and
type of data collected were the same as those employed by Kapoula et al (2011). Additionally,
participants rated the degree of depicted movement on a 10-point scale after viewing the
painting and described its content, which was recorded. Preliminary analyses of the body
movement data revealed that, as expected, body postural adjustments were significantly
more pronounced for the composition containing a higher degree of depicted motion. It was
also observed that participants' body weight was distributed differently across the two feet
when viewing the original versus its mirror-image. A manuscript describing the complete set
of results is under preparation for publication in a separate paper.
Results of the two studies demonstrate that posturography can provide insights into
the effects of the applications of fundamental principles of pictorial composition, such as
the use of depth and depicted motion cues as in the studies described, on the perceived
qualities of artworks as measured by their physiological effects on a viewer. In so doing,
they demonstrate that viewers can be figuratively "moved" by an artwork. In addition,
these findings provide physiological support for the notion of "offline embodied cognition".
There are several theories of the nature of embodied cognition (see Wilson [2002] for a
review of these theories), but the underlying notion is that cognition relies heavily on
bodily states--that is, cognitive representations and operations are intimately tied to the
relevant sensory-motor processes required to interact with the environment. Cognitive
activity that operates directly on real world environments with objects present is called
"online embodiment". "Offline embodiment" occurs when processing is decoupled from
the environment, as when modality-specific systems are engaged even when an object or
situation is absent and represented by a symbol such as a picture, as was the case for the
702 P Locher
paintings used in these studies. Finally, in future experiments we will simultaneously record
continuous data of viewers' body movements and their eye movements as they look at a
painting, thereby making it possible to determine with a high degree of spatial resolution the
impact of specific pictorial features and the overall structural organization of an artwork on
body sway across an aesthetic experience with it.
3.2 Hand-held personal data assistants
Individuals' responses to the temporally unfolding arts such as dance, theater, and especially
music have received research interest for many decades. Most often, perceivers' perceptual,
cognitive, and emotional reactions to these art forms were recorded in laboratory settings
as they viewed pre-recorded stimuli. Results obtained using this research approach, while
ensuring experimental rigor, do not capture viewers' continuous reactions to the art form in
the presence of other perceivers or audience members in the naturalistic setting of a theater.
An electronic technique to study real-time audience responses to temporally unfolding art
forms involves the use of hand-held personal data assistants or PDAs. Recent developments
in hand-held computers coupled with wireless technology enable a researcher to record
psychological responses from individual audience members viewing temporally unfolding
live artistic performances in naturalistic settings. PDAs now available are small, portable,
relatively inconspicuous, programmable, and make it possible for the data collected to be
collated and time-stamped for synchronization purposes with action on the stage. The
participants in such studies move a hand held pen-like stylus or a joystick around a screen to
generate input to the PDA as they view a performance.
One of the first studies to use this technique to study dance was conducted by Stevens
and her colleagues (2009). They developed a portable audience response facility, a modified
PDA system, to collect continuous response data from audience members during two
live performances of dance works. Their goal was to investigate audience perceptions of
structures and expressions in the dances and to compare these with the choreographer's
artistic intentions for the choreography for his work. Continuous responses were measured
in the first study from adults who had no experience in contemporary dance as they viewed a
60-minute live performance of a contemporary dance piece. Participants in the second study
were accustomed to attending live dance performances and reported enjoying watching
dance. They too viewed a full-length live ballet that varied in the amount of activity on stage
reflecting the themes struggle, achievement, reflectiveness, and loss.
Participants in both studies were given a practice session prior to the performance to
acquaint them with use of the system. It should be noted they reported that use of the PDA
did not distract them from the performance, and they found it very user-friendly, potential
drawbacks for use of such a system during live performances. The PDA recorded continuous
data simultaneously for two dimensions of expressed emotion as the performance took
place; a valence scale (positive­negative; happy­sad) and an arousal or activity scale (active­
passive). Participants were asked to rate their emotions based upon their experience of
the components of the entire performance, including the dancers' movements, the music,
and the choreography. The continuous arousal data were mapped onto choreographic
notes from the choreographers of the two ballets indicating the key moments and intended
structural, musical, and emotional changes in the pieces. Stevens et al (2009) present a
detailed comparison of the connection between these variables across the time course of
segments of the ballet. In general, the researchers found that approximately 80% of the
time, the choreographers' intentions with respect to the expressive aspects of the dance and
the audiences' emotional responses were congruent. For example, greater activity by the
dancers, such as acrobatics, and changes in musical material were associated with changes in
arousal and emotional responses, demonstrating a connection between audience emotional
Contemporary experimental aesthetics 703
responses and the surface features of the dance and music as well as the expressive aspects
of the dancers' movements. Thus, Stevens et al's findings enable choreographers, dancers
and researchers to see for the first time audience responses to dance works made in real
time during a live performance. The PDA is a tool capable of providing researchers and
choreographers a new perspective in understanding the cognitive and behavioral processes
during a temporally dependent visual art form.
4 The museum as laboratory
I turn now to a topic which I call the museum as laboratory and examples of the
application of recent advances in computers and other technologies in two museum studies.
Investigations of the perceptual and cognitive processes that underlie a museum visitor's
experience with art have until fairly recently been neglected by the fields of museology
and experimental aesthetics. Research conducted in museums using original artworks as
stimuli is essential to provide the external and ecological validity for findings of experimental
aesthetics studies, which typically present reproductions of art on computer screens and
other presentation formats in laboratory settings. In this respect it is notable, and a relatively
rare occurrence that the eye-movement studies conducted by Heidenreih and Turano
(2011) and Kapoula et al (2009) mentioned earlier took place in museums. From a practical
perspective, visitor-based investigations of the museum experience are critical because
in the last 10 years museum culture has made a major shift from its traditional roles of
collection and preservation of artifacts and of scholarship to museums as public educational
institutions. Yet, despite this shift, Jacobsen (2010) points out in an article entitled "A research
vision for museums" published in a recent issue of Curator: The Museum Journal that
audience researchers continue to focus their in-house investigations on such factors as
attendance numbers, visitor behaviors, and satisfaction with the permanent collection and
special exhibitions. For the most part they continue to neglect studying the underlying
perceptual-cognitive processes responsible for the pleasure which accompanies the learning
experiences in art museums. As one example, an issue which has been debated among
curators for decades is the amount and type of information which should be provided with
each artwork. To enhance the likelihood that museum goers will obtain the most pleasure
and knowledge from their visit, museums use several methods to provide them with insight,
history, anecdotal information, and provenance about the works in its collection. The most
commonly used methods to deliver information and interpretive content to enhance the
aesthetic experience include textural information presented with each artwork, guided tours
typically conducted by docents, and audio guide tours.
Research shows that most museum visitors like to have some organizing schematic
information presented with works of art by these methods but not to be overwhelmed with
information, and they also want freedom to interpret the art as they will. Furthermore, visitors
desire a balance between the physical organization and "mental" structure of a gallery or
exhibition and their freedom to explore the artworks according to their own organizing
schematic notions about the art. The impact of these factors changes according to the style
of a work of art viewed (eg, abstract versus representational works), the amount and type
of information presented, and the characteristics and aesthetic fluency of a viewer. In the
past, this complex interaction of factors could not be fully taken into consideration by a
museum using the audio systems available; until relatively recently, the audio experience
was structured for the "average visitor" in a linear, non-interactive fashion for a limited
number of artworks. Recent technological advances with hand-held computers have made
it possible for museums to organize audio guide augmented tours in such a way that they
provide visitors with personalized choices in the amount, types, and depth of information
704 P Locher
they receive about a work, as well as the freedom to navigate a collection of artworks as
they choose. Thus, audio tours have the potential to strike a balance between freedom and
structure in the visit of each museum goer.
4.1 Audio tour augmentation in museums
To date, there is relatively little empirical research on the contribution of audio augmentation
to the museum experience using the new electronic technology available for such tours. A
notable exception is one of a series of studies conducted by Jeffrey Smith and his colleagues
(Smith et al 2004; Smith and Tinio 2010) at the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York,
one of the world's foremost collections of 20th-century American art. This study examined
the impact of the museum's approach to providing audio tour information in a controlled
in-situ experiential fashion. Museum visitors completed a survey after experiencing one of
four art works (two sculptures and two paintings) under three treatment conditions. The
two paintings were George Bellow's Dempsey and Firpo and Arshile Gorky's The Artist and
His Mother and the two sculptures were Chris Burden's America's Darker Moments and Yayoi
Kusama's Accumulation. Burden's work consists of five separate pieces that represent events
in American history (eg, events at Kent State and My Lai) using small metal sculptures. The
Kusama sculpture is a white chair that has been covered with dozen of phallic-shaped white
stuffed bags. The three treatment conditions were: standard (the museum's standard label
consisting of the work's title, artist, date, and acquisition information), label (a label written
expressly for the study to present typical art historical and stylistic information), and audio
(information specific to each work and its artist). Data for several dependent measures
evaluating participants' experiences with each artwork were obtained.
Smith and his colleagues (2004, 2010) report that participants spent up to three times
longer in front of works when using the audio tour than was the case for the other two
conditions. The researchers note that some of this difference can be attributed to difference
in the amount of information presented, especially between the standard and audio tour
conditions. Nevertheless, the important issue here is that use of the audio guide keeps the
observer's visual input focused on the work of art as opposed to diverting his or her attention
to read a label. Additionally, it was found that participants said they would like to see more
of the works by a given artist when his work was experienced in the audio condition than
when it was seen in the standard condition. This was especially the case for the Kusama and
Burden sculptures, which are more difficult to understand than the paintings and probably
require more interpretive help to be appreciated. The specific information presented in
the audio guide for these works provided a cognitive schema or structure for looking at
and understanding these works. It should be noted that the Burden piece commanded
the longest stay in each of the three conditions, which the researchers suggest might be
attributable to the amount of information in the piece if a viewer treated it as five separate
works. Furthermore, visitors indicated that they enjoyed their visit much more because of
the audio tour, that they did not find it too impersonal, and they would use it again during
their next visit.
One negative influence of the audio guide approach was that it appears to focus attention
on only certain features and aspects of a work and away from others. Participants were
asked questions about some things that were not mentioned in the audio stop information.
For example, those who saw the Bellows work were asked about the color of the ceiling
in the painting. What was found was that with each of the four artworks, participants in
the standard and label conditions were better able to answer questions about the works
than people in the audio condition. Attention was directed toward certain aspects of a
work, and away from others, by the information provided in audio stop. Thus, too much
structure might not be optimal, at least in the present circumstances. Additional research is
Contemporary experimental aesthetics 705
necessary to identify the factors that must be taken into consideration to make audio guide
augmentation provide a more successful museum experience, especially as it continues to
advance rapidly from a technological perspective. From a practical perspective, it has the
potential to provide an experience tailored to each visitor--one that takes into consideration
his or her characteristics as well as the type of museum being visited (see Mastandrea et al
2009). From a theoretical perspective, studies of audio augmented tours can be designed to
provide insights into the nature of the perceptual-cognitive and evaluative processes that
underlie an aesthetic experience outlined in the frameworks mentioned above.
4.2 The eMuseum: Mapping museum experience
Finally, mention should be made about a project in progress called eMotion: Mapping
Museum Experience, which has already shown its potential to make a major contribution
to the understanding of the complex interaction of factors that contribute to a museum
visitor's experience (described in Tröndle and Tschacher [2010] and Tschacher et al [2011]
and http://www.mapping-museum-experience.com). The project, which uses innovative
technical devices (described below), is designed to examine how the museum context, the
art objects, curatorship, and the visitor affect his or her behavior and experiences. The large
transdisciplinary team conducting the research project at the Kunstmuseum St. Gallen in
Switzerland consists of collaborators with expertise in art psychology, art sociology, art theory,
museum visitor studies, curatorial practice, industrial design, and technical programming.
Visitors who volunteer to take part in the study are given a wrist band to wear that contains
several measurement and signalling sensors. These make possible the precise quantitative
measurement of the path each individual takes through the museum, his or her speed,
the time spent in front of each artwork, and when and how strong an emotional arousal
and a cognitive arousal occurred. Each person also completes qualitative questionnaires
designed to enable the transdisciplinary team of researchers to interpret the vast collection
of data obtained electronically. Another innovative feature implemented by the study is that
participants have the opportunity to view moments of their own course through the eMotion
installation played back through cartographic representation. This provides self-insight into
their behaviors and enables visitors to reflect on the nature of their museum experience.
This research group has recently published results of one study and a list of many other
manuscripts "in press" is contained in the project's website given above. Museum goers in
Tschacher et al's (2011) investigation wore electronic gloves through which their locomotion,
skin conductance, and heart rate were continuously monitored as they explored 76 works
of modern and contemporary art in seven galleries. After completing their visit the 373
adult volunteers completed a 19-item questionnaire for each of six works, three artworks
selected in advance by the researchers and three paintings in front of which a participant
spent the most time. Items in the questionnaire assessed emotions evoked by a painting,
aesthetic evaluation of it, and the viewer's general appraisal of it. Tschacher et al found that
physiological responses recorded during perception of an artwork were significantly related
to aesthetic-emotional experiences with a work. Specifically, the dimensions "aesthetic
quality," "dominance," "surprise/humor," and curatorial quality" were associated with the
cardiac measures heart-rate level and variability and skin conductance variability. The
researchers point out that their findings provide the first evidence that aesthetics can be
empirically grounded in viewers' physiology in an ecologically valid context, the fine art
museum.
5 Conclusion
There is strong agreement among theoreticians and researchers working in the field
of psychology of art that an aesthetic experience with a visual art form is the result of a
706 P Locher
complex interplay of many factors and processes. The new experimental aesthetics--to
borrow from the title of Berlyne's 1974 classic work--typified by the research techniques and
projects described in this essay have already shown their impressive potential to deepen
our understanding of the nature of aesthetic experiences and emotions with different visual
art forms within different contexts. Bacci (2011) may be correct in her assertion that it is
impossible to fully evaluate the behavior and aesthetic reaction of an observer in front of
original art in a museum, given the complex interplay of factors involved. But this author
believes that the state of the art of contemporary experimental aesthetics research will bring
the field very close to this goal.
