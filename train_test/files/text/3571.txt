Introduction
When people congregate to work across organizational
boundaries, how do relationships and trust develop among
them? Interorganizational groups are becoming more com-
mon in many work environments, from project management
to disaster response. In these cases, people having disparate
histories and identities need to work together, but they do not
necessarily share interpersonal relationships and the trust
that could foster cooperation. If the people entering an inter-
organizational environment do not trust their new colleagues
to provide timely and useful support, cooperation is unlikely
to occur. Therefore, we believe that it is important to under-
stand how preexisting social identities and emerging profes-
sional networks influence this particular aspect of trust
within interorganizational settings.
Trust in a colleague has been defined as the truster's will-
ingness to rely on the colleague, even when unable to moni-
tor or control the trustee (Mayer, Davis, & Schoorman, 1995;
Rousseau, Sitkin, Burt, & Camerer, 1998). Recognizing that
many facets of trust can be relevant in organizations, we
focus this study particularly on willingness to rely on another
person when a rapid response is needed. This aspect of trust
is especially important when interorganizational workforces
convene to address complex, dynamic situations, but it may
also affect day-to-day work flows in less-dynamic settings.
For example, Gilbert and Behnam (2013) argued that trust of
participants and other stakeholders is a key precondition to
collaboration in the United Nations Global Compact, a
Global Public Policy Network working in the areas of human
rights, labor standards, environmental protection, and
anticorruption.
Trust can impact cooperation (Kollock, 1994) and perfor-
mance (Dirks, 1999; Neves & Caetano, 2009), particularly in
knowledge-intensive settings (Lane, 1998). It also affects
teamwork (Peters & Karren, 2009) and information sharing
(Butler, 1999). As collaborative interorganizational networks
continue to grow in prevalence and significance (Currall &
Judge, 1995), the development of trust becomes increasingly
important (Song, 2009). Prior research suggests that trust can
be influenced by social identities and by social networks. In
this study, we attempt to determine the direct and interactive
effects of these crucial factors in the development of trust
between individuals. Our model bridges a somewhat surpris-
ing gap between social identity and networks theories and
trust research. These areas of inquiry offer considerable
insight regarding social forces that underlie development of
trust, and our study combines these insights into a cogent
model.

How Emergent Roles and Structures
Create Trust in Hastily Formed
Interorganizational Teams
Roxanne Zolin1 and Deborah E. Gibbons2
Abstract
Many activities, from disaster response to project management, require cooperation among people from multiple organizations
who initially lack interpersonal relationships and trust. On entering interorganizational settings, preexisting identities and
expectations, along with emergent social roles and structures, may all influence trust between colleagues. To sort out these
effects, we collected time-lagged data from three cohorts of military MBA students, representing 2,224 directed dyads,
shortly after they entered graduate school. Dyads who shared organizational identity, boundary-spanning roles, and similar
network positions (structural equivalence) were likely to have stronger professional ties and greater trust.

Drawing on social theories and trust research, we pro-
pose that a stream of interconnected social influences con-
currently shapes dyadic trust, and we attempt to discern
unique roles of social identities and social structures in cre-
ation of trust. By social identities, we mean people's self-
concepts as determined by their membership in salient
social groups (Turner, Oakes, Haslam, & McGarty, 1994).
By social structures, we mean connections among people
and the patterns that those connections form within a social
environment. Specifically, we propose a theoretical model
to explain how organizational identities, identity-based
expectations, emergent boundary-spanning roles, informal
professional ties, and structural equivalence in the profes-
sional network shape trust among colleagues in a multior-
ganizational setting. Our proposed model is depicted in
Figure 1.
To test our theoretical model, we collected time-lagged
data from three cohorts of military officers who were begin-
ning a full-time MBA program at a military university. In
this defense-oriented environment, people's social identities
are strongly linked to their membership in the Army, Navy,
Air Force, or Marines. All of the participants had prior lead-
ership experience within their own organizations, but in this
venue, members of these distinct organizations were sud-
denly required to work together on time-sensitive organiza-
tional analysis projects. This study used military identity,
willingness to rely on generic members of each organization
(Army, Navy, etc.), professional relations, and network
structures to predict dyadic trust a few weeks after the par-
ticipants' initial meeting. The research makes three contri-
butions to the theory of trust development in
interorganizational performance settings. First, we distin-
guish between the roles of organizational identities and per-
ceptions in development of professional ties and trust.
Second, we discern the roles of direct professional ties,
boundary-spanning activity, and structural equivalence in
creating trust. Finally, we sort out the direct and mediated
effects of the organizational and social factors as they impact
trust.
Formation of Interpersonal Trust
Interpersonal trust can be based on affect (positive feelings
toward another person), assessments of likely trustworthi-
ness (cognition-based trust; Frazier, Johnson, Gavin, Gooty,
& Snow, 2010; Lewis & Weigert, 1985; McAllister, 1995),
the context (McEvily, Perrone, & Zaheer, 2003; Rousseau et
al., 1998), the history of the relationship (Ferrin, Bligh, &
Kohles, 2007; Mayer et al., 1995; Nugent & Abolafia, 2006;
Zolin & Hinds, 2004), and even subliminal cues (Huang &
Murnighan, 2010). Social identities and networks provide
key foundations for trust (or distrust) as they shape percep-
tions and professional interactions.
Characteristic-based trust can result from perceived social
similarity or from beliefs about particular social groups.
Norms of obligation and cooperation based on social similar-
ity, such as shared organizational membership, may produce
trust (Zucker, 1986). Homophily--liking others whom we
see as similar to ourselves (McPherson, Smith-Lovin, &
Cook, 2001)--may indirectly build trust by fostering inter-
personal relationships that produce trust (Krackhardt, 1992).
Whether directly, through social identification, or indirectly
through relation-building, people tend to trust others who
share the same social categories as themselves (Kramer,
1999). In addition, people tend to develop generalized feel-
ings and expectations toward well-defined social groups,
such that these attitudes may affect trust toward individual
members of those groups. In the current study, we distin-
guish shared organizational identities from identity-based
expectations as sources of trust, with attention to the poten-
tial mediating role of interpersonal relationships.
Process-based trust arises through personal experiences
of repeated exchanges between people (Zucker, 1986). These
exchanges can create dyadic ties, emergent roles, and net-
work structures. For example, interactions that are required
by an organization's formal structure can lead to develop-
ment of informal professional networks (Brass, 1981).
Within the network, people have professional ties to some
colleagues, but they may develop more complex structural

similarities with others. For example, two unconnected peo-
ple may play similar social roles or occupy similar positions
within the network. These structural similarities could then
lead them to interact with each other. Through these social
processes, the outcomes of early trusting behavior affect sub-
sequent perceptions of coworkers (Mayer et al., 1995), and
trusting relations can develop. In the current study, we
approach process-based trust by examining the informal pro-
fessional network and its effects on the formation of dyadic
trust.
Interorganizational environments often bring together a
variety of people who lack knowledge of each others' histo-
ries and trustworthiness, but they usually do know which
organization each person belongs to. In this situation, organi-
zational identities and expectations are likely to influence the
development of professional relationships, and thereby affect
trust. At the same time, we suspect that boundary-spanners
who are given to relation-building outside their own identity
group (in this case, their organization) are more likely to
meet, appreciate each other, and to form dyadic ties that lead
to trust. As the professional network grows, people who
interact with many of the same others are also more likely to
develop interpersonal ties and trust. In the following pages,
we further explain our reasoning and formally hypothesize
relations between these social forces and trust.
Professional Ties, Structural Equivalence, and
Trust
Social networks grow as people enter a new environment,
begin to interact, and build relationships. Over time, profes-
sional relationships between coworkers accumulate and form
patterns of interconnected ties. People who interact with the
same coworkers become structurally equivalent--occupying
the same position within the social network. These two types
of relations, direct ties and structural equivalence, are often
related, but they have been shown to exercise distinct influ-
ences on many outcomes (Gibbons & Olk, 2003). Their
potentially discrepant roles in the development of trust, like-
wise, can and should be distinguished as fundamental contri-
butions to existing research.
As a professional relationship grows stronger, it is likely
to involve increasing trust in the partner. This process may be
iterative, such that a new professional relationship begins to
build trust, and growing trust increases the strength of the
professional relationship. Trust relationships are directed
(Ferrin et al., 2007), such that the perceptions held by Alice
about her relationship with Bob and her trust for him may
differ from Bob's perceptions of and trust toward Alice.
Through this directed relationship-forging and trust-building
process, we expect to find that the perceived strength of a
professional relationship with a colleague predicts the extent
of trust toward that colleague.
Hypothesis 1a: The perceived strength of a professional
tie to a colleague is positively associated with trust toward
that colleague.
As people begin to interact and develop connections, the
pattern of their relationships affects attitudes and behaviors.
For example, informal network position can contribute to a
dyad's ability to establish a positive trust climate (Williams,
2005), and the presence of many shared professional con-
tacts is likely to create a feeling of mutual belonging. When
two people are similarly related to many of the same col-
leagues, they are subject to many of the same social influ-
ences and information flows. This structural equivalence can
lead to the development of a direct tie as mutual contacts
serve to bring the two people together (Heider, 1958).
Structural equivalence may also provide an opportunity, dis-
tinct from a direct tie, to develop trust. Shared ties to third
parties have a positive effect on behavior within dyads, so
people who are connected to many of the same others might
expect reliable performance from each other (Ferrin, Dirks,
& Shah, 2006). This could be reinforced through third-party
policing and reputational effects. Several studies have shown
that connections among one's ties increase trust (e.g., Burt,
2005; Burt & Knez; 1995; Chua, Ingram, & Morris, 2008),
such that a dyad's embeddedness in a social network
increases the likelihood that the members will be willing to
rely on each other. Ferrin et al. (2006) attributed this to the
mediating effects of shared network ties on organizational
citizenship behaviors. The similarity of two people's posi-
tions in the professional network, then, may distinctly affect
trust toward each other, and we propose that structural equiv-
alence fosters direct professional ties while bolstering trust
between individuals.
Hypothesis 1b: Structural equivalence in the professional
network is positively related to the strength of the profes-
sional tie between colleagues.
Hypothesis 1c: Structural equivalence in the professional
network is positively related to trust between colleagues.
Social Identities, Perceptions, and Roles That
Build Professional Ties
People are attracted to each other based on common attitudes
and values, goals, and objectives (Newcomb, 1961). The
more activities people share, the more they will share infor-
mation and opinions, and develop stronger sentiments toward
each other (Homans, 1950). During this process, ideas about
one's contacts develop. Although formal organizational
structures can facilitate or even force the maintenance of pro-
fessional relationships (Zucker, Darby, Brewer, & Peng,
1996), homophily (McPherson et al., 2001; Reagans, 2005),
and instrumentality (Burt, 1992; Markovsky & Lawler,
1994) are likely to contribute to relation-building in
4 SAGE Open
interorganizational settings. In addition, we propose that
organizational boundary-spanners will tend to find each
other, develop professional ties, and build trust.
Shared organizational identity and the development of profes-
sional ties and trust. Membership in a particular organization
may create an identity that draws people together, and
impressions about other organizations may influence their
attitudes and behaviors toward others. Similarity between
persons often fosters supportive relations (Feld, 1982; Mars-
den, 1988), and people who see themselves as members of a
particular social group often prefer others who are members
of the same social group (Brewer & Kramer, 1986). Organi-
zational identity, including characteristics that members
believe are central, distinctive, and enduring (Dutton, Duke-
rich, & Harquail, 1994), serves to mediate how people think,
feel, and behave (Gecas, 1982). When viewed as a process of
self-definition and self-categorization, organizational iden-
tity can strengthen how individuals categorize themselves
within their organization (Ashforth & Mael, 1989). When
organization membership is very salient, as occurs in venues
that bring together known competitors, we can expect shared
membership to support the development of informal profes-
sional ties between people. The reverse may also be true--
we can expect fewer and weaker ties to form between
members of disparate organizations, even when the context
supports or demands equal interaction among individuals
regardless of organizational membership.
Shared organizational identities are also likely to increase
trust. We are more inclined to trust people who share the
same social categories as ourselves (Kramer, 1999). Thus,
attributions of trustworthiness can be based on shared orga-
nizational identities. Belonging to the same organization also
gives coworkers a shared organizational future, which can
create the shadow of the future (Axelrod, 1984). This means
that dyads who are likely to meet again in the future are
likely to trust each other more, because betrayal or benevo-
lence might be reciprocated at a later date. Hence, both
shared identity and future expectations support greater trust
between people from the same organization than between
people who identify with different organizations. Coming
from different organizations reduces the expectation of
future interactions and consequently reduces trust. For all of
these reasons, we anticipate that shared organizational iden-
tity will increase the strength of direct professional ties and
levels of trust between people in a multiorganizational
setting.
Hypothesis 2a: Shared organizational identity increases
the strength of professional ties between colleagues.
Hypothesis 2b: Shared organizational identity increases
trust between colleagues.
Preexisting opinions about organizations and the development of
professional ties and trust.
Opinions regarding social
collectives are often applied to members of those collectives
(Ashforth & Mael, 1989). For example, if two people differ
in their membership in a demographic group, each person's
beliefs about people from the other's group may shape their
expectations regarding each other. Stereotypes create both
positive and negative expectations about the behavior of oth-
ers (Kramer, 1999). As a result, in interorganizational set-
tings, relation-building and trust may be influenced by
organizational stereotypes. The belief that an organization is
competent is likely to increase the development of a profes-
sional tie with a member of that organization, and low evalu-
ations of an organization's competence are likely to reduce
relation-building and trust toward members of that organiza-
tion. In our study, we apply this to beliefs about various mili-
tary organizations (e.g., Navy, Army, etc.) and civilians, and
we propose that an individual's preexisting willingness to
rely on a particular organization will influence his or her
relation-building and trust toward specific members of that
organization.
Hypothesis 3a: Willingness to rely on particular organi-
zations is positively related to the strength of the profes-
sional ties that develop with colleagues from those
organizations.
Hypothesis 3b: Willingness to rely on particular organi-
zations is positively related to the level of trust that devel-
ops toward colleagues from those organizations.
Boundary-spanners and the development of professional ties and
trust.In multiorganizational settings, boundary-spanners--
people who build relationships with members of different
organizations--may play crucial integrating roles that bring
them together. Organizational boundary-spanning in practice
is a visible, and therefore salient, aspect of role performance
(Levina & Vaast, 2005). The role of a boundary-spanner has
long been recognized as a valuable activity in organizations
and teams (Keller, Holland, & Winford, 1975; Leifer & Del-
becq, 1978), and successful boundary-spanning can lead to
better team performance (Druskat & Wheeler, 2003). While
boundary-spanning roles are sometimes assigned, for exam-
ple, Purchasing Officer or Sales Representative, boundary-
spanning roles also emerge and develop in practice (Levina
& Vaast, 2005), because boundary-spanning activities are
more attractive to some than to others (Keller et al., 1975).
Because they naturally develop external relationships,
boundary-spanners from different organizations may be
more likely to connect with each other. In addition, homoph-
ily may increase the attraction between boundary-spanners if
they recognize their propensity for interorganizational ties as
an important similarity. Thus, we propose that two boundary-
spanning colleagues are more likely to initiate a direct pro-
fessional tie than if one of them was not a boundary-spanner.
For similar reasons, boundary-spanners may also be more
likely to trust each other as they recognize similarities in the
way they behave and interact. For example, their intrinsic
Zolin and Gibbons 5
openness to social interaction with people from different
organizations may lead them to trust each other more than
they would trust someone who maintains most of his or her
ties within one organization.
Hypothesis 4a: When two people are boundary-spanners
in the same interorganizational setting, they are more
likely to develop stronger professional relationships than
if they are not.
Hypothesis 4b: When two people are boundary-spanners
in the same interorganizational setting, they are more
likely to develop greater trust toward each other than if
they are not.
Mediation of Social Influences on Trust
As we have discussed, professional relationships may be
founded partially on social identities, expectations, and
roles. These social influences, while potentially affecting
trust directly, may be mediated or replaced over time by the
interpersonal relationships that they help to form. This
notion aligns with research showing that perceived risk is
related to trust early in a working relationship but not later,
when experience provides specific information about the
other person's behavior (Mayer et al., 1995; Zolin, Hinds,
Fruchter, & Levitt, 2004). Similarly, interorganizational
social identities, expectations, and roles may create general
impressions of trustworthiness, but their effects may be
channeled and adjusted through formation of professional
relationships. As Ben-Shalom, Lehrer, and Ben-Ari (2005)
found in their qualitative field study, early impressions
based on categorical information can foster interaction that
creates social structures that later develop trust. In an inter-
organizational environment, we expect to find that organiza-
tional identities, organizational expectations, and concurrent
boundary-spanning all create opportunities for interaction.
These opportunities create professional ties that, in turn,
support trust.
Hypothesis 5: The effects of organizational identities,
organizational expectations, and concurrent boundary-
spanning roles on trust are mediated by professional ties
between the truster and the trustee.
Method
The hypothesized relationships were tested at the dyadic
level in three cohorts of incoming master's students in a pro-
gram that is designed for experienced military officers.
Participants included 81 active duty military officers from
the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marines, plus two civilians
from government organizations. The military work context
and maturity of students make this population a better data
source for work-related studies than is available in many
university settings (Zolin, Fruchter, & Levitt, 2003). Nearly
all of the students had several years of work experience
between the time that they received their bachelor's degrees
and the time that they entered this program. Most of them
held highly responsible leadership positions, regularly over-
seeing others' work in routine and crisis environments, and
all had experienced the strong indoctrination that accompa-
nies membership in a military organization. Performance in
the MBA program would affect their ability to gain future
promotions, so development of effective working relation-
ships to support the successful completion of courses was
important.
This population is particularly appropriate for testing our
theoretical model because of participants' very clear, salient,
and comparable organizational identities. All of the students
had chosen long-term careers within their particular military
organizations, and military membership was immediately
recognized by everyone in the cohort because students
attended class in uniform every Tuesday. Alongside the
strong military identification, this population demonstrated a
generally high need for achievement that may not represent
the general population. All three of the cohorts in this study
included Air Force and Navy officers. Cohort 3 had no Army
members and Cohort 1 had no Marine officers. Professional
composition of the three cohorts appears in Table 1.
Data Collection Procedures
Individual and relational data were collected in three
Organizational Behavior classes with the primary purpose of
teaching students to analyze social networks. Each person's
willingness to rely on members from each military organiza-
tion (e.g., Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines) was measured
near the beginning of the course. Professional relationships
and dyadic trust were measured using a standard online net-
work survey in the sixth to seventh weeks. We also obtained
permission from the university's institutional review board
to use archival data from the courses for this study.
We controlled for nominal membership in the same proj-
ect team. Students formed project teams between the time of
the initial survey (about willingness to rely on members of
each military organization) and the time of the network sur-
vey. The project required students to analyze an organiza-
tion's environment, culture, structure, motivation system,

leadership, power and influence issues, and anticipated
threats and opportunities, then make theoretically sound rec-
ommendations for organization leaders. The warm-up
assignment was to select two similar organizations and com-
pare their cultures. Students accomplished this culture com-
parison during the 6 weeks of our study, and they knew that
they would later be required to work together on the in-depth
organizational analysis. It seems reasonable to expect that
participation in the culture comparison and anticipation of
the upcoming project created opportunities for interaction
that could foster professional ties and trust.
Measures of Shared Organizational Membership
and Reliance on Organization Members
Shared organizational membership. To measure shared orga-
nizational membership in a military service, we matched
individuals within each cohort according to their service
membership, creating binary matrices in which a 0 at the
junction of Alice's row and Bob's column indicates that they
have different membership and a 1 indicates that they have
the same membership.
Reliance on organization members.Willingness to rely on
members of a particular organization was measured by ask-
ing participants to "Imagine that you need to compose a
rapid response team" (a situation that is familiar to most
military officers), and then to rank each branch of military
service along with civilians in the order in which they would
choose to contact them. "Rely on organization" was con-
verted to dyadic matrices in which each cell contains the
ranking ascribed by the row person to the military service of
the column person.
Relationship Measures
All participants were asked to complete an online survey
about their relationships with others in their cohort in the
sixth or seventh week. This exercise was not graded, and
there was no penalty for noncompliance. Participants were
asked to select (from a list) the names of everyone from their
cohort whom they knew. For each person whom they knew,
they were asked to indicate the extent to which they had a
professional relationship with that person and the extent to
which they were willing to rely on that person. After comple-
tion of the survey, names were replaced with numbers.
Network studies differ from individual-level studies in
several regards. One difference is that we focus on the inten-
sity and pattern of ties within each type of relation. To do
this, we describe the relation types that we want to measure,
and we ask respondents to indicate the extent to which they
have each type of relation with each other person in the social
setting. It is customary when presenting lists of names to ask
respondents to skip names of people whom they do not know.
Our survey was conducted online, and respondents used
Likert-type scales to report the intensity of their professional
relations and willingness to rely on each person. Table 2
shows the instructions and format for the relationship
questions.
Professional ties. Working with the list of names that they had
chosen, participants used a 1 to 5 scale to indicate the extent
to which they had "a professional relationship with each of
the people" they had selected, as follows: 1 = minimal rela-
tionship, 3 = moderate relationship, 5 = extensive relation-
ship. All skipped names were coded as 0. When aggregated
for each cohort, these individual responses formed a matrix
of directed professional relationships, with values ranging
from 0 (no relationship) to 5. In keeping with standard net-
work measurement practices, this is a single-item measure.
Trust.Respondents also indicated beside each name how
willing they would be "to rely upon this person if a rapid
response was required" using a 1 to 7 rating scale in which
1 = not at all willing, and 7 = completely willing. These data
were recoded by subtracting 4 from each value, such that a

neutral response of 4 in the original scale became 0 in the
recoded scale, and below-neutral responses became nega-
tive. This allowed us to accurately code people whom the
respondent did not know with zeros to represent a neutral
attitude. When aggregated for each cohort, these individual
responses formed a matrix of directed reliance relationships,
with values ranging from -3 (unwilling to rely on this per-
son) through 0 (neutral) to 3 (completely willing to rely on
this person). In keeping with standard network measurement
practices, this is a single-item measure.
Both boundary-spanners.We measured boundary-spanning
across military services using UCINET 6 (Borgatti, Everett,
& Freeman, 2002). The routine that we selected (per Gould
& Fernandez, 1989) indicates the extent to which a person's
boundary-spanning activity falls below or above what would
be expected if group membership had no effect on interac-
tion patterns. Those whose boundary-spanning activity
exceeded the random expectation were coded with a 1, and
all others were coded with a 0. This level of boundary-span-
ning activity is meaningful because, as we will see below,
organizational membership had a strong positive effect on
the network, such that people were significantly more likely
to have in-group ties than cross-group ties. We created a
boundary-spanning matrix that includes a 1 at the intersec-
tion of two boundary-spanners, and otherwise a 0.
Results
We used chi-square tests to compare observed with random
distributions of ties among membership groups to determine
whether service membership influenced the pattern of ties
within each of the three cohorts. All of the hypothesized rela-
tionships were then tested using the quadratic assignment pro-
cedure (QAP) in UCINET 6 (Borgatti et al., 2002). QAP is a
nonparametric method for testing significance of correlation
between two matrices. The procedure constructs a reference
distribution of random parameters that could have been derived
from a data set with the same structure as the data set under
evaluation. Then the significance of correlation between matri-
ces is determined by comparison with the random distribution.
The nonparametric testing is important because network data
include autocorrelation among observations that biases ordi-
nary least squares (OLS) tests to the point that significance tests
are nearly useless (Krackhardt, 1988). QAPdoes not depend on
the assumption of nondependence that underlies standard cor-
relation and linear regression procedures.
Several QAP procedures have been developed for multi-
ple regression (MRQAP), including an approach that deals
particularly well with autocorrelation that occurs across the
rows (outgoing relations of each originating person) and col-
umns (incoming relations received by each person) of a net-
work matrix (Dekker, Krackhardt, & Snijders, 2007). We
used this procedure from the UCINET 6 analysis package to
test predicted effects on professional relations and trust.
Because the correlation between network variables and
nonnetwork variables is limited by the structure of the matri-
ces (Krackhardt, 1988), the key statistic in QAP correlations
and regressions is the p value, not the correlation value.
Some correlations that seem small may be highly significant,
and pairwise correlations of equal size may not be equally
significant.
Structural equivalence was calculated as the correlation of
the ties of each pair of people. Resulting values range from
-1 if two people's ties are exactly opposite to 1 if their ties
are identical.
To obtain a global test of our hypotheses, we converted
the matrices from all three cohorts into directed dyads. Each
cohort yielded N × (N - 1) dyads, which sum to 2,224
directed dyads. For each relation, we excerpted Alice's
observations of Bob and all other members of their cohort,
Bob's observations of Alice and all other members of their
cohort, and so on. To address the autocorrelation that natu-
rally occurs in network data, we used a fixed-effects regres-
sion with a component to control for individual idiosyncrasies
(Wooldridge, 2010) of the respondents across the observa-
tions of cohort members. The fixed-effects regressions were
intended as a second look at the data, to determine if we
would get similar results using an alternate analysis method.
While we did control for the within-respondent autocorrela-
tion that occurs because some people are more gregarious
than others, this method is not as robust against autocorrela-
tion as the MRQAP, so it should be viewed as a secondary
analysis.
Predicting Professional Ties and Trust in
Particular Colleagues
QAP correlations among dyadic variables for all three
cohorts appear in Table 3. Results of QAP regressions pre-
dicting willingness to rely on one's colleagues appear in
Table 4, and results of QAP regressions predicting profes-
sional ties appear in Table 5. Table 6 shows the means, stan-
dard deviations, and correlations among the directional-dyad
(full-sample) variables. The results of the fixed-effects
regressions using the directional-dyad (full-sample) vari-
ables are shown in Table 7.
Hypothesis 1a, that professional ties would have a posi-
tive relationship to trust, was supported in all three cohorts,
where we found that the stronger the professional relation-
ship, the greater was the willingness to rely on a colleague
(Table 4, Cohort 1:  = .649, p < .001; Cohort 2:  = .521,
p < .001; Cohort 3:  = .727, p < .001). This was confirmed
in the fixed-effects regressions (Table 7, Model 2,  = .55,
p < .001), thus supporting Hypothesis 1a.
Hypothesis 1b, that structural equivalence in the profes-
sional network is positively related to professional ties to a
colleague, was significant in all samples (Table 5, Cohort 1:
 = .221, p < .001; Cohort 2:  = .140, p < .001; Cohort 3:
 = .218, p < .001). This relationship was also significant in

the full-sample correlations and the fixed-effects regression
model (Table 6, r = .30, p < .001, Table 7, Model 4,  = 1.63,
p < .001), supporting Hypothesis 1b.
Hypothesis 1c, that structural equivalence in the profes-
sional network would positively relate to trust, was not sup-
ported. Structural equivalence was negatively related to trust
in one cohort (Table 4, Cohort 1:  = .006, ns; Cohort 2:  =
-.086, p < .05; Cohort 3:  = -.037, ns). This relationship
was not significant in the fixed-effects regression analysis
(Table 7, Model 2,  = -.16, ns).
Hypothesis 2a proposed a positive relationship between
shared organizational identity and professional ties. First, we
conducted a general test of the effects of organizational
membership on direct ties. In Cohort 1, chi-square tests indi-
cate that organization membership did not significantly
affect the pattern of professional ties (2 = 10.846, p = .493)
or trust (2 = 15.631, p = .293). This cohort was less balanced
than the others, having one large subgroup and three small
subgroups (see Table 1). In Cohorts 2 and 3, organization
membership did influence the patterns of professional ties
(Cohort 2: 2 = 47.319, p = .0001; Cohort 3: 2 = 32.627, p =
.005) and trust (Cohort 2: 2 = 60.924, p = .0001; Cohort 3:
2 = 21.496, p = .056). Professional ties were denser than
random within three of the four organizations represented in

Cohort 2. The Army people had low density of professional
ties with all groups except the Air Force members. Trust ties
in Cohort 2 were denser than random within two organiza-
tions, and there was a general trend to trust fewer than ran-
dom out-group members, except if they were from the Air
Force. Professional ties were denser than random among
members of two of the three organizations represented in
Cohort 3 (the lone civilian had no in-group). Trust ties in
Cohort 3 were also denser than random within all three
groups, but the pattern of ties to out-group members varied.
Hypothesis 2a was also supported by QAP regressions in
two out of three cohorts (see Table 5, Cohort 1:  = -.018, ns;
Cohort 2:  = .146, p < .001; Cohort 3:  = .073, p < .05).
This positive relationship between shared organizational
identity and professional ties was also significant in the
fixed-effects regression analysis (Table 7, Model 3,  = .32,
p < .001), and thus Hypothesis 2a was supported.
Hypothesis 2b, which proposed that shared organizational
identity will be positively related to trust, was only supported
in 1 of 3 cohorts (see Table 4, Cohort 1:  = .032, ns; Cohort
2:  = .153, p < .001; Cohort 3:  = .037, ns). The direction
of effects, however, was positive in all three cohorts, and the
fixed-effects regression model found overall support for this
relationship (Table 7,  = .26, p < .001).
Hypothesis 3a, that individuals' willingness to rely on
particular organizations would predict professional ties with
members of the groups, was not supported. We found a mar-
ginally significant relationship in one cohort (see Table 5,
Cohort 1:  = .079, ns; Cohort 2:  = -.051, p < .10; Cohort
3:  = -.024, ns), and the hypothesized relationship was not
significant in the fixed-effects regression model (Table 7,
Model 3,  = -.00, ns).
Hypothesis 3b, that willingness to rely on the organization
would predict trust toward members, was not supported in
any of the cohorts (see Table 4, Cohort 1:  = .092, ns; Cohort
2:  = -.002, ns; Cohort 3:  = -.006, ns). This relationship
was marginally significant in the fixed-effects model (Table
7, Model 1,  = .05, p < .10).
Hypothesis 4a proposed that concurrent boundary-span-
ning roles would be positively related to the strength of the
direct professional tie between colleagues. This relationship
was significant in all three cohorts (see Table 5, Cohort 1:
 = .219, p < .01; Cohort 2:  = .076, p < .05; Cohort 3:  =
.263, p < .001). It was also significant in the fixed-effects
model (Table 7, Model 3,  = .81, p < .001), thus supporting
Hypothesis 4a.
Hypothesis 4b proposed that when both are boundary-
spanners, there will be greater trust. This relationship was
significant in two of the three cohorts (see Table 4, Cohort 1:
 = .154, p < .05; Cohort 2:  = .068, ns; Cohort 3:  = .161,
p < .01). This was also significant in the fixed-effects model
(Table 7, Model 1,  = .36, p < .001), so Hypothesis 4b was
supported.
Hypothesis 5 proposed that the effects of shared organiza-
tional identities, organizational expectations, and concurrent
boundary-spanning on trust would be mediated by profes-
sional ties. Because organizational expectations were not
significantly related to trust (Hypothesis 3b), no mediation
analysis was conducted for that variable. Tests were con-
ducted, following Baron and Kenny (1996), to determine
whether professional ties mediated effects of shared organi-
zational identity and boundary-spanning on trust.
Shared organizational identity (see Table 6: r = .08, p <
.001) and professional ties (see Table 6: r = .65, p < .001)
were significantly related to trust. Shared organizational
identity and professional ties were significantly related to
each other (Table 6: r = .10, p < .001). Finally, when shared
organizational identity and professional ties were both
included in a model predicting trust, professional ties were
significant in predicting trust (Table 7, Model 2:  = .55, p <
.001), while shared organizational identity became nonsig-
nificant (Table 7, Model 2:  = .09, ns). This reduction in
effect of organizational identity on trust when professional
ties were included in the regression indicates that profes-
sional ties mediate the relationship between shared organiza-
tional identity and trust (Baron & Kenny, 1996).
Similarly, trust was significantly related to concurrent
boundary-spanning (see Table 6: r = .07, p < .001) and pro-
fessional ties (see Table 6: r = .65, p < .001), and concurrent
boundary-spanning and professional ties were significantly
related to each other (Table 6: r = .15, p < .001). When con-
current boundary-spanning and professional ties were both
combined in a model predicting trust, professional ties (Table
7, Model 2:  = .55, p < .001) were significant in predicting
trust, while concurrent boundary-spanning became nonsig-
nificant (Table 7, Model 2:  = -.07, ns). This reduction of
significance indicates that professional ties mediate the rela-
tionship between concurrent boundary-spanning and trust
(Baron & Kenny, 1996), such that people who are both
boundary-spanners are more likely to develop professional
ties to each other, and those professional ties lead them to
greater trust.

demonstrated distinct effects on trust. Professional ties had a
consistent, positive effect on trust in all cohorts and the over-
all analysis, but structural equivalence did not (see Table 8).
Rather, we found a negative relationship between structural
equivalence and trust, which was significant in one of the
three cohorts. Membership in the same organization was sig-
nificantly related to professional ties in two samples and in
the full-sample analysis. Shared organizational identity was
significantly related to trust in one cohort and supported in
the full-sample analysis, but the relationship was mediated
by professional ties. Willingness to rely on particular organi-
zations was not significantly related to professional ties or
trust. Concurrent boundary-spanning roles were significantly
related to professional ties in all three samples and the

full-sample analysis. Concurrent boundary-spanning was
also related to trust in two samples and in the full-sample
analysis, but this relationship was mediated by professional
ties. In summary, we found that shared organizational iden-
tity and concurrent boundary-spanning roles affect profes-
sional ties, which influence trust (see Figure 2).
Discussion
When people from multiple organizations are brought
together for a common purpose, individuals generally need
to build new professional relationships and identify others on
whom they can rely for timely and useful support. We have
asked how these professional and trusting relations develop
among unknown actors in such interorganizational settings.
Theory suggests that social identities, social expectations,
and emerging network structures will affect development of
trust. We found positive effects of shared organizational
identities and emergent boundary-spanning roles on trust,
mediated by the development of professional ties. The initial
social identities and emergent structural factors seem to
bring people together to form professional relationships,
which develop into trust. This result aligns with Zucker's
(1986) theory of process-based trust, as identity-based per-
ceptions, emergent roles, and shared professional networks
together built trust.
As expected, organizational identities, which are strong
among military people, resulted in greater relation-building
and trust among members of the same service. It was surpris-
ing, then, that willingness to rely on particular organizations
did not affect professional ties or trust. We know from work-
ing with military officers that opinions about the various
military services are often strong and stable over time. Why
would military service identities create in-group preferences,
while relative willingness to rely on the various services did
not transfer to people who were members of those services?
It is possible that working in an academic environment, the
respondents may have "given the benefit of the doubt" to
members of less-respected organizations, perhaps viewing
them as exceptions to the stereotypes. Alternatively, profes-
sional ties and trust may have arisen from positive affect
toward one's own group, without regard for more analytical
processes. This finding hints at the possibility that feelings,
not cognition, played the major role.
An interesting contribution of this study is that, despite
the clear relationship between direct professional ties and
structural equivalence, only the direct ties affected trust. The
apparent positive correlation between structural equivalence
and trust in all three cohorts disappeared completely when
the other variables were included in regressions predicting
trust. In fact, when controlling for direct ties, the relationship
between structural equivalence and trust was negative and
significant in one cohort, possibly indicating some suspicion
introduced to professional relationships by the structural
equivalence between participants. This aligns with Burt's
(1987, 1992) work on structural equivalence and competi-
tion, but it does not align with theories of social monitoring
as a guarantor of trustworthy behavior.
We began this study with three research goals. First, we
examined the roles of organizational identities and percep-
tions in the early development of professional ties and trust.
Second, we differentiated the roles of direct ties and struc-
tural equivalence in creating trust. Finally, we sorted out the
direct and mediating factors in trust-building in a multiorga-
nizational context. This research contributes to theories of
trust development by showing how the development of pro-
fessional ties mediates the effects of antecedent social identi-
ties and boundary-spanning roles on trust. The study
contributes to social network theory by showing that,
although structural equivalence is related to direct ties, it is
not necessarily related to trust. This implies that social moni-
toring and shared information flows that are available to
structurally equivalent colleagues are not as relevant for trust
development as are the short-term experience or budding
affect that may be present in the direct tie.
One managerial implication of these findings is that when
setting up a new interorganizational group, attention to the
development of professional ties will likely support the

development of trust. Organizational diversity could be even
more important than other forms of diversity in some interor-
ganizational contexts, so creation of new, shared identities
may be crucial for building a truly interorganizational pro-
fessional network. A less intuitive implication is that greater
recognition and encouragement should also be given to
emergent boundary-spanning activity. It is ironic that bound-
ary-spanners may trust each other more than other members
of their own organizations. It is also interesting that the
boundary-spanning roles in our study emerged spontane-
ously, leaving the possibility that individual attributes under-
lay both the boundary-spanning and the increased trust
between boundary-spanners.
Limitations of the Study and Future Research
This research was limited to the study of three cohorts of
military officers in an educational context. Although this
interorganizational environment was suitable as a data source
for the present study, additional research in other contexts
with civilian participants is needed to determine generaliz-
ability of the findings. Military organizations endeavor to
create strong social identities for their members, such that
the organization becomes a crucial part of members' self-
image. Because of this, participants in this study may have
been more likely than members of many other organizations
to evaluate people in terms of in-group and out-group sta-
tuses with regard to organizational membership. We expect
that the findings generalize to settings in which people iden-
tify strongly with their organizations, but the results could
differ among people who are not socially integrated into their
organizations.
Although we found a positive relationship between shared
organizational identity and trust, it was not significant in all
cohorts. Furthermore, we did not attempt to discern whether
shared identities built trust via homophily, the "Shadow of the
Future," or another mechanism. A greater focus on this pro-
cess in future research could expand our understanding of
identity-based trust. In addition, the discovery of greater tie-
building between boundary-spanners raises several interest-
ing questions. Do boundary-spanners develop ties with each
other because of homophily or propinquity, as we hypothe-
sized, or could there be some individual differences at play?
For example, a psychologist might argue that two people with
outgoing personalities are more likely to become boundary-
spanners and to meet each other than two people who are
more introverted. Our study did not distinguish between these
possibilities, and we defer the question to future research.
Finally, we believe that future studies could fruitfully investi-
gate how the factors that we have identified in early trust for-
mation continue to influence trust over the long term.
Conclusion
With a faster tempo in the formation of joint ventures and
multiorganization responses to disasters, leaders in
organizations need a greater understanding of factors that
develop professional ties and trust. Our study indicates that
dyads who share organizational identity, boundary-spanning
roles, and mutual professional contacts are more likely to
have a direct professional tie and greater trust. Despite the
positive relationship between direct professional ties and
structural equivalence, however, only the direct ties increased
trust. It appears, therefore, that the familiarity and the experi-
ence of a direct relationship, rather than the social control
intrinsic to structural equivalence, serve as a major catalyst
for trust. Greater attention should be paid to the development
of professional ties and the support for emergent boundary-
spanners in hastily formed teams, as these appear to be pre-
conditions for the development of trust between colleagues.
