Abstract
Troubled sleep is a commonly cited consequence of adolescent drug use, but it has rarely been studied as a cause. Nor have
there been any studies of the extent to which sleep behavior can spread in social networks from person to person to
person. Here we map the social networks of 8,349 adolescents in order to study how sleep behavior spreads, how drug use
behavior spreads, and how a friend's sleep behavior influences one's own drug use. We find clusters of poor sleep behavior
and drug use that extend up to four degrees of separation (to one's friends' friends' friends' friends) in the social network.
Prospective regression models show that being central in the network negatively influences future sleep outcomes, but not
vice versa. Moreover, if a friend sleeps #7 hours, it increases the likelihood a person sleeps #7 hours by 11%. If a friend uses
marijuana, it increases the likelihood of marijuana use by 110%. Finally, the likelihood that an individual uses drugs increases
by 19% when a friend sleeps #7 hours, and a mediation analysis shows that 20% of this effect results from the spread of
sleep behavior from one person to another. This is the first study to suggest that the spread of one behavior in social
networks influences the spread of another. The results indicate that interventions should focus on healthy sleep to prevent
drug use and targeting specific individuals may improve outcomes across the entire social network.

Introduction
In 2006, 15.7% of 8th-graders and 42.3% of 12th-graders had
tried marijuana at least once, and about 18% of 12th-graders were
current users in the United States [1]. Inability to sleep and
excessive sleepiness are often cited as primary warning signs and
symptoms of such teenage drug abuse [2]. The implication is that
drug abuse causes sleep problems. Indeed, in previous studies of
adolescent use of opioids [3], alcohol [4], and marijuana [5,6,7,8],
researchers have generally assumed that the causal direction is
from substance abuse to sleep problems.
Yet, one of the biggest adjustments affecting late adolescence is
the significant change in chronotype with the delay of the intrinsic
sleep phase [9]. Coping with delayed sleep phase becomes
problematic for teens who need to wake up early for morning
classes, resulting in average weeknight sleep durations around
7 hours per night [10]­much less than the 8.50­9.25 hours
needed at this phase of their lives [11].
Such poor sleep might lead to drug use. According to one of the
few longitudinal studies, young teenagers with poor preschool
sleep habits were more than twice as likely to use drugs, tobacco,
or alcohol ten years later, even after controlling for issues such as
depression, aggression, attention problems and parental alcohol-
ism [12]. A more recent experimental study had teen subjects sleep
for two weeks in a long sleep condition (10 hr/night) and two
weeks in a short-sleep condition (6.5 hr/night). Parents and teens
both reported that participants in the short sleep condition had
many more behavioral, cognitive, and emotional problems [13]. In
turn, conduct problems are cited as one of a number of factors that
precede and correlate with substance use in teens [14].
Also relevant to adolescent drug use, however, are social
factors such as family and school functioning [15] and peer
pressure [16]. Adolescents are embedded in complex social
networks and are especially vulnerable to peer effects, possibly
not only with respect to drugs but also with respect to sleep. An
unexplored aspect of the connection between adolescent sleep
and drug abuse is therefore the impact of social networks. Many
behaviors and affective states, including smoking [17], drinking
[18], weight gain [19], loneliness [20], depression [21], and
happiness [22], have recently been shown to spread through
social networks among adults followed for many years. It seems
likely that both sleep habits and drug use could also spread
among adolescents. If so, the two behaviors, as evinced among
members of peer groups, might in turn influence each other­
between individuals and not just within them.
Here, we use nationally representative data to show that both
sleep behavior and marijuana use spread through social networks
and mediation analyses suggest that an adolescent's sleep behavior
influences a friend's marijuana usage via the impact on the friend's
sleep behavior. This set of relationships suggests that the causal
arrow points from sleep to drug use rather than the other way
around.

Materials and Methods
The Add Health Data
The National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add
Health) is a nationally-representative sample of students in grades
7­12.[23] At the beginning of Wave I, researchers identified an
``in-school'' sample of 90,118 adolescents in 142 schools. These
students filled out questionnaires and named up to 5 male and 5
female friends who were later identified from school-wide rosters
to generate information about each school's complete social
network. A subset of this group was then chosen for in-depth
follow-up later in Wave I (1994­1995), and also in Waves II
(1996), and III (2001­2002). This ``in-home'' sample was
administered a longer questionnaire about their networks and
health behavior from which we draw our information about sleep
and drug use. The average age at inception of the group was 15.8
(SD 1.6), and 51% were female; students averaged 7.8 hours of
sleep per night (SD 1.4) and used marijuana an average of 1 time
(SD 4.5) in the past month (see Text S1). We analyzed only Wave I
and II data here, as, by Wave III, the subjects were no longer in
school.
We treat each friendship nomination as a ``directed tie'' from
the namer to the named friend. We call individuals who are the
objects of analysis ``egos'' and the people to whom they are
connected ``alters.'' Sleep was assessed by self-report at both waves
(``How many hours of sleep do you usually get?''). Although the
validity of self-report of sleep habits is controversial [24], one study
of adolescents comparing self-report to actigraphy reported good
correlation [25]. For most analyses, we dichotomize the sleep
variable by dividing the sample into those who get more than
7 hours (62% of the sample at Wave I and 56% at Wave II) and
those who get 7 or less (38% and 44%, respectively).
Marijuana use was also assessed by self-report at both waves
(``During the past 30 days, how many times did you use
marijuana?''). Studies comparing self-report to biochemical
assessments have shown high accuracy of self-report in tobacco-
smoking adults [26] and marijuana-using adolescents [27]. For
most analyses, we dichotomize the marijuana variable by dividing
the sample into those who used at least once (13% of the sample at
Wave I and 15% at Wave II) and those who did not use at all (87%
and 85%, respectively). For analyses of the number of times used,
we truncate the maximum value to 30 (representing average usage
of once a day).
Statistical Analyses
An association in the behaviors of connected individuals can be
attributed to at least three processes: 1) influence, whereby a
behavior in one person causes the behavior of others; 2) homophily,
whereby individuals with the same behaviors preferentially choose
one another as friends [23]; or 3) confounding, whereby connected
individuals jointly experience contemporaneous exposures (such as
a noisy neighbourhood or a local drug dealer). To distinguish
among these effects requires repeated measures of sleep and drug
use [27], longitudinal information about network ties, and
information about the nature or direction of the ties (e.g., who
nominated whom as a friend).
For some analyses, we considered the prospective effect of social
network variables (such as network centrality­which measures how
central a person is in a network (see Text S1)) and friends' overall
behavior on ego's future sleep behavior and drug use. For other
analyses, we conducted regressions of ego sleep behavior or drug
use in Wave II as a function of ego's age, gender, race, ethnicity,
household income, parental education, and sleep or drug behavior
in Wave I, and of the sleep or drug behavior of an alter in both
Wave II and Wave I. Inclusion of ego's behavior at Wave I helps
to control for ego's genetic endowment and any intrinsic, stable
predilection to engage in drug use or to sleep. Including alter's
behavior at Wave I helps control for homophily [23]. The key
coefficient in these models that measures the effect of influence is
the variable for alter's Wave II behavior [23].
We estimated both logit models (where we consider a
dichotomous version of the outcome variable) and normal
specifications (where we consider a continuous version of the
variable [hours of sleep, number of uses of marijuana]). We use
generalized estimating equation (GEE) procedures to account for
multiple observations of the same ego across ego-alter pairings
[28] and we assume an independent working correlation structure
for the clusters [28]. Huber-White sandwich estimates with
clustering on the egos yielded very similar results.
The GEE regression models in the tables provide parameter
estimates in the form of beta coefficients, whereas the results
reported in the text and figures are in the form of risk ratios. Mean
effect sizes and 95% confidence intervals were calculated by
simulating the first difference in alter's Wave II behavior (changing
from getting .7 hours of sleep to #7 hours of sleep, or from no
drug use to some drug use) using 1,000 randomly drawn sets of
estimates from the coefficient covariance matrix and assuming all
other variables are held at their means [28].
We evaluated the possibility of omitted variables or contempo-
raneous events explaining the associations by examining how the
type or direction of the social relationship between ego and alter
affects the association. If unobserved factors drive the association
between ego and alter, then direction of friendship should not be
relevant. We also considered the possibility that school contextual
effects may drive our results, and analyses (available in Text S1)
show that our results remain significant and effect sizes are similar
in models that restrict observations to a single school. Finally, we
performed a mediation analysis in which we test the hypothesis
that alter's sleep influences ego's sleep which in turn has an effect
on ego's drug use (see Text S1 for more details) [29,30].
Results
Sleep and Drug Behavior Associations Extend Up to Four
Degrees of Separation
Figure 1 shows the largest connected network component in the
largest school in Wave I, based on ties among friends (sibling ties
are excluded to simplify the image). The clusters of poor sleep
(#7 hrs) subjects seen in the network are significantly larger than
expected due to chance. Figure 2 shows that the association
between ego and alter sleep is significant up to four degrees of
separation in both Wave I and Wave II. For example, in Wave I a
subject is 29% (95% C.I. 24% to 34%) more likely to sleep
#7 hours if a directly connected alter (distance 1) sleeps #7 hours.
The relationship for distance 2 alters (the friend of a friend, i.e. two
degrees of separation) is 17% (14% to 20%), for distance 3 alters is
8% (6% to 10%), and for distance 4 alters is 5% (4% to 6%).
Figure 2 also shows the results using the same procedure for drug
use. In Wave I a subject is 190% (178% to 203%) more likely to
use marijuana if a directly connected alter (distance 1) uses
marijuana. The relationship for distance 2 alters is 88% (80% to
95%), for distance 3 alters is 38% (34% to 41%), and for distance 4
alters is 11% (8% to 13%).
Network Centrality and Future Sleep and Drug Use
Figure 1 also suggests a relationship between network centrality,
sleep, and drug use: subjects at the core of the networks appear to
sleep less and to be more likely to use marijuana. We tested these

relationships more rigorously by computing network centrality for
each subject (see Text S1). We found that centrality is significantly
associated with less sleep in the future: a two-standard-deviation
increase in centrality at Wave I increases the probability of
sleeping #7 hours at Wave II by 13% (95% CI: 1% to 26%,
p = 0.03). This relationship between centrality and sleep is net of
controls for age, race, ethnicity, household income, and mother's
education.
In contrast, we find no significant relationship between
centrality and drug use (see Text S1). We also considered the
possibility of effects in the reverse direction, examining the impact
of sleep and drug use in Wave I on network centrality in Wave II.
We find that neither sleep nor marijuana use has an effect on
future network centrality. Thus, it appears that, in the case of
sleep, it is the network structure that influences the behavioral
outcome and not vice versa.
Spread of a Single Behavior Across Time: Relationship
Between Alter Sleep and Drug Use and Ego Behaviors
Ego sleep behavior in Wave II is associated with alter sleep
behavior in Wave I, as shown in Table 1. Notably, each additional
contact who sleeps #7 hours in Wave I increases the likelihood
the ego will sleep #7 hours in Wave II by 5% (95% CI: 1% to
10%, p = 0.02). In a continuous model with hours of sleep as the
dependent variable, the effect is also significant (p = 0.03). In
contrast to the spread of poor sleep behavior, the number of
contacts who sleep .7 hours has a weak but not-quite significant
(p = 0.08) positive effect on an individual's sleep behavior.
Similarly, ego drug use in Wave II is associated with the number
of contacts in Wave I who use drugs, as shown in Table 2. Each
additional drug-using friend increases the likelihood of use by 42%
(95% CI: 28% to 57%) at the next wave. And each additional
drug-using friend increases the number of uses in the previous 30
days by 0.45 uses (0.31 to 0.59), which may be compared with the
average number of uses of 1.06. Non-drug-using friends also have
a negative effect on use, but the effect is smaller. Each non-using
friend decreases the likelihood of use by 10% (4% to 15%) and also
decreases the number of uses in the past 30 days by 0.11 (0.05 to
0.17). In both models, the magnitude of the coefficient on the
number of non-users is significantly smaller than the magnitude of
the coefficient on the number of users (p,0.001). Thus, like sleep
behavior, the spread of drug-using behavior exhibits an asymmetry
Figure 1. Network graph. Figure 1 is a network graph of the largest component of friends in Wave I of the Add Health study (year 1995), from a
single school. Each node represents a subject (there are 800 shown) and its shape denotes gender (circles are female, squares are male). Lines
between nodes indicate relationships (arrows point from the naming friend to the named friend). Node colour denotes nightly sleep duration (red for
6 hours or less, orange for 7 hours, white for 8 hours or more) and node size indicates frequency of marijuana use (the smallest nodes do not use
marijuana, the largest report using at least daily). The network suggests clustering of both sleep and drug use behavior, and as we show in the
statistical analysis, some of the overlap in clustering may result from a causal effect of sleep on drug use. Node placement is based on the Kamada-
Kawai algorithm (see Text S1) [50].

that suggests the negative health behavior is more contagious than
the positive health behavior.
We next examined how the actual behavior in ego's alters was
associated with ego's sleep behavior and drug use. Unlike the
prospective models which evaluated the impact of the overall
count or number of a person's friends who behaved a particular
way, these models look at ego-alter pairs and examine how a
change in behavior in each alter is associated with a change in
behavior in the ego. The models adjust for sex, age, race, ethnicity,
household income, parental education, and the ego's prior
behavior. Including alter's prior behavior helps control for the
process of selecting friends based on their behaviors. However, our
main interest here is the impact of one person's behavior on the
behavior of others, which we estimate using the coefficient on
Figure 2. Spread of sleep and drug use. Figure 2 shows that the association between ego and alter sleep is significant up to four degrees of
separation in both Wave I and Wave II. The left panel shows the percentage increase in the likelihood a person sleeps #7 hours if a friend at a certain
social distance sleeps #7 hours. The right panel shows the percentage increase in the likelihood a person uses marijuana if a friend at a certain social
distance uses marijuana. The relationship is strongest between individuals who are directly connected, but it remains significantly greater than zero
at social distances up to 4 degrees of separation in both Wave I and Wave II. Thus, a person's sleep and drug use behavior is associated with the same
behavior of other people up to 4 degrees removed from them in the network. Error bars are derived by comparing the conditional probability of the
behavior in the observed network with an identical network in which topology and incidence of the behavior is preserved but the assignment of the
behavior is randomly distributed [19,55 2008]. Alter social distance (degrees of separation) refers to closest social distance between the alter and ego
(friend = distance 1, friend's friend = distance 2, etc.). Error bars show 95% confidence intervals.

alter's current behavior. Figure 3 shows the results of these models,
and how they vary for different kinds of friends and for siblings (see
Text S1).
If a friend sleeps #7 hours, it increases the likelihood the ego
sleeps #7 hours by 11% (95% CI: 2% to 21%). Similarly, if a
friend becomes a marijuana user, it more than doubles the
likelihood the ego uses marijuana (110% increase, 67% to 159%).
When we analyze how often subjects used marijuana in the past 30
days as the dependent variable, we find that each use by a friend is
associated with 0.14 additional uses by the ego (0.10 to 0.18). To
be sure that between-school differences were not responsible for
the effect, we restricted the sample to a single, large school, with
the same results (see Text S1).
One concern in network studies is the possibility that contextual
effects can confound the analysis. The finding that the results are
robust within a single school helps to mitigate this concern, but an
additional technique is to take advantage of the directionality of
friendships. Each person was asked to name their friends, but not
all of these nominations were reciprocated. Therefore, we can
distinguish three possibilities: ego-perceived friends (denoted
``friends''), ``alter-perceived friends'' (the alter named ego as a
friend, but not vice versa), and ``mutual friends'' (ego and alter
nominated each other). If the association between ego and alter is
driven by a shared exposure (such as a local drug dealer), we would
expect the effects to be equally strong in each of these types of
relations. But if the association is due to influence, then we would
expect ego-perceived friends to be more influential then alter-
perceived friends, since, in the latter case, the ego may not even
know a person who has named them as a friend. Moreover, we
expect mutual friends to be the most influential.
In Figure 3, we show that the effect of alter-perceived friends on
sleep is not significant (p = 0.35) and on drug use is marginally

significant (65%, 95% CI: 4% to 123%) but about half the size of
the effect of ego-perceived friends. Moreover, mutual friends exhibit
the strongest associations. A mutual friend who sleeps #7 hours
increases the likelihood the ego sleeps #7 hours by 20% (4% to
37%) and a mutual friend who starts using marijuana more than
triples the risk that the ego uses marijuana (218% increase,117% to
345%). These results suggest that at least part of the association
between ego and alter behavior is due to influence.
Finally, a sibling who sleeps #7 hours increases the likelihood
that the ego sleeps #7 hours by 29% (20% to 40%) and a sibling
who starts using marijuana increases the likelihood the ego uses by
73% (44% to 105%). However, it is important to note that unlike
friends, sibling relationships are all mutual, so we cannot use
directionality to test whether these associations result from
influence, shared genes, or a shared home environment. We
present results for siblings primarily for comparison to the friend
effects.
Mediation Effects Between Sleep and Drug Use
In Table 3, we present the results of a mediation analysis in
which the hypothesized causal pathway is that a friend's sleep
behavior can spread to the ego, and the resulting change in ego's
sleep behavior can also affect ego's drug-using behavior, net of any
predilection to form friendships based on sleep, drug use, or other
factors. The results show that when a friend sleeps #7 hours it
increases the likelihood that the ego will use marijuana by 19%
(95% CI: 2% to 39%, p = 0.02). Moreover, in keeping with the
baseline analyses described above, alter's sleep behavior is
significantly associated with ego's sleep behavior (p = 0.001), and
ego's marijuana use is significantly associated with ego's sleep
behavior, controlling for alter's sleep behavior (p = 0.001). When
we estimate the size of the mediated effect, we find that when a
friend sleeps #7 hours, it increases the likelihood that the ego will
use marijuana by 4% (1% to 7%) via its impact on ego's sleep
behavior. This represents approximately 20% of the total effect of
alter sleep on ego drug use. It is important to note that this effect is
additive; each additional friend who sleeps poorly also significantly
increases drug use by the same amount.
Finally, we also tested the hypothesis that the relationship
between alter sleep and ego drug use is mediated by the spread of
drug use, rather than sleep. While the coefficients are all at least
marginally significant in the individual models (see Text S1), the
mediated effect is not. We also reversed the direction of the
hypothesis and studied whether alter's drug use influences ego's
sleep behavior, via either the spread of drug use or the spread of
sleep behavior. In neither case did we find a significant direct
association (see Text S1), suggesting the causal pathway is from
sleep to drugs and not the other way around.
Discussion
Figure 4 summarizes the main findings. The evidence suggests
that poor sleep leads to drug use in adolescents, and that both sleep
and drug use spread through social networks. We show (for the
first time, to our knowledge) a mediation effect in which the spread
of one health behavior affects the spread of another. Specifically, a
person's risk of drug use increases if his friends sleep poorly, and
this effect is mediated in part by the spread of poor sleep behavior
from one person to another.

Table 3 shows mediation effect of sleep on drug use. First three columns show logistic regression model of ego's marijuana use behavior (the outcome variable) on
alter's sleep behavior (the explanatory variable). Second three columns show logistic regression model of ego's sleep behavior (the mediator variable) on alter's sleep
behavior (the explanatory variable). Last three columns show logistic regression model of ego's marijuana use behavior (the outcome variable) on ego's sleep behavior
(the mediator variable) controlling for alter's sleep behavior (the explanatory variable). Models were estimated using a general estimating equation with clustering on
the ego and an independent working covariance structure. Models with an exchangeable correlation structure yielded poorer fit. Fit statistics show sum of squared
deviance between predicted and observed values for the model and a null model with no covariates. A bootstrap procedure that takes into account uncertainty of both
the effect of the independent variable on the mediator and the mediator on the outcome variable shows that when an alter starts sleeping #7 hours, it increases the
likelihood of ego drug use by 4% (95% C.I. 1% to 7%) via its effect on the mediator (ego sleep), which represents approximately 20% of the total effect of alter sleep on
ego drug use.

Sleep, Drugs, Social Networks
PLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 6 March 2010 | Volume 5 | Issue 3 | e9775
It is well known that both sleep and drug use can be
influenced by social pressure [31], [32]. But behaviors do not
exist in isolation: one behavior can influence another both
within and between individuals. Hence, beyond social influence,
the present study is the first to consider the coevolution of two
spreading processes on a fully observed network. By tracking
subjects over time, our data show not only the pattern of growth
of two independent health behaviors, but go further to reveal a
mechanism by which one may encourage another. One possible
explanation for our results may be the effect of poor sleep on
decision-making and behavior regulation. Poor sleep in
adolescents has been shown to decrease behavior regulation,
including impulse control, emotion regulation, and behavioral
flexibility [13], as well as health-risk behaviours, such as
suicidality and substance use [33], and poor school performance
[9,34].
The present study was limited to survey questions gathered
about marijuana use. It is common, however, for marijuana to act
as a `gateway' increasing risk for youth to progress to other, more
serious drugs [35,36]. The National Center on Addiction and
Substance Abuse at Columbia University recently reported that
nearly half of full-time students binge drink and/or abuse
prescription and illegal drugs [37]. From 1993 to 2005, abuse of
prescription opioids, or pain killers, increased 343%; abuse of
prescription tranquilizers such as Xanax and Valium rose 450%;
and abuse of prescription stimulants such as Adderall was up
93.3%. The present study was unable to account for the effect of
other substance use on an individual's sleep patterns, or the
progression of friends' substance use on the network. Examination
of the spread of other substances, such as amphetamines that are
known to disrupt sleep, would be a natural extension of the present
findings.
We also show a number of novel network effects. In contrast
to prior studies that showed associations in behaviors and
affective states extending up to three degrees of separation
[17,18,19,20,21,22,38], here we show they extend up to four
degrees for both sleep and drug use. We also show that people with
high network centrality are at greater risk of poor sleep, which in
turn affects drug use. This is consistent with the finding that
negative outcomes for both sleep and drug use spread more
reliably than positive ones; more centrally located individuals are
in a structural location that makes them more susceptible to
behavioral contagions, since they sit at a sort of ``crossroads'' in the
network.
These results pave the way for further analysis of other negative
health outcomes that may be mediated by sleep, such as alcohol
use. It is likely that the negative effects of poor sleep that lead an
adolescent to try marijuana would influence decisions to try
alcohol in similar ways. We also hypothesize that behaviors that
have already been shown to spread through social networks, such
as obesity [19], drinking [18], and smoking [17], may be good
candidates for such a mediation analysis. And, apart from sleep,
these data suggest a way forward in identifying the causal processes
that underlie important behavioral contagions. For example, we
could use the same methodology to study whether the spread of
eating certain types of food (like junk food) mediates the spread of
obesity [19].
Our findings suggest a number of directions that might help
policy-makers and researchers to improve anti-drug campaigns.
First, efforts to increase sleep in adolescents may help to reduce
substance use in this population. Although the present findings
show that poor sleep behavior has a stronger influence on the
network compared to good sleep behavior, lessening the influence
of poor sleep behavior may be an effective mechanism for
decreasing substance use. One possible intervention would be a
napping program during or after school. Napping has been shown
to improve memory [39,40,41,42,43], alertness [44], and creativity
in young adults [45]. Helping adolescents to get more nocturnal
sleep may be challenging. Although the present analysis did not
examine morning rise time (the information was not available),
future studies should investigate whether the majority of
adolescents who are vulnerable to the negative consequences of
sleep loss for drug use also have the greatest level of delayed sleep
phase. Perhaps, for these individuals, a systematic daytime sleep
regimen would be advisable, and the results reported here suggest
that benefits of such an intervention could spread to influence
friends.
Our results also show that adolescents who are most centrally
located in the social network are not only more influential but
also the most vulnerable to poor health outcomes. This suggests
that anti-drug interventions targeting central individuals may be
more effective for reducing drug use across the whole network.
In the same vein, sleep interventions may benefit from targeting
individuals who are more central to the network, and such
interventions could spill over and help reduce drug use in many
other individuals. Studies of vaccinations have shown a linear
effect between success of vaccination and number of connec-
tions [46]. Furthermore, costs of interventions can be reduced
substantially when more central individuals are treated [47].
Targeted sleep interventions might be similarly effective,
helping to immunize a whole population against drug use.
People are connected, and so their health behaviors are
connected.

Figure 4. Summary of results. Blue arrows indicate significant direct
relationships, while the purple arrow indicates the only mediation
relationship that was found to be significant between alter sleep
behavior and ego drug use. Arrows from alter to ego are directional
because the statistical evidence suggests that at least some of the
associations result from a causal relationship.
