Introduction
Data from Global cancer statistics show that breast cancer
(BC) is the most common type of cancer among women,
leading the number of deaths caused by cancer.1 Early
detection through mammography allows more treatment
options and consequently greater survival of these women.
However, increased patient survival enhances their chances
of suffering from the late side effects of cancer therapy.2,3
The therapy strategies today include combinations of drugs,
radiation and surgery. Many of these therapies cause cardiac
side effects that influence the success of treatment.4
It is known that radiation-induced heart disease (RIHD)
is a late effect caused by radiation in the thoracic region,
when all or part of the heart is in the radiation field.3-5
Among the manifestations of RIHD are valvulopathy, peri-
carditis and myocardial fibrosis.6-8
In the literature it is possible find different forms related
to cardiotoxicity caused by chemotherapeutic agents,
including cellular damage caused by free radical formation,
and induction of immunogenic reactions in the heart. The
chemotherapy regimen choice depends on tumor stage, and
also on the patient's clinical condition. One of the schemes

Abstract
Background and aim: Cardiovascular complications are one limitation of breast cancer treatment. The aim of the current
study was to investigate whether the renin­angiotensin related genes could be altered by chemotherapy and radio-
therapy, using a rat model.
Methods: Female rats were divided into three groups: control, chemotherapy + irradiation (TC+IR) and irradiation (IR).
Molecular analyses of the left ventricle were performed five months after the end of treatment. The analyses evaluated
the changes in mRNA levels of some renin­angiotensin system (RAS) related genes: angiotensinogen, renin, angiotensin-
converting enzyme (ACE) and angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which
can be related to ACE production, by RT-PCR.
Results: Renin was only observed in treated groups, TC+IR and IR, compared with the control group. ACE and VEGF
levels were decreased in TC+IR (p<0.001) and in IR (p<0.001), and AT1
mRNA was higher in groups TC+IR (p<0.01)
and IR (p<0.05) compared with the control group.
Conclusion: Chemotherapy and irradiation can induce significant changes in some RAS related genes. These alterations are
important to understand the pathways and consequences beyond cardiotoxicity induced by breast cancer treatments.

used for BC treatment is the association of taxanes and
cyclophosphamide, known as the TC regimen.9,10 Taxanes
such as docetaxel have been widely incorporated into the
chemotherapy options for early stage BC treatment. The
taxanes'mechanism of action is the inhibition of cell division
by interrupting the function of microtubules, but their use is
also related to cardiotoxicity, and the exact way this occurs
is still unknown.11,12 Alkylating agents such as cyclophos-
phamide act directly in the alkylation of the DNAmolecule.
The precise mechanisms of cyclophosphamide-induced
cardiotoxicity are also unknown. One hypothesis is that
cyclophosphamide causes direct damage to the endothelium
followed by extravasations of toxic metabolites, resulting
in damage to the cardiomyocytes, hemorrhage and edema.13
The drugs that inhibit the renin­angiotensin system
(RAS) are the major therapeutic strategy for treating hyper-
tension and reducing cardiovascular damage, and they are
being used in patients undergoing chemotherapy for BC
treatment.14-16 Since its discovery in 1890, the RAS has
been identified as an endocrine system, where the circulat-
ing renin, produced in the kidney, regulates cardiovascular
function by angiotensin II, which exerts its biologic actions
by binding to either the angiotensin type 1 or type 2 recep-
tors on target tissues. Until recently only this conventional
RAS was recognized.17 However, it is now known that the
kidneys are not the only source of renin production, and the
angiotensin peptides may be produced in tissues and organs
independently. In the heart, changes in some RAS compo-
nents, such as angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1) and
angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), are often observed
in conditions leading to progression of heart failure.18-20
The local RAS functions are not yet fully explained, but it
is believed that they are tissue-specific. It is known that
some of the local cardiac RAS components are up-regu-
lated in RIHD, but there are few studies that show its action
on the association of both chemotherapy and irradiation
treatments for BC.17,18,21
The present study evaluated the expression of some
RAS components: angiotensinogen, renin, ACE and AT1
and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which can
be related to ACE production, by RT-PCR, in female Wistar
rats undergoing chemotherapy (TC) and/or irradiation.
Also investigated was the presence of mast cells in the heart
tissue of these animals, since they can be a major source of
renin production.22
Materials and methods
Animals
Female Wistar rats (n = 15), three months old, weighing
approximately 200g, were kept in appropriate cages with
four animals in each, on a 12-h light/dark cycle with food
and water provided ad libitum. The animals were divided
into three groups, five animals each: control (received no
further treatment), TC + IR (group receiving a chemother-
apy regimen and irradiation) and IR (group receiving only
irradiation). The study protocol was approved by the local
ethical council (No. CEUA/010/2012).
Chemotherapy administration
In the TC+IR group, the multidrug TC was intraperito-
neally administered to the animals. There were given four
cycles, with an interval of seven days between them, and
each animal received cyclophosphamide 50mg/kg dis-
solved in saline (Baxter, Brazil) and 12.5mg/kg docetaxel
dissolved in 95% ethanol and diluted with 5% glucose solu-
tion (Eurofarma, Brazil). The dose for each drug, in each
cycle, was calculated to be equivalent to a chemotherapy
dose per cycle in humans by the Human Equivalent Dose
Calculation.23 Seven days after the last cycle of chemother-
apy, the animals were irradiated (TC+IR). Animals from IR
group received no chemotherapy, only irradiation.
Irradiation
Before irradiation rats were anesthetized with ketamine/
xylazine intraperitoneally (0.1 mg/kg), and immobilized in
a polystyrene support. This ensures the animals' perma-
nence in the same position during the procedure. Rats were
irradiated with a single dose of 20 Gy to the heart, using a
linear accelerator Varian Clinac ® 2100 C (Varian Medical
Systems, CA, USA) with a 6 MV X-ray, and dose rate of
240 cGy/min. Single doses of 20 Gy are calculated to be
approximately equivalent to total fractionated doses of
30­50 Gy (2 Gy per fraction), according to the linear quad-
ratic model and an a/b ratio of 2:3 as described by Schultz-
Hector et al.24 Individual rats were irradiated in the supine
position, using an anterior field size of 2 cm2 with bolus
depth of 0.5 cm. The heart position was marked after
computed tomography simulation (HiSpeed CT/Dual, GE
Healthcare, USA). After irradiation, animals were returned
to the cages and remained under close observation until
euthanasia, five months after irradiation. These time points
were chosen based on previous studies where, at four
months after irradiation, cardiac lesions could be observed
in rats exposed to single doses of 12.5 Gy or higher.25,26
Real-time PCR-RT
Total RNA was extracted from the left ventricle (LV) of
animals from control, TC+IR and IR groups, by using
Trizol Reagent (Invitrogen, NY, USA) according to the
manufacturer's protocol. Total RNA was treated with
DNAse amplification grade I (Invitrogen, NY, USA) and
first-strand cDNA was synthesized using 2µg from
total RNA and ImProm-IITM Reverse Transcription System
(Promega, WI, USA) following the manufacturer's instruc-
tions. Oligonucleotide primers were designed based on the
332 Journal of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System 14(4)
cDNA sequences reported in the GenBank database (www.
ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). The sequences of primers are listed in
Table 1. Real-time quantitative PCR analyses were per-
formed using Applied Biosystems 7500 and SDS 7500
v.2.0.1 software (Applied Biosystems, CA, USA). PCR
amplifications were performed using Gotaq qPCR Master
Mix (Promega, WI, USA). PCR cycling conditions were as
follows: initial 95°C for 10 min, then 40 cycles using 95°C
for 20 s, and 60°C for 60 s. Amplification specificity was
determined using melt curves. Each sample was run and
analyzed in duplicate. Angiotensinogen, renin, ACE, AT1
and VEGF mRNA levels were normalized by the values
relative to GAPDH (glyceraldehydes-3-phosphate dehy-
drogenase), and expression ratios were computed using the
threshold cycle method (Ct).
Mast cell staining
Transverse sections of the LV were post-fixed in 10%
buffered formalin and embedded in paraffin. Transverse
LV paraffin (6 m thick) sections were subjected to mast
cell analysis using acidic toluidine blue staining solution.
First, the sections were deparaffinized in xylene and
hydrated through alcohol to distilled water. They were
then incubated in an aqueous solution of 0.20% Toluidine
Blue (Sigma-Aldrich, MA, USA) acidified to pH 2.3 for
2­3 min. Sections were washed three times in fresh dis-
tilled water. Then they were quickly dehydrated through
95% and two changes of 100% alcohol, cleared in xylene
and mounted with Entellan (Merck Millipore, MA, USA).
Mast cells stained a violet/red purple color with a blue
background.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was performed by one-way analysis of
variance (ANOVA) and Tukey's post-hoc test (GraphPad
Prism 5.03; GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA, USA). All
results are means ± standard error of mean (SEM). Values
of p< 0.05 were considered significant.
Results
Cardiac expression of RAS components in
rats submitted to chemotherapy and/or
radiotherapy
To ascertain whether RAS-related genes could be altered
in treated rats, the expression levels of angiotensinogen,
renin, ACE and AT1 were assessed. Compared with the
control group no significant difference in angiotensinogen
mRNA levels was observed (Figure 1). Renin was only
observed in treated groups, TC+IR and IR, compared with
the control group, and there was no significant difference
between them (Figure 2). ACE levels were decreased in
TC+IR (p<0.001) and in IR (p<0.001) groups compared
with controls (Figure 3). AT1 mRNA was higher in groups
TC+IR (p<0.01) and IR (p<0.05) when compared with the
control group (Figure 4). These results suggest that some
RAS-related genes could alter their mRNA levels in con-
sequence of TC and/or IR treatment.
Cardiac expression ofVEGF
As a decreased level of ACE mRNA was observed in
treated groups, and ACE is mainly produced by endothelial
cells, the expression levels of VEGF were assessed. It was
observed that VEGF mRNA levels were decreased in the
TC+IR group (p<0.001) and in the IR group (p<0.001)
when compared with controls (Figure 5).
Mast cell staining
The presence of mast cells in the LV tissue of all groups
was investigated using a toluidine blue solution. Mast cells
were identified in treated groups, TC+IR and IR, but not in
controls (Figure 6).
Discussion
The new detection methods and treatment for BC have
improved life expectancy of survivors; however, they allow
the development of cardiac side effects. It is therefore

essential to understand the causes of this complication to
achieve success in patient treatment.4,10,12,27
Knowledge of the RAS has advanced in recent years
since the classic endocrine system to a new concept that
includes a series of local RASs, which operate indepen-
dently in several organs, especially in the heart.28-31
In this study an animal model was developed, using female
Wistar rats submitted to four cycles of chemotherapy and/or
irradiation, mimicking a regular BC treatment in women. The
purpose was to evaluate the expression of some local cardiac
RAS components, using the quantitative RT-PCR technique,
focusing on late cardiac treatment complications.
In the literature the control of angiotensinogen expres-
sion is controversial. There are no supporting evidences
that correlate its expression and radiation or chemother-
apy regimens. The obtained results showed no significant
alterations in angiotensinogen expression between
groups. Interestingly, we identified that renin was not
ubiquitously expressed in cardiac tissue, but it is strongly
induced by TC+IR and IR treatments. These findings

corroborate previous studies that show angiotensinogen in
cardiac tissue is produced by cardiomyocytes and fibro-
blasts, but that the renin found in this tissue is produced by
the kidneys.17,21,32,33 It is known that mast cells can synthe-
size, store and secrete renin, being an important source of
this enzyme.22 A study made by Boerma and Hauer-Jensen5
revealed the presence of mast cells in cardiac tissue after
exposure to localized heart irradiation with a single dose of
18 Gy. As in the present study the presence of renin was
detected in treated groups; it was suggested that this renin
could be produced by mast cells present on the tissue. In
order to confirm this hypothesis our study performed a
toluidine blue staining to visualize the presence of mast
cells in cardiac tissue. Mast cells were found only in treated
groups, supporting our hypothesis that these cells are
responsible for the renin mRNA levels in TC+IR and IR
cardiac tissue.
The expression of ACE in cardiac tissue was also
assessed, and the treated groups had decreased mRNA
levels of ACE compared with controls. It is known that
the ACE is mainly produced by endothelial cells,34-36 and
that irradiation primarily affects these cells, causing apop-
tosis of the same, and subsequent decrease in capillary
density.37-39 Previous studies demonstrated that several
chemotherapeutic agents, like docetaxel and cyclophos-
phamide, have an antiangiogenic activity by increasing
endothelial cells apoptosis and decreasing the expression
of VEGF levels.40-43 Thus, in this study heart VEGF
mRNA levels were evaluated and results showed that,
similarly to ACE levels, treated groups had decreased lev-
els of VEGF compared with controls. These findings
taken together suggest that irradiation and chemotherapy
cause an angiogenesis reduction, and as ACE is mainly
produced by endothelial cells, it may cause a reduction in
ACE levels in the cardiac tissue.
The mRNAAT1 levels were assessed in this study and
results showed that their levels were higher in treated
groups compared with controls. AT1 receptors are
expressed in cardiomyocytes, fibroblasts and, recently,
they are known to be expressed in cardiac mast cells.44,45
Many studies showed that this receptor is up-regulated in
the cardiac remodeling process after several pathologic
conditions.46,47
In this present study the ACE expression was reduced
and AT1 expression was higher, which seems to be con-
troversial. This can be associated with the novel and more
complex aspects of the RAS role in cardiovascular func-
tion. Evidence is available that angiotensin II is not only
generated by ACE, but other enzymes can participate in
this process, for example chymase.48,49 Furthermore,
recent studies show that the AT1 receptors can exert their
function and can be over expressed in the absence of
angiotensin II.50
The participation of cardiac local RAS components in
cardiovascular complications induced by cancer treatments
is a novel and controversial area, and additional studies are
needed to better understand the pathways and consequences
beyond this mechanism. Such studies intend to improve
breast cancer treatment strategies, limiting late cardiovas-
cular complications.

Conclusion
The local RAS plays an important role in cardiovascular
disorders. This study aimed to evaluate cardiac RAS com-
ponents using the RT-PCR technique. The main results
were the gene expression of renin only in treated groups,
decreased expression of ACE and increased expression of
AT1 receptor in the same groups. The latter observations
indicate that therapeutic strategies for BC must consider
these RAS component alterations in order to avoid the
known cardiac complications.
