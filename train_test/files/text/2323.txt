Context: Although antipsychotic treatment has re-
cently increased, little is known about how this devel-
opment has differentially affected the office-based care
of adults and young people in the United States.
Objective: To compare national trends and patterns in
antipsychotic treatment of adults and youths in office-
based medical practice.
Design: Trends between 1993 and 2009 in visits with
antipsychotics for children (0-13 years), adolescents
(14-20 years), and adults (21 years) are described on
a per population basis and as a proportion of total medi-
cal office visits. Background and clinical characteristics
of recent (2005-2009) antipsychotic visits are also com-
pared by patient age.
Setting: Outpatient visits to physicians in office-based
practice.
Participants: Visits from the 1993-2009 National Am-
bulatory Medical Care Surveys (N=484 889).
Main Outcome Measures: Visits with a prescription
of antipsychotic medications.
Results: Between 1993-1998 and 2005-2009, visits with
a prescription of antipsychotic medications per 100 per-
sons increased from 0.24 to 1.83 for children, 0.78 to 3.76
for adolescents, and 3.25 to 6.18 for adults. The propor-
tion of total visits that included a prescription of anti-
psychotics increased during this period from 0.16% to
1.07% for youths and from 0.88% to 1.73% for adults.
From 2005 to 2009, disruptive behavior disorders were
the most common diagnoses in child and adolescent an-
tipsychotic visits, accounting for 63.0% and 33.7%, re-
spectively, while depression (21.2%) and bipolar disor-
der (20.2%) were the 2 most common diagnoses in adult
antipsychotic visits. Psychiatrists provided a larger pro-
portion of the antipsychotic visits for children (67.7%)
and adolescents (71.6%) than to adults (50.3%) (P.001).
From2005to2009,antipsychoticswereincludedin28.8%
of adult visits and 31.1% of youth visits to psychiatrists.
Conclusions: On a population basis, adults make con-
siderably more medical visits with a prescription of an-
tipsychotics than do adolescents or children. Yet anti-
psychotic treatment has increased especially rapidly
among young people, and recently antipsychotics have
been prescribed in approximately the same proportion
of youth and adult visits to psychiatrists.

OVER THE PAST SEVERAL
years, anincreasing num-
ber of adults and chil-
dren in the United States
havebeentreatedwithan-
tipsychotic medications.1,2 Antipsychotics
are now among the most commonly pre-
scribed and costly classes of medications.3
In adults, antipsychotic medications have
demonstrated efficacy and have been ap-
proved by the Food and Drug Administra-
tion (FDA) as a primary treatment for
schizophrenia4,5 and bipolar disorder6,7 and
as an adjunctive treatment for major de-
pressive disorder.8 In children and adoles-
cents, antipsychotics are indicated for irri-
tability associated with autistic disorder
(5-16years),ticsandvocalutterancesofTo-
urette syndrome and bipolar mania (10-17
years), and schizophrenia (13-17 years).9
With increasing use of antipsychotic
drugs, the range of mental disorders treated
with these medications in practice has
broadened.10-15 As a result, the proportion
of second-generation antipsychotic medi-
cationsprescribedtotreatschizophreniahas
decreased from 51% (1995-1996) to 24%
(2007-2008),2 while antipsychotic treat-
ment of anxiety disorders in adults and
youths has roughly doubled.12 In young
people, attention-deficit/hyperactivity dis-
order and other disruptive disorders ac-
count for a substantial proportion (37.8%)
of antipsychotic use.11

The metabolic safety concerns of antipsychotic medi-
cations16,17 focus our attention on antipsychotic prescrib-
ing practices in the community, especially on the extent
to which antipsychotics are used to treat disorders for
which there is limited empirical evidence of efficacy.15,18
Young people may be especially sensitive to the adverse
metabolic effects of second-generation antipsychotics. As
compared with adults, children may be more vulnerable
to antipsychotic-induced weight gain19 and perhaps even
to antipsychotic-associated diabetes.20,21

With respect to adults, acceptance of antipsychotics as ad-

absence of psychotic features,30 might have increased anti-
psychoticuse.Becausedepressivedisordersaresignificantly

en. Increasing use of antipsychotics in adult anxiety disor-
ders may have a similar effect.12
A comparison is presented of nationally representative
survey data from adult and youth visits to office-based phy-
sicians. The analyses focus on trends and patterns of an-
tipsychotic treatment. Prior to conducting these analyses,
we predicted that the increase in the proportion of physi-
cian visits with a prescription of antipsychotic medica-
tionswouldbemorepronouncedforyouthsthanforadults.
METHODS
Data were obtained from the National Ambulatory Medical Care
Survey (NAMCS).32 The NAMCS, which is conducted annu-
ally by the National Center for Health Statistics, samples a na-
tionally representative group of visits to physicians in office-
based practice. Following National Center for Health Statistics
recommendations, data from contiguous survey years were com-
bined to derive more stable estimates (1993-1998, 1999-2004,
and 2005-2009). Across the 17 survey years, response rates var-
ied between 58.9% (2006) and 73.1% (1993), with a mean of
66.1%.33 For each visit, the treating physician or member of the
physician's staff provided information about patient sociode-
mographic and clinical characteristics, as well as the medica-
tions prescribed or supplied to the patient.
DIAGNOSIS
Diagnoses were made according to the International Classifi-
cation of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification. For the
analysis of trends in antipsychotic use stratified by age groups,
visits were grouped by occurrence of mood, anxiety, and psy-
chotic disorders. In the analysis that compares the character-
istics of antipsychotic visits across age groups (2005-2009), vis-
its were classified by diagnoses of schizophrenia and related
psychotic disorders, bipolar disorder, depression, anxiety, de-
velopmental disorders or mental retardation, disruptive behav-
ior disorders, and other mental disorders (eTable, http://www
.archgenpsychiatry.com).
PSYCHOTROPIC MEDICATIONS
Visits in which psychotropic medications were either sup-
plied or prescribed were classified into 5 medication groups:
antipsychotic medications, which are the primary focus of the
analyses; stimulants and other attention-deficit/hyperactivity
disorder medications; antidepressants; anxiolytics/hypnotics;
and mood stabilizers. The antipsychotic medication group ex-
cluded prochlorperazine edisylate and promethazine hydro-
chloride because they are commonly used for nonpsychiatric
indications. Anxiolytics/hypnotics included benzodiazepines
and nonbenzodiazepine sedatives and anxiolytics. Mood sta-
bilizers included lithium carbonate or lithium citrate, carba-
mazepine, divalproex sodium/valproate sodium/valproic acid,
and lamotrigine. All antidepressants including those such as
bupropion hydrochloride, duloxetine hydrochloride, and tra-
zodone hydrochloride, which are also used for non­mental
health indications, were included.
SOURCE OF PAYMENT
Data were collapsed into 3 nonmutually exclusive categories: (1)
private insurance such as Blue Cross/Blue Shield and other com-
mercial insurance; (2) public insurance, including Medicare,
Medicaid, and other government insurance; and (3) a residual
category ("self-pay/other") that combined patients with self-
payment, no charge, workers compensation, those whose source
of insurance was unknown, and those who received uncompen-
sated care. In visits with more than 1 source of payment, assign-
ment was hierarchical, with visits assigned to private, public, and
self-pay/other insurance groups in descending order.
FDA-APPROVED INDICATION
One or more antipsychotics have been approved for schizo-
phrenia or schizoaffective disorder, bipolar disorder, autistic
disorder, Tourette syndrome, and major depressive disorder
when coprescribed with an antidepressant. In the following
analysis, FDA-approved visits include only those visits with a
diagnosis for which the specific prescribed antipsychotic had
been approved by the visit year for the age of the patient. This
definition recognizes the substantial within-class heteroge-
neity in safety34 and efficacy35 that exists among antipsychotic
medications and is consistent with the FDA's approach of drug
indication approval at the level of individual drugs.
OTHER CHARACTERISTICS
Visits were also classified by patient sex, patient race/ethnicity
(white, non-Hispanic, or other), specialty of the treating phy-
sician (psychiatrist or nonpsychiatrist), and whether psycho-
therapy was provided by the physician at the visit.
ANALYTIC STRATEGY
Population-based proportions and associated 95% CIs of office-
based adult (21 years), adolescent (14-20 years), and child
(0-13 years) visits with antipsychotic treatment (hereafter re-
ferred to as antipsychotic visits) were determined for the time
periods of 1993-1998, 1999-2004, and 2005-2009. Denomi-

nators were derived from intercensal estimates from the US
Bureau of the Census36 of the corresponding demographic
groups (Table 1). For years 2005-2009, population-based
proportions of office-based antipsychotic visits with surround-
ing 95% CIs were determined for the 3 age groups (0-13, 14-
20, and 21 years), sex, and broad race/ethnicity group
(Table 2).
The proportions of youth (0-20 years) and adult (21 years)
office-based antipsychotic visits were determined overall and
stratified by patient sex, patient race/ethnicity, payment source,
physicianspecialty,psychotherapy,broadmentaldisordergroup,
and FDA-approved indication for each time period (1993-
1998, 1999-2004, and 2005-2009). Logistic regression mod-
els were used to assess time trends in the probability of anti-
psychotic visits. A study period variable was defined for each
survey year running from 0 for 1993 to 1 for 2009. The out-
come of interest is the odds of an antipsychotic across the en-
tire period (1993-2009). For example, an odds ratio of 2.0 de-
notes twice the odds that a visit included an antipsychotic at
the end (2009) as compared with the start (1993) of the study
period. Separate regressions were constructed for each level of
visit characteristics of interest. For example, one regression as-
sessed the odds of antipsychotic visits over the study period
for male visits and a separate regression for female visits. An
interaction term was added to each regression to assess whether
trends in antipsychotic use significantly differed across these
groups. The P values associated with these interaction terms
are presented in Tables 3 and 4.
For years 2005-2009, the difference in proportion test
was used to compare the background and clinical character-
istics of antipsychotic visits for children, adolescents, and
adults during the period from 2005 to 2009. A separate
analysis compared the clinical characteristics of youth and
adult antipsychotic visits by specialty of the treating physi-
cian (psychiatrist vs nonpsychiatrist). The frequency distri-
bution in the time period of 2005-2009 of the 4 most com-
monly prescribed antipsychotics in each age group was also
determined.
Analyses were adjusted for visit weights, clustering, and strati-
fication of data using design elements provided by the Na-
tional Center for Health Statistics. When adjusted for these ele-
ments, survey data represent annual visits to US office-based
physicians.37 Analyses were conducted using SUDAAN soft-
ware (Research Triangle Institute), all analyses were 2 sided,
and  was set at .05.
RESULTS
TRENDS IN ANTIPSYCHOTIC VISITS
ON A POPULATION BASIS
On a per capita basis, office-based antipsychotic visits
increased among all 3 age groups but were consis-
tently more prevalent for adults than for adolescents
and were least prevalent for children (Table 1). During
the 2005-2009 time period, the estimated number of
antipsychotic visits per 100 adults was significantly
greater for female than male patients, while the reverse
was true for children (Table 2). For adolescents and
adults, but not children, the corresponding proportion
of antipsychotic visits was significantly greater on a
per population basis for white non-Hispanics than for
the other racial/ethnic group.

TRENDS IN ANTIPSYCHOTIC USE AMONG
ADULT AND YOUTH VISITS
Duringthestudyperiod,antipsychoticuseincreasedamong
adult and youth visits, with a significantly greater increase
by youths. Antipsychotic use increased especially rapidly
among visits by young people who were male, non-
Hispanicwhiteinrace/ethnicity,andwhopaidfortheircare
with private insurance or other nonpublic sources. Anti-
psychotic use also significantly increased among visits by
youths who were Hispanic or nonwhite. A corresponding
increase did not, however, occur among adults who were
Hispanic or nonwhite (Table 3).
Antipsychotic use was substantially more common in
visits to psychiatrists than nonpsychiatrists (Table 4).
Among visits to psychiatrists, antipsychotic use increased
significantly more rapidly in visits by youths than adults.
By 2005-2009, a similar proportion of youth and adult vis-
its to psychiatrists included an antipsychotic medication.
Amarkedincreasealsooccurredinantipsychoticuseamong
visits by youths to nonpsychiatrist physicians.
Throughout the study period, antipsychotic use was
prevalent in visits by youths and adults with psychotic dis-
order diagnoses. There was a particularly marked in-
crease in antipsychotics in visits by youths with mood dis-
order diagnoses. By 2005-2009, almost one-third of youth
visits with a mood disorder diagnosis (31.3%) included an
antipsychotic medication. A smaller, though nevertheless
significant, increase also occurred in antipsychotic use by
adult visits with mood disorder diagnoses. By contrast, an-
tipsychotic use visits with anxiety disorder diagnoses in-
creasedinaroughlyparallelmanneramongyouthandadult
visits (interaction P=.66) (Table 4).
CHARACTERISTICS OF CHILD, ADOLESCENT,
AND ADULT ANTIPSYCHOTIC VISITS
In 2005-2009, several differences were evident in the
demographic and clinical characteristics of antipsy-
chotic visits by children, adolescents, and adults
(Table 5). Male patients predominated among child and
adolescent antipsychotic visits, while female patients pre-
dominated among adult antipsychotic visits. This was par-
tiallyexplainedbyapredominanceofmalepatients(80.3%
[95% CI, 73.8-85.4]) among child and adolescent anti-
psychotic visits with disruptive behavior disorders and
a predominance of female patients (67.9% [95% CI, 63.6-
71.6]) among adult antipsychotic visits with mood dis-
orders (data not shown). Not surprisingly, schizophre-
nia, bipolar disorder, and depression accounted for a
considerably larger percentage of adult than child anti-
psychotic visits, while disruptive behavior and develop-
mental disorders accounted for a greater proportion of
child than adult antipsychotic visits. Visits without a men-
tal disorder diagnoses accounted for roughly one-third
of adult antipsychotic visits. In a post hoc analysis, 96.5%
of the adult antipsychotic visits without mental disor-
ders were to nonpsychiatrist physicians, and 33.7% in-
cluded a quetiapine fumarate prescription (data not
shown).

During 2005-2009, antidepressants and anxiolytics
were more often prescribed in adult antipsychotic visits
than in child and adolescent antipsychotic visits, while
the reverse was true of stimulants. Mood stabilizers were
prescribed in roughly one-quarter of adolescent and adult
antipsychotic visits, but only about 1 in 10 child anti-
psychotic visits (Table 5).
Only a small proportion of child and adolescent an-
tipsychotic visits included an FDA clinical indication
(Table 5). For child antipsychotic visits without an FDA
indication, the 3 most common specific mental disorder
diagnoses were attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder
(17.0%), oppositional defiant disorder (11.3%), and dis-
ruptive behavior disorder not otherwise specified (10.5%).
The corresponding diagnoses for adolescent antipsy-
chotic visits were bipolar disorder not otherwise speci-
fied (14.9%), anxiety disorder not otherwise specified
(12.6%), and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder
(11.4%), and, for adults, the 3 most common diagnoses
in antipsychotic visits without an FDA indication were
anxiety disorder not otherwise specified (17.7%), de-
pression not otherwise specified (10.9%), and bipolar dis-
order not otherwise specified (10.3%) (data not shown).
An evaluation by physician specialty revealed that,
compared with visits to psychiatrists, visits to nonpsy-
chiatrist physicians by youths and adults that included
antipsychotic medications were more likely not to in-
clude a mental disorder diagnosis. As a result, antipsy-
chotic visits to psychiatrists were far more likely than those
to nonpsychiatrists to include several specific mental dis-
order diagnoses. For example, a significantly larger per-
centage of youth and adult visits to psychiatrists than non-
psychiatrists included a bipolar diagnosis. As compared
with antipsychotic visits to psychiatrists, antipsychotic
visits to nonpsychiatrists were also significantly less likely
to be for an FDA-approved indication. Only a small mi-
nority of youth and adult antipsychotic visits to nonpsy-
chiatrists included an FDA-approved indicated diagno-
sis (Table 6).
INDIVIDUAL ANTIPSYCHOTIC MEDICATIONS
The frequency distribution of antipsychotic medica-
tions varied across the 3 age groups (2005-2009). Among
adult antipsychotic visits, the most commonly pre-
scribed drugs were quetiapine (32.6%) followed by ris-
peridone (16.9%), olanzapine (15.2%), and aripip-
razole (13.8%). For adolescent visits, aripiprazole (29.0%),
quetiapine (26.8%), risperidone (23.0%), and olanza-
pine (9.3%) were the 4 most common medications.
Among child antipsychotic visits, the most commonly pre-
scribed drugs were risperidone (42.1%), aripiprazole

tion of adult (11.9%) than child (1.3%) or adolescent
(1.8%) antipsychotic medications (data not shown).
COMMENT
Antipsychotic treatment in office-based practice has in-
creased for children, adolescents, and adults. Com-
pared with children and adolescents, adults make a sub-
stantially larger number of per capita office-based visits
that include antipsychotic prescriptions. Increasing an-
tipsychotic use by adults has also been reported from sev-
eral other industrialized countries, although trends among
youths have not been studied outside the United States.38
When considered in the narrower context of US office-
based care, antipsychotic treatment has increased more
rapidly among youths than adults. By 2005-2009, anti-
psychotics were prescribed in roughly equal propor-
tions of youth and adult visits to psychiatrists. Yet im-
portant differences exist in antipsychotic use across age
groups. Although antipsychotic treatment of adults is con-
centrated among female patients and patients diag-
nosed with bipolar disorder, depression, or schizophre-
nia, antipsychotic treatment of children and adolescents
predominantly involves male patients and is common
among patients with disruptive behavior disorders.
Most of the youth and adult antipsychotic visits did
not include a diagnosis for which the antipsychotic had
FDA approval for the patient age group. The strength of
evidence supporting efficacy for these "off-label" condi-
tions varies considerably across psychiatric disorders and
individual antipsychotics.18 Almost two-thirds of child
antipsychotic visits in 2005-2009 included a disruptive
behavior disorder diagnosis, and there are currently no
FDA-approved medications for the treatment of disrup-
tive disorders. Across all child visits during this period,
risperidone was by far the most commonly prescribed an-
tipsychotic. Uncertainty surrounds the appropriate role
of risperidone and other antipsychotic medications in the

management of disruptive behavior disorders. Al-
though some have urged greater caution in the treat-
ment of disruptive behavior disorders with antipsy-
chotic medications given their uncertain effects on
cognitive, social, and physical development,39 others note
that risperidone tends to be well tolerated and benefi-
cial for conduct disorder and other disruptive behavior
disorders, particularly when there are problematic ag-
gressive behaviors.40,41 Randomized clinical trials pro-
vide evidence of efficacy in the treatment of aggressive
youths with subaverage intelligence,41-43 although dis-
continuation related to lack of continued efficacy may
be considerable over the longer term.43
Antipsychotic treatment in youth mood disorder vis-
its increased especially rapidly during the study period.
By 2005-2009, youth mood disorders visits, which were
mostly for bipolar disorder, were more likely than their
adult counterparts to include an antipsychotic medica-
tion. This pattern is consistent with pooled analyses in-
dicating that the effect size of antipsychotics for bipolar
mania, especially compared with mood stabilizers, is larger
for youths than adults.44 The trend in the prescribing of
antipsychotics to youths occurred within the context of
a dramatic increase in the clinical diagnoses of bipolar
disorder among young people.11,45 Concern exists, how-
ever, over the accuracy of community diagnoses of bi-
polar disorder in children and adolescents.46,47
A greater proportion of adult antipsychotic visits than
child or adolescent antipsychotic visits do not include a
diagnosed mental disorder. This is largely attributable to
the proportionately greater role of nonpsychiatrist phy-
sicians in the treatment of adults with antipsychotics than
in the treatment of young people. Nearly all of the adult
antipsychotic visits without mental disorder diagnoses
were provided by nonpsychiatrist physicians. Primary care
physicians and other nonpsychiatrists sometimes delib-
erately mask their patients' mental health problems to
minimize stigma, to prevent adverse legal or occupa-
tional consequences associated with seeking mental health
treatment,48 or to capture more health plan benefits than
would be available by providing mental health treat-
ment.49 Because patient and physician identities are pro-
tected in the NAMCS, however, deliberately withhold-
ing mental disorder diagnoses from the survey data is
unlikely to be widespread. The considerable degree to
which antipsychotics are prescribed to adults and, to a
lesser extent, young people without concomitant psy-
chiatric diagnoses calls for further examination. It is pos-
sible that some of these patients have been treated with
antipsychotic medications for an extended period of time
and that, at the time of the survey visit, they were expe-
riencing few psychiatric symptoms. Because the survey
form captures only up to 3 diagnoses per visit, it may also
not enumerate all mental disorder diagnoses. Alterna-
tively, some physicians may prescribe quetiapine or other
antipsychotics for insomnia,50 agitation,51 or other symp-
toms that do not rise to the threshold of a mental disorder.
Researchonracial/ethnicvariationinantipsychotictreat-
ment has largely, but not exclusively,52 focused on pa-
tients with schizophrenia53-56 or bipolar disorder.57,58 The
present findings offer a somewhat broader perspective on
trends in antipsychotic use by white and nonwhite pa-

tients. Nonwhite adults stand out from the other age-racial/
ethnic groups as not experiencing a significant increase in
antipsychotic treatment during the study period. This pat-
tern is consistent with evidence that adult African Ameri-
cans and Hispanics are less likely than white adults to find
psychotropic medications acceptable.59,60 The roughly par-
allel increase in antipsychotic use among nonwhite youths
and white youths during the study period is broadly con-
sistent with research indicating that the race/ethnicity of
adultsisnotstronglyrelatedtotheirwillingnesstogivepsy-
chiatric medications to their children.61,62
Several factors may account for the increase in anti-
psychotic treatment within office-based practice. One fac-
tor may be the availability of new antipsychotics, includ-
ing olanzapine (1997), quetiapine (1997), ziprasidone
hydrochloride (2001), aripiprazole (2002), and paliperi-
done (2006), during the study period. Food and Drug
Administration approval of antipsychotics to treat bipo-
lar disorder, schizophrenia, and irritability associated with
autistic disorder in youths, as well as various FDA ap-
provals of adult indications, may also contribute to the
increase in antipsychotic treatment. Clinical trials40 and
clinical practice guidelines63 supporting antipsychotic use
for youths outside of FDA-approved indications may have
encouraged antipsychotic treatment of young people. The
previously mentioned increase in the community diag-
nosis of bipolar disorder in young people, as well as in-
creasing diagnosis of autism spectrum disorders,64,65 may
have also played a role. Furthermore, lower rates of acute
and chronic extrapyramidal adverse effects with second-
generation antipsychotics compared with first-
generation antipsychotics66 may also have increased the
general ease of prescribing antipsychotics to vulnerable
pediatric patients, even despite generally greater weight
gain and metabolic risk with the newer agents.9,17 The
proliferation of behavioral managed care67 and the at-
tendant limitations on psychotherapy reimbursement68
may further shift practice toward psychopharmacologi-
cal management.69 Cultural factors may also be at work,
including a lessening of the stigma associated with men-
tal health care, which is especially pronounced among
young adults,70 and greater public acceptance of psycho-
tropic medications.60 Pharmaceutical marketing,71 in-
cluding the promotion of off-label use,72 likely also con-
tributes to community antipsychotic prescribing practices.
Finally, some patients may respond but not remit to evi-
dence-based treatments, and, as a result, physicians en-
deavor to achieve remission by using antipsychotics as
an adjunctive treatment.73,74
Theseanalyseshaveseveralimportantlimitations.First,
the NAMCS samples visits rather than patients. Because
an unknown quantity of patient duplication occurs and
because patients may make several visits to several phy-
sicians each year, it is not possible to derive from the sur-
vey data an estimate of the number of unique people who
are treated in office-based practice with antipsychotic
medications each year. However, because each physi-
cian is randomly assigned to 1 of 52 weeks in the survey
year, this duplication is likely to have only a limited ef-
fect on national estimates of unduplicated visits. Sec-
ond, diagnoses in the NAMCS are based on the indepen-
dent judgment of the treating physician, rather than
research diagnostic interviews. Some primary care phy-
sicians may rely on diagnoses made by psychiatrists or
other mental health specialists. Third, information is not
available concerning dosages and duration of the anti-
psychotic medications. Dosages of antipsychotics for
youths with disruptive behavioral disorders are likely to
be considerably lower than that for youths with schizo-
phrenia and other psychotic disorders.75 In addition, some
patients with FDA-indicated disorders may receive sub-
therapeutic antipsychotic doses.76 Fourth, physician non-
response may have biased the observed pattern of anti-
psychotic prescribing. Fifth, sample size limitations
constrain efforts to evaluate the independence of asso-
ciations between patient characteristics and provision of
antipsychotic treatment. Sixth, since 2009, several de-
velopments, such as the approval of new antipsychotics
(including asenapine [2009], lurasidone [2010], and ilo-
peridone [2010]), labeling revisions strengthening the
metabolic risk section regarding hyperglycemia and dia-
betes, dyslipidemia, and weight gain, and new practice
guidelines,77 may have influenced antipsychotic prescrib-
ing patterns. Finally, the sample is restricted to office-
based visits and therefore does not capture visits to com-
munity mental health centers, hospital outpatient clinics,
or various other outpatient settings, nor does it capture
visits to inpatient settings where mental health care is pro-
vided. In 2009, for example, there were approximately
54.8 million total antipsychotic prescriptions in the United
States,78 of which approximately 18.9 million (34.5%)
were from office-based settings included in the NAMCS
scope. For these reasons, the population-based results
should not be interpreted as representing population-
wide antipsychotic use.
In summary, over a 17-year period, antipsychotic medi-
cations became more commonly used in office-based prac-
tice. The increase, which has been broad-based, has been
especially concentrated among children and adolescents,
particularly among youths diagnosed with mood disor-
dersandthosetreatedbynonpsychiatristphysicians.Asub-
stantial majority of child antipsychotic visits are for young
peoplediagnosedwithdisruptivebehaviordisorders.Inlight
of known safety concerns and uncertainty over long-term
risks and benefits, these trends may signal a need to re-
evaluate clinical practice patterns and strengthen efforts to
educatephysicians,especiallyprimarycarephysicians,con-
cerningtheknownsafetyandefficacyofantipsychoticmedi-
cations. At the same time, a new generation of clinical trials
is needed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of antipsy-
chotic medications in conditions for which they are com-
monly prescribed but for which the evidence base re-
mains underdeveloped.
