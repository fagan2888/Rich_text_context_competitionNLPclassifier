Abstract
Background: Herpes simplex virus (HSV) is among the most common sexually transmitted pathogens in the United States
and worldwide. HSV has a high incidence of undetected cases. In addition, there is no treatment, and there is a lack of
knowledge why disparities among populations exist. Research studies suggest that fat tissue may participate in body's
immune responses, and the impact of obesity on susceptibility to HSV1 infection is not clear. The purpose of this study was
to examine whether obesity is a risk factor for HSV1 infection using a large sample from the general population.
Methods/Principal Findings: This cross-sectional study used data from the National Health and Examination and Nutritional
Examination Survey (NHANES) from 2007­2008. Variables, gender, age, race/ethnicity, marital status, education, poverty
level, and diabetes represented potential confounders and were included in analyses. The two-tailed Pearson's chi square,
student's t test, and a multiple logistic regression analysis were applied to evaluate associations using a significance value of
p#0.05. Adjusted odds ratios with 95% confidence interval represented the degree of these associations. The prevalence of
HSV1 infection in US population between 20 and 49 years old was 60.3% (n = 1,536). In this study, having a BMI classified as
the obese group (BMI 30­39.9) was significantly associated with HSV1 infection before [unadjusted OR = 1.74 (95% CI 1.20­
2.51), p = 0.006] and after controlling for socio-demographic factors [adjusted OR = 1.50 (95%CI 1.06­2.13)], p = 0.026]. This
association was stronger than three already established risk factors of age, female gender, and poverty level.
Conclusions/Significance: This study provides evidence that obesity may play a role in the susceptibility to HSV1 infection.
Findings from this study suggest that obesity should be considered when designing preventive measures for HSV1
infection. These results may also explain why some people acquire HSV1 infections and some do not. Further, these findings
may justify an increased emphasis on the control and prevention of HSV1 transmission and other pathogens in overweight
and obese populations.

Introduction
HSV is an intracellular pathogen that can affect the skin of
multiple parts of the body including anogenital region, mouth,
eyes, nervous system, and various major organs [1,2,3]. HSV is
contagious and humans are the only known reservoir [4].
HSV belongs to a family of Herpesviridae, subfamily Alpha-
herpesvirinae. HSV is a fairly large, enveloped virus containing a
double stranded DNA encoding for more than 80 proteins,
including enzymes directly involved in binding to cells, fusion,
synthesis, and replication. HSV usually infects epithelial mucosal
cells, in which viruses replicate. The replicated virus follows nerve
cells and usually settles in the trigeminal ganglia or sacral ganglia
where it can become dormant. The dormant virus can be
reactivated at any time by various stressors including sun, fever, or
psychological stress [4]. Reactivated virus can travel back to the
original point of entry and repeat the cycle.
HSV triggers cell mediated immune response, which peaks
between 7 to 14 days after infection, then declines and reaches
constant levels after 1 or 2 months [5,6]. The symptoms may be
mild and not obvious to the carrier and for this reason, HSV
infections may often be unrecognized. It has been documented
that HSV infection may allow entry of other pathogens (e.g.,
Human Immunodeficiency Virus), and the infected person may
also be at higher risk for diseases including bacterial vaginosis,
oropharyngeal cancer, cardiovascular diseases (CVD), and meta-
bolic disorders [4,7,8,9]. HSV has the ability to ``trick'' the body's
immune system by binding Immunoglobulin Gamma (IgG), which
enables the virus to go unnoticed, leading to persistent and
recurrent infections [10]. As it is extremely difficult to rid the body
of this infection, the condition is a chronic one.
HSV is usually transmitted via direct contact with infected
discharge from blisters, and the primary infection may occur at
any stage of life. HSV are commonly divided into two primary
subtypes, HSV1 and HSV2, and these subtypes can be
distinguished antigenically [10]. Although both types can cause
infections around the mouth or the genital region, it is estimated
that more than 90% of oral infections (e.g., lips, mouth, tongue, or
PLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 May 2011 | Volume 6 | Issue 5 | e19092
pharynx) are caused by HSV1, and HSV2 is usually transmitted
through sexual contact [4,11]. Recently, and in contrast to this
established pattern, public health authorities have started noticing
a shift in the prevalence of genital herpes caused by HSV1 in some
populations [12,13], and certain geographic locations [12,14]. It
has been hypothesized that this shift could be a result of a change
in sexual practices (e.g., more common oral sex) and/or increased
incidence of using condoms to prevent HSV2 transmission [13];
however, further research will be needed to confirm these theories.
The shift in HSV ratio may have serious consequences. For
example, mothers infected during pregnancy or delivery can
expose their newborn babies to the risk for developing neonatal
herpes infection, which often leads to neurologic disorders or
death [15,16]. Findings from one epidemiological study on the
prevalence of HSV in Canada indicated that more than 60% of
newborns with HSV were caused by HSV1. This finding suggests
that without effective preventive programs we may see an increase
in this type of transmission. The transmission may occur
prenatally, perinatally and after the birth; therefore, the emphasis
on prevention may be especially important in young women and
mothers [17]. A recently noted change in the HSV1/HSV2 ratio
(i.e., increase in HSV1 and decrease in HSV2) in some
populations suggests that new epidemics could be evolving [13].
There is no effective treatment for HSV infection, and preventive
measures currently used are inefficient [18]. The identification of
all risk factors involved in HSV1 prevalence is essential to alleviate
the burden of HSV infection.
Epidemiological studies indicate that obese and overweight
people are at higher risk for postoperative infections and mortality
associated with infections [19,20]. The increased seropositivity for
specific pathogens has been identified in obese individuals [21,22].
For example, the association of adenovirus-36 with obesity in
humans and animals has been well documented [23,24]. Other
infectious agents including Chlamydia pneumoniae (Cpn) and Helico-
bacter pylori (Hp) have been also suggested to be associated with
obesity [25,26]. However, the association with other pathogens,
such as HSV1, still needs to be evaluated. The aim of this study
was to determine whether obesity is a potential risk factor for
HSV1 infection.
Methods
This cross-sectional study used NHANES data from 2007­
2008. NHANES data were collected by the National Center for
Health Statistics (NCHS) and are publicly accessible at http://
www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/nhanes2007-2008/nhanes07_08.htm
[27]. A total of 12,943 participants were included in the NHANES
2007­2008. Among those participants, 3,364 individuals were
tested for HSV1 antibodies. After excluding 3 participants from
HSV1 testing, 3,361 participants for HSV1 had a known HSV1
serostatus. Only participants between 20 and 49 years of age who
had complete records for all tested variables were included in the
analyses and the final sample size used for analyses was 2,546.
In this study, HSV1 infection represented by seroprevalence
(positive, negative) was a dependent variable, and body mass index
representing the degree of obesity status (BMI,25 for normal
weight, BMI = 25­29 for overweight, BMI 30­39.9 for obese and
BMI.40 for severely obese). Age, gender, race/ethnicity marital
status, poverty level, and diabetes were used as covariates. The
differences between groups for the continuous variable, age, was
tested by student's t test. All other variables were categorized, and
the differences between groups were tested by Pearson's chi-square
test. Multivariate logistic regression was used to examine the
association between the dependent variable, HSV1 infection, and
independent variable before and after the adjustment for possible
confounding factors. Odds ratios with 95% confidence interval
were used to represent associations and p values less than 0.05 was
considered statistically significant.
Determination of HSV infection
The dependent variables for this study were seropositivity with
HSV1. To determine serostatus, eligible study subjects provided a
blood sample at the mobile examination center. Blood serum was
sent for further processing to Emory University, where laboratory
experts used enzymatic immunodot assay (EIA) to detect specific
antibodies.
Determination of Obesity status
The independent variable for this study was obesity status
representated by Body mass index (BMI). During NHANES data
collection, the body weight and height measurements were
performed by trained technician using calibrated equipment.
The body mass index was calculated by dividing weight (kg) by
height (m2). In this study, BMI was divided into four categories;
BMI,25 was considered normal weight, BMI = 25­29 was
considered overweight, BMI 30­39.9 was considered obese and
BMI.40 was considered severely obese.
Determination of Covariates
Other variables were obtained from NHANES questionnaire
and, except for age, were also divided into categories. In all
analyses, age was treated as a continuous variable. All respondents
over age of 20 were asked ``Other than during pregnancy, have
you ever been told by a doctor or other health professional that
you have diabetes or sugar diabetes?''. For the purposes of this
study, the participants who answered yes or bordeline were
considered diabetic; participants who answered no were consid-
ered nondiabetic. The highest educational level of participants was
based on the response to:``What is the highest grade or level of
school you have completed or the highest degree you have
received?''. To be consistent with associated literature, the
education levels were divided into 3 categories ``Less than high
school'', ``High school graduate/GED'' and ``Higher''.
Gender was assigned as ``Male'' and ``Female''. In this study,
the marital status was divided into two categories; single and
married. The category ``single'' included widowed, divorced,
separated, never married responses and ``married'' included
married and living with a partner responses.
The race/ethnicity category was determined from the question
asked by the interviewer ``What race do you consider yourself to
be?''. The categories used in this study were as follows; Non
Hispanic White, Non Hispanic Black, Mexican American, and
Other race/ethnicities.
The poverty level was based on poverty income ratio (PIR)
included in the questionnaire. PIR was determined based on the
most accurate estimate for family income per year and family size.
In this study, the poverty level was categorized as follows; PIR,1
was labeled as poor and PIR$1 was considered as not poor.
Statistical Analysis
All data management and analyses were performed using
STATA 11.0 software [28]. The downloaded data were checked
for integrity before and after merging. NHANES uses a complex
study design that requires the use of weighted methodology and
proper clustering during the analytical process [27]. To address
issues of unequal probabilities of selection and modification for
missing responses, appropriate weight variables (i.e., wtmec2yr,
Herpes Simplex Virus 1 and Obesity
PLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 2 May 2011 | Volume 6 | Issue 5 | e19092
sdmvstra, and sdmvpsu) were used in all statistical analyses. These
weight variables were generated by NHANES in order the sample
to represent the U.S. civilian non institutionalized Census
population [27].
Bivariate analyses were performed to evaluate descriptive
characteristics of the study participants and to evaluate dependent
and independent variables. The bivariate analyses were performed
for the association of HSV1 and the independent variable, body mass
index (normal, overweight, obese and severely obese), and possible
covariates, such as age (continuous), gender (male and female), race/
ethnicity (Non Hispanic White, Non Hispanic Black, Mexican
American, and Others), education level (less than high school, high
school/GED, higher than high school), diabetes (yes, no), poverty
level (poor, not poor), and marital status (single, married). Means and
standard deviations were used to represent continuous variables and
proportions were used to represent categorical variables. The
Pearson's chi square (categorical) and student's t test (continuous)
were selected to determine the relationship between two variables.
The difference was considered significant when p#0.05.
Multivariate logistic regression was used to examine the
association between the dependent variable HSV infection and
independent variables before and after the adjustment for possible
confounding factors. The association between variables was
represented by odds ratios with 95% confidence interval and p
values less or equal to 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Ethics Statement
The NCHS strictly comply with several laws and regulation
addressing participant's confidentiality. Prior to data collection for
NHANES, NCHS obtained an approval from NCHS Research
Ethics Review Board (formerly the Institute Review Board) [27].
Results
Table 1 characterizes the study sample. The prevalence of HSV1
infection in U.S. population between 2007 and 2008 was 60.3%
(n = 1,536). The average age of participants with HSV1 infection
was 36.160.28. Approximately 62.0% of the females surveyed were
HSV1 positive, as were 54.6% of NonHispanic Whites, 63.4% of
Non-Hispanic Blacks, 81.1% of Mexican Americans, and 69.0% of
individuals who identified themselves as from other racial/ethnic
group tested positive for HSV1. Further, 75.3% individuals who
had education less than high school, 68.6% who had high school
diploma, 52.0% who had higher than High school education,
56.9% of individuals who were single, 62.3% who were married,
68.9% who were classified as poor, 55.6% who were classified above
poverty level, 68.9% who reported to be diagnosed with diabetes,
and 60.3% who reported not being diagnosed with diabetes also
tested positive for HSV1. Age, race/ethnicity, education, marital
status and poverty level tested statistically significant (p,0.05).
Table 2 provides data on the distribution of BMI of the participants
by status of HSV1 infection using bivariate analysis. The average
BMI in HSV1 positive individuals was 28.660.24 and the average
BMI in HSV negative individuals was 27.660.29. The difference in
BMI between HSV1 positive and HSV1 negative groups tested
significant (p = 0.009) by Pearson's Chi square test. The BMI group
with the highest percentage of seropositives was in the obese group,
or those people with a BMI of 30 to 39.9.
The logistic regression analysis was used to examine the
relationship between the main independent variable (BMI) and
HSV1 infection before and after controlling for confounding
variables (Table 3). The bivariate logistic regression analysis
demonstrated that BMI of 30­39.9 was significantly associated

with HSV1 infection [unadjusted OR = 1.74 (95% CI 1.20­2.51),
p = 0.006]. When BMI was used in the full model, the multivariate
logistic regression revealed that the BMI for the obese group (BMI
of 30­39.9) continued to be significantly associated with HSV1
infection in the U.S. population aged 20­49 years [adjusted
OR = 1.50 (95% CI 1.06­2.13), p = 0.026] even after the
adjustment for the independent variables of age, gender, race/
ethnicity, marital status, education, and PIR. The relationship for
overweight (BMI of 25­29.9) and for severely obese (BMI of .40)
groups was not significant (p.0.05).
Additionally, unadjusted and adjusted odds ratios were obtained
for covariates (Table 3). Results from the multivariate logistic
regression analysis suggest that covariates, such as age [adjusted
OR = 1.40 (95%CI 1.20­1.63], female gender [adjusted
OR = 1.25 (95%CI 1.00­1.57], race [NH Black adjusted
OR = 1.38 (95%CI 1.03­1.84), Mexican American adjusted
OR = 2.90 (95%CI 1.92­4.35), Other adjusted OR = 1.84
(95%CI 1.26­2.70)], education[Lower than high school adjusted
OR = 2.07 (95%CI 1.52­2.81), High school/GED adjusted
OR = 1.95 (95% CI 1.38­2.76)], and being poor [adjusted
OR = 1.37 (95%CI 1.05­1.78)] were significantly associated with
HSV1 infection (p,0.05). The relationship did not test significant
for marital status (p = 0.16).
Discussion
This quantitative, cross-sectional study was the first to explore
whether obesity plays a role in the distribution of HSV1 infection
in the U.S. population using data from a national survey. The
results from this study indicate that obesity could play an
important role in identifying a high risk population for HSV1
infection as having a BMI in the classification ``obese'' (BMI 30­
39.9) was significantly associated with HSV1 infection before
[unadjusted OR = 1.74 (95% CI 1.20­2.51), p = 0.006] and after
adjusted OR = 1.50 (95% CI 1.06­2.13)], p = 0.0026] controlling
for socio-demographic factors. This means that obese persons were
1.5 times more likely to be infected with HSV1 when compared to
infected persons with normal weight. An odds ratio of 1.5
corresponds to a relationship of medium strength and therefore
the odds of being obese are stronger than such other already
established risk factors, as age (adjusted OR = 1.40), PIR (adjusted
OR = 1.37) and female gender (adjusted OR = 1.25). This finding
suggests that a BMI of 30­39.9 could be a significant factor in the
susceptibility to HSV and could potentially be used as an indicator
for susceptibility to HSV1 infection.
Findings in this study are consistent with findings that suggested
a correlation between body fat and HSV1 titer (p = 0.038) [21].
This study is also consistent with studies that propose HSV1 as a
significant risk factor for metabolic disorders and cardiovascular
diseases, in which BMI was a major predictor [7,29 30,31]. Since
obesity is also a major risk factor for these disorders, it is possible
that obesity could be a link between HSV1 and metabolic and
cardiovascular disorders.
The association of obesity and HSV1 could possibly be
explained by predisposition to the altered production of hormones

Herpes Simplex Virus 1 and Obesity

involved in metabolism in obese people that could lead to a change
in immune responses. This theory is consistent with findings from
several studies which indicate that a dysfunction in the production
of hormones involved in metabolism (e.g., leptin) alter immune
system responses [32,33,34]. Other studies suggest that obesity
may be linked to an increased level of herpes virus entry mediators
(HVEM), which could potentially increase viral entry [35].
However, due to data limitations with the data, this theory will
need to be evaluated further when hormonal and HVEM levels
are available.
The multivariate logistic analysis did not reveal a significant
association between severe obesity and HSV1 infection (p = 0.79).
This finding is not consistent with a dose-response relationship
between body fat and HSV1 titer found in different study [21].
However, because there were only 6.6% of persons with severe
obesity in the sample, it is possible that the relationship could be
detected when using a larger sample size.
The relationship was not found to be significant for overweight
group (BMI 25­29.9), which suggests that higher level of obesity
may be necessary to show the relationship. This is consistent with
findings that HSV1 titer increases with fat mass [21]. Future
research could examine contributing factors. For example, the
distribution of body fat in the body has been shown to contribute
to the effects for metabolic disorders [36]. Therefore, it is possible
that such factors could possibly play a role in the association of
BMI and the susceptibility to HSV1.
Viral infections have been shown to induce inflammatory
responses [5] and adipose tissue was shown to released hormones
that have been linked to susceptibility to infection in animals and
humans [30,37]. Therefore, it is plausible that obese people could
be more susceptible to HSV1 infections. This study provides some
exciting findings, however more studies will be necessary to
examine why this association was not seen in overweight
individuals and persons who were morbidly obese.
Research reports indicate that genital HSV1 is now being
identified more frequently and the HSV1/HSV2 ratio is reversing
[3,13]. Therefore, the awareness and preventive measures against
HSV1 transmission will need to be emphasized. Preventive efforts
should mainly focus on prenatal screening, development of
effective vaccines, and establishing a surveillance program to
monitor the effectiveness of implemented preventive measures.
These results also suggest that preventive measures should be
focused on Mexican Americans. One way to prevent mother-child
transmission is to incorporate screening programs into prenatal
care. Serological screening for HSV antibodies in the mother and
her partner could help to plan for appropriate strategies during the
delivery and implementing effective counseling. In addition,
surveillance programs will need to be developed to monitor the
trends and the effectiveness of preventive measures.
Another preventive strategy that could be implemented should
focus on the development of effective vaccines against HSV.
Currently, vaccines focusing on minimizing of virus shedding are
being evaluated [38]. However, more effective vaccines that would
prevent HSV acquisition should be developed. The use of
preventive vaccine would be beneficial especially for young
population, women and obese individuals since they appear to
be most vulnerable to HSV infection.
Preventive measures should continue to focus on modification of
behavior and improved personal hygiene to minimize the
transmission of HSV. Education about the virus transmission
and safe sexual practices were demonstrated to be effective
[39,40]. These measures should be emphasized in younger
population and the development of preventive measures should
be implemented for the most vulnerable population including
persons with weight problems and women.
This study had several limitations. First, the design of this study
was cross-sectional; therefore, the study does not provide evidence
for a causal relationship. On the other hand, this study used the
most recent data, which provides the latest prevalence estimates on
both HSV1 infection and obesity in the United States. Second,
only adults between 20 and 49 years old were used in this study,
therefore, results from this study cannot be extended to younger or
older populations. Third, in this study, HSV1 status was
determined based on the detection of antibodies in blood samples
and serological evaluation was not able to determine whether the
infection was acute and where the infection was located in the
body. However, the serological test was able to detect positive
cases that were symptomatic and could identify people who were
not aware of being infected with HSV1 [4]. This serological
detection may provide more accurate estimates of infected
individuals.
Conclusion
In this study, individuals who were obese exhibited a higher
prevalence of HSV1 infection when compared to individuals with
normal weight. Women and individuals with racial/ethnic
background, other than non Hispanic White, were at higher risk
for HSV1 infections and should be the primary target for
interventions.
The prevalence of HSV1 was slightly higher that previously
reported. New preventive efforts should mainly focus on prenatal
screening, development of effective vaccines, and establishing a
surveillance program to monitor the effectiveness of implemented
preventive measures. Preventive programs should continue to
concentrate on modification of negative behaviors and on the
improvement of personal hygiene to minimize the transmission of
HSV1.
