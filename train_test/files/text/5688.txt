Article
Hospital executives are key stakeholders in the hospital
setting because of their considerable "administrative knowl-
edge, clinical experience, and authority to effect change"
(Song et al., 2010). With the aging of the population, provi-
sion of end-of-life (EOL) care has become a critical issue for
these executives. Nearly 40% (~ 1,000,000/year) of all
deaths occur in acute care settings, and 20% (~500,000/year)
involve intensive care services prior to death (Angus et al.,
2004; Lin, Farrell, Lave, Angus, & Barnato, 2009; Nelson
et al., 2006). Many older adults experience prolonged hospi-
tal stays and invasive procedures before death, and these
numbers are likely to increase.
Consensus documents, position statements, practice guide-
lines, and initiatives of professional organizations have sug-
gested that palliative care and hospice services have a positive
impact on quality of life and prevention of suffering at EOL
(Brumley et al., 2007; Greer & Mor, 1986; Higginson & Sen-
Gupta, 2000; Rickerson, Harrold, Kapo, Carroll, & Casarett,
2005; Teno et al., 2004; Teno et al., 2007; Wright et al., 2010).
Cooney, Landers, and Williams (Ahalt et al., 2012) have char-
acterized hospital executive leadership as a "critical compo-
nent" for changing EOL care. However, despite extensive
medical and nursing literature on the importance of EOL care
in hospitals, little is known about hospital executives' per-
ceptions of the provision of EOL care in their facilities.
Without a better understanding of these key stakeholders'
views, effective implementation and management of EOL
care in the acute care setting is not likely.

Abstract
Hospital executives are key stakeholders in the hospital setting. However, despite extensive medical and nursing literature on
the importance of end-of-life (EOL) care in hospitals, little is known about hospital executives' perceptions of the provision of
EOL care in their facilities. The objective of this study was to capture hospital executives' perceptions of the provision of EOL
care in the hospital setting. This descriptive, naturalistic phenomenological, qualitative study utilized in-person interviews to
explore executives' opinions and beliefs. The sample consisted of 14 individuals in the roles of medical center directors, chiefs
of staff, chief medical officers, hospital administrators, hospital risk managers, and regional counsel in Arkansas, Louisiana
and Texas. An interview guide was developed and conducted utilizing a global question followed by probes concerning
perceptions of EOL care provision. Hospital executives acknowledged that EOL care was a very important issue, and more
attention should be paid to it in the hospital setting. Their comments and suggestions for improvement focused on (a) current
EOL care, (b) barriers to changing EOL care, and (c) enhancing provision of EOL care in the hospital setting. The findings of
this study suggest that hospital executives although key change agents, may have insufficient EOL information to implement
steps toward cultural and infrastructural change and should therefore be included in any EOL discussions and education.

and describe phenomena critical to the understanding of
lived experiences (Morse & Field, 1995). This qualitative
method allowed us to explore executives' opinions and
beliefs more fully than might have been possible with other
approaches.
Overview and Setting
We recruited hospital executives, as they are the stakeholders
who have control over the availability, accessibility, and qual-
ity-of-health services and provide the environment in which
physicians, nurses, and other caregivers can practice EOL care
effectively and efficiently from the Veterans Health
Administration (VHA) and community medical centers in
Arkansas, Louisiana, and Texas. University and VHA institu-
tional review board approvals were obtained prior to the study.
We obtained written consent and addressed privacy protection
with participants prior to conducting the interviews.
Data Collection
An interview guide was developed based on the literature
and consultation with a qualitative expert, the fourth author
(J.C.M.), and a health services expert, the seventh author
(J.E.K.). Questions were pre-tested with two executives and
were found sufficient to evoke responses that included the
executives' perceptions of EOL care in their institution. All
interviews were conducted by the first author (K.K.G.) in
participants' facilities. The interview began with a global
question followed by probes (Morse & Field, 1995) concern-
ing his or her perceptions of EOL care provision. Interviews
lasted 0.75 to 1.5 hr and were audio recorded, transcribed
verbatim, and verified for accuracy. Hospital executives not
employed in the VHA system received a US$50 check for
participation.
Data Analysis
Transcripts were entered into Atlas-ti (Version 5.2, Scientific
Software Development, Berlin), a text-based data manage-
ment program that allows data labeling and sorting by identi-
fied variables. The interview data were coded using content
analysis, as described by Morse and Field (Morse & Field,
1995) in which a systematic, objective analysis of message
characteristics are identified, with constant comparison, or
continual analysis of data by comparing one interview to
another, in an iterative process (Glaser & Strauss, 1967). The
first author coded the initial three interviews, developed ten-
tative definitions for each code, and prepared a preliminary
codebook, and then the seventh author reviewed the code-
book and transcripts. Emerging codes and coding differences
were discussed until consensus was reached. The first author
repeated this process with all interview narratives, compar-
ing one to the next, and coded the remaining interviews.
Narratives were aggregated by similarity, forming categories
from the aggregates, and developing overarching themes of
the perceptions of the executives. After 14 interviews, con-
siderable repetition of data was identified, indicating data
saturation (Morse & Field, 1995).
Several techniques were used to maximize the validity
and reliability of the study, following guidelines for trust-
worthiness for qualitative studies (Lincoln & Guba, 1985).
Dependability was enhanced through the use of one inter-
viewer (K.K.G.) and one interview guide for all interviews.
In addition, verbatim transcription and thoroughly reviewing
the transcripts against the recorded interviews ensured valid-
ity. The first author enhanced credibility and confirmability
by keeping a detailed audit trail of coding, theoretical deci-
sions, and consensus with the health services expert.
Unedited examples of narrative were used to validate find-
ings. The separate coding by the two authors yielded strong
agreement (86%).
Results
Subjects
The sample consisted of 14 individuals in the roles of medi-
cal center directors, chiefs of staff, chief medical officers,
hospital administrators, hospital risk managers, and regional
counsel in Arkansas, Louisiana, and Texas. These executives
were responsible for services provided by hospitals with a
median bed number of 740, ranging from 277 to 1,299. They
had a mean age of 60 years (range = 46-68), and 57.1% of the
executives were male. There were 8 VHA (57.1%) and 6
community (42.9%) medical centers represented from met-
ropolitan statistical areas, which ranged from 150,000 to
well above 1,000,000. Out of concern for inadvertent disclo-
sure of the executives' identity, no further information about
the hospitals and locations is provided.
It was widely acknowledged by the executives that EOL
care was a very important issue and more attention should be
paid to it in the hospital setting. Their comments focused on
(a) current EOL care, (b) barriers to changing EOL care, and
(c) enhancing provision of EOL care in the hospital setting.
Current EOL Care
All the participants described EOL care as an important con-
cern for hospital executives; yet they gave different reasons
for its importance. For some, a major concern was the lack of
preparation that patients and families had regarding their
prospective needs for EOL care. The executives noted that
very serious and chronically ill patients arrived at the hospi-
tal without clearly defined goals of care and with potentially
unrealistic expectations for what the hospital was going to be
able to do for them. One executive said,
I mean you get patients here who are very sick and who may
have a low chance of survival to begin with, you get patients
Garner et al. 3
who are here thinking they're coming to the "Mecca" and they're
finally going to get the you know [the] "savior" that they've not
been able to get somewhere else . . . and quite frankly that can be
more than somewhat of a challenge . . .. (Interview 8)
Several executives expressed concern about the current
practice of avoiding or shifting EOL decision making to
patients and families who had little preparation and often low
literacy or personal barriers to making these difficult and
complex decisions. Another hospital executive said,
Physicians shift a lot of burden to families . . . especially when
the physician doesn't want to make a decision. And my basic
thought on that is that it's the physician's job, that's not generally
left to lay people. (Interview 12)
Because of current organizational and system processes,
health care providers frequently have little to no long-term
relationships with patients or their caregiver/families.
Another executive noted,
[The lack of a long-term relationship] is exacerbated by
hospitalists and intensivists and all these different roles, which
make a lot of sense . . . to have critical care people at the bedside
. . . What it now means though is when you're at your sickest
you're probably with somebody you know you've never met,
your family's never met, you know . . .. (Interview 2)
Barriers to Change
These hospital executives pointed to several difficulties in
providing quality EOL care in the hospital setting. Personnel
shortages in all areas of health care were frequently men-
tioned as barriers to effective EOL care. Lack of time to ade-
quately discuss EOL care with patients and families was also
frequently cited. The executives noted the significant amount
of time such discussions take and the increasing need for
these discussions along with ongoing shortages of health
care providers. In addition, many of the executives felt that
health care providers, even if they had adequate staffing and
were willing to engage in an EOL care discussions, did not
have the training to do so. One executive said,
We don't have enough physicians to do that with the elderly . . .
I mean golly there's so few physicians who are trained in that
area or have an interest in it, we have one physician that is very
good at these discussions . . . but it takes so much of her time and
she's patient and willing, but we don't have many physicians
like that. (Interview 7)
Another executive with medical training noted that it was
most difficult to have discussions with patients at the EOL
who expected treatment but for whom current medical treat-
ments would not be effective. He explained,
You know . . . I grew up in an environment where I had to learn,
learn, learn, but I never learned how to talk to somebody where
there's no hope . . . and I'm not equipped to have that kind of
conversation. (Interview 10)
In addition, executives noted that financial and care man-
agement restrictions result in a fragmented process of care,
with shorter inpatient stays and rapid transfers to lower lev-
els of care or outpatient management. One hospital executive
said,
Case management has been used so heavily to keep length of
stay short, make sure people get to the right level of care and
discharged timely. But how do you get to that other whole
population [patients at EOL] resourced early with a plan? I don't
think case management . . . has really shown us that they have
expanded their net in this arena yet. (Interview 10)
Changing EOL Care
The executives described many strategies to improve EOL
care in the hospital setting. Many indicated the need for a
champion at each facility. One executive said,
So if you have one or two who are leaders . . . either officially or
unofficially . . . on the medical staff who will say "no . . . this is
a valuable service . . . this is a valuable program . . . we need to
support it . . . we need to be open to it." That, I think is essential.
(Interview 7)
They also recognized the importance of their own role in
the process.
. . . even though the administrators often are not directly involved
with EOL care, the decisions made at the administrative level set
the tone . . . really . . . for the whole facility. (Interview 6)
The executives noted that EOL care, although critically
important for patients and for families, is essentially an unap-
preciated endeavor. However, many recognized a need for sus-
tained system changes, and they proposed the development of
outcome measures that recognize the provision of EOL care.
Who's out there saying today, you know, isn't it great that Dr.
"so and so" had four patients die comfortably in the proper way
with their family at their side? But you hear when so and so
finished a procedure in twelve minutes . . . I mean what do we
really recognize people for in medicine? (Interview 8)
In addition to outcome measures, the executives sug-
gested the development of a hospital infrastructure and sys-
tems to support EOL care:
I would say that we need to acknowledge our limitations today
and look for ways to strategically begin to look for statistical
projections to be able to develop a plan that addresses
infrastructure development of services over time. (Interview 1)
The executives suggested that this infrastructure should
include education; EOL care should not only be an essential
4 SAGE Open
component of current curricula but a part of continuing edu-
cation of the current health care force and the general
public:
I think a lot of it comes back to education and I don't know what
we're doing even in physician education to make people in
training aware of the needs that are out there and the programs
like palliative medicine that can be of benefit. I don't know, I'm
almost certain in our master's degree program in health
administration we're not teaching that. (Interview 7)
The executives also indicated a critical need to educate
the general public.
And a lot of that then you know the final thing is educating the
general public because so much of this is American culture. You
know this I want everything, every last thing done to me. I find it
interesting because most people, many people . . . with more of a
clinical background are like, uh, uh, I don't want that . . . I don't
want to be put through some of the things that you know we put
patients through. I don't think a lot of patients and their families
have those conversations, understand that, etc. and so we get
ourselves into those kinds of positions as well. (Interview 14)
Discussion
This is one of the first qualitative studies to examine a range
of hospital executives' perceptions on and experiences with
the provision of EOL care in acute care settings. It is clear
from the participants' accounts that a complex range of bar-
riers exist in the provision of EOL care. The responses of
hospital executives indicated that there is a need for focusing
efforts on EOL care, and they identified some potential strat-
egies to overcome barriers that were identified.
Hospital executives characterized current EOL care as
care in which the burden of decision making is commonly
shifted to families when patients become incapacitated at or
near the EOL. Often, health care providers demonstrated dis-
comfort with discussing palliative care with patients and their
families, which can delay or limit discussions. As noted by
Braun (Braun & McCullough, 2011), this can have dire con-
sequences because these are very difficult decisions, with an
emotional and socioeconomic overlay that most families are
poorly prepared to make. Our results concur with other litera-
ture that has found that with little or no guidance from the
patient, the family may have difficulty identifying and
expressing the patient's preferences rather than their own
(Braun & McCullough, 2011; Garner, Henager, Kirchner, &
Sullivan, 2011; Quill, 2000). In parallel with family uncer-
tainty and increasing dependence on the provider, others have
also suggested that providers may be paternalistic by guiding
the families toward their preferences, instead of the patients
(Breier-Mackie, 2001; Clark, 2012; Marik, Varon, Lisbon, &
Reich, 1999). The sometimes paternalistic view of the pro-
vider was not found to be a salient theme identified by hospi-
tal executives in this study. A prominent barrier identified in
this study was the lack of adequate time and training to pre-
pare patients and their families for the end of life, limit
unnecessary treatment, and focus care on achieving wishes
and improving quality of life. Hospital executives also noted
that a fragmented care process contributed to poor communi-
cation and barriers to effective EOL care. While lack of time
and training have been shown to be barriers to advanced care
planning in primary care, our findings, as well as others
(Meier, 2011), confirm that these constraints also affect acute
care providers. This may be additional area for case manag-
ers, who are often on the front lines of communicating with
and arranging discharges and transitions in care based on
these goals (Ahalt et al., 2012).
Some of the hospital executives in this study suggested
changes in communication about preferences at EOL. They
suggested that EOL care could be enhanced by linking case
management with interdisciplinary care to assist health care
providers in proactively establishing goals of care. Recent
research identified improved communication as a high prior-
ity, specifically regarding preferences of care at EOL (Sadler
et al., 2014). This research concluded that inadequate commu-
nication predicted family dissatisfaction with care. Case man-
agers could initiate palliative care assessments and
conversations about setting goals of care, even if only for the
current hospitalization. Identifying and communicating these
preferences with families and health care providers early in
care, before a patient becomes incapacitated, could enhance
the ability of health care providers to achieve a patient's
wishes, even if only for the duration of the current hospitaliza-
tion. These assessments rarely occur in the community, and as
has been found by Meier (Meier et al., 2004), combining pal-
liative care with case management is a "logical, feasible and
effective strategy to improve the care" of patients with a life-
limiting illness. By initiating the assessment and discussions,
case managers may be able to facilitate subsequent communi-
cation and planning with primary care providers and providers
in other settings such as long-term care facilities.
Hospital executives indicated that improving education
about EOL care (Cooper et al., 2010; Lamba, Pound, Rella,
& Compton, 2012; Smith, O'Sullivan, Lo, & Chen, 2013)
and options for care is a critical need (Coulourides, Brumley,
Wilber, & Enguidanos, 2012; Morrison, 2013). However,
they noted that hospital stays are relatively short and fre-
quently not the best time to have extensive discussions about
such an important topic. Recently, Fink and colleagues (Fink,
Oman, Youngwerth, & Bryant, 2013) surveyed administra-
tors about palliative care and similarly concluded that inad-
equate knowledge by practitioners should be improved,
especially in rural hospitals where resources are scarce.
While they acknowledged that hospitals have an important
role to play in education, they thought that established orga-
nizations with education as a primary mission (e.g., the
American Heart Association, American Lung Association,
etc.), local community or faith-based organizations and state
or local health departments could address advance care
Garner et al. 5
planning with individuals and families and address specific
disease concerns or cultural or spiritual concerns (Field &
Cassel, 2011).
Executives indicated that there is a great need to use
administrative and clinical tools to benchmark and track the
quality of EOL care. Key performance indicators (Twaddle
et al., 2007), quality outcome measures (Casarett et al., 2008;
Morrison, 2013), and evidence-based practices (Qaseem
et al., 2008) have been developed for use in palliative care
settings. These measures could be adapted and used to
improve hospital-wide care by recognizing health care pro-
viders and systems that achieve/exceed indicator measures
and by developing compliance plans for those that do not. As
Twaddle (Twaddle et al., 2007) has reported, hospital systems
need to be in place to identify patients with potential life-lim-
iting illnesses and address the physical, psychological, social,
and spiritual needs of these patients and their families.
In considering how to improve EOL care in hospital set-
tings, the executives acknowledged their own leadership role
but, at the same time, suggested that large-scale cultural
change was needed to move providers from "cure" to "care"
and toward an appreciation for the provision of EOL ser-
vices. The hospital executives in this study noted that such
change could be achieved through infrastructure that sup-
ports the development of champions, as well as ongoing edu-
cation of providers, patients, and the general public. The
findings of this study suggest that hospital executives,
although key change agents, may have insufficient EOL
information to implement steps toward cultural and infra-
structural change and should therefore be included in any
EOL discussions and education.
It is important to consider the limitations of this study.
Because of its qualitative nature and small sample, further
research is needed to investigate the prevalence of the barri-
ers and potential solutions noted by these executives. In
addition, this study was conducted in the Southern "Bible
belt," which has been associated with more intensive life-
prolonging medical care near death (Phelps et al., 2012);
thus, the executives' perceptions of patient expectations and
tendency of providers to shift responsibility to patients and
families may be a function of geographically prevalent
beliefs and coping styles.
