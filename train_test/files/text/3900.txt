Abstract
Objective: This study investigated the relationship between potential prognostic parameters that
may be associated with increased inflammation and survival in patients with malignant mesotheli-
oma (MM).
Methods: This retrospective study assessed potential prognostic parameters measured at the
time of MM diagnosis. Data on asbestos exposure, histopathological subtype of MM and laboratory
parameters were collected.
Results: In 155 patients with MM (90 male), mean survival time was 13.9 months. In univariate
analysis, age !60 years and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) !3 were associated with
significantly shortened median survival times. In multivariate analysis, nonepithelial subtype, red cell
distribution width (RDW) !20% and NLR !3 were associated with significantly shortened median
survival times. Mortality rate was increased 2.77-, 1.67- and 1.52-fold in patients with RDW !20%,
NLR !3 and nonepithelial subtype, respectively. Nonepithelial subtype, white blood cell count !11
200 ml and platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio !300 at baseline were associated with a heightened NLR
value.
Conclusions: The NLR and RDW were significant predictive factors for MM prognosis.

Introduction
Malignant mesothelioma (MM) is a tumour
with increasing incidence;1 it is highly pre-
valent in the southeast region of Turkey
because of environmental asbestos
exposure.2­4 Although several treatment
options have been used in patients with
MM, the disease has a poor prognosis, with
a mean survival time of only 12 months.5­7

The European Organisation for Research
and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) and the
Cancer and Leukemia Group B have devised
two prognostic scoring systems for use in
patients with MM,8,9 which are based on
several signs and symptoms of the disease.
However, these scoring systems are not
routinely used in MM prognosis because
they are time consuming to perform.
Therefore, in patients with MM, parameters
that are useful, easy to measure and inex-
pensive to administer are needed for predict-
ing prognosis.
Local and systemic inflammatory
responses are known to increase in patients
with solid tumours, and are associated
with prognosis.10­12 Importantly, inflamma-
tion plays a critical role in the development
of MM.13 Moreover, during the MM
disease process, patients show signs of
increased inflammatory responses such as
fever, sweats and weight loss.14,15 Thus,
markers of inflammation may have value
in establishing the prognosis of patients with
MM.
Studies have identified the neutrophil-
to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and the platelet-
to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) as measures of
systemic inflammation; they are relatively
inexpensive to perform and provide readily
obtainable (and reproducible) markers that
may be prognostic factors in patients with
MM.16­19 However, studies have shown
conflicting results with NLR. For example,
in one cohort of 30 patients with MM, NLR
!5 was associated with poor MM progno-
sis.20 In contrast, in 44 patients with MM
treated with surgical procedures, NLR !5
was not found to be associated with MM
prognosis.21
Other potentially prognostic inflamma-
tory markers are red cell distribution width
(RDW) and mean platelet volume (MPV).
RDW is a measure of the variability in the
size of circulating erythrocytes,22 and is
routinely reported with complete blood
count. Studies have suggested that RDW is
increased in patients with cardiovascular
and pulmonary diseases, with inflammation
playing a key role.23­25 MPV reflects platelet
size, which is correlated with platelet func-
tion and activation: elevated MPV predicts
high platelet activity and intensity of inflam-
mation.26 MPV values have been investi-
gated in chronic inflammatory diseases, and
increased values have been associated with
conditions such as familial Mediterranean
fever.27,28 To our knowledge, no previous
study has investigated the relationships
between RDW or MPV and prognosis, in
patients with MM.
The aim of the present study was to
investigate the relationship between poten-
tial prognostic indicators (including NLR,
PLR, MPV, RDW and other variables) and
survival, in patients with MM.
Methods
Study design
This was a retrospective study conducted
between 1 September 2012 and 1 December
2012, using data obtained prior to treat-
ment and held in patients' files. Local
ethical approval was obtained from
the Dicle University Medical Faculty
Ethics Committee for Noninterventional
Studies.
Patients
Eligible patients had MM that was diag-
nosed between November 2003 and
November 2012. MM was confirmed histo-
pathologically. Pathological diagnosis was
obtained on biopsies, in line with recent
international guidelines.29 Asbestos expos-
ure type and time, location of MM, histo-
pathological subtype of MM and basic
laboratory parameters were obtained from
patients' files held at the Research Hospital
at Dicle University. Patients (or their next of
Abakay et al. 555
kin) provided written informed consent for
the data to be published.
Potential prognostic parameters
Details on the following potential prognos-
tic parameters, measured at the time of
diagnosis, were obtained from patients'
files: age <60 or !60 years;5 sex; histopatho-
logical subtype of MM (epithelial or none-
pithelial); haemoglobin level <10 g/l or
!10 g/l;17 serum lactate dehydrogenase
(LDH) level <500 U/l or !500 U/l;5,9 plate-
let count <420 Â 103/ml or !420 Â 103/ml;5
white blood cell (WBC) count <11 200/ml or
!11 200/ml.5 LDH level was determined in
serum using heparin and citrate and an
autoanalszer, (Architect 1600c, Abbott
Laboratories, Irving, TX, USA). LDH
level was measured in tubes with K2 ethy-
lenediaminetetra-acetic acid. Haemogram
parameters (including WBC, haemoglobin,
platelet count, neutrophil and lymphocyte
counts) were measured using Cell-Dyn
3700 (Abbott Diagnostics, Lake Forest,
IL, USA).
Assays were performed within 1 h of
collection, after centrifugation of the
paired specimens (1500 g for 10 min at
room temperature).The NLR was deter-
mined by dividing the absolute neutrophil
count by the absolute lymphocyte count. An
NLR !3 was defined as a potential prog-
nostic parameter, as described previ-
ously.17,19 A similar calculation was
performed to derive the PLR, with !300
being the cut-off level for positivity, in
accordance with other literature.18 MPV
and RDW were calculated within the com-
plete blood count; RDW !19.5 Æ 1.7 % was
considered as a potential prognostic param-
eter, as described previously.24 It was not
possible to identify any publications on the
prognosis of MM in relation to MPV, but
the median MPV value was 7.81 fl.
Consequently, we considered MPV !8 fl as
a potential prognostic parameter.
Assessment of the value of potential
prognostic parameters
Univariate and multivariate analyses were
used to investigate the relationship between
MM prognosis and the following 11 poten-
tial factors: age; sex; histopathological sub-
type; platelet count; WBC count; serum
LDH level; NLR; PLR; MPV; haemoglobin
level; RDW.
Statistical analyses
The mean Æ SD values were obtained for
continuous variables and 2-test was used to
examine categorical variables. Duration of
survival and median and mean event times,
with 95% confidence intervals (CI), were
estimated according to the Kaplan­Meier
method. Median values were used in our
definition of the cut-off limits. Duration of
survival was defined as the period between
time of diagnosis and time of death. If
patients were still alive, survival was defined
as the period between time of diagnosis and
1 November 2012.
Cox proportional hazards regression
model, with stratification for the clinical
trial, was used for both the univariate and
multivariate analyses. The univariate ana-
lysis examined the prognostic importance of
all the aforementioned factors and the
model was used to examine the variables.
A two-sided test was used, with a 0.05 level
of significance. Comparisons of overall sur-
vival were made using two-tailed log-rank
tests. Only variables with P-values <0.10 in
the univariate analysis were included in the
final model for the multivariate analysis.
In the Cox regression analysis, the back-
ward conditional method was used.
Significance was taken as P < 0.05.
Statistical analyses were performed using

Results
Patients
Information on basic laboratory parameters
was available for 198 patients with MM. Of
these, 36 patients were excluded from the
study due to lack of sufficient data, and a
further seven patients were excluded due to
the presence of active infection and other
comorbidities (chronic obstructive pulmon-
ary disease, lung cancer, interstitial lung
disease, pneumoconiosis). This left a study
group of 155 patients with MM, of whom 32
were alive at the time of the study; the mean
follow-up period was 13.9 months. The
types of data available for analysis varied
considerably, depending on the information
retained in individual patient records.
Patients had a mean Æ SD age of
58.2 Æ 11.9 years; 90 (58.1%) patients were
male and 65 (42.0%) were female. There was
limited information in the patient records on
aspects such as comorbidities, treatment
regimens and specific clinical findings. A
total of 139 (89.7%) patients had pleural
MM, 19 (12.3%) had peritoneal MM and
one (0.6%) had pericardial MM; the num-
bers of peritoneal and pericardial MM were
too low for statistical analysis. One hundred
(64.5%) patients had epithelial subtype
MM; six (3.9%) patients had sarcomatous
subtype, six (3.9%) patients had mixed
subtype and the subtype was unidentified
in 43 (27.7%) patients. Environmental
asbestos exposure was present in 100
(64.5%) patients and the mean exposure
time in these patients was 31.2 years.
Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio values
were 0.50­10.50 (median 2.9). For other
variables, PLR values were 59.40­576.27
(median 166.87), RDW values were 10.65­
26.50 (median 16.0) and MPV values were
5.69­11.40 fl (median 7.81 fl).
The mean Æ SD survival time was
13.9 Æ 11.3 months.
Potential prognostic parameters
Eleven potential prognostic factors were
assessed in the univariate analysis (Table
1). Age !60 years, male sex, nonepithelial
subtype, NLR !3 and RDW !20% were
associated with shorter median survival
times than age <60 years, female sex, epi-
thelial subtype, NLR <3 and RDW <20%,
respectively (P-values < 0.10); these factors
were therefore included in the multivariate
analysis. According to the multivariate ana-
lysis, median survival times were signifi-
cantly shorter for nonepithelial subtype,
RDW !20% and NLR !3 versus epithelial
subtype, RDW <20% and NLR <3,
respectively (all P < 0.05) (Table 1).
Both the univariate and multivariate
analyses revealed no associations between
survival time and PLR ! 300, MPV !8 fl,
LDH level !500 U/l, platelet count
!420 Â 103/ml, WBC count !11 200/ml or
haemoglobin level !10 g/l.
When the impact of other factors was
excluded, RDW !20% was associated with
an increased mortality rate of 2.77-fold in
patients with MM, an NLR !3 with an
increased mortality rate of 1.67-fold and a
nonepithelial subtype with an increased
mortality rate of 1.52-fold. Survival curves
for patients according to histopathological
subtype (epithelial or nonepithelial), RDW
(<20% and !20%) and NLR (<3 and !3)
are presented in Figures 1­3; the number of
patients with data available for each analysis
varied.

divided by age, sex, platelet count, LDH
level, MPV, RDW or haemoglobin values
were not significantly different between the
two NLR groups. In contrast, significantly
greater proportions of patients with a none-
pithelioid histological subtype (P ¼ 0.007), a
WBC count !11 200/ml (P < 0.000) and a
PLR !300 (P ¼ 0.003) had NLR !3
compared with NLR <3 (Table 2).

Discussion
The EORTC and the Cancer and Leukemia
Group B analysed large numbers of patients
with MM and identified the following poor
prognostic factors:8,9 nonepithelioid hist-
ology; poor performance score; presence of
chest pain; age >75 years; male sex; WBC
count !8.3 Â 109/l; platelet count >400 000/
ml; LDH >500 U/l. In the present univariate
analysis there was a significant association
between age >60 years and poor prognosis
for MM. The patient cohort in the present
study was stratified at 60 years, given the low
mean age of our study group (58 years) and
the short survival duration; few of our
patients reached 75 years of age, despite
this being considered as the threshold for
poor prognosis in the international
recommendations.8,9
Inexpensive and easily detected prognos-
tic parameters have not yet been developed
for MM. Therefore, the present retrospect-
ive study investigated the relationship
between potential prognostic indicators
and survival in 155 patients with MM.
In countries where people are exposed to
asbestos through industrial practices, rates
of MM are generally higher in men than in
women. This is because men are more likely
to work for longer time periods in such
industries and are therefore more likely to
have higher lifetime asbestos exposure rates.
However, in our region, asbestos exposure is
mostly environmental and begins at birth; it
affects both sexes almost equally, because it
is processed with water and people are

exposed via inhalation, in home environ-
ments. Some studies in our region have
found male : female ratios of MM as
close as 1.3­1.48.3,5 In our study, the ratio
was 1.38.
In our region MM is probably detected at
lower ages than those observed elsewhere as
a consequence of the high rate of environ-
mental exposure described above. In one
study performed in our region, the mean age
of patients was 56 years.30 The mean age of
MM patients in our study is also relatively
low, probably as a result of the regional
environmental asbestos exposure.
The mean survival time was 13.9 months.
Of 11 potential prognostic factors assessed,
the inflammatory markers NLR !3 and
RDW !20% (in addition to the nonepithe-
lial subtype), were effective indicators of
MM prognosis in the multivariate analysis.
Other markers (such as age, sex, LDH level,
platelet count and WBC count) were not
found to be prognostic indicators of MM.
Studies have reported that the rate of
mortality increased 1.79­2.20-fold in
patients with MM with NLR !3 versus
<3, and that this difference was statistically
significant.17,19 Unal et al. found that pre-
treatment NLR measurements provided
important prognostic results in patients
with nonsmall cell lung cancer.31 In other
studies, the rate of mortality in patients with
MM was increased 2.00­2.70-fold with
NLR !5 versus <5; this difference was
also statistically significant.16,18 Cedre
´ s
et al.20 found that NLR !5 was an inde-
pendent prognostic factor in patients with
MM. In the present study, the rate of
mortality increased 1.67-fold in patients
with MM who had an NLR of !3 compared
with NLR <3; mean duration of survival
was 10.5 months in those with an NLR ! 3
and 14.9 months in those with an NLR <3.
The NLR may, therefore, be viewed as an
inexpensive predictor of MM prognosis at
the time of diagnosis, and we postulate that
the NLR level could be a factor to use as
part of the decision making process, when
considering aggressive or palliative treat-
ment regimens for patients with MM. It is
reasonable to assume that patients with MM
with more advanced disease at the time of
diagnosis may have a more excessive sys-
temic inflammatory response and, therefore,
a higher NLR.
The histological subtype is well estab-
lished in predicting prognosis in MM and
many studies have found that the none-
pithelial histological subtype is associated
with a poor prognosis.9,16,17 The multivari-
ate analysis in the present study also con-
firmed this finding: the mortality rate
increased 1.52-fold in patients with a none-
pithelial subtype of MM.
In complete blood count data, the RDW
has been found to be increased in several
inflammatory diseases.24,32,33 However, the

association between a high RDW and over-
all prognosis in MM has not been widely
investigated. In one investigation of patients
with pulmonary embolism, RDW >15%
was found to be a prognostic parameter in
multivariate analysis, and RDW >15%
increased the mortality rate 1.2-fold.34 In
another study of patients with community-
acquired pneumonia, the 30-day mortality
rate was significantly higher in those with a
greater RDW.35 In our study, mortality
rates in patients with MM increased 2.77-
fold in those with RDW !20% versus
<20%, and the mean survival time was 8
months in those with RDW !20%, com-
pared with 13.9 months in those with RDW
<20%: a difference that was statistically
significant. This result may be due to the
association between RDW and increased
inflammation, and to chronic inflammation

playing a key role in the development
of MM.
In our study, RDW !20% was associated
with histopathological subtype and platelet
count, whereas NLR !3 was associated with
histopathological subtype, WBC count and
PLR. These findings may be due to the
associations between histopathological sub-
type, WBC count, platelet count and PLR,
and poor prognosis of MM.8,9,18
A limitation of our study is its retrospect-
ive nature, which focused on pretreatment
information obtained from patients' files.
Moreover, treatment regimens and their
outcomes were unavailable, since patient
management was conducted in other clinics,
such as oncology clinics, or in thoracic
surgery. Another limitation is that we only
became aware of the guidelines outlined by
the REMARK initiative36 after we had

undertaken the present study. As our study
was retrospective, the patient data did not
consistently include information on disease
stage, comorbidities, performance status,
chest pain, treatment regimens and other
detailed results (which are recommended in
the REMARK guidelines). Where possible,
however, we had applied other recommen-
dations of the REMARK initiative.
In conclusion, the pathological role of
chronic inflammation in the development of
MM is well established.13 Based on our
results, inflammatory-based biomarkers
may be predictive of survival. NLR, as an
index of systemic inflammation, may be
independently associated with survival in
patients with MM. Both the NLR and the
RDW may be useful prognostic markers:
they are easily obtainable and were signifi-
cant predictive factors for MM prognosis.
The inexpensive nature and reproducibility
of the complete blood count, which includes
both NLR and RDW, should encourage
their use in the clinical management of
patients with MM. Both parameters may
help in making the decision between aggres-
sive or palliative treatment regimens.
