Do Primary Care Physicians
Treating Minority Patients
Report Problems Delivering
High-Quality Care?
Practice resources appear to be a determining factor in whether or not
physicians treating predominantly minority patients deliver care of
adequate quality.
by James D. Reschovsky and Ann S. O'Malley
ABSTRACT: Racial and ethnic disparities in primary health care likely reflect the aggregate
socioeconomic composition of a physician's patient panels as well as differences in individ-
ual patients' characteristics. National physician survey data indicate that physicians in
high-minority practices depend more on low-paying Medicaid, receive lower private insur-
ance reimbursements, and have lower incomes. These constrained resources help explain
the greater quality-related difficulties delivering care reported by these physicians--such as
coordination of care, ability to spend adequate time with patients during office visits, and
obtaining specialty care--that relate directly to physicians' ability to function as their pa-
tients' medical home. [Health Affairs 26, no. 3 (2007): w222­w231 (published online 22
April 2008; 10.1377/hlthaff.26.3.w222)]
Although there is broad consensus that racial/ethnic differences in
the quality of health care exist, there is much disagreement over the root
causes. Most agree that the disparities issue is complex and that myriad pa-
tient, provider, practice, health care system, and community factors are involved.1
Most disparities studies use population-based surveys, chart reviews, or claims
data to document racial and ethnic differences in the quality of care. But it is often
difficult to isolate, in these data sources, key underlying differences in care proc-
esses and organizational responses that may explain disparities.
In this analysis we take the perspective of primary care physicians to focus on
some of these processes and responses. We explore whether physicians whose pa-
tient panels (the set of patients they treat) consist of a disproportionate percent-
age of minorities report more difficulties obtaining services for their patients and

delivering high-quality care than those treating fewer minority patients.
This study builds on a new line of research that goes beyond assessing an indi-
vidual patient's characteristics to also examine the contribution to racial dispari-
ties from the aggregate socioeconomic and insurance composition of the pro-
vider's entire patient base.2 Because racial and ethnic minorities are
geographically concentrated, they are disproportionately treated by a small num-
ber of providers. Lower incomes and rates of insurance coverage among minorities
affect the capabilities, organization, and resources both at the site of care and in
the local delivery system. For instance, Peter Bach and colleagues found that a
small percentage of primary care physicians disproportionately treat black Medi-
care patients. These physicians have less access to health care resources and lower
qualifications than physicians who predominantly treat white patients.3 More-
over, they report more difficulties obtaining needed services for their patients and
providing high-quality care to their patients in general. Similar results have been
found for hospital and nursing home care.4
In addition to comparing the reported problems of physicians whose patient
panels consist of fewer versus more minority patients, we explore whether in-
creasing the resources flowing to high-minority physician practices, specifically
by increasing Medicaid fees to physicians, might improve physicians' ability to
provide high-quality care and help reduce racial and ethnic disparities. We focus
on practice resources because this is a key factor over which public policy has a
direct and important influence.
Study Data And Methods
n Data. We used data from the 2004­05 Community Tracking Study (CTS) Phy-
sician Survey, supplemented by secondary information from the Census Bureau and
other sources. The survey obtained a broad range of information from a nationally
representative sample of nonfederal patient care physicians who practiced at least
twenty hours per week. The weighted response rate was 52.4 percent. All analyses
were weighted to account for the probability of selection and to correct to differen-
tial survey nonresponse.5 Most pertinently, the survey asked physicians what per-
centage of their patients were black and Hispanic and asked about various difficul-
ties respondents faced obtaining necessary services for their patients and delivering
high-quality care.6 For this study we focused on the experiences of primary care
physicians (PCPs): general internists, family or general practitioners, and general
pediatricians (N = 3,320).
n Analysis. We first profiled physicians in low-, medium-, and high-minority
practices--those whose patient panels were less than 30 percent, 30­70 percent,
and 70 percent black or Latino, respectively--focusing on physician and practice
characteristics as well as indicators of patient resources, clinical burden, and insur-
ance reimbursements. Most of these data came from the survey, although some (area
income levels and uninsurance rates; Medicaid and private insurance physician pay-

ment indices) were obtained from secondary sources.7
We then compared reports of problems associated with access to specialty care,
interactions with patients, and care processes cited by these three groups of physi-
cians. Because institutional practices, such as those associated with medical
schools, hospitals, and community health clinics, often receive external support
beyond that obtained from insurers and patients, we also stratified these descrip-
tive analyses by whether the physician worked in a solo or group practice versus
other, more institutional settings (such as a hospital, health maintenance organi-
zation [HMO], medical school, or clinic). Key results are highlighted in the text.8
Finally, we assessed the degree to which disparities in problems reported by
physicians treating lesser or greater percentages of minority patients would be re-
duced if practice resources were increased. To illustrate this, we regressed physi-
cians' reports on a set of indicators of physician practice resources and then simu-
lated the effect of increasing Medicaid payments to equal those of Medicare.9
Study Results
About 52 percent of PCPs reported having patient panels with less than 30 per-
cent minorities, 36 percent reported that 30­70 percent of their patients are mi-
norities, and 12 percent reported that minorities constituted more than 70 percent
of their patient panels in 2004­05. The variation in the minority composition of
physician patient panels indicates that a relatively small number of physicians
treated a disproportionately large share of minority patients, consistent with pre-
vious findings.10
n Characteristics of low-, medium-, and high-minority practices. Patient re-
sources and clinical burden. Our results confirm well-established associations between
greater minority presence, less insurance coverage, and lower income (Exhibit 1). In
2004­05, physicians with greater portions of minority patients were located in areas
with lower median incomes and higher uninsurance rates. Moreover, physicians in
high-minority practices received more than a third of their practice revenue from
Medicaid--more than twice that of physicians in low-minority practices. These
patterns are buttressed by the finding that among PCPs in high-minority practices,
35 percent reported that patients' inability to pay was a major problem affecting
their ability to provide high-quality care, compared with 23 percent of those in low-
minority practices.
Low-income patients often pose greater clinical burdens for physicians, be-
cause of poorer health status, more complex personal and social conditions, and
greater communication and cultural barriers. We did not find, however, that PCPs
in high-minority practices reported larger percentages of their patients as having
chronic conditions or being elderly compared with those in low-minority prac-
tices. Physicians treating large numbers of minority patients did report having a
greater percentage of patients with whom they have a hard time communicating
because they speak a different language.

Physician and practice characteristics. In 2004­05, PCPs in high-minority practices
were more likely to be female and to be minorities themselves, compared with
those treating fewer minority patients. Only 35 percent of physicians in high-
minority practices were white, non-Hispanic. Conversely, very few (3.4 percent)
physicians in practices with less than 30 percent minority patients were African
American or Hispanic themselves. Physicians in high-minority practices had
fewer years of practice experience and were less likely to be board certified than
their counterparts in low-minority practices (80.4 percent versus 89.2 percent).
They were also more likely to be pediatricians. International medical graduates
(IMGs) were nearly twice as likely to be found in high- versus low-minority prac-
tices in 2004­05. They constituted a majority in high-minority solo and group
physician practices.11
Relative to PCPs with few minority patients, PCPs in high-minority practices
were less likely to work in solo and group practices and more likely to be in medi-
cal school practices, community or state and local government health clinics, or
nonhospital institutional settings. Physicians with a higher proportion of minor-
ity patients in their panels reported a greater percentage of their practice revenue
as coming from managed care--specifically, capitated payments.
Practice resources. Physician practice revenue was inversely related to the per-
centage of minority patients. Physicians in high-minority practices across all set-
tings reported a greater share of practice revenues from the generally low-paying
Medicaid program, as compared with those serving fewer minority patients.
Moreover, physicians in high-minority practices were in locations where the ratio
of Medicaid to Medicare reimbursements was significantly lower than the ratios
in practices with 30­70 percent minority patients in 2004­05. Physicians in high-
minority practices were also located in areas with lower private insurance reim-
bursements to physicians. As a likely result of these various factors, PCPs in high-
minority practices reported lower incomes on average than those with fewer mi-
nority patients, a pattern that held across both solo/group and more institutional
practices.12 There were no significant differences in the use of health information
technologies between physicians in high- and low-minority practices.
n Do physicians caring for a high proportion of minority patients report
greater difficulty providing care? Relative to physicians treating fewer minority
patients, those with a greater share of minority patients differed in their ability to
obtain specialty care for their patients and were more likely to report many quality-
related difficulties (Exhibit 2). No significant differences were found regarding con-
straints on clinical autonomy or exposure to certain financial incentives with the
potential of compromising care, or in reported problems obtaining inpatient hospi-
tal admissions or high-quality imaging (results not shown).13
More than a quarter of physicians in high-minority practices disagreed that it
was possible to provide high-quality care to all of their patients. This compares
with just 16 percent of those in low-minority practices.

Access to specialty care. Physicians with high-minority patient panels were more
likely than those treating few minorities to report difficulties obtaining specialty
care for their patients. Survey respondents were also asked whether they faced
difficulties obtaining specialty care for specific reasons. Physicians in high-minor-
ity practices reported greater difficulty obtaining specialty care for their patients
because patients were uninsured or had insurance coverage that posed access bar-
riers, but not because of an inadequate supply of qualified specialists in the area.14
Physician-patient interactions. Although minorities are less likely to have a usual
source of care than whites, physicians treating greater percentages of minority pa-
tients were not significantly more likely to report an inability to maintain conti-
nuity of care than those treating fewer minority patients. They were more likely to
report other difficulties with physician-patient interaction, however. For exam-
ple, physicians in high-minority practices were more likely than those in low-

minority practices to report language or cultural barriers to communication with
patients as a major problem affecting quality. They also more frequently reported
that inadequate time during office visits was a major problem that affected their
ability to provide high-quality care (24 percent versus 11 percent). These patterns
were particularly evident among physicians in solo or group practices.15 To vali-
date the reports of inadequate time, we used physicians' reports on number of pa-
tient visits and hours of direct patient care in the last week to estimate average
time spent per patient visit for PCPs in low-, medium-, and high-minority prac-
tices. Physicians in high-minority practices spent about 30 percent less time per
patient seen than those in low-minority practices (fifteen versus twenty-one min-
utes).16 Those in medium-minority practices fell in between.
Difficulties with care processes. PCPs in high-minority practices were significantly
more likely to report difficulties obtaining timely reports from other providers
than were PCPs in low-minority practices. Nearly a quarter of PCPs in high-
minority practices reported that not getting timely reports from other providers
was a major problem affecting their ability to provide high-quality care, compared
with 11 percent of PCPs in low-minority practices, which suggests the existence of
increased challenges to care coordination in high-minority practices. Similarly,
PCPs in high-minority practices were ten percentage points more likely to com-
plain that the scope of care they are expected to provide without referral was
greater than it should be (28 percent versus 18 percent). This pattern is largely at-
tributable to the reports of physicians in solo and group practices.17
Taken together, the percentages shown in Exhibit 2 suggest that the ability of
physicians in high-minority practices to effectively function as their patients'
medical home is constrained.
n The role of practice revenues. Although differences in patient, physician,
and practice characteristics likely help explain differences in reported difficulties
faced by physicians in low-, medium-, and high-minority practices, we focus on the
role of practice revenues, because this is where public policy can most clearly have
an impact. We regressed each physician report on variables indicating practice re-
sources and then simulated responses if Medicaid payments were equal to Medicare
payments. Exhibit 2 shows the absolute percentage-point difference from unad-
justed means predicted to result if there was Medicaid-Medicare physician payment
parity. Low Medicaid payment accounted for only part of the resource disadvan-
tages many high-minority practices faced, because the simulations did not account
for the greater numbers of uninsured patients in high-minority practices and the
lower average private-insurer payments. Nevertheless, the results indicate that if
Medicaid fees were raised to Medicare levels, physicians' reports of difficulties pro-
viding care for their patients would often decline, particularly among physicians
treating large portions of minority patients and for difficulties related to physicians'
ability to function as their patients' medical home: time during office visits, timely
reports, ability to obtain specialist referrals, and appropriate scope of care.18

Discussion And Policy Implications
The results of this analysis suggest that aggregate characteristics of populations
at the community and practice levels have implications for the care available to pa-
tients. In other words, it is not only individual patients' characteristics that influ-
ence the care received, but also the cumulative resources afforded to a practice
based on all of a physician's patients.
PCPs in high-minority practices rely more heavily on lower-paying Medicaid
reimbursements, devote more time to uncompensated charity care, and earn lower
incomes. Magnifying these resource disparities, geographic areas with more high-
minority practices tend to have lower Medicaid and private insurance reimburse-
ments than those with fewer high-minority practices.
Our results indicate that the minority makeup of physicians' patient panels is
associated with greater reports from physicians of difficulties providing high-
quality care. At least some of this relationship appears to be explained by the
lower resources flowing to high-minority practices. Two of the quality indicators
most affected by Medicaid payment levels in our simulations, time spent per pa-
tient seen and difficulties getting timely reports from other providers, suggest the
possibility that physicians may compensate for the lower revenue flows by in-
creasing the volume of patients they see, reducing the time spent per patient seen,
and perhaps devoting less time to coordinating and documenting care. This is de-
spite the more complex psychosocial contexts and the language and cultural bar-
riers that often complicate the treatment of lower-income and minority patients.19
Physicians in high-minority practices were more likely than those in low-
minority practices to cite problems obtaining care from specialists for their pa-
tients. Although more research is needed, one possible implication is that PCPs in
high-minority practices are forced to treat patients with more-complex condi-
tions whom they would normally refer to a specialist, placing further stresses on
the provider and potentially lowering the quality of care. We found that physi-
cians treating more minority patients were more likely than those treating fewer
minority patients to report that the scope of care they are required to provide is
too broad, a finding consistent with this interpretation.
n Study limitations. This study has several limitations that should be recog-
nized. It relied on physician survey reports of difficulties providing high-quality
care, rather than on objective and validated quality measures. Survey reports can be
influenced by differences in respondents' values, perspectives, and expectations. Re-
porting error on the percentage of minority patients, although not likely to be large,
might have reduced our ability to detect differences between low-, medium-, and
high-minority practices. Moreover, observations at only the physician level do not
permit detailed controls for individual patient-level differences, just as observations
at the individual patient level typically fail to adequately control for provider or sys-
tem characteristics. Ideally, one would have hierarchical data that include represen-

tative data on community health systems, the physician practices within that com-
munity, the physicians within those practices, and the patients treated by those
physicians.
n Policy implications. The results of this study suggest that racial and ethnic
disparities in primary health care are in part systemic in nature, and the lower re-
sources flowing to physicians treating more minority patients are a contributing
factor. In particular, we illustrated that if Medicaid payments to physicians were on
par with those paid by Medicare, disparities in reported difficulties between physi-
cians whose patient panels were made up of greater versus smaller proportions of
minorities would diminish, often substantially. Low payments may be leading PCPs
to reduce the time spent with patients and more generally diminish their ability to
function effectively as their patients' medical home.
Previous research indicates that low Medicaid payments to physicians discour-
age them from serving Medicaid patients, reducing access to care for beneficia-
ries.20 Our research suggests the possibility that low payments further threaten
the quality of care in ways that go beyond diminished access to services, thereby
contributing to racial disparities in health care. Moreover, low Medicaid pay-
ments to physicians with substantial Medicaid caseloads could be compromising
the care provided to all of the physician's patients, not just the Medicaid recipi-
ents.21 State legislators and governors should not assume that physicians will be
able to shift costs so that Medicaid patients receive care equivalent to care for
other patients. The concentration of Medicaid patients in a small number of phy-
sician practices, a trend that is increasing, implies that opportunities for cost
shifting are often limited.22 In addition to raising payment rates for the treatment
of Medicaid patients, efforts to increase insurance coverage or otherwise increase
resources flowing to physicians who serve low-income and minority populations
would implicitly reduce disparities.23

5. Because the sample frame is from the American Medical Association (AMA) and American Osteopathic
Association (AOA) Masterfiles and a majority of the sample was surveyed in the previous round, informa-
tion was available about the characteristics of both survey respondents and nonrespondents, increasing
the ability to make adjustments for differential nonresponse and reducing the likelihood of response error.
For an extensive description of the weight development and other survey methods, see S. Williams et al.,
CommunityTrackingStudyPhysicianSurveyMethodologyReport2004­05,StatisticalDesignandTracingfortheCommu-
nity Tracking Study Physician Survey, Technical Pub. no. 70, 2006, http://www.hschange.org/CONTENT/

6. There might have been some error in physicians' reports on the percentage of their patients who were Afri-
can American or Hispanic, but this is not likely to have substantially affected our analysis. Patients' physi-
cal characteristics and surnames are readily apparent to physicians, and cognitive testing of this question
indicated that physicians had little difficulty responding. Moreover, because we categorized this variable
into three broad categories, any misclassification is likely to be small, and its effect would be to understate
differences between low-, medium-, and high-minority practices.
7. Appendix Exhibit A online provides greater detail on all variables and data sources used. The technical
appendix is available at http://content.healthaffairs.org/cgi/content/full/hlthaff.27.3.w222/DC2.

9. To control for practice resources, we used payer mix, as indicated by the percentage of practice revenue
from Medicaid, Medicare, and private payers and the number of hours spent monthly on charity care. In
addition, we included Medicaid and private-payer physician payment indices, which were also interacted
with Medicaid- and private-payer-mix variables, respectively. We tested other models in which a broader
range of covariates were included, capturing patient, physician, and practice characteristics. Results were
robust.

13. In other findings (not shown), physicians with greater percentages of minority patients reported fewer
problems obtaining outpatient mental health services than those treating fewer minorities.
14. The lack of relationship was confirmed by another, similar measure not reported: the percentage reporting
that the "lack of qualified specialists in the area was a major problem affecting primary care physicians'
ability to provide care."
15. See Appendix Exhibit C online, as in Note 7.
16. The number of visits was adjusted for site of visit (such as office, hospital, nursing home).
17. See Appendix Exhibit C online, as in Note 7.
18. Office visit time results are consistent with S. Decker, "Medicaid Physician Fees and the Quality of Medi-
cal Care of Medicaid Patients in the USA," Reviewof Economicsof theHousehold 5, no. 1 (2007): 95­112.
19. Low reimbursements could also lead physicians to see fewer patients, and in particular fewer Medicaid
patients. Greater difficulties obtaining physician care among Medicaid beneficiaries is evidence that this
occurs. See S. Zuckerman et al., "Changes in Medicaid Physician Fees, 1998­2003: Implications for Physi-
cian Participation," Health Affairs 23 (2004): w374­w384 (published online 23 June 2004; 10.1377/hlthaff
.w4.374).

Service Corps and the Medicare Incentive Payment Program.
