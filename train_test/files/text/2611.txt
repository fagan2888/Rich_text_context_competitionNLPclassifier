RECENT research has questioned the conventional wis-
dom of asexual older age. Evidence shows that both
women and men are sexually active well into later life (e.g.,
Lindau et al., 2007; Nicolosi et al., 2004). At the same time,
because sexual ability is closely related to health status that
declines with age, considerable numbers of older adults
have concerns about their sexual functioning (e.g., Laumann,
Das, & Waite, 2008; Laumann et al., 2005).
Findings from our previous study suggest that social rela-
tionships can help older adults handle negative feelings
about their own sexual dysfunction in the relationship with
spouse or partner (Hirayama & Walker, 2011). To maintain
partnerships, however, it also is critical for older adults to
manage the situation in which their partner faces sexual
dysfunction. In fact, it has been reported that older adults
are struggling to adjust their intimate relationships to not
only their own but also their partner's sexual functioning
(Gott & Hinchliff, 2003).
Our aim in this study is to explore whether and how
social relationships may protect the psychological well-being
of older adults when their partner's sexual dysfunction
makes it difficult to have a sexual relationship. Although
social relationships have been consistently shown to influ-
ence health and well-being in later life (e.g., Antonucci,
2001; Moren-Cross & Lin, 2006), the role of social partners
(i.e., social network members, especially those to whom
one feels close) has been understudied in the literature on
sexual health among older adults, where medical perspec-
tives predominate. Linking social relationships research to
the field of sexual health in later life, our study will help
clarify how older adults, with their social partners, can bet-
ter negotiate intimate ties when partners face aging-related
sexual problems.
Self, Perceived Partner Responsiveness, and
Well-being
Symbolic interactionism posits that individuals develop a
sense of the self through reflection of the views of others
(Tice & Wallace, 2003). That is, we observe how others
respond to us and then incorporate those responses into our
self-view (i.e., "looking glass" self; Cooley, 1902). The theory
presumes that significant others, typically the spouse or
intimate partner in adulthood, are most influential in the
process of self-construal (Mead, 1934).Across the life span,
individuals rely most on significant others for affirmation of
their ideas and behavior. By receiving such affirmation from
others, individuals internalize and reinforce the belief that
they are worthy and capable persons (Tice & Wallace, 2003).
Aligned with this perspective, researchers on social rela-
tionships have theorized how and why perceiving others to
be supportive enhances individuals' psychological well-
being (Lakey & Cohen, 2000). When individuals perceive
that their significant others would satisfy their needs will-
ingly, individuals develop a sense of self-worth and self-
efficacy, which then helps them see their lives as manageable
and thus protects their psychological well-being even in
challenging situations (Antonucci, 2001).

Implications for Psychological Well-being in Later Life

Objectives. Guided by symbolic interactionism, we examined (a) whether the psychological well-being of older adults
might be threatened if they feel bothered by an intimate partner's sexual unresponsiveness and (b) whether such sexual
unresponsiveness of a partner might be compensated by perceived supportiveness of significant others. We explored these
questions separately by gender, anticipating that sexual unresponsiveness might affect men and women differently and
that support from a partner might be more important for men and support from others more important for women.
Method. Using data from 1,346 participants in the National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project, we conducted
multiple group regression analysis and estimated models separately but simultaneously for women and men.
Results. Although feeling bothered by the sexual unresponsiveness of an intimate partner was significantly associated
with both women's and men's depressive symptoms, the moderating effect of the partner's supportiveness was significant
only for women.
Discussion. The results suggest that gender is a key dimension for understanding the relations among negative
feelings about sexual relationships, socioemotional support from significant others, and psychological well-being in
older age.
Key Words: Gender--Sexual behavior--Social support.
WHEN PARTNER HAS A SEXUAL PROBLEM 805
This theoretical perspective suggests a link between the
perceived sexual responsiveness of the intimate partner and
older adults' psychological well-being. When older adults
perceive their partner to be reluctant or unable to satisfy
their needs for sexual intimacy (i.e., sexually unresponsive),
their view of the self as a sexual partner is likely to be
threatened. Because many adults consider sexual satisfac-
tion as an important component of intimate partnerships
(Sprecher & Cate, 2004), a wounded self-view in terms
of sexual partnering can deteriorate their psychological
well-being.
Yet, older adults likely do not judge their partner's re-
sponsiveness solely by whether the partner is perceived to
satisfy their needs for sexual intimacy willingly. Symbolic
interactionism suggests that the role of an intimate partner
comprises multiple meanings such as confidant and compan-
ion (LaRossa & Reitzes, 1993). For example, older adults
may perceive their partner to be responsive if the partner
listens to them willingly when they have a concern (i.e.,
responsive partner as a confidant). Furthermore, psychological
well-being is thought to be enhanced by an accumulation
of multiple forms of perceived supportiveness (Antonucci,
2001). Thus, the psychological well-being of older adults
can be secured when they perceive their partner to be
unwilling or unable to satisfy their needs for sexual intimacy if
they perceive their partner to respond to them in a helpful
manner in other nonsexual aspects of intimate partnerships.
In addition, individuals can have multiple significant others
as sources of socioemotional support including affirmation,
although spouse or partner is likely to be the most preferred
support provider in adulthood (e.g., Antonucci, 2001;
Takahashi, 2005). Gerontological research has indicated that
acquiring and maintaining various sources of socioemo-
tional support is a key for aging well (Adams & Blieszner,
1995). Because an accumulation of perceived support from
one's close relationships is thought to increase psychological
well-being (Antonucci), the sense that other social partners
(e.g., relatives, friends) are responsive may have a protective
psychological effect for older adults with a less sexually
responsive partner.
How perceived responsiveness influences such older
adults may differ by gender. Extant literature shows that
older men's social networks are centered on spousal rela-
tionships, whereas women have multiple equally close others
in their networks (Antonucci, 2001). Thus, men's well-
being may be governed more than women's by perceived
responsiveness of spouse or partner. Moreover, cultural
discourses encourage men to perform well sexually even in
older age (Potts, Grace, Vares, & Gavey, 2006). As sug-
gested by symbolic interactionism, individuals' views of
themselves as a sexual partner will be contingent on how
much their partner is responsive sexually. Because of the
pressure on men to be continuously sexually competent,
their well-being may be damaged more than women's when
their partner is sexually disengaged. In summary, perceived
responsiveness of spouse or partner, both sexually and
nonsexually, may influence men more than women. By
contrast, perceived responsiveness of other social partners,
such as relatives and friends, may influence women's well-
being to a similar extent as responsiveness of spouse or
partner.
Research Aims
Our primary aim is to identify whether perceived sexual
unresponsiveness of an intimate partner can be compen-
sated by nonsexual forms of responsiveness of multiple sig-
nificant others. We hypothesize that (a) perceived sexual
unresponsiveness of spouse or partner will have a negative
effect on the psychological well-being of older adults and
(b) this effect, however, may be moderated by other, non-
sexual forms of perceived responsiveness (i.e., perceived
support) by close social partners, including not only spouse
or partner but also other family members and friends. We
also examine whether and how the effect of perceived
responsiveness may differ by gender.
We consider psychological well-being comprised both
positive (e.g., happiness) and negative (e.g., symptoms)
mental states that are related but independent (Karademas,
2007). Research has shown that each is differentially asso-
ciated with health status and functioning (Huppert &
Whittington, 2003). Our previous analysis also showed that
the effect of social relationships on the positive and negative
well-being of older adults facing sexual concerns is incon-
sistent (Hirayama & Walker, 2011). Including both positive
and negative psychological states is necessary to better
understand the relation between perceived partner respon-
siveness and psychological well-being.
The related literature suggests the need to consider both
(a) the sociodemographic background and (b) the health
status of older adults when examining the psychological
effects of sexual dysfunction. Research has indicated that
attitudes toward sexual relationships vary by such dimen-
sions as birth cohort, race, and social class (e.g., Burgess,
2004). In addition, health has been shown to be associated
with both older adults' engagement in sexual activity
(Lindau et al., 2007) and their psychological well-being
(George, 2010). To clarify the relation of perceived sexual
unresponsiveness of partner to the psychological well-being
of older adults, we take into account their age, racial back-
ground, level of education received, and physical health.
Method
We analyzed data from the National Social Life, Health,
and Aging Project (NSHAP), a population-based survey
conducted in 2005 and 2006. This project used a nationally
representative sample of 3,005 U.S. community-dwelling
adults aged 57­85 years. Our analysis was restricted to a
subsample of 1,346 adults who (a) were married or had an
intimate partner and (b) engaged in sexual activities with
HIRAYAMA AND WALKER
806
their spouse or partner in the last 12 months because only
these adults answered questions regarding whether their
partner experienced sexual dysfunction. Because fewer than
0.3% (n = 4) had a sexual relationship with more than one
partner, we focused on the primary partner of each participant.
In addition, we excluded the four adults with a same-gender
partner. Because of our secondary focus on gender differ-
ences in the association between perceived partner respon-
siveness and well-being, we estimated our model separately
for women and for men.
Our subsample included more men (n = 844) than women
(n = 502), and average age differed significantly by gender
(women = 65.7; men = 66.5; t = 2.17, p < .05). The partici-
pants were relatively highly educated (84.4% completed
high school; 27.8% had graduated from college), but more
men (31.2%) than women (24.3%) held a bachelor's or
higher degree (c2 = 12.317, p < .01). Although women live
longer than men, older men, especially those of higher
socioeconomic status, are more likely than women to have
an intimate partner in later life (Burgess, 2004). For this
reason, our analytic sample reflects the gender and class
composition of the population of partnered older adults.
Regarding racial background, 75.4% of women and 73.2%
of men were White. Although we included both marital and
nonmarital partnerships, married participants predominated
(89.0% of women and 87.6% of men). There was no gender
difference in racial background or partnerships.
Measurement
Perceived sexual unresponsiveness of a partner.--As noted,
guided by symbolic interactionism, we define perceived
sexual unresponsiveness of a partner as older adults' per-
ception that their partner is reluctant or unable to satisfy
their needs for sexual intimacy and that this is a bother-
some. Our focus, therefore, is not on the sexual dysfunction
of partner per se. Relevant to the symbolic interaction
framework is how older adults perceive and are bothered by
the sexual problems of their partner, especially their view of
the partner's problems as a hindrance to their pursuit of
sexual intimacy. Because Reis, Clark, and Holmes (2004)
suggested that individuals experience negative feelings
such as dissatisfaction when perceiving their social partner
as not meeting their needs (i.e., partner unresponsiveness),
as an index of feeling bothered by the perceived sexual un-
responsiveness of a partner, we assessed how much partici-
pants were troubled by the sexual inability and disinterest of
their spouse or partner.
NSHAP participants who engaged in sexual activities
with their spouse or partner in the last 12 months reported
whether the spouse or partner had any of the following
problems with sexual functioning: lack of interest in
sex, being unable to climax, climaxing too quickly, not find-
ing sex pleasurable, anxiety about the ability for sexual
performance, erectile dysfunction (for a male partner), and
problems with lubrication (for a female partner). These
items were originally developed for another project, Nat
ional Health and Social Life Survey, and cover the major
problems in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Men-
tal Disorder (4th ed.) classification of sexual dysfunction
(Laumann, Paik, & Rosen, 1999). Participants then answered
how much they felt bothered by each problem their partner
had using a 3-point scale that ranged from 0 = not at all to
2 = a lot. Half of the participants (n = 674) reported that
their spouse or partner faced at least one sexual problem.
When participants refused to answer or did not know
whether their partner had a given sexual problem, we
counted their partner as not having the problem, and thus,
these participants were treated as not feeling bothered by
the problem (for the reason specified below).
Because participants reported how much they felt both-
ered only regarding problems their partner faced, it was not
possible to simply sum scores across problems each partici-
pant reported. (The possible range of such a summary index
would differ among participants according to the number of
partner's sexual problems.) To create an index with a con-
sistent range across participants, we averaged the ratings of
how bothersome each of the partner's sexual problems was
to the participant (range = 0­2).
This individually adjusted index captures how much
respondents feel troubled by their partner's sexual problems
regardless of the number and types of partner's problems. In
other words, this index did not assume (a) the number of
perceived sexual problems of the partner is related to the
level of feeling bothered or (b) a given type of sexual prob-
lem of the partner is necessarily more influential in partici-
pants' feelings than other types of problems are. We rejected
these assumptions for the following reasons. First, results of
our subsidiary analysis indicated that greater numbers of
partner's sexual problems do not necessarily increase re-
ports of how bothersome the problems are to the participant.
Specifically, we found that, among respondents whose part-
ner faced more than one sexual problem, there was no sig-
nificant difference in scores on our individually adjusted
index (i.e., average rating of how bothered) by the number
of partner's sexual problems.
Second, our subsidiary analyses also indicated consider-
able individual differences in which problems troubled par-
ticipants and to what extent. Simply combining scores of
feeling bothered across problems, we examined whether the
partner's having a given problem made a difference in
scores on this combined measure. We found that some types
of problems, such as partner's inability to climax, were not
significantly associated with this combined measure. One
might assume, then, that these types of sexual problems
would not lead to perceived sexual unresponsiveness of
partner. Yet, almost half (45%) of women whose partner
was unable to climax reported that they felt bothered some-
what or a lot by this problem. Thus, some types of partner's
WHEN PARTNER HAS A SEXUAL PROBLEM 807
sexual problems are less influential in the partnership on
average but could have a critical influence on a small number
of couples. Accordingly, we consider our individually ad-
justed index to be an adequate measure for feeling bothered
by the perceived sexual unresponsiveness of the partner.
Perceived support from significant others.--For each of
the three types of relationships, the relationship with spouse
or partner, family, and friends, NSHAP participants were
asked about perceived availability of two types of support:
How often they can open up if they need to talk about their
worries and how often they can ask for help if they have
a problem. The participants answered each item using a
3-point scale ranging from 0 = hardly ever or never to 2 =
often. We combined the scores on these two items to create
a measure of perceived support from each type of relation-
ship. Correlations of the two items for partnerships, family,
and friend relationships were 0.43, 0.45, and 0.52, respec-
tively (all p < .01). Each combined measure ranged from 0
to 4. We scored having no family or having no friend as
perceiving support as hardly ever or never available. At the
same time, to take account of the possible different influ-
ences of objective and subjective social isolation (Cornwell &
Waite, 2009), we included dummy variables that indicate
whether participants were without family (n = 4) or without
friends (n = 41). (These two dummy variables had no sig-
nificant effect in all models and are not shown in the tables
that summarize results.)
Psychological well-being.--An item about general hap-
piness "If you were to consider your life in general these
days, how happy or unhappy would you say you are on the
whole?" served as our measure of positive psychological
well-being. Participants answered this item using a 5-point
scale ranging from 0 = usually unhappy to 4 = extremely
happy. General happiness has been shown to be highly cor-
related with other constructs of positive well-being such as
life satisfaction (Slocum-Gori, Zumbo, Michalos, & Diener,
2009). Furthermore, this single-item measure of happiness
has advantages over other multi-item scales of positive
well-being, particularly given that few researchers reported
the internal consistency of such psychometric measures
(see George, 2010 for a review).
We assessed negative well-being with the short version of
the Center for Epidemiological Studies­Depression scale
(CES-D; Radloff, 1977). Because the CES-D has been com-
monly used to assess the influence of social relationships
on the well-being of older adults (e.g., Fiori, Antonucci, &
Cortina, 2006), using this scale enhanced our study's com-
parability with the existing literature. NSHAP participants
indicated how often they had each of 11 kinds of thoughts
(e.g., "I felt everything I did was an effort") in the previous
week using a scale ranging from 0 = rarely or none of the
time to 3 = most of the time. We used the total score on these
11 items (reliability alpha = .79; range = 0­33).
Controls.--We controlled for five variables: participants'
age, level of education, racial background, and physical
health. Education levels were included as an ordered vari-
able consisting of four categories: 0 = less than high school,
1 = high school, 2 = some college, and 3 = bachelor's or
more. Race was classified into four categories (White,
Black, Non-Black Hispanic, and Other) with White as the
reference category in the analysis. Physical health was
included using participants' self-rated health, ranging from
0 = very poor to 4 = excellent. Despite its simplicity and
subjectivity, self-rated health has been shown to be a
powerful predictor of morbidity and mortality (Burström &
Fredlund, 2001).
We initially considered but did not include (a) the health
status of the partner as perceived by participants and (b)
participants' beliefs about sexual functioning and activities
such as how much they view sexual dysfunction to be typi-
cal in the aging process and how important they think sexual
activities are to maintaining partnerships. We anticipated
that these variables might influence participants' perception
of the sexual problems of their partner. For example, we
expected that older adults might accept their partner's
sexual problems if they perceive their partner to be in poor
health and/or if they consider sexual dysfunction to be typi-
cal in the aging process. We also expected that, if older
adults believe sexual relationships to be necessary to main-
tain partnerships, perceived sexual unresponsiveness of
partner might likely threaten the psychological well-being
of participants. Yet, our expectations were not supported.
Specifically, the association between perceived sexual unre-
sponsiveness of partner and psychological well-being did
not differ by perceived health status of partner or by beliefs
about sexual functioning and activities (i.e., the interaction
between sexual unresponsiveness and each of these vari-
ables was not significantly associated with psychological
well-being; results available upon request). Furthermore,
whether or not we included these variables in our models,
there was no change in the results regarding the relation
among perceived sexual unresponsiveness of partner,
perceived supportiveness of significant others, and psycho-
logical well-being. Thus, in the final analyses, we did not
include perceived health status of partner or participants'
belief about sexual functioning and activities.
Analytic Strategy
To handle missing data, we first conducted multiple
imputation using the ice program in Stata (Royston, 2005).
There were no missing data on the sociodemographic vari-
ables we used. The number of participants with missing
data was fewer than 20 for our independent and dependent
variables (e.g., perceived supportiveness, general happiness,
depressive symptoms) except for perceived sexual unre-
sponsiveness of partner. To infer missing data on a variable,
we relied on nonmissing responses for the other variables
HIRAYAMA AND WALKER
808
that were included in the analytic models (Allison, 2002).
By doing so, we generated five imputed data sets from
which to compute pooled estimates for our results (Acock,
2005). We concluded that our results are robust to imputa-
tion by comparing our findings to the results using listwise
deletion. Specifically, whether we used multiple imputation
or listwise deletion made little difference in the direction or
magnitude of regression coefficients in our analytic models;
only a few coefficients for the control variables failed to
reach significance when excluding incomplete cases.
We did not impute missing responses on whether the
partner had a sexual problem. Doing so would also require
us to infer how much participants were bothered by the
problem. When participants did not report whether their
partner had a sexual problem (i.e., don't know or refused to
answer), we treated them as not being bothered by the prob-
lem. Our focus is not on partner's sexual problems per se
(i.e., whether partner face sexual problems) but on partici-
pants' perception of partner's problems (i.e., how much
they are troubled by their partner's sexual problems). When
participants don't know whether their partner faces a sexual
problem, it seems reasonable to assume that they do not feel
troubled by this problem. Such an assumption might be
problematic for participants who refused to answer, but
fewer than 5% of participants did so for each item regarding
sexual problems. Furthermore, excluding those who refused
to answer changed only the significance of the coefficients
of independent variables, with little change in their magni-
tude or direction. Thus, we concluded that counting partici-
pants who don't know and refused to answer whether the
partner has a sexual problem as not feeling bothered by the
problem has little impact on the overall results.
Because gender is a key dimension of our study, it is
important to note a gender difference in missing responses
on partner's sexual problems. We found no gender differ-
ence in the number of respondents who refused to answer
items about any sexual problem of partner. For two types of
climaxing problems, however, more men than women didn't
know whether their partner experienced these problems: 96
(11.4%) men and 23 (4.6%) women didn't know whether
their partner was unable to climax; 80 (9.5%) men and 19
(3.8%) women didn't know whether their partner climaxed
too quickly. This gender difference suggests that men may
be less sensitive than women to partner's climaxing prob-
lems, and thus, "freer" from perceived sexual unresponsive-
ness of partner if their partner experiences only these types
of problems.
After creating the imputed data sets, we conducted multiple
group hierarchical regression analyses in which the model
was estimated separately but simultaneously for women and
for men. Each of the two types of psychological well-being,
general happiness and depressive symptoms, were regressed
separately on the same sets of independent variables. The
first block of independent variables involved feeling both-
ered by the perceived sexual unresponsiveness of a partner,
perceived support from close social partners, and controls.
This block was primarily intended to examine the associa-
tion between bothersome perceived sexual unresponsive-
ness of the partner and psychological well-being. Then, we
added the second block that consisted of three interaction
terms combining bothersome perceived sexual unrespon-
siveness of the partner with perceived support from each
of the three types of close relationships (i.e., partnerships,
family, and friend relationships). These interactions were
included to identify whether perceived support from signifi-
cant others could moderate the influence of bothersome
sexual unresponsiveness of the partner on well-being.
We used chi-square difference tests to examine (a) whether
the effects of bothersome perceived responsiveness might
differ for women and for men and (b) whether the effects of
bothersome perceived responsiveness might differ by type
of relationship. We ran the models in which coefficients
were constrained to be equal and then compared the con-
strained model with the original one in which coefficients
were freely estimated. If the model chi-square statistic for
the constrained model was significantly larger than that for
the unconstrained model, we would conclude that the
effects were different (a) between women and men and (b)
across relationship types.
Results
Gender Differences in Independent and Dependent
Variables
Table 1 summarizes descriptive statistics of our variables
of interest except those for sociodemographic background.
There was no significant gender difference in variables
related to spouse or partner. Among both women and men,
feeling bothered by partner's sexual problems was low
because half of the participants reported that their intimate
partner experienced no sexual dysfunction. Both women
and men perceived their intimate partner to be relatively
highly supportive. Perceived support from other relation-
ships differed by gender: Women perceived both their
family and friends to be more supportive than men. Regarding
psychological well-being, there was no significant gender
difference in general happiness, whereas depressive symp-
toms were higher among women than among men. There
was no significant gender difference in perceived self-rated
health status.
Effects of Perceived Sexual Unresponsiveness and Support
on Positive Well-being
Table 2 presents the results of multiple group hierarchical
regression analysis for general happiness. Feeling bothered
by partner's sexual problems did not have a significant
effect on either men's or women's general happiness. In
addition, no interaction term was significant; thus, the effect
of feeling bothered by partner's sexual problems on general
WHEN PARTNER HAS A SEXUAL PROBLEM 809
happiness was not moderated by perceived support from
any relationship.
We also examined whether the effects of perceived sup-
port might differ across relationship types. Our major focus
was on the moderating effects of perceived support, which
did not reach significance for either women or men. Never-
theless, we also analyzed whether its direct effects on
well-being differed across relationship types to test our
hypotheses about gender differences; that is, whether men
are more likely than women to prioritize their intimate part-
ner over other close relationships.
Results of the chi-square difference tests showed that
which relationship type influenced well-being differed by
gender (results not shown in Table 2). The direct effect of
perceived support from friends was significant only for
women, and its magnitude differed significantly between
women and men (c2 = 16.85, p < .001).Among both women
and men, the magnitude of the direct effect of perceived

support from the partner was significantly larger than both
that from family (c2 = 19.05, p < .001 for women; c2 =
16.49, p < .001 for men) and that from friends (c2 = 10.91,
p < .001 for women; c2 = 30.31, p < .001 for men).
Effects of Perceived Sexual Responsiveness and Support on
Negative Well-being
As shown in Table 3, feeling bothered by partner's sexual
problems was significantly associated with both women's
and men's depressive symptoms. A chi-square difference
test showed no gender difference in the magnitude of this
association. For women, however, perceived support from
intimate partner moderated this association significantly,
although the gender difference in the magnitude of this
moderating effect did not reach significance. The coefficient
of this moderating effect (B = -1.05) indicates that depres-
sive symptoms are lower among women whose spouse or
partner is perceived to be more supportive, when this spouse
or partner is also perceived to be sexually unresponsive.
Chi-square difference tests indicated that the moderating
effects of perceived support did not differ across relation-
ship types for either women or men (results not shown in
Table 3). The results for direct effects, however, indicated
gender differences by relationship types. For men, only
intimate partner's supportiveness was significant, and its
magnitude was significantly larger than both that of family's
(c2 = 4.29, p < .05) and that of friends' (c2 = 6.85, p < .01).
For women, however, both intimate partner's and family's
supportiveness had a significant negative effect on depres-
sive symptoms. Furthermore, the direct effect of these two
types of relationships did not differ significantly in magni-
tude, although the effect of friends' supportiveness did not
reach significance and its magnitude was significantly
smaller than that of intimate partner's (c2 = 13.51, p < .001).
In summary, men's psychological well-being was associ-
ated more strongly with the supportiveness of the intimate
partner than with that of family and friends. By contrast,
women's well-being was influenced by other relationships
as well, although only perceived support from their intimate
partner moderated the effect of sexual unresponsiveness on
their negative well-being.
Discussion
Guided by symbolic interactionism, the present study
explored whether feeling bothered by the perceived sexual
unresponsiveness of an intimate partner is associated with
the psychological well-being of older adults and whether
this association is moderated by perceived support from
multiple significant others. The results indicated a significant
association between feeling bothered by partner's sexual
problems and depressive symptoms. Note that this associa-
tion was significant even taking into account perceived

WHEN PARTNER HAS A SEXUAL PROBLEM 811
social support and physical health status, both of which
have been shown to be consistent predictors of well-being
(George, 2010). Furthermore, the association between feel-
ing bothered by partner's sexual problems and depression
did not differ by gender. Thus, both women and men are
likely to experience a negative psychological state when
their partner's sexual dysfunction makes it difficult to have
a sexual relationship.
The results suggest that, at least for women, being both-
ered by an intimate partner's sexual unresponsiveness can
be compensated by perceived supportiveness of this partner.
This moderating effect was significant for women's depres-
sive symptoms, the only well-being variable significantly
associated with bothersome perceived sexual unresponsive-
ness. By contrast, no moderating effect was significant for
men. Because chi-square difference tests showed no gender
difference in the magnitude of moderating effects, we
cannot conclude that women's psychological well-being is
more protected than men's by perceived support from their
intimate partner. Yet, men may face more difficulty than
women when perceiving their intimate partner to be sexu-
ally unresponsive because no close relationship moderated
the significant association between perceived sexual unre-
sponsiveness of partner and negative well-being.
Because neither family's nor friends' support had a sig-
nificant moderating effect, it appears that sexual unrespon-
siveness of intimate partner cannot be compensated by
supportiveness in close relationships other than partner-
ships. This result is in contrast with our previous findings on
the influences of multiple significant others on perceptions
of one's own sexual dysfunction (Hirayama & Walker,
2011). In the previous study, we found that confidant friend-
ships as well as partnerships moderate the association
between feeling bothered by one's own sexual problems
and psychological well-being (Hirayama & Walker, 2011).
The results of the present study for women, however, suggest
that feeling bothered by one's partner's sexual problems
can be resolved only within partnerships: Whether women
can manage the sexual unresponsiveness of their intimate
partner depends on whether this partner responds in a help-
ful manner in nonsexual aspects of the relationship.
At the same time, gender differences in the direct effects
of multiple significant others suggest that other close rela-
tionships, such as those with family and friends, may influence
whether older adults can manage the sexual unresponsive-
ness of their intimate partner through perceived support
from this partner. First, chi-square difference tests indicated
no gender difference in the magnitude of the direct effect of
sexual unresponsiveness of the spouse or partner or in the
magnitude of the direct effect of perceived support from the
spouse or partner on psychological well-being. Therefore,
the psychological impact of feeling bothered by the per-
ceived sexual unresponsiveness and supportiveness of an
intimate partner does not seem to differ by gender. In our
results, gender differences emerged in the direct effects of
family's and friends' supportiveness in comparison with
that of an intimate partner's. For women, friends' support-
iveness was associated with negative well-being in a similar
way to that of the intimate partner. By contrast, among men,
the direct effect of a partner's supportiveness on well-being
was greater than that of other relationships. Gerontological
research on social relationships has indicated that various
types of close relationships are needed to better cope with
problems individuals face in the process of aging (Adams &
Blieszner, 1995). Indeed, compared with older adults with
both active family and nonfamily ties, older adults who
engage with their spouse and children without socializing
with nonfamily members are at greater risk of mental health
problems (Fiori et al., 2006). It is thus suggested that spousal
relationships have a protective psychological effect on well-
being only when one has a close relationship with other
social partners. Diverse close social ties may be needed for
older adults to manage the sexual unresponsiveness of an
intimate partner through perceived support from this partner.
In other words, men's exclusive reliance on their intimate
partner may make it difficult for them to manage negative
feelings about the partner's sexual dysfunction, even when
their partner is supportive.
Overall, gender is a key dimension to explore how older
adults, with their social partners, can negotiate intimate
partnerships in facing sexual problems. In our previous
study (Hirayama & Walker, 2011), we found that confidant
partnerships can help men, but not women, handle negative
feelings about their own sexual dysfunction. In contrast, the
present analysis suggests that supportive partnerships pro-
tect women's, but not men's, well-being when feeling both-
ered by the partner's sexual dysfunction.Which relationship
is effective for whose sexual problems seems to differ by
gender. This complex gendered association among sexual
dysfunction, social relationships, and well-being should be
considered for researchers and health practitioners to better
help older adults with sexual problems. In addition, the
results also point to the need to study both positive and
negative aspects of well-being. Because the sexual unre-
sponsiveness of one's intimate partner had a significant
effect only on depressive symptoms, examining only either
positive or negative mental state could lead one to an inap-
propriate conclusion on the influences of sexual health
problems on psychological well-being.
Limitations and Future Directions
We acknowledge several limitations of our analysis. First,
we could not clarify how perceived sexual unresponsive-
ness of one's intimate partner influences the psychological
well-being of older adults. Despite some support from the
results especially regarding gender differences, the process
we hypothesized from symbolic interactionism remains
speculative because NSHAP data do not include an ade-
quate item for our hypothetical mediator, namely, self-view
HIRAYAMA AND WALKER

in terms of sexual partnering. The process linking the sexual
unresponsiveness of one's intimate partner to psychological
well-being (e.g., what mediates the association between the
two) needs to be clarified. Because we could not find an
effective moderator of the association between partner's
sexual unresponsiveness and the well-being of men, such
closer examination of the process may be particularly im-
portant to identify how to block the negative psychological
influence of feeling bothered by their partner's sexual dys-
function for men.
Second, because of the cross-sectional nature of our data,
we could not identify the causal direction between feelings
of being bothered by the perceived sexual unresponsiveness
of intimate partner and psychological well-being. Note that
our focus was perceived partner's responsiveness. Thus, the
significant association between sexual unresponsiveness
and negative well-being may mean that depressed older
adults perceive their partner to be sexually unresponsive. In
fact, research has indicated that depressed people seek more
positive feedback from close relationships than do nonde-
pressed people (Joiner & Timmons, 2009). Therefore,
depressed older adults may tend to perceive their partner's
behavior as unresponsive when, without such mental health
problems, the same behavior could be seen as responsive.
Third, our analytic sample was restricted to older adults
who engaged in sexual activities with their spouse or part-
ner in the last 12 months because only they reported whether
their partner experienced sexual dysfunction. Thus, we may
have excluded older adults whose partner had such severe
sexual dysfunction that they could not engage in sexual
activity. In other words, our results may not be applicable
to older couples facing serious or long-term sexual health
problems.
Fourth, we examined only limited forms of supportiveness
of significant others because few such items were available
in the data set. There should be many other forms of respon-
siveness older adults may expect from their social partners.
Examining few types of perceived supportiveness might
explain why we found no significant moderating effect of
significant others for men. The literature on close relationships
suggests that women and men find closeness and intimacy
in different types of social interactions (Wood, 2000). For
example, studies have shown that men are more likely than
women to associate close friendships with sharing activities
(e.g., Fehr, 2004; Walker, 1995). Thus, men may perceive
their social partners to be responsive if these partners share
the same interests rather than provide such socioemotional
support as we included in the analysis. In summary, consid-
ering diverse forms of perceived responsiveness could draw
a different, more precise picture of the association among
the sexual unresponsiveness of an intimate partner, perceived
support from multiple significant others, and psychological
well-being, especially in relation to gender.
Finally, we urge caution in comparing the results for positive
versus negative well-being because of the measurement
imbalance between these two. Whereas our measure of
negative well-being (i.e., depressive symptoms) comprised
multiple items, positive well-being (i.e., general happiness)
was assessed with a single item. Furthermore, because pos-
sible variability in positive well-being was limited among
respondents, fewer independent variables were significant
for positive than for negative well-being. For example, feelings
of being bothered by the perceived sexual unresponsiveness
of partner were associated only with negative well-being.
To clarify whether and how sexual relationships are associ-
ated differently with positive and with negative well-being,
it would be necessary to assess both types of well-being
with comparable measures.
Despite these limitations, the results suggest that social
gerontology has the potential to make a significant contribu-
tion to the growing field of sexual health among older adults.
Although the role of medical treatment has received much
attention in this field, our findings are consistent with previ-
ous research on the health- and well-being­related effects
of close relationships for older women and men. Existing
literature on social relationships will likely help us to iden-
tify how older adults, with the support from their social
partners, can better manage aging-related sexual problems.
Given the association between sexual relationships and
well-being in older age, such investigation should help indi-
viduals to have a higher quality of later life despite declines
in sexual functioning.
