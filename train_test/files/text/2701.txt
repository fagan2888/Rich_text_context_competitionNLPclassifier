IN THE UNITED STATES IN 2006,
there were 19 525 000 emergency
department (ED) visits by pa-
tients aged 15 to 24 years.1 The ED
is an important contact point for medi-
cal care for adolescents, especially un-
derinsured and uninsured patients.2,3
Prevention programs in the ED may
reach adolescents who do not attend
school regularly, who lack a primary
care physician, or who view them-
selves as too old to be seen by pedia-
tricians and have not established adult
medical care.

Context Emergency department (ED) visits present an opportunity to deliver brief
interventions to reduce violence and alcohol misuse among urban adolescents at risk
of future injury.
Objective To determine the efficacy of brief interventions addressing violence and
alcohol use among adolescents presenting to an urban ED.
Design, Setting, and Participants Between September 2006 and September 2009,
3338 patients aged 14 to 18 years presenting to a level I ED in Flint, Michigan, be-
tween 12 PM and 11 PM 7 days a week completed a computerized survey (43.5% male;
55.9% African American). Adolescents reporting past-year alcohol use and aggres-
sion were enrolled in a randomized controlled trial (SafERteens).
Intervention All patients underwent a computerized baseline assessment and were
randomized to a control group that received a brochure (n = 235) or a 35-minute brief
intervention delivered by either a computer (n = 237) or therapist (n = 254) in the ED,
with follow-up assessments at 3 and 6 months. Combining motivational interviewing
with skills training, the brief intervention for violence and alcohol included review of
goals, tailored feedback, decisional balance exercise, role plays, and referrals.
Main Outcome Measures Self-report measures included peer aggression and vio-
lence, violence consequences, alcohol use, binge drinking, and alcohol consequences.
Results About 25% (n = 829) of screened patients had positive results for both alco-
hol and violence; 726 were randomized. Compared with controls, participants in the thera-
pist intervention showed self-reported reductions in the occurrence of peer aggression
(therapist, -34.3%; control, -16.4%; relative risk [RR], 0.74; 95% confidence interval
[CI], 0.61-0.90), experience of peer violence (therapist, -10.4%; control, 4.7%; RR,
0.70;95%CI,0.52-0.95),andviolenceconsequences(therapist,-30.4%;control,-13.0%;
RR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.64-0.90) at 3 months. At 6 months, participants in the therapist
intervention showed self-reported reductions in alcohol consequences (therapist, -32.2%;
control, -17.7%; odds ratio, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.34-0.91) compared with controls; partici-
pants in the computer intervention also showed self-reported reductions in alcohol con-
sequences (computer, -29.1%; control, -17.7%; odds ratio, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.34-0.95).
Conclusion Among adolescents identified in the ED with self-reported alcohol use
and aggression, a brief intervention resulted in a decrease in the prevalence of self-
reported aggression and alcohol consequences.

proaches could substantially affect pub-
lichealth,especiallyifdesignedtobeeas-
ily incorporated into ED practice.
Computerized brief interventions are
mostly untested in the ED and offer a
practical solution to barriers in this
setting.
This article examines 3- and 6-month
outcomes from a randomized con-
trolled trial (RCT) (SafERteens) of a
therapist brief intervention (assisted by
computer) or a computer brief inter-
vention vs a control condition among
adolescents aged 14 to 18 years pre-
senting to an urban ED who screened
positive for violence and alcohol use.
Hypotheses were that the therapist and
computer interventions would be more
effective than the control in reducing
violence and alcohol misuse at 3 and 6
months' follow-up.
METHODS
Study Design and Setting
The SafERteens RCT took place at Hur-
ley Medical Center in Flint, Michigan,
a level I trauma center. Study proce-
dures were approved by the Univer-
sity of Michigan and Hurley Medical
Center institutional review boards; a
National Institutes of Health Certifi-
cate of Confidentiality for human sub-
jects was obtained.
Emergency department patients
aged 14 to 18 years who presented
for medical illness or injury were eli-
gible for screening. Exclusions were
acute sexual assault or suicidal ide-
ation, altered mental status preclud-
ing consent, or medical instability
(ie, abnormal vital signs).
Recruitment occurred between 12 PM
and 11 PM 7 days a week (September
2006­September 2009), excluding ma-
jor holidays. Adolescent patients iden-
tified from electronic logs were ap-
proached by research assistants in
waiting rooms or treatment spaces. Fol-
lowing obtainment of written consent
(and assent and parent/guardian con-
sent if 18 years), participants self-
administered a 15-minute computer-
ized survey with audio and received a
$1.00 gift.
After completing the survey, partici-
pants reporting both past-year aggres-
sion (peer, dating, weapon carriage/
use) and alcohol consumption ("In the
past 12 months, have you had a drink
of beer, wine or liquor more than two
to three times? Do not count just a sip
or taste of someone else's drink.")15
were eligible for the RCT. Participants
reporting only 1 behavior (aggression
or alcohol use) were not eligible.
Following obtainment of written
consent (and assent and parent/
guardian consent if 18 years) for the
RCT, participants self-administered a
computerized baseline assessment ($20
remuneration). As required by the in-
stitutional review board, participants
were told they would be randomly as-
signed to 1 of 3 groups: computer ses-
sion, counselor session, or brochure.
Participants were blinded to condi-
tion assignment until after the base-
line assessment. After the baseline, par-
ticipants were randomized and received
the therapist brief intervention, com-
puter brief intervention, or control bro-
chure during the ED visit. Randomiza-
tion was stratified by sex and age (14-15
or 16-18 years) and assigned based on
computer-generated algorithm and
using numbered sealed envelopes. Ran-
domization occurred in blocks of 21 (7
per group).
Participants self-administered com-
puterized follow-up assessments 3 and
6 months after the ED visit at a conve-
nient location (eg, home, ED, restau-
rant); remuneration was $25 and $30,
respectively. Follow-up staff were
blinded to baseline condition assign-
ment.
Outcome Measures
Previously validated measures were
used; piloting (n=23) was conducted
to ensure that youth could under-
stand and self-administer the assess-
ments and interventions.16-18 The time
frame for questions was the past year
at screening/baseline and past 3 months
at follow-ups.
Demographic information col-
lected included age, sex, race, ethnic-
ity, and receipt of public assistance.15
Alcohol use frequency, quantity (on
a typical occasion), and binge drink-
ing (5 drinks) were assessed with the
Alcohol Use Disorders Identification
Test­Consumption (AUDIT-C).19,20 As
recommended for adolescents,21 binge
drinking quantity was 5 drinks or more
instead of 6 or more. Piloting revealed
that question 1 response options were
misunderstood by urban teens and were
replaced with the response options for
question 3. An alcohol consumption
summary variable was computed
(=.81); among adolescents, the cut-
off is 3 or more for an alcohol use
disorder.21
The 17-item substance abuse scale
from the Problem Oriented Screening
Instrument for Teenagers (POSIT)22
measured alcohol consequences (eg,
missed school, trouble getting along
with friends because of drinking). An
alcohol consequences summary vari-
able was created (=.83). Among ado-
lescents, the cutoff is 2 for an alcohol
use disorder.23
Ten items24,25 assessed frequency
of aggression toward peers and in-
cludedmoderate(eg,pushedorshoved)
and severe (eg, hit or punched, used a
knife/gun) aggression (=.86). Peer ag-
gression was computed by summing the
midpoint of the responses.26 Knife/
razor and gun carriage frequency was
assessed using 2 items. Two items as-
sessed frequency of moderate and se-
vere dating aggression.5,27
Experiencingmoderateorseverepeer
violence was assessed by collapsing the
moderate and severe peer aggression
items into 2 questions. The score was
computed by summing the midpoint of
the items (=.77).
Using a 7-item scale developed for
this study, participants identified con-
sequences of fighting (ie, trouble at
school, hurt someone, constant desire
to fight, family or friends suggested they
stop, arguments with family or friends,
trouble getting along with friends, in-
ability to control fighting). A violence
consequences summary variable was
created (=.78).

SafERteens Interventions
Participants who were randomized to
the brief interventions received their
assigned condition prior to ED dis-
charge in treatment spaces; interven-
tions could be stopped and restarted
as needed to avoid interference with
medical care. Research staff ensured
that sessions were completed pri-
vately. Participants in all groups,
including the control condition,
received a brochure with community
resources. The SafERteens brief inter-
ventions were based on principles of
motivational interviewing29,30 but also
involved normative resetting and alco-
hol refusal and conflict resolution
skills practice.31 The therapist and
computer interventions were designed
to have similar sections but with dif-
ferent modes of presentation. They
were developed to be culturally rel-
evant for urban youth, of whom at this
study site approximately 50% were
African American. The sections
included goals, personalized feedback
for alcohol, violence, and weapon car-
riage, decisional balance exercise for
the potential benefit of staying away
from drinking and fighting, 5 tailored
role plays (eg, anger management,
conflict resolution, alcohol refusals,
not drinking and driving), and refer-
ral. Although both interventions
reviewed these content areas in a way
that was consistent with tenets of
motivational interviewing (ie, non-
judgmental), the mode of delivery
resulted in important differences. For
example, it was not possible for the
computer to provide complex inter-
personal responses that a skilled thera-
pist could deliver.
The therapist intervention was also
facilitated by a tablet laptop computer
that displayed tailored feedback for par-
ticipants and screens to prompt con-
tent for the therapists. Research social
workers were initially trained on mo-
tivational interviewing techniques and
the specific SafERteens intervention.
Based on harm reduction principles,
which are well suited for adoles-
cents,32,33 motivational interviewing em-
phasizes developing a discrepancy be-
tween current behavior and future goals
and increasing problem recognition,
motivation, and self-efficacy. To en-
sure fidelity, sessions were audio-
taped and 20% were coded based on ad-
herence and competence; therapists
received individual and group super-
vision and periodic retrainings through-
out the study.
The computer intervention devel-
oped for this study was a stand-alone
interactive animated program31 with
touch screens and audio via head-
phones to ensure privacy. An ani-
mated character guided participants
through the intervention components
via audio feedback for the choices made,
focusing on tipping the decisional bal-
ance away from risk behaviors. The en-
tire computer program was an interac-
tion, not passively viewed. For example,
during the role-play scenarios, partici-
pants had to interact with peers and
make behavioral choices about drink-
ing and fighting.

assigned condition. Because of base-
line differences by condition in rates
of participant school dropout, this
variable was initially included in
analyses to control for group differ-
ences. Models are presented without
this covariate, however, because it
was unrelated to outcomes when it
was included in initial analyses. For
descriptive purposes, rates of occur-
rence of risk behaviors are presented
as percentages along with percentage
change at 3 and 6 months. At base-
line, a single imputation procedure
was used to complete missing alcohol
misuse scores for 5 participants. The
1-tailed statistical significance was set
at P.05 and was expressed as a 95%
confidence interval.
Data were analyzed using general-
ized estimating equations (GEE) due
to the correlated structure of data
from repeated measures at baseline
and 3- and 6-month follow-up.34 The
GEE analyses allow for observed vari-
able distributions (eg, binary/logit,
continuous/negative binomial). An
intention-to-treat approach was used
in which all randomized participants
(n=726) were included because GEE
analyses include all cases, even drop-
outs, by using available pairs to esti-
mate working correlation parameters
for the entire sample. The study was
powered to detect differences between
intervention groups and the control,
not between treatment conditions (eg,
therapist brief intervention and com-
puter brief intervention); thus, analy-
ses compared each intervention con-
dition separately with the control
condition. Based on 15% reduction in
occurrence of a risk behavior and
P.05 significance, 107 per group
was needed for 80% power; thus, the
analyses were adequately powered.
Because the intervention focused on
decreasing the occurrence as well as the
frequency of the risk behaviors, GEE
analyses were conducted examining
group differences over time in the oc-
currence (binary variables) and fre-
quency (continuous variables) of pri-
mary outcomes (ie, peer aggression,
violence consequences, alcohol mis-
use [AUDIT-C score], binge drinking,
and alcohol consequences) and sec-
ondary outcomes (ie, experiencing peer
violence). The GEE analyses pro-
duces a model group  time interac-
tion effect, as well as specific group 
time interaction effects for the thera-
pist and computer conditions com-
pared with the control. For conserva-
tive purposes, only models with
significant overall group  time inter-
action effects were examined further to
determine intervention effectiveness (ie,
therapist group  time interaction,
computer group  time interaction).
A significant therapist group  time in-
teraction effect indicates that the inter-
vention condition significantly differs
from the control in a specific out-
come; thus, this analysis approach con-
siders baseline values and the relative
change over time in outcomes based on
groupassignment.Becauseviolencewas
a common occurrence, relative risks are
reported for violence-related vari-
ables; for alcohol-related variables, odds
ratios are reported because these are
less common events and this allows for
comparison with the published
literature.
Regarding effect sizes, for out-
comes using binary variables percent-
age change was computed. For con-
tinuous variables, Cohen effect sizes35
were calculated, which indicate the
strength of the relationship between the
intervention and the observed out-
come and allow for comparisons across
studies; the prevention literature sug-
gests that effect sizes of 0.10 or higher
are clinically meaningful.36

Occurrence of Violence/
Alcohol Use
Generalized estimating equation mod-
els were computed for occurrence of
violence (severe peer aggression, any
experience of peer violence, any vio-
lence consequences) and alcohol (al-
cohol misuse 3, any binge drinking,
alcohol consequences 2) at 3 and 6
months (TABLE 2 shows descriptive
data; TABLE 3 and TABLE 4 show GEE
results). Participants in the therapist in-
tervention were less likely to report any
severe peer aggression at 3 months
(model group  time interaction,

(model group  time interaction,

els were not significant for severe peer
aggression at 6 months, alcohol mis-
use and binge drinking at 3 and 6
months, or alcohol consequences at 3
months. At 6 months, the alcohol con-
sequences model was significant (model
group  time interaction, 2

COMMENT
Although replication is required, our
data provide novel findings demon-
strating that a brief intervention for vio-
lence and alcohol among adolescents
presenting to an urban ED shows prom-
ise, reducing experience of peer vio-
lence and alcohol consequences. Given
that a leading cause of mortality and
morbidity in this age group is vio-
lence, the reduction in the occurrence
of severe violence following a single-
session brief intervention is clinically
meaningful. Specifically, only 8 at-
risk adolescents (with past-year alco-
hol use and aggression) would need to
receive the therapist intervention to pre-
vent severe peer aggression in 1 ado-
lescent. In addition, participants in the
therapist intervention reported a re-
duction in the occurrence of experi-
encing peer violence and violence con-
sequences at 3 months. Clinically, a
trained ED-based therapist would need
to deliver this 30-minute intervention
to 10 at-risk adolescents to prevent 1
adolescent from being victimized by a
peer. In a similar manner, the number
of adolescents needed to treat with the
therapist intervention is 6 to reduce vio-
lence consequences in 1 adolescent.
This study focused on at-risk youth
seeking general ED care for a single-
session intervention delivered com-
pletely during the teachable moment of
the acute care visit. Prior hospital and
ED interventions for youth violence
have focused on patients with inten-
tional injury and have typically used
multisession case management or men-
toring approaches.6,9,37 Additional stud-
ies with larger samples of adolescents
who are seeking care following an in-
tentional injury (eg, assault, gunshot)
are needed to determine the effective-
ness of this intervention among youth
with more severe violence profiles. Few
ED studies have examined alcohol brief
interventions among adolescents. Ado-
lescents in the therapist intervention
and the computer intervention were less
likely to report alcohol-related conse-
quences (eg, missed school, trouble
with friends) than those in the control
condition over the 6-month follow-
up. Clinically, to prevent alcohol
consequences in 1 adolescent, 17 ado-
lescents would need to receive the

therapist intervention; alternatively, 13
adolescents would need to receive the
computer intervention to prevent al-
cohol consequences in 1 adolescent.
These mixed findings for reductions in
alcohol consequences but not con-
sumption are consistent with prior ado-
lescent studies of a therapist brief in-
tervention11 and computer brief
intervention38 in the ED.
Data from this study did not sup-
port the effectiveness of the stand-
alone computerized intervention for re-
ducing violence. It is important to
recognize, however, that a computer
played a role in the therapist condi-
tion. Assessments were computerized
and the adolescents and therapists re-
viewed tailored feedback presented on
the computer. The computer screens
standardized the delivery of the inter-
vention by the therapist; such ap-
proaches are appealing as a mecha-
nism to prompt content for busy ED
staff.
A limitation of this study is that it is
not possible for participants to be
blinded to the intervention condition
given current institutional review board
requirements. This concern is some-
what mitigated by blinding of fol-
low-up staff to intervention condition
assignment as well as by the self-
administered nature of assessments.
Findings may not generalize to pa-
tient groups not included in this single-
site study, such as adolescents present-
ing during overnight shifts or with acute
suicidal ideation/attempt or sexual as-
sault. Although the sample reflected the
ED study site composition, replica-
tion with other sites and samples (eg,
Hispanics) are needed. The self-report
data are a potential limitation; how-
ever, recent reviews support the reli-
ability and validity of self-report of risk
behaviors when privacy/confidential-
ity is ensured and when using self-
administered computerized assess-
ments.39 Although the follow-up rates
exceeded 85% and analyses included all
participants regardless of dropout, at-
trition is a limitation of this study. Find-
ings are limited by the 6-month follow-
up. Future studies are needed that
examine long-term follow-up, modera-
tors of outcome such as age, and the
temporal relationship between acute al-
cohol consumption and violence using
calendar-based assessments.40
CONCLUSION
Although replication is required, find-
ings support the efficacy of a therapist
brief intervention (with computerized
feedback and structure) in decreasing
the occurrence of experiencing peer vio-
lence in the 3 months following an ED
visit. In addition, both the therapist and
the computer brief interventions were
effective at reducing alcohol conse-
quences over 6 months. Computer-
ized approaches could assist in trans-
lating research findings into routine
clinical practice by standardizing in-
tervention delivery and have wide ap-
plicability across other content areas
and settings.
