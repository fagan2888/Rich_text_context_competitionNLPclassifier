Abstract
We recently reported a significant positive association in
the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
between high levels of total calcium in serum, measured
prospectively, and risk of fatal prostate cancer.
To confirm this, we examined associations between
total and ionized serum calcium and prostate cancer
mortality in an independent cohort, the Third National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Twenty-five
prostate cancer deaths occurred over 56,625 person-years
of follow-up. Compared with men in the lowest tertile
of total serum calcium, the multivariate-adjusted
relative risk for death from prostate cancer for men in
the highest tertile was 2.07 (95% confidence interval,
1.06-4.04). For ionized serum calcium, the physiologic-
ally active fraction of total serum calcium, the relative
risk for men in the highest tertile was 3.18 (95%
confidence interval, 1.09-9.28). These findings support
the hypothesis that serum calcium is a prospective
biomarker of fatal prostate cancer. (Cancer Epidemiol
Biomarkers Prev 2009;18(2):575­8)
Introduction
Prostate cancer is the second most fatal cancer among
men in the United States, accounting for f28,000 deaths
in 2008 (1). Considerable epidemiologic attention in
prostate cancer has focused on the vitamin D­endocrine
system and on calcium (2­4). Although numerous
studies have investigated prostate cancer with respect
to calcium intake from the diet, the subject of calcium
in serum has received scarce attention, perhaps because
calcium levels in serum are believed to be under strict
homeostatic control. In the only study to specifically
address this question, we found an f3-fold increased
risk of fatal prostate cancer in the National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES I) Epidemio-
logic Follow-up Study for men with levels of total serum
calcium in the upper tertile at the baseline exam (5). In
this article, we confirm and extend that finding using
an independent cohort, the Third National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III). A unique
feature of NHANES III is that it included measurements
of ionized serum calcium, the physiologically active
fraction of total serum calcium.
Materials and Methods
Data were derived from NHANES III, which provides
public use mortality files with record linkage of
participants in NHANES III to the National Death Index
(6). Eight thousand one hundred twenty-five men partici-
pated in NHANES III. We excluded men with missing
information on serum calcium (n = 1,210), a prior history
of cancer (except nonmelanoma skin cancer; n = 199),
men who died from prostate cancer within 12 months
of examination (n = 2), and men without follow-up
information (n = 4). The final analytic cohort consisted of
6,710 men ages 18 to 90 years at the baseline examination
in 1988 to 1994. Because of the concern that calcium levels
in serum could be influenced by the presence of
undetected prostate cancer, we did additional analyses
excluding prostate cancer deaths that occurred during
the first 3 years of follow-up (n = 8).
We evaluated associations between prostate cancer
mortality, total serum calcium, and ionized serum
calcium corrected for serum pH. Approximately half of
the total serum calcium is in the ionized or physiolog-
ically active state. Another 40% is bound to serum
proteins, principally albumin, and the remaining 10% is
bound to anions, such as lactate and phosphate. Because
the binding of calcium to proteins is altered by changes
in blood pH, measures of ionized calcium in blood are
commonly pH corrected to a standard pH using
regression analysis (7).
Person-time was computed as the number of months
from initial examination to date of prostate cancer
mortality (events), death from another cause, or the end
of follow-up in December 31, 2000 (nonevents). We
estimated relative risks adjusted for potential confound-
ers using Cox proportional hazards. Multivariate models
included age (in 1-year increments) and body mass index
(BMI; as a continuous measure), as potential confound-
ers, and variables related to NHANES III sample weights

non-Hispanic), household size (number of individuals
up to 10), and general health status (excellent, very good,
good, fair, or poor)] to account for differential probabil-
ities of selection and nonresponse (8). Statistical analysis
used SAS (v9.1 for Linux) and Sudaan (v9 for Linux) to
account for the complex sampling designs of the cohort.
All statistical tests were two-sided.
Results
Twenty-five prostate cancer deaths occurred among
6,710 men over 56,625 person-years of follow up.
Measurement of serum calcium preceded fatal prostate
cancer by an average of 5.3 years (SD 2.5). The average
age at baseline of prostate cancer cases was 73.4 years
and their average age at death was 78.1 years. Men in
the higher tertiles of total serum calcium tended to be
younger, to be black, to have lower BMI, to be from a
large household, and to be in good or better health.
Similar relationships were observed for increasing
tertiles of ionized calcium. The mean ages in tertiles 1
through 3 of ionized serum calcium were 45.2, 41.4, and
38.5 years, respectively (Table 1).
Compared with men in the lowest tertile of total
serum calcium, men in the highest tertile had a
multivariate-adjusted relative risk (RR) for prostate
cancer death of 2.07 [95% confidence interval (95% CI),
1.06-4.04]. This association was not materially changed
after adjustment for BMI (RR, 2.02; 95% CI, 1.02-4.01).
The RR for men in the second tertile was 1.39 (95% CI,
0.59-3.30). The test for linear trend was not statistically
significant (Ptrend
= 0.26). Compared with men in the
lowest tertile of ionized serum calcium, the RR for fatal
prostate cancer among men in the highest tertile was
3.18 (95% CI, 1.09-9.28). Adjustment for BMI did not
substantially alter this risk (RR, 3.12; 95% CI, 1.04-9.43).
The RR for men in the second tertile was 1.82 (95% CI,
0.64-5.12). The linear trend was not statistically signifi-
cant (Ptrend
= 0.15; Table 2).
Discussion
We found a doubling of risk for fatal prostate cancer
among men in the highest tertile of total serum calcium
and a tripling of risk for men in the highest tertile of
ionized serum calcium. The results for total serum
calcium are consistent with our previous findings for
prostate cancer mortality in NHANES I in which we
observed a multivariable-adjusted RR of 2.68 (5). This
is the first study to examine prostate cancer risk in
relation to prediagnostic levels of ionized serum
calcium.

Each individual is believed to have his or her own set
point for serum calcium that is under genetic control (9).
The concentration of ionized serum calcium in a given
individual normally does not deviate by >2% from its set
point (10). Conversely, there is considerable variation in
calcium levels between individuals, with normal levels
of total serum calcium ranging from 8.5 to 10.5 mg/dL
(2.1-2.6 mmol/L; ref. 11).
This study has several strengths. It is hypothesis
testing, is prospective, and uses a population that is
representative of the U.S. population. The greatest threat
to the validity of prospective cohort studies, loss to
follow-up for mortality, was very low [4 of 6,714 (0.06%)].
Measurement of calcium in serum preceded death from
prostate cancer by an average of 5.3 years (SD 2.5).
Because the latency between blood draw and death was
relatively short, the presence of occult prostate cancer
could have influenced the levels of calcium in serum
(i.e., ``reverse causality''). However, this possibility likely
would reduce the relative risks because men with ad-
vanced prostate cancer typically are normocalcemic or
hypocalcemic due to the transfer of calcium ions from
serum into bony metastases (12, 13). To address this
possibility, we analyzed the data after excluding fatal
prostate cancers that occurred within 36 months of the
baseline examination. Compared with men in the lowest
tertile of ionized serum calcium, the relative hazard for
fatal prostate cancer for men in the middle tertile was
2.58 (95% CI, 0.66-10.02) and for men in the highest tertile
was 4.65 (95% CI, 1.40-15.49). Thus, reverse causality is
an unlikely explanation for the positive association
between ionized serum calcium and prostate cancer
mortality.
Our results could be influenced by misclassification
and by confounding. The use of total serum calcium as
an exposure variable is subject to misclassification
because f50% of the total calcium in serum is non-
ionized and is physiologically inert (11). The potential
misclassification associated with ionized serum calcium,
the physiologically active fraction of total serum calcium,
is far smaller. This is consistent with our finding of a
substantially higher relative risk of prostate cancer in
relation to ionized serum calcium than in relation to total
serum calcium (RR, 3.2 versus 2.1, respectively).
Fatal prostate cancer was measured using record
linkage between NHANES III and the National Death
Index. To preserve the privacy of participants in
NHANES III, an algorithm applied to the Public Use
Mortality Data files randomly reassigned the cause of
death for some participants, a procedure that may have
introduced some misclassification. Because the misclas-
sification was nondifferential with respect to exposure,
it should underestimate the true association between
serum calcium and prostate cancer mortality. Finally,
several epidemiologic studies have implicated vitamin D
deficiency as a risk factor for prostate cancer (2). Vitamin
D deficiency is unlikely to confound the observed
association between prostate cancer and high serum
calcium because vitamin D deficiency is associated with
normocalcemia or hypocalcemia (11).
In persons without cancer, most cases of serum
calcium that are elevated outside the reference range
are caused by elevated serum levels of parathyroid
hormone; (PTH), i.e., primary hyperparathyroidism
(11). Similarly, some persons with serum calcium levels
that are elevated but within the reference range may
have ``high normal'' levels of serum PTH. It is therefore
unclear whether the mechanism for the increased risk of
fatal prostate cancer that we observed in association with
elevated serum calcium involves elevated serum calci-
um, elevated serum PTH, or both factors. There are
plausible mechanisms by which either high levels of
calcium or PTH could each increase prostate cancer
mortality (14). For example, prostate cancer cells express
the calcium-sensing receptor and the common receptor
for PTH and parathyroid hormone-related protein
(PTHrP). At physiologic levels, both calcium and PTH
promote the proliferation and metastasis of prostate
cancer cells (15, 16).
Relatively small differences in the levels of ionized
calcium in serum were associated with large differences
in the risk of fatal prostate cancer. The effects of small
differences in the levels of ionized serum calcium could
be magnified at sites of bony metastases via feed-forward
mechanism. As shown by Sanders et al., ionized calcium
in serum induces prostate cancer cells to synthesize
PTHrP, which causes local osteolysis of bone, resulting in
greatly elevated levels of extracellular calcium within the
bony microenvironment (16). Whereas ionized calcium
in serum normally circulates at 1.1 to 1.3 mmol/L, levels
of extracellular calcium in the bony microenvironment
of metastatic prostate cancer cells may reach 8 to
40 mmol/L (17). These high levels of extracellular
calcium then elicit further secretion of PTHrP by prostate
cancer cells which exacerbates the progression of
osteolytic and osteoblastic metastases (18).
Our results may help to resolve some discrepant
findings in the literature on dietary calcium and prostate
cancer risk (4, 19, 20, 21). Several studies have reported
a positive association between high levels of dietary
calcium, from food and from supplements, and ad-
vanced and/or fatal prostate cancer. For example, in the
Health Professionals Follow-up Study, Giovannucci et al.
found a significantly increased risk of advanced and fatal
prostate cancer at calcium intakes of 1,500 to 1,999 mg/d
with greatest risk at intakes >2,000 mg/d (20). (The
recommended allowance for calcium for men ages
51 years and older is 1,200 mg/d.) Conversely, most
epidemiologic studies reporting more moderate intakes
of dietary calcium have not found significantly elevated
risks (19).
Calcium levels in serum are tightly controlled over a
wide range of dietary calcium and generally are not
correlated with dietary intake of calcium (22, 23).
However, the consumption of large quantities of calcium
(e.g., via self-medication with calcium supplements, such
as calcium-containing antacids) can cause hypercalcemia
in some individuals (24). Thus, we hypothesize that
calcium intakes that exceed the recommended allowance
may increase the risk of fatal prostate cancer because
these intakes may increase the levels of calcium in serum.
Our results are based on a small number of deaths
(n = 25) and the confidence intervals around the relative
risks are relatively large. Thus, these findings require
confirmation by other prospective studies. If confirmed,
our finding that prediagnostic levels of ionized calcium
in serum strongly predict risk of fatal prostate cancer
has important implications for clinical decision making
and for prostate cancer prevention. For example,
most incident prostate cancers that are detected using

prostate-specific antigen screening would not prove fatal
if untreated. Thus, deciding which screen-detected
cancers need treatment is intensely problematic (25).
High levels of serum calcium significantly predicted fatal
but not incident prostate cancer in NHANES I and
significantly predicted fatal prostate cancer in NHANES
III (for which data on incident cancers are not available).
This suggests that in addition to other clinical variables,
the knowledge of a man¶s serum calcium level could
contribute to informed decisions about whether his
cancer is likely to be life-threatening and therefore
require therapy. Because the relative risks associated
with elevated serum calcium are high and because levels
of calcium in serum can be changed (13), further study
of the role of serum calcium in the natural history of
prostate cancer should be a research priority.
