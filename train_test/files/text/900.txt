Objectives. Social support and social networks have been shown to exert significant effects on health and functioning among
elderly persons. Although theorists have speculated that the strength of these effects may differ as a function of sociodemo-
graphic characteristics and prior health status, few studies have directly tested the moderating effects of these variables.
Methods. Longitudinal data from the MacArthur Study of Successful Aging were used to examine the effects of structural
and functional social support on changes in physical functioning over a 7-year period, measured by the Nagi scale, in a sample
of initially high-functioning men and women aged 70 to 79 years. Multiple regression analyses were used to test the main ef-
fects of social support and social network variables, as well as their interactions with gender, income, and baseline physical per-
formance.
Results. After controlling for potential confounding effects, respondents with more social ties showed less functional de-
cline. The beneficial effects of social ties were stronger for respondents who were male or had lower levels of baseline physical
performance.
Discussion. The effects of social support and social networks may vary according to the individual's gender and baseline
physical capabilities. Studies of functional decline among elderly persons should not ignore this population variation in the ef-
fects of social networks.
THE aging of the United States population, recent develop-
ments in medical treatment, and improvements in health
behaviors have resulted in a dramatic increase in the elderly
population. Unfortunately, many elderly people experience
functional disabilities that compromise their quality of life, so
the added years of life can be marred by physical impairment.
As a consequence, preservation of functional independence in
elderly persons has become an important goal of medical re-
search. Although it was once commonly believed that func-
tional decline was inevitable in old age, recent studies have re-
vealed that some elderly people seem to be protected from
functional decline, and a significant proportion of impaired el-
derly people regain physical functioning (Beckett et al., 1996;
Crimmins & Saito, 1993).
Subsequent studies have identified the demographic, medi-
cal, behavioral, and psychological characteristics associated
with maintenance of functional independence. Compared with
elderly people who experience functional decline, "successful
agers"--those who experience little or no decline--are more
likely to be male, White, free of chronic disease, and have high
levels of education and income (Mor, Wilcox, Rakowski, &
Hiris, 1994; Seeman, Berkman, Blazer, & Rowe, 1994;
Strawbridge, Cohen, Shema, & Kaplan, 1996). Those who
practice healthy behaviors such as physical activity (Seeman et
al., 1995; Simonsick et al., 1993; Strawbridge et al., 1996) and
refrain from unhealthy behaviors such as smoking (Parker,
Thorslund, Lundberg, & Kareholt, 1996) and heavy alcohol
consumption (Scherr, LaCroix, Wallace, & Berkman, 1992)
also are likely to age more successfully. In addition, psychoso-
cial factors such as self-efficacy (Mendes de Leon, Seeman,
Baker, Richardson, & Tinetti, 1996; Seeman & Unger, 1997),
lack of depression (Strawbridge et al., 1996), and good self-
rated health (Mor et al., 1994) are associated with more suc-
cessful aging.
Social support and social networks also are associated with
health outcomes in elderly persons, including a lower risk of
mortality, cardiovascular disease, cancer mortality, and func-
tional decline (for reviews, see Berkman, 1995; Seeman, 1996;
Thoits, 1995). These protective effects of social networks may
result from several processes. These include provision of access
to information about health and health care services (Bloom,
1990), encouragement of healthy behaviors (Bovbjerg et al.,
1995; Mermelstein, Cohen, Lichtenstein, Kanmark, & Baer,
1986), encouragement of health care utilization (Bleeker,
Lamers, Leenders, & Kruyssen, 1995), provision of tangible
aid (Thoits, 1995), provision of emotional support to facilitate
coping with life stress (Thoits, 1995), enhancement of feelings
of self-esteem and control (Krause & Borawski-Clark, 1994),
S245
S246 UNGERETAL
and influences on neuroendocrine or immune functioning
(Seeman, Charpentier, Berkman, et al., 1994; Uchino, Cacioppo,
& Kiecolt-Glaser, 1996).
Although the main effects of social variables on health have
been documented, the extent to which these effects may vary
across population subgroups is not known. Three variables that
may moderate the effects of social support/social networks on
health are income, gender, and level of physical functioning, as
described below.
Income
Social support may have stronger benefits for elderly people
with low income. People with low income may have greater ex-
posure to health threats including inadequate or unsafe housing
conditions, crime-ridden neighborhoods, and inadequate nutri-
tion (Robert & House, 1996). These people may have a greater
need for social support and they may suffer more when they
lack adequate social support. Conversely, elderly people with
adequate income are able to afford health care, assistive de-
vices, nutritious food, travel, and entertainment, and they are
able to pay others to help them with household tasks. Therefore,
elderly people with adequate income may be able to compen-
sate for a lack of social support by paying for appropriate hous-
ing, household help, or travel to visit distant relatives or friends.
This may result in an interaction between social support and in-
come; lack of social support may lead to more negative health
effects among people with low income.
Gender
The effects of social support also may differ by gender. Many
elderly women may have devoted significant portions of their
lives to caretaking and developing supportive friendships, so
they may be more accustomed to marshaling social support net-
works and asking for help. Many elderly men, in contrast, may
have devoted significant portions of their lives to career
achievement, so they may not have developed supportive social
networks or the skills to marshal social support. This gender
difference in social networks can lead to two different predic-
tions about the nature of gender differences in the effects of so-
cial support on health. First, because women may be more
skilled at marshaling social support, the effects of social sup-
port may be stronger for women, because women are better
prepared to recruit social network members to provide instru-
mental or emotional support in the appropriate ways at the ap-
propriate times. Men, in contrast, may be reluctant to ask for
support, or they may seek it less skillfully than women do. This
would lead to the prediction that social support would have
stronger effects for women, because women are able to obtain
and use it more effectively.
Conversely, social support may have stronger effects for
men. Because many men are unaccustomed to marshaling so-
cial support when they need it, those men with low levels of so-
cial support may be especially isolated, which may put them at
especially high risk for negative health outcomes. Women with
low social support, however, may be able to compensate for so-
cial isolation by forming new social contacts or strengthening
weak ones. This scenario would predict that social support
would show stronger effects for men, because there would be a
greater disparity in health between people with low and high
social support among men than among women.
It is not clear whether there are gender differences in the ef-
fects of social support on health outcomes. Some studies have
found more beneficial effects for men (Barer, 1994; House,
Robbins, & Metzner, 1982; Umberson, Wortman, & Kessler,
1992); some have found more beneficial effects for women
(Tower & Kasl, 1996); and some have found no gender differ-
ences (Berkman & Syme, 1979; Umberson, 1996). In addition,
most research on gender differences in the effects of social sup-
port has focused on mortality or psychological distress; few
studies have used functional status as an outcome variable.
Health Status
Social support/social networks also may have stronger ef-
fects for elderly people who are in poorer health. The support
and assistance provided by social network members might be
more valuable for elderly people with lower levels of physical
functioning, because these individuals require more assistance.
Elderly people with high levels of physical functioning are
more able to perform activities of daily living (ADLs), and
they do not have to cope with the severe emotional conse-
quences of chronic illness and functional limitations.
Therefore, the buffering effects of social support and social
networks may be especially powerful for those elderly people
who have impaired physical functioning and who need to cope
with the physical and psychological consequences of their lim-
itations. The combination of poor physical functioning and
low social support may have especially harmful consequences
for health.
To date, most studies of social influences on health have con-
centrated on main effects; few have investigated whether these
effects vary by gender, income, or health status. The present
study examines two functional aspects of social ties (instru-
mental support and emotional support) and two structural as-
pects of social ties (marital status and number of other social
ties) in relation to changes in self-reported physical functioning
over a 7-year period. More specifically, this study investigates
whether the strength of these relationships varies by gender, in-
come, or health status. Analyses were performed to answer two
research questions:
1. Are social support and social network characteristics associ-
ated with decline in self-reported physical functioning over a
7-year period?
2. Do the associations between social network characteristics
and physical functioning differ according to gender, income,
or baseline health status?
METHODS
Sample
The data used in this study are from the MacArthur Studies
of Successful Aging, a longitudinal study of relatively high-
functioning men and women ages 70-79 years. As described
by Berkman et al. (1993), participants were subsampled on the
basis of age and physical and cognitive functioning from three
community-based cohorts of the National Institute on Aging's
Established Populations for Epidemiologic Studies of the
Elderly (EPESE) in Durham, North Carolina, East Boston,
Massachusetts, and New Haven, Connecticut (Cornoni-Huntley
et al., 1986). Only those respondents aged 70-79 were included
SOCIAL SUPPORTFOR ELDERLYPERSONS S247
in the study to minimize the effects of age on subsequent analy-
ses of factors associated with the maintenance of health and
functioning.
Of the 4,030 men and women who met the age criterion,
1,313 were identified as high functioning on the basis of four
criteria of physical functioning (no ADL disability, no more
than one reported mild disability on eight items tapping gross
mobility and range of motion; ability to hold a semitandem bal-
ance for at least 10 seconds; and ability to stand from a seated
positionfivetimes within 20 seconds) and two criteria of cogni-
tive functioning (scores of 6 or more correct on the 9-item Short
Portable Mental Status Questionnaire [Pfeiffer, 1975] and abil-
ity to remember at least three elements on a delayed recall of a
short story).
Of the 1,313 men and women classified as high functioning,
1,189 (90.6%) agreed to participate and provided informed con-
sent. Baseline data were collected between May 1988 and
December 1989. The cohort was reinterviewed between
October 1995 and February 1997. The mean time between in-
terviews was 86 months. Of the 1,189 men and women inter-
viewed at baseline, 273 (23%) died before the follow-up inter-
view (32% of the men and 16% of the women). Of those who
survived, complete data on physical functioning at both base-
line and follow-up were available for 850 respondents. These
850 respondents, who represent 93% of those who were alive at
follow-up and 71 % of the original sample, constitute the sam-
ple used in this analysis.
Measures
Dependent variable.--The outcome measure used in this
analysis is change in physical functioning from 1988 to 1995,
as measured by the Nagi physical functioning scale (Nagi,
1976). This scale measures the respondent's perceived diffi-
culty in performing five tasks: pushing/pulling large objects,
stooping/kneeling, lifting/carrying 10 pounds, reaching/extend-
ing arms, and writing/handling small objects. The Nagi score
represents the number of tasks that the respondent rated as
"some difficulty," "a lot of difficulty," or "unable to do." Nagi
scores can range from 0 to 5, with higher scores indicating more
impairment. Because the baseline sample was restricted to indi-
viduals with Nagi scores of 0 or 1, the change in Nagi score
could range from -1 (a 1-point improvement in functioning) to
5 (a 5-point decline in functioning).
Measures ofsocial support and social networks.--Measures
of both structural and functional aspects of social networks
were included as predictors of impairment. Structural measures
included marital status (married vs not married) and number of
social ties, other than the spouse. Functional measures included
emotional support and instrumental support. These constructs
were measured separately for the respondent's spouse, children,
and friends/relatives, and the three scores were averaged to
create a single score for each type of functional support.
Emotional support was measured based on the reported fre-
quency with which the respondent's social network members
"will listen when you have a problem" and make the respon-
dent "feel loved and cared for." Instrumental support was mea-
sured based on the reported frequency with which network
members "help with daily tasks" and "provide information." As
previously reported (Seeman, Charpentier et al., 1994), these
measures exhibit adequate test-retest reliability.
Covariates.--To control for confounding, variables found to
be associated with social support and/or health status in previ-
ous studies were evaluated as potential covariates. Correlation
analyses were conducted to determine which of these variables
were associated significantly with the dependent variable, and
these variables were retained for inclusion in subsequent multi-
ple regression analyses.
Demographic variables included age, gender, ethnicity
(White vs Black), education (high school graduate vs less than
high school), and income (less than $10,000/year, over
$10,000/year, or unknown). The education variable was di-
chotomized because its distribution was skewed. For income,
the "unknown" category was included because a substantial
proportion of the respondents (9%) either refused to provide in-
come information or said they did not know their income.
Rather than excluding these respondents from the analysis, we
created dummy variables for income less than $10,000/year
and income missing.
Baseline physical andpsychological health status variables
were included as covariates because older adults in poor health
typically require and receive higher levels of social support
(Wilcox, Kasl, & Berkman, 1994) and are at higher risk of
functional decline (Seeman et al., 1995). These included a
physical performance measure derived from tests of balance,
gait, chair stands, foot taps, and manual ability (described in de-
tail by Seeman, Charpentier, et al., 1994) and number of preva-
lent chronic conditions at baseline. Depressive symptoms were
measured with the depression subscale of the Hopkins
Symptom Checklist (Derogatis, Lipman, Rickels, Uhlenhuth,
& Covi, 1974).
Health behaviors such as alcohol use, smoking, and physical
activity also were included as covariates. Smoking was ex-
pressed in pack-years. Levels of physical activity were assessed
based on self-reported frequency of current leisure- and work-
related activity. Each activity mentioned was classified as light,
moderate, or strenuous based on intensity codes (described by
Seeman et al., 1995). Summary scales were derived by multi-
plying the frequency of activity (5 categories, ranging from
never to 3+ times/week) by the intensity and summing over all
activities. To assess alcohol use, respondents were asked how
many days in the past month they had consumed beer, wine, or
liquor, and how many drinks they had at a time. These re-
sponses were used to create an estimate of the amount of ethyl
alcohol consumed in the past month (Armor, Polich, &
Stambul, 1975).
Analysis
The model-building process involved several steps. First,
correlations were computed between the dependent variable
(change in Nagi impairment) and each hypothesized covariate
(demographic and health status variables). The covariates that
were significantly correlated with change in Nagi impairment
were included along with the four social support/social network
variables in a multiple regression model predicting change in
Nagi impairment, to determine the effects of social support/so-
cial networks after controlling for the covariates. Finally, to de-
termine whether the effects of the social support/social network
S248 UNGERETAL.
variables were moderated by gender, income, or physical health
status, interaction terms were added to the model. There were
12 interaction terms, representing the 4 social support/social
network variables crossed with the 3 potential moderators.
RESULTS
Table 1 shows the baseline demographic characteristics of the
340 men and 510 women who were alive and had complete data
in 1995. The mean age of the respondents was 74.2 years (stan-
dard deviation = 2.7 years). The mean change in Nagi impairment
was 0.82 impairments (standard deviation = 1.36 impairments).
Several variables differed significantly by gender. The
women in the sample were older than the men (t = 2.37,
p < .05), were more likely to have income less than $10,000 per
year (chi square = 95.09,/? < .001), were less likely to be mar-
ried (chi square = 142.46,/? < .001), smoked less (t = 8.00,/? <
.0005), drank less alcohol (t = 7.56, p < .0005), had less physi-
cal activity (t = 4.38, p < .0005), had lower physical perfor-
mance scores (t = 10.42, /? < .0005), had higher emotional sup-
port (/= 3.11,/? < .005), had fewer social ties (t = 3.6l,p<
.0005), and showed larger changes in Nagi impairment (t =
4.42,/? < .0005). The other variables in the model did not differ
significantly by gender.
The correlations between each hypothesized predictor vari-
able and functional decline are shown in Table 2. Several of the
hypothesized covariates were correlated significantly with func-
tional decline. These included age, gender, income, baseline
chronic conditions, alcohol use, physical activity, physical per-
formance, and depressive symptoms. These variables were re-
tained for inclusion in the multiple regression described below.
In addition, the correlations between the social support/social
network variables and functional decline were assessed. Marital
status was correlated significantly with functional decline, and
the correlation between emotional support and functional de-
cline approached statistical significance (/? = .0798).
Table 3 shows the results of the multiple regression analyses
predicting change in Nagi impairment. In this model, the ef-
fects of each covariate and social support/social network vari-
able are controlled for the effects of the other variables. Only
those covariates found to be significantly correlated with
change in Nagi impairment were retained for inclusion in the
multiple regression model. Interaction terms were added to the
model, as described in the Methods section, to evaluate the po-
tential moderating influences of gender, income, and baseline
physical functioning.
Social support/social networks.--The only social support/so-
cial network variable significantly associated with functional
decline was number of social ties at baseline, which was associ-
ated with less functional decline. The main effects of the other
social support/social network variables were not associated sig-
nificantly with functional decline, after controlling for the other
variables.
Some of the social support/social network variables were in-
tercorrelated. However, these associations were only modest, so
multicollinearity is not a problem. Instrumental support was
correlated positively with emotional support (r = .34, p <
.0005), marital status (r = . 10, p < .005), and number of social
ties (r = .22, p < .0005). Emotional support also was correlated
positively with number of social ties (r =. 19, /? < .0005).
Although marital status was associated significantly with
functional decline in the correlation analyses, additional step-
wise analyses (not shown) indicated that it became nonsignifi-
cant after depressive symptoms, income, and age were added to
the model. Number of social ties was not associated signifi-
cantly with functional decline in the correlation analyses, but it
became significant after controlling for income, depressive
symptoms, age, physical activity, and emotional support.

Interactions.--Two of the 12 interaction terms, both involv-
ing the number of social ties, were significant. The interaction
between gender and number of social ties (p < .05) is shown in
Figure 1. Overall, respondents with larger numbers of social
ties at baseline reported less functional decline. As shown in
Figure 1, the association between number of social ties and
functional decline was stronger for men than for women. In
other words, although social ties were beneficial for respon-
dents of both genders, they had a stronger protective effect for
men than for women. The largest gender differences in func-
tional decline were observed at the highest levels of social ties.
The interaction between baseline physical performance and
number of social ties (p < .005) is shown in Figure 2. Although
baseline physical performance was analyzed as a continuous
variable in the regression analyses, it is shown as a dichoto-
mous variable to simplify the illustration. This interaction indi-
cates that the association between number of social ties at base-
line and subsequent functional decline was stronger for
individuals who were below the mean on baseline physical per-
formance. Social ties were protective regardless of baseline
physical performance, but they were especially protective for
respondents with low levels of baseline physical performance.
Because the analyses focused on changes in Nagi impair-
ment, they did not include the 273 respondents who died before
the 1995 follow-up interview. To confirm the effects with a less
restricted sample, we ran a similar analysis on the entire base-
line sample, using mortality as the dependent variable. The re-
sults of this analysis were consistent with the analyses of Nagi
impairment (data not shown).

DISCUSSION
These results indicate that the effects of social ties on the risk
of functional decline in elderly persons are moderated by gen-
der and baseline physical performance. Specifically, social ties
had a stronger protective effect for men and for respondents
with low levels of baseline physical performance.
Our finding that social support/social networks had a
stronger effect on functional status for men than for women is
consistent with other research findings for other health out-
comes. A number of prospective studies have reported stronger
effects for social support and/or social networks with respect to
cardiovascular and all-cause mortality for men (Berkman et al.,
1993; House et al., 1982; see also Seeman, 1996 for review). In
particular, the harmful effect of widowhood on cardiovascular
morbidity and mortality has been shown to be stronger among
men than among women (Berkman et al., 1993). Because older
men who are widowed or socially isolated are at high risk for
functional decline and mortality, this high-risk group should be
a target for health promotion interventions. Studies also are
needed to determine what causes elderly men to become so-
cially isolated, and how this social isolation and its associated
harmful health effects can be prevented.
The stronger protective effect of social ties among respon-
dents with low levels of baseline physical performance also has
important implications for interventions to promote successful
aging. Social ties appear to be most important for elderly peo-
ple with more limited physical ability. This suggests that inter-
ventions to increase social support, such as arranging group ac-
tivities for elderly people or pairing them with "buddies" in the
community, may be especially powerful for those elderly peo-
ple who already have some physical impairment or activity lim-
itations. However, because of their restricted mobility, these
older adults may pose the greatest challenge for health promo-
tion programs and services. Greater efforts are needed to imple-
ment social activities that are accessible and can be enjoyed by
people with physical impairments.
We had hypothesized that income also would moderate the
effects of social support/social networks on functional decline.
However, the moderating effects of income were not signifi-
cant. Although higher income was associated with less func-
tional decline in the correlational analysis, the main effect of in-
come became nonsignificant in the multiple regression model,
and none of the interaction terms involving income were signifi-
cant. This suggests that the associations between income and
functional status found in other studies (Berkman & Gurland,
1998) may be explained in part by differences in social support
and social networks, and that social support may be a mediator,
rather than a moderator, of the association between income and
health status among elderly persons. Elderly people with higher
incomes, for example, may be more able to remain integrated
within a social network, because they are able to afford trans-
portation and activities.
The significant interactions found in this study indicate that
the beneficial effects of social variables are not equally strong
for all elderly people. Although many previous studies have ex-
amined only the main effects of social variables, the present re-
sults indicate that the benefits of social variables may differ for
men and women, and they may differ according to an individ-
ual's level of physical functioning. If studies evaluate only the
main effects of social variables on health, they may fail to de-
tect important subgroup differences in the effects of social sup-
port and social networks. Health promotion interventions for el-
derly people should focus on those elderly people who are most
at risk of suffering harmful health effects as a result of social
isolation. The results of this study suggest that men and people
with physical impairments may be especially in need of inter-
ventions to enhance social support and social networks.
Limitations
Because this is a study of an initially high-functioning co-
hort, the generalizability of these findings may be limited.
While this study suggests that social ties are more protective for
people with lower levels of physical performance, all respon-
dents in this study did in fact have relatively high levels of phys-
ical functioning, as evidenced by their lack of impairment in
ADLs. This study does not clarify what the effects of social ties
would be for elderly people with more severe functional limita-
tions, because the initial selection criteria guaranteed that these
individuals were not represented in the baseline cohort.
Nevertheless, the significant moderating effect of physical per-
formance found in this study indicates that even modest differ-
ences in physical performance within a high-functioning sam-
ple were associated with differential effects of social ties. One
might hypothesize that the variation in effects would be even
stronger in a cohort that included more severely impaired re-
spondents.
Another possible limitation is that the data used in this study
are based on respondents' self-reports of their physical func-
tioning and social networks. Although attempts were made to
control for variables that may confound the relationship be-
tween social variables and physical functioning (e.g., depres-
sive symptoms, health behaviors, baseline health status), other
variables not included in these analyses may have biased the
accuracy of respondents' self-reports. Potential confounding
variables that have been associated with both social networks
and health outcomes include personality factors such as cynical
hostility (Everson et al., 1997) and health behaviors other than
those measured here (Lauver, Nabholz, Scott, & Tak, 1997).
Despite these limitations, these data provide important infor-
mation about the effects of social support and social networks
on physical functioning in elderly persons. More specifically,
they highlight the fact that previously observed main effects
might obscure important population variation in the effects of
social ties and social support on health outcomes. As shown in
these analyses, factors such as gender and baseline physical
performance appear to moderate social network effects. Greater
attention needs to be given to describing and understanding the
complex interaction between social networks and individual
characteristics if we are to gain the requisite understanding to
design effective interventions to promote more successful
aging.
