ABSTRACT. Objectives. To estimate the proportion
of children 1 to 5 years of age who received blood lead
testing during 1988­1994 and to assess whether predic-
tors of testing coincided with predictors of elevated
blood lead levels.
Design. Cross-sectional analysis of data from the
Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Sur-
vey.
Participants. US children 1 to 5 years of age.
Outcome Measures. Prevalence of blood lead testing
and elevated blood lead levels among children 1 to 5
years of age and odds ratios for factors predicting blood
lead testing and elevated blood lead levels.
Results. Overall, 6.3% had elevated blood lead levels
and 10.2% had undergone previous blood lead tests. Be-
ing of minority race/ethnicity, living in an older home,
residing in the Northeast or Midwest regions of the
United States, being on Medicaid, having a head of
household with <12 years of education, and having a
history of anemia were significant factors in both mod-
els. Additional independent risk factors for an elevated
blood lead level included being sampled in phase 1 of
the survey, being 1 to 2 years of age, not having a regular
doctor, and being sampled during the summer months.
Additional independent correlates of a previous blood
lead test included having moved less than twice in one's
lifetime, having a female head of household, and having
parents whose home language was English. Of an esti-
mated 564 000 children 1 to 5 years of age who had
elevated blood lead levels and no previous screening test
in 1993, 62% were receiving Medicaid, 40% lived in
homes built before 1946, and 34% were black, non-His-
panic.
Conclusions. Lead screening was more frequent
among children with risk factors for lead exposure. How-
ever, among children with elevated blood lead levels,
only one third had been tested previously. In 1993 an
estimated 564 000 children 1 to 5 years of age had ele-
vated blood lead levels but were never screened. Physi-
cians should screen Medicaid-eligible children and
should follow state or local health department recom-
mendations about identifying and screening other at-risk
children. In areas where no health department guidelines
exist, physicians should screen all children or screen
based on known risk factors. Pediatrics 2000;106(6). URL:

According to the most recently available na-
tional data, nearly 900 000 preschool-aged
children in the United States had elevated
blood lead levels between 1991 and 1994.1 For most
of these children, the lead source is in the home
environment, often from household dust contami-
nated by deteriorating leaded house paint. Interior
house paints containing lead were widely used be-
fore and during the 1940s.2 The use of lead in paint
was greatly curtailed in the 1950s, and lead was
banned as a paint additive in 1978.2 Despite this
phase-out, leaded paint is found in the majority of
residential buildings built before 1980.3 Other lead
sources in a child's environment may include dust
and soil contaminated by vehicle exhaust (lead was
used as a gasoline additive until 1996), lead intro-
duced into the home from parents' work exposures
or hobbies, lead in ceramics used to cook and store
food, and lead in some ethnic folk medicines and
cosmetics.4 Major risk factors for elevated blood lead
levels reflect these sources and include residence in
older homes, low family income, minority race, and
residence in larger urban areas.1,5,6
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC) periodically updates its recommendations for
testing children for lead exposure to reflect the cur-
rent state of knowledge regarding lead's health ef-
fects and the prevalence of lead exposure. Before
1991, CDC recommended that at-risk children be
screened and given follow-up attention if their blood
lead levels were 25 g/dL.7 In 1991, CDC recom-
mended that virtually all children 1 to 5 years of age
be screened, and the level of concern was lowered
to 10 g/dL.4 Most recently, CDC recommended
that screening efforts be targeted to high-risk neigh-
borhoods and children, because the decreasing prev-
alence of elevated blood lead levels has made
universal screening throughout the United States un-
necessary.8 The American Academy of Pediatrics has
concurred with these recommendations.9,10

Limited information is available on the extent to
which at-risk children receive lead testing in accor-
dance with CDC guidelines. This analysis was un-
dertaken to determine the frequency of lead screen-
ing between 1988 and 1994 and the extent to which
screening was performed in accordance with major
risk factors for elevated blood lead levels among a
nationally representative sample of children 1 to 5
years of age.
METHODS
Data on children's history of blood lead testing and on their
current blood lead levels were obtained from the Third National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III). The
NHANES is an ongoing series of national studies of the health and
nutritional status of the civilian noninstitutionalized population.
NHANES III was conducted in 2 phases: phase 1 ran from October
1988 through September 1991 and phase 2 ran from October 1991
through September 1994. A detailed description of the sample
design has been published elsewhere.11 Briefly, sampling was
based on a stratified multistage probability cluster design, with
oversampling of blacks, Mexican-Americans, children 2 months to
5 years of age, and people 60 years of age to increase the
reliability of estimates for these groups. A household interview
was conducted in the home for each survey participant, followed
by a separately scheduled physical examination at a mobile ex-
amination center. Only data for children 1 to 5 years of age were
included in this analysis.
During the physical examination, ethylenediaminetetraacetic
acid-anticoagulated whole blood was collected by venipuncture
from examinees 1 year of age. Specimens analyzed for lead
remained frozen at 20°C until analyzed. Blood lead levels were
measured on a Perkin-Elmer model 5000 or 5100 graphite furnace
atomic absorption spectrophotometer (Perkin-Elmer, Norwalk,
CT), using the method of Miller et al.12 The graphite furnace
atomic absorption spectrophotometer method included deuterium
or Zeeman background correction and had a limit of detection of
1.0 g/dL. The blood lead measurements were calibrated using
standards prepared from lead nitrate Standard Reference Material
928 obtained from the National Institute of Standards and Tech-
nology (Gaithersburg, MD). Blood lead levels were measured in
duplicate, and the mean of the results was used in this analysis.
Blood lead levels 10.0 g/dL were considered elevated in ac-
cordance with CDC guidelines.4
Hemoglobin was measured as part of a complete blood count
on a Coulter S-PLUS JR quantitative, automated hematology an-
alyzer (Coulter, Inc, Hialeah, FL) by a cyanmethemoglobin assay
using fresh blood.13 Hemoglobin was measured in duplicate, with
the mean value reported. The S-PLUS JR was calibrated directly
with Coulter each morning, using S-CAL calibrators and 5-C
quality control materials. In this analysis, anemia was defined as
a hemoglobin level below CDC-recommended age-specific cutoff
values.14
One adult individual from each household responded to the
household interview. The respondent was the head of household
(defined as the person owning or renting the home) or the spouse
of the head of the household for 96% of children 1 to 5 years of age.
This individual provided information about the household and
the child's health history. History of lead testing was assessed by
the question: "Was [child's name] ever tested for lead poisoning?"
The variables included time of the survey, demographic charac-
teristics, and factors related to the age and location of the family
home, health insurance, and use of medical services, anemia and
general health status, and characteristics of the child's mother and
head of household (Table 1).
For the questions regarding health insurance coverage, there
were multiple versions of the questionnaire, which differed with
respect to the time frame referenced. Approximately one half of
the respondents were asked about their Medicaid and private
insurance coverage within the previous month, and one half were
asked about their Medicaid coverage within the previous year and
about their current private insurance coverage. Because informa-
tion about Medicaid coverage within the previous year was miss-
ing for 61% of eligible children 1 to 5 years of age, it was assumed
for this analysis that those who had current private insurance but
were missing information on Medicaid did not have Medicaid
coverage. Information about Medicaid coverage within the previ-
ous month was missing for 1% of eligible children 1 to 5 years of
age.
The relationship between each of these characteristics and the
likelihood of an elevated blood lead level, as well as history of
blood lead testing, was assessed while controlling for the others
using multiple logistic regression. Model selection via backward
elimination was used to identify independent correlates signifi-
cant at   .05, based on t tests. After the initial model was
defined, potential predictor variables that had been eliminated
during the model selection procedure were individually tested for
reintroduction into the model; any variables that achieved statis-
tical significance on reentry were retained in the models.
Data from phases 1 and 2 of NHANES III are correlated to an
unquantified degree because of the method used for allocating
primary sampling units to each survey phase.15 The assessment of
survey phase as a covariate in the regression models was, there-
fore, conservative, because the correlation between phases was
ignored (J. Eltinge, personal communication, 1998).
The number of children with elevated blood lead levels who
did not have a history of blood lead screening was estimated for
phase 2 of the survey, broken down by selected characteristics
predictive of blood lead level. These numbers were benchmarked
to the March 1993 Current Population Survey population estimate
for the United States because this date represented the approxi-
mate midpoint of phase 2 sampling.
All statistical analyses were performed using SAS and
SUDAAN software with appropriate weighting and accounting
for the complex sample design of the survey.15­17
RESULTS
Among individuals selected for study in NHANES
III, the household interview response rate was 94%
for participants 1 to 2 years of age and 91% for those
3 to 5 years of age. The physical examination was
completed by 87% of selected participants 1 to 2
years of age and 85% of those 3 to 5 years of age.15
There were 5787 NHANES III participants between
the ages of 1 and 5 years (12.0­71.9 months). Of
these, 4624 (79% of the weighted sample) received a

blood lead test, and 5677 (98% of the weighted sam-
ple) had a valid response to the interview item re-
garding a previous blood lead test. Correlates of
failing to receive a blood lead test during NHANES
III were evaluated in a multivariate regression mod-
el; not receiving a blood lead test was more frequent
(P  .05) among those who were sampled during
phase 1 of the survey (28% vs 15%), those who were
1 to 2 years of age (25% vs 19%), those in households
with incomes at or above $20 000 per year (24% vs
18%), those who resided in the Northeast region of
the United States (27% vs 18%­21% for the other
regions), those who were sampled in seasons other
than the spring (21%­24% vs 17%), and those who
were not anemic (23% vs 1%).
Overall, 6.3% of children 1 to 5 years of age had
elevated blood lead levels, and 10.2% had reports of
previous blood lead testing. Of those with elevated
blood lead levels, 33% had a previous blood lead test
reported. Between phase 1 and phase 2 of the survey,
the prevalence of elevated blood lead levels dropped
nonsignificantly (P  .06) from 8.6% to 4.4%; the
percentage reporting previous testing increased non-
significantly (P  .49) from 8.9% to 11.5%; and the
percentage of those with elevated blood lead levels
who had previous testing increased nonsignificantly
(P  .44) from 30% to 37%.

vated blood lead level during NHANES III, and Ta-

lead testing based on the multivariate logistic regres-
sion models. Being of minority race/ethnicity, living
in an older home, residing in the Northeast or Mid-
west regions of the United States, being on Medicaid,
having a head of household with 12 years of edu-
cation, and having a history of anemia were signifi-
cant factors in both models. Additional independent
risk factors for an elevated blood lead level included
being sampled in phase 1 of the survey, being 1 to 2
years of age, not having a regular doctor, and being
sampled during the summer months. Additional in-
dependent correlates of a previous blood lead test
included having moved less than twice in one's life-

Table 4 shows the estimated number of children 1
to 5 years of age with elevated blood lead levels in
1993 (at the midpoint of phase 2) and the number of
these children who did not receive blood lead screen-
ing by selected risk factors. Of an estimated 890 000
children with elevated blood lead levels, 60% were
receiving Medicaid, 37% lived in homes built before
1946, and 43% were black, non-Hispanic. Among
those who were receiving Medicaid, 29% lived in
homes built before 1946 and 56% were black, non-
Hispanic (data not shown). Among those who were
not receiving Medicaid, 49% lived in homes built
before 1946 and 24% were black, non-Hispanic. Of
the estimated 564 000 children 1 to 5 years of age
who had elevated blood lead levels and no previous
screening test in 1993, 62% were receiving Medicaid,
40% lived in homes built before 1946, and 34% were
black, non-Hispanic (Table 4).
DISCUSSION
This analysis indicated that 10% of US children 1
to 5 years of age had received blood lead testing
before their participation in NHANES III in 1988­
1994. Presumably, virtually all of these tests were
screens or follow-ups of screens among asymptom-
atic children, because symptomatic lead poisoning is
rare in the United States. This result is a lower esti-
mate than that found in a 1994 national survey in
which 24% of parents interviewed reported that their
children had undergone lead screening tests.18 Two
factors may have contributed to this discrepancy.
One is that screening rates may have risen over the
1988­1994 period in response to the universal
screening recommendations issued by CDC in 1991
and by the American Academy of Pediatrics in
1993.4,9 If this is the case, then the response to the
recommendations was greater in later years, because
the NHANES III data did not show a significantly
higher screening rate in phase 2 (1991­1994) than in
phase 1 (1988­1991). Unfortunately, it was not pos-
sible to analyze the NHANES data by year of inter-
view to assess whether this was the case.
A second possibility is that the estimates were
affected by selective nonparticipation in one or both
surveys. The response rate for the 1994 telephone
survey was 56%, compared with over 90% for
NHANES III.15,18 It is possible that parents who
chose to participate in the 1994 survey were more
likely than nonparticipants to have children who
were screened for lead or more likely to remember
previous blood lead testing of their children.
Blood lead screening is generally conducted in a

4 of 7 ELEVATED BLOOD LEAD LEVELS AND SCREENING
pediatrician's office as part of a routine, well-child
visit. Because blood may be drawn at these visits for
routine laboratory analyses and anemia testing as
well as for lead testing, parents may not always be
aware that a lead test is being performed. Thus, the
estimates of testing prevalence found in this study,
as well as in the 1994 telephone survey, may have
been biased downward. However, a review of Med-
icaid claims records for 1994­1995 indicated a
screening rate similar to that reported in NHANES
III.19
The estimated prevalence of elevated blood lead
levels may also be slightly inaccurate because blood
lead data were missing for 21% of NHANES III par-
ticipants 1 to 5 years of age. The primary reason for
missing data was parental refusal of the blood
draw.15 Data were more likely to be missing for
children living in the Northeast region of the United
States and for younger children, both of whom tend
to have higher blood lead levels, and for phase 1
recipients, who were sampled when blood lead lev-
els were higher. Thus, the prevalence estimate may
have been biased downward. However, data were
also more likely to be missing for children who were
sampled in the fall and winter months, for those who
were not anemic, and for those who had an annual
household income $20 000. Blood lead levels were
lower in the winter and spring, and both anemia and
lower income were significantly associated with ele-
vated blood lead levels on the bivariate analyses.
Thus, the overall direction or degree of any bias is
unclear.
Correlates of an elevated blood lead level in this
analysis included being 1 to 2 years of age, being of
minority race/ethnicity, having a lower income, and
living in an older home, all of which are well-known
risk factors whose relationships to elevated blood
lead levels have been demonstrated in previous anal-
yses of NHANES III data.1,5,6 Living in the Northeast
was also shown to be a risk factor in a previous
NHANES III analysis.5 Season did not predict con-
tinuously modeled blood lead concentrations in chil-
dren in another NHANES III analysis but has been
shown to predict blood lead levels elsewhere.6,20
Note that because NHANES III physical examina-
tions were generally conducted in the northern
United States during the warmer months and in the
southern United States during the cooler months, the
increased risk associated with residence in the
Northeast and Midwest regions of the United States
might be overestimated if the categorical coding for
season incompletely controlled for the NHANES III
examination schedule.
Being on Medicaid, not having a regular doctor,
living in a household whose head has less than a
high school education, and having a history of ane-
mia were also independent risk factors in this anal-
ysis but were not evaluated in the previous NHANES
III studies. Anemia has previously been shown to be
correlated with elevated blood lead levels.21 Being on
Medicaid is a close correlate of poverty, another
well-known risk factor for lead exposure that prob-
ably reflects the condition of the child's home. Heads
of household with less education may be less aware
of lead hazards and, therefore, less able to protect
their children, or lower education may be a proxy
marker of lower socioeconomic status and poorer
housing. Similarly, having a regular doctor may be a
proxy for higher socioeconomic status or a more
orderly lifestyle in which children are less likely to be
exposed to lead hazards.
Of the correlates of blood lead testing, many were
also risk factors for elevated blood lead levels in this
analysis (being of minority race/ethnicity, living in
an older home, living in the Northeast or Midwest
regions of the United States, being on Medicaid,
having a head of household with less than a high
school education, and having a history of anemia).

scheme for the race/ethnicity variable.
 Sample size was not sufficient to allow separate examination of other race/ethnicity groups.

Of the remaining correlates of previous blood lead
testing in this analysis, having a female head of
household has been shown to be related to the like-
lihood of elevated blood lead levels in other stud-
ies.22 Increased residential mobility has also been
shown to be a risk factor for elevated blood lead
levels,23 but in this analysis a greater number of
moves was associated with a decreased likelihood of
being screened for lead exposure. Children with par-
ents who spoke a language other than English at
home were less likely to have received blood lead
testing, perhaps reflecting less access to health care
among these families.
In summary, these findings indicate that children
with known risk factors for elevated blood lead lev-
els were more frequently screened. However, among
children with elevated blood lead levels, only one
third had been tested previously. Clearly, many
practitioners did not heed CDC's 1991 call for uni-
versal screening. Several surveys of pediatricians
were conducted in the early 1990s to determine
screening practices. The proportion of respondents
reporting that they universally screen patients
ranged from 12% to 75%, with higher proportions
found in later years.24­27 The proportion reporting
that they never screened patients ranged from 4% to
25%, and the proportion that screened selected pa-
tients ranged from 21% to 63%. These studies indi-
cate that universal screening was more commonly
practiced by pediatricians with more recent training,
those who practiced in academic or public clinic
settings, those who had a greater proportion of mi-
nority or Medicaid patients, those who believed the
benefits of screening outweigh the costs, and those
who reported a high prevalence of elevated blood
lead levels among their patients.24­26 Among selec-
tive screeners, indicators for screening were gener-
ally in adherence with the 1991 guidelines of the
CDC and included such factors as living in or regu-
larly visiting an older home, having a history of pica,
being enrolled in Medicaid, having a parent who
uses lead for work or for a hobby, and having a
sibling with an elevated blood lead level.4,24,25
Childhood lead poisoning prevention programs
that are attempting to devise plans for reaching high-
risk children should focus on those risk factors that
can identify the greatest numbers of such children
and can be assessed easily by pediatric practitioners.
The candidate risk factors evaluated in terms of ab-
solute numbers of high-risk children identified in
this analysis were Medicaid status, race/ethnicity,
and year the home was built. (Region of the country
was not evaluated despite being a strong risk factor
because of the possible bias introduced into the esti-
mate by the survey design.) Among the factors eval-
uated, Medicaid status identified the greatest num-
ber of high-risk children by far. Although Medicaid-
eligible children represented 30% of the NHANES
III, phase 2 sample, they represented 60% of the
population with elevated blood lead levels (535 000/
890 000) and 93% of the population with blood lead
levels 20 g/dL (68 000/73 000; data not shown),
the level at which children require clinical manage-
ment.8 In addition, since 1992 the Health Care Fi-
nancing Administration has required that all chil-
dren receiving Medicaid benefits be tested for lead
exposure.28 However, among NHANES III, phase 2
(1991­1994) Medicaid-eligible participants 1 to 5
years of age, 81% did not receive blood lead screen-
ing.29 Nonacceptance of federal screening policies
and lack of oversight within state Medicaid pro-
grams have been identified as 2 reasons why many
Medicaid-eligible children do not receive screen-
ing.19
Among the 355 000 NHANES III, phase 2 children
with elevated blood lead levels who were not Med-
icaid-eligible, 49% (175 000) lived in homes built be-
fore 1946 and 24% (85 000) were black, non-Hispanic.
Thus, focusing on the age of the child's home may be
more useful than focusing on the child's race for
identifying at-risk children among those who are not
Medicaid-eligible. Year of housing construction has
been also recommended as a factor on which health
departments should base screening recommenda-
tions for neighborhoods.8 In addition, physicians can
ask parents about the child's home during individual
examinations. Not all parents know when their home
was built (8% of respondents in this analysis did not
know); the conservative approach for physicians
would be to screen all such children.
The ideal approach to childhood lead poisoning is
primary prevention by removing exposure sources,
and, in fact, the prevalence of elevated blood lead
levels among children 1 to 5 years of age has
dropped 95% since the late 1970s because of the
removal of lead from gasoline, food and drink cans,
house paint, and plumbing.1,6,30 However, remaining
lead sources, such as deteriorating house paint, must
be addressed on an individual, rather than on a
population, level. Therefore, secondary prevention
through screening to identify exposed children, fol-
lowed by environmental remediation and treatment,
remains important. Physicians should screen Medi-
caid-eligible children and should follow health de-
partment recommendations about identifying and
screening other at-risk children. In areas where no
health department guidelines exist, physicians should
either screen all children or screen based on known
risk factors.
