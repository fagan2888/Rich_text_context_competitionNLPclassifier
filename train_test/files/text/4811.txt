Introduction
The East India Company1 received an English Royal Charter
from Queen Elizabeth I on the December 31, 1600. Many
European trading companies had begun their commercial
activities in India before the British East India Company
came to India. The English East India Company ultimately
established their rule in India. Although this Company came
to India as traders, they shifted their vision from economics
to administrative control of India with the rise of Robert
Clive and his victory at the Battle of Plassey2 in 1757
(Riddick, 2006). Later, they had become rulers and adminis-
trators and policy makers in the landscape of economy, pol-
ity, and education in India. However, one should not suppose
that there had been no educational system before the coming
of the East India Company. When the British came to India
and were gradually establishing themselves in Bengal, they
met such a system (Ghosh, 1989). Education is no exotic in
India. There is no country where the love of learning had so
early an origin or has exercised so lasting and powerful an
influence (Thomas, 1891).
The modern system of education came to be established
in India during the British period at the cost of the traditional
indigenous system. Before the British developed a new
scheme of education in India, both the Hindus and the
Muslims had their own systems of education. Both the sys-
tems went into oblivion gradually and suffered a setback
because of political turmoil and lack of a strong centralized
political authority and want of suitable patronage (Purkait,
1992). The Tols and Madrassas were the highest seminaries
of learning meant for the specialists. For primary education,
there were in the villages, Patsalas and Maktabs3 where the
Gurus and Maulavis imparted knowledge of the three "R's"
to the boys of the locality. There was no school for the

Free and Compulsory Primary Education
in India Under the British Raj: A Tale of
an Unfulfilled Dream
Ajit Mondal1
Abstract
Attempts to make free and compulsory education accessible to Indian children began a little more than a century ago. A
strong consciousness for the need of free and compulsory Primary Education in India was highly moved by enactment of the
Compulsory Education Act in 1870 in England. Education has been formally recognized as a human right since the adoption
of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) in 1948. This has since then been reaffirmed in numerous global
human rights treaties. Ultimately, universalization of elementary education has been one of the most important goals of
educational development in India since independence. The Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act (RTE
Act), 2009, came into force from April 1, 2010, pursuant to the Eighty-Sixth Amendment to the Constitution of India (2002),
which guarantees elementary education as a fundamental right. This article attempts to delve into the checkered history of
development of the free and compulsory primary education in India under the British Raj. The history of compulsory and
free primary education during the British Rule in India is an uphill journey replete with suggestions, advocacies, demands,
experimentations, attempts, promises, and movements within legislative framework. The British rulers adopted a good
number of policies on education, but these were framed in tune with the needs of the colonial power. Consequently,
compulsory and free primary education remained an unfulfilled dream during the British Raj, in spite of the stirring efforts
of the Indians.

education of the girls though the Zamindars4 often had their
daughters educated at home (Ghosh, 1989). The colonial
interests of the British colored the then educational policies
in India. In his book Education in British India, Arthur
Howell (1872) aptly said,
Education in India under the British Government was first
ignored, then violently and successfully opposed, then conducted
on a system now universally admitted to be erroneous and
finally placed on its present footing. (p. 3)
Let us now see how the checkered history of the free and com-
pulsory primary education in India under the British Raj5 was.
Methodology of the Study
The study being historical in nature involves documentary
analysis. The study has been developed by exploring and
analyzing comprehensively huge qualitative data obtained
from both primary and secondary sources.
The Charter Act of 1813--The First
Parliamentary Recognition of the Right
of Education in India
Although the East India Company was established as early as
in 1600, it undertook no educational activities for nearly 100
years of its existence (Nurullah & Naik, 1951). For the first
time, the Company paid attention to educational matters by
the Charter Act of 1698, which mandated it to maintain
priests and schools in its garrisons. However, these provi-
sions were intended for the children of the Company's
European servants than for the Indians. The development of
modern system of education in India under the aegis of the
Company began actually with the CharterAct of 1813, which
directed through the Section 43 that
a sum of not less than one lakh of rupees in each year shall be set
apart and applied to the revival and improvement of literature
and the encouragement of the learned natives of India, and for
the introduction and promotion of a knowledge of the sciences
among the inhabitants of the British territories in India. (Sharp,
1920, p. 22)
Nurullah and Naik (1951) rightly stated that
. . . the education of the Indian people was definitely included
within the duties of the Company; . . . thereby laying the
foundation of the modern educational system. (p. 82)
Clause 43 of the Charter Act of 1813 assumed more impor-
tance when one remembers that in those days education
was not a state's responsibility in England, and except
Scotland, no public money was spent on elementary educa-
tion6 (Ghosh, 1989). Its Clause 43 contained the first
legislative admission of the right of education in India in
the public revenues (Misra, 1989). However, the Charter
Act made it compulsory on the part of the East India
Company to extend education in India; it laid the base of
state system of education in India.
William Adam's Third Report in 1838--
The Earliest Suggestion
The history of universal compulsory primary education
can be traced back to the year, 1938. Although no solid
efforts were made till the beginning of the 20th century, the
earliest attempt during British rule for enforcing compul-
sory primary education was undertaken by William Adam
in 1838 (Sarma, 2011), a Christian missionary who
inquired into the state of vernacular education in Bengal,
Bihar, and Orissa. In the third Report, Adam submitted his
scheme for the improvement of vernacular education.
Adam considered it impossible to introduce compulsory
education at that time for more than one reason. He stated
it in his report in the following words:
The next form in which Government influence may be conceived
to be employed for the promotion of education is by making it
compulsory and enacting that every village should have a
school. I hope the time will come when every village shall have
a school, but the period has not yet arrived when this obligation
can be enforced. (Long, 1868, p. 254)
The General Committee of Public Instruction (GCPI) found
Adam's scheme impractical and too expensive and above all
opposed to the idea of filtrating education from the upper and
middle classes to the masses and, ultimately, the government
rejected the proposal.
Captain Wingate, the Revenue Survey
Commissioner in Bombay, 1852--A
Proposal
A more direct suggestion toward the demand of compul-
sory education came from Captain Wingate, the Revenue
Survey Commissioner in Bombay. In 1852, Captain
Wingate when called upon by Government of Bombay to
give his views on a proposal to levy a local fund on land
revenue, recommended the levy of such cess and sug-
gested that a part of it should be devoted to providing
compulsory education to the sons of agriculturists. These
proposals did not find favor with other officers most of
whom opposed it tooth and nail (Aggarwal, 2002; Pathania
& Pathania, 2006). Professor J. P. Naik opined that the
main flaw in the proposal is its uncritical optimism. It was
obviously impossible to finance compulsory primary edu-
cation out of the proceeds of the Local Fund Cess only
(Naik, 1942a, p. 5).

Mr. T. C. Hope, Educational Inspector
of Gujarat Division, 1858--A
Recommendation
Shortly afterward in 1858, Mr. T. C. Hope, the educational
inspector of Gujarat proposed that a law should be passed
empowering the inhabitants of any local area to tax them-
selves for the establishment of schools (Mukerji, 1964). Mr.
T. C. Hope opposed the voluntary system of school expan-
sion and pressed for an enactment to authorize the levy of a
compulsory educational rate (Government of Bombay,
1859). The Report of the Director of Public Instruction,
Bombay, for the year 1857-1858 described the opinion of
Mr. T. C. Hope about the state of education during 1857 to
1858 in the following words:
that the "partially self-supporting" or persuading system, as a
measure for national education, has proved a total failure . . . the
best substitute appears to be a legislative enactment, to be ready
applied, from year to year, to such villages as are judged to be
ready for Government schools, and throwing the entire cost of
the maintenance of the latter on the people themselves.
(Government of Bombay, 1859, p. 433)
But this proposal was also turned down as premature. Thus,
earlier suggestions or schemes for introducing compulsory
primary education under the British Raj came from William
Adam, Captain Wingate, and T. C. Hope. But all the sugges-
tions were considered either premature or impractical.
Indian Education Commission (Hunter
Commission), 1882--The Earliest
Demand
With the enforcement of Compulsory Education Act in
England in 1870, a demand was raised in India to provide
similar facilities in its colonies (Juneja, 2003).
Consequently, a vigorous demand for laws to be made to
make 4 years of primary education compulsory was made
by Dadabhai Naoroji and Jyotiba Phule from Bombay
Presidency in their evidences before the Indian Education
Commission, 1882, which agreed to their reason for claim
and stated that
while every branch of education can justly claim the fostering
care of the state, it is desirable, in the present circumstances to
declare the elementary, education of the masses, its provision,
extension and improvement, to be that part of the educational
system to which the strenuous efforts of the State should now be
directed. (Hunter Commission, p. 586)
Dadabhai Naoroji in his evidence before the Hunter
Commission put forward the demand that 4 years of compul-
sory education should be provided to all children (UNESCO,
1984). Jotirao also pointed out in his representation to the
Education Commission,
There is little doubt that primary education among the masses in
this Presidency has been very much neglected . . . Government
collect a special cess for educational purpose, and it is to be
regretted that this fund is not spent for the purposes for which it
is collected . . . I think primary education of the masses should
be made compulsory up to a certain age, say at least 12 years.
(Government of India, 1881, p. 142; Mali, 1989, pp. 75-76)
In the big volume of its report, which runs well over 739
pages, there is no mention of compulsory education at all.
The principle of compulsion is referred to only in page num-
ber 558, where the Commission observes, "One witness
advocates compulsory primary education for the city of
Bombay" (Government of India, 1883, p. 558). It recom-
mended that the management of primary schools was to be
entrusted to the newly established local self-government
boards. Lord Ripon was satisfied with the very recommenda-
tion of the Commission. State's financial allocation for mak-
ing primary education universal was reduced and even
gradually withdrawn under this policy of local self-govern-
ment introduced in India by Lord Ripon. But newly estab-
lished local and municipal boards had little resources to take
up this burden. Ultimately, we observed that
. . . the Commission did not recommend making elementary
education compulsory, nor did they recommend making free. But
they asked the local authorities to admit ascertain portion of pupils
as free students on the ground of poverty in all schools managed
by the local boards or municipalities. (Sen, 1941, pp. 167-168)
Establishment of Indian National
Congress in 1885--Strengthening the
Movement
The report of the Indian Education Commission paved the
way for the organized agitation for the introduction of com-
pulsory education. Since 1880, a number of Indian leaders
began stressing the need of education for all. The establish-
ment of the Indian National Congress in 1885 further
strengthened the movement (Mukerji, 1964). In the Calcutta
Congress of 1906, it was declared that it is the birthright of
the people of India to get proper education. The Resolutions
adopted by the 22nd Indian National Congress, held at
Calcutta from December 26 to December 29, 1906, pointed
out that "Government should take immediate steps for (i)
making primary education free and gradually compulsory all
over the country" (Report of the Twenty-Second Indian
National Congress, 1907, p. iii). The movement thus initiated
was kept up till 1947 (Naik, 1978).
Attempts of Sir Sahaji Rao Gaikwad of
Baroda--The First Experimentation
Ultimately, credit goes to the notable Indian prince Sir Sahaji
Rao Gaikwad of Baroda. He achieved what the British
4 SAGE Open
Government found impossible. That is why Gopal Krishna
Gokhale pointed out at the time of introducing the Bill on
March 16, 1911, in the Imperial Legislative Council,
Within the borders of India itself, the Maharaja of Baroda has set
an event of enthusiasm in the cause of education . . . His highness
began his first experiment in the matter of introducing
compulsory and free education into his State eighteen years ago
in ten villages at the Amreli Taluka. After watching the
experiment for eight years, it was extended to the whole taluka
in 1901, and finally, in 1906, primary education was made
compulsory and free throughout the State for boys between the
ages of 6 and 12, and for girls between the ages of 6 and 10.
(Natesan, 1916, pp. 725-726)
For his greatest and remarkable contribution to the cause of
compulsory education, he was often regarded as the "Prince
among the Educators and an Educator among the princes."
The first organized attempt to introduce compulsory primary
education in British India was, however, made in Bombay
under Sir Ibrahim Rahimtoola and Sir Chimanlal Setalwad.
As a result of their agitation, the Government of Bombay
appointed a Committee in 1906 to examine the feasibility of
introducing compulsory education in the city of Bombay.
But unfortunately, this committee came to the conclusion
that the time was not ripe for the introduction of compulsory
education (Desai, 1953; Mukerji, 1964).
Attempts of Gopal Krishna Gokhale
(1910-1912)--The Movements Within
Legislative Framework
During the days of Swadeshi Movement,7 an extensive agita-
tion was launched for spreading education among the masses.
On the contrary, a new political awakening emerged and it
strongly had drawn the attention of the country to the needs
of mass education. Even after 150 years of British Raj, only
about 6% of the people had reached the level of literacy. This
produced a surge of criticism from all corners against the
existing system of education. Such criticisms found expres-
sion in a constructive manner in the attempts of the late
Gopal Krishna Gokhale to force the government of the coun-
try to accept the principle of compulsory and free primary
education (Basu, 1992). The first definite and vocal demand
for the introduction of compulsory primary education was
made by Shri Gopal Krishna Gokhale, the veteran Indian
nationalist leader (Mukerji, 1964). He was also an active
member of the Indian National Congress and he became a
nonofficial member representing the Bombay Presidency in
the British Imperial Legislative Council8 in 1902. He made
valiant efforts to make the government accept the necessity
of compulsory primary education. The attempt of Maharaja
Sayaji Rao Gaikwad of Baroda inspired Mr. Gokhale. On
March 18, 1910, Mr. Gokhale, in moving a resolution in the
Imperial Legislative Council, recommended that
a beginning be made in the direction of making elementary
education free and compulsory throughout the country, and that
a mixed commission of officials and non-officials be appointed
to frame definite proposals. (Dasgupta, 1993, p. 124; Natesan,
1920, p. 590)
Gokhale submitted nine practical proposals to the consider-
ation of this Council. He proposed
That following the example of the Act of 1870, we should pass
an Act conferring powers upon local bodies to make elementary
education compulsory in their areas.
that compulsion should be only for boys and not for girls.
that the period of compulsion should be between 6 years and 10
years,
In any area where 33 per cent of the male population is already
at school, there this principle of compulsion should be applied.
that wherever compulsory education is introduced, it should be
gratuitous,
that the extra cost should be divided between the Government
and the local bodies in the proportion of 2 to 1.
that there should now be a separate Secretary for Education in
the Home Department . . . a Member in separate charge of
education will be included in the Executive Council.
that education should now be a divided head instead of its being
a purely Provincial head . . . Education should therefore be a
divided charge and there should be a definite programme before
the Government, just as there is a programme for railways,
which should be carried out steadily year by year.
that a statement describing the progress of education from year
to year should be published with the annual Financial Statement.
(Natesan, 1920, pp. 601-603)
The resolution was withdrawn on an assurance from the gov-
ernment that the whole problem would receive official atten-
tion. Although the government rejected most of the proposals
of Mr. Gokhale, in the same year (1910) the Government of
India created a separate Department of Education in charge of
a Member of the Executive Council and asked it to devise
schemes for the extension of primary education (Sen, 1941).
Thegovernment,however,sooncreatedaseparateDepartment
of Education and began to publish annual reviews of educa-
tional progress, but they ignored the principal part of the reso-
lution on the ground that education was wholly the purview
of the provincial governments (Kamat, 1970). Meanwhile, his
plea for the introduction compulsory education drew wide
public attention.Almost single-handedly, he had succeeded in
making elementary education in India a live issue (Dasgupta,
1993). However, by introduction of this resolution, Gokhale
Mondal 5
succeeded in putting the case for compulsory education on
the national agenda. If Gopal Krishna Gokhale would have
been alive today, he would have been the happiest person to
see his dream of "Right to Education" for the children of the
country come true. It was he who, a 100 years ago, urged the
Imperial Legislative Assembly confer such a right on Indian
children. That goal has been realized a century later
(Adhivakta Parishad, 2013; Gahlawat, 2011; Rathod, 2015).
A year later, on March 16, 1911, the Hon'ble Mr. Gokhale
introduced in the same Council a small private bill "to make
better provision for the extension of elementary education in
India" (Mukerji, 1964, p. 70; Sharp, 1914, p. 181). In his
introductory speech, he pointed out all facts and figures
about other countries for comparison and made out a cogent
case for what he called a "cautious measure." He made a
touching appeal to the officialdom,
My Lord, if the history of elementary education throughout the
world establishes one fact more clearly than another, it is this,
that without a resort to compulsion no State can ensure a general
diffusion of education among its people. (Natesan, 1916, p. 726)
Mr. Gokhale also spoke that
none is greater than this task of promoting the universal diffusion
of education in the land, bringing by its means a ray of light, a
touch of refinement, a glow of hope into lives that sadly need
them all. (Natesan, 1916, p. 620).
The bill had been drafted more or less on lines put forward
by him in the preceding year, at the time of the debate on his
resolution (Sen, 1941). The demands made in the bill were,
however, more modest enough and humble than the resolu-
tions placed before. The Act was to be in the nature of a per-
missive legislation. Mr. Gokhale attached the greatest
importance to the bill was that relating to "the gradual intro-
duction of the principle of compulsion into the system of
elementary education in the country" (Natesan, 1920, p.
608). Professor Basu (1992) summarized what the bill
demanded stating that
a local body might, with the previous sanction of the Provincial
Government, make primary education compulsory in its area
provided that thirty-three per cent of boys and girls in that area
were already under instruction (showing thereby that there was
sufficient demand for primary education).
Even then compulsion would be only for boys between the ages
of six and ten, and girls were not to be included at all.
And the expenses were to be shared by the local bodies and
the Provincial Governments in the ratio of one to two.
(pp. 68-69)
The bill was framed on the model of Compulsory Education
Acts of England of 1870 and 1876 (Kamat, 1970). Finally,
Mr. Gokhale, on March 18, 1912, moved that the bill be
referred to a Select Committee of 15 members of the Council
for detailed examination of the clauses. This time he also
urged that where education was to be made compulsory, it
should be free (Sen, 1941). He emphatically urged that ". . .
unless there was an Act to this effect, the local bodies would
be powerless to introduce compulsory education" (Siqueira,
1952, p. 122). With all his arguments, Gokhale could not
break through the government opposition. All the govern-
ment members as well as some nonofficial members voted
against the bill and it was thrown out, 38 members voting
against and 13 voting for it (Basu, 1992). The government
was not prepared to accept even these modest proposals and,
by virtue of their statutory brute majority, the fate of the bill
was of course sealed (Kamat, 1970). The bill was rejected on
the ground that it was unnecessary, premature, unworkable,
and so on. While rejecting Gokhale's Bill, however, the
Government of India promised more grants to local bodies
for the encouragement of primary education and urged the
provincial government to pay more attention to this subject.
Most of the educated people in India began to realize the
necessity of free and compulsory education . . . the move-
ment for elementary education advanced rapidly in the coun-
try. In newly created N.W. Frontier Province, the elementary
education was made free in 1912 (Rawat, 1959).
However, Gokhale had rightly predicted the result of the
voting, which was already expressed in the debate in the fol-
lowing magnificent words:
My Lord, I know that my Bill will be thrown out before the day
closes. I make no complaint. I shall not even feel depressed . . .
We, of the present generation of India can only hope to serve our
country by our failures. The men and women who will be
privileged to serve her by their successes, will come later.
(Natesan, 1920, p. 660)
Thus, a glorious chapter in the history of the fight for com-
pulsory primary education in India under the British rule
ended. However, Gokhale failed; but he failed gloriously.
He, though defeated, fought heroically for several years.
After all, it was really a heroic failure.
The Educational Policy of 1913--The
Commitments and Promises
Although Mr. Gokhale's attempts on 3 successive years to
compel the government to pass an education bill had failed,
the possibility of extension of the primary education in India
gained a momentum when His Most Gracious Imperial
Majesty the King Emperor, George V, in replying to the
address of the Calcutta University during his visit to India,
said on January 6, 1912,
It is my wish that there may be spread over the land a network of
schools and colleges, from which will go forth loyal and manly
6 SAGE Open
and useful citizens, able to hold their own in industries and
agriculture and all the vocations in life. And it is my wish, too,
that the homes of my Indian subjects may be brightened and
their labour sweetened by the spread of knowledge with all that
follows in its train, a higher level of thought, of comfort and a
health. It is through education that my wish will be fulfilled, and
the cause of education in India will ever be very close to my
heart. (Government of India, 1913, p. 1)
His Majesty's statement, together with the attempts of Mr.
Gokhale, forced the Government to pay more attention on
primary education. The Indian Educational Policy, 1913,
made a significant statement on the compulsory and free
education in the words that
For financial and administrative reasons of decisive weight the
Government of India has refused to recognise the principle of
compulsory education; but they desire the widest possible
extension of primary education on a voluntary basis, regards
free elementary education the time has not yet arrived . . . in
provinces elementary education is already free and in the
majority of provinces liberal provision is already made for
giving free elementary instruction to those boys whose parents
cannot afford to pay fees. Local Governments have been
requested to extend the application of the principle of free
elementary education amongst the poorer and more backward
sections of the population. Further than this it is not possible at
present to go. (Government of India, 1913, pp. 9-10)
Ultimately, the British administrators had never looked upon
education in India as a sacred duty that they had to fulfill.
They looked upon the education of Indians as an object of
charity and not as a duty. Charity entails no goal, nor a mini-
mum requirement. A duty has both (Naik, 1943).
Successful Attempt of Shri Vithalbhai
Patel--Leading to the Enactment of
First Law
Soon after the demise of Gokhale in 1915, the campaign for
compulsory primary education was again started by the late
Shri Vithalbhai Patel. Mr. Patel introduced in 1917 a Bill in
the Bombay Legislative Council for permitting municipali-
ties to introduce compulsion in municipal areas of the
Province of Bombay. This Bill received the ascent of the
Governor-General on February 5, 1918, and the Bombay
Primary Education (District Municipalities) Act of 1918
came into effect. Mr. Vithalbhai Patel was thus the main
architect of getting the first Act on Compulsory Primary
Education in British India passed by the Bombay Legislative
Council. This is popularly known as the Patel Act, after its
mover. What Gokhale tried to achieve for the entire country,
Shri Vithalbhai Patel particularly achieved for Bombay. In
1917, he moved a bill in the Bombay Provincial Legislature
for introducing compulsory education in the municipal areas
(excepting Bombay City) of the state. It was broadly based
on Gokhale's bill with two exceptions: (a) the scope was
restricted to municipal areas only, as Gokhale's bill was criti-
cized on the ground that rural areas were not ripe for compul-
sion, and (b) it did not prescribe any definite financial
undertaking on the government which was left free to give or
not to give a grant-in-aid. Gokhale had, however, insisted
that government should bear two thirds of the entire expendi-
ture on compulsory education (Mukerji, 1964). However, the
Patel Act awakened nationwide interest in the need of com-
pulsory primary education.
Compulsory Education in British India,
1917 to 1937: The Bloom--Period of
Compulsion
The passing of the Government of India Act, 1919, ushered
in an era of rapid expansion of elementary education as this
Act passed education for the first time in the hands of Indian
ministers. The Montagu­Chelmsford Constitutional Reforms
introduced diarchy or double rule in provincial administra-
tion. Under the diarchical form of government in India, edu-
cation of Indian children became a "transferred" subject, but
finance remained a "reserved" subject. Under the reformed
constitution, the Indian ministers enjoyed certain powers
specially in the matter of legislation; but the purse strings
were held by the executive councillors and the governor
(Basu, 1992).
Under these circumstances, bills for introducing compul-
sory education were presented before every provincial legis-
lature and soon they were passed and placed on the statute
books of the country. The Montagu­Chelmsford reforms
marked the end of direct colonial responsibility for education
under British India. Professor Nalini Juneja (2003) recorded
that from 1918 to 1930 every province in British India gets
Compulsory Education Act on its Statute Book. Thus, the
newly elected legislatures replied to the defeat of Mr.
Gokhale. In fact, the decade 1917 to 1927 in the history of
compulsory education in British India may rightly be
regarded as the bloom--period of compulsion. Table 1 gives
detailed information regarding them.
The following statistics in Table 2 tell the tale of achieve-
ments in terms of number of areas under compulsion in the
quinquennium 1922-1927.
However, owing to the Montagu­Chelmsford Reforms,
Indian ministers were unable to effect any major changes
in education because finance, a reserved subject, was under
the control of the English councillors. Financial difficul-
ties prevented the provincial governments from taking up
ambitious schemes of educational expansion or improve-
ment. Consequently, progress of Compulsory Education
Act occurred in terms of legislatures. The progress of com-
pulsion just before the last decade from the attainment of
independence of the country may also be easily clear from
Table 3.
Mondal 7
The progress between 1931 and 1937 was not very
encouraging. This system of governance was later on ended
with the introduction of provincial autonomy in 1937 through
the Government of India Act of 1935. With the introduction
of provincial autonomy, the Indian National Congress
assumed the office in seven provinces out of 11. The educa-
tion ministers under provincial autonomy could command
far larger resources than the ministers under diarchy ever did.
Although detailed plans for comprehensive expansion of
elementary education were developed, the implementation
was restricted because of the occurrence of the Second World
War.
Wardha Scheme of Basic Education,
1937--The First National Scheme
The majority of Indian leaders were highly dissatisfied with
the progress and the nature of the system of education preva-
lent in the country. In 1937, Gandhiji published in the Harijan
a series of articles discussing his educational ideals. He
wanted his scheme of education to be self-supporting,
because he felt that true education should always stands on
its own legs (Mukerji, 1951). In October 1937, an All India
Educational Conference was called at Wardha under the
presidentship of Mahatmaji shortly after his articles on edu-
cational ideas appeared in the Harijan. The conference then
appointed a committee with Dr. Zakir Husain as its chairman
to prepare a tentative scheme and syllabus in the light of the
resolutions passed in the conference. The report of the com-
mittee was published under the title "Basic National
Education" in 1938 and it is popularly known as the Wardha
Scheme, because it is closely associated with Wardha. The
scheme fervently mentioned a plan of 7-year (7-14) course of
free and compulsory education. In 1938, this new system of
education was put into practice in the six major Congress
provinces, namely, Bombay, United Provinces (U.P.), Central
Provinces (C.P.), Madras, Bihar, and Orissa (Mukerji, 1951).
The Central Advisory Board of Education was quick to
see the great merit of the Wardha Scheme and appointed
the Wardha Education Committee of Central Advisory
Board of Education in January 1938 under the chairman-
ship of Shri B. G. Kher to examine its possibilities. The
Kher Committee accepted the principle of education
through activity and recommended that the age range of
compulsion should be 6 to 14 years. Meanwhile, in 1939,
owing to the outbreak of the World War II, and as a protest
against the government's policy of compelling India to
participate in War, Congress ministries tendered resigna-
tions. Thus, the rising tide of educational expansion was

for the time being stemmed by these circumstances (Rawat,
1959). However, the Wardha Scheme of Mahatma Gandhi
strengthened the hope for the enforcement of free compul-
sory education in the country. This was also an effort
toward the universalization of primary education in British
India.
The Sargent Plan, 1944--Toward a
Nationwide Plan
The need for providing India with a system of education in
approximation to those available in other civilized countries
drew the serious attention of leading educationists of the
country during the last decade. Sir John Sargent, the then
educational adviser with the Government of India, was asked
by the Reconstruction Committee of the Viceroy's Executive
Council to prepare a memorandum on Post-War Educational
Development in India (Mukerji, 1951). The Report on Post-
War Educational Development in India, approved by the
Central Advisory Board of Education in 1944, visualized a
national educational system. The Report begins with the
words "Upon the education of the people of this country, the
fate of this country depends" (Government of India, 1944, p.
6). These words contain a universal demand. It remarkably
provides for universal, compulsory, and free primary or
"Basic" education for all children between the ages of 6 and
14 under the following two heads:
1. Free and compulsory junior basic education of 5
years for all children in the age group 6 to 11; and
2. Compulsory senior basic education of 3 years for
four fifths of the children in the age group 11 to 14.
The Sargent Plan also concluded that
a system of universal, compulsory and free education for all
boys and girls between the ages of six and fourteen should be
introduced as speedily as possible though in view of the practical
difficulty of recruiting the requisite supply, of trained teachers it
may not be possible to complete it in less than forty years.
(Government of India, 1944, p. 14)
The Report of the Kher Committee,
1950--The First Attempt in Free India
However, soon after the attainment of independence, the
problem of evolving a national system of education was
taken up for consideration. At that time, there was a general
feeling in the country that the broad policies recommended
by the Sargent Report were sound and acceptable, but the
period covered by it was too long. A committee was, there-
fore, appointed, under the chairmanship of the late Shri B. G.
Kher, to consider the extent to which the proposals of the
Sargent Report needed modifications from this point of view
and also to suggest the manner in which funds required for
the program should be raised (Government of India, 1965).
The Report of the Committee on the Ways and Means of
Financing Educational Development in India, 1950, accepted
the program of universal, compulsory, and free basic educa-
tion as proposed in the Plan itself but reduced the time span,
stating universal compulsory education in the age group 6 to
14 was to be provided in a period of about 15 years (1949-
1950 to 1964-1965), universal compulsory education being
provided for the age group 6 to 11 in two Five-Year Plans and
that for the age group 11 to 14 in the Third Five-Year Plan.
The Committee also recommended that
the Provinces should aim at introducing universal compulsory
education for the children of 6-11 age--group within a period of
ten years but if financial conditions compel, the programme may
be extended over a large period but in no circumstances should
it be given up. (Government of India, 1965, p. 9)
This recommendation ultimately shaped the foundation of
Article 45 under the Directive Principles of the Constitution
in free India, mandating that
State shall endeavour to provide within a period of ten years
from the commencement of this Constitution for free and
compulsory education for all children until they complete the
age of 14 years.
Ever since, efforts were being made toward the movement
discourse on the right to free and compulsory education from
Directive Principle to Fundamental Right in the postconstitu-
tional era. Thus, a universal system of free and compulsory
primary education remained a mere dream of our education-
ists and nation builders till 1947 under the British Raj. Table
4 shows areas brought under the compulsory primary educa-
tion by 1946 to 1947.
This table also shows that compulsory primary education
had not been introduced only in Assam, North West Frontier,
and in Centrally Administered Areas except Delhi.
The total legislations on compulsory education during
preindependence can be divided into two distinct time peri-
ods. The first period started with Gokhale's Bill in 1911 in
the Imperial Legislative Council, which though rejected,
provided the genesis for legislation on compulsory education
in India. The period continued up to 1919-1920 before the
transfer of education to Indian ministers. With this transfer,
the second phase in the history of compulsory education in
India began. The Compulsory Education Acts that were
passed during these two phases are presented in Table 5.
It is clear that there has been no dearth of legislations to
make education free and compulsory in India before the
attainment of independence. Besides these acts, which were
passed by the British India, many princely states, such as
Baroda, Travancore, Manipur, and so forth, had taken the lead
and initiative to provide compulsory education through legis-
lative measures. Nearly every province passed a compulsory
Mondal 9
education act but these remained largely inoperative, mainly
because local bodies were not willingly to levy special taxes
to finance primary education. Under the British Raj, educa-
tion was served to the Indians in the interest of their colonial
power. However, the demands, efforts, and struggles by our
Indians for making education free and compulsory before
independence have definitely established a sound foundation
that has shown a right direction during the postindependence
period. Consequent upon the continued efforts of the leaders,
the Government of independent India kept the provision of
free and compulsory education to all children in the
Constitution of India.
Conclusion
India was under the British Raj for more than two centuries,
before the attainment of freedom in 1947. During the first
phase of the East India Company rule, Westernized system of
education for Indian subjects was not under the purview of
the Company's original policy as its main object was trade. It
took no educational ventures for nearly 100 years of its
establishment in 1600 a.d. In 1757, when the East India
Company embarked on its political career in India, there was
no education system organized and supported by the state
(Basu, 1982). It only came in 1813 when Parliament included
in the Charter a clause that made it "not obligatory but law-
ful" for the Governor-General in Council to set apart for edu-
cation a sum of not less than 1 lakh of rupees. This clause
was the first legislative admission of the right of education to
participate in the public revenues of India. Till 1823, the
Company did little for education as it was more interested in
wars, treaties, and settlement of debts than in establishing
schools. Ultimately, Lord Macaulay, in his Minutes of
February 2, 1835, instituted an education policy in support of
the British Raj by establishing the hegemonic influence of
English as medium of colonial "instruction" to "form a class
who may be interpreters between us and the millions whom
we govern--a class of persons Indian in blood and colour,
but English in tastes, in opinions, in morals and in intellect"
(Sharp, 1920, p. 116). Spreading English education was not
an act of disinterested magnanimity. It would lead to the sta-
bility and permanence of the British Raj. The real motive
behind the Macaulay system of education was to produce
personnel for employment in the newly set up Revenue and
Public Works Departments of the Provinces. The educational
policy laid down in 1835, and reaffirmed in the Wood's
Educational Despatch in 1854, was on the whole adhered to
till 1947 (Basu, 1982). The ideals and methods advocated in
Wood's Despatch led to the rapid Westernization of the edu-
cational system in India. The indigenous system gradually
gave place to the Western system of education and private
Indian effort also gradually appeared in the field. During the
period of 20 years between 1882 and 1902, in keeping with
the recommendations of the Indian Education Commission,
the responsibility for primary education was transferred to
local bodies. But due to the absence of funds from
Government, sufficient progress could not be made. The
local bodies too could not vigorously levy an education cess
for fear of displeasing their electorate, and demand for more
money for the expansion of primary education could not be

met (Dayal, 1955). The laissez-faire policy, enunciated by
the Indian Education Commission (1882), had led to the rise
of numerous privately managed schools and colleges (Basu,
1982). The reforms envisaged by Lord Curzon did not
attempt any reorganization of the primary education system
or suggest any concrete program for the solution of the
immense problem of illiteracy. Curzon justified the increase
of official control over education in the name of quality and
efficiency but actually sought to restrict education and disci-
pline the educated mind toward loyalty to the government.
The nationalist mind saw in Curzon's policies an attempt to
strengthen imperialism and sabotage development of nation-
alist feelings (Grover & Sethi, 1970).
Actually, the demand for free and compulsory primary
education in India under the British Raj started formally just
after the passing of the Compulsory Education Acts in
England in 1870, 1876, and 1880 when Dadabhai Naoroji
and Jyotiba Phule from Bombay Presidency, in their evi-
dence, placed an emphatic demand for 4 years of compulsory
primary education before the Hunter Commission, 1882.
Since then, our Indians took the baton. What Gokhale failed
to achieve for the whole of India, Shri Vithalbhai Patel
achieved, at least in theory, for Bombay. Gokhale's defeat
shaped the demand for free and compulsory primary educa-
tion into a national one. Since the end of direct colonial
responsibility for education after the passing of the
Government of India Act, 1919, the Indians got ample scope
for passing Compulsory Education Acts in most of the prov-
inces. Although the introduction of compulsion in all the
Acts was left to the discretion of the local bodies, they were
hardly ready to court unpopularity by levying any additional
cess. With the existing provincial resources of income, the
Acts could have little more than symbolic value (Dayal,
1955). Local option in the matter of compulsion was respon-
sible for inaction. In the Report, Hartog Committee aptly
opined that the responsibility for mass education rests pri-
marily with the state and the provision of educational facili-
ties for all classes of the community and for all areas should
not be left entirely to the mercy of local authorities, who may
be unwilling, either for political or other reasons, to initiate
schemes by which compulsion may be financed, or who,
owing to the backwardness of the area or the people, may be
unable to devise suitable measures for compulsion on their
own initiative (Government of India, 1929). The Montford
Reforms gave only a semblance of power to the provincial
ministers of education who could do little beyond making
paper schemes. Indian ministers had no control over impor-
tant departments like finance. The principle of compulsion
was theoretically accepted in almost all the provinces and
Compulsory Education Acts passed everywhere. But as the

local authorities, who were mainly responsible for Primary
Education, were unwilling to carry out the policy of compul-
sion for more than one reason, the Compulsory Education
Acts generally remained a dead letter (Dayal, 1955). It can
be claimed that only the concept of compulsory elementary
education came to be accepted in theory and was incorpo-
rated in the laws of the land, especially after the transfer of
education to Indian control in 1921 but financial difficulties
prevented the Indians from taking up ambitious schemes of
implementation or improvement. At last, the Sargent Plan,
1944, proposed that the universal compulsory and free edu-
cation of 8 years was not possible to achieve in a time frame
of less than 40 years due to paucity of trained teachers, finan-
cial burden, and ever-increasing number of children.
Although the Kher Committee, 1950, after the attainment of
freedom in 1947, cut down the time span of 40 (1944-1984)
to 16 years (1944-1960), universal compulsory and free edu-
cation remained an unfulfilled dream during the British Raj,
in spite of the stirring efforts of the nationalist leaders, edu-
cationists, and politicians. Colonial interests or power within
the educational policies in British India in the form of hidden
agenda was the key barrier to the fulfillment of the demand
of Indians. Right or demand for the free and compulsory edu-
cation for Indian children under the British Raj was consis-
tently denied and it has also been consistently delayed in free
India. The colonial power shaped and guided the educational
policy and the educational institutions promoted the needs of
the colonizer, ignoring the aspirations of the colonized. The
needs of the colonial powers always determined the develop-
ment of education system in British India. Despite many rec-
ommendations and suggestions for free and compulsory
primary education, colonial government always left the issue
under either local self-governments or the private enterprises
and philanthropic efforts. The passage to free and compul-
sory education in India ultimately arrives at its final destina-
tion when it became a justifiable fundamental right in the
Constitution of India in 2002 and an Act in 2009 after "hun-
dred years since Gokhale introduced his private Bill in the
ImperialAssembly, seventy one years since Mahatma Gandhi
gave the call for universal education in 1937; sixty one years
since Independence . . ." (Raina, 2010, p. 6).
