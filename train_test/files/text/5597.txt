Abstract: Among many benefits of facial attractiveness, there is evidence that more
attractive politicians are more likely to be elected. Recent research found this effect to be
most pronounced in congressional districts with high disease threat--a result attributed to
an adaptive disease avoidance mechanism, whereby the association of low attractiveness
with poor health is particularly worrisome to voters who feel vulnerable to disease. We
provided a more direct test of this explanation by examining the effects of individuals' own
health and age. Supporting a disease avoidance mechanism, less healthy participants
showed a stronger preference for more attractive contenders in U.S. Senate races than their
healthier peers, and this effect was stronger for older participants, who were generally less
healthy than younger participants. Stronger effects of health for older participants partly
reflected the absence of positive bias toward attractive candidates among the healthiest,
suggesting that healthy older adults may be unconcerned about disease threat or sufficiently
wise to ignore attractiveness.

Introduction
Evidence that facial appearance influences electoral outcomes poses a significant
threat to our democracy (Rule et al., 2010; Todorov, Mandisodza, Goren, and Hall, 2005).
Most pertinent to the present study, research has shown that the more attractive of two
political candidates in a congressional race is more likely to be elected (Verhulst, Lodge,
and Lavine, 2010; White, Kenrick, and Neuberg, 2013). This benefit of good looks, a gift
of birth earned through no merit, would not be of great concern if attractiveness were
correlated with other attributes that are desirable in a leader. Indeed, more attractive people
are judged as more competent, healthy, and trustworthy--important attributes in elected

officials (Eagly, Ashmore, Makhijani, and Longo, 1991; Langlois et al., 2000; Zebrowitz
and Franklin, 2014). However, attractiveness is only weakly, albeit significantly, related to
competence and health, and there is no evidence for a relationship to trustworthiness
(Feingold, 1992; Langlois et al., 2000; Zebrowitz, Hall, Murphy, and Rhodes, 2002;
Zebrowitz et al., 2014; Zebrowitz and Rhodes, 2004). The unreliability of attractiveness as
a cue to these positive qualities raises the questions of why perceivers use it and which
perceivers are most likely to do so. The present study addressed these questions by
examining the moderating effects of voter age and health on preferences for more attractive
congressional candidates.
The fact that people from diverse cultures as well as infants and young children--
and even individuals with congenital prosopagnosia--show similar reactions to facial
attractiveness suggests some universal mechanism that does not require face expertise
(Carbon Grüter, Grüter, Weber, and Lueschow, 2010; Dion, 2002; Hoss and Langlois,
2003; Langlois et al., 2000; Zebrowitz et al., 2012). The anomalous face overgeneralization
hypothesis provides such a mechanism (Zebrowitz and Collins, 1997; Zebrowitz and
Rhodes, 2004). This hypothesis holds that the adaptive value of recognizing individuals
with diseases or bad genes has prepared us to respond to facial qualities that can mark low
fitness. Our responses are then overgeneralized to normal individuals whose faces resemble
those who are unfit. Thus, on this account, we perceive unattractive people more negatively
and eschew them as leaders because unattractive faces show more similarity to the faces of
unfit or unhealthy individuals that are adaptive for us to recognize. Consistent with this
explanation, the facial metrics of congenitally anomalous faces are more similar to those of
normal unattractive than attractive faces (Zebrowitz, Fellous, Mignault, and Andreoletti,
2003), attractiveness is a more accurate predictor of actual health and competence for faces
below rather than above average in attractiveness (Zebrowitz et al., 2014; Zebrowitz and
Rhodes, 2004), and reactions to people who vary in attractiveness are driven more by the
perception that "ugly is bad" than by the perception that "beautiful is good" (Griffin and
Langlois, 2006).
Related to the anomalous face overgeneralization explanation for an influence of
facial attractiveness on social judgments is the hypothesis that disease avoidance
mechanisms can affect social behavior (Neuberg, Kenrick, and Schaller, 2011; Schaller and
Park, 2011). These authors argue that a behavioral immune system has evolved to detect
the presence of pathogens and to facilitate the avoidance of people who may carry them,
with stronger avoidance in those who feel more vulnerable to infection. They also propose
overgeneralization of these disease avoidance responses, noting that a too tightly calibrated
behavioral immune system could miss significant pathogen risks (Neuberg et al., 2011).
Consistent with such overgeneralization, research has linked activation of the behavioral
immune system to avoidance of people with physical disabilities (Park, Faulker, and
Schaller, 2003).
Applying the disease avoidance mechanism to the selection of political leaders,
White et al. (2013) reasoned that disease threat should increase avoidance of unhealthy-
looking leaders, because healthy leaders are important for societal functioning and,
consequently, an individual's well-being. Supporting this hypothesis, they found that
physical attractiveness predicted election outcomes for candidates from congressional
districts with high disease threat (higher infant mortality and lower life expectancy) but not
those with low disease threat. Other research has shown that adaptive implications of other
Ailing voters

environmental variations also can influence voter preferences for a more attractive
candidate. Specifically, whereas people preferred a more attractive, likeable-looking
candidate when asked for whom they would vote in a time of peace, they preferred a
candidate with a more masculine, dominant-looking appearance during a time of war
(Little, Burriss, Jones, and Roberts, 2007). These results were attributed to the fact that
dominant leaders may be perceived as better able to advance societal functioning and
individuals' well-being in wartime, whereas leaders with pro-social qualities may be
perceived as more able to do so during peacetime.
One notable limitation of the White et al. (2013) study investigating effects of
disease threat on candidate preferences is that it did not directly investigate how an
individual person's level of health affects preferences for attractiveness in politicians.
Rather, it examined the relationship between macro-level health indices and electoral
results. In contrast, we directly examined the relationship between participants' own health
and the degree to which attractiveness affected their voting intentions. We also investigated
the influence of health and candidate attractiveness on the voting intentions of both
younger adults as well as older adults, who have not been previously studied. Since older
adults generally have more health concerns, their preferences provide an additional test of
the hypothesis that health affects the influence of attractiveness on voters' choices.
Moreover, documenting effects in older adults has significant social implications, as they
are more likely to vote than the younger adults who are typically studied in psychological
experiments. For example, the turnout rate in the 2012 presidential election was 71.9% of
people aged 65 and older as compared with only 41.2% of individuals aged 18 to 24
(Taylor and Lopez, 2013). Finally, our study controlled education, a variable that may have
co-varied with the macro-level indicators of disease threat in the White et al. (2013) study
(Lleras-Muney, 2005), and that could itself contribute to variations in the preference for
attractive politicians. We predicted that political candidates' attractiveness would have
more influence on voting intentions of people who reported more health problems. We also
predicted that the voting intentions of older adults would show a stronger response to
attractiveness than those of younger adults.
Materials and Methods
Participants
Twenty younger adult participants (8 men), aged 18­24 (M = 19.9, SD = 1.3), were
recruited from a Boston area university and completed the study for course credit. Eighteen
older adult participants (5 men), aged 68­90 (M = 78.7, SD = 6.7), were recruited from the
Boston area and were paid $25 in U.S. currency for completing the study. One additional
older adult (male) was dropped because he recognized politicians from more than half of
the elections, whereas all the other participants recognized at most three politicians. The
number of participants was based on previous studies in our lab demonstrating that this
sample size provided sufficient power to detect significant participant age differences in
impressions of faces, with Cohen's d effect sizes averaging .53 across ratings of healthy,
untrustworthy, and hostile. We stopped running participants before we ran any data
analyses. The research was conducted in accordance with the ethical principles for research
involving human subjects expressed in the Declaration of Helsinki. The research protocol
was approved by the Institutional Review Board at Brandeis University. Written informed
consent was obtained from all participants.

Stimuli
We selected stimuli from the 2010 and 2012 U.S. Senate races. To minimize the
degree to which participants recognized any candidates, we removed races for
Massachusetts and New Hampshire (since southern New Hampshire is part of the Boston
media market) as well as elections containing candidates who were previously part of
national-level elections or were nationally recognizable (e.g., John McCain and Rick
Perry). In addition, we removed elections where candidates were not opposed by a major
party candidate. This yielded 54 elections, representing 41 states.
Faces were selected from internet sources, and we used official campaign portraits
where available. If unavailable, we used images as close to campaign portraits as possible.
Images were cropped to 300 x 300 pixel size (6.7 cm), and backgrounds were removed and
replaced with a standard taupe color. Pairs of candidates were shown side by side, with the
position of the two candidates counterbalanced across participants and conditions.
Dependent measures
Attractiveness ratings. Participants rated each pair of candidates on attractiveness
by first selecting which candidate was more attractive. They then indicated how much more
attractive they thought that candidate was on a 7-point scale, with 1 indicating a little more
attractive, 4 indicating somewhat more attractive, and 7 indicating much more attractive.
Vote choices. After making attractiveness ratings for all candidate pairs, participants
were again presented with pairs of candidates and asked to choose the one for whom they
would vote.
Health measure. A measure of functional limitations (Ware and Sherbourne, 1992)
was taken from a self-report survey completed after all other measures. We summed
participants' responses to a 10-part question that presented several activities and asked
"Does your health now limit you in these activities?" The tasks were: (1) vigorous
activities, such as running, lifting heavy objects; (2) moderate activities, such as moving a
table, pushing a vacuum cleaner; (3) lifting or carrying groceries; (4) climbing several
flights of stairs; (5) climbing one flight of stairs; (6) bending, kneeling or stooping; (7)
walking more than a mile; (8) walking several blocks; (9) walking one block; (10) bathing
or dressing yourself. Responses were coded as 1 (Not at all), 2 (A little), and 3 (A lot) so
that higher scores signified greater functional limitations. This measure has been validated
in previous research that demonstrated a relationship to objective indicators of disability
(Syddall, Martin, Harwood, Cooper, and Aihie Sayer, 2009), as well as a sensitivity to
various health protective factors (Lachman and Agrigoroaei, 2010).
Other measures. Older adults were screened using the Mini-Mental State
Examination (Folstein, Folstein, and McHugh, 1975), all scoring between 26 and 30 (M =
28.7, SD = 1.53). Level of education was coded for highest level attained, from 1 (no high
school diploma) to 7 (Doctorate degree). Additional measures included tests of visual
acuity, contrast sensitivity, facial recognition, a pattern comparison task to assess
processing speed, and the Wisconsin card sorting task to assess executive function (see
Table 1).
Procedure
After obtaining informed consent, participants were shown photographs of pairs of
politicians and were asked to rate them on various attributes. Participants were told that
Ailing voters

these were real politicians running for office and that if at any point in the study they
recognized anyone, they were to write down who that politician was. Since none of the
participants retained in the study recognized more than two politicians, we included all the
races in the analysis.
Participants rated the attractiveness of the candidates as well as three other traits
(trustworthy, competent, and babyfaced) that are not reported because they are not relevant
to our hypotheses. Ratings were made in one of the following two orders: trustworthy,
competent, attractive, and babyfaced or competent, trustworthy, babyfaced, and attractive.
The attractiveness rating used the following format: Participants were shown faces of two
politicians on the computer screen, labeled Politician X and Politician Y, with the
placement of each face on the right or left side of the screen counterbalanced across
participants. Participants were asked to choose which politician was more attractive, with
no time constraints, and they indicated their choice by pressing a button labeled "Candidate
X" or "Candidate Y." Next, participants were presented with a rating scale and instructions
stating that "you chose Candidate (X or Y) as more attractive. Please indicate the degree to
which you feel Candidate (X or Y) is more attractive than the other candidate." Participants
made this rating on a 7-point scale, with anchors of 1 (only a little more) and 7 (much
more). Participants rated all of the pairs of politicians using this format on one rating scale
before moving to the next. After all the trait ratings were completed, participants indicated
their voting preference. Using the same format as the attractiveness ratings, they first made
a dichotomous choice, and then rated how much more they preferred to vote for the
candidate they chose. We analyzed only the dichotomous voting choice, since this has more
ecological validity as a proxy for actual voting behavior.
Results
Overview of analysis
We used a logistic multilevel model to predict voting choices from participants' age
(scored as 1 for younger adults and 2 for older adults), self-reported health, education level,
and their ratings of candidates' attractiveness in each senate race. Logistic multilevel
models were performed within R using the "lme4" package for generalized multilevel
modeling. Participant and Senate race were both random factors in the model, with race
nested within participant. We included all interactions between variables except for
education level, which was included only as a control variable. Variables were not centered
because the model had no collinearity issues and all variables of interest had a meaningful
zero value. For each race, one candidate was arbitrarily assigned to be the "positive"
candidate and the other was assigned to be the "negative" candidate. The dependent
variable was the candidate for whom participants chose to vote, with responses coded as 0
if it was the negative candidate and 1 if it was the positive one. Since the attractiveness of
each candidate was rated relative to the opponent, we calculated the attractiveness predictor
as follows: If the participant rated the positive candidate as the more attractive one, then
ratings ranged from 1 to 7, with a 7 indicating that this candidate was much more attractive
than the opponent and 1 indicating that this candidate was only a little bit more attractive
than the opponent. If the participant rated the negative candidate as the more attractive one,
then ratings ranged from -1 to -7, with a -7 indicating that this candidate was much less
attractive than the opponent and -1 indicating that this candidate was only a little bit less
Ailing voters

attractive than the opponent. Scoring attractiveness in this manner yielded a value for each
candidate that reflected his or her attractiveness relative to the opponent.
Health and control variables
As shown in Table 1, older adults reported having significantly more functional
limitations than younger adults, as predicted. Older adults also reported significantly higher
levels of education, which is consistent with previous research comparing community-
dwelling older adult research volunteers with college undergraduates (e.g., Boshyan,
Zebrowitz, Franklin, McCormick, and Carré, 2014; Zebrowitz, Franklin, Hillman, and Boc,
2013). Age differences for the measures of vision and cognitive function are also consistent
with previous studies comparing college students with community-dwelling older adults,
demonstrating the representativeness of our sample. Specifically, older raters performed
worse than younger raters on visual acuity and contrast sensitivity as well as on a speeded
pattern comparison task, consistent with decreases in processing speed in older adulthood
(Salthouse, 1996), and on the Wisconsin card sorting task, consistent with age-related
decreases in executive function (Daniels, Toth, and Jacoby, 2006). In contrast to poorer
performance by older adults on the preceding measures, they performed better than
younger adults on a vocabulary task, consistent with their higher education level and the
maintenance of crystallized intelligence in older adulthood (Horn and Cattell, 1967). We
also found that, for older adults, more functional limitations (poorer health) were associated
with slower processing speed on the pattern comparison test, r(16) = -.69, p < .01, and with
lower scores on the Shipley vocabulary test, r(16) = -.66, p < .01, but not with any of the
other control measures, ps > .14. None of the correlations between health and cognitive
measures were significant for younger adults, ps > .18.
Vote choices
The multi-level model coefficients are reported in Table 2. The results revealed a
significant effect of attractiveness, with candidates who were judged more attractive than
their opponents more likely to receive votes. However, this effect was moderated by
interactions between attractiveness and participant age and between attractiveness and
functional limitations.
As predicted, the voting choices of less healthy participants, with more functional
limitations, showed a marginally stronger response to candidates' attractiveness. However,
contrary to prediction, the voting choices of older adults showed a significantly weaker
response to candidates' attractiveness than did the choices of younger adults. These two-
way interactions were qualified by a significant three-way interaction between
attractiveness, participant age, and functional limitations. As shown in Figure 1, the weaker
overall response to attractiveness shown by older than younger adults was largely due to
the healthier older adults who had few functional limitations. The voting choices of both
younger and older adults with many functional limitations showed a strong preference for
candidates who were more attractive than their opponents. Compared with relatively
healthy older adults, those with many functional limitations were more likely to choose
candidates who were more attractive than their opponents. The results for younger adults
showed the same pattern, but the differences between those who were relatively unhealthy
and healthy were much smaller.

Discussion
Consistent with previous research, participants preferred voting for the more
attractive of two candidates in senatorial races (Verhulst et al., 2010; White et al., 2013).
This preference for attractive candidates was significant not only for younger "voters," but
also older ones, not previously studied. It also was stronger for participants who reported
more health problems, as predicted. Contrary to the prediction that older adults would
respond more to attractiveness, older adults showed a weaker response overall. However, a
significant three-way interaction did support the predicted age difference. The tendency for
attractiveness to have more influence on candidate preferences among participants with
poorer health was stronger for older than younger adults. Thus the preference for more
attractive candidates was moderated both by participant age and health, consistent with the
suggestion that these two variables influence the engagement of a disease avoidance
mechanism that can influence preferences for more fit leaders. This operation of a disease
avoidance mechanism complements evidence that increasing mortality salience can
strengthen particular political preferences (Landau et al., 2004), with individual differences
moderating whether conservative or liberal preferences are augmented (Weise et al., 2008).
Our results provide stronger support than previous research for a disease avoidance
explanation for the preference for more attractive leaders. First, our finding that
attractiveness had a greater influence on voting preferences of individuals who are
Ailing voters
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 13(1). 2015. -25-
themselves less healthy rules out many alternative explanations for the effect demonstrated
at a macro level among people who live in areas with higher vs. lower disease threat (White
et al., 2013), and we have specifically ruled out education level as a confounding variable
(Lleras-Muney, 2005). Second, our finding that poorer health magnified responses to
attractiveness more for older than younger adults supports a disease avoidance mechanism,
inasmuch older adults had poorer health than did younger adults. Finally, the tendency for
disease avoidance processes to be activated by health-related functional limitations is
consistent with previous evidence that disease avoidance processes are activated by
physical disabilities in others (Park et al., 2003).
Although one might suggest that the effect of poor health to magnify the preference
for attractive candidates could reflect associated cognitive limitations that increase heuristic
processing rather than a disease avoidance mechanism, there are three arguments against
this interpretation. First, correlations between health and cognitive function were
significant for older, but not for younger adults, which means one would have to argue that
heuristic processing might explain the results for older adults, whereas disease avoidance
explains the results for younger adults. Second, as discussed below, the greater impact of
health on older than younger adult preferences for more attractive candidates was
attributable at least as much to the fact that older people with relatively few health
problems showed no positive bias toward more attractive political candidates as to the fact
that those with many health problems showed a stronger attractiveness bias. Finally,
variations in the use of heuristic processing cannot account for the results reported by
White et al. (2013) unless one argues that heuristic processing is greater in areas with
higher disease threat. As that seems unlikely, a disease avoidance mechanism has the
advantage of parsimony in its ability to explain the results of both studies as well as the
results for both older and younger adults in the present study. Finally, it also should be
noted that our finding that preferences for attractive leaders are modulated by individual
differences in health status is consistent with evidence that individual differences also
modulate preferences for attractiveness in other contexts, such as mate choices (Little, Burt,
Penton-Voak, and Perrett, 2001; Little, Jones, Penton-Voak, Burt, and Perrett, 2002; Little,
Penton-Voark, Burt, and Perrett, 2002).
As noted above, the greater impact of health on older than younger adult
preferences for more attractive candidates was partly due to the fact that older people with
relatively few health problems showed no positive bias toward more attractive political
candidates. This contrasts with abundant evidence for an attractiveness halo effect in all
walks of life and suggests that the healthiest older adults may be unconcerned about disease
threat or are sufficiently wise to ignore attractiveness when choosing among political
candidates. The finding that individuals with more health problems, especially older
people, are particularly vulnerable to an attractiveness halo effect in their vote choices
suggests the value of "inoculating" these individuals against unwise decisions, as
attractiveness is only weakly related to many qualities that are desirable in a politician.
