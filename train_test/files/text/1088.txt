Summary
1. Conservation managers require accurate and timely information on the occurrence,
size and viability of populations, but this is often difficult for cryptic species living at low
densities over large areas. This study aimed to provide such information for tigers in the
36 400-km2 Kerinci Seblat (KS) region, Sumatra, by identifying and assessing subpopu-
lation viability under different management strategies.
2. Tiger occurrence was mapped within a geographical information system (GIS) using
repeat detection­non-detection surveys to incorporate a function of detection probability
into a logistic regression model. The landscape variables that influenced tiger occupancy
were then used to construct a spatially explicit habitat model to identify core areas.
3. The number of tigers within each core area was estimated by calculating the area of
different forest types and their respective tiger densities as determined through camera
trapping. The viability of each subpopulation was then assessed under different
management scenarios using a population viability analysis (PVA).
4. Tiger occurrence was negatively correlated with distance to public roads. Four core
tiger areas were identified, all predominantly located within KS National Park, estimated
to support subpopulations of 21, 105, 16 and three adult tigers, respectively. PVA showed
that the three larger subpopulations could be demographically viable if well protected.
However, if poaching removed  3 tigers per year, then only the largest subpopulation
would not reach extinction within 50 years. Connectivity to this large subpopulation
would ensure survival of the smaller subpopulations, through providing a source of tigers
to offset poaching losses.
5. Synthesis and applications. Our key management recommendations for tigers in the
Kerinci Seblat region of Sumatra stress the importance of maintaining connectivity
between the smaller areas and the larger area, and minimizing poaching within these
smaller areas. More widely, our research has shown the feasibility of using detection­
non-detection surveys combined with spatial modelling to provide timely information
for conservation management.

Introduction
Conservation managers often need to determine the
occurrence, number and population viability of cryptic
species living at low densities and over large areas.
However, this can present a dilemma. On the one hand,
conservation managers may begin to implement strat-
egies based, at best, on crude population estimates or
guesses, which in turn may lead to the wrong manage-
ment approach (Blake & Hedges 2004). On the other
hand, by stressing the need for accurate information
requiring investment of substantial time and money,

conservation managers may procrastinate before taking
any management action. Therefore, conservation
managers require rapid yet rigorous population census
methods, and the means to model the results in a mean-
ingful and pragmatic way that leads to improved and
timely species management strategies. Such requirements
are pertinent for many top terrestrial carnivores.
To overcome these management problems, previous
studies on large carnivores have used presence­absence
data within logistic regression modelling to investigate
factors that determine species occurrence, and a geo-
graphicalinformationsystem(GIS)toconstructspatially
explicithabitatmodels(SEHM)(Palma,Beja&Rodrigues
1999; Schadt et al. 2002). Using emerging techniques,
biases associated with a failure to differentiate `absent'
and `undetected'can be avoided by explicitly incorporat-
ing detection probability estimates through repeated
detection­non-detection surveys (MacKenzie et al. 2002;
Tyre et al. 2003).
The detection­non-detection method assumes that
all cells are either occupied or unoccupied. Ideally, three
cases would be distinguished, true absences (where no
sign is detected because the cell is not within an animal's
home range), false absences (where no sign is detected
even though a sign exists within the cell) and pseudo-
absences (where no sign exists within the cell but, none
theless,thecelloccurswithinanindividual'shomerange).
The latter situation is likely to arise when cells are small
compared with a large carnivore's home range, as a cell
may be occupied (i.e. within an individual's home range)
butmaycontainnosignif thatindividualhasnotpassed
through recently. Of these three cases, false absences can
be differentiated from true or pseudo-absences by survey-
ingeach cell more than once, ideally within a short time
period (i.e. a few days) (MacKenzie & Royle 2005). If
the interval between surveys is short, the probability with
which a sign is detected when present can be estimated
from the frequency with which a sign is recorded in a
given cell in some surveys but not in others. True absences
and pseudo-absences cannot be differentiated and so
`occupancy' measured in these studies may be more
usefully thought of as `usage' (MacKenzie 2005). By
surveying large areas in this way, relative use of different
habitat types can still be estimated because cells in better
quality habitat would still be expected to be visited more
often and have a greater likelihood of containing a sign
than cells located in poorer quality habitat.
Construction of a SEHM using the detection­non-
detection approach can identify habitat suitability and
the proportion of a species' range actually occupied,
rather than assigning arbitrary cut-off values for habitat
suitability (Lennon 1999). Furthermore, SEHM can be
used to estimate carnivore population sizes, and these
may be combined with population viability analyses
(PVA) to determine extinction risks under different man-
agement strategies and scenarios (Coulson et al. 2001;
Carroll et al. 2003).
The tiger Panthera tigris is a cryptic top predator that
lives in diverse environments. Three out of eight tiger
subspecies have already been driven to extinction by
widespread habitat clearance, human over-hunting of
prey and use of tiger parts in traditional Chinese
medicine and other trade (Nowell & Jackson 1996). To
prevent further losses of tigers across Asia, conserva-
tionists have focused funds and effort on tiger conser-
vation units (TCU) (Wikramanayake et al. 1998). Yet,
there is little or no detailed monitoring information on
tiger populations in many of the most important level 1
TCU, making it difficult to evaluate tiger conservation
strategies systematically. While camera trapping has pro-
videdreliableanddetailedinformationontigerdensities
(Karanth & Nichols 1998; Kawanishi & Sunquist 2004),
it is expensive, requires skilled personnel and can only
coverasmallarea(< 400 km2)overarelativelylongtime
period (4­6 months). Through camera trapping alone,
it would take many years to obtain sufficient monitor-
ing data for tiger populations over large (> 10 000-km2)
TCU. Therefore, it is critical to develop a rapid, accurate
and comparable survey method that all field staff can
usetodeterminetheoccurrenceof tigersacrosskeyTCU.
In this study, we combined a rapid census method
with a spatial and population modelling approach to
identify tiger subpopulations and assess their viability
in the Kerinci Seblat (KS) region, Sumatra, a level 1 TCU
for which limited information on tiger populations had
been previously available. Specifically, we aimed to
(i) use field data on tiger distributions analysed with
logistic regression modelling to map probabilities of tiger
occurrence throughout the KS region, and (ii) para-
meterize a PVA, to assess the consequences of different
management strategies for the viability of these tiger
subpopulations.
Methods
STUDY AREA
Located in west-central Sumatra, Indonesia (-3°57 to
-0°53, 100°38 to 102°95), the KS region covers an
area of some 36 400 km2 (Fig. 1). It lies within a warm
per-humid bioclimate (Whitmore 1984) that supports
four broad forest types: lowland hill (0­300 m a.s.l.), hill
(300­800 m a.s.l)., submontane (800­1400 m a.s.l.) and
montane (1400 + m a.s.l.) (adapted from Laumonier
1994). The 13 300-km2 KS National Park (KSNP) con-
tains large blocks of forest that extend outside to form
a level 1 TCU. Nevertheless, agricultural expansion has
fragmentedKSNPintotwopartsandpoachingof tiger
prey has degraded habitat quality in sections of KSNP
(Linkie et al. 2003).
FIELD DATA COLLECTION
The KS region was divided into a 2 × 2-km grid of 5262
cells. A stratified sampling approach was used to select
200cellsrepresentingthemainhabitattypesandvarious
distances from the forest­non-forest edge. Detection of
tigers (defined as presence of tracks and/or faeces) was

determined from transects walked by three independent
teams consisting of field researchers and KSNP staff
during the rainy seasons of 2001 and 2002. Each cell
that was resurveyed was re-entered within 1 week of the
first survey in that cell. Forty cells were resurveyed on a
third occasion, but the remaining 160 cells were not
resurveyed for a third time because of field personnel
constraints.
Within each selected cell, transects averaging 2·47 km
in length were surveyed. To maximize the probability of
encountering tiger signs, transects followed pre-existing
animal trails or topographic features such as mountain
ridges, which tigers often use as travel corridors (O'Brien,
Wibisono & Kinnaird 2003). The location of each
transect was recorded in universal transverse mercator
(UTM) coordinates using a Garmin 12XL global posi-
tioning system (GPS) (Garmin Corp., Ulathe, KA) and
compassbearingswith1 : 50 000topographicpapermaps.
GIS DATABASE AND PREPARATION
Although prey abundance is likely to be a primary
determinant of tiger abundance (Karanth et al. 2004),
data on prey densities were unavailable for the KS region.
Wethereforeassessedsevenotherparametersaspotential
predictors of tiger occurrence: mean proximity to public
roads, logging roads, settlements and rivers, as well as
altitude, slope and protected status.
The 2 × 2-km sampling grid was superimposed onto
a forest cover map developed for the KS region by on-
screen digitizing five corresponding Landsat 7 ETM+
satellite image scenes from 2001. For each grid cell,
altitude, slope, rivers, public roads, settlements and
boundariesof KSNPwereobtainedfrom1 : 50 000maps
produced by the Indonesian National Coordination
Agency for Surveys and Mapping (Bogdor, Indonesia).
Grid cells of which more than 50% was occupied by
KSNP were classified as protected. The position of
logging roads was identified from GPS location data
collected from field surveys and on-screen digitizing of
satellite images from 2000 to 2002, verified from field
surveys using GPS units. These data were imported into
an ArcView v3·2 GIS software package (ESRI Inc.,
Redlands,CA)andconvertedintoa100-m2 rasterformat.
The continuous data were extracted for each cell,
logarithmically transformed and imported into PRESENCE
software (Proteus Wildlife Research Consultants, New
Zealand). Tiger detection (1) and non-detection (0) data
werethenenteredtoprovideinformationonthedetection
history of each sampling cell for each sampling occasion.
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS AND MODEL DESIGN
Mapping probability of tiger occurrence
Three sequential steps were used to obtain unbiased
estimates of the proportion of area occupied (PAO) by
tigersintheKSregion.First,fromtheobserveddata(440
cells surveyed) PRESENCE predicted a tiger detection
probability, as tigers will not always be detected within
a cell that they have been using during the survey period.
Secondly, this detection probability ( p) was incor-
porated into a logistic regression analysis to determine
which of the seven landscape factors, individually or in
combination, best explained the probability of tiger
presence (). Thus, in PRESENCE, different models
toexplaindetectionprobabilitieswerecompared.Models
included detection probability as a constant, p(·), or as
affected by different combinations of site-specific covari-
ates, such as altitude, p(Elevation) (MacKenzie et al.
2002). Candidate models were ranked by their Akaike
informationcriterion(AIC)values(Burnham&Anderson
1998). Thirdly, the best candidate model was used to
determine the PAO by tigers for the KS region. The
presenceof spatialauto-correlationinthefinalmodelwas
then tested by calculating Moran's I statistic (Cliff &
Ord 1981) using the Crime-Stat v1·1 software (N Levine
& Associates, Annadale, VA).
From the final logistic regression model the prob-
ability of tiger presence (P) was constructed by:
P = eY/(1 + eY) eqn 1

The SEHM predictions of the probability of tiger

(see below). To minimize problems with spatial auto-
correlation, 50 camera traps, greater than 2 km apart,
wererandomlyselectedandtheirrespectivetigerencounter
ratecalculated(tigerphotographs/100 days)andSEHM
score extracted from the corresponding cell. Spearman's
rank correlation (rs
) was used to test whether observed
tiger encounter rates were correlated with expected
SEHM scores.
Next, the tiger SEHM was reclassified to include only
those cells with the highest habitat suitability values,
which corresponded to the PAO by tigers (previously
estimated in PRESENCE). This showed the locations
of discrete tiger subpopulations, which we defined as
core habitat areas and treated independently thereafter.
We excluded areas of less than 200 km2 and areas that
were not connected to KSNP (and therefore not under
park management jurisdiction). Tiger density varies
with prey biomass (Karanth et al. 2004). We did not have
estimates of prey biomass but this factor was assumed
to vary with habitat type. Consequently, the amount of
lowland hill, hill, submontane and montane forest in
each core area was calculated to allow an estimation of
tiger carrying capacity in each core, as described in the
next section.
Estimating tiger subpopulation sizes
For each core area, cameras were placed within a
grid formation at 1­4-km spacing for 4­5 months. To
increase the chances of photographing every tiger that
entered the study site, placements covered all main
ridge and animal trails, leaving no apparent gaps in the
trapping area. Camera placements recording few or no
tiger photographs were moved to another location
within the same cell. Respectively, in the lowland hill,
hill, submontane and montane sites, 29, 28, 33 and 16
camera stations operated for a total of 762, 1848, 950 and
958 trap nights. All study sites had evidence of human
disturbance, i.e. human signs (footprints and litter) and
snare traps set for tiger prey. These sites were considered
to be representative of other forest patches in KSNP.
Two methods were then used to estimate tiger density
in the four different habitat types.
First,tigerdensityinlowlandhill,hillandsubmontane
forest was estimated using a capture­recapture method
(Karanth & Nichols 1998). Closure tests were performed
using CAPTURE software to verify that each tiger popu-
lation was closed (i.e. no births, deaths, immigrations or
emigrations)duringthedurationof therespectivecamera
trap surveys. In CAPTURE, tiger capture probability ()
and abundance (N) were estimated using model Mh
because it is more robust and, by incorporating hetero-
geneous capture probabilities, produces more realistic
estimates than the six other models (Rexstad & Burnham
1991; Karanth & Nichols 1998). Tiger density was then
calculated by dividing the N by the effective sampling
area, calculated within the GIS as the camera trapping
area plus a boundary strip width around the outermost
cameras (Wilson & Anderson 1985).
Second, because of the lower number of individual
tigers photographed (Mt+1
) in montane forest, it was not
appropriate to apply the capture­recapture method
because surveying in habitats where tiger population
densities are very low would have required an unrealisti-
callylargeamountof timeandfunds.Instead,anempirical
relationshipbetweencameratrap-derivedencounterrates
(x) and tiger density (y), based on 19 studies throughout
the tiger's range, was used (Carbone et al. 2001):
y = 133·89x-0·971 eqn 3
This method, whilst not as statistically robust as
the capture­recapture method (Jennelle, Runger &
MacKenzie 2002; but see Carbone et al. 2002; O'Brien,
Wibisono & Kinnaird 2003), enabled an assessment of
tigers in the montane forest study area. For this empirical
relationship, it was necessary to estimate 95% predic-
tion intervals (PI), using a standard quadratic formula
(Snedecor & Cochran 1989; as in Jennelle, Runger &
MacKenzie 2002) instead of 95% confidence intervals
(CI) because the density value was derived from an
equation of which it was not originally a part.
Finally, this encounter rate method was also used to
estimate tiger densities in the lowland hill, hill and
submontane sites for comparison with their previously
estimated CAPTURE-derived densities.
Using the tiger density estimates from each habitat
type and the amount of habitat type in each core area,
the number of individual adult tigers that could be sup-
ported in each core area was estimated.
Population viability model design
The viability of different sized tiger subpopulations to
demographic stochasticity and varying poaching
pressures was calculated by developing a tiger-specific
stage-structured model with a 1-year step using unified
life models software (Legendre & Clobert 1995). This
model considered a population as viable if its extinc-
tion probability was lower than 5% within 50 years of
simulation (Tufto et al. 1999; Chapron et al. 2003).
Population viability model parameters
Our model was based on the same life-history attributes
and stages as Karanth & Stith (1999), which included
male and female cubs, juveniles, transients and territorial
breeders (Table 1). Young male and female tiger cubs
dispersed and became transients at age 2, when they
started searching for a vacant territory to occupy for
breeding. Thus, only adult individuals that had already
settled in a territory could reproduce. Transients initially
tried to settle within territories in their natal core sub-
populationareabut,if therewerenoterritoriesavailable,
then they would disperse and search in connected core
areas. Transients died if they failed to settle in their natal
core area or subsequently in adjacent, connected areas
that were fully occupied. Hence density-independent

population growth was assumed up to the maximum
number of tigers in a subpopulation. We assumed den-
sity independence below the ceiling because there were
no data available to parameterize a density-dependence
function (Wielgus 2002).
Karanth & Stith (1999) modelled male density as a
function of female density. In contrast, in our model
male density was an emergent property of the number
of occupied and vacant territories and incoming tran-
sients. That male numbers could fluctuate because of
intraspecific competition was not considered because
the number of females in a population is usually the
limiting resource (Kenney et al. 1995).
The demographic parameters used for the model
comprisedanageof firstreproductionof 3 years,equal
sex ratio at birth, mean litter size of three cubs and
interbirth interval of 2·5 years. By dividing mean litter
size (3) by mean interbirth interval (2·5), we calculated
the annual mean litter size (1·2). Demographic stochas-
ticity was applied to both survival and fecundity. Class
survival followed a binomial distribution, where class
survival was parameterized and a random number was
drawn from a Bernoulli trial resulting in a tiger surviv-
ing if the result was `1'and dying if the number was `0'.
Fecundity followed a Poisson distribution with mean
litter size as a parameter. Our model did not consider
environmental stochasticity because there were no
available data to parameterize this.
The model considered the spatial arrangement of
subpopulationsbutdidnotmimicaspatialarrangement
of territories within subpopulations. Each subpopula-
tion was characterized by a maximum number of ter-
ritorial breeders and a maximum number of tigers. The
female : male ratio was 3 : 1 among breeder territories
(Sunquist 1981). We assumed that only the proportion
of the best habitats indicated by the estimate of PAO
were occupied. Combining that proportion with the
probabilityof tigerpresencegaveestimatesof currentcore
population sizes. Clearly, however, ceiling subpopula-
tion sizes would only be reached if all available habitat
was occupied. Consequently, to derive theoretical ceiling
subpopulation sizes for the PVA, we used PAO = 1·0 and
estimated potential subpopulation sizes accordingly.
Tiger poaching was modelled randomly and specified
thatalllifestagesexceptcubscouldbepoached(Table 1).
Survival of these stages was determined by multiplying
them by the probability of not being poached (1 - po),
where po is the number of poached tigers divided by the
number of individuals in the targeted classes. Poaching
was modelled as being completely additive to initial
mortality, resulting in more conservative estimates of
viability. When a tigress with cubs aged 0­1 years died
(either naturally or through poaching), her whole litter
died.
ASSESSING MANAGEMENT ALTERNATIVES
Thetigersubpopulationsidentifiedineachcoreareawere
used to model three scenarios to generate predictions
of extinction probabilities when subpopulations were
(i) isolated with varying poaching pressures, (ii) con-
nected with varying poaching pressures and (iii) con-
nected with varying poaching pressures, with adjacent
subpopulations completely protected from poaching.
For each scenario, Monte Carlo simulations were run
with 1000 repetitions for a duration of 50 years. A sub-
populationqualifiedasextinctonceallclasseswereempty.
Scenario 1: isolation
The viability of each subpopulation was determined
under poaching pressures ranging from no to five tigers
removed per year. There was no dispersal among
subpopulations.
Scenario 2: connectivity
Theviabilityof eachsubpopulationwasdeterminedunder
poachingpressuresrangingfromnotofivetigersremoved
per year but subpopulations were assumed to be con-
nected (by dispersal) to the nearest neighbouring sub-
population. Interconnection was modelled by corridor
permeability, which allowed either 25% or 50% of tran-
sients from one subpopulation to search and settle within
territoriesinanadjacentandconnectedsubpopulation, if
no vacant territories were available in their own area.
Scenario 3: connectivity with anti-poaching measures
The PVA models were repeated as for scenario 2, but
anti-poaching measures were incorporated into the
models. Using different combinations of connectivity
withthedifferentlevelsof poaching,eachof theconnect-
ing core areas was designated as having no poaching,
i.e. being the focus of successful anti-poaching measures.
Results

From the three occasions (n = 440 cells), tigers were
detected in 16·5% of sampling cells on the first occasion,

in 21% of sampling cells on the second occasion and in
20% of sampling cells on the third occasion. Only two
models explaining tiger detection received strong sup-
port (models 1 and 2; Table 2) and together these had
an Akaike weight of 1·0. Both of these models included
distance to roads as an important parameter. Model 1
had the highest Akaike weight and suggested that tiger
occupancy rates were higher further from public roads,
while detection rates were also influenced by proximity
to roads. Model 1 had a tiger detection probability of
0·51 (± 0·02 SE), the most precise PAO estimate, indi-
cated by having the smallest SE, and was not affected
by spatial autocorrelation (Moran's I = 0·04, P > 0·1).

this forest in relation to public roads reduced it to poor-
quality tiger habitat.
The SEHM predictions of the probability of tiger
presence were positively correlated with tiger encounter
rates that were derived from independent camera trap
data (n = 50, rs
= 0·398, P = 0·004).
ESTIMATING TIGER SUBPOPULATION SIZES
The final logistic regression model gave an overall esti-
mate for the PAO by tigers of 0·442 (± 0·053 SE), which
represented44·2%or9344 km2 of the21 141 km2 of forest
remainingintheKSregion.UsingtheSEHM,9344 km2
of the most suitable forest habitat was selected from the
KS region. This identified seven core areas. However, by
then excluding those patches < 200 km2 or not connected
to KSNP, only four isolated patches, or core areas,
remained (Fig. 3).
Thedistributionof differentforesttypesshowedthat

forest tiger habitat. In contrast, cores 1 (1574·6 km2), 3
(1198·3 km2) and 4 (206·7 km2) were predominantly
submontane and montane forest habitat.
From camera trapping in the lowland hill, hill and
submontane study sites, respectively, closure tests did
not reject the null hypothesis that the population was
closedduringtheperiodof cameratrapping(z = -1·107,
-1·048 and 1·113, P = 0·134, 0·147 and 0·867). Respec-
tively, six individual tigers were identified from 15 tiger
photographs, five individuals from 50 tiger photographs
and five individuals from 12 tiger photographs, with
estimated capture probabilities of 0·1633, 0·3611 and
0·2143 and tiger abundances of 7 ± 2·65 (SE), 6 ± 1·28
and 6 ± 1·87 (Table 3). Model Mh
in CAPTURE was ranked
second to the null model Mo
in all sites. However, model
Mh
was selected in preference because it was a more
realistic model that assumed each individual tiger had
a unique capture probability (Karanth & Nichols 1998;
Kawanishi & Sunquist 2004). These tiger densities were
similar to those derived using the encounter rate indices
method (Table 3).
The different combinations of size and habitat types
for each core area resulted in a total population of 145

prised 21 (core 1), 105 (core 2), 16 (core 3) and three
adult tigers (core 4) (Table 4).
ASSESSING MANAGEMENT ALTERNATIVES
For the PVA modelling, the ceiling adult tiger subpopu-
lations, which assumed that all tiger habitat was occupied
(PAO = 1·0), were set at 42 (core 1), 164 (core 2), 38 (core
3) and 15 adult tigers (core 4). The PVA modelling of
various scenarios of poaching rate, from no to five tigers
per year, and connectivity between core subpopulations
at 0%, 25% and 50%, produced different predicted prob-
abilities of extinction during simulations over 50 years
(Fig. 4a­d).Forexample,undertheworstscenario,where
the smallest subpopulations in cores 1, 3 and 4 were
subjected to five tigers poached per year and 0% con-
nectivity, the predicted probabilities of these subpopu-
lationsgoingextinctwereallP> 0·98(Fig. 4a).Incontrast,
under the best scenario, where the largest subpopula-
tion of core 2 had poaching eliminated (i.e. #2) and was
connected at 50% to core 1 or 4 (i.e. `1#2; at 50%'and
`4#2; at 50%', respectively), the predicted probability
of extinction in cores 1 and 4 was greatly reduced
(P < 0·01 for both; Fig. 4d).
The most substantial change in subpopulation viab-
ility was predicted to occur on cores 1 and 3. If subjected
to poaching levels of  3 tigers year-1, neither subpopu-
lation was viable. However, if poaching was eliminated
from core 3 then the tiger subpopulation in core 1, con-
nected at 25% to core 3 (i.e. `1#3; at 25%') and with
two tigers poached per year, was less likely to reach
extinction(P = 0·17;Fig. 4d)thanwithoutanti-poaching
measures on core 3 (P = 0·57; Fig. 4b). Equally, if core 3
wasconnectedat25%tocore1,fromwhichpoachingwas
eliminated (i.e. `3#1; at 25%'), the subpopulation in
core 3 was less likely to reach extinction if two tigers
were poached per year (P = 0·30; Fig. 4d) than without
anti-poaching measures on core 1 (P = 0·84; Fig. 4c).

population estimates, and for evaluating appropriate
and practical options for future management of a cryptic
and critically endangered large carnivore. The SEHM
identified the negative effect of public roads on tiger
distribution and habitat quality in the KS region, which
results in the isolation of four core tiger areas. Linking
the SEHM with the PVA allows the prioritization of
conservation management interventions, which showed
the effectiveness of focusing anti-poaching strategies on
the smaller core areas. It also showed that maintaining
connectivity between the largest core area, and either one
of the two smaller adjacent core areas, greatly improved
the long-term persistence of tigers in KSNP.
SEHM VALIDATION
The value of our conclusions should be set in the
context of possible limitations of the likelihood-based
modelling framework we used. As field survey effort is
usually constrained by the resources of time, money
and personnel, there is a trade-off between surveying a
greater number of sampling units with fewer repeat
surveys (occasions) or fewer sampling units with more
repeat surveys. For cryptic species that occur at low
densities, it is probably more effective to survey fewer
sampling units ( 80 cells) more intensively ( 3 times)
to overcome problems of a low number of detections
(MacKenzie & Royle 2005). With hindsight, all 200
cells in this study should have been surveyed at least
three times (rather than 40 cells on the third occasion).
However, we have confidence in our final model because
as the detection­non-detection method tends to over-
estimate occupancy and underestimate detection prob-
ability for data with few detections, models generated
with small PAO estimates, as for KSNP, are usually
more reliable than models generated with large PAO
estimates (MacKenzie et al. 2002).
The SEHM is analogous to resource selection func-
tion (RSF) models, as both yield values within resource
units that are proportional to the probability of use.
However, RSF models are usually estimated from
presence­absence or presence (used)/available data. Our
SEHM approach has overcome the three main problems
associated with RSF models by: (i) accounting for false
absencesbyincorporatingadetectionprobabilitythrough
repeat surveys; (ii) statistically testing for spatial auto-
correlation (Lennon 1999); and (iii) not arbitrarily defin-
ing suitable habitat as RSF > 0·5 (Boyce & MacDonald
1999) but instead linking this to occupancy through the
PAO estimate.
From the KS region, absolute tiger abundance was
determined from densities derived from different forest
types. However, the SEHM identified that forest pro-
ximity to roads influenced relative tiger abundance. A
retrospective approach might therefore develop a SEHM
and use the significant landscape factors to determine
camera trapping sites. We partially controlled for the
effect of roads on tiger density because camera traps
extended from the forest edge nearest to roads, towards
theforestinteriorfurthestfromroads.However,thiswas
notpossibleformontaneforestasnoneexistedattheforest
edge. Overall, tiger density still showed a relationship

with forest type. Furthermore, tiger densities might have
been estimated in each habitat type in each core area.
However, this would have taken more than 5 years, mak-
ing the assessment process less useful.
PVA MODEL VALIDATION
Difficulties associated with PVA modelling frequently
arise because the requisite data are lacking. In order to
minimize such difficulties, we evaluated relative, rather
than absolute, extinction risk, with projections over a
short time period, and with stochasticity modelled by
true probability sampling, rather than by truncating
numbers (Burgman & Possingham 2000). Recognizing
concerns over the application of PVA, our PVA predic-
tionscomprisedonlypartof adecision-supporttool,as
opposed to a decision-making tool, which has greater
advocacy (Starfield 1997).
In KSNP, the smaller subpopulations in cores 1 and
3, whilst more prone to extinction through stochastic
processes (Kenney et al. 1995), were shown to be viable
as long as poaching was minimized. Similarly, Karanth
& Stith (1999) found that isolated tiger populations
containing only six breeding females could be demo-
graphically viable. This contrasts with the findings of
Reedet al.(2003),thataminimumpopulationof between
280 and 2275 tigers may actually be necessary to ensure
long-term demographic and genetic viability (Reed et al.
2003). While importantly focusing attention on the
vulnerability of wild tiger populations, Reed et al.'s
(2003) estimates were derived from a non-tiger-specific
PVA model, which did not model tiger demographic
patterns at the fine scale used in our study. Furthermore,
Reed et al. (2003) modelled genetic stochasticity, for
which data on the number of lethal equivalents are scarce
in most carnivore populations. Therefore, we found it
more useful to concentrate on measurable demographic
parameters (Beissinger & Westphal 1998; Wiegand et al.
1998). Our PVA highlighted the fragility of tigers in
core 4, especially if subjected to regular poaching. How-
ever, tigers still persist in core 4, which suggests that the
physical barrier presented by the non-asphalt road that
divides cores 4 and 2 does not prevent their movement.
If future camera trapping on either side of the road
confirms connectivity between cores 4 and 2, then future
modelling could consider their viability as a single
combined core. Finally, our PVA might be advanced by
collectingandincorporatingbreedingsitedatafor model-
ling source­sink metapopulations (Wikramanayake
et al. 2004).
For KSNP, the PVA models emphasized the merits
of concentrating anti-poaching effort on the smallest
subpopulations and maintaining habitat connectivity
between core 2 and both cores 1 and 4. The conversion
of forest to farmland has completely isolated cores 1
and 3. This stresses the importance of focusing anti-
poaching efforts on core 3, which is the strategy that the
PVA predicted to provide the greatest benefits for this
core.However,theseconservationstrategiesaredependent
on future poaching and deforestation patterns in and
around each core area (Pressey & Taffs 2001). If a new
road bisected core 2, making it more vulnerable than
the other core areas, it would warrant greater protection
measures at core 2. Thus, within each core area, separate
detection­non-detection surveys should be conducted
on a yearly basis to determine the change in tiger popu-
lation trends (i.e. PAO estimates) so that the success of
tiger conservation strategies in KSNP can be evaluated.
THE EFFECT OF ROADS
The construction of a road through high-quality tiger
habitat in Russia was found to reduce a source popu-
lation to a sink population that no longer provided sup-
plementary tigers to neighbouring areas (Kerley et al.
2002). Roads detrimentally affect other large carnivores,
such as Iberian lynxes Felis pardini, Eurasian lynxes
Lynx lynx and pumas Puma concolor, by increasing
unnatural mortality rates through road kills (Ferreras
et al. 1992; Maehr 1997; Kramer-Schadt et al. 2004), and
grizzly bears Ursus arctos and wolves Canis lupus by
restricting movements across their ranges (Mace et al.
1996; Whittington, St Clair & Mercer 2004). The other
insidious effect of roads is that they provide access to
more remote habitat that contains greater amounts
of bushmeat for poachers (Bennett & Robinson 2000)
and better quality land for farmers (Linkie, Smith &
Leader-Williams 2004).
CONSERVATION OF LARGE CARNIVORES
The approach developed in this study has wide appli-
cation to the conservation of cryptic species living at low
densities over large areas, such as many large carnivores.
The detection­non-detection survey method can be used
to monitor population trends through changes in PAO
estimates. The combined SEHM and PVA model can
be used to determine which strategies are most likely to
be successful and cost-effective at protecting different
subpopulations. As carnivores must be managed in both
physical and political landscapes (Treves & Karanth
2003), thisapproachcanalsobeusedtoshowstakeholders
what is likely to happen without appropriate conserva-
tion intervention.
