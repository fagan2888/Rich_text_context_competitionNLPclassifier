This study examined whether depressive symptoms increase with age longitudinally, and it evaluated two
potential sources of influence--declining health and non-health-related negative life events. Adults aged 29­93
years from the Swedish Adoption/Twin Study of Aging completed the Center for Epidemiologic Studies­
Depression scale three times at 3-year intervals. Analyses were performed on one twin (n = 877) and repeated on
the second twin (n = 909) as a nonindependent replication. Depressive symptoms increased modestly with age
in both men and women, particularly in the older participants. Health status was correlated with depressive
symptoms, but new illnesses in the previous 3 years did not consistently predict increases in depressive symptoms
longitudinally. Negative life events in the previous 3 years predicted depressive symptoms. Notably, depressive
symptoms also predicted future negative life events.
DEPRESSIVE symptoms, which are more common in late
life than in middle age (Kessler, Foster, Webster, &
House, 1992), are associated with serious negative outcomes
such as increased risk of a depressive disorder (Beekman et al.,
1997) and increased morbidity and mortality (Bruce, Seeman,
Merrill, & Blazer, 1994). Thus, it is important for us to under-
stand the association between aging and depressive symptoms.
Investigating this critical issue can be difficult, however, be-
cause of the need for large, population-based, longitudinal sam-
ples covering a wide range of ages. The current study
represents an unusual opportunity to examine depressive
symptoms and aging in such a sample.
In cross-sectional studies, levels of depressive symptoms are
highest in the youngest and oldest adults, yielding a U-shaped
curve (Kessler et al., 1992). The higher levels of symptoms in
older compared with middle-aged adults thus represent the
right-hand portion of that curve.
We need longitudinal data, however, to discern whether
depressive symptoms actually change with age or whether
differences between midlife and old age represent a cohort
effect or some sort of selection effect. We found only two
longitudinal studies of depressive symptoms and aging that
included any middle-aged participants. Rothermund and
Brandtsta
¨dter (2003) found modest increases over 8 years in
a sample of persons aged 54­77, and Barefoot and colleagues
(Barefoot, Mortensen, Helms, Avlund, & Schroll, 2001) found
increases only for men in their sample of men and women
interviewed at ages 50, 60, and 80. Several longitudinal in-
vestigations have been conducted in samples limited to older
adults. Most have not detected changes in depressive symptoms
over time (Dent et al., 1999; Haynie, Berg, Johansson, Gatz, &
Zarit, 2001; Henderson et al., 1997). However, Wallace and
O'Hara (1992) found increases in depressive symptoms over 6
years of follow-up. Thus, existing longitudinal studies provide
limited support for the increase in depressive symptoms with
age that is suggested by cross-sectional studies. Studies with
wider age ranges and longer follow-up periods are needed.
We may ask whether increases in depressive symptoms in
old age may be accounted for by the inclusion of somatic
symptoms on depressive symptom checklists, because many
somatic symptoms of depression are also commonly found in
nondepressed older individuals who are physically ill. The
answer may depend on the measure used. Compared with
younger adults, older adults endorsed disproportionately more
somatic than nonsomatic items on several instruments (e.g.,
Bolla-Wilson & Bleecker, 1989) but not on the Center for
Epidemiologic Studies­Depression (CES-D) scale (e.g., Kess-
ler et al., 1992).
Beyond characterizing age-related trends in depressive
symptoms, many authors have examined covariates to test the
extent to which age-related patterns might be explained by
other variables. Health status consistently predicts depressive
symptoms in cross-sectional studies of older adults (e.g., Kraaij,
Arensman, & Spinhoven, 2002). Longitudinal investigations,
in contrast, have yielded mixed results. Although numerous
investigators report that health at one time point predicts the
emergence of a clinically significant level of depressive symp-
toms at the next (e.g., Geerlings, Beekman, Deeg, & Van
Tilburg, 2000; Prince, Harwood, Thomas, & Mann, 1998;
Wallace & O'Hara, 1992), studies controlling not only for
baseline depressive symptoms but also for baseline health status
have not found additional longitudinal effects of change in
health on depressive symptoms (Dent et al., 1999; Henderson
et al., 1997). Therefore, although there is much evidence that
health status is related to depressive symptoms in late life, it is
not clear whether change in health is associated with change in
depressive symptoms.
The relationship between health status and depressive
symptoms in late life may be reciprocal (e.g., Meeks, Murrell, &
Mehl, 2000). Recent research in mixed age samples shows
that both depressive disorders and depressive symptoms predict
later development of specific medical conditions, particularly
cardiovascular disease (reviewed by Musselman, Evans, &
Nemeroff, 1998).
Another focus in the study of late life depressive symptoms
has been the role of negative life events. Prior research has
yielded mixed findings. A meta-analysis of cross-sectional re-
search concluded that the total number of negative life events is

correlated with depressive symptoms in older adults, although
the effect is modest (r ¼ .15; Kraaij et al., 2002). Notably,
however, several large, population-based studies in older adults
have found no association (e.g., Beekman et al., 1995). In
a prospective study, Glass, Kasl, and Berkman (1997) found
that life events predicted depressive symptoms. Life events may
have a time-limited effect, lasting less than 6 months (Norris &
Murrell, 1987).
The relationship between life events and depressive symp-
toms may also be reciprocal. Several researchers have found,
primarily among younger adults, that depressive status predicts
future life events (e.g., Daley et al., 1997), which is consistent
with Hammen's (1991) stress-generation hypothesis. We found
no studies that examined this question specifically in older
adults.
Thus, existing empirical literature suggests that depressive
symptoms increase with age. There is ample evidence that
health status is associated with depressive symptoms in late life,
but longitudinal evidence that declining health explains in-
creasing depressive symptoms is thus far lacking. Prior research
also supports the conclusion that life events may lead to
depressive symptoms among older adults, although the effect
may be weak and time limited.
The present study tested several hypotheses regarding age
and depression. Our first hypothesis was that depressive
symptoms would increase between midlife and old age,
longitudinally as well as cross-sectionally, and that the increase
would not be fully explained by comorbid physical illness. We
further hypothesized that both declining health and non-health-
related negative life events would explain longitudinal in-
creases in depressive symptoms.
METHODS
Sample
Data for this study were collected as part of the Swedish
Adoption/Twin Study of Aging (SATSA; Pedersen et al.,
1991), which is a subset of the population-based Swedish
Twin Registry (Lichtenstein et al., 2002). The base sample
for SATSA was composed of all pairs of twins in the registry
who were reared apart and matched twins who were reared to-
gether. The 2,845 surviving individuals from these pairs were
contacted in 1984 by means of a mailed questionnaire.
Responses were received from 2,018 individuals (71% response
rate). Three additional questionnaires were mailed at 3-year
intervals to all surviving members who had not asked to
discontinue participation in the study. The latter three
questionnaires were used in the current study (referred to as
Times 1­3). Responses were received from 1,637 individuals
at Time 1, 1,496 individuals at Time 2, and 1,450 individuals at
Time 3. The proportion of surviving, prior-wave respondents
who participated at each time point was high (81% at Time
1, 87% at Time 2, and 89% at Time 3). Additional responses
were received at each wave from individuals who had not
participated in prior waves. Among those who responded at
Time 1, 12% had died by the end of the study, a further 13%
dropped out of the study, and 5% skipped Time 2 but resumed
at Time 3; thus, 70% of the sample completed questionnaires at
all three times (1,148). Of these respondents, 89% completed
the CES-D portion of the questionnaire, yielding a sample of
1,017 individuals for longitudinal analyses. Sample sizes for
individual analyses were reduced somewhat by missing data on
covariates.
Although data for the current study were gathered from
twins, pairs were randomly divided into two samples of
unrelated individuals to satisfy the assumption of independent
observations for statistical purposes. Sample 1 is the primary
sample for analysis. Sample 2 serves as a nonindependent
replication. Results are given for Sample 1. Except where
noted, Sample 2 results were similar. For some analyses, the
sample was divided into middle-aged (,60 years) and older
adults (60 years).
The mean age of the participants was 60 years (range ¼ 29­
93). Most were women (58%) and married (74%). Educational
attainment was low, reflecting the socioeconomic situation in
Sweden experienced by this cohort (58% completed or attended
elementary school; 27% went to O-level, trade, or folk school;
8% attended academic high school; and 7% attended a univer-
sity). All participants were Caucasian.
By design, half the twins in SATSA were separated early in
life. To determine whether rearing status might bias results, we
performed an analysis of variance. We found few differences.
Twins reared apart had slightly higher illness scores at one time
of measurement, F(1,573) ¼ 4.74 and p , .05, but these
findings were not replicated in the second sample. Twins reared
apart did not differ from twins reared together on CES-D
scores, age, or gender.
Instruments
CES-D. --The CES-D is a widely used self-report measure of
depressive symptoms (Radloff, 1977). Respondents rate how
often they experienced each of 20 symptoms within the past
week on a 0­3 scale, with four items that are reverse scored.
Reliability and validity of the scale have been demonstrated in
mixed age and older adult samples (e.g., Beekman et al., 1997).
Items were translated into Swedish for the SATSA project,
and they were backtranslated by a different individual to ensure
the original meanings were retained. The CES-D scale has
demonstrated measurement invariance across older and youn-
ger participants in the SATSA data set (Gatz, Johansson,
Pedersen, Berg, & Reynolds, 1993). It is highly internally
consistent; Cronbach's alpha was .89 at each wave.
Health. --We measured health status in two ways: current
illnesses and new illnesses. Participants were asked whether
they have or have had each of 38 medical conditions.
Symptoms of angina, myocardial infarct, claudication, chronic
bronchitis, and asthma were also assessed, and diagnostic
algorithms were applied to supplement the list of medical
conditions endorsed. The current illness scale was a weighted
sum of illnesses endorsed (or inferred by diagnostic algorithm).
The new illness scale was a subset of the current illness
measure, including only illnesses that had not been reported at
a prior wave (including the 1984 questionnaire not otherwise
used in the current study). Weighting was based on ratings by
a panel of seven physicians of likely disability that would result
from each condition. Agreement among raters was reasonable,
with at least five of the seven doctors agreeing on the majority

of items. If one or more items were missing, the entire scale
was considered missing, resulting in missing scores for 7% of
individuals who completed the CES-D scale. Older adults more
frequently reported most cardiovascular disorders, metabolic
disorders, ulcers, urinary tract disorders, and shingles, whereas
middle-aged adults more frequently reported migraines.
Life events. --Life events were measured at each wave with
a version of the Holmes and Rahe Social Readjustment Rating
Scale (Holmes & Rahe, 1967) that was modified for use with
older adults (Persson, 1980). For each of 14 events, participants
rated whether it had occurred and, if it had, whether it was of
little, some, or great importance. The present study included
only negative items, non-health-related events (to create a scale
complementary to the illness scales), and items that did not
primarily reflect mental illness in the participant (to avoid
confounding life events and depressive symptom scales). The
scale only included events not reported at the preceding wave
(or any prior wave for death of a child, death of a spouse, and
placement of spouse in an institution). Responses to divorce
and widowhood items were augmented with demographic
information. The total scale score is the sum of item scores,
weighted by mean importance ratings across the entire sample.
Missing items were imputed by using the sample item mean.
If more than two items were missing, a total scale score was
not computed. The most frequent event reported for both
age groups was deterioration in financial status. Most events
that differed in frequency were reported more often in older
participants (including deterioration in financial status, death or
illness in relatives or friends, and caregiving), supporting the
intent of the scale, which was designed for use with older
adults. Only divorce was more frequent in middle-aged adults.
Analysis
We tested our first hypothesis, that depressive symptoms
would increase with age, by using both cross-sectional (linear
regression) and longitudinal (repeated measures analysis of
variance) analyses. Because we anticipated the greatest age
differences in the oldest ages, we tested for quadratic (age2)
as well as linear effects. To determine whether increases in
depressive symptoms could be an artifact of counting symp-
toms of physical illness, we tested specifically for changes in
three of the four CES-D subscales validated in previous work
(e.g., Gatz, Johansson, Pedersen, Berg, & Reynolds, 1993;
Hertzog, Van Alstine, Usala, Hultsch, & Dixon, 1990). The
psychomotor retardation subscale includes lack of motivation
and somatic symptoms of depression. The depressed mood
subscale includes affective symptoms. The lack of well-being
subscale is a reverse-scored measure of positive affect. A fourth
subscale, interpersonal difficulties, was not used because of its
weak association with the overall scale (Hertzog et al., 1990).
We tested for Age3Gender interactions in both cross-sectional
and longitudinal analyses.
Before testing our hypothesis that declining health and other
negative life events would each predict change in depressive
symptoms over time, we first examined the combined and
independent effects of current illnesses and negative life events
on depressive symptoms by using a series of multivariate linear
regression models. We then tested the hypothesis by using
structural equation modeling (with Mx structural equation
modeling software; Neale, 1999). For each variable, we first
tested whether the longitudinal data were best represented by
a simplex pattern (specifying a transmission path, which allows
for stronger correlations between adjacent compared with distal
time points), a common factor model (correlations between
time points that do not follow the simplex pattern), or a model
assuming no correlation between time points. A nonsignificant
v2 was taken to indicate absolute model fit, whereas the
Akaike's information criterion (AIC) statistic was used to
determine the best model on the basis of both fit and parsimony.
We then tested a series of cross-lagged longitudinal models.
Analyses other than structural equation modeling used SAS
software (Version 8.02, SAS, Cary, NC).
RESULTS
Description
CES-D and current illness scores were highest for older
participants and women at each time point. Life event scores
were also highest in the older group, particularly among older
women (Table 1). Correlations between age and CES-D were
significant but modest (Table 2). Current and new illnesses, as
well as non-health-related life events, were significantly
correlated with CES-D scores.
Do Depressive Symptoms Increase With Age?
In cross-sectional analyses, CES-D scores were higher in
older participants after gender effects were adjusted for. Linear
age differences were significant at all three waves; that is, Time
1, F(2,635) ¼ 16.38 and p , .0001; Time 2, F(2,617) ¼ 9.40
and p ¼ .002; and Time 3, F(2,649) ¼ 33.82 and p , .0001. A
quadratic effect at Time 2, F(3,616) ¼ 7.95 and p ¼ .005, was
significant as well. No interaction was found between age and
gender. Total variance explained was relatively small, that is,
R2 ¼ .04, .07, and .09 at Times 1, 2, and 3, respectively.
Longitudinally, there was a significant interaction between
age and time (Wilks's lambda ¼ 3.99, df ¼ 2, and p ¼ .02).
Therefore, we performed analyses separately by age group.
CES-D scores increased in the older group, F(1,270) ¼ 10.24
and p , .01, but not in the middle-aged group, which is
consistent with the right-hand portion of the U-shaped curve
reported in earlier studies. The mean CES-D score among older
participants increased 1.6 points over 6 years. There were no
interactions between time and gender, indicating that rates of
change in depressive symptoms over time did not differ
significantly between men and women.
We next considered age changes in subscales as a way of
testing whether increases in CES-D scores could be explained
by physical illness. As would be expected, the psychomotor
retardation subscale, which includes symptoms that could
reflect physical illness, was higher in older respondents in
cross-sectional analyses adjusting for sex. That is, Time 1,
F(2,616) ¼ 21.77 and p , .0001, Time 2, F(2,608) ¼ 13.67 and
p ¼ .0002, and Time 3, F(2,633) ¼ 46.13 and p , .0001, with
significant quadratic effects at Time 1, F(3,615) ¼ 4.11 and p ¼
.04, and Time 2, F(3,607) ¼ 10.38 and p ¼ .001. Longitudinal
increases were significant only among older participants at
FISKE ET AL.
P322
F(1,252) ¼ 11.95 and p , .001. In Sample 2, longitudinal
increases were significant in both age groups.
However, depressed mood subscale scores also increased
with age. That is, Time 1, F(2,625) ¼ 12.67 and p ¼ .0004;
Time 2, F(2,614) ¼ 9.28 and p ¼ .002; and Time 3, F(2,639) ¼
33.23 and p , .0001. There was a significant quadratic effect at
Time 2, with F(3,613) ¼ 12.67 and p ¼ .0004. Longitudinal
analyses indicated significant increases in the older group only,
F(1,260) ¼ 13.43 and p , .001, with no gender interaction. In
Sample 2, depressed mood scores increased significantly with
time in middle-aged participants and there was a nonsignificant
trend in the older group (results not shown).
Lack of well-being showed no consistent age differences in
cross-sectional or longitudinal analyses and no gender differences.
Are Illnesses or Life Events Associated
With Depressive Symptoms?
Because depressive symptoms increased with age, we next
tested the extent to which current illnesses and non-health-related
negative life events could explain the increases. In hierarchical
linear regression, both current illnesses and non-health-related
events were significant independent predictors of CES-D score at
each wave, when sex was controlled for (Table 3 shows Wave 1).
The additional variance explained by life events, beyond that
predicted by current illnesses, provides further evidence that age
differences are not solely due to comorbid physical illness. As
seen in Table 3 (Eq. 5), age remained a significant predictor
of CES-D score after covariates were adjusted for. Thus, age
differences are greatly but not completely explained by a com-
bination of current health status and negative life events.
Do New Illnesses or Life Events Explain Longitudinal
Changes in Depressive Symptoms?
The next hypothesis was that new illnesses and non-health-
related life events would each significantly predict longitudinal
change in depressive symptoms. In preliminary analyses, we
determined that both a simplex and a common factor model fit
the longitudinal CES-D data in Sample 1: simplex, v2(1) ¼
0.17, ns, and AIC ¼ ÿ1.83; common factor, v2(2) ¼ 0.81, ns,
and AIC ¼ ÿ3.19. In Sample 2, however, the common factor
model provided a less good fit: v2(2)¼5.04, p¼.08, and AIC¼
1.04. Thus, the simplex model was chosen for CES-D data in
the multivariate model. The common factor model fit the
new illness data, v2(2) ¼ 2.81, ns, whereas the simplex did not,
v2(2) ¼ 4.10 and p ¼ .04; the same pattern was seen in
Sample 2. Neither model fit the life event data. Therefore, a
multivariate cross-lagged model was fit that combined the sim-
plex model for CES-D data and the common factor model for
new illness, with life events specified as unrelated influences
at each time point.

aNew illnesses at Time 1 include only those current illnesses that were not reported on the 1984 questionnaire (a wave not otherwise used in the current
study). New illnesses at Times 2 and 3 include current illnesses not reported at a prior wave or on the 1984 questionnaire.
DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS AND AGING P323
Estimated path coefficients for the full model (Table 4, M0)
are included in Figure 1. A series of models was fit to test for
significance of directional paths by examining loss of fit (Áv2)
when sets of paths were dropped from the model (Table 4).
In Twin 1, new illnesses did not predict depressive symptoms
at the next time of measurement (M2 ÿ M0), and depressive
symptoms did not predict new illnesses (M1ÿM0). The pattern
of path coefficients indicates that (a) depressive symptoms are
highly stable across time points, with few new influences
beyond Time 1; (b) new illnesses also show stability, with a
common process influencing occurrence of new illnesses; and
(c) the only indication of an association between illness and
CES-D score was at the first time point. In separate models in
middle-aged and older participants, as in the full sample, new
illnesses did not predict depressive symptoms and depressive
symptoms did not predict new illnesses. In Sample 2, in
contrast, new illnesses did significantly predict depressive
symptom scores and vice versa. Notably, as in Sample 1, the
strongest association between new illnesses in the past 3 years
and CES-D score occurred at the first time point, suggesting
that these findings reflect, to some extent, the baseline cor-
relation between the measures rather than a truly prospective
effect. This interpretation is consistent with results we obtained
in additional cross-lagged longitudinal models we fit testing the
relationship between current illnesses and CES-D score (results
not shown). In those models, the relationship between current
illness and CES-D score was fully explained by baseline
correlation in both Samples 1 and 2, with no significant paths
from illness to later CES-D score or from CES-D score to later
illness.
Negative life events within the past 3 years predicted cur-
rent depressive symptoms (Table 4, M4 ÿ M0). In addition,
depressive symptoms predicted negative life events at the next
time of measurement (M3 ÿ M0). Results were replicated in
Twin 2. A multigroup model showed no age group differences.
To aid in interpreting the finding that illness was only an
inconsistent predictor of depressive symptoms, we tested post
hoc whether illness would predict ``incidence'' or ``persistence''
of clinically significant depressive symptoms. Incidence, which
was examined in participants with baseline CES-D scores
below 16, was defined as an increase of at least 5 points in
CES-D score to a level of 16 or greater at either Time 2 or Time
3. Persistence, examined in participants with baseline CES-D
scores of 16 or greater, was defined as a CES-D score of 16
or greater at Times 2 and 3. In logistic regression analyses,
baseline current illness scores predicted incidence, that is,
parameter estimate ¼ .07 (SE ¼ .03), LR (1, n ¼ 354) ¼ 4.05,
p ¼ .04, odds ratio (OR) ¼ 1.07, and 95% confidence interval
(CI) ¼ (1.00, 1.14), but did not significantly predict persistence,
that is, parameter estimate ¼ .06 (SE ¼ .06), LR (1, n ¼ 76) ¼
1.08, p ¼ .31, OR ¼ 1.06, and 95% CI ¼ (0.94, 1.20). In both
analyses, effects were small.
DISCUSSION
This 6-year longitudinal study, with its large, population-
based sample, provides evidence of modest increases in
depressive symptoms with age for both men and women,
particularly for older participants. Increases in CES-D scores do
not occur only on somatic symptoms and are not entirely an

artifact of comorbid physical illness. Together, current health
status and non-health-related life events explain most of the
relationship between age and depressive symptoms. Although
current illnesses predicted depressive symptoms cross-section-
ally, we found only inconsistent support for the hypothesis
that new illnesses increase depressive symptoms over time.
Non-health-related negative life events, in contrast, do affect
depressive symptoms and depressive symptoms also affect later
negative life events.
The longitudinal increase in CES-D scores in the present
sample demonstrates that cross-sectional results in other studies
(e.g., Kessler et al., 1992) cannot be explained fully by cohort
effects; rather, they represent within-person change over time.
Results extend the findings of Wallace and O'Hara (1992) and
Rothermund and Brandtsta
¨dter (2003), who used more limited
age ranges. The current findings support the right-hand portion
of the U-shaped curvilinear relationship between CES-D score
and age found in other studies (e.g., Kessler et al., 1992), as
longitudinal increases were found only in older participants.
Age-related increases seen in the current study have not been
consistently detected in the few other longitudinal studies,
perhaps because effects are modest and may not be reliably
detected with smaller samples or shorter follow-up periods. It
should be noted that the magnitude of increase in depressive
symptoms does not imply clinically significant increases in
depression among most older adults. Rather, the mean increase
of 1.6 points over 6 years is equivalent to reporting a slightly
increased frequency of one or two symptoms.
Although some have suggested that increasing depressive
symptoms with age may largely reflect comorbid physical illness
(Bolla-Wilson & Bleeker, 1989), this is not true in the current
study. Age effects remained in the cross-sectional analyses after
illnesses were controlled for. Furthermore, age differences were
found on both mood and psychomotor retardation subscales.
Despite a growing literature suggesting that the gender gap
in levels of depressive symptoms may narrow with age (e.g.,
Barefoot et al., 2001), neither our cross-sectional nor our
longitudinal results supported this conclusion. Our findings are
consistent with others (e.g., Kessler et al., 1992) who have
found higher levels of depressive symptoms among women
than men throughout late life.
The use of both cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses
enabled us to gain a more complete picture of the relationship
between health status and depressive symptoms than has been
possible in studies limited to cross-sectional samples. Con-
sistent with existing literature, current health status was
significantly associated with depressive symptoms in cross-
sectional analyses. Longitudinal results, however, provided
only inconsistent support for the prediction that increases in
depressive symptoms would be predicted by health events, as
effects were small and not significant in both samples. A
consistent finding, however, is that depressive symptoms were
highly stable and the relationship between depressive symp-
toms and health was evident at the outset. These analyses
and results are similar to those in the report by Meeks and
colleagues (2000). Like Geerlings and colleagues (2000), we
found that baseline health predicted incidence of clinically
significant depressive symptoms. Unlike Geerlings and col-
leagues, we found that baseline illness did not predict persistent
depressive symptoms. However, Geerlings and associates noted
that health status did not predict a course marked by frequent
fluctuations within a 3-year interval. These results raise the
question of whether short-term fluctuation about a stable CES-
D score could have occurred undetected in our study with its 3-
year measurement intervals. Then, lack of consistent support
for the hypothesis that change in illnesses would predict change
in depressive symptoms could stem largely from high levels of
measured stability of depressive symptoms.
The stability of depressive symptoms was particularly
impressive when we consider the nature of the scale, which
assesses for symptoms over the past week. Although depressive
symptoms are thought to reflect a state, this study and others
(e.g., Rothermund & Brandtsta
¨dter, 2003) suggest they may
indicate an underlying trait. The stability may also reflect the
continuity of depressive symptoms commonly found prodromal
to, or persistent following, a depressive episode (Fava, 1999).
A notable finding of the current study is the lack of inter-
action between age and health, indicating that health is not
more important in predicting depressive symptoms in late life
than it is earlier in life. Although health status has often been
cited as a particularly prominent risk factor for depressive
symptoms in old age, current results indicate that health status
assumes a larger role with age primarily as a result of the
increasing frequency of health problems.
The current results offer new insights into the relation-
ship between negative life events and depressive symptoms.
Longitudinally, direct effects of life events did not carry over
beyond the 3-year measurement interval, suggesting recovery
and supporting the findings of previous research that indicates
short-lived effects for life events (e.g., Norris & Murrell, 1987).
There may be indirect effects, however, because change in
depressive symptoms also predicted later life events and thus
a recursive cycle may develop in which negative events and
depressive states become self-perpetuating.
The finding that depressive symptoms predicted later life
events is intriguing and has not, to our knowledge, been

DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS AND AGING P325
previously reported specifically in an older adult sample.
Brostedt and Pedersen (2003) found that depressive disorders
were associated with later stressful life events in a mixed
age sample. In addition, a handful of investigators have found
that depressive diagnosis or depressive symptoms predict later
stressful events in younger samples (e.g., Daley et al., 1997).
The current results support Hammen's (1991) stress-generation
model, which predicts that some of the stressful events that
befall depressed individuals--in particular, events associated
with interpersonal conflict--are directly attributable to their
own characteristics and behaviors and the contexts in which
they live. Poor social functioning, observed among individuals
with elevated depressive symptoms (see Fava, 1999), may
partly explain this effect.
Limitations of the Study
The original scale on which our life event measure was
based, the Social Readjustment Rating Scale (SRRS), has been
the subject of criticism (e.g., Chiriboga, 1989), although
adjustments for the present study mitigate concerns. The SRRS
remains a widely used self-report checklist of stressful events,
however, and has repeatedly demonstrated utility in predicting
distress (Scully, Tosi, & Banning, 2000).
Because life events were reported retrospectively, it is
possible that current depressive symptoms may have biased the
reporting of past events. Nonetheless, the finding that depres-
sive symptoms affect future life events was based on prospective
data.
As in any longitudinal study, selective attrition is a concern.
Attrition analyses tested whether death or dropout from the
study was predicted by CES-D score. With a link to the
Swedish Death Register, we determined that death accounted
for nearly half of study attrition. Individuals who died or
dropped out had higher baseline CES-D scores than those who
completed all three times. Attrition could not be explained by
depressive symptom levels, however, because it was better

predicted by advanced age. Other investigators have concluded
that such attrition may affect descriptive results but have little
impact on findings regarding association between variables
(e.g., Kempen & van Sonderen, 2002). In the current study, the
main result of such a pattern of attrition would be to under-
estimate age-related increases in depressive symptoms.
Several findings differed between Samples 1 and 2.
Longitudinal changes in psychomotor retardation and de-
pressed mood symptoms showed different patterns of signif-
icance across samples. Because the magnitude of longitudinal
change in CES-D scores was small (1.6 points over 6 years), it
is not surprising that effects were not consistently significant. In
the same way, new illnesses did not significantly predict
depressive symptoms longitudinally in Sample 1, but they did
in Sample 2. Differences may reflect the small magnitude of
effects. It is notable that, longitudinally, the non-health-related
life event score was a much stronger predictor of depressive
symptoms than was the new illness score, even in Sample 2.
Thus, lack of consistency in certain findings across samples
highlights the small magnitude of these particular effects.
Some may question the use of twins. The fact that SATSA
twins are similar in health and sociological characteristics to
a cross section of the Swedish population of the same age
(Pedersen et al., 2002) suggests that use of this data set to test
non-twin research questions is appropriate. Further, this large,
population-based, longitudinal data set offers advantages over
other longitudinal studies published to date.
Conclusions
In summary, we conclude that depressive symptoms increase
slightly with age and that the increase is not merely a cohort
effect or an artifact of measuring symptoms of comorbid
physical illness. Certain negative life events, which are reported
more frequently in late life, explain some of the increases in
depressive symptoms. Physical illnesses, which also become
more common in late life, are correlated with depressive symp-
toms, but new illnesses only inconsistently predict change in
depressive symptoms over time.
