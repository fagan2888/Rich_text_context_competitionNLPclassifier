In 2006, one advancement in health care was the release of
the Gardasil vaccination which protects against the most
common sexually transmitted infection, genital human papil-
lomavirus (HPV; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
[CDC], 2012a). Cervarix is another HPV vaccine, but it pro-
tects against fewer strains of HPV and is only available to
women. Initially, the Gardasil vaccine was only available to
women and specifically targeted young girls (11 to 12 years
old), but in 2009, it was approved for use with men (U.S.
Food and Drug Administration, 2010). Although it was
approved for use, it was not endorsed publicly for use with
men until October 2011.At this time, theAdvisory Committee
on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommended that men
and women ages 11 to 26 should receive the HPV vaccine
(CDC, 2012b).
Prior to this recommendation by the ACIP, the vaccines
were targeted toward young children (11 to 12 year olds).
This means that the current college population did not have
the option to be vaccinated, at that age, and therefore, they
will be investigated in the current study. The Gardasil vac-
cine is important because of the ability to protect against
some of the most common and dangerous strains of HPV (6,
11, 16, and 18) as well as because it is available to both men
and women (Friedman & Shepeard, 2007). Strains 6, 11, 16,
and 18 cause a variety of cancers, including cervical, vagi-
nal, penile, and oropharyngeal; they are also responsible for
90% of genital warts cases (CDC, 2012a; U.S. Department
of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health,
National Cancer Institute, 2012). The most recent report on
cancer in the United States revealed that HPV continues to
be an issue (Jemal et al., 2013). Most cancers are decreas-
ing, but a few associated with HPV, particularly oropharyn-
geal and anal, are on the rise (Jemal et al., 2013). One of the
main concerns with the vaccine, and potential cause for the
increase in HPV related cancers, is the lack of immunization
rate, particularly among the college population (Licht et al.,
2010).
The ACIP recommendation for males to receive the vac-
cination increases the need for research that looks at both
men and women. One of the more studied populations in
regard to HPV vaccination rates are college women. Licht
et al. (2010) found that in a sample of 406 college women,
only 44% had received at least one HPV vaccination shot.
While vaccination rates are somewhat low, the likelihood of
contracting HPV is fairly high as the CDC (2012a) estimated
that around six million people will contract HPV each year.
College students are no different, and when 263 couples
were checked for an HPV infection, more than 60% (64%)
had at least one partner who was carrying a strain of the virus
(Burchell, Tellier, Hanley, Coutlee, & Franco, 2010). The
proliferation of HPV among college students appears to be
high, and the next step is determining how to reach this at
risk population.

College Men and Women and Their
Intent to Receive Genital Human
Papillomavirus Vaccine
Keith Richards1
Abstract
The study set out to investigate what influences the intentions of college students to get vaccinated against genital human
papillomavirus (HPV). College men and women were surveyed to understand their intentions. Regression was used and
supported that the constructs of the health belief model (HBM) as well as gender, norms, and information seeking contributed
to predicting intent to receive the HPV vaccine, R2 = .61, F(6, 159) = 39.41, p < .001. Benefits and barriers were the most
influential variable, and men were more likely to intend to receive the vaccine. The findings should be applied to future
campaigns aimed at increasing preventive health behaviors, especially vaccinations among college students.

Health Belief Model (HBM)
One of the most popular theories for studying health behaviors
and following health recommendations is the HBM (Allen
et al., 2010; Janz & Becker, 1984). The four main constructs of
HBM are perceived susceptibility, severity, benefits, and bar-
riers (D'Souza, Zyngier, Robinson, Schlotterlein, & Sullivan-
Mort, 2011). The model predicts that behavior is influenced by
weighing the threat (susceptibility and severity) and their abil-
ity to reduce the threat (benefits and barriers; Marlow, Waller,
Evans, & Wardle, 2009). HBM provides a framework that has
shown significant relationships between the four variables
and intentions to perform a recommended health behavior
(Harrison, Mullen, & Green, 1992). Additional variables are
being tested because more knowledge surrounding what is
most influential in increasing intentions could lead to better
promotional messages targeted at college students in regard to
vaccine uptake.
Mehta and Sharma (2011) found in a sample of college
men that perceived susceptibility was a significant contribu-
tor to vaccine intentions. Gainforth, Cao, and Latimer-
Cheung (2012) found similar results with a group of almost
300 college females, as their feelings of susceptibility
increased so did their intent to get vaccinated. For someone
to take action, they must feel that they are susceptible to con-
tracting HPV and that it would pose severe consequences
(genital warts/cancer; Harrison et al., 1992; Marlow et al.,
2009). If both of these conditions present themselves, then
the individual is more likely to take the recommended action.
Hypothesis 1 (H1): Perceived susceptibility positively
influences behavioral intention.
Hypothesis 2 (H2): Perceived severity positively influ-
ences behavioral intention.
In a study of college age women (18 to 26 years), some of
the barriers to getting the HPV vaccine were lack of time,
cost of the vaccine, as well as short- and long-term side
effects from the vaccination (Brewer & Fazekas, 2007; Katz,
et al., 2009). Time is an important potential barrier because
the vaccine is administered over a 6-month period and
requires a total of three injections. Another study found that
worry related to the side effects from the vaccine lowered
young women's intentions to receive the HPV vaccination
(Juraskova, Bari, O'Brien, & McCaffery, 2011). In addition
to any barrier to getting vaccinated, there are benefits such as
limiting the chances of getting genital warts, being infected
with cancer, or spreading HPV strains that could cause can-
cer in a sexual partner. Juraskova et al. (2011) used HBM to
predict vaccine intention and found that perceived benefits
were a significant factor that contributed to vaccine inten-
tion. Marlow and colleagues (2009) as well as Mehta,
Sharma, and Lee (2013) each found similar results indicating
that the promotion of the benefits of the vaccine over any
barriers was significant. HBM uses benefits and barriers as
one variable with the perceived barriers being subtracted
from the perceived benefits (Janz & Becker, 1984).
Hypothesis 3 (H3): Benefits minus barriers positively
influences behavioral intention.
Norms
Norms relate to the social pressure that can be placed on indi-
viduals to perform certain actions to stay in line with the
expectations of their particular social group (Bandura, 2004).
Friends, significant others, parents, and anyone who is valued
are important sources of information among college students,
and they can play a role in influencing whether someone
knows about HPV, the available vaccine, and whether they
feel support to get vaccinated (Allen et al., 2009; Gainforth
et al., 2012; Pleasant & Sandfort, 2009; Ratanasiripong,
Cheng, & Enriquez, 2013). The current study expects norms
to be an influence on vaccination intent as they have influ-
enced other health behaviors (Bandura, 2004)
Hypothesis 4 (H4): Norms will positively effect behav-
ioral intention.
Knowledge of HPV
To actively seek a vaccine, individuals will most likely need
to have some knowledge about the vaccination so they feel
comfortable receiving the injections. In the survey by Licht
et al. (2010), they found that most of the women participat-
ing were not aware that both men and women are affected by
HPV, that it can be transmitted from skin to skin contact, and
that it is responsible for causing most of the cases of genital
warts. Another survey of more than 1,400 found similar
results regarding low knowledge that HPV causes genital
warts and that most sexually active individuals will contract
HPV during their lifetime (Marlow, Zimet, McCaffery,
Ostini, & Waller, 2013). In a survey of both men and women,
the females surveyed were more knowledgeable when it
came to understanding that women suffer negative conse-
quences more often, that HPV can cause cervical cancer, and
women were more aware that vaccines existed to protect
against HPV (Marlow et al., 2013; Pleasant & Sandfort,
2009; Ratanasiripong et al., 2013). Men were less aware of
the connection between HPV and genital warts and were less
likely to understand the risk HPV poses to their health
(Pleasant & Sandfort, 2009). There have been studies related
to men and their knowledge or willingness to receive the
HPV vaccine, but more studies need to be done to understand
what will influence them to receive the HPV vaccine
(Gainforth et al., 2012). In addition to not having as many
studies look at their knowledge of HPV, men have not been
the target of most vaccination programs (Marlow et al., 2013;
Stupiansky, Alexander, & Zimet, 2012). Research has shown
that women are more likely to take protective action in terms
Richards 3
of their health and they are more likely to follow the recom-
mendations of a physician (Courtenay, McCreary, & Merighi,
2002; Weiss, Larsen, & Baker, 1996). This research indicates
that women may be more likely to be vaccinated, and this
study will provide greater insight now that men are eligible
to be vaccinated.
Hypothesis 5 (H5): Females will have greater intent to
receive the HPV vaccine.
Information Seeking
Katz, Krieger, and Roberto (2011) surveyed 165 male col-
lege students about where they found their information
regarding HPV. The most popular sources of information
were television, Internet, and their friends. Other studies
have found similar results with television and the Internet
being the most popular information sources (Katz et al.,
2009; Pleasant & Sandfort, 2009). The Internet was particu-
larly important to those learning about HPV because they
said, after hearing about the vaccine, they used the Internet to
gather more information (Katz et al., 2009). Using the
Internet to find information is only part of the equation as
individuals may find information from a variety of sources.
The current study looks to see what kind of influence infor-
mation seeking will have on intent to get vaccinated.
Hypothesis 6 (H6): Information seeking positively
increases behavioral intention.
Method
A convenience sample of students was recruited from under-
graduate courses at a large university in the southern United
States during the spring of 2012. Professors of communica-
tion courses were approached to see if they would offer the
survey to their students. Those who accepted agreed to send
an email to their students that contained details about the
study and a link to the survey. The survey was hosted by a
secure online site which allowed complete anonymity, which
was important because of the sensitive nature of the topic. If
students chose to participate, they clicked on the link (in the
email) and it took them to the survey which took about 15
min to complete. To be eligible for the study, the student
needed to be at least 18 years of age and to have not received
any HPV vaccine shot. Those who had received a shot were
not eligible because if they were included in the sample, it
could artificially inflate or deflate the behavioral intention
measure. The research was reviewed and approved by the
university's institutional review board (IRB).
The study looked to better understand the influence of six
key variables on behavioral intention. The first three hypoth-
eses dealt with the influence of perceived susceptibility, per-
ceived severity, and the combination of benefits and barriers
on intentions to receive the HPV vaccine. These are all
elements of the HBM which have been found to be useful in
understanding what influences an individual to take a recom-
mended health action (Allen et al., 2010; Janz & Becker,
1984). The final three hypotheses were added to improve the
understanding of what influences intentions. These predicted
that norms, being female, and seeking health information
would increase vaccine intentions.
Participants
The analyses were run using the Statistical Package for the
Social Sciences (SPSS) 16.0. A total of 350 students received
an email detailing the study and the restrictions on participa-
tion, and of these students, 53% (186) completed the survey.
The population contained a total of 105 men (56.5%), 81
women (43.5%), and as a group, they were on average 19
years old (M = 18.92). Most of the population identified
themselves as White (70.4%), while the second largest group
was Asian (17.7%).
Measures
The survey consisted of a number of measures that were
drawn from the literature. Each of the scales was a 7-point
scale with answer choices ranging from strongly disagree to
strongly agree. To measure behavioral intention, four Likert-
type questions were used. The questions centered around
whether the participant planned on "considering getting the
HPV vaccine," whether they would "try to get the HPV vac-
cine," whether they would "get the complete HPV vaccine,"
and "if approached by a health care provider, would you get
the vaccine." Perceived severity was a four-item Likert-type
scale, and each of the questions dealt with feelings related to
how being infected with HPV would be disruptive to their
"social life," "physical health," "romantic relationship," and
"life overall." The behavior measure and the perceived sever-
ity scale were modified from scales created by Gerend and
Barley (2009). An additional four-item Likert-type scale
measured perceived susceptibility. The susceptibility mea-
sure dealt with the likelihood of infection and asked whether
the participants felt vulnerable to contracting HPV and used
statements such as "It is likely that I will contract HPV"
(Cismaru & Lavack, 2006; Courneya & Hellsten, 2010;
Duncan, Schaller, & Park, 2009).
Benefits and barriers measures were adapted from
research related to the HPV vaccination (Friedman &
Shepeard, 2007; Katz et al., 2011; Stupiansky et al., 2012).
The four benefits questions asked participants how willing
they would be to receive the vaccine if it protected them and
their partners from genital warts and different types of can-
cer. Six questions were used for measuring the impact of
barriers. Some of the questions asked whether the effective-
ness, safety, fear of pain, cost, and time spent making trips
to the doctor would lessen the chances of the participant get-
ting vaccinated.
4 SAGE Open
Norms were measured with seven Likert-type questions
that asked participants whether they felt their friends would
support them in receiving the vaccination as well as questions
that asked about their communication with friends related to
their health (Borsari & Carey, 2003; Cialdini, Reno, &
Kallgren, 1990). Two norms statements were "My closest
friends would approve of me getting the HPV vaccination"
and "My friends and I talk about safe sex practices."
Information seeking was a nine-item Likert-type scale
which asked questions about the use of the media such as
television, newspapers, and the Internet to find information
related to health and HPV. One information seeking item was
"I have searched online many times to find information
related to HPV." Outside of these measures, participants
answered questions related to demographics, sexual history,
health insurance, and current relationship status.
All of the scales were found to be reliable, with eight
scales having a reliability over .90 and two scales Norms (
= .86) and Barriers ( = .77) being reliable, but not having as
high of a reliability score. Next, each of the individual scales
was averaged. The average barriers score was subtracted
from the average benefits score (Janz & Becker, 1984). In
determining whether someone performs a certain action
related to their health, they often weigh the benefits and bar-
riers together rather than separately and to achieve this, they
need to be subtracted from one another to create a single
variable. If the benefits outweigh the barriers, the variable
will be positive, and if the barriers are more influential, then
the variable will be negative.
Results
The first three hypotheses predicted that susceptibility (H1),
severity (H2), and benefits and barriers (H3) would positively
influence behavioral intention. Regression was used to test
these hypotheses, and all three were supported as they
accounted for 51% of the variance in behavioral intention, R2 =
.51, F(3, 159) = 54.75, p < .001. Of these variables, the benefits
and barriers contributed the most ( = .53, p < .001), next was
perceived vulnerability ( = .27, p < .001), and finally per-
ceived severity ( = .25, p < .001). The next step was to inves-
tigate the final three hypotheses which predicted that norms
(H4), being female (H5), and information seeking (H6) would
all have positive effects on intent to receive the vaccine. These
were added to the regression equation that included severity,
vulnerability, and benefits and barriers, and they significantly
improved the model by increasing the variance explained, R2 =
.61, F(6, 159) = 39.41, p < .001. All six variables were signifi-
cant contributors, with benefits and barriers again being the
most influential ( = .46, p < .001); next was norms ( = .28,
p < .001), perceived severity ( = .17, p = .005), information
seeking ( = .16, p = .004), gender ( = .-16, p = .005); and
finally perceived vulnerability ( = .12, p = .035).After looking
at the hypotheses, it was important to look at the sexual history
and experiences of the population as they might influence
intentions. In terms of sexual intercourse, 107 members (58%)
of the population had intercourse with a majority (42%) having
between one and four sexual partners. Two additional equa-
tions were run with sexual intercourse and number of sexual
partners added to the regression. Neither variable contributed
significantly to the prediction of intent to receive the HPV
vaccine.
Discussion
The current study supports the use of the HBM for under-
standing vaccine intentions and added to the predictive abil-
ity of HBM. Although severity, susceptibility, and benefits
and barriers played significant roles, so too did norms, gen-
der, and information seeking. Working together, these vari-
ables were able to create a strong model that fit the data. The
most significant finding of the study was that males had
greater intention to get vaccinated than did females. This
went against what was predicted in the fourth hypothesis.
The negative influence in the regression equation showed
that men (coded as 1) had greater intentions to get vaccinated
than did females (coded as 2). This is interesting as this is
one of the first studies that was able to look at males who
were eligible and endorsed by the ACIP to receive the HPV
vaccine. The recommendation that males be vaccinated was
released in October 2011, and the study was conducted the
following spring.
HBM
The HBM is one of the most often used theories to help
explain why individuals take protective action related to
their health. As predicted, in the first three hypotheses, per-
ceived susceptibility, severity, benefits and barriers all were
strongly associated with intentions to receive the HPV vac-
cine (Janz & Becker, 1984, Juraskova et al., 2011; Marlow
et al., 2009; Mehta & Sharma, 2011). The benefits and barri-
ers variable had a significant positive relationship with
behavioral intention and demonstrates a need to highlight
how the benefits of receiving the vaccination outweigh the
potential barriers (Juraskova et al., 2011; Mehta et al., 2013).
Perceived severity had the next largest effect of the HBM
variables, and as individual feelings of severity increased, so
did behavioral intention. Next was perceived susceptibility,
and although it was a relatively small effect, it still was posi-
tively associated with intention. Those who felt susceptible
were more likely to be planning on getting vaccinated.
Norms
Overall, the norms variable had a positive effect in the model
which was predicted in the fourth hypothesis. The partici-
pants greatly valued the opinions of their friends. The norms
variable was positive such that more communication and
support from friends increased intent to get vaccinated. This
Richards 5
finding is similar to that of Dillard (2011) and Ratanasiripong
et al. (2013) who found that subjective norms was an impor-
tant factor, for females, in increasing intent to get vaccinated.
The current study adds males to this finding and illustrates
that norms are important for both males and females.
Information Seeking
Another communication variable included in the model was
information seeking, and the sixth hypothesis predicted that
it would increase intent to get vaccinated. This variable did
not limit information seeking to one source in particular, but
allowed it to occur across a range of sources with the hopes
that this would eliminate any issue of participants remember-
ing which source they found the information through. The
more that someone searched for health information, the more
likely they were to intend on getting vaccinated. This is an
important finding because it suggests that those who are
interested in finding more information are finding informa-
tion that supports that getting vaccinated is a good decision.
Two variables that were not significant in the model were
related to sexual experiences of the participants. This finding
is promising, in that no matter the sexual history of the indi-
viduals, they were all influenced by the same variables.
Future research can draw from these findings to put in motion
campaigns that will better target the college population for
current and future health problems. These campaigns are
necessary to lower the risk of a population who is in danger
of contracting various cancers and genital warts.
Limitations
One limitation is that participants self-reported their infor-
mation and may not be able to accurately recall their knowl-
edge or actions related to HPV. Participants self-selected into
the study, and those who decided to complete the survey may
have had an interest in HPV. More detailed questions about
the sexual history, history of sexually transmitted infection,
and use of contraception could present a clearer picture as to
why some may be reluctant to get vaccinated. Another
important series of questions to ask would center on the cost
of the vaccine and their knowledge of their insurance cover-
age. Cost was listed as a barrier, but if the participants were
unaware if their insurance would cover any of the cost asso-
ciated with the vaccination, then their thoughts on cost would
be altered. The recent changes to the insurance landscape
with the introduction of the Affordable Care Act should be
investigated to see how it influences vaccination costs and
intentions. The sample was not racially diverse which inhib-
its the generalizability of the results to a larger population.
Future Research
It is necessary to conduct longitudinal research to determine
if these participants actually follow through with their
intentions and receive the HPV vaccine. Future campaigns
should focus on young people's friends as the norms variable
played an important role in increasing intent to be vacci-
nated. The HPV measures used in the study can be used in
other research as they provided insight into intentions to get
vaccinated. Finding reliable measures is one aspect that
researchers have been looking for to better understand inten-
tions related to HPV (Allen et al., 2010). Men have only had
the opportunity to receive the vaccination for a few years,
and more research on this population should be conducted.
The current study laid the groundwork for this population
which needs to be studied more in depth as they appear inter-
ested in getting vaccinated.
