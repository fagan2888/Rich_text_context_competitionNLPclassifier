Abstract: Inspections to villages are an important mechanism for the Chinese government to gain
and retain its ruling legitimacy. However, whether inspections have been effectively utilized for that
designated purpose of sustainable governance remains less clear. We know very little about how the
Chinese government employs inspections to boost its public approval. This study sets out to examine
that effect, contending that inspections to Chinese villages significantly boost the public approval of
village leaderships by promoting the governing efficacy of village leaders. The consistent practice of
inspections results in a sustained level of public support for the Chinese government. This causal
relationship between inspections and public approval holds, first, by improving village social welfare
and economic development, and second, by securing for village leaders essential political and
financial support from higher authorities to better represent villagers' interests and mediate conflicts
among villagers. Using data of 961 randomly selected villages across China, the empirical analysis
shows that Chinese government inspections significantly boost villagers' approval regarding their
village leaders.

1. Introduction
In its more than five-thousand-year history, China has seen constant changes of its dynasties.
Despite a few military coups and internal splits in the inner circles of the royal families, most
of these dynasties saw an end to their rule upon losing popular support [1] (pp. 497, 523, 536).
Peasant uprisings, instead, ousted the incumbents and inaugurated their own revolutionary heroes
into office. This repeated practice of failed regimes overthrown by groups of disgruntled peasants, since
the early times of Chinese history, renders ruling legitimacy an essential ingredient for a lasting and
thriving reign in China [2]. Apart from the regular administration of national affairs in the royal palace,
the emperors often set out to tour different localities for strategic purposes. For instance, the emperor
Qianlong of Qing Dynasty (1711­1799) was known for his diligent but extravagant inspection tours
to localities to ensure social stability and popular satisfaction with his governance [3]. The Emperor
Wudi of Han (110 BC) toured the high places on the mountaintops to pay religious tributes to the
gods, because an important part of his ruling legitimacy relied upon the popular belief in his heavenly
mandated kingship [4].
In the contemporary China, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) conducts inspection tours to
boost and maintain public approval. Contemporary government inspections, of course, occur at
greater frequencies and with much more proximity to the grassroots than those by ancient emperors.
These inspections to localities are intended to police local officials and oversee local governance.

Officials in China at all levels are expected to tour areas under their jurisdiction to ensure smooth
performance of administrative affairs and proper resolution of local conflicts. Inspections to villages are
an important mechanism for the Chinese government to gain legitimacy. However, whether inspections
have been effectively utilized for this designated purpose remains less clear. We know very little about
how the Chinese government employs inspections to boost its public approval. Are these attempts by
higher officials to reach down to localities ever effective in helping the regime stay in power?
Sufficient research has looked into how authoritarian regimes maintains control and prolongs
its durability. Traditional literature seeks to outline factors that determine regime survival.
The overarching finding of this strand of scholarship is that political institutions, institutions of power
succession and political coalition, account for longer regime longevity [5,6]. Authoritarian regimes
resilient in adapting their structures and efficient in purging political oppositions tend to last longer
than those without these credentials. But few have focused upon how the daily governance conducted
by different authoritarian leaders on the ground actually benefits or harms regime survival. A sustained
level of regime legitimacy is not only a function of power plays among political rivals in the royal
palaces, but also a result of pragmatic connection to and resonances among the people ruled.
Inquiring into the utility of inspections in gaining the regime ruling legitimacy is important for
a number of reasons. First, inspections tours are costly. Unless they are meeting the desired goals,
inspections should be kept to a minimum. In ancient China, the emperors' lavishing tours required that
roads stretch along straight lines, resting stations be constructed to sizes and scale comparable to the
capital's royal palace [3]. Though inspection tours in contemporary China is much more cost-effective
with faster transportation and advanced tele-communication facilities, officials still have to sacrifice
valuable time and energy to visit localities. Especially inspections by high-profile officials, such as the
premier, take immense administrative resources and cause much disruption to local citizens' lives.
Second, to the extent that inspections do help the Chinese regime advance its political agenda,
understanding the political efficacy of inspections provides us with a unique window to assess
authoritarian governance in China. While political institutions are an important variable in evaluating
any given polity, how well the administration governs with these institutions is perhaps more
important. Chinese history offers the most telling evidence. From the Tang (618­907) through the
Ming Dynasty (1368­1644), the political institutions, including the extensive bureaucracy, expanded
while the dynasties have changed from one to another, indicating that how well a dynasty performs is
related to how it has utilized political institutions for its favor. Historians attribute the failure of these
dynasties mostly to incapable and irresponsive governance [2].
In this paper, I examine how visits by higher-level officials to villages reinforce the ruling
legitimacy of the Chinese regime. Specifically, this study delves into how inspections improve public
approval of the village leadership. If inspections help increase popular opinion of the leadership among
villagers, they serve the CCP's best interest in enhancing its ruling legitimacy. I contend that inspection
tours to Chinese villages significantly boost the public approval of village leaderships by promoting the
governing efficacy of village leaders. This causal relationship holds, first, by improving village social
welfare and economic development, and second, by securing for village leaders essential political and
financial support from higher authorities to better represent villagers' interests and mediate conflicts
among villagers. Using data of 961 randomly selected villages across China, the empirical analysis
shows that Chinese government inspections significantly boost villagers' approval regarding their
village leaders. In the following, I first present the theoretical argument of how Chinese government
inspections improve ruling legitimacy of the Chinese regime. Second, empirical analysis tests the
theory with multivariate regression models. The study then concludes with a discussion of findings
from the analysis and discussion on the future directions of relevant research topics.
2. Theory
Government inspections improve popular legitimacy of the village leadership, first and
foremost, through enhancing its governing efficacy. In a comprehensive study of county level
Sustainability 2018, 10, 1975 3 of 20
governments, the Chinese scholar, Liu Tianxu, argues that Chinese government inspections bring
salient improvement to village governance [7] (p. 117). Governance improves mainly through timely
enforcement of relevant policies and resolving challenges in a timely manner. Inspections serve as one
of the most important avenues of policy implementation for the Chinese government. While sometimes
abused by politicians to collect illegitimate fees and obtain personal gains, most inspections do bring
forth considerable improvement in local governance. My fieldwork also confirms the noticeable utility
of inspections in village governance. Most government officials I interviewed agree that government
inspections, while flawed in many ways, are useful for bolstering the unity of the village leadership and
checking behaviors of village leaders. News stories also abound about visits of the central government
officials, especially the president or the premier, have prompted immediate actions of local officials to
better people's livelihood in those inspected areas. The higher the authorities that conduct inspections,
the more coverage by TV and online news networks the inspection attracts. In particular, the central
government officials and provincial governors do well in publicizing their political activities.
The improvement comes both before and after inspections. Before-inspection improvement
is mainly a result of preemptive measures by local officials to ensure a good "image" in front of
their superiors prior to inspections. Before inspections arrive, local officials are usually on the
alert to present competent governance to their superiors in order to secure and promote their
positions [7] (p. 117), [8] (p. 89). To put smiles on the inspecting superiors' faces, local officials,
often notified "hinted" about the impending inspection, invest extensively on areas under their
jurisdiction where the "big figures" are most likely to arrive. For instance, in December 2012, knowing
that former Premier Wen Jiabao was about to visit their county but unaware of which specific village
in that county, local officials in Huanxian County, northwest China, selectively furnished the residence
infrastructure of a couple households that, in their opinion, Wen was most likely to inspect. It turned
out that Wen only went to only one of them. Liu Tianxu also reports similar alerted actions by local
officials: faking local development by particularly beautifying places where inspecting officials would
visit [7] (p. 118).
Interviews in northwest China also reveal that inspections give incentives to local officials to
interact more with village leaders to familiarize themselves with village development when their
superiors inspect. Curious about local development, inspecting officials tend to ask local villagers,
as well as officials, whether certain projects are being built, if villagers are receiving granted benefits.
Local officials have to make sure they are well-informed of local situations and appear knowledgeable
in front of their superiors. Furthermore, inspections encourage better interactions between village
leaders and local officials, because local officials seek to build trusting relationships with village leaders
and eliminate "negative reports" that could potentially arise to tarnish their superiors' impression of
them and worse, even endanger their entire political career. The most popular question these officials
ask is regarding the welfare of the people. They do express interest in local stability and conflicts
among households as well.
Some of these preemptive actions by local officials can lead to unlawful political detention of
disagreeing villagers. For example, to keep potential complaints in Gaozhaigou Village in northwest
China (even protests) from reaching the arriving provincial Director of Organization Department, Wu
Degang, in 2016, local officials at Huanxian County had started mobilizing public security departments
of the county government to isolate the dissenting peasants (diaomin) in Gaozhaigou Village before
Wu's final arrival.
With high levels of job security and lucrative benefits, official positions in the government are
highly sought. Local officials are unlikely to lay back when their superiors are inspecting localities
under their jurisdiction. While such announced inspections might expose higher authorities to false
information regarding local development, they are still useful in terms of inciting more swift actions
by local governments to get things done.
What is more significant is that the local government actions motivated by impending inspections
tend to last for a considerable period of time. For instance, the same village in Huanxian County that
Sustainability 2018, 10, 1975 4 of 20
the former Premier Wen visited in 2012, Gaozhaigou, has become the focal point for pilot projects that
the Chinese government intends to initiate. It was selected as one of the Pinpointed Poverty-relief (PP)
(jingzhunfupin) villages. Hong Mingyong argues that the PP project and its underpinning doctrine
was first mentioned in Xi's inspection tour to Hunan province in November 2013 and then later
matured into a systematic anti-poverty methodology and ideology [9,10]. The goal of this project is
to make pointed efforts to meet the local needs for development and for poverty relief. These efforts
include concentrated financial and commercial assistance to impoverished areas to facilitate economic
development. The first step in this project is to clearly identify poor households and then employ
individually tailored strategies to improve the well-being of each. As a pioneer in the execution of
this project, Guangdong province has built "poverty" profiles for 367,000 houses in as many as 3407
villages. In addition, the province has budgeted almost 23 billion RMB (about 3.4 US dollars) financial
support and stationed 11,524 government cadres in 3541 groups into villages to keep in direct sight
the process.
The PP project assigns a particular provincial department to minister the given village's
development. The provincial department overseeing Gaozhaogou is the Organization Department
of Gansu Province. The constant arrival of the departmental head, Wu Degang, at Gaozhaogou has
induced a sustained influx of government support grants since 2015. Similarly, the Lankao County,
for which the Party icon, Jiao Yulu, was the former party secretary (1962­1964), is also a pilot district
for the PP project. The Chinese state media, people.com.cn, has pledged multimedia support for
Lankao during this process by setting up a special column to track the progress of the PP project
in that county [11]. Lankao county has been visited by every Chinese president since Deng, for its
former governor, Jiao Yulu, has set a laudable example for the CCP of reaching out to the grassroots
by being among them. Such concentrated, high-profile support from a state media like renminwang is
unprecedented. The site reports an invigorated dynamic of the flourishing economy in Lankao.
Government inspections favor village governance by immediately impacting village leaders
in more personal ways as well. Inspections empower village leaders to properly implement state
policies and offer them essential leverage to settle village disputes. That village leaders usually
accompany higher officials during inspections conveys to villagers the authority's consent and support
of this village leadership. In the Chinese hierarchy, inspections by higher authorities are usually
accompanied by government leaders at lower ranks. For instance, President Xi Jinping's inspection
tours to localities are almost invariably accompanied by provincial leaders of the locality's province,
and municipal leaders of the locality's municipality. The same is true for inspections by every other
level of government. Thus, this framing effect of inspections on village leaders as the legitimate and
recognized government representatives earns village leadership popular obedience. More practically,
village leaders can appeal to inspection officials for bureaucratic and financial assistance to overcome
governing difficulties in their villages. A bureaucratically and financially equipped village leadership
thus enjoys much more efficient village governance.
Government inspections can help provide legitimacy to village leadership in a structural context
where village leaders possess little autonomy from local government, where they usually work
passively under orders from the local government, and where they are deprived of resources and
political clout. Government inspections significantly shift the power balance between village leadership
and local governments. Inspections entail more autonomy for village leaders.
First, in a country where officials in prestigious and powerful positions are usually less available to
the masses, inspections bring to villages the otherwise unreachable and unavailable officials from local
governments so that villagers and village leaders can now appeal their grievances to higher authorities
at more convenience. Inspections are an important channel for village leaders to articulate to higher
authorities the challenges they face in their positions, gaining sympathy both from higher authorities
and from the villagers. Petitioning villagers' grievances to higher authorities, as a result, becomes more
effective where inspections are more frequent, because inspections make high governments available
to them. By contrast, without inspections, making villagers' voices heard by higher authorities
Sustainability 2018, 10, 1975 5 of 20
becomes a more painstaking process. Denied channels of expression, a trivial grievance can spiral
into uncontrollable extrajudicial actions, such as mass protests and even riots. The New York Times
recently reported that a Chinese villager, Jia Jinglong, killed his village leader, He Jianhua, after he
appealed, unsuccessfully to local officials for two years the unwanted demolition of his three-story
house, which led to his fiancée leaving him just a couple days before their wedding. Local officials,
however, were simply not available for him [12]. Many similar cases fuel protests of massive scales.
Government inspection exposes and addresses social grievances in a timely fashion by making higher
authorities available to receive village leaders' input. Good-hearted village leaders usually find it hard
to persuade the local government to address villagers' concerns. In front of inspecting superiors, local
officials are unlikely to remain indifferent to village leaders' appeals.
Second, inspections may significantly alter the power balance between village leaders and local
governments. Inspections interrupt collusion practices between village leaders and local officials
prevalent in rural China. Inspections push village leaders to conduct village affairs in a more
professional fashion according to the guidelines issued by the Party. They are thus more effective
in settling villagers' central concerns. In addition, inspections bring village leaders back on track of
institutionalized politics by releasing them from deference by local officials to whom these village
leaders have to subscribe unwillingly. Even when village leaders have the genuine desire to fulfill their
leadership role and govern democratically with transparency, they are sometimes suppressed by the
local officials to do so. Inspections offers village leaders the courage to work against the wishes of their
immediate superiors, particularly the township and county officials.
There is an established record of higher governments distorting central government policies in
order to raise more taxes for local government expenses [13] (pp. 167, 186). For instance, a significant
portion of social conflicts in China are caused by inappropriate land confiscation. The Beijing News
reports that Sichuan Province alone in the first half of 2016 tried 108 local government officials who
have manipulated compensation policies to underpay affected households during the demolition
of these houses and extort the remaining monies into personal pockets [14]. The arrival of higher
officials provides the immediate victims of these distortions--village leaders and villagers alike--with
essential political cover to speak truth to (even against) local governments. Essentially, bringing
together political actors of all levels, government inspections open a window of "cross-examination"
among these actors, limiting the possibility of any level of authority concealing information, repressing
their subordinates or harboring corruption. Thus, inspections free village leaders from potential
manipulations from higher authorities.
Most Chinese villagers lend more trust to the central government than the local
government [15­18]. Perceiving the central government as a more authentic arbiter of social justice and
pragmatic politics, Chinese villagers believe that inspections conducted by these higher governments
effectively constrain colluding practices between village leaders and local officials. During my field
research, I frequently heard Chinese villagers questioning, "Why don't they (higher authorities) just
inspect them (village leaders and local officials)? The corrupted (local) officials would have been
sent to prison if inspections happen." Chinese villagers generally have the impression that the higher
government is very effective, once it is resolved to accomplishing certain things. "No one can go
against the government at heightened times (of inspections)", as one villager in a village outside
Beijing said in 2004 [19] (p. 119).
While villagers do not necessarily have solid evidence of collusion between local officials and
corporate interests (such as companies), such consensus among villagers across China does tell us that
higher government inspections considerably weaken local corporatism [20,21] and return relevant
parties to political roles they originally belong. China is primarily characterized by a close alliance
between business entrepreneurs and the state. Involvement with the latter (either in party membership
or other forms of engagement) significantly increases the chances for businesses success. This alliance
is similarly prevalent in China's rural areas. Business leaders, as well as village leaders who strive
to get rich, seek to build a reliable (or workable) network with the local government. Local leaders
Sustainability 2018, 10, 1975 6 of 20
should perform their duties in maintaining a judicial and transparent environment for all villages,
while village leaders should only function as mediators between villagers and the higher government
within the lawful, institutional boundaries. For instance, village leaders are not supposed to align with
local officials against another but to play a role of liaison between local government and villagers.
Third, in addition to being available for village leaders to inform on villagers' plight, government
inspections empower village leaders to better govern villages. This is perhaps most pronounced in
competently mediated interest conflicts among villagers. These conflicts may range from interpersonal
disputes to large-scale group violence. My interviews show that, to pick a village leader, local
governments usually consider, among other important things such as personal qualities of fairness and
obedience to local governments, whether the person is able to bring under control village disputes.
While some charismatic village leaders may be able to mediate village conflicts effectively through
personal clout and persuasiveness, I argue that, all else equal, village leaders of more inspected villages
are more capable in conflict mediation than their counterparts in less inspected villages because of
the political support these leaders garner from inspections. The most straightforward causality is that
government inspections, accompanied by village leaders, indirectly signals to villagers the higher
authorities' recognition of the village leadership, thus legitimizing the village leaders among the
villagers. Such power endowment dramatically increases the weight of village leaders' intervention in
village conflicts. Parties to these conflicts are therefore more willing to come to resolutions proposed
by these leaders.
Furthermore, village leaders can more successfully reconcile village conflicts because of the
economic and political leverage afforded by these inspections. For example, financial assistance may
pour into the village collective revenue due to extensive media coverage of a certain high-profile
government inspection. The accumulated financial assets have facilitated development of collective
enterprises in that village. Increased public goods bring out good words from villagers about the
village leadership [22] (p. 859). In addition, placing a large sum of collective revenue in the hands of the
village leaders makes them more important decision makers in village affairs. It is these village leaders
who will decide where the collective wealth will be invested and who will be the primary beneficiaries
of these investments. Thus, villagers who are parties to a conflict are more likely to yield to the "rulings"
of empowered village leaders, because posing oneself as a spoiler in village affairs invites problems in
obtaining favor from village leaders in public goods distribution. One of these public goods provisions
is nominating a limited number of "poor households" (dibaohu) to higher authorities. Using the
decision-making power over which households are to receive government poverty relief grants in a
village as a leverage, village leaders can effectively bring conflicts under control. However, when such
power has been deprived from village leaders by corrupted local officials, village leaders lose such
governing efficacy. Government inspections streamline provision of such poverty relief funds and
these funds further empower village leaders. Even in an event where inspections bring no financial
benefit, village leaders can always enhance their mediation efficacy by exporting these conflict cases to
higher authorities, as inspections make them accessible.
Lastly, inspections turn village leaders into more effective mediators in village conflicts because
inspections increase the chances that village leaders get rich first. During my interviews, most village
leaders have expressed heartfelt remarks that village leaders who lead better lives than the village
average solicit more obedience from villagers. Their opinions on village affairs usually receive the
most positive response if they have managed their personal lives well. By contrast, village leaders who
can barely make a living have little influence over village politics. At the same time, my interviews
also show that, while inspections do not necessarily bring cash into village leaders' pockets, they do
offer a significant information advantage to these leaders to build their business and run a more
successful career. The information advantage refers to the valuable counselling tips and market
updates that inspections bring. Local officials hold strongly the view that the government is in a much
better position in assessing the outside markets and offering insights on the potentials for a village's
development. One village leader told me that one of the benefits of being a village leader, despite their
Sustainability 2018, 10, 1975 7 of 20
extremely low salary [23], is that they enjoy this type of information advantage to get ahead and make
more money.
Critics might argue that the authoritarian, top-down inspections might backfire by suppressing
democratic urges among villagers in China. On the surface, it seems reasonable that, as democratic
practices are more conducive to social order and civilian consent [24­26], they call into question
the utility of government inspections in winning popular support for the Chinese regime. A closer
inspection into the reality in China would reveal a rather different story. First, Chinese government
inspections occur mostly for welfare purposes, at least nominally, intending to improve the livelihood
of local villagers [27]. As a result, local villagers are unlikely to see visits by higher officials as intrusion
into their space of political freedom.
Second, even in villages where democratic elections have matured, these elections are mostly
regarded as "benevolence" from the state [28]. In the season of elections, inspecting officials arrive in
villages not to obstruct the electoral processes, but to administer them according to the Organic Law
of Villagers' Committees (OLVC) promulgated in 1987 [29]. Most of the rural elections were actually
initiated by the central government and imposed top-down [30,31]. Lastly, democratic appeals in rural
China differ quite significantly from those in liberal democracies in the West. Democratic activists
in rural China are more keen to effective means of governance and just ways of distributing public
goods, than to expansion of individual political rights. Villagers cast their votes mostly based upon the
utilitarian reasons of public service [32]. Thus, those in full embrace of democratic practices in China
do not necessarily see themselves at odds with either the inspecting officials or the Chinese regime
in Beijing.
Hypothesis 1. Inspections increase public approval of village leaderships.
3. Materials and Methods
3.1. Qualitative Approach
Field research was conducted in a number of counties on mainland China from 2012 to 2016.
In particular, I visited Huanxian County mentioned in this research for five times during this period,
on average about once per year. Personal involvement in local affairs allows me to obtain first-hand
information on how locals received high-profile government officials, such as the premier, in 2012.
Part of the rationale of choosing this locality for my field research is that Huanxian County has become
the archetypical target for the grand national poverty-relief strategy in China, which, as a result, invited
a large number of government inspections.
I visited the other four counties during my latest field trip in 2016. The address and names
of these counties are not identified in this article for the sake of security. I employed the snowball
sampling approach to reach my interviewees. I first started the field trip from Lanzhou University
of Technology, Lanzhou, China, my undergraduate alma mater, and interviewed students with rural
backgrounds and experience of witnessing inspections. Following this first round of interviews with
22 college students, I asked four of them to tour guide me to their hometowns for a more detailed field
observation. While at their hometowns, I also conducted interviews with one county level government
official, three village leaders and a couple of villagers. As these interviews are conducted against
humans, an Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approval was obtained from the University of North
Texas, US, before the research was carried out.
While the 22 college students may not be the ideal sample in the first place, it is justifiable that their
opinions are valuable and thus offers a first step for conducting the current research. First, though they
are college students who mainly focus their time on school, their daily interactions with their parents
back in their rural hometowns over an extended period of time enable them to construct a holistic view
of how government inspections take their effect on rural governance. Second, Chinese government
inspections have exhibited a considerably stable pattern over the past decades [27] (p. 473). This allows
Sustainability 2018, 10, 1975 8 of 20
college students, though who are nonprofessional scholars, to grasp a reliable understanding of the
utility of government inspections in rural governance. The findings of these field trips are mostly
presented in the above sections of the paper.
3.2. Empirical Approach
Data for empirical analysis in this study is from the Chinese Household Income Project (CHIP)
2002 [33]. This dataset collects information on village governance in 961 randomly selected villages
across China. Included in the dataset is the number of inspections paid to a given village as well as
variables on village leadership. Most importantly, the dataset records public approval rating of the
village leadership by villagers in the year 2002.
The dependent variable for this study is Pub_app, public approval of village leadership. Although
village leaders are composed of two independent persons--the Party Secretary (zhishu) and the
Village Head (cunzhang)--villagers rate their approval of their leaders as one unitary leadership.
Pub_app is thus operationalized as an accumulated score of public ratings of three dimensions of village
leadership: village leaders' willingness to stand up for villagers' interests, village leaders developing
the local economy and village leaders mediating village conflicts.
In the first dimension, villagers express their opinion on village leaders' ability to properly and
resolutely present villagers' causes to higher authorities in cases where there is a conflict of interest
between the government and the villagers. Since village leaders serve as the liaison between the
government and villagers, villagers sometimes worry that their leaders do not faithfully represent their
interests to higher authorities. Instead, villagers are concerned that these leaders might collude with
higher officials to extract more fees and taxes and withhold villagers' government pensions. In each
village of the 961 villages, representatives from the ten randomly selected households within each
village were asked to rate between 0 and 5 how well "the village cadre stands as a spokesman for the
villagers" with 0 as the least and 5 as the most.
This is a salient concern as my fieldwork confirms that there is very limited autonomy for village
leaders from township level officials (the next higher level Chinese government). Villagers display
a significant level of distrust toward village leaders in terms of the latter's willingness to stand up
for their interests, when these interests are at odds with those of the township government. Most of
village leaders' decisions are highly controlled by local governments. All of the village leaders I have
interviewed indicate that their primary goal is not to represent the villagers' interest in bargaining with
the Party, but to govern the villagers on the Party's behalf.
By contrast, the second dimension refers to the capability of village leaders to foster robust
village economies. Village development is an important parameter for both higher authorities and
the villagers to evaluate the village leadership. In each of the 961 villages, representatives from ten
randomly selected households within each village were asked to rate between 0 and 5 how well
"the village cadre makes efforts to help the villagers get rich" with 0 as the lowest rating and 5 as
the highest.
The last dimension captures villagers' opinion on village leaders' efficiency in mediating
conflicting interests among villagers. Being able to effectively settle villager disputes is a very
important, if not the only one, role of village leaders. In each of the 961 villages, representatives
from ten randomly selected households within each village were asked to rate between 0 and 5 how
well "the village cadre mediates the different interests among villagers" with 0 as the lowest rating
and 5 as the highest.
The dependent variable is then generated by adding the rating scores of all three dimensions:
Pub_app = stand + economy + mediation
where stand refers to the dimension of village leaders standing up for villagers' interests, economy is the
degree to which villagers think that their leaders develop the village economy, mediation measures how
Sustainability 2018, 10, 1975 9 of 20
well villagers rate their leaders in terms of the leaders' ability mediate village conflicts. The dataset
records individual scores of each dimension. For the purpose of the current analysis, I aggregate them
into one value. The normal distribution of Pub_app is seen in Figure 1.

The first group of control variables in the model includes three variables measured at the
village level: Income per capita, Democracy and Taxre. Income per capita accounts for the effect that
village economic development has on village leaders' public approval. Village leaders in poorer
villages might strive harder to develop village economy and, as a result, their public approval ratings
rises. Alternatively, rich villages possess more resources to better mediate village conflicts and bring
contentment to villagers, and villagers in richer villages may be more content than their counterparts
in less developed villages are. Leaders in villages holding democratic elections arrive at their positions
through contested elections. Electoral politics push village leaders in these elected positions to be more
transparent and responsive. Thus, I expect Democracy to have a positive effect on the outcome variable.
I expect to see higher public approval for the elected village leadership than for a non-elected one.
Finally, Taxre is also included to control for the potential alienation that the tax reform launched in
2002 has caused between the Chinese government and village leaders. Juan Wang finds that structural
fiscal reform has made the Chinese government lose village leaders to the villagers' side and these
village leaders then become key organizers of protests [34]. The distribution of these control variables
can be found in Table 1.
Besides village-level controls, I also include idiosyncratic characteristics of both the Party Secretary
and the Village Head: Age, Education, Exp_mgmt, Exp_busi, Time in office, Salary. The same as its
counterparts at higher levels, the village government is also a dual Party-government system with
each village government headed by a Party secretary and a village head. Village leaders' personal
profile matters for their diligence in office and thereafter their public approval. Younger village
leaders may be more active in their service, simply because they are more energetic and ambitious.
However, age may also be a bonus to village leaders in terms of governing efficacy, as older village
leaders may wield more influence by seniority in village politics and their experience may make them
more effective in their job. Thus older village leaders might enjoy higher public approval. They can
be particularly more effective in standing up for villagers' interests, mediating village disputes, and
mobilizing resources for economic development. Education may play a significant part in the leaders'
ability to better articulate complicated situations to their superiors and fellow villagers. Education also
endows village leaders with needed temperaments to foster opportunities for commercial activities in
villages. Education helps village leaders find creative ways to develop the economy and to abide by
law in policy implementation.
Village leaders' experience in management in a company (Exp_mgmt) or in running a small
business (Exp_busi) may increase the odds of an effective village leadership. Experience in management
positions or businesses teaches village leaders to strategically deploy limited resources to achieve
maximum utility for village governance. Perhaps more importantly, such experience helps village
leaders build connections that can later help him/her develop the village economy. Thus, I expect these
two control variables to have a strong impact on the leaders' public approval. Likewise, village leaders'
time in office may also determine how effective they are managing village affairs. Lastly, village
leaders' salary is another important factor in village leadership. Better paid village leaders are freed
from concerns of taking second jobs to make a living. They can instead be more focused on village
affairs. Public approval, as a result, may increase as village leaders devote more time and energy to
village governance.
4. Results
4.1. Model 1
The unit of analysis of this chapter is the village leadership in each village. The number of
observations is 794. The village leadership refer to both the village Party secretary and village
governor. Given the normal and continuous distribution of the outcome variable, I perform ordinary
least squares (OLS) regression. Results of this analysis (in Table 2) show that Chinese government
inspections have a positive and statistically significant (p < 0.01) effect on the dependent variable,
Sustainability 2018, 10, 1975 11 of 20
Pub_app, across the four models. This implies that inspections significantly increase village leaders'
public approval. As inspections increase to a village, its leaders enjoy rising public approval among
villagers. Substantively, as the frequency of inspections increases from once a year to fifty times a year,
the largest value in the dataset, the public approval score of village leaders in this given village is
predicted to increase from 7.35 to 10. 27, all else equal (in Figure 2).

The surprising finding is that, as inspections increase in a village, village leaders are more likely
to stand up for the interest of the villagers in the case where villagers' interest conflict with that of
the Party. Intuitively, when the Party's interests are at stake, the inspecting officials should pressure
the village leaders to lean toward the Party, not the opposite. This finding, however, suggests that
inspections, with its publicity and influence, release village leaders from local interest groups where
village leaders might be enticed by local officials to engage in corruption, or willingly collude with the
township officials to extract benefits due the villagers. Such release encourages village leaders to go
public and speak for the interests of the villagers. This lends evidence to the argument that village
leaders obtain more autonomy upon arrival of higher officials. Granted opportunities to be speak
candidly to the higher officials about local grievances, village leaders can now take villagers' chief
concerns to the right personnel.
In addition, a few control variables have also achieved statistical significance in the models.
In particular, Income per capita has obtained statistical significance (p < 0.01) in the first model which
only includes controls for attributes of the village: its economic development, democratic elections
and tax reform. It loses significance, however, when control variables of the characteristics of the
Party Secretary are included. It, however, regained significance in the third (p < 0.5) and fourth model
(p < 0.1). Economic development in the village appears to be important in weathering villagers' public
opinion on the governing efficacy of the village leadership. As a village becomes richer, the village
leadership tends to enjoy a better evaluation from fellow villagers. Substantively, holding all other
variables at their mean, as income per capita of a village increases from 1000 RMB (about $147) to
15,000 RMB (about $2205), public approval score of the village leadership increases from 7.32 to 8.9.
This makes sense when village leaders, with a considerable amount of resources at their disposal, can
make more decisive (and most popular) decisions to better the living conditions of the village. During
my fieldwork in China, some village leaders complained that there is little they can do to alleviate the
despair in their village and that the poverty has provided the village leadership with little leverage in
village politics. Whether a village has held democratic elections does not have any effect on the village
leadership's public approval, a sign of low efficacy of these elections.
The Wald test (Prob > F = 0.0039), giving the comparative weight that each explanatory variable
carries relative to others, shows that the core independent variable, Insp, outperforms all the other
explanatory variables combined. This indicates the disproportionate significance that this variable of
interest carries in the analysis.
Sustainability 2018, 10, 1975 13 of 20
Age of the Party secretary and age of the village head have markedly different effects on the
outcome variables remains the same in this model. While the age of the village leader has a positive,
statistically significant effect on all of the outcome variables, the age of the Party secretary achieves
no statistical significance and is in the negative direction. The older a village head is, the higher the
approval rating the village leadership as a whole receives, all else equal. The positive effect that village
leaders' experience in business and management positions have on public approval of the village
leadership is particularly evident in the case of the Party secretary. It, however, is significantly weaker
in the case of the village head.
The above comparison between the control variables of characteristics of the Party secretary and
the village head thus reveals that, while business expertise of the Party secretary are much more
effective in raising public approval of the leadership, seniority of the village head is more significant
in shaping villagers' views of the leadership. In other words, villagers tend to judge the two village
leaders differently in terms of their contribution to the village leadership. Professional credentials of
the party secretary, such as experience in businesses, are more appealing to villagers while seniority of
the village head appears to be more effective in gaining consent from villagers. This finding reflects
the discrepancies in villagers' perceptual evaluation of the village leadership. Villagers tend to view an
older village head plus an experienced party secretary as the most competent partnership in the village
leadership. Thus, to select a village leadership that wins the most ruling legitimacy, the CCP should
appoint a party secretary who is well-educated and experienced in management and businesses,
while helping someone who is older and highly respected in the village get elected as village head.
I am aware of the potential selection bias involved in this analysis. Selection bias refers to the
possibility that the Chinese government selectively inspect villages that exhibit higher public approval.
If such bias exists, the causal relationship that this analysis identifies could be compromised or even
turned to the opposite direction: instead of inspections causing improved public approval, it could be
that public approval determines where inspection occurs in the first place. I argue that this selection
bias is unlikely because the data used in this analysis captures a significant time lag between inspections
and public approval ratings. The independent variable, Insp, is the number of inspections conducted
per year during the past three year (1998­2002), while public approval ratings were polled at the
time when the survey was conducted, at the end of 2002. Operation of inspections and collection of
approval ratings did not happen contemporaneously. As such, this analysis lends convincing evidence
to the causal relationship elaborated in the theory section.
Second, even without such time lag between the explanatory variable and the dependent variable,
there are few reasons to believe that such selection bias, if any, would challenge the current results.
The authoritarian governance under the CCP demands uniform allegiance from all administrative
units to support, at least nominally, the regime's rule. The CCP does not have to avoid "negative
villages" to only inspect those in favor of the party. My field research shows that there is a significant
level of regime support across villages, especially taking into account the waiver of agricultural taxes
since 2004 [35] and the marked lift of livelihood among the general population. The most likely
calculation that the CCP makes in deciding whether to inspect villages supportive or unsupportive of
the regime is determined by how the Party strives to ensure its survival. It is unlikely to shun away
from areas of trouble. The CCP would most likely prioritize inspections to problematic, not peaceful
or supportive, villages to ensure social stability.
4.2. Model 2
In order to parcel out the effects that government inspections have on each dimension of the
village leadership (stand up for villagers' interest, economic development and mediation) and, at the
same time, take into account the individual-level characteristics of villagers (Gender, Age, Married,
Party_Mem, Minority, Edu and Migrant), I perform a hierarchical model, Ordered Logit regression
analysis clustered at the village level. The unit of analysis is individual villager and the number of
observations is 7093. An Ordinal Logit model is more appropriate for this analysis, as opposed to
Sustainability 2018, 10, 1975 14 of 20
the OLS model in the previous examination, because the dependent variables are all ordinal, discrete
values from 1 to 5. In conducting the analysis, I also cluster by village to account for the bias caused by
village-level control variables (control of villagers, village leaders and villages) in the model.
The core independent variable, Insp, achieves strong statistical significance (p < 0.01) in the
three models with breakdown of Pub_app into its specific three dimensions and with controls of
idiosyncratic characteristics of villagers (see Table 3). Insp continues to have a consistent positive
and statistically significant effect on all the dependent variables, implying that, as the number of
government inspections to a village per year increases, villagers' rating of his village leader significantly
improves. Government inspections significantly improve villagers' opinion on their leaders' governing
efficacy in all three aspects: petitioning their causes to higher governments, developing village economy
and lastly effectively mediating village conflicts.
The substantive effects inspections have on public approval rating in its three subcategories
appear in Figure 3. Inspections impact public approval of the village leadership in very similar ways:
they help boost the public approval score of village leadership in terms of standing up for peasants'
interests, developing the village economy and mediating village conflicts. However, the effect on
public approval of village leaders developing the economy is the strongest among the three (the slope
is the steepest in the last chart in Figure 3). This makes intuitive sense because economic development
in the village tends to be the most visible achievement, as peasants' annual income rises and better
infrastructure is being built. This, as a result, can be picked up by villagers more easily than the other
two areas of village leadership. The effect that inspections have on the ratings of village leaders' ability
in mediating village conflicts and standing up for villagers' interests are almost identical (the slopes
are almost the same for both graphs).

breakdown of public approval of the village leadership with controls for individual characteristics

Figure 3. Predicted probability of village leadership receiving the least approval (Pr[Outcome
Variable = -5]).
Some of the control variables in this robustness check have significant impacts on the outcome
variables. Economic development continues to exert a positive, statistically significant impact on all
three dimensions, confirming my assumption that the economy does matter for the public image of
the village leadership and the CCP as a whole. Neither democratic elections nor tax reform plays a
significant part in the outcome variable.
Both the Party secretary and the village head's time in office proves to be a critical factor in
winning public approval. The longer they have been in their positions, the higher approval ratings
they are likely to receive from fellow villagers, all else equal. This could be a function of the leaders'
familiarity with village affairs: as they serve in office longer, they gain more experience in helping
peasants obtain the proper government assistance and fostering relationships among villagers.
Education of the Party secretary positively contributes to public approval rating in the areas of
developing the economy and mediating village conflicts. Education of the village head, by contrast,
does not have any effect on any of the outcome variables.
Lastly, evaluation of the village leadership does not vary significantly over individual
characteristics of the villagers. How a given villager rates the village leadership is not dependent
upon his gender, age, marital status, education or migrant status. This shows the lack of
individualism in Chinese political culture in general and rural political culture in particular. Peasants
usually do not form individually unique political beliefs or conviction. Their perspectives on the

form individually unique political beliefs or conviction. Their perspectives on the village leadership
are apt to reflect more a communal and general opinion than an individual one. However, a few
individual characteristics stand out as significant factors on public approval of the village leadership.
The most impressive control is party membership. A villager who is a CCP member views the village
leadership much more positively than one who does not belong to the CCP. This is an expected result
taking into account the entrenched influence of the CCP in rural areas of China and the conformity of
political views that the CCP demands unconditionally from its members.
In addition, minority villagers tend to view the village leadership as more willing to stand up for
their interests and develop the village economy, but not necessarily to mediate village conflicts.
Sustainability 2018, 10, 1975 17 of 20
Aware of its multiethnic population and sensitive to the potential ethnic conflicts in its society,
the Chinese government has adopted favorable policies to minority groups. As a result, the village
leaders may as well act accordingly to be especially accommodative to minority groups. While villagers
who have worked outside the village (Migrant) are indifferent toward the village leadership's capability
to stand up for villagers' interests and its ability to mediate village conflicts, they tend to view the
village leadership's performance in economic development more negatively than those who do not
have migrant work experience. Having seen the extraordinary economic development in urban cities,
returning villagers understandably disregard the minimal economic development that their village
might have gained.
5. Discussion
This study discusses a unique feature of rural governance in China--government inspections.
Via painstaking administrative assignments of official visits to localities, the regime in China manages
to connect the extensive official hierarchy to the common masses. Chinese government inspections
stand out among other authoritarian states in that they have provided the authorities with essential
pathways to build close and concrete relationships with the grassroots. As a result, these administrative
endeavors ultimately pay off when the CCP is to reap public support from the very people whom it
has elevated out of poverty and protected from social instability.
Both fieldwork and empirical analysis lend strong evidence to the theoretical framework of this
study. Chinese government inspections, despite their systematic flaws and occasional superficiality,
play an important role in Chinese politics. Diligently touring rural regions of China serves the CCP
strategic political interest, as these inspections constantly strengthen the Party's local foundation and
refresh the positive image that the Party has endeavored to construct from its inception. This study
argues that Chinese government inspections effectively boost the ruling legitimacy of the Chinese
regime. Public approval of village leadership significantly increases as inspections to this village
increase, while controlling for other important interfering variables. The institutionalized practice
of government inspections in China thus serves as a critical means for sustainable governance in
rural China.
Inspections boost the Chinese regime's ruling legitimacy chiefly by drawing local officials,
who may otherwise be far removed from the grassroots, into personal contacts with both villagers
and village leaders. Making these officials available to hear appeals from the grassroots alleviate
strains between the Party and the people. Effective communication between them not only helps
resolve the forthcoming disputes and confusions but also enhances the emotional affinity that the
Chinese peasants accords to the CCP's contribution to the current Chinese state. Moreover, this causal
relationship between inspections and improved ruling legitimacy of the CCP exists because inspections
alter the power balance between village leaders and local officials, allowing the village leaders to speak
boldly to (sometimes against) the inspecting higher officials. Village leaders can now, with less fear of
repression from local officials, take grassroots petitions more conveniently and successfully to the right
authorities. Inspections also empower village leaders with financial and political leverage to govern
village affairs more judiciously and efficiently.
The distinctive cultural values in China provide a helpful context to understand this salient effect
that inspections have on the CCP's approval. China's cultural values are primarily characterized
by obedience to a hierarchical order prescribed by an "unequal distribution of power", according
to Shalom Schwartz's conception of values [36] (p. 156). This stands in sharp contrast to the more
autonomous and self-expressive cultures most typically represented by the English-speaking world.
In addition, according to Ronald Inglehart's research, despite a fairly low freedom house rating from
1972 through 1997, China obtained a relatively high score on subjective well-being [37] (p. 227),
sitting itself close to South Korea, Spain, and France.
This indicates that, in the contemporary era, the Chinese bid their well-being of happiness more on
improved economic development and better living conditions than political freedom and democratic
Sustainability 2018, 10, 1975 18 of 20
politics. Villagers in China, who are more leaning toward honoring the authorities and feeling indebted
to what the CCP accomplishes for the common masses [38], are more likely to give support to the
Chinese regime once in-person visits by high-ranking officials increase.
One of the weaknesses of this research is that the dependent variable is public approval for village
leadership, not support for the Chinese regime as a whole. Due to limited data, the current study can
only inform us what effect government inspections have upon villagers' views of their village leaders.
Future research, therefore, can delve deeper into the relationship between villagers' support for village
leadership and their support for the CCP. Despite the hypothetical correlation between these two
variables, it is interesting to show how immediate approval of the most grassroots government cadres
eventually leads to general support for the regime.
Future research can further tap into how the levels of inspecting officials matter in impacting
ruling legitimacy. The weight that an inspection by Xi Jinping carries is perhaps much higher than does
an inspection conducted by a lower county-level official. More research is also needed in articulating
the generalizability of inspection practices in other similar regimes. How can other regimes, such as the
Philippines, also learn from Chinese government inspections to institute more regime accountability
and responsiveness? Scholars can look at how contacts with legislators affect constituents' rating of
the regime. Lastly, scholars might conduct comparative analysis between authoritarian governance
characterized with top-down government interventions and democratic governance where bottom-up
elections are more prevalent.
The policy implications for the CCP are mainly that the Party should undertake inspection tours
as many as possible to achieve maximum utility. Given the heavy cost of inspections, the Party has to
increase the number of inspections, but at the same time keep it below the threshold beyond which
their cost outweighs the benefits. It remains another empirical question where this threshold lies.
Another important advice for the regime is to pay attention to the make-up of the village leadership.
A party secretary who is educated and experienced in business plus a village head who is older and
well-respected would make the most promising village leadership. Coopting peasants into the party
still remains important as peasants who are party members view the village leadership more positively
than those who are not.
