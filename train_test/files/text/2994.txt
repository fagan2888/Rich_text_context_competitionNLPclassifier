Gender and race differences in the predictors of daily
health practices among older adults
Mary P. Gallant and Gail P. Dorn
Abstract results indicate that examining older adults'
health behaviors by race and gender leads to a
fuller understanding of these behaviors.
Preventive health behaviors are crucial for older
adults' well-being. This study examined the
