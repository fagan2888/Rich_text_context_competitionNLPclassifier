Introduction
The increase in population has created a demand for the
development that has led to speedy urbanization and caused
damages to surrounding areas. The catastrophe created by
these construction projects enormously affected the environ-
ment through, for example, the waste production and green-
house gas (GHG) emission. These issues have garnered much
attention among researchers, professionals, and practitioners
in the construction sector because they are against the funda-
mental concept of sustainable development, which focuses on
balance between environmental, social, and economic ele-
ments. Most authors noted that the production of building
materials has contributed to the environmental catastrophe
(Gupta & Kumar, 2010; Lehmann, 2013; Yuan, 2013), a por-
tion of this originates from wood usage and cement produc-
tion. Yeheyis, Hewage, Alam, Eskicioglu, and Sadiq (2012)
stated that wood had become major element of construction
waste in Canada. In Australia, an estimated 20% to 30% of
construction waste is added to landfills (Craven, Okraglik, &
Eilenberg, 1994). Turkey produces nearly 38 million tons of
waste (Ozturk, 2005) and approximately 180 million tons of
waste is generated in European countries (Vefago & Jaume,
2013).
In Malaysia, a similar situation has occurred. For exam-
ple, the construction site in Batu Pahat, Johor, contributed
50% of the wood waste in 2011 (Nagapan, Ismail, Asmi, &
Adnan, 2013). Furthermore, Lachimpadi, Pereira, Taha, and
Mokhtar (2012) noted that timber elements represented the
highest sources of construction waste from two of eight con-
struction sites in Klang Valley, Kuala Lumpur. Wood has
become a major choice in conventional construction due to
its function as the structural support in buildings. However,
due to the phenomenon of rotting, wood cannot be used
repeatedly and usually ends in a landfill. The Malaysian con-
struction industry released nearly 32.2% of CO

The Green Manufacturer's Compliance
With Green Criteria Throughout the Life
Cycle of Building Material

Abstract
The construction industry has significant impacts on the environment. Abound the efforts to induce a greater green
implementation in the construction project, it has been argued that the usage of green building materials in construction
projects can help to minimize the production of waste and greenhouse gas (GHG) emission. This article's objective is
to identify the degree of compliance with the green building materials criteria by wood and cement manufacturers. The
green building materials criteria were conceptualized as part of the sustainability movement in which the term green is
used to refer to a clean environment and unpolluted atmosphere. To verify the compliance of the manufacturers through
the green building materials criteria, a questionnaire survey supported by an interview was conducted. The results show
that most Malaysian green manufacturers complied with the green criteria, which converged all three principles including
environmental impact, resource management, and recycling implementation. This article provides a basis upon which existing
and new manufacturers can produce green building materials thoroughly in accordance with the listed criteria. Clearly,
the manufacturers' compliance with the green building materials criteria has several impacts on the development of the
construction industry such that a green building material production process will stimulate a balanced ecosystem and prevent
an environmental catastrophe.

2010, a portion of this originates from the cement production
process (International Energy Agency [IEA], 2012).
These situations have triggered governments around the
world to implement green development in construction proj-
ects. Simcoe and Toffel (2014) discussed government efforts
in implementing the green movement in which government
procurement affects the private sector demand. Utilizing the
U.S. Green Building Council's Leadership in Energy and
Environmental Design (LEED) standard in green building is
one effort that has been introduced. The Green Public
Procurement (GPP) establishment in various countries such
as Denmark, Germany, and Sweden derives environmental
benefits and stimulates the demand for green products (Testa,
Annunziata, Iraldo, & Frey, 2016). In the research conducted
by Zhang, Wu, and Shen (2015), several efforts by govern-
ments have been identified, for example, Building Research
Establishment Environmental Performance Assessment
(BREEAM) in the United Kingdom, Green Building
Challenge in the United States, and Hong Kong Building
Environment Assessment Method (HK-BEAM) in Hong
Kong.
Furthermore, one means of addressing the problem is
through the usage of green building materials in construction
projects. It has a very clear and significant impact of the
amount of waste produced with the development of the con-
struction industry. Understanding from the building materi-
als production stage will minimize the aftereffect from cradle
to grave and yet derogate the amount of waste produced.
Many approaches have been made by the government such
as introducing the 3R program (Agamuthu, Santha, Fauziah,
& Dennis, 2011), enacting a green policy (Ahmad Fariz,
2010), and executing the eco-labeling standard (Ahmad
Fariz, 2010) as a medium for green certification of the prod-
uct. In addition, the Malaysian government has enforced the
utilization of green construction approaches in government
projects such as energy consumption initiatives in public and
industrial buildings (Kristensen, Khalid, & Tang, 2005).
As the green movement is still considered to be in its early
phase (Papargyropoulou, Padfield, Harrison, & Preece,
2012), the Ministry of Energy, Green Technology and Water
(KeTTHA) has been mandated to execute and enforce green
practices in the country. The ministry has collaborated with a
few organizations such as the Malaysian Green Technology
Corporation (MGTC), Malaysian Green Building Council
(MGBC), and Scientific and Industrial Research Institute of
Malaysia (SIRIM) Berhad in fostering the green movement;
this has led to the establishment of the National Green
Technology Policy (NGTP) and to carbon footprint labeling
(SIRIM LCA Team, 2013). It was important for the produc-
tion of green building materials to be endorsed by green cer-
tificates. Green certificates are the important element that
differentiates between a self-claimed product and a product
that undergoes a bona fide green process.
Although these efforts and approaches have been intro-
duced by the government, the problem of environmental
degradation remains. Implicitly, the problem is due to the
production of building materials themselves, in particular,
wood and cement-based products, which do not comply with
the green building materials criteria. Green building materi-
als production is the first step in the green building produc-
tion cycle. Wood and cement feature several criteria
associated with the environmental spectrum such as recycled
content, natural resources, energy efficiency, and renewable
resources (Kim & Rigdon, 1998; Spiegel & Meadows, 2010).
Certain manufacturers have claimed that they produced
green products; however, compliance with the green build-
ing materials criteria is in doubt. Because the spectrum of
environmental protection had been widely spread, manufac-
turers must be well-prepared and organized to cling to this
industry (Lee, Kang, Hsu, & Hung, 2009). However, in
catering to the demand in a construction project or of the cap-
tive users, the manufacturers compete in producing greener
building materials without stressing the important parame-
ters in green building materials criteria.
Most studies focus more on building material assessment
(Ali & Al Nsairat, 2009), the impact of building materials on
the environment (Woolley, Kimmins, Harrison, & Harrison,
2002), the life cycle of building materials (Saiz, Kennedy,
Bass, & Pressnail, 2006), green building materials selection
(Akadiri & Olomolaiye, 2012; Castro-Lacouture, Sefair,
Flórez, & Medaglia, 2009), and barriers to green building
materials implementation (Hoffman & Henn, 2008). Previous
studies have also addressed the green building materials
assessment (Li, Wang, Wang, & Zhang, 2012), rating system,
implementation in building, impact on environmental assess-
ments (Cheng, Lin, & Hsu, 2015; Gall, Darling, Siegel,
Morrison, & Corsi, 2013), innovation (Chang, Huang, Wu,
& Chang, 2015; Chen, Wang, & Jhou, 2013), and compari-
son with conventional building materials (Cheng et al.,
2015). Identifying the degree of manufacturer's compliance
with the green building materials criteria has not yet occurred.
Although studies on green building materials have been
rigorously conducted, the issues on environmental problems
such as pollution, GHG emission, and improper waste man-
agement still persist. Thus, this article aimed to identify the
compliance degree of the green manufacturers of wood and
cement-based products with the green building materials cri-
teria. Because the production of green building materials is
the utmost important step leading to green building forma-
tion, assessing the fundamental criteria compliance by the
green manufacturers helps to stimulate the green construc-
tion industry and a greener environment and helps to foster
the green building materials production. Practically, this
research helps the stakeholders in the construction industry
to select the right green building materials, assists the user in
buying high quality green building materials, and triggers a
better manufacturing process. Understanding the fundamen-
tals of green building materials production in theory may
lead to innovative research and development (R&D) activi-
ties in the manufacturing industry as well.

The first section of this article discusses the research
objectives, followed by the criteria and principles of green
building materials based on the literature and government
procurement. The third section delineates the life cycle of
building materials. Next, the methodology is discussed,
which consists of the data collection and the analysis
involved. The last section elaborates on the findings, which
then answer the research question raised earlier.
Research Objectives
Green building materials had drawn an attention among the
construction industry players such as developers, contrac-
tors, and manufacturers. In producing a truly green building
materials, the manufacturers should consider several param-
eters theoretically and practically. Each stage in the life cyle
of the building material starting from extraction of raw
material until the waste disposal, should follow standard-
ized procedures to call it as green building material.
However, the compliance of the buiding materials with the
green principles and criteria through each of production
itself specifically focusing on wood and cement-based prod-
ucts have not yet been discovered. Previous researches have
focused on the life cycle issues such as the impact of build-
ing materials production on the environment (Esin, 2007)
and the implementation of 3Rs concept in demolition pro-
cess (Sabai, Egmond, Cox, Mato, & Lichtenberg, 2009). In
Malaysia, the assessment tools have been provided to recog-
nize the material and yet the growth of green building mate-
rials was still low. The SIRIM Eco-Label certification only
used to verify the materials as an environmental friendly
products. Thus, this will lead to the question of whether the
manufacturers comply with the green principles and criteria
in the process of producing green building material. Hence,
this article's objective is to identify the degree of compli-
ance with the green building materials criteria by wood and
cement manufacturers.
Criteria and Principles of Green
Building Material
Green building materials are sustained by its name and veri-
fied by eco-labeling certification; in addition, the green build-
ing materials production process should follow the right
criteria to ensure that the material is genuinely produced in
accordance with the green process. Certain scholars noted that
green building materials originate from the green manufac-
turer concerned with the green practices implemented by their
management (Deif, 2011). The green practices in the company
and the production of green building materials are interrelated
because the green manufacturers apply practices such as the
elimination of sources of waste and the reduction of energy
consumption (Deif, 2011). These manufacturers should also
similarly implement green practices when producing the green
building materials product. The green manufacturer that
executes the concept of green in its company is more sensitive
to the elements and criteria used in making their products. To
certify the building material as green, the green manufacturer
is obliged to follow certain criteria that relate to nature and
human health. In Malaysia, green manufacturing companies
need to follow the criteria noted in the NGTP and the SIRIM
eco-label standard to produce green products. However, before
moving to the practical compliance, it is important to examine
the criteria noted in the theory used as the baseline for all
requirements.
For deeper understanding, the term green building crite-
ria is defined holistically by various scholars. U.S. Green
Building Council defined green building criteria as counter-
measure of making the building sustain toward the environ-
mental changes and human health effect (Kriss, 2014). The
authors mentioned that to identify the green criteria of the
building, a few parameters should be considered such as
energy usage, indoor environmental quality, material, and
selection. On the contrary, Olanipekun, Xia, and Nguyen
(2017) compiled the term green building as product of a min-
imum environmental footprint, clean, and resource-efficient
measures in the whole life cycle of the building with regard
to balance ecosystem and users' well-being. In addition,
Steinemann, Wargocki, and Rismanchi (2017) mentioned
that the current trend of defining the green buildings is
through the green building certification such as Building
Research Establishment Environmental Assessment
Methodology (BREEAM) and LEED. In Malaysia, Green
Building Index (GBI) is implemented to define and catego-
rize the green buildings. In Malaysian context, green build-
ing focused on resource efficiency in terms of energy, water,
and materials and reducing building impact on human health
and environment during building's life cycle (GBI, 2017). In
general, green building is defined universally, in which the
main concern is to promote sustainability of available
resources through an efficient management of the present
and aftereffect of the building to the environment and
people.
Previous scholars (Kim & Rigdon, 1998; Kubba, 2010)
listed several criteria to be used to evaluate green building
material (GBM). The green criteria possessed several simi-
larities although certain scholars have added a few more cri-
teria. Table 1 shows that certain scholars agreed that local
materials are part of the important criteria to clarify the prod-
uct as a green. Kim and Rigdon (1998) noted that using local
materials could reduce the energy consumption used in trans-
portation and minimize the GHG emissions. For instance,
the utilization of local materials requires fewer transporta-
tion processes because it involves short distance transfers.
Using local materials could also minimize the effort of
importing the material, and this supports the economic
growth of local trade. Other green criteria noted by previous
authors are depicted in Table 1.
For the purpose of this study, classification of the criteria
into principles is necessary because some manufacturers
4 SAGE Open
listed the major criteria and some listed the subcriteria.
Examining the definition of the principle, Blengini and Carlo
(2010) defined it as a guideline used to provide a general
view on one issue. Thus, if one interprets the criteria as prin-
ciples, one may view the green building materials criteria as
a general perspective. The criteria listed by the scholars as
shown in Table 1 were regrouped into three major principles,
which are as follows: (a) environmental impact (P1), (b)
resource management (P2), and (c) 3R implementation (P3).
These principles were developed by researchers based on
the definition of each criterion that matches the principle.
For example, the natural resources criterion is one of the
resource management activities (Holling & Meffe, 1996);
thus, this criterion is classed into P2. The combination of the
green criteria with the green principles provides a strong
foundation for green building materials. The principles and
criteria used to evaluate the green building materials during
the production process are shown in Table 2.
Furthermore, the government of Malaysia gazettes the
green policy to enhance the usage of green technology and
accelerate the production of green product in the country.
The NGTP is viewed as an economic booster, which at the
same time is conducive to sustainable development (Roslina,
2012). In 2014, the usage of green technology contributed
RM5 billion to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP), and it is
expected to achieve RM70 billion by 2030 (MStar, 2014).
The NGTP, established in 2009, aligns with the establish-
ment of the KeTTHA, which is responsible for green enforce-
ment in Malaysia. KeTTHA has collaborated with the green
authority within the country to ensure that green practices are
well implemented and aligned with the goal and objectives
of the NGTP. SIRIM Berhad was part of the green authority
responsible for the verification of green products. There are
37 criteria documents used to evaluate green products. Table
3 shows an example of the criteria in the SIRIM eco-label
standard documentation used by the SIRIM authority to
evaluate wood and cement-based product. From the criteria
noted in Table 3, much emphasis has been placed on carbon
release during the production process. The production of
building material emits certain quantities of chemicals and
gasses such as carbon monoxide, sulfur oxide, and nitrogen
oxide (Safiuddin, Mohd Zamin, Salam, Islam, & Hashim,
2010). The emission of gasses should be in accordance with
the Environmental QualityAct (EQA; 1974). Verifying green
products with green certificates could possibly help reduce
the quantity of carbon emission released into the atmosphere.
The emphasis on the issues of carbon release shows that the
government of Malaysia considers the reduction of the
energy consumption by the manufacturing industry, which
currently depends on the usage of fossil fuel, to be a serious
concern.
Life Cycle of Building Material
The overall impact on the environment is significantly
related to the life cycle of a building material. Many
approaches raised by previous scholars are related to reduc-
ing the impact. Some of the initiatives involve using techni-
cal tools such as life cycle assessment (LCA) tools, which
take into account the energy used, material consumption, and
waste production during the production process, to measure
the impact on the environment (Curran, 1996). Mungcharoen,
Sridowtong, and Saibuatrong (2010) proved that the use of

recycled material as a substitute in the product makes it more
sustainable than using virgin material. Huntzinger and
Eatmon (2009) evaluated the impact of the life cycle process
of four types of cement product and found that the use of
natural pozzolans such as rice husk in the cement production
reduces the GHG emissions and minimizes the environmen-
tal impact. There were also other studies that used other tech-
nical method such as relative index (RI) analysis (Akadiri &
Olomolaiye, 2012) and genetic algorithm (GA) analysis
(Zhou, Yin, & Hu, 2009) to discover the optimum criteria for
selecting sustainable material.
The selection of raw material is a very crucial step in
which the raw material selection involves a complex process
thatleadstohighintensityenergyusetoproduceit(Amponsah,
Lacarriere, Jamali-Zghal, Le, & Corre, 2012). The impact
from the product could be minimized if the main focus is con-
sidered during the material selection. Thus, the center point
has looked at the life cycle of building material. The life cycle
process was adopted from the studies done by Kim and
Rigdon (1998) and Ortiz, Castells, and Sonnemann (2009),
where the green criteria is incorporated into each stage of the
life cycle process. Figure 1 shows that the life cycle is divided
into three phases known as the (a) pre-use phase, (b) use
phase, and (c) post-use phase. The pre-use phase is dominant
in the environmental damages (Kim & Rigdon, 1998). This is
the phase where many impacts could affect the environment
in a serious way. Examining the early phases of the life cycle
process will ensure that the building material is produced in
an environmentally benign manner. Although the impact may

not be zero, compliance with the green requirement helps
reduce the energy consumption and minimize the wastage
during the production process. The 3R (recycle, reduce, and
reuse) elements operate in the closed-loop cycle, which will
help to reduce production waste (Sassi, 2008) and to hinder
the exploitation of natural sources. The compliance with the
green criteria and appliance of the 3R element to the life cycle
process cause less stress on the environment and reduce the
impact on human health.
Method
The census population that represents the entire population
was used because there are a limited number of manufac-
turing companies in Malaysia that produce green building
materials. The survey technique and the interview approach
were used to obtain data from the Malaysian top manage-
ment of green manufacturing companies that specialize in
wood and cement-based product. The data from these two
sources help to strengthen the findings and provide better
understanding on the particular topic. A total of 72 respon-
dents were selected, and 21 completed the survey form;
furthermore, five companies were involved in the semis-
tructured interview session, which is shown in Table 4.
Despite the small number of respondents, the survey ques-
tionnaire used has a reliable measure of Cronbach's alpha
with an average of 0.6-0.9; it is supported by the exper-
tise endorsement.
The questionnaires were distributed to the respondents
directly one-to-one and collected after they had answered all
the questions. As for the interview, the respondents were
called through mail or direct call and were asked for their
permission to undergo an interview. The questionnaire was
divided into two main sections: Part A and Part B. Part A
covers the information on the green manufacturer company
and consists of three subsections: (a) background of the com-
pany, (b) management of the company, and (c) barriers faced
by the green manufacturer. In Part B, the manufacturers were
asked their opinion on the principles of green building mate-
rials. Meanwhile, for the interview, the questions were
divided into two sections: The first section represented the
functions of the authorities and second section consisted of
questions on the criteria of green building material develop-
ment. An example of the questionnaires and interview ques-
tions and answers is shown in the next section.
The Likert-scale type, with ratings from 0 (not at all) to
5 (very high), was utilized to ascertain the greatest and the
least compliance with green criteria applied by the green
manufacturer during the production process. Several tech-
niques were used to evaluate the survey data; these were
an SPSS statistical analysis package, matrix data analysis,
and percentage compliance. The survey data were first
analyzed based on the mean value score. The rank mean
score was adapted from the study conducted by Alston and
Miller (2002) and rearranged to be suitable for this study:
(a) 0-1.00 = not implemented at all, (b) 1.00-1.49 = very
low implementation, (c) 1.50-2.49 = low implementation,
(d) 2.5-3.49 = medium implementation, (e) 3.5-4.49 =
high implementation, and (f) 4.5-5.00 = very high imple-
mentation. The criteria scored as 3.5 and above were
selected as the criteria most implemented by green
manufacturers.
The matrix data analysis was used to identify the greatest
compliance between the data obtained and the criteria noted
in the previous study and the SIRIM eco-label. The criteria
with the highest degree of compliance were calculated based
on the percentage of compliance, which used the basic math-
ematical formulation as shown in Figure 2. The interview
data were interpreted and organized using the content analy-
sis technique and the thematic approach. The raw data from
the interview session were first coded into a script and man-
aged under important topics, which were then organized
based on thematic forms.
Data Survey
Based on the questionnaires and interview made, a few
findings reflected the objectives targeted were found.
From the questionnaires, the respondents were asked on
their profile and their opinions on the principles of green
building material. The researcher categorized the green
manufacturer into three levels: (a) high level, if the manu-
facturer fulfills all the requirement of green listed compa-
nies in Part A and complies with the principles and criteria

of green in production process in Part B; (b) medium
level, if the manufacturer fulfills 50% requirement in Part
A and complies with certain green principles and criteria
in Part B; and (c) low level, if the manufacturer does not
fulfill part requirement in complying in Part A and Part B,
respectively. For example, the respondents were asked to
provide information on the ways they produced their
building materials based on three main principles which
were the environmental impact, resource management,
and 3R implementation. The scale was rated from 0 (not at
all) to 5 (very high). From the items listed in the environ-
mental criteria, the highest degrees of choice from the
respondents are the reduction of environmental impact
through recycling activities and the efficient usage of
energy. The mean value for these two items is near to the
value of 3.5, and, as such, it can be classified as a high
degree of implementation. Thus, these two criteria were
considered as very important criteria that the company
had to comply to be called a green company. Marked by
correspondence with the data from the interview, one of
the manufacturers mentioned that their products are green
in terms of zero emission. Thus, based on the data, the
manufacturers were scored using mean value scoring sys-
tem mentioned earlier to be classifying as full compliance
or vice versa.
Findings and Discussion
The identification of the most important green criteria of
building material was determined using the mean value, and
this is presented in Table 5. The information gathered from
the interview session was included in the analysis in addition
to the questionnaire survey data. The findings show that the
most selective criteria in P1 are the reduction in the environ-
mental impact through recycling activities and the efficient
use of energy. The interview data shown in Table 6 eluci-
dated that the energy saving criteria are the ones most fre-
quently noted by the interviewees, and they believed this to
be the best element to describe their green building materi-
als. For resource management principles (P2), the electrical
power usage, the natural resource elements, the renewable

resources, and the local materials were the important criteria
that needed to be considered in the production process. The
implementation of 3R element principles shows that the
recyclability criteria are preferred by the green manufactur-
ing companies that represent the value of 3.45.
In relation to the data obtained, the dispersion of the
criteria compliance with the green building materials
noted by the SIRIM eco-label and the previous studies
clarifies the similar and different levels of importance of
the data. For instance, the following has been noted in the
SIRIM eco-label criteria document for fiber-cement prod-
uct: the fiber cement shall contain of not less than 15 per-
cent of recycle content. In the survey data, recycled
material has the second highest mean value in P3, whereas
in the interview data, this criterion is also noted by two of
five manufacturers. One of the interviewees stated that the
company is using recycled materials as 20% of the total
materials in the production process for autoclaved aerated
concrete (AAC). The recycled material criteria are essen-
tial elements to produce the green building material. This
finding aligns with the findings of previous scholars in
which the building material produced with the recycled
content provides a better strength, improves the product
performance (Garg & Jain, 2014), minimizes the usage of
natural resources (Saghafi & Hosseini Teshnizi, 2011),
and reduces GHG emissions and waste production (Kubba,
2010; Mungcharoen et al., 2010).
As noted by Spiegel and Meadows (2010), the green
building material should exhibit less CO
2
emission and
should minimize the impact on the environment. Even the
SIRIM eco-label standard documentation emphasized
reducing the carbon release to the atmosphere during the
production process. However, the survey data show con-
tradictions in what had been gazetted. The carbon release
ranked in 10th place in P1, whereas one of the respondents
noted reduction in carbon emissions during the interview
session. Manufacturer E noted that by replacing the main
elements such as clinker with alternative materials such as
pulverized fuel ash (PFA), CO
2
emissions could be reduced.
The finding was also supported by Aranda Usón, López-
Sabirón, Ferreira, and Llera Sastresa (2013); in their study,
the usage of alternative materials could minimize the wast-
age, reduce energy consumption, minimize costs, and pre-
serve natural resources.
In addition, the authority noted that less than 20 manufac-
turers had enquired about the eco-label certification. The sur-
vey data elucidated that eight of 21 manufacturers had
applied for eco-labeling, and this criterion is ranked as high
as 10th place, with a mean value of 2.62; this is not a prefer-
able criterion among the manufacturing companies. However,
during the interview session, Manufacturer B described this
criterion as a main focus that the company was targeting. The
company had targeted achievement of the green certificate
within and outside the country to the extent possible. As
noted by Zimmerman (2005), green certificates help a com-
pany compete in the green market with more competitive
options. The certificate also helps to protect consumers from
environmental fraud.
The compliance with the previous study and with the
SIRIM eco-label standard criteria was studied to observe the
pattern of the most implemented criteria. The matrix data
analysis used to indicate the cross section between the data is
presented in Appendices A and B. The degree of compliance
had been determined based on the total number of criteria
complied with in the previous study and the SIRIM eco-
label. From Appendix A, the green manufacturer complied
with 10 of 13 green criteria noted by previous scholars,
which results in 76.9% compliance, whereas 66.7% com-
plied with the SIRIM eco-label criteria.
Considering the information gathered from the survey
and the interview, the green building materials criteria are
tabulated in Table 7. As noted earlier, the criteria of the envi-
ronmental impact principle featured two criteria: pollution
prevention and toxicity. However, the findings expanded to
include specific criteria: minimum wastage, no toxicity, and
a low carbon footprint. Of the eight criteria listed in the
resource management principle, five criteria are selected to
determine the green building materials. In the literature, 3R
implementation is listed as one principle of GBM. The depic-
tion of the finding shows that one R is selected, which is the
recycle criteria.
Thus, the principle is refined to a 1R implementation. The
criteria are more specific to two materials: wood and cement-
based products.
Conclusion
In recent years, the environmental issue is a topical issue
that has been debated, and this includes the emergence of
the green building materials issue. The main issues that
Ishak et al. 9
the construction industries are confronted with are the
pollution and waste production. This study's objective
was to identify the compliance of the wood and cement-
based product manufacturers throughout the green build-
ing materials life cycle with the green building materials
criteria. Although current practices on green building
materials in this country remain in the low levels, intro-
ducing these efforts and approaches may help develop
better material production methodologies. Extensive
understanding on the green production of building mate-
rials helps to stimulate the green development as well. If
the manufacturer complied with each criteria in the green
building materials principles, the building materials
would pass through a green production process. However,
there are several implications identified. Malaysian green
building materials industry has not yet witnessed uniform
and objective quality system and construction firms such
as developers, manufacturers, and suppliers practice their
own developed standard. Certain manufacturers did not
fully comply with the criteria listed in the literature and
the SIRIM eco-label documentation. From the list of
green manufacturers in Malaysia, less than 20 manufac-
turers are certified by SIRIM. Although green
certification is one of the important elements to identify
green manufacturers, certain manufacturers refuse to
acknowledge the importance of applying for green certi-
fication. To address this problem, the government of
Malaysia should enforce a mandatory requirement for
manufacturers to certify using green label certification.
Greener construction had become popular trend among
developer and construction industry practitioners. The
government should strictly enhance the green standard
and policy which relates to the environment while foster-
ing green practices in the country. The initiatives in terms
of financial support, green education, and program and
other efforts related to green could be used to promote the
green concept as well as to increase the knowledge and
awareness among the people. Furthermore, understand-
ing on the green building materials and commitment from
the manufacturers will ameliorate the current position of
green material production to better level. However, this
study has concentrated solely on wood and cement-based
products only. Rigorous studies are suggested for future
research work to better understand all the types of build-
ing materials' manufacturers.
