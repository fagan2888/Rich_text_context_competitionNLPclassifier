The composition of breast milk is thought to provide opti-
mal nutrition for an infant and can benefit the health of both
the infant and mother (see Horta and Victora, 2013; Victora
et al., 2016); it is recommended by both the World Health
Organization (WHO) and Health Canada to be given exclu-
sively to infants for the first 6
months of life, with breast-
feeding continuing for up to 2
years after (Health Canada,
2014; WHO, 2013). Although breastfeeding initiation rates
tend to be high overall across the United States (75%;
National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health
Promotion, 2014) and Canada (89%; Gionet, 2013), breast-
feeding duration rates are considerably lower; the rate of
exclusive breastfeeding at 6
months is only 18.8
percent in
the United States and 26percent in Canada. The WHO aims
to increase exclusive breastfeeding rates to 50percent by the
year 2025 (WHO, 2014). To do this, it is necessary to
address the many factors that influence whether, and for
how long, a mother breastfeeds; factors include, but are not
limited to, various socio-demographic barriers (e.g. limited
education, unemployment, and low socioeconomic status),
problems with breastfeeding (e.g. perception of low milk
supply, inconvenience, and fatigue), return to work, inten-
tions to breastfeed, breastfeeding self-efficacy, and adequate
breastfeeding supports (e.g. Brown et al., 2013; Emmanuel,
2015; Li et al., 2008; Meedya et al., 2010).
The marketing of formula in general, and the direct mar-
keting of formula to mothers, can also impact breastfeeding
rates (e.g. Rosenberg et al., 2008; Zhang et al., 2013).1
Zhang et al. (2013) found that, in a sample of over 3000
mothers, mothers reported greater overall media exposure
to information about formula than about breastfeeding;
exposure to formula through print and/or online media had
a negative impact on duration of breastfeeding intentions
and on actual breastfeeding initiation, respectively. In a
focus group of mothers who chose to formula feed their
infants, most mothers felt that formula was "just as good as
or better than breast milk" (Bonia et al., 2013: 4), and that
it was more convenient because feedings could be shared
with others (e.g. partners could participate in feeding), giv-
ing the mother her independence. Mothers also reported
being uncomfortable about the idea of breastfeeding in
public; the view that one would have to breastfeed in
private or cover up while breastfeeding also contributed to
the perception that formula feeding was more convenient.
Using breastfeeding images to promote
breastfeeding among young adults
Erin L Austen, Joey Dignam and Petra Hauf
Abstract
Young adults' reactions to breastfeeding images were assessed using varied approaches. In Study 1, participants viewed
posters from a breastfeeding campaign; many anticipated negative reaction to the campaign. In Study 2, participants
viewed novel infant-feeding posters; breastfeeding posters were viewed for less time than bottle-feeding posters,
regardless of the task assigned. In Study 3, participants were asked to rate their comfort level viewing infant-feeding
images; greater discomfort was reported for breastfeeding images. Taken together, we argue that many young adults
expect, and experience, discomfort viewing breastfeeding, but it is important to continue using breastfeeding images in
promotion efforts.

Report of empirical study
2 Health Psychology Open 
Given the many barriers to breastfeeding, the appeal of
formula, and the many factors that positively influence
whether a mother breastfeeds, the WHO's goal of increas-
ing the breastfeeding duration rate will require a myriad of
solutions and approaches (e.g. reducing inequalities and
ensuring access to care, improving breastfeeding supports
at all levels, and increasing the scope of breastfeeding
promotion efforts). Expanding the scope of breastfeeding
promotion is the focus of this research.
Breastfeeding promotion through
the lens of the Theory of Planned
Behavior
The Theory of Planned Behavior (e.g. Ajzen, 1991) sug-
gests that whether an individual engages in a behavior (e.g.
breastfeeding), depends on factors such as their intention to
engage in the behavior, their attitudes toward the behavior,
and the subjective norms for that behavior (e.g. do people
support the behavior, is there pressure to engage in the
behavior?). In the context of breastfeeding, for example,
mothers who report the intent to breastfeed are more likely
to initiate breastfeeding, and breastfeeding duration is
greater among those with higher intentions (e.g. Donnan
et al., 2013; Meedya et al., 2010). Furthermore, mothers
who reported an intention to breastfeed for 12
months or
more were less likely to discontinue early (DiGirolamo
et al., 2005). Breastfeeding intentions are higher among
those individuals who believe that they can breastfeed suc-
cessfully, have a positive attitude toward breastfeeding,
who believe that breastfeeding is socially acceptable, and
who believe that others support the decision to breastfeed
(e.g. Cabieses et al., 2014; Giles et al., 2014; Mitchell-Box
et al., 2013; Mutuli and Walingo, 2014; Swanson and
Power, 2005). Cabieses et al. (2014), for example, reported
that an intention to engage in mixed-feeding (a combina-
tion of bottle-feeding and breastfeeding) was predicted by
the reported perception of bottle-feeding or mixed feeding
as the social norm.
Unfortunately, negative media coverage of breastfeed-
ing can become an obstacle for improving breastfeeding
rates since it can influence perceptions of subjective norms
for the behavior. Research suggests that when breastfeed-
ing is represented in film or television programming, for
example, it is often presented as being problematic relative
to bottle-feeding (e.g. Foss, 2012; Henderson et al., 2000;
Potter et al., 2000). Similarly, many news articles that refer-
ence breastfeeding tend to highlight individual cases where
breastfeeding mothers were asked to cover up or to leave a
public location, suggesting that breastfeeding in public is
unacceptable (e.g. CBC News, 2014; Judd, 2015). Where
there is uncertainty about how others will respond to seeing
breastfeeding, or where bottle-feeding is perceived as the
social norm, breastfeeding initiation and duration rates suf-
fer (e.g. Avery and Magnus, 2011; Bonia et al., 2013;
Forster and McLachlan, 2010; Leeming et al., 2013; Meng
et al., 2013; Scott and Mostyn, 2003).
Given that young adults are frequent consumers of mass
media content (e.g. Lenhart, 2015), a negative media por-
trayal of breastfeeding could negatively impact this demo-
graphic's views on breastfeeding. Ensuring that this
demographic sees positive examples of breastfeeding is
particularly important since decisions about whether to
breastfeed are made early on, even before individuals have
children (e.g. Fairbrother and Stanger-Ross, 2010;
Kavanagh et al., 2012; Leffler, 2000; Tarrant and Dodgson,
2007). Furthermore, exposure to breastfeeding is linked to
more positive attitudes toward breastfeeding (including
public breastfeeding) and a greater intent to breastfeed
one's own child (e.g. Goulet et al., 2003; Marrone et al.,
2008; Tarrant and Dodgson, 2007; c.f. Vari et al., 2013). To
date, however, little is known about how young adults react
when they are exposed to breastfeeding. While using
breastfeeding images to promote breastfeeding may be one
way to help counteract any negative media coverage of
breastfeeding and to positively influence the perceived
social norms around breastfeeding (see Giles et al., 2014),
the impact of these efforts could be weakened if viewers
respond negatively to seeing breastfeeding. Thus, it is
important to assess young adults'reactions to being exposed
to breastfeeding or breastfeeding images.
Young adults' reactions to
breastfeeding
Much of what we know about how young adults react to
seeing breastfeeding is through survey data assessing opin-
ions about breastfeeding in public, and from responses to
hypothetical scenarios (Acker, 2009; Kavanagh et al., 2012;
Spurles and Babineau, 2011). From such data, it is clear that
anticipated reactions to seeing breastfeeding are largely
negative among young adults. In a sample of university stu-
dents from the Southeast United States, for example,
67.8percent of those surveyed reported that breastfeeding in
public was unacceptable behavior, and 77.7percent reported
that it should only be done in private because it was an act
of intimacy (Spear, 2007). Close to half of a sample of stu-
dents surveyed from a Nursing program within the same
region felt that women should not breastfeed in public
(Spear, 2006). More recently, 71.0
percent of female and
47.7percent of male undergraduate students, sampled from
the University of Tennessee, indicated that public breast-
feeding is embarrassing and unacceptable (Kavanagh et al.,
2012). The majority of university-educated focus group par-
ticipants in Eastern Canada also shared the view that public
breastfeeding had to be done discreetly, or in designated
areas, for it to be acceptable (Spurles and Babineau, 2011).
In a Midwestern university-based sample, both younger
(students) and older (faculty, staff, and administration) par-
ticipants expressed neutral rather than positive attitudes
Austen et al. 3
about the appropriateness of breastfeeding in public loca-
tions (Vari et al., 2013). Taken together, existing survey and
focus group results indicate that young adults tend to disap-
prove of public breastfeeding even though they report being
supportive of breastfeeding and are knowledgeable about
the benefits of breastfeeding (Forrester et al., 1997;
Kavanagh et al., 2012; Li et al., 2002; McIntyre et al., 2001;
Scott et al., 1997; Spear, 2007; Spurles and Babineau, 2011;
Tarrant and Dodgson, 2007).
One of the few studies to look at how young adults react
to viewing a photograph of a breastfeeding mother was a
study published by Acker (2009). In this study, a large sam-
ple of university students and older adults were presented
with a set of nine photographs and had to answer six ques-
tions about the individual in the photo. The key manipula-
tion was that one of the photographs depicted a mother
breastfeeding her infant; half of the participants viewed a
picture of a mother breastfeeding in private, while the
remaining participants saw a picture of a mother breast-
feeding in public. Evaluations were significantly more pos-
itive for the mother who breastfed in private than in public,
which suggest more negative attitudes about the latter
breastfeeding scenario. This interpretation is certainly con-
sistent with the survey data reviewed above. Since there
was no bottle-feeding photograph comparison, however, it
is difficult to know how reactions to seeing a picture of a
breastfeeding mother compare to those of seeing a bottle-
feeding mother.
Fairbrother and Stanger-Ross (2010) at least partially
addressed this issue in a study comparing female university
students' reactions to pictures of breastfeeding versus bottle-
feeding by having the participants evaluate an infant-feeding
picture as part of a larger study. Half of the participants
viewed a picture of a woman breastfeeding her infant while
the other half viewed a picture of the same woman bottle-
feeding her infant. Participants were given a list of positive-
valence and negative-valence adjectives with which to rate
the picture. Participants who viewed the breastfeeding pic-
ture assigned higher ratings on the positive-valence adjec-
tives than those who viewed the bottle-feeding picture. They
also, however, reported less positive attitudes toward public
breastfeeding than public formula feeding, suggesting limi-
tations to their support for breastfeeding.
More recently, Vieth et al. (2015) tested the effective-
ness of viewing a breastfeeding poster campaign to
improve comfort levels with breastfeeding. They recruited
a convenience sample of participants from a local shop-
ping mall in two rural communities in Newfoundland
and Labrador, a region with low breastfeeding rates.
Participants completed a short survey to assess their com-
fort levels with breastfeeding in public venues, and to
assess awareness of the campaign. Participants who
reported not being aware of the campaign were then shown
the breastfeeding posters2 and asked to study them for a
brief time period. These participants then completed a
follow-up survey to assess whether viewing the posters
changed their reported comfort levels. The researchers
reported a small improvement in comfort level after seeing
the posters. Although this is promising data, the interven-
tion was brief and may have encouraged a change in
response by asking participants to immediately reassess
their comfort levels after viewing the posters. Additionally,
the study did not focus specifically on young adults, who
made up only a small proportion of the participants.
The present research
Given the limited number of studies that directly assess how
young adults react to seeing breastfeeding, many questions
remain unanswered. First, since participants in these studies
were not asked how they think others would respond to see-
ing breastfeeding, it is not easy to assess their perception of
the subjective norms around breastfeeding; this will be the
focus of Study 1. Second, the studies look at minor manipu-
lations of a single photo or poster rather than reactions to a
range of breastfeeding and bottle-feeding photos, so there is
a limit to the conclusions that can be drawn from these stud-
ies. Finally, although it is important to assess explicit reac-
tions to breastfeeding and breastfeeding pictures (e.g. survey
responses), the outcome of this type of assessment may be
influenced by a social desirability bias, that is, a bias to
respond in a socially acceptable way (Van de Mortel, 2008).
Thus, it is equally important to assess reactions to both
breastfeeding and bottle-feeding pictures using implicit
measures such as memory tests and eye movements. Both of
these latter two questions will be addressed using different
methodologies in Study 2 (implicit measures of eye move-
ments, memory tests) and Study 3 (explicit reaction to a
range of infant-feeding pictures). Thus, the aim of all three
studies reported here is to assess young adults' reactions to
seeing images of breastfeeding.
Study 1
In Study 1, we first assessed the breastfeeding intentions of
a sample of young adults attending university in
Northeastern Nova Scotia, a region of the province where
breastfeeding rates are low (e.g. Brown et al., 2013). In this
study, we also assessed participants' reactions to a former
provincial breastfeeding poster campaign. Doing so
allowed us to establish a clear picture of the perception of
social norms around breastfeeding.
Methods
Recruitment approach and measures. All undergraduate stu-
dents who were enrolled in an Introductory Psychology
course (approximately 750 students) at the researchers'
institution were invited to complete a large paper and pen-
cil survey package during class time. Participation was
4 Health Psychology Open 
voluntary. Participants received partial course credit for
completing the surveys. This larger survey package
included a survey of basic demographic information and
the two key survey measures of interest. The first key
measure was a forced-choice measure of breastfeeding
intentions that required participants to indicate whether
they wanted their own child to be breastfed. The other
measure involved showing participants a single image of a
former breastfeeding promotion poster series used in Nova
Scotia. The size of the image made it possible for partici-
pants to clearly see the breastfeeding images used, as well
as the title of the poster series "Nova Scotia promotes, pro-
tects, and supports breastfeeding!," although the remainder
of the poster text was not legible. Participants were asked to
provide a written response to this poster campaign to indi-
cate how they anticipated others would react to seeing the
posters.
Inclusion and exclusion criteria. The initial inclusion criterion
used was that participants had to be enrolled in Introduc-
tory Psychology and to be present in class on the day that
the larger survey package was distributed. A total of 612
undergraduate Psychology students (463 females) com-
pleted the larger survey package in exchange for partial
course credit. Ages of participants ranged from 17 to
58years (M=18.79, standard deviation (SD)=2.92years).
Since the focus of this study was on young adults, and the
majority (98%) of participants were between the ages of 17
and 23
years, responses from participants outside of this
age range were excluded from the analysis.
Participants.A total of 594 participants (455 females) met
the criteria for inclusion. The majority of participants
(84.8%) were in their first year of university, and over half
of them originated from Nova Scotia (58.8%). Ethnicity was
not particularly diverse; 63.1
percent of the sample was
Euro-Canadian, 1.9percent African-Canadian, 1.2percent
Aboriginal, .5
percent Asian, and 17.8
percent selected
"Other,"3 while .3percent did not provide a response.
Procedure.Psychology course instructors informed poten-
tial participants in advance that they would have the oppor-
tunity to complete a package of surveys from various
researchers within the Psychology Department and that the
survey packages would be completed during a specified
class period early in the academic year. Upper-level psy-
chology students assisted with the distribution of the sur-
veys in class and also collected the surveys as participants
returned them. Course instructors were not in the classroom
when the surveys were being completed.As noted above, in
addition to basic demographic information, participants
completed the two measures of interest for this particular
study. The Breastfeeding Intentions question asked "Would
you want your own child to be breastfed?" Participants
could select either a "yes" or "no" response to this question.
The Breastfeeding Social Norms questionnaire involved
showing participants a single image of a former breastfeed-
ing promotion poster series used in the province. The par-
ticipants were given a brief preamble about the purpose of
the poster campaign (i.e. to promote breastfeeding) and
then they were asked the following open-ended key ques-
tion: "How do you think people will react to these posters?"
Participants were given space on the survey to record their
response.
Results and discussion
In response to the Breastfeeding Intentions question,
90.6
percent of respondents indicated that "yes" they
would want their own child to be breastfed, while only
6.7
percent said "no," and 2.7
percent did not provide a
response. Thus, intentions to breastfeed reported within
this group were very high. This measure, taken on its own,
suggests that messages around breastfeeding promotion
must be reaching this sample on some level. Furthermore,
it indicates that attitudes toward breastfeeding must be
generally positive since the majority of respondents plan to
breastfeed. These findings are promising, given that breast-
feeding intentions predict behavior (e.g. Donnan et al.,
2013; Meedya et al., 2010). Intentions to breastfeed, how-
ever, do not guarantee initiation or continued breastfeeding
following initiation. One's perception of social norms
around breastfeeding and the perceived social acceptabil-
ity of breastfeeding, among other factors, also play a role
(e.g. Cabieses et al., 2014).
With respect to the Breastfeeding Social Norms ques-
tionnaire, which assessed anticipation of the reaction that
members of the general public would have to the provincial
breastfeeding poster campaign, 94 of 594 (15.8%) partici-
pants did not provide any response to this question. It is
difficult to interpret what this non-response means. It may
be that these participants did not feel that the questionnaire
was relevant to them because it depicted breastfeeding, or it
could be that they were uncomfortable seeing the breast-
feeding image and chose to skip this particular survey. A
content analysis was conducted on the remaining 500 par-
ticipant responses. Because the goal of this study was to
capture how participants' felt others would react to seeing
the breastfeeding poster campaign, two different raters
independently coded the overall valence of each response;
responses were coded as being generally positive, negative
or mixed. By coding responses, it was possible to assess the
perceived social norms around breastfeeding among this
group of participants. Cohen's k was computed to assess the
level of agreement in the categorization of responses across
the two raters. Agreement between the raters was almost
perfect (k=.831, p
<
.0001); most disagreements between
raters typically involved use of the "negative" versus
"mixed" categories. After independently rating participant
responses, the reviewers met to discuss and resolve any
Austen et al. 5
discrepancies in their ratings. The means reported below
are based on these adjusted ratings.
Positive comments were those where the participant
clearly anticipated a positive response to the poster cam-
paign or general acceptance of the campaign. For example,
one participant said, "I think people will react normally to
these posters because breastfeeding is important to new-
born babies and is natural among pregnant/new mothers."
Likewise, another participant said, "I don't think people
[will] mind these posters, it's a part of life." Negative com-
ments were those where participants clearly anticipated a
negative public response to the poster, or a response of dis-
approval. One participant said, "Not well, people are going
to think they are obscene and inappropriate," while another
participant wrote,
I think people will write nasty words like "slut or tramp" on the
poster and will not take the idea the poster is trying to portray
seriously, because the girl breastfeeding her child looks very
young--like 15! Also, boys are immature and if they see a
young woman (or an old woman) with her breast almost fully
exposed, they will take the poster the wrong way and only
focus on the body part not the message. People will react to
these posters but not in the way they want them to react.
Mixed responses were those that indicated either that
some people would react positively, while others would
react negatively, or responses that indicated that people
would respond positively to one aspect of the campaign
(e.g. breastfeeding promotion), but not to other aspects
(e.g. breast exposure). One participant remarked, "Some
people may take offense to the posters, especially if they
can't breastfeed, but mothers who have, they will be very
supportive of the campaign." Another participant wrote, "I
think for the most part they will be accepted, but some peo-
ple will find faults, like too much boob or if the moms look
young, they will say teen pregnancy is encouraged."
Of the 500 responses provided, the majority of responses
were categorized as mixed (n=293; 58.6%). Furthermore,
more than twice as many responses were categorized as
being negative (n
=
149; 29.8%) compared to positive
(n
=
58; 11.6%). To gain further insight into these ratings,
we assessed how often the sight of the breast (i.e. breast
exposure) was provided as a reason for the anticipated neg-
ative or mixed response. Interestingly, breast exposure was
frequently cited (i.e. cited within 248 or 56.1% of the nega-
tive and mixed comments) as being one reason for the neg-
ative response to the campaign.
The results from this study paint an interesting picture.
First, the majority of respondents indicated that they want
their future child(ren) to be breastfed, which suggests that
breastfeeding intentions are high. When asked how the
public would respond to seeing a breastfeeding poster cam-
paign that depicted breastfeeding, however, the majority of
respondents anticipated a negative or mixed response to the
campaign. This indicates that there is still a perception of
negative social norms around breastfeeding. Perceptions
such as these pose a potential barrier for any increase in
breastfeeding duration rates. Considering that almost half
of the negative or mixed comments included a reference to
breast exposure, this strongly suggests that breastfeeding in
public is perceived as an issue and furthermore that hyper-
sexualization of the breast might be the underlying reason
(see Johnston-Robledo et al., 2007).
Anticipated discomfort seeing breastfeeding is a barrier
that needs to be addressed in future efforts to promote
breastfeeding. Given that, within the media, breastfeeding
is often represented as being problematic relative to bottle-
feeding (e.g. Foss, 2012; Henderson et al., 2000), efforts
should be made to ensure that positive examples of breast-
feeding are prominent in the media, and that the public has
ample opportunity to be exposed to breastfeeding (e.g. pro-
mote breastfeeding friendly spaces to encourage breast-
feeding anytime and anywhere).
In this study, young adults were asked how they thought
others would respond to seeing the breastfeeding promo-
tion poster; the response clearly indicated the anticipation
of a negative reaction from others. If young adults were
asked how they would react to seeing the poster themselves,
however, the response is likely to be more positive, but it
would be difficult to tease apart whether they actually felt
comfortable viewing the breastfeeding poster or whether
they were responding in a socially desirable way. One way
around this issue is to use an alternate measure of response
to the poster. That is, rather than ask participants to describe
how they would react to seeing the poster, it is possible to
use a less conscious and controllable measure to assess
reaction, in this case, looking behavior and reaction time.
Study 2
It is possible that a negative perception of social norms
around breastfeeding, and limited opportunities to see
breastfeeding, could impact how young adults look at and
process any poster aimed at promoting breastfeeding. To
assess reactions to seeing breastfeeding, it would be ideal to
use a measure that is minimally susceptible to response
bias. In Study 2, we used eye-tracking technology to record
looking behavior, while participants viewed novel infant-
feeding posters designed specifically for this study. The
posters included an infant-feeding picture paired with a
brief feeding-relevant slogan. The posters were presented
in random order to participants. Measuring eye movements
provided an implicit measure on which to compare how
young adults view breastfeeding versus bottle-feeding; dif-
ferences in looking times could be compared across the two
picture types. Based on past eye movement research (e.g.
Mogg et al., 2003; Rinck and Becker, 2006), and what is
known about anticipated reactions to seeing breastfeeding
(e.g. Acker, 2009; Kavanagh et al., 2012; Spurles and
6 Health Psychology Open 
Babineau, 2011), it was predicted that looking times would
be shorter for breastfeeding posters than for bottle-feeding
posters since the former would be more likely to elicit
discomfort.4
Participants were assigned to complete one of three
timed categorization tasks designed to focus attention on
the infant-feeding picture, the slogan, or both. Using dif-
ferent types of tasks helped to vary the degree to which
participants were required to focus on the breastfeeding
and bottle-feeding images. We predicted that participants
would be faster to complete categorization tasks that
required them to look at the image versus the slogan, and
faster when the poster they were looking at included a
breastfeeding image. Following the categorization task,
participants were given a surprise slogan recall and recog-
nition task to assess memory for the slogans. The unex-
pected memory test allowed us to determine whether the
ability to recall or recognize written information that was
paired with the image depended on the type of image
viewed. We predicted that recall and recognition of the
slogans would be worse for slogans that were paired with
breastfeeding images.
Method
Recruitment approach.
Upper-level psychology student
researcher and second author (J.D.) visited the classrooms
of Introductory Psychology courses at the researchers'
institution to recruit potential participants for this study.
After providing each class with a short verbal description
of the research project and what it entailed as a participant,
a sign-up sheet was circulated around the classroom for
interested participants.
Inclusion and exclusion criteria.All students enrolled in
Introductory Psychology were eligible to participate in this
study. A total of 99 student participants (79 women, 20
men) visited the lab to participate in the study. Since the
main aim of this study was to determine whether there are
differences in how young adults view breastfeeding versus
bottle-feeding posters, and whether the type of poster
viewed can influence memory for the accompanying slo-
gans, it was critical to have looking data for each partici-
pant. Thus, participants were excluded from the study if eye
movement data could not be collected, and/or if there was
an issue with the categorization data (e.g. not following
task instructions). Using these exclusion criteria, 27 partici-
pants were excluded from the analysis; this was due to
unexpected technical issues (n
=
1), confusion with task
instructions (n
=
3), and incomplete or insufficient eye
movement data5 (n=23).
Participants.In total, data were analyzed from 72 partici-
pants (55 females, 17 males), with 24 participants per
categorization task (12 participants for each possible
response mapping). Participants received partial course
credit for their participation.
Procedure. Participants were randomly assigned to complete
one of three timed categorization tasks involving infant-
feeding posters presented on an eye-tracker. Posters con-
sisted of a breastfeeding or bottle-feeding image paired with
a slogan. The same posters were used for each task. In the
Picture Assessment task, participants decided whether the
picture depicted breastfeeding or bottle-feeding. In the Slo-
gan Assessment task, participants decided whether the tone
of the slogan was positive or negative. And, in the Slogan-
Picture Appropriateness task, participants decided whether
the slogan was appropriate for the picture with which it was
paired. As soon as participants made a decision, they
responded by pressing one of two assigned computer keys.
Response times (RTs) were recorded for each task, as well
as looking time (as assessed through dwell times using the
eye-tracking equipment) within two defined poster areas, in
this case, the slogan versus the picture. Following the com-
pletion of the categorization task, participants were asked to
complete two memory tests: slogan recall and slogan recog-
nition. Since participants were not told about these memory
tests at the outset of the study, the tests were unexpected,
and served as a way to assess passive intake of the slogans.
Accuracy for the memory tasks was recorded.
Participants were seated approximately 60
cm from a
Tobii Eye-Tracking Device XL (60
Hz sample rate), on
which the infant-feeding posters were presented. Posters
were displayed for a minimum of 2000
ms (observation
period)andremainedondisplayuntilparticipantsresponded.6
Of the 40 posters, half included breastfeeding images and the
other half included bottle-feeding images. Images were
selected from those available on the Internet via search
engines, using the criteria that the breastfeeding and bottle-
feeding images were comparable to one another, the images
could be resized to one of two common sizes without distor-
tion, and that the racial diversity of moms and babies por-
trayed in the images roughly matched the diversity of our
potential sample. All of these criteria helped to maximize the
generalizability of the results of this study. Of the 20 breast-
feeding images selected, seven showed a close-up of the
baby on the breast with the mother being only partially visi-
ble, while the remaining images showed both the mother and
baby in complete view. In 10 of the 20 breastfeeding images,
the mother's breast was partially visible. Of the 20 bottle-
feeding images selected, seven showed a close-up of the
baby being bottle-fed with the view of the mother obscured,
while the remaining images showed both the mother and
baby in complete view. Some images naturally had a more
horizontal orientation (measuring 15.1×8.6degrees of visual
angle) than others (measuring 11.6
×
9.7
degrees of visual
angle). Below each image was a slogan typed in white Times
New Roman font and presented on a black background. A
Austen et al. 7
total of 20 unique slogans were used, where each slogan was
paired with two different infant-feeding images (either two
different breastfeeding images or two different bottle-feed-
ing images). Some slogans were positively framed (e.g. Off
to the best start, Healthy eating for a healthy mind), while
others were negatively framed (e.g. Reduce the risks, Proper
feeding reduces illness). Slogans were positioned approxi-
mately 9.5
degrees of visual angle below the image, and
ranged from three to six words in length.
Before the experiment began, participants underwent an
eye movement calibration to ensure that the device was able
to detect the participant's eyes and track them as they
moved. Successful calibration was followed by the
Categorization Task, which involved the presentation of the
infant-feeding posters in random order. Response mappings
for each of the categorization tasks were counterbalanced
across participants. For example, half of the participants in
the Picture Assessment task used one response mapping ("z"
for breastfeeding pictures, "/" for bottle-feeding pictures)
while the other half used the opposite response mapping.
After viewing all 40 picture-slogan pairs and making
forced-choice decisions regarding each pair, the partici-
pants were presented with a surprise Slogan Recall Task,
which required them to use the keyboard to type as many
slogans as they could recall. Following the completion of
this task, participants were then presented with a surprise
Slogan Recognition Task. In this task, old and new slogans
were presented one at a time and participants were asked to
decide whether the slogan was previously presented in the
Categorization Task (i.e. old) or whether it was never
shown before (i.e. new). Responses were made by pressing
one of two computer keys (e.g. "z" for old or "/" for new).
Accuracy for both memory tasks was recorded.
Results and discussion
Categorization RTs (in ms).Categorization RT data were
subjected to analyses of variance (ANOVAs) using the
within-subjects factors of Picture Type (Breast or Bottle),
between-subjects factors of Categorization Task (Picture
Assessment, Slogan Assessment, and Slogan-Picture
Appropriateness), and Response Mapping (A or B). As pic-
tured in Figure 1, categorization times were significantly
faster overall for breastfeeding pictures (1459ms) than for
bottle-feeding pictures (1713ms), F (1, 66)=8.61, p<.01.
There were also significant differences in overall categori-
zation times across the three tasks, F (2, 66)=11.77, p<.01.
Categorization times were fastest in the Picture Assessment
Task (878
ms), slowest in the Slogan Assessment Task
(2239
ms), and intermediate in the Slogan-Picture Appro-
priateness Task (1641ms), all p's<.05. This finding is con-
sistent with the prediction that categorization times would
be faster for tasks that required participants to look at the
image on the poster. No other main effects or interactions
reached significance.
Looking time (in ms). Looking time data were subjected
to ANOVAs using the within-subjects factors of Poster
Area (Slogan or Picture) and Feeding Type (Breast or
Bottle), and the between-subjects factor of Categoriza-
tion Task (Picture Assessment, Slogan Assessment, and
Slogan-Picture Appropriateness). As pictured in Figure 2,
looking times were shorter overall when the posters
depicted breastfeeding (1299
ms) versus bottle-feeding
(1428ms), F (1, 69)=15.9, p<.01. This finding is con-
sistent with the prediction that participants would
minimize the time they spent on breastfeeding images
compared to bottle-feeding images. Looking times also
varied across task type, F (2, 69)=5.03, p<.01. That is,
looking times were significantly (p's<.05) shorter for
the Picture Assessment task (1107
ms) than either the
Slogan Assessment task (1422ms) or the Slogan-Picture
Appropriateness task (1560
ms), which did not differ
from one another.
As pictured in Figure 3, participants looked at slogans
(653ms) for significantly less time than pictures (2074ms),

F (1, 69)=196.7, p<.01. The Feeding Type (Breast,
Bottle)×Poster Area (Slogan, Picture) interaction was sig-
nificant, F (1, 69)=12.01, p
<
.01. Simple effects tests
revealed that there was no significant difference in the time
participants spent looking at slogans paired with a breast-
feeding image (639ms) or a bottle-feeding image (667ms),
F (1, 71)
=
1.11. There was, however, a significant differ-
ence in looking time for the pictures when the poster
depicted breastfeeding (1958
ms) versus bottle-feeding
(2189ms), F (1, 71)=17.05, p<.01. These results confirm
that participants looked at both types of pictures and the
slogans paired with those pictures. As expected, breastfeed-
ing posters were viewed for significantly less time than
bottle-feeding posters.
The Task Type (PictureAssessment, SloganAssessment,
or Slogan-Picture Appropriateness)×Poster Area (Slogan
or Picture) interaction was also significant, F (2, 69)=5.48,
p<.01; see Figure 4. Simple effects tests revealed that the
time participants spent looking at the slogans significantly
differed across tasks. The longest looking times occurred
for slogans in the Slogan Assessment Task (904
ms,
p's
<
.01), compared to either the Picture Assessment task
(420
ms) or the Slogan-Picture Appropriateness task
(634
ms), which did not differ from one another, F (2,
69)=7.63, p<.01. In contrast, the overall time that partici-
pants spent looking at the pictures was significantly longer
(p's
<
.05) in the Slogan-Picture Appropriateness task
(2487
ms) than for either the Picture Assessment task
(1795ms) or the Slogan Assessment task (1940ms), which
did not differ from one another. As expected, these findings
indicate that where participants looked, and how long they
looked, depended on the task assigned to them.
Slogan recall (%). Slogan recall (%) data were subjected to
ANOVAs using the within-subjects factors of Picture
Type (Breast or Bottle), between-subjects factors of Cat-
egorization Task (Picture Assessment, Slogan Assess-
ment, and Slogan-PictureAppropriateness), and Response
Mapping (A or B). The percentage of slogans that were
recalled did not significantly differ based on whether a
breastfeeding (14.9%) or bottle-feeding (14.5%) picture
was present; in other words, there was no main effect of
Picture Type, F<1; see Figure 5. Slogan recall was simi-
larly low across both poster types. The reasons for this
are not yet clear and will require further study, but would
be expected to improve if participants were given advance
notice of the memory test. Slogan recall, however, did
vary across task (i.e. significant main effect of Task
Type), F (2, 66)=16.1, p<.001. Recall was significantly
lower (p's
<
.01) in the Picture Assessment task (7.6%)
than in either the Slogan Assessment task (19.0%) or the
Slogan-Picture Appropriateness task (17.5%), which
were statistically similar. This finding likely reflects the
fact that the slogan was not relevant for the completion of
the Picture Assessment task, but was relevant to the other
two tasks. No other main effects or interactions reached
significance.
Austen et al. 9
Slogan recognition (%).Slogan recognition data (% cor-
rect) were subjected to ANOVAs using the within-
subjects factors of Picture Pairing (Breast, Bottle, or
None), between-subjects factors of Categorization Task
(Picture Assessment, Slogan Assessment, and Slogan-
Picture Appropriateness), and Response Mapping (A or
B). Overall, accuracy on the slogan recognition test was
similar whether the slogan was new (82.3%), that is, not
previously paired with a picture, or paired with a breast-
feeding picture (83.8%), or bottle-feeding picture
(81.7%), F (2, 132)<1, n.s. Again, this finding is in con-
trast to the hypothesized outcomes. The percentage of
slogans that were recognized with each type of picture
pairing, however, depended on the categorization task
assigned (i.e. significant Picture Pairing
×
Task Type
interaction, F (4, 132)=3.13, p
<
.05) (see Figure 6).
Simple effects tests revealed a significant main effect of
Picture Pairing in the Slogan Assessment task only, F (2,
46)=3.71, p
<
.05. Slogans paired with bottle-feeding
pictures were better recognized (92.5%) than new
slogans (86%, p<.05), but did not differ with respect to
breastfeeding pictures (90.8%). No main effects or other
interactions reached significance.
Task assessment measures (%).Because each Categoriza-
tion Task involved a different measure (% correct for the
Picture Assessment task, percent positive for the Slogan
Assessment task, and percent appropriate for the Slogan-
Picture Assessment task), measures were analyzed sepa-
rately. Each analysis involved an ANOVA using the
within-subjects factor of Picture Type (Breast, Bottle),
between-subjects factors of Categorization Task (Picture
Assessment, Slogan Assessment, Slogan-Picture Appropri-
ateness), and Response Mapping (A or B):
Picture Assessment Task. Participants in this task were
equally accurate at categorizing breastfeeding pictures
(99% correct) and bottle-feeding pictures (98%
correct), F (1, 22)=2.80, p>.10. No other effects were
significant.
Slogan Assessment Task. More of the slogans paired
with breastfeeding pictures were rated as positive (88%
positive) compared to the slogans paired with bottle-
feeding pictures (51% positive),7 F (1, 22)=44.3, p<.01.
No other effects were significant.
Slogan-Picture Appropriateness Task. More of the slo-
gans that were paired with breastfeeding pictures were
categorized as appropriate (80% appropriate) compared
to the slogans paired with bottle-feeding pictures (44%
appropriate), F (1, 22)=21.4, p
<
.01. No other effects
were significant.
The results from this study suggest that regardless of the
task, participants were faster to make their categorization
decisions in the presence of a breastfeeding image versus a
bottle-feeding image. This was the case even when the
image was irrelevant to the task, as in the SloganAssessment
Task. Additionally, participants tended to look at the breast-
feeding images for a significantly shorter period of time
than the bottle-feeding images. Taken together, these results
suggest that participants reacted differently to breastfeeding
and bottle-feeding images. One possible interpretation for
these differences in looking times is that participants may
have experienced discomfort when looking at the breast-
feeding images. This interpretation is entirely consistent
with the results from existing survey and focus group data
suggesting that individuals are embarrassed to see breast-
feeding, particularly in a public setting (Forrester et al.,
1997; Kavanagh et al., 2012; Li et al., 2002; McIntyre et al.,
2001; Spurles and Babineau, 2011; Tarrant and Dodgson,
2007). This interpretation also aligns with the results from
Study 1, where the majority of participants expected others
to have a negative or mixed reaction to a breastfeeding
poster campaign that depicted breastfeeding. It is entirely
possible that young adults not only expect others to be
uncomfortable to see breastfeeding but also experience dis-
comfort when exposed to breastfeeding images. Given that
people tend to have more experience with seeing bottle-
feeding than seeing breastfeeding, it would make sense that
they are less comfortable seeing the latter. This again points
to the importance of exposure.
It was interesting that this quantitatively different
response to breastfeeding versus bottle-feeding images did
not lead to poorer recall and recognition of the slogans
paired with the breastfeeding images. Slogan recall and
recognition varied across tasks (i.e. lowest overall in the
Picture Assessment Task), but did not depend on image
pairing (i.e. breastfeeding versus bottle-feeding). This find-
ing is good news for the promotion of breastfeeding; it sug-
gests that even if people tend to minimize how long they
look at breastfeeding posters (whether because of discom-
fort, or not), this decreased looking time is likely to have
Figure 6. Slogans Recognized (%) as a function of Task
Type×Image Pairing (significant interaction, p<.05, where in
the Slogan Assessment task recognition was highest for slogans
paired with bottle-feeding pictures).
10 Health Psychology Open 
minimal impact on how well they process the written infor-
mation that accompanies the picture. Even though this
study provides clear evidence that people made faster deci-
sions about breastfeeding versus bottle-feeding posters, and
that they looked at breastfeeding pictures for shorter dura-
tions, it remains to be seen whether these findings can be
attributed to discomfort.
Study 3
In Study 3, we wanted to determine whether discomfort
viewing breastfeeding images could account for the
shorter viewing times of the breastfeeding versus bottle-
feeding posters in Study 2. We recruited a new group of
participants for this study for three main reasons. One,
exposure to breastfeeding images has the potential to pos-
itively influence how comfortable one is to see breast-
feeding, so we wanted a group of participants who would
see these images for the first time, just like the original
participants in Study 2. If we tested the same group of
participants, the pictures would have been familiar and
may not elicit the same level of discomfort the second
time around. Two, although the breastfeeding and bottle-
feeding pictures used in Study 2 were comparable, they
were selected from those available on the Internet, which
meant that there were inevitable variations in the photos
from the two sets. Thus, it would be helpful to know
whether this same photo set elicits discomfort in a new
group of participants. Three, by testing a new group of
participants, it was possible to assess discomfort within a
larger sample of participants, which would ensure greater
generalizability of the results. We predicted that partici-
pants would be significantly more uncomfortable viewing
breastfeeding images.
Method
Recruitment approach.Undergraduate students enrolled in
Introductory Psychology classes at the researchers' institu-
tion were invited, by email and/or through short in-class
presentations, to participate in a large online survey pack-
age. Participation was voluntary and surveys were com-
pleted outside of class time.
Inclusion and exclusion criteria. To be included in the study,
students had to be enrolled in Introductory Psychology, and
they had to complete the large online survey package. A
total of 440 undergraduate psychology students partici-
pated and received partial course credit. Participants were
excluded from this study if they did not complete the sur-
vey of interest, the Picture Rating survey; six participants
were excluded for this reason. Again, since the focus of the
study was on young adults, we limited our analysis to those
participants aged 17­25
years; this criterion excluded an
additional four participants.
Participants.In total, there were 430 participants (336
females, 92 males, and 2 undisclosed) who were included
in this study. The average age of participants was 18years
old. The majority (87.9%) of students were in their first
year of university. Within the sample, 87
percent were
Euro-Canadian, .9percent African-Canadian, .9percent
Asian, .5percentAboriginal, and 7percent selected "Other."
Procedure. The introductory text included with the Picture
Rating survey informed participants that they would be
looking at images that depicted infant feeding and that
were being considered for use in educational materials.
They were asked to indicate how comfortable they felt
viewing each image. Comfort ratings were made using a
7-point Likert scale (1
=
very uncomfortable and 7
=
very
comfortable). All 40 images (20 breastfeeding and 20 bot-
tle-feeding) used in Study 2 were presented in random
order to each participant. Ratings for each image were
recorded electronically. In order to compare ratings for
breastfeeding images where the mother's breast was par-
tially visible to those where the breast was not visible, rat-
ings were averaged across the 10 pictures in these two
subgroups. To compare ratings of breastfeeding and bottle-
feeding images, ratings were averaged across all 20 pic-
tures within each picture type to provide an average
breastfeeding comfort rating and an average bottle-feeding
comfort rating for each participant.
Results and discussion
To confirm that there was internal consistency across rat-
ings for the 20 breastfeeding images and across ratings for
the 20 bottle-feeding images, a reliability analysis was con-
ducted for each image set. Cronbach's alpha for comfort
level ratings of breastfeeding images was .98, suggesting
high internal consistency. Similarly, Cronbach's alpha for
ratings of bottle-feeding images was also .98, which sug-
gests high internal consistency for that image set as well.
Average comfort ratings were computed for each picture in
the two picture sets. Average comfort ratings for each of the
20 breastfeeding images ranged from a low of 3.60 to a
high of 5.89. Average comfort ratings for each of the 20
bottle-feeding images ranged from a low of 5.95 to a high
of 6.49. It is interesting to note that the average comfort
ratings at the top range for breastfeeding images was lower
than the average ratings at the bottom range for bottle-feed-
ing images. Given these differences in the range of comfort
ratings, it is obvious that participants were uncomfortable
viewing the breastfeeding images and that they responded
very differently to these images than they did to the bottle-
feeding images.
A dependent samples t-test was conducted to compare
average comfort ratings for breastfeeding versus bottle-
feeding pictures. Participants rated being significantly less
comfortable looking at breastfeeding pictures (4.90) than
Austen et al. 11
bottle-feeding pictures (6.33), t (429)=-19.45, p<.001.
This finding is consistent with "discomfort" seeing breast-
feeding images as a possible explanation for the shorter
looking times for breastfeeding versus bottle-feeding post-
ers in Study 2.
A dependent samples t-test was also conducted to com-
pare average comfort ratings for the 10 breastfeeding images
where the mother's breast was partially exposed to the 10
images where the breast was not exposed. Ratings were sig-
nificantly lower when the mother's breast was visible (4.26)
than when the breast was not visible (5.55), t (429)=-23.81,
p<.001. This difference in ratings indicates that participants
are significantly less comfortable viewing breastfeeding
images where the mother's breast is visible than where the
breast is concealed in some way. Again, these results are
also consistent with the "discomfort" hypothesis that was
proposed as an explanation for the shorter looking times on
breastfeeding posters compared to bottle-feeding posters in
Study 2. These findings are also consistent with the existing
literature suggesting people tend to be uncomfortable seeing
a woman breastfeeding her baby (e.g. Meng et al., 2013;
Stewart-Knox et al., 2003) and believe that mothers should
cover up and be discreet if they are to breastfeed in public
(Spurles and Babineau, 2011).
General discussion
The aim of this research was to assess both implicitly and
explicitly how young adults react to seeing breastfeeding.
In Study 1, participants were asked to look at a breastfeed-
ing promotion poster and indicate how others might react to
seeing the poster; many participants believed that public
response to seeing breastfeeding is one of discomfort and
disgust. This negative perception of the social norms
around breastfeeding has the potential to keep future breast-
feeding rates low. Despite this perception, we found that
most young adults intend to breastfeed their child(ren).
Although the intent to breastfeed is high in this sample of
young adults, and is promising for breastfeeding in the
future, social norms could negatively impact the duration
of breastfeeding. One way to improve the perception of
social norms is through positive exposure to breastfeeding
and breastfeeding images (e.g. Giles et al., 2014). For
example, it is now well established that previous exposure
to breastfeeding is linked to positive attitudes about breast-
feeding and one's intent to breastfeed (Greene et al., 2003;
Hoddinott et al., 2010; Isaacowitz et al., 2006; Tarrant and
Dodgson, 2007). Increased opportunity for exposure to
breastfeeding is particularly important in geographic areas
where it is still relatively uncommon to see breastfeeding.
One relatively easy way to increase exposure to breast-
feeding in geographic regions where breastfeeding rates are
low is through poster campaigns where breastfeeding images
are visible on the posters. We asked in Study 2 how young
adults would react to seeing breastfeeding posters and
whether the presence of the breastfeeding image would
impact their memory for the accompanying slogan. We
found that when young adults were presented with infant-
feeding posters, they looked at the breastfeeding posters for
significantly less time than the bottle-feeding posters, regard-
less of the task that they were assigned. Even though we are
not able to say with certainty why this is, we know from the
recognition memory test that memory for the slogans used in
these posters was comparable across both poster types, sug-
gesting that shorter looking times on breastfeeding posters
did not jeopardize intake of the accompanying message.
In Study 3, we explicitly asked participants to rate their
comfort level viewing the same breastfeeding and bottle-
feeding images used in Study 2. The comfort ratings
assigned to breastfeeding images were unquestionably
lower than those assigned to the bottle-feeding images,
indicating that participants experienced discomfort when
seeing breastfeeding. Based on these results, it seems likely
that the shorter looking times for breastfeeding posters in
Study 2 also reflect discomfort, especially since looking
times were short across all tasks.
Using breastfeeding images to promote breastfeeding
might help to normalize images of the functional or nurtur-
ing breast, and in the long run, could both reduce the embar-
rassment of seeing breastfeeding and the embarrassment of
being the one to breastfeed in public. This is important
given evidence suggesting that intent to breastfeed and sub-
sequent breastfeeding behavior is lower for women who
express embarrassment about breastfeeding (Bonia et al.,
2013; Hoddinott et al., 2010) and that "not wanting to
breastfeed in public" was cited as being an important rea-
son for discontinuing breastfeeding in a large survey sam-
ple of US mothers (Li et al., 2008). Breastfeeding initiation
is higher among women exposed to breastfeeding through
television or video compared to those with no exposure to
breastfeeding (e.g. Hoddinott et al., 2010). Thus, showing
positive images of breastfeeding in various contexts, such
as poster campaigns, may be one way of increasing expo-
sure and improving comfort level and attitudes over time.
Limitations
This research provides some promising, albeit preliminary,
data to suggest that using breastfeeding images to promote
breastfeeding can be done without jeopardizing the intake
of the accompanying message, even if the viewer might be
uncomfortable seeing the breastfeeding images. Future
research can confirm that individuals who self identify as
being uncomfortable seeing breastfeeding images still pro-
cess any written messages that accompany those images.
It was somewhat surprising that slogan recall was low
overall for both poster types. It is possible that since the
posters were randomly presented such that breastfeeding
posters were intermixed with bottle-feeding posters, the
12 Health Psychology Open 
presence of breastfeeding posters impacted how the bottle-
feeding posters were processed. Further study is needed to
see if this is the case. For example, if presentation of poster
types is blocked, will slogan recall improve for bottle-feed-
ing posters? Another possibility is that since participants
were not explicitly asked to remember the slogans (the
memory test was a surprise), maybe they only minimally
processed the slogans. This is an interesting possibility that
has implications for how posters are processed in general.
Finally, the slogans varied across posters. This is different
from typical poster campaigns where only a few different
slogans are used. Perhaps the slogans would have been
more memorable and recalled more easily if there were
fewer slogans, and if the same slogans were used consist-
ently across posters. These are all possibilities to be
explored in future research. Future research is also needed
to confirm whether the results of this study extend to slo-
gans that are longer in length, and slogans that tend to be
more novel (less catchy) or that seem less familiar.
Conclusion
Despite high intentions to breastfeed, our sample of young
adults reported mixed or negative perceptions of public
reaction to seeing breastfeeding images. This discrepancy
is concerning for two reasons. One, although young adults
may see the value in breastfeeding and may want to breast-
feed, uncertainty in how others will react may hamper this
behavior. Two, these results suggest that young adults are
still getting mixed messages about breastfeeding; breast-
feeding is something to be done but not something to be
seen. Positive exposure to breastfeeding could help ensure
that the messaging around breastfeeding is more uniform
and consistent. This research should alleviate concerns
that using breastfeeding images to promote breastfeeding
might come at a cost to message processing. Our results
suggest that even if viewing time is limited, it is still pos-
sible to take in the messaging paired with breastfeeding
images. We know from past research that exposure to
breastfeeding is linked to intent to breastfeed and positive
attitudes toward breastfeeding (Hoddinott et al., 2010;
Tarrant and Dodgson, 2007), so using breastfeeding images
within promotional campaigns will likely be far more ben-
eficial than it is risky. Not only should increased exposure
to breastfeeding improve overall comfort levels, but it may
also help to narrow the gap that is growing between the
acceptability of bottle-feeding in public and the accepta-
bility of breastfeeding in public.

Notes
1. For a brief overview of the history of infant feeding, see
Stevens et al. (2009).
2. The breastfeeding image was clearly visible on these post-
ers, although they were not central to these posters (i.e. other
items were larger and designed to draw attention to them).
3. We suspect that some participants were confused by the
response option "Euro-Canadian," as many listed "White" or
"Caucasian" beside the "Other" option.
4. We recognize that faster looking times could be interpreted
in multiple ways, including more discomfort or less interest,
both resulting in faster disengagement, or it is also possible
that faster looking times could occur for images with greater
saliency. Regardless of the interpretation, a difference in
looking time between breastfeeding and bottle-feeding pic-
tures would suggest differences in how these two types of
stimuli are processed and that difference is important to
explore further.
5. There were a variety of reasons for incomplete eye move-
ment data, including metal-framed glasses, light-colored
irises, a significant shift in the participant's viewing position
during the testing period, and so on.
6. Participants could respond at any point in time, but if the
response occurred before the observation period had ended,
the poster would remain on display for the full 2000
ms
before being replaced by the next poster.
7. To test whether the picture might have influenced the catego-
rization of slogans, the same slogans used in this study were
given to a new group of 30 participants to be categorized as
positive or negative. Note, in this case, that the slogans were
shown to participants in isolation rather than paired with a pic-
ture. The results indicated that 100percent of the "breastfeed-
ing" slogans, when viewed in isolation, were rated as positive
by the majority of participants, while 80percent of the "bottle-
feeding" slogans were rated as positive. When these results
are compared to the results of the Slogan Assessment task, it
is clear that the slogans were more likely to be rated as nega-
tive when paired with a picture (particularly a bottle-feeding
picture), suggesting that the picture type influenced how the
slogans were judged. This cannot simply be explained by a
difference in time spent on the bottle-feeding versus breast-
feeding posters since this should reflect results more similar
to those found when the slogans were viewed in isolation.
Instead, this difference likely reflects the result of a conscious
Austen et al. 13
assessment of bottle-feeding versus breastfeeding when the
slogans are paired with a picture. That is, if you believe that
breastfeeding is healthy for a baby, you might rate the slogan
"Off to the best start" as negative when it is paired with a bot-
tle-feeding picture because it is inconsistent with the notion
that "Breast is Best." Even though this relative comparison
was not the task assigned to participants, it seems reasonable
to think that the picture could still influence one's assessment
of the slogan. The results of the slogan-picture appropriateness
task lend support to this idea as the slogans that were paired
with the bottle-feeding pictures were more likely to be rated as
inappropriate than those linked to the breastfeeding pictures.
