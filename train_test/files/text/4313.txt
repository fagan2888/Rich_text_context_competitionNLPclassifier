Introduction
Youth Restiveness, one of the many-sided effects of the
seemingly unending Niger Delta crisis, relates to matters of
agitation by youths over issues of deprivation, neglect, mar-
ginalization, and feelings of dissatisfaction. The engagement
by youths in agitation for the restoration of their rights and
dignity or self-seeking and criminal activities, that can be
either constructive (positive) or destructive (negative), is
undoubtedly a hydra-headed socio-economic problem in
Nigeria's Niger Delta. The root cause of the youth restive-
ness in the region is the broad spectrum of laws that have
both colonial inspiration and feudal inclination and the
accompanying actions of the Nigerian state on the country's
oil industry and the age-long regime of environmental degra-
dation due to the mindless operational threats arising from
the oil exploration and production activities of the oil con-
glomerates. The legal/environmental laws that provided the
constitutional foundation did not only create the environ-
ment which is up till today plaguing the Niger Delta region
but also set the stage for the operational menace in which the
region has been engulfed. A deeper insight into the nature of
the collaboration by the three partners in the unholy alliance
can largely be provided, taking cognizance of the fact that
the Nigerian state (pre- and post-colonial) formulates the
policies that create and determine the political and business
environment that are clement for the capitalist development
of the oil industry and the exploitation and underdevelop-
ment of the Niger Delta region. In the face of the far from
legal/environmentally benign laws and the devastating oper-
ational activities of the oil majors and minors, the cosmetic
institutional interventionist efforts of the Nigerian state sup-
posedly meant to close the developmental gaps in the para-
doxically rich-oil treasure-based, but poverty-ridden and
underdeveloped, region failed to achieve any tangible results.
The patently stark environmental injustice that has been the
lot of the Niger Delta region has provided a fertile ground for
the deep-seated youth restiveness that had assumed frighten-
ing militant and anti-developmental dimensions. This study
therefore critically examines the youth restiveness problem-
atic in Nigeria's Niger Delta.
Environment and Youth Restiveness:

Youth Restiveness in the Niger Delta:
A Critical Discourse
Kelly Bryan Ovie Ejumudo1
Abstract
One of the many-sided effects of environmental injustice in the Niger Delta is "Youth Restiveness" which metamorphosed
into proliferation of arms and the emergence of militias that is arguably a threat to the macro-Nigerian environment. This
article, which relied on secondary sources of data, critically examines youth restiveness in the Niger Delta and contends that
the root cause is the legal environmental laws that provided the basis for the operational hazards of the oil conglomerates
that have collaborated with the Nigerian state whose intervention agencies have largely failed to close the developmental
gaps in the region. The article posits that in the face of sundry efforts by the Nigerian state, particularly the infinitesimal 13%
derivation element of the current revenue sharing formula, the failed land use reform attempt, the partially successful short-
run post-amnesty program, and the controversial petroleum industry bill, the central developmental concerns of the Niger
Delta region have not been addressed. The article concludes with some useful recommendations including the exigency of
the modification of the obnoxious and eco-environmentally disadvantageous laws and a holistic developmental approach
and action-based programs by the Nigerian government and oil conglomerates that will provide sustainable windows of
opportunity and safety nets for the socio-economically dislocated youths.

(Karpagam, 2009). Environment is the aggregate of all those
things and set of conditions that directly or indirectly influ-
ence not only the life of organisms but also the communities
at a particular place (Narayanan, 2007). Environment also
includes all the factors prevailing internally and externally or
around and in the plants and animals (Treshow, 1970, cited in
Narayanan, 2007). Environment, in fact, includes natural
resources, both biotic and abiotic, covering not only the natu-
ral environment but also the man-made landscapes, build-
ings, and objects that form part of man's natural heritages
(Thornton & Beckwith, 2007). An environment represents
the surrounding conditions and influences on the whole com-
plex of climatic, edaphic, and biotic factors that act upon an
organism or an ecological community and ultimately deter-
mine its form and survival (Gboyega, 1998). In Nigeria, an
environment is, by statute, defined to include water, air, land,
and all plants and human beings or animals living therein and
the interrelationships that exist among these or any of them
(Federal Environmental Protection Agency [FEPA], 2010).
Ajomo (2010) tended to agree with this definition, as accord-
ing to him, the Nigerian environment is composite in nature.
The environment affects the social, cultural, economic, and
aesthetic existence of man within it and ultimately deter-
mines his survival (Nnanna, Alade, & Odoko, 2003).
Youth restiveness, however, is a situation of the inability
of youths to be still or quiet and difficult to control, espe-
cially when they are unsatisfied with something. It relates to
matters of agitation by youths over issues of deprivation,
neglect, marginalization, and other feelings of dissatisfac-
tion. It can also be viewed as the engagement by youths in
agitation for the restoration of their rights and dignity or self-
seeking and criminal activities. In a similar vein, youth res-
tiveness refers to the reactions by youths, both constructive
(positive) and destructive (negative) to the "use and dump"
mentality and attitude of those considered to be involved in
acts of oppression and repression against their interests. It is
equally a deliberate instrument of organized response to per-
ceived grievances that has an increasing potency and capa-
bility for destruction. Essentially too, youth restiveness is a
manifestation of anxiety that encompasses the dysfunctional
effects of anxiety on human body and the description of the
psychological activities of the body that give vent to anxiety.
It is, in fact, a sustained protestation embarked upon with an
eye to enforcing a desired outcome from a constituted author-
ity by an organized body of youths. It is thus an excess
behavior attribute that is commonly marked by violence and
disruption of lawful activities.
The usage of the word "youth restiveness" became ubiq-
uitous in Nigeria since the wake of the activities of youths in
the oil-bearing communities of the Niger Delta. The phe-
nomenon is usually associated with adolescents because of
the fact that they confront a host of new, varied, and difficult
problems of adjustment that make the search for identity and
a place in society imperative. Ogbeifun (2007) categorized
youth restiveness into three categories--namely, genuine
agitation, self-seeking and criminal activities, and youth on
vengeance mission. Although the term has gained notoriety
in usage, particularly in the Nigerian parlance, it has gradu-
ally assumed a global configuration, despite the fact that a
standard and generally acceptable definition is yet to evolve.
Theoretical Framework
Although there are several theories for explaining facts gen-
erated in research endeavors, for purpose of this study, the
"Strain Theory of Deviance and the Frustration Theory"
were adopted. This became expedient because all the factors
that are commonly advanced as an explanation for youth res-
tiveness can be located in the above context due to the fact
that they all relate to the bottom line, which is dissatisfaction
and unrealized goals.
The "Strain" theory as propounded by Merton (1968)
contends that deviant behavior results not from pathological
personalities; rather, it is a consequence of the culture and
structure of society itself. He reasoned that because all mem-
bers of the society are placed in different strata of the social
structure, they do not have the same access to the realization
of their shared values and goals. The shared values and goals
translate into cultural goals which could be material posses-
sion, educational attainment, and significant others. Merton
further noted that people feel strained when they are incapa-
ble of meeting the cultural goals to which they are exposed
owing to inaccessibility to the culturally approved and
acceptable means of realizing the goals. The tendency there-
fore is to resort to deviant and unacceptable means.
In the same vein, the "Frustration" theory presupposes
that a continuing or unresolved motivational conflict is a
source of frustration (Atkinson & Atkinson, 1975). This the-
ory argues that when a person's progress toward a desired
goal is blocked, delayed, or otherwise interfered with, he or
she encounters frustration. Blocked goal seeking therefore
produces confusion, bewilderment, and annoyance.
Frustration, by implication, connotes an event rather than an
emotional state; thwarting circumstances rather than their
consequences. Apart from the various types of conflict that
provide a major source of human frustration, there are other
barriers to the satisfaction of drives (Atkinson & Atkinson,
1975). Frustration, whether it is the result of obstacles, defi-
ciencies, or conflict, has both immediate and remote conse-
quences. This viewpoint is premised on the reasoning that
when blocked in goal seeking, the individual or youth may
react immediately or develop attitudes toward uncertainty or
risktakingthathasmoreenduringconsequences.Restlessness
and tensions are usually associated with many actions indi-
cating unhappiness, dissatisfaction, and frustration and
closely related to increased tensions; and restless movements
are the rage states that lead to destructiveness and hostile
attacks that have become commonplace in the Niger Delta
environment. Although aggression is often the result of frus-
trating circumstances, an explanation of aggression based
Ejumudo 3
solely on environmental influences is incomplete. Because
of the problems inherent in the original version of the frustra-
tion­aggression hypothesis, Berkowitz (1965) suggested
three alterations to the theory. He opined that emotional reac-
tion does not compulsorily cause aggression, but it creates a
predisposition for aggressive acts.
The above reality is typical of the Niger Delta youths who
have little or no access to the environmental opportunities of
their region due to the insensitivity and neglect that charac-
terize or underpin the activities and roles of the Nigerian
state in an unholy alliance with the oil multi-nationals and
the local bourgeoisie. Thus, the inability of the youths to
actualize their goals through the institutionalized means in
the face of the opportunities that abound in their environment
has produced strains and frustrations culminating in all
shapes of social problems and deviant practices that conse-
quently pose serious threats to the same micro (Niger Delta)
environment and the macro (Nigerian state) environment.
The strain theory of deviance and the frustration theory
therefore have the utilitarian explanatory value for the youth
restiveness and the attendant militancy activities in the Niger
Delta region of Nigeria.
Root Cause and Legal Environment of
Youth Restiveness
Nigerian legislation on petroleum predated exploration
activities or efforts in Nigeria. The first piece of legislation
was the Petroleum Ordinance of 1889 that was followed by
the Mineral Regulation (Oil) Ordinance of 1907, both of
which provided the basic legal framework for the develop-
ment of petroleum and its natural resources (Omorogbe,
2001). To a very significant degree, the nature of the colonial
and post-colonial Nigerian state is largely structurally the
same, for the broad spectrum of laws and accompanying
actions of the Nigerian state on the country's oil industry
have been no less an extension of the 1914 Mineral Act that
vested all powers over resources (solid and liquid) on the
state as Omoweh (2006) rightly articulated. For instance, the
post-colonial state like its predecessor has the exclusive right
to issue mineral prospecting and mining licenses and the sole
power to collect royalties, rents, and fees from the oil compa-
nies. Both the Petroleum Act of 1969 and the Land Use
Decree of 1978 are complementary and designed to
strengthen the instrument of oppression, suppression, mar-
ginalization, dispossession, deprivation, and disempower-
ment of the Niger Delta people by the state in collaboration
with its allies, the multi-national oil corporations, and the
local bourgeoisie.
The origin of the law in Nigeria is traceable to a similar
law enacted by the British in Northern Nigeria, inspired by
English tradition that vested all land on the English Crown
(Constitutional Rights Project [CRP], 1999). The law can
therefore be described as one of colonial inspiration and
feudal inclination. Arguably, no where else in Nigeria has the
impact of the Land Use Decree manifested in alt its ramifica-
tions and inequities as in the Niger Delta, Nigeria's main oil-
producing region. The Land Use Decree also sought
accommodation for the oil companies who need land for vir-
tually all its operations. In fact, the oil giants need land for
exploration, production, transportation of crude oil by pipe-
line, construction of oil terminal stations, flare sites, airstrips,
offices, and staff quarters. This partly explains the logic
behind the content of the Land Use Decree that also provided
a buffer for the oil giants to be more reckless in their opera-
tions. This may also be a part explanation for why Shell, for
instance, can afford to flare gas on a daily basis since 1956
when it discovered oil in the Niger Delta and yet be shielded
by the state over litigations on land where oil is explored or
produced (Omoweh, 2006). Land protection in the light of
sustainability was, as a result, and is still not of any interest
to the state that gradually rendered the Niger Delta people
into paupers through successive legislation including the
Petroleum and Land Use and squatters in their own land.
Thus, the entire structure of the macroecological climate in
which the Niger Delta is embedded and that has seriously
stifled its development or facilitated its underdevelopment is
predicated and premised on the legal environment that is the
root cause and foundation of youth restiveness in the region.
Operational Activities of Oil
Conglomerates as Accentuation of
the Legal Environment of Youth
Restiveness in the Niger Delta Region
Since 1956, when the then Shell­British Petroleum (BP)
struck oil in commercial quantities at Oloibiri in the Niger
Delta after an investment of more than N30 million in 1950,
crude oil exploration, production, and transportation activi-
ties have been on in the region with the first export of
Nigeria's crude oil in 1957 (Ejumudo, 2005). Within 10
years, which is on the eve of the Nigerian civil war, produc-
tion had reached about 500,000 barrels a day, thus establish-
ing Nigeria as a significant oil producer (Owoeye &
Ojakorotu, 2002). The post-1956 era saw the emergence of
several other multi-national operators in Nigeria, including
Mobil (now Mobil Exxon) in 1955, Tenneco in 1960, and
Gulf (which later became Chevron and Texaco, which are
now merged and today known as Chevron­Texaco) in 1965
(Aturu, 1989; Ejumudo, 2005). With the full-blown oil
exploration and production activities of the oil giants in the
oil-bearing communities of Nigeria, several issues including
environmental degradation, poverty, marginalization,
resource control, and outright underdevelopment of the
Niger Delta region have surfaced and constituted unending
sources of conflict including youth restiveness.
The beginning point of any fruitful assessment of the alli-
ance between the state, its local bourgeoisie, and the oil
4 SAGE Open
multi-nationals is to see the state as a contested terrain where
there is group interest and power play. The alliance of the
three actors, namely, the state, oil giants, and the domestic
bourgeoisie also determines the dependence of the Nigerian
state on the oil surpluses and integration into global oil rela-
tions. The alliance of the trio and the dependency elements,
exploitative structural basis, and the constraining underde-
velopment effects is understood taking cognizance of the his-
torical circumstances of the Nigerian state that conspired to
produce a domestic bourgeoisie (elite group) that has no
sense of identify, integrity, and confidence (Ake, 1992, 2005;
Ejumudo, 2005).
That the alliance of the Nigerian state with the oil giants
and the domestic bourgeoisie has played a dominant role in
the underdevelopment of the Niger Delta is indubitable. The
choice of the word "underdevelopment" is predicated on the
understanding that the region has prospects for development
but not potentialities for same due to the laws, policies,
actions, and operations of the trio (three actors) in the alli-
ance that has produced stagnation and retrogression in the
region (Jhingan, 2009). The role of the oil giants (transna-
tional corporations) as agents of underdevelopment in the
developing world has for long been acknowledged and high-
lighted (Omoweh, 2006; Rodney, 1986). The legal/constitu-
tional foundation did not only create the environment that is
up till today plaguing the Niger Delta region but also set the
stage for the operational menace in which the region has
been engulfed. A deeper insight into the nature of the col-
laboration by the three partners in the unholy alliance can
largely be provided, taking cognizance of the fact that the
Nigerian state (pre- and post-colonial) formulates the poli-
cies that create and determine the political and business envi-
ronment that are clement for the capitalist development of
the oil industry and the exploitation and underdevelopment
of the Niger Delta region. The effects of the exploration,
exploitation, production, and transportation activities of the
oil companies including gas flaring have been devastating to
the rich-oil region called the "Niger Delta." The mass of the
people of the region are therefore pauperized through rural
poverty that is foisted on them.
A Critical Discourse of Youth
Restiveness as Agitation and Response
to the Operational Environment in the
Niger Delta
In the early days of the oil industry in Nigeria, exploration
and production activities of transnational companies (TNCs)
were at a relatively low level, less visible and intrusive than
they are presently. Oil-bearing communities were thriving on
their traditional vocations of farming and artisanal fishing
for which they depended essentially on land, watershed, and
natural resources that were fertile, unpolluted, and highly
productive. Industrial and population pressures on land and
water resource were yet unknown in most of the communi-
ties (Onosode, 2006). Today, as a result of the increasing pro-
file of exploration and production activities owing to the
involvement of many oil majors and minors, the Niger Delta
region has been a victim of environmental pollution and deg-
radation. The same land that was productive has given way
to the deteriorating effects of the operations of the oil con-
glomerates. Shell Petroleum Development Company
(SPDC), the oil conglomerate on behalf of the Nigerian
National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC)/Shell/Elf/Agip
Joint Venture as at 1996, operated oil mining licenses cover-
ing an area of more than 31,000 sq km. The company oper-
ated an extensive network of about 900 producing oil wells,
100 flow stations/gas plants, 4,500 m of oil and gas flow
lines, and more than 1,500 km of trunk lines through which
oil flows from the aggregates of overlapping and superim-
posed pools of accumulations of petroleum located in the
geological structures of the oil region to the two major termi-
nals at Bonny and Forcados (Ejumudo, 2005).
Arguably, the proportion of land take is far more signifi-
cant than it seems, considering the fact that the Niger Delta
constitutes one of Nigeria's most difficult geographical ter-
rain and a significant proportional (of about two thirds) is
made up of water or at best is riverine. There is therefore a
limited, usable land. The accompanying effect is that in
many areas of the region, there is land hunger, especially as
oil companies cut up and confiscate farmlands with the legal
backing of the state. As land is farmed into oil concessions,
degrading of natural resources on the land commonly results
in death of the land that is marked by declining productivity
and rural­urban migration is intensified. In fact, valuable
portions of farmland, lowland, fresh water swamp forest, and
mangrove resources have been degraded and such loss of
habitat and resources in the oil communities that depend on
natural resources is devastated, leaving the people in a
vicious cycle of poverty (Onosode, 2006). The trail of natu-
ral resource degradation in places such as Oloibiri, Kokori,
Sangama, Boma, and other oil-bearing communities are
testimonial.
Associated implications of the operations of the oil con-
glomerates in the Niger Delta region are oil spillage, gas flar-
ing, and pipeline vandalization. While oil spillages occur at
various stages of product handling, from exploration to pro-
duction through refining to distribution and marketing, no
less than 96% of the spills are associated with the exploration
and production and therefore localized in the producing areas
(Roberts, 2005). Over the years, oil companies have spilt
much oil in the region. Between 1976 and 2006, there were
9,005 reported cases of oil spills with a spillage of about 10.1
million barrels of which only 2.4 barrels were recovered,
while the rest were retained in the environment. About 6,500
m barrels of oil were spilt in 700 separate incidences each
year in Rivers, Delta, Bayelsa, and Akwa Ibom states (World
Bank, 2008). In January 1998 alone, about 40,000 barrels of
light crude leaked from a Mobil Producing Unlimited
Ejumudo 5
pipeline at Eket in Akwa Ibom state. The incidences of spills
and their impact are varied across the ecological zones, with
more spillages in land than swamp and offshore operations.
This impact of spills on the Niger Delta environment is more
revealing in view of the fact that Nigerian crude is very toxic
and chemical dispersants often used to clean up spills tend to
aggravate the damage on the aquatic environment. In addi-
tion, dispersants merely make spills more soluble and rela-
tively invisible to the eye, but they do not remove the toxicity
(Ayonote, 2005). The long-term effects of oil spills can be
very enduring largely because the devastation of plants and
farmlands continue insofar as spilled oil blocks oxygen sup-
ply and destroys essential nutrients in the soil such as magne-
sium and nitrogen.
As far as gas flaring is concerned, across the Niger Delta,
oil conglomerates burn off gas from hundreds of oil wells in
huge fires. The disposal of associated gas has been a major
challenge to the region and the Nigerian state. On the aver-
age, roughly 1,000 standard cubic feet (scf) of gas is pro-
duced in Nigeria with every barrel of oil. With oil production
of about 2.0 billion scf of associated gas is produced every
day. Nigeria flares more gas than any other country in the
world, for the country is estimated as being responsible for a
quarter of global flares (Onosode, 2006). World Bank (2009)
estimated that Nigeria flares about 75% of the gas it pro-
duces due to lack of a local market and infrastructure. Apart
from the fact that gas flares constitute a massive and monu-
mental waste of a valuable national financial and energy
resource, they cause significant environmental damage, prin-
cipally because they kill vegetation, suppress the growth of
some plants, and diminish agricultural production. The dys-
functional effects of the exploration and production activities
of the oil conglomerates and operators in Nigeria since the
close of the 1950s have not only become a hydra-headed
problem but also raised many concerns and attracted the
attention of environmental and human rights activists, devel-
opment scholars, and research experts, as well as multi-lay-
ered levels of government.
In respect of pipeline vandalization, the Niger Delta has a
hotbed of crisis. This is because the youth commonly resort
to cutting of flow lines and destruction of oil facilities
belonging to oil companies or the NNPC. In 1998, for
instance, agitated youth vandalized NNPC's pipelines at
Jesse in Ethiope Local Government Area of Delta State in
Nigeria. Later, about 1,000 people went there to siphon
petroleum products from the man-ruptured pipelines and
they were killed in the inferno (Okecha, 2011). Also, in
March 2000, more than 50 persons including children died in
a raging inferno at the site of a vandalized NNPC pipeline at
Nnejiji and Umuegbede, both in Ngwa Local Government
Area of Abia State. Later in July 2000, 300 persons including
youth were killed following an explosion on a vandalized oil
pipeline at Egborode village in Okpe Local Government
Area of Delta State. The fire did not spare the fauna and flora
as hundreds of hectares of farmlands were reduced to ashes.
In fact, statistics on pipeline vandalization in Niger Delta
show a total of 3,200 cases between 1993 and 2007 ("Pipeline
Vandalization in the Niger Delta," 2009).
Cognizant of the above operational dysfunctionality of
the oil exploration and production activities of the oil con-
glomerates in the oil-rich Niger Delta region stimulated by
the legal/constitutional environmental laws that empowered
the Nigerian state, emboldened the oil companies and simul-
taneously disempowered the oil-bearing communities and
the peripherally superficial, but failed, state institutionalized
interventionist efforts to close the development gaps of the
region, it is incumbent upon this study to locate and contex-
tualize youth restiveness in the explanatory field of the strain
conception of deviance and the frustration perspective of
Merton and Atkinson, respectively. It is instructively sequen-
tial to add that it is the blocked or delayed access to socio-
economic developmental opportunities and the consequential
failure by the youths of the region to realize their shared val-
ues and goals that produced confusion, bewilderment, and
annoyance. One of the many-sided effects of the environ-
mental injustice in the Niger Delta is therefore "Youth
Restiveness."
The frustrated and agitated youth of the Niger Delta first
responded to the prevailing unacceptable and detestable
environmental and socio-economic situation through pleas
and demands, but eventually with sundry forms of political
contestation, including violence to life and property (Okafor-
Ofiebor, 1997). A more eloquent and sophisticated response
was the pioneering struggle for the Movement for the
Survival of Ogoni People (MOSOP) championed by Saro-
Wiwa and his Ogoni kinsmen. The movement launched a
vigorous local and international campaign for the ownership
of the oil in the area. The campaign was guided by the Ogoni
Bill of Rights issued in 1990 that demanded for the political
control of Ogoni affairs by Ogoni people, control and use of
a fair proportion of Ogoni economic resources for Ogoni
development, and the right to protect the Ogoni environment
and economy from further development. Beyond the fact that
other Niger Delta groups have the same agenda was the
demand by the Ogoni people for the abrogation of the Land
Use Decree and the Petroleum Decree.
The non-violent approach was like a dialogue with the
deaf, for neither the state nor the oil conglomerates paid suf-
ficient attention. The Niger Delta youth thereafter opted for
threats and protests during which time oil companies were
warned to discontinue their operations in the region. On
August 17, 1997, more than 10,000 youths from across the
Niger Delta converged Aleibiri in Bayelsa state to protest the
environmental degradation caused by SPDC. A retired navy
lieutenant from Aleibiri was quoted to have said that the
Niger Delta people would fight until there is freedom in the
Niger Delta because they have been exploited for so long
(Osaghae, 1995). The agitated youths more often than not
direct their violent protests at oil conglomerates because the
latter are perceived not just as the direct culprits in their
6 SAGE Open
plight but also as the most proximate government agents.
Such protests took the form of blockade of and sabotage to
oil installations (Mabro, 1997). The Niger Delta youths
eventually went beyond the sabotage of oil installations to an
attack of the personnel of oil companies. In 1997, for
instance, a gang of armed youths attacked and closed down
six flow stations in Delta state, taking 127 personnel hostage
and shutting in 10,000 bpd of oil. It took 6 days of negotia-
tions to get the hostages released. Subsequently, 15 contract
staff on board a supply convoy were kidnapped and detained
for more than 3 weeks (Anderson, 1996).
Notably, it was the increased anger in the oil-bearing
communities with the crude and exploitative activities of the
oil companies and the growing perception of federal govern-
ment's tacit endorsement of same that resulted in youth res-
tiveness and the formation of activist youth organizations
and militia groups in the Niger Delta. Between 1990 and
1999, at least 24 of such groups were formed that intensified
struggles, often with violent outcomes, against the compa-
nies and federal (state) agents and agencies such as the police
and the armed forces (Jega, 2007). Many of these groups
have made declarations that emphasize self-assertion and
autonomy in the control of resources and management of the
affairs of the communities in the Niger Delta. The groups
include the Ogoni Bill of Rights, the Kaiama Declaration, the
Aklaka Declaration of the Egbi people, the Oron Bill of
Rights; the Warri Accord, and the Resolutions of the First
Urhobo summit. In May 2006, for instance, the Movement
for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta (MEND) said, "there
will be no rest for the Nigerian government and collaborating
oil companies until all the stolen oil is returned to its rightful
owners with compensation for all the years of theft and slav-
ery" and the group had vigorously sponsored several violent
protests and instigated many kidnapping in the region
(International Crisis Group, 2006, p. 20).
Essentially, MEND criticized the piecemeal and divide-
and-rule approach to the development of the Niger Delta
region and described the Niger Delta Development
Commission (NDDC) as a channel for further looting of the
meager sums allocated to developing the Niger Delta
(International Crisis Group, 2006). In protesting the approach
of the Nigerian government and oil multi-nationals to the
development of the Niger Delta region, the organized groups,
with their sophisticated weaponry, have since December
2005, adopted the strategy of hostage taking that targets for-
eign oil workers and prominent Nigerian citizens. In fact,
violent crimes, including politically and financially moti-
vated contract killings, cult wars, hostage taking, kidnap-
ping, arson, pipeline, and oil installation vandalization did
not only worsen the precarious security situation in the Niger
Delta (Ikporukpo, 2007) but also equally threatened the daily
existence of the citizens and the corporate integrity of
Nigeria, especially with the proliferation of arms that is argu-
ably a threat to the macro-Nigerian environment and its sus-
tainable development.
The implications of youth restiveness that are manifold
include colossal damage to oil installations; loss of human
lives; global warming; loss of rare plants and animals; ther-
mal pollution of air, water, and land; loss of sources of liveli-
hood; respiratory diseases; and destruction of social services.
Others include downturn in oil production capacity and rev-
enue generation in the Nigerian state; disempowerment and
socio-economic dislocation of the Niger Delta youth who
cannot reproduce themselves in the face of the poverty-
inflicting and pauperizing environment, apart from the ulti-
mate deprivation of the region and its youth from contributing
to the enhancement of the productivity indicators that are
critically needed for national development initiatives, aspira-
tions, and attainments; and the unprecedented peace-time
security challenges that constitute a potential threat to the
corporate existence of the Nigerian state. For instance,
according to a former vice president of Nigeria, Atiku
Abubakar, the country lost N4.4 billion due to 400 pipeline
damages in the oil region between January and August, 2000
("Nigeria Loses to Pipeline Damages in the Niger Delta,"
2000).
More importantly, the serious implication of the human
dimension of youth restiveness in the Niger Delta is evident
in the fact that the youth are the energetic segment whose
energy could be galvanized to productive work for individ-
ual, community, and national development. The marginaliza-
tion of the youth in the region and their engagement in
destructive and unproductive acts have not only resulted in
socio-economic unprogressive order but also denied the
country the services of a core group of people who must
invariably form the backbone of the future. Involving the
youth in development therefore requires a conscious process
of voluntary participation and it encapsulates three phases of
unfreezing, change, and refreezing as Lewin (1948) rightly
articulated. After all, a state with inbuilt socio-economic
deprivation or marginalization outcomes cannot but lead to
socio-economic and political exclusion.
The Failed Piecemeal Institutional
Measures of the Nigerian State to
the Niger Delta Crisis and Youth
Restiveness
The challenges of development; that is to say the underdevel-
opment of the Niger Delta region of Nigeria is as old as the
colonial dispensation. These challenges range from the
absence of basic social amenities and infrastructure to short-
age of skilled manpower and socio-economic dislocations
caused principally by blocked access to wealth. This anoma-
lous state of affairs was admitted by the Willinks Commission
of 1958 in its recommendations to the then Colonial
Government, shortly before Nigeria attained independence
in 1960. The only remedy that the Commission proffered to
assuage the agitated people of the Niger Delta region was the
Ejumudo 7
creation of the Niger Delta Basin Development Authority
(NDBDA) in 1959 to cater for the developmental needs and
aspirations of the region. However, the impact of the
NDBDA, which was supposedly an interventionist agency,
was so infinitesimal and inconsequential that it can at best be
described as an abysmal failure.
In 1992, the Babangida regime created the Oil Mineral
Producing Areas Development Commission (OMPADEC) to
replace the Presidential Task Force established by his admin-
istration in 1988, which was an abysmal failure. Although
the Commission was originally construed as a developmen-
tal strategy to cater for the needs of the oil-bearing communi-
ties, it became overtly clear that it was political machinery
designed to serve the purpose of the self-seeking military
junta through the erection of a clientele of political support-
ers in the Niger Delta. The OMPADEC essentially deepened
the misery of the people of the region given the political
motive behind its creation and operations as mostly evident
in the kind of projects that it embarked upon in the oil region
and the manner it awarded the contracts (Omoweh, 2006).
OMPADEC was therefore to any critical and discerning
mind, a fraudulent venture, a financial jamboree or spree,
and a state institutional framework to further the exploitation
of the already pauperized and devastated Niger Delta people
(Jega, 2007).
The major policy instrument by which the Obasanjo
administration pretended to use to intervene in the Niger
Delta crisis is the NDDC. This Commission was expected to
be an improvement on the woeful performance of the defunct
NDBDA, OMPADEC, and the ill-fated Petroleum Trust
Fund (PTF) that was established by the Abacha administra-
tion supposedly to improve infrastructure in the entire coun-
try, but which neglected the Niger Delta region. The NDDC
was, however, not significantly different from the previous
deliberately designed failed efforts of the ill-fated state so-
called interventionist-development agencies because the
thinking of the state and its allies in the exploitation and
underdevelopment of the Niger Delta has not altered.
The Yar'adua administration with its sincerity and com-
mitment posturing has promised a holistic approach to the
Niger Delta crisis and intends to actualize a Niger Delta
Development Plan, yet he clearly stated that the Federal
Government's contributory share to the NDDC's funds in the
sum of 224 Billion Naira (N224b) that was not paid by the
Obasanjo's administration had expired. The level of indebt-
edness currently stands at more than 360 Billion Naira
(N360b). The administration also created the ministry of
Niger Delta affairs and put in place an amnesty program.
While the former was supposedly meant to facilitate the
development of the region, the later was probably designed
to stop the menace of militancy and the accompanying das-
tardly acts of the armed Niger Delta youths whose reactions
and responses had steadily and stoutly been against the
unending regime of neglect, oppression, marginalization,
and pauperization by the Nigerian state in collaboration with
the oil conglomerates and the local bourgeoisie. The Niger
Delta ministry initiative has turned out to be a mockery
because it has not achieved anything as far as the develop-
ment of the region is concerned and the amnesty program has
only succeeded in selectively getting some of the militant
youths to accept pardon and participate in training programs
that will enable them to acquire skills that will enhance their
living standards. All the same, neither the over 1 year 3
months administration of President Goodluck Jonathan nor
the Niger Delta ministry has been able initiate and execute
infrastructural development projects to tangibly address the
hydra-headed nature of underdevelopment that the oil-rich
region had been enmeshed in and rehabilitate the teeming
youths who are desperately in need of safety nets.
On the whole, the failed piecemeal institutional measures
of the Nigerian state, despite the creation of the Niger Delta
Ministry by the Yar'adua/Jonathan administration, are such
that one can safely summarize that there has been a superfi-
cial tinkering with the burning issues that concern the collec-
tive destiny of the Niger Delta people. The bottom line of
this deliberate approach that reveals the insincerity, negli-
gence, and lack of commitment on the part of the state and its
elite is the demonstration of the hollowness of the mission
and the deceit of the vision behind the cosmetic and dubious
so-called development-based state intervention agencies.
Therefore, the various factors ranging from social, political
to environmental and economic factors commonly adduced
as responsible for youth restiveness in the Niger Delta envi-
ronment can, in actuality, be situated in and explained by
both the "Strain and Frustration" theories.
Efforts at Addressing the Youth
Restiveness Palaver in Nigeria's Niger
Delta
Sundry attempts have been made by different governments
in Nigeria to tackle the Niger Delta crisis and its youth res-
tiveness dimension. Some of such attempts include the appli-
cation of the derivation principle in revenue allocation
arithmetic, the unsuccessful land use reform of the Yar'adua
administration, the short-run partially successful amnesty
program, and the petroleum industry bill that is still under the
legislative process at the National Assembly. Below is an
expository critical discussion of the different efforts.
In respect of the derivation principle element of the reve-
nue allocation regimes in Nigeria, the genesis of revenue
allocation in Nigeria was in 1946 when the Colonial
Government established the Phillipson fiscal commission.
From that time till today, several commissions had been
established and section 162 (2) of the 1999 constitution spec-
ified some revenue sharing or distribution principles or crite-
ria. They include derivation, even development, needs,
national interest, fiscal autonomy, equality of states, popula-
tion, expenditure capacity, land mass, internal revenue
8 SAGE Open
generation, terrain, primary school enrollment, and the like.
The controversy over an acceptable federal arrangement and
the basis for fiscal federalism in Nigeria has been a raging
and troublous one. The fact that the matter still remains prob-
lematic after 53 years of independent status sounds paradoxi-
cal (Ejumudo, 2010). In the face of the numerous revenue
allocation commissions and plethora of formulas, the conten-
tious and political nature of fiscal federalism and the con-
comitant revenue sharing palaver exhibits the hollowness
and inefficacy of the many failed efforts at redressing the fis-
cal imbalance or inequity and the pseudo as well as the quasi
nature of Nigeria's federal arrangement where the central
government is too powerful, domineering, and high-handed
to the extent that the Obasanjo-led government seized the
funds meant for Lagos state councils because of the local
government development authorities that were created by the
immediate past Tinubu-led administration of Lagos state.
Thus, the concern about the mismatch between expenditure
levels and revenue bases is central to and, as a consequence,
it is not strange to federal systems or arrangements. The
structural and foundational defect of the Nigerian federal
union and experiment does not only have the potency of
making fiscal issues prone to crisis but also has actually
largely made the Nigerian federal arrangement a laughing
stock.
Of all the burning issues in Nigeria's fiscal federalism, the
most controversial and apparent locus or terrain of contest is
the derivation principle palaver. This principle is the only
one in the revenue sharing system that allows money to be
appropriately returned back to the state or source and base of
natural resources. No wonder, derivation principle has come
to be equated with the consciousness and efforts at the actu-
alization of resource control in the Nigerian political terrain.
Over the years, the controversy over the use of derivation
principle center on the infinitesimal and inconsequential
value in the weighting system of the various revenue alloca-
tion efforts and formula. With the exception of the Nigerian
first republic and the post-1999 democratic experience, deri-
vation principle had attracted as little as 1% of the federation
account. In fact, while the various minority groups in the
Niger Delta have continually pressed for a fair and better
deal or compensation in the revenue sharing arithmetic of
Nigeria given the centrality of their states in the revenue cal-
culation of the country, the Nigerian leadership, especially
the military cabal have coercively employed the apparatus of
the state to effectively contain the opposition of the minori-
ties to government's imposition. They have also cosmetically
and superficially tinkered with the issue that concerns the
collective destiny of the mineral-bearing communities and
states as evident in the slow and tortuous journey that culmi-
nated in the progression from 1% to the present 13% deriva-
tion formula.
Against the background of the 50% derivation arrange-
ment that favored other regions in the entity called Nigeria
before the current petro-dollar mono-cultural economic
environment, it is not hyperbolic to describe the gap as fiscal
injustice. This injustice problem is further compounded by
the general failure of most governments in the Niger Delta to
judiciously utilize their revenue for genuine developmental
purposes. This may be a fruitful point to state, possibly in all
certitude, that the fiscal federalism endless problematic has a
devastating political economy underlying force. It is thus
instructive to note that the superimposition of the military's
unitary command structure on the pre-military federal sys-
tem and the growth and centrality of oil revenue engendered
a confused form of intergovernmental fiscal relations and
substantial changes in the fiscal landscape. Regrettably, the
decades of military governance in Nigeria did not only
entrench authoritarianism and autocracy in Nigeria's federal
arrangement but also accentuated the ideology of centraliza-
tion of power and resources at the center and engendered the
neglect of the Niger Delta in terms of infrastructure develop-
ment. This made Nigeria's federalism with all its elements of
unitarism to be pseudo and quasi in nature.
Concerning the land use reform initiative of the President
Umaru Musa Yar'adua administration, a committee was set
up to address relevant issues, particularly the need to restrict
the requirement for a governor's consent in land transactions
to assignments only. Following the presentation of the Report
of the Committee on land use reforms, President Yar'adua
forwarded a bill to the National Assembly for some amend-
ments to Land Use Act to be known as the Land Use
(Amendment) Act 2009. The bill sought to score off seven
sections of the existing act, which was originally enacted on
March 29, 1978. The act did not pass through the crucible of
any parliamentary debate from which one could have dis-
cerned the objectives of the legislators. However, from its
preamble, the inalienable right of every Nigerian to partake
of land, a major factor of production, was deducible. That
explains why not a few Nigerians initially rejoiced at the
promulgation of the Decree (now an Act, entrenched in the
1999 Constitution by virtue of Section 315 thereof). The
Land Use Act, except for a few of its provisions, is based,
almost verbatim, on the 1962 Land Tenure Law of the defunct
Northern Region, which, in turn, derived its existence from
the report of the Perry Girard Committee. That Committee
had recommended that
a declaratory Proclamation should be passed to the effect that
the land of the Protectorate should be under the control and
dominion of the Government, and that no title to the occupation,
use, or enjoyment of any land is valid without the assent of the
Government.
This colonial report-turned-law, however, did not omit a
recommendation that "the control and dominion of
Government should be exercised in any particular case with
due regard to lawful customs proved to exist at present in the
province or district where the land is situated." The latter rec-
ommendation was reprehensibly ignored both by the Land
Ejumudo 9
Tenure Law of 1962 and by its successor, the Land Use Act,
1978.
Section 5 of the Act makes it lawful for a Governor to
grant statutory rights of occupancy "in respect of land,
whether or not in an urban area, to any person for all pur-
poses and to demand rentals for any such land granted to any
person," while Sections 21 and 22 make it unlawful to alien-
ate by assignment, mortgage, transfer of possession, sub-
lease, or otherwise howsoever a customary or statutory right
of occupancy without the consent of the appropriate Local
Government Area or Governor, respectively. Section 26 ren-
ders null and void any instrument that purports to confer on
or vest in any person any interest or right over land other than
in accordance with the provisions of the act. Other offensive
sections include 34 (8) and 35 (7) relating to the transfer of
undeveloped land in an urban area without the prior consent
(in writing) of the Governor. By subjecting to consent all
transactions in the land, including alienation by assignment,
mortgage to banks, transfer of possession, and sublease, the
act has created a dead set against rapid socio-economic
development, over the years.
For the Niger Delta region, the land use reform initiated
by President Yar'adua should have checked the high-handed-
ness of the oil companies that are aware of the over-lordship
of the Nigerian state and the near squatters' status of the oil-
bearing communities. This understanding by the oil con-
glomerates may be a part explanation for why Shell, for
instance, can afford to flare gas on a daily basis since 1956
when it discovered oil in the Niger Delta and yet be shielded
by the state over litigations on land where oil is explored or
produced (Omoweh, 2006). Land protection in the light of
sustainability was, as a result, and is still not of any interest
to the state that gradually rendered the Niger Delta people
into paupers and squatters in their own land through succes-
sive legislation including the Petroleum and Land Use Acts.
Apart from the fact that the Land Use Act reform would have
made land available and accessible to the people so as to
increase home-ownership levels (Yar'adua, 2007), other eco-
nomic activities such as agriculture, industries, and tourism
would have benefited from the review or amendment of the
Act. Worthy of note is the United Arab Emirate (UAE) that is
today a world tourism destination simply because of the
changes it made in its land rules. Specifically, in 2002, UAE
liberalized its land rules, which gave foreigners freedom to
acquire land and develop the same. Today, the story is what
we see as Masdar City in Abu Dhabi; Burj Dubai and Burj
Al-Arab, both in Dubai; all these attract millions of dollar
revenue to the emirate. Regrettably, however, it beats every
genuine imagination that several years after, nothing has
been heard in respect of its reading, not to talk of its debate.
As a step toward resolving the protracted insecurity in the
Niger Delta, the Federal Government of Nigeria on June 25,
2009, proclaimed unconditional amnesty for agitators in the
oil-bearing communities of the Niger Delta region. The
terms of the amnesty included the willingness and readiness
of the agitators to surrender their arms, unconditionally
renounce militancy, and sign an undertaking in this direction.
In return, the government pledged its commitment to insti-
tute programs to assist the disarmament, demobilization,
rehabilitation, and reintegration of repentant ex-agitators.
The key objective of the Amnesty Program is to address the
insecurity conditions in the Niger Delta as a prerequisite for
promoting economic development in the region in particu-
larly and in the country as a whole. Since the proclamation of
amnesty for the agitators, relative peace and fragile security
have returned to the once volatile Niger Delta. From a paltry
700 barrels per day in the first week in January 2009, the
relative peace that now prevails in the Niger Delta has aided
the remarkable growth of Nigeria's oil production to between
2.4 and 2.6 million barrels per day.
Pursuant to the core objectives of demobilizing, rehabili-
tating, and reintegrating the former agitators into the Nigerian
society, all the 26,358 persons enrolled in the first and sec-
ond phases of the program have successfully gone through
non-violence training at a demobilization camp in Obubra, a
community in Cross River State. For the demobilization
exercise, the Federal Government engaged experts from
Nigeria, South Africa, and the United States. Following the
completion of their non-violence training and career classifi-
cation in the camp, the Federal Government successfully
placed a total of 10,395 former combatants in skills acquisi-
tion/training centers as well as in formal education within the
country and offshore. Similarly, 12,000 ex-agitators were
sent to their reintegration centers to pursue either formal edu-
cation or vocational training. In all, the beneficiaries of the
amnesty program are as at today in 36 local training centers
in 12 States of the Federation; while the ex-agitators placed
in offshore educational and skill acquisition centers are in the
United States, Italy, Russia, South Africa, Malaysia, United
Kingdom, Israel, Sri Lanka, India, Benin Republic, Cyprus,
Poland, Ghana, Belarus, UAE, the Philippines, Trinidad and
Tobago, Greece, Germany, and Canada.
Arguably, the amnesty offer was President Yar'adua's last
ditch solution to the age-long multi-dimensional crisis in the
Niger Delta region. The crisis in the region had reached a
crescendo with militant activities ranging from kidnapping
of expatriates (and even Nigerian) workers in the oil sector to
blowing up of flow stations and outright criminality. The
amnesty was a political solution to a problem that seemed to
have defied other solutions. Before the granting of amnesty,
President Yar'adua had tried other solutions such as drawing
up the Niger Delta Master Plan and establishment of a Niger
Delta Ministry (Omotola, 2010). It would seem that it was
the president's frustrations with the failure of these solutions
that culminated in the experimentation with the amnesty
option. Although, the amnesty program can be adjudged to
have successfully reversed the serious security challenge that
had plagued the Niger Delta, nothing has been significantly
achieved by either the Yar'adua/Jonathan administration or
the present Jonathan/Sambo administration to massively
10 SAGE Open
develop the glaringly marginalized and neglected region, a
precondition that is needed for the much-desired sustainable
peace, security, and socio-economic development of the
Niger Delta. Even the road leading to President Jonathan's
hometown (Otueki) in Bayelsa state, almost 2 years into his
full-blown 4-year tenure, is in a state of disrepair. This is
apart from the multi-million naira contracts awarded and the
surveillance jobs given to key ex-Niger Delta militants,
expectedly to pacify the so-called militant leaders whose
repentance is still doubtful and the level of illegal oil bunker-
ing going on in the same region among the youths.
In respect of the petroleum industry bill that mainly seeks
to utilize 10% of the profit from the oil companies for the
development of the oil-bearing communities in the Niger
Delta region, it is worrisome that apart from the opposition
from the senators from the northern part of Nigeria who are
clamoring for the inclusion of states that have oil pipelines
and installations, the inconsequential fund may not be realiz-
able. Moreover, full royalties from oil and gas companies are
supposed to be paid to the state, local government, and com-
munities where the oil and gas are extracted at a rate similar
to what it was before the 1969 Petroleum Act.
On the whole, in the face of sundry efforts by the Nigerian
state, particularly the infinitesimal 13% derivation element
of the current revenue sharing formula, the failed land use
reform attempt, the partially successful short-run post-
amnesty program, and the controversial petroleum industry
bill, the central developmental concerns of the Niger Delta
region have not been addressed. Thus, the need for the modi-
fication of the obnoxious and eco-environmentally disadvan-
tageous laws and a holistic developmental approach and
action-based programs by the Nigerian government and oil
conglomerates that will provide sustainable windows of
opportunity and safety nets for the socio-economically dislo-
cated youths cannot be over-emphasized.
Conclusive Remarks and
Recommendations
Every environment is endowed with opportunities and con-
fronted with threats. While the opportunities may be poten-
tial (dormant) or actualized (activated), the threats are more
often than not man-made. This position derives from the fact
that environmental resources in their natural state do not
pose any threats to man; rather, it is the utilization of the
resources through their use or misuse that generates threats.
In the case of the Niger Delta environment, it is the treasure
base of the entity called Nigeria. This is because the Nigerian
economy is largely dependent on the petroleum sector that
accounts for approximately 80% of government revenues,
90% of foreign exchange earnings, and 95% of export
receipts. The Niger Delta environment from which the petro-
leum natural resource is extracted is therefore the mainspring
of the economy and the energizing force of the sustainability
of the Nigerian state. This same environmental resource has
also created significant empowerment. The petroleum
resource has engineered the process of limited access to the
social amenities that today exist in parts of the Niger Delta
environment, particularly the urban towns and cities.
Although the opportunities accruable from the business envi-
ronment of the region are enough to transform the environ-
ment, the degradation, neglect, marginalization, repression,
and deliberate underdevelopment of the environment and the
pauperization of its people remain a paradoxical puzzle.
In actuality, it is the use and misuse of the environmental
resources of the Niger Delta and the concomitant devastation
of the productive capacity of their land, careless pollution of
their waters, and the degradation of their atmosphere in the
face of the patent inequity in the distribution of the revenue
derivable from the petroleum resources of the region that has
generated threats that is arguably the basis of the restiveness
among the Niger Delta youths. The restiveness is, in fact, the
major explanation for the negative social activities such as
pipeline vandalization, kidnapping, thuggery, armed robbery,
and sea piracy that have engaged the attention and energy of
the youths and also become a commonplace in the environ-
ment of the region. This is because the Niger Delta youths
are caught in a web between a devastated traditional occupa-
tional/economic mainstay and a blocked access to the oppor-
tunities of a petro-dollar business environment. Thus, the
widespread relative and near-absolute poverty in which the
Niger Delta youths are enmeshed has precipitated environ-
mental crisis in the region with youth restiveness as one of
the multi-faceted dimensions.
There is therefore the exigency of achieving an accom-
modation between the level of costs and threats as well as the
benefits and opportunities in the Niger Delta. This is essen-
tially due to the fact that environmental costs and benefits
cannot be progressing separately at arithmetic and geometric
directions. And the equitable distribution of environmental
costs and benefits is not only the hallmark of environmental
justice but also the standard for measuring deviation in prac-
tice (Tietenberg, 2005). The juxtaposition of the two words
"costs and benefits" is very important given the environmen-
tal crisis situation of the Niger Delta region. Cost­benefit
criterion therefore presupposes that for every cost, there
should be not only a corresponding but also an exceeding
benefit. This is a gap that must be filled in an integrated and
a holistic approach to the environmental opportunities and
threats relationship as far as the macro-Niger Delta palaver
and the accompanying hydra-headed youth restiveness prob-
lematic are concerned. And with the little or no access of the
region's youth to the benefits derivable from oil exploration
and production activities that should expectedly mitigate the
negative effects and costs of the environmental degradation
to which they have been perpetually subjected, environmen-
tal justice is thus a desideratum. This environmental justice
will permeate the legal/constitutional, operational, and insti-
tutional aspects of the Niger Delta crisis through the
Ejumudo 11
amendment or abrogation of the environmentally obnoxious
laws, the genuine massive compensational infrastructural
development of the devastated and neglected region, and the
socio-economic empowerment of the pauperized, unproduc-
tive, and agitated youth such that they can contribute to the
national development process. To this end, holistic efforts to
analyze and overcome the power structures that thwart and
militate against the principles of fairness and equity and seek
to redress the imbalances in the distribution of environmen-
tal benefits and costs in the form of skill acquisition, job cre-
ation, health care, and educational assistance schemes and
other pro-poor life-enhancing programs are desirable and
appropriate.
