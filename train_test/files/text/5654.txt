Abstract. The papers in this theme issue seek to advance our understanding of the roles
of networks and partnerships in the multilevel governance of climate change and related
issues in the urban context. In particular, the papers examine the roles of nontraditional
actors and apply emerging theoretical approaches such as sustainability transitions theory
to gain a greater understanding of the variety of approaches being employed around the
world, as well as the transformative potential of these approaches. We discuss the role of
the state relative to the roles of local leadership, knowledge systems, and community-wide
collaborative engagement in bringing about sustainability transitions.
Keywords: urban climate change governance, partnership, networks, entrepreneurship
1 Introduction
Urban areas are increasingly portrayed as key players in responding to climate change, in part
because critical sources of emissions reside within their jurisdiction and also because this is
the scale at which many response options are planned and implemented (Amen etal, 2011;
Bulkeley,2010;BulkeleyandBetsill,2013;Romero-LankaoandDodman,2011).Furthermore,
the geographical proximity of local decision makers, entrepreneurs, citizens, and consumers
makes urban areas natural testing grounds for new ideas and approaches to addressing problems
arising from human­environment interactions. Novel networks and partnerships across
sectors are emerging in cities, holding out the promise of innovative approaches to governing
complex and uncertain environmental challenges (Gerlach and Rayner,1988). We refer to
networks and partnerships as somewhat formalized, stable, and ongoing relationships among
smaller and larger numbers of actors with the purpose of mobilizing resources (financial,
technical, human, knowledge, etc) to achieve a collective goal--in this case urban climate
change mitigation and adaptation (Weber and Khademian, 2008).
In this theme issue the authors undertake an examination of these emerging partnerships
and attempt to theorize the potential and emerging roles of private and civil society governance
in the wider context of nonstate actors (Friedman etal, 2005; Josselin and Wallance, 2001;
Lipschutz, 1996; Newell etal, 2012; Wapner, 1996; Willetts, 2012). The objective is to
understand the role of local actors, such as urban businesses and civil society organizations,
as agents of change in the multilevel governance of climate change in relation to the public
sector, and cities as niche spaces in which sustainable development paths might be explored.
762 H Schroeder, S Burch, S Rayner
It includes case studies of major urban areas around the world that examine the dynamics
around emerging partnerships between various levels of government and/or small businesses
and civil society to address climate change mitigation and adaptation.
We seek to enhance understanding of the evolving modes of climate change governance
in cities, especially in the context of networks and partnerships across multiple levels
ofgovernment and various sectors of the economy. We elaborate upon the challenges of
institutional path dependency, as it relates to climate change policy development, and bring
the small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) sector into discussions of climate change
governance. SMEs can be seen as the `silent majority' of businesses, as they make up
approximately 95% of businesses in the UK alone and account for some 60% of commercial
emissions of greenhouse gases, yet are not included in any legislation on mitigating climate
change (Revell etal, 2010).
By covering a wide range of actors, sectors, and cases from both developed and
developing countries and on both mitigation and adaptation, we address three main themes.
First, we provide theoretical framings and pose key research questions. Second, we illustrate
the varied ways in which partnerships between multiple levels of government and sectors are
transitioning toward sustainability in urban spaces and what obstacles may be encountered
along the way. Third, we delve into issues of community and stakeholder participation in
decision making, including the role of networks in urban climate governance and barriers to
engaging with otherwise marginalized stakeholders.
2 Theoretical framings and key research questions
While global climate change policy has floundered, subnational and local action appears
to be accelerating (Okereke etal, 2009). Nonstate actors are taking an increasingly central
role, and may be having greater success in pushing through the process of greenhouse gas
reduction target setting, policy design, and implementation (Lovell and Liverman, 2010;
New etal, 2011; Schroeder and Bulkeley, 2009). Examination of the dynamic interplay
between nonstate, or subnational, actors (such as municipalities, state and provincial
authorities, nongovernmental organizations, and civil society groups) is forming the core of a
burgeoning body of policy-relevant and interdisciplinary governance theory. Whether formal
or informal, partnerships between multiple sectors, organizations, and levels of governance
enable the pooling of expertise, capacity, experience, and creativity. They also allow for the
extension of reach for any single actor. New constellations of actors allow for their collective
effectiveness to be higher than the sum of their individual efforts. Cases abound where urban
climate mitigation action was possible due to the forming of strategic partnerships involving
public and private actors (eg, Bulkeley and Schroeder, 2012).
Thisbodyoftheoryisexpandingnotonlytoplacegreateremphasisonthesenonstateactors,
but also to include a greater diversity of actors, such as SMEs. While SMEs have traditionally
been depicted as laggards on the environment which underplay their environmental impacts
and resist environmental legislation due to the perceived associated costs, recently a small
number of SME owners and managers have responded to calls for environmental and climate
change action. Seeing the potential cost savings, opportunity for winning over new customers,
higher staff retention rates, and good publicity, some SMEs are recognizing that a transition
to a low-carbon economy will bring more opportunities than burdens (Revell etal, 2010).
There is clearly untapped potential for innovation here: entrepreneurs play a crucial role as
problem solvers, taking risks where others might avoid them (Beveridge and Guy, 2005).
Even so, SMEs in particular face coordination challenges, as their individual influence is
limited and resources are often constrained, especially in a developing country context (Boyd
and Ghosh, 2013; Setzer and Biderman, 2013). This suggests a role for partnerships between
Novel multisector networks and entrepreneurship 763
government, nongovernmental organizations, and small businesses to fill capacity gaps and
stimulate market-based responses to environmental challenges.
The challenge is to incorporate such emerging trends into our understanding of the
multilevel governance of sustainability transitions. Theories of governance have made
significant progress towards a deeper understanding of the role and capacity of cities to
address climate change, while capturing the complexity of interests, actors, and institutional
architectures at play in the development and implementation of environmental policy. One
such approach is multilevel governance, which grew out of the study of the process of
`Europeanization' in the late 1980s and early 1990s.
Multilevel governance embodies the notion that greater collaboration amongst academic
approaches, and across theoretical and empirical models, is required to gain a more coherent
understanding of political phenomena (Bache and Flinders, 2004). A core element of this
approach is a critique of the false dichotomy between domestic and international politics
(Marks etal, 1996). Similarly, multilevel governance theory suggests that an exclusive focus
on state actors precludes a nuanced understanding of the interactions between state and
nonstate actors in the governance of global environmental change issues.
Multilevel governance as a theoretical frame has been particularly useful for studies of
the role of cities in climate change mitigation, given that cities are politically, jurisdictionally,
and financially bounded by higher levels of government (Betsill and Bulkeley, 2006; Burch,
2010; Schroeder and Bulkeley, 2009). In this issue Fisher (2013) makes a direct contribution
to this body of theory by examining the relationship between subnational and federal climate
change policies in the United States, articulating a theory of `boomerang federalism'in which
local efforts stimulate federal initiatives that return to support the local. She finds, however,
that there are costs associated with implementing climate policy through hybrid arrangements
involving business and local governmental actors, potentially creating additional challenges
to federal policy making. Fisher shows that coordination across levels of governance is
crucial, reducing transaction costs and facilitating communication.
An examination of current multilevel governance approaches to climate change and
sustainability transitions, combined with theories of corporate social responsibility, reveals
a series of gaps, which suggest research questions that are in part addressed by the papers
in this issue. First, can we discern political and/or legislative drivers of this partnership
formation that includes not only the regional authority and municipal governments but also
small businesses? Burch etal (2013) address this question and conclude that cities may view
engagement with small businesses as a proxy for awareness raising amongst the general
public, while small businesses are seeking resources and political influence. Policy at higher
levels of government, such as the provincial government in this case, is a crucial trigger of
partnerships that involve a variety of subnational actors. This suggests that innovation at
multiple levels is required to foster these polycentric sustainability transitions, with each
actor playing a very specific role.
Even in the presence of coordination and legislative or political triggers, however, novel
climate governance arrangements will not succeed without specific quantities and qualities
of capacity. Romero-Lankao etal (2013) address this question with a particular focus on
institutional response capacity. This comparative case study demonstrates that efforts to
address climate change in cities will remain secondary to the top priority of growth, unless
a more integrative analysis of institutions is undertaken. While an early leader may, in
some cases, possess greater institutional response capacity, challenges such as institutional
fragmentation and technocratic decision making may still arise. Similarly, a series of `building
blocks' is required, according to Shey and Belis (2013), if successful environmental regimes
are to be constructed in urban environments. These building blocks are especially important
764 H Schroeder, S Burch, S Rayner
in the context of nonstate actors, and include coalition building, collaborative agenda setting,
and cooperation. Ultimately, a multilevel governance framing of responses to climate change
in cities suggests that a systems lens must be employed in order to more carefully elucidate
the actors, networks, and capacities at play.
3 Obstacles and pathways toward sustainability transitions
Having theorized the role of partnerships and networks across multiple levels of government
and sectors above, we now explore the structural obstacles and pathways toward sustainability
transitions and low-carbon urban development through involvement of SMEs and civil
society. Novel networks, partnerships, and entrepreneurship across levels of governance and
sectors are in a unique position to create new social mobilization (Bulkeley and Moser, 2007)
and reveal opportunities for eroding the inertia behind unsustainable practices (Burch, 2010).
Transition management, nested within the study of sociotechnical systems, emphasizes
a systems approach to sustainable development, geared toward enabling, facilitating, and
guiding social, technical, and political transformations as prescribed by the embedded
societal systems to bring about sustainable practices (Loorbach, 2010; Meadowcroft, 2009).
It recognizes the complex makeup of modern society with its multiple perspectives, norms,
and values as well as the manifestation of problems across multiple actors, levels, and
domains (Arthur, 1989; David, 1994). This leads it to adopt a perspective that encourages
multiactor participation to strengthen bottom-up decision making and incentivization and
social learning toward more sustainable choices. Transition management advocates for the
need to completely transform the system and radically rebuild societal systems to transcend
the lock-in to unsustainable systems through the fabrics of the wider embedded systems at
higher levels (Loorbach, 2007; Meadowcroft, 2009).
Killip (2013) employs transition theory and a systems lens to illustrate the common policy
disconnect between markets that are in reality fundamentally linked (such as the appliance
market and the multiple markets that influence energy use in buildings). Killip proposes an
institutional infrastructure that might cross the traditional boundaries between actors and
rules, aligning training, standard setting, and compliance monitoring. Through applying the
theory of market transformation to the case of refurbishment of UK housing, Killip finds
that coordination across, first, the fragmented constellation of actors involved and, second,
the domains of policy, research, and practice is where the bottleneck toward low-carbon
development is situated. This operationalization of transition management theory is a step
towards the creation of transferable lessons that will be of use to other communities that are
setting out on sustainability transitions.
Berkhout and Westerhoff (2013) divide the transition process into four stages: (1)
destabilization, (2) fermentation, (3) standardization, and (4) stabilization. Destabilization is
a period of rising tension for change, followed by fermentation--that is, actions undertaken to
open up `cracks' into which new discourses may be inserted. Then alternative arrangements
can compete until eventually a single new standard emerges (standardization). Finally,
consensus around what constitutes the system's new standard strengthens and becomes taken
for granted (stabilization). Moving through these stages is wrought with difficulty, as the
case study of the Canadian Province of British Colombia (BC) by Berkhout and Westerhoff
illustrates. The bottleneck in this case was for networks to move beyond the early fermentation
stage. The network which was set up to transform energy in BC in the built environment is
thus far contributing to disseminating new discourses and knowledge on climate and energy
measures, but it is lacking the momentum to move further.
The case of urban adaptation governance in Helsinki, Finland demonstrates how the
absence of cooperation across public and private sectors leads to suboptimal outcomes in that
regulatory systems do not help the private sector to minimize losses after an extreme-weather
Novel multisector networks and entrepreneurship 765
event, because these are thus far predominantly reactive, rather than anticipatory. As a result,
private sector organizations have set out to increase their coping capacity independently of
state regulation (Juhola, 2013).
When civil-society groups and the broader communities which they can mobilize have
the capacity to design and implement significant urban sustainability projects, the ability to
transition is much stronger (Aylett, 2013). Niches within the urban landscape can then be
created that allow coordination of novel partnerships between state, community, and private
sector actors and local SMEs to develop and refine their businesses practices. The crucial
point is that then civil society and local businesses can act with a speed and tolerance for
risk that is far higher than that of municipal governments. They are able to translate complex
technological shifts into a language and a process that resonates with the communities, which
the programs are destined to serve. And, finally, by working at the community level and
harnessing the social momentum generated by processes of collective accomplishment, they
can generate reinforcing cycles of social and technological transformation (Aylett, 2013).
Local action is effective in tackling global issues when the policy objective is viewed within
the context of local needs and is framed within the resource capacity of the local governing
coalition (Shey and Belis, 2013).
4 The role of novel community participation and engagement
Next, we discuss the drivers, barriers, and dynamics of stakeholder participation in decision
making and the role of networks in urban climate governance and in bringing about
sustainability transitions. The case studies presented in this theme issue both highlight
the ingredients of successful community engagement--including trust, accountability,
transparency, and good communication (eg, Aylett, 2013; Shey and Belis, 2013); they also
illustrate the limitations which local government is faced with in its ability to operate and
mobilize the wider community (eg, Aylett, 2013; Boyd and Ghosh, 2013; Juhola, 2013;
Setzer and Biderman, 2013).
An example of successful community engagement can be found in Portland's Solarize
scheme, a community-managed solar energy programme that has managed to transform
the local and regional market for solar energy in Portland, Oregon (Aylett, 2013). The
success of this scheme is undoubtedly due to the unique position occupied by local NGOs
and community members. Rooted in their communities, local activists were trusted to find
key partners, mobilize volunteers, and initiate programmes. Being outside of government
allowed them to take risks and experiment without having to worry about any larger political
implications from their plans. But importantly, "because they were from the community they
could build a program that was truly of the community." This enabled the activists to frame
a complex process of technological change in the language and logic of the communities
within which they operated.
Shey and Belis (2013) also highlight ways in which local actors can work across
institutional and structural boundaries to govern climate change by looking at food
production in Minneapolis. In 2008 the city launched Homegrown Minneapolis, a multiple
stakeholder initiative bringing together local government actors, businesses, and NGOs to
build a sustainable and local food system as an example of governing climate change in
urban areas. Accountability, transparency, and communication between the Food Council
and community have been given a high priority, as demonstrated by its website, which posts
all meeting information, reports, and activities. Other priorities include increasing access
to local food in public venues (eg, sports stadiums) and expanding the city's organic waste
collection. Spillover effects include the emergence of additional community and business
activities around the central theme of creating a sustainable, healthy, and local food system
in Minneapolis and the city's new climate policy initiative.
766 H Schroeder, S Burch, S Rayner
The two cases of developing country cities--Mumbai, India and São Paolo, Brazil--
show that the state is standing in the way of greater civil society and business participation
(Boyd and Ghosh, 2013; Setzer and Biderman, 2013). By exploring local climate innovations
in Mumbai, India to understand the drivers and barriers of success, Boyd and Ghosh (2013,
page941) show how "local government provides only the backstop and NGOs stand out
as highly important climate-development connectors." The state, mired in geopolitical
phraseology, is too slow in responding to the need for adaptation governance. Boyd and
Ghosh find that one of the biggest barriers is the lack of municipal resources to support
innovations. They use the example of Sunshine Coop to illustrate how technical expertise and
consultation can be provided by only NGOs.
Examining São Paolo's climate change policy, Setzer and Biderman (2013) find limited
participation by civil society and businesses in its formulation.They argue thatimplementation
can succeed only if the private sector--in particular, civil construction, transport, and solar
energy SMEs--is brought in. SMEs are particularly crucial for the transport sector because
they make up a significant proportion of the city's economic activity while to date having
been largely overlooked by policy makers. The authors see a huge potential for transport
consultancy firms, academia, and think-tank representatives to help define appropriate
regulation on climate change.
It seems that governments have developed a "disingenuous and unproductive relationship
with their constituents" because they have too narrowly invested in a strategy that would just
"implore, inform, and `incentivize' their citizens to change their individual or household
behavior" (Aylett, 2013, page
871). Limitations were found in that local governments
and bureaucracies have limited resources and limited positions within the broader urban
community, preventing them from facilitating broader sociotechnical shifts throughout the
city. In sum, "the transformation of our cities must be a collective process" (page871).
5 Conclusions and ways forward
Taken together, the papers in this theme issue advance our understanding of multilevel
governance of sustainability issues in the urban context. By more carefully examining the role
of nontraditional actors, and bringing to bear increasingly powerful theoretical approaches
such as sustainability transitions theory, we gain a greater understanding of the variety
ofapproaches being employed around the world, as well as the transformative potential of
these approaches. We see how the role of the state is stronger if "[l]ocal leadership catalyz[es]
the process, knowledge exchange, and community-wide collaborative engagement" (Shey
and Belis, 2013, page907) and how "community organizations...lead by example outside
of processes that depend on the transformation of the local state as a precondition for changes
in projects and practices" (Aylett, 2013, page862).
Still required, however, are compelling multiple cross-case analyses, longitudinal
studies, and meta-analyses that make use of the growing abundance of unlinked and
widely variable data. Key questions remain: how can successful experiments in the
creation of innovation networks be transferred, scaled up, and accelerated in both similar
and dissimilar communities? What is the most effective blend of `steering' and emergence
that allows novel climate change governance arrangements to sprout and bear fruit? What
sociopolitical, economic, and ecological indicators can most compellingly and accurately
capture transformation in development pathways? This theme issue offers a foundation upon
which further investigations can be built--a task for governance, sustainability transitions,
community engagement, and business administration alike.
