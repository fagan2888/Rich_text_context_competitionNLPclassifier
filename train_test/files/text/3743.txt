Introduction
Asthma is a severe chronic disease which induces
airway hyper-responsiveness and results in recur-
rent symptoms such as wheezing, dyspnea and
cough [GAN, 2014]. The prevalence of asthma
has been increasing in recent years, and now
affects as many as 334 million people worldwide
[GAN, 2014; GINA, 2015]. A survey of 164,215
residents over the age of 14 years in eight Chinese
provinces from February 2010 to August 2011
found the overall prevalence of asthma to be 1.2%
[Feng et al. 2014]. The number of asthmatic
patients in China has been estimated to be roughly
30 million [Lin et al. 2013].
Although asthma is not curable, many studies have
shown that correct diagnosis, proper treatment
and long-term management of asthma can improve
the level of asthma control and enhance the quality
of life [CTS, 2008]. Good management of asthma
is also essential to reduce the economic burden of
asthma. If not controlled properly, asthma can
affect daily activities and result in physical, emo-
tional and social limitations which can impair
quality of life and even be fatal [Van Lieshout and
MacQueen, 2012; Likhar et al. 2015]. According
to the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA), the
long-term goals of asthma control are symptom
control and risk reduction [GINA, 2015].

Abstract
Background: Asthma affects a large number of patients in China, but relatively little is
known about asthma management among Chinese patients. This study aims to estimate
asthma control rate among adult Chinese patients and to identify predictors associated with
uncontrolled asthma.
Methods: A total of 4125 asthma patients aged 17 years and representing all regions of
mainland China except Tibet were surveyed. Asthma control status was assessed using the
Asthma Control Test (ACT) and classified as controlled (ACT score  20) and uncontrolled
(ACT score  19). A multivariate logistic regression model was used to identify predictors
associated with uncontrolled asthma from the factors including demographics, rhinitis,
allergic rhinitis, and treatment adherence.
Results: Asthma was controlled in 44.9%, and uncontrolled in 55.1% of the study participants.
High rates of uncontrolled asthma were found in patients with treatment nonadherence
(77.3%), poor adherence (66.2%), no schooling (64.8%), or obesity (62.9%). The risk of
uncontrolled asthma was much higher in the treatment nonadherence group than the
complete adherence group [odds ratio (OR) = 4.55 (3.68­5.62), p < 0.001]. Other predictors for
uncontrolled asthma included concomitant rhinitis [OR = 1.31 (1.14­1.50), p < 0.001], obesity
[OR = 1.31 (1.05­1.64), p = 0.019], asthma duration > 3 years [OR = 1.22 (1.07­1.39), p =
0.004] and age  45 years [OR = 1.23 (1.07­1.41), p = 0.004].
Conclusions: About half of the participants in this study had uncontrolled asthma. Treatment
nonadherence is one of the significant predictors, which is very strongly associated with
uncontrolled asthma. Efforts should be prioritized to promote patients' treatment adherence
to improve asthma control while attention is needed on rhinitis or obesity.

Only limited information is available on the state
of asthma management in Chinese patients, espe-
cially adult patients. A survey conducted in eight
Asia-Pacific countries in 2011 reported that
asthma was uncontrolled for a large proportion of
patients, and that 98% of the 402 surveyed
patients from mainland China were either uncon-
trolled or only partly controlled [Thompson et al.
2013]. However, a survey of 2034 asthma patients
from eight Chinese provinces found that 15.6%
were completely controlled and 49.5% were
partly controlled, as evaluated by the Asthma
Control Test (ACT) [Su et al. 2014]. The dis-
crepancy between the findings of these two stud-
ies may be due to limitations in geographic
distribution and sample size.
Asthma control is related to many factors.
Medication adherence is an important determi-
nant of asthma control, though nonadherence to
asthma controllers among asthma patients is
prevalent and maybe is an important reason for
poor asthma control in many countries including
China [Davidsen, 2012; Murphy et al. 2012;
Ahmedani et al. 2013; Makela et al. 2013; Wang
et al. 2013]. Allergic rhinitis (AR) is also a widely
reported risk factor for asthma control. A study
showed that 69.9% of Chinese asthma patients
over the age of 14 years reported AR symptoms
and that the presence and severity of AR were
negatively associated with asthma control [Lin
et al. 2014]. Studies also reported obesity is asso-
ciated with subsequent poor asthma control
[Schatz et al. 2015; Ulrik, 2016]. However, stud-
ies to comprehensively evaluate risks associated
with poor asthma control in Chinese patients
were still very limited.
This study aims to provide a comprehensive esti-
mate of asthma control across mainland China
and to identify predictors associated with uncon-
trolled asthma in Chinese asthma patients.
Methods
Study design and patients
This nationwide cross-sectional observational
study was conducted in China between November
2012 and June 2013. It involved patients aged
2 years who visited outpatient clinics of respira-
tory disease for treatment, prescription refill and
consultation during the study period. A total of
8873 asthma patients were enrolled in this study.
Here we report only the results from the 4125
participants aged 17 and older. The results from
the 4223 participants aged 2­16 years will be
reported separately.
The asthma patients 17 years old were consecu-
tively enrolled from 48 tertiary general hospitals
in 34 cities of different provinces across China,
covering all territories and regions of mainland
China except Tibet. All participants had con-
firmed asthma for at least 3 months and had
symptoms or took asthma medication during the
past 12 months.
Asthma diagnosis was confirmed by medical chart
review at the enrollment visit. The diagnosis of
asthma was defined as the presence of relevant
clinical history (i.e. history of recurrent dyspnea,
wheezing or cough episodes) and pulmonary
function tests demonstrating variable airflow lim-
itation by means of airway responsiveness testing
or airway reversibility testing, which satisfied
those of GINA [GINA, 2015]. Asthma duration
and treatment were also confirmed by medical
chart review. Eligible patients were requested to
sign the informed consent. Patients who had mild
asthma, intermittent asthma, chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease (COPD), bronchiectasis,
bronchitis, cystic fibrosis, lung cancer or pneu-
monia or who were not able to fill in the question-
naires were excluded.
The study protocol was originally approved by
the Independent Ethics Committee of China­
Japan Friendship Hospital. Other participating
hospitals either accepted the decision of that
committee or conducted a further independent
ethics review, according to their own institutional
policy.
Data collection
Sociodemographic and clinical information,
including family history of allergic disease, con-
comitant disease (e.g. rhinitis and AR), asthma
symptoms, asthma duration since diagnosis,
asthma-related treatments and tests, and asthma
treatment adherence, was collected from partici-
pants' medical charts during their visits. Any
identifier to an individual patient, such as social
security number, identification number and full
name, was not collected. Body mass index (BMI)
was measured and classified as normal (18.5 
BMI <24), lean (BMI < 18.5), overweight (24 
BMI < 28), and obesity (BMI  28) based on
Criteria Of Weight for Adults issued by National

Health and Family Planning Commission
(NHFPC) of China in 2013 [NHFPC, 2013].
Rhinitis was defined as nasal symptoms including
sneezing, nasal blockage, itching of the nose
occurring during multiple consecutive days for
more than 1 hour on most days and not caused by
cold or flu [Bousquet et al. 2008]. AR was defined
as rhinitis associated with immunoglobulin (Ig)
E-mediated immune response confirmed by
serum specific IgE or skin prick test [Bousquet
et al. 2008]. Asthma treatment adherence was
assessed by physicians through review of prescrip-
tion refill in the past 3 months and was classified
into four levels: complete adherence (90%),
good adherence (70­89%), poor adherence (50­
69%) and nonadherence (<50%).
The five-item ACT questionnaire was used to
assess the level of asthma control [Zhou et al.
2009; Nguyen et al. 2012]. Asthma control was
classified into controlled (ACT  20) and uncon-
trolled (ACT  19) [NIH, 2007]. Mini Asthma
Quality-of-Life Questionnaire (Mini-AQLQ) was
used to measure quality of life [Juniper et al.
1999]. Both questionnaires were completed by
participants during the interview and reviewed by
physicians for completeness.
Quality control
All data were collected using a uniform data col-
lection form. All investigators were trained on the
standardized study protocol and data collection
form before initiation of the study. A clinical
research organization (CRO) was employed to
monitor the quality of data collection and to man-
age the data. All data were inputted into a pro-
grammed database by two people independently
for statistical analysis.
Statistical analysis
Since the study was not testing any hypothesis,
we calculated sample size based on the estimation
of uncontrolled asthma rate. A sample size of
1500 was necessary (5% level of significance,
two-sided) when we estimated uncontrolled
asthma rate was 42% according to the result of
the Asia Pacific Asthma Insights and Management
study [Thompson et al. 2013]. With considera-
tion of stratification analysis on AR comorbidity
and other risk factors, we amplified the sample
size to 4000. Descriptive statistics were used to
summarize demographic and clinical characteris-
tics. Continuous variables were displayed by
mean, median, standard deviation (SD), and first
and third quartiles (Q1 and Q3). Categorical var-
iables were summarized by frequency and per-
centage. Continuous variables were compared
using two-sample Student's t-test. To explore the
potential risk factors associated with uncontrolled
asthma, the level of asthma control was summa-
rized into two categories: controlled asthma
(ACT  20) and uncontrolled asthma (ACT 
19). The proportion of uncontrolled asthma in
patients among two different characteristics
groups was calculated and compared using a Chi-
square test. A Cochran­Armitage test was used to
detect the trend of proportions of uncontrolled
asthma in patients among more than two ordinal
categories. Factors of statistical significance (p <
0.1) were analyzed using multivariate logistic
regression models to identify the risk factors asso-
ciated with uncontrolled asthma. Odds ratio
(OR) and the 95% confidence interval (CI) of
each factor from the multivariate logistic regres-
sion models was estimated and presented. A two-
tailed p value < 0.05 was considered to be
statistically significant.
Statistical analyses were performed using the
SAS® System for WindowsTM 9.2 (SAS Institute
Inc., Cary, NC, USA).
Results
Demographic and clinical characteristics of
study participants
A total of 4125 asthma patients aged 17 years
were enrolled in the study. The average age was
46.4 (±14.0), with a range of 17­94 years old.
Female patients constituted 60.7% of the study
population. A total of 67.7% of the participants
(2793/4125) lived in cities and 7.0% (288/4125)
were current smokers.
A total of 37.1% (1531/4124) of the participants
had rhinitis in addition to asthma; overall, 15.2%
(625/4124) had AR, and 6.9% (286/4125)
reported medical history of allergic eczema. There
were 21.0% of the participants (868/4125) with
at least one first-degree relative with asthma.
The median duration of asthma since diagnosis
was 3 years (Q1­Q3: 1.0­9.0). Cough (72.7%,
2999/4125) and wheeze (70.4%, 2904/4125)
were the most common asthma symptoms
reported. Overall, 51.0% of the participants
(2105/4124) reported seasonal changes in asthma

symptoms. A total of 12.1% (500/4124) were
diagnosed with cough-variant asthma. Overall,
70.4% of the participants (2902/4123) reported
having asthma symptoms during the previous 4
weeks. Detailed characteristics of the symptoms
are shown in Figure 1. More than half of the par-
ticipants (57.6%, 2374/4119) had asthma acute
exacerbation during the past 3 months.
Management of asthma control
A total of 78.7% (3245/4125) of the study par-
ticipants had taken asthma controllers during
the previous 4 weeks. Most of them (88.4%,
2867/3245) used combination therapies. Inhaled
corticosteroids (ICSs) plus long-acting
-agonists (LABAs) fixed dose combination
(FDC) was the most common combined ther-
apy, followed by ICS/LABA FDC plus a leukot-
riene receptor antagonist (LTRA). The
distribution of combination therapies used by
study participants is shown in Figure 2A. A small
portion of the patients (11.6%, 378/3245) used
monotherapies, with ICSs being the most fre-
quently used monotherapy. The distribution of
monotherapy drugs used by study participants is
shown in Figure 2B.
A total of 21.3% (880/4125) of the participants
had not taken any asthma controller during the
previous 4 weeks. Of these, 88.4% (775/877)
stopped taking controllers on their own, of which
53.3% (413/775) stopped because they thought
their asthma symptoms had been relieved. Only
39.0% (1607/4116) of all patients maintained
complete asthma controller adherence. In addi-
tion, among all study participants, only 31.9%
(1314/4125) had undergone skin prick testing
and 11.7% (483/4125) had serum-specific IgE
testing.
Uncontrolled asthma and its impact on quality
of life
According to ACT criteria, asthma was controlled
(ACT  20) in 44.9% of the participants and
remain uncontrolled (ACT  19) in 55.1% of
them. The frequency of uncontrolled asthma in
groups with different characteristics is shown in
Table 1. High frequencies of uncontrolled asthma
were found in participants with poor asthma
treatment adherence (66.2%) or nonadherence
(77.3%). Participants with rhinitis had a higher
frequency of uncontrolled asthma than those
without rhinitis (57.5% versus 53.6%, p = 0.016).
The frequency of uncontrolled asthma in those
with or without AR was almost the same (54.9%
versus 55.1%, p > 0.05). The frequency of uncon-
trolled asthma among the participants with con-
comitant AR was significantly lower in those with
corresponding AR treatment than without it, but
this difference was not statistically significant
(previous AR treatment: 52.2% versus 58.6%,
current AR treatment: 51.2% versus 56.8%, both
p > 0.05).
Participants with uncontrolled asthma had sig-
nificantly lower total scores and individual
domain scores on the Mini AQLQ compared with
those with controlled asthma (all p < 0.001)

(Figure 3), showing that the quality of life of
patients with uncontrolled asthma is significantly
affected in terms of symptoms, activity, emotions
and environment.
Risk factors of uncontrolled asthma
As shown in Table 1, several factors were associ-
ated with level of asthma control. BMI was
related to level of asthma control. Participants
with normal BMI had a lower frequency of uncon-
trolled asthma compared with those in overweight
and obese groups (52.6% versus 57.0% and 62.9%,
p < 0.05). Education level was negatively related
to uncontrolled asthma. The frequency of uncon-
trolled asthma decreased from 64.8% to 44.5% as
education level increased from `no schooling' to
`college and above' (p < 0.001). Asthma treat-
ment adherence was also important contributor
in asthma control. The frequency of uncontrolled

increased significantly as asthma treatment adher-
ence decreased (p < 0.001). Compared with
patients with complete adherence, the OR of
uncontrolled asthma was 1.62 (p < 0.001) among
patients with good adherence, 2.73 and 4.55
(both p < 0.001) for those with poor adherence
and nonadherence, respectively. In addition, con-
comitant rhinitis (OR = 1.31, p < 0.001), obesity
(OR = 1.31, p = 0.019), asthma duration since
diagnosis > 3 years (OR = 1.22, p = 0.004) and
age  45 years (OR = 1.23, p = 0.004) were all
found to significantly increase the risk of uncon-
trolled asthma. Patient education level above
`college' is a protective factor and negatively
related to uncontrolled asthma (OR = 0.58, p =
0.006), compared with those with no schooling.
Discussion
More than half (55.1%) of the 4125 adult Chinese
asthma patients surveyed in this study had uncon-
trolled asthma, indicating that asthma manage-
ment in China is still a major challenge. Several
risk factors for uncontrolled asthma were identi-
fied, including poor treatment adherence, con-
comitant rhinitis, asthma duration since diagnosis
> 3 years, age  45 years and obesity.
Previous studies have found that insufficient
treatment is prevalent among asthma patients
[Davidsen, 2012; Murphy et al. 2012; Ahmedani
et al. 2013; Makela et al. 2013; Wang et al. 2013].
In the present study, asthma treatment adherence
was low in most of the study participants, and
21.3% of the participants had not taken any
asthma medication during the previous 4 weeks.
Only 39.0% of them had complete asthma treat-
ment adherence. The frequency of uncontrolled
asthma was particularly high in patients with
poorer asthma controller adherence. Multivariate
logistic regression analysis showed that poor
asthma treatment adherence was a significant risk
factor associated with uncontrolled asthma. The
risk of uncontrolled asthma in patients with non-
adherence was 4.55 times of that for patients with
complete adherence. All these results show that
poor treatment adherence is a very important fac-
tor contributing to the high proportion of uncon-
trolled asthma among Chinese patients.
Among the participants who had not used asthma
controllers during the previous 4 weeks, most
stopped taking asthma controllers on their own
and 53.3% stopped taking them because they
thought their asthma symptoms had been relieved.
These patients probably overestimated the level
of asthma control they had achieved. This finding
is consistent with a previous survey in the Asia­
Pacific area which reported that one third of
responders with severe persistent asthma thought
their disease was either well or completely con-
trolled [Thompson et al. 2013]. Differences
between patient perceptions of asthma control
and clinically defined asthma control is an impor-
tant factor for low asthma treatment adherence in
Chinese patients. Efforts should be made to
improve patients' understanding of asthma con-

adherence.
Rhinitis was identified as predictor associated
with uncontrolled asthma (OR = 1.31, p < 0.001)
in this study. This was different from many stud-
ies where concomitant AR was usually reported
as predictor for asthma control. The prevalence
of rhinitis in this study was 37.1% and it was
higher than the prevalence of AR 15.2% we
found. A previous study showed that over 50% of
patients with asthma or rhinitis in China had
identifiable sensitivity to aeroallergens, as
detected by a skin prick test [Li et al. 2009]. But
there was insufficient use of a skin prick test
(31.6%) or serum IgE test (11.7%) in this study
population, which might have resulted in under-
diagnosed AR among those with rhinitis. This
might be the reason why the prevalence of AR is
lower than the other study [Hojo et al. 2015]. Lin
and colleagues also reported a higher prevalence
of AR 69.9% in Chinese asthma patients [Lin
et al. 2014], however, the definition of AR they
adopted was only based on typical nasal symp-
toms without the evidence of an IgE-mediated
immune response, which may have led to the
overestimation of prevalence. Since AR was not
identified as a contributor to uncontrolled asthma
with statistical significance in the univariate anal-
ysis and both AR and rhinitis were moderately
correlated (Spearman correlation coefficient =
0.55, p < 0.001), AR was not included in the
multivariate logistic regression model for risk
analysis. Nevertheless, when we used it to replace
rhinitis in the model, very similar results were
observed and AR was still found to be associated
with increased risk of uncontrolled asthma (OR =
1.22, p = 0.035). It proved that our finding did
not conflict with previous studies but was a new
complement in this study context. The finding
was also consistent with the study by Powell and
colleagues where rhinitis adversely affected
asthma control [Powell et al. 2015]. All of these
N Zhong, J Lin et al.

suggest that diagnosis and treatment of concomi-
tant AR or rhinitis may help to maintain good
control of asthma in China.
Obesity has been reported to be associated with
poor asthma control [Pradeepan et al. 2013;
Schatz et al. 2015; Ulrik, 2016]. In the present
study, high frequency of uncontrolled asthma
(62.9%) was found in obese participants (BMI 
28) and they had a 1.31-fold risk of uncontrolled
asthma compared with those with normal BMI.
This finding was similar to previous studies
[Pradeepan et al. 2013; Schatz et al. 2015].
Response to pharmacological asthma therapy in
obese patients showed that obese patients altered,
in general less favorable, response to both reliever
and controller medication compared with normal
weight patients [Ulrik, 2016]. Obesity increases
airway hyperresponsiveness and restoring normal
body weight is an appropriate strategy for reduc-
ing airway hyperresponsiveness and controlling
inflammation that may help improve asthma con-
trol [Kim et al. 2015]. Therefore, in addition to
good treatment adherence, options such as weight
loss and dietary intervention should be consid-
ered in asthma management.
A study conducted in China reported that chil-
dren with asthma with a longer disease course
and regular follow up had better treatment com-
pliance and fewer asthma attacks [Thomas et al.
2010]. Those finding implied that patients with a
longer duration of asthma tended to have better
drug adherence and better control of asthma.
However, a study conducted in Warsaw in Polish
reported that a longer duration of the disease was
associated with worse asthma control
[Krasnodebska et al. 2012]. All those studies indi-
cated that a longer duration of asthma does not
necessarily mean better drug adherence and
asthma control. In this study, we found that
patients with a duration of asthma more than 3
years had a higher risk of uncontrolled asthma
(OR = 1.22, p = 0.004). This implied that
patients with a longer duration of asthma in China
may still not be well trained in terms of following
standard asthma management and correct per-
ception of asthma control. This study also
revealed that having `college and above' educa-
tion was a protective factor for asthma control
(OR = 0.58, p = 0.006), which was consistent
with other studies' common findings that higher
socioeconomic status or health literacy have been
associated with good asthma control [Cope et al.
2008; Sheehan and Phipatanakul, 2015]. All the
above implies that patient educational interven-
tion should be included in asthma management
to increase treatment adherence and also improve
asthma control.
Since this study was a cross-sectional survey, no
definite conclusion can be drawn about the causal
relationship between risk factors and uncontrolled
asthma. The enrollment of study participants
depends on patient clinical visits and their will-
ingness to be surveyed which might result in
selection bias. Patients willing to attend the study
might be prone to follow physician advice or their
prescription during previous treatment, which
may cause better adherence for them than those
not in the study. Therefore, the proportion of
patients with poor or nonadherence may be
underestimated. Additionally, the judgment of
adherence in this study was based on outpatient
prescription refill during the past 3 months rather
than actual dosage that the patients took, which
may have led to complete or good adherence to
have been overestimated to some extent. There
was still a possibility that outpatients hospitalized
due to an asthma attack during the past 3 months
before the study and all related inpatient treat-
ments for asthma could not be included in their
records of outpatient clinics, which also jeopard-
ized the accuracy of judgment of adherence. Also,
since the participants all came from tertiary gen-
eral hospitals, it is possible that the symptoms of
asthma among these patients were more severe
than in ordinary asthma patients such as patients
visiting lower-grade hospitals. This may be a rea-
son for the high proportion of uncontrolled
asthma among surveyed patients. We excluded
intermittent asthma because it does not necessar-
ily need controller treatment and has limited neg-
ative impacts on patient's daily activity and sleep
due to a symptom duration of less than once a
week. We also excluded mild asthma. Therefore,
interpreting the results needs caution that the
uncontrolled rate of asthma might be overesti-
mated for overall asthmatic patients. The study
was carried out between November and June of
the following year when the impact of rhinitis/AR
on asthma control could be modified by the sea-
son. This could be another explanation for the
high rates of uncontrolled asthma in this study
[Hojo et al. 2015]. Our study found that patient
education level was positively related to asthma
control, however it might be confounded by soci-
oeconomic class. Although people with higher
education are very likely to have better or com-
petitive earnings, meanwhile it could not be
Therapeutic Advances in Respiratory Disease 10(6)

denied that the rich could purchase better health-
care than the poor. Future studies should exclude
such confounding effects to generate more solid
evidence. Nevertheless, this study provided a
comprehensive profile of the most recent asthma
control status in Chinese adult patients. The
results should serve as a valuable reference to
guide further management of asthma control in
China.
The long-term goals of asthma control, as defined
by GINA, are symptom control and risk reduc-
tion. The results of this study revealed that the
level of asthma control in China is still far below
the goal. Poor asthma treatment adherence was
the most important risk factor contributing to
uncontrolled asthma. Patients' lack of knowledge
of standard asthma control might be an underly-
ing reason for poor treatment adherence. This
may be improved through educating patients
about asthma control and improving the aware-
ness of asthma management. Diagnosis and
appropriate treatment of AR or rhinitis are also
important.
