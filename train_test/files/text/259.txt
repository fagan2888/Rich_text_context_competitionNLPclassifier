Objective:TotesttheeffectsoftheHealthyStepsforYoung
Childrenprogram(HS)(whichsupportsparentsmanaging
children'sdevelopmentalandbehavioralissues)--withand
without a prenatal component--on child health and de-
velopment, parenting practices, and parental well-being.
Design: A concurrent comparison with clinic-level as-
signment to intervention or usual care status. Nested in
the intervention arm, a randomized trial compared HS
with and without a prenatal component.
Setting: Five primary care clinics in an integrated de-
livery system in the Pacific Northwest.
Participants: A consecutive sample of 439 pregnant
women(80%ofeligible)wereenrolled.Follow-updatawere
obtained for 78% when the child was 30 months old.
Intervention: Families in intervention clinics received
HS services, including developmental and behavioral
advice and risk factor screening. In addition, those ran-
domized to prenatal services received 3 home visits dur-
ing pregnancy.
Main Outcome Measures: Assessed by telephone in-
terview in the 3 domains of child health and develop-
ment, parenting practices, and parental well-being.
Results: Intervention was associated with positive out-
comes in timely well-child care, immunization rates,
breastfeeding, television viewing, injury prevention, and
discipline strategies. Prenatal initiation of services was
associated with larger expressive vocabularies at age
24 months. Mothers who received the intervention
reported more depressive symptoms, but there was no
increase in the proportion with clinically significant
depression.
Conclusions: For members of an integrated delivery sys-
tem, the HS intervention was associated with positive ef-
fects on children's health and parenting practices. There
was little evidence of any additional benefit of HS ser-
vices initiated during the prenatal period.

THE HEALTHY STEPS FOR
Young Children program
(HS) was designed to sup-
port families of young chil-
dren using a new type of
healthcareprovider,theHSspecialist(HSS),
in a practice-based intervention.1 The HS
consists of risk reduction activities and uni-
versal components, including developmen-
talscreening,anticipatoryguidance,andfol-
low-up services, offered to all families
receivingcare.2-5 ExpectedbenefitsofHSin-

Evaluation of the program to date has dem-
onstrated improved timeliness and quality
ofpediatricservices,parentingpractices,and
parent satisfaction with services.5,7,8
In this trial, we investigated pediatric
usual care (UC) vs HS implemented with
and without PrePare (PP), a prenatal com-
ponent designed to begin the therapeutic
HSS-parent relationship during preg-
nancy. PrePare was delivered as 3 home
visits. The objective was to introduce the
HSS to the parents as a knowledgeable and
caring resource, helping them prepare for
the arrival of their newborn. The content
of the prenatal visits included informa-
tion about fetal and infant development,
home safety, and the material needs of
newborns and infants.9 Families who re-
ceived PP services continued to receive the
standard HS intervention from the same
HSS during the postnatal period.
Our tests of this intervention package
found no incremental benefits of PP (com-
pared with HS only) on parental well-
being, knowledge, or parenting practices
when the infants were 3 months of age.8
However, families who received PP were
more satisfied with their pediatric care and
were less likely to disenroll from the health
plan in the 12 months following the child's
birth. We hypothesized that organiza-

tional bonding might explain these positive effects of the
prenatal intervention and theorized, in turn, that ben-
efits for children and parents would become apparent dur-
ing infancy and toddlerhood.
Herein, we report results of tests for intervention ef-
fects on child health and development, parenting prac-
tices, and parental well-being when enrolled children were
30 months old. A quasi-experimental design was used
to compare intervention families with families who re-
ceived the health plan's usual complement of pregnancy
andpediatricservices.Withininterventionclinics,anested
randomized trial compared PPHS with HS only.
METHODS
SETTING AND DESIGN
This clinical trial was conducted from July 20, 1998, through
November 7, 2003, in a large integrated delivery system that
provides services to approximately 550 000 people located in
the Pacific Northwest. Three clinics received the intervention
while 2 other geographically distant clinics served as compari-
son sites. Within intervention clinics, enrolled families were
individually randomized to receive services beginning prena-
tally (PPHS) or postnatally (HS only). Data analysis was per-
formed in 2004.
RECRUITMENT AND ENROLLMENT
Recruitment was by review of obstetrical records in the sec-
ond trimester, followed by a letter of invitation, telephone screen-
ing, and an enrollment visit with study staff. To be eligible, preg-
nant women had to be at less than 22 weeks' gestation at study
enrollment, younger than 45 years, English speaking, and plan-
ning to use a study clinic for pediatric care. Enrollment oc-
curred from July 20, 1998, through September 29, 2000. Indi-
vidual randomization was performed centrally, stratified by
clinic, and blocked in groups of 4.
INTERVENTIONS
Four master's-level trained HSSs provided most of the interven-
tion program's services. Two HSSs had backgrounds in nursing,
one in clinical social work and one in mental health practice. All
received additional training and ongoing education in early child
development and in specific aspects of HS.9 Key clinicians and
other personnel from intervention clinic sites also received in-
tervention-related training. Enrollees randomized to HS were eli-
gible to receive postnatal home visits from an HSS; developmen-
tal advice and parent-initiated telephone support; developmental
assessments conducted in tandem with scheduled well-child care,
the Reach Out and Read literacy program, and other risk-based
screening services9; and parenting classes delivered by HSSs.
ThePPparticipantsbegantheinterventionbyreceiving3home
visits with their HSS when they were at approximately 20, 27,
and 34 weeks' gestation.10 The conceptual framework for PP drew
on findings of the psychological transition to parenthood,11 in
which adjustment to the maternal role requires renegotiation of
the current family structure to incorporate the unavoidable
changes that accompany the birth of a baby. In keeping with this
framework, the 3 home visits were structured to help parents
createasafe,knowing,andwelcomingenvironmentfortheirnew-
born.9 In addition, the PP participants received screening and
intervention for targeted risk factors, such as smoking, depres-
sion, and domestic violence. The HSS who provided prenatal ser-
vices continued to provide the standard package of HS services
following the birth of the infant. Comparison clinic enrollees re-
ceived the health plan's standard package of well-child pediat-
ric care, outreach, and support services.
The Group Health Cooperative Human Subjects Review
Committee reviewed the study. Informed consent was ob-
tained from all participating families.
DATA COLLECTION
Most outcome data were collected by telephone interview of
mothers at enrollment to the study (at 16-20 weeks' gesta-
tion), at 7 to 10 days post partum, when enrolled children were
3 months of age, and again when these children were at 30
months of age. Data on language acquisition were obtained by
mailed questionnaire at age 24 months. Health plan utiliza-
tion data were extracted from administrative databases.
The overall intervention goal was to improve child health
and developmental attainment by supporting appropriate parent-
ing practices. Herein, we present findings grouped into the fol-
lowing 3 domains: child health and development, parenting prac-
tices, and parental well-being.
OUTCOME MEASURES
Child Health and Development
We used immunization delivery and attainment of timely age-
appropriatewell-childcareasintermediatehealthoutcomes.Well-
child visits occurring within 60-day windows centered around
the health plan's recommended visits at 2, 4, 6, 10, 15, and 24
months were counted as "timely" preventive care. Among those
continuously enrolled for the first 2 years of life, the health plan's
standard Health Plan Employer Data and Information Set mea-
sure was used to identify children whose immunizations were up-
to-date at age 24 months (4 diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and
pertussis vaccines [or diphtheria and tetanus toxoids with acel-
lular pertussis vaccines], 3 oral polio vaccines or inactivated po-
liovirus vaccines, 1 measles-mumps-rubella vaccine, 2 Haemophi-
lus influenzae type b vaccines, and 3 hepatitis B vaccines).12
When enrolled children were 24 months old, parents com-
pleted a questionnaire that included elements of the short and
long forms of the MacArthur Communicative Development In-
ventories13 assessing single-word expressive vocabulary, word
combining (2 words), use of 3 or more word endings, and
mean length (in morphemes) of the child's 3 longest phrases.
Parental perception of child behavior problems was as-
sessed at 30 months by telephone using 3 subscales from the
Child Behavior Checklist.14 These included aggressive behav-
ior, sleep problems, and symptoms related to an anxious or de-
pressed mood.
Parenting Practices
The PP and HS interventions promoted parental knowledge of
child development, self-efficacy, and developmentally support-
ive parenting practices. Table 1 gives an overview of the con-
tinuous measures used to assess these constructs. For parent-
ing practices, we used established scales of nurturing behavior15
and parenting sense of competence.16 We developed and used
a brief measure of self-efficacy for pediatric health care (Table 1).
Other measures of parenting practices reported herein in-
clude frequency of activities to promote child development (in-
cluding reading or playing with the child), maintaining rou-
tines around bedtime and meal times, and limiting television
viewing. The proportion of mothers initiating breastfeeding and
engaging in any breastfeeding beyond 6 months is reported.

Mothers' reports of child injury prevention practices were
summed to create a 5-point index that reflected the presence
of a functioning smoke detector (1 point), regular use of a car
seat (1 point) in the correct position (1 point), and absence of
firearms in the home (2 points) or safe storage of any firearms
reported (1 point). We also asked about the use of 4 common
household safety items (safety latches, electrical outlet covers,
stair gates, and poison control center telephone number).
Mothers were asked about specific discipline strategies. The
proportion reporting any unusually harsh discipline (ie, slap-
ping on the face or spanking with an object) is reported.
Parental Well-being
The PP and HS interventions offered screening and referral for
maternal depression along with general social support from the
HSS. Maternal depressive symptoms were assessed using a modi-
fication of the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression
Scale17 (Table 1); the scores are reported herein along with the
proportion of respondents who reported "feelings of sadness"
that were discussed with someone in the pediatric practice.
Other measures of maternal well-being included self-
reported use of any illicit drug and the presence or absence of
significant physical domestic violence in the preceding 12
months ("Did your partner hit you, shove you, or kick you?").
"Problem drinkers" were identified according to accepted defi-
nitions based on reported alcohol consumption.18 Exposure to
environmental tobacco smoke was assessed as the proportion
of households with current smokers.
SAMPLE SIZE
Sample size estimates indicated that 100 enrollees per study
group were needed for analysis of our primary outcomes at 30
months. For example, with a total sample of 300, we could de-
tect (with 80% power at =.05) a difference of 0.28 SD when
the outcome measured was continuous.
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
We based all analyses on initial group assignment and made
adjustments to minimize differences due to the quasi-
experimental design. We used generalized linear models with
robust variance estimates to account for within-clinic cluster-
ing effects. To identify a parsimonious and consistent set of co-
variates for use in adjusted analyses, we examined all demo-
graphic data collected. No enrolled family had missing data at
baseline for these variables. One variable was selected from any
highly correlated pairs. Covariates were included if they dif-
fered statistically between the intervention and comparison
groups at baseline or if inclusion in an analytic model caused
point estimates of effect size to vary by more than 10%. Based
on these criteria, maternal education, family income, and sta-
tus as a first-time parent were used as covariates in our ad-
justed analyses. To account for norms used in scoring lan-
guage outcomes, these were also adjusted for the child's sex
and age at the time of the assessment. For all outcomes mea-
sured at baseline, we used statistical adjustment for these base-
line scores, providing a test of the intervention's effect on change
after enrollment.
For dichotomous outcomes, rate ratios (RRs) from Pois-
son models are presented. For continuous outcome variables,
we report adjusted linear regression coefficients. All estimates
are reported with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). All analyses
were performed using Stata 8.0 (StataCorp LP, College Sta-
tion, Tex).

founds, maternal education and maternal age (Table 2).
Therefore, we report unadjusted and adjusted compari-
sons for intervention vs comparison group outcomes.
The telephone interview at 30 months was com-
pleted by 77% of enrollees assigned to HS only, 81% of
those assigned to PPHS, and 77% of those assigned to
UC (Figure). Nonrespondents at 30 months had less ma-
ternal education and lower family incomes compared with
respondents. Nonrespondents in the intervention group
were more likely than comparison group nonrespon-
dents to be first-time parents (67% vs 53%) and be with-
out a spouse or partner (13% vs 3%). The mailed paper
survey was completed at 24 months by 71% of the HS-
only group, 74% of the PPHS group, and 68% of the
UC group.
OUTCOMES BY DOMAIN
Throughout this article, intervention vs UC compari-
sons are presented first. These are followed by results of
the randomized contrast between the PPHS and HS-
only groups.
Child Health and Development
Receipt of well-child care within specified time inter-
vals was more likely among intervention recipients than
comparison enrollees at 4, 6, and 15 months (Table 3).
Among the intervention recipients, the PPHS group was
more likely than the HS-only group to make a timely 24-
month visit (adjusted RR, 1.17 [95% CI, 1.08-1.27]). At
24 months, more intervention recipients than compari-
son enrollees were up to date for immunizations (90%
vs 85%; adjusted RR, 1.06 [95% CI, 1.02-1.09]); among
intervention recipients, full immunization was signifi-
cantly more common in the PPHS group (92%) than
in the HS-only group (88%).
Attainment of developmentally appropriate lan-
guage skills at 24 months did not differ between the in-
tervention and UC groups for vocabulary size, sentence
length, the proportion of children using 3 or more word
endings, or the proportion combining 2 or more words
(Table 3). Within the intervention group, the vocabu-
lary score of PPHS children, on average, exceeded that

of HS-only children by 4.08 (95% CI, 0.69-7.74) words,
and the proportion combining words in the PPHS group
exceeded the proportion in the HS-only group (93% vs
89%; adjusted RR, 1.05 [95% CI, 1.02-1.08]).
Group differences in the Child Behavior Checklist
scores showed that parents in the intervention group re-
ported higher scores than those in the UC group on the
aggressive behavior subscale (7.74 vs 6.80; adjusted ,
0.83 [95% CI, 0.37-1.30]), although neither group reached
a subscale score of clinical significance (the cutoff for this
age is 22 years) (Table 3).14 There were no group differ-
ences in reported sleep problems or problems with de-
pression or anxiety. Although children in the PPHS
group were reported to have more anxious or depressed
behaviors than those in HS-only group ( level, 0.40 [95%
CI, 0.07-0.73]), the mean scores were well below the range
of clinical significance.
Parenting Practices
Within the intervention group, 97% of mothers initi-
ated breastfeeding compared with 91% in the UC group
(adjusted RR, 1.06 [95% CI, 1.00-1.11]) (Table 4). In-
tervention recipients who initiated breastfeeding also
breastfed their infants longer on average than the UC re-
cipients (13.4 vs 11.2 months; adjusted , 1.30 [95% CI,
0.18-2.43]). The proportion of intervention mothers who
breastfed for 6 months or longer19 was higher (82%) than
that of UC mothers (64%). No difference was found be-
tween the PPHS and the HS-only groups.
There were no group differences in parents' nurtur-
ing behavior or self-efficacy for pediatric health care.
Parenting sense of competence was slightly lower among
intervention recipients ( level, -0.92 [95% CI, -1.40 to
-0.44]), an effect driven by lower scores on the satisfac-
tion subscale rather than by differences in self-efficacy
(Table 4).
Parents in the intervention group were more likely to
report the use of routines in the home (adjusted RR, 1.12
[95% CI, 1.03-1.22]) and were 25% less likely than those
in the UC group to allow more than 1 hour of daily tele-
vision viewing (34% vs 50%; adjusted RR, 0.75 [95% CI,
0.62-0.90]). Within the intervention group, recipients of
PPHS reported that they were less likely to read to their
child daily (88% vs 95%) and were more likely to allow
more than 1 hour of television viewing (39% vs 28%) com-
pared with recipients of HS only.
Respondents in the intervention group were almost
20% more likely than those in the UC group to score the
full 5 points on the index of injury control behaviors
(smoke detector function, car seat use, and gun safety
items). Intervention families were also more likely to use
stair gates (adjusted RR, 1.19 [95% CI, 1.15-1.23]) and
to have access to the local poison control center's tele-
phone number (adjusted RR, 1.08 [95% CI, 1.03-
1.12]), but they were less likely to report having safety

latches on cabinets (Table 4). Intervention families were
54% less likely to report the use of extreme disciplinary
measures (ie, slapping the child's face or spanking with
an object) than UC families (adjusted RR, 0.46 [95% CI,
0.29-0.73]).
Parental Well-being
When the study children were 30 months old, maternal
depressive symptoms scores on the Center for Epide-
miological Studies Depression Scale were generally low
(Table 5). The intervention respondents reported slightly
more distress than the UC respondents on these mea-
sures (adjusted , 0.75 [95% CI, 0.20-1.31]) but were
no more likely to score above the clinical cutoff for an
affective disorder. The elevated 30-month Center for Epi-
demiological Studies Depression Scale scores in the in-
tervention group were driven by a higher prevalence of
depressive symptoms among the PPHS group (a dif-
ference not present at baseline). Among those who were
self-identified as having problems with depression or sad-
ness, 53% in the HS-only group and 49% in the PPHP
group said that they had discussed these concerns with
someone in the pediatric practice, compared with only
35% of those in the UC group (adjusted RR, 1.45 [95%
CI, 0.95-2.21]).
Only a small proportion of respondents reported any
use of illicit drugs or exposure to significant physical do-
mestic violence in the preceding year. No group differ-
ences in these outcomes were detected. Although screen-
ing and referral for smoking cessation services were
included in both arms, the low proportion of house-

COMMENT
The HS has been shown to improve the quality of child
health services and parental satisfaction in diverse prac-
tice settings.7 When children in this study were 3 months
old, an evaluation demonstrated that HS with or with-
out PP was associated with improved parental knowl-
edge, practice, well-being, and satisfaction.8 When the
children were 30 months old, there were additional posi-
tive effects on the receipt of timely well-child care, im-
munization rates, duration of breastfeeding, and parent-
ing practices to prevent childhood injury, to increase the
use of household daily living routines, to minimize tele-
vision viewing, and to reduce the use of inappropriate
discipline techniques.
An important feature of HS is the universal nature of
the intervention. Parenting support programs have been
shown to have positive effects among families with young
infants at high psychosocial risk.20-25 Our results suggest
abenefitfromtheuniversalprovisionofparentingandchild
development support services to an unselected sample of
families with health coverage, who ranged from the afflu-
ent and employed to those at greater socioeconomic and
psychosocial risk. This is a meaningful result.
There was no difference in response to the interven-
tion according to the HSS assigned (data not shown). All
were experienced master's-level clinicians. Whether para-
professionals with other backgrounds could produce simi-
lar outcomes is unknown and should not be assumed.26
Dose-response analyses are an appealing strategy to iden-
tify the intensity of intervention required to elicit de-
sired effects; however, they are not applicable in this trial.
The intervention was clinic based, involving office staff,
providers, and systems of care. The effect of these changes
in the milieu of care cannot easily be delineated from the
effect of countable visits or encounters with the HSS.
Despite the noted improvements in child health and
parenting practices, the intervention was associated with
some undesirable effects. Intervention recipients re-
ported more depressive symptoms and a diminished
parenting sense of competence that stemmed from less
satisfaction in the parenting role. Whether this reflects
an increase in symptoms or an increased accuracy and
willingness to identify and report symptoms is un-
known. Differences in neither baseline rates of depres-
sion nor maternal education explain these findings. For-
tunately, the number of depressive symptoms in any group
was low when enrolled children reached 2Â½ years old.
Nevertheless, more investigation of the interaction among
the intervention, parenting experience, and maternal men-
tal health outcomes seems warranted.
A major objective of this study was to test a new model
for delivering HS services capitalizing on the strengths
of an integrated delivery system. To do so, we added a
prenatal component. Despite increased member satis-
faction and decreased health plan disenrollment in the
early postnatal period, the only long-term health ben-
efits from PP seemed to be (1) greater compliance with
the 24-month well-child visit, with a concurrent im-
provement in immunization status, and (2) modestly in-
creased vocabulary production and word combination at
24 months. Paradoxically, these developmental attain-
ments were seen in a group that reported more depres-
sive symptoms, more television viewing, and less daily
reading to the children. These findings in the PPHS arm
cannot be explained using the data available to us.
There are several potential limitations in this trial. Al-
though we were gratified to achieve a 78% retention rate
in the study during 3 years, there remain significant dif-
ferences in the demographic composition of nonrespon-
dents in the intervention group compared with the UC
group, and within the randomized treatment groups as
well. The comparisons between the combined interven-
tion and UC groups were limited by the quasi-
experimental design. Although we adjusted for several

important baseline covariates and for clustering within
clinics, unmeasured residual confounding likely exists.
Overall, we believe that our implementation of HS in
an integrated delivery system resulted in positive effects
for parents and their children. These must be weighed
against costs of the intervention, its effects on utiliza-
tion, provider satisfaction, and satisfaction of health plan
enrollees. These outcomes will be assessed in future stud-
ies, and policy implications of the findings will be dis-
cussed in subsequent publications.
