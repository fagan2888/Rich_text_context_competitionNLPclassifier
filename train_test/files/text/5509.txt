Introduction
Bullying at work, a severe form of anti-social behaviour, has
become an issue of major concern to workers, organizations,
unions and governments. It has also received considerable
attention in organizational behaviour and human resource
management research over the past 20+ years.
O'Driscoll et al. (2011, p. 390)
At the root of my concern about the use of the term bullying
is that the term is relatively superficially understood and
bullying actions are difficult to pinpoint and examine, and
even more difficult to address--particularly bullying con-
ducted by leaders. In this article, I focus on each of these
concerns. No attempt is made to deeply examine the wide
international research from the perspective of psychological
or organizational outcomes associated with the topic of bul-
lying from authors such as Bowling and Beehr (2006),
Sheehan and Griffiths (2011), Nielsen, Matthiesen, and
Einarsen (2010), or bullying from varied levels in the hier-
archy (Wallace, Johnston, & Trenberth, 2010). Instead, like
those of Van Rooyen and McCormack (2013) and Jenkins,
Winefield, and Sarris (2011), to some degree, this article
does include an attempt to pinpoint bullying by reporting
employee perceptions and also considers how bullying
behavior emerges within the social dynamics of a workplace
(Klein & Martin, 2011).
The pinpointing of bullying occurs by viewing behaviors
through a reasonably high resolution lens: a lens illuminating
bullying as a set of defensive (i.e., control and, or, avoidance)
strategies and values perpetrated by leaders and managers
(from here on, the term leader is used to encompass both
terms). The advantage of this alternate view is the associa-
tion with a concrete approach to objectively identify, exam-
ine, and analyze bullying behavior. The defensive lens also
provides ideas on how to address the behavior.
After briefly defining and contextualizing bullying (par-
ticularly within the Canadian and New Zealand contexts),
theorizing of the defensive lens is followed by a review of
approaches to overcome defensiveness and bullying. Specific
note is made of approaches that are productive and have a
learning organization orientation. In the theoretical section
of the article, my role is outlined for the implementation of
organizational learning strategies to address bullying through
elaboration of a holistic evidence-based learning (HEBL)
model.
Two authentic scenarios of leaders accused of bullying
are used to illustrate the way the HEBL model has been
adopted, particularly the use of analysis through a defensive
lens. Both overt leader behaviors and behaviors that are more
covert and manipulative are revealed. Regardless of whether
overt or covert, these defensive behaviors are shown to have
much the same affect regarding lowering staff morale and
frustration, as well as reducing individual and organizational
performance. Finally in this article, a legal opinion is offered

Leader Bullying Through a Different Lens
Eileen Piggot-Irvine1
Abstract
An interpretation of bullying as a set of defensive values and strategies is established via the use of two scenario case studies.
The origins of defensiveness are explored alongside introduction to a holistic evidence-based learning (HEBL) model based
on an organizational learning, productive set of values and strategies, to overcome this problem in a way that contributes
to a learning organization. A legal opinion about case law associated with bullying confirms the appropriateness of such
organizational learning approaches to address this problem and avoid litigation. The extensive literature about defensiveness
and organizational learning has not been previously widely considered in association with bullying behaviors. This conceptual
article is intended to stimulate further interest to make the link between defensiveness and bullying behaviors.

on consideration of bullying through a defensive lens and the
ways to overcome it via organizational learning.
Defining and Contextualizing Bullying
In Canada, the concepts of bullying and psychological
harassment are often used interchangeably. Those two con-
cepts must also be distinguished from harassment generally,
which is protected under the human rights codes across the
country. A useful way to understand the concepts is to locate
them under the larger category of workplace violence,
defined by the International Labour Organization and
referred to by the Canada Safety Council as " . . . incidents
where persons are abused, threatened or assaulted in circum-
stances related to their work, involving an explicit or implicit
challenge to their safety, well-being or health" (Hoel, Sparks,
& Cooper, 2001, p. 14). The category of workplace violence
captures all forms of harassment, bullying, and physical
violence.
Many definitions exist for psychological harassment and
bullying (hereafter referred to by the single term, bullying).
Goncalves (2007), relying on the Canadian Centre for
Occupational Health and Safety definition, stated that bully-
ing represents an attempt by one person to assert control and
exercise power through the humiliation or harassment of
another. Bullying often denotes intimidatory behavior, which
is inappropriate and has occurred over a period often desig-
nated as 6 months or longer. The behavior can be covert (the
more common and of more significant psychological affect)
or overt according to Baron, Newman, and Geddes (1999).
An example of both covert and overt behaviors is evident in
the workplace policy about bullying and harassment in a
public university, which notes verbal aggression or insults,
calling someone derogatory names, harmful hazing or initia-
tion practices, vandalizing personal belongings, and spread-
ing malicious rumors (Public University, 2013).
Bullying includes destructive and demeaning behaviors
that can be difficult to see and identify and is more prevalent
than other harassing behavior (e.g., sexual harassment and
racial discrimination) proscribed by human rights codes
(Canadian Safety Council, 2015). Furthermore, physical vio-
lence is often reported from outside sources, such as custom-
ers, students, and patients, whereas psychological violence
of the bullying type is more often reported from within the
organization.
In Canada, bullying typically is not fully covered in the
human rights codes. Recourse and remedies for bullying
must be obtained through employer policies and provisions
in collective agreements. Although some provinces have leg-
islated recourse for psychological harassment, that recourse
is usually only available for instances of physical threats or
acts. However, the province of Quebec has legislated protec-
tion for psychological harassment, and a similar view exists
in New Zealand. Wallace et al. (2010) noted that although the
responsibility is with the organization to ensure the safety
and well-being of employees, employers are liable for pros-
ecution if they do not take preventive measures to minimize
workplace stress and fatigue, or create a climate conducive
to, or causing, stress.
To identify the elements that constitute bullying,
Goncalves (2007) viewed these as behaviors that are recur-
ring and persistent, obvious or subtle, not restricted to enu-
merated grounds, and identified through emotional effects.
The damage from bullying behavior at a personal level was
summarized by Wallace et al. (2010) to cover loss of self-
esteem, diminished physical and emotional health, and cog-
nitive functioning to those bullied. Bullying also affects
families of those bullied as well as those who witness work-
place bullying. Furthermore, the loss to productivity to orga-
nizations and society is profound when considering loss of
performance and staff turnover (Greenberg & Scott, 1996) to
the extent that Beswick, Gore, and Palferman (2006) esti-
mated that bullying-related stress may cost U.K. employers
370 to 740 million pounds per year.
Bullying by leaders has become a predominant and
increasing concern (Mee Kwan, Tuckey, & Dollard, 2014;
O'Driscoll et al., 2011; Rayner, Hoel, & Cooper, 2002; Salin,
2003; Wallace et al., 2010) and the terms workplace bullying
and leader bullying, in my consulting experience with hun-
dreds of organizations, are considerably feared by many
leaders themselves. Bullying, for these leaders, has fre-
quently become associated with possible consequences for
leaders, from reputational slurs through to formal investiga-
tions of behavior, litigation, and potential loss of career.
I have observed that leaders accused of bullying, and the
chief executives (CEs) trying to resolve the accusations,
have felt overwhelmingly helpless about how to deal with
such claims because both those accused and leaders often
find bullying a nebulous notion--a situation not helped by
the lack of research on how to deal with bullying noted by
Mikkelsen, Hogh, and Puggard (2011). Also observed, and
noted by Bryant, Buttigieg, and Hanley (2009), is that some-
times CEs in this situation of helplessness have minimized
the bullying complaints and have adopted a compliance
rather than preventive approach to dealing with bullying
behavior. Such minimizing is at odds with a call for manage-
ment commitment (Vartia & Leka, 2011). The minimizing is
also at odds with my adoption of an approach used for iden-
tifying, analyzing, and addressing bullying, which is objec-
tive and diagnostic, emphasizes high ownership by those
accused of bullying, while aiming to be supportive and
developmental with an underpinning organizational learning
stance. Central to this approach is the adoption of a view of
bullying through a defensive lens.
Bullying Through a Defensive Lens
Dick and Dalmau (1999) summarized defensiveness as rooted
in " . . . adversarial and competitive . . ." (p. 47) values. At a
deeper level, Argyris (2003) described that defensiveness is
Piggot-Irvine 3
derived from a tendency to protect ourselves and others from
potential threat and embarrassment. Competitiveness, self-
protection, and protecting others are manifest in strategies
such as
. . . covering up or withholding vital information or evidence,
bypassing threatening conversations, and being indirect by
giving mixed rather than clear messages. These strategies of
defensiveness are generally summarized under categories
of avoidance and control (striving to win) . . . they are at the root
of misunderstandings, distortions and misinterpretations.
(Piggot-Irvine, 2012, p. 97)
Covering up, withholding and blocking information,
bypassing (and gatekeeping), indirectness, and providing
mixed messages are all evident at what could be described as
a more subtle level of defensiveness in bullying cases that I
have experienced. Evident also have been less subtle strate-
gies such as outright tyranny, deceit, threat, and oppression.
Whether subtle or overt, unilateral decision-making predom-
inates in defensive behaviors, and further unpacking reveals
avoidance and control underpinnings (Argyris, 2003; Cardno,
2001; Dick & Dalmau, 1999; Piggot-Irvine, 2012).
Unfortunately, defensiveness among leaders prevails. As
Bifano (1989) suggested several years before workplace bul-
lying or leader bullying were catchphrases, "Grounded in
over a decade of research that was conducted in all types of
settings . . . Argyris and Schön concluded that defensive
behaviour is the predominant . . . orientation" (p. 60). Nothing
suggests that this orientation has changed--Only the termi-
nology of bullying has changed.
Multiple affects on staff resulting from defensiveness are
also linked to bullying, including poor performance, low
morale, burnout, and low trust. These influences resonate
with the findings of a large-scale survey of staff, which indi-
cated to O'Driscoll et al. (2011) that bullying " . . . was sig-
nificantly correlated with higher levels of strain, reduced
well-being, reduced commitment to their organization, and
lower self-rated performance" (p. 309). The results of bully-
ing work against the creation of a learning organization if
these strategies prevail because they are damaging for the
leader, their staff, the organization, clients, and society.
Approaches to Overcoming
Defensiveness (and Bullying)
Strategies for overcoming defensiveness, and bullying, often
fall under an organizational learning approach. Organizational
learning occurs when the source of problems can be discov-
ered and addressed (Boreham & Morgan, 2004; Senge et al.,
2000; Sun & Scott, 2003). InArgyris's (1977) terms, organiza-
tional learning is a " . . . process of detecting and correcting
error. Error is for our purposes any feature of knowledge or
knowing that inhibits learning" (p. 116). Organizational learn-
ing leads to a learning organization in which, as Hodgkinson
(2000) noted, there exists a " . . . coming together of individu-
als to enable them to support and encourage one another's
learning, which will in the longer term be of benefit to the
organization" (p. 157).
Overcoming defensive bullying via the employment of
organizational learning strategies first requires understanding
of both the roots of threat and self-protection and also includes
the challenge of shifting such defensive strategies. Because
defensiveness is largely seen as a set of conditioned behaviors
learned and well established in early childhood years, unfortu-
nately, such behaviors are hard to change in adulthood because
they are usually well rehearsed and quite deeply embedded.
Shifting a defensive bullying response
. . . requires significant, profound, shifts involving exposure,
examination and alteration of defensive values at a deeply
personal level which is both cognitively and emotionally
difficult and is a lengthy process. . . . the approach on its own is
extremely complex and usually involves months, maybe years,
of training. The reason for this is that the approach requires
rethinking and altering our underlying value systems, and this
involves changing many automatic, conditioned responses.
Such values and responses cannot be changed in two hours!
(Piggot-Irvine & Doyle, 2010, p. 61)
Edmondson (1996) emphasized the intensity of behavior
and value shifting required to overcome defensiveness and
suggested that this involved "profound attentiveness" (p.
585). Altering values and responses also needs a high degree
of self-honesty on the part of those wanting to change (Dick
& Dalmau, 1999). Such change is possible, and I have seen
considerable alteration of defensive bullying behavior when
leaders have been willing to learn new approaches that target
shifting defensive values and strategies to what are often
described as productive approaches in the organizational
learning field (Argyris, 2003).
Essentially, adopting productive values and strategies
involves openness to sharing ideas and, equally, inquiring
into and receiving ideas of others. Adopting these values and
strategies necessitates working more collaboratively and
consensually in decision making because a fundamental goal
is to understand others' views. Valuing evidence and data
from all perspectives when making decisions and withhold-
ing assumptions until those data are checked by all involved
is also important. Any prejudgment and jumping to prema-
ture conclusions are minimized in a productive approach.
Such an approach presupposes a need to be open to challenge
by others without getting highly defensive in response.
Working with rather than over staff is important here and that
includes engaging them in finding their own solutions when
confronted with problems but doing so in a way that is sup-
portive. Treating staff fairly and consistently is also a feature
of a productive approach.
In summary, using values of honesty, openness, authenticity,
and being non-judgmental, democratic, rigorous, and respectful
underpin the strategies used in such an organizational learning
4 SAGE Open
approach. In a previous publication, I have shown that collec-
tively, these values and strategies (as summarized in Table 1)
can combine to result in higher trust between leaders and staff
(Piggot-Irvine & Doyle, 2010).
The values and strategies outlined in Table 1 align with
two of the four organizational responses identified by
O'Driscoll et al. (2011) as those effective in addressing bul-
lying: encouraging open and respectful communication, and
encouraging appropriate interactions between staff.
O'Driscoll et al. described the responses more at a level of
underpinning values but did not elaborate on the detail of the
specific strategies associated with how to be open or respect-
ful. The right-hand side of Table 1 begins this elaboration.
The full complexity of the specific strategies and develop-
ment protocols involved in learning to become a productive
leader are too profound to outline in detail in this article (see
Piggot-Irvine, 2012, for such detail). Briefly, learning a pro-
ductive approach almost always engages multiple iterative
cycles of development to enhance skills and strategies for
recognizing and overcoming defensiveness and for incorpo-
rating productive approaches such as staying low on the lad-
der of inference, balancing inquiry and advocacy approaches
in dialogue when working with staff, sharing rather than
withholding information and reasoning, and creating bilat-
eral solutions. Such learning is reinforced with continuing
skill implementation alongside further analysis and reflec-
tion to ensure that non-defensive practices are deployed.
Most importantly, the learning approach outlined needs to
be holistic regarding extending beyond the individual leader
to the team and organizational levels. This holistic approach
is intentional and aligns with a philosophy that attempting to
change the bullying behavior of the individual leader, or
reacting in response solely to the target (Namie & Namie,
2003), alone is insufficient for the organization.
In the HEBL model developed to address bullying in a
productive and holistic way, there are six steps for learning.
The steps, outlined on the right side in Table 2, constitute an
expansion of an original process for overcoming defensive
behaviors suggested by Argyris (1990), and later elaborated
by Argyris and Schön (1974). In the left column, a descriptor
is provided for the roles the facilitator (or consultant) plays
in these steps.
To elaborate the HEBL model a little further, each role
and step is described. First, the facilitator works with senior
executives in the organization to clarify the specific behav-
iors associated with what has been considered to be bullying
by a leader. Clarification usually includes gathering specific
feedback from the CE and staff and summarizing the feed-
back under the headings of leader behaviors and affects. In
my experience, CEs struggle to determine which behaviors
constitute bullying and which do not, and this first clarifica-
tion step is critical to creating objectivity.
The second role played by the facilitator is somewhat akin
to a counselor with the accused bullying leaders themselves.
The facilitator shares the summarized leader behaviors and
affects with the accused, allows them time to reflect on these,
and responds to any questions they have. The accused lead-
ers are usually dealing with extreme stress and anxiety, and
addressing that through a range of counseling type tools is an
initial focus.
Once the stress is reduced, the third role played by the
facilitator is to confront the issues (note that this does not
imply a confrontational style) by guiding the accused leaders
to analyze their perception of the type of behavior that pre-
dominates and understand its origins.
The fourth role is intimately and intensely developmental
where the facilitator guides the accused to learn new, more
productive, non-defensive, non-bullying ways to work with
their staff. The learning is heavily interspersed with contin-
ual practice, followed by analysis and self- and shared reflec-
tion with the facilitator. The leaders are encouraged to journal
their reflections throughout.
The fifth role played is a broader developmental one with
all staff that often happens in tandem with the one-to-one
work with the accused bullying leaders. Here, the facilitator
conducts theory-informed yet experientially based sessions
with teams to identify and overcome bullying behavior at all
levels in the organization. The sessions (1 to 2 days in length)
cover identification of defensive bullying responses, theo-
retical underpinnings, and approaches to overcoming defen-
siveness and dealing with conflict in productive ways.
Sixth, and most important, is the adoption of a role of rais-
ing awareness of the importance of senior leadership taking
a systems-wide perspective on addressing bullying. The
facilitator usually works to ensure that senior leaders are
aware that creating highly effective systems and structures
within the entire organization is an important precursor to

lowering leader stress and consequently enhancing more
positive approaches for leaders interacting with their staff.
The HEBL model includes several of the stimulating fac-
tors for interventions to address bullying summarized from
previous literature by Mikkelsen et al. (2011). The model
adopts a stepwise and systematic approach, implements mea-
sures that fit in with the targeted problems, has a participa-
tive approach, has the sustained commitment of top
management, attempts to build trustful relationships between
the organization and consultant (or researcher), and attempts
to develop an organizational culture that is able to use con-
structive conflict to overcome disagreements and resistance.
Two scenarios of leaders accused of bullying are used to
briefly introduce the first two roles played and the steps in
this learning-oriented model. More extensive illustration and
elaboration of the third of the roles and steps are provided.
Background and Scenarios
Before discussing the scenarios, I note that the history of my
relationship with the public sector organization was exten-
sive (more than 10 years) with incremental trust establish-
ment a feature of the history. The process in which that trust
was developed could be the feature of another article, but
suffice to say that trust was based on employment of a strong
emphasis on practicing non-defensive values and strategies
such as collaboration and understanding of the organization
culture that enabled employment interventions that were
fully discussed with the CE and considered appropriate.
Trust was not ostensibly limited in this context in the way
that it could have created an obstruction (Mikkelsen et al.,
2011): an obstruction I have experienced in other contexts
where I have not had the privilege of such a long-term
relationship.
The two middle level leaders accused of bullying behav-
ior used in the following scenarios were in what might be
described as third tier, that is, just below the CE (first tier)
and senior leadership (second tier) levels. Each had teams of
up to 25 staff working for them. To ensure anonymity in the
scenarios, the sector will not be identified other than to say it
was a public service organization of approximately 300 staff.
In both scenarios (which were approximately 6 months
apart), I was called in when the CE had received consider-
able written and verbal negative feedback from staff of each
leader that was quickly followed by accusations of bullying.
The CE had struggled to distinguish whether a situation of
bullying existed or not.
The earlier described first HEBL role was initially imple-
mented with these scenarios. As facilitator, I acted as advisor
to the CE to assist with objectively clarifying the strategies
that each leader was implementing. Clarification was
achieved by asking the CE to discern his own feedback and
the staff feedback on the accused leader behaviors and the
possible affects of those behaviors. Tables 3 and 4 represent
the summary statements made by the CE and staff. As the
facilitator, I avoided editing or analysis of the feedback
because the feedback was to be used subsequently to ensure
high levels of ownership with the two accused.
Confronting and Analyzing the
Behaviors and Affects
Once the CE had clarified the leader behaviors and affects,
the next roles played in this bullying accusation involved
working with the two accused leaders themselves. The pro-
cess began by presenting the leaders with the feedback as
shown in Tables 3 and 4, and ensuring the leaders had time to
reflect on this feedback and to ask any questions about the
information. Initially, considerable time was needed to allow
the leaders to resolve some of their stress about the accusa-
tions (Role 2 in the HEBL model). This delicate, almost
counseling, element is not the focus of this article, although
counseling is a critical element. In summary, good listening,
clarifying, and reflecting counseling skills were used.
Work with the leaders in the third HEBL role was in con-
fronting the issues by guiding the accused leaders to use a
defensive lens to unpack and analyze the behaviors that oth-
ers had summarized. They were asked to analyze the behav-
iors as either controlling (C) strategies or avoiding (A), or a

combination of both (A/C), as shown in Tables 3 and 4. The
accused leaders (like most people) found it difficult to easily
distinguish avoidance and control, with frequent A/C com-
bined categorization shown in the two tables. To demonstrate
such blurring, the first example of categorization of A/C
from Table 3 is provided. Here, the description of leader
behavior notes,
Work submitted by due date by staff but then sat in leader in-tray
for over a week awaiting proofreading with result of a deadline
for a client being missed. (A/C)
Note that this behavior is reported in the affect column as
"Seen as deliberate procrastination with outcome of loss of
respect by client." The word deliberate is important here. If
the behavior is viewed as deliberate, a likelihood exists that
the leader's subtle avoidance strategy could be quite manipu-
lative control in disguise. Such subtlety is not lost on the staff
and, in my experience, is often perceived as more damaging
than outright control. As one employee stated, "I would
rather have the knife put in from the front than deviously
from behind. At least I can see the knife coming when it's in
front of me!" To reiterate the point, avoidance can be a devi-
ous and dangerous form of control. The A/C categorization
used in the tables indicates that control--although subtle--is
evident.
Following the analysis of behaviors, the accused leaders
drew up a summary of the important strategies that they con-
sidered they had been using, as represented in Table 5.
The Table 5 summary indicates a picture of defensive
behavior with some strategies overlapping and others not.
The leader in Scenario 2 is a more typical example of overt
controlling strategies: The leader in Scenario 1 has a more
manipulative style. In both scenarios, multiple examples
exist of covering up and withholding and blocking informa-
tion, bypassing (and gatekeeping), indirectness, and provid-
ing mixed messages. Examples are also evident of outright
tyranny, threat, and oppression more overtly shown in
Scenario 2. Unilateral decision-making predominates for
both of the leaders, although again more overtly in Scenario
2, as do alienation of staff, deceit, and inconsistency.
Misunderstandings, distortions, and misinterpretations are

clearly demonstrated, as are multiple other affects on staff
linked to poor performance, low morale, burnout, and low
trust. Restricted inclusivity and collaboration with staff,
limited ownership of work, lowered morale, heightened
staff frustration and helplessness, and staff feelings of poor
support are likely to be linked to reduced performance, low
engagement, and low trust in the leader.
The defensive strategies for both leaders fall within defi-
nitions of bullying. Whether overt or covert, the avoidance
and control strategies that the two leaders demonstrated are
derived from deep values, and these strategies often go unde-
tected with individuals until they are in stressed situations:
situations that are common in leadership positions. I believe
that these stressed situations can be exacerbated at an organi-
zational level when poor senior leadership and dysfunctional
systems and structures prevail. In other words, blame for
increased defensiveness should never be fully attributed to
an individual leader. For this reason, as noted earlier in this
article, striving to address issues at a more holistic level is
important.
As part of the developmental work conducted with the
accused leaders, I provided each with some background to
defensiveness after they had analyzed the summarized
Leadership Behaviors as avoidance, control, or combination
strategies. These two leaders were no different to almost all
others I have conducted similar work with. They did not need
someone else to indicate what the dominant, or target, areas
of concern were. They were quick to analyze those them-
selves and were considerably more critical than I would ever
have been.
After the analysis and summary of strategies was com-
pleted, the accused leaders were guided to prioritize what

they believed they needed to address first as a defensive bul-
lying behavior. Addressing one issue at a time has been criti-
cal to the success of improvement in addressing bullying
concerns: Anything more seems to create overwhelm. In the
case of the Scenario 1 leader, the focus was on attempting to
be more transparent when providing information to staff. The
Scenario 2 leader focused on reducing micro-management
and scrutiny of staff work. The next task for the accused
leaders was to carry out these improvements in the develop-
mental step. In both scenarios, this development period was
approximately a year, reflecting the depth of shifts in behav-
ior needed. Throughout this development, the leaders itera-
tively implemented improvements and reflected on those
individually as well as with me as facilitator.
Approximately 1 year after this approach was adopted with
the leaders, the CE and staff were asked to provide feedback
on improvements. In both cases, the feedback indicated shifts
in the predominantly controlling strategies of the leaders.
A Legal Lens on the Scenarios
In New Zealand, workplace bullying can be addressed through
prosecution. As the earlier descriptions of bullying indicate, in
Canada, recourse and remedies must be addressed through
employer policies and, or, provisions in collective agreements.
Case law in Canada, however, provides precedence for heavy
penalties, as the following example legal cases indicate. In Shah
v. Xerox Canada (2000, O.J. No. 849, QL), the employee's
supervisor engaged in name-calling, insults, shouting, and angry
outbursts, which were not contradicted. These contributed to
employee intimidation, demeanment, and humiliation. The
judge was satisfied that no employee should have to tolerate
such conduct and awarded her 2 months wages ($Ca13,381)
and $Ca3,500 for mental distress.
In CUPE L. 2086 v. Houston (2008, B.C.C.A.A.A. No.
118, QL), the employee's supervisor deliberately demeaned
the employee by asking him to wash his truck, telling him to
come in through the back door, and undermined his role as
union president by questioning why he was at the district
office in front of other employees. In this case, the arbitrator
ordered less punitive remedies to assist the parties to improve
the workplace environment; the arbitrator ordered them to
develop a harassment policy within 6 weeks, or she would
impose resurrection of labor-management meetings with
outside assistance and that a trouble shooter role be estab-
lished to resolve grievances expeditiously.
In Piresferreira v.Ayotte and Bell Mobility Inc. (2008), it was
found that abusive (the leader swore, raised his voice, pushed
her away) treatment by a supervisor caused posttraumatic stress
disorder and that the employer was liable for the supervisor's
action (a point that was later appealed). The employee was
awarded$500,000bytheSupremeCourt;thecasewasappealed,
and the damages were reduced to $148,000.
This selection of case law in Canada is indicative of
increased attention to penalty associated with grievances
resulting from management bullying. The types of bullying
behaviors noted as intimidating, demeaning, and abusive all
fit within the defensive category of control described in this
article. They are behaviors exhibited individually, which pro-
foundly influence the ability of an organization to be seen as
a learning organization where individuals " . . . support and
encourage one another's learning" (Hodgkinson, 2000, p.
157). In each of the cases, judgment clearly showed that such
behavior is not tolerable, and in the second case of CUPE v.
Houston, the arbitrator provided a strong message of a need
to improve workplace policy and practice.
Conclusion
The two scenarios indicate that outcomes of defensiveness
and bullying work against the creation of a learning organi-
zation because they are damaging for the leader, the staff, the
organization, clients, and society if these aggressive strate-
gies prevail. Those outcomes also align with O'Driscoll
et al.'s (2011) large-scale survey of staff which indicated that
bullying " . . . was significantly correlated with higher levels
of strain, reduced well-being, reduced commitment to their
organization, and lower self-rated performance" (p. 309).
Both the scenarios and the cases cited in the legal opinion
highlight that the time is overdue for organizations to take
responsibility for ensuring that leader bullying is addressed
if they wish to be seen as a learning organization. Such
responsibility, however, goes significantly beyond the proac-
tive suggestions raised by Van Rooyen and McCormack
(2013) for training, or the awareness raising sessions that
Sheehan and Griffiths (2011) referred to, or " . . . the

`whistle-blowing' and `dignity at work' policies and a raft of
mediation techniques" (p. 24) claimed as inadequate by
Klein and Martin (2011). Although each of the latter
approaches has merit--and they are components of the fifth
and sixth steps in the HEBL model--in my experience, these
elements alone do not deeply enough address bullying at the
individual leader level. For this reason, the steps addressing
individual development (Steps 1-4) and those that target
organizational development (Steps 5-6) are required. In this
way, leaders, employers, and staff can adopt the practical
productive values and strategies associated with organiza-
tional learning described in this article.
If the six HEBL steps are well-practiced and embedded in
the organization, in my experience, those steps can reduce
the type of litigation noted earlier. More important, at a
broader level, HEBL can create a culture of encouraging
open and respectful communication, and strengthening inter-
actions between staff in ways that establish sustainably pro-
ductive, learning workplaces. Such culture shifting is in
keeping with Sheehan and Griffiths's (2011) conclusion:
"We further contend that workplace health management, and
a corporate culture based on partnership, trust and respect,
offers considerable potential to move the agenda forward"
(p. 10). HEBL is key to moving the culture forward.
Limitations
This article is limited by restriction to scenarios within one
organization. The scenarios, however, have highlighted fac-
tors that illustrate a link between defensiveness and bullying
as well as supporting outcomes from bullying identified by
multiple other authors (Baron et al., 1999; Goncalves, 2007;
Mikkelsen et al., 2011; O'Driscoll et al., 2011; Vartia &
Leka, 2011) and approaches for overcoming bullying
(Sheehan & Griffiths, 2011; Van Rooyen & McCormack,
2013). The scenarios are also typical of more than 20 other
similar sets of behaviors in accused leader bullying cases
where I have intervened.
The article has a developmental focus on the intervention
approach to identifying and addressing bullying rather than
providing research to establish the efficacy of the HEBL
model steps discussed. This could be seen as a further limita-
tion and adds to the concern of Mikkelsen et al. (2011) that
. . . lack of research based knowledge on how to prevent in
particular bullying at work. As such, only a few research based
articles on prevention of bullying have been published in the 14
year span since . . . 1996. (p. 85)
Although not specific to the context of the scenarios pre-
sented in this article, process and milieu post hoc evaluation
data collection has demonstrated that behavioral shifts
occurred for the employment of almost identical HEBL
interventions in another context (Piggot-Irvine & Doyle,
2010). In the latter context, the approach adopted for both
process and evaluation was within a highly collaborative
partnership with leadership in the organization: a pivotal ele-
ment of success highlighted by Saksvik et al. (2007).
