Abstract
We analyse the interaction between private agents' uncertainty about in-
flation target and the central bank's data uncertainty. In our model, private
agents update their perceived inflation target and the central bank estimates
unobservable economic shocks as well as the perceived inflation target. Un-
der those two uncertainties, the learning process of both private agents and
the central bank causes higher order beliefs to become relevant, and this
mechanism is capable of generating high persistence and volatility of infla-
tion even though the underlying shocks are purely transitory. We also find
that the persistence and volatility become smaller as the inflation target be-
comes more credible, that is, the private agents' uncertainty about inflation
target (and hence the bank's data uncertainty) diminishes.

Non-technical summary
Extracting information about economic activity from markets (financial markets in
particular) is an important for a central bank. This is because many of the
economic variables are not directly observable to the banks, but markets can
provide information on such variables. In this paper, it is shown that the ability of
the bank to extract information from markets depends crucially on the credibility of
inflation target.
An intuition behind this can be obtained from the following example. Consider an
economy in which the bank wishes to keep track of the natural interest rate, which
is the equilibrium real interest rate under flexible prices. By keeping track of the
natural rate, the bank can offset the effects of changes in the natural rate on
inflation. Assume that the bank cannot directly observe inflation expectations and
the natural interest rate. Suppose now that the bank observes an increase in
nominal interest rates. There are two possible reasons. One reason is that the
private agents may have revised their expectations about the inflation target.
Another reason is that future natural interest rate may have increased. When
inflation target is perfectly credible, then the first reason would disappear. If the
bank knows that inflation expectation is pinned down by its inflation target, it could
infer the natural interest rate from nominal interest rates. However, when the
inflation target is not fully credible, the bank cannot tell if the observed increase in
the nominal rate is due to a revise in the perceived inflation target or due to a
change in the natural rate. This can de-stabilise inflation.
With this intuition, we show that under imperfect credibility the learning process
of both private agents and the central bank causes higher order beliefs to become
relevant, thus increasing the persistence and volatility of inflation. This mechanism
is capable of generating high persistence and volatility even though the underlying
shocks are purely transitory.
Nicht-technische Zusammenfassung
Eine wichtige Aufgabe von Zentralbanken ist es, Informationen über die
wirtschaftliche Entwicklung insbesondere aus dem Verhalten der Finanzmärkte zu
gewinnen. Denn oft sind diese Variablen nicht direkt beobachtbar. In diesem
Papier wird gezeigt, dass die Fähigkeit der Notenbank, solche Informationen zu
gewinnen, ganz wesentlich von der Glaubwürdigkeit des Inflationszieles abhängt.
Das folgende Beispiel soll dies intuitiv deutlich machen. Angenommen, die
Notenbank will den natürlichen Zins, das heißt den Gleichgewichtszins bei flexiblen
Preisen, realisieren. Die Bank soll nicht in der Lage sein, die Inflationserwartungen
und den natürlichen Zins direkt zu beobachten. Wenn nun der Nominalzins
ansteigt, kann das zwei Gründe haben: Zum einen kann der private Sektor seine
Meinung über das Inflationsziel der Notenbank geändert haben. Zum anderen
kann der künftige natürliche Zins gestiegen sein. Wenn das Inflationsziel
vollständig glaubwürdig ist, dann entfällt der erste Grund. In diesem Fall kann die
Notenbank den natürlichen Zins aus dem Nominalzins ablesen. Wenn aber das
Inflationsziel nicht vollständig glaubwürdig ist, dann weiß die Notenbank nicht, ob
der Zinsanstieg auf eine Revision des erwarteten Inflationszieles oder auf eine
Veränderung des natürlichen Zinses zurück zu führen ist.
Entsprechend dieser Idee zeigen wir, dass bei unvollständiger Glaubwürdigkeit
der Lernprozess des privaten Sektors und der Zentralbank (über die Annahmen
des jeweilig anderen) dazu führt, dass die Unsicherheit der Vorstellungen (und
andere Momente höherer Ordnung) relevant werden und zu Persistenz und
Volatilität der Inflation führen. In der Tat kann die Persistenz und Volatilität groß
werden, obwohl die eigentlichen Schocks nur vorübergehender Natur sind.
1 Introduction
The objective of this paper is to analyse how uncertainty about inflation target
affects the degree of uncertainty central bank faces and hence the stochastic
properties of inflation. When the private agents are uncertain about inflation tar-
get, they generate their belief about the target, which we call `perceived inflation
target'. It is in general quite difficult for the bank to observe perceived inflation
target. First of all, there are no direct measures of perceived inflation target that
are available for central banks. As proxies, several survey measures of long-term
inflation expectations are available, for example, the Michigan Survey and the
Survey of Professional Forecasters in the case of the United States. Also, it is
possible to extract information on inflation expectations from financial variables
such as inflation-indexed bonds. However, private agents' inflation expectations
are affected not only by their perceived inflation target but also by their expecta-
tions about future conditions of the economy, such as future demand and supply
shocks. Therefore, the measures of inflation expectations are only noisy mea-
sures of perceived target. Recently, Bekaert et al. (2005) and Kozicki and Tinsley
(2005) report their estimates of perceived inflation target in the United States. For
the US economy in the late-1970s to early 1980s, Kozicki and Tinsley (2005)
report that the perceived inflation target is estimated to be around 8%,1while
Bekaert et al. (2005)'s estimate is around 14%. From policy point of view, the
difference between 8% and 14% is too large -- the policy prescription can be
very different depending on which to believe. Those examples imply that it is not
a trivial task to extract information about perceived inflation target. As a result,
the private-sector uncertainty about inflation target creates uncertainty facing the
bank about the perceived inflation target. In this paper, we focus our analysis on
how this uncertainty distorts bank's stabilisation policy, and draw some implica-

tions for inflation dynamics.
It is shown that uncertainty about inflation target contributes to inflation per-
sistence and volatility through two channels. One channel is the private-sector
uncertainty about the inflation target. The private-sector learning about the target
creates inflation persistence, as is shown in Erceg and Levin (2003). The other,
which is our main focus, is the central-bank uncertainty about the perceived in-
flation target. This uncertainty makes it more difficult for the bank to estimate the
state of the economy, leading policy errors. Thus the degree of uncertainty facing
the bank is endogenously determined by the credibility problem. In other words,
imperfect credibility is bad not only because it fails to fix inflation expectations, but
also because it makes the bank's stabilisation policy more difficult.
An intuition behind this can be obtained from the following example. Consider
an economy in which the bank wishes to keep track of the natural interest rate,
which is the equilibrium real interest rate under flexible prices.2 By keeping track
of the natural rate, the bank can offset the effects of changes in the natural rate
on inflation. Suppose now that the bank observes an increase in nominal interest
rates. There are two possible reasons. One reason is that the private agents
may have revised their expectations about the inflation target. Another reason
is that future natural interest rate may have increased. When inflation target is
perfectly credible, then the first reason would disappear. If the bank knows that
inflation expectation is pinned down by its inflation target, it could infer the natural
interest rate from nominal interest rates. However, when the inflation target is not
fully credible, the bank cannot tell if the observed increase in the nominal rate is
due to a revise in the perceived inflation target or due to a change in the natural
rate. This can de-stabilise inflation. With this intuition, we show that under imper-
fect credibility the learning process of both private agents and the central bank
causes higher order beliefs to become relevant, thus increasing the persistence

and volatility of inflation. This mechanism is capable of generating high persis-
tence and volatility even though the underlying shocks are purely transitory.3
Our model can naturally connect the literature on monetary policy under data
uncertainty and that on imperfect credibility. In a series of papers, Orphanides
(2001, 2002, 2003) show that the mismeasurement of economic activity, such as
the output gap and natural unemployment rate, was responsible for the `Great
Inflation' of the 1970s-1980s in the United States. While his work takes the mea-
surement problem as exogenously given, our paper shows that the measurement
problem can arise endogenously from lack of credibility.
Our model also predicts that the measurement problem can decrease as mon-
etary policy gains more credibility. This implies that inflation becomes less volatile
and less persistent. In recent years, a large amount of literature has documented
changing stochastic properties of inflation and output--the so-called `Great Mod-
eration'. For example, Benati (2004) reports that output and inflation in the UK has
become less persistent and volatile since the UK introduction of inflation target in
1992. Our model can explain this empirical fact. One of the controversial issues in
the literature is whether the Great Moderation was caused by good luck (shocks
became smaller) or good policy. The existing literature has mainly supported the
good-luck hypothesis (See, for example, Ahmed et al. (2004), Stock and Watson
(2003)). However, Bernanke (2004) claims that the econometric technique used
in the literature may confuse good policy with good luck. His insight is that the
existing literature does not take into account the impact of systematic component
in monetary policy on inflation expectations. That implies that any fluctuations
caused by de-anchored expectations may get confused with genuine non-policy
shocks. In our model the change in the stochastic properties of inflation is purely
3Woodford (2002) and Amato and Shin (2003) consider the roles of higher order beliefs in mon-
etary models. They consider higher order beliefs among firms under strategic complementarity
and how this setting generates persistent effect of monetary policy. On the contrary, we focus on
the interaction of beliefs between private agents and the central bank.

driven by learning by both central bank and private agents. By using stochastic
simulation based on our model, we confirm Bernanke's conjecture.
The structure of the paper is as follows. The next section layouts the model.
Section 3 derives equilibrium, and Section 4 analyses inflation dynamics in our
model and draws policy implications. Section 6 concludes.
2 Model
We present a very simple model of inflation determination. It consists of two
equations: a Fisher equation that relates the nominal interest rate and the natural
interest rate (equilibrium real interest rate), and a monetary policy rule that sets
the nominal interest rate as the instrument of monetary policy. The model can
be interpreted as a model of inflation determination in an economy under flexible
prices.4
2.1 Structural equations
The first equation in our model is the linearised Fisher equation of the form:
t = rn
t
+ Et|pt+1, (1)
where t is nominal interest rate at time t, rn
t
is the natural interest rate at time t, t
is inflation rate at time t. The expectation operator Et|p represents the expectation
conditional on the private-sector information at time t. The information set is
defined in Section 2.2.
4See, for example, Woodford (2003), Chapter 2.
5
4
Equation (1) can be interpreted as a log-linear approximation to the Euler
equation of the representative household in an endowment economy with flexible
prices. A log-linearised Euler equation in such an economy is given by
t = [(Et|pyt+1 - yt) - (Et|pgt+1 - gt)] + Et|pt+1, (2)
where yt and gt are respectively the log-deviation of exogenous output and de-
mand shock from their steady state values, and  is the inverse of the elasticity
of intertemporal substitution. By denoting
rn
t
 [(Et|pyt+1 - yt) - (Et|pgt+1 - gt)], (3)
we obtain (1). Notice that rn
t
represents the equilibrium real interest rate under
flexible prices, that is, the natural interest rate.5
The second equation in the model is a monetary policy rule. It is assumed
that the central bank chooses the nominal interest rate by following the simple
monetary policy rule:
t = (t - 
t
) + 
t
+ Et|crn
t
,  > 1. (4)
Here 
t
is the central bank's inflation target at time t, and Et|c is the expectation
operator conditional on the bank's information set at time t. The information set of
the bank is specified in Section 2.2. Equation (4) assumes that the bank tries to
keep track of the path of the natural interest rate rn
t
conditional on its information
set. We interpret this term as representing the stabilisation policy of the bank. As
is shown in Section 2.3, the bank can offset the effect of the changes in rn
t
on
inflation by keeping track of rn
t
. Finally, by assuming  > 1, the monetary policy
rule (4) satisfies the so-called Taylor principle.
5See, for example, Woodford (2003) for this concept.
6
5
We assume that the inflation target consists of the long-run component (),
and the transitory shock (t):

t
=  + t, (5)
where t is i.i.d. with mean zero.This assumption is similar to Erceg and Levin
(2003), who also assume that the inflation target varies due to a combination of
transitory and highly persistent shocks.6 Combining (4) and (5), one obtains
t = (t - ) +  + Et|crn
t
+ t, (6)
where
t  (1 - )t.
2.2 Information structure
Now we specify the information structure. On one hand, the private agents are
assumed to know the monetary policy rule (4), including the parameter value for
. They observe inflation rate t, the nominal interest rate t and the natural rate
rn
t
. Later we assume that the central bank cannot observe the natural rate. As is
shown in Aoki (2006), this assumption can be justified as the equilibrium informa-
tion structure of a certain island economy.7The private agents also observe the
bank's estimate of rn
t
at time t that is denoted by Et|crn
t
. The underlying assump-
tion is the situation in which the bank publishes its assessment of the current
economic conditions.8 Following Erceg and Levin (2003), we assume that the pri-
6They assume that the auto-regressive root of the persistent shock is 0.999.
7Aoki (2006) considers an island economy where information is dispersed such that no one
can observe aggregate variables directly. However, the paper shows that the equilibrium of this
economy is equivalent to that of economy where there exits the representative household who
has perfect information regarding the aggregate states while the central bank does not.
8By equation (3), this assumption is equivalent to the assumption that the bank announces
its forecasts of the growth rates of demand shocks (such as the government expenditure) and
7
6
vate agents cannot directly observe the underlying components of 
t
, while they
can infer 
t
from knowledge of the bank's reaction function. This may be either
because the bank does not explicitly announce its long-run target , or because
the target is not fully credible. In this case, for example, when they observe a
high nominal interest rate, they cannot tell whether this is because  is low or
t is high. In each period, they update their belief about . Let Et|p be the
perceived inflation target at time t conditional on the private-sector information at
time t.
On the other hand, the bank knows the form of the IS equation (2), including
the value of . It observes inflation, the nominal interest rate and the inflation tar-
get. However it cannot observe the natural rate rn
t
and the private-sector inflation
expectations Et|pt+1. In our model, the latter assumption is equivalent to the as-
sumption that the bank cannot observe the perceived inflation target Et|p. This
implies that, when the nominal interest rate is high, the bank cannot tell whether
this is because the natural rate is high or inflation expectation is high. In each
period, the bank estimates the natural rate and the perceived target. Let Et|crn
t
and Et|cEt|p respectively denote the bank's estimate of the natural rate and
the perceived target conditional on the bank's information set at time t.
In equilibrium, the endogenous variables {t, t}
t=0
satisfies equations (1)
and (6), taking the exogenous variables ({rn
t
, t}
t=0
) as given. Expectations
of each of the bank and the private agents are rational conditional on each of
the information set. Our main objective is to analyse the interaction between the
uncertainty facing the private sector and the uncertainty facing the central bank,
and to draw its implications for inflation dynamics. In order to be able to obtain
clear results, let us focus on the simplest case. From now on, we assume the
natural interest rate and monetary policy shock are i.i.d. normal and independent
output. Publishing those forecasts are not uncommon in practice. For example, the Bank of
England publishes its forecast of GDP in the Inflation Report.

rn

 N(0, 2

t  N(0, 2

). (8)
It is assumed that the distributions are known and common knowledge.
2.3 Equilibrium when inflation target is observable
As the benchmark case, it is useful to discuss the rational expectations equilib-
rium when  is known and common knowledge. In this case, the agents can
also infer t from the monetary policy rule (6), implying that the agents have per-
fect information. It is then shown that information is fully revealed to the bank
as well as to the private agents in equilibrium. In order to show this, suppose
information is fully revealed in equilibrium. This implies that both the bank and
the private agents can infer time-t variables. It also implies that for any future
variables t+, Et|ct+ = Et|pt+  Ett+, where Et denotes the expectations
operator under full information. In particular, the bank can infer rn
t
in equilibrium
so that Et|crn
t
= rn
t
. Then, from (1) and (6), it is straightforward to show that the
equilibrium inflation is given by
t =  - -1t. (9)
Since monetary policy satisfies the Taylor principle, the equilibrium is uniquely
determined. Because we assume t is white noise (8), equation (9) implies that
Ett+1 = . The bank thus infer that inflation expectations are pinned down
9We can extend our analysis to the case in which the natural rate follows an AR(1) process,
which does not change our main results. The results in the the case of AR(1) are available upon
request.

8
by  even if it cannot directly observe expectations. Then, from (1) it can infer
rn
t
because Ett+1 is identified. Therefore we have confirmed that information
is fully revealed to the bank even though rn
t
is not directly observable. In other
words, when  is credible, the bank is not subject to uncertainty regarding the
measurement of the natural rate.
Equation (9) implies that inflation fluctuation does not involve any persistence
when t is white noise. The other disturbance, rn
t
, does not affect inflation fluc-
tuations because the bank fully offsets its effects on inflation. In this sense, the
bank's stabilisation policy works perfectly. To summarise, once the bank's infla-
tion target is known to the private sector and becomes common knowledge, all of
the uncertainty in the model disappears. Now let us analyse the equilibrium when
 is not credible.
3 Equilibrium with uncertain inflation target
3.1 Equilibrium given belief
Although beliefs are determined endogenously in equilibrium, it is useful to see
how inflation depends on the beliefs of the central bank and the private agents.
Complete analysis of the equilibrium is in Section 3.3. From (1) and (6), inflation
is given by
t = -1 ( - 1) - t + -1(rn
t
- Et|crn
t
) + -1Et|pt+1. (10)
Equation (10) shows that t depends on the deviation of rn
t
from the bank's esti-
mate Et|crn
t
. If one takes expectation of the both sides of (10) conditional on Et|c,
10
9
one obtains10
t = -1 ( - 1) - t + -1Et|cEt|pt+1. (11)
By solving this equation forward, the bounded solution for t in terms of the bank's
belief is given by11
t =  - -1t + -1(Et|cEt|p - ). (12)
Compare (12) with (9). Equation (12) can be reduced to (9) when  is com-
mon knowledge. In contrast, under our information structure, t depends on the
second-order belief, namely, the bank's belief about Et|p. Intuitively, the bank's
information problem is the inability to distinguish rn
t
and Et|pt+1, and the latter
depends on Et|p. An imprecise estimate of Et|p results in an imprecise
estimate of rn
t
. This represents the negative feedback effect from the private-
sector uncertainty about inflation target to the bank's estimate of the state of the
economy (rn
t
).
Alternatively, one can take expectations of the both sides of (10) conditional
on Et|p and solve forward to obtain
t =  - -1t + -1(Et|p - ) + Et|p

j=0
-(j+1) rn
t+j
- Et+j|crn
t+j
(13)
This expression implies that inflation depends on the perceived inflation target
and the private-sector expectations about the bank's current and future estimation
errors of the natural rates.
10Here we use the fact that Et|ct = t.
11Here we use the fact that mj[Et|cEt|pEt+1|cEt+1|p...Et+j|cEt+j|p]-j-1t+j = 0 when
t is bounded
11
10
The interaction between the uncertainty facing private agents and that facing
the bank also has implications for inflation expectations. Equation (12) implies
that
t+1 = (1 - -1) - -1t+1 + -1Et+1|c
t+1|p
.
Therefore, inflation expectation Et|pt+1 is given by
Et|pt+1 = Et|p + -1Et|p Et+1|cEt+1|p - Et+1|p . (14)
Equation (14) shows that Et|pt+1 = Et|p. Inflation expectation depends on
the third-order belief, that is, how the private agents expect that the central bank
will mis-estimate the perceived inflation target in the future. Inflation at time t
depends on the private-sector expectations about future monetary policy, and
therefore it depends on the private-sector expectation about how the bank will
mis-estimate the natural rate in the future, as is shown in equation (13). The
bank's estimate of the natural rates is related with its estimate of the perceived
inflation target. Note that Et|pEt+1|crn
t+1
= 0 even if Et|prn
t+1
= 0. When the
private agents expect that the bank's estimate about the perceived inflation tar-
get is different from their own perceived target, they will expect that the bank will
incorrectly estimate the natural rates. In other words, uncertainty about Et|p
distorts the bank's estimation of rn
t
, and the private agents understand this infor-
mation problem the bank faces.
Now we turn to the filtering by private agents and the central bank.
3.2 Evolution of the private-sector belief
In each period, the private agents update their perceived long-run inflation target
. From monetary policy rule (6), the observation equation for the private agents
12
11
is given by
t - t - Et|crn
t
= (1 - ) + t. (15)
The left hand side of equation (15) is observable, and the right hand side is not. In
equation (15), we use the assumption that the bank's estimate of rn
t
is observable.
Denote by zt the linear combination of the observable variables of the private
sector:
zt  t - t - Et|crn
t
.
Under assumption (8), the distribution of zt is given by
zt  N (1 - ), 2

. (16)
The filtering problem of the private agents is to distinguish the transitory compo-
nent t from the constant term (1 - ). This is a classic inference problem
from a normal distribution with unknown mean and known variance. From now
on, it is useful to work with `precision,'   1/2

, rather than variance 2

. Let
the initial prior (at time 0) on (1 - ) be
(1 - )  N (1 - )
0|p
, 1/0|p , (17)
where 
0|p
is the initial prior about , and 0|p is the initial precision. Then the

Equation (20) gives the evolution of the perceived inflation target.
3.3 Evolution of the bank's belief
Next, we compute the optimal filtering problem by the central bank. The bank's
observation equation is given by the Fisher equation (1). The bank's observable
variable is the nominal interest rate t, and the unobservable variables are rn
t
and
Et|pt+1 that is given by (14). Notice that Et|pt+1 is determined endogenously
in equilibrium. Here it is necessary to solve the filtering problem and equilibrium
14
13
simultaneously, since equilibrium depends on the bank's policy, and the bank's
policy depends on its estimate of the natural interest rate.12 This estimate in turn
depends on the statistical properties of the bank's observables and the natural
rate in equilibrium. In Appendix A, it is shown that the evolution of the bank's
estimation error of the natural rate is given by
rn

- Et|crn
t

Bt

rn
t-1
- Et-1|crn

+ (1 - dt)rn
t
, (21)
where Bt and dt are time-varying deterministic parameters that are given in Ap-
pendix A. Equivalently, it is shown in Appendix A the evolution of the bank's esti-
mation error of the perceived inflation target can be written as
Et|cEt|p -Et|p = dtbt Et-1|cEt-1|p - Et-1|p +(1-dt)
t
Bt
rn
t
. (22)
There is a close relationship between those estimates. Indeed, Appendix A shows
that the relationship is given by
Et|cEt|p - Et|p =
t
Bt
rn
t
- Et|crn
t
. (23)
Equation (23) implies that imprecise estimate of the perceived inflation target re-
sults in imprecise estimate of the natural rate. This is due to the bank's inability to
distinguish inflation expectations and the natural rate when it observes the nomi-
nal interest rate.

4 Inflation dynamics under uncertain inflation tar-
get
4.1 Variance and autocorrelation of inflation
Now we are able to complete our analysis of inflation dynamics. Using (12) and
(23), Equilibrium inflation can be written as
t =  - -1t + ~
t, where (24)
~
t  -1 (Et|p - ) + (Et|cEt|p - Et|p)
= -1(Et|p - ) + -1
t
Bt
rn
t
- Et|crn
t
where Et|p -  and rn
t
- Et|crn
t
respectively evolve according to (20) and
(21). The first two terms ( - -1t) of equation (24) are identical to (9), that
is, the equilibrium inflation when the inflation target is credible.The term ~
t rep-
resents inflation fluctuations that are caused by the credibility problem. The term
-1(Et|p - ) represents fluctuations that are caused by private-sector un-
certainty about the inflation target. When the perceived inflation target deviates
from the true target, fluctuations in inflation expectations add more fluctuations to
the equilibrium inflation. The term -1t/Bt rn
t
- Et|crn
t
represents the fluctu-
ations caused by central-bank uncertainty about the perceived target. This term
arises from the bank's inability to distinguish the natural rate and inflation expec-
tations when inflation target is not credible.
Equation (20) implies that Et|p -   0 as t  , therefore that the
private-sector uncertainty diminishes over time and the private agents will even-
tually learn about . This in turn implies that the uncertainty facing central bank
also diminishes over time. Therefore, the contribution of ~
t to overall inflation per-
sistence and volatility decrease over time and t   - -1t as t  . We
can compute the variance and autocorrelation of inflation. In Appendix B, those

which correspond to the variance and autocorrelation of the inflation process
when inflation target is observable (equation (9)).
4.2 A reduced-form estimation of model-simulated data
In order to investigate the properties of inflation in our model further, we conduct
a simple stochastic simulation of our model. We generated 1000 sets of artificial
normally-distributed shocks of 40 periods in each set, and obtained the stochastic
process of the inflation under the learning process of the private-sector and the
central bank.
Then, we consider the reduced-form dynamics of inflation by estimating an AR
13See Appendix B.
17
16
model, in line with Ahmed et al. (2004); Stock and Watson (2002).
t = c + (L)t-1 + t, Vr[t] = 2

. (27)
By model selection criterion (AIC), we set the AR lag order to one. The es-
timated AR parameter  , the standard deviation of the innovation 2

, and the
variance of inflation Vr[t] are calculated for each data set, and the summary
statistics are averaged over 1000 sets. In order to examine how these statistics
change under the learning process of the private-sector and the central bank, an
AR model is estimated over the first 20 periods and the second 20 periods sepa-
rately. Note that our data frequency should be interpreted as annual rather than
quarterly, since our model is a flexible price model.
In the simulation, several parameters must be specified. We choose the cen-
tral bank's inflation target, , of 2%, and the private-sector prior in (17), 
0|p
,
of 10%. According to the analysis of Kozicki and Tinsley (2001, 2005), these
values are roughly in line with the US economy at the beginning of 1980s. With
regard to the uncertainty that the central bank initially faces, E0|c
0|p
- 
0|p
, we
assume that it ranges from zero to five.14 The standard deviation of monetary
policy shock, , is set to 1%, and hence  = 1. According to Roberts (2004),
this is in line with the FED policy between 1960 and 1983. The standard devi-
ation of natural rate of interest, r, is set to 1.5%, and hence r = 0.44. This
value is based on the result of Laubach and Williams (2003), who estimate r as
between 1.1 and 2.6 using US data. The policy coefficient, , is set to 1.5, like
Taylor rule. Finally, we set the precision of initial prior, both 0|p and 0|c , to one.
In Appendix C we examine some robustness against changing those parameters.
Finally, notice that we have assumed the structural shocks rn
t
and t are white
14This range is in line with differences between the estimate of Bekaert et al. (2005) and Kozicki
and Tinsley (2005).

Figure 1: Time-varying persistency and volatility
noise processes. Therefore, the persistence reported below are purely driven by
learning by central bank and private agents. In reality, the natural rate can be a
persistent process. This implies that the persistence reported below should be
interpreted as the lower bound that our theoretical model can generate.
Figure 1 shows the simulation results. The following two features are of par-
ticular importance. First, as the difference in the initial beliefs between the private
sector and the central bank, i.e. E0|c
0|p
-
0|p
, become large, both the estimated
AR parameter  and the standard deviation of the innovation  become large in
the first-half period. A larger gap in initial beliefs between the private sector and
the central bank make the central bank's estimation of the economy more diffi-
cult, which results in higher persistence and higher volatility of inflation process.
Second, for any value of E0|cE0|p - E0|p,  and  become smaller in the
second half period than the first half period. This is because the private agents
and central bank eventually learn about the inflation target and the perceived in-
flation target respectively. Accordingly, both inflation persistence and the volatility
of inflation decline in the second half period. Now we draw some implications of
19
18
this simulation result.
4.3 Nominal anchor and measurement of economic activity
Figure 1 shows that inflation is persistent and volatile in the early phase of learn-
ing. (20) shows that t has persistent effects on ~
t through the private-sector
filtering. This implies that the private-sector uncertainty about  results in per-
sistent inflation through learning. This agrees with Erceg and Levin (2003), who
consider a similar economy in which the private-sector learning about inflation
target can make inflation process persistent.15 In our model, there is another
channel through which imperfect credibility contributes to inflation persistence
and volatility, namely, the bank's uncertainty about perceived inflation target. The
fact that the bank cannot directly observe perceived inflation target implies that
it cannot identify inflation expectations and the natural interest rates. This fact
de-stabilises inflation because it prevents the bank from fully offsetting the effects
of the fluctuations in rn
t
on t.16
Our model shows that the lack of strong nominal anchor and the measure-
ment problem of economic activity are closely related with each other. In a series
of papers, Orphanides (2001, 2002, 2003) show that the mismeasurement of
economic activity, such as the output gap and natural unemployment rate, was
responsible for the `Great Inflation' of the 1970s-1980s in the United States. He
shows that in the 70s the real-time estimate of the natural unemployment rate
was too low and the estimate of the potential output was too high. This lead to
excess monetary expansion, resulting in high inflation. While his work takes the
measurement problem as exogenously given, our paper shows that the imper-
fect credibility can endogenously amplify the measurement problem. Our model
15Erceg and Levin (2003) assume that the central bank has perfect information, which in our
model corresponds to the case of E0|c

= 0.

implies that the measurement problem becomes serious when monetary policy
looses credibility. On the contrary, gaining credibility can make the measurement
problem less serious. This has important policy implications. If we take the mea-
surement problem as exogenously given, a policy prescription would be not to
respond actively to those economic variables subject to measurement errors. For
example, Orphanides and Williams (2005) argue that it is desirable for monetary
policy not to respond actively to the unemployment gap because the gap can be
subject to large measurement errors. On the other hand, our model implies that
gaining credibility helps the bank to reduce the measurement problem.
4.4 Learning and time-varying stochastic process of inflation
Figure 1 shows that the persistence and volatility of inflation decline as both of
the agents and central bank learn. It is interesting to compare this observation
with some empirical studies. Recently, several articles have documented that
macroeconomic volatility in several OECD countries have declined over the past
twenty years -- the so called `Great Moderation.' 17
For example, Benati (2007) found that under inflation targeting inflation per-
sistence declined significantly and exhibits almost no persistence in UK, Canada,
Sweden and New Zealand, while it was highly persistent between the breakdown
of Bretton Woods and the introduction of inflation targeting. In Benati (2004), he
found that the volatility of GDP and inflation in the UK has decreased since the in-
troduction of inflation targeting in 1992. Our model can offer an explanation of his
findings. As inflation targeting becomes credible, the private-sector uncertainty
about the long-run inflation rate has decreased over time. At the same time, this
has a favourable feedback to the stabilisation policy of the Bank of England. A
decrease in the private-sector uncertainty has reduced the uncertainty facing the
17See, for example, Ahmed et al. (2004); Stock and Watson (2003);Cogley and Sargent (2004)
21
20
bank. As a result, the bank's stabilisation policy has improved, making inflation
process less volatile and less persistent.
Our simulation, even though it is stylised, has some interesting implication for
the econometric analysis of the Great Moderation. In the literature, two com-
peting explanations for the Great Moderation are considered very likely. One is
"good policy", i.e. improvements in monetary policy. Another is "good luck", i.e.
a fortuitous reduction in exogenous shocks. Several prominent studies have pro-
vided support for the good-luck hypothesis. Roughly speaking, those econometric
studies interpret the changes in estimated parameters of the model as changes
in policy or economic structure, and the changes in the variances of innovations
(residuals) as representing the changes in underlying economic shocks. In our
simulation, both  and  in equation (27) change, implying that this looks as if
both good policy and good luck occur. However, in our simulation, what changed
between the first subperiod and the second subperiod is the perceived inflation
target and the bank's estimate of the perceived target. We kept the monetary pol-
icy rule (6) and variance of shocks (, r) constant. This agrees with Bernanke
(2004)'s view on the literature on the Great Moderation. He argues that the exist-
ing studies may incorrectly identify the effect of good policy as good luck. Econo-
metricians typically do not measure exogenous shocks directly but instead infer
them form movements in macroeconomic variables that they cannot otherwise
explain. When the central bank's inflation target is incredible, the change in de-
anchored inflation expectation may result in what appear to be change in exoge-
nous shocks. Shocks in this sense may certainly depend on monetary policy
regime. Accordingly, as the inflation expectation becomes to be anchored grad-
ually, the standard deviation of innovation in the reduced form regression may
become smaller even when the magnitude of exogenous shock (structural shock)
is constant. This makes an econometric analysis based on reduced-form regres-
sion incorrectly lead to good-luck bias. This is exactly what happened in our
22
21
simulation study. Imperfect credibility creates fluctuations in inflation expectations
through the private-sector learning. This diminishes over time as agents learn.
In addition to this, imperfect credibility creates additional uncertainty facing the
bank, which makes policy erratic. This also contributes to innovation variances
that diminish over time.
5 Conclusion
In this paper, we analysed how private agents' uncertainty about inflation target
and the central bank's uncertainty are related with each other. The model is ca-
pable of generating high persistence and volatility even when there is no intrinsic
persistence and structural shocks are white noise. We also show that the degree
of the bank's data uncertainty is endogenously determined by the degree of pri-
vate agents' uncertainty about inflation target -- the measurement problem can
arise endogenously from lack of credibility. Although much of the previous litera-
ture has already suggested the great importance of considering data uncertainty
in the conduct of monetary policy, it has taken the data uncertainty as exoge-
nously given. Our model implies that decreasing the private agents' uncertainty
about inflation target can make the measurement problem less serious for the
central bank.
Our model can have some implications for yield curve. As Gurkaynak et al.
(2005) shows, long-term nominal interest rates tend to be sensitive to changes in
current monetary policy actions when there is uncertainty about nominal anchor.
This is because current monetary policy actions bring some news about long-run
inflation target. Our model predicts similar results. While their model predicts
`shifts' in the yield curve in response to monetary policy, our model would predict
both `shifts' and `the change in slopes'. We plan to investigate this question in
23
22
future research.
Finally, it would be interesting to examine some other monetary policy regimes
with stronger nominal anchor. In the present paper, it is assumed that the bank
changes the nominal interest rate in response to deviations of inflation from its
target value. It would be interesting to analyse price level targeting in the context
of interest-rate rules, or monetary-aggregate control instead of interest-rate con-
trol. As is well known, price level targeting and monetary aggregate control have
stronger nominal anchor than inflation targeting. It would be important to anal-
yse how those different policy regimes perform under imperfect credibility about
nominal anchor.

Appendix
A Bank's filtering problem
A.1 Constructing an observation equation of the bank
From (1) and (14), the bank's observation equation is given by
t = rn
t
+ (1 - -1)Et|p + -1Et|pEt+1|c
t+|p
. (A.1)
In order to solve the bank's filtering problem, it is convenient to rewrite (A.1) in
terms of 
0|p
. By taking the conditional expectation Et|c of equation (19) and
subtracting that conditional expectations from (19), we have
Et|cEt|p - Et|p = t Et|c
0|p
- 
0|p
, (A.2)
and therefore
Et|pEt+1|c
t+1|p
- Et|p = t+1 Et|pEt+1|c
0|p
- 
0|p
. (A.3)
Here we use the fact that Et|p
t+1|p
= Et|p. Equation (A.2) shows that what
matters to the difference between the perceived inflation target and the bank's
belief the perceived target is the difference of the initial belief (
0|p
) between the
two of them. As t  , the difference will disappear. This is because (19)
implies that the private agents eventually learn about the inflation target, and the
bank knows this fact.
Substituting (A.3) into (A.1), one obtains
t = rn
t
+ Et|p + -1t+1 Et|pEt+1|c
0|p
- 
0|p
.
25
24
Substituting (19) into the above equation, and collecting the variables that are
observable to the bank to the left hand side and the unobservables to the right
hand side, one obtains
t-(1-t)-
1 - t
1 - 
¯
t = rn
t
+ t - -1t+1 
0|p
+-1t+1Et|pEt+1|c
0|p
.
(A.4)
Equation (A.4) involves the private-sector expectations about the bank's future
belief about 
0|p
. This is an implication of the forward-looking nature of inflation.
The term Et|pEt+1|c
0|p
comes from the last term in equation (A.1), which in turn
comes from private-sector inflation expectations about future monetary policy.
The private sector expectations about future monetary policy depends on their
expectations about the bank's filtering in the subsequent periods.
Now the remaining task is to compute the equilibrium and the bank's filtering.
The right hand side of equation (A.4) still contains endogenous variables, namely,
Et|pEt+1|c
0|p
. This should be determined jointly with the bank's filtering. In the
next section, we will compute the equilibrium and the filtering by the method of
undetermined coefficients. We first guess the equilibrium form and solve the
filtering given that guess, and then compute the equilibrium given the filtering.
A.2 Deriving the equilibrium and the bank's filtering
Define Xt as the bank's observable variables (the right hand side of equation
(A.4)):
Xt  t - (1 - t) -
1 - t
1 - 
¯
t.
First of all, notice that, in this economy, the state of the economy can be repre-
sented by Xt, rn
t
, 
0|p
, and Et-1|c
0|p
. Therefore, we guess that the equilibrium
26
25
takes the following form:
AtXt = rn
t
+ Bt
0|p
+ CtEt-1|c
0|p
, (A.5)
where At, Bt, Ct are time-varying coefficients to be determined. Since Et-1|c
0|p
is observable to the bank at time t, we can define the new observation equation
of the bank as
AtXt - CtEt-1|c
0|p
= rn
t
+ Bt
0|p
. (A.6)
Again, the left hand side is observable to the bank, and the right hand side is
unobservable. Equation (A.6) shows that the bank's filtering problem reduces
to the sequential updating of a constant, 
0|p
. A slight complication is that it
involves a time-varying coefficient Bt. Define the new observable variable as Yt 
AtXt - CtEt-1|c
0|p
. From the normality assumption (7), Yt is again normally
distributed:
Yt  N Bt
0|p
, 2
r
.
Let the prior distribution be:
Bt-1
0|p
 N Bt-1Et-1|c
0|p
, -1
t-1|c
,
where t-1|c is the bank's precision at the end of time t - 1 (i.e., before the bank
observes time-t variables). Then the prior for Bt
0|p
is given by (see DeGroot
(1970))
Bt
0|p
 N BtEt-1|c
0|p
,
B2

Then, the posterior mean of Bt

is given by
BtEt|c

+ (1 - dt)Yt, (A.8)

. The updating equation of t|c can be written as
t|c =

t-1|c + r. (A.10)
Using the definition of Yt, one can rewrite (A.8) as

Ct

This implies that, at time t + 1,

= dt+1 - 1 - dt+1
Ct+1
Bt+1
Et|c
0|p
+ (1 - dt+1)

Taking expectations conditional on the private-sector information at time t, and
arranging terms, one obtains
Et|pEt+1|c
0|p
= (1 - dt+1)
0|p
+ dt+1Et|c
0|p
. (A.12)
Here we use the assumption that the bank announces Et|c
0|p
at time t. Sub-
stituting (A.12) into (A.11), and then substitute the resulting equation into (A.4).
Then we can verify that the equilibrium is indeed given by:
1 - -1t+1(1 - dt)
At
Bt
Xt

0|p
+ -1t+1dt+1 dt -

Bt
Ct Et-1|c

.
(A.13)
28
27
By comparing our guess (A.5) and (A.13), we have the following three identities:
At = 1 - -1t+1(1 - dt)
At
Bt
(A.14)
Bt = t - -1t+1dt+1 (A.15)
Ct = -1t+1dt+1 dt -
1 - dt
Bt
Ct (A.16)
By substituting (A.9), we notice that equations (A.15) and (A.10) represent a sys-
tem of deterministic (non-linear) difference equation with respect to Bt and t|c
Bt = t - -1t+1
B2

B2
t+1
t|c + r
, (A.17)
t|c =
B2
t-1
B2
t
t-1|c + r. (A.10)
Once Bt and t|c are solved, dt is solved by (A.9), equations (A.14) and (A.16)
respectively solve At and Ct.
Notice that equation (A.15) and (A.10) show that Bt depends both on Bt-1
and Bt+1. Dependence on Bt-1 is just a direct implication of recursive filtering.
Dependence on Bt+1 is an implication of the interaction between forward-looking
nature of inflation and the bank's filtering. In our model, the current equilibrium
variables depend on the private-sector expectations about future monetary policy.
And future monetary policy depends on how the central bank will estimate the
future state of the economy. This is represented in equation (A.12). Therefore,
the way the bank will estimate the state of the economy in the next period will
affect the current equilibrium. As a result, the bank's filtering in the current period
is affected by its filtering in future periods.
The existing literature such as Aoki (2003) and Svensson and Woodford (2003)
29
28
focus on `stationary' filtering by central bank, so that the Kalman gain is constant
over time. In our model, since the bank's learning is about a constant 
0|p
, filter-
ing is not stationary. That is the main reason why the bank's Kalman gain, namely,
dt is not constant over time. In general, even if the bank is estimating time-varying
variables, Kalman gains are not necessarily constant. Therefore, the dependence
of equilibrium on the future Kalman gain of the central bank is a general property
of rational equilibrium models with forward-looking private sector.
Let us finish this section by characterising the stochastic properties of the
central-bank uncertainty. By using (A.11), (A.5), and (A.15), the evolution of
Et|c
0|p
is given by
Et|c
0|p
= dtEt-1|c
0|p
+ (1 - dt)
0|p
+
1 - dt
t - -1t+1dt+1
rn
t
. (A.18)
Substitution of (A.18) into (A.2) yields
Et|cEt|p - Et|p = tdt Et-1|c
0|p
- 
0|p
+
t(1 - dt)
t - -1t+1dt+1
rn
t
.
(A.19)
Equation (A.19) clearly shows the dependence on the bank's current estimate
of the economy on its future filtering (dt+1). It also shows that Et|cEt|p -
Et|p  0 as t  .
Finally, as discussed in 3.3, there is a close relationship between the bank's
estimates of the perceived inflation target and the estimates of the natural rate.
Taking the conditional expectation Et|c of equation (A.6) and subtracting that con-
ditional expectations from (A.6), we have
rn
t
- Et|crn
t
= Bt Et|c
0|p
- 
0|p
. (A.20)
Using (A.20) and (A.2), we can see that Et|cEt|p - Et|p represents the
30
29
bank's estimation error about rn
t
Et|cEt|p - Et|p =
t
Bt
rn
t
- Et|crn
t
, (A.21)
which is equation (23). Therefore, the central-bank uncertainty about the real rate
and about the private-sector belief are related with each other.
B Variance and autocorrelation of inflation
We can rewrite equation (24) as
t =  + -1 (Et|p -  - t) + (Et|cEt|p - Et|p)
  + -1 [t + t] , (B.1)
where
t  Et|p -  - t
and
t  Et|cEt|p - Et|p.
By using (20), t can be written as
t = btt-1 + btt-1 -
bt - 
1 - 
t. (B.2)
By using (22), t can be written as
t = gtt-1 + htrn
t
, (B.3)
where gt  btdt and ht = (1 - dt)t/Bt. Note that 0 < gt < 1, mtgt = 1,
and ht > 0, limt ht = 0.
31
30
Since t and rn
t
are independent so are t and t. Therefore we have
V[t] = -2(V[t] + V[t]) (B.4)
and
Co[t, t-1] = -2 [Co[t, t-1] + Co[t, t-1]] . (B.5)
Equation (B.2) implies that
V[t] =
2

(1 - )2

(bt - )2 +

k=0

(bt-1 - 1)(bt-1 - ) +
t-2
k=0


t-2

 .
(B.7)
Since 0 < bt < 1 and limt bt = 0 we obtain limt V[t] = 2

and
limt Co[t, t-1] = 0.
Equation (B.3) implies that
V[t] = 2

Since 0 < gt < 1, limt gt = 1, 0 < ht, limt ht = 0, we obtain limt V[t] =

C Robustness analysis of Section
In this Appendix, we confirm that the above basic results shown in Section 4
are robust against different parameters. Table 1 shows the parameter for four
robustness analysis.
Benchmark Case 1 Case 2 Case 3 Case 4
 2 2 2 2 2
E0|p 10 20 10 10 10
 1 1 1 4 1
r 0.44 0.44 0.44 0.44 0.44
 1.5 1.5 1.1 1.5 1.5
0|p 1 1 1 1 10
0|c 1 1 1 1 1
Table 1: Parameter values for sensitivity analysis
Case 1: higher perceived target Initial perceived inflation target is set
to 20 %. This may correspond to the case of the introduction
of inflation targeting in some emerging countries. When Chile,
Israel and Hungary adpted inflation targeting, the inflation rates
were about 20 %.
Case 2: less aggressive monetary policy  is set to 1.1, which is
lower than the original Taylor rule
Case 3: smaller monetary policy shock  is set to 0.5 % and
hence =0.4. According to Roberts (2004), this is almost in
line with the Fed policy after 1984.
Case 4: More stubborn belief The initial value of the private-sector
precision parameter, 0|p, is 10, which means that the private
sector is more convinced by their own belief.
Figure 2-5 shows that higher volatility of inflation in the first-half period results
from higher perceived target (Case1), less aggressive monetary policy (Case2),
larger monetary policy shock (Case3) and more stubborn belief (Case4). In all
these cases, as in the benchmark case, the larger E0|c
0|p
- 
0|p
, the larger the
volatility of inflation in the first-half period. Also, the estimated AR parameter ,
the standard deviation of the innovation  , and hence the volatility of inflation
Vr[t] become smaller in the second half period than the first half period.
