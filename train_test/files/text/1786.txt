Serum 25-Hydroxyvitamin D Levels and the Prevalence of
Peripheral Arterial Disease
Results from NHANES 2001 to 2004

Objective--The purpose of this study was to determine the association between 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) levels
and the prevalence of peripheral arterial disease (PAD) in the general United States population.
Methods and Results--We analyzed data from 4839 participants of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
2001 to 2004 to evaluate the relationship between 25(OH)D and PAD (defined as an ankle-brachial index 0.9). Across
quartiles of 25(OH)D, from lowest to highest, the prevalence of PAD was 8.1%, 5.4%, 4.9%, and 3.7% (P trend
0.001). After multivariable adjustment for demographics, comorbidities, physical activity level, and laboratory
measures, the prevalence ratio of PAD for the lowest, compared to the highest, 25(OH)D quartile (17.8 and 29.2
ng/mL, respectively) was 1.80 (95% confidence interval: 1.19, 2.74). For each 10 ng/mL lower 25(OH)D level, the
multivariable-adjusted prevalence ratio of PAD was 1.35 (95% confidence interval: 1.15, 1.59).
Conclusions--Low serum 25(OH)D levels are associated with a higher prevalence of PAD. Several mechanisms have been
invoked in the literature to support a potential antiatherosclerotic activity of vitamin D. Prospective cohort and
mechanistic studies should be designed to confirm this association. (Arterioscler Thromb Vasc Biol. 2008;28:1179-1185)
Key Words: 25-hydroxyvitamin D  peripheral arterial disease  phosphate  PTH  cardiovascular disease
Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) affects approximately 5
million US adults, and it is associated with a high risk of
morbidity and mortality from cardiovascular disease.1,2 Es-
tablished risk factors for PAD include typical atherosclerosis
risk factors such as dyslipidemia, diabetes mellitus, hyperten-
sion, smoking, and reduced kidney function.2,3 In addition,
nontraditional cardiovascular risk factors such as elevated
C-reactive protein (CRP) and fibrinogen have been associated
with PAD.4
Basic science research indicates that low vitamin D levels
may be linked with cardiovascular risk. Vascular smooth
muscle cells possess the 1- hydroxylase enzyme that locally
activates circulating vitamin D.5 In animal models, active
vitamin D is an inhibitor of the renin-angiotensin system6 and
myocardial cell hypertrophy.7 Cellular experiments show that
active vitamin D and its analogs exhibit anticoagulant activ-
ity.8 Conflicting data are available on the association between
low 25(OH)D levels and cardiovascular disease in the general
population.9­11
Among adults, 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) levels
30 ng/mL are considered optimal.12 These levels are asso-
ciated with reduced fracture rates and have been postulated to
be associated with better health outcomes.12 The goal of the
current study was to evaluate the association between serum
25(OH)D levels and the prevalence of PAD in the general
population. To accomplish this goal, we analyzed data from a
nationally representative sample of the United States adult
population aged 40 years in NHANES 2001 to 2004. In
addition, elevated serum calcium, phosphate, and intact
parathyroid hormone (iPTH) levels have been associated with
cardiovascular disease in the general population.13,14 Because
these serum markers are associated with vitamin D levels, we
assessed the association between these serum markers and
PAD in a secondary analysis.
Methods
Study Population
NHANES 2001 to 2004 was a nationally representative cross-
sectional survey of the civilian noninstitutionalized United States
population performed by the National Center for Health Statistics.
All participants underwent standardized interviews, physical exam-
inations, and laboratory testing. Ankle-brachial index (ABI) was
measured in NHANES 2001 to 2004 participants 40 years of age.
Serum 25(OH)D levels were measured for 4839 participants, 40
years of age, who had complete data on all other study variables.

Study Variables
Study procedures in NHANES 2001 to 2004 consisted of an in-home
interview followed by a medical evaluation and blood sample
collection at a mobile examination center. Of relevance to the current
analysis, variables collected during the in-home interview included
age, gender, race-ethnicity, cigarette smoking, education, leisure-
time physical activity, and a history of diabetes mellitus and
myocardial infarction. For the current analysis, self-reported race-
ethnicity was categorized as non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic
black, Mexican-American, and other. Participants who reported
having smoked 100 cigarettes during their lifetime were classified
as current or former smokers if they answered affirmatively or
negatively, respectively, to the question "Do you smoke cigarettes
now?" Diabetes mellitus was defined as a self-report of a physician
diagnosis, not during pregnancy, with concurrent use of oral hypo-
glycemic or insulin medication. A history of myocardial infarction
was based on participants' self-report of a previous physician
diagnosis on the medical history questionnaire. Being physically
active was defined as participating in 30 or more minutes of
moderate or vigorous activity or strength training in the 30 days
preceding the NHANES visit.
The NHANES 2001 to 2004 examination procedures included
measurement of height, weight, and blood pressure. Body mass
index (BMI) was calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height
in meters squared. Normal weight, overweight, and obesity were
defined as a BMI of 25 kg/m2, 25 to 30 kg/m2, and 30 kg/m2,
respectively. Three blood pressure measurements were taken during
a single examination visit by a physician using a protocol adapted
from the American Heart Association. Based on the average of all 3
blood pressure measurements, hypertension was defined as systolic
or diastolic blood pressure 140 mm Hg or 90 mm Hg, respectively,
or self-reported current use of blood pressure lowering medication.
Medication and supplement use data were obtained for use of statins,
antihypertensives, antidiabetes medications, and vitamin D supple-
mentation through questionnaires and pill bottle reviews.
Detailed descriptions of blood collection and processing proce-
dures are provided in the NHANES Laboratory/Medical Technolo-
gists Procedures Manual.15 Serum creatinine concentration was
measured using the modified kinetic method of Jaffe, calibrated to
the assays used for the development of the Modification of Diet in
Renal Disease (MDRD) Study equation, and glomerular filtration
rate was estimated with the simplified MDRD equation.16 Partici-
pants with an estimated glomerular filtration rate of 60 mL/min/
1.73 m2 were considered to have chronic kidney disease (CKD).
High-sensitivity CRP was measured by latex-enhanced nephelome-
try. Elevated CRP was defined as 1.0 mg/L. Total plasma homo-
cysteine levels were measured by the Abbott Homocysteine assay.
Total and HDL-cholesterol, serum calcium, and phosphate levels
were measured on the Beckman Synchron LX20. Serum calcium was
corrected for serum albumin using the formula: adjusted
calciummeasured calcium[(4.0serum albumin in g/dL)0.8].
Serum calcium and phosphate were measured from 1999 to 2004 and
were available for analysis in 6984 participants. Serum intact
parathyroid hormone (iPTH) was measured on an Elecsys 1010
autoanalyzer (Roche Diagnostics) using a electrochemiluminescent
process. Serum iPTH was measured only in 2003 to 2004 (n2391).
Serum vitamin D was measured using the Diasorin (formerly Incstar)
25(OH)D assay. Three levels of control specimens were used to
assess the quality of each 25(OH)D run. Coefficients of variation for
serum 25(OH)D remained less than 10% throughout the study
period.
Outcome
The primary outcome for the current study was PAD defined using
ABI. Details of the methods used to measure ABI in NHANES have
been described previously.17 In brief, for participants with at least 1
arm and weighing 400 pounds, systolic blood pressure for the ABI
was measured via blood pressure cuffs on the right brachial artery
and both posterior tibial arteries. For participants aged 40 to 59 years,
2 measures were taken and averaged at each site, whereas for
participants aged 60 years, 1 measure was taken. For individuals
with conditions precluding measurement of the right arm, left
brachial artery systolic blood pressure was taken. ABI was calculated
as the ratio of the average ankle systolic blood pressure to arm
systolic blood pressure. The smaller of the 2 measurements was
considered the ABI for this study. Participants with ABI 1.5 may
have severe arterial rigidity and were therefore excluded from all
analyses (n10). PAD was defined as ABI 0.9.
Statistical Analysis
Participant characteristics were calculated by PAD status. The
statistical significance of differences for these characteristics was
determined using least squares and maximum likelihood for contin-
uous and dichotomous variables, respectively. Next, the prevalence
of PAD was calculated by quartile of 25(OH)D, with the statistical
significance of trends across quartile assessed using maximum
likelihood. Prevalence ratios of PAD associated with quartile of
serum 25(OH)D were calculated using log binomial regression
models. An initial model included adjustment for age, gender, and
race-ethnicity with a subsequent model including additional adjust-
ment for education, current and former cigarette smoking, leisure-
time physical activity, diabetes mellitus, total to HDL cholesterol
ratio, body mass index, systolic blood pressure, log homocysteine,
glycohemoglobin, statin use, antihypertensive medication use, vita-
min D supplement use, history of myocardial infarction, elevated
CRP, and chronic kidney disease. To further explore the dose­
response relationship of 25(OH)D with PAD, we used restricted
quadratic splines with knots at the 10th, 50th, and 90th percentiles of
the 25(OH)D distribution (12.4, 23.4, 34.3 ng/mL, respectively). The
multivariable-adjusted association between 25(OH)D, as continuous
variable, and PAD was determined overall and for subgroups defined
by age, gender, race-ethnicity, BMI, physical activity, diabetes
mellitus, a history of myocardial infarction, chronic kidney disease,
and vitamin D supplement use. For analyses as a continuous variable,
the prevalence ratio of PAD was calculated for 1 standard deviation
lower serum 25(OH)D (10 ng/mL). Differences in the association of
25(OH)D and PAD across subgroup were tested by using a multi-
plicative term in the regression models. Additionally, the associa-
tions between serum calcium, phosphate, and iPTH, each modeled
by quartile and as continuous variables, and PAD were determined.
Data were analyzed using SUDAAN (version 9.0; Research Triangle
Institute) to account for the complex NHANES sampling design
including unequal probabilities of selection, oversampling, and
nonresponse.
Results
Participant Characteristics
Participants with PAD were older, more likely to be non-
Hispanic black, have less than a high school education, be a
former smoker, and have diabetes mellitus, higher glycohe-
moglobin levels, hypertension, a history of myocardial infarc-
tion, chronic kidney disease, use statins, and have elevated
homocysteine and CRP (Table 1). Additionally, those with
PAD were less likely to be physically active. There was no
difference in serum calcium, phosphate, or iPTH levels
between participants with and without PAD. In contrast,
mean 25(OH)D levels were significantly lower among par-
ticipants with PAD (P0.001).
Associations Between Serum 25 (OH) Vitamin D
Levels and PAD
A graded association was present between lower 25(OH)D
levels and a higher prevalence of PAD (Table 2). This
association was present after age, gender, race-ethnicity, and
multivariable adjustment. Compared to their counterparts in
the highest 25(OH)D quartile (29.2 ng/mL), participants in
the lowest 25(OH)D quartile (17.8 ng/mL) were 2.18 (95%

confidence interval [CI]: 1.50, 3.16) and 1.80 (1.19, 2.74)
times more likely to have PAD, after age, gender, race-
ethnicity, and multivariable adjustment, respectively. In a
multivariable adjusted spline regression model, a progressive
increase in PAD was evident at lower levels of 25(OH)D
levels (Figure 1).
Subgroup Analysis
After multivariable adjustment, the prevalence ratio of PAD
associated with each 10 ng/mL lower 25(OH)D was 1.35
(95% CI: 1.15, 1.59; Figure 2). The association between
25(OH)D and PAD was similar (probability value for inter-
action 0.10) in all subgroups except physical activity.
Specifically, the prevalence ratio of PAD per each 10 ng/mL
lower 25(OH)D was 1.61 (95% CI: 1.19, 2.18) and 1.13 (95%
CI: 0.95, 1.35) for those who were and were not physically
active, respectively (P interaction0.06).
Associations of Serum Calcium, Phosphate, and
iPTH Levels and PAD
Higher quartiles of serum calcium, phosphate, and iPTH
levels were not associated with PAD (Table 3). Additionally,
modeled as a continuous variable, there was no association
between serum calcium, phosphate, or iPTH and PAD,
overall, or in subgroups (data not shown).
Discussion
In this nationally representative sample of US adults, there
was a strong, graded association between lower levels of
25(OH)D levels and PAD. This association was present after
adjustment for several cardiovascular risk factors and poten-
tial confounders. In contrast, no association was present
between elevated serum calcium, phosphate or iPTH levels,
and PAD in this population.

Epidemiological studies have shown an inverse association
between blood pressure and vitamin D levels18 and a direct
association between increasing latitude, as a surrogate of
lower vitamin D levels, and blood pressure.19 One small
clinical trial suggested that oral vitamin D supplementation20
reduces systolic blood pressure. Additionally, in another trial,
patients randomized to ultraviolet light exposure 3 times a
week experienced a 180% increase in 25(OH)D levels and
improved blood pressure control.21 However, another small
study did not show this effect on blood pressure.22
The association of 25(OH)D deficiency with glucose in-
tolerance23 and the metabolic syndrome24 is another potential
mechanism for increased cardiovascular disease risk. In 1
study of older adults with impaired fasting glucose, supple-
mentation with vitamin D and calcium attenuated the pro-
gression of insulin resistance and hyperglycemia.25 However,
in the current study, a graded association between 25(OH)D
and PAD remained present after adjustment for diabetes
mellitus and glycohemoglobin.
The association of both 25(OH)D and 1,25(OH)2
vitamin D
levels with cardiovascular events remains controversial. In
some studies, low 25(OH)D levels have been associated with
increased prevalence of coronary heart disease (CHD),9
stroke,26 and congestive heart failure.27 However, low
25(OH)D has been associated with a protective association in
other studies. For example, in a case­control study of 143
patients with CHD by Rajasree, 25(OH)D levels 89 ng/mL
were associated with a multivariable-adjusted odds ratio for
CHD of 3.18 (95% CI: 1.31, 7.73).10 In contrast, in a
case­control study of acute myocardial infarction by Scragg,
25(OH)D levels above the median (12.8 ng/mL) were
protective against CHD (multivariable adjusted odds ra-
tio0.43, 95% CI: 0.27, 0.69).9 In the Scragg study,
25(OH)D levels were notably lower than in the study by
Rajasree.10
Among 1739 Framingham Offspring Study participants
free of cardiovascular disease at baseline, a 25(OH)D level
15 ng/mL was associated with a multivariable-adjusted
62% higher hazard of developing a first cardiovascular
event.11 Interestingly, PAD, defined as the onset of new
claudication, was included in the outcome definition. How-
ever, PAD only comprised 8 of the 120 events in the study.
There are several lines of evidence suggesting that vitamin
D may play a role in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular

disease. Cardiac myocytes possess vitamin D receptors.28
Several in vitro studies have shown that active vitamin D
inhibits cardiac myocyte hypertrophy.7,29 Paricalcitol, an
active vitamin D compound, attenuated the development of
left ventricular hypertrophy in Dahl salt-sensitive rats.30
Vitamin D has been shown to be an inhibitor of the renin­
angiotensin system.6 In addition, several small studies have
shown that supplementation with various forms of vitamin D
may improve the cytokine profile (CRP, TNF- levels) of
patients with vitamin D deficiency31 and congestive heart
failure.32 Cellular experiments showed that active vitamin D
and its analogs exhibit anticoagulant activity.8 Finally, the
vitamin D-24-hydroxylase transgenic rat, a model of vitamin
D deficiency attributable to continuous degradation of active
vitamin D, develops aortic atherosclerosis.33 Interestingly, an
early experimental model of atherosclerosis was the choles-
terol and vitamin D­fed rat. These rats were given an
extremely high dose of vitamin D2 (1.8 million units/kg), and
developed aortic atherosclerosis.34 It is interesting that animal
models of both excessive and insufficient vitamin D develop
atherosclerosis and that there is conflicting human data on
very high levels and very low levels of 25(OH)D being
associated with cardiovascular disease9­11 suggesting that
there may be an optimal level that is neither too high nor
too low.
The results of the current study show that the association
between low 25(OH)D levels and the prevalence of PAD was
consistent across multiple subgroups. In the subgroup analy-
ses, the association was stronger for non-Hispanic whites and
for participants without diabetes mellitus. However, the
interaction terms were not significant for non-Hispanic blacks
versus whites (P interaction0.31) or diabetes status (P
interaction0.19). Although one should be cautious inter-
preting the results from subgroup analyses because of the
reduced sample size and statistical power, these results are
similar to those reported by Scragg et al.35 This line of
investigation deserves further research.
The association we report is cross-sectional, similar to 2
previous smaller studies of 25(OH)D and PAD.36,37 In a study
of 161 patients with angiographically proven PAD, those with
Stage II PAD, defined as the presence of claudication
symptoms, had higher mean 25(OH)D levels (23.4 ng/mL)
compared to patients with Stage IV PAD, defined as the
presence of ulcers (9.4 ng/mL).37 Similarly, in a separate
study of 95 patients with angiographically proven PAD,
patients with Stage II PAD had higher 25(OH)D levels
compared to Stage IV PAD.36 The results of the current study
extend these findings to a large nationally representative
population with clinical and subclinical PAD.
High iPTH levels have been associated with cardiovascular
disease in the general population.13 Elevated serum phosphate
levels have also been associated with cardiovascular events, a
composite outcome which included peripheral vascular dis-
ease, in a community-based study.14 Despite these suggestive
findings, we did not find an association between serum
calcium, phosphate, and iPTH levels and the prevalence
of PAD.

There are potential limitations to the current study. Most
notably, the study was cross-sectional. As in any cross-
sectional study, one must be cautious in interpreting the
direction of the association. It has been hypothesized that
patients with PAD may be less mobile and therefore receive
less sun exposure and have lower 25(OH)D levels. Although
this may be the case for severe PAD, all participants in the
current study were noninstitutionalized and mobile enough to
attend the NHANES visit. An additional limitation is the lack
of data in NHANES on sun exposure, geographic location,
and the season during which participants attended their study
visits. Another potential limitation is that angiography was
not used to detect PAD, which was impractical in a large,
population-based survey. Despite these limitations, the cur-
rent study maintains several strengths. Using the ABI allowed
us to identify the presence of subclinical PAD. NHANES
included a broad range of data collection. This allowed us to
study 25(OH)D, calcium, phosphate, and iPTH and perform
statistical analyses after adjustment for several potential
confounding factors. Additional strengths include standard-
ized protocols with rigorous quality control for data collec-
tion and inclusion of a large nationally representative study
sample. The large sample size allowed the investigation of the
association between 25(OH)D and PAD in several important
subgroups. The consistency of the results in these subgroups
is noteworthy.
In summary, in this nationally representative study, US
adults with low 25(OH)D levels had a higher prevalence of
PAD. This association was strong, graded, and present after
adjustment for multiple cardiovascular risk factors. Prospec-
tive and mechanistic studies are needed to confirm these
associations.
