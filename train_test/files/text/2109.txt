Background
Research shows that personality is relatively stable in
adulthood, yet there are individual differences in the degree
and direction of change (Roberts, Walton, & Viechtbauer,
2006). There is some evidence that personality changes
in a socially desirable direction may be adaptive for physical
health and longevity (Mroczek & Spiro, 2007; Turiano et al.,
2011). Although personality has been well documented
as a significant correlate of cognitive performance (Meier,
Perrig-Chiello, & Perrig, 2002) across the adult life span
(Baker & Bichsel, 2006; Willis & Boron, 2008), few studies
have examined whether the patterns and magnitude of person-
ality change or stability are related to cognitive performance.
The objectives of the current study were to examine individual
differences in the stability and change of personality traits
in relation to cognitive performance and to consider whether
this relationship varies by age.
Both personality and cognition are core aspects of adult
behavior and functioning, and some have considered intel-
lectual abilities to be a subcomponent of personality
(Ackerman & Rolfhus, 1999; Cattell, 1943). A number of
studies have shown that there are associations between
these two major domains, especially using the five-factor
model of personality traits and a wide range of cognitive
dimensions. A large body of literature has established age-
related declines in cognitive abilities including short-term
memory, verbal fluency, executive functioning, episodic
and working memory, as well as reaction time. Even though,
on average, abilities decline, there are individual differences
in the magnitude and patterns of change (Salthouse &
Ferrer-Caja, 2003). More work is needed to understand
individual difference factors such as personality traits that
could be related to such variations in cognitive aging.
Personality may serve as a protective resource or a source of
vulnerability when it comes to changes in cognitive perfor-
mance (Costa & McCrae, 1997; Costa, Metter, & McCrae,
1994; Kranz Graham & Lachman, 2011).
Personality and Cognition
We first review the major findings linking personality and
cognition in adulthood before turning to our main focus on
personality stability and change in relation to cognitive func-
tioning. Although much of this work has been correlational
and does not allow for clear conclusions about directionality
or mechanisms, we present the most promising theoretically
derived suggestions about the processes involved in these
linkages.
Neuroticism is consistently linked to lower performance
across various domains including executive functioning,
information processing, pattern analysis, memory, and crea-
tivity (Ackerman & Heggestad, 1997; Chamorro-Premuzic,

Objectives. Although personality is relatively stable over time, there are individual differences in the patterns and
magnitude of change. There is some evidence that personality change in adulthood is related to physical health and
longevity. The present study expanded this work to consider whether personality stability or change would be associated
with better cognitive functioning, especially in later adulthood.
Method. A total of 4,974 individuals participated in two waves of The Midlife in the United States Study (MIDUS) in
1994­1995 and 2004­2005. Participants completed the MIDUS personality inventory at both times and the Brief Test of
Adult Cognition by Telephone cognitive battery at Time 2.
Results. Multiple regression and analysis of covariance analyses showed that, consistent with predictions, individuals
remaining stable in openness to experience and neuroticism had faster reaction times and better inductive reasoning than
those who changed. Among older adults, those who remained stable or decreased in neuroticism had significantly faster
reaction times than those who increased.
Conclusions. As predicted, personality stability on some traits was associated with more adaptive cognitive performance
on reasoning and reaction time. Personality is discussed as a possible resource for protecting against or minimizing
age-related declines in cognition.

Furnham, & Ackerman, 2006; McCrae & Costa, 1987;
Moutafi, Furnham, & Crump, 2003; Moutafi, Furnham, &
Paltiel, 2005; Schaie, Willis, & Caskie, 2004; Williams,
Suchy, & Kraybill, 2010; Willis & Boron, 2008). Possible
mechanisms are that individuals high in neuroticism are
characteristically more anxious and prone to intrusive thinking
and distraction, which likely impedes their ability to focus
on a task. Neuroticism is not necessarily linked to intelligence
or inherent ability but is associated with an individual's
ability to perform in a given situation. Extraversion also is
related to cognition but the directional nature of the rela-
tionship varies. It has been associated with better creativity,
speed, long-term memory, and intelligence, but worse diver-
gent thinking, crystallized intelligence, spatial orientation,
reasoning, and verbal ability (Ackerman & Heggestad, 1997;
Baker & Bichsel, 2006; Chamorro-Premuzic, Furnham, &
Ackerman, 2006; Chamorro-Premuzic, Furnham, & Petrides,
2006; McCrae & Costa, 1987; Moutafi et al., 2005; Willis &
Boron, 2008). Extraverted individuals may be less invested
in intellectual activities than social ones or are less likely
to develop effective study habits or test-taking strategies
(Chamorro-Premuzic, Furnham, & Ackerman, 2006). Further,
extraverted individuals may be better at performing speed-
based tasks but worse at tasks requiring effortful processing
because they are less inclined to deliberate over problems
for long periods of time but thrive in a setting where com-
pleting a task quickly is the goal (Baker & Bichsel, 2006).
Openness to experience has been consistently linked to
intelligence and cognitive performance, specifically with
executive functioning, divergent thinking, creativity, verbal
ability, verbal memory, spatial orientation, and inductive
reasoning (Ackerman & Rolfhus, 1999; Baker & Bichsel,
2006; Chamorro-Premuzic, Furnham, & Ackerman, 2006;
DeYoung, Flanders, & Peterson, 2008; DeYoung, Peterson, &
Higgins, 2005; Higgins, Peterson, Pihl, & Lee, 2007; Holland,
Dollinger, Holland, & MacDonald, 1995; McCrae & Costa,
1987; Schaie et al., 2004; Sharp, Reynolds, Pedersen, &
Gatz, 2010; Williams et al., 2010; Willis & Boron, 2008).
Those who are flexible and open minded are more likely to
perform well on complex tasks and abstract reasoning than
those who are more rigid and narrow minded (Schaie, Dutta, &
Willis, 1991). Conscientiousness shows positive associations
to reasoning, speed, and academic performance but is nega-
tively related to intelligence, verbal ability, reasoning, and
divergent thinking (McCrae & Costa, 1987; Moutafi et al.,
2003; Moutafi et al., 2005; Schaie et al., 2004; Willis &
Boron, 2008). Individuals who need to work hard to do well
on cognitive tasks may develop conscientious characteristics
as a means of compensation, such that being more organized,
motivated, and deliberate may help him or her perform well.
Finally, agreeableness, which is not typically associated
with cognitive ability, has been linked in a few studies with
worse inductive reasoning, spatial orientation, and general
cognition (Schaie et al., 2004; Willis & Boron, 2008). The
limited findings for agreeableness may be due, in part, to
the fact that it is a trait related to how a person interacts
interpersonally which may not affect their cognitive perfor-
mance. However, the negative association may reflect that
those who are agreeable are not highly invested in demon-
strating cognitive competence but attain success primarily
through their social skills. Further, having higher cognitive
abilities may be associated with being less dependent on
pleasing others; in turn, being less agreeable may "foster
intellectual achievement" (Baker & Bichsel, 2006, p. 869).
Whereas most studies reviewed earlier examined the
personality­cognition relationships without consideration of
age, some have specifically focused on older adults or com-
pared younger and older adults. Baker and Bichsel (2006)
studied the link between cognitive abilities and the "Big
Five" in younger and older adults, who were either cogni-
tively comparable or superior to the young adults. They found
for young adults, openness is a positive predictor of crystal-
lized intelligence and short-term memory, whereas extra-
version is positively related to speed but negatively related to
crystallized intelligence. The cognitively comparable old had
similar results, with positive links for extraversion and long-
term retrieval as well as openness and auditory processing.
Finally, the cognitively superior old not only had a similar
link to openness and visual spatial ability but also in this
group it was also beneficial to be high in conscientiousness
for auditory and short-term memory and low in agreeableness
for better crystallized intelligence (Baker & Bichsel, 2006).
This indicates that individuals who have exceptional cognitive
performance, or have been able to maintain good cognitive
functioning into old age, may have a unique personality
profile. Crowe, Andel, Pedersen, Fratiglioni, & Gatz (2006)
examined the relationship between personality and risk of cog-
nitive impairment in older adults. They measured extraversion
and neuroticism at one time point and cognition at 25-year
intervals and found that those with a combination of high
neuroticism and high extraversion showed the greatest risk
for cognitive impairment and cognitive decline in adulthood.
A recent study by Sharp and colleagues (2010) examined
the role of openness to experience in predicting cognitive
change. They found that openness was associated with better
cognitive performance but not with maintaining cognitive
functioning over time. Individuals high in openness may have
a cognitive advantage in later life, suggesting that being
more open to experience may serve as a protective factor in
older adulthood. These studies show that personality traits are
related to cognitive performance in adults, and moreover, this
relation may vary across the adult life span. There are wide
individual differences in cognitive performance and pat-
terns of change with aging, and personality factors may
moderate age differences or changes in cognitive performance.
Personality and Aging
There is a good deal of evidence that personality remains
relatively stable across the adult life span (Caspi & Bem,
546 GRAHAM AND LACHMAN
PERSONALITY, AGING, AND COGNITION 3
1990; Costa & McCrae, 1997; Roberts & Del Vecchio, 2000;
Weiss et al., 2005). There is some indication that personality
is a resource that may be protective against declines in health
and may be a contributor to successful aging and other behav-
ioral outcomes (Costa & McCrae, 1980; Costa et al., 1994;
Funder & Colvin, 1991). "Traits provide the stable structure
of personality within which the aging individual copes,
adjusts, defends, compensates, or adjusts" (Costa & McCrae,
1980, p. 97). Nevertheless, not everyone is stable, and there is
evidence for both average, mean-level change (Schaie et al.,
2004) and correlational, individual differences in change, and
the findings on the nature of change are mixed. Longitudinal
work has shown increases in extraversion, agreeableness and
conscientiousness, and decreases in neuroticism across the
adult life span (Cramer, 2003; Roberts et al., 2006). Others
have found that extraversion is stable (Mroczek & Spiro,
2003) or declines with age (Mottus, Johnson, & Deary, 2011;
Schaie et al., 2004). One possible reason for the discrepant
findings is that most studies examine only general trait-level
changes, whereas the profile of change in extraversion may
differ by specific facets, as reported by Terracciano, Costa,
and McCrae (2006).
An extensive body of research has examined individual
differences in personality change across the adult life span;
yet few, if any, have looked directly at the relation to adult
cognition. Recent studies suggest that changes and stability
in personality, specifically neuroticism, are related to later
life outcomes such as risk of dementia (Duchek, Balota,
Storandt, & Larsen, 2007) and mortality (Mroczek & Spiro,
2007). Further, the literature suggests a possible mechanism
in that neuroticism change may be associated with mor-
tality because individuals high or increasing in neuroticism
may engage in riskier health behaviors (Mroczek, Spiro, &
Turiano, 2009). Costa and McCrae (1980) and Costa, McCrae,
and Arenberg (1980) suggested that the stable personality is
the adaptive norm. Further, the work of Roberts and colleagues
(2000) has shown that personality becomes more stable with
age and is by and large stabilized by age 50. Personality is less
likely to change in later life except in extreme conditions (such
as major life events or disease). Given this, it seems reasonable
to expect that personality change in later life would not be
ideal. Thus, stability in personality, in contrast to change in any
direction, may have a significant beneficial impact on later life
health outcomes, including cognitive performance.
The Present Study
The overall purpose of this study was to examine the
relationship of personality to cognitive performance across
the adult life span in a large national sample, with four specific
objectives. The first goal was to explore personality, specif-
ically the big five traits (neuroticism, extraversion, consci-
entiousness, openness, and agreeableness), in relation to
cognitive performance across multiple cognitive domains
including reasoning, reaction time, speed of processing,
working memory, episodic memory, and verbal fluency. The
second objective was to examine the magnitude of individual
differences in stability and change of personality over the
course of 8­10 years. Third, we examined whether individual
differences in stability and change of personality were related
to cognition, that is, whether cognitive performance varies
as a function of the magnitude and direction of change in
personality. Finally, we examined whether the relationships
between cognition, personality, and change in personality
varied by age.
Our first hypothesis was that personality would be related
to cognitive performance. Based on patterns in prior work
with more age homogenous samples, we expected that neu-
roticism would be negatively associated with performance
and that openness and conscientiousness would be positively
associated with performance across all cognitive domains.
Furthermore, we expected to find that extraversion would be
associated with poorer performance on tasks involving more
effortful processing, specifically reasoning and episodic
memory, but faster performance on speed of processing and
reaction time.
Our second hypothesis was that there would be moderately
high correlational stability, with some evidence for individual
differences in rank-order change for personality from Time 1
to Time 2. We also expected mean-level changes in personality
from Time 1 to Time 2; specifically, that neuroticism would
decrease and that openness, conscientiousness, extraversion,
and agreeableness would increase as suggested in past studies
(Cramer, 2003; Roberts et al., 2006).
Our third hypothesis was that individual differences in
personality stability and change would be related to cognitive
performance, as has been found with regard to mortality
(Mroczek & Spiro, 2007) and dementia (Duchek et al.,
2007). Those who were stable in neuroticism, extraversion,
openness, agreeableness, and conscientiousness were expected
to have higher cognitive performance than those who changed
in either direction.
Finally, for our fourth hypothesis, we predicted that the
relationship of cognition with personality and personality
change would vary by age. We expected that stability of
personality would benefit the cognitive performance of older
adults more so than younger adults (Costa et al., 1994).
Method
Participants
Participants were community-dwelling adults from the
Midlife in the United States Study (MIDUS), which was
conducted at two time periods. Time 1 data were collected
in 1994­1995 and included a sample of 7,112 adults aged
20­79 years. Time 2 data were collected in 2004­2005
and consisted of 4,974 adults aged 28­84 years, which is
approximately 70% of the original sample, adjusted for
mortality (Brim, Ryff, & Kessler, 2004). Compared with

those who dropped out, those who completed the study
reported lower neuroticism (survivors: M = 2.23, SD = 0.66;
dropouts: M = 2.27, SD = 0.67); t(6,260) = 2.43, p < .05,
higher conscientiousness (survivors: M = 3.44, SD = 0.44;
dropouts: M = 3.38, SD = 0.46), t(6265) = 4.28, p < .001,
and higher education level (survivors: M = 7.03, SD = 2.47;
dropouts: M = 6.18, SD = 2.43), t(7,085) = 13.45, p < .001.
There were no differences in age, level of extraversion,
agreeableness, or openness.
Procedures
Personality measures were collected at Time 1 and Time
2 by mail questionnaire, and cognitive data were collected
only at Time 2 and by telephone.
Measures
Age.--Age was computed by subtracting the interview
date from the participant's reported birthdate, rounded to a
whole number. Time 2 age ranges were 32­84 (M = 55,
SD = 12.4). We computed a five-group age variable, which
was broken down by decade for the analysis of covariance
(ANCOVA).
Education.--Education was measured categorically on
a scale of 1 to 12 and ranged from 1 = some grade school,
6 = 1­2 years college, no degree, 9 = 4-year college degree
to 12 = doctoral level degree (M = 7.2, SD = 2.52).
Health.--A health composite was computed, consisting
of the number of chronic and acute conditions, and function
limitations were reported and recoded so that higher scores
reflect better health.
Hearing problems.--Hearing was measured by asking
participants to rate their hearing compared with others their
age, on a 5-point scale (1 = excellent, 5 = poor).
Personality.--Personality was measured using the MIDUS
survey questionnaire in which the Big Five personality traits
were assessed. Participants were asked the degree to which
self-descriptive adjectives described them (Lachman &
Prenda-Firth, 2004; Lachman & Weaver, 1998). This measure
has been validated and significantly correlates with the NEO
trait scales (see http://www.brandeis.edu/departments/psych/
lachman/instruments/other-instruments.html). Each question
was scored on a 1­4 scale, with 1 = A lot, 2 = Some, 3 = A
little, and 4 = Not at all. The variables were recoded so that
high scores reflected higher levels of that particular trait,
and means were calculated for each item set. Coefficient
alphas are as follows: neuroticism (moody, worrying, nervous,
calm--not reverse coded) = .74; extraversion (outgoing,
friendly, lively, active, talkative) = .78; openness (creative,
imaginative, intelligence, curious, broadminded, sophisticated,
adventurous) = .77; conscientiousness (organized, responsible,
hardworking, careless--not reverse coded) = .58; and agree-
ableness (helpful, warm, caring, softhearted, sympathetic) = .80
(Prenda & Lachman, 2001).
Cognitive measures.--All cognitive measures are part of
the MIDUS 2 Brief Test of Adult Cognition by Telephone,
which was designed to test areas of cognition that are sensitive
to age effects (Lachman & Tun, 2008; Tun & Lachman,
2008). The battery takes 20 min or less to complete, with
minimal fatigue effects. Interviewers first administered a
numbers-repeat task to make sure that participants were
able to hear clearly. Hearing problems were negatively
correlated with performance on the cognitive measures
(Episodic Memory = -.18, p < .001; Reasoning = -.09,
p < .001;Verbal Fluency = -.08, p < .001;Working Memory =
-.09, p < .001) and positively correlated with latencies for
reaction time (RT = 0.08, p < .001), such that worse hearing
was associated with poorer performance, so this was included
in all models as a covariate.
Working memory was assessed using the backward digit
span from the Wecshler Adult Intelligence Scale-III test
(Wechsler, 1997) where participants were asked to repeat
strings of numbers in reverse order. Each level has an
increased number of digits, and participants have two
chances to accurately complete each level. Scores range
from 2 to 8 digits and scores represent the largest set size
that was correctly completed.
Processing speed was measured using a backward counting
task. Participants were given 30 s to count backward from
100 as quickly and accurately as possible. The score is the
number of correct numbers reported, subtracting skipped
and erroneous numbers.
Reaction time latencies were measured using the Stop
and Go Switch task (Tun & Lachman, 2008). Participants
completed two single task trials with 20 blocks each, first
with a congruent response (to RED, say "STOP," to GREEN,
say "GO"), then with an incongruent response (to RED, say
"GO," to GREEN, say "STOP"). In the mixed trials, partic-
ipants were given a cue to switch between congruent and
noncongruent responses. The task sequence was randomized,
so switch cues were given at random intervals in order to
increase sensitivity to age effects (Tun & Lachman, 2008).
For the current analysis, the median reaction time score in
seconds for the mixed trials in which individuals switched
between congruent and incongruent cues was used.
Reasoning was assessed using a number series completion
task where participants were given a series of numbers (such
as "3 6 9 12 15") and asked to generate the next number in
the progression. They received five series, with increasing
levels of difficulty. Scores were calculated based on the
number of sets correctly completed for each level, for a
highest possible score of 5.
Episodic memory, immediate and delayed, was assessed
using the Rey Auditory-Verbal Learning Test (Lezak, 1995;
548 GRAHAM AND LACHMAN
PERSONALITY, AGING, AND COGNITION 5
Rey, 1964; Taylor, 1959). Participants were instructed to
listen to a list of 15 words read aloud at the rate of one word
per second. They were then given 1 min to recall as many
words as they could. One point was given for each correct
response for a total possible score of 15. Episodic memory
delayed was not significantly related to personality, so it is
not included in the analyses.
Verbal fluency was measured using the category fluency
task (Kozora & Cullum, 1995; Lezak, 1995). Participants
were given 1 min to generate as many words within the
category "animal" as they could. Scores were based on the
number of unique words they could generate within 60 s.
The number of repeated words and intrusion errors were
omitted from their final score.
Data Analysis
Personality and cognitive performance.--Six regression
models were analyzed, one for each cognitive dimension as
the dependent variable (reaction time, speed, verbal fluency,
reasoning, episodic memory immediate, and working mem-
ory). Age, education, sex, health, and hearing were entered
as predictors in Step 1, and at Step 2 the five personality
traits from Time 2 were added. Interactions between centered
age and personality were computed and entered into Step 3,
but none were significant so they are not reported below.
Further, speed of processing was not significantly predicted
by any trait, so this model is not reported below.
Personality stability and change.--Change in personality
was computed by subtracting the personality scores at Time 1
from Time 2 scores. The use of change scores is considered
acceptable especially with just two measurement occasions
(i.e., Rogosa, 1988; Rogosa & Saner, 1995), as multivariate
approaches, such as multilevel modeling, require three or
more occasions. To examine whether those who were stable
differed from those who changed (either increased or
decreased), we created categorical change variables and
analyzed them using a series of univariateANCOVA models.
Based on the procedure used by Schaie (1984) and Willis
and Schaie (2006), three personality change groups were
formed, with change scores within 1 SD classified as the
stable group, scores 1.0 SD below the mean were classified
as the decrease group, and scores more than 1.0 SD above
the mean were classified as the increase group. For addi-
tional follow-up analyses, the stable group was dichoto-
mized (high and low) via median split at both Time 1 and
Time 2, based on the raw score of each trait. Individuals
who were high at both Time 1 and Time 2 were labeled as
stable high, whereas individuals who were low at both Time
1 and Time 2 were labeled as stable-low.
Personality change, cognitive performance, and age
differences.--The categorical change group variables (stable,
increase, decrease for each personality trait) were entered
together as independent variables, in a univariate ANCOVA
to determine the mean differences between these groups on
cognitive performance after controlling for health, hearing
problems, sex, education, and age. We also examined the
interaction between age group and personality change
group to determine whether the effects of personality change
on cognition varied by age.
Results
Personality and Cognitive Performance
Each analysis included all available cases. For demographic
variables, we found that age (-), education (+), health (+), and
hearing problems (-) were significantly related to cognition.
Also, sex was significantly related, with men showing higher
verbal fluency and reasoning and women higher episodic
memory and reaction time. The regression analyses showed
that, after controlling for age, sex, education, health, and
hearing, personality added a significant amount of variance
to the models for reasoning (R2 = .02, p < .001), episodic
memory (R2 = .01, p < .001), working memory (R2 = .01,

of the computed change groups (described previously) for
all traits showed that 64%­65% of those in the stable group
were from the older age group (groups computed via median
split), consistent with prior findings showing stability is
greater after age 50 (Roberts et al., 2006).
Personality Change, Cognitive Performance, and Age
Differences
To test the third and fourth hypotheses, we tested the 3
(Personality Change Group) × 5(Age Group) univariate
ANCOVA for each of the cognitive domains as the dependent
variables, controlling for sex, hearing problems, health, and
education. These analyses tested the relationships between
personality change and cognition, and whether these relation-
ships varied by age. Table 2 summarizes the significant
effects from each model. Results indicate that change in
neuroticism was significantly related to reasoning (p < .01).
Post hoc pairwise comparisons indicated that those stable in
neuroticism (M = 2.33, SE = 0.04) had higher reasoning
scores compared with those either increasing (M = 2.12,
SE = 0.08, p < .01) or decreasing (M = 2.13, SE = 0.08,
p < .01). Moreover, those who remained stable and low
(M = 2.55, SE = 0.05) in neuroticism had better reasoning than
those who were stable high (M = 2.30, SE = 0.05, p < .01).
Those who increased did not differ from those who were stable
and high in neuroticism fromTime 1 toTime 2, suggesting that
maintaining low neuroticism is best for reasoning perfor-
mance. Change in neuroticism was also significantly related
to reaction time (p < .001) with post hoc analyses revealing
that those who were stable (M = 1.28, SE = 0.01, p < .001)
or decreased (M = 1.28, SE = 0.02, p < .01) in neuroticism
had faster reaction times than those who increased (M = 1.37,
SE = 0.02). Change in openness was associated with reasoning
(p < .01), and post hoc comparisons showed that remaining
stable (M = 2.35, SE = 0.04) was associated with higher
reasoning than increasing (M = 2.09, SE = 0.08, p < .01) or
decreasing (M = 2.15, SE = 0.08, p < .05) and that being stable
and high in openness (M = 2.47, SE = 0.04) is associated
with the best performance (p < .01).
Finally, in support of our fourth hypothesis, we found that
the relation of reaction time to change in neuroticism varied by
age (p < .05), such that, for older adults, those who increased
in neuroticism (M = 1.74, SE = 0.06) performed signifi-
cantly worse (higher latencies) than those who either re-
mained stable (M = 1.51, SE = 0.03) or decreased (M = 1.40,
SE = 0.06) (p < .01), see Figure 1.
Discussion
The current findings show that individual differences in
neuroticism, extraversion, openness, and agreeableness are
related to cognitive performance across the adult years. As
expected, we found that there was relative stability, in terms of
cross occasion correlations, from Time 1 to Time 2 (Costa &
McCrae, 1997; Schaie et al., 2004), as well as significant
p < .001), and verbal fluency (R2 = .02, p < .001). Neurot-
icism was negatively related to working memory (p < .05)
and reasoning (p < .001) see Table 1. Extraversion was
negatively related to reasoning (p < .001) and marginally
related to verbal fluency (p < .10), indicating that high
extraversion is related to lower cognitive performance,
which supports our hypothesis that extraversion would be
associated to worse performance on tasks requiring effortful
processing. Openness was, as expected, positively related to
almost all aspects of cognition, including reasoning (p < .01),
verbal fluency (p < .001), working memory (p < .05), and
episodic memory (p < .01). Agreeableness showed a few
weak, although significant, negative associations with cog-
nition, including verbal fluency (p < .05), reasoning (p < .05),
and reaction time (p < .05). Conscientiousness was not
significantly related to any cognitive domain.
Personality Stability and Change
To test the second hypothesis, we first looked at the
correlations from Time 1 to Time 2. Correlational stability,
that is, the Time 1 to Time 2 correlation (Baltes, Reese, &
Nesselroade, 1977), was significant for all traits: agreeableness
(r = .64, p < .001), conscientiousness (r = .61, p < .001),
openness (r = .69, p < .001), neuroticism (r = .64, p < .001),
and extraversion (r = .70, p < .001). To analyze whether
there was mean-level change in personality, dependent t
tests were computed, and results showed there were significant
decreases in neuroticism (T1: M = 2.22, SD = .66; T2:
M = 2.07, SD = 0.63), t(3,861) = 18.08, p < .001; extraver-
sion (T1: M = 3.19, SD = 0.55; T2: M = 3.10, SD = 0.57),
t(3,865) = 13.25, p < .001; agreeableness (T1: M = 3.48,
SD = 0.40; T2: M = 3.45, SD = 0.50), t(3,863) = 4.69, p <
.001, t(3,864) = 2.11, p < .05; and openness (T1: M = 3.01,
SD = 0.52; T2: M = 2.90, SD = 0.54), t(3,830) = 15.98, p <
.001 and no change in conscientiousness (T1: M = 3.45,
SD = 0.43; T2: M = 3.46, SD = 0.43, p > .05). The stability
correlations from Time 1 to Time 2 were quite similar for
both older and younger adults, ranging from .60 to .71 for all
traits and across age groups (p < .001). Further examination

mean-level changes in neuroticism, extraversion, openness,
agreeableness, and conscientiousness (Roberts et al., 2006).
Moreover, the extent of stability versus change in personality
also was related to cognition, with some variations by age.
Our findings related to our first hypothesis regarding
relationships between personality and cognition were mostly
consistent with previous studies. The findings for neuroticism
support previous work, suggesting that high neuroticism
may interfere with performance, which could be explained
by the heightened anxiety and intrusive thoughts associated
with neuroticism (Moutafi et al., 2005; Stelmack, Houlihan, &
McGarry-Roberts, 1993). For extraversion, our findings
were consistent with the studies showing that high extraversion
is associated with lower performance on tasks that require
effortful processing such as reasoning (e.g., Baker & Bichsel,
2006; Wolf & Ackerman, 2005). High openness and was
associated with better cognitive performance, which supports
past work, suggesting that individuals high in openness
have high intelligence and cognitive ability (Ackerman &
Heggestad, 1997) and indicates that individuals who are
intellectually engaged, pursue new interests, and think crit-
ically may have higher cognition and may possibly maintain
this ability as they age (Baker & Bichsel, 2006; Lachman,
Agrigoroaei, Murphy, & Tun, 2010). Finally, high agreeable-
ness was associated with lower performance, as supported by
limited other work (Baker & Bichsel, 2006). There were no
associations between conscientiousness and performance.
Adding to the body of work on personality and cognition,
we found that individual differences in stability and change
in personality were related to cognitive performance. Whereas
past research has focused on concurrent relationships between
personality and cognition, the present study expanded the
findings by also considering whether individual differences
in personality change were related to cognition in adulthood.
We found that stability is related to better reasoning perfor-
mance and faster reaction time, than change in either direction,
for neuroticism and openness to experience. This indicates
that maintaining a consistent personality is more beneficial
than even socially desirable change (such as declining in
neuroticism) for some cognitive abilities (with one exception
for neuroticism and reaction time, for which decreases were
also adaptive). Furthermore, we found that the relation
between personality change and cognition varied by age
with respect to neuroticism, such that older adults who
increased in neuroticism had significantly lower reaction
time performance than those who either remained stable or
decreased in neuroticism. This suggests that the effects of
neuroticism may become more detrimental with age, which is
consistent with research showing that increases in neuroticism
can have negative consequences for domains other than cogni-
tion (e.g., physical health, mortality) in later life (Mroczek &
Spiro, 2007; Roberts et al., 2006; Turiano et al., 2011). This
pattern also could be indicative of changes in the brain
and health, which impact both neuroticism and cognition
(e.g., Duchek et al., 2007).
Our findings are consistent with the view that personality
stability may serve as a protective resource throughout
the aging process (Costa et al., 1980; Costa et al., 1994).
The results show that personality stability is associated with
better reasoning and reaction time than change in either
direction in some cases. In other cases, socially desirable
change and stability are both equally effective for cognitive
performance. This was the case for neuroticism, in which
case decreasing was as beneficial as stability for reaction
time. It will be important in future work to consider why
stability may be beneficial for cognitive functioning. Theo-
retical work suggests that personality (Costa et al., 1994)
and behavioral consistency are adaptive (Funder & Colvin,
1991). After many years, adults may become comfortable
"in their own skin," and this familiarity may breed adaptive
functioning especially in the face of changes that could
occur in health and cognitive functioning with age. In contrast,
those who experience personality change, for whatever reason,
may be at a disadvantage as they need to adjust to a different
way of approaching the world. Another possibility is that
changes to personality could be caused by major life events
or diseases such as dementia. In that case, the positive signs
of stability for cognition may be a reflection of the absence
of major upheavals in one's life (McCrae & Costa, 1994).
As Costa and McCrae have stated "the durability of dispo-
sitions despite biological, social and cognitive changes,
must result from some form of adaptation" (Costa, McCrae,
& Arenberg 1980, p. 799), which provides a framework for
interpreting our results. Nevertheless, more research is needed
to address questions about the mechanisms that allow for
maintenance of personality and the effects on cognitive
performance. It is possible that maintaining low neuroti-
cism and high openness in later life may help buffer
against cognitive declines. Future examination of the un-
derlying mechanisms (e.g., anxiety, social engagement)
of these traits is needed to understand more precisely
how these processes operate.
One of the limitations of the current study is that we only
had cognitive data at one time point. In order to gain further

insights into the directionality and underlying mechanisms
of the patterns observed in the current study, future studies
should examine change in both cognitive performance and
personality. We considered if stability/change in personality
is related to individual differences in cognitive performance
and whether the relationship differs by age. It would be
informative in the future to examine change in both personality
and cognitive performance. This would provide additional
insight into the nature of the relationship including the
directionality. It is possible that changes in cognitive perfor-
mance, including the onset of mild cognitive impairment
or dementia (Duchek et al., 2007), result in changes in
personality. We also acknowledge that we found a limited
number of, albeit consistent, significant effects. Although we
included five personality traits and six cognitive dimensions,
we found significant effects for just four of the relationships.
Nevertheless, of these significant associations, we found that
stability was the most adaptive for cognitive performance in
two of these associations, whereas for the other two effects we
found that change in the adaptive direction to be associated
with better performance. In future work, it will also be
important to consider why these results were found for
reaction time and reasoning and not for the other cognitive
dimensions. Also, in future studies, it will be desirable to
include more than two occasions of measurement. Although
the change score method we used is acceptable, when only two
measurements are available (Rogosa, 1988; Rogosa & Saner,
1995) especially given our large sample, which enhances
the reliability, we acknowledge that future studies would
benefit from having three or more measurements of person-
ality to adequately model change and test directionality
using other methods such as multilevel modeling.
The present results are a first step in demonstrating that
personality change is related to cognitive performance and
that maintaining a stable personality may be an asset for
cognitive functioning, especially in later life. More research
is needed to understand the processes involved in linking
changes in personality and cognition and to consider how
personality dispositions may serve as a protection or vulner-
ability for cognitive declines. This could allow researchers
and clinicians to intervene more effectively into the lives of
middle-aged and older adults to moderate declines in cogni-
tive performance and competence. It could provide valuable
information for tailoring interventions to individual differ-
ences in personality, especially for those who are experi-
encing personality changes in later life.
