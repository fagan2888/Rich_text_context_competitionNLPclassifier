The incidence of skin cancer is on the rise.1,2 Its primary
cause is UV radiation, which accounts for up to 90% of
melanoma and nonmelanoma skin cancers.3 In addi-
tion, exposure to UV radiation is the only recognized modifi-
able risk factor for melanoma. Physicians play an important
role in cancer prevention by counseling patients on modifi-
able lifestyle behaviors, such as smoking cessation to reduce
the risk of lung cancer. However, sun-protection counseling
ranks among the lowest topics of primary prevention dis-
cussed between physicians and patients.4,5
Acknowledging the importance of sun-protective behav-
iors in the prevention of skin cancer, multiple professional or-
ganizations, such as the American Academy of Dermatology,
National Institutes of Health, American Cancer Society, Ameri-
can Academy of Pediatrics, American College of Gynecolo-
gists, and American Academy of Family Physicians, recom-
mend physicians provide patient counseling regarding sun
exposure and sun-protective behaviors.6-11 The US Preventa-
tiveServicesTaskForceconcludedin2012thattherewas"mod-
erate certainty of moderate benefit" from recommending pa-
tient counseling on sun protection for fair-skinned patients
aged 10 to 24 years and that there was insufficient evidence
to recommend for or against sun-protection counseling in pa-
tients older than 24 years.12
Major recommendations for sun-protective behaviors are
similar among different health care organizations. Such rec-
IMPORTANCE Sunscreen is an important part of sun protection to prevent skin cancer but
may not be recommended as often as guidelines dictate.
OBJECTIVE To evaluate trends in sunscreen recommendation among physicians to determine
whether they are following suggested patient-education guidelines regarding sun protection,
and to assess data regarding physician sunscreen recommendations to determine the
association with patient demographics, physician specialty, and physician diagnosis.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS The National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey was
queried to identify patient visits to nonfederal outpatient physician offices at US ambulatory
care practices (January 1, 1989Â­December 26, 2010) during which sunscreen was
recommended.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Frequency of sunscreen recommendation.
RESULTS According to the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey, there were an
estimated 18.30 billion patient visits nationwide. Physicians mentioned sunscreen at
approximately 12.83 million visits (0.07%). Mention of sunscreen was reported by physicians
at 0.9% of patient visits associated with a diagnosis of skin disease. Dermatologists recorded
the mention of sunscreen the most (86.4% of all visits associated with sunscreen). However,
dermatologists reported mentioning sunscreen at only 1.6% of all dermatology visits.
Sunscreen was mentioned most frequently to white patients, particularly those in their eighth
decade of life, and least frequently to children. Actinic keratosis was the most common
diagnosis associated with sunscreen recommendation.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Despite encouragement to provide patient education
regarding sunscreen use and sun-protective behaviors, the rate at which physicians are
mentioning sunscreen at patient visits is quite low, even for patients with a history of skin
cancer. The high incidence and morbidity of skin cancer can be greatly reduced with the
implementation of sun-protective behaviors, which patients should be counseled about at
outpatient visits.

ommendationsinclude:(1)seekingshadeandavoidingthesun,
especially during the hours of 10 AM to 4 PM; (2) wearing sun-
protective clothing, including long-sleeved shirts and wide-
brimmed hats; (3) applying and reapplying sunscreen; and (4)
avoiding artificial UV light.1,7,10,13 Although avoiding expo-
sure to UV radiation is a key component of sun-protective be-
havior, this is not always practical. Therefore, sunscreen is an
important component of sun protection, as it prevents epider-
mal and dermal damage secondary to UV radiation exposure.
As a result, sunscreen decreases the incidence of actinic kera-
toses, squamous cell carcinomas, and melanoma skin
cancers.14-17 In addition, sunscreen is recommended for a di-
versity of photosensitive skin conditions, such as actinic der-
matitis, melasma, porphyria cutanea tarda, polymorphic light
eruption, actinic prurigo, lupus erythematosus, and drug-
induced photosensitivity as seen with acne medications.18-20
Although physicians are encouraged to counsel patients on
sunscreen use, no studies in the medical literature, to our
knowledge, report how often US physicians are recommend-
ing sunscreen. Therefore, the primary objective of this study
was to assess trends in sunscreen recommendations by dif-
ferent physician specialties to determine whether physicians
are recommending sunscreen as their respective organiza-
tions advocate. Also, patient education alters patient prac-
tices; however, physicians often reserve such counseling for
certain subsets of patients. Hence, data regarding physician di-
agnoses and patient demographics were evaluated to deter-
mine which subsets of patients were most likely to receive sun-
screen recommendations.
Methods
DatawereobtainedfromtheNationalAmbulatoryMedicalCare
Survey (NAMCS), which is an ongoing survey conducted by the
National Center for Health Statistics. The survey was started
in1974butwasnotconductedannuallyuntil1989.TheNAMCS
collects descriptive data regarding ambulatory visits to non-
federal, office-based physicians in the United States. Sam-
pling is stratified by sampling units (county, contiguous coun-
ties, and standard metropolitan areas), physician practices
within the sampling units, and patient visits within the prac-
tice occurring within 52 weekly periods. Participating physi-
cians are instructed to record information about patient vis-
its for a 1-week period and include patient demographics,
insurancestatus,reasonforvisit,diagnoses,procedures,thera-
peutics, and referrals made at that time. Data collected for the
NAMCSareenteredintoamultistageprobabilitysampletopro-
duce national estimates.
In the present study, the NAMCS database was queried to
identify patient visits between January 1, 1989, and Decem-
ber 26, 2010, during which sunscreen was recorded. When a
medication or over-the-counter product is recorded for a
NAMCS patient visit, it indicates the product was currently
being used by the patient, was dispensed in the office, or was
prescribed or recommended by the physician at that particu-
lar visit. After these visits were identified, data regarding pa-
tient demographics, physician specialty, and physician diag-
noses were assessed. In addition, we looked at patient visits
associated with a diagnosis of skin disease (as previously de-
fined by Fleischer et al21) and, more specifically, a history of
skin cancer (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Re-
vision, Clinical Modification codes V10.82 and V10.83), actinic
keratosis (702.0), and current skin cancer (172.x, 173.x, and
232.x). These visits were further characterized as visits to der-
matologists, internists, pediatricians, general or family phy-
sicians, and other specialists. The top 10 diagnoses associ-
ated with the highest frequencies of sunscreen use by each
specialty were determined. Linear regressions were per-
formed to determine trends in use during this period. All data
wereanalyzedusingSASstatisticalsoftware(SASInstituteInc).
The study was declared exempt by the Wake Forest Univer-
sity Health Sciences institutional review board.
Results
From January 1, 1989, through December 26, 2010, there were
an estimated 18.30 billion patient visits; of those, sunscreen
was recommended at 12.83 million visits (0.07%) (Table 1). No
differences in sunscreen recommendation were detected with
respect to patient sex or ethnicity (Table 1). With regard to pa-
tient race, sunscreen was recommended in 237 visits annu-
ally for every 100 000 visits by white US residents compared
with 26 visits annually for every 100 000 visits by black indi-
viduals. With data stratified by age groups of 10-year inter-
vals,sunscreenwasrecommendedthemostforpatientsintheir
eighth decade of life (21.8% of visits associated with sun-
screen recommendation). In contrast, sunscreen was recom-
mended the least for children younger than 10 years.
Thefrequencyofsunscreenrecommendationwas12times
greater for patient visits associated with a diagnosis of skin dis-
ease compared with visits with no reported skin disease. Al-
though sunscreen use was mentioned more frequently to pa-
tients with skin disease, such recommendations were made
at less than 1% of visits involving patients with a reported skin
disease diagnosis. There were no statistically significant dif-
ferences in sunscreen mention among different races in pa-
tients with skin disease. However, sunscreen use was recom-
mended more frequently for Hispanic compared with non-
Hispanic patients (1.2% vs 0.9%; P < .001).
Analysis by physician specialty revealed that dermatology
visits accounted for most of the appointments associated with
sunscreen recommendation (86.4%), followed by visits with
general and family practitioners (9.6%), pediatricians (1.4%),
other specialists (1.4%), and internists (1.1%). Although sun-
screen was most frequently recommended by dermatologists,
the mention of sunscreen was recorded at 1.6% of all dermatol-
ogy visits (Table 2). In addition, sunscreen was mentioned by
dermatologists at 11.2% of visits associated with a diagnosis of
active or remote history of skin cancer. This low frequency of

tion of sunscreen by general/family physicians declined 0.03%
per year (P = .03). In addition, mention of sunscreen by a fam-
ily physician decreased 0.1% per year for patient visits associ-
ated with a diagnosis of actinic keratosis (P = .01). However, no
statistically significant changes in sunscreen recommenda-
tion patterns were seen for patients with a history of skin can-
cer (P = .50).
Among all specialists, actinic keratosis was the most com-
mon diagnosis reported at visits during which sunscreen was
recommended, accounting for nearly a quarter (20.9%) of di-
agnoses (Table 3). This was followed by acne (8.1%), benign
neoplasm of the skin (6.8%), other dermatitis due to solar ra-
diation (5.6%), and malignant neoplasm of the skin (5.2%). The
top 10 list of diagnoses associated with sunscreen recommen-
dation was similar among all specialists.
Discussion
Although multiple professional health care organizations
highly recommend that physicians educate patients on sun-
protective behaviors, including proper sunscreen use, NAMCS
data indicate that physicians are mentioning sunscreen at a
very low percentage of all patient visits. Compared with black
patients, white patients were 9 times more likely to be recom-
mended sunscreen. Children and adolescents were recom-
mended sunscreen the least compared with all patient age
groups. Likewise, sunscreen was mentioned at a low number
of pediatric visits. Patients aged 70 to 79 years were recom-
mended sunscreen the most frequently compared with other
age groups, likely resulting from the tendency of this patient
population to have visible solar damage and/or actinic kera-
toses appreciated on physical examination.
The findings are concerning because children and adoles-
cents get the most sun exposure of any age group, as they tend
to spend much of their time playing outdoors. Up to 80% of
sun damage is thought to occur before age 21 years, and sun-
burns in childhood greatly increase the risk for future
melanoma.1,22,23 The American Academy of Pediatrics recog-
nizes the primary role pediatricians have in preventing skin
cancer.Newguidelinesadvisepediatricianstodiscusssunpro-

application, since adequate levels are maintained through diet
and supplementation.10 In addition, pediatricians are highly
encouraged to be strong proponents of sun-protective poli-
cies, such as the SunWise program, which is similar to pro-
gramsimplementedinAustralia.10 Similarly,theAmericanCan-
cer Society and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
emphasize the importance of educating children and adoles-
cents regarding skin cancer. These health care organizations
alsoadvocatetheimplementationofschoolinterventions,such
as permitting the use of hats and encouraging sunscreen use
when children are outside, to reduce their risk for skin cancer.8

In summary, many variables affect the likelihood of sun-

the setting of skin cancer. The American Academy of Derma-
