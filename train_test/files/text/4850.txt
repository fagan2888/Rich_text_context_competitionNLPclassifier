Abstract
Objective: To determine the quantity and quality of articles in the field of knee arthroplasty
worldwide and elucidate the characteristics of global scientific production.
Methods: Web of Science was used to identify articles in the field of knee arthroplasty from 2011
to 2015. The total number of papers, number of papers per capita, total number of citations, and
mean number of citations were collected.
Results: In total, 11,590 papers were identified. The number of publications significantly increased
from 2011 to 2015. Most originated from North America, East Asia, and West Europe. Most
(88.51%) were from high-income countries, 11.48% were from middle-income countries, and only
0.01% were from lower-income countries. The United States had the most articles and total
citations. Sweden had the highest mean citations, followed by Denmark and Canada. However,
when adjusted by population size, Denmark had the most articles per million population, followed
by Switzerland and the Netherlands.
Conclusions: The number of knee arthroplasty publications has rapidly increased in recent years.
The United States is the most prolific, but some European countries are more productive relative
to their population.

However, these contributions to the field of
knee arthroplasty have been unequal among
countries because of different healthcare
systems, financial research sources, and sci-
entific research programs.5,6
The quantity and quality of articles are
important indicators for scientific contribu-
tions and are usually used to analyze the
importance of publications and describe
trends in certain fields.7­10 Assessment of
the global scientific production has recently
been reported in many medical fields,
including critical care medicine,7 the spine,8
hand and wrist surgery,9 endocrinology and
metabolism,10 and arthroscopy.11 To the
best of our knowledge, however, the global
scientific production in the field of knee
arthroplasty has not been reported.
Therefore, the present study was performed
to assess the characteristics of the worldwide
research output in knee arthroplasty.
Materials and methods
On 10 June 2016, a topic search using
the terms ``knee,'' ``replacement,'' ``arthro-
plasty,'' and ``prosthesis'' was performed in
Web of Science, with a year range of 2011 to
2015. Original articles and reviews were
included, and letters, editorial material,
and corrections were excluded. The country
of the corresponding author's institution
was considered the source nation.8,9
The number of articles and number of
citations were used as the quantity and
quality indicator, respectively, of scientific
production. Countries were classified into
high-, upper-middle-, lower-middle-, and
low-income countries based on the categories
set by World Bank.12 The gross national
income per capita was used to determine the
income levels. An income of $12,736 or more
was classified as high income, $4126 to
$12,735 as upper-middle income, $1046 to
$4125 as lower-middle income, and $1045
or less as low income.12
Countries with 1% publications were
considered the main prolific countries. The
following data were collected: the total
number of papers, the number of papers
per capita, the total number of citations, and
the mean number of citations. The Central
Intelligence Agency was used to gather the
populations of different countries.13 The
number of articles published in the top five
journals from the top five countries and the
number of articles published from the top
five countries in the top five journals were
also collected.
SPSS (version 19.0; IBM Corp., Armonk,
NY) was used for all statistical tests.
A P value of < 0.05 was considered to
indicate statistical significance. Significant
changes in the number of articles over time
were analyzed using regression analysis.
Spearman's test was used to analyze
correlations.
Results
In total, 11,590 papers were identified from
2011 to 2015. The number of yearly publi-
cations significantly increased from 2011
to 2015 (P ¼ 0.010) (Figure 1). A total of
76 countries contributed these publications
worldwide. A world map of global produc-
tion is shown in Figure 2. It indicates that
North America, East Asia, and West Europe
were the most prolific regions. High-income
countries had 10,258 publications (88.51%),
upper-middle-income countries had 1170
articles (10.09%), lower-middle-income
countries had 161 publications (1.39%),
and low-income countries had only 1 article
(0.01%).
Eighteen main prolific countries pub-
lished 90.41% (10,478/11,590) of the
papers (Table 1). Most of these were high-
income countries (n ¼ 15); the 4th and 15th
countries (China and Turkey, respectively)
were upper-middle-income countries, and
the 17th country (India) was one of the
898 Journal of International Medical Research 45(3)
lower-middle-income countries. The top five
countries were the United States (3664/
11,590; 31.61%), the United Kingdom (1072/
11,590; 9.25%), Germany (876/11,590;
7.56%), China (724/11,590; 6.25%), and
Canada (593/11,590; 5.12%) (Table 2). The
United States ranked first in the total
number of citations (27,166), followed by

the United Kingdom (7710) and Canada
(5281). Sweden ranked first in the mean
number of citations (11.45), followed by
Denmark (9.67) and Canada (8.91).
Denmark had the most papers per capita
(35.65), followed by Switzerland (26.35) and
the Netherlands (19.12).
The Journal of Arthroplasty was the most
prevalent journal in three of the top five
countries (United States, China, and
Canada); Knee was the most prevalent jour-

Discussion
Due to worldwide contributions, the field of
knee arthroplasty has shown great improve-
ments in recent years.2­4 The present study
proved that the United States had far more
knee arthroplasty publications than other
countries. Generally speaking, the United
States has been the most prolific country in
multiple medical fields for many decades.7­11
Moreover, the United States had the highest
overall number of citations and highest
mean number of citations in the present
study. This suggests that the United States
not only published a large quantity of
articles in knee arthroplasty, but also high-
quality publications in this field. Even with
its high population, the United States
remains one of the top countries with respect
to the number of publications per capita.
Therefore, the United States was the most
prolific country in knee arthroplasty
research worldwide.
In terms of the countries' contributions, a
``10/90'' divide has been reported when
describing the ratio of non-high-income
versus high-income countries14; this has
been proven in multiple fields.7­11 A similar
result was found in the present study. China,
Turkey, and India, three of the main prolific
countries, have played increasingly important
roles in scientific production worldwide.7­11
This may reflect their rapid economic
growth.15,16 However, only one article was
published among the low-income countries,
indicating the lack of knee arthroplasty
research in these countries. Insufficient finan-
cial support, a lack of experienced research-
ers, and low-level medical care may be
responsible for this phenomenon.14,16
When adjusted by population, some
European countries, including Denmark,
Switzerland, and the Netherlands, ranked
higher. Moreover, some European coun-
tries, such as Sweden and Denmark, were
also the top countries according to the mean
number of citations. These results may
indicate that some smaller European coun-
tries not only have a relatively high output
of publications in knee arthroplasty research

but also publish relatively high-quality art-
icles. Although China, Turkey, and India
were three of the most prolific countries,
their per-capita numbers of publications
were rather small. This may indicate that
their outputs are relatively low, and further
improvement should be encouraged.
The United States was the most prolific
country in the Journal of Arthroplasty and
Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research,
and these were also the two most prevalent
journals in the United States. In fact, they
are issued in the United States. More articles
may be submitted by authors in the United
States than by authors in other countries.
Similar findings were also demonstrated in
the other three top journals in the present
study.
This study had some limitations. First,
only Web of Science was used to identify
reports on knee arthroplasty. Papers from
journals outside Web of Science were
excluded despite their contributions to
global scientific production. Second, with
respect to the mean number of citations, it is
more reasonable to normalize the citations
by the number of researchers instead of the
overall population. In fact, it may be impos-
sible to obtain the number of knee arthro-
plasty researchers in each country. Third,
this was a cross-sectional survey at one time
point. The number of articles from each
country may have been different if the study
had been conducted at another time point.
Fourth, it was difficult to distinguish articles
focusing on knee arthroplasty from those
that only mentioned or tangentially
addressed it. Nevertheless, this study still
provides a comprehensive survey of knee
arthroplasty research and may therefore be
used to track overall trends.
Conclusion
A significant increase in knee arthroplasty
publications was observed from 2011 to 2015.
The United States was the most prolific
country in knee arthroplasty. When popula-
tion size was considered, some European
countries may have been more prolific.
