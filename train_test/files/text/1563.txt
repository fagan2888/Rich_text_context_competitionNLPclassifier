United States: 2003­2004 National Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey (NHANES)1,2
Rosemary L Schleicher, Margaret D Carroll, Earl S Ford, and David A Lacher
ABSTRACT
Background: Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) may be the most important
water-soluble antioxidant in human plasma. In the third National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III, 1988­
1994), '13% of the US population was vitamin C deficient (serum
concentrations ,11.4 lmol/L).
Objective: The aim was to determine the most current distribution
of serum vitamin C concentrations in the United States and the
prevalence of deficiency in selected subgroups.
Design: Serum concentrations of total vitamin C were measured
in 7277 noninstitutionalized civilians aged 6 y during the cross-
sectional, nationally representative NHANES 2003­2004. The prev-
alence of deficiency was compared with results from NHANES III.
Results: The overall age-adjusted mean from the square-root trans-
formed (SM) concentration was 51.4 lmol/L (95% CI: 48.4, 54.6).
The highest concentrations were found in children and older per-
sons. Within each race-ethnic group, women had higher concentra-
tions than did men (P , 0.05). Mean concentrations of adult
smokers were one-third lower than those of nonsmokers (SM:
35.2 compared with 50.7 lmol/L and 38.6 compared with 58.0
lmol/L in men and women, respectively). The overall prevalence
(6SE) of age-adjusted vitamin C deficiency was 7.1 6 0.9%. Mean
vitamin C concentrations increased (P , 0.05) and the prevalence
of vitamin C deficiency decreased (P , 0.01) with increasing so-
cioeconomic status. Recent vitamin C supplement use or adequate
dietary intake decreased the risk of vitamin C deficiency (P , 0.05).
Conclusions: In NHANES 2003­2004, vitamin C status improved,
and the prevalence of vitamin C deficiency was significantly lower
than that during NHANES III, but smokers and low-income persons
were among those at increased risk of deficiency. Am J Clin

INTRODUCTION
Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) is an indispensable cofactor in the
hydroxylation of proline and lysine, and it is essential to collagen
synthesis and connective tissue integrity. Vitamin C functions as
a reducing agent in hydroxylation reactions catalyzed by dopamine
b-monooxygenase and peptidyl glycine a-amidating mono-
oxygenase (1). It plays an important role in increasing the content
of endothelial cell tetrahydrobiopterin and thereby increasing the
activity of nitric oxide synthase (2). It is involved in the bio-
synthesis of carnitine, histamine, and several adrenal steroids; it
promotes iron absorption and mobilization; and it functions in
tyrosine, folate, and xenobiotic metabolism. When intake of vi-
tamin C is below a critical amount (10 mg/d) for prolonged pe-
riods, failure of wounds to heal, petechial hemorrhages, follicular
hyperkeratosis, bleeding gums, and related abnormalities ensue in
a condition known as scurvy (3). Manifest scurvy has rarely been
reported in the United States during the past 30 y (4). Latent
scurvy characterized by fatigue, irritability, vague, dull aching
pains, and weight loss (5) may be underreported because it is not
recognized as such.
Although epidemiologic evidence suggests that vitamin C­
rich foods play a protective role against development of cancers
of the mouth, larynx, esophagus, and stomach (6­8), intervention
studies that used supplements have not shown protective effects
(9­11). Similarly, epidemiologic studies suggest a lower risk of
coronary heart disease associated with higher intakes of fruit,
vegetables, and whole grains (12­14); however, prospective studies
relating cardiovascular disease with the intake of vitamin C or
serum concentrations have provided mixed results (15, 16).
Studies involving food or supplements or both have shown
mixed results for the effects of vitamin C on oxidative damage to
the eye, hypothesized to be part of the pathogenesis of cataract
and macular degeneration. The Age-Related Eye Disease Study
(AREDS), a large randomized trial, showed no benefit of 500 mg
vitamin C/d (together with vitamin E, b-carotene, and zinc) on
the development or progression of cataracts (17). However, two-
thirds of the study participants were taking multivitamins con-
taining vitamin C; thus, a treatment effect may have been dif-
ficult to discern (18). A 5-y prospective study in Japan that
included .700 cases of newly diagnosed cataract found that
higher vitamin C intake (dietary and supplemental) was asso-
ciated with reduced incidence of age-related cataracts (19).
Fewer studies have tested the ability of vitamin C to delay or
retard the progression of macular degeneration. In the AREDS trial,

The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES) 2003­2004 is part of the continuous annual survey
conducted by the National Center for Health Statistics, Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention. It provides important in-
formation about the consumption of selected nutrients by pro-
viding nutritional biomarker measurements. This report presents
the first nationally representative data for serum vitamin C since
NHANES III (1988­1994) (20) and compares the prevalence of
vitamin C deficiency in the 2 survey periods.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS
Subjects
NHANES2003­2004wasacomplex,multistage,areaprobability
samplethatwasrepresentativeoftheUSnoninstitutionalizedcivilian
population during 2003­2004. Data collection consisted of 3 phases:
1) a screening visit during which sample persons were identified, 2)
an interview during which a wide battery of health-related questions
were asked, and 3) an examination consisting of direct standardized
physical examinations, including body measurements and blood and
urine collections, performed in a mobile examination center (MEC).
Oversampling was done for elderly individuals, adolescents, preg-
nant women, Mexican Americans, African Americans, and, begin-
ning in the year 2000, low-income non-Hispanic white persons.
Further information on the NHANES survey is available elsewhere
(21). The NHANES 2003­2004 sample included 10,791 persons
aged 6 y, 8378 of whom were interviewed (77.6%) and 7982 of
whom were interviewed and examined (74.0%). Approximately 9%
(n = 705) of all examined persons had missing data on serum
vitamin C. The NHANES 2003­2004 sample included 6916
persons aged 20 y, 5041 of whom were interviewed (72.9%) and
4742 of whom were interviewed and examined (68.6%). Approxi-
mately6%(n=304)ofexaminedadultsaged20yhadmissingdata
on serum vitamin C in NHANES 2003­2004.
NHANES III, also a complex, multistage, area probability
sample representative of the US noninstitutionalized civilian
population, was conducted from 1988 to 1994. The NHANES III
sample included 30,930 persons aged 6 y, 25,733 of
whom were interviewed (83.2%) and 23,070 of whom were
interviewed and examined (74.6%) in the MEC. Of these, 11%
(n = 2434) had missing serum concentrations of vitamin C. The
NHANES III sample included 23,258 persons aged 20 y,
18,825 of whom were interviewed (81.0%) and 16,573 of whom
were interviewed and examined (71.0%) in the MEC. Of these,
9% (n = 1388) had missing serum concentrations of vitamin C.
Details of the NHANES III survey design (22, 23) and vitamin C
results for persons 12­74 y of age (20) have been published
previously. For most analyses, adults aged 20 y, excluding
children and adolescents, were considered because younger
persons tended to have better vitamin C status than adults.
Design and data collection
Laboratory methods
In NHANES 2003­2004, 7277 persons aged 6 y and 4438
adults aged 20 y and in NHANES III 20636 persons aged 6 y
and 15,185 adults aged 20 y had total serum concentrations of
ascorbic acid (oxidized and reduced) measured. Within 30 min
of separation from the clot, one part serum was treated with 4
parts of 6% metaphosphoric acid in the MEC. The stabilized
serum samples were stored frozen, then shipped to the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta where they were
stored at 270°C until tested. An isocratic reverse-phase HPLC
method with electrochemical detection of ascorbic acid was
used for NHANES 2003­2004 (24); a similar method was used
for NHANES III (25). The analytic method used for NHANES
2003­2004 differed from the one used for NHANES III in 2
important ways. For 2003­2004, but not for NHANES III, cal-
ibrators were treated as samples in the assay, ie, subjected to the
same sample preparation steps. Similarly, an internal standard
was used in all sample preparations to correct results for re-
covery for NHANES 2003­2004 but not for NHANES III. For
both survey periods, 3 levels of bench quality controls, and
2 levels of blind quality controls, were incorporated into each
assay. In addition, the laboratory participated in semiannual
exercises sponsored by the National Institute of Standards and
Technology (NIST; Gaithersburg, MD) for quality assurance for
vitamin C analysis (26).
Historical quality assurance data were compared to assess
differences in serum vitamin C assay precision with the use of the
2 assay methods. NHANES III bench quality control (QC) data
for 3 pools, ranging in concentration from 21.0 to 88.6 lmol/L,
had CVs between 5% and 8%. Similarly, during NHANES
2003­2004, 3 bench QC pools, ranging from 13.6 to 122.7
lmol/L, had CVs from 5% to 9%. Blind QC pools (1 in every
20 samples, unknown to analyst, labeled with unique specimen
identification numbers) used in NHANES III ranged in con-
centration from 5.1 to 48.9 lmol/L and had CVs from 51% to
74%. In NHANES 2003­2004, the blind QC pool concentrations
ranged from 13.1 to 92.1 lmol/L and had CVs of 5­9%. Split
sample data (unknown to the laboratory; n = 151 pairs of split
specimens, labeled with different specimen identification num-
bers) collected during the 6-y course of NHANES III showed an
average paired difference CVof 35%. Split sample data were not
collected for vitamin C during NHANES 2003­2004. A com-
parison of the accuracy of methods was made with the use of
NIST standard reference materials (2 levels of SRM 970), which
were analyzed in 13­14 assays per method over a period of 2 y
between survey periods while the new method was being vali-
dated. With the use of the NHANES III assay method, values
were 92­93% of target values compared with 100­102% of
target values with the NHANES 2003­2004 method (24).
With the use of 308 convenience specimens, the average bias
between assay methods was 2.6% with the NHANES 2003­2004
method, giving higher values than the NHANES III method (24);
however, the bias was concentration dependent with less bias at
lower concentrations. For comparison with NHANES 2003­
2004, NHANES III data were adjusted with the use of a Deming
regression equation, where the adjusted values (y) = 1.0566
(original NHANES III) 2 1.9345 lmol/L (24).
Variables
Important correlates of vitamin C concentrations presented in
this study include sex, age, race-ethnicity, smoking status, adi-
posity, socioeconomic status, vitamin C supplement use derived

from a home interview, and dietary intake. Smoking status and
adiposity were measured; all other correlates were self-reported.
Smoking status
An assessment of tobacco product exposure was based on the
measurement of serum cotinine, the primary proximate metab-
olite of nicotine (27, 28). Serum cotinine was measured with the
use of a liquid chromatography atmospheric-pressure chemical
ionization tandem mass spectrometry procedure (28). Previous
studies established that ,2% of self-reported tobacco users have
serum cotinine concentrations ,10­15 ng/mL (27); thus, in-
dividuals with concentrations .10 ng/mL cutoff were classified
as "smokers" and all others were considered "nonsmokers."
For subjects aged 20 y, serum cotinine data from 4434 and
15,053 subjects were available from NHANES 2003­2004 and
NHANES III, respectively.
Body mass index
Adiposity of adults 20 y was assessed with the use of body
mass index (BMI; kg/m2). In both surveys, height and weight
were measured by trained interviewers with the use of stan-
dardized protocols and calibrated equipment. Adults were
classified as being obese (BMI 30), overweight (BMI of 25­
29.9), or healthy weight (BMI of 18.5­24.9) (29). Pregnant fe-
males, as determined by a combination of self-report and urinary
chorionic gonadotropin, were excluded from the BMI data
analysis. Results for underweight adults (BMI ,18.5) were not
presented because the sample sizes were too small to produce
statistically reliable results.
Socioeconomic status
Income status was defined with the use of the poverty-income
ratio (PIR), which is calculated by dividing family income by
a poverty threshold that is specific for family size. This measure
of income has the advantage of being relatively stable over time,
thus enabling comparisons of PIR groups between NHANES III
and NHANES 2003­2004. Low, medium, and high incomes were
defined as PIR ,1, 1 to ,3, and 3, respectively. PIR values ,1
are below the official poverty threshold, whereas PIR values of
1 indicate income at or above the poverty level (30). Of the
4438 adults in NHANES 2003­2004, data from 4195 (94.5%)
contained information on PIR; of the 15,185 adults in NHANES
III, 13,779 (90.7%) had information on PIR.
Vitamin C supplement use
For NHANES 2003­2004 and NHANES III, information
pertaining to the use of nutritional supplements was obtained
during the home interview for persons aged 20 y. In 2003­
2004, the question posed was as follows: "Have you used or
taken any vitamins, minerals, or other dietary supplements in the
past 30 days? Include prescription and nonprescription supple-
ments." In NHANES III, during the household interview, re-
spondents were asked "Have you taken any vitamins or minerals
during the past month? Please include those that are prescribed
by a doctor and those that are not prescribed." In both surveys
those who answered affirmatively were asked to show the in-
terviewer the contents of all vitamin and mineral supplements.
The interviewer then recorded whether any vitamin C­containing
supplements were present. More than 99% of respondents in-
dicated yes or no to a question about vitamin-mineral supplement
use in each survey.
Dietary intake of vitamin C
Daily intake of vitamin C less than the Estimated Average
Requirement (EAR) was calculated for adults 20 y based on
current recommendations (31) with the use of a single 24-h
dietary recall. For women, EAR values are 60 mg/d for non-
smokers and 95 mg/d for smokers; for men, EAR values are
75 mg/d for nonsmokers and 110 mg/d for smokers. Pregnant
and lactating women have specifically higher values, namely
70 mg/d for pregnant nonsmokers, 105 mg/d for pregnant
smokers, 100 mg/d for lactating nonsmokers, and 135 mg/d for
lactating smokers. Estimates of dietary intake of vitamin C were
available from 95% and 97% of subjects from NHANES 2003­
2004 and NHANES III, respectively.
Statistical methods
Because the distribution of serum vitamin C data was highly
skewed, a transformation was needed to approximate a Gaussian
distribution to construct CIs and to test statistical hypotheses (32,
33). The square root transformation optimally improved the data
distribution. Estimates of the mean with the use of the square root
transformation; 5th, 10th, 25th, 50th (or median), 75th, 90th, and
95th percentiles; and percentage (and SE) of deficient persons
(vitamin C , 11.4 lmol/L) are presented for persons aged 6 y
and for persons aged 20 y. Sample weights, which account for
unequal probability of selection and adjust for nonresponse and
noncoverage, were incorporated in estimating means, percen-
tiles, percentages, and their standard errors to obtain unbiased
estimates. Standard errors were estimated with the Taylor Series
Linearization, a design-based approach (32).
CIs were constructed for the mean vitamin C square root
transformed and the percentage of persons with vitamin C de-
ficiency. The CIs for mean vitamin C square root transformed were
constructed on the square root scale with Wald's method (34) and
then back-transformed. Because the percentage with vitamin C
,11.4 lmol/L in most subgroups was relatively small, ranging
from 1.0% to 18.0% for NHANES 2003­2004 and from 1.8% to
31.3% for NHANES III, CIs for these percentages were con-
structed with the arc-sine transformation (32). NHANES III an-
alytic guidelines (23) were used to assess the stability of the
percentiles. Minimum sample size needed to present estimated
percentiles are a function of the design effect that measures the
effect of the complex sample design on the variance estimate and
is defined as the ratio of the design-based variance to the variance
of a simple random sample of the same size.
Means of vitamin C concentrations (square root transformed)
and percentage of persons with vitamin C concentrations , 11.4
lmol/L for those aged 6 y and those aged 20 y were age
adjusted by the direct method with the use of the projected US
Census population estimates from the year 2000 (35). No dis-
cernible bias in serum vitamin C was found because of non-
response on the basis of age, sex, race-ethnicity, cotinine, BMI,
vitamin C supplement use, or dietary intake of vitamin C in
either survey period (data not shown).
The data are presented 1) by sex cross-classified by age
groups (6­11 y, 12­19 y, 20­39 y, 40­59 y, and 60 y) and 2) by
sex cross-classified by race-ethnicity (non-Hispanic white, non-

Hispanic black, Mexican American), smoking status (smoker,
nonsmoker), and BMI category (healthy weight, overweight,
obese), socioeconomic status (low, medium, high), vitamin C
supplement use (any, none), and 1-d dietary intake of vitamin C
compared with the EAR (less than EAR or greater than or equal
to EAR) for both survey periods (1988­1994, 2003­2004). To
determine whether stratification was needed in the analysis of
mean vitamin C and the percentage of persons with deficient
concentrations of vitamin C, we tested for the presence of
2-factor interactions of sex with age group, race-ethnicity, smok-
ing status, BMI, income, vitamin C supplement use, and dietary
intake. For NHANES 2003­2004, we showed the existence of
interactions between sex and age group for mean serum con-
centrations of vitamin C (P , 0.001) and percentage of persons
who were vitamin C deficient (P , 0.01). An interaction was
also observed between sex and race-ethnicity for mean con-
centrations of vitamin C (P = 0.046). No other 2-factor inter-
actions were significant (P . 0.05).
Equality of means or equality of percentages was tested
univariately at the a = 0.05 level with the Student's t statistic
(33). The equality of .2 subgroups was tested simultaneously.
If the hypothesis that the means or percentages of all subgroups
were equal was rejected, pairwise tests were performed applying
the Bonferroni method (36) to control for multiple comparisons.
To test for linear and quadratic trends in age and income level,
the null hypothesis of no linear or quadratic trend was examined
with orthogonal contrast matrices (37). Rejection of this hy-
pothesis implied the existence of a linear or quadratic trend. To
investigate the odds ratio for vitamin C deficiency in smokers
and nonsmokers during 2 survey periods while controlling for
possible confounding variables, a multiple logistic regression
analysis was performed. Odds ratios having a 95% CI not in-
cluding unity were considered significant. We investigated the
odds ratios of supplement users and nonusers in a similar
manner. The hypothesis that the odds ratio was equal to unity
was tested by testing the equivalent hypothesis that the log of the
odds ratio was equal to 0.
SAS 9.1 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) and SUDAAN 10.0 (RTI,
Research Triangle Park, NC) were used to construct CIs for the
means and percentages, to model odds ratios for vitamin C
deficiency among smokers and vitamin C supplement users
(SUDAAN, PROC RLOGIST), and to test statistical hypotheses.
Unless specified otherwise, data are presented as back-
transformed weighted square root transformed mean with 95%
CI. Serum vitamin C is indicated in lmol/L. To convert lmol/L
to mg/dL, multiply lmol/L by 0.0176.
RESULTS
Age and sex
Marked age-related differences in mean concentrations of
vitamin C were evident in the US population and showed
a significant quadratic trend in males (P , 0.001) and females
(P , 0.001) (Table 1). Boys 6­11 y of age had the highest mean
serum concentrations of any male age group. Similarly, girls
6­11 y of age had the highest mean serum concentrations of any
female age group. Both sexes showed a decline in mean con-
centrations during adolescence (P , 0.001). In males, mean
values continued to decline from 12­19 to 20­29 y (P , 0.001)
to a plateau between the ages of 20 and 59 y (P = 0.546) and
then increased with advancing age (P , 0.001). In females, the
age pattern was somewhat different. Serum vitamin C decreased
linearly from a high point at 6­11 y of age to a low at 20­39 y of
age (P , 0.001) and then increased to 60 y of age. Females
12 y of age had significantly higher mean concentrations of
vitamin C than did their male counterparts. Selected percentile
data (5th, 10th, 25th, 50th, 75th, 90th, and 95th) for each age
group are presented in Table 1.
Race-ethnicity and sex
With the comparison of sexes, women had higher mean
concentrations of vitamin C than did men in each of the 3 race-
ethnic groups (Table 1). Within sex but stratified by race-ethnic
group, no significant differences were observed in mean con-
centrations of vitamin C among men of different race-ethnicity,
but among women of different race-ethnicity, non-Hispanic white
women had significantly higher mean concentrations than did
non-Hispanic black women. Selected percentile data for each sex
stratified by race-ethnicity are shown in Table 1.
Smoking
The mean serum concentration of vitamin C of all smokers was
33% lower than that of all nonsmokers (data not shown). Men
who smoked had mean serum concentrations of vitamin C that
were 31% lower than nonsmoking men, whereas women smokers
had concentrations that were 33% lower than nonsmoking
women (Table 2). Selected percentile data for each smoking
status group stratified by sex are shown in Table 2.
Body mass index
Mean serum vitamin C was significantly lower in obese men than
in overweight men (15% lower) but not significantly different
between overweight and healthy-weight men (Table 2). For women,
mean vitamin C was significantly lower in obese than in overweight
(15% lower) or healthy-weight (25% lower) women. Selected
percentile data for each BMI category are shown in Table 2.
Socioeconomic status
In men and in women, mean vitamin C increased linearly with
increasing PIR (Table 2). In men, vitamin C concentrations were
significantly higher in high compared with low PIR groups (33%
higher). In women, vitamin C concentrations were significantly
higher in medium compared with low PIR (20% higher), high
compared with medium PIR (14% higher), and high compared
with low PIR (37% higher) groups. Selected percentile data for
each PIR category are shown in Table 2.
Vitamin C supplement use
Mean serum concentrations of vitamin C in different age
groups in vitamin C supplement users and nonusers are shown in
Figure 1. The quadratic age trends in mean concentrations of
vitamin C seen in all males and females were retained when the
data were stratified by supplement usage (P for trend , 0.001).
Among nonusers, boys had significantly higher means than did
girls (P , 0.01); however, in age groups 12 y, female nonusers

had significantly higher mean concentrations than did male
nonusers (Figure 1). Among users, women aged 60 y had
significantly higher means than did men aged 60 y older (P ,
0.001). In those adults aged 20 y for whom serum vitamin C
measurements were available, 37% of men and 47% of women
reported consuming one or more vitamin C­containing supple-
ment in the past 30 d (Table 3). Vitamin C supplement users had
significantly higher mean serum concentrations of vitamin C
than did nonusers of vitamin C supplements. Selected percen-
tiles of serum concentrations of vitamin C are presented by sex
and use of vitamin C supplements in Table 3.
Dietary intake of vitamin C
Among adults aged 20 y who had serum measurements of
vitamin C available, 60% of adult men and 53% of adult women
reported dietary intake of vitamin C less than the EAR. Men and
women with vitamin C intakes greater than or equal to the EAR
on the day before examination had significantly higher mean
concentrations of vitamin C than did their counterparts whose
vitamin C intake was less than the EAR (Table 3). Within each
vitamin C dietary intake group, mean serum vitamin C con-
centrations of women were higher than those of men.
Vitamin C deficiency in NHANES 2003­2004
A serum concentration ,11.4 lmol/L is considered to be
indicative of vitamin C deficiency at which time clinical features
of manifest scurvy may be seen (38). Of the total population
in NHANES 2003­2004, 7.1 6 0.9% (6SE) were deficient
(Table 4). Only a small percentage of 6­11-y-old participants
(,2%) and relatively few adolescents (,4%) were deficient. A

20­39 and 60 y had a significantly higher prevalence of vi-
tamin C deficiency than did women in these age groups (Table
4). The prevalence of deficiency did not differ by race-ethnic
group; however, men in each race-ethnic group were signifi-
cantly more likely to be vitamin C deficient than were women in
the same race-ethnic group (Table 4).
The percentage of adults with deficient concentrations of vi-
tamin C in NHANES 2003­2004 was markedly higher among
smokers than among nonsmokers (Table 5). Smokers were at
risk of deficiency .3 times as often as nonsmokers. In adults,
BMI was not related to the prevalence of vitamin C deficiency
(Table 5). The percentage of men and women with vitamin C
deficiency decreased linearly with increasing PIR (Table 5). The
prevalence of vitamin C deficiency was higher in low-income
(17.4%) compared with the high-income (7.9%) men and in
low-income (10.4%) compared with high-income (5.0%)
women.
Adults who were nonusers of vitamin C supplements had
a significantly higher prevalence of vitamin C deficiency than did
users (Table 6). The prevalence of vitamin C deficiency among
nonusers of vitamin C supplements was higher in men and in
women. Adults with vitamin C intake less than the EAR had
a significantly higher prevalence of vitamin C deficiency than
did adults with vitamin C intake greater than or equal to the

EAR. Among adults with vitamin C intakes greater than or equal
to the EAR, the prevalence of vitamin C deficiency was higher
in men than in women (Table 6).
Serum concentrations of vitamin C ,20 lmol/L may be as-
sociated with fatigue and irritability (40). In NHANES 2003­
2004, the age-adjusted prevalence (6SE) of persons 6 y of age
with concentrations below this cutoff was 13.7 6 1.5%, whereas
the age-adjusted prevalence (6SE) of adults 20 y with con-
centrations below this cutoff was 15.7 6 1.6%. Persons with
serum vitamin C concentrations , 28 lmol/L are at moderate
risk of developing vitamin C deficiency (41). The age-adjusted
prevalence (6SE) of persons 6 y of age with concentrations ,
28 lmol/L was 19.6 6 1.9%, whereas the age-adjusted preva-
lence of adults 20 y with concentrations below this cutoff was
22.2 6 2.1%.
Comparison of vitamin C status in NHANES 2003­2004
and 1988­1994
Comparison of NHANES 2003­2004 with NHANES III
(1988­1994) was undertaken to determine whether serum vita-
min C deficiency in the US population had significantly changed.
In NHANES 2003­2004, the overall prevalence decreased 44%.
The age-related prevalence of deficiency rates for the 2 surveys
was parallel; deficiency rates were low in children, climbed to
peak at middle age, and fell in the older age groups (quadratic
trend in both males and females, P , 0.001).
The prevalence of vitamin C deficiency in all adults aged
20 y stratified by race-ethnicity in NHANES III was 14.7% in
non-Hispanic whites, 21.9% in non-Hispanic blacks, and 14.2%
in Mexican Americans; these are in contrast to lower prevalence
rates of 10.0%, 6.7%, and 5.9%, respectively in 2003­2004.
When stratified by sex, vitamin C deficiency significantly de-
creased in all 3 race-ethnic groups [non-Hispanic blacks (67­
73% decrease), Mexican Americans (56­62% decrease), and
non-Hispanic whites (32­33% decrease); Table 4].
In both surveys, smokers had a higher prevalence of vitamin C
deficiency than did nonsmokers (Table 5). However, in NHANES
2003­2004 the prevalence of vitamin C deficiency among all
smokers declined significantly compared with NHANES III (41­
42% decrease); nonsmokers showed a similar improvement (42­
44% decrease). The significant association of smoking status and
vitamin C deficiency persisted after controlling for the possible
confounding effects of sex, age, race-ethnicity, BMI, income, use
of vitamin C­containing supplements, dietary intake of vitamin C,
and survey (odds ratio: 3.76; 95% CI: 3.08, 4.59; P , 0.001).
Despite a decline, smokers remained the subgroup most at risk
of vitamin C deficiency (Table 5). Significant declines in the
prevalence of vitamin C deficiency in 2003­2004 were observed
in most BMI-related categories except for obese men who had
the smallest improvement in vitamin C deficiency (22% decrease)
of any subgroup (Table 5). In low and medium income but not
high income groups, the prevalence of vitamin C deficiency de-
clined between surveys in all 3 income groups (34­49%; Table 5).
Comparing the prevalence of vitamin C deficiency in the 2
surveys by vitamin C supplement use, an improvement was
observed within each of the 4 sex-by-vitamin C supplement use
groups (Table 6). The low prevalence of deficiency in vitamin C
supplement users in NHANES III was further reduced by 60­
62% in NHANES 2003­2004. The significant association of
vitamin C supplement use and low risk of vitamin C deficiency
persisted after controlling for the possible confounding effects of
sex, age, race-ethnicity, BMI, PIR, smoking status, dietary intake
of vitamin C, and survey (odds ratio: 5.21; 95% CI: 3.98, 6.83;
P , 0.001). In both categories of dietary intake, vitamin C status
improved in NHANES 2003­2004 compared with NHANES III
(Table 6). Women whose dietary intake of vitamin C was greater
than or equal to the EAR were the least likely of any subgroup to
be vitamin C deficient and showed the greatest improvement in
status since NHANES III (80% decrease in deficiency).
DISCUSSION
Data on serum vitamin C from the nationally representative
NHANES 2003­2004 survey show that the vitamin C status
improved in the US population since 1988­1994. In virtually all
subgroups explored in this analysis, fewer persons were cate-
gorized as deficient, and most differences were significant. The
race-ethnic differences in the prevalence of vitamin C deficiency
seen in NHANES III were no longer apparent in the 2003­2004
survey period. The magnitude of the improvement (56­73%) was
striking for minority groups. Although non-Hispanic black
women had significantly lower mean concentrations than did
non-Hispanic white women in NHANES 2003­2004, the prev-
alence of deficiency was not lower, a suggestion that there are
different distributions of values in the 2 groups of women. Each
of the 3 race-ethnic groups showed a significant sex difference in
serum concentrations of vitamin C in NHANES 2003­2004.
Higher concentrations in females have been observed in other
studies in the United States (20, 42) and Europe (43­45), al-
though not noted in an Asian population (46). The inverse relation
between BMI and serum concentrations of vitamin C seen in
NHANES 2003­2004 had been noted previously (45, 47). Lower
vitamin C intake and more prevalent vitamin C deficiency among
persons with low income status have been reported in other
populations (48­50).
FIGURE 1. Mean (695% CI) serum concentrations of vitamin C in
selected age groups were stratified by sex and any recent (past 30 d)
intake of vitamin C­containing supplements in the US population during
NHANES 2003­2004. A square root transformation was used to estimate
means. Significant quadratic age trends in mean concentrations of vitamin C
were present in all 4 groups (P , 0.001). Sample sizes for supplement users
and nonusers were as follows: female users (n = 1363; filled square with
solid line); male users (n = 1034; filled diamond with solid line); female
nonusers (n = 2317; open square with dashed line); male nonusers (n = 2550;

On the basis of NHANES serum cotinine data, the prevalence
of adult smoking decreased from 25.5 to 22.7% between 1990
and 1999 (51). Serum cotinine concentrations in nonsmokers
decreased by '70% between 1988 and 2002 (52). Among
smokers, there has been a decrease in cigarette use. From
NHANES III to NHANES 1999­2000, the average number of
cigarettes smoked per day fell by 15%, and mean serum cotinine
fell in smokers by 13% (53). Since NHANES III, many com-
munities have banned smoking in public places and conse-
quently reduced passive exposure to secondhand smoke (52).
Thus, it seems likely that a reduction in smoke exposure in
smokers and nonsmokers alike may account in part for the im-
provement in vitamin C concentrations in the population during
2003­2004.
The relation between serum concentration of vitamin C and
age in the US population is complex and nonlinear. This relation
appears to be different from country to country, depending on
such factors as the availability of fruit and vegetables, socio-
economic levels, and supplement usage (48, 54). Fruit and
vegetable consumption among American adults remained rela-
tively stable from 1994 through 2005 (55). For example, average
daily fruit intake in persons 2 y of age remained the same from
1994­1996 to 1999­2002 (1.6 servings), and average vegetable
consumption declined slightly from 3.4 to 3.2 servings/d during
the same period (56). Increased intake of vitamin C­containing
foods was unlikely to have contributed to the reduced prevalence
of vitamin C deficiency during the recent survey. Mean 1-d in-
takes of vitamin C from food in those aged 12 y ranged from
91 to 125 mg during NHANES III (20), whereas in NHANES
2003­2004, mean 1-d intakes were slightly lower, ranging from
80 to 116 mg (57). In our analysis of NHANES 2003­2004,
more than one-half the adults who had vitamin C measurements
available had a 1-d dietary intake less than the EAR, and those
with intake less than the EAR had serum concentrations of vi-
tamin C that were approximately one-third lower than those with
adequate dietary intake, and they were 5­10 times more likely to
be vitamin C deficient. It should be noted that the dietary intake
data were from a single 24-h dietary recall and thus may not
provide the best estimate of usual dietary intake.
In prosperous societies, supplement consumption has a sig-
nificant effect on body stores and circulating concentrations of
vitamin C. In NHANES 1999­2000, 52% of adults reported
consumption of supplements in the past month, and 35% of adults
were regular users of multivitamins (58). Usage rates in children
were similar but lower in adolescents. These recent data show
increased usage since the overall 40% usage reported during
NHANES III (58) and are likely to explain in part the improved
vitamin C status of the US population. In NHANES 2003­2004
for those indicating vitamin C supplement use during the pre-
ceding month, serum concentrations were 57­73% higher than in

nonusers. When the relation between age and vitamin C status
was examined in supplement users and nonusers, older persons
(60 y) had better vitamin C status in part because of supple-
ment use. A frequency analysis of smoking by supplement usage
in this population showed that those aged 60 y who did not use
supplements were more likely to be smokers than those who did
(22% compared with 12%). Smoking accelerates vitamin C
turnover and lowers serum concentrations. Although older
women are more likely to consume fruit and vegetables than
their younger counterparts, accounting for some of the im-
provement in the oldest age group, older men are not (59). Even
so, a substantial minority (10%) of older men and women
consume far less vitamin C than the Recommended Dietary
Allowance through dietary sources (59).
The consequences of vitamin C deficiency in adults range from
petechial hemorrhages, follicular hyperkeratoses with unerupted
corkscrew hairs, anemia, bleeding gums, and loosened teeth to
more subtle changes in mood and affect which might become
apparent before the body is fully depleted. Mild but distinct
fatigue and irritability in the absence of manifest scurvy but
consistent with latent scurvy were reported by 6 of 7 healthy
young men subjected to a vitamin C depletion protocol (60).
Latent scurvy is also characterized by nonspecific symptoms such
as joint and muscle pain (3). A substantial percentage of adults
(16%) in NHANES 2003­2004 had vitamin C concentrations that
are associated with low energy and weakness as a result of in-
adequate intake of vitamin C. More than 20% of adults showed
marginal vitamin C status, placing them at risk of vitamin C
deficiency, similar to the 20­23% estimates in NHANES III (20).
The limitations of the study are several. For the survey
comparison, NHANES III data quality was not as good as
NHANES 2003­2004. Although the main indicators of data

quality (bench QC pools) were acceptable, the blind QC pools
and split sample data were not optimal. For this reason a more
extensive analysis of the mean concentrations of vitamin C in
various subgroups was not undertaken, but rather we limited our
comparison to prevalence of deficiency. To compare surveys it
was necessary to adjust the NHANES III data set to make it
comparable to the NHANES 2003­2004 survey method.
Improvements in the assay were made in the period between the 2
surveys. Consumable supplies were shown to contain materials
that measurably degrade vitamin C within a short period of time
(,24 h) (61). It was suggested that this degradation may occur
in autosampler vials, tubes, and vials used in the collection and
processing of blood and serum samples and that this type of
degradation may account for a substantial amount of the ob-
served interlaboratory variation in NIST-sponsored exercises for
vitamin C measurement. Two features of the assay used for
NHANES 2003­2004 were designed to mitigate effects of oxi-
dation and degradation, namely, use of an internal standard that
partially compensated for procedural losses during the assay and
calibrators that were processed the same as samples such that
both were exposed to similar conditions during the processing
and analysis steps. Overall, '3% of the difference in mean
serum concentrations between survey periods can be explained
by method bias. This amount of bias is considered clinically ac-
ceptable, considering other sources of error in measuring serum
vitamin C such as analytic error (CVA
= 5­9%), within-individual
variation for repeated measurements (CVI
= 26%), and variation
of the group or population for this analyte (CVG
= 31%) (62, 63).
A complication in interpreting vitamin C serum and dietary
intake data, ordinarily considered the sum of intake from fruit,
vegetables, supplements, and fortified foods, is the availability of
D-ascorbic acid, which is used as a preservative in prepared
foods. The HPLC method used in this analysis (and during
NHANES III) does not distinguish between the D- and L-
isomers, which probably do not share full biological activity (1).
A significant amount of D-ascorbate is found in some prepared
foods, particularly cured meats where it is used to shorten
processing time and improve the color.
The strengths of this study are numerous. These results are
from a national survey to measure vitamin C with the use of

a specific and sensitive HPLC method. Estimated prevalence rates
of deficiency are based on serum concentrations of vitamin C, not
from dietary recall. The quality of the NHANES 2003­2004
laboratory data were excellent as judged by all relevant quality
assurance indicators. NHANES focuses on noninstitutionalized
persons, whereas nutritional data in the elderly are often limited
to those who are not community dwelling.
In conclusion, the vitamin C status of the US population
appears to have substantially improved from 1988­1994 to 2003­
2004. Nevertheless, the prevalence of vitamin C deficiency in
various subgroups remains a concern, considering the wide
availability of vitamin C in common fruit and vegetables, as well
as in fortified foods and beverages.
We thank the staff of the Nutritional Biomarkers Branch who worked on
vitamin C testing past and present, including Mary Xu who measured serum
vitamin C concentrations and Huiping Chen who reviewed the data for quality
assurance for the NHANES 2003­2004 survey, and Jaime Gahche for advice
on vitamin C supplements.
The authors' responsibilities were as follows--RLS and DAL: data review;
MDC: statistical analysis; and RLS and MDC: writing of the manuscript. All
authors interpreted data and critically revised the manuscript. None of the
authors had a conflict of interest.
