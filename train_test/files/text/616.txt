enrolment in Ghana across the life course:
Are the results consistent between surveys?

Abstract
Background: Ghana is currently undergoing a profound demographic transition, with large increases in the
number of older adults in the population. Older adults require greater levels of healthcare as illness and disability
increase with age. Ghana therefore provides an important and timely case study of policy implementation aimed at
improving equal access to healthcare in the context of population ageing.
This paper examines the determinants of National Health Insurance (NHIS) enrolment in Ghana, using two different
surveys and distinguishing between younger and older adults. Two surveys are used in order to investigate
consistency in insurance enrolment. The comparison between age groups is aimed at understanding whether
determinants differ for older adults. Previous studies have mainly focused on the enrolment of young and middle
aged adults; thus by widening the focus to include older adults and taking into account differences in their
demographic and socio-economic characteristics this paper provides a unique contribution to the literature.
Methods: Using data from the 2007-2008 Study on Global Ageing and Adult Health (SAGE) and the 2012-2013
Ghanaian Living Standards Survey (GLSS) the determinants of NHIS enrolment among younger adults (aged 18-49) and
older adults (aged 50 and over) are compared. Logistic regression explores the socio-economic and demographic
determinants of NHIS enrolment and multinomial logistic regression investigates the correlates of insurance drop out.
Results: Similar results for people aged 18-49 and people aged 50 plus were revealed, with older adults having a
slightly lower probability of dropping out of insurance coverage compared to younger adults. Both surveys confirm
that education and wealth increase the likelihood of NHIS affiliation. Further, residential differences in insurance
coverage are found, with greater NHIS coverage in urban areas. The findings give assurance that both datasets (SAGE
and GLSS) are suitable for research on insurance affiliation in Ghana.
Conclusion: The paper indicates that although the gap in coverage among rich and poor and urban and rural
residents appears to have decreased, these factors still determine NHIS coverage of younger and older adults. The
same holds for education. Increasing efforts are needed to ensure equal access to healthcare.

Background
Universal Health Coverage (UHC) aims to provide qual-
ity healthcare to all without financial hardship. Efforts to
meet the aim of UHC will be greatly influenced by the
global population ageing phenomenon. Older adults re-
quire greater levels of healthcare due to increasing ill-
ness and disability as ageing occurs, which complicates
progress to UHC. Moreover, older adults in low and
middle-income countries are often left without any regu-
lar income due to a lack of social pensions [1]. Social
protection schemes in low and middle income countries
are vital to the protection of older adults because in
countries without social security systems, it is left to the
individual to finance healthcare expenditures.
Ghana presents a crucial case study for the implementa-
tion of policies aimed at UHC in the context of population
ageing in sub-Saharan Africa. Ghana is currently under-
going a profound demographic transition, with a large
increase in the number of older adults. The percent-
age of people aged 60 and over is estimated to grow
from 5% in 2015 to nearly 10% in 2050 [2]. In 2005
the country implemented a National Health Insurance
Scheme (NHIS), designed to help improve equality of
access to healthcare by offering affordable healthcare
to all.
Prior to 2005, the Ghanaian health system was orga-
nised as a `cash and carry system' with healthcare only
obtained after payment. This was seen as highly inequit-
able and acted as a barrier to individuals getting timely
and necessary treatment [3]. In response, the NHIS was
set up which operates under a vision of being "a model
of a sustainable, progressive and equitable social health
insurance scheme in Africa and beyond" [4] and officially
covers 95% of the common disease burden in its benefit
package. Formally, it is a mandatory system; however, no
penalties apply for not being a member of any health in-
surance scheme in Ghana. Those working in the formal
labour sector subsidise the NHIS through an automatic
payroll deduction [3, 5].
Previous research has been critical of the lack of evi-
dence as to what influences uptake of the NHIS [6]. So
far studies on NHIS enrolment have mainly focused on
young and middle-aged adults, but have neglected to
consider the extent to which these results can be gener-
alised to older adults. For example, each of Blanchet, et
al. [3], Ayitey, et al. [7] and Osei-Akoto and Adamba [5]
examined demographic and socio economic factors
that influence NHIS membership among adults with-
out differentiating older adults from corresponding
younger generations. This paper argues that it is im-
portant to consider younger and older adults separately
due to differences in demographic and socio-economic
characteristics as well as differences in health and dis-
ability status.
It is expected that older adults will make greater use
of the NHIS than younger age groups as older adults are
more vulnerable to disabilities and diseases. The 2010
Ghanaian Census showed that over 9% of older adults
suffer from at least one disability compared to less than
3% of adults aged 18-49 years. Communicable diseases
such as HIV and malaria are the main cause of
disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) until the age of 50,
while for people aged 50 plus non-communicable dis-
eases are the main cause of DALYs [8]. Furthermore,
compared with younger adults, the educational status
among older adults in Ghana is relatively low [9]. These
differences in user characteristics can influence the up-
take of health insurance significantly, which is why it is
important to explore whether the correlates of NHIS en-
rolment differ between younger and older adults.
There is a lack of data focusing on older adults in sub-
Saharan Africa which can explain the scarcity of studies
looking at older adults in the region. Ghana has the ad-
vantage of having two nationally representative surveys
that include a question on insurance coverage and sam-
ple all adults (inducing those aged 50 and over). They
are the World Bank funded Ghanaian Living Standards
Survey (GLSS) and the World Health Organization
(WHO) Study on Global Ageing and Adult Health
(SAGE). However, there are concerns about the reliabil-
ity of different datasets for measuring NHIS enrolment,
bringing into question the possibility of measuring
health insurance coverage in Ghana accurately. Apoya
and Marriott [10] estimated a total NHIS coverage of
only 18% in 2009, while the National Health Insurance
Authority (NHIA) reported a coverage of 62% in the
same year [11]. The GLSS (2012/2013) estimated a
coverage of 51% among people aged 18 and over and the
SAGE (2007/2008) reported that 28% of survey partici-
pants (aged 18 and over) had NHIS coverage.
The objective of this paper is to investigate the corre-
lates of NHIS enrolment, renewal and drop out among
older adults, defined as those aged 50 plus, to assess
whether they differ from younger adults (aged 18-49). In
addition, the paper is particularly interested in examin-
ing whether the correlates of insurance affiliation differ
depending on which survey is used. The correlates of
NHIS coverage among younger and older adults are
assessed using both the GLSS and SAGE. Comparing
different datasets to look for consistency in results, espe-
cially relating to the determinants of enrolment, adds to
the evidence base for the NHIS.
Demand patterns of insurance enrolment will reveal
what factors influence the decision to partake in the
NHIS. Knowledge of who is enrolled in the NHIS and
why others are not provides an understanding as to
whether opportunities to enrol are equal or whether en-
rolment patterns vary depending on socioeconomic

status, sex or residence. For progress to UHC to be
achieved in times of ageing populations, health policies
have to benefit all, inclusive of both younger as well as
older adults [12]. The findings of this paper can be used
by policymakers to implement target-orientated policy
measures to increase enrolment in the NHIS.
Enrolment in the National Health Insurance System
in Ghana
In order to become a member of the NHIS, individuals
first need to register at their local district office, pay a
registration fee and a scaled-to-income premium. The
health insurance membership ID card - which provides
evidence of enrolment and entitles members to free use
of care at accredited facilities - will then be provided for
participants after a waiting period which can take up to
several months [3]. Immediate biometric registration at
selected district offices has been launched only recently
to optimise the enrolment process [13]. The NHIS mem-
bership expires after one year, meaning that each year
members require a renewal of insurance membership to
remain eligible for NHIS benefits.
On reaching 70 years of age, individuals are exempt
from the NHIS premium payment but not from the
registration fee. In addition, individuals who receive a
pension from the Social Security and National Insurance
Trust (SSNIT) are exempt from the NHIS premium
[14]. Other groups that are exempt from paying the pre-
mium include all children under 18 when both of their
parents are enrolled in the NHIS, the `core poor' (de-
fined as those with no regular source of income and no
fixed place of residence), and pregnant women.
Methods
Data
This paper uses two different datasets that aim to be na-
tionally representative and include information on health
insurance coverage in Ghana: the Ghanaian Living Stan-
dards Survey (GLSS) round 6 (2012/13) and the Study on
Global Ageing and Adult Health (SAGE) wave 1 (2007/08).
Round 6 of GLSS interviewed 16,772 households (a re-
sponse rate of over 93%) requesting information on all
household members at all ages. The GLSS collected spe-
cific household level information on expenditure, in-
come, assets and housing conditions as well as detailed
information on household members' socio-demographic
characteristics, health, insurance status and employment.
The SAGE is a longitudinal study with the purpose of
collecting rich and detailed data on older adults. The sur-
vey oversampled individuals that are aged 50 and over,
while a smaller sample of individuals aged 18-49 years was
collected as a control group [15]. A proxy questionnaire
was completed for those individuals who were found to be
unable to complete the questionnaire themselves due to
cognition or health reasons. In the Ghanaian SAGE wave
1, only 17 people were proxy respondents. In total 5,110
individuals were interviewed during the first wave of the
Ghanaian SAGE (response rate 80%).
Measures
Reviewing the literature uncovers a substantial lack of
studies that have examined the determinants of insur-
ance coverage specifically among older adults in sub-
Saharan Africa. Available studies have mainly focused on
younger adults (for example [6, 16], or [17]). Existing
studies informed the choice of key variables that were
considered in the analysis.
Overall life expectancy in Sub-Saharan Africa is still low.
Nine countries in the region still have an average life ex-
pectancy of less than 55 years [18]. Ghana has an average
life expectancy of 62 years and the healthy life expectancy
at birth is 54 years [19]. For the analysis in this paper,
people aged 50 and above were classified as older adults.
It is argued that the commonly used 60 or 65 cut-off point
for defining an individual as an `older adult' is not appro-
priate in the sub-Saharan African context.
The variable age has been transformed from a continu-
ous into a categorical variable in order to control for
changes in the demand for healthcare insurance among
different age groups. Akazili, et al. [17] showed that repro-
ductive age significantly affects NHIS enrolment and van
der Wielen, et al. [20] found that age increases the likeli-
hood of NHIS membership among older adults. Ten year
age intervals were chosen for the analysis (18-29, 30-39,
40-49, 50-59, 60-69, 70+). These categories make theoret-
ical sense, particularly for older adults, as they distinguish
groups that may be differentially treated within the NHIS
through regulations governing exemptions from pay-
ments. Sixty is the official retirement age in Ghana and all
pensioners under the Ghanaian SSNIT Pension Scheme
are exempt from premium payments. Those aged 60-69
years who do not receive pensions and work in the infor-
mal sector are, however, still liable for premium payments
on the NHIS. It is anticipated therefore that due to the ex-
emptions on premiums for people aged 70 plus, a sharp
rise in insurance membership will be observed among
those oldest-old adults.
Furthermore, education can increase awareness and un-
derstanding of the healthcare system and its advantages.
Available literature shows that education positively influ-
ences the likelihood of being a member of the NHIS [7].
The variable education was recoded in a way that is sensi-
tive to key milestones in the Ghanaian education system
[21]. The variable was adjusted for changes in the school
system to ensure that the school system in place when an
older adult went to school was taken into account.
Previous studies reported that living standards determine
insurance coverage in Ghana [5 16], with the poorest being
van der Wielen et al. International Journal for Equity in Health (2018) 17:49 Page 3 of 14
least likely to be enrolled in the NHIS. Living standards are
most commonly measured based on income, expenditure
or consumption. Problems of misreporting and non-
response of income components in surveys [22], as well as
the lack of comparable expenditure data in the two surveys,
make the use of proxy measures of living standards sens-
ible. Information on household assets, which have been col-
lected in both surveys, can be used as a proxy measure of
prosperity [23]. Thus, this paper used consumer items
(such as bicycle, television, and car) and dwelling character-
istics (such as drinking water, type of flooring material, and
sanitation facilities) to measure living standards. In order to
take into account urban and rural differences in the distri-
bution of assets, a wealth index was created over urban and
rural residence using principal component analysis. Due to
sample size issues, wealth tertiles were used.
Area characteristics are hypothesised to affect the demand
for healthcare. Place of residence and region were included
to capture regional differences. Here, it is hypothesised that
living in an urban area increases the likelihood of health in-
surance enrolment due to the greater availablity of services.
This is supported by Akazili, et al. [17] who found that com-
pared to urban dewellers, rural residents are signifcanlty less
likely to be covered by the NHIS.
Employment status was added to the analysis to ac-
count for premium exemptions for people who are con-
tributing to the NHIS through automatic payroll
reduction when working in the formal sector.
Other potential control variables were not directly
comparable between the two surveys due to substantial
differences in the questionnaire.
The GLSS asked about former insurance enrolment, hence
only the GLSS was used for the analysis of insurance re-
enrolment and drop out. One additional variable - disability
status - was added to the model looking at re-enrolment and
insurance drop out. Measuring health in terms of disabilities
tries to minimise biases resulting from older adults' tendency
to overstate their health status in surveys as they have lower
expectations of good health [24].
The coding of all control variables is summarised in
Table 1.
The characteristics of the study population using the
SAGE and GLSS are summarised in Table 2. Table 2 high-
lights the differences between younger and older adults in
the surveys used. It shows that in both surveys a higher pro-
portion of older adults are living in rural areas compared
with their younger counterparts, and that older adults are
lower educated and suffer from higher levels of disablities.
Methods of Analysis
The initial analysis distinguishes between NHIS coverage
and NHIS non-coverage. Bivariate analysis of the out-
come and explanatory variables highlights patterns of
NHIS enrolment, with Pearson's Chi-squared test used
to assess whether there is a significant association at a
5% significance level. Binary logistic regression was then
applied to calculate the predicted probability of falling
into the outcome category for different groups. Separate
models were built for adults aged 18-49 and older adults
aged 50 plus using the two different surveys.
Building upon this, supplementary analysis using the
GLSS and a multinomial logistic regression model then
distinguished between three outcomes of insurance status:
never enrolled in an insurance scheme, currently insured
under the NHIS (reference category) and previously in-
sured. Out of the two surveys, only the GLSS asked about
previous insurance enrolment, which made this supple-
mentary analysis possible, however, findings could not be
compared to the SAGE.

Results
Determinants of Current Enrolment
In order to understand differences in current enrolment be-
tween younger and older adults, Fig.1 compares NHIS cover-
age between both groups and selected variables of interest.
Overall, a higher enrolment rate is found among older adults
compared to those aged 18-49 (p <0.001). Comparing NHIS
coverage of 18-49 year olds by gender, the GLSS indicates a
higher enrolment rate among females compared to males
(see Fig. 1a). However, in contrast, the results from the
SAGE data point to a higher level of coverage among males.
Looking at older adults (aged 50 and over), both surveys re-
veal a higher enrolment rate among females.
Both surveys confirm that wealthier individuals are
more likely to enrol in the NHIS (p <0.01) (Fig. 1b). This
was found to be true for both age groups even though
adults aged 70 plus are exempt from the premium. 47%

of people aged 50 plus who belong to the poorest wealth
tertile report NHIS coverage in the GLSS, compared to
67% in the richest tertile. The SAGE shows a similar dif-
ferential by wealth status, with 28% of poorer older
adults covered under the NHIS compared to 46% of rich
older adults.
With regard to residential differences, both surveys
show for both age groups a higher coverage in urban
areas compared to rural areas (p <0.001) (Fig. 1c).
Regression Results
Logistic regression analysis was conducted for each survey
to determine the correlates of health insurance member-
ship. Two models were fitted; one for adults aged 18-49,
and one for older adults aged 50 plus. Results are sum-
marised in Tables 3 and 4 and are presented separately by
age group. Due to the different survey sample sizes, the
presentation of the results focuses on the direction of as-
sociations rather than only on significance.

Adults Aged 18 to 49
In line with the bi-variate results discussed above, Table 3
illustrates a difference in the effect of gender across the
surveys. The GLSS highlights that females are significantly
more likely to enrol in the NHIS (OR: 1.99 CI: 1.86-2.13).
No significant association between gender and insurance
coverage is found using SAGE, however, the direction of
the effect suggests that women are less likely to enrol in
the NHIS compared to men (OR: 0.80 CI: 0.50-1.29).
In the SAGE and the GLSS place of residence and mari-
tal status are found to have no significant effect on NHIS
enrolment among younger adults. However, in both sur-
veys higher levels of wealth are significantly and positively
associated with insurance coverage. Similarly, higher
education is associated with a greater likelihood of being
enrolled in an insurance scheme. Further, those working
in the public sector are more likely to be insured under
the NHIS (SAGE OR: 5.26 CI: 2.32-11.91; GLSS OR: 2.02
CI: 1.67-2.45).
Older Adults Aged 50 plus
Amongst people aged 50 plus, Table 4 shows an increas-
ing likelihood of NHIS membership with age and wealth.
Despite the premium exemption, richer older adults are
still more likely to be part of the NHIS than poorer

elders. In line with the findings for younger adults, those
working in the formal public sector are significantly
more likely to be insured under the NHIS (SAGE OR: 1.
80 CI: 1.21-2.70; GLSS OR: 2.26 CI: 1.48-3.34).
Unlike for younger adults, marital status and place of
residence are found to have a significant effect on in-
surance enrolment for older adults when using the
GLSS. Non-married older adults are significantly less
likely to enrol in the NHIS compared to their married
counterparts. Table 4 shows a significantly greater like-
lihood of insurance enrolment in urban areas when
using the GLSS (OR: 1.25 CI: 1.04-1.49). Looking at
regional effects though, the two different surveys are
consistent in the finding that residents of any other re-
gion were more likely to enrol in the NHIS than those
living in Greater Accra.
When comparing both surveys, the analysis shows
that the direction of association is consistent for most
independent variables across both surveys.
As a final point, Fig. 2 highlights that older adults have
a greater probability of being part of the NHIS com-
pared to younger adults. Secondly, it highlights that
among both population groups, the probability of being
insured increases over time.

Determinants of Previous Enrolment
Tables 5 and 6 present the odds ratio comparing the mul-
tiple factors that determine current, none, and previous
insurance enrolment among adults aged 18-49 as well as
adults aged 50 and over. The models give the odds ratio
for either having never been enrolled or dropped out, in
comparison with being currently enrolled.
Figure 3 shows the predicted probability of insurance
status by age group. It shows that older adults have a
slightly lower probability of dropping out of insurance
coverage (14%) compared to younger adults (17%).
Due to the premium exemption from age 70, it is of
interest to unpack those findings further for older adults.
Figure 4 shows that older adults aged 70 plus have a sig-
nificantly smaller likelihood of dropping out of insurance
coverage and are more likely to be currently enrolled
compared to other older adults aged between 50 and 69.
Further results once more confirm that insurance sta-
tus is strongly related with wealth and educational sta-
tus. For both younger and older adults the probability of
dropping out of insurance enrolment is significantly
higher for the poorest and lower educated. Moreover,
the likelihood of dropping out of insurance enrolment
decreases significantly with being female for both age
groups. Separating the analysis between never, currently,
and previously enrolled shows that younger and older
adults living in rural areas are significantly more likely
to have never been enrolled in an insurance scheme.
Discussion
The lack of social security and increasing healthcare de-
mands in older age suggest that the establishment of com-
prehensive universal health insurance systems may be
particularly valuable in ensuring equal access to healthcare
in sub-Saharan Africa. The study carried out here ad-
vances the literature on insurance enrolment by analysing
factors associated with insurance enrolment among older
adults in Ghana as a separate population group. It indi-
cates that correlates of insurance membership overlap be-
tween younger and older adults with only minor
exceptions. This suggests that healthcare reforms to in-
crease insurance affiliation can be beneficial across both
population groups. Such a finding appears especially clear
when it comes to promoting higher coverage among the
poor. Despite scaled-to-income fees that, in theory, should
mitigate skewed enrolment according to wealth, the find-
ings suggest that insurance enrolment increases with
wealth. This finding confirms that of other researchers e.g.
[7, 16, 26]. Despite the theoretical argument that health
insurance will improve access to healthcare, low enrol-
ment among the poorest indicates a failure of policy to en-
sure equal access. For example, local district offices in
Ghana have been found to be charging flat premium pay-
ments across the board due to difficulties in determining
the socioeconomic group [27]. More research is needed
on whether the "core poor" and people over 70 are aware
of the premium exemption. Awareness of social protec-
tion schemes seems to be a problem in Ghana. Other so-
cial protection programmes, including the Livelihood
Empowerment Against Poverty (LEAP), have shown low
awareness and a low uptake [28]. More research is needed
on whether the registration fee hinders enrolment as, even
for those exempt from the insurance premium itself, the
registration fee is a requirement. Kusi and Enemark [29]
revealed that the registration fee imposes a burden on very
poor households.
In order to overcome the gap in insurance enrolment
between rich and poor, external financial support needs
to be increased and premiums need to decrease. Gov-
ernment subsidies or donor funding are seen as one path
to stabilizing the health finance system in the long run.
To increase enrolment, efforts need to be undertaken to
ensure that all people who fall below the poverty line
and are aged 70 and over are aware of the premium

exemption in the NHIS. To improve insurance cover-
age among the poor, additional policy initiatives should
be considered such as travel reimbursement, particularly
for those living in rural areas where insurance coverage
was found to be low.
An increase in education was found to significantly in-
crease insurance affiliation for both younger and older
adults. This finding underlines that of Ayitey, et al. [7]
who showed that with rising education, NHIS enrolment
increases. It is unlikely that there is a direct causal link
between higher education and increased NHIS awareness
among older adults. In the GLSS round 6 (2012/2013) less
than 0.5% of respondents reported that they did not know
about the system. Also Schultz, et al. [30] found no evi-
dence that health education increased NHIS enrolment.
Further research is needed to fully understand and explain
the differences in NHIS enrolment by education status.
Comparing NHIS coverage of 18-49 year olds by gen-
der, the GLSS shows a higher enrolment rate among fe-
males compared to males. This is in line with previous

research by Ayitey, et al. [7] who also found that the
NHIS uptake in Ghana is greater among women com-
pared to men. However, in contrast, the results from the
SAGE data point to a higher level of coverage among
males. These differences can, in part, be attributed to dif-
ferences in the timing of the fieldwork and the policy en-
vironment. Since July 2008, all pregnant women who
attend antenatal care in one of the NHIA accredited facil-
ities are exempt from the NHIS premium payment as they
are automatically registered in the scheme upon arrival.
They and their newborn child are entitled to NHIS bene-
fits until 3 months after the delivery [31]. The fieldwork
for the SAGE took place between May 2007 and June
2008. This means that during the SAGE data collection
period, the premium exemption for pregnant women was
not yet in place, which could account for the lower cover-
age among women particularly in reproductive age. Both
surveys showed significantly lower likelihood of insurance
drop out among females in both age groups. Women
might be more aware of the benefits provided by the

NHIS as women tend to be responsible for the health and
wellbeing of the household [6].
With regards to age, this study found that an increase in
age among older adults is associated with a greater prob-
ability of being insured in the NHIS. This refers back to the
hypothesis that people assess their health status before in-
surance enrolment [32] and that older adults are more
likely to invest in their health due to increasing usage of
healthcare with age. Further analysis in this paper showed
that older adults also had a slightly lower probability of
dropping out of insurance coverage compared to younger
adults. This could be due to the above-described greater
need of health insurance coverage with increasing age. In
addition, older adults might have had more time to re-
enrol after dropping out. The opportunity cost of going to
the district office to enrol tends to be lower for older adults
as they are less likely to have to take a day off work.
Younger adults tend to have less time to enrol and have
greater opportunity costs like missing time at work.
Following this argument, older adults may also have had
more opportunities to enrol in the first instance. Younger
adults may have dropped out but not yet re-enrolled as they
need less healthcare than older adults. Women especially
might not feel the need for insurance coverage after
childbirth.
When treating the surveys as two cross-sectional sur-
veys, they indicate an increasing trend in NHIS enrolment.
Trends in enrolment can be attributed to changes in
health polices and economic circumstances in Ghana in-
cluding NHIS facility accreditation in 2009 to improve
quality and access to care, free enrolment for pregnant
women in 2008, economic growth and increasing per
capita income, and more general improvements of the
NHIS over time. In 2007/2008, when the SAGE was con-
ducted, the NHIS was still a new system. Over 10 years on
from its implementation, it has now been allowed some
time to learn from experience and improve its services.
Finally, this paper was interested in answering the
question of whether the correlates of insurance affili-
ation differ depending on which survey (GLSS or SAGE)

is used. Because of the fact that the true population
correlates of insurance coverage are unknown, it is
difficult to estimate which of the surveys delivers more
accurate results. Comparing survey results can, how-
ever, give reassurance to analyses of the determinants of
NHIS coverage. The findings give assurance that both
datasets (GLSS and SAGE) are suitable for research on
insurance affiliation and that both surveys produce com-
parable results.
Conclusion
Using both timely and also less recent surveys indicates
that although the gap in coverage among rich and poor
and urban and rural residents appears to have decreased,
these factors still determine NHIS coverage of younger
and older adults. The same holds for education. Increased
efforts are needed to ensure equal access to care in mov-
ing towards UHC. The results in this paper highlight the
need to introduce specific measures to target those groups
with low enrolment and those who are at the highest risk
of dropping out. The existence of insurance alone is not
sufficient and efforts are needed to target the poorest and
less well educated members of society at all ages to ensure
equal access to care across the life course.
