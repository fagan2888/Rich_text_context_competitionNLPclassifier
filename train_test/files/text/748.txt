Association among Health Habits, Risk Factors, and
AU-Cause Mortality
in a Black California Population

We evaluated dietary and other risk factors in a black Califor?
nia cohort. Baseline data were gathered in 1974 and 1976, and
mortality follow-up continued through 1985. A study census
questionnaire was returned from 3,299 subjects who lived in a
household containing at least one Seventh-Day Adventist. Of
these, 1,668 subjects also completed a detailed life-style and
dietary questionnaire in 1976. Vital status was ascertained
using church records and the California State death tapes.
Mortality hazard ratios (HR; both sexes combined) across three
increasing consumption levels were determined for nuts (1.00,
0.60, 0.56), fruits (1.00, 0.38, 0.57), and green salads (1.00,
0.54, 0.65). Consumption of meats appeared more hazardous
for women, although there was no dose-response relation.
Education (HR = 1.00, no college; 0.74, some college; 0.42,
college graduate), male gender (HR = 1.55), diabetes mellitus
(HR = 1.77), and hypertension (HR = 2.52) were indepen?
dently associated with mortality, as was obesity, which had a
curvilinear association in women and a linear association in
men. Exercise was not associated with mortality after excluding
those with morbidity at baseline. In summary, traditional risk
factors operated with similar force in this black population. In
addition, the frequent consumption of nuts, fruits, and green
salads appears protective. (Epidemiology 1997;8:168-174)
Keywords: mortality, Black American, diet, Seventh-Day Adventist, gender, education, life-style.
Inequalities in health status among various racial and
ethnic groups are observed for a wide range of medical
probiems. Currently, there is little evidence that the
health disadvantage experienced by black Americans
stems from genetic differences at the population level,1"4
and it seems likely that potentially modifiable environ?
mental factors underlie much of this problem.
The Adventist Health Study (AHS) is a prospective
cohort study of black and white subjects living in Cali?
fornia during 1974. Although the majority of subjects
were Seventh-Day Adventists, among black men partic?
ularly, a sizable minority group were not. The Adventist
religion prohibits the use of alcohol, tobacco, and pork;
members are strongly advised to adhere to a lacto-ovo-
vegetarian diet and to avoid coffee, tea, and other caf-
feine-containing beverages. Nevertheless, there is a wide
range of dietary habits in populations that contain many

Adventists, an attractive situation in which to study the
relation between diet and chronic diseases.
Although there have been many reports published
from the Adventist Health Study over the last decade,
this is the first pertaining to black subjects. We examine
associations among demographic variables, cardiovascu?
lar risk factors, diet, and all-cause mortality.
Subjects and Methods
A detailed description of methods has been published
previously.5 Using church directories, an attempt was
made in 1974 to contact all households in California
containing at least one Adventist. A census question?
naire was mailed from the Adventist Health Study,
requesting information from all residents of these homes,
irrespective of religion. In August 1976, a second ques?
tionnaire, the life-style questionnaire, was mailed to the
3,537 black subjects whose heads of households had
responded to the census questionnaire. This second
questionnaire sought further demographic as well as nu?
tritional and life-style information. One thousand seven
hundred forty (49.2%) of these subjects responded to the
life-style questionnaire. The equivalent response rate
among non-Hispanic whites was 75.1%.
Exposure information relevant to our hypotheses was
included in both the census and life-style questionnaires.
The census questionnaire included questions on age, sex,
marital status, and education. Nevertheless, the life-style
questionnaire contained the majority of relevant vari?
ables. These included a personal history of physician-

diagnosed heart disease, diabetes mellitus, or hyperten?
sion; self-reported height and weight; previous and
current cigarette smoking; and exercise and dietary hab?
its. Exercise was categorized as low, moderate, or high;
this represents a cross-classification of two questions
relating to occupational and leisure activities. The fol?
lowing questions were asked: "Outside of your usual work
or daily activities, do you usually get at least 15 minutes
of vigorous exercise three or more times per week?"
(There followed a list of possible vigorous activities for
the subject to check whether he or she undertook these
at least three times each week for 15 minutes on each
occasion.) "Does your usual daily work or responsibilities
involve vigorous activities similar to those listed in the
previous question?" (Responses were "very often," "fre?
quently," "occasionally," "rarely," or "never.") "High"
exercise required a "very often" response for vigorous
occupational activity, and/or vigorous leisure activities
at least three times each week; "low" exercise required
no regular leisure exercise activity and vigorous activity
at work only "occasionally" or less; responses of the
remaining subjects were classified as moderate exercise.
A semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire was
developed to measure the unique diet6,7 of the Adventist
Health Study population. The subjects were asked to
report on the frequency of current use of 65 food items,
which also inciuded beverages and vitamin supplements.
Most foods were evaluated on a scale of 1-8, ranging
from "never consume" to "more than once per day,"
when subjects followed their "usual routine." Foods per-
tinent to these analyses inciuded "nuts (except those
used in recipes)," "beef steak," "beef hamburger," "other
beef or veal," "fish," "poultry (chicken or turkey)," "pork
products," "cheese (except cottage cheese)," "dried or
canned beans, lentils, split peas, etc," "eggs (except
those used in recipes)," "tomatoes (fresh or canned),"
"cooked green vegetables," "green salads (tossed salad,
coleslaw, etc)," "canned or frozen fruit," "raisins, dates,
and other dried fruits," "fresh citrus fruit (not juice),"
"fresh fruit commonly available in winter (apples, ba-
nanas, pears, etc)," and "other fresh fruit." For bread, the
question read, "What one type of bread do you use most
of the time?" with options being "white," "100% whole
wheat or whoje grain," "sprouted wheat or wheat berry,"
and "other (rye, cracked wheat, pumpernickel, soy,
etc.)." Responses for the various fruit and beef questions
were summed to form fruit and beef indexes. Alcohol
consumption was assessed using two questions ,"beer and
wine" and "hard liquor." As current consumption was
generally very low in this population, "alcohol" was
scored as "never" if there were "never" responses to both
of the above variables, otherwise "alcohol" was scored as
"ever."
Unlike the non-Hispanic white cohort, this black
cohort was not systematically followed for specific inci?
dent endpoints, although the baseline data were man-
aged in the same fashion, being double-entered to a
computer file and verified. A vital status follow-up of
these study subjects was completed, however. In 1985,
cards that inquired about residential location and vital
status were mailed to 3,040 subjects. This population
corresponded to all respondents to the census question?
naire not already known to be dead and for whom a
current address could be found. When the original study
address was invalid, lists of such names were mailed to
church clerks and also printed in church bulletins for the
attention of congregations. Nonrespondents to the mail?
ings were telephoned where possible.
The investigators also gathered information from
church clerks, friends, or relatives, both in California
and out of state. The cohort was then matched to the
California State death records. We used a computer
program designed to link subjects' identities with those
on the state death tapes.8 Vital status was finally deter?
mined for 93% of the subjects; the remaining 7% were
considered lost to follow-up, as we had had no contact
since study baseline. Thus, the population that had been
followed beyond baseline and who were included in the
analysis here comprised 3,299 subjects who responded to
the census questionnaire and 1,668 respondents to the
life-style questionnaire.
We used multivariate Cox proportional hazard sur?
vival analyses9 to evaluate hazard ratios (HR) for expo?
sure variables on all-cause mortality and to adjust for
potentially confounding variables. We considered di?
etary and other variables as categorical rather than con?
tinuous, as indicated in the tables. The proportionality
requirement was evaluated graphically by inspecting the
log-log plots for all exposure variables under study. Miss?
ing data were handled with the method described by
Woodward et al10
Results
These results mainly arise from the life-style question?
naire and the population that completed this question?
naire. When the variables required for a particular anal?
ysis were all taken from the census questionnaire,
however, we then took advantage of the larger number
of subjects who completed this questionnaire and per?
formed the analysis on the census population. The num?
ber of person-years at risk and the number of fatalities
tabulated by age and sex are shown for both the census
and life-style populations in Table 1. Table 2 shows a
mean age of around 50 years, with women a little older
than men; the population completing both question?
naires was 2-3 years older than the total population.
Both study populations had more male college graduates,
yet there was also a higher percentage of men with less
than an 8th grade education. There were more male
non-Adventists, owing to a larger number of female
church members in households where only one of a
married couple was Adventist. There was a marked
excess of both widowed and divorced women when
compared with men. Table 3 shows multivariate associ?
ations between these same variables and all-cause mor?
tality, using the larger numbers of subjects and the 416
deaths from the census population. Men were disadvan-
taged (HR = 1.55) with respect to mortality, whereas
being a college graduate was associated with a marked

degree of protection against death (HR = 0.42). Non-
Adventists living in Adventist households had a 40%
increase in risk of death when compared with Adventist
household members.
The remaining tables deal with variables found only
on the life-style questionnaire and the population who
completed this questionnaire. Table 4 shows descriptive
data for several nondietary risk factors. A relatively high
prevalence of hypertension was reported, greater in
women than men. Men were more likely to be in the
high-exercise category but also were more likely to be
current or past cigarette smokers, although current
smokers are uncommon. Women were more obese, as
judged by body mass index [BMI; weight (kg) per height
squared (m2)].
Table 5 shows the reported frequency of consumption
of foods, for men and women separately. These results
clearly depict the tendency to vegetarianism in this
population, with a substantial minority of subjects con-

suming no meat products, but also
more than 30% consuming beef at
least three times each week. As one
might expect, this population also
consumes nuts, fruits, legumes, and
cooked green vegetables frequently.
We explored associations individu-
ally between each of these foods and
all-cause mortality, when adjusted for
age, current and past smoking habits,
exercise, and sex (in combined analy?
ses). Results are shown in Table 6.
Frequent consumption of nuts, fruit,
and green salads was associated with
lower hazard ratios for mortality,
whereas there was evidence of in?
creased hazard in those consuming
meat products or cheese.
Table 7 shows a multivariate survival analysis, where
the available traditional nondietary risk factors are in?
cluded in the model together. Men had a much higher
mortality risk, but an effect of smoking on mortality was
particularly marked in women. Subjects with diabetes
mellitus (HR = 1.77) and hypertension (HR = 2.52)
had much higher mortality in both men and women,
whereas exercise was associated with lower mortality.
When we excluded those with any history of heart
disease, stroke, diabetes mellitus, or arthritis present at
baseline, the possible reduction in risk with higher phys?
ical activity was further diminished, with HRs for low,
medium, and vigorous exercise habits of 1.00, 1.08, and
0.96. About 25% of our subjects claimed to have some
form of rheumatism or arthritis.
We found a positive linear trend between mortality
and BMI in men, but there was a curvilinear association
between BMI and mortality in women. These associa?
tions were such that, for values of BMI of 20, 24, sex-
specific mean BMI (26.02 in men and
26.99 in women), 35, and 40, the pre?
dicted hazard ratios for mortality with
respect to the mean are 0.54, 0.82,
1.00, 2.18, and 3.14 for men; 2.46,
1.35, 1.00, 0.87, and 1.30 for women;
and 1.12, 1.03, 1.00, 1.11, and 1.35 for
both sexes combined. Thus, obese
black men, thinner black women, and,
to a lesser extent, very obese
black women had an increased mortal?
ity.
Discussion
In general, black Americans suffer
higher total mortality and higher mor?
tality from many cancers, heart disease,
and stroke than other Americans.1,11"14
As far as we know, associations between
diet and all-cause mortality have not
previously been reported in black Amer?
icans. Only one other study has pro-

vided an assessment of the effects of physical activity on
disease events in this group.15
Cohort studies that have measured risk factors in
black Americans and related them to either all-cause or
coronary heart disease mortality are relatively few in
number. They include the Evans County Study,13,16 the
Charleston Fleart Study,1718 the Multiple Risk Factor
Intervention Trial screening program,11 and the Na?
tional Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES) study.15-19
Among the black Adventist Health Study subjects,
several life-style, health, and dietary variables were im-
portantly associated with all-cause mortality. In sum?
mary, age and male gender were associated with in?
creased risk of death as expected, whereas higher
education and Adventist membership were associated
with lower risk. Increased mortality was associated with
self-reported diabetes mellitus, self-reported high blood
pressure, BMI (in men), and current smoking status.

from each subject. There were 36,315 person-years of
observation in the census questionnaire respondents and
15,893 in the life-style questionnaire respondents. The
completeness of follow-up over 11 years was good, with
vital status being established for 93% of subjects. The
population includes both men and women with a broad
age range and with a wide variety of dietary habits. The
relative absence of the possible confounding factors of
alcohol and cigarette smoking is both unusual and po?
tentially helpful.
The apparent protective effect of nut consumption in
this black population is of particular interest, given the
reported consistent associations of similar magnitude in
white study subjects for coronary heart disease20 and
all-cause mortality.21 Possible mechanisms have been
described.22 The finding that black members of the Ad-
ventist Health Study cohort also gained protection from
frequent consumption of fruits and green salads is con?
sistent with data from white subjects in this study,20,23-25
and others,26 in that these foods appear to provide pro?
tection from a variety of cancers. Such effects may in
part be related to their content of fiber and antioxidant
compounds. It appears that these results do not simply
arise because high consumers of nuts, fruit, or salad are
more likely to be vegetarian, as the inclusion of con?
sumption of meat, fish, and poultry as covariates in the
models for both sexes combined resulted in relative risks
of 1.00, 0.60, and 0.55 for nuts; 1.00, 0.39, and 0.56 for
fruit; and 1.00, 0.57, and 0.66 for salad, at increasing
levels of consumption. Thus, the effects of these foods
are essentially unchanged after controlling for vegetar?
ian status.
The black subjects in the Adventist Health Study
cohort were more highly educated, to a modest extent,
than several other black American study popula?
tions.27,28 In the Adventist data, educational attainment
was associated with greatly reduced mortality (Table 3).
Similar results were seen in the NHANES,15 but not the
Charleston Study,18 although the mean years of educa?
tion in the latter were only 4.9 for men and 5.6 for
women. Others have also shown that, in black subjects,
the risks of dying from any cause,12,29 cancer, heart
disease,1,3,16,29,30and, particularly, trauma,31 differ by so?
cioeconomic status.
Socioeconomic status is undoubtedly a surrogate for
other variables of more direct biological importance,
such as residence in a less violent neighborhood, educa?
tion, and motivation to consume more healthful foods,
as well as the availability of better, more consistent
health care. It is unclear, however, whether formal ed?
ucation imparts the same values and beliefs about a
healthful life-style, or the same economic opportunities,
across racial subcultures.
Diabetes mellitus is an important risk factor for mor?
tality in black subjects. The evidence was clearer for
men in our dataset, despite the greater number of women
in the life-style questionnaire population. The only
other large database that reports the effect of diabetes
mellitus in black subjects is the Charleston Heart
Study,18 where there was also a particularly impressive
relative risk in black men and a much smaller risk in
black women.
Hypertension is a well known problem in black pop?
ulations. In our study, the effect of self-reported hyper?
tension on total mortality was substantial in both sexes.
Similar results for men11,13 and for both sexes individu-
ally15,18were found in other major studies. As far as we
know, there has been only one published report of blood
pressure in a black population of vegetarians, which
indicated that vegetarians had lower blood pressure lev?
els.32
The effect of cigarette smoking could not be studied
adequately in our data with so few current smokers.
There is also the possibility that smoking habits had
changed during follow-up, especially in the non-Ad-
ventists. In women, however, the point estimate of the

relative risk was high, at 3.48, but with a wide confi?
dence interval. We found no effect of past cigarette
smoking. This result is not surprising, as the average
duration of church membership for the past smokers was
20.2 years. Hence, quitting would have occurred on
average at least this long ago. Others have found evi?
dence that current cigarette smoking increases risk of
death in black populations.11,13,18
Physical inactivity shows some evidence of associa?
tion with death in our dataset. This relation may reflect
the effect of disease that exists at baseline acting to
reduce exercise. The NHANES study15 also reported
some association between physical activity and risk of
coronary heart disease (confidence interval included the
null), but no adjustment was made for baseline disease or
symptoms.
Our results associating BMI with all-cause mortality
indicated a linear effect on mortality of obesity in black
men, independent of diabetes mellitus and hypertension,
but a "reverse J-shaped" association in women. Wien-
pahl et al33 found an association between BMI and mor?
tality in men in a Kaiser-Permanente cohort of black
Americans in California, but no association in women.
Neither the Charleston Heart Study nor the Evans
County Study investigators reported important associa?
tions between BMI and all-cause mortality.13,17,18 The
reasons for the disparity among these studies is unclear.
It has been suggested that BMI is not a suitable index of
obesity in black female populations, as shape may be
more important.17,34
