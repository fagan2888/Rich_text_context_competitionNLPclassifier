Abstract
Background: Percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage (PTBD) is widely performed as a
salvage procedure in patients with unresectable malignant obstruction of the common bile
duct (CBD) after failed endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) or in case of
surgically altered anatomy. Endoscopic ultrasound-guided hepaticogastrostomy (EU-HGS) is a
more recently introduced alternative to relieve malignant obstructive jaundice. The aim of this
prospective observational study was to compare the outcome, efficacy and adverse events of
EU-HGS and PTBD.
Methods: From April 2012 to August 2015, consecutive patients with malignant CBD
obstruction who underwent EU-HGS or PTBD in two tertiary-care referral centers were
included. The primary endpoint was the clinical success rate. Secondary endpoints were
technical success, overall survival, procedure-related adverse events, incidence of adverse
events, and reintervention rate.
Results: A total of 51 patients (EU-HGS, n = 31; PTBD, n = 20) were included. Median survival
was 71 days (range 25­75th percentile; 30­95) for the EU-HGS group and 78 days (range 25­
75th percentile; 42­108) for the PTBD group (p = 0.99). Technical success was achieved in all
patients in both groups. Clinical success was achieved in 25 (86%) of 31 patients in the EU-HGS
group and in 15 (83%) of 20 patients in the PTBD group (p = 0.88). There was no difference
in adverse events rates between the two groups (EU-HGS: 16%; PTBD: 10%) (p = 0.69).
Four deaths within 1 month (two hemorrhagic and two septic) were considered procedure
related (two in the EU-HGS group and two in the PTBD group). Overall reintervention rate
was significantly lower after EU-HGS (n = 2) than after PTBD (n = 21) (p = 0.0001). Length of
hospital stay was shorter after EU-HGS (8 days versus 15 days; p = 0.002).
Conclusions: EU-HGS can be an effective and safe mini invasive-procedure alternative to
PTBD, with similar success and adverse-event rates, but with lower rates of reintervention
and length of hospitalization.

Introduction
The instrumental treatment of jaundice second-
ary to a malignancy obstructing the common bile
duct (CBD) generally involves stenting during
endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography
(ERCP).1­3 However, 3­5% of cases cannot be
managed by ERCP due to various impediments,
such as ampullary infiltration, modified anatomy
(gastrectomy with Roux-en-Y anastomosis,
Whipple's resection, etc.), duodenal obstruction
or to the tightness of luminal occlusion.4,5 In such
cases, percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage
(PTBD) is most commonly performed. However,
PTBD is associated with complications such as
bleeding, cholangitis, and pneumothorax.6,7 The
common practice of temporary external drainage
also has an adverse impact on the quality of life
(QOL) of patients who are already treated for an
incurable disease. Recently, interventions using
endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) have been devel-
oped, not only to obtain histopathologic proof of
malignancy, but also to achieve biliary drainage.
EUS-guided biliary drainage (EU-BD), first
reported by Giovannini et al.,8 broadly includes
three different access routes, namely EUS-guided
transpapillary rendez-vous,9,10 EUS-guided
choledochoduodenostomy11 and EUS-guided
hepaticogastrostomy [from hereinafter abbrevi-
ated as endoscopic ultrasound-guided hepati-
cogastrostomy (EU-HGS) in this paper].12
Because of guidewire manipulation difficulties,
the rendez-vous manoeuver was reported to have
a low success rate ranging from 40% to 80%,13­15
with prolonged procedure time and fluoroscopic
exposure.13,16­18 EUS-guided choledochoduo-
denostomy is also indicated in case of failed
ERCP, however, this technique cannot always be
performed in case of surgically altered anatomy or
duodenal bulb obstruction. Transduodenal and
transhepatogastric access routes are reported to
have similar feasibility, but EU-HGS has cur-
rently the broadest range of indications among
EU-BD procedures, with a good feasibility in a
recent prospective study.19 To date, many case
reports, small series, retrospective and prospec-
tive comparisons between the different EU-BD
methods have been reported.20 Despite this litera-
ture, no study has specifically compared EU-HGS
and PTBD in case of failed ERCP for malignant
obstructive jaundice.
Since both EU-BD and PTDB are technically
available alternatives in case of failed ERCP, it is
important to compare their outcomes in order to
select the best option for those patients. Until
now, only four small studies21­24 have compared
EU-BD and PTBD but studied mostly the trans-
duodenal route.
We thus conducted a retrospective analysis from
two prospectively maintained databases to com-
pare EU-HGS and PTDB after failed ERCP for
malignant obstructive jaundice.
Patients and methods
Patients
All therapeutic EU-BD procedures were per-
formed in Cochin Hospital (Paris, France),
whereas all PTBD procedures were performed in
the University hospital of Strasbourg. All proce-
dures and data collection were done after obtain-
ing the patients' informed consent. Information
on patients were retrieved from two similarly con-
structed databases prospectively implemented in
each center.
We included all consecutive patients presenting
with malignant obstructive jaundice not exceed-
ing Bismuth stage I (i.e. involving only the dis-
tal bile duct or the upper part of the common
hepatic duct with no involvement of the main
confluence), who underwent EU-HGS or
PTBD with stent placement after one (or sev-
eral) failed ERCP, as well as patients with pre-
vious surgery precluding ERCP. All patients
had histologically proven malignancy deemed
unresectable after radiologic assessment (com-
puterized tomography, EUS, or magnetic reso-
nance imaging) and multidisciplinary staff
agreement. Exclusion criteria were resectable,
borderline or potentially resectable tumors,
hilar obstruction involving the main conflu-
ence, large-volume ascites, and blood coagula-
tion disorders. We obtained specific informed
consent from each patient in both groups. The
study received IRB approval in both centers.
Study endpoints
Data: Patient history, biochemical data at the
time of intervention and during follow up, the
radiological database, procedural records, and
pathological and clinical follow up were reviewed.
A patient's demographics, histological diagnosis,
WHO status, procedure details, characteristics
and reasons for failed ERCP, clinical success,

technical success, adverse events, inpatient length
of stay, number of reinterventions during follow
up and survival were recorded. Follow up was
continued until death or date of transfer to a pal-
liative care center. QOL was not analyzed due to
insufficient data.
Outcomes were defined as follows: Clinical success
was defined as a drop in the plasma bilirubin level
of >50% at 1 week. Technical success was
defined as a successful hepatic bile duct puncture
with guidewire insertion and stent or drain place-
ment in the desired location as determined endo-
scopically and/or radiographically. Procedural
mortality was defined as death occurring within 7
days of the procedure. Reinterventions were split
between scheduled reinterventions (for tube
upsizing/exchange) and unscheduled reinterven-
tions (for adverse-event management).
Endpoints: The primary endpoint of the study was
the clinical success rate. Secondary endpoints
were technical success of the intervention, overall
survival, procedure-related adverse events within
30 days, number of reinterventions until death
and length of hospital stay (from the date of pro-
cedure to discharge).
Procedures
All procedures were performed with monitored
anesthesia and general anesthesia. Prophylactic
antibiotics (generally second- or third-generation
cephalosporin) were administered perioperatively
in all patients.
Endoscopic ultrasound-guided hepaticogastros-
tomy. By using a curved linear array echoendo-
scope (Olympus GF-UCT 140­180, Tokyo,
Japan), access to the left hepatic ducts was identi-
fied from the proximal gastric body/cardia and
punctured with a 19-gauge needle (EUSN-19A,
Cook Endoscopy, Winston-Salem, North Caro-
lina, USA). Color Doppler was used to detect any
intervening vessel. After suction sampling for bile
bacteriology analysis, contrast was injected to
obtain a cholangiogram and a 0.035-inch guide-
wire (Jagwire, Boston Scientific, Natick, Ma,
USA) was advanced into the intrahepatic biliary
ducts. The needle shaft was exchanged over
the wire for a 6-French (6 Fr) cystostome (Endo-
Flex®, GmbH, Voerde Düsseldorf, Germany)
and the needle tract was coagulated using Endo-
cut I­Effet1/2-2 W (Erbe VIO 200 D, GmbH,
Tübingen, Germany) before inserting a fully cov-
ered self-expandable metal stent in the left hepatic
duct (Wallflex RX Permalume®, Boston Scien-
tific, Natick, Ma, USA). Usually, at least 2 cm
from the proximal stent end were left in the stom-
ach (Figure 1).When the stent was released in the
distal esophagus, it was gently pushed down in
the gastric cavity. No additional antegrade trans-
papillary stent was placed. A Hemostatic clip
(Instinct, Cook Medical or Resolution, Boston
Scientific, Natick, Ma, USA) was most often used
in order to secure the stent position and reduce
the risk of stent migration. All procedures were
performed by one interventional endoscopist
(FP) with expertise in ERCP and interventional
EUS (FP: 5-years' experience with EU-BD before
the first inclusion in the study, >300 therapeutic
EUS procedure/years and >1000 ERCPs/year).
Percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage.The
biliary tree was punctured under ultrasound guid-
ance. Contrast injection was performed to obtain
a cholangiogram. The biliary tree was then cath-
eterized with a guide wire under fluoroscopic
guidance and a 7 Fr introducer placed at entry of
the intrahepatic bile duct. After crossing the
tumor obstruction, a self-expandable metallic
stent (Bard E. Luminex Stent 10 mm diameter,
Angiomed GmbH & Co., Karlsruhe, Germany)
was inserted in a one-step procedure. In case of
impassable obstruction or poor condition of the
patient due to infection, an 8 Fr externally locked
drain was placed. After 1 week, or if the patient
improved, a second attempt of metallic stent
placement was performed. In case of lower bile
duct obstruction, the distal end of the stent was
placed across the ampulla in order to ensure max-
imal biliary drainage and reduce the risk of post-
procedure cholangitis. An 8 Fr external drain was
left along the PTB track following stent place-
ment and removed 2­7 days later if the drainage
from the metallic stent was effective. All cases
were performed by one interventional radiologist
with expertise in interventional radiology (MG:
15-years' experience with PTBD, with 200 proce-
dures/year).
Follow up
The patients were followed up after the proce-
dure, with scheduled visits for clinical assessment
and laboratory tests. The date of death or date of
transfer to the palliative care unit was prospec-
tively recorded. In case of missing data, medical
Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology 10(6)

records were reviewed and eventually, referring
physicians were called on.
Statistical analysis
Patient characteristics are expressed as propor-
tions and median ± interquartile range.
Association between outcomes (clinical success,
technical success, adverse event) and qualitative
variables was determined using Fisher's exact
test. Comparison between continuous variables
was performed using the Kruskal­Wallis test.
Median survival times were estimated with their
95% confidence interval using the Kaplan­
Meier's method, and compared between proce-
dure groups using the log-rank test. A p value <
0.05 (two sided) was considered significant.
Results
Characteristics
Out of 3159 ERCP procedures for obstructive
jaundice performed at Cochin Hospital during
the study period, 51 (1.6%) had EU-BD per-
formed for malignant obstructive jaundice after a
failed ERCP. Of those 51 patients, 31 (61%)
underwent EU-HGS, 15 (30%) underwent EUS
rendez-vous and 5 (9%) patients underwent
EUS-guided choledocoduodenostomy. Only
patients with EU-HGS were included.
A total of 214 PTB procedures were performed at
University Hospital, Strasbourg, for malignant
biliary obstruction during the same period. Out of
those, 20 patients underwent PTBD after a failed
ERCP. Three patients only had an external drain
for poor tumor prognosis (Figure 2).
A total of 51 patients (mean age 71 year ± 13.6,
female 24) with malignant CBD biliary obstruc-
tion were thus included after either EU-HGS (n
= 31) or PTBD (n = 20). Patient demographics,
clinical information and reason for ERCP failure
were similar in both groups. Clinical indications
for biliary drainage and stenting according to
technique are depicted in Table 1. There was no
statistical difference between groups.

3 patients (ovarian cancer n = 1, renal cancer n =
1, colorectal cancer n = 1). Biliary cannulation
failed as a consequence of periampullary tumor
infiltration associated with pancreatic head carci-
noma in five patients and ampullary cancer in two
patients; in six patients, complex and tight biliary
stricture was the reason for failed ERCP.
Outcomes
Technical success of biliary stent placement was
achieved in 100% of cases in both groups after
successful cannulation (Table 2).
Clinical success was achieved in 25 (86%) of 31
patients in the EU-HGS group and in 15 (83%)
of 20 patients in the PTBD group, with no statis-
tical difference between groups as shown in
Table 2.
Median survival was 71 days (range 25­75th per-
centile; 30­95) for the EU-HGS group and 78
days (range 25­75th percentile; 42­108) for the
PTBD group (p = 0.99), without significant differ-
ence between both groups (p = 0.99) (Figure 3).
All patients died as a consequence of the underly-
ing disease progression. The exact date of death
was known in 43 (84%) patients. The date of
transfer to a palliative care unit was known for five
(10%) patients, and only the date of the last visit to
the clinic for three patients (6%), in whom it was
approximated as the presumed date of death (two
in the EU-HGS group, one in the PTBD group).
The overall rate of adverse events was 16% (five
adverse events) in the EUS-HGS group and 10%
(two adverse events) in the PTBD group, with no
statistical difference between groups as shown in
Table 2.
Mortality at day 7, deemed potentially procedure
related, was 6% (two patients) in the EU-HGS
group (including one severe sepsis at day 1 and a
major bleeding at day 5 from the puncture site)
and 10% (two patients) in the PTBD group (two
with severe sepsis at day 1 and day 3) (Table 2).
Patients with bile leak required percutaneous
biloma drainage. All other patients were managed
conservatively.
Reinterventions.During long-term follow up, a
total of two and four unscheduled reinterventions
were required in the EU-HGS and PTBD groups
(p = 0.19), respectively (Table 2). No patient
presented with stent migration in the EU-HGS
group, but two patients who developed stent
occlusion were successfully treated by stent-in-
stent insertion using uncovered metal stents.
Four patients presented with stent occlusion in
the PTBD group: two patients initially had a 10

Fr plastic stent for a poor carcinologic prognosis.
Treatment consisted of changing the 10 Fr plastic
stent. In two other patients, stent occlusion was
successfully treated by stent-in-stent with uncov-
ered metal stents.
In the EU-HGS group, no scheduled reintervention
was required, whereas 17 patients needed drain
exchange or removal in the PTBD group (p =
0.0001) (Table 2).
The overall reintervention rate (scheduled and
unscheduled) was significantly higher in the
PTBD group (2 versus 21; p = 0.0001).
Length of hospital stay.The length of stay was
longer in the PTDB group (15 days versus 8 days;
p = 0.002) due to the number of scheduled rein-
terventions and the need to keep the patient for
2­7 days before removing the 8 Fr external drain
following metallic stent placement.
Discussion
Percutaneous transhepatic cholangiographic
access is often preferred for the palliation of
malignant obstructive jaundice only after a first
unsuccessful attempt at ERCP, because PTBD
remains associated with relatively more adverse
events than endoscopic access to the biliary tract:
a recent meta-analysis found a perioperative mor-
bidity rate of up to 60%,25 suggesting the need of
a less iatrogenic procedure.
EU-BD was first described in 2001.8 Following
this paper, several groups reported on the efficacy
of EU-BD as an alternative biliary drainage
method after unsuccessful ERCP. Interventional
EUS techniques have only very recently gained
some momentum, because devices designed to
create a transparietal tract, manipulate guidewires
and secure stent positioning have been made
available during the last 5­8 years.
Both EU-BD and PTBD are associated with a
risk of injury to intervening vessels and additional
hazards in case of ascites.
Beside EUS-based techniques, endoscopic
approaches for pancreatobiliary diseases in
patients with surgically altered gastrointestinal
anatomy also include the use of enteroscopy-
assisted ERCP. Recently an international multi-
center trial compared EUS-guided biliary
Figure 3. Survival after biliary drainage according to procedure (Kaplan­Meier's survival calculation).
Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology 10(6)

drainage versus enteroscopy-assisted ERCP in
patients with biliary obstruction and previous sur-
gery precluding standard ERCP.26 The authors
reported higher technical (98% versus 65.3%)
and clinical (88% versus 60.4%) success rates in
the EUS-BD group versus the enteroscopy-
assisted group, respectively. The study concluded
that EU-BD offers multiple advantages over ent-
eroscopy-assisted ERCP in patients with surgi-
cally altered upper gastrointestinal anatomy,
including not only success rates, but also reduced
procedural times.
Four previous studies have compared EU-BD
and PTBD. Their main results are summarized in
Table 3. Artifon et al. randomized 25 patients to
receive either EUS-guided choledocoduodenos-
tomy or PTBD21 with clinical and technical suc-
cess in all patients of both groups. There were no
differences in terms of adverse events between
groups.
Two retrospective studies by Bapaye22 and
Khashab23 compared PTBD and EU-BD and
found significantly more adverse events after
PTBD, although clinical success rates were simi-
lar. Finally, a recently published study by Lee
et al24 compared in a randomized fashion a mix-
ture of EU-CD and EU-HGS procedures versus
PTBD and found similar clinical results but more
adverse events after PTBD.
We decided to compare only EU-HGS and
PTBD cases for two reasons: first, EU-HGS is
the only technique that allows biliary drainage
after surgical bile duct resection or disconnec-
tion, as long as left hepatic ducts are dilated; sec-
ond, and above all, because EU-HGS shares
with PTBD the use of an antegrade transhepatic
route, allowing a rather peripheral puncture of
the bile ducts.
It is generally considered that a randomized con-
trolled trial with inclusions for all arms in the same
center is the best methodology when interventions
can be achieved with the same level of quality (i.e.
when comparing two drugs or two endoscopic
procedures for which endoscopists have the same
level of expertise). However, when comparing
EUS-guided and percutaneous techniques, it is
uncommon to find the same level of expertise in
one center for both techniques, since most diffi-
cult cases are referred to the specialist with the
best available expertise (i.e. the radiologist or the
endoscopist), which can be seen as discouraging
the development of the alternative technique.27
A valid method to avoid skewing a study in favor
of one technique (arguably in favor of EUS in pre-
viously published studies) may be the retrospec-
tive expertise-based study, which may minimize
bias resulting from differences in technical compe-
tency and endoscopist's preference, and decrease
crossover from one intervention to the other.28

The present study is a retrospective expertise-
based study from two centers, in which data were
collected on a prospectively maintained database,
inclusion criteria were strictly verified and experts
of each technique were available. This study is
therefore the first comparing EUS using exclu-
sively the transgastric approach to the standard
technique of PTBD, both performed by experts,
when ERCP has failed to gain access to the
obstructed bile duct. No differences were seen in
preprocedure patient characteristics between the
two study groups and all the patients had unre-
sectable malignant biliary obstruction. Technical
success with stent placement in the desired loca-
tion was successful in all the patients in both
groups. A similarly high clinical success rate
was achieved in both PTBD and EU-HGS
groups, and survival was similar. Furthermore,
no significant difference was noted with regard
to procedure-related adverse events. The overall
PTBD rate of adverse events, lower than in some
other reports,21,23 can be biased by the perfor-
mance of all procedures by the same operator with
expertise in interventional radiology, but the same
is true of the EU-HGS group.
The only significant difference between EU-HGS
and PTBD was found to be the overall number of
reinterventions, which was 10 times lower in the
EU-HGS group. Our data suggest that EU-HGS
may be as effective and safe as the regular PTBD
approach, with the key advantage of EU-HGS that
the procedure can be done during the same session
as the failed ERCP without the pain and inconven-
ience of an external catheter. EU-HGS also main-
tains bile within the gastrointestinal tract to ensure
proper digestion and absorption of nutrients and
avoid compensation for the loss of alkali during
external bile drainage. A major disadvantage of
PTBD compared with EU-HGS is the need for
reinterventions, especially when an external drain
is inserted in the first place. It was a standard oper-
ating procedure for radiologists in our study to
place an external or internal­external plastic drain
for at least 5 days before, and 3 days after metal
stenting. Single-step PTBD, with immediate self-
expanding metal stents (SEMS) stenting and no
external drainage has been reported7 but has also
been associated with significantly more iatrogenic
events in septic cases, such as biloma, hemorrhage
and cholangitis than the three-step procedure
(prestenting drainage, stent insertion, poststent-
ing drain removal). QOL has not been thor-
oughly assessed in this study, but World Health
Organization status was at least equal or better
shortly after the procedure in all patients with suc-
cessful EUS-HGS. However, due to the advanced
course of the disease in most patients and their
poor prognosis, QOL tended to decline in both
groups after a few weeks. It seems reasonable to
estimate that the external biliary drainage, even for
a limited period of time, is a significant hindrance
to the rapid QOL improvement that is expected
after those palliative procedures. A limitation of
EU-HGS procedure is the left lobar access route,
which can be inadequate or insufficient in patients
with advanced hilar obstruction.29 Complex hilar
obstruction was excluded from the present study,
and we are now investigating the value of EU-HGS
in such patients.
Another impediment to the development of
EU-HGS procedure is that expertise in interven-
tional EUS is not widespread, whereas PTBD
can be performed by most interventional radiol-
ogists and is routinely available in more centers
than interventional EUS. The overall rate of
adverse events in the EUS-HGS group is con-
sistent with recent studies and illustrates the
relatively good safety profile of EU-BD com-
pared with ERCP, as shown by one recent study
comparing the clinical efficacy and safety of
EU-BD and ERCP for patients with distal malig-
nant biliary obstruction.30
Finally, despite these limitations and a relatively
small sample size, the strengths of this study, sim-
ilar patients in both groups, homogeneity of tech-
niques with only one expert involved in each
group, full survival follow up, suggest that
EU-HGS is an effective and safe technique and
may provide endoscopists with an additional
alternative biliary drainage method when ERCP
is precluded or unsuccessful. Larger multicenter,
randomized trials would be welcome to establish
the therapeutic and safety profiles of the EU-HGS
procedure before this technique is accepted as a
standard option.
Conclusion
EU-HGS is an effective and safe minimally
invasive procedure alternative to PTBD with
similar success and adverse event rates.
However, EU-HGS is associated with a lower
number of reinterventions and a shorter hospital
stay. Our results suggest that EU-HGS can be a
technique of choice after unsuccessful ERCP at
