Abstract
Many published studies have employed the Mini-K to measure a single fast­slow life history dimension. However, the internal
structure of the Mini-K has not been determined and it is not clear that a single higher order K-factor fits the data. It is also not
clear that the Mini-K is measurement invariant across groups such as the sexes. To establish the construct validity of K as well as
the broader usefulness of applying life history theory to humans, it is crucial that these psychometric issues are addressed as a part
of measure validation efforts. Here we report on three studies that used latent variable modeling and data drawn from two college
student samples (ns ¼ 361 and 300) to elucidate the psychometrics of the Mini-K. We found that (a) the Mini-K had a six
dimensional first-order structure, (b) the K-factor provided a parsimonious explanation of the associations among the lower
order factors at no significant cost to fit, (c) the Mini-K measured the same K-factor across the sexes, (d) K-factor means did not
have the same meaning across the sexes and thus the first-order factors should be used in studies of mean sex differences, and
finally, (e) the K-factor was only associated with environment and aspects of mating competition in females. Implications and
future directions for life history research are discussed.

Several concerns about psychometric research on human life
history strategy (LHS) have been raised, most of which relate to
construct validity (Copping, Campbell, & Muncer, 2014; Cop-
ping, Campbell, Muncer, & Richardson, 2016; Richardson,
Sanning, et al., 2016). One concern is that despite frequent
reference to a single fast­slow dimension (e.g., Super-K), rel-
atively little work has been done to confirm the unidimension-
ality of life history indicators and emerging evidence suggests
they may be multidimensional. For instance, Brumbach, Fig-
ueredo, and Ellis (2009), Richardson et al. (2014), and Richard-
son, Dai, et al. (2016) found that a single dimension did not
subsume all adolescent and young adult LHS indicators. More-
over, Richardson, Sanning, et al. (2016) found that a single
dimension did not subsume all LHS indicators in a nationally
representative sample of middle-aged adults. Richardson, Dar-
iotis, and Lai (2016) extended these findings to a predomi-
nantly urban sample of young adults. These two studies used
broad selections of life history indicators and found two dimen-
sions--mating competition (subsuming, e.g., risk-taking,
aggression, and number of sex partners) and Super-K
(subsuming, e.g., pair-bonding, social contact/support, agree-
ableness, and aspects of covitality). Taken together, these find-
ings imply there may not be a single LHS variable that can be
used to assess life history speed, or in other words, scored to
locate people on a single fast­slow dimension.
Copping, Campbell, and Muncer (2014) recently drew
attention to the validity of scales developed for the specific
purpose of measuring human LHS (e.g., the Mini-K, Figueredo
et al., 2006, and high-K strategy [HKSS], Giosan, 2006,
scales). High scores on these scales are interpreted as signaling
slower LHS, whereas lower scores are taken as implying faster
LHS. The authors factored the HKSS and found that a model

with a single higher order LHS variable fit the data signifi-
cantly worse than a model without. This suggests that when
the HKSS is summed, participants' scores do not correspond to
any single variable or position on a single fast­slow dimension.
Instead, these scores should be interpreted as researcher con-
structed composites of the four HKSS factors.
The Copping et al. (2014) finding that the HKSS is multi-
dimensional, combined with findings that two unique factors
subsumed LHS indicators, raises questions about psychometric
applications of life history theory (LHT) to humans. Do these
findings of multidimensionality extend other scales designed to
measure human LHS, such as the Mini-K and the Arizona Life
History Battery (ALHB; see Figueredo et al., 2006)? These
measures have been used to produce scores locating partici-
pants on a fast­slow (r-K) dimension, but it is not yet clear that
their items reflect a single factor. This is because to the best of
our knowledge, no study has yet confirmed the dimensionality
of the Mini-K, though it has been employed in at least 30
studies (Black, Figueredo, & Jacobs, 2016). Moreover, no stud-
ies that we are aware of have tested the Mini-K for measure-
ment invariance across the sexes, which is important, given the
documented sex differences in reproductive strategies (for dis-
cussion of this, see Copping et al., 2014, 2016; Richardson
et al., 2016). Are sex differences limited to the means and
variances of LHS factors, or are the identities of LHS con-
structs themselves different across the sexes? If LHS factors
are indeed sex invariant, do they have the same correlates
within each sex? These questions have not been adequately
addressed in psychometric studies of human LHS.
Current Project
The current project helps to fill these gaps in the literature by
applying exploratory structural equation modeling (ESEM),
confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), and multigroup structural
equation modeling (multigroup SEM) to the Mini-K (the 20-
item short form of the ALHB) in three studies of undergraduate
students. Specifically, Study I applies ESEM to a sample of
undergraduate students to examine the structure of the Mini-K;
Study II uses CFA to confirm the structure identified in Study
II; and Study III uses multigroup SEM to test for (a) measure-
ment invariance between the samples (and pools them if invar-
iance is found), (b) a higher order K-factor, (c) measurement
invariance between the sexes, and (d) associations of the Mini-
K with indicators of harshness and mating competition (e.g.,
risk-taking). Examining the associations between the Mini-K
and indicators of mating competition allows us to assess
whether K (if indeed the scale is unidimensional) should be
conceptualized as overall life history speed. We examine these
associations separately by sex, allowing for the possibility that
any factors underlying the Mini-K have different correlates
within each.
Finally, across the confirmatory studies (II and III), we
examine the degree to which the assumption of local indepen-
dence holds for the Mini-K items. Measurement invariance and
local independence are two assumptions that can be tested to
establish the usefulness of latent variables (Brown, 2006;
Edwards & Bagozzi, 2000). First, a latent variable must explain
the associations among its indicators, rendering them (locally)
independent conditional upon it. Second, the associations
between the latent variable and its indicators must be stable
across the distribution of external variables. If these assump-
tions are not at least partially met, a latent variable cannot be
understood as the common cause of its indicators or as having a
unique identity.
General Methods
Participants and Procedures
The studies reported here analyzed data from two samples of
college students in a large Midwestern university. The project
was granted approval through a university-based institutional
review board, and participants were recruited through their
classes, both online and face-to-face, as well as through a sub-
ject pool. Participants did not receive any form of incentive for
their participation. Students read an information form, pro-
vided consent, and subsequently completed a questionnaire.
Overall, the participants sampled were relatively diverse with
respect to socioeconomic status (SES). More than 20% of the
students at the university we sampled from were first-
generation college students, suggesting the institution served
an economically diverse student body. Moreover, 58 (8.8%)
had primary childhood residence total household incomes
below US$25,000 (the 2013 poverty line for a two-child family
was *US$24,000, Federal Interagency Forum on Child and
Family Statistics, 2015), 63 (9.5%) reported that their families
were worse off financially than most, 244 (36.9%) reported that
their father had a high school level education or less, and 199
(30.1%) reported the same for mother's educational attainment
(the U.S. percentage for both mothers and fathers in 2013 was
30%, Kena et al., 2015). More detailed demographics for each
sample are reported in Study I and Study II.
Instruments
Mini-K. The Mini-K is a 20-item brief scale designed to measure
the domains captured by the ALHB (Figueredo et al., 2006).
These domains include (a) family social contact and support;
(b) friends social contact and support; (c) altruism; (d) mother/
father relationship quality; (e) insight, planning, and control; (f)
intentions toward infidelity; and (g) religiosity. Two to three
items reflect each of these constructs (e.g., item contents, see
Table 1). For this study, we eliminated the third and fifth
Likert-type points (disagree and agree slightly) from the
Mini-K to include it within a broader survey that used 5-
point scales and machine scoring. This was acceptable because
the psychometric properties of 5- and 6- or 7-point Likert-type
scales do not differ substantively and can be easily rescaled for
comparison (Dawes, 2008; Leung, 2011).
The Mini-K has demonstrated adequate internal consistency
in past research (i.e., coefficient as around .70; see Olderbak,
2 Evolutionary Psychology
Gladden, Wolf, & Figueredo, 2014). However, decades of
research have indicated that the usefulness of coefficient a is
quite limited and its assumptions rarely hold in practice (for
reviews, see Bentler, 2009; Sijtsma, 2009). Relevant to this
study, coefficient a does not provide any information about
internal structure and therefore cannot justify scoring proce-
dures that assume scale unidimensionality (Sijtsma, 2009). In
light of this, we used factor analysis to assess dimensionality
and observed the magnitude of the factor loadings for informa-
tion about reliability and validity. Descriptive statistics and a
coefficients for the Mini-K are reported in Study I and Study II.
Missing Data
Prior to conducting our studies, we screened each data set for
outliers, missing values, and violations of the assumptions of
factor analysis. No evidence of outliers or skew statistics larger
than two were observed. The percentage of data missing for the
variables in the studies ranged from 2.7% to 9.7%. We handled
each set's missing data using full information maximum like-
lihood via the MPlus 7.11 package (see Enders, 2010).
Analyses
All studies reported here used MPlus 7.11 to test models, raw
data as input, and robust weighted least squares (WLSMV) as
the estimator because the Mini-K is comprised of ordinal
Likert-type items (Muth´
en, du Toit, & Spisic, 1997). We
observed that the ratio of cases to freely estimated parameters
exceeded 10 to 1 for all hypothesized models, satisfying the
minimum ratio often indicated for SEM studies (Bentler &
Chou, 1987). Following convention, we conducted all signifi-
cance tests at the p < .05 level. We used b ¼ .30 as the threshold
for retaining items and interpreting factor loadings (Kline,
2011).
Model Fit
Across the studies, we used a variety of fit indices because they
provide different information about model fit. We considered
the substantive meaningfulness of the model, nonsignificance
of the w2 likelihood ratio statistic (Bollen, 1989), Tucker­
Lewis index (TLI) and comparative fit index (CFI) greater than
.95 (Byrne, 2001; Hu & Bentler, 1999), and root means square
error of approximation (RMSEA) values of less than .05
(Browne & Cudeck, 1993) as evidence of acceptable fit to the
data. In this study, we needed to test differences in fit between
models for statistical significance. Importantly, the w2 value for
WLSMV cannot be used for difference testing in the usual way.
In this context, w2 difference testing is carried out via the
DIFFTEST function in MPlus.
Study I
Sample
Study I analyzed data from 361 undergraduate students. Most
participants were aged 18 to 22 (91.9%, 
x ¼ 20.07, SD ¼ 2.66)
and they were 78.4% White, 13.3% African American, 3.0%
Hispanic, 2.8% Asian, and 2.5% Other. In terms of sex, 41.3%
were male and 58.7% were female, while 22.4% were fresh-
man, 45.2% were sophomores, 23.3% were juniors, and 9.1%
were seniors.
ESEM
We used ESEM to examine and test the structure of the Mini-K.
ESEM is especially useful for exploratory factor analysis
(EFA) because unlike traditional procedures, it produces fit
statistics that can be used to assess model correspondence to
the data. For our ESEM analyses, we used delta parameteriza-
tion and oblique rotations (Geomin). We began by specifying a
single-factor model and then compared it to models with
increasing numbers of factors, ceasing when model fit was
observed as excellent (using the model fit statistics outlined
above).
Results
As a reminder, these analyses examined data gathered with the
Mini-K short-form version of the ALHB. We used ESEM to
test a single-factor model and found that it fit the data poorly
and should have been rejected, w2(170) ¼ 1,065.17, p < .001;
CFI ¼ .79; TLI ¼ .76; RMSEA ¼ .12. We then tested two- and
three-factor models and these fit the data poorly as well (for fit
information, see Table 1). Four- and five-factor models fit the
data better but only CFI met its commonly accepted threshold
for good fit (i.e., .95). A six-factor model fit the data even
better, with CFI indicating a very good fit and TLI and RMSEA
falling just below their thresholds for good fit. We observed
that 3 items (1 ¼ I can often tell how things will turn out, 9 ¼ I
have a close and warm relationship with my sexual partner,
and 10 ¼ I have a close and warm relationship with my own
children) did not load substantially on any factors (bs < .30).
No modification indices suggested that these items should be
linked with other items or Mini-K factors. Thus, we removed
these 3 items and the resulting model had an excellent fit to the
data, w2(49) ¼ 61.97, p ¼ .10; CFI ¼ 1.00; TLI ¼ .99; RMSEA
¼ .03. Given the nonsignificant w2, we did not reject the

hypothesis that this model fit the data exactly and accepted it as
the best reproducer of the relationships among the items.
Next, we interpreted the factor identities, loadings, and
intercorrelations. Table 2 displays the items, their contents, and
loadings that were b > .30. Factors 1 through 4 mapped onto the
prespecified identities noted in Instruments. We did not find
altruism, intentions toward infidelity, or religiousness factors.
Although individual items tapping these domains are or seem
to be included in the Mini-K, it does not appear to be the case
that the first-order structure underlying the items corresponds
to these constructs. Instead, we found harm avoidance and
community involvement factors. Notably, Item 12 (I have to
be closely attached to someone before I am comfortable having
sex with them) reflected harm avoidance and community invol-
vement. This makes theoretical sense, given that harm avoid-
ance should correspond to lesser sexual risk-taking and sexual
constraint is also normative in many communities, especially
religious ones. Also, Item 19 (I am closely connected to and
involved in my community) reflected both friend contact/sup-
port and community involvement. This makes sense because
friends are found outside of the home environment or in the
community.
Next, we interpreted the factor intercorrelations (see
Table 3). We found that the overall pattern of relationships
among the factors did not suggest a higher order common
factor subsumed them. The relational factors (i.e., 2, 3, and
4) were significantly and moderately correlated, suggesting
they might share a higher order social support factor. Family
social contact/support was significantly related to all the Mini-
K factors. However, each of the other factors was not signifi-
cantly related to at least two other factors, and community
involvement was only significantly related to family social
contact/support.
Discussion
In Study I, we used ESEM to examine the structure of the
Mini-K and found that a six-factor solution best fit the data.
We found insight, planning, and control; mother/father rela-
tionship quality; friend social contact/support; family social
contact/support; harm avoidance; and community involvement
factors. Importantly, these factors mapped onto constructs that
have been theoretically and empirically tied to human LHS in
the past (Figueredo et al., 2006; Olderbak et al., 2014; Richard-
son, Dariotis, & Lai, 2016; Richardson, Sanning, et al., 2016).
We observed a pattern of factor intercorrelations that suggested
a social support factor likely subsumed the relational factors
(e.g., mother/father relationship quality, friend social contact/
support), but several other correlations were nonsignificant and
community involvement was only significantly related to fam-
ily social contact/support. This suggests that a general LHS
factor was unlikely to subsume all the factors, but we address
this issue directly in Study III. One possibility is that some

correlations were nonsignificant because the ESEM model
allows each item to load on all factors and therefore cross-
loadings may capture some of the between factor covariance.
Study II
Sample
Study II analyzed data from 300 undergraduate students. Most
participants were aged 18 to 35 (96%, 
x ¼ 19.34, SD ¼ 2.65)
and their ethnicities were 81.3% White, 11.7% African Amer-
ican, 2.3% Hispanic, 2.0% Asian, and 2.7% Other. In all, 40%
were male and 60% female, 55.3% freshman, 24.7% sopho-
more, 13.7% junior, and 6.3% senior.
CFA
We used CFA to test the Mini-K structure found in Study I. In
contrast to ESEM, CFA models encode specific assumptions
about associations between items and between items and fac-
tors. The first is local independence, or the assumption that
indicators are independent conditional on their factor. The con-
figuration of indicators or specific factors they reflect or load
upon is also specified a priori. Model fit is examined to deter-
mine whether assumptions hold.
Results
We tested the six-factor model found in Study I using our
second sample and CFA. Fit indices suggested this model fit
the data very well, w2(102) ¼ 197.22, p < .001; CFI ¼ .97;
TLI ¼ .96; RMSEA ¼ .06, though the w2 test was significant.
We observed that Item 6 (I avoid taking risks) did not load
significantly on its factor (harm avoidance). No modifications
indices suggested this item should be linked to other items or
Mini-K factors. Thus, we dropped it prior to further analysis.
We also observed that Item 12 (I have to be closely attached to
someone before I am comfortable having sex with them) did not
load substantially on community involvement (b ¼ .16),
though it loaded acceptably on its other factor, harm avoidance
(b ¼ .68). We removed this item's first loading and the result-
ing model fit the data very well, w2(88) ¼ 152.84, p < .001; CFI
¼ .98; TLI ¼ .97; RMSEA ¼ .05. Now that two of the three
harm avoidance items concerned pairing off with one partner
and getting to know them before having sex, we changed the
factor's name to pair-bonding. No relatively large modification
indices were observed; suggesting no areas of strain existed for
this model. Thus, we accepted it as the best reproducer of the
relationships among our variables.
Next, we interpreted the magnitude of the factor loadings
and intercorrelations (see Tables 4 and 5). All loadings were
larger than b ¼ .30 except for the Item 5 (I often make plans in
advance) loading on pair-bonding, suggesting they reflected
their factors adequately. The Item 5 loading was near b ¼
.30 and in Study I it was larger than b ¼ .40. Thus, we retained
it as an indicator of pair-bonding. In contrast to Study I, all
factor correlations were statistically significant (ps < .05), rang-
ing from small to large in size.
Discussion
In Study II, we replicated the Mini-K structure we found in
Study I, with the exceptions that Item 6 did not reflect its factor
and Item 12 reflected only pair-bonding. We were thus able to
confirm that six factors subsumed the Mini-K items, including
insight, planning, and control; mother/father relationship qual-
ity; friend social contact/support; family social contact/support;
pair-bonding; and community involvement. Local indepen-
dence held for all of the Mini-K items. Moreover, we found
some weak factor intercorrelations, suggesting a second-order
K-factor might not subsume the six first-order factors, but we
return to this possibility in Study III. Taken together, Studies I
and II suggest that the Mini-K items reflect six life history
domains consistent with LHT, though not all were those pre-
specified in the literature.
Study III
In Study III, we (a) pooled our samples given evidence of
measurement invariance and demographic similarity, (b) tested
for a higher order K-factor, (c) tested for measurement invar-
iance across the sexes, and (d) examined the Mini-K's nomo-
logical net. As a reminder, we examined the Mini-K's
nomological net to assess whether the data seemed consistent
with a single LHS dimension.
Sample
This study pooled the Studies I and II samples. This was accep-

invariance with respect to the Mini-K and also because w2 tests
revealed that the samples did not differ significantly in terms
of sex, w2(40) ¼ 44.53, p ¼ .287, and ethnicity, w2(58) ¼ 60.90,
p ¼ .372. We did observe, however, that the Study II sample
was significantly younger, t(659) ¼ 3.5, p < .001, consistent
with its larger proportion of freshman (55.3%) compared with
Study I (22.4%). Given that the age range was not large, along
with the other observed similarities between the samples, we
proceeded with pooling them.
Instruments
Study III used several additional scales to examine the
Mini-K's nomological net, including measures of risk-taking,
impulsivity, substance use, and SES. We included risk-taking
and substance use because these variables have reflected
mating competition in past research (e.g., Richardson, Sanning,
et al., 2016). We included impulsivity because it has been
linked to indicators of mating competition (e.g., sensation seek-
ing or reward sensitivity; Richardson, Freedlander, & Katz,
2014). We included SES as an indicator of environmental
harshness (see Ellis, Figueredo, Brumbach, & Schlomer,
2009). To incorporate these scales into our model, we used
EFA and maximum likelihood to examine them for unidimen-
sionality and saved factor scores using Bartlett's method.
Risk-taking. The Risk-Taking Scale included 3 items rated on 5-
point Likert scales (not at all true of me to very true of me). The
item contents were: I don't mind taking risks, I like doing scary
things, and I love exciting experiences. These items were uni-
dimensional and loaded on their factor at b ¼ .69, .59, and .48,
respectively.
Impulsivity. The Impulsivity scale included 4 items adapted from
the impulsiveness subscale of the revised NEO personality
inventory (NEO-PI­R; Lord, 2007; Whiteside & Lynam,
2001). These were rated on 5-point Likert-type scales (not at
all true of me to very true of me) and their item contents were, I
frequently act on strong feelings, Sometimes my feelings lead
me to do things I don't like, When I experience extreme emo-
tions I tend to act before thinking, and Sometimes I can't stop
what I'm doing because of intense feelings. These items were
unidimensional and loaded on their factor at b ¼ .47, .60, .71,
and .64, respectively.
SES. SES is in important indicator of environmental harshness
(Ellis et al., 2009) and student SES is traditionally indexed
using parental income, educational attainment, and occupa-
tional status (National Center for Education Statistics [NCES],
2012). In this study, we used 3 items to measure SES. The first
2 items asked participants to report the highest degree earned
by their parents. Participants responded on 5-point scales that
included none, general educational development test or high
school diploma, associate/junior college, bachelor's degree, or
master's degree, PhD, or professional degree. The final item
required participant estimation of the total household income
for their primary childhood residence using the points US$1­
$10,000, US$10,001­$25,000, US$25,001­$50,000,
US$50,001­$100,000, or more than US$100,000. Because
most studies have not unpacked the effects of specific SES
components on dimensions of LHS, initially we did not form
composite SES in this study, but instead included each SES
variable in our model. This allowed us to examine, for instance,
whether (a) income had different effects than education, (b)
mother and father education level had different effects, and
(c) SES effects on LHS might be attributable to particular
variables. We also repeated our analyses using a traditional
composite SES variable for comparison.
Substance use. To assess substance use, we used the frequency
of recent use items (i.e., past 3 months) from the Alcohol,
Smoking, and Substance Involvement Screening Test
(ASSIST; WHO ASSIST Working Group, 2002). The ASSIST
consists of eight questions that measure lifetime substance use,
recent use frequency, use-related consequences, risk of harm,
dependence, and intravenous drug use. Each question addresses
nine substance categories including tobacco, alcohol, cannabis,

cocaine, amphetamine, inhalants, sedatives, hallucinogens,
opioids, and other. The recent use items have 5 points--never,
once or twice, monthly, weekly, and daily or almost daily. In
past research, the recent use subscale has demonstrated ade-
quate internal consistency (i.e., as greater than .80) and con-
current validity (e.g., a large correlation with the Addiction
Severity Index [r ¼ .84]; Humeniuk, 2006). In this study, the
ASSIST frequency of use items were two dimensional. Socially
accepted substance use subsumed use of tobacco (b ¼ .56),
alcohol (b ¼ .48), and cannabis (b ¼ .61), whereas socially
unacceptable substance use subsumed use of cocaine (b ¼ .89),
amphetamines (b ¼ .64), inhalants (b ¼ .80), sedatives (b ¼
.52), hallucinogens (b ¼ .86), and opioids (b ¼ .67). Cannabis
use also cross-loaded on the second factor (b ¼ .42). The
factors were correlated at r ¼ .41. We saved scores on both
factors for use in our SEM.
Multigroup SEM. This study used multigroup SEM to test
whether the Study I and II samples were invariant with
respect to the Mini-K. Specifically, we tested the Mini-K
for metric (i.e., same factor loadings) and scalar (i.e., same
intercepts) invariance across the samples. If found, metric
invariance implies that constructs measured by a set of
items have the same meaning across groups, whereas scalar
invariance implies that between-group differences in latent
variable means can be interpreted. Given evidence of mea-
surement invariance, we pooled the two samples to achieve
a larger sample size, which enabled us to test the Mini-K for
measurement invariance across the sexes. Prior to invar-
iance testing by sex, however, we tested for a higher order
K-factor in the pooled sample. If a higher order K-factor
was consistent with the data, we tested for first-order and
higher order metric and scalar invariance across the sexes.
This enabled us to determine whether the two sexes attrib-
uted the same meaning to the K-factor and whether mean
sex differences on this factor could be interpreted. Finally,
we examined the Mini-K's nomological net separately by
sex, assessing for sex differences in the extent to which K
(or whatever factors subsumed it) reflected SES and in the
extent to which it (or they) appeared to subsume the indi-
cators of mating competition.
Results
Cross-Sample Invariance Testing
We used multigroup SEM to test our Study II model for con-
figural invariance (i.e., same items load on same factors)
across the two samples to produce baseline statistics for our
tests of invariance. We found that the configural model fit the
data very well, w2(176) ¼ 313.73, p < .001; CFI ¼ .98; TLI ¼
.97; RMSEA ¼ .05, though the w2 test suggested it did not fit
exactly. No modification indices were relatively large, sug-
gesting no areas of strain existed. Thus, we then constrained
all factor loadings and thresholds to equality across the sam-
ples, testing for metric and scalar invariance. This model did
not fit the data significantly worse than the configural (base-
line) model, Dw2(52) ¼ 68.09, p ¼ .07, indicating that the
Mini-K measured the same constructs across the two samples.
Therefore, we pooled the samples to allow for invariance
testing by sex.
Higher Order K-Factor
Before testing for measurement invariance by sex, we investi-
gated the possibility that a higher order K-factor subsumed the
first-order Mini-K factors in the pooled sample. To test this
possibility, we first tested the Study II model with no higher
order factors to attain baseline statistics for comparison. This
six-factor model fit the data very well, w2(104) ¼ 270.99, p <
.001; CFI ¼ .98; TLI ¼ .97; RMSEA ¼ .05, though the w2 test
suggested the model did not fit the data exactly. Modification
indices suggested no areas of strain existed for this model.
Thus, we then specified a higher order social support factor
that subsumed the relational factors (e.g., friend social con-
tact/support) because their intercorrelations were larger than
the others. This resulting model did not fit the data significantly
worse than the baseline model, Dw2(6) ¼ 11.30, p ¼ .08, sug-
gesting that the higher order social support factor provided
parsimony at no expense to fit. Next, we specified a higher
order K-factor that subsumed the social support factor and
insight, planning, and control; pair-bonding; and community
involvement. We tested this model and it also did not fit sig-
nificantly worse than the baseline model, Dw2(8) ¼ 14.14, p ¼
.08, suggesting that the higher order K-factor provided addi-
tional parsimony at no cost to model correspondence to the
data. Thus, we retained the model with the higher order
K-factor (see Figure 1).
Figure 1. Higher order structure of the Mini-K.
Richardson et al. 7
Finally, we interpreted the magnitudes of the second-order
loadings on the K-factor and found that they were all large (see
Figure 1 and Table 6), ranging from b ¼ .54 to .69. The R2
statistics were higher order social support factor (.40); insight,
planning, and control (.29); pair-bonding (.47); and community
involvement (.44). Thus, the higher order K-factor appeared to
not only provide a parsimonious explanation of the covariance
among the lower order factors but also explained substantial
amounts of their variance.
Invariance Testing by Sex
We next tested the six-factor (baseline) model for configural
invariance by sex and it fit the data for both sexes very well,
w2(176) ¼ 346.18, p < .001; CFI ¼ .97; TLI ¼ .96; RMSEA ¼
.05, though the significant w2 test suggested it did not fit exactly.
Modification indices suggested no areas of strain existed for this
model. Thus, we constrained all factor loadings and thresholds to
equality across the sexes and the resulting model fit significantly
worse than the configural model according to the w2 difference
test, Dw2(52) ¼ 74.28, p ¼ .02. However, the other fit indices did
not change by more than .01 except for TLI, which was actually
.01 higher (i.e., TLI ¼ .97) and implied a better fit. Taken
together, we reasoned that the fit information could be inter-
preted as signaling that the loadings and thresholds were invar-
iant across the sexes. That is, the Mini-K appeared to measure
the same first-order constructs in males and females.
Next, we tested the higher order factor model for invariance
by constraining the higher order loadings on social support and
the K-factor to equality across the sexes. Similar to the first-
order scalar model, this model fit significantly worse than the
baseline model according to the w2 test difference test, Dw2(73)
¼ 100.26, p ¼ .02.1 However, the other fit indices did not
change by more than .01 except for TLI, which was .01 higher
(i.e., TLI ¼ .97). We next constrained the first-order factor
intercepts to equality across the groups and fit was significantly
worse, Dw2(78) ¼ 202.35, p < .001, with both CFI and TLI
decreasing by greater than .01. We found that although fit
remained significantly poorer if we constrained all intercepts
to equality except insight, planning, and control; mother/father
relationship quality; and pair-bonding, Dw2(75) ¼ 116.28, p <
.001, it was not substantively poorer in that CFI did not change
by .01 and TLI was .01 higher (better). We observed that the
insight, planning, and control intercept and the intercept for
mother/father relationship quality were significantly higher
among males, whereas the pair-bonding intercept was signifi-
cantly higher among females (ps < .05). Thus, we concluded
that the Mini-K appeared to measure the same higher order
constructs across the sexes but only the social support factors
were scalar invariant. Finally, we constrained the residuals for
the six first-order factors and the higher order social support
factor to equality across the groups and the discrepancy in fit,
compared to the baseline model, was very similar to that
observed for the first-order scalar model, Dw2(82) ¼ 111.05,
p ¼ .02. Thus, the first-order and higher order social support
residuals appeared to be invariant by sex. Moreover, the situ-
ation was the same for a model that also included an equality
constraint on the male and female K-factor variances, Dw2(83)
¼ 110.47, p ¼ .02. That is, similar to the first-order factor
residuals, the K-factor's variance did not appear to be statisti-
cally different across the sexes.

the final scalar model described above (see Figure 2). We
regressed the K-factor onto mother and father education, along
with family income. We regressed risk-taking, impulsivity, and
substance use onto the K-factor. We tested this model and it fit
marginally well, w2(493) ¼ 846.94, p < .001; CFI ¼ .95; TLI ¼
.94; RMSEA ¼ .05. We examined modification indices and
several were relatively large (>20) and suggested that we
should regress socially acceptable substance use on friend
social contact/support and pair-bonding for females only. We
added these additional specifications and the resulting model fit
the data well, w2(491) ¼ 806.92, p < .001; CFI ¼ .95; TLI ¼
.95; RMSEA ¼ .04. No remaining modification indices were
relatively large, suggesting areas of strain did not exist and this
model was an acceptable reproducer of the relationships among
the variables.
For males, no SES variable had a statistically significant
effect on the K-factor, though household income appeared to
have an effect that was nontrivial in size (b ¼ .17, p ¼ .08). The
effects of K on risk-taking and impulsivity were nonsignificant,
though the effect on risk-taking also seemed to be nontrivial in
size (b ¼ .13, p ¼ .08). K had a small positive and significant
negative effect on socially acceptable substance use (b ¼ À.26,
p < .001) as well as a moderate negative effect on socially
unacceptable substance use (b ¼ À.46, p < .001). For males,
the model explained 7% of the variance in socially acceptable
substance use and 21% of the variance in socially unacceptable
substance use.
For females, mother's education (b ¼ .18, p < .05) and
household income (b ¼ .21, p < .01) had statistically significant
effects on K (for all parameter estimates, see Supplementary
Materials). The K-factor had a small significant and positive
effect on risk-taking (b ¼ .18, p < .01) and a small negative
effect on impulsivity (b ¼ À.13, p < .05). K had a small sig-
nificant negative effect on socially acceptable substance use (b
¼ À.26, p < .001) as well as a large negative effect on socially
unacceptable substance use (b ¼ À.53, p < .001). Finally,
friend social contact/support had a moderate positive effect
on socially acceptable substance use (b ¼ .29, p < .001), while
pair-bonding had a moderate negative effect on this variable (b
¼ À.37, p < .01). For females, the model explained 28% of the
variance in each type of substance use as well as 3% of the
variance in risk-taking and 2% in impulsivity. The pattern of
results was the same for a model that included an SES compo-
site instead of the individual mother/father education and
income variables. This model fit the data well, w2(405) ¼
694.62, p < .001; CFI ¼ .96; TLI ¼ .96; RMSEA ¼ .05, and
SES had a small and significant positive effect on K for females
(b ¼ .21, p < .01) but not males (p ¼ .56).
Discussion
Our results suggest that the Mini-K measures the same first-
order constructs across the sexes (i.e., they have the same
meaning) and mean differences on the six first-order factors

can be interpreted because the item intercepts are invariant
across the groups. At the higher order level, the Mini-K appears
to measure the same K-factor across the sexes, but mean group
differences on K cannot be interpreted because the first-order
latent variable intercepts are not invariant. Specifically, we
observed that the insight, planning, and control intercept, along
with the intercept for mother/father relationship quality, were
significantly higher among males, whereas the pair-bonding
intercept was significantly higher among females. Thus, the
K-factor appears to be more useful for examination of structure
than mean differences. This holds important implications for
future research. If researchers compare K-factor means across
the sexes, they may draw erroneous inferences about sex dif-
ferences. On the other hand, inferences about effects on or
emitted by the K-factor are less likely to be problematic.
Finally, we found that the first-order and higher order factor
residuals and the K-factor variances were invariant by sex. This
is surprising from an evolutionary perspective, as we would
expect larger variances in reproductive strategies among males
(Copping et al., 2014).
In our assessment of the Mini-K's associations with some
external criteria, we found that aspects of SES (mother's edu-
cation and income, specifically) only related to K among
females. This is an interesting finding and suggests that future
studies should test for differential effects of environmental
components by sex. Perhaps female calibration of LHS is more
sensitive to environment and characteristics of mothers in par-
ticular. K was only significantly related to risk-taking and
impulsivity among females, and the effect sizes were small.
Although the available selection of mating competition indica-
tors was quite limited, these findings are consistent with evi-
dence that the K-factor is unique from mating competition and
does not subsume indicators such as sensation seeking, risk-
taking, reward dependency, aggression, delinquency, and num-
ber of sexual partners (Richardson, Dariotis, & Lai, 2016;
Richardson, Sanning, et al., 2016). K had significant effects
on both substance use factors in males and females. These
findings are consistent with evidence that substance use reflects
mating competition (þ) and also K (À) (Richardson, Dariotis,
& Lai, 2016; Richardson, Sanning, et al., 2016).
In males and females, the assumption of local independence
held for the Mini-K items and the first-order factors. The items
were independent conditional on their first-order factors, and in
turn, the first-order factors were independent conditional on
Social support and ultimately, the K-factor. For males, local
homogeneity (i.e., all relevant information about indicators is
provided by their factor) held for the items and factors, but
among females, this was not the case for all of the first-order
factors. Friend social contact/support and pair-bonding had
moderate effects on socially acceptable substance use, holding
K constant, suggesting that something unique (from K) about
the tendency to form close intimate relationships provided pro-
tection from heightened substance use among females, whereas
the opposite was the case for the unique effect of greater sup-
port from friends. Given that the selection of criterion indica-
tors was limited in this study, more research is needed to
determine how useful this factor is in terms of explaining asso-
ciations between the first-order factors and external constructs.
For now, our findings suggest K holds promise in that it
explains well the associations among its first-order factors and
demonstrates measurement invariance by sex as well as
explains some associations between its first-order factors and
external variables.
Overall Discussion
More than 30 studies have employed the Mini-K despite sev-
eral salient unknowns. First, the internal structure of the scale
had not been determined and it was not clear that a higher order
K-factor fit the data. Stemming from this, no studies had estab-
lished that Mini-K items were independent conditional on their
factors and that these factors themselves were independent
conditional on the K-factor. Similarly, no studies had shown
that the K-factor explained first-order Mini-K factor associa-
tions with external variables. It was also not clear that the Mini-
K measured the same constructs across the sexes or other
groups, or that mean Mini-K differences across such groups
could be interpreted.
The first major contribution of these studies is evidence that
the Mini-K has a six-dimensional first-order structure including
insight, planning, and control; mother/father relationship qual-
ity; friend social contact/support; family social contact/support;
pair-bonding; and community involvement factors. The second
major contribution is evidence that the K-factor provided a
parsimonious explanation of the associations among the lower
order factors at no significant cost to fit. Third, local indepen-
dence held for the Mini-K items and their first-order factors, as
did metric invariance across the sexes. Fourth, the K-factor
means did not have the same meaning across the sexes and
thus the first-order factors should be used in studies of mean
sex differences. The final major contribution is evidence that
the K-factor may be more sensitive to environment and more
related to aspects of mating competition among females.
These findings suggest the K-factor may be scored to sum-
marize participants' locations on the Mini-K first-order factors
and items. From a realist perspective, these findings are con-
sistent with the notion that the K-factor is a real variable with a
unique identity. From a descriptivist perspective, the K-factor
can be seen as a useful description of its indicators. These
findings also suggest that although mean sex differences in
dimensions of LHS may be typical in humans, the structure
of LHS may be invariant across the sexes. However, we note
that the variances on the Mini-K first-order and higher-order
factors did not differ by sex, which is surprising from an evolu-
tionary perspective.
The K-factor did not appear to subsume our two indicators
of mating competition (risk-taking and impulsivity). It did have
effects on substance use, but this has reflected K and mating
competition in other research (Richardson, Dariotis, & Lai,
2016; Richardson, Sanning, et al., 2016). This study provides
some limited support to the body of recent evidence indicating
that the K-factor does not capture overall life history speed, but
10 Evolutionary Psychology
rather one dimension of a multidimensional human LHS.
Another unique dimension of LHS, which Richardson, San-
ning, et al. (2016) found to be statistically independent of
Super-K, is mating competition. Much more research is needed
to confirm the existence of mating competition and K dimen-
sions of human LHS as well as determine to what extent these
dimensions are invariant by sex, race/ethnicity, developmental
stage, and other groups. More research is also needed to exam-
ine whether our finding that K is related to SES only among
females is robust.
Limitations
This study is limited by the use of self-report data and it is
widely recognized that such data can be affected by error in
the retrieval processes associated with memory and self-
presentation bias. This limitation applies most significantly to
the retrospective SES measures. Second, causal inferences
based on the results presented here should remain tentative.
Environment cannot be understood as completely exogenous
to young adult LHS due to genetic inheritance. Future research
should use genetic information and longitudinal data to address
this limitation. Such studies may provide important informa-
tion about whether LHS development is conditional and/or
alternative. Relatedly, in this study, we did not address the
appropriateness of specifying childhood quality of relation-
ships with parents (Factor 2) as a reflective indicator of K.
This specification assumes K is time invariant and could have
caused aspects of childhood and young adulthood. This may
not be a realistic assumption and therefore researchers should
use longitudinal data to test it. In any case, researchers may
elect to simply specify Factor 2 as a predictor of K to avoid
this issue.
Future studies should also test the structure and invar-
iance of the Mini-K using more representative samples,
given that college students are unique in some ways. For
instance, it is possible that college students are restricted in
range on the K-factor indicators. Although other research
suggests this may not be a problem (Figueredo et al.,
2014), perhaps it could explain our surprising finding that
the K-factor variances for males and females were not sig-
nificantly different. It is also possible that the structure of
the Mini-K varies across development, as suggested above,
and thus it will be important to test its structure and nomo-
logical net using data from other stages including middle
adulthood. Finally, the data used in this study were col-
lected as part of a larger parent study of perceptions of
substance abusers and unfortunately, we were not able to
collect more information about environment or indicators of
mating competition (e.g., sensation seeking, delinquency,
number of sexual partners) that could have been very help-
ful in establishing the validity of the K-factor. We were also
not able to collect data on external validity criteria such as
pubertal timing, parental investment, and longevity. It will
be important for future studies to address the connection
between the K-factor and traditional life history events.
Recommendations
Given that the measurement invariance of the Mini-K has not
yet been adequately confirmed, we recommend that researchers
use multigroups CFA to test for configural, metric, and scalar
invariance by sex or across other groups wherever sample sizes
permit. Although it may not be appropriate to sum each of the
Mini-K domains and use the scores in subsequent analyses,
evidence suggests that in the context of CFA, 2 or 3 items can
be sufficient to locate the correct construct (Little, Lindenber-
ger, & Nesselrhoade, 1999). Thus, in addition to using the
Mini-K to locate and perhaps score the K-factor, researchers
may use it in CFA models to study the behavior of its first-order
factors and test whether their correlates vary across groups.
If multigroups CFA is not feasible, we recommend that
researchers avoid drawing conclusions on the basis of mean
sex differences in Mini-K scale scores. However, our findings
suggest that examination of sex by Mini-K scale score interac-
tion effects (or sex by predictor interaction effects on Mini-K
scores) should not be problematic, though more work is needed
to replicate our findings. We also recommend that researchers
include indicators of mating competition in their studies, so that
the broader dimensionality of human life history indicators can
be assessed. If human LHS is not unidimensional, this implies
that the Mini-K should not be used as the sole measure of LHS
in studies testing hypotheses rooted in LHT. Finally, we hope
that future studies will also test for associations between
Mini-K scores and traditional life history events (e.g., pubertal
timing) to better establish construct validity.
