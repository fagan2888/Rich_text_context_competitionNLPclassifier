Research Questions
Interest rate risks in banks arise if the fixed interest periods of their assets differ from
the ones of their liabilities. This paper is about the question of why banks bear interest
rate risk in the first place, because banks could completely hedge this risk with suitable
derivatives.
Contribution
It is often said that the bearing of interest rate risk is a part of the banking business
and that ­ at least in the past ­ credit and interest rate risk could not be completely
separated when granting loans. In this paper, two additional reasons are given, namely a
long optimization horizon of a part of the banks and the hedging of earning risks arising
from a decline of the interest rate level. In an empirical study for the banks in Germany,
we try to check the validity of the two additional reasons.
Results
In the study, we find empirical evidence that banks with a longer optimization horizon
bear more interest rate risk. Moreover, banks seem to bear interest rate risk in order to
hedge earnings risk resulting from a decline in the interest rate level. The stronger a bank
is exposed to the earnings risk, the higher its exposure to interest rate risk is.
Nichttechnische Zusammenfassung
Fragestellung
Zinsänderungsrisiken bei Banken entstehen, wenn die Zinsbindungsfristen ihrer Vermö-
gensgegenstände von denen ihrer Verbindlichkeiten abweichen. Dieses Papier widmet sich
der Frage, warum Banken überhaupt Zinsänderungsrisiken eingehen, denn sie könnten ja
auch dieses Risiko durch geeignete Finanzderivate vollständig vermeiden.
Beitrag
Es wird häufig gesagt, dass das Eingehen von Zinsänderungsrisiken zum Bankgeschäft ge-
hört und dass ­ zumindest in der Vergangenheit ­ bei der Kreditvergabe das Kredit- und
das Zinsänderungsrisiko nicht vollständig getrennt werden konnten. In dem Papier werden
zwei weitere Gründe für das Eingehen der Zinsänderungsrisiken aufgeführt, nämlich ein
langer Optimierungshorizonts eines Teils der Banken und das Begrenzen von Ertragsrisi-
ken aus einem Fallen des Zinsniveaus. In einer Studie für die Banken in Deutschland wird
die Stichhaltigkeit der zwei zusätzlichen Gründe überprüft.
Ergebnisse
In unserer Studie finden wir empirische Belege dafür, dass eine Bank mit mutmaßlich lan-
gem Planungshorizont höhere Zinsänderungsrisiken eingeht als eine Bank mit mutmaßlich
kurzem Optimierungshorizont. Auch scheinen Banken mit Hilfe der Zinsänderungsrisiken
das Ertragsrisiko aus einem Sinken des Zinsniveaus zu begrenzen: Je stärker eine Bank
diesem Ertragsrisiko ausgesetzt ist, desto höher sind ihre Zinsänderungsrisiken.

Why do banks bear interest rate risk?
Christoph Memmel
Abstract
This paper investigates determinants of banks' structural exposure to interest
rate risk in their banking book. Using bank-level data for German banks, we find
evidence that a bank's exposure to interest rate risk depends on its presumed op-
timization horizon. The longer the presumed optimization horizon is, the more the
bank is exposed to interest rate risk in its banking book. Moreover, there is evi-
dence that banks hedge their earnings risk resulting from falling interest levels with
exposure to interest rate risk. The more a bank is exposed to the risk of a decline
in the interest rate level, the higher its exposure to interest rate risk.

1 Introduction
As a rule, the fixed interest periods of banks' assets do not exactly match those of their
liabilities; the fixed interest periods on the asset side are usually longer than on the
liability side. This mismatch exposes the banks to interest rate risk. Empirically, we
find that interest rate risk is a material risk for many banks, but some banks have very
little exposure to it.1 For instance in Deutsche Bundesbank (2015), it is shown that the
exposure to interest rate risk for an average savings or cooperative bank in Germany is
many times higher than the average exposure of other banks in Germany.
In the past, credit risk could not be easily separated from interest rate risk so that
exposure to this risk, given the long fixed interest periods of housing loans in Germany,
was a byproduct of the loan granting business. Today, since financial instuments to
hedge the interest rate risk are wide-spread, it may be that banks bear this risk because
it is customary, because hedging with interest rate swaps is costly, or in order to avoid
adjustments to their business models and earn the risk premium from term transformation.
Busch and Memmel (2016) show that this risk premium amounted to roughly one third
of the net interest income for the average German bank in 2012 and 2013.
In this paper, two additional reasons for banks' exposure to interest are investigated.
First, interest rate risk differs from other risks, especially in the manner in which it
depends on the horizon: A ten-year government zero-bond is risk-free ­ as long as the
investment horizon is exactly ten years. If this horizon is, say, a month or one year,
the ten-year government zero-bond is risky, not because of its credit risk, but due to its
interest rate risk. Accordingly, a bank may appear to be exposed to interest rate risk if
one looks at the current present value changes of its equity, but from a perspective of a
horizon of several years, it may be exposed to less or even zero interest rate risk. If a bank
has a long optimization horizon, it does not perceive current present value changes of its
equity as a substantial risk. This paper argues that a bank's business model determines
its optimization horizon: Banks with a strong capital market orientation are supposed to
have a short optimization horizon whereas banks with a traditional business model are
expected to have a longer optimization horizon.
Second, interest rate risk may serve a bank for hedging purposes. In the event of a
fall in interest rates, a bank's immediate net interest margins tend to increase, mirroring
present value gains of its equity. However, in the long run, this fall in interest rates is
believed to lead to lower net interest margins. Hence, in the event of a fall in interest rates,
a bank gains as immediate net interest margins rise, but also loses as its long-term net
interest margins deteriorate. A bank can change its exposure to interest rate risk relatively
easily and thereby the extent to which a decrease in the interest rate level benefits its
immediate net interest margins. By contrast, the long-term net interest margin depends
on its asset and liability composition which cannot be adjusted without changing the
bank's business model. If the aim is to stabilize its net interest margin in the mid-term, a
bank may choose a level of interest rate risk such that the positive effect on the mid-term
net interest margins of a fall in the interest rates and the negative effect tend to cancel
each other out, leading to a reduction in the variance of the bank's mid-term net interest
1Note that whenever we refer to the banks' interest rate risk exposure in this paper we have their
interest rate risk in the banking book in mind, i.e. the interest rate risk resulting from the banks'
traditional business and not from their trading activities.

margin. In the current low interest rate environment, where the interest rate level has
been falling for the last years, this argument is echoed. It has been suggested that the
banks in Germany have benefited from loans with relatively high coupons granted in the
past and that these loans, which are maturing now or will do so in the near future, have
delayed the impact of the low interest environment.
The aim of this paper is twofold: First, the argument according to which a bank's
optimization horizon determines its exposure to interest rate risk is theoretically grounded
and, second, empirical evidence is sought concerning the banks' structural exposure to
interest rate risk.
In our empirical study for the German banks for the period 2011Q4 to 2016Q1, we
find evidence that a bank's perception of and exposure to interest rate risk depends on
the presumed optimization horizon. The longer the presumed optimization horizon is,
the more the bank is exposed to interest rate risk in its banking book. Moreover, there
is evidence that banks hedge the earnings risk resulting from falling interest levels with
exposure to interest rate risk: The more a bank is exposed to the risk of a decline in the
interest rate level, the higher its exposure to interest rate risk.
The paper is structured as follows: In Section 2, a brief overview of the literature in
this field is given. The theoretical and empirical models are described in Section 3. In
Section 4, the data that is used is explained and, in Section 5, the empirical results are
given. Section 6 concludes.
2 Literature
This paper contributes to the literature of the banks' strategic choice of their interest rate
risk exposure. To our knowledge, we are the first to theoretically show that the length of
a bank's optimization horizon has an impact on the bank's perception of the risk in its
interest rate risk positions, and, in our study for the German banks, we find empirical
evidence that banks with a presumably longer optimization horizon structurally bear
more interest rate risk, measured by the present value changes in its assets and liabilities.
Moreover, Schrand and Unal (1998) find that US banks have an internal risk budget
that they allocate to the various risks, especially to credit and interest rate risk. In our
empirical study, we find for German Banks as well that they act as if they have an internal
risk budget.
If, for banks, interest rate risk were nothing other than a tradeable market risk, they
would ­ according to the framework of Froot and Stein (1998) ­ completely hedge this
risk. However, the literature on the effects of an interest rate shift on a bank's net
interest margin casts doubt on the assumption that banks' interest rate risk is a completely
tradeable market risk. Especially, the long-run effects of a parallel shift in the term
structure on a bank's net interest margin would be zero if interest rate risk were solely a
tradeable market risk for banks. Alessandri and Nelson (2015) find in a theoretical model
­ and confirm their theoretical results in an empirical study for UK banks ­ that, in the
long run, a bank's net interest margin positively depends on the level of interest rates. In
the short run, however, a rise in interest rates compresses the net interest margin. This
compression is also found in the theoretical model developed by Dell'Ariccia, Laeven, and
Marquez (2014), where a less than complete pass-through to the loan rates is responsible
for the decline in the net interest margin as a consequence of a rise in the interest rate.
2
In his study for ten developed countries, English (2002) finds mixed results concerning
changes in the short and long-term interest rate. By contrast, Albertazzi and Gambacorta
(2009) and Bolt, de Haan, Hoeberichts, Oordt, and Swank (2012) carry out empirical
studies for banks in industrialized countries and find a positive relationship between long-
term interest rates and the banks' net interest income. Claessens, Coleman, and Donnelly
(2017) find in their study for 47 countries that the banks' net interest margins increase by
8 basis points per 100 basis points increase in the interesat rate level. In their empirical
study for the German banking system, Busch and Memmel (2017) also find that, in the
long run, an increase in the interest rate level is beneficial for the banks' net interest
margin. In addition, they find that, in the short run, this increase compresses the net
interest margin. They estimate that the critical horizon where the effect of a change in the
interest rate level is zero is around 1.5 years. All in all, there is theoretical and empirical
evidence that the effect of changes in the interest rate level depends on the horizon: In
the short run, an increase in the interest rate level compresses the net interest margin,
mirroring net present value losses, and in the long run, an increase in the interest rate level
leads to a higher net interest margin, presumably due to a higher long-run pass-through
on the asset side than on the liability side. In our empirical study, we find evidence that
German banks use these differing effects for hedging purposes, meaning that they hedge
the risk of a decline in their far future net interest margin by exposure to interest rate
risk. To our knowledge, we are the first to investigate this issue in an empirical study.
The issue of the banks' exposure to interest rate risk has a structural and a more
tactical aspect. Most of the empirical studies in this field use the time dimension which
has a strong connection to to the tactical aspect (an example of an exception is Angbazo
(1997)). In our paper, we focus on the structural differences between banks, i.e. the
variation in the cross-section of the banks. We do so because it becomes apparent that,
for many bank characteristics, most of the variation is between the banks and not in the
time series.
In this paper, we try to be as exact as possible concerning the notions of interest
rate risk on the one hand and the risk from maturity transformation on the other hand.
Whereas interest rate risk is due to mismatches between the fixed interest periods on a
bank's asset and liability side, the risk from maturity transformation arises from mis-
matches in the capital commitments on the respective sides. Interest rate risk and the
risk from maturity transformation are often bundled together, especially where the fixed
interest periods correspond to the periods of capital commitment. But even then, these
two risks can be separated so that banks with little interest rate risk can be strongly
engaged in maturity transformation as described by Allen and Gale (1997).2
3 Modeling
3.1 General remarks
The general setting of our empirical analyses is a regression to explain a bank's inter-
est rate risk, where we measure the exposure to this risk using the Basel interest rate
2See Vuillemey (2016) for an overview of the banks' bearing of interest rate risk from a macroeconomic
point of view.

coefficient, bic. This coefficient can be seen as a bank's present value losses due to a
standardized interest rate shock, normalized with the bank's equity (see Section 4 for a
detailed description). In the paper, we show that the present value changes are not the
only relevant measure for the banks' interest rate risk exposure. Nevertheless, we opted
for this measure for the following reasons: First, the notion of risk implies that a shock
has an immediate impact, rather than in the distant future as would be the case with
other measures, for instance the long-run change of a bank's net interest margin. Second,
it is objective in the sense that only the current positions of a bank, not its possible
future margins, are accounted for.3 Third, this notion of interest rate risk is prevalent in
the financial markets because, for instance, this risk can be hedged by standard financial
instruments like interest rate swaps. Fourth, the risk measured like this is relevant be-
cause the taking of this risk is remunerated (see Memmel (2011) and Busch and Memmel
(2016)).
To account for the fact that the exposure to interest rate risk may be determined by
slowly changing, structural characteristics, we run a cross-sectional regression. Accord-
ingly, as the explanatory variables mainly concern structural bank characteristics and
therefore have their main variation in the cross section (i = 1, ..., N) and very little or no
variation in the time series (t = 1, ..., T), we use the following regression:
bici
=  + 1
ˇ x1,i
+ ... + N
ˇ xN,i
+ 1
ˇ y1,i
+ ... + M
ˇ yM,i
+ i
(1)
where x1,i
, ..., xN,i
are bank-specific explanatory variables that will be characterized in the
following subsections, and y1,i
, ..., yM,i
are control variables.
In our empirical study, we especially focus on the two additional determinants men-
tioned before, namely the optimization horizon and the hedging of earnings risks. We addi-
tionally include a measure for the entent of credit risk in a bank's assets (x1,i
= rwa_tai
).
The assumption is that banks have an internal risk budget that they allocate to either
credit risk or interest rate risk, neglecting the fact that banks are exposed to other risks
as well. Therefore, we expect the variable x1,i
= rwa_tai
to have a negative association
with the exposure to interest rate risk. As control variables, we use a bank's capital ratio
(y1,i
= CRi
), its size (y2,i
= Si
) and its usage of interest rate swaps (y3,i
= swapi
).
We do not claim to find a causal relationship to explain the level of the banks' interest
rate risk exposure, as we do not have an experiment or other truly exogenous events
at our disposal. Nevertheless, we believe that the explanatory variables are more or less
exogenous (for instance the bank being a savings or cooperative bank), depend on a bank's
location (for instance the bank's credit risk in its assets) or on its structural business
model (for instance the bank products' long-run pass-through and having a trading book)
or seem in other ways more difficult to change than the exposure to interest rate risk (bic),
so that the exposure to interest rate risk is rightly the left-hand variable in the regression
(1) .
3In addition, English (2002) argues that, according to theory, the change in economic (or present)
value should be equal to the present value of the changes in the stream of future net interest incomes.

3.2 Optimization Horizon
Interest rate risk has a special feature that makes it different to other risks, such as credit
risk or stock market risk, namely that the riskiness of an asset non-monotonously depends
on the horizon under consideration: A zero-bond (issued by a debtor of the highest
creditworthiness) with a residual maturity of, say, two years is risk-free if a horizon of two
years is considered, but risky if the horizon is different from two years.4 By contrast, the
risk of a share usually monotonically increase if the horizon becomes longer. An example
of this reasoning is depicted in Figure 1. To some extent, interest rate risk shares features
with currency risk, where an amount in Swiss francs is risky for all investors except the
Swiss ones.
In the following model, we aim to theoretically show that the length of the optimization
horizon impacts the exposure to interest rate risk. In the model, we assume that an
investor can only invest into zero-bonds of different maturities. For the ease of exposition,
we resort to those basic instruments; but the model can be easily extended to portfolios
of bonds so that the asset-liability-structure of banks can be captured. However, for the
reason of keeping the model tractable, we neglect the side constraints that a bank has to

be able to service its debts resulting from the deposits at any point in time.
Let Bt
(s) be the value of a (credit) risk-free zero-bond in time t that pays in time
s one euro. We consider two zero-bonds, namely Bt
(1) and Bt
(2). In t = 0, investor i
distributes his initial wealth W0,i
on the two zero-bonds, where ki
is his holding in the
short-term zero-bond B0
(1). Accordingly, his wealth W1,i
in t = 1 is (with B1

Unlike Diamond and Dybvig (1983), the investor is already certain in t = 0 when he will

t = 2.5 We assume a utility function with constant absolute risk aversion i

concentrate on the model above.

. (11)
for those maximizing their wealth in t = 2. In Equation (11), we apply again the approx-
imation of Equation (7); this time, however, the other way around.
Several statements can be derived from Equations (10) and (11) where we interpret
a higher value of ki
as having a lower exposure to interest rate risk. Note that the
Basel interest rate coefficient bic is approximately proportional to the duration of the
bank's equity (see Appendix 2). One can show that the duration Di
of the zero-bond
portfolio from above can be written as Di
= a - b ˇ ki
where a = 2/(1 + r) and b =
B0
(1)/(W0,i
(1 + r)) are positive constants. First, the demand for short-term bonds for
investors maximizing the expected utility from their wealth in t = 1 can be divided
into a speculation component (namely the first summand) and a hedging component
(kd,1,h
i
= W0,i
/B0
(1)).7 Second, the speculation component is negative, i.e. investment
into interest rate risk takes place, if and only if the expected yield of the roll-over from one
period to the next is lower than the investment in the zero-bond with a maturity of two
periods, i.e. B0
(1) ˇ E(B1
(2)) > B0
(2) which approximately corresponds to the inequality
(1+r0
(1))ˇ(1+E(r1
(2))) < (1 + r0
(2))2 , where rt
(s) is the interest rate (per year) in t until
s, i.e. Bt
(s) = (1+rt
(s))-(s-t). If the implicit interest rate rim
1
(2) = (1+r0
(2))2/(1+r0
(1))
corresponds on average to the future spot rate r1
(2), the speculation component vanishes
and only the hedging component remains. Third, the demand for short-term bonds goes
up whenever the roll-over strategy increases its attractiveness compared to the long-term
investment, irrespective of the individual's investment horizons. This raises the question
of who in the economy provides the additional supply of short-term bonds in that event,
meaning who tactically bears the interest rate risk. Fourth, the hedging component
corresponds to the present value of the initial wealth, but transferred in t = 0 to t = 1.
Apart from reasons of speculation, individuals optimizing their positions with respect to
the wealth after the first period invest all their money in short-term bonds.
According to the model above, the structural characteristics that determine an in-
vestor's demand for short-term and long-term bonds and thereby the exposure to interest
rate risk are the bank's degree of risk aversion i
and the investment horizon (here:
whether the investor maximizes the expected utility of wealth in t = 1 or t = 2).
A bank's optimization horizon cannot be directly observed. In this paper, we use

empirically observable variables to proxy this horizon, namely the existence of a trading
book and the belonging to certain banking groups. We introduce the variable tradei
as x2,i
into Equation (1). This variable indicates whether bank i has (in the period
under consideration on average) a trading book. The presumption is that banks with a
trading book are more short-term orientated whereas banks without a trading book are
more engaged in (the less market-based) traditional banking business. From a theoretical
viewpoint, a bank with complete market orientation would maximize today's market value
of its future cash flows. As hedging interest rate risk ­ for instance, the present value of
an interest rate swap is zero when the contract is concluded ­ does not create or destroy
any market value, such a bank would be indifferent towards its exposure to interest rate
risk. In the case of indifference, we make the assumption that banks completely get rid
of the risks.
In addition, we have indicator variables for membership of the group of savings banks
(svbki
) or cooperative banks (coopi
), which would be x3,i
and x4,i
, respectively, as further
variables to map a bank's optimization horizon. It can be presumed that savings and
cooperative banks have a business model with longer optimization horizons than private
and capital market orientated banks. However, membership of the savings banks or the
cooperative banks sector means much more than having a certain optimization horizon.
To account for the dominating effect of these two variables, we split the sample into
savings banks and cooperative banks on the one side and the remaining banks on the
other side as a robustness check (see Subsection 5.2).
In the literature (see, for instance, McShane and Sharpe (1985)), a bank's degree of
risk aversion (in the model above i
) is sometimes proxied by its capital ratio CRt,i
(CRi
is the time series average for bank i). However, we include this variable merely as a control
variable y1,i
in Equation (1), because this variable may represent other economic effects
as well, for instance capital buffers to cover interest rate risks.
3.3 Hedging
After a fall in the interest rate level, two direct effects occur concerning a bank's net
interest margin: First, due to the usually longer fixed interest periods on the asset side,
the fraction of assets that are adjusted in a given time span to the new interest rates is
smaller than the fraction of liabilities. For instance ­ under the assumption of a constant
balance sheet ­, if a bank revolvingly grants loans with a 10-year maturity (with a fix
coupon), only 10 per cent of these loans are newly granted in one year. By contrast, if
the same bank revolvingly collects one-year term deposits, the entire deposits are renewed
within one year. After a fall in the term structure, this effect will lead to a higher net
interest margin, because ­ at least in the first immediate years ­ the fraction of assets
that are renewed and accordingly adjusted to the lower interest rate level is smaller than
the fraction of the liabilities, leading to a positive net effect on the net interest margins.
Second, the interest rate pass-through  on the asset side tends to be larger than on the
liability side. The extreme case would be a central bank: on the asset side, there are
loans to banks, geared towards the (short-term) interest rate level and, on the liability
side, there are banknotes without remuneration regardless of the interest rate level. That
means, on the asset side, there would be a complete pass-through whereas on the liability
side, there would not even be a partial pass-through. For normal banks (and not the
8
stylized central bank), the differences in the pass-through would be less extreme. For
instance, for the German banks in the period 1968-2013, Busch and Memmel (2017) find
a long-run pass-through on the asset side of 78% and on the liability side of 71%, yielding
an effect on the net interest margin of about 7 basis-points per 100 basis point parallel
shift in the term structure.
After a change in the interest rate level, all future net interest margins of a bank are
subject to these two effects described above. Whereas the first effect is pronounced for the
immediate net interest margins, the second effect has more of an impact on the long-term
net interest margins. Busch and Memmel (2017) find that after a year and a half, both
effects cancel each other out. In Figure 2, this relationship between the change in the net
interest margin and the time since the shift in the term structure is depicted for a bank
where we look at three different cases concerning the bank's interest rate exposures (bici
),
namely a low exposure to interest rate risk ("low bic"), the level of exposure to interest rate
risk that was derived from the parameter values of Busch and Memmel (2017) ("base"),
and a high exposure to interest rate risk ("high bic"). We assume that the long-run pass-
through is determined by a bank's business model and that it is far easier for this bank to
change its exposure to interest rate risk (bici
) than the long-run pass through of its assets
and liabilities (i
).8 Therefore, irrespective of the level of interest rate risk, the long-run
pass-through of the net interest margin converges to the same value.
We assume that a bank's aim is it to stabilize its mid-term net interest margin, i.e.
the aim is to reduce the impact of today's movements in the term structure on the bank's
net interest margin in the near future. The bank can do this by choosing an appropriate
exposure to interest rate risk. For instance, in the example in Figure 2, if the goal is
to immunize the bank's net interest margin in two years time against today's changes
in the interest rate level, the bank will be well advised to choose the high interest rate
risk exposure ("high bic"). By contrast, if the bank chooses the low interest rate risk
exposure ("low bic") or the exposure as in the base case, the net interest margin in two
years time will change by 5 and 3 bp, respectively, provided a 100 bp downward shift of
the term structure occurs. In Appendix 2, we show that the change in a Bank i's net
interest margin NIM due to an interest rate shock R at the beginning of the year under
consideration can be expressed as
NIMi
= ( ˇ i
-  ˇ bici
) ˇ R + i
, (12)
where  and  take on positive values and i
is an unexplained residual. From Equation
(12) in combination with the assumption of a fix (and exogenous) long-run pass-through,
we see that minimizing the variance of the (change in the) current net interest margin
requires us to choose an exposure to interest rate risk bici
proportional to the long-run
pass-through i
. So, if the hypotheses hold that banks aim at stabilizing their mid-term
net interest margins and that the long-run pass-through is rather outside the control of
the banks, than there should be a positive relationship between a bank's exposure to
interest rate risk (bici
) and its long-run pass-through (i
).
8In Table 2 in Section 4, it is shown that the share of the serial variation of the variable bic is much
higher than the share of the variable , namely 24% (=100%-76%) vs. 6% (=100%-94%). This finding
supports the assumption that the exposure to interest rate risk (bic) is much easier to alter than the
long-run pass-through  of the bank's assets and liabilities.

In this figure, the impact on a bank's net interest margin (NIM) of a 100 bp downward shift of the term
structure is qualitatively displayed. The change in NIM is given in percentage points, the time since the
downward shift is in years. The base case is based on the parameter values of Busch and Memmel (2017);
the cases of low and high interest rate risk ("low bic" and "high bic") are constructed from the base case,
keeping the long-run pass-through constant, but assuming different exposure to interest rate risk.
10
The long-run pass-through  is not directly observable because banks' interest margins
are a combination of past and current changes in interest rates. Especially in the long
run, an increase in the interest rate level might be expected to lead to a higher future
net interest margin ­ and this is what is found in the empirical literature (see Section 2)
­ because the first effect mentioned above, i.e. the decrease due to less new business on
the asset side than on the liability side, vanishes. The second effect mentioned above is
especially pronounced for banks engaged in traditional banking business where the pass-
through on the asset side is much higher in long-run, for instance due to mortgage loans,
than the pass-through on the liability side with its large proportion of money-like deposits.
By contrast, banks relying on wholesale funding will see a much smaller effect on their
long-term net interest margin.9 In our paper, we measure the long-term pass-through 
for each bank as follows:
t,i
=
Ja
j=1
wa
t,i,j
ˇ pta
j
-
Jl
j=1
wl
t,i,j
ˇ ptl
j
(13)
where wa
t,i,j
is bank i's balance sheet weight in time t for asset j = 1, ..., Ja
and pta
j
gives
the long-run pass-through of asset position j (see Section 4), the respective variables for
the liability positions are indexed with l. As the long-run pass-through, we take the time
series average of the variable t,i
and include it in Equation (1) as x5,i
= i
.
Our hypothesis is that banks hedge the risk of a decline in the interest rate level (which
the banks cannot control) with their exposure to interest rate risk (which the banks can
control). If this hypothesis holds, we expect that the greater the long-term difference in
the pass-through i
, the higher the bank's exposure to interest rate risk bici
will be.
4 Data
All data in the paper is provided by the Deutsche Bundesbank. It comes from regular
supervisory reports.
In every quarter since end-2011, each bank in Germany has had to report its exposure
to interest rate risk in its banking book. In doing so, the bank has to determine the
changes in present values of the assets and liabilities in its banking book as a consequence
of interest rate shocks. The shocks consist of parallel overnight shifts of the entire term
structure by +200 bp and by -200 basis points, respectively. The more adverse of the
two outcomes is chosen and normalized with the bank's regulatory capital, known as the
Basel interest rate coefficient (bict,i
). For more than 95% of the banks, the more adverse
scenario is the one involving the increase in the interest rate level; in our empirical study,
we therefore use only this scenario.
The variable rwa_ta, which measures the credit risk included in the assets, is calcu-
lated as the ratio of a bank's risk weighted assets (RWA) and to its total assets (TA).
The variables svbki
and coopi
are dummy variables that take on the value of 1 if bank
i in time t belongs to the savings and cooperative banks sector, respectively. As the
9Busch and Memmel (2017) find a long-run effect on the net interest margin for the small and medium
size banks in Germany of 8 basis points (bp) per 100 bp shift in the term structure while the effect for
the more wholesale oriented large banks amounts to 3 bp.

more than three months.
savings and cooperative banks have not changed their sectors (also called pillars), there
is no variation in the time series of these two variables.
To construct the long-run pass-through, measured by the variable i
in Equation (13),
we apply the method described in Busch and Memmel (2017) according to which the
time series of various bank products are replicated by portfolios of government bonds of
different maturities and by an investment with timely constant return. We interpret the
fraction of the replicating portfolios that is invested in government bonds as the extent
of the long-run pass-through ptj
of the product j under consideration. Using the German
contribution to the MFI statistics, we estimate the replication portfolio for each product
for the period January 2003 to March 2016. The results for the share of the long-run pass-
through are shown in Table 1. We see that the extent of the pass-through varies across
the product categories as also found by De Graeve, De Jonghe, and Vennet (2007) and
Kleimeier and Sander (2006). Especially sight deposits of domestic private households
and consumer loans show a small long-run pass-through of less than 40%. For wholesale
positions (for instance interbank loans and deposits, bonds), we assume a complete pass-
through; for non-interest-bearing positions (for instance real estate, shares, capital, cash
reserve), we assume a pass-through of zero.
As mentioned before, we use a bank' s Tier 1 capital ratio CR, its size S, measured
by the logarithm of its total assets, and the time-series average of the dummy variable
swapt,i
as control variables. The dummy variable swapt,i
takes on the value of one if in
time t the notional amount of interest rate or currency swaps is strictly greater than zero;
swapi
is the corresponding time series average.
We apply a mild outlier treatment by removing the first and 99th percentile of the
(non-dummy) variables bic, rwa_ta and .
In the paper, we focus on the structural exposure to interest rate risk. To substantiate
the importance of this focus, we show that most of the determinants' variation is in

the variation is in the cross section, i.e. between the banks, not in the time dimension,
apart from the variable bic, where this share is 76.1%. In our sample, the average interest
risk exposure is nearly 19 (per cent losses in present value relative to the bank capital);
the average riskiness of the assets, measured by the RWA, is 56.1%, 8% of the observations
are of banks with a trading book, 25.6% and 65.2% of the observations belong to savings
and cooperative banks, respectively, and in 47% of the observations banks use interest

finally passed through (on the asset side: 76.9%, on the liability side: 53.5%). Busch
and Memmel (2017) estimate this net pass-through as 7.3%. Possible explanations for
these differing estimates are as follows. First, the estimates for the long-run pass-through
are based on different models and on different periods. Second, the net pass-through in
this paper is under the implicit assumption of constant balance sheet weights whereas
the net pass-through in Busch and Memmel (2017) estimates the total effect, also taking
into account possible balance sheet adjustments, which should dampen the effect of an
interest rate shock.
5 Results
5.1 Baseline Results
In Table 3, we show the results of the regression (1). We obtain empirical evidence that the
lower the credit risk per total assets, the higher the exposure to interest rate risk (highly
significant negative coefficient for rwa_ta). This is in line with the notion of Schrand
and Unal (1998) that banks have an internal risk budget that they divide up into credit
risk or interest rate risk. These findings help also to explain why Memmel (2011) and
Busch and Memmel (2016) find contrary results when they investigate the relationship
between a bank's net interest margin and its earnings from term transformation. Memmel
(2011), who finds only little empirical evidence for any relationship between the time series
average of a bank's net interest margin and its serial average exposure to interest rate
risk, does not control for the exposure to credit risk. By contrast, Busch and Memmel
(2016) find a positive relationship between a bank's net interest income and its exposure
to interest rate risk. Unlike Memmel (2011), they look at single years, namely 2012 and
2013, and, what is more, they control for the bank's credit risk exposure.
Concerning the optimization horizon, we find ­ in line with the predictions from the
theoretical model and the proxies for the length of this horizon ­ that not having a
trading book (significant negative coefficient trade) and being a savings or cooperative
bank (highly significant coefficients svbk and coop) is associated with higher exposure to
interest rate risk.
We find highly significant support for our hedging hypothesis, according to which
banks use interest rate risk to hedge the risk of a decline in the interest rate level (see
Subsection 3.3). The higher the long-run pass-through (coefficient ), the higher the
exposure to interest rate risk.
The results for the control variables (capital ratio (CR), the size (S) and the usage of
swaps (swap)) suggest that lowly capitalized, large banks which use interest rate swaps
tend to structurally bear more interest rate risk.
Concerning the economic importance of these effects, which we measure as the cross-
sectional standard deviation of the explanatory variable multiplied by the absolute coeffi-
cient, we see that being a savings or cooperative bank has by far the greatest impact (5.75
and 6.30), followed by the long-run pass-through (0.75), the riskiness of the assets (0.48)
and the existence of a trading book (0.32). This compares with the economic importance
of the control variables which are 0.70 for the capital ratio (CR), 0.33 for size (S) and
0.27 for the usage of swaps (swap).

5.2 Robustness Checks
German banks' exposure to interest rate risk greatly depends on whether or not the bank
belongs to the savings banks or cooperative banks sector. As a robustness check, we
split the sample into banks that are savings or cooperative banks and banks that are
other banks. In Table 3 (second and third columns), the results of these two subsamples
are displayed. The strong decline in the R-squared (nearly 42% in the first column; less
than 4% and just above 11% in the second and third column, respectively) and the high
economic importance of the variables svbk and coop (compared to the other variables;
see Subsection 5.1) show that much variation is due to the membership of these banking
groups. The results qualitatively remain the same. However, in the sample of savings
and cooperative banks, the variable trade is no longer significant; in the other sample,
the variables rwa_ta and  become insignificant.
Another robustness check for the cross-sectional analysis is performed by looking at a
certain point in time, and not at time series averages. When we look at year-end 2013,
which is approximately in the middle of our sample period, the cross-sectional results
qualitatively remain the same; the variable trade, however, becomes insignificant.
As a further robustness check, other control variables are introduced in regression
(1), namely the share (with respect to total assets) of bonds (on the asset side and on
the liability side) and of interbank funding. These variables turn out to be insignificant.
When the capital ratio is replaced by the leverage ratio, this variable qualitatively shows
the same results as the variable capital ratio.
6 Conclusion
This paper investigates the question of why banks bear interest rate risk in the first place,
especially the reasons for their structural exposure are in the focus. We theoretically show
that banks with different optimization horizons choose different exposures to interest rate
risk. In our empirical study for the banks in Germany, we find that a bank's presumed
optimization horizon, proxied by its membership of certain banking groups and its degree
of capital market orientation, determines the structural exposure to interest rate risk.
The longer this horizons is, the higher is the bank's exposure to interest rate risk in its
banking book. Moreover, we find that banks with higher exposure to the risk of declining
interest rate levels have higher exposure to interest rate risk. This supports the view that
banks hedge this earnings risk with exposure to interest rate risk.
Most of the variation in the bank characteristics appears to be between the banks and
not over the course of time. Therefore, the investigation in this paper with its focus on
the cross section is an important complement to the existing literature, where the focus
is mainly on the differences over the course of time.

Let there be the following relationship between the initial wealth W0
and the wealth in
time t,Wt
:
16
Wt
= W0
ˇ eRˇt (15)
where R is the relevant (annualized) interest rate.
Using the first order Taylor-approximation at t = 0, we obtain
Wt
= W0
ˇ (1 + R ˇ t) . (16)
We assume that there is an overnight parallel shift of the term structure in t = 0.
This assumed shock is permanent and no further interest rate shocks will take place.
Therefore, the initial wealth W0
is exposed to interest rate risk. If the interest rate
changes, the present value of the asset changes as well where its modified duration D
gives the sensitivity ( Ż
R and Ż
W are the expectations of R and W, respectively ):11
W0

We assume that the relevant interest rate risk R is composed of the interest rate level r
and a term premium that is proportional to the duration, i.e.
R = r + c ˇ D (19)
where c is the term premium per year of duration D; in case of a normal term structure,
it is positive.
If we assume in addition that the interest rate level r is normally distributed with
E(r) = Ż
r and var(r) = 2
r
, then the wealth in t, Wt
, is normally distributed as well (see
Equation (18)) and we can, assuming constant absolute risk aversion, state the preferences
as follows (see Subsection 3.2), where t = Ti
is the exogenous optimization horizon for
bank i:
Ti
= E (WTi

Accordingly, the optimal modified duration D

for bank i is

If the term structure is normal (and c therefore positive), the optimal duration for bank
i is greater than its optimization horizon Ti
.
11Note that the duration is defined as a positive number.

Appendix 2: Hedging
We approximate bank i's balance sheet as follows: On the asset side, there are two types
of assets, namely loans (share: A,i
) and cash (share: 1 - A,i
). The loans are handed out
revolvingly, are free of credit risk, have an original maturity of MA,i
and their coupons
correspond to the prevailing interest rate at the time the loans were granted. Assume
that, at the beginning of the year under consideration, there is a parallel shift of the
entire term structure by R. The change in the bank's net interest margin NIMi
of
this year is
NIMi
= (A,i
ˇ A,i
- L,i
ˇ L,i
) ˇ R + i
, (22)
where i
is some bank-specific noise and A,i
is the fraction of the bank's loans that have
become due in the year after the shock, weighted by the period of time when ­ within the
year ­ they matured (see Busch and Memmel (2017)):
A,i
=
1
2 ˇ MA,i
(23)
The modified duration of this bank's loan portfolio is approximately
DA,i
=
1
2
MA,i
. (24)
The variables L,i
, L,i
and ML,i
are the corresponding variables on the bank's liability
side.
Rearranging Equation (22) gives
NIMi
= (L,i
ˇ i
+ (A,i
- L,i
) ˇ A,i
) ˇ R + i
, (25)
where i
:= A,i
- L,i
is bank i's (net) long-term pass-through.
Combining Equations (24) and (23) and setting the result into Equation (25), we
obtain
NIMi
= L,i

ˇ DL,i
) > 0, where Ei
:= Ai
- Li
denotes
the bank i's equity, Equation (26) turns into Equation (12). To obtain the expression
for , two additional assumptions need to hold. First, we assume that bank i's interest
bearing assets A,i
ˇ Ai
correspond to its interest bearing liabilities L,i
ˇ Li
,12 so that the
duration Di
of the bank's equity Ei
can be written as
Di
=
Ai
ˇ A,i
Ei
ˇ (DA,i
- DL,i
) . (27)
Second, we assume that the relevant of the two scenarios for the Basel interest coefficient
is the increase in the interest rate level, so that bici
= Di
ˇ 0.02.
12Memmel and Schertler (2013) find for the German banks not using derivatives that, for the median
bank, 92.1% of the assets and 89.8% of the liabilities (including equity) are interest bearing.
