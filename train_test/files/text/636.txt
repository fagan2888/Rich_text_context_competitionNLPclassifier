The transfer of resources from middle-aged children to their functionally limited elderly
parents is addressed from the perspective of the children who may allocate time to
caregiving, share household space, and give money to parents. A simultaneous-equations
model estimates the extent to which the three modes of transfer are interdependent, given
the parents' needs for resources and the children's ability to provide them. Caregiving is
the primary mode of resource transfer and is of overriding importance for individuals who
depend daily on help from other persons. Coresidence and financial assistance
complement direct human assistance and, at the margin, have a substantially large
effect on caregiving time. It is, therefore, relevant to consider all modes of transfer
in order to better understand how families accommodate the needs of their frail
and disabled members.

The Transfer of Resources From Middle-Aged
Children to Functionally Limited Elderly
Parents: Providing Time, Giving Money,
Sharing Space
Rachel F. Boaz, PhD,1 Jason Hu, MBA,2 and Yongjia Ye, PhD2
The role of adult children in assisting functionally
limited elderly parents has been receiving consider-
able attention because an increasing number of
elderly parents survive to a very advanced age and,
thus, are prone to frailty and functional limitations.
The issue of filial responsibility has been addressed
frequently from the perspective of the parents. This
study addresses the transfer of resources to parents
from the perspective of the children who may pro-
vide caregiving time, share living space, or give money.
It investigates the interdependence among all three
modes of transfer, given the parents' specific needs
for resources and the children's ability to provide them.
With increased longevity, the prevalence of three-
generation families is common. Nearly three out of
Four persons in the age range of 50-54 have at least
one living parent and one living child (Soldo, 1996).
At the time in their lives when called upon to assist
frail and disabled parents, middle-aged sons and
daughters may still be paying for the education of
their own children and otherwise assisting them dur-
ing the early phases of adulthood. To support the
succeeding generation, the middle generation can be
expected to continue to work for pay. To help the
preceding generation with daily activities of personal
care and household tasks, members of the middle

generation have to supply caregiving services and, there-
fore, might cut down on market work; or, alterna-
tively, they might continue to be engaged in market
work and give money to their parents for paid help.
Hence, the commitment to market work could affect
not only the ability to transfer resources but also the
mode of transfer.
But, thus far, research on the role of labor market
activity has been confined to the relationship between
time devoted to caregiving and time spent in paid
work. Several studies analyzed the effect of employ-
ment on caregiving. White-Means and Chiang (1991)
examined the effect of wages on hours of caregiving
and found a negative effect at the time of the initial
contact but not at the time of the 6-month follow-up.
Boaz and Muller (1992) determined that full-time em-
ployment reduced caregiving to persons disabled in
activities of daily living (ADLs) by 20 hours per week,
but caregiving time had only a negligible effect on full-
time employment. Doty, Jackson, and Crown (1998)
found that the reduced caregiving time of employed
female primary caregivers is offset by secondary un-
paid and paid helpers, which means that the elderly
care recipients do not necessarily experience unmet
need for help in the community. Other studies ana-
lyzed the effect of caregiving responsibilities on
market work. Muurinen (1986) found that primary care-
givers of terminally ill patients suffered a loss of in-
come due to their withdrawal from the labor market
or reduced hours of paid work. Stone and Short (1990)
determined that caregivers of long-term disabled and
frail elderly persons accommodated their market
work to their caregiving responsibilities by rearranging

work schedules, taking time off without pay, or re-
ducing hours of paid work. Ruhm (1996) determined
that caregiving reduced employment by married but
not by unmarried women. Wolf and Soldo (1994) found
that caregiving by married women had a negative
effect on their employment but the relevant coeffi-
cients are not statistically significant. Ettner (1996) de-
termined that the effect of caregiving on paid work
was conditioned on living arrangements; caregiving re-
duced daughters' employment when parents and
daughters were living in different households but did
not do so when they shared living quarters.
Coresidence can facilitate caregiving by saving travel
time for the caregiver. In general, both elderly parents
and their children prefer living apart. According to a
1986 survey by Louis Harris and Associates (Harris and
Associates, 1986), of all the elderly persons living alone,
86% stated their preference for this arrangement; and
data from the 1990 Census show that only 15% of all
elderly persons were living with adults other than a
spouse (NIA, 1993). Pezzin, Kemper, and Reschovsky
(1996) determined that subsidized paid help had
enabled elderly individuals to continue living alone.
But, in the absence of such help, functional limita-
tions change this preference. Boersch-Supan (1990)
showed that the transition to sharing the household
with a helper occurred because of limitations in per-
sonal care activities. Boersch-Supan, Hajivassiliou, Kotli-
koff, and Morris (1992) showed that elderly persons
had a very strong preference for living with children
to avoid residence in a nursing home. Soldo, Wolf,
and Agree (1990) determined that coresidence of a
widowed or divorced mother with her children de-
pends on her functional status and on the number
and gender of her children; mothers are more likely
to reside with their children if they have only one
child than if they have several children, and if this
only child is a daughter rather than a son. Kotlikoff
and Morris (1990), studying both elderly parents and
their children, concluded that the children were less
willing than their parents to share living quarters.
Financial assistance to elderly parents, which could
pay for human assistance, is a mode of resource transfer
that received only scant attention because such trans-
fers are rare. Inter-vivo financial support is more fre-
quently provided to the succeeding generation on the
threshold of adulthood. Summarizing the literature,
Soldo and Hill (1993) stated that national estimates
from the late 1980s indicate that only 5% of children
gave money to parents or parents-in-law over a 12-
month period and that such assistance was provided
to parents who were disabled at the end of their lives.
Among sons and daughters aged 51-61 in 1992, 9%
transferred $500+ over a year's period (McGarry &
Schoeni, 1995).
Much of the literature on the transfer of resources
between generations has focused on motivation,
namely, whether transfers are a form of implicit ex-
change or can be attributed to altruism on the part of
the donor. In the former case, donor and recipient
"bargain" about whether the transfer should take
place and at what level, and the donor of services or
money anticipates a form of payment (e.g., an inher-
itance). In the latter case, the donor decides on mak-
ing the transfer without expecting a return. Soldo and
Hnl (1993) point out that some empirical findings sup-
port the hypothesis of exchange whereas others sup-
port the hypothesis of altruism, an inconclusiveness
that might be due to the heterogeneity of donors, some
of whom are motivated by altruism whereas others
might expect a reward. A couple of more recent studies
found that the needs of recipients motivate the trans-
fer of resources. An analysis by McGarry and Schoeni
(1995) supported the conclusion that transfers from
living parents to their children and transfers from adult
children to their elderly parents were based on the
recipients' needs. Sloan, Picone, and Hoerger (1997)
determined that the supply of time by children to dis-
abled elderly parents did not appear to have been
guided by the exchange motive of anticipating an in-
heritance.
This study is concerned with the donors' ability to
provide resources rather than with their motivation.
Controlling for the donors' own economic resources
and the other expected claimants on these resources,
the study investigates the extent of interdependence
among all three modes of resource transfers because
interdependence implies that it is relevant to consider
all modes of transfer simultaneously in order to better
understand how families accommodate the needs of
their frail and disabled members. Yet this interdepen-
dence has not yet received much attention. Further,
because the transfers flow from the pooled resources
of the donor household, this study treats transfers as
a household activity, a departure from the customary
approach to transfers as an individual activity. The next
section discusses conceptual issues. It is followed by
sections that specify the regression model and present
empirical results, and it concludes with a discussion
and an interpretation of the findings.
Conceptual Issues
The three modes of transfer (i.e., the provision of
time, the giving of money, and the sharing of space)
are not likely to be independent of each other. Their
interdependence is explained by showing how a frail
and disabled person can be helped. For a person who
cannot perform basic functions of daily living without
human assistance, caregiving services are of overrid-
ing importance. Hence, central to the transfer of re-
sources is the provision of time (measured by hours
of caregiving). The sharing of space facilitates caregiving
by saving travel time and, therefore, complements care-
giving. A person who shares living quarters with a dis-
abled parent is usually a primary caregiver. Financial
assistance to pay for needed human assistance can
serve as a substitute for caregiving time that is not
provided 'or as a supplement to the time that is pro-
vided.
Labor market activity by the donor affects the abil-
ity to transfer resources. It can facilitate one mode of
transfer and inhibit another. When sons or daughters
do not work for pay, they can provide more caregiving
time and less financial assistance than when they do.
Conversely, the more time spent in paid work, the
Vol. 39, No. 6, 1999 649
less time can be allocated to caregiving and the greater
the ability to transfer money. Commitment to market
work might also affect the decision on coresidence. A
caregiver who is engaged in labor market activity might
decide to share living quarters with a parent because
coresidence is a time-saving device. Thus, the labor
market activity of donors is an essential determinant
of the ability to make transfers; it affects the mode of
transfer ana the amounts transferred and, in turn, is
affected by decisions on transfers.
The interdependence among the three types of
resources and their link to the labor-market activity
of the donor call for a simultaneous-equations model
with four structural equations. Such a model is pre-
sented in Table 1; it satisfies the order-and-rank con-
ditions of identification. All four endogenous variables
are right-hand-side (RHS) variables. The criterion for
including exogenous variables in any structural equa-
tion is whether these variables can be expected to
have a direct effect on the left-hand-side (LHS) vari-
able of that equation; the exclusion restrictions follow
from the variables that are included in each equation,
based on this criterion. The indirect effects are cap-
tured through the RHS endogenous variables.
The exogenous variables (which are discussed in
greater detail in the next two sections) are the charac-
teristics of parents (recipients) and children (donors).
The parents' characteristics indicate their needs for
help and whether they have other family members
(a spouse and other children) who could assist them.
These characteristics have a direct effect on each of
the three equations that estimate transfer-modes; they
affect "paid work" by sons and daughters (the donors)
indirectly through the effects of the three RHS endog-
enous variables of the "paid work" equation. The abil-
ity of sons and daughters to transfer resources to par-
ents is indicated by their commitment to market work,
their own children, their wealth, and their health. As
shown by Mincer (1974) and subsequent studies, the
major determinants of paid work are schooling and
age; they can serve as instrumental variables for com-
pensation from work because these variables are highly
correlated with labor market earnings. Fungible wealth
(represented by income from assets) enhances the
ability to provide financial assistance to parents but
weakens the commitment to market work. The donor's
own children might compete with their grandparents
for resources. The type of resources that these children
would need depends on their ages and, therefore, their
ages affect the mode of resource transfer to their grand-
parents. The donor's general health status can affect
both labor market and caregiving activities. Difficulty
with mobility points to a specific aspect of health status
that has a direct effect on helping parents with personal
care activities such as dressing, bath-ing, and assisting a
person with getting in and out of a bed or chair. Prob-
lems with mobility are less likely to affect market work
because, as stipulated by the Americans With Disability
Act, most workplaces have to accommodate these prob-
lems. (The undesirable effects of multicolinearity are
avoided by including these two health-status indicators
in different equations.)

The Specification of the Regression Model
The data source for the empirical analysis is the
first wave of the Health and Retirement Survey (HRS)
which, in 1992, interviewed 12,652 persons (respon-
dents) who were members of 7,702 households. The
selection criterion for inclusion in the HRS is that at
least one person in each household was born between
1931 and 1941 (aged 51-61 in 1992). The spouse or
domestic partner of the age-eligible person might be
age eligible or could have been born before 1931 or
after 1941. Of all respondents, 9,824 (78%) were age
eligible and 1,138 (9%) were older. Their ages sug-
gest that their parents were likely to be old: 40% of
their parents were between ages 70-79 and 50% were
aged 80+. (Detailed information on the HRS is pro-
vided in Juster & Suzman, 1995).
The criterion for inclusion in the present study is
the functional status of the parents. Functional status
and chronic health problems in old age are based on
such exogenous factors as genetic endowment and
events earlier in a person's life (Smith & Kingston, 1997).
HRS considers a parent to be functionally limited if
he or she needs help with routine personal activities
such as dressing, eating, or bathing and/or "cannot
be left alone for more than one hour" (e.g., question
E-43). This is the only question about the parent's
need for assistance with activities of daily living (ADLs);
it differs from the usually detailed questions asked
when disabled individuals are interviewed (e.g., in such
surveys as the NLTCS or AHEAD).
650 The Gerontologist
The unit of analysis is the household (not the indi-
viduals in the household) because the household is
the economic unit whose members pool the resources
that are transferred to parents. The HRS distinguishes
between one-respondent households and two-respon-
dent households; 370 households of the former type
and 1,298 of the latter qualify for inclusion in the sample
because these are the households that have at least
one parent who needs help with personal care activi-
ties. The study is based on the sample of two-respon-
dent households. Although similar in concept, the two
types of households have to be analyzed separately;
the analysis of the two-respondent households has to
take into account the interaction between the labor-
market activity of the two respondents whereas there
is no such interaction in a one-respondent household.
This study is based on the more complicated and
larger subset, that is, on the two-respondent house-
holds. Each of these households happened to be paired
by respondents of the opposite sex; the households
were not selected on the basis of this attribute.
The four endogenous variables are: (a) hours of
caregiving time, (b) the probability of giving money to
a parent, (c) the probability of coresiding with a par-
ent, and (d) the commitment to market work. The
HRS questionnaire words the question about hours of
help in terms of the assistance provided during a 12-
month period preceding the interview. It specifies the
lower limit as 100 hours because persons who pro-
vide fewer than 100 hours in a year are considered
to have provided only token assistance and no regular
help with the daily activities of personal care; they
are not considered to be caregivers of persons who
need daily help and/or cannot be left alone. HRS sets
the upper limit at 5,824 annual hours (approximately
16 hours per day) for each respondent or 11,648
annual hours for a two-respondent household. The
HRS asks about amounts of financial assistance that
exceed $500 per year. However, because the infor-
mation on dollar amounts is incomplete, the regres-
sion analysis specifies the probability that money has
been given to a parent rather than tne amounts trans-
ferred. The HRS provides information on whether a
parent resides witn the respondent in the same house-
hold or has other living arrangements.
The strength of the commitment to market work is
measured by the amount of time spent in paid work.
Labor supply (hours of paid work) is not a continuous
(linear or log-linear) variable because reported hours
of work are clustered. Juster and Stafford (1991) point
out that hours of work reported in surveys usually
cluster around 35-40 weekly hours as a convenient
indicator of full-time paid work. In the HRS, a sub-
stantial cluster occurs at exactly 40 hours per week
for 52 weeks, that is, at 2,080 annual hours (27% of
all male respondents and 21% of all female respon-
dents in the sample reported this number of hours).
Hence, 2,080 is considered the demarcation for full-
time employment. A distinction is made among three
types of commitment to market work: no commitment
(no paid work), some commitment (part-time paid work
of fewer than 2,080 annual hours), and a major com-
mitment (full-time paid work of 2,080+ annual hours).
This classification follows the observations by labor
economists (e.g., Blank,1989) that part-time employ-
ment is a distinct mode of employment and is on a
different track than full-time employment (analogous
to the difference between adjunct and tenure-track
faculty). The qualitative difference between part-time
and full-time employment is also demonstrated by the
difference in eligibility for employment-related ben-
efits and opportunities for promotion. Put differently,
part-time and full-time employment are not on the
same continuum. Multinomial logit (MNL; rather than
ordered logit) is the appropriate functional form to
represent the different types of employment because
MNL estimates a different coefficient vector for each
employment category. (Ordered logit does not have
separate coefficient vectors because all truly ordered
categories are on the same continuum.)
The exogenous variables represent parents' need
for human assistance and their ability to obtain this
assistance from other members of their family. The
characteristics of the respondents are indicators of
their ability to provide resources to their parents; the
relevant characteristics are their labor-market activity,
their wealth and health, and the other expected
claimants on their resources.
A parent needs extensive human assistance when
he or she requires the constant presence of a caregiver
and cannot perform the daily activities of personal
care without assistance. As a measure of the burden
on donor households, this study distinguishes between
households with at least one parent who needs such
extensive help and households in which no parent needs
extensive help. Another measure of the burden on house-
holds is the number of parents who need help, which
is specified by differentiating between households in
which only one parent needs help and households in
which more than one parent requires human assis-
tance (the maximum is four parents). Ability of the
parents to rely on family members other than the re-
spondent lessens this burden; it is indicated by the
parent's marital status and the number of other sons
and daughters (the respondent's siblings). A parent who
is married and/or has other children is less dependent
on caregiving by the respondent and less likely to re-
side in the respondent's household.
The respondent's propensity to engage in market
work depends on the level of education, age, and
health status. These variables are highly correlated with
the level of compensation (wages, salaries, and ben-
efits), which is a major determinant of participation in
labor-market activity. Therefore, these variables can
serve as instruments for compensation from paid work
and avoid the problem of RHS endogeneity of the
direct measures of compensation. The decision on
whether to commit to market work and the type of
commitment is also affected by the household's in-
come from assets (nonlabor income) and by the ages
of respondents' children. The ages of respondents' own
children determine the type of support that these
children need. When almost all children are young
adults (ages 18+), the most likely resource they would
need is money, especially if they have not yet com-
pleted their education; and they may also need space
Vol. 39, No. 6, 1999 651
if they reside in their parents' household. Hence, the
grandchildren can be expected to compete with their
grandparents for the respondents' financial support and
household space. Age 25 was selected as the demar-
cation between need for parent support and no need
(or lesser need) for such support. The number of chil-
dren under age 26 is specified as an indicator of the
other potential claimants on the resources of the re-
spondents.
As presented in Table 1, the regression model specifies
four structural equations. A two-stage procedure is used
to estimate each single equation. (System methods such
as full-information-maximum-likelinood turned out to
be intractable for a four-equation model.) In the first
stage, each of the four endogenous variables is re-
gressed on all exogenous variables of the model; the
rationale (as clearly explained in Gujarati, 1988, pp.
603-605) is that every exogenous variable is expected
to affect each endogenous variable either directly or
indirectly (through its direct effect on another endog-
enous variable). Four second-stage (structural) equa-
tions specify the predicted values of the endogenous
variables as RHS variables. The functional forms for
the first-stage and second-stage equations are: (a) a
tobit equation for hours of human assistance (time),
(b) a binary (ordinary) logit equation for the probabil-
ity of providing financial assistance, (c) a binary (ordi-
nary) logit equation for the probability of coresidence
(sharing space), and (d) an MNL equation for estimat-
ing the commitment to market work.
The unit of analysis is the household because trans-
fers flow from the household's pooled resources. This
approach differs from the customary one that focuses
on the individual as the unit of analysis even when
the individual is married and data are available for
the spouse. The commitment of one spouse to mar-
ket work is not independent from the commitment to
market work of the other spouse (Killingworth, 1983,
pp. 30-34). Because each household happened to be
paired by respondents of the opposite sex, the labor-
market interaction between its two respondents is pre-
sented as gender-based interaction. The MNL catego-
ries of the variable "commitment to market work" are
specified to reflect this interdependence, as follows:
(a) both husband and wife work full-time; (b) only the
husband works full-time (his wife does not work or
works part-time); (c) only the wife works full-time (her
husband does not work or works part-time); (d) both
spouses do not work; and (e) a residual category of
the possible remaining interactions (a category that is
not interpreted). Because the HRS oversamples racial
and ethnic minorities, the sample observations are
weighted to adjust for the oversampling so that the
empirical results are applicable to the population rep-
resented by the sample of this study.
Empirical results

respondent households by types of resources trans-

households transferred any resources over a 12-month
period. The most preferred modes of resource trans-
fer were either only caregiving (12%) or only money
(10%). A combination of time and money was rare
(3%). But even more rare was the sharing of space,
either as the only mode (1.6%) or in combination with
time (1.8%). And less than 1% of households provided
a combination of all three modes of transfers. The pro-
vision of any assistance was most likely when the
parent needed extensive help (as defined earlier) and
when the parent had no spouse. Compared with the
entire cohort of HRS respondents, transfers were more
common among respondents with functionally limited
parents. McGarry and Schoeni (1995) show that, for
the larger denominator of all HRS respondents with
living parents, 7% provided time and 9% provided
money; the comparable proportions for the subset of
households with at least one functionally limited par-
ent were 17% and 14%, respectively.
Table 3 presents descriptive statistics (weighted arith-
metic means and proportions) of regression covariates
that represent household characteristics and the per-
sonal characteristics of their male and female respon-
dents. For each transfer mode, this table flags the
statistically significant differences between households
that transferred resources and households that did not.
Households that provided time differed from the ones
that did not in having proportionally more parents with
extensive needs for help and proportionally fewer par-
ents who were married. They also had proportionally
more respondents who did not work for pay and pro-
portionally fewer men who were employed full-time.
Households that provided financial assistance differed
from the ones that did not in having higher levels of
asset-income and proportionally more women who
were engaged in market work full-time. They also had
a somewhat higher proportion of parents with exten-
sive needs for human assistance and a smaller pro-
portion of married parents. Although marriage per se
does not confer a better financial position, data from
the Current Population Survey show that, among the

elderly population, married couples are better off than
unmarried individuals (Social Security Administration,
1998). Sons and daughters were more likely to share
living quarters with parents who were not married and/
or had few or no other children; these households
had proportionally fewer employed respondents, pre-
sumably because these respondents were likely to have
had major caregiving responsibilities. The regression
analysis is designed to assess the interdependence among
transfer modes and to determine the extent to which
parents' needs and children's ability to be donors af-
fect the transfer of resources.
For the sample of 1,298 households, Table 4 pre-
sents the second-stage equations that estimate the re-
lationship among the three modes of transfer, control-
ling for the effects of the relevant characteristics of
the donors and the recipients. The three dependent
variables corresponding to these three transfer modes
are hours of caregiving, the probability of transferring
money, and the probability of sharing space. A fourth
equation, whose dependent variable is market work,
is not shown here because market work is not a re-
source that is transferred; its role in this model is that
of a RHS endogenous indicator of the ability to trans-
fer resources. The standard errors of the coefficients
in second-stage equations are biased downward; hence,
the observed level of statistical significance is over-
stated. To take account of this problem, the analysis
disregards the 10% significance level, regards the 5%
level as only a weak statistical significance, and inter-
prets the 1% level as statistically significant. [We know
of no program that would adjust the standard errors
of a second-stage equation that has three RHS pre-
dicted variables that are obtained from three different
first-stage equations. Such an adjustment requires a
combination of these three equations and, therefore,
is not doable. LIMDEP 7.0 (Econometrics Software, Inc.,
New York) has a program for a model that has one
first-stage equation.]
The RHS endogenous variables provide estimates
of the interdependence among the three modes of
resource transfer and the effect of market work on
specific transfer modes. Household characteristics in-
clude parents' attributes, the respondents' own chil-
dren, and the household's asset-income. Each of the
households happens to have a male respondent and
a female respondent (as explained in the previous sec-
tion); therefore, gender characteristics are considered
household characteristics and are shown separately for
male and female spouses (partners). The regression co-
efficients are interpreted as the effects of RHS vari-
ables on the transfer of resources from the donor (sons/
daughters) generation to the recipient (parents) gen-
eration when the older generation has at least one
functionally limited member.
The interdependence among transfer modes is
unidirectional in that financial assistance and coresi-
dence affect caregiving time but caregiving has no re-
ciprocal effect on the transfer of money or on the
sharing of living space. Households that provided fi-
nancial assistance also provided 502 more annual hours
of caregiving time than households that did not pro-
vide such assistance. The few households that shared
living quarters with a parent provided close to 3,000
additional caregiving hours per year compared with
the many more households that did not share space.
When a functionally limited parent resides in a re-
spondent household, at least one member of the house-
hold is likely to have a major responsibility for caregiving.
Coresidence and financial assistance do not appear to
be interdependent. The transfer of money to parents
did not affect the probability of sharing space with
them, and coresidence did not affect the provision of
financial assistance.
In theory, the commitment to market work can be
expected to affect every mode of transfer. However,
the analysis shows that market work affected only the
amount of caregiving time and had no effect on the
probability of financial assistance or the probability of
coresidence. Specifically, compared witn no market
work, full-time employment by both husband and wife
reduced caregiving by 344 annual hours. When only

cAlmost all own children are young adults (ages 18+). Their claims on household resources are for financial support and space
accommodation. They do not compete with their disabled grandparents for help (time) with routine activities of daily living. Or put
differently, cell size for the relevant group of minor children who would need such help is very small, especially when interacted with
the number of children in the household.

the husband was employed full-time, caregiving was
reduced by 247 annual hours, but caregiving by the
household was not reduced when only the wife was
employed full-time. Market work had no statistically
significant effect on providing financial assistance to
parents or coresiding with them.
Parents' characteristics have an effect on the trans-
fer of resources by their children. Whereas the num-
ber of functionally limited parents in a household had
no statistically significant effect on any transfer mode,
a parent's need for extensive help prompted the
households of their sons or daughters to provide 200
additional caregiving hours per year (compared to a
situation when a functionally limited parent did not
need extensive help). A parent's marital status and the
number of other children (respondent's siblings) had
statistically significant effects on reducing the probability
of coresidence and financial transfers. Having a spouse
reduced the probability of household sharing by 3.2%
and the probability of financial support by 7.1%; hav-
ing an additional child (a sibling of the HRS respon-
dent) reduced the probability of coresidence by 0.6%
and the probability of financial transfers by 0.8%.
The ability of middle-aged sons and daughters to
assist their functionally limited parents depends on the
household's fungible wealth and on the other expected
claimants to its resources. A measure of such wealth
is income from assets; a substantial level of asset-in-
come increased the probability of financial transfers
to parents by 8.7% when compared with a household
that had no asset-income. Foremost among the other
claimants are the donor household's own children, al-
most all of whom were young adults. These young
adults might need financial support, and they might
still reside in their parents' home. Thus, the grand-
children and grandparents might compete for space
and money but, in effect, they did not. Having grand-
children under age 26 did not reduce the probability
of financial assistance to their grandparents or coresi-
dence with them; there is no statistically significant
difference in giving money or sharing space between
households that had no children and households that
had any number of children under age 26. (One puz-
zling result is the effect of being non-White on the
probability of transferring money to parents; contrary
to expectations, being non-White rather than White
increased this probability by 8.0%.)
Discussion
Inter-vivo transfers within families usually flow from
middle-aged members to their children; transfers from
children to parents are very rare and occur mainly at
the end of the parents' lives. The analysis is based on
households in which at least one member is within
the age range of 51-61. When a son or a daughter
has a spouse, the household can have four living par-
ents. Included in this study are all households in
which the age-eligible member has a spouse/partner
(i.e., two-respondent households) and at least one
parent cannot independently perform the daily ac-
tivities of personal care and/or cannot be left un-
attended. The family life cycle suggests that, in their
fifties, members of the "sandwich" generation are likely
to have parents of very advanced age who are prone
to frailty and disability, in addition to having children
and even grandchildren; in other words, members of
the middle generation can expect to have many
claimants on their resources. This study controls for
the ability of the sandwich generation to transfer re-
sources as it investigates the interdependence among
the three mode of resource transfer.
Most studies of disabled elderly parents and their
adult children focus on caregiving. Stone and Kemper
(1989) estimated that fewer than one in four (23.6%)
sons and daughters were active caregivers in 1984.
Himes (1994) determined that, at any point in time,
only few daughters are caregivers; but, over their lives,
the probability of being a caregiver is high because,
as parents' survival rates increase, the risk that they
will become dependent on their children increases.
The present study shows that, over a duration of one
year, relatively few children provided caregiving time.
On a household basis, 17% of the two-respondent
households provided caregiving time in 1992. How-
ever, caution has to be exercised in concluding that
family caregiving has declined over time because of
the difference in the specified activities for which help
is needed. The 1984 data have information on IADL
and ADL disabilities whereas the 1992 data have in-
formation only on ADL disabilities; it is much easier
to assist with household tasks than to help with the
daily activities of personal care and, therefore, pro-
portionally more children might be reported as caregivers
in 1984 than in 1992.
The provision of caregiving time is the primary mode
of resource transfer. When tne transfers of money and
space are counted in addition to the transfer of time,
29% of households transferred resources to parents. Co-
residence has been studied as a facilitator of caregiving,
but money transfers have received only scant attention
although financial assistance enables a recipient-parent
to obtain paid help. The findings from this study sug-
gest a unidirectional rather than a multidirectional in-
terdependence among the types of resources that
are transferred. Coresidence and financial support
are associated with a substantial increase in the amount
of caregiving time and, at the margin, complement
caregiving. Households that share living quarters with
parents are likely to have a major responsibility of
caring for them. Financial support for paid help in addi-
tion to the unpaid help that is provided by family
members signals a need for extensive human assistance
by care recipients (Liu, Manton, & Liv, 1985); it is
positively associated with caregiving time.
Further, transfer modes appear to be targeted to
parents' needs. The provision of caregiving time is in-
creased when a parent is dependent on others for
performing the daily activities of personal care and
cannot be left alone. Coresidence is more likely when
a parent has few or no other family members, such as
a spouse and/or other children, with whom to share
living quarters. Money transfers are more likely when
a parent is not married because married elderly par-
ents are frequently better off financially than unmar-
ried elderly parents.
656 The Gerontologist
The modes of transfer also depend on the types of
resources available to the donor households. House-
holds are more likely to provide financial support when
they have a substantial amount of income from assets,
suggesting a substantial level of fungible wealth. Fur-
ther, the likelihood of giving money to parents is not
reduced by the other potential claimants (e.g., own
children) on the household's resources. Market work
was found to affect only the provision of help time.
Full-time paid work by both spouses reduces the house-
hold's caregiving more than if only one spouse is em-
ployed full-time; but full-time employment by only the
husband is more likely to reduce the number of hours
of help than full-time employment by his wife. Con-
versely, when men and women are not engaged in
market work, they provide more caregiving time than
when they are. Although it has been amply docu-
mented that women have the major responsibility for
caregiving, the caregiving households in this study dis-
play a pattern of human assistance in which men share
this responsibility to a substantial extent. In 55% of all
caregiving households, both spouses were caregivers;
men were sole caregivers in 7% of these households,
and women were the only caregivers in 38% of these
households. (The information on household caregiving
was, by design, obtained from the female respondent
in the two-respondent household.)
The findings suggest that it is relevant to consider
all modes of transfer in order to understand how
families accommodate the needs of their frail and dis-
abled elderly members. Whereas the provision of care-
giving services is the primary mode of transfer, almost
half of the donor households provide financial assis-
tance. On the other hand, the general trend away
from sharing living quarters with elderly parents, which
can be traced as far back as the 1940s (Schoeni, 1998),
is also reflected in the very low rate of coresidence
with elderly parents who are functionally limited. This
finding implies that single parents have to find other
assisted living arrangements when they are no longer
able to live alone. To judge from the level of cash
income available to individuals of advanced age (So-
cial Security Administration, 1998), the majority of persons
in this group cannot afford to pay for assisted living in
the community without financial support from their
children or subsidies from public-sector funds. Thus,
when middle-aged children have a strong preference
for their own privacy and avoid coresidence with their
frail and disabled elderly parents (Kotlikoff and Mor-
ris, 1990), financial assistance to parents might assume
an increasingly important role in the transfer of re-
sources from the middle to the oldest generation.
