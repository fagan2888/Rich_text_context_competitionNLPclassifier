Multiple Parent­Adult Child Relations and
Well-Being in Middle and Later Life

Objectives. Despite the centrality of parent­adult child relations, prior research has found only weak associations with
parent well-being. There is a need to give more explicit attention to the relations of parents with multiple children and to
the potentially mixed or ``ambivalent'' nature of those relations. These patterns may differ for mothers and fathers.
Methods. Wave 1 of the National Survey of Families and Households provided detailed information on relations
between parents and each of their adult children. The sample included 2,270 persons aged 50þ who had at least one child
aged 19þ.
Results. Measures across multiple adult children uncovered more mixed patterns of ``collective ambivalence'' that
included lesser quality and/or contact with at least some children. The presence of less positive relations with any children
was consistently, albeit modestly, related to lower parent well-being. Mothers reported higher ``maximum'' quality and
interaction across children, but mothers and father did not differ in ``minimum'' reports. Associations between parent­
child relations and well-being were similar for mothers and fathers.
Discussion. Analyses that incorporate the relations of parents with their multiple adult children, viewed as part of
a family network, yield a more comprehensive and nuanced view of those relations and their implications for well-being.
Key Words: Parent­child relations--Well-being--NSFH.
THE parent­child bond is a central tie that now typically
lasts into the later adult years of parents and into middle
age and even beyond for children (Mancini & Blieszner, 1989).
Parent­adult child relations are generally characterized by
positive feelings and solidarity (e.g., see Bengtson, Biblarz, &
Roberts, 2002), but research has found only weak associations
between those relations and parent well-being. This may reflect
the mixed quality of parent­child relations. Little research has
looked at parent­child relations as a network of ties in which
some may be more positive whereas others may be more
negative, with presumably mixed implications for parental
well-being.
This article addresses the implications of considering in
a more explicit and detailed way the multiple parent­adult child
relations of most parents to better understand their implications
for parent well-being. In particular, it directs attention to less
positive aspects of parent­child relations and extends the con-
cept of intergenerational ambivalence (Luescher & Pillemer,
1998), which has been applied to particular parent­child re-
lationships, to a collective view of ambivalence across multiple
children. The following sections review the literature on
parent­adult child relations and well-being and on ambivalence
in those relations.
Parent­Adult Child Relations and Well-Being
Close social relationships are presumed to contribute to
individual well-being (Krause, 2001). Indeed, such perspectives
as socioemotional selectivity and expectancy theory argue
that people seek out ties that are emotionally supportive
(Carstenson, 1992; Olson, Reese, & Zanna, 1996). Families in
particular offer the kinds of durable ``strong ties'' that may
contribute to well-being, in part by buffering the effects of
stressful circumstances (Bengtson & Silverstein, 1993; Lin,
Woelfel, & Light, 1985; Logan & Spitze, 1996; Umberson &
Chen, 1994; Umberson, Wortman, & Kessler, 1992). Family
ties may play an increasing role as individuals age and network
ties focus increasingly on kin. Social networks in later life may
become smaller but retain emotional closeness by focusing se-
lectively on those ties, such as family, that are most supportive
and gratifying (Ajrouch, Antonucci, & Janevic, 2001; Lang,
Staudinger, & Carstensen, 1998; Shaw, Krause, Liang, &
Bennett, 2007).
Drawing from various theoretical perspectives, Umberson
(1992) cited the parent­child tie as a particularly strong and
unique source of social attachment and solidarity. Indeed, it
seems reasonable to expect that such relations would affect
well-being through supports that meet the needs of both parents
and their adult children. Knoester (2003) also suggested that the
well-being of adult children affects parent well-being through
feelings of empathy, as parents vicariously experience their
children's joys and sorrows, and because children's successes
or failures reflect on parent performance.
Knoester, however, indicated that relatively little is known
about the extent to which parents and adult children actually
affect one another's well-being. Being childless, for example,
exhibits little association with well-being (Brubaker, 1991;
Koropeckyj-Cox, 2002; Zhang & Hayward, 2001). The
proximity and frequency of contact with adult children appear
to have little overall association with well-being (Brubaker,
1991; Mancini & Blieszner, 1989; Suitor & Pillemer, 1987).
Weinstein, Glei, Yamazaki, and Ming-Cheng (2004) reported
little association between interaction and affectional ties with
adult children and parent depression. Parents who are
``sandwiched'' between their adult children and older parents

also exhibit little association between parent­child relations and
well-being (Logan & Spitze, 1996; Ward & Spitze, 1998).
If the parent­adult child tie is central in the lives of both, why
is the evidence of its effects on well-being so weak? It may be
that children have less salience for parental well-being
following the empty nest, in what Rossi (1968) termed the
disengagement stage of parenthood. This reduction in the
parenting role may itself be a source of gratification. Although
children can be a source of enjoyment, the parent role can also
be stressful, especially when children are young, and there is
some evidence that the departure of children (the ``empty nest'')
is associated with increased well-being (Barber, 1989; Logan &
Spitze, 1996; Ross, Mirowsky, & Goldstein, 1990; Van
Laningham, Johnson, & Amato, 2001; White & Edwards,
1990).
There are indications that involvement and interaction with
adult children may enhance well-being (Logan & Spitze, 1996;
White & Edwards, 1990) but also that adult children can be
a source of distress. Reciprocity in gratifications and assistance
is accompanied by reciprocity in strain and burden, as parents
and adult children affect one another's lives. Negative
dimensions of parent­child ties have been a focus in caregiving
research assessing, for example, the burdens and strains
experienced by child (and other) caregivers (e.g., see Pearlin,
Aneshensel, Mullan, & Whitlatch, 1996; Sherwood, Given,
Given, & Von Eye, 2005; Vitiliano, Zhang, & Scanlan, 2003).
Even aside from caregiving, other research has found that some
aspects of parent­child relations are associated with psycholog-
ical distress for both parents and adult children (e.g., Logan &
Spitze, 1996; Pillemer & Suitor, 1991; Umberson, 1992).
Knoester (2003) found that the well-being of parents and adult
children, and changes in their well-being, affect the well-being
of the other. Parent­child relations may have both positive and
negative effects, varying by relationship quality, circumstances
of parents and children, and other factors (Ha & Carr, 2005;
Silverstein, Chen, & Heller, 1996; Umberson, 1989, 1992).
Multiple Parent­Child Relations and Collective
Ambivalence
These considerations suggest that parent­adult child relations
matter but that children (and parents, for that matter) are
a ``mixed blessing.'' Parent­adult child relations are generally
positive along multiple dimensions of intergenerational soli-
darity (Silverstein & Bengtson, 1997), with relatively close
proximity, frequent contact, emotional closeness, and feelings
of normative obligation accompanied by support and advice
(Bengtson et al., 2002; Logan & Spitze, 1996; Lye, 1996;
Umberson, 1992). These positive portrayals notwithstanding,
social ties, including family, have both positive and negative
dimensions that may affect well-being both positively and
negatively (Ingersoll-Dayton, Morgan, & Antonucci, 1997;
Krause, 1995; Okun & Keith, 1998).
The potentially mixed qualities of parent­adult child
relations point to a need to recognize the multiple relations
experienced by most parents. Research has typically operation-
alized parent­child relations as individual dyads or children
grouped as a composite. Lye (1996) noted related questions
regarding the appropriate unit of analysis in studies of parent­
child relations. Focusing on a particular parent­child tie, or on
children as an undifferentiated composite, loses information
about how relations with one child fit into and are related to
those with other children within a network of parent­child ties.
Multiple relations include the possibility that some are positive
but others are negative.
There has been attention to within-family differentiation
among adult children in such areas as emotional closeness and
``favoritism'' (e.g., Aldous, Klaus, & Klein, 1985; Suitor &
Pillemer, 2007) and the division of labor in caregiving (e.g.,
Matthews, 1995; Pillemer & Suitor, 2006; Szinovacz & Davey,
2007; Wolf, Freedman, & Soldo, 1997). These studies have
investigated the existence of such differentiation and its
predictors (e.g., gender and family size). I extend that line of
research here to consider the consequences of within-family
differentiation for parent well-being, applying and extending
the concept of ambivalence in parent­child relations.
Research has described parent­adult child relations as being
characterized by intergenerational ambivalence, or ``contra-
dictions and ambiguities in relationships'' (Lowenstein, 2007,
p. S101) at social­structural and subjective­emotional levels
that are reflected in a mix of solidarity and conflict, and
autonomy and dependence (also see Luescher & Pillemer,
1998; Pillemer & Suitor, 2005; Spitze & Gallant, 2004). This
ambivalence has been operationalized as ``mixed feelings''
(e.g., Lowenstein, 2007), but this has largely focused on
particular dyads. Ambivalence may also be extended to
consider relations with multiple children. For example, not
only are some children noted by parents as ``favorites''
(Suitor & Pillemer, 2007), but Aldous and colleagues (1985)
found that parents may refer to some children as more
``comforting'' and others as ``disappointing.'' Thus, there may
be collective ambivalence entailed in mixed feelings across
multiple children.
Ambivalence in parent­adult child relations may be
particularly pertinent to parent well-being. Some have sug-
gested that negative interactions and feelings within social
networks may affect well-being more strongly than positive
interactions; that family ties are more likely than other
relationships to include negative, conflictual, or unbalanced
exchanges; and that negative dimensions of such close ties are
a particular source of distress (Krause, 1995, 2005; Rook,
1997). Krause (1995) suggested that negative interactions may
be more likely with kin than other relationships but that they are
not expected, so problematic relations ``stand out'' when they
occur. Lowenstein (2007) found negative emotions (conflict
and ambivalence) in family relations to be relatively low in
surveys of five countries, but feelings of both solidarity and
ambivalence predicted quality of life among older persons.
Umberson (1992) found that negative aspects in the relation-
ship had stronger associations with distress for both parents and
adult children than did positive, supportive aspects. Thus,
consideration of collective ambivalence across adult children,
and particularly of less positive relations with some children,
can contribute to an understanding of the implications of
parent­adult child relations for parent well-being.
Gender Differences in Parent­Adult Child Relations
Research on parent­adult child relations must attend to
gender differences. Gender is an organizing feature of family
relationships, and the significance and implications of family
ties likely differ for men and women. Women have been
WARD

described as kinkeepers who feel stronger family obligations,
maintain family bonds, and are most involved in assistance and
caregiving (Bengtson, Rosenthal, & Burton, 1990; Logan &
Spitze, 1996; Lye, 1996; Mancini & Blieszner, 1989; Moen,
1996; Rossi, 1993; Silverstein & Bengtson, 1997). Such family
connections carry both benefits and costs and may themselves
be sources of stress (Antonucci, 1990). Pillemer and Suitor
(2002), for example, suggested that mothers feel more
ambivalence in the parent­child relationship.
Gender differences in parent­adult child relations should not
be oversimplified, however; Logan and Spitze (1996) noted that
they are not necessarily straightforward and evidence is not
consistent. For example, they found that women received and
gave more help in exchanges with adult children, but gender
differences were not strong; and although having and helping
children increased family burden for women but not for men,
children were a potential source of distress for both. Umberson
(1992) found that parent­child strains had a greater effect on
mothers than fathers, but others have found similar outcomes of
parent­adult child relations for mothers and fathers (Knoester,
2003; Koropeckyj-Cox, 2002).
Research Questions
This study looked explicitly at relations by parents across
multiple adult children by using a data set that assesses relations
with each of multiple children within a family. The main
question was as follows: How does this contribute to
understanding the implications of parent­adult child relations
for parent well-being? More specifically, the literature suggests
that negative relations with children may have a greater effect
on parent well-being than positive relations. How does this play
out across multiple children, viewed as collective ambivalence?
Does it matter, for example, if the relations with any child
within a network are negative, or are things OK as long as there
are positive ties to any (perhaps favorite) child? I also inves-
tigated parental gender differences in these patterns. Reflecting
their kinkeeping role, I hypothesized that parent­adult child
relations, and especially negative relations and collective
ambivalence, may have a greater effect on the well-being of
mothers. I also included in the analysis other variables that may
be pertinent to parent­adult child relations and their con-
sequences, including parent and family characteristics (e.g.,
parent age, marital status, and health; family size and gender
composition).
METHODS
Sample
Data were from Wave 1 of the National Survey of Families
and Households, a national sample in 1987­1988 of 13,017
persons aged 19 and older representing the noninstitutionalized
U.S. population, with oversampling of some demographic
groups (including Blacks and Hispanics) and household types
(Sweet & Bumpass, 1996). The first wave had particular variety
in measures of parent­child relations, especially about each
adult child, that enabled a more comprehensive view of
relations across multiple children.
I used a subsample, selecting respondents who had at least
one adult child (aged 19 or older) and were themselves aged 50
or older (N ¼ 2,270). Age 50 was the cutoff to focus on parents
in later middle age and beyond and to focus on their relations
with adult children in part by lessening the presence and
implications of relations with younger children. Table 1
summarizes the characteristics of parent respondents (N ¼
2,270) and their adult children (N ¼ 7,322), including parent
age, gender, and marital status; and number, gender, and ages
of adult children. As also noted in the table, nearly one fourth of
parents had a coresident adult child, and almost all had at least
one adult child outside of their household; a minority (13%)
had an adult stepchild, and only 8% had a child younger than
19 in the household.
Measures
My focus was on relations between parents and adult
children and their implications for the well-being of parents. As
an indicator of overall quality of parent­adult child relations,
respondents were asked to ``describe your relationship with
each of these children'' from excellent (7) to very poor (1).
Parents were also asked about frequency of contact with each
adult child during the prior 12 months: ``How often did you
see ___'' (from 1 ¼ not at all to 6 ¼ several times a week;
coresident children were coded as 7 in the analyses). Parents

also reported frequency of contact by letter or telephone and
proximity to children. The ``did you see'' measure represented
a deeper and more personal form of interaction, and neither
letter/phone contact nor proximity exhibited much association
with parent well-being, so I use the former here.
Parents were also asked about assistance to and from each
adult child. Assistance from children included the following:
listens to my problems and provides advice; provides news
about mutual friends and the family; helps out with household
tasks, including transportation; provides financial assistance;
and provides companionship. Assistance to children included
these five dimensions plus child care. I created separate
indicators for instrumental assistance (household tasks, finan-
cial, child care) and expressive assistance (listening, news,
companionship). Preliminary analyses found little difference in
associations with well-being separately for giving and receiving
assistance, and giving and receiving were highly correlated
(indicating strong patterns of reciprocity, as well as multi-
collinearity); for these reasons, measures of exchange of
assistance combined giving and receiving separately for
expressive and instrumental dimensions (the number of times
children were named for each).
There are various options for combining information on
relations across multiple children. Preliminary analyses assessed
different options, including counting number of children versus
whether any child was mentioned for assistance, and counts
versus maximums and minimums across children on quality and
interaction. Empirical patterns considered in selecting which
measures to employ in subsequent analyses included distribu-
tional characteristics (e.g., skewness), intercorrelations among
measures of parent­child relations (to avoid multicollinearity),
and patterns of association with well-being. Indicators of
parent­child quality and contact tended to be skewed positively.
Some measures were intercorrelated; for example, as noted
above, assistance from and to children were highly correlated. It
is interesting, however, that quality of parent­child relations had
only moderate correlations with the other dimensions of their
relations (no higher than .3­.4). Finally, some approaches
yielded stronger associations with well-being. For example,
maximum and minimum quality of parent­child relations had
more consistent associations than did counts of the number of
children who were high or low in quality.
On the basis of these considerations, I selected the following
indicators of parent­child relations for use in subsequent analyses:
maximum and minimum quality of relations and of contact (i.e.,
highest and lowest reports across children), and number of
children reported for exchange of expressive and of instrumental
assistance (to reduce skewness, I recoded these as 0 to 5 or more).
Looking at both highest and lowest quality and contact was
intended to capture collective ambivalence of both positive and
negative (or, perhaps more accurately given the patterns, less
positive) relations across multiple children. I also addressed
collective ambivalence by looking at the extent to which relations
by parents across their adult children combined both higher and
lower levels of quality or contact with different children.
The presentation of results first summarizes patterns of
parent­adult child relations when viewed across multiple
children. The main focus, however, is on associations of
parent­child relations with parent well-being using two
indicators: (a) global happiness (``Taking things all together,
how would you say things are these days''; 1¼very unhappy to
7 ¼ very happy; M ¼ 5.5), and (b) a composite of 12 items
assessing depression included in a ``list of the ways you might
have felt or behaved during the past week'' (aggregated number
of days, M ¼ 13.0).
Multivariate analyses of parent well-being included as
control variables that may affect parent­adult child relations
and parent well-being. These included the following parent
characteristics: age, race/ethnicity (binary variables for Black
and for Hispanic), marital status (a binary variable for married),
health (self-reported, from 1 ¼ very poor to 5 ¼ excellent), and
education (number of years) as an indicator of social class.
Family characteristics included family size (number of adult
children), the presence of a child younger than 19, gender
composition of adult children (binary variables for sons only
and daughters only, with both sons and daughters as the omitted
category), and having an adult stepchild.

Assessing across multiple children yields a more compre-
hensive and diverse view of parent­adult child relations.

any child), the highest reported interaction (more than weekly
for any child) and lowest interaction (less than weekly for any
child), and whether any child was named for giving or receiving
expressive or instrumental assistance. As described below, the
table also presents frequencies of parents' reported mixed
patterns of quality and interaction across children (i.e., higher
for some children but lower for others).
Looking at maximum quality of relations, 83% reported
``excellent'' (7) relations with at least one child, reflecting the
typical positive skew in such ratings; but the minimum measure
indicated that 16% reported codes of 1 to 4 and another 21%
reported 5 or 6 for at least one child. Similarly with interaction,
most parents (58%) reported seeing at least one child at least
several times a week (maximum), but 14% saw at least one
child ``not at all,'' 17% only ``about once a year,'' and 43% less
than weekly (minimum). Substantial majorities of parents
reported exchanges of assistance (given or received) with adult
children, with expressive more common than instrumental.
There were also indications that parents had mixed relations
among their children, reflecting collective ambivalence (see
``Mixed quality'' and ``Mixed interaction'' in Table 2). For
reported quality, 62% of parents reported only the highest
rating (7) for all of their children, but 21% reported both a high
rating (7) for some children and lower (1­6) ratings for other
children; another 17% reported only ratings lower than 7 for all
of their children. For interaction, 26% saw all of their children
at least once a week, but 47% saw some children that often and
other children less often; another 27% saw all of their children
less than once a week.
As anticipated, mothers reported higher maximum quality
and interaction than did fathers, but quality and interaction
minimums did not differ significantly by parent gender; and
mothers were less likely to have lower quality or interaction
with all of their children. Thus, mothers appeared to experience
more positive relations across children without also experienc-
ing more negative relations. Mothers also reported more
exchanges of aid. Other analyses indicated that larger families
(more adult children) entailed both more positive and more
negative relations, though exchange of assistance was less
sensitive to family size; sons and daughters had comparable
maximum and minimum quality of relations, with mothers
reporting more positive relations with both sons and daughters;
and relations with adult stepchildren entailed lower quality,
interaction, and exchange of assistance (for details of these
analyses, see Ward, 2007).
To summarize, incorporating information from all adult
children yields a more complete view of parent­adult child
relations. In particular, compared with reports for individual
parent­child dyads or ``averages'' combined across children,
assessing lowest levels of quality and contact across multiple
children uncovers more indications of negative (or less
positive) relations. It is apparent that mixed relations across
adult children (collective ambivalence) is not uncommon for
middle-aged and older parents. What are the implications of
these relations for parent well-being?
Parent­Adult Child Relations and Parent Well-Being
The main focus here is the implications of parent­adult child
relations for parent well-being. I conducted regression analyses
with parent happiness and depression as dependent variables. I
anticipated that negative relations with children and collective
ambivalence would be more influential than positive relations.
Preliminary analyses indicated that minimum scores for adult
child quality had stronger associations with well-being than
maximum quality. I also included minimum contact as a parallel
predictor; these measures of quality and contact were only
modestly correlated (r ¼ .34). I also included measures of
exchange of expressive and instrumental assistance (number of
children named for giving/receiving each) as predictors; assis-
tance is not directly related to ambivalence, but it is an important
dimension of parent­adult child relations that may affect parent
well-being, though it is not obvious whether assistance
exchanges would affect well-being positively or negatively.
Table 3 presents regression results for the total sample and
separately for mothers and fathers. I conducted additional
subgroup analyses by age (50­59 vs 60þ), marital status
(married vs not married), and number and gender of adult
children. I assessed the latter to investigate whether relations
with adult children might be more influential, for example, if
there are only one or two children or only sons or daughters, as
well as whether the implications of these factors differ for
mothers and fathers. Table 3 does not report those analyses, but
I refer to them in the text. As noted earlier, control variables in
the analyses included parent and family characteristics.
To begin with overall happiness, being married and having
better subjective health were the most consistent predictors; this
was true across all of the subgroup analyses. Of particular
relevance to the focus here, however, quality of parent­child
relations also exhibited a consistent albeit modest association:
Parents exhibited greater happiness when the lowest (mini-
mum) quality of relations across their children was higher. Size
of the coefficient for minimum quality varied some across
subgroups; for example, it was somewhat higher for mothers,
for older (60þ) parents, and for unmarried parents. But
subgroup differences were quite modest (coefficients ranged
between .08 and .15); in particular, differences in the coeffi-
cients for mothers and fathers were not statistically significant.
Furthermore, the coefficient for minimum quality was the same
for small families (one or two adult children) as for larger
families, indicating that lower quality relations with any child
reduced parent well-being, even when there were multiple
children that included relationships with higher quality. Contact
and exchange of assistance, and the number of children, in
contrast, exhibited little association with parent happiness.
Child gender appeared to play little role in these patterns of
well-being. Preliminary analyses found that correlations with
well-being were similar for measures of quality of relations
with sons and with daughters for both mothers and fathers.
Furthermore, gender composition of children was unrelated to
happiness (see Table 3); analyses for sons-only and daughters-
only families (not shown) exhibited similar patterns to those for
the sample as a whole for both mothers and fathers.
Looking at patterns for depression, subjective health was
again a consistent predictor. Depression was also lower for men
and for married and better educated parents. Better parent­child
quality (a higher minimum rating) was associated with less
depression; the magnitude of these coefficients was comparable
to those for gender, marital status, and education. As with
happiness, associations for parent­child quality and patterns for
mothers and fathers were similar across subgroup analyses,
PARENT­CHILD RELATIONS AND WELL-BEING S243
including those respondents with only one or two adult children
and those with only sons or only daughters. Also as with
happiness, other measures of parent­child relations and family
characteristics exhibited little association with depression. In
summary, although coefficients for parent­child minimum
quality with happiness and depression were not high, they
were consistently significant across a variety of subgroup
analyses, including parent gender and the number and gender of
children. Only health, and to a lesser extent marital status, had
stronger and more consistent associations with well-being.
I repeated analyses in Table 3 using maximum quality and
interaction with adult children as predictors in place of the
minimum measures. Maximum quality had a somewhat
stronger association with happiness than its minimum counter-
part for fathers (b ¼ .13,vs .08, p , .05). With that exception,
however, the more positive indicators of parent­child relations
exhibited weaker associations with well-being than did the
minimum indicators.
To further explore the implications of negative parent­adult
child relations and of collective ambivalence, the bottom of
Table 3 reports findings using indicators of either mixed or
consistently low quality and contact with children; each is
a binary variable, with highest quality (7) and at least weekly
contact for all children, respectively, as omitted comparison
groups. Those results further highlighted the relevance of
negative (or less positive) relations with at least some children.
Compared with parents who reported consistently high quality
across their adult children, those who reported more mixed
relations and especially those who reported consistently lower
quality had lower happiness and higher depression. Further-
more, low contact with all children also exhibited associations

DISCUSSION
Parent­child ties are important and increasingly long lasting.
Parents and adult children generally report quite positive
relations and are important sources of gratification and
assistance. But attention is needed to parent­adult child
relations as networks of multiple ties and interactions with
both positive and negative qualities and outcomes. This article
has extended the concept of ambivalence in parent­adult child

relationships to a consideration of collective ambivalence
across children. Incorporating information from all adult
children in assessing parent­child relations yields a more
complete view, in particular illuminating a collective ambiva-
lence of mixed and negative relations between parents and their
adult children.
Looking at multiple parent­adult child relations also enables
a better understanding of the implications of parent­adult child
relations for parent well-being. Past research has found limited
and inconsistent evidence that such relations affect well-being.
Here, however, there is evidence that parent­adult child
relations have a consistent, albeit modest, contribution to
parent well-being. This cuts across a variety of demographic
and family subgroups, including parent age and marital status
and family size. It appears that perceived quality of parent­
child relations matters more than quantity (in terms of contact
or exchanges of assistance). Furthermore, more negative
aspects of parent­child relations, especially lower quality
with at least one child (and especially with all children),
appear to be more salient than positive aspects, as Krause
(1995) and Umberson (1992) have also suggested. It may not
be relations with a favorite child that matter so much to parent
well-being as those involving less favored or more problematic
children.
I expected parental gender differences in parent­adult child
relations and their implications for parent well-being, but there
were both differences and similarities between mothers and
fathers. Mothers reported more positive quality across multiple
children, as well as greater contact and exchange of assistance,
but mothers did not report more negative relations. Compared
with those of fathers, mothers' relations with adult children
appeared to exhibit more benefits without more ``costs,'' or
collective ambivalence. However, there were not significant
differences between mothers and fathers in the implications of
negative relations with adult children for well-being. As Logan
and Spitze (1996) noted, gender differences may not be as clear
cut as often presumed; and, as here, they found that adult
children were a potential source of distress for both mothers and
fathers.
In addition to parent gender, the analyses reported here sought
to assess the role of child gender in various ways. Previous
analyses indicated that quality of relations reported by parents is
similar for sons and daughters (see Ward, 2007). In the analyses
for this article I found that measures of relations with sons and
daughters were correlated similarly with the well-being of
mothers and fathers, that the gender composition of adult
children was not related to parent well-being, and that patterns
did not vary for sons-only or daughters-only families. Thus, the
implications of relations with children for parent well-being
investigated here do not appear to depend on child gender.
I should acknowledge some limitations of this research. It
relied on parent reports of parent­child relations. Parents tend to
give somewhat more positive reports than children (Aquilino,
1999); thus, child reports might have exhibited more mixed
relations and collective ambivalence. Parents' perspectives are
more relevant here, however, for the focus on parent well-being.
This cross-sectional view cannot be unequivocal about causal
ordering in the association between the quality of parent­adult
child relations and parent well-being. It seems reasonable that
negative relations with children (and especially with all of one's
children) reduce parental well-being, but it is plausible that
causality may operate also in the other direction: Parent
depression or unhappiness may cause strains in parent­adult
child relations, and difficult parents may alienate their children.
The data employed here were gathered 20 years ago. It is not
uncommon to use such ``older'' data, especially with data sets as
rich as the National Survey of Families and Households and
when not addressing issues and events that be may relatively
specific to particular cohorts or historical periods. Nonetheless,
the salience of parent­adult child relations in the lives of both
generations, and their implications for parent well-being, might
vary by cohort and/or period. Gans and Silverstein (2006) noted
that historical conditions that shape the values of birth cohorts
may yield variation in family values and expectations; in
particular, they cited suggestions that there has been a decline in
the salience of family values in American society. However,
Gans and Silverstein found that although there was evidence that
filial norms had weakened some between 1985 and the 1990s,
later born baby boom cohorts expressed slightly stronger norms
of filial responsibility than did earlier cohorts. Bengtson and
colleagues (2002) argued that there is more support for continued
family solidarity than for a ``family decline'' perspective. Logan
and Spitze (1996) suggested that such factors as divorce, single
parenthood, and increased longevity and widowhood may have
heightened the salience of parent­child relations as the most
enduring relationship. Thus, it is reasonable to anticipate that
parent­adult child relations continue to affect parent well-being
now in ways that are similar to patterns in these data, with similar
conceptual underpinnings.
This was also a relatively exploratory look at the issues
addressed here. Although the data set used here is unusual in
providing information about relations between parents and each
of their adult children, available measures of those relations were
limited in depth and variety. In particular, measurement of
relationship quality rested on a single item. More direct measures
are needed that assess ambivalence both in particular parent­adult
child relationships and collectively across multiple children.
Analyses here considered some of the predictors of parent­
adult child relations and parent well-being. Gender differences
were a particular focus, with standard controls for parent and
family characteristics incorporated into the multivariate analy-
ses; some of these (age, marital status, and family size) were
investigated further through subgroup analyses. Further re-
search should explore in more depth the role of other factors,
including the characteristics of parents, adult children, and
parent­child dyads. For example, although there was some
attention to child gender here, more in-depth assessment of
same- and different-gender parent­child dyads is warranted. In
addition, the quality of other relationships, such as marital or
other social ties, may also affect parent­child relations and their
consequences.
I also suggested in the introduction that parents may be
affected by circumstances in the lives of adult children--their
successes or failures. These may themselves affect parent well-
being independent of, or in spite of, the nature and quality of
parent­child relations. They may also affect parent­child
relations and thereby affect parent well-being, as Knoester
(2003) suggested that the quality of parent­adult child relations
mediates links between parent and child well-being. Future
work should consider the implications of child experiences,
PARENT­CHILD RELATIONS AND WELL-BEING S245
such as job promotion (or loss) and marriage (or divorce), for
both parent­child relations and parent well-being.
There are other ways in which the research and issues
addressed here can be extended. Luescher and Pillemer (1998)
indicated that a dynamic life course approach is warranted for
understanding ambivalence, and that ambivalence can be either
a dependent or independent variable. Suitor and Pillemer (2007)
noted that the developmental literature on young and adolescent
children has found parental differentiation among children on vari-
ous dimensions; parent­adult child ambivalence itself has roots
in family history and early parent­child relations (Luescher &
Pillemer, 1998). Thus, early parent­child relations affect sub-
sequent within-family differentiation among adult children; for
example, Suitor and Pillemer (2007) found differences between
first- and last-born adult children in emotional closeness and
preferences for assistance. Differences across children in adult life
course transitions and statuses, such as marital and parental status,
are likely to be sources of further differentiation across children
(Aldous et al., 1985; Aquilino, 1997; Kaufman & Uhlenberg,
1998; Knoester, 2003; Umberson, 1992).
The focus here was the implications of within-family
differentiation and ambivalence in parent­adult child relations
for parent well-being. Other potential outcomes should be
explored. For example, Pillemer and Suitor (2006) investigated
parent preferences for particular children as caregivers and how
this is related to variation in emotional closeness and past
exchanges of assistance with children.
Recognition of multiple parent­adult child relations also
directs attention to how relations with one or some children
may affect relations with other children in the same family, and
how these interconnecting ties affect parent­child relations and
parent well-being. For example, modeling by Spitze, Logan,
Deane, and Zerger (1994) of parent­adult child exchanges
suggested the existence of sibling dependence in such
exchanges. Further research needs to address and bring in the
effects of relations with one adult child on those with others.
