Aim: To evaluate the effects of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor (statin) treatment on serum inflam-
matory markers using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES
1999-2004).
Methods and Results: A total of 9,128 individuals aged 40 and older participated in the NHANES.
The inflammatory markers studied were white blood cell counts (WBC), high sensitivity C-reactive
protein (CRP) and ferritin. Other covariables were: age, gender, race/ethnicity, body mass index, pre-
scription or nonprescription medication use within the previous 30 days (statins, anti-inflammatory
drugs, antibiotics). Four analytic groups for drug use were defined: Statin users; AI/Antibiotic users
(use of either anti-inflammatory or antibiotic drugs); Combination group (use of both Statins and
anti-inflammatory or antibiotic drugs), and a Non-use group (taking none of the listed drugs). The
mean CRP level was significantly lower in the Statin use group than the Non-use group (0.3 mg/dL,
95%CI: 0.3-0.3 and 0.4 mg/dL, 95%CI: 0.4-0.5). In multivariable regression modeling, the Statin
use group had significantly lower predicted mean WBC (Beta Coeff: 0.2, p0.05) and CRP (Beta
Coeff: 0.1, p0.01) values than the Non-use group.
Conclusions: Treatment with statins was significantly associated with decreased WBC and CRP lev-
els in this large population-based sample.

Therapeutic intervention using inhibitors of
3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA)
reductase, or "statins," has been demonstrated to
reduce levels of inflammatory biomarkers indepen-
dently of their effects on cholesterol. Animal studies
have shown that statins reduce low density lipoprotein
(LDL) and also affect the inflammatory process by
preventing leukocyte recruitment and adhesion to the
vascular endothelium6, 7). Since cellular immune acti-
vation and oxidative stress play a major role in the
pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases, the anti-
inflammatory capacity of statins could contribute to
reduce mortality and cardiovascular morbidity in
patients with hyperlipidemia and those with coronary
Introduction
Elevated serum inflammatory markers such as
serum concentrations of C-reactive protein (CRP),
pro-inflammatory cytokines, cellular adhesion mole-
cules, and white blood cell counts (WBC) have
received increasing attention in recent years as bio-
markers for inflammation associated with atheroscle-
rosis, coronary artery disease, and stroke1, 2). Of these

artery disease8-10). Recent meta-analyses have also
demonstrated that statins reduce death, recurrent
myocardial infarction and stroke in patients with acute
coronary artery disease11, 12).
Both clinical and community-based studies have
shown the role of statins in reducing important inflam-
matory markers such as CRP and WBC2, 4, 13-15); how-
ever, the effect of statins on the inflammatory response
in the general population has not been reported for a
nationally representative sample. This analysis evalu-
ates the relationship between inflammatory markers
(WBC, CRP and Ferritin) and recent Statin treatment
using data from the National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey (NHANES 1999-2004).
Methods
The National Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey (NHANES) is a complex, multistage, strati-
fied, cluster sample design survey. The survey was
designed to assess the health and nutritional status of
the non-institutionalized U.S. population by a health-
related household questionnaire, medical examina-
tions, physiological measurements and laboratory
(blood) tests. More detailed information on the
NHANES is available elsewhere16).
There were 13,498 adults aged 40 and older
selected to participate in the NHANES 1999-2004,
of whom 9,970 were interviewed (73.9%) and 9,145
(67.8%) were interviewed and examined. After exclud-
ing pregnant women (n 10) and missing values on
non-response items regarding the use of prescription
and over-the-counter medication (n 7), 9,128 adults
were included in the analysis. For participants age 40
and over, data on WBC counts were available for 8,735
individuals, for CRP 8,611, and for ferritin 5,691,
respectively. Only four years of NHANES data for
serum ferritin (NHANES 1999-2002) were available.
Among those available individuals WBC 3.0 (SI)
and 12.5 (SI), (n 180) CRP values 10 mg/dL
(n 20) and ferritin values 500 ng/mL (n 237)
were excluded from the analysis because they most
likely reflected the effects of acute, rather than chronic
inflammation.
Age, gender and race/ethnicity were included as
demographic variables. Blood samples were obtained
by health technologists during the MEC examination
and tested for WBC, serum CRP, ferritin levels and
cholesterol levels. Information on laboratory test
methods are available elsewhere16). WBC counts are
reported in SI units; CRP as mg/dL; and ferritin as
ng/mL. Self-reported diagnosed diabetes mellitus, cig-
arette smoking (defined as having smoked at least 100
cigarettes during one's lifetime and currently smoking
every day or some days), BMI and hypertension (sys-
tolic blood pressure 140 mm Hg or a diastolic pres-
sure 90 mm Hg or current use of anti-hypertensive
medications17)) were included in the multivariate
regression model as potential confounders.
Information on the history of prescribed medica-
tion use within the previous 30 days (statins, anti-
inflammatory and antibiotics), and analgesic and pain
reliever use within the previous 30 days (also anti-
inflammatory drugs) was also collected. The informa-
tion on prescribed and over-the-counter medications
was obtained by an affirmative answer to the follow-
ing questions: "In the past month, have you used or
taken medication for which a prescription is needed?"
If the response was "yes", verification by the trained
interviewer consisted of recording the standard generic
name of the medication and the FDA/NDC therapeu-
tic drug class codes and Multum Lexicon Therapeutic
classification codes directly from the prescription con-
tainers. The participants were also specifically asked a
question about prescription and non-prescription pain
medication use (analgesics and pain relievers).
Four analytic groups were defined as follows:
Statin group (use of statins, n 640) AI/Antibiotic
group (use of anti-inflammatory and/or antibiotic
drugs, n 3,351), Combination group (use of statins
along with anti-inflammatory and/or antibiotic drugs,
n 791), and the Non-use group (taking none of the
above mentioned drugs, n 4,346). Other types of
lipid-lowering drugs (n 198) were defined as the
Non-use group.
Statistical Analyses
Estimated mean inflammatory marker levels
(WBC, CRP and ferritin) and the percent in each
medication use group (Statins, AI/Antibiotics, Com-
bination, and Non-use) together with their standard
errors are presented. Sample weights which account
for the unequal probability of selection and adjust for
non-response and non-coverage are incorporated in
the estimation procedure. The means of the inflam-
matory markers and the group percent of medication
use categories were age-adjusted by the direct method
to the projected year 2000 US Census population
using the age groups 40-59 years, and 60 years or
older18). The standard errors were estimated using Tay-
lor Series Linearization, a design-based approach. Sta-
tistical hypotheses were tested univariately at 0.05
level using Student's t test. The Bonferroni method
was applied to adjust for multiple comparisons by
dividing the overall  level by the number of compari-
sons being made. To control for potential confound-

ers, 3 separate multivariate regression analyses, one for
each of the 3 inflammatory makers (WBC, CRP, and
Ferritin) as the dependent variable were conducted.
The models included the covariates age, gender, race/
ethnicity, hypertension, diabetes, smoking, use of
Statins, anti-inflammatory drugs and antibiotics.
Additionally, Ferritin level in the multivariable regres-
sion modeling was analyzed separately for men and
women due to known gender differences in normal
range values (men: 20-250 ng/mL, women: 10-120
ng/mL)19). The statistical programs SAS version 9.1
and SUDAAN were used.
Results
Table 1 presents descriptive data for age-adjusted
and age-specific mean levels of the three inflammatory
markers and also descriptive data for each of the three
medication usage groups. Overall, 6.8% of those age
40 years and older were taking statins; 27.3% were
taking anti-inflammatories and/or antibiotics alone;
and 8.4% were taking both statins and anti-
inflammatories/antibiotics. Medication usage preva-
lence in all three groups significantly increased with
age. Men were more likely to take statins (p0.05)
and women were more likely to take anti-inflamma-
tory drugs and/or antibiotics (p0.05). Non-Hispanic
whites had a significantly higher prevalence of statin
use than either non-Hispanic blacks or Mexican-
Americans (p0.01 for each comparison).
The mean CRP level was significantly higher
among those aged 60 years than in those age 40-59
years (p0.05). Mean ferritin levels significantly
decreased with age among men (age 40-59 years vs.
age 60 years p0.05); however, they significantly
increased by age among women (age 40-59 years vs.
age 60 years, p0.05). Both the mean CRP and
WBC levels were lower in men than women (p0.05
for both CRP and WBC). Statistical differences in fer-
ritin levels between men and women are not presented
as ferritin reference ranges but are known to be higher
in men than women18). Those with a BMI 25

showed a significantly lower mean WBC, mean CRP
and mean ferritin levels than those who had BMI 30
(p0.01 for each comparison, respectively).
Non-Hispanic blacks had higher CRP levels than
either non-Hispanic whites or Mexican-Americans
(p0.01 for each comparison). Non-Hispanic black
women had significantly higher ferritin levels than
non-Hispanic white women (p0.01) and Mexican-
Americans (p0.01). On the other hand, the mean
WBC was lower among non-Hispanic blacks than
both non-Hispanic whites (p0.01) and Mexican-
Americans (p0.01).
Table 2 presents the age-adjusted mean concen-
tration of inflammatory markers by medication use
group. The mean levels of WBC in the statin use
group were not significantly different from the Non-
use group; however, in both the AI/antibiotic and
combination groups, WBC levels were significantly
higher than in the Non-use group (both p0.01).
The mean CRP level was significantly lower in indi-
viduals in the statin use group than in the Non-use
group (both p0.01). The AI/Antibiotics and Com-
bination groups also each had significantly higher
mean CRP levels than the Non-use group (both p
0.01). For both men and women, the mean ferritin
level in the Statin use group was not significantly dif-
ferent from that of the Non-use group; however, the
mean ferritin level in both the female AI/Antibiotics
and Combination groups were was significantly higher
than in women in the Non-use group (both p0.01).
Table 3 presents multiple linear regression analy-
sis for the independent correlates of the mean levels of
the inflammatory markers, WBC, CRP and ferritin.
In the WBC analysis, individuals in the Statin use
group had significantly lower predicted mean WBC
than those in the Non-use group after adjusting for
other variables in the model (p0.05). Men had sig-
nificantly lower mean WBC than women (p0.05).
Significant interactions were observed in the WBC
analysis between BMI and age; BMI and smoking;
BMI and hypertension; diabetes and hypertension;
smoking and race/ethnicity; and smoking and hyper-
tension. Interaction terms were included in the model.
There was a lower mean CRP in the Statin use
group than the Non-use reference group after adjust-

however, the Combination use group also had a sig-
nificantly higher mean CRP than the Non-use group
(p0.01). The estimated coefficient for CRP also
showed lower mean CRP levels in men than in women
(p0.01) and higher mean CRP in diabetics than in
non-diabetics (p0.05) (data not shown). In the CRP
analysis, significant interactions were observed
between BMI and age, BMI and hypertension, and
smoking and race/ethnicity.
In multiple linear regression modeling, there was
no significant difference in ferritin levels between the
Statin use group or either of the other two medication
use groups when compared to the Non-use reference
group. This was true in the analyses of both men and
women. By gender, men with a BMI 25-29 who were
smokers or who were non-Hispanic blacks had higher
ferritin levels than their respective reference groups
(p0.01, 0.05 and 0.01, respectively; data not
shown). Significantly higher serum ferritin levels were
found among women aged 60 years, who were non-
Hispanic blacks, smokers, had BMI 25 or had
hypertension or diabetes than their respective refer-
ence groups (all p0.01 except for smoking p0.05;
data not shown). No significant interaction effects
were observed for either men or women in the ferritin
multivariable regression modeling.
Discussion
This study showed that statin use was associated
with significantly decreased WBC counts and CRP
after adjusting for potential confounders. This result
supports the hypothesis that statins reduce serum lev-
els of both CRP and WBC14). Some of the anti-
inflammatory effects of statins have been proposed to
be due to inhibition of the production of isoprenoids,
which share a biosynthetic pathway with choles-
terol20). Since these isoprenoids have effects on G-pro-
tein, adhesion molecules, and cell proliferation, block-
ing their production could have a profound effect on
these inflammation-related functional systems21, 22). As
an alternative theory, simply reducing the total
amount of cholesterol available for plaque formation
may lower the cholesterol content of atherosclerotic
plaques, leading to smaller and fewer plaques, there-
fore providing a net decreased physical basis for
inflammation to occur. If the alternative theory is
true, other lipid-lowering drugs might have an anti-
inflammatory effect as well as statins. Unfortunately,
the present analysis did not have a sufficient sample
size for non-statin cholesterol-lowering drugs to test
whether there is any anti-inflammatory effect with
other lipid-lowering agents, such as gemfibrozil, cho-
lesterol absorption inhibitors or fibric acid derivatives.
Although it is not possible to assess the long-
term outcomes of statin treatment from this analysis,
a number of previous studies have shown a relation-
ship between statin treatment and risk reduction in
coronary heart disease via reducing CRP levels14, 23).
Both experimental studies and clinical trials have dem-
onstrated that the magnitude of risk reduction in cor-
onary events attributable to statins is substantially
greater among those with evidence of inflammation
than in those without any inflammation, as measured
by CRP levels23-25). A similar result was reported in the
Cholesterol and Recurrent Events study which dem-
onstrated that the greatest benefit of Statin treatment
(Pravastatin 40 mg/day) was achieved in the group
with the highest baseline CRP (a 54% reduction in
cardiovascular events compared with 25% in the low-
est quartile for CRP)24). It appears that Pravastatin,
in addition to having a beneficial effect on the lipid
profile, reduces CRP in these patients and has its
greatest benefit in patients with the highest CRP lev-
els. These results may imply that inflammation and
total cholesterol levels are equally important in athero-
genesis14, 24, 26-28). New guidelines from the American
Heart Association and the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention (2003) advised doctors to consider
testing Americans at moderate risk of heart disease for
signs of inflammation in the bloodstream29).
Ferritin has been identified as an acute phase
inflammatory marker that, together with CRP and
WBC, accelerates the oxidation of LDL, and induces
inflammation in the blood vessels5, 30). In the present
analysis there was no significant difference in ferritin
levels between the Statin use group and Non-use
group. In the older age group (60 years and older) and
in those with high blood pressure, our analysis showed
a lower predicted Ferritin level among men. Women
in the 60 year age group with high blood pressure had
higher predicted ferritin levels. This could in part be
explained as an artifact of the differences in baseline
ferritin levels by age in men and women. In the litera-
ture, there is a relative lack of published data concern-
ing ferritin levels in different age and gender groups;
however, our data showed a modest negative associa-
tion between age as a continuous variable and ferritin
levels among men, but a modest positive association
between age and ferritin levels amongst women (data
not presented). This difference might have been
caused by changes brought on by onset of menopause.
Also, the relationship between high blood pressure
and ferritin may be complicated by the age distribu-
tion and the prevalence of high blood pressure in both
men and women31). Over 65% of the population aged
1181
4UBUJOTBOE*OGMBNNBUPSZ.BSLFST
60 years and older has high blood pressure31). As
expected, the predicted mean ferritin levels among
smokers and diabetics were significantly higher than
their counterparts. These results are consistent with
prior studies, supporting the reported positive rela-
tionship between inflammatory markers and diabetes
and cigarette smoking32, 33). At present, no studies have
revealed any relationship between the medications
used to control high blood pressure or diabetes and
serum ferritin levels.
Limitations of our analysis include the fact that
the NHANES survey is a cross-sectional study, and
the statistical associations noted here may not be sup-
ported by prospective or longitudinal studies. Also,
our self-reported history of medication does not
account for differences between statin sub-types, the
dose, schedule or duration of statin treatment, or with
compliance or differences in the relative efficacy of
lipid lowering among the various statins. Low-density
lipoprotein was not included in our analysis since the
purpose of the study was to assess the relationship
between statins and inflammatory markers rather than
lowering the lipid level, per se.
In this study, we were also careful to include a
separate category representing the effects of the major
drug classes known to have anti-inflammatory effects,
so as to control for their possible effects in the analy-
sis. There were, however, limitations on our ability to
address this important issue. For example, no data
were available on the details of the nature and activity
of the underlying disease being treated in this sub-
group, to inform the overall analysis. Also, we looked
at the potential effects of other prescription drugs on
serum inflammatory marker levels. We performed a
sensitivity analysis of the potential effects of other
(non-statin) types of lipid-lowering drugs (n 198;
data not shown); however, because this analysis did
not show any effects, the relatively small number of
persons taking non-statin lipid lowering drugs was
added to the Non-use reference group due to insuffi-
cient sample size. It would, however, be useful in the
future to study the comparative anti-inflammatory
effects of statins and other types of lipid-lowering drugs
when possible. Finally, there is a theoretic possibility
that other prescription drugs could also be associated
with lower CRP, WBC or ferretin levels, but we had no
a priori reason to believe that was actually the case.
In summary, the use of statins was significantly
associated with decreased WBC and CRP, however,
mean ferritin was not significantly decreased. This
analysis supports the hypothesis that statins have anti-
inflammatory effects which may possibly help to mod-
erate the risk of heart disease and stroke.
