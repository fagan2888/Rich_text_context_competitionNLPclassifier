Background--We sought to describe the resuscitation preferences of patients hospitalized with an exacerbation of severe
congestive heart failure, perceptions of those preferences by their physicians, and the stability of the preferences.
Methods and Results--Of 936 patients in this study, 215 (23%) explicitly stated that they did not want to be resuscitated.
Significant correlates of not wanting to be resuscitated included older age, perception of a worse prognosis, poorer
functional status, and higher income. The physician's perception of the patient's preference disagreed with the patient's
actual preference in 24% of the cases overall. Only 25% of the patients reported discussing resuscitation preferences
with their physician, but discussion of preferences was not significantly associated with higher agreement between the
patient and physician. Of the 600 patients who responded to the resuscitation question again 2 months later, 19% had
changed their preferences, including 14% of those who initially wanted resuscitation (69 of 480) and 40% of those who
initially did not (48 of 120). The physician's perception of the patient's hospital resuscitation preference was correct for
84% of patients who had a stable preference and 68% of those who did not.
Conclusions--Almost one quarter of patients hospitalized with severe heart failure expressed a preference not to be
resuscitated. The physician's perception of the patient's preference was not accurate in about one quarter of the cases,
but communication was not associated with greater agreement between the patient and the physician. A substantial
proportion of patients who did not want to be resuscitated changed their minds within 2 months of discharge.

Key Words: resuscitation  patients  heart failure
The end of life for patients with severe congestive heart
failure is often characterized by repeated hospitalizations
and a progressively declining quality of life. Although many
patients with poor prognoses refuse medical interventions,1
patients with severe congestive heart failure usually receive
maximal medical therapy until death. The prevalence of do-not-
resuscitate (DNR) orders in patients with severe congestive heart
failure has been reported to be 5%,1 and patients with conges-
tive heart failure who die in the hospital commonly undergo
cardiopulmonary resuscitation.2 Although it is not known why
DNR orders are written infrequently in this population, physi-
cians discuss resuscitation issues less often with patients with
severe congestive heart failure than with patients who have other
terminal diseases such as AIDS or cancer.1
See p 619
Until recently there has been very little information about the
resuscitation preferences of patients with severe congestive heart
failure. To address this issue in detail, we used data obtained as
part of the Study to Understand Prognoses and Preferences for
Outcomes and Risks of Treatments (SUPPORT) project,3 a
prospective multicenter study of prognoses and preferences for
treatment for severely ill patients, including individuals hospi-
talized with an exacerbation of severe congestive heart failure
(New York Heart Association class IV, or clinical heart failure
and an ejection fraction 20%). In the SUPPORT project,
patients and their physicians were asked about the patient's
health, quality of life, daily activity level, functional status,
prognosis, and resuscitation preferences.

Methods
Study Design
Patients in SUPPORT had 1 of 9 high-mortality conditions: acute
exacerbation of congestive heart failure, acute respiratory failure,
acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic
liver disease, nontraumatic coma, colon cancer metastatic to liver,
stage III/IV non­small cell carcinoma of the lung, multiple organ
system failure with malignancy, and multiple organ failure and
sepsis.4 Patients, their designated surrogate decision makers (usually
family members), and physicians were interviewed at several points
in the patient's hospitalization. The study was conducted at 5
hospitals: Beth Israel Hospital, Boston, Mass; MetroHealth Medical
Center, Cleveland, Ohio; Duke University Medical Center, Durham,
NC; Marshfield Clinic/St Joseph's Hospital, Marshfield, Wis; and
the University of California School of Medicine, Los Angeles, Calif.
The coordinating center was the Intensive Care Unit Research Unit
at the George Washington University Medical Center.
Phase 1 (1989 to 1991) of SUPPORT was designed to evaluate
preferences, decisions, and outcomes of severely ill hospitalized
patients. Phase 2 (1992 to 1994) was a clinical trial of a program that
provided information about patient prognoses and preferences for
end-of-life care and a nurse-based intervention to facilitate commu-
nication. The program failed to increase the frequency of DNR
orders or to reduce the number of days it took to write them.
Furthermore, there were no secular trends in DNR order writing
during the study period (1989 to 1994). Thus, the data from both
phases were combined for this analysis.3
Patient Sample
Subjects in this analysis were restricted to patients with an acute
exacerbation of symptoms of chronic congestive heart failure as the
primary reason for hospital admission or transfer to an intensive care
unit and at least 1 of the following 3 conditions: (1) a history of
severe congestive heart failure at baseline (New York Heart Asso-
ciation class IV) despite being treated medically with 2 or more of
the following classes of drugs: diuretics, vasodilators, and ACE
inhibitors; (2) a definite history of New York Heart Association class
IV congestive heart failure at hospital admission; or (3) documen-
tation of a left ventricular ejection fraction 20%. Patients were
excluded from the study if they had any of the following conditions:
severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, high output conges-
tive heart failure, septic shock, primary acute renal failure, circula-
tory overload caused by excessive administration of fluids, cardiac
surgery scheduled within 24 hours, congestive heart failure caused
by valvular heart disease, or a thoracotomy on the same admission
and before study entry.
Clinical Data
Clinical data were obtained by chart review and included cardiac
history; comorbid conditions; information required to calculate an
acute physiology score (based on the APACHE III scoring system5);
and documentation of decisions related to the use of life-sustaining
therapy, including the presence of a DNR order. The acute physiol-
ogy score, measured on study days 1, 3, 7, 14, and 25, is a composite
of information about heart rate; mean blood pressure; temperature;
respiratory rate; partial pressure of oxygen; arterial-alveolar oxygen
gradient; hematocrit; white blood cell count; creatinine; urine output;
blood urea nitrogen; sodium; albumin; bilirubin; glucose; arterial
blood pH; and neurological abnormalities. A previously published
model of 180-day mortality in SUPPORT was used to determine an
"objective" measure of the patient's prognosis.6 This model includes
the following variables: diagnosis, age, number of days in the
hospital before study entry, presence of cancer, neurological func-
tion, and 11 physiological measures.
Patient Interviews
Patients were approached to be interviewed between days 3 and 6
after enrollment in the study and 2 months after discharge. Patients
passing the test of cognitive function7 were then questioned about
their resuscitation preferences, probability of survival, functional
status, symptoms, quality of life, and sociodemographics. Patients
were asked, "What are the chances that you will live for 2 months or
more (and 6 months or more) if the current plan of care stays the
same?" Patients also were asked, "What are the chances that you will
be able to take care of yourself 2 months (and 6 months) from now?"
Patients were asked to rate their quality of life ("How would you rate
the overall quality of your life at present?") on a 5-point scale from
excellent to poor.
Functional status in the 2 weeks before admission was assessed by
a revised version of the Katz Activities of Daily Living score8 on the
basis of the ability to perform bathing, dressing, toileting, transfer,
continence, and feeding. A summary score was calculated, with 0
indicating independence in all categories. Activity status 2 weeks
before admission was estimated by a revised version of the Duke
Activity Status Index,8 which is a modification of the Specific
Activity Scale.9 Activity status was defined as the ability of patients
to perform personal, household, and recreational activities associated
with known metabolic costs.
The question about resuscitation was as follows: "As you probably
know, there are a number of things that doctors can do to try to
revive someone whose heart has stopped beating, which usually
includes a machine to help breathing. Thinking of your current
condition, what would you want your doctors to do if your heart ever
stops beating? Would you want your doctors to try to revive you, or
would you want your doctors not to try to revive you?" Only patients
who explicitly and unequivocally answered negatively were classi-
fied as not wanting resuscitation because, in practice, patients with
an equivocal response would be resuscitated. The test-retest reliabil-
ity (exact agreement) of this measure in the SUPPORT study,
assessed within 24 hours of the initial interview for a subsample of
patients, was 93%.10
Physician Interview
The physician chiefly responsible for each study patient was inter-
viewed. The interviews collected information about physician char-
acteristics, perceptions of their patient's preferences, and perceptions
of their patient's prognosis and quality of life. Physicians were
asked, "What do you think the patient would want you to do if he or
she had a cardiopulmonary arrest?"
Statistical Analysis
In bivariable analyses, Student's t test was used to compare contin-
uous, normally distributed variables, and nonparametric tests were
used to compare variables that were not normally distributed. In the
multivariable analysis, 2 stepwise multiple logistic regression mod-
els were developed. Variables were retained in the model if the
regression coefficient was significantly associated at the 0.10 on
the basis of the Wald test. Each model was adjusted for study site by
including indicator variables.
The first model predicted patient preferences not to be resusci-
tated. The following variables were considered in the construction of
the model: age (years); sex; race; acute physiology score on hospital
day 3; whether the patient lived alone before admission; activities of
daily living dependencies based on patient status 2 weeks before
admission; modified Duke Activity Status Index based on patient
status 2 weeks before admission; number of comorbidities; the
patient's estimate of living for 2 more months; the patient's estimate
of living independently in 2 months; the patient's assessment of his
or her quality of life; and whether the patient reported that he or she
was a transplantation candidate. The model was adjusted for study
site and the patient's estimated probability of surviving 2 months on
the basis of the SUPPORT prognostic model.6 We repeated the
procedure after excluding patients who responded that they did not
know about their resuscitation preference.
The second model determined the factors most strongly associated
with a physician's perception that a patient did not want to be
resuscitated. There were 750 phase 1 and 2 patients who responded
to the resuscitation question and whose physicians were interviewed
and responded to the resuscitation question. To adjust for the
physician's preference if he or she were in the patient's situation, we

restricted the analysis to the 339 phase 1 patients with information on
their preferences and the matched physician perception questions
because that question was asked at a later time in phase 2.
The same method of model construction was used as above except
that the following additional variables were considered: the physi-
cian's resuscitation preference if he or she were in the patient's
condition; the physician's perception of the patient's quality of life
(excellent, very good, good, fair, or poor); whether the physician was
a cardiologist; the physician's age; the physician's sex; the physi-
cian's year of graduation from medical school; whether the physician
planned to care for the patient after hospital discharge; the length of
time that the physician had known the patient (1 week versus 1
week); the physician's perception of the likelihood that the patient
would live 2 months (0% to 100%); and the physician's perception
of the patient's belief about his or her quality of life (excellent, very
good, good, fair, or poor). We repeated the procedure after excluding
the variable describing what the physician would do if he or she were
in the patient's position.
The agreement between patients' own reports of and the physi-
cians' estimates of these resuscitation preferences, prognoses, and
quality of life was evaluated by use of the kappa coefficient.9 A
kappa coefficient 0.40 represents a moderate or greater degree of
agreement beyond that expected by chance.11 The associations of
patient and physician characteristics with agreement between the
patient and the physician were tested with 2 tests.
For all analyses, when information on income or level of educa-
tion was not available, we imputed values using previously described
methods.12 When information on functional status and activity status
was not available from the patients, we used calibrated surrogates'
reports of the patients' functional and activity status. When infor-
mation was not available from patients or their surrogates, we
imputed values.12
Results
Study Sample
Phases 1 and 2 of SUPPORT enrolled 9105 subjects (4301
patients were enrolled in phase 1 and 4804 in phase 2),
including 1404 patients with an exacerbation of chronic
congestive heart failure. The study sample consisted of 936
patients with congestive heart failure who participated in the
study interview and responded to the question about resusci-
tation. The interviewed patients were younger, were less ill,
and had a lower in-hospital mortality than patients who did
not participate in the interview, but they were not different
with respect to sex, history of myocardial infarction, number
of comorbid conditions, or ejection fraction.
Patient Resuscitation Preferences
Among the study sample, 215 (23%) of 936 patients did not
wish to be resuscitated in the case of a cardiac arrest, 646
(69%) definitely did want to be resuscitated, and 75 (8%)
were unsure whether they wanted a full resuscitation effort.
Factors associated with resuscitation preference are summa-
rized in Table 1.
In a multivariable model (Table 2), a strong predictor of the
patient's preference not to be resuscitated was the patient's
perception of a worse prognosis (expressed as likelihood of
living 2 months). Other factors that were significantly asso-
ciated with not wanting to be resuscitated included worse
activity status in the 2 weeks before admission, higher
income, and older age. The model did not change substan-
tially if patients who expressed uncertainty about their resus-
citation preferences were excluded.
Of the 936 patients in the sample, 600 also responded to the
resuscitation questions at 2 months after discharge. Overall,
19% did not have a stable preference, including 14% of the
patients (69 of 480) who initially expressed a preference for
resuscitation and 40% (48 of 120) who did not.
Physician Perceptions of Patient Preferences
Of the 936 patients in our study sample, 475 were in phase 1
of SUPPORT. Of these, 339 patients had matching physician
interviews with complete data collection for the analysis,
which were conducted between days 3 and 6 (see "Meth-
ods"). In 62 (18%) of the interviews, physicians believed that
their patients did not want to be resuscitated.
In the multivariable analysis, the strongest independent
correlate of the physician's perception that the patient did not
want to be resuscitated was the physician's resuscitation
preference if he or she were in the patient's condition.
Physicians who would not want to be resuscitated if in the
patient's condition commonly thought that the patient would
not want to be resuscitated (OR, 14.7; 95% CI, 4.2 to 51.9).
Other factors that were associated with the physician's
perception that the patient did not want to be resuscitated
included older patient age (adjusted OR for each year, 1.08;
95% CI, 1.04 to 1.13); the physician's perception of the
patient's view of his or her quality of life as fair or poor
compared with excellent, very good, or good (adjusted OR,
3.65; 95% CI, 1.48 to 9.02); physician's prognostic estimate
of a worse chance for survival at 2 months (adjusted OR for
each percent decrease in predicted 2-month chance of sur-
vival, 1.02; 95% CI, 1.00 to 1.04); and the patient's expressed
preference (to the interviewer) that he or she did not want to
be resuscitated (adjusted OR, 3.25; 95% CI, 1.50 to 7.04).
Dropping the variable describing the physician's preference if
he or she were in the patient's position from the model did not
substantially affect the association of the other independent
variables with the patient's preference.
Patient and Physician Agreement
Only 25% of the patients (236 of 936) with heart failure who
responded to the resuscitation question reported having told
their physician about their resuscitation preferences. Of the
936 patients in the study sample, 750 had a matching
physician interview. The mean time between the patient and
physician interviews was 0.1 days (interquartile range, 1 to
1 day).
Physicians did not correctly perceive their patient's resus-
citation preference in 24% of the cases (177 of 750; kap-
pa0.26). The discordance between patients and physicians
was in both directions, but it was more likely to occur when
the patient did not want to be resuscitated: in 69 (9%) of the
cases, physicians thought patients did not want resuscitation
when the patients did want it (or did not know), and in 108
(14%) of the cases, physicians thought patients wanted
resuscitation when the patients did not want it (McNemar
statistic8.59, P0.003). Discordance between the patient's
resuscitation preference and the physician's perceptions of
the preference was strongly associated with the patient's age
(Table 3). The frequency of disagreement between patients
and their physicians increased from 17% among patients 40

to 64 years of age to 29% among patients 75 years
(P0.001). Cardiologists were significantly more likely than
noncardiologists to agree with the patient's preference
(P0.001). Physicians were not more likely to understand
patients' preferences when patients reported discussing their
preferences with their physicians. Of the 392 patients with a
stable resuscitation preference over 2 months and a matched
physician interview (92 did not have a physician interview),
the physician's perception of the patient's preference dis-
agreed with the patient's actual preference in 16% of the
cases compared with 42% for those whose preference
changed over time.
DNR Order
Of the entire study sample of 1404 patients with an exacer-
bation of congestive heart failure, 241 (17%) had a DNR
order written in the hospital chart before discharge. The
median time between study admission and the DNR order
among those who had a DNR order written after study
admission was 2 days (range, 0 to 88 days). Of the 936
patients who answered the resuscitation question, 86 (9%)
had a DNR order by study day 6 and 111 (12%) by hospital
discharge. Of the 215 patients who expressed a preference not
to be resuscitated, 52 (24%) had a DNR order by study day 6
and 57 (27%) by hospital discharge. Of the 721 patients who
stated that they would want to be resuscitated or were unsure,
34 (5%) had a DNR order by study day 6 and 54 (7%) by
hospital discharge.
Resuscitation Preferences and Cardiac Arrest
Of the 936 patients in our study sample, 42 had cardiac arrest
after their day 3 interview. The median time to the cardiac
arrest was 4 days. Of these 42 patients, 31 had expressed a
preference for resuscitation and 19 had resuscitation attempts.
The 12 patients who were not resuscitated had a DNR order
written before the cardiac arrest. Of the 19 for whom

resuscitation had been attempted, 10 were discharged alive;
the others died in the hospital. Among the 42 patients with
cardiac arrest, 11 had stated that they did not want to be
resuscitated. Of the 11 patients who stated that they did not
want to be resuscitated, 5 had DNR orders written and were
not resuscitated. The remaining 6 patients had resuscitation
attempted, and 1 patient survived to hospital discharge.
Discussion
This prospective study of resuscitation preferences in patients
who were admitted with an exacerbation of severe heart
failure reveals the marked complexity of this issue. About one
quarter of the patients who were interviewed expressed a
preference not to be resuscitated in the event of a cardiac
arrest. This preference was expressed to an impartial inter-
viewer between 3 and 6 days after being enrolled in the study.
Several predictors of this preference were identified in a
multivariable analysis, including study site, older age, more
limited functional status, a lower estimate of prognosis by the
patient, and higher income.
Most of the time, physicians correctly predicted the pa-
tient's resuscitation preference. Nevertheless, for about 1 in 4
patients, physicians did not have an accurate perception of the
patient's resuscitation preference. However, physicians were
much more likely to have an accurate perception of the
resuscitation preferences of patients who subsequently did
not change their minds. Among patients with stable prefer-
ences, physicians did not accurately perceive the preference
in only 1 of every 6 patients. Lack of communication between
patients and their physicians may have been expected to
contribute to the disagreement. Despite the fact that these
patients were very ill and their physicians expected many of
them to die within the next 2 months, we found that only
about one quarter of the patients and physicians reported that
they had discussed resuscitation issues. This lack of commu-
nication has been observed in other settings,13,14 despite
evidence that patients want to have these discussions.15
However, we found that the physician's perception of the
patient's preference was not more likely to be accurate among
those who reported communicating with the physician. More-
over, the SUPPORT intervention, designed to improve com-
munication about these issues between patients and physi-
cians, failed to change practice.
Despite the complexity of this issue, our study did reveal
some interesting findings. Except for patient age, the correlates
of the physician's belief that the patient did not want to be
resuscitated differed from those predictors of patients' prefer-
ences. The most important predictor of the physician's belief that
the patient did not want to be resuscitated was the physician's
own preference not to be resuscitated if he or she were in the
patient's condition. The patient's preference not to be resusci-
tated was also a significant predictor, as was the physician's
perception of the patient's prognosis and quality of life.
Although the age of the patient was an important factor
associated with both the patients' preferences for resuscita-
tion and the physicians' beliefs about the patients' resuscita-
tion preferences, the physicians may have placed greater
emphasis on age than the patients did. The age of the patient
was strongly related to the likelihood of discordance between
patients and physicians. Older age was associated with a
higher likelihood that physicians would incorrectly perceive
the patient's resuscitation preference.
The physician's perception of the patient's quality of life was
associated with his or her belief about the patient's preference.
However, the patients' assessments of their own quality of life
(with a single-item question) were not related to their own
resuscitation preferences. Other studies have also found that the
patient's quality of life has not been related to resuscitation
preferences. Among patients who had experienced medical
intensive care, Patrick and colleagues16 found no significant
association between the willingness of patients to undergo
intensive care and their quality of life as measured by the
Perceived Quality of Life Scale. In another study among outpa-
tients, Uhlmann and Pearlman17 found that neither global quality
of life nor selected dimensions of quality of life, including
aspects of social, physical, emotional, and intellectual function-
ing, were associated with resuscitation preferences.
These studies of quality of life and resuscitation preferences
suggest either that the instruments that measure quality of life are
not sensitive to factors that influence decisions about resuscita-
tion or that patients consider other factors when making this
decision. Zweibel18 has suggested that patients do not consider
abstract concepts such as current quality of life when making
decisions about life-sustaining therapy but rather focus on
concrete factors such as the presence and level of chronic pain,
their immediate prognosis, and their likelihood of self-care. This
observation regarding prognosis appears to be true of patients
with severe congestive heart failure.
Physician characteristics were generally not associated
with the degree of agreement with patient preferences. In

particular, agreement was not significantly associated with
age, sex, year of graduation from medical school, or whether
the physician knew the patient for 1 week. Interestingly, the
characteristic that was significantly associated with agree-
ment was specialty, with cardiologists performing better than
the other physicians.
Our overall findings are very consistent with findings from
the overall SUPPORT population. In the study by Phillips and
colleagues,10 28% of the SUPPORT population was reported
not to want to be resuscitated. In their multivariable analysis,
patients with congestive heart failure were more likely to
want to be resuscitated. In the overall sample, as in our group,

study site, age, functional status, and perception of prognosis
were strong predictors of resuscitation preferences.
Although the patient's estimated prognosis by the
SUPPORT prognostic model and the physician emerged as
important factors in predicting resuscitation preferences, it is
important to note that heart failure may be inherently more
unpredictable in its short-term prognosis than many other
conditions such as lung cancer. Lynn and colleagues19,20 have
shown that estimates of prognosis for critically ill patients
may not accurately predict which patients with heart failure
will die soon. Many patients with heart failure may die of a
fatal arrhythmia at a time when they are clinically stable.
Consequently, patients and physicians, acknowledging the
risk of sudden and unexpected death in this condition, may
need to discuss issues about death and treatment at a time that
may not be perceived as close to the time of death. If
physicians and patients wait until the short-term prognosis
becomes so grave that death is imminent, they may never
have the opportunity to discuss these issues.
An important finding of this study is the lack of stability of
the resuscitation preferences for many patients who initially
did not want to be resuscitated. Our findings are consistent
with a recent report that found that 80% of the overall
SUPPORT cohort had stable resuscitation preferences over 2
months.21 The lack of stability may reflect initial uncertainty
about the preference, inaccurate classification by the initial
assessment, or a change in perspective or circumstance that
led patients to reconsider their initial preferences. Whatever
the cause, physicians were more likely to report accurately
the preferences of the patients who did not change their
minds. This observation adds complexity to the study of
physician perceptions of patient preference. It is not clear that
physician discordance with patients who change their minds
should be considered a problem.
Study Limitations
This study has several important limitations. Any study of
resuscitation preferences is inherently difficult. The patients in
this study were interviewed by individuals who had no relation-
ship with them and were not involved in their care. There may
be concerns that patients responded differently to the interview-
ers than they did with their physicians. In addition, the question
used to assess resuscitation preferences may not reflect many of
the nuances of this issue. Many physicians may have difficulty
with the question because they consider many levels of resusci-
tation to exist. Also, physicians may consider the issue of
resuscitation differently, depending on the circumstance in
which the cardiac arrest occurs.
In addition, although the interviews of the patients and
physicians were close in time, they were not simultaneous. It is
possible that preferences changed after the patient interview and
before the physician interview. This change may have caused
some physicians to appear not to know the preference of their
patient and overestimated the discordance. For the identification
of factors associated with this discordance, however, this mis-
classification would have been expected to add noise, not bias.
It is also possible that the process of conducting this study
may have altered behaviors. Patients who consented to be
interviewed about their resuscitation preferences should have
been motivated to discuss these issues with their physicians
and may have done so before the physician interview. This
effect may have increased the communication and agreement
between patients and their physicians. Other limitations of the
study include the possible misinterpretation of the questions
by ill patients and the possible lack of generalizability of our
findings to patients in other medical centers.
