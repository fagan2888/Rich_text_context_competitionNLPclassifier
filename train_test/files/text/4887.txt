Introduction
Pancreatic cystic lesions (PCLs) have been more
frequently diagnosed than before because of
increased health screening and the development
of imaging technology.1,2 PCLs comprise a het-
erogeneous group of diseases, including cystic
degeneration of solid tumors, benign cystic lesions
such as serous cystic neoplasms (SCN), pseudo-
cysts and premalignant lesions such as mucinous
cystic neoplasm (MCN), intraductal papillary
mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) and solid pseudo-
papillary tumor.3 Although accurate diagnosis is
very important for proper management, the diag-
nostic accuracy with computed tomography or
magnetic resonance imaging is only 60­70%, and
with cystic fluid analysis through an endoscopic
ultrasound it is only about 80%.4­7

Abstract
Background: Endoscopic ultrasound-guided ethanol ablation (EUS-EA) is a recently
introduced treatment for pancreatic cystic lesions (PCLs). However, clinical benefits such as
survival gain and maintenance of quality of life (QOL) have not been fully established. The aim
of this study was to evaluate the clinical benefits of EUS-EA compared with the natural course
(NC) of PCLs.
Methods: This retrospective comparative study of patients with PCLs investigated an EUS-EA
group (n = 118) and an NC group (n = 428). Propensity score matching (PSM) analysis was
applied to minimize the effects of selection bias. The overall survival as the primary outcome
and the surgical resection rate and complete remission (CR) rate as the secondary outcomes
were evaluated.
Results: Between 84 matched pairs of both groups, there were no significant differences in
the baseline clinical characteristics and the mean follow-up duration (78.88 ± 38.86, 75.90
± 57.46 months, p = 0.694). Overall survival did not differ significantly (194.12 ± 5.60, 247.54
± 12.70 months, p = 0.235). The surgical resection rate (4.8% versus 26.2%, p < 0.001) was
significantly lower in the EUS-EA group. CR was observed only in the EUS-EA group and the
CR rate was 32.1%.
Conclusions: EUS-EA for PCLs with low risk of malignancy might not be able to obtain a survival
benefit, but showed maintenance of QOL by avoidance of unnecessary surgery, and a certain
level of CR when compared to the NC. EUS-EA could be considered a useful treatment option for
these, but careful application is needed because of the limited effects in some types of PCLs.

Although there is no complete consensus among
experts, surgery is necessary if the possibility of
malignancy is high. Recently, endosonography-
guided ethanol ablation (EUS-EA) has been
attempted as a nonsurgical treatment for PCLs
with low risk of malignancy ­ namely, no high-
risk stigmata, no definitive mural nodule or main
duct feature on endoscopic ultrasound.8
Feasibility and efficacy of EUS-EA have been
confirmed through several studies.9­12 The com-
plete remission (CR) rate of PCLs through
EUS-EA is reportedly 34.3­45.1%,9,11­13 and the
CR rate using ethanol and paclitaxel is reportedly
47.6­78.6% without severe complications.14­16
The long-term follow-up results suggest that the
treatment effect is also well maintained.9,14
However, there are still some limitations in previ-
ous studies that must be overcome to ensure the
validity and utility of EUS-EA for PCLs with low
risk of malignancy. First, it is difficult to deter-
mine what clinical benefits they would have in
practice because patients received EUS-EA for a
number of PCLs with indolent courses such as
SCN or pseudocyst.9 Second, the definite thera-
peutic effects of EUS-EA were proven,11 but it is
difficult to confirm the clinical benefits of
EUS-EA compared to a surveillance strategy. It is
necessary to determine whether the clinical out-
comes actually improve the survival gain through
the prevention of malignancy, maintenance of
quality of life (QOL) through avoidance of unnec-
essary surgery and achievement of true CR.
In this study, we evaluated the clinical benefits of
EUS-EA therapy for PCLs with a low risk of
malignancy, and compared these with those of
the natural course (NC) of PCLs using a surveil-
lance strategy.
Method
Study design and patients
This retrospective study investigated patients who
visited Seoul National University Hospital with
PCLs diagnosed through image modalities.
Patients' data, including age, sex, Adult
Comorbidity Evaluation-27,17 initial and last size of
PCLs, characteristics of PCLs and surgical reports
were collected from a retrospective chart review.
Patients were divided into two groups, an NC
group that did not undergo surgery for initial
treatment and an EUS-EA group that received
ethanol ablation therapy. In the NC group,
patients who were diagnosed with PCLs from
January 1993 to August 2015 were reviewed. In
the EUS-EA group, the procedure was performed
from June 2006 to June 2015 and the indications
of the EUS-EA were as follows: (1) clinically non-
pseudocyst PCLs; (2) cystic size was 2­5 cm
without communication with the main pancreatic
duct. The exclusion criteria were as follows: (1)
<1 year follow up; (2) <20 years old; (3) sympto-
matic PCLs; (4) planned surgery at the time of
diagnosis; (5) PCLs associated with genetic dis-
ease; (6) clinically suspicious pseudocysts; (7)
PCLs with high-risk stigmata (obstructive jaun-
dice, enhanced solid component, or main pancre-
atic duct more than 10 mm);8 (8) main duct type
or mixed type IPMN; (9) cystic degeneration of
solid tumors.
This study was approved by the institutional
review board (IRB) of the Seoul National
University Hospital, Korea (IRB No. H-1606-
049-770). The need for informed consent was
waived by the IRB.
Procedure steps of EUS-EA
EUS-EA is simultaneously performed with cystic
fluid aspiration for PCLs because a split
approach has two limitations: (1) two invasive
procedures can increase the economic burden
and risk of complications; (2) the required wait-
ing period for the procedure because of reduc-
tion of cystic size after diagnostic cystic fluid
aspiration.
The study patients received EUS-EA from three
gastroenterologists who were experts in interven-
tional EUS. Radial-scanning echoendoscope
(GF-UM2000, GF-UE260; Olympus Optical
Co., Tokyo, Japan) and curvilinear-array echoen-
doscope (GF-UCT2000, GF-UCT 240,
GF-UCT 260; Olympus Optical Co., Tokyo,
Japan) with a 7.5 MHz transducer (EU-M 2000
­ Olympus Optical Co., Tokyo, Japan; Aloka
Alpha 5 and 10 ­ Hitachi Aloka Medical, Ltd.,
Tokyo, Japan) were used, and the following
parameters were evaluated for PCLs: location,
size, locularity, septum, and mural nodules.
EUS-EA was conducted through transgastric or
transduodenal puncture of the cysts using a curvi-
linear-array echoendoscope with a 19- or 22-gauge
needle (EchoTip Ultra ­ Cook Endoscopy,
JH Choi, SH Lee et al.
journals.sagepub.com/home/tag 3
Winston-Salem, NC; EZ Shot 2 or 3TM ­ Olympus
Medical, Tokyo, Japan; ExpectTM ­ Boston
Scientific, MA, USA). EUS-EA for PCLs was
accomplished using the following protocol: (1)
the longest diameter was measured; (2) 80% of
the cystic fluid was aspirated, after which 99%
ethanol was injected and stored in the cyst for 3­5
min; (3) step number 2 was repeated twice; (4) all
injected ethanol and remnant cystic fluid was
aspirated.
Categorization of PCLs by cystic fluid analysis
The characteristics of PCLs in the EUS-EA group
were evaluated by location, size, and measure-
ment of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and
amylase level from the aspirated cystic fluid. The
PCLs of the EUS-EA group were categorized
based on analysis of cystic fluid: SCN (CEA <5
ng/mL, amylase <800 U/L), pseudocyst (CEA
<5 ng/mL, amylase 800 U/L), IPMN (CEA
200 ng/mL, amylase 800 U/L), and MCN
(CEA 200 ng/mL, amylase <800 U/L). The
PCLs that did not meet these criteria (5 ng/mL 
CEA < 200 ng/mL) were categorized as indeter-
minate cysts.
Study outcome and definition of events
All outcomes were evaluated with propensity
score matching (PSM) data. The primary out-
come of the study was comparison of overall sur-
vival (OS) in both groups. The secondary
outcomes were the rate of surgery in both groups,
and the CR rate in the EUS-EA group.
The survival status was updated in June 2017.
Data from living patients were considered cen-
sored for survival analysis. CR was defined as no
visible PCLs on repeated imaging studies per-
formed during the follow-up period. The follow-
up period was calculated from the time of the
diagnosis to the death or most recent outpatient
visit.
Statistical analysis
We conducted PSM analysis between the
EUS-EA and the NC groups to construct a rand-
omized experiment-like situation and minimize
selection bias. A logistic regression model was
conducted to calculate the propensity score of the
following covariates: age, sex, follow-up duration,
initial cystic size, and number of initial worrisome
features except size. Based on the propensity
score, 1:1 matching was performed between the
EUS-EA group and the NC group. For matching,
nearest neighbor matching with a caliper width of
0.05 SD was employed.18 The overall balance test
showed that the structure of the two groups was
similar and the matching was successful (p = 0.983).
The L1 of the multivariate imbalance measure on
the matching equilibrium was 0.912 before
matching and 0.738 after matching. There were
no unbalanced covariates with an absolute value
>0.25 in the standardized mean difference.
Survival was analyzed using the Kaplan­Meier
method and log-rank test. Continuous variables
were analyzed by the Student's t test and cate-
gorical variables were analyzed using the Chi-
squared test or Fisher's exact test. p values
<0.05 were considered significant. Statistical
analyses were performed using SPSS v.23.0
(IBM Corp, Armonk, NY, USA). PSM for
SPSS (version 1.0), which was programmed by
Felix Thoemmes (Cornell University), was used
with the underlying R packages (MatchIt,
Rltools, cem).19
Result
Baseline clinical characteristics
A total of 649 patients were classified as patients
in the NC group, while 51 patients with follow-up
duration <1 year, 83 patients with only one
image, and 56 patients with insufficient medical
records were excluded. Finally, 428 patients were
included in the NC group, with exclusion of other
disease by additional evaluations such as acces-
sory spleen, metastatic cancer, neuroendocrine
tumor (NET) and main duct or mixed type
IPMN. There were 139 patients who underwent
EUS-EA, but 21 patients who were followed up
<1 year were excluded (Figure 1).
The baseline characteristics of study patients
before and after matching are shown in Table 1.
There were several significant differences
observed before matching in several factors, but
after matching there were no significant differ-
ences in the age (57.43 ± 12.69, 58.24 ± 12.80
years, p = 0.681), severity of comorbidity (p = 0.153),
initial cystic size (23.13 ± 11.11, 22.97 ± 12.00
mm, p = 0.927), number of worrisome features
(p = 0.336) or mean follow-up duration (78.88 ±
38.86, 75.90 ± 57.46 months, p = 0.694). Three

patients in the EUS-EA group and 12 patients in
the NC group died. Seven patients died from
non-pancreatic causes; for the others cause of
death could not be identified.
Evaluation of clinical outcomes
The measured OS was 194.12 ± 5.60 months in
the EUS-EA group (95% CI 183.14­205.09) and
247.54 ± 12.704 months (95% CI 222.65­
272.44) in the NC group by the Kaplan­Meier
analysis, with no significant difference in the log-
rank test (p = 0.235) (Figure 2). The rate of sur-
gery was significantly lower in the EUS-EA group
than the NC group (4.8% versus 26.2%, p <
0.001). The CR rate was 32.1% (27 of 84) and
CR was confirmed only in the EUS-EA group
(Table 2). There were no severe adverse events
by EUS-EA and all minor adverse events were
improved with conservative management.
Review of the patients who underwent surgery
In the NC group, 22 patients (26.2%) underwent
surgery and the pathologic diagnoses were as fol-
lows: 5 SCN, 3 MCN, 13 IPMN, and 1 pancreatic
ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Among muci-
nous cysts, 62.5% showed low-grade dysplasia or
benign, 31.3% showed moderate-grade dysplasia
or borderline malignancy, and 6.3% was malig-
nancy. Of the two cysts diagnosed as malignant
lesions, PDAC was stage IIA (pT3N0) and intra-
ductal papillary mucinous carcinoma was stage 0
(pTis). The duration from diagnosis to surgery
was 32.98 ± 28.17 (4.9­114.47) months. There
was no mortality case, but postoperative morbidi-
ties were confirmed in nine patients, including four
patients with chronic abdominal discomfort or
digestive problems, three patients with postopera-
tive infection, two patients with postoperative
onset diabetes mellitus, and one patient with post-
operative pancreatic juice leakage.

In the EUS-EA group, four patients (4.8%) under-
went surgery and the pathological diagnoses were
as follows: 1 SCN, 2 MCN (low and intermediate
dysplasia) and 1 IPMN with moderate dysplasia.
There were no reports describing the ablative effect
of EUS-EA in pathologic findings. Two patients
were described as having a specific finding, with
degeneration with foamy histiocytic infiltration in
one, and grayish fibrosis around pericystic paren-
chyme in the other. There was no recurrence after
surgery during the study period (Table 3). In addi-
tion, there were no difficult operations due to the
severe fibrosis or adhesion and no evidence of dis-
semination related to EUS-EA. The duration from
diagnosistosurgerywas57.5±39.27(17.97­96.97)
months and the duration from EUS-EA to surgery
was 20.33 ± 17.61 (6.17­42.93). Among patients
who underwent surgery, postoperative chronic
dyspepsia was confirmed in three patients. Surgery
was performed for various reasons, including con-
stantly or rapidly growing cysts, newly developed
risky features, patient concern and planned simul-
taneous laparotomy for another tumor. A patient
who underwent EUS-EA for SCN was found to
have liver metastases during follow up and the
results of liver biopsy revealed they were metastatic
lesions of the NET. Surgery was performed and
SCN with traces of EUS-EA adjacent to 1.1 cm of
NET (grade 3, pT3N0) without cystic change
were identified.
Treatment response of EUS-guided ethanol
ablation for PCLs
Treatment responses of the EUS-EA group
before matching (n = 118) are shown in Figure
3. No patient underwent more than one EUS-EA
for the same lesion. The ratio of the last and
initial size was calculated to evaluate the treat-
ment response. The CR rate of each PCLs was
13.3% for MCN, 37.5% for SCN, 20.0% for
pseudocyst, 10.0% for IPMN and 33.3% for
indeterminate cysts. The ratio of over half size
reduction was 40.0% for MCN, 57.5% for
SCN, 46.7% for pseudocysts, 20.0% for IPMN
and 51.3% for indeterminate cysts. There were
only three cysts more than twice as large as the
initial size after EUS-EA. Seven patients under-
went surgery who had been treated with
EUS-EA. One patient underwent EUS-EA and
was followed up for sustained cyst. Because the
size of the cyst slowly increased and a mural
nodule was observed, the patient underwent
pylorus preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy at
88.6 months after EUS-EA and IPMN-
associated invasive carcinoma (pT1N0M0) was
diagnosed. All other patients were found to have
no malignant portion.
The comparison data for the two groups after
PSM for the change in size are as follows: the size
reduction differed significantly between groups [p
< 0.001, 67.9% (57 of 84) in EUS-EA group,
15.5% (13 of 84) in NC group]. However, size
growth showed no significant difference (p =
0.264): 6.0% (5 of 84) in the EUS-EA group,
while it was 10.7% (9 of 84) in the NC group.
Discussion
Surgery for PCLs is the only curative and the most
important treatment, but it can lead to a deterio-
ration in QOL. Some patients underwent unnec-
essary surgery because of the ambiguity of exact
surgical indications. As understanding of the NC
and malignant potential of PCLs develops, the
management has gradually become more conserv-
ative.8,20,21 Several studies of feasibility and safety
of EUS-EA have been conducted and have shown
a certain amount of CR (Table 4). However, there
has been no comparative analysis of how EUS-EA
affects clinical benefits such as survival gain and
maintenance of QOL. This study showed that
EUS-EA might not be able to provide survival
gain, but it is able to provide clinical benefits
including maintenance of QOL by avoidance of
unnecessary surgery and a certain level of CR for
PCLs with low risk of malignancy.
Treatment of PCLs with EUS-EA did not signifi-
cantly improve survival compared with the NC
group in this study. Survival in these patients
seems to be determined by the severity of the
accompanying comorbidities, because patients
whose cause of death could be identified were
found to have died because of worsened underly-
ing disease or newly developed fatal disease.
Moderate to severe levels of comorbidity were
found in 40% of the mortality cases, which was
significantly higher than that of the whole patients.
These results are in line with those of previous
studies that showed most of the PCLs without
any risk factors were unlikely to cause mortality or
morbidity because of their benign disease course
and slow-growing features.1,23­25 PCLs with no
suspicious features had a lower risk of pancreatic
malignancy in recent studies than in previous
studies based on surgical series. The similar level

of surgical mortality and malignancy detection
rate in the surveillance group has significant
implications.1,23 Therefore, it is very important to
consider the patient's QOL when treating PCLs.
The QOL of patients with PCLs may have been
determined by morbidity caused by surgery,
psychological anxiety for malignancy, and medi-
cal economic burden. The long-term adverse
events associated with postoperative morbidity
were significantly less in the EUS-EA group
than in the NC group. We estimated the average
economic burden, including the procedure or
surgery fee, hospitalization fee, and surveillance
fee per patient, of the EUS-EA group to be
$3146 (USD) and that of the NC group to be
$4005 for the follow-up period of 7 years after
diagnosis based on the Korean medical price
and our medical policy (p = 0.102). Therefore,
management of PCLs including EUS-EA seems
to reduce the medical economic burden while
also reducing the possibility of the patient suf-
fering from morbidity due to surgery. We believe
that EUS-EA can be considered a minimally
invasive treatment option in the management of
PCLs with low risk of malignancy and clearly be
helpful to the patient by preventing deteriora-
tion of QOL by reducing unnecessary surgery.
Despite expected advantages with guaranteed
feasibility and safety of EUS-EA, some experts
have a negative view of the real long-term efficacy
of EUS-EA because of the low CR ratio in muci-
nous neoplasm.22 Moreover, controversies exist
regarding the potential for missing proper surgery
for premalignant lesions.26,27 The PSM compara-
tive analysis in this study produced the following
meaningful findings. First, it seems possible to
manage PCLs without unnecessary surgery by
providing additional treatment options (4.8%
versus 26.2%, p < 0.001). In fact, 22.7% of SCN
and 36.4% of mucinous cysts with low-grade dys-
plasia did not require surgery according to the
surgical pathology of the NC group. In our opin-
ion, unnecessary surgery was more likely to be
performed in the NC group because there are
only two options in the treatment of PCLs: sur-
gery or surveillance. Second, the results of surgi-
cal pathology suggest that the treatment strategy
with EUS-EA showed no tendency to miss the
appropriate treatment opportunity for malignant
transformed PCLs. It seems possible to opt for

surgery in cases that the cystic size continues to
grow or high-risk features emerge after EUS-EA.
Third, a certain level of CR can be expected from
appropriate indicated PCLs. Patients with PCLs
reaching CR may be able to increase the interval
of examination and relieve the psychological pres-
sure regarding malignant transformation.
However, it is difficult to use EUS-EA as an alter-
native treatment for surgery for three reasons.
First, the effects on some types of PCLs has been
shown to be low based on data from this and pre-
vious studies. The results of defining the CR
using the volume criteria show that the success
rate is high, but the actual volume decreased to
<5%, indicating that about one-third of the
length was sustained. Therefore, follow up is not
terminated even for PCLs with CR based on vol-
ume criteria after EUS-EA. Second, it has not
been confirmed that EUS-EA can actually pre-
vent malignant transformation. DeWitt and col-
leagues reported in molecular-level studies that
EUS-guided ablation with ethanol and paclitaxel
may eliminate mutant DNA in PCLs,15 but fur-
ther molecular-level and pathologic data are
needed to reach a conclusion. Third, EUS-EA
will proceed with uncertain diagnosis at the time
of the procedure. Depending on the presumed
diagnosis, which is confirmed afterwards by cystic
fluid analysis, it is possible to predict the response
after EUS-EA and the decision about the neces-
sity for surgery or close follow up. If a center is
available with confocal laser endomicroscopy,
this will provide more accurate information about
the diagnosis and help to determine whether or
not to perform the procedure.28,29 Considering
these aspects, it is more reasonable for EUS-EA
to act as an affordable and feasible treatment
option with its own indications rather than as an
alternative to surgery.
This study has several limitations. First, there are
definite limitations to application of the data for
a comparative study because this was a retrospec-
tive observational study. However, PSM was per-
formed to minimize differences in baseline
clinical and lesion characteristics between study
groups. Second, the results in this study are
based on the presumed diagnosis of PCLs by
imaging studies or cystic fluid analysis. It is
important to note that decision-making should
be made under uncertain situations in real
practice. Third, the evaluation of the EUS-EA
response was conducted by comparing the
size of the first and the last image. We did not
analyze whether the size increased after decline,

recurrence after CR, or growth rate. Fourth,
QOL was not quantitatively assessed, and the
exact causal relationship between QOL and post-
operative morbidity of the patients who under-
went surgery was not investigated in our study.
In order to compensate for this, we have also dis-
cussed the economic aspects of EUS-EA as
closely as possible to suggest that it has a positive
effect on the maintenance of QOL.
There are several strengths of this study. First, we
focused on the clinical implications of EUS-EA
rather than the success of the procedure itself,
unlike previous studies. Second, as far as we
know, this is the first comparative study of long-
term clinical benefits such as survival gain, avoid-
ance of surgery and CR in a large number of
patients. The prospective randomization compar-
isons of EUS-EA that could respond to CR and
surveillance without treatment seemed to be ethi-
cally unacceptable. Third, the outcomes are more
robust based on the PSM method than those
reflected in previous single-arm studies. Fourth,
CR criteria were strictly defined and analyzed
because of the slow-growing nature of PCLs and
limited ways to verify the absence of a viable por-
tion after EUS-EA.
In conclusion, EUS-EA might not be able to pro-
vide a survival benefit, but could be able to gener-
ate clinical benefits including maintenance of
QOL by avoidance of unnecessary surgery and a
certain level of CR in patients with PCLs with low
risk of malignancy. Based on the first comparison
data for treatment of PCLs, EUS-EA could be
considered a useful treatment option for PCLs
with lower risk of malignancy and a complemen-
tary treatment option for patients with high risk of
surgery, but careful application is needed because
of the limited effects when applied to some types
of PCLs.
