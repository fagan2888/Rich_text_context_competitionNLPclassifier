It is a matter of amusement that a person like Sri Aurobindo
who has substantially contributed to the understanding, con-
solidation, propagation, and furthering of Indian thought
should still be a marginal figure in academia. Sri Aurobin-
do's contribution to the many aspects of Indian Culture makes
him a cultural institution whose value must be cherished and
merits critical revaluations from time to time. This study is a
response to that perceived need. What really amuses one is
the fact that a person whose opinions on art, aesthetics,
poetry, and literature were frequently sought by disciples,
scholars, and aspiring writers in the 1930s and 1940s should
have to wait like the metaphysical poets. Perhaps, the Indian
academy's self-consciousness is to blame for this calculated
amnesia: perhaps, the academy did not want to be stigma-
tized as "metaphysical" or "other worldly"; a colonial taint
which it has been fiercely struggling to avoid. Perhaps, the
academy itself was reeling under a self-actualization com-
plex for which approval of the Western scholastic establish-
ment was absolutely necessary.
It is ironical that for one who was as well known, if not,
better known than the Indian novelists in English at the
time, the triune of the Indian English novel--Anand, Rao,
and Narayan--had to wait till the 1990s for official
recognition when V. S. Sethuraman edited Indian Aesthetics:
An Introduction (1992) which contains the essay, "The Soul
of Poetic Delight and Beauty." The irony of the situation is
the fact that Sri Aurobindo was, even more vigorously than
Raja Rao of Kanthapura and Serpent and the Rope, R. K.
Narayan of The English Teacher and The Guide, talking
about an ethos where more journeys are made inward, into
the spirit than outward toward a noisy reality that hems us in
on all sides. Perhaps, the time has come, though the oppor-
tunity was always there, to attempt inquiries into vital areas
of cultural import and identify concerns that can occupy us
which is more redeeming than the overanxious urge to ratio-
nalize our credentials as an ecumenical culture by dedicat-
ing academic careers to an understanding of Western
scholarly dispositions and accents.

Between Mental Manufacture and
PureTranscript: TheViability of
aTheory of Poetry in the Letters
of Sri Aurobindo
VinodValiathakidi Balakrishnan1
Abstract
Sri Aurobindo's multifaceted engagements will continue to occupy scholars in different fields. As one who belongs to a
country that has begotten eminent theoreticians in the fields of literature, arts, linguistics, and aesthetics, Sri Aurobindo's
contribution deserves a dispassionate assessment.Volume 27 of the Complete Works contains his "Letters on Poetry and
Art" which can be examined for the potential for a theory of poetry.As letters, they are informal responses. However, they
are also responses to specific and thoughtfully worded questions from individuals who have engaged SriAurobindo in serious
discussions on the issues concerning poetry and the arts.An Indian academic is forged in a system of education that is more
Western, in character, than Indian. Hence, the present concern to explore the potential for a theory of poetry among Indian
scholars and theoreticians.There is the large corpus of Indian aesthetic ideas and theories that have been ignored or relegated
to a position behind the Western ideas and theories. So much so, the average scholar shows a greater familiarity with Plato,
Aristotle, Coleridge, Arnold and is wanting in the knowledge of Anandavardana, Bharatrihari, or, even, Sri Aurobindo. The
present article examines the Letters inVolume 27 for the purpose of cataloguing the major concerns, themes, philosophical
categories that inform the discussions, and theoretical issues that such a project would generate.

The present project examines the viability of a theory of
poetry from the perusal of the Letters on Poetry and Art
which forms Volume 27 of the Complete Works. This vol-
ume incorporates material from three earlier collections
titled Letters on Poetry: Literature and Art, Letters on
"Savitri," and On Himself. In all, there are more than 500
letters, in which Sri Aurobindo has, now laconically, now
elaborately, dwelt on subjects relating to the arts, especially,
poetry. They range from poetic creation to sources of inspira-
tion to technique to artistry, rhythm, style, diction to form as
well as disciplinary concerns like Sadhana, reading, writing,
language, and yoga. There are also attempts at synthesis like
reading and Sadhana, writing and Sadhana, poetry and
Sadhana, and language study and yoga.
The Letters may be reckoned as a valuable source for con-
structing a theory of poetry which will be, if not unique, at
least a definite departure from the Western theoretical posi-
tions. Of course, the ideas about the aspects of poetry are not
as sustained, developed, and complete as they obtain in The
Future Poetry. Whereas the latter is more reflective and car-
ries the shape of personal introspection, the former is more
responsive to the concerns of fellow travelers in the Word
and in the World. So, there is an engagement, a dialogue, an
interaction between the well-considered question and the
appropriate response. There is also the possibility of keener
application to problems because at the time of replying to
each of his interlocutors, Sri Aurobindo was responding to a
given problem where all the other issues would be kept in
abeyance. Perhaps, even he was unaware of the multitude of
issues identified and attended while the beautiful conversa-
tion on poetry, with multiple interlocutors, was unfolding.
In this respect, the Letters may be seen to resemble Plato's
Republic or Sir Philip Sidney's An Apology for Poetry. Both
these seminal texts are responses to questions; the question
with the irresistible invitation to Socrates to dwell on the
power of poetry and the "other" question which is an indict-
ment of Poetry as a worthy occupation. Plato's concern is
more about the health of the city-state whereas Sidney's must
be reckoned as the health of the individual. Plato's indictment
of the poet and Sidney's defense of the poet imply concerns
which can be metaphorized as the State of Athens as an
Individual (in an anthropomorphic sense) and the state of the
individual (in the context of Renaissance humanism), respec-
tively. What we see is the juxtaposition of entities that are
founded on the principle of integrity if they have to exist at all;
the contrary is suggestive of disruption, disintegration, and the
Yeats-ian image of "things fall[ing] apart." Poetry is the form
of the symbolic integration of the state and the individual. The
fact that Volume 27 begins with the origin of poetry and moves
toward Sadhana and yoga suggests the crucial integration of
elements that are not, apparently, compatible.
The two key orientations of this study would be the refer-
ence to an Indian ethos as well as the integration that poetry
symbolizes. Both these orientations are informed by the
reading of the Letters. They help us understand better the kind
of poetry that Sri Aurobindo had conviction about, the poet
who would accomplish the rite of bringing the poem into
being, and the significance of yoga and Sadhana in this pro-
cess. What the orientations would further enable is an under-
standing of a scale of possibilities in language where at one
end is the predominance of the outer mind/consciousness that
results in a "mental manufacture" and at the other end is the
Overmind where pure inspiration performs a lila that culmi-
nates in a "Pure Transcript." Between these two points is an
expansive space with infinite levels of consciousness and
performance corresponding to the infinite possibility for
perfection that is present in man.
The ground that needs to be immediately cleared is that of
theory itself. We would be on firmer ground if we can decide
whether it is consistent with what a Jonathan Culler would
mean by "Theory." Culler (2000) would first admit that
theory is "a body of thinking and writing whose limits are
exceedingly hard to imagine" (p. 3). He illustrates the moves
of theory by showing how a Foucault or a Derrida theoreti-
cally explain and expose the actual complicity between sex
and power (though it appears that power is resisted by sex)
and how writing (much against the claim of Rousseau) is, by
Rousseau's own confession, not a supplement to speaking
but its superior other. Culler's position on theory, though
erudite and persuasive, appears to promise much on the side
of theory's possibility while, in an even measure, limits the
theoretical moves to an investigative and diagnostic approach
that serves to uncover, recover, revise, and rewrite an exist-
ing situation where the gap between the apparent and the
actual needs to be filled with informed skepticism.
One is not sure whether such a notion about theory would
help in constructing a theory of poetry using the Letters of Sri
Aurobindo. The reason for investing in an alternative position
is the fact that the Letters are not mere language constructs
that may satisfy a Derridean skepticism for the contradictions
ingrained in language. Nor are they manifestations of an intri-
cate and invisible web of forces that compel resistance from
above when they have actually orchestrated a complicity (that
resembles resistance). There is a definite transcendental realm
in the scheme of Sri Aurobindo, which the spirit of the Letters
embodies that renders a Derridean skepticism a move predis-
posed to challenge and subvert. There is also an engagement
with the self in more self-evaluating terms that is not satisfac-
torily answered by theories that believe in systems that control
and coerce individuals. So, a theory about poetry based on the
Letters of Sri Aurobindo locates the individual in a more sub-
stantial manner than that of the Derridean skeptic with respect
to what he or she can do as well as providing a more expansive
location for the individual where he or she is not coerced by
larger forces, symbolized by the state, that remind him or her
on what they cannot do.
The purposes of a theory would require a revaluation of
accepted alignments. The Western poetic theories are, with
respect to the Indian academy, aligned from Plato through
Aristotle to Horace to Longinus to Sidney to Dryden, to
Wordsworth, to Coleridge, to Arnold, to Eliot to Yeats to
Seamus Heaney. There are, of course, theAmerican poets like
Balakrishnan 3
Emerson, Whitman, Edgar Poe, and Robert Frost who have
discoursed on poetry. There is a transcendental region in
Plato's scheme which is brought down to earth through an
Aristotelian unseating of the Gods to privilege the conceit of
the poet. Since that crucial intervention which Philip Sidney
(1988) records as "Her world is brazen, the poets only deliv-
ers a golden" (p. 8), the poet has been recognized as a Maker,
a Prophet. Even, when Wordsworth strikes the notes of rebel-
lion by characterizing the poet as "man speaking to man," the
hagiography of the poet as "the maker" is unmistakable and
this strain is sustained through to Seamus Heaney (1980),
who narrates the midwifery of the poet in the making of
Omphalos, which is the Greek word meaning the navel, and
hence the stone that marked the center of the world, and repeat
it, omphalos, omphalos, omphalos, until its blunt and falling
music becomes the music of somebody pumping water at
the pump outside our backdoor. (p. 17)
Then, there are the classic deceptions committed by poets
who have chosen to unwrap for the aspiring poet the secrets
from the omphalos of Helicon: The first, is Poe's (1987)
abstract title "The Philosophy of Composition" where he
declares how a poem can be turned into a concrete reality
"with the precision and rigid consequence of a mathematical
formula" (p. 229) The second is a rather concrete title of Frost,
"The Figure a Poem Makes," for an abstract understanding of
poetry that must begin in delight and end in wisdom. However,
what we see in these happy deceptions is the fact of the poet as
the craftsman who can give flesh to the word.
The Western alignment looks at the poet as the one who
makes, as the one who writes. Other than Coleridge who is
believed to have terminated the process of poetic transcrip-
tion following the interruption from the man from Porlock,
most poets have persisted with the urge, like Wordsworth
(1962) who even after wondering "Wither is fled the visionary
gleam?/Where is it now, the glory and the dream?" (p. 178)
have proceeded to complete the poem. Wordsworth is struck
by the sense of despair in 1802 but perseveres to complete
the "Immortality Ode" in 1807. This anecdote does affirm
the determination of the poet to finish the job of crafting a
verbal icon. It also underlines the suggestion that the poet is
not always as sensitive to the inner call like Coleridge at the
time of composing "Kubla Khan." The Western alignment is
more consistent with the image of a Wordsworth determined
to manufacture the poem as an artifact than with a Coleridge
who symbolizes the readiness to give up once the impulse
dries up. The difference between Coleridge and Wordsworth
is the difference between a transcription and a manufacture.
The construction of an Aurobindo-nian theory of poetry
will be possible only after the ideological framework is set up.
Now, the ideological framework of Sri Aurobindo can only be
configured in terms of large fields in the present context. The
scope of the present article does not allow for a detailed delin-
eation of each of the fields that SriAurobindo was involved in
and committed to as the very purpose of his life. However, for
enabling the logic of the theory emerging out of the ideologi-
cal framework, one may point to Sri Aurobindo's complete
absorption of Western education, which also marks the begin-
ning of his quest for the vital truth about man.
His journeys into the mind, where he confronts the issues
about the mind's constructions like the potency of medita-
tion, the realization about the ascent of consciousness, the
shape of the universal mind, the limits of psychoanalysis,
and the passage toward supramental vision and supramental
power, are journeys toward the "interior landscape" (a phrase
used by A. K. Ramanujan) that also map the emergence of a
distinct terrain of knowledge which can lend greater cre-
dence to the intellectual engagements in the humanities.
How else can one understand the triadic approach by Sri
Aurobindo to link the individual with the field of conscious-
ness and the poetic traditions?
For instance, Sri Aurobindo constructs a triad starting with
the romantic poetic tradition which, according to him, is an
"instinctive" field of consciousness that occupies the individual
at the level of the body. This triadic relationship is suggested by
Wordsworth in "TinternAbbey" as "sensations sweet/Felt in the
blood." A more evolved triad is the classical tradition that cor-
responds to the "intelligent" field of consciousness and it occu-
pies the individual at the level of the "mind." Wordsworth's
second category would be "sensations sweet/ . . . Felt along the
heart." Sri Aurobindo's third and highest triadic relationship
would be the "real" tradition that emerges out of the "intuitive"
field of consciousness and which corresponds to the "yogic"
stage of evolution of the individual/poet. This is suggested by
the highest, ineffable stage that Wordsworth reached in these
words: "Sensations sweet/ . . . And passing even into my purer
being/With tranquil restoration."
It would suffice to register here, for any future elabora-
tion, that Sri Aurobindo's Letters carry the potential for the
theory of poetry that stands on three guiding principles: First,
the theory of poetry outlined by Sri Aurobindo; second, the
evaluation of English poetry (by which Sri Aurobindo means
poetry by the English poets); and finally, the future of poetry
which he calls the "Future Poetry."
The first stage of the ideological framework would involve
the delineation of the idea of "soul-poetry" manifested as the
"mantra." This is directly related to Sri Aurobindo's ideas on
the "essence" of poetry that springs forth from "rhythm" and
"movement" of speech that evolve beyond the merely pleasur-
able to the truly incantatory. The poetic theory would then
admit only such "style" and "substance" as would contribute
to the "poetic vision" evoked by the mantra.
After positing the ideological framework, Sri Aurobindo
comments on the "national evolution" of poetry based on
which he evaluates the "character" of English poetry and the
course it describes from the time of Chaucer through modern
literature through the Victorian poets to the "new birth" of
Decadence. In this regard, Sri Aurobindo characterizes the
poets, Keats and Shelley, Byron and Wordsworth, and, finally,
Blake and Coleridge as the "poets of the Dawn"; each pair
suggesting a particular stage of evolution from the body rep-
resented by Keats and Shelley to the mind represented by
Byron and Wordsworth to the highest stage in English poetry
4 SAGE Open
which only Blake and Coleridge could come close to achiev-
ing. Sri Aurobindo feels that the last pair was wanting in "the
gravity and enduring substance."
What Sri Aurobindo implies through the apparent vague-
ness in the phrase, "the gravity and enduring substance" can
be understood when one explores his ideas about "Future
Poetry" about which he has spoken and written extensively.
The idea of the Future Poetry can be configured through an
exploration of the "ideal spirit" of poetry; the idea of "poetic
truth"; the "breath" that brings into consciousness, the greater
life; the "soul of poetic delight and beauty"; the "power" of the
spirit that infuses the poetry of "mantra"; its "form" and the
precise relationship between the "word and the spirit."
The Letters, thus, become a viable site for the construction
of a theory of poetry, provided one decides on a three-stage
approach beginning with the ideological framework, the appli-
cation of the ideas on poetic performance, and, finally, relocat-
ing the interaction with the framework of Sri Aurobindo's
ideas about the poetry of the future where he determines the
role of the poet as the conductor or the medium for the meet-
ing of the individual mind with the universal mind that brings
about the evolution of consciousness.
What this author posits is that a theory of poetry based on
the Letters must shift from a Western alignment where the poet
is the person who writes toward a different understanding of
the poet provided by Sri Aurobindo. An excerpt from the letter
dated June 2, 1931, on "Poetic Creation" reads as follows:
When the source of inspiration is in the heart or the
psychic there is more easily a goodwill in the vital chan-
nel, the flow is spontaneous; the inspiration takes at
once its true form and speech and is transmitted without
any interference or only a minimum of interference by
the brain-mind, that great spoiler of the higher or deeper
splendours . . . The poet labours in anguish to get the
one true word, the authentic rhythm, the real divine
substance of what he has to say, while all the time it is
waiting complete and ready behind; but it is denied free
transmission by some part of the transmitting agency
which prefers to translate and is not willing merely to
receive and transcribe. (Sri Aurobindo, 2004, p. 6)
The excerpt talks about poetic creation and the role of the
poet. It does talk about the poet as a writer but only when he
is unable to allow the self to respond to the inspired call from
the subtle plane. The poet as a writer is one who fails to
keep the outer mind in check and presides over the spoiling
of the inspiration as it flows through the creative vital. By
implication, then, the poet in the scheme of Sri Aurobindo
(2004) would be a medium who allows the process of cre-
ation to happen where his intellect, intuition, and illumined
mind do have a role to play; only, that the proportion to
which the elements of integration are controlled by the poet
would determine whether the poem is going to be a "pure
transcript" or a "mental manufacture" (p. 5). The shift in the
theoretical alignment toward Sri Aurobindo's understanding
of poetry and the role of the poet would mean a radical shift
in the understanding of the poet as a writer to the poet as the
enabling creative spirit that waits for the manifestation of
beauty: from the poet who writes to the poet who waits.
Did Matthew Arnold mean the same when he talked about
the Scholar Gypsy waiting for the spark from heaven to fall?
Or, did T. S. Eliot mean the same when he talked about the
"awful daring of a moment's surrender"? Where they also
aligning themselves to an Eastern thinking where the body is a
medium through which the spirit expresses the splendor of
truth? These are questions that will become interesting when
one is persuaded that the more popular notion of the poet as the
"master craftsman" as Eliot chose to call Ezra Pound changes
toward a notion of the poet as the integrated self that waits.
