Introduction: The Changing Face of
Africa's Social Conflict
Terrorism plays an increasingly arduous role in redefining
the political and security undercurrents of the last quarter of
the 20th and early 21st century on the African continent.
This article emphasizes the manifestations of factors of elite
dominance against the influences of globalization in the
contemporary wave of terrorism within the sub-Saharan
African States. The consequences of the interaction of dom-
inant economic and political structures in the society con-
siderably incite the transformation and activation of latent
ideologies of socioeconomic liberation accommodated
under various typologies of terrorism. Although it may be
tempting to compound the complex nature and situation of
terrorism in the continent as simply religious, the concept of
socioeconomic liberation provides a common linkage to its
manifestations and dimensions. Referencing cases, particu-
larly, from the Nigerian situation, this article underscores
the ideological shift and conflict for economic and political
authority between the emergent interest groups nay terror-
ists and the subsisting elite groups within leadership posi-
tions in the region. The article is subdivided into four parts.
The first part covers the concept of elite dominance and the
impact of globalization in encouraging the emergence of ter-
rorist forces. The second part examines the wave of social
unrest that serves as forerunners of the destructive and pecu-
niary led terrorist ideas of the present day--that some have
described as the new terrorism (Otenyo, 2004), in contrast
with the terrorism of the colonial and postcolonial periods.
The social and economic cost of terrorism is the third com-
ponent and looks at the implications of terrorism and elite
dominance for security, growth, and development of the
continental economy. Presented in part four is a theoretical
examination of elite dominance as a product of a subsisting
colonial mentality­wholly encapsulated within political
governance on the continent. Finally, the article concludes
by raising policy-relevant questions of security and gover-
nance on the continent.
Determining the appropriate definition for terrorism is a
common issue in terrorism literature. Early scholars simply
described it as the destructive and arbitrary employment of
violent activities designed to induce fear (E. V. Walter, 1969;
Wilkinson, 1974), a position reaffirmed by a variety of con-
temporary scholars, counterterrorism experts, and policy
makers (Abadie, 2004; Franks, 2006; Freedman, 2007;
Martins, 2009). However, according to Otenyo (2004), terror-
ism may be more schematically defined as the new and the
old terrorism. He describes the new terrorism as being inter-
national in scope and involving the use of modern technology,
such as cyberspace. Although the old terrorism laid claims to
some altruistic motivations for its actions, the new terrorism
uses no nuances to hide its objectionable criminality. The new

Local Neocolonialism and Terrorism
in Africa
Kingsley U. Ejiogu1 and Thomas S. Mosley1
Abstract
This study examines the critical nature and the difficulties associated with understanding the fundamental ideology of the
postcolonial wave of new terrorism on the African continent. This is facilitated through a contemporary interpretation of
elite dominant economic and political structures and their role in the transformation and activation of latent ideologies of
socioeconomic liberation. The consequences of the interaction of these dominance structures in the society are examined
as a colonial legacy, which predicts and domiciles a state of international dependency and a culture of corruption within
postcolonial African states. The remedy for this practice is discussed as a function of good governance and is based on the
expansion of communication, socioeconomic opportunities, and social mobility.

form is much bolder, cruder, and involves the employment of
martyrdom and emotions to induce fear and reverence, and to
recruit converts. At the core of the ideals of both the new and
the old is religious fervor. Pecuniary gain is also a primary
component of each. In the context of the present study, we
define terrorism as the uncontested use of violence to achieve
ideological, political, and socioeconomic goals by state or
nonstate actors against combatants or noncombatants.
In 1994, Martha Crenshaw, a leading scholar of terrorism,
observed that terrorism in Africa had not taken the shape of
terrorism in the Middle East and Asia. Apparently, she was
implying that African governments, particularly those of the
sub-Saharan nations, did not support international terrorism.
Today, given the plausibility of state encouragement of elite
dominance systems on the continent (Imershein, Rond, &
Mathis, 1992) that may influence and provide some political
impetus for the emergence of the new terrorism on the local
continental front, Crenshaw's assertion is no longer relevant.
Elite dominance is a governing system based on pecuniary
privilege. Nieto (2014) defined "the elite" as "a group of
people with a privileged position inside the political, mili-
tary, economic, and cultural structure of nations whose deci-
sions have very important consequences for the rest of the
society." Elite dominance is a structural and functional part
of most socioeconomic systems, and its political restructur-
ing is an ongoing process (Imershein et al., 1992). The elites
as used in the article are based on C. Wright Mills's (2000)
typology--described as the "Power Elite" at the top end of
the power hierarchy, and sub-elites--comprising the politi-
cal, economic, and military confidants and consultants to the
former group. The idea that elite dominance systems are
associated with the modern resurgence of terrorism in Africa
receives a very little inquiry. Although elite dominance as a
perfunctory system might appear to have a distant and casual
relationship with terrorism, it deserves consideration, none-
theless. Globalization opened up information on the manifes-
tation of elite dominance in poor and sociopolitically weak
societies and has encouraged the grouping of forces to coun-
ter it. Although some of these forces follow the paths of
social unrest and democratization, others rose with insurgen-
cies and terrorism.
The issues examined in this article emphasize the circum-
stances under which the various elite relationships may have
emerged. They also analyze the related consequences--from
the perspectives of the conflict of social classes to the rise of
postcolonialism, or the new terrorism. The terrorist groups
involved in the new terrorism explicate struggles against
national and foreign interests. Given the pecuniary nature of
current terrorist practices on the continent, the question
arises: How can sub-Saharan African nations spread oppor-
tunities for social mobility beyond the dominant elite groups?
The answer should provide a deeper understanding of the
nature, creative tendencies, and sustenance of terrorism on
the African continent, as well as its implications for conti-
nental and global security.
Elite Dominance
The forms of modernization associated with elite dominance
systems in colonial African States--like sub-Saharan
Africa--are similar to the type that Remmer (1976) identified
in the Latin American nations, Chile and Argentina. This pat-
tern, called the "comprador bourgeoisie," is a kind of modern-
ization that is dependent on international economic forces and
has its roots in colonial, political, and economic domination
(Remmer, 1976). Remmer explains that the comprador bour-
geoisie system has a tendency to form and align with and then
fall prey to undemocratic forces, contrasted to the more pro-
gressive pattern of independent bourgeoisie. Influenced by
powerful, external systems that are beyond its control,
Remmer argues that this pattern of bourgeoisie tends to form
a coalition of elites in both the public and private sectors, each
with vested interest in the underdevelopment of their respec-
tive nations. In effect, the corresponding international eco-
nomic control empowers them to maintain their favored
statuses. In the case of Chile and Argentina, these patterns
became an upper-class economic coalition at the expense of
the lower-class groups (Remmer, 1976). The structure of the
elite dominance in a society viewed in terms of a pyramidal
hierarchy--a few individuals at the very top of the pyramid
control the socioeconomic and political power of the society.
Although the common notion is that societies are controlled
by a diversity of competing interest groups, in reality a very
few individuals control the broad stream of power centers
across most societies. The late sociologist, C. Wright Mills,
provided the fundamental premises of the elite theory. Mills,
one of the most referred elite theorists, explains that the cen-
ters of elite power in modern societies are located in the
bureaucracies of the government, economic, and military
institutions. Unlike in the premodern era, when the power of
the elites was concentrated in individuals such as monarchs,
the powers of the modern elites depend on authority and attri-
butes of social organizations (Mills, 2000). According to
Mills, the "positions of the power elite enable them to tran-
scend the ordinary environments of ordinary men and women
(p. 4)." To complete the elite apparatchik, middle-level elites
occur at the spot on the pyramid below the power elites. These
comprise the politicians, upper-class individuals, celebrities,
and local authorities. It is interesting that Mills noted that
though the power elites make the most important decisions in
society, however, the decisions they make or do not make are
often less important compared to the pivotal positions they
occupy. In other words, at the apex of societal power in mod-
ern societies where decision making occurs, positions take
preeminence over the capability to make the required deci-
sions. Mills observed that "often the power elite are so uncer-
tain of their roles and even more often they allow their fears
and hopes to affect their assessment of their own power (p.
4)." The implied paradox is that in the fear to keep the power,
the elites focus less on their roles than on the need to resist
others who may want to usurp those powers (Mills, 2000).
Ejiogu and Mosley 3
A critical point in the political development of most post-
colonial states, often overlooked, involves the process
through which rural elitism mushrooms into an urban form.
To understand the African situation of elite dominance, one
can draw upon instances from other societies where the
impact of elite dominant structures on the societal level has
received significant, scholarly attention. Although in most
precolonial societies the relationship between the peasants
and the local elite may have been consensual and mutually
beneficial in some areas of communal management, the
colonial evolution of the rural to urban elitism did not pro-
vide any opportunities for such agreements in Africa. In
other words, colonial-day peasants were not involved in the
transition to urban elitism, nor in the negotiations that pre-
ceded the political process handed down to the urban elite
(Brewster, 2008). Similarly, Brewster (2008) observed that
the rural Mexican elite is not considered a major player in
local politics, yet the maintenance of power is dependent on
exploitation of the peasants through the use of skills of
manipulation and practices that were cultured over centuries.
In Nigeria, Usman Dan Fodio founded the northern Fulani
Oligarchy, Dan Fodio was a feudal warrior with Islamic
Middle Eastern origins. He created the Sokoto Caliphate, a
politico-religious state successor selected by the British
colonial authorities as they prepared to depart Nigeria. The
Caliphate ruled Nigeria through a highly manipulative state,
social, and religious process for four decades after colonial
abdication of power. Dan Fodio's highly trained descendants
were able to spread this structure of dominance through a
very brilliant transition of a rural elite class--structured
around traditional emirate ruling families--into a national
modern urban elite class.
The emergence, dominance, and maintenance of elitism
in diverse cultural societies are not unilateral. Some of the
forces influencing elitism include political and economic
factors, social class, ethnicity, and family. The effects of
these forces differ in the context of a particular analysis and
locality. For the most part, these systems perpetuate them-
selves from generation to generation (Brewster, 2008).
Brewster contends that there is a very significant dimension
of elite dominance. Facing such an advantageous position,
elites would take steps to maintain their status for future gen-
erations. This is usually the point of conflict in many modern
societies, where informed members of the working class
seek to encroach upon these elite domains, sometimes with-
out the structures of political power, social class, proper fam-
ily connection, or belonging to the dominant ethnic groups.
Such a revolt is potent enough to present formidable chal-
lenges to the status quo. According to Mills (2000), the elite
apportion greater attention to the maintenance of their posi-
tion compared to the requirements of the position.
In a way, economic terrorism pose challenges to the new
urban ruling elite, particularly by the peasants excluded from
the negotiations that preceded the former's emergence.
However, with increasing evidence of the involvement of the
so-called elite class in the sponsorship of terrorist activities,
this argument diminishes. In many postcolonial states, the
authority of the urban elite is still fundamentally local. In sub-
Saharan African states, the structure of the modern elite class
is based on the primordial beliefs of the protection of kin-
ships, the maintenance of cultural domains, the advancement
of notions of ethnic superiority, preservation of traditional
family ties, and broadening of the extant spatial power base.
However, the organic state, since compromising these mecha-
nisms, created platforms for the evolution of other power-
dominant systems, ones that are controlled by wealthy
individuals with amassed land and financial and other capital
assets, all protected by networks of paid political machines
prone to use violent reprisals against enemy systems.
Nonetheless, the real threat to urban elitism is its prejudiced
reluctance to renegotiate its postcolonial emergence with
local peasants. Intrinsically, these power-dominant systems
closely resemble terrorist structures. Because resilience
lodges among the primary pillars of elite dominance, alli-
ances routinely exhibit and manipulate raw power. Generally,
members of this class emerge from similar social structures.
This has enhanced the integration of the structures of domi-
nant institutions in society--through which the alliance of the
government, economic, and military elite is coordinated and
maintained (Mills, 2000). Referencing the colonial legacy of
Mexico's political elite, Nieto (2014) argued that corruption
within the Mexican cultural, political, and economic systems
is rooted in colonialism. His account examines the decline of
traditional societies and traditionally held customs, norms,
and values as a consequence of a colonial hierarchical man-
agement system vested in the privileged acquisition of pro-
duction, labor, and land from the locals. In addition, Nieto
looks at one aspect of the colonial theory and concludes that
the manifest effect of economic, political, and psychological
constraints and disenfranchisements established by the colo-
nial system is the emergence of corruption through nepotism
and the social and economic underdevelopment of the people.
He noted that the conflict between the traditional values of
indigenous Mexican citizens and those of the mixed breed
citizens of indigenous and European descent was also a clash
of the law and its application. His position can be illustrated,
similarly, under the Durkheimian analysis of the transition
from the traditional mechanistic to the organic society of
17th-century France. In each of these situations, the inability
to control a fast changing society easily led to hemorrhages in
both law maintenance and criminal innovations. But in the
case of the colonialized, the path of change to the organic
society was forced--not negotiated--by an external power,
the colonial system, whose primary goal was resource expro-
priation. Thus, this conflict built into the laws, and the institu-
tions and models of governance as corrupt modifiers have
endured. The crisis point in this change involved the locals
adapting to new ways of doing things as part of the norm. The
political elite has, since, entrenched the system of ruling by
corruption in the postcolonial governments.

The adoption of corruption as a mode of governance has
become so pervasive in Mexico that a magazine survey
reported by Nieto showed that, in as much as the gains of
corruption are usefully applied, 48% of all Mexicans did not
seem worried by the status quo. In addition, 70% of the
respondents support official theft if the public share in the
loot. Seen in this light of public acceptance of corruption, by
far, the greatest loss to the nation is the modification of tradi-
tional norms and values of the society regarding the means to
achievable goals. These systems of elite rule by corruption
are not unique to Mexico. Rather, they reflect the poor gov-
ernance of postcolonial sub-Saharan African states.
Elite dominance restricts social mobility within some
groups, sometimes to as little as 1% of the population in
many postcolonial economies (Coe & Davidson, 2011;
Easterly, 2006; Ridge, 2013). Ridge (2013) described social
mobility as "the rise and fall of individuals between social
and economic groups," which depends on access to opportu-
nities structured around political, social, and economic
power schemas, controlled by the dominant elite groups in
society. He notes that social mobility in Britain is limited to
about 7% of the population, who are, mostly, graduates of
elite private schools. This practice is a form of social engi-
neering. Elite dominance by nepotism--shared personal
relations that are, originally, a part of the British Monarchy.
It spread abroad as a tool of control in the colonial adminis-
trative structure (Rodney, 1974). Elite dominance practices
occur at different levels of the societal structure, such as in
the form of legacy admissions in U.S. Ivy League colleges, a
national ideology of meritocracy and individual opportuni-
ties, notwithstanding. Colleges apply elite privilege practices
as avenues for colleges to retain financial donations, family
loyalty, as well as for maintaining tradition (Coe & Davidson,
2011). Ridge (2013) argued that the continuing skew in the
spread of social mobility and economic opportunities for the
elite class resulted in a strong reductive effect on the global
competitive nature of Britain. Through a network of institu-
tional and relational arrangements, the economic elite in
nations like Britain and Germany utilize bureaucratic power,
ownership, and social capital to maintain their dominance
(Windolf, 1998). Yepiskoposian, Margarian, Andonian, and
Rashidvash's (2011) examination of cultural change among
Turkish-speaking people of Northwestern Iran reveal that
elite dominance imposes fundamental cultural changes, such
as the replacement of the language of the subordinate groups.
Similarly, in Northern Nigeria, the elite dominance struc-
tures of the Hausa­Fulani ruling families seem to have
replaced a significant proportion of native languages of the
indigent ethnic groups with the Hausa language (Crawford,
1979). In many instances, for the purpose of accomplishing
goals and creating opportunities, and to protect group ideo-
logical and social advantages, elites in different societies cre-
ate structural stratifications of class, ethnicity, and religion.
Nieto's (2014) definition of the elite contends that their
decisions have important consequences for the rest of society,
especially when social groups competing for political and
economic interests become oblivious to the fact that the popu-
lar direction of political power is for the general societal good
and well-being. We examine the salient consequences of elite
dominance, next, in relation to the emergence and activities of
prominent terrorist groups in colonial and postcolonialAfrica.
Terrorism as a Postcolonial Conflict of
Social and Economic Stagnation
Writing in response to the 9/11 crisis, Stefan Mair (2003)
noted that Africa remains an area largely omitted in the con-
versations on the war on terror. Generally, disaffection and
disdain was the response toAl-Qaeda's initial call forAfrican
Muslims to join its terrorist network in the sub-Saharan
region. Although as reported in a few nations like Somalia,
Sudan and, more recently, Nigeria, Al-Qaeda-style terrorism
appeals to some adherents of the Islamic faith, resulting in
the growth of formidable followership (Mair, 2003).
However, because of the socioeconomic hardships in sub-
Saharan African, instead of exportation, terrorism acts
inward against the state and its economic institutions.
Reported cases of terrorist incidents in sub-Saharan Africa
increased dramatically from three in 1970 to 449 in 1990.
This figure surged another 100% in 1992. Although there
was an annual average decline of about 50% of reported ter-
rorist cases from 1998 to 2004, within a range of 4 years
before (1994) and 4 years after this period (2008), the num-
ber of reported terrorist episodes peaked to 381 and 372,
respectively. In particular, the Nigerian situation has been
very troubling. Between 1983 and 1992, for example,
reported incidents of terrorism in Nigeria increased by 300%.
Terrorist cases rose, again, by 41.6% (17 incidents) in 1997.
There were major declines in 1998 and 2002. However, in
2008 and 2010, reported cases of terrorism climbed to all-
time highs of 75 and 62 incidents, respectively (Global
Terrorism Database, 2011). In general, for each succeeding
decade, the pattern emerging from both the Nigerian and the
wider sub-Saharan data sets is one of mounting terrorist
incidents.
Scholars have reiterated the relationship between global-
ization, the nation state, and terrorism. Because of the factors
of transnational human mobility (e.g., wars, natural disasters,
trade and commerce), the development of nations and cul-
tures is influenced by the external political, economic, and
social forces (Remmer, 1976). Globalization, defined as "the
free movement of capital, goods, knowledge, manpower, and
services among countries due to the increased technological
and scientific improvements and diminished state-centric
power" (Demir & Varlik, 2015, p. 38), also serves to inte-
grate cultures across diverse regions of the world. In spite of
the advantages of the socioeconomic and cultural dimen-
sions of globalization, the phenomenon has dire implications
for the security of nations. The forces of globalization have
considerably weakened the concept of the sovereign nation
Ejiogu and Mosley 5
state which is the bedrock of the fight against terrorism
(Demir & Varlik, 2015). Many states in the demanding ter-
rorist regions of the world, such as the Middle East, can no
longer sustain the security and stability required to contain
the persuasions and activities of terrorists on their own soil.
Demir and Varlik (2015) shared the view that the world as a
global unit cannot defeat terrorism while undermining the
nation state. It is now well documented that the globalization
of terrorism enlarges, considerably, the reach and power of
its activities, especially in its advancement and use of tech-
nological operations platforms (Demir & Varlik, 2015;
Ejiogu, 2015; Onwudiwe, 2001). One of the dramatic influ-
ences of globalization is the worsening of socioeconomic
inequality. It also influences the creation of multiple chan-
nels of international interdependencies beyond the interde-
pendence of states (Demir & Varlik, 2015), through which
new forms of powers are created and new knowledge of
political and socioeconomic inequalities, which feed discon-
tent and ways of challenging dominions, are being learned
and practiced. Through the enhancement of political and
economic opportunities and global cultural integration, glo-
balization, in a sense, creates conditions which trigger the
socioeconomic polarization of society, the strengthening of
elite dominance, easy access to terrorist ideals through free
and cheap technological platforms, and the weakening of the
powers of individual nation states.
Reflecting on the genesis of contemporary terrorism
forms in Africa, external accounts contend that piracy in
Somalia is a result of the lack of a rule of law, insecurity, and
the absence of government. Somali pirate groups contributed
close to 40% of global piracy in 2008 (Ploch, Blanchard,
O'Rourke, Mason, & King, 2011). However, insider accounts
from Somalia suggest that piracy is a survivalist response to
economic despoliation, degraded fishing grounds by interna-
tional toxic waste dumping, illegal trawler fishing, and
drought. Pirate groups in Somalia organize along clan lines
in isolated towns and regions (Ploch et al., 2011). Similarly,
Niger Delta piracy in Nigeria arose from estranged fishing
communities angered by the degradation of their sensitive,
deltaic ecosystem by petroleum exploration companies
(Ogundiya & Amzat, 2006). State terrorism in Nigeria
received global attention as the "Niger Delta Crisis" when
the Nigerian military, at the behest of the Anglo-Dutch Shell
Oil conglomerate, raised Ogoni villages because of local dis-
turbance and riots on its facilities. By the time the military
left Ogoni, about 1,000 villagers were dead and another
20,000 homeless (Saro-Wiwa, 1992).
The increasing inroads of Islamic fundamentalism in
Northern Nigeria and the shift of political power to the South
in 1999 encouraged the politically motivated Boko Haram
band. The Great Lakes region of East Africa has also wit-
nessed the incessant problems of insurgency and insurrection
in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and Uganda. The
solid mineral resources in this region of sub-Saharan Africa
attract all sorts of foreign interests, insurgency, and rebellions.
This has resulted in heightened weapons trafficking, kidnap-
ping, illegal mining and an encouragement of terrorist activi-
ties by dissident groups in this area (Daley, 2006; Hayes &
Burge, 2003; Montague, 2002). Coltan, for instance, is a
choice material in high-tech industries. Its value to industries
in the Silicon Valley is such that the U.S. government desig-
nates it a strategic mineral (Hayes & Burge, 2003; Montague,
2002). Beyond the traditional, political, and ethnic contests
and rivalry in the DRC, international investment in illegiti-
mate mining operations finances rebel forces, thus ensuring
the continuing instability of the nation through conflicts, fraud,
official corruption, and the weakening of civil institutions.
Also implicated in mineral exploitation are the armies of
neighboring African nations, Uganda and Rwanda, which
secure companies and serve as conduits and stakeholders in
mining operations (Montague, 2002). Visible defects in the
present-day governance infrastructure in many African states
indicate that the elitist reinforcement of the corrupt ideals of
colonialism poses barriers to the proper domestication of
Western democratic cultures inherited after independence.
Most postcolonialAfrican nations embraced the colonial state-
craft ideology of undermining the rights of occupied citizens
(Dickson, 1989). Early manifestations of this misrule became
evident in a series of coups and counter-coups in sub-Saharan
Africa (Ciliers, 2003). The continental leadership of the
African Union (2004) is concerned with the international vari-
ants of terrorism, while subnational and state terrorism, such
as corrupt leadership is more critical to Africa. Studies on ter-
rorism assume that only traditional ideological concepts of
religion, leftism, conservatism, and ethnonationalism typify
terrorist activities (Martins, 2009). But, a critical review of
governance on the continent reveals that terrorism underwent
a form of local domestication, resulting from the mass percep-
tion of alienation from modern, elite progress, as well as from
the politico-corporate plunder and the squandering of the con-
tinent's natural resources during the postcolonial era (L.
Walter, 1996). A significant portion of terrorist violence in
sub-Saharan Africa is unidirectional and vertical against busi-
nesses and economic activities. In response, African govern-
ments resort to state terrorism, brutalization, unlawful arrests,
detention, and torture. State terrorism uses clandestine
methods, including murder, to check political opposition
(Clutterbuck, 1986). The point made is that in these confronta-
tions, it is not clear when insurgency evolves into terror or
whenterroristsbecomeinsurgents(Kilcullen,2005).Ogundiya
(2009) suggested that to understand the causes of terrorism, it
is essential to delineate its typologies. Otenyo (2004) explored
terrorism during the colonial period in Kenya (1952-1958).
British authorities used the word "terrorism" to describe the
activities of the Mau land and freedom fighters. He associates
the internal domestic processes in Kenya with the terrorist
attacks in that nation. In New Terrorism, Otenyo describes
increased religious content and motivation, the practice of
martyrdom, the use of strategy and coordinated attacks, esca-
lation of terror networks, and advances in the usage of
6 SAGE Open
technology, for example, cyberspace. With regard to the rise of
jihadist terror adherents, Otenyo (2004) contended that the
main thrust of the elucidations of global terrorism is its explan-
atory power. However, he questioned the role of poverty in the
New Terrorism. Otenyo believes that poverty has little to do
with the rise of the new terrorism. This may be true only when
stated in such easy, palliative terms. But poverty is a relative
term--its dimensions spread much wider than the poverty of
the stomach. It is much more than the act of not having enough
resources on which to subsist. Poverty encompasses many
ingrained psychological dimensions, such as the poverty of
believing in a national ideology, hopelessness, losing trust in
societal leadership, and living an insecure lifestyle.
Otenyo (2004) equally noted that the new terrorism could
be associated with regional waves of Islamic fundamental-
ism and terrorism from the 1967 Arab­Israeli war, the 1979
return of Ayatollah Khomeini to Iran, and Osama bin Laden
and the Palestinian Intifada in 1991. These episodes acted as
microcosms, delivering other power interdependencies
across the globe, eliciting transmissions of knowledge about
challenging dominions within other dimensions of struggle.
Buttressing Otenyo's wave of the New Terrorism in Africa,
Kagwanja (2006) added that "since the September 2011 ter-
rorist incidents, the United States's war on terror has accen-
tuated the level of insecurity in the nations of the Horn of
Africa, including Kenya, Somalia, Eritrea, Tanzania, Uganda,
Comoros, Djibouti, and Sudan." Insecurity in this region
emanates from the diverse forms of state and nonstate
actors--criminal and terrorist elements engaged as guerril-
las, bandits, cattle rustlers, pirates, liberation movements,
vigilantes, and other diverse forms of state terror players.
Unlike Otenyo's observation that poverty has meager influ-
ences on the rise of the new terrorism in Africa, Kagwanja
emphasizes that poverty, chronic underdevelopment and a
deep sense of marginalization, and the negative forces of
economic liberalization and the historical linkages to the
Middle East are influential to the new terrorism in Africa.
In his book Dilemmas of Weak States: Africa and
Transnational Terrorism in the Twenty-First Century,
Mentan (2004) examined the problem of weak and failed
states and their relationships to the rise of terrorist activities
inAfrica. He clarified that the root causes of conflicts and the
weak states of nations in Africa are not the products of a sur-
plus inflow of conventional arms from Europe, Asia, and
America--due to the war on terror or any other war, but,
rather, the failure of African governments to abide by the
social contract between the citizens and the state. The failure
of these governments to deliver on the promises of statehood
results from corruption, incompetence, a lack of responsibil-
ity to governing roles, and a general misunderstanding of the
notions of statehood and leadership, all of which leads to a
general pauperization of geographic and socioeconomic
fringes and hinterlands and a mass migration of the young
and audacious to the urbanized centers of government power,
where messages that would feed their socioeconomic and
political discontent are free and easy to come by. Mentan
argues that, the variables that compound these problems in
Africa include the following:
1. Chronic conflicts that shatter economies and create
vast refugee camps
2. Corrupt, incompetent, and undemocratic African
governments, and.
3. International political and economic systems--con-
cerned about Realpolitik, oil supply, and the interest
of global finance than about the well-being of
Africans (p. ix).
The political and economic elite maintain a hegemony on
their nation states in Africa, which enhances the ideological
vacuum of leadership and development (Mentan, 2004). This
vacuum, some suggests, derives from the inability of these
leaders to differentiate their personal interest from the soci-
etal goals, thus manifesting the creation of personality cults
of leadership that is accountable to nothing and to no one.
Mills (2000) has explained that often the modern "Power
Elite" assign greater attention to keeping their position than
the critical role of making decisions that would advance the
progress of their societies. The primary problem of the
African leadership brand of elite dominance is found in its
ideological vacuum, replete with ill-conceived rules and reg-
ulations, and a lack of adherence to its own rules (Mentan,
2004). Mentan makes note of the following statement by a
prolific South African-born author, Gavin Williams, which
illustrates the degree of cynicism associated with the pros-
pects of this ideological vacuum for leadership and develop-
ment in Nigeria.
The Nigerian bourgeoisie lack the commitment of a religious
socialist or national character of the rationalizing, capital-
accumulating, surplus-expropriating classes of Britain, Russia,
Germany, or Japan during their period of industrialization. In
fact, the Nigerian bourgeoisie does have an ideology in the sense
of a theoretical legitimization of the status quo. It is found in the
concept of development. (p. 6)
The reasons for the weaknesses of African states listed by
Mentan (2004, p. 12) reflect the weaknesses of dominant
elite apparatchiks of leadership in many African states: (a)
dependence, (b) lack of a coherent ideology, (c) softness, (d)
lack of a technical and analytical capacity to comprehend
impending consequences of state actions in the current inter-
national system, (e) hostile international environment that is
impatient with local African needs, and (f) poor record of
statehood. The excessive appointment of family and associ-
ates in government positions and propensity to advancing
their pecuniary interests in governance plays a major role in
weakening the elite dominant leadership in sub-Saharan
African states. These factors which we explore next,
Ejiogu and Mosley 7
contribute and boost the social and economic costs of terror-
ism on the continent.
Social and Economic Cost of Terrorism
Terrorism literature has revised the notion that terrorism is an
irrational act. The most abject form of terrorism--suicide ter-
rorism--has overcome the conventional wisdom of irrational-
ity? Observers of suicide terrorism say that it is a
well-coordinated and organized practice, as has been the case
for other forms terrorism. Just as well, terrorism can no longer
be described as attacks against noncombatant targets, alone
(Moghadam, 2006), because of full-fledged, state-seeking ter-
rorist groups in the middle-east, such as (Islamic State of Iraq
and the Levant (ISIL), regularly attack and engage armies of
sovereign nations, dispossessing them of their sovereign
spaces. If suicide terrorism defined as attacks by which success
is contingent on the death of its perpetrator (Moghadam, 2006),
in what ways might we define socioeconomic terrorism, the
primary interest of the present article? Newman (2006) stated
that knowledge of underlying sources of conflict in society is
fundamental to understanding the specific incidents and cate-
gories of terrorism more than the examination of the root causes
which are more useful for analytical purposes when considered
in conjunction with the precipitant factors of terrorism. As
Newman describes the root causes of terrorism in terms of the
"forms of causal relationships between underlying social, eco-
nomic, political, and demographic conditions," the differences
between underlying social conflicts and the aforementioned
root causes is semantic in the African context. In many sub-
Saharan African nations, the economic costs of terrorism are
poorly accounted. Frey, Luechinger, and Stutzer (2004) main-
tained that the cost of terrorism to the general well-being of the
individual citizen exceeds narrow economic repercussions. A
quantification of the real cost of terrorism is limited by simple
quantitative comparisons of terrorism by the number of inci-
dents (see Figures 1-3), human casualty figures, types of
weapon used, reliance on media reports and official statistics,
which have problems of underreporting, bias, and other
fluctuating methodologies. To support their position, Frey et al.
(2004) examined the major aspects of the economy impacted
by terrorism (i.e., foreign direct investment, foreign trade, tour-
ism, stock market, and urban economy), and concluded that,

despite the substantial cost implications, these effects do not
capture the nonmarket costs of terrorism, such as fear, grief for
victims, and bereavement.
How do we explain socioeconomic terrorism in sub-Saha-
ran Africa? We submit that social disorganization and eco-
nomic depression can explain the subsequent deviance of
domestic terrorism (Sandler & Walter, 2004). Examining ter-
rorist violence from an analogous position, Abadie (2004)
explained that, if levels of political freedom are considered,
risks of terrorism in poorer nations are not less than similar
risks in wealthier nations. Domestic terrorism accounts for
about 80% of terrorist activity around the world, compared to
transnational terrorism, which attracts greater global attention
(Abadie, 2004). Poverty is, indeed, a potential trigger of terror-
ism for the globalized world (Abrahamsen, 2005; Easterly,
2006). In the context of the present analysis, we suggest that the
partnership between the local expropriation interests of the
dominant elite business and governing class and the interests of
foreign multinational groups has a relationship to sociopolitical
conflicts in sub-Saharan Africa (Sofiri, 2007). According to
Mentan (2004), this collaboration lacks a coherent national
developmental ideology. For instance, the Niger Delta crisis of
the 1990s was a Nigerian dilemma that revealed the degree of
socioeconomic disaffection in the country--a practical mani-
festation of a people's economic predicament in the midst of a
hegemonic and exploitative institution. The structure of the
governmental process in Nigeria enables local exploitation, but
does not benefit indigent communities (Ogundiya & Amzat,
2006), perhaps describing a limited technical and analytical
capacity to comprehend impending consequences of state
actions within the global system. Comparatively, China wel-
comed global investors into its economy with a grounded
national developmental ideology and focus. One imagines
what the Chinese sociopolitical state (even with the remnants
of its fast receding communist structure intact) would look like
without the audacious plan to provide adequate opportunities
for social mobility to all its citizens. The terrorist crisis in
Nigeria, for instance, as displayed in the Niger Delta region, is
emblematic of two competing security positions (Okeke-
Uzodike & Isike, 2009). However, there is the state-centric
interest, consisting of the elite dominant governing structures
and its international allies, while on the other is the human
angle, made up of the militia and their communities. Within
this ultra-contentious scenario, whose security interests are
governments elected to represent, and whose economic inter-
ests are the terrorists set to protect? The Nigerian state's pri-
mary focus on the protection of foreign interests, without
equally articulating a similar agenda for the interests of its citi-
zens, is a reflection of its dependence on a hostile international
environmentthatisimpatientwithlocalAfricanneeds (Mentan,
2004). The zeal of religious extremists in Nigeria seems to
relate to socioeconomic disorientation as well. This is the pri-
mary dilemma of the Nigerian terrorism situation. State-created
social, economic, and political imbalances in Nigeria have
increased in the past three decades (Okeke-Uzodike & Isike,
2009). The case of the Boko Haram sect does not differ much
when examined from the perspective of broken down state and
social institutions, and the diminishing levels of state control
found in the inability to assure the dues of contractarian citizen-
ship. Profligate leadership, fraud, corruption, and resource
expropriation do not endear civic citizenship. It is as if the
social, political, and economic damage, imposed by decades of
poor leadership across the continent have awoken and embold-
ened these terrorist groups to challenge the status quo.
Neocolonial Theory of Localization
According to Durkheim's anomie theory, under the precepts
of the social changes that beset France during and after the
Industrial and French revolutions of the 18th century, eco-
nomic inequality was a significant element of the increase of
criminal behavior and not just the breakdown of the tradi-
tional French society. Similarly, multinational corporations
create an environment for crime by enabling huge economic
inequality in developing societies. The same patterns of
urban elitism and crime that occurred in Western and Eastern
Europe during their periods of modernization are currently
taking place in Asia and Africa (Vold, Bernard, & Snipes,
2001). However, the major differences may be glimpsed
from the ideological vacuum from which societal develop-
ment in nations like Nigeria are structured and undertaken by
the national leadership (see Mentan, 2004). Growth patterns
in many developing nations often do not follow real develop-
ment (United Nations Industrial Development Organizations
[UNIDO], 2011). The acclaimed dynamism of the Nigerian
society of the 1970s and 1980s, for instance, was totally set
around a rush for Nigeria's natural resources, anchored
around the Niger Delta region. This is reflective of colonial-
ism or the rush for the golden age of California gold mines in
the United States. Today, this situation has set up bands of
dissidents seeking their own path of the lucre, some through
instruments of state authority, and others through the ploy of
terrorism (Sofiri, 2007). In contrast to the contemporary
creed of economic terrorism, postmodern terrorism moved
away from the militant-only anarchist and leftist movements
of the late 19th century to a more ethnically based rationalist
movement with political upfront units (L. Walter, 1969). The
problem of locating an ideological position and framework
for terrorism in sub-Saharan Africa is similar to factors that
prevent total and direct ascription of terrorism to exclusive
state-sponsored terrorist activities globally. The closest ideo-
logical brand pertinent to terrorism in sub-Saharan Africa
appears to be "economic ethnonationalism" (Ogundiya,
2009; Ogundiya & Amzat, 2006; Okeke-Uzodike & Isike,
2009; Sofiri, 2007). Increased terrorist activity in sub-Saha-
ran Africa reflects the dynamic power of globalization's
information age to open up communities long held back by
closed governance systems to the reality of socioeconomic
mobility and the ability to be involved in the determination
Ejiogu and Mosley 9
of their own destinies. It has been observed that populations
unaffected by national political institutions develop little
political interests and, hence, are most unlikely to become
politically involved (Welfing, 1979). However, today, to the
extent that governance in sub-Saharan Africa has remained
unresponsive to the needs of its citizens, this position seems
to have taken a new turn. Since colonialism cannot be justi-
fied, then, correspondingly, indigenous occupation, even
under altruistic considerations, also cannot.
Traditionally, colonialism refers to "the establishment of
domination over a geographical external political unit,
mostly inhabited by people of a different race and culture,
where the domination is political and economic, and the col-
ony exists subordinated and dependent on the mother coun-
try" (Blauner, 1969, p. 395). Internal colonialism refers to
the elimination of foreign control of a state or territory, and
the control and exploitation of subordinate groups pass to the
dominant group (Tatum, 1994). Internal colonialism repro-
duces many of the same characteristics of the former colo-
nizing group (Gabbidon & Greene, 2009). In the book Race,
Ethnicity, Crime and Justice, Shaun Gabbidon (2010) offers
a cross-national explanation of these colonial constructs. He
argues that people respond differently to the same forms of
alienation. In probabilistic terms, people may differ in their
adoption of the same process of oppression (Tatum, 1994).
Similarly, in his book, Sociology in a Changing World,
William Kornblum claims that the characteristics of internal
colonialism are related to the subjugation of ethnic groups,
where the colonized did not enter the union voluntarily. This
involves dominance and the destruction of the culture of the
colonized by the colonial group. The colonizer begins to view
the colonized as a biologically and sociopolitically inferior
species (Kornblum, 2007). Kornblum's colonial theory shad-
ows an intrinsic perspective that manifests in native neocolo-
nial tendencies of governance systems in African nations like
Nigeria, today: the growing elitist perception of the other as
the socioeconomic nothings. This perception is invidious with
the concentration of poverty at one end of the sub-Saharan
underdevelopment space, against extreme riches at the other
end, under held by less than 1% of the population (Oxfam,
2014). Examining this negative trend of socioeconomic and
political aggrandizement within the centrum of a colonial
theory, a certain peculiar perspective is derivable. The con-
cept of internal colonialism identifies clear similarities
between the relationship of colonial exploitation and domi-
nance, which existed in the past between countries and the
relationship which exists, locally, in some countries today.
Internal colonialism is structurally described as a society
within a society, based on linguistic, ethnic, cultural, political
and economic inequalities (Blauner, 1969; Fanon, 1965;
Gabbidon, 2010; Kornblum, 2007), and thus the neocolonial
native dominance is anachronistic, being that, notwithstand-
ing, the interstitial union of numerous ethnicities, distinct
groups tend to form mostly from dominant urban elites and
families that assumed rulership from the departing colonials.
The postindependence nationalization of peripheral colonial
businesses and industry prepared the receptacle for these elite
group forms. This form of dominance, which emerged across
ethnic lines, has urban elitism as its common denominating
factor. The urban elite may emanate through high educational
attainment, economic wealth, family connection, or through
sheer force of political aggression. Domination in the local
neocolonial parlance may not necessarily be ethnically ori-
ented, but, rather, a creation of a system of dominance playing
against its own goals of governance. Here, class conflict is
equally relevant whether the dominating groups are foreign or
local. In contrast to traditional forms of colonialism, the local
colonial system is a union entered willingly as a unit (Fanon,
1965).
Similar to the common identification of autocratic systems
with inequality, Albertus and Menaldo (2014) found that eco-
nomic elites impede the redistribution of resources, even dur-
ing democratic regimes. Using a global, panel data set,
spanning the years 1972-2008, they found that democratic
regimes are better able to avoid the trap of elite dominance by
crafting a new constitution protected from the prejudices of
the outgoing regime. The impact of elite dominance on the
underdevelopment and marginalization of minorities--
women and the poor in India--suggests discriminatory prac-
tices that are, essentially, underinvestments in education and
other core developmental areas that are essential to uplifting
the socioeconomic conditions of the populace. The top 5% of
the population owns the greater share of land in India.
Examining the increasing legitimization of corrupt practices
in India, Jauregui (2014) discovered that the term jugaad is
used as a euphemism for allowing corruption, particularly in
the sense that it is a necessary and acceptable vice to achieve
the general societal goal for economic superiority. According
to Jauregui, jugaad is a sort of "provisional agency" for attain-
ing the so-called `better future'. Similarly, in Nigeria, the
term settlement is used as a precondition to allowing the cor-
rupters and partners unquestioned access to their loot. Why, in
most postcolonial states, has corruption become socially
acceptable, rather than a noxious crime against society's col-
lective values of integrity and equity? It is possible that, by
unconsciously redefining and eroding the distinctions
between virtue and vice in the minds of the public, elite domi-
nant influences and practices, steamed in a heritage of colo-
nial corruption, replicated itself across a broad spectrum of
socioeconomic and political platforms. These forms of elite
dominance, exemplified in India, mirror the patterns in local
neocolonial dominance forms in sub-SaharanAfrican nations.
The paradox is that these elite dominance practices lower
spending on developmental projects. At the same time, they
increase spending on nondevelopmental interests (Pal &
Ghosh, 2007). William Easterly (2001) described a similar
examination of elite dominance and ethnic divisions in
Pakistan as a Political Economy of Growth without
Development. In spite of an estimated US$58 billion worth of
foreign aid invested in Pakistan between 1959 and 1999, the
10 SAGE Open
elite underinvested in social and economic institutions rele-
vant to the human capital development of the majority popu-
lation. Apparently, Pakistan had merely witnessed growth but
not development, which is an index of quality of life and stan-
dard of living of the human population. According to a
UNIDO statistical country brief on Nigeria, developmental
indicators of growth--Manufacturing Value Added (MVA)
average annual real growth for 2000-2005--were 8.78, show-
ing that Nigeria witnessed real growth above the average
growth index of 6.70 for developing nations. However, the
Nigerian MVA per capita was between 13.24 and 17.60, com-
pared with 256.88 and 324.85 for developing nations
(UNIDO, 2011). This is an indication that Nigeria, like
Pakistan, witnessed growth but not development (Easterly,
2001, 2007; Easterly, Ross, & Roodman, 2004). Despite a
developing economy, the proportion of Nigerians living in
poverty rose 61%--from 68.7 million to 112.47 million--
between 2004 and 2010. This growing poverty trend accom-
panies a widening crisis of socioeconomic inequality (British
Broadcasting Corporation, 2012). Considering that by 2010,
112 million people of an estimated total population of 150
million (74.6%) lived below the poverty line (Figure 4), the
degree of this problem in Nigeria is herculean.
Today, entrenched and dysfunctional forms of urban elit-
ism and socioeconomic dominance systems are rampant in
most sub-Saharan African nations. The governments on the
continent generally allocate resource exploration rights to
friends, family and associates -since the governments, busi-
ness leaders, bureaucrats and politicians relate as members of
the elite groups. They act as the postcolonial conquerors of the
African continental landcape. The operational methods of
these elitist cliques are analogous to branched cults, with the
means and power to free access of poorly regulated national,
socioeconomic and political portfolios. Very recently,
Olusegun Obasanjo, the former Nigeria president, accused a
noted Nigerian business personality that he intentionally made
her a billionaire. Obasanjo mentioned that his intention was to
create 50 billionaires in Nigeria, but sadly he could only create
half of that number before the end of his leadership. What cri-
teria of leadership inform a president to create a class of 50
billionaires out of a population of 150 million citizens, where
more than 74.6% live under the threshold of poverty? Through
organized forms of elite manipulations and group dominance,
these "power elites" have made it, virtually, impossible for the
vast majority of continental Africans to attain the, seemingly,
meager goal of individual well-being. The inverse of Robert
Merton's (1938) strain theory is relevant, here, to accentuate
the strain derived from a lack of regulation or enforcement of
the core governance structures inAfrica. These structures have
been diminishing since the postcolonial era. Such strain affects
the populace, which struggles to assume the local elitist stan-
dard of socioeconomic somethings. Although colonial admin-
istrations effectively and appropriately utilized and regulated
the structures of its dominance for the sole goal of resource
expropriation, postcolonial African governments appropriated
only a part of the structure that processed resource expropria-
tion. Under a variety of epicurean maladies, they, unwittingly,
allowed the core regulatory and administrative superstructure
to diminish to nothingness. As a result, now you find govern-
ments that are vastly limited by undefined business processes
(Mapuva & Chari, 2010). A ramification of these loose gov-
ernmental procedures is the increasing loss of confidence in
government's ability to assure the social contract between it
and its citizenry. Terrorism--and its venture into the hardcore
criminality that is so symptomatically concerned with uplift-
ing the economic status of the terrorist--becomes a radius on
the circumference of a backlash, which may well be a path to
a definition of sub-Saharan Africa's brand of postcolonial
panic. Remonstrating, thus, is an emblematic syllogism.
Mapuva and Chari (2010) agreed that, with neocolonial prac-
tices of Africa's leadership class, traditional colonialism is no
longer to blame for Africa's problems.
Crenshaw debunked the claim of direct causative associa-
tion of terrorism with extenuating circumstances of ideologi-
cal persuasions, Western permissiveness, correlates of
psychopathology, and nationalism. She argued that most ter-
rorist acts emanate from direct, well thought, rational inten-
tions, where the social, economic, and political environment
is merely contextual. A causative factor of terrorism,
Crenshaw contends, consists of long-term preconditions and
immediate and specific precipitants. Among these precondi-
tions, the most impacting permissive factors are moderniza-
tion, social facilitation, and a particular government's attitude
and approach to terrorism. However, the terrorist's ideologi-
cal permutations receive transnational audiences. Crenshaw
suggests that the tangent of mass passivity and elite disaffec-
tion could, in fact, be a significant causative condition. She
points out that, although terrorism may not always be a direct
resultant of oppression, it may result from weakness of group
negotiation (Crenshaw, 1981). If one considers the level of
naiveté surrounding postcolonial governments in Africa,
colonial theory, viewed as a model of oppressive governance,
could be inheritable and Orwellian in concept. Naïveté
defines the lessons learned by these elitist class from the
colonial dominators; the incomplete assimilation of the colo-
nial tactics, appear to extend, ideologically, such oppressive
tendencies in, more-or-less, the same way, but couched in
more localized argot and crude operational methods.
To appreciate the emerging scenario of local neocolo-
nialism, we can compare the models of economic gover-
nance in both eras. Because of an abiding interest in
postcolonial expropriation, we find that the struggle for
expropriated resource control endures in the African con-
text as a task left unfinished by the continent's colonial
governments. The triangle of colonial resource expropria-
tion has not changed in Africa. Using the Niger Delta phe-
nomenon in Nigeria as a case study, the triangle still
consists of the foreign multinational entities and the local,
political, and business bourgeoisie. But, unlike in the past,
when the third arm of the triangle was that of the colonial
Ejiogu and Mosley 11
government, which provided the legal authority, organiza-
tion, and security for the enterprise, today, indigenous
African governments play that crucial role. The major
problem for those who agitate against these forms of
unregulated dominance is that the "thin line" between
fighting for economic freedom and terrorism have become
extremely indistinct. Local postcolonial leadership in sub-
Saharan Africa remains an iconic riddle awaiting explana-
tion (Kitching, 1980). African governments of the 1960s,
lacking resources and unable to better the lot of their citi-
zens, were known to manage power through subtle
"regimes of terror (Welfing, 1979)." It is however difficult
to support such rudimentary angles of exoneration today,
especially having seen the great amount of resources made
available by providence to nations like Nigeria in the past
four decades, yet without better results.
Arguments that terrorism has little to do with economics
but more with politics, frustration and seated feelings of
indignity, or to poverty and limited educational opportuni-
ties (Krueger & Maleckova, 2003) rely too heavily on the
common religious ideology of terrorism. In reality, it is dif-
ficult to consider a separation between political aspirations
and economic manifestations. The preeminent raison d
'etat for governance, according to the late French scholar of
punishment, Foucault, is to protect the people and their
commonwealth (Garland, 1997). Paraphrasing this
Foucauldian perspective, politics is inseparable from eco-
nomic aspirations. This reality is evident in the history and
practice of sub-Saharan African terrorism. The confusion
surrounding African governments involves understanding
that, unlike traditional colonial governments, the former are
not governing a conquered people. They are governing
their own citizens. Considering the vicarious nature of ter-
rorism evident in sub-Saharan Africa, there is evidence of
an elitist, clique-based pattern of political and economic
domination. Terrorism, as it appears, emanates from current
disagreements among conscious, local groups within the
society. The discrepancy is over the terms set for the socio-
economic-related distributions to the commons by the rul-
ing elite. The apparent problem here is that such
arrangements are somewhat skewed toward criminal and
violent patterns of negotiation. Dominant class-conscious-
ness is a political and theoretical concept common to most
societies and underlies progressive challenges to the order
of things. In Africa, the problem with this dominant strat-
egy is that it disproportionately opposes progress. So why
has there been a sudden upsurge in terrorist activities on the
continent in the last three decades? The most promising
answer could be that globalization and modern communi-
cation technology has created an awareness of the right to
liberty and the good life. Media displays of the irreverent
profligacy of the political class reduce belief in political
and governmental processes. Furthermore, as evidenced by
the Niger Delta and Somalian examples, socioeconomic
terrorism has proven to be very lucrative.
Conclusion and Recommendation
Africa's security threat to the West and to the world is a con-
cern pondered only rhetorically, albeit in contemporary,
international conversations. Indeed, in terms of threats, sub-
Saharan Africa has not merited an emergency call. The
causes of terrorist activities in sub-Saharan Africa--like
those in the Nigerian entanglement--which have been the
focus of this article, rely on a socioeconomic liberation ide-
ology. There is also the confrontation of contending political
and religious ideological issues in Africa and, unmistakably,
in the emergence of destructive sects like the Boko Haram.
Sub-SaharanAfrican terrorism relates to its continuing strug-
gle with resource expropriation and socioeconomic disorien-
tation. Whereas in the colonial past, the fight was against the
colonialists, today the colonialists are indigenous and have
formed partnerships with foreign multinationals. In defer-
ence to securitization theories on Africa, the continent may,
indeed, be potent, with occlusions to threaten the global sys-
tem if multilateral institutions and core national governments
continue to treat her like former British Prime Minister
Robert Blair's "scar on the conscience" of the world (see
Abrahamsen, 2005), rather than like a partner in healing its
attrition. Perhaps, unintended by African governments,
decades of leadership in nonpurposive malfeasance have cre-
ated a culture of coercive youth violence on multiple terror
fronts. African citizens have shown a unique quality of
patience and tolerance at the height of a clear sequence of
exploitation, starting from the European colonial period,
through to today, where postcolonial exploitation has contin-
ued, this time with local umpires. With the unending journey
to nationhood, there is a clear frustration on the part of youths
in many African states. Facing increasingly deteriorating
poverty levels, socioeconomic disorientation and the profli-
gacy of government, youths, who no longer trust the impar-
tiality and due process of organized governance to provide
equal and fair opportunity to improve their lives, choose per-
sonal socioeconomic liberation by any means possible. In so
doing, and at particular thresholds of national uncertainties,
enduring ancient communal and imported systems of politi-
cal aggression make those choices for them. The analogy of
the sociopolitical economy of postcolonial Nigeria does not
exonerate the subterfuge of local partnerships and acquisi-
tionists in these activities, but it does identify and explain it.
This is the pedagogical problem of a leadership class of
urban elites raised under postcolonial control, on a premise
of exploitation so beneficial and committing that it has
become a distinct culture, averse to the accepted norms of
accountability in governance, even as practiced in ordinary,
local villages. This class, because of its autochthonous legiti-
macy and its inability to negotiate the foreseeable backlash
of its subtle commission, appears more dangerous than the
colonialists. Clearly, the deviation to the criminality of the
terrorist form in sub-Saharan Africa involves both the state
and the dissident groups. The two groups are like business
12 SAGE Open
players with their eyes set on controlling the continent's
remaining natural resources. The fear is that these pockets of
terrorist activities may spread and become an accepted norm
for negotiating modern socioeconomic liberation. Unlike in
the Middle East, where there is broad public support and
sympathy for such activities, low community patronage in
sub-Saharan Africa relate to its ungrounded ideology.
Organizational theorists affirm that environments are prime
determining factors for organizational cultures (Wilson,
1968). The environments that created present governance
and bureaucratic structures in most nations on the African
continent were colonial in nature. Those structures persist,
whereas the environments from which they emerged have
long been extinct. This is a dilemma of governance in Africa,
and one in which nations like Nigeria have demonstrated,
repeatedly, their inability to help themselves. Without a
structural reformation of governance, management, and
administrative practices, throwing money at the plethora of
problems inherent in the majority of the states in the subcon-
tinent is an exercise in futility. Conflicts in sub-Saharan
Africa clearly reflect a response to poverty, social political
maladies, and a noticeable disequilibrium between govern-
ments and the environments in which they operate. Structural
changes are required in the articulation of the role of govern-
ment, as well as for citizens in finding lasting solutions to the
problem of terrorism in Africa. Improving social mobility
should be a public policy goal. Such a policy necessitates
giving greater attention to socioeconomic independence,
mass education, including vocational tutoring, and the eradi-
cation of social barriers, such as economic inequality, envi-
ronmental renewal, and gentrification. In summary, this
article maintains that the genesis of modern terrorism in
Africa is associated with governmental and corporate socio-
economic and environmental neglect, and with usurpation by
local elite leadership who live, vaingloriously, beyond the
means of their nation's economic capacities. The leadership
constraints of the elite that result into the vainglorious gover-
nance of African nation's demands critical research by schol-
ars with interest in the political and economic leadership and
on the idealogical basis of the new terrorism on the continent.
