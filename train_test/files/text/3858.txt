Abstract
Objective: In stored red blood cells (RBCs), which are used in diseases (e.g., acute blood loss
and leukaemia), storage lesions arise by oxidative stress and other factors over time. This study
investigated the protective effects of resveratrol and serotonin on stored RBCs.
Methods: Blood from each donor (n ¼ 10) was placed in different bags containing 70 mL
of citrate phosphate dextrose (total volume: 500 mL) and divided into three groups (n ¼ 30):
control, 60 mg/mL resveratrol, and 60 mg/mL serotonin. Malondialdehyde (MDA) and glutathione
(GSH) levels, activity of glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), catalase, and carbonic anhydrase (CA),
and susceptibility to oxidation in RBCs, and pH in whole blood were measured at baseline and on
days 7, 14, 21, and 28.
Results: MDA levels and susceptibility to oxidation were increased in all three groups time-
dependently, but this increase was greater in the serotonin group than in the other groups.
Activity of GSH-Px, CAT, and CA, as well as GSH levels, were decreased in the control and
serotonin groups time-dependently, but were significantly preserved in the resveratrol group.
The pH was decreased in all groups time-dependently.
Conclusion: Our study shows that resveratrol attenuates susceptibility to oxidation of RBCs
and protects their antioxidant capacity, and partially preserves CA activity time-dependently.

Introduction
Red blood cells (RBCs), which are used for
transfusion, can be stored for up to 6 weeks
at 2­6C under suitable conditions.1
However, morphological, biochemical, and
functional changes known as "storage
lesions" can arise in RBCs at the initial
stage of storage.2 Storage lesions negatively
affect the lifespan and efficiency of RBCs in
a time-dependent manner.3 The maximum
storage period and effectiveness of RBCs
depend on the content of their storage
medium and protective solutions.4 Various
preservative solutions have been developed
for minimizing storage lesions and prolong-
ing the lifespan of RBCs.5 The most
common combinations involve addition
of citrate phosphate dextrose (CPD), acid
citrate dextrose, citrate phosphate dextrose
adenine, and sorbitol glucose adenine man-
nitol.6­8 Although blood can be stored in
these solutions, storage lesions may devel-
op.3,5 Therefore, intensive studies have
aimed to increase the storage times of
RBCs. These studies reported that the
addition of various antioxidants, such as
vitamin E, vitamin C, b-carotene, melato-
nin, propofol, and tannic and caffeic
acids, as protective solutions had a positive
effect on the survival of RBCs.5,9,10
We hypothesize that the antioxidant
properties of resveratrol and serotonin
(phenolic compounds) 11,12 may benefit the
susceptibility to oxidation and antioxidant
capacity of RBCs in stored blood. This is
because reactive oxygen species (ROS),
such as hydroxyl radical (OHÀ), superoxide
anion radical (1O2
À), and hydrogen perox-
ide (H2
O2
), increase oxidative stress in a
time-dependent manner.10,13 ROS induce
oxidation in membrane lipids and proteins,
and antioxidants in the phenolic structure
can scavenge the factors that cause oxida-
tive stress.14,15 Therefore, the lifespan of
stored RBCs can be extended by reducing
oxidative stress.
Resveratrol is a natural compound that
acts on various intracellular messengers11
and is found in edible plant leaves and red
wine, as well as in fruits, such as mulberry,
grapes, and peanuts.16,17 Because of the
beneficial effects of resveratrol on humans,
resveratrol has become the focus of atten-
tion worldwide. Gu
¨ lc¸ in reported that
resveratrol inhibited peroxidation of a lino-
leic acid emulsion by 89.1% and was more
effective than standard antioxidants, such
as butylated hydroxyanisole, butylated hy-
droxytoluene, a-tocopherol, and Trolox.16
This author also demonstrated that resver-
atrol was effective for its 1,1-diphenyl
2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), 2,2'-Azino-bis
[3-ethyl benzo-thiazoline-6-sulfonic acid]

¨ lc¸ in
also reported that resveratrol exhibited ben-
eficial effects on cardiovascular diseases by
promoting vasodilatation and inhibiting
oxidative damage and platelet aggregation.16
Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine) is syn-
thesized in Drosophila by tryptophan-
phenylalanine hydroxylase activation,
which hydroxylates phenylalanine and tryp-
tophan.18 Serotonin is an important neuro-
transmitter that has several biological
roles.19 ABTSþ radical scavenging activity
and antioxidant properties of serotonin and
some of its derivatives have been tested.

resveratrol and serotonin are shown in
Figure 1.
In this study, we investigated the protec-
tive effects of resveratrol and serotonin on
lipid peroxidation and sensitivity to oxida-
tion of RBCs in stored blood. We aimed
to develop protective solutions and increase
the viability of RBCs. The effects of
resveratrol and serotonin on total carbonic
anhydrase (CA), catalase (CAT), and gluta-
thione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activity, as
well as reduced glutathione (GSH) levels
and pH, were also investigated.
Materials and methods
This study protocol was performed in ac-
cordance with the ethical rules in human
experiments in the context of the World
Medical Association Ethics Rules in the
Helsinki Declaration. For this study,
ethics committee approval was obtained
from the Yuzuncu Yil University Non-
Pharmaceutical Clinical Practices Local
Ethics Committee (REC number: 06/
13.08.2014). Before blood was taken, neces-
sary information was provided to the vol-
unteers of the study.
Resveratrol and serotonin were obtained
from Sigma Aldrich Company (St Louis,
MO, USA). Four-way paediatric bag sys-
tems connected to the main bag for blood
samples were purchased from Kansuk
(LOT:1104070; Kansuk, Istanbul, Turkey).
NADPH, molybdic acid, GSH, 1,1,3,3-tet-
raethoxy propane, methanol, ethanol,
hydrogen peroxide, and other chemicals
were obtained from Merck (Istanbul,
Turkey).
Obtaining blood samples from
volunteers and preparing for
measurements of parameters
Blood from each healthy volunteer (n ¼ 10)
was collected in four different paediatric
bag systems (Kansuk) containing 70 mL of
CPD at the Yuzuncu Yil University
Medical Faculty Blood Center. Blood was
transferred to three paediatric bags at-
tached to the main bag and categorized
into three groups (n ¼ 30). One group was
the control group; 60 mg/mL resveratrol
(resveratrol group) or 60 mg/mL serotonin
(serotonin group) was added to blood for
the other groups. Blood was stored at þ4C
in a blood bank during the study.
Blood samples (12 mL, n ¼ 30) were
taken from stored blood in each group at
1-week intervals (weeks 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4).
Measurement of pH was performed using
2 mL of whole blood. The remaining
10 mL of whole blood samples were centri-
fuged at 2500 Â g for 15 min and the plasma
was discarded. Upper leucocytes and other
impurities were carefully removed using a
dropper. An equal volume of isotonic solu-
tion was added to the underlying erythro-
cyte (RBC) solution and was slowly
overturned. The supernatant was discarded

after centrifugation at 2500 Â g. This proce-
dure was repeated three times and thorough
washing of the RBCs was achieved. The
susceptibility to oxidation of RBCs was
measured in an erythrocyte suspension
that was prepared in azide buffer solution.
The remaining RBC packages were haemo-
lysed with distilled ice water and frozen at
À80C until measurement of GSH levels,
and GSH-Px, CAT, and CA activity.
Haemoglobin measurement
in RBC packages
Haemolysate (20 mL) was added to a 5-mL
drabkin solution and incubated at room
temperature for 10 min. The absorbance
of the mixture was measured colourimetri-
cally on a spectrophotometer (Shimadzu
UV mini 1240; Korea, Japan) at 540 nm.
Haemoglobin concentrations are expressed
as g/dL.20
Measurement of MDA by
high-performance liquid
chromatography (HPLC)
Briefly, 250 mL thiobarbituric acid (42 mM),
750 mL H3
PO4
(0.44 M), and 450 mL distilled
water were added to the 50-mL RBC suspen-
sion in a test tube and the mixture was incu-
bated for 60 min in a boiling water bath
(total volume: 1.5 mL). After cooling in ice
water, the same volume of alkaline methanol
(50 mL methanolþ 4.5mL of 1 M NaOH)
(1/1 v/v) was added to the test tube and cen-
trifuged at 3000 Â g for 3 min. The superna-
tant (200 mL) was transferred to a vial and
injected into an HPLC apparatus (Agilent,
Boblingen, Germany). An RP-18 column
(150 Â4.6 mm) and 5 -lm particle size were
used. The mobile phase consisted of a mix-
ture of 400 mL of 50-mM phosphate buffer
(pH 6.8) and 600 mL of methanol (total
volume 1 L). The flow rate of the mobile
phase and the injection volume of samples
were set to 0.8 mL/min and 20 mL,
respectively. Measurements were made
against standard samples of different con-
centrations at an excitation wavelength of
527 nm and an emission wavelength of
551 nm.21 MDA levels are expressed as
nmol/gHb.
Determination of susceptibility
to oxidation of RBCs
The susceptibility to oxidation of RBCs
in vitro was determined using the method
of Stocks et al.21 The RBC suspension was
prepared with azide buffer. A volume of
5 mL of H2
O2
(0.03% concentration pre-
pared in buffered saline solution) was then
added to the same RBC suspension, and the
mixture was incubated for 2 h at 37C for
oxidation. After 2 h, MDA levels were mea-
sured on the HPLC apparatus,22 and the
haemoglobin concentration of the RBC
suspension was determined. MDA values
are expressed as nmol/gHb.
Measurement of GSH-Px activity in RBCs
Erythrocyte GSH-Px activity was deter-
mined using the method described by
Paglia and Valentin.23 In this method,
GSH reductase transforms oxidized GSH
to reduced GSH in the presence of
NADPH, accompanying the conversion of
NADPH to NADPþ. For this purpose, a
970-mL reaction mixture (mixture of Tris,
Na2
EDTA, GSH, NADPH, sodium azide,
and GSH reductase) was added to 20 mL of
sample and incubated for 5 min at 37C.
After incubation, 10 mL of H2
O2
solution
was added to initiate the reaction, and de-
creasing absorbance values were measured
at 340 nm at 30-s intervals for 3 min. GSH-
Px activity is expressed as IU/gHb.
Measurement of CAT activity in RBCs
CAT activity in RBCs was measured
according to the colourimetric method of
Goth.24 A volume of 1 mL of 65 lmol/mL
Huyut et al. 275
H2
O2
(prepared in phosphate buffer
0.06 M, pH of 7) was added to the 0.2-mL
RBC package. After 1 min, 1 mL of ammo-
nium molybdate solution (32.4 mmol/L)
was added to the test tube to terminate
the reaction. Absorbance of the yellow
complex formed by molybdate and H2
O2
was measured spectrophotometrically at
405 nm on a spectrophotometer (Shimadzu
UV mini 1240). CAT activity is reported as
kU/gHb.
Measurement of reduced GSH in RBCs
GSH values in RBCs were measured spec-
trophotometrically according to the method
of Fairbanks and Klee.25 The non-protein
sulfhydryl groups in RBCs are normally in
the form of reduced GSH. DTNB, a disul-
phide chromogen, is reduced to a yellow
compound by the sulfhydryl groups of the
GSH in RBCs. Absorbance of the reduced
chromogen shows maximum absorbance at
412 nm. The concentration of this complex
is directly proportional to the GSH concen-
tration. Although the DTNB method meas-
ures all free sulfhydryl groups (protein-
bound or protein unbound), the sulfhydryl
groups are thought to reflect the GSH
value in RBCs because GSH levels are
high in RBCs. GSH values are expressed
as mg/gHb.
Determination of total CA activity in RBCs
Total CA activity in RBCs was measured
using the method described Rickly et al.26
and modified by Wilbur and Anderson.27
Purified water (0.55 mL), bromothymol
blue (0.1 mL, 0.04%), and haemolysate
(50 mL enzyme solution) were added to
tubes containing 1 mL of veronal buffer
(0.025 M, pH of 8.2). The elapsed time for
the conversion from the blue colour of the
indicator to the yellowish-green (pH 6.8)
colour was determined by addition of
2.5 mL of CO2
solution (total volume:
4.2 mL) as the substrate (tc
). As a reference
measurement, we used the elapsed time for
the colour change using distilled water in-
stead of haemolysate (t0
). CA activity
(CO2
Àhydratase activity) was calculated
using the (t0
À tc
)/tc
equation28,29 and is
expressed as U/gHb.
Measurement of pH
Values of pH were measured with a commer-
cially purchased blood gas kit (ABL90
FLEX PLUS, Radiometer, Denmark) on
an ABL 90 apparatus (Radiometer Medical
Materials Industry and Trade Ltd. Inc.,
Istanbul, Turkey).
Statistical analyses
Descriptive statistics for continuous varia-
bles are expressed as the mean and standard
deviation. Following analysis of variance,
Duncan's multiple comparison test was
used for inter-group comparison within
the same week and for intra-group compar-
ison between weeks. Statistical significance
was considered at 5% (p < 0.05). The SPSS
15 statistical package program (Chicago,
IL, USA) was used for calculations.
Results
Volunteers involved in the study (n ¼ 10)
were people who had lived in Van city
centre in Turkey for at least 2 years. Four
of the volunteers were Kurdish and six of
them were of Turkish origin. Volunteers
were healthy men between the ages of 21
and 25.
MDA levels in RBCs in all of the groups
increased in a time-dependent manner
(p < 0.05). However, this increase was
greater in the serotonin group from week
3 onwards (on days 14, 21, and 28) com-
pared with the other groups (p < 0.05)
(Figure 2). We also tested the susceptibility
of RBCs to oxidation in vitro. Two hours
after in vitro oxidation with H2
O2
(0.03%),

MDA levels were increased in all groups in
a time-dependent manner during 5 weeks.
However, after in vitro oxidation, MDA
levels in the resveratrol group were signifi-
cantly lower than those in the other groups
on days 14, 21, and 28 (p < 0.05). After in
vitro oxidation with H2
O2
, MDA values on
days 21 and 28 in the serotonin group were
significantly higher than those in the con-
trol and resveratrol groups (p < 0.05)
(Figure 2).
We also compared changes in GSH-Px
and CAT activity and levels of GSH,
which function as antioxidants in RBCs,
over time. GSH-Px and CAT activity, as
well as GSH levels, were decreased in the
control and serotonin groups, but were sig-
nificantly preserved in the resveratrol group
in a time-dependent manner (p < 0.001).
GSH-Px and CAT activity, as well as
GSH levels, in the resveratrol group were
also significantly higher than those in
the other groups on days 21 and 28
(p < 0.001) (Figure 3). However, GSH-Px
and CAT activity, as well as GSH levels,
did not significantly change in the serotonin
group, and were similar to those of the con-
trol group.
We further examined the change in CA
activity, which provides pH and ionic bal-
ance in RBCs over time. CA enzyme activ-
ity in all of the groups was decreased in

dependent manner (p < 0.001). However,
CA activity of the resveratrol group was
significantly higher than that in the other
groups on days 21 and 28 (p < 0.05)
(Figure 4).
We investigated changes in pH and
pCO2
in stored whole blood in association
with CA time-dependently. We found that
pH was decreased in all groups time-
dependently (p < 0.05). However, pH
values on day 28 in the resveratrol group
were partially preserved according to the
control group, although this was not signif-
icant (Figure 4). Additionally, pCO2
values
rapidly increased during the first 3 weeks,
and then began to fall (p < 0.05). However,
pCO2
values in the resveratrol group were
lower than those in the other groups on day
28 (p < 0.05) (Figure 4).
Discussion
We investigated the effects of resveratrol and
serotonin on antioxidant defence status and
oxidative alterations that distort the physio-
logical functions of RBCs. We also exam-
ined their protective effects on CA enzyme
activity, which plays important roles, such
as pH and ion balance in the body.
Storage lesions are defined as changes
that result in irreversible damage and
decrease post-transfusion survival of blood
or RBCs.30 The most obvious changes that
affect RBCs during storage are an increase
in lipid peroxidation levels and a decrease in
the activity of enzymes that play a role in
the antioxidant defence system, such as
superoxide dismutase (SOD), CAT, and
GSH-Px. Additionally, there are haemo-
rheological changes, such as an increase in
RBC sphere membrane deformation and
mean Hb concentrations, and osmotic
fragility.30,31
Most irreversible events occur as a result
of long-term oxidative stress under non-
physiological storage conditions. One of
the most important reasons for an increase
in oxidative stress is decreased antioxidant
capacity of RBCs or stored blood.32 ROS,
which result from increasing oxidative
stress in stored RBCs, lead to impaired
membrane integrity and cell death by
attacking lipids and proteins in mem-
branes.30 Therefore, cells possess enzymatic
or non-enzymatic antioxidant defence
mechanisms against this situation.31,32
However, researchers have suggested that
these negative changes occur even if stored
RBCs or blood are maintained under suit-
able conditions. Various studies have been

performed on stored blood to decrease the
observed negative changes in a time-
dependent manner and to increase the life-
span of RBCs.5,6,32,33
Dumaswala et al.34 showed that an in-
creasing concentration of GSH in stored
blood protected RBCs against free radical
damage. Additionally, numerous studies
have shown that lipid peroxidation is atten-
uated by the addition of metal chelators
and antioxidant substances to stored
blood or RBCs.32,35,36 Before blood is
taken, donors are provided various antiox-
idant preparations in their diet. Racek
et al.37 showed that stored blood was
more resistant to free radical damage if var-
ious antioxidant tablets were provided to
volunteers before blood collection.
Melatonin is one of the strongest antiox-
idants.38 Allegra et al.38 demonstrated that
erythrocyte membrane proteins and lipids
increased the susceptibility to oxidation
with a cytotoxic effect of MDA in vitro.
However, addition of melatonin to stored
blood resulted in a protective effect of
RBCs against these adverse events.
Sekeroglu et al.5 found that addition of
melatonin to stored blood significantly
preserved the levels of erythrocyte MDA,
glutathione, GSH-Px, and SOD in a time-
dependent manner. In previous studies,
MDA levels in erythrocytes increased in a
time-dependent manner.5,9,39 Our study
showed that MDA levels increased in
RBCs in a time-dependent manner, consis-
tent with these previous studies. We also
tested the susceptibility of RBCs to oxida-
tion in vitro. The susceptibility to oxidation
of RBCs was increased under conditions
of oxidative stress by addition of H2
O2
over time. This result supports the hypothe-
sis that some changes occur in RBC mem-
branes because of oxidative damage
during the waiting period and that RBCs
become less stable. In our study, resveratrol
added to stored blood significantly preserved
the susceptibility to oxidation of RBCs
compared with the control group.
However, serotonin showed an adverse
effect.
In addition to the endogenous antioxi-
dant systems that play a protective role
against oxidative stress in RBCs, there
are other factors, such as SOD, GSH-Px,
CAT and GSH.30,31 GSH-Px acts as the
primary antioxidant defence system and
performs decomposition of H2
O2
at high
H2
O2
concentrations.40 CAT completes
the detoxification reaction of H2
O2
initiated
by SOD to H2
O and O2
.41 CAT activity is
initially low and increases with storage
time.5,32 This situation may be due to activ-
ity of GSH-Px that scavenges H2
O2
at low
H2
O2
concentrations. Previous studies have
shown that an increasing storage time
decreases GSH-Px activity.5,31 Our study
suggested that GSH-Px activity in RBCs
was attenuated with increasing storage
time, in accordance with previous stud-
ies.5,31 However, addition of resveratrol
and serotonin to stored blood increased
GSH-Px activity in RBCs during the first
2 weeks and significantly protected RBC
in the following weeks compared with the
control group.
CAT and NADPH protect RBCs against
acute and high exogenous H2
O2
levels,
while GSH protects RBCs against endoge-
nously produced low H2
O2
levels.42 In a
previous study conducted by our group,
CAT activity and GSH levels increased
during the first 2 weeks and decreased in
the following weeks.5,32 Our current study
showed that CAT levels in the resveratrol
and serotonin groups increased during the
first 3 weeks and were then attenuated in
the following weeks, consistent with previ-
ous studies.5,31,32 However, when we exam-
ined total CAT levels at the end of day 28,
CAT levels in the control and serotonin
groups were significantly lower compared
with the resveratrol group. Additionally,
similar changes in GSH and CAT levels
showed a significant association between
Huyut et al. 279
these two parameters. The higher levels of
CAT and GSH in the resveratrol group on
days 21and 28 may be due to the antioxi-
dant properties of resveratrol.
CAs (carbonate hydrolase, EC 4.2.1.1)
represent a large family of Zn-containing
enzymes.43 A total of 16 different CA iso-
enzymes have been identified in mam-
mals.44,45 In various tissues, different CA
isoenzymes participate in many important
biological processes, such as respiration,
gas balance, calcification, photosynthesis,
bone resorption, lipid synthesis, urea
synthesis, glucose synthesis, body fluid
exchange, tumour cell growth, electrolyte
release, CO2
and ion transport, and acid-
base balance by regulating pH in the
eye and inner ear.46,47 CAs contribute to
pH balance in the human body and other
tissues by catalysing two steps: providing
Hþ and HCO3
À with hydration of CO2
and converting HCO3
À to CO2
in acidic
medium.48 CA activity is important because
a drop in pH has a negative effect on stored
RBCs.32 There have been few studies on
stored blood or RBCs concerning how CA
activity changes over time. In a previous
study carried out by our group, CA activity
decreased in a time-dependent manner.32 In
the current study, CA activity was attenu-
ated in a time-dependent manner, similar to
our previous study.32 The decrease in CA
enzyme activity over time may be due to a
loss of function of proteins depending on
the elapsed time, as in other enzymes.
However, resveratrol may protect stored
blood and RBCs against time-related acido-
sis, as indicated by the partially preserved
CA activity, and pH and pCO2
values on
days 21 and 28 in the resveratrol group. In
our previous study, resveratrol (30 mg/mL)
significantly preserved the change in pH in
stored RBCs.29 We believe that the reason
why resveratrol did not exhibit a protective
effect on the change in pH in this study may
be because resveratrol was used at a higher
dose (60 mg/mL).
Conclusions
Our study shows that the antioxidant capac-
ity of RBCs is attenuated because of their
increasing susceptibility to oxidation and
decrease in GSH levels, and GSH-Px and
CAT activity, in a time-dependent manner.
Furthermore, the decrease in GSH-Px and
CAT activity and GSH levels in RBCs is
negatively associated with CA enzyme activ-
ity and antioxidant capacity with susceptibil-
ity to oxidation over time. However,
addition of resveratrol to stored blood pro-
tects their antioxidant capacity and partially
preserves CA enzyme activity and pH and
pCO2
levels by decreasing the susceptibility
to oxidation of RBCs. For this reason, low
concentrations of resveratrol that are added
to stored blood may positively contribute to
the shelf life of stored RBCs. However, the
dose of resveratrol that should be added to
stored blood or RBCs must be adjusted ac-
cordingly. More detailed studies are required
to determine the mechanism by which sero-
tonin increases the susceptibility to
oxidation.
