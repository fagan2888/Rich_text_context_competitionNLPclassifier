Abstract: Thirty years ago, Trivers and Willard (1973) hypothesized that parental
"condition" could be central in influencing the sex ratio of offspring, "good
condition" being associated with the conception of males. However, I argue that
"condition" is a distraction in this otherwise useful hypothesis, because it is
merely a frequent indicator of dominance (a characteristic which often leads to
priority access to resources); and that it is dominance, a biologically-based
characteristic underpinned by testosterone, which is of interest. Shifting the
focus from good condition to the dominance-testosterone link could help explain
otherwise anomalous findings in the literature on the sex ratio. In addition, in
female mammals, testosterone is hypothesized to have a role in reproductive
processes such that the mother could influence or even control the sex of her
offspring, conceiving whichever sex she is, at that time, and in that place, best
suited to raise. Such a mechanism would confer an evolutionary advantage on
those females able to make use of it.

Introduction
Thirty years ago Science published Trivers and Willard's paper "Natural
selection of parental ability to vary the sex ratio of offspring" (1973). In it they
argued that reproductive success should be enhanced in parents who could
manipulate the sex of their offspring according to their condition. Noting that a
male's reproductive success may potentially vary far more widely than a female's,
The maternal dominance hypothesis: questioning Trivers and Willard
Trivers and Willard argued that it would therefore pay females in "good
condition" to produce male offspring and conversely, females in "poor condition",
female offspring. Providing that good condition was transferred to the offspring,
and providing that such good condition was sustained into adulthood, a female
who could bias the sex ratio would be more reproductively successful than a
female who could not. The condition of females thus became a key factor in
attempts to explain variations in the sex ratio of the offspring they produced.
Doubts were expressed about the plausibility of this hypothesis shortly after
publication. For example Myers (1978) showed through computerized
mathematical modeling that the hypothesis did not, and could not, hold for all
circumstances. Nevertheless the Trivers and Willard hypothesis has provided the
theoretical framework for almost all studies of the sex ratio in the last thirty years.
It is only recently that sustained criticisms of it have been published.
For example, Leimar (1996), examining lifetime reproductive success, showed
that in some circumstances, "high quality" females can have higher reproductive
value than high quality males, in direct contrast to the Trivers and Willard
prediction. Five years later, in a thorough investigation of the primate literature
on sex ratios Brown (2001) found "a lack of correlation between maternal
condition, birth sex ratios and maternal care". Then Brown and Silk (2002)
reported on a meta-analysis of all primate studies of the sex ratio which, largely
because of conflicting results, found no overall difference in the sex ratio of
offspring of high and low status mothers.
In studies of humans, it could be suggested that one reason for inconsistent
results is that there is little consensus on what constitutes "parental investment".
For example, Keller et al (2001) found no support for the suggestion that higher
status parents would invest more in their sons, and lower status parents more in
their daughters. But their measure of parental investment consisted of "time
diaries" and "self-report data", whereas, in contrast, Koziel and Ulijaszek (2001)
found limited support for the Trivers and Willard hypothesis using "first birth
interval and extent of breastfeeding" as their measures of parental investment.
In an attempt to resolve the problems, Bercovitch (2002) described three
possible models in which parental investment might be related to sex-biases in
primate offspring, but came to the conclusion that testing the models would be
very difficult, and that, in any event, no single model would be likely to apply to
all primates. West and Sheldon (2002) however argued that parents "should"
adjust the sex of their offspring according to conditions in the environment and
further that "parental ability to predict their offsprings' environment influences
the evolution of sex ratio patterns across taxa". Thus on the one hand, there has
been an increase in the number of authors describing difficulties in sustaining the
Trivers and Willard hypothesis; yet on the other, further evidence from a large
variety of species, that manipulation of the sex ratio by parents seems to be a
fundamental part of successful reproductive strategies.

The maternal dominance hypothesis: questioning Trivers and Willard
The problem
In illustrating their original hypothesis Trivers and Willard used a population
of caribou as an example. A male caribou in good condition would "tend to
exclude other males from breeding, thereby inseminating many more females
themselves, while females in good condition, through their greater ability to
invest in their young, [would] show only a moderate increase in reproductive
success" (Trivers and Willard, 1973). Even a small advantage in a male's
condition could make a very large difference to his reproductive success. Thus,
"females in better condition tend to invest in males. Adverse environmental
conditions for the mother during pregnancy are correlated with a reduced sex ratio
at birth in deer and humans" (Trivers and Willard, 1973).
The prediction that "adverse environmental conditions" would give rise to
more female offspring "in deer and in humans" ran directly counter to the
accepted tradition in sex ratio studies in both species. In humans it ran up against
the now fully supported, uncontroversial finding of raised sex ratios during and
immediately following war (McMahon and Pugh, 1954). In deer it ran into
conflict both with reports from nineteenth century breeding trials, and
contemporary wildlife experiments. In one, a longitudinal, controlled cross-over
field trial, deer had more male offspring if they were in poor condition (Verme,
1969).
However, more recent reports appeared to confirm the Trivers and Willard
hypothesis. In one, a naturalistic longitudinal study conducted on the Island of
Rhum, deer had more male offspring if they were in good condition (Clutton-
Brock et al, 1984). In another, it was shown that high status humans, presumed to
be in good condition, had an excess of sons (Teitelbaum and Mantel, 1971).
Both studies appeared to confirm the Trivers and Willard hypothesis. All the
studies were methodologically sound, and their conflicting results invited closer
inspection. In fact, two papers (Verme, 1983; McGinley, 1984) were published
suggesting an adaptive advantage in male-biased sex ratios in adverse
environments, but neither of these precipitated a discussion of the anomalies.
The maternal dominance hypothesis suggests a resolution for the apparently
conflicting results, namely that the association between dominance and good
condition, although clearly legitimate in many circumstances, is likely to be a
spurious one from the point of view of sex ratio adjustment. Although dominance
may lead to good condition in most settings, its key attribute vis-à-vis sex ratio
adjustment is that it is underpinned by testosterone, and it is this which effects the
sex ratio, not condition, good or otherwise. Therefore, although both hypotheses
predict the same (dominant animals have male-biased sex ratios) in normal (i.e.
non-stressful) conditions, they do not predict the same for adverse conditions.
As West et al (2002) have pointed out, the problem of sex determination in
vertebrates (and certainly in mammals) is more likely to be solved by further

The maternal dominance hypothesis: questioning Trivers and Willard
investigation of the way in which "individuals facultatively adjust their offspring
sex ratios in response to environmental conditions (rather than population sex
ratios)". As they note, "birds consistently adjust their offspring sex ratios in the
direction predicted by theory", providing "strong evidence that even in
vertebrates, CSD (chromosomal sex determination) is not an all-powerful
constraint that prevents adaptive sex ratio manipulation" (West et al, 2002).
Having shown that sex ratio adjustment appears very strongly in some organisms
(for example ants, bees and wasps) and quite strongly in others (for example
birds) these authors are primarily concerned with the question why there appear to
be such wide differences across the taxa in the overall amount of sex ratio
adjustment. This puzzle particularly applies to those species with chromosomal
sex determination, where any form of adaptive sex ratio variation has proved hard
to demonstrate. The results of studies on variations in the secondary sex ratio in
mammals (many of which have cited the Trivers and Willard hypothesis as the
theoretical context) have been inconsistent to the point that some authors have
said that reports of statistically significant findings were nothing but the result of
sampling error (Small and Smith, 1985). However the maternal dominance
hypothesis provides a way of reconciling these alleged inconsistencies, mainly by
postulating a hypothetical mechanism by which the mammalian mother could
either predetermine, or at least partially control the sex of her offspring.
In the absence of knowledge of a proximate mechanism of sex determination
(other than chance) a test of the competing hypotheses (Trivers and Willard
versus the maternal dominance hypothesis) occurs in the context of adverse
environmental conditions. In the presence of such adverse conditions, the Trivers
and Willard hypothesis predicts female-biased sex ratios, and the maternal
dominance hypothesis predicts male-biased sex ratios.
The maternal dominance hypothesis
The maternal dominance hypothesis arose from research in human females
which showed that women more dominant in personality than other women are
more likely to conceive male infants (Grant, 1994). Later, following evidence
which showed that serum testosterone is correlated with dominance behaviours in
male animals (Rose et al, 1971) and humans (Mazur and Booth, 1998) it was
shown that serum testosterone in human females is significantly correlated with
scores on a psychometric instrument designed to measure dominance (Grant and
France, 2001). Thus, the presence of above average serum testosterone in a
human female suggests both above average dominant behaviour and an increased
likelihood of conceiving a male infant.
Based on observations beginning in the mid 1960s, and formally proposed in
1990 (Grant, 1990), this hypothesis appeared to run counter to the accepted truth
that the sex of the infant in humans is determined by mere chance, depending on

whether an X- or a Y-chromosome-bearing spermatozoon happens to fertilize the
ovum. The maternal dominance hypothesis, while recognizing the basic,
indispensable function of X- and Y-chromosome -bearing spermatozoa,
introduced the possibility of an additional component into the process of
fertilization, namely some kind of discriminatory role for the mammalian mother,
such that she could give an advantage to either an X- or a Y-chromosome-bearing
spermatozoon, depending on which sex offspring she is, at that time, and in that
place, more suited to raise.
The phrase "more suited to raise" refers to a multi-layered environmental,
physiological and psychological suitability. Since mammalian testosterone levels
have been shown to be responsive to environmental influences (Mazur and Booth,
1998; Rose et al, 1971; Gray, 1992; Kemper, 1990), environmental contingencies
may contribute to an adaptive response about which sex offspring to conceive.
Maternal psychoneuroendocrinology must play a role in interpreting the
conditions, and varying the level of testosterone in accordance with these factors.
Thus conditions in the environment could influence the individual female's level
of serum testosterone in each breeding season, or estrus or menstrual cycle. These
differing levels could, in turn, differentially influence various mechanisms or
pathways within the reproductive tract of the female. Several possible
mechanisms have already been described (Eberhard, 1996). They include
selection and development of the ovum within the follicle (Haning et al, 1993),
timing of ovulation in relation to the length of the follicular phase (Weinberg et
al, 1995), timing of conception within the menstrual or estrus cycle (Guerrero,
1974), and /or sex-specific embryonic mortality (Krackow, 1995). All of these
are influenced by maternal hormone levels.
Thus female testosterone, already shown in some settings to be attuned and
responsive to environmental influences, is hypothesized to be working in
synchrony with maternal reproductive physiology to ensure that the sex of the
offspring conceived is optimal to both maternal characteristics and environmental
conditions. Physiologically, maternal testosterone levels are likely to be
differentially suited to the development and growth of a male or a female embryo
and fetus. Behaviourally, at least in humans and rats, it seems likely that maternal
testosterone underpins small, but important qualitative differences in maternal-
neonate interactions according to the sex of the infant/offspring. Such
interactions tend to set the overall direction of development. In humans, mothers
of female infants are more responsive to their babies than mothers of male infants
(Grant, 1994). They respond to their infants' vocalizations and movements by
repeating them, thus providing very early experience of the synchronization of
interpersonal interaction. Mothers of male infants appear to stimulate their babies
more than the mothers of female infants. Mothers of male babies have been
shown to hold their infants upright by the trunk, to arouse them and to initiate or
provoke behaviours in them. Mothers of rats have been shown to stimulate male

neonates significantly more frequently than their female littermates (Beyer and
Feder, 1987). Adaptively speaking, both the physiological and the psychological
maternal differences appear to work in tandem to ensure the optimal development
of the particular sex of offspring conceived.
Under normal conditions, dominance and serum testosterone (both normally
distributed) are likely to be highly correlated. Females that have more of both
will be likely to conceive male offspring and to raise them successfully. Females
that have less of both will be more likely to conceive and raise reproductively
successful female offspring. Testosterone fluctuates over time, according to
environmental conditions both physical and psychological (Gray, 1992). Suppose
individual females are born with genetically imposed limits in their ability to
manufacture testosterone. Each female's testosterone levels will fluctuate over a
given range. Those with genetically low testosterone will fluctuate within a lower
range and produce mainly female offspring; those with genetically high
testosterone will fluctuate within a higher range and conceive mostly male
offspring. Most will fluctuate within the medium range, tipping either side of an
hypothesized critical threshold and produce offspring of both sexes.
Responsiveness to the environment
What sorts of conditions cause fluctuations in serum testosterone? In the
female, anything that causes chronic stress will tend to raise an individual's serum
testosterone levels (Gray, 1992). Female medical students, in the months building
up to examinations, had higher testosterone levels than normal (Grant and France,
2001). Chronic hardship or stress, (as in food shortages, war or epidemic) appears
to increase testosterone levels in many females, thus temporarily raising the
number of females suited to conceiving male offspring. (This is in contrast to
acute stress, as in earthquake, flood, or sudden bereavement, which appears to
have the opposite effect, resulting in a lowered sex ratio nine months later, see for
example Hansen et al, 1999.)
The relationship between chronic stress and raised testosterone levels in the
mammalian female could be doubly adaptive. First the individual female
(mother) enduring chronic stress would be slightly toughened to help withstand
the stress; and secondly, there would be fewer females in the next generation, thus
possibly protecting the habitat from excess population growth. Verme (1983)
reviewed all studies on deer sex ratios and concluded that "an increase in the
proportion of male fawns as range conditions deteriorated would serve as a
population self-regulating mechanism". He came in for severe criticism for this,
because his suggestion implied support for the controversial group selection
theory. But the facts could equally well be explained by postulating the
individual's reactions to reduced food, which had the effect of raising that
individual's testosterone levels.

The maternal dominance hypothesis: questioning Trivers and Willard
Adaptive manipulation of sex ratios by individuals could result in collateral
benefit to a group, in just the same way as say, lack of water could cause kidney
damage in some individuals, who then died, leaving more water for those that
remained. This too might look like group selection, but it is not; those individuals
with more efficient kidneys survived and the others did not. The problem of
misattribution of group selection charges could be solved by reference to shared
physiological mechanisms adapted in each individual to a greater or lesser extent,
to solve the same problems.
In times of plenty and low stress, individual female serum testosterone levels
would tend to drop allowing for more females to conceive female offspring. This
too may be advantageous in that it would provide the vehicle for population
expansion in times of plenty, and good conditions in which to produce and rear
healthy females who may continue to be successful breeders and enhance their
species, thus taking optimum advantage of the good conditions.
For a female mammal to adjust the sex ratio of her offspring in accordance
with her perception of the environment there would need to be two related
mechanisms in place. First, there would need to be a physiological mechanism by
which a female was able to react sensitively to stress-inducing changes in the
environment. Secondly, there would need to be a relationship between this
mechanism and the mechanism by which the sex of her offspring was determined
(or pre-determined). Both these mechanisms would need to react within the time
scale of her estrus or menstrual cycle.
The maternal dominance hypothesis offers serum testosterone as a primary
candidate. It is known that serum testosterone in males, both animal and human,
can vary dramatically over time, according to the male's perception of changes in
his social and physical environments (Kemper, 1990). There is also evidence to
show that, unlike the male, female testosterone rises in response to (perceived)
chronic stress. Female testosterone is also related to self-reported dominance
(Grant and France,2001).
Resolving existing problems
Postulating such a mechanism would help reconcile the studies (cited at the
beginning of this article) of sex ratio variation in humans and in deer. It would
solve many problems, from the rise in the number of human male births following
war (MacMahon and Pugh, 1954), hardship (Martin, 1994) or disease (Lloyd et al,
1984) to distorted sex ratios in other primates (Meikle et al, 1984), ungulates
(Cameron et al, 1999) and other mammals (Meikle et al 1993; Wiley and
Clapham, 1993). There is already persuasive evidence to suggest a connection
between maternal testosterone and offspring sex ratio in birds (Sheldon, 1999).
Consistent findings on mammalian sex ratios may emerge when "good
condition" is seen for what it is - a frequently occurring, but nevertheless

The maternal dominance hypothesis: questioning Trivers and Willard
spurious correlate of dominance and high status. Although all three descriptors ­
good condition, dominance and high status occur frequently in conjunction with
one another, and look intuitively as though they should be connected, their co-
occurrences are not logically necessary. An animal may be in good condition
without being dominant and/or without having high status. In a group of animals
in poor condition, some will still be dominant.
And in some settings high status animals are not necessarily the most
dominant, for example when factors such as age, health and time of joining the
group are major contributors to status. Although of signal importance in itself,
even the characteristic dominance must be seen as a by-product of serum
testosterone. For primatologists, who scarcely ever concern themselves with
proximate mechanisms, this may seem limiting; however it has the advantage of
being potentially falsifiable, and it minimizes the need for ingenious, but
nevertheless speculative explanations of sex ratio variation.
Assuming similar physiological mechanisms for reproduction in female
humans and other primates, it may also be possible to reconcile otherwise
seemingly incompatible results in methodologically good research. For example,
if female testosterone (not dominance or good condition) is the key, two different
studies of rhesus monkeys which seemed to show contradictory results, may
instead, demonstrate the workings of the hypothesized maternal dominance-
testosterone link. In the first study, dominant, high status rhesus monkey mothers
living in captivity gave birth to a significant number of female offspring (Simpson
and Simpson, 1982). For these females living conditions were almost stress-free.
Many, if not most, were born in captivity, and thus did not have a stressful
adjustment to make to living in cages. There was always plenty of food and their
sustained high status meant they had priority access to whatever was desirable.
This comfortable lifestyle required little or no effort, and certainly no stress.
Therefore testosterone levels were likely to be low and these high status females
gave birth to daughters. For lower status females, life was (comparatively) more
difficult. At best, they had to await their turn at the food hoppers and not get in
the way of their superiors. At worst they were severely harassed. These females
conceived more male offspring, which may have been a consequence of having
higher stress-induced serum testosterone levels.
In the second study (Meikle et al, 1984), the quality of the environment was
extremely harsh and the birth sex ratios the opposite of those born to the caged
mothers. Here the high status, dominant females had more male offspring, and
the low status mothers, more female offspring. These rhesus monkeys lived on an
island on which there was intense competition for life-sustaining food supplies
and water. Those adult females that were born with (genetically) higher levels of
serum testosterone (than the other females) were able to fight that bit harder for
access to supplies. Although all were in poor condition, the higher testosterone
females were slightly better off in both condition and status. Those females had
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 1. 2003. 103
The maternal dominance hypothesis: questioning Trivers and Willard
more male offspring, whereas the low testosterone females, who had less success
in the fights over food, were in poorer condition and had lower status, conceived
female offspring, and fewer of them. As the harsh conditions continued, even
those female infants that survived birth did not necessarily reach adulthood.
Adaptively, such sequences result in falling populations and allow time for the
habitat to be restored. When it is, there is less competition for food, lower stress-
induced testosterone in the females and more likelihood of normal, or even below
normal sex ratios in the offspring.
In this way natural selection could be shown to favour maternal ability to
adjust the sex ratio of her offspring according to her circumstances, her
"circumstances" being those environmental as well as genetic factors which give
rise to both her physiological and her psychological condition at the time of
conception. Such a re-conceptualization could provide the "single unifying
framework ... required to explain variation in the extent to which different species
adjust their offspring sex ratio" (West and Sheldon, 2002).
For a maternal sex-determining mechanism to have benefits greater than its
costs, it would need to operate early and efficiently in the reproductive pathway.
The most parsimonious point, the one with least waste and most efficiency, would
be immediately prior to conception. The most efficient and timely mechanism for
sex determination at this point in the reproductive pathway would perhaps be by
selection and development of an ovum already adapted to receive an X- or a Y-
chromosome-bearing spermatozoon. This would give the opportunity for the
female to take a perfectly timed reading of both her internal and external
environments and select and develop the ovum accordingly. Given that, in
mammals, the female's contribution to reproduction is overwhelmingly greater
than the male's, it may make sense for her to be the one to determine whether the
offspring should be male or female.
Awesomely adaptive systems for ensuring appropriate sex ratios appear to be
in place right across the taxa, from the haplodiploid species to those species with
chromosomal sex determination (West et al, 2002). It may be that a very finely
tuned or titrated system resting on both genetic potential and reactivity to
environmental conditions of the female's serum testosterone forms the basis of a
proximate mechanism of sex pre-determination that keeps even mammalian sex
ratios perfectly in balance with environmental contingencies.
