Abstract
In a world where attitudes towards immigration and the European Union are at the
forefront of political and economic agendas across the continent, this Special Issue is
highly relevant and well timed. This Forum article reviews the Special Issue and sum-
marizes lessons learned and identifies open, remaining and new, questions. As a future
research agenda, it is advised to pay attention to (a) differentiation in EU attitudes, (b)
the role of national political elites, (c) the changing communications environment, and
(d) the role of religion and religious attitudes.
Keywords
EU attitudes, anti-immigration, religion, radical right voting
Introduction
The relationship between attitudes towards immigrants and attitudes towards the
European Union is rightfully experiencing a (new) wave of social and scholarly
attention. The proposition that citizens who hold anti-immigration attitudes are
also more likely to be critical against the EU and European integration is not new
(see e.g. de Vreese and Boomgaarden, 2005; McLaren, 2002). But recent real world

developments ­ both relating to immigration flows and to developments in the EU
itself ­ has made revisiting this topic urgent, both socially and theoretically.
The Special Issue developed and edited by Kentmen-Cin and Erisen is very
timely and includes a fine selection of articles from good scholars with various
disciplinary backgrounds, university affiliations, and track records. In this invited
Forum piece, I first highlight the main findings from each contribution in order to
ask what we have collectively learned and what we might still need to know.
Special Issue Review
The Issue is opened by the editors, Kentmen-Cin and Erisen (2017). They cut right
to the core of the Special Issue with their overview and critical assessment of
previous scholarship of the relationship between anti-immigration attitudes and
anti-EU attitudes. They make two important recommendations: first, that scholars
employ a broader variety of methods and designs when trying to disentangle these
relationships, and second, that scholars differentiate more between groups within
larger immigrant populations. While it is hard to disagree with the first recommen-
dation which is likely to make the empirical base stronger and open for more
nuance, the latter recommendation is important and noteworthy, because it sug-
gests a shift away from a more logic pursued in previous studies where citizens'
general tendency to categorize others as out-groups, ceteris paribus, was leading
(e.g. Sniderman et al., 2000). They reiterate the more general point that attitudes
toward immigrants are a key explanatory factor in analyses of support or oppos-
ition for European integration. But they suggest that `there is a need to redesign
existing survey questions to identify the specific cultural and economic threats
posed by immigrants and the nature of public interaction with them'. Two obser-
vations are in place here: It is hard not be to in favor of the unpacking and
disentangling threat perceptions. That said, this claim also puts the burden on
them and likeminded scholars to provide solid, systematic, empirical evidence to
show not only that differences matter but also that catch all measures perform sub-
optimally. In the absence of such evidence, some might still be led to believe that
general threat perceptions and general out-group categorizations are most
informative.
The second article, by Azrout and Wojcieszak (2017), takes on one of the open-
ing article's recommendation in their specific example of how anti-immigrant sen-
timents influence attitudes toward the European Union. They show how EU
attitudes are predicted by attitudes toward specific immigrant groups that are sali-
ent to specific EU policies. They look at attitudes toward two distinct immigrant
groups, Muslims and Poles, in relation to two different policy dimensions, the
strengthening of EU integration and potential Turkish EU membership. The
authors first corroborate extant research, showing that anti-immigrant attitudes
indeed explain opposition toward both further integration and Turkey's member-
ship. This finding is consistent ­ see above ­ with arguments that people's general
tendency to categorize others as out-groups increases one's opposition toward the
138 European Union Politics 18(1)
EU (Sniderman et al., 2000). In their words, `disliking immigrants in general makes
people more likely to oppose both policies'. However, and very importantly, the
addition of group-specific attitudes decreased the effect of anti-immigrant attitudes.
Consequently, although partially, the effect of anti-immigrant attitudes may be
explained by the general tendency to categorize, a substantial part is explained
by group-specific attitudes. Albeit based on a comparison of two very heteroge-
neous groups (Poles vs Muslims) this `punch line' is the main contribution of the
article.
The third article, also by the Special Issue guest editors, Erisen and Kentmen-
Cin (2017), addresses how different types of tolerance and perceived threat affect
opinions about the EU immigration policy in Germany and the Netherlands. They
distinguish social and political tolerance, and sociotropic and personal threats from
Muslim immigrants and assess how these influence EU citizens' beliefs that immi-
gration is one of the most important issues facing the EU. Using experiments, in
which the religion of the immigrant, level of perceived threat and type of tolerance
are manipulated, they examine how people's attitudes on immigration policies are
affected. It is very good to augment the evidence in the Special Issue, mostly
stemming from survey-based research, with experiments offering additional lever-
age in the causal claims.
The fourth article is by Steenbergen and Siczek (2017). They focus on the sup-
port for right-wing populist parties (in particular the United Kingdom
Independence Party (UKIP)) and vote intention in the Brexit referendum. Their
starting point is that ­ in the wake of globalization ­ individuals' risk propensity
relates to support for these parties. Using survey data from the UK, they show how
`risk' as a personality trait relates to support for the UKIP and intentions to vote
for a Brexit. They conclude that there is evidence of this psychological impact, both
directly and indirectly, on UKIP and Brexit voting. The proposition of `risk pro-
pensity' as a key concept is interesting and important, and, at the same time, begs
the question how this finding relates to other explanations for such political pref-
erences, including the relationship with other personality traits which have been
found to relate to both EU attitudes (e.g. Bakker and de Vreese, 2016; Tillman,
2013) and support for populist voting (e.g. Bakker et al., 2015).
The next article by Erisen (2017) goes beyond the impact of attitudes towards
immigration and national identity attachment on the one hand, on EU atti-
tudes on the other. Instead, the focus is on how non-EU immigration heritage
affects European identification. Using Eurobarometer (EB) data, it looks at the
degree of European identification of `those with a first generation non-EU
immigration heritage [compared] to that of EU country natives'. The punch
line, that anti-discrimination policies are conducive for immigrants' identification
with nation states rather than the EU, is both theoretically interesting and great
importance in current debates and policy discussions on immigration and
integration.
The sixth and final article is written by Lubbers and Coenders (2017).
They unpack the role of nationalism as part of the voting for the radical right.
de Vreese 139
Using European Value surveys, they point out that especially those who `value
ancestry as relevant for nationhood' are more likely to vote for the radical right.
Their observation, although not cast directly in the light of scholarship on popu-
lism, bears a great relevance for this work by putting central the notion of a
homeland based in-group.
New items on the research agenda
Collectively, this Special Issue provides timely new insights in the intricate rela-
tionship between immigration attitudes, EU attitudes, and (right wing) voting.
There is a strong degree of consistency of findings with extant research, but a
couple of articles offer evidence that takes this scholarship in a new and more
nuanced direction. As a Special Issue, the value is primarily within the different
articles and less so across the articles where more attention could have been paid to
articulating a coherent and novel, overarching theoretical framework. As this
important research agenda moves forward, at least the following points merit
attention: (a) differentiation in EU attitudes, (b) the role of national political
elites, (c) the changing communications environment, and (d) renewed attention
for the role of religion and religious attitudes.
First of all, it is noteworthy that virtually all articles in the Special Issue rely,
when addressing, on different measures of EU attitudes. This is not uncommon for
such research which is inhibited by either relying on very limited, longitudinal
survey data (like EB, ESS, EVS) or specific items used in specific studies. As
argued at length elsewhere (Boomgaarden et al., 2011), it is imperative that we
treat EU attitudes as multi-dimensional. For some citizens, EU attitudes might
converge, but for many there are fundamental differences between evaluating,
say, the utilitarian aspects of EU membership, the performance of EU institutions
or the degree of identification with the EU. Such nuances are important to capture
also to better understand the reluctance and ambivalence held by many citizens.
These nuances, also when it comes to the topic of Turkish membership (see Azrout
et al., 2012), are imperative for moving our understanding of EU attitudes forward
in an era where the EU itself is very different from what is was a decade ago. In the
same vein, there is a need to re-consider both long-standing explanations for EU
attitudes such as left-right preferences (van Elsas and van der Brug, 2015) and the
influence of disruptive events such as the financial and debt crises (Serricchio et al.,
2013). Finally, EU attitudes may indeed be increasingly important for understand-
ing citizens' voting behavior, not only in European Parliament elections (Hobolt
and de Vries, 2016) and in referendums on EU issues (Schuck and de Vreese, 2008),
but even in national elections (de Vries and Hobolt, 2016).
Second, the Special Issue touches, at least indirectly, on the important role that
political elites play. More studies are needed that disentangle how EU attitudes
converge with other (economic or immigration) attitudes (see e.g. Otjes and
Katsanidou, 2016), both amongst citizens and elites. Equally importantly we also
need to assess how issues of European integration are addressed in conjunction
140 European Union Politics 18(1)
with other concerns like immigration and globalization by different political elites
to better understand the changing dynamic of the political supply side. Has the
`sleeping giant' (van der Eijk and Franklin, 2007) been woken up or has the EU
discussion become interwoven and aligned with other salient topics?
Third, in an age where the dynamics between immigration attitudes, EU atti-
tudes, and voting behavior is changing, we need to pay more attention to the
information environment. Media coverage has been widely demonstrated to
affect public attitudes towards the EU (see e.g. de Vreese et al., 2016), but it is
high time to also assess the role and interplay of new, online, and social media.
Especially, the latter is feared to create possible filter bubbles in which citizens are
either shielded or actively shying away from information about such important
topics or being exposed mostly to like-minded information, potentially in a dispro-
portionate fashion. Several of the articles in this Special Issue touch on topics (e.g.
Brexit, Turkish membership) whether other scholarship has pointed to the media
and the communication environment as important factors.
Fourth and finally, the Special Issue also calls attention to the role of religion.
Religion plays out both in terms of actual religious attachments, degree of religious
behavior, and (in)tolerance towards other religions. Previously, Hobolt et al. (2011)
showed how religious intolerance affects EU attitudes and support for
Turkish EU membership. This Issue is a reminder of including this factor in
future research.
In sum, the Special Issue's renewed attention for anti-immigration attitudes and
EU attitudes, and the several adjacent questions pertaining to, e.g. globalization,
populism, and religion and actors such as the political elites and the media, is most
welcomed. In this respect, the Special Issue is a scholarly home run in terms of
timing.
