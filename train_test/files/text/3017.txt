Background: The National Comorbidity Survey is a
nationally representative survey of the prevalences and
correlates of DSM-III-R disorders in the US household
population.
Methods: Retrospective age-at-onset reports were used
to study predictive relationships between lifetime panic
and depression.
Results: Strong associations were found between the life-
time prevalences of panic and major depressive epi-
sodes (odds ratios: for panic attacks with depression, 6.2;
for panic disorder with depression, 6.8). These associa-
tions were not significantly influenced by the inclusion
or exclusion of respondents with mania. Temporally pri-
mary depression predicted a first onset of subsequentpanic
attacks but not of panic disorder. Temporally primary
panic attacks, with or without panic disorder and
whether or not the panic was persistent, predicted a
first onset of subsequent major depression. The asso-
ciations between panic attack and depression were
attenuated in models that controlled for prior trau-
matic life experiences and histories of other DSM-III-R
disorders.
Conclusions: Lifetime panic-depression comorbidity
characterizes most community respondents with panic
disorder and a substantial few of those with major de-
pression. The absence of a dose-response relationship sug-
gests that primary panic attack is a marker, rather than a
causal risk factor, of subsequent depression. Primary de-
pression, in comparison, appears to be a genuine risk fac-
tor for secondary panic attacks. That primary depres-
sion predicts panic attacks but not panic disorder suggests
that secondary panic is a severity marker of depression
rather than a comorbid condition. These results are far
from definitive because they are based on retrospective
reports, lay-administered diagnostic interviews, and only
1 survey. However, they raise important questions that
could lead to a fundamental rethinking of panic-
depression comorbidity if they are replicated in future
epidemiological and clinical studies.

EPISODE COMORBIDITY is of
considerable importance be-
cause of its high preva-
lence1,2 and association with
impairment and chronic-
ity.3,4 Episode comorbidity between panic
disorder and depression is one of the stron-
gest psychiatric comorbidities1,5 and the
single strongest anxiety-mood episode co-
morbidity in treatment groups6 and gen-
eral population samples.7 In this report, we
present epidemiological data on panic-
depression comorbidity in the National
Comorbidity Survey (NCS).8 Unlike clini-
cal studies, we deal with lifetime comor-
bidity and focus on predictive priorities be-
tween the first onsets of these disorders to
shed light on the influences that lead to
panic-depression comorbidity.
Theoretical discussions generally fo-
cus on whether patients with both panic
and depression have a single disorder or
2 disorders.9,10 The most compelling evi-
dence for the former comes from studies
that document neurobiological similari-
ties in patients with panic and those with
depression.11 The poor sensitivity and
specificity of these biological measures,12
coupled with disparate findings in recent
neuroimaging studies,13,14 suggest that the
2 disorders have substantially different
neurobiological substrates. In addition, co-
morbid panic-depression generally does
not aggregate separately from pure panic
or pure depression in family studies.15-17
As a result, most cases of panic-depres-
sion are thought to represent comorbid-
ity, whereas a smaller number might rep-
resent a distinct disorder.18,19
The following 3 logical possibilities
could explain this comorbidity: depres-
sion is a causal risk factor for panic dis-
order, panic disorder is a causal risk fac-
tor for depression, or panic disorder and

depression are both consequences of some other com-
mon disorder. The second and third possibilities have been
the focus of most clinical research. Persistent anxiety has
been postulated20 to lead to an exhaustion response and
depression, a finding consistent with panic causing de-
pression. Furthermore, most anxious-depressed pa-
tients report that their anxiety started at an earlier age
than their depression,21,22 suggesting a dose-response re-
lationship between panic disorder and subsequent de-
pression. This prediction has not been examined in pre-
vious research.
Panic attacks without panic disorder are generally
thought to be nonspecific severity markers of other psy-
chiatric disorders,23,24 a view codified in DSM-IV.25
Previous studies have not attempted to determine
whether it is panic attack or panic disorder that is
associated with depression. If it is only panic attack,
then the most plausible interpretation is that panic
represents a severity marker of depression rather than
a comorbid condition.
Furthermore, if secondary depression is the result
of exhaustion or demoralization in the face of persistent
anxiety, we would expect that it is persistent anxiety that
leads to secondary depression. If this is the case, the risk
of depression after panic attacks or panic disorder should
increase with the duration of the panic. We would also
expect that only current panic, rather than a history of
remitted panic, would predict a first onset of depres-
sion. If, on the other hand, panic is merely a phase in a
distinct biologically determined panic-depressive disor-
der, we would expect that the risk of a first episode of
depression is associated as strongly with a history of
panic as with active panic and is not related to duration.
No previous epidemiological study has examined these
patterns.
We also evaluate the possibility that panic-de-
pression comorbidity is due, at least in part, to common
causes. Several possibilities exist, including neurobio-
logical vulnerabilities,9 temperament,26 and stressful life
experiences.27 Epidemiological research has been most
SUBJECTS AND METHODS
SUBJECTS
The NCS is a nationally representative household survey
of persons aged 15 to 54 years along with a representative
sample of students living in campus group housing. The
NCS was administered to 8098 respondents in face-to-
face in-home interviews. The response rate was 82.4%. The
data reported here have been weighted to adjust for differ-
ential probabilities of selection and nonresponse. More de-
tailsontheNCSdesign,fieldprocedures,andsampleweights
are reported elsewhere.8,29
DIAGNOSTIC ASSESSMENT
National Comorbidity Survey diagnoses are based on a
modified version of the Composite International Diag-
nostic Interview (CIDI),30 a fully structured interview
designed to generate diagnoses according to both DSM-
III-R31 and ICD-10.32 The DSM-III-R criteria are used here.
Although the focus is on panic attack, panic disorder with
or without agoraphobia, and major depressive episode, we
control for other DSM-III-R disorders assessed in the NCS,
including anxiety disorders (phobias, generalized anxiety
disorder, and posttraumatic stress disorder), mania,
addictive disorders (alcohol and drug abuse and depen-
dence), conduct disorder, adult antisocial behavior, and
nonaffective psychosis.
The World Health Organization's CIDI field trials found
good short-term test-retest reliability and validity of the CIDI
compared with clinical reassessments.33 Because most of
these results came from clinical samples, a clinical reap-
praisal study was carried out in the NCS.34 Good validity
compared with blind clinical reappraisal interviews was
found for almost all diagnoses and for the assessment of
panic attacks. The exceptions were mania35 and nonaffec-
tive psychosis,36 neither of which was assessed with ac-
ceptable validity in the CIDI. Because separate clinical re-
appraisal interviews were carried out for each diagnosis,
no data are available on the CIDI's accuracy in discrimi-
nating between unipolar and bipolar depression or be-
tween depression and panic. Data on the validity of the dis-
tinction between panic attacks and panic disorder are also
not available because the validity study focused on panic
attacks only. The distinction between panic attacks with
and without panic disorder was based on respondents re-
porting 4 or more attacks in a single month or persistent
worry for a month or longer about having another attack.
The absence of such data is a limitation of the results re-
ported in this article.
The World Health Organization field trials also found
good test-retest reliability--but only marginally accept-
able validity compared with clinician assessments--of ret-
rospective diagnostic age-at-onset reports in the CIDI.37 This
is an important limitation because age-at-onset reports play
a central role in the analysis of temporal priorities. To im-
prove the accuracy of these reports in the NCS, the stan-
dard CIDI age-at-onset question, which simply asks re-
spondents how old they were when they first had an episode
of depression, a panic attack, or a cluster of 4 panic at-
tacks in a single month, was elaborated into a series of 4
more-focused questions. For the first question, respon-
dents were asked if they could "clearly remember [empha-
sis in original]" the exact age when they had their first epi-
sode, attack, or attack cluster. If they answered yes, that
age was recorded. If they answered no, they were asked their
approximate age at onset: "about [emphasis in original] how
old were you the first time?" They were then asked for "the
earliest age you can clearly remember [emphasis in origi-
nal]" a particular episode or attack or attack cluster. The
response was taken as an upper bound on the respon-
dent's age at onset.
No data to assess the validity of the age-at-onset re-
ports based on this 4-question series were obtained in the
NCS clinical reappraisal study. However, substantively im-
plausible associations between the age at interview and the
reported age at onset found in surveys that used the stan-
dard CIDI age-at-onset question38 do not exist in the NCS,39
indirectly arguing for improved validity. Nonetheless, the
likely existence of remaining errors in NCS retrospective

concerned with the last, showing that distant events ac-
count for more than half of the observed episode comor-
bidity between anxiety and depression.27,28 No previous
research has looked at the effects of traumatic events on
lifetime panic-depression comorbidity.
RESULTS
LIFETIME PREVALENCES AND COMORBIDITIES
OF PANIC AND DEPRESSION
The lifetime prevalences of DSM-III-R panic and depres-
sion were reported previously44,45 and include 7.2%
(n = 422) for panic attack, 3.4% (n = 200) for panic dis-
order, and 16.9% (n = 995) for major depressive epi-
sode. About half of respondents with lifetime panic at-
tack (50.9%) and panic disorder (55.6%) also meet lifetime
criteria for depression, whereas about one fifth (21.6%)
of the people with lifetime depression reported a life-
time panic attack and one tenth (11.2%) met lifetime cri-
teria for panic disorder. The ORs between lifetime panic
and depression are statistically significant and substan-
tial in magnitude: for panic attack with depression, 6.2
(95% confidence interval, 5.0-7.6); for panic disorder
with depression, 6.8 (95% confidence interval, 5.1-8.9)
(P.001 for both).
TEMPORAL PRIORITY OF FIRST ONSETS
OF PANIC AND DEPRESSION
Retrospective age-at-onset reports were compared to as-
sess the temporal priority of first onsets of panic attack,
panic disorder, and depression. Among the 302 respon-
dents who reported at least 1 lifetime panic attack and
at least 1 lifetime episode of depression, 94 (31.1%) said
their first episode of depression occurred at an earlier age
than their first panic attack, 77 (25.5%) said their first
episode of depression and first panic attack occurred in
the same year, and 131 (43.4%) said their first panic at-
tack occurred at an earlier age than their first depressive
age-at-onset reports is a limitation of the results presented
here.
RISK FACTORS
The NCS asked about the lifetime occurrence and ages of
first occurrence of 22 traumatic experiences that might be
risk factors for both panic and depression. These include
early loss events (eg, early death of a parent or parental di-
vorce), interpersonal traumas (eg, rape or combat experi-
ence in a war), parental psychiatric disorders as assessed
by Family History Research Diagnostic Criteria40 (eg, ma-
ternal depression or paternal alcoholism), and other trau-
matic experiences (eg, being in a life-threatening automo-
bile accident or a natural disaster). Only ages of first
occurrence, not of subsequent recurrences, were re-
corded, so the assessment of these experiences is incom-
plete. Nonetheless, the available data provide a useful way
of assessing the role of traumatic experiences in bringing
about panic-depression comorbidity. A detailed descrip-
tion of the traumatic life experiences, the measurement
procedures used to assess them, and their associations with
each of the disorders assessed in the NCS are presented else-
where.41
ANALYSIS PROCEDURES
Conditional probabilities and odds ratios (ORs) were used
to study comorbidity. Retrospective age-at-onset reports
were used to study temporal priorities between first on-
sets of panic and of depression. Discrete-time survival analy-
sis42 with person-year as the unit of analysis was used to
study predictive associations. In this method, each year in
the life of each respondent up to and including the year of
onset of the outcome disorder or the year of the interview,
whichever comes first, is treated as a separate observa-
tional record. Logistic regression is used to predict a
dichotomous measure of the onset of the outcome disor-
der (coded 1 for the year of onset and 0 for prior years) in
this person-year file. When controls are introduced for
age at the time of the observational record, the logistic
regression coefficients can be interpreted as survival coef-
ficients in a model that allows nonproportional hazards.42
These coefficients can also be exponentiated to generate
ORs. The predictors can be either unrelated to time, such
as sex or race, or time-varying, such as marital status or a
history of other disorders as of the age of the observa-
tional record.
In our use of this method, we estimated a separate se-
ries of discrete-time survival models to predict the life-
time first onset of 3 outcomes: panic attack, panic disor-
der, and major depressive episode. In each model, we
included controls for age in the person-year, age at inter-
view, sex, and race. The predictors of primary interest were
time-varying measures of the prior onset and continua-
tion of the other disorders. These were "time-varying" be-
cause they were coded as not present for the observational
records for a particular respondent up to the age at onset
of the predictor disorder and then coded as present in sub-
sequent observational records. We also created predictor
variables for time since the first onset of the predictor dis-
order. Furthermore, we used respondent data about the age
of recency of each disorder to create predictor variables.
This allowed us to distinguish between observational rec-
ords with a history of the predictor disorder that had ended
at an earlier age and records with a history of the disorder
that had not ended.
Significance tests for individual ORs were computed
using the method of jackknife repeated replications43 to es-
timate SEs that adjusted for design effects introduced by
clustering and weighting of observations. The jackknife re-
peated replication is one of several methods that use simu-
lations of coefficient distributions in subsamples to gener-
ate empirical estimates of SEs and significance tests. The
ratios of the coefficients to these adjusted SEs were used
to compute z scores for the significance of the survival co-
efficients and 95% confidence intervals for the ORs. Tests
for the significance of sets of predictors taken together were
computed using Wald 2 tests. Design effects were intro-
duced into these calculations by computing the Wald scores
from coefficient variance-covariance matrices based on the
jackknife repeated replication simulations.

episode. Among the 157 respondents with lifetime panic
disorder and depression, with the age at onset of panic
disorder dated as the age of the first cluster of 4 attacks
in a 4-week period or the first month of persistent worry
about having another attack, 75 (48.0%) reported that
the depression started at an earlier age than the panic dis-
order, 48 (30.6%) said that the depression and panic dis-
order started at the same age, and 34 (21.5%) said that
the panic disorder started at an earlier age than the first
depressive episode.
TEMPORALLY PRIMARY DEPRESSION AND
SUBSEQUENT PANIC
We began by using information about prior depression
to predict the first onset of a panic attack (with or with-
out panic disorder) and then carried out a parallel analy-
sis to predict the first onset of panic disorder in the sub-
sample of observational records for persons with a history
of panic attacks. No evidence was found for an effect of
depression in predicting panic disorder after the onset
of a first panic attack. Therefore, we focused further ef-
forts on the prediction of a first panic attack. Two im-
portant results emerged. First, the persistence of depres-
sion is necessary to predict a panic attack. That is, people
who reported a history of temporally primary depres-
sion but said that their last episode ended in, eg, year Y+5,
had a significantly elevated risk of a first onset of panic
attack in the 5-year interval between Y (signifies year)
and Y+5 but (assuming they did not have an onset in this
interval) no longer had an elevated risk beginning in year
Y+6. This implies that active depression rather than a his-
tory of depression predicts a panic attack. Second, the
effect of depression in predicting panic attack does not
vary significantly with time since the first onset.
The parameter estimates in the final model are
reported in the first column of Table 1 (referred to as
model 1). The effects of depression are differentiated by
the time since onset. The OR for the first onset of
depression in the same year as respondents had their
first panic attack is large (25.9), and the ORs for the
first onset of panic attack in subsequent years are
smaller (between 3.2 and 5.1).
The results for model 2 in Table 1 are the ORs for
the same predictor variables in a model that introduces
a control for mania. These results suggest that mania does
not play a major part in the association between depres-
sion and a subsequent first onset of panic attack. As stated
previously, however, mania is not assessed with accept-
able validity in the CIDI due to its substantial overdiag-
nosing of the disorder.35 To address this problem, we rep-
licated model 1 after excluding respondents who were
classified by the CIDI as having a history of mania. The
results (not shown) were similar to those reported in Table
1 for model 2.
The results for model 3 are the ORs for the same pre-
dictor variables in a model that introduces controls for
mania and also for the 22 lifetime traumatic experiences
described earlier (see the "Risk Factors" subsection of the
"Subjects and Methods" section). Each of the ORs is
smaller than those in model 2, which means that the ex-
periences considered here explain part of the associa-
tion between temporally primary depression and a sub-
sequent panic attack. We also estimated models that
distinguished the effects of traumatic life experiences that
occurred before vs later than the first onset of depres-
sion and included multiplicative interactions between de-
pression and the traumas. No more of these interactions
were significant than we would expect on the basis of
chance.
Finally, the results for model 4 are the ORs for
the same predictor variables in a model that includes
controls for mania, the 22 traumatic experiences, and
all other NCS or DSM-III-R disorders that occurred
before the first onset of panic attack. This model con-
trols for such mediating processes as that linking pri-
mary depression to secondary panic attacks through
addiction. The cross-sectional OR is statistically sig-
nificant but considerably smaller than in model 1,
whereas the time-lagged ORs are no longer statistically
significant in panic with onset delays of 6 years or
more. The aggregate time-lagged effect of between 1
and 5 years remains significant in a modified version
of model 4 (OR, 1.7; 95% confidence interval, 1.1-2.0;
P = .04) but is substantially smaller than the compa-
rable coefficients in model 1.

*The ORs are exponentiated discrete-time survival coefficients based on person-year models comparing the odds of a subsequent first onset of panic attack
among people with a history of depression vs those who never had an episode of major depression. A total of 583 respondents in the National Comorbidity Survey
reported a history of panic attack at the time of the interview. The data file comparing these respondents with all others in the National Comorbidity Survey
contained a total of 173 931 person-years.
See the text for a complete description of each model. The traumas that significantly predicted subsequent panic attack were paternal generalized anxiety
disorder, maternal depression, exposure to extreme physical aggression from parents as a youngster, and witnessing a traumatic event as a child. More details on
the measurement of traumatic experiences and the associations between these experiences and subsequent disorders are given elsewhere by Kessler et al.41
All ORs are significant at .05 (2-tailed test), except those in model 4 for 6 or more years since first onset of depression.

More detailed analyses found 3 potentially impor-
tant elaborations of the significant time-lagged coeffi-
cients in model 4. First, a strong relationship was found
between the severity of primary depression, as indi-
cated by the number of symptoms, and the odds of sub-
sequent panic. Second, approximately half of respon-
dents with depression followed by panic attack had at
least 1 other anxiety disorder before the depression. These
earlier anxiety disorders are significant predictors of de-
pression and of panic attack after depression. No evi-
dence was found for a significant interaction between de-
pression and prior anxiety in predicting panic attack.
Third, a significant interaction was found between life
stage and prior depression in predicting panic attack, with
the effect of depression increasing with age.
TEMPORALLY PRIMARY PANIC AND
SUBSEQUENT DEPRESSION
Parallel discrete-time survival models were used to study
the time-lagged relationship between temporally pri-
mary panic and subsequent depression. The least com-
plex models included controls plus separate time-
varying effects of panic attack (with or without panic
disorder) and panic disorder. The cross-sectional asso-
ciations involving panic attack and disorder were sig-
nificant, as was the time-lagged association for panic at-
tack. No significant time-lagged association was found
for panic disorder, however.
More detailed models were then estimated to ex-
plore the effects of persistence and time since the first
onset of panic attacks. Three important results emerged.
First, the persistence of panic attacks is not necessary to
predict the subsequent first onset of depression. For in-
stance, people who reported a history of temporally pri-
mary panic attack but said that their last attack was in
year Y+5 not only had a significantly elevated risk of a
first episode of depression in the interval between Y and
Y+5 but (assuming that they did not have an onset in this
interval) they also had the same elevated risk beginning
in year Y+6. This implies that it is a history of panic rather
than active panic that predicts a subsequent first onset
of depression. Second, the time-lagged effect of panic at-
tack does not vary with the time since the first onset.
Third, no meaningful association was found between life
stage and panic in predicting the subsequent first onset
of depression.
The parameter estimates for the final model are re-
ported in the first column of Table 2 (referred to as model
1). The OR for the first onset of depression in the same
year as a first panic attack is large (16.5), and the ORs
for the onset of depression in the same year as panic dis-
order (3.1) and in the years after the onset of panic at-
tack are smaller (between 2.8 and 4.8). Significance tests
for time trends found no evidence that the time-lagged
coefficients change significantly with the time since the
onset.
The results for model 2 are the ORs for the same pre-
dictor variables in a model that introduces controls for
mania. The ORs are consistently lower than in model 1,
demonstrating that mania plays at least some role in the
association between temporally primary panic and the
subsequent first onset of depression. When all persons
with mania according to the CIDI are excluded from the
analysis and model 1 is estimated in this restricted sample,
results (not shown) are similar to those shown in Table
2 for model 1.
The results for model 3 are the ORs for the same pre-
dictor variables in a model that controls for mania and
for the 22 lifetime traumatic experiences described ear-
lier. All of the ORs are somewhat smaller than in model
2 but remain consistently significant at .05. More de-
tailed analyses were carried out to distinguish the ef-
fects of traumatic experiences before vs later than the first
onset of panic attack and panic disorder and to examine
multiplicative interactions between panic and these ex-
periences, but no more of these interactions were sig-
nificant than we would expect on the basis of chance.

*The ORs are exponentiated discrete-time survival coefficients based on person-year models comparing the odds of a subsequent first onset of a major
depressive episode among people with a history of panic vs those who never had a panic attack or a panic disorder. A total of 1403 respondents in the National
Comorbidity Survey reported a history of a major depressive episode at the time of the interview. The data file comparing these respondents with all others in the
National Comorbidity Survey contained a total of 155 548 person-years.
See the text for a complete description of each model. The traumas that significantly predicted subsequent major depression were paternal separation or
divorce when the respondent was a child, maternal or paternal depression, maternal or paternal generalized anxiety disorder, maternal or paternal antisocial
personality disorder, maternal or paternal alcohol or other drug dependence, sexual abuse or rape, exposure to extreme physical aggression from parents as a
youngster, exposure to a natural disaster, and witnessing a traumatic event as a child. More details on the measurement of traumatic experiences and the
associations between these experiences and subsequent disorders are given elsewhere by Kessler et al.41
All ORs are significant at .05 (2-tailed test), except all those in model 4 for 1 or more years since first onset of panic attack.

COMMENT
We note 3 important limitations of this study. First, the
NCS is a cross-sectional survey. This means that all
inferences about temporal ordering are based on retro-
spective reports. Recall bias or sample selection bias
could distort estimated relationships. That results hold
up in subsamples differing in age at onset argues indi-
rectly against a strong effect of recall bias. A definitive
evaluation will require replication in a prospective
study. Second, the CIDI is a lay-administered diagnostic
interview that imperfectly captures the diagnostic dis-
tinctions made by experienced clinicians. The evidence
of consistency in the CIDI with independent clinical
diagnoses argues against a pervasive bias, but impreci-
sion in distinguishing panic attack from panic disorder
or panic from depression might play a part in the
results. Third, the CIDI focuses largely on lifetime dis-
orders. Consequently, we have been concerned here
with the temporal ordering of first onsets, with no focus
on the order of the onset of panic and depression in
particular episodes. There is no indication that tempo-
ral priority in a first onset will tell us much about tem-
poral priority in episodes.
In the context of these limitations, the pattern of life-
time comorbidity reported is similar to that found in pre-
vious epidemiological studies7,46 in showing depression
in most of those with panic and panic in a substantial
few of those with depression. In addition, we find strong
reciprocal predictive relationships between panic attack
and depression. About half of respondents with lifetime
panic-depression have at least 1 other prior anxiety dis-
order. This means that panic-depression is often part of
a larger anxious-depression syndrome in which another
anxiety disorder is temporally primary. This larger syn-
drome, which has not been examined in this report, war-
rants detailed examination in future research.
The results regarding temporal priority between
panic and depression might appear to be at odds with
most of the literature because previous studies21,22 have
consistently found that anxiety usually begins at an ear-
lier age than depression among people with lifetime
comorbidity. The NCS data yield the same result when
anxiety is analyzed in the aggregate, as it has been in
most previous epidemiological studies.47 This is because
early-onset phobias are the temporally primary disor-
ders in most patients with lifetime comorbid anxiety
and depression. The situation is different for panic-
depression comorbidity both in the NCS and in the few
other epidemiological surveys7,22,48 that have focused on
this particular type of anxiety-depression comorbidity.
When we define the onset of panic as the age of the first
attack, depression occurring before panic is only
slightly less common than panic occurring before
depression. Furthermore, when we focus on the age at
onset of a panic disorder rather than the age at onset of
a first panic attack, depression occurring before panic is
much more common than panic occurring before
depression.
Although the NCS results regarding temporal pri-
ority are consistent with previous research, they contra-
dict the assumptions of earlier studies in 2 important ways.
First, the temporal priority of anxiety before depression
has been previously interpreted as meaning that the tran-
sition is stronger from pure anxiety than from pure de-
pression to anxious-depression.49,50 Our more subtle analy-
sis shows that gross time-lagged effects are similar in
magnitude for temporally primary panic attack predict-
ing a subsequent first onset of depression and for tem-
porally primary depression predicting a subsequent first
onset of panic attack.
Second, the implicit assumption in all previous
research on panic-depression comorbidity has been that
panic disorder rather than panic attack is comorbid
with depression. We found the opposite to be true.
Because panic attacks are generally conceptualized as
nonspecific severity markers, it is not clear that the
association between panic attacks and depression
should be conceptualized as a comorbidity. As a result,
this finding, if it is replicated in independent data sets,
will require a fundamental rethinking of the meaning of
panic-depression comorbidity. There is an important
exception to the general finding that depression is
related to panic attack but not panic disorder. A sig-
nificant cross-sectional relationship exists between
panic disorder and depression. This pattern character-
izes nearly a third of respondents with the lifetime co-
occurrence of panic disorder and major depression, and
these respondents conceivably represent a distinct
subtype.
When we focus on the association between panic
attacks and depression, important time-lagged asymme-
tries emerge that raise questions about whether the un-
derlying causes might differ depending on which is tem-
porally primary. In the case of depression before panic
attack, that the time-lagged relationship is no longer sig-
nificant for patients with remitted depression is consis-
tent with treatment studies that have failed to docu-
ment an association between remitted depression and the
severity of current panic attacks.51,52 This result, in con-
junction with the relationship between the number of de-
pressive symptoms and the risk of a subsequent panic
attack, suggests that secondary panic might be a sever-
ity marker of depression rather than a comorbid condi-
tion. If this is true, it is not clear why there is no rela-
tionship between the number of years of depression and
the risk of a subsequent panic attack. Further research
needs to determine whether this specification replicates
in other data sets and, if so, to look for explanatory
or mediating variables that might make sense of this
phenomenon.
The situation is different for panic before depres-
sion, where the data suggest that panic attack is a proxy
for some other underlying causal risk factor. This con-
clusion is based on 3 observations indicating the

absence of a dose-response relationship. The first is that
respondents with a history of panic attack have the
same elevated risk of subsequent depression whether
their panic is remitted or active. It is possible to make
sense of this while maintaining the view that panic
causes depression by suggesting that consequences of
panic that persist after the attacks have ended, such as
avoidance, secondary agoraphobia, and secondary sub-
stance abuse, lead to depression. This interpretation is
also consistent with the finding that the time-lagged
associations between a primary panic attack and subse-
quent depression are statistically insignificant in model
4 of Table 2, which controls for other disorders. It is
more difficult to offer a similar interpretation of the
observations that panic attack, but not panic disorder,
predicts a subsequent first onset of depression and that
the duration of the primary panic attack is unrelated to
the risk of a subsequent first onset of depression. These
results are more consistent with the view that panic
attack is a marker of some cluster of risk factors of both
panic and depression. These results demonstrate that
clinicians should be aware that their patients with a his-
tory of panic attacks, whether or not the panic is active,
are at risk of subsequent depression. More focused
research, using longitudinal and family-genetic designs,
is needed to sort out the causal pathways involved in
this risk to develop a rational strategy for preventing
subsequent depression.
