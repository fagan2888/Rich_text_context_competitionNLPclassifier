What explains the American disadvantage in health
compared with the English? The case of diabetes
James Banks,1,2 Meena Kumari,3 James P Smith,4 Paola Zaninotto3
ABSTRACT
Background Middle-aged and older American men and
women have almost twice the rate of diabetes of men
and women in England. This differential was not
explained by conventional risk factors including age,
smoking, social position and body mass index (BMI).
Methods This study used large and representative
samples of non-minority adults aged 52e85 years taken
from the 1999e2006 American National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) and the 2004
English Longitudinal Study of Aging. The surveys contain
self-reported and objective biological disease markers of
diabetes as well as indicators of major risk factors for
diabetes including anthropometric measures of BMI,
height and waist circumference.
Results The older American population has much higher
rates of diabetes than the English populationda
differential not yet explained, but this population also has
higher waist circumference at each level of BMI than
does the equivalent group in England. By controlling for
such waist circumference differences and allowing
for different effects of waist on diabetes in each
country, approximately three-quarters of the country
differences for women and 38% among men can be
explained.
Conclusions Higher rates of diabetes in the US old-age
population than in England were largely accounted for by
raised waist circumference and not BMI differences,
especially among women. In addition, elevated diabetes
risk associated with higher waist circumference in the
USA as opposed to England could arise as a result of
a number of different mechanisms. Investigation of the
relative importance of such mechanisms is an important
topic for further study.
Diabetes prevalence is approximately twice as high
in the USA compared with England for both sexes.1
This difference was not due to differential disease
self-reporting by country because the differential
exists using either self-reports of doctor diagnosis or
objective markers of diabetes. Conventional models
of diabetes prevalence that included standard risk
factors (smoking, age, social position) indicated
that little of this international difference was
explained by country differences in these risks.1
These differences remained substantial when body
mass index (BMI) indicators of overweight or obese
were included in the analyses, indicating that other
factors were responsible.1
Recent data suggested that other aspects of body
shape including waist circumference were different
across countries.2 Increasing waist circumference
was associated with the increasing risk of subse-
quent diabetes and was more predictive than BMI.3 4
The association of increased diabetes or its risk
factors with shorter height has been described in
many populations.5 6
Earlier analyses examining international differ-
ences in diabetes did not examine the role of waist
circumference.1 We study its importance in the
English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA) and
the American National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey (NHANES), which are
nationally representative cohorts with both BMI
and waist circumference measurements. Our aim
was to expand these models to consider the
simultaneous risks of both BMI and waist circum-
ference, and to assess how much of the difference in
diabetes prevalence between England and America
was explained by these body shape risks.
METHODS
Data
We used data from eight waves of NHANES, fielded
between 1999 and 2006,7 and the 2004 second wave
of ELSA. We combined NHANES waves from
before and after ELSA 2004 to have comparable
sample sizes. There was no statistically significant
trend in diabetes prevalence over NHANES years
1999e2006 so NHANES was time comparable with
ELSA. NHANES included data obtained through
personal interviews, physical and laboratory
examinations for people 2 months and older. For
age comparability, we restricted our NHANES
sample to respondents between 52 and 85 years
olddage 52 years was the minimum age in ELSA
and age 85 years was the maximum age in
NHANES. To ensure that country differences were
not due to high rates of diabetes among African-
Americans or Hispanic individuals in America or
Asian and black immigrants in England, our anal-
ysis was restricted to non-Hispanic white individ-
uals. There were 4570 non-Hispanic white
NHANES respondents in this age range.
ELSA contained respondents recruited from three
separate years of the Health Survey for England
providing representative English samples aged
50 years and over in 2002. Health data were
supplemented by the collection of social and
economic data.8 ELSA protocols included interview
visits followed by nurse visits when saliva and
blood samples were drawn. Blood samples were
analysed for glycosylated haemoglobin, also avail-
able in NHANES. There were 6888 respondents in
our ELSA analytical sample.
NHANES is a nationally representative survey
of Americans less than 85 years of age with a high
response rate. The baseline response rate in
2005e6 was 80% and 77% for those receiving
medical examinations. Its sample characteristics
closely match the current population surveys.

Research report
NHANES is a repeated cross-sectional survey so it was unaf-
fected by sample attrition (see http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/
nhanes/response_rates_CPS_.htm).
We examined impacts of differential response bias and sample
attrition in ELSA on estimates of disease prevalence including
diabetes by comparing estimates with those from the Health
Survey for England.9 Differences in diabetes prevalence between
the two countries were equally large in cross-sectional national
surveys indicating that disease prevalence rates were not
significantly biased due to differential attrition or response rates.
Measures of diabetes prevalence
Both surveys collected data on individual diabetes self-reports of
the form `Did a doctor ever tell you that you had diabetes.' as
well as glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c), a measure of the
percentage of haemoglobin molecules bound to glucose.
Although not usually a screener for diabetes, HbA1c is highly
correlated with fasting plasma glucose levels.9 10 While there is
no strict diagnosis threshold value, we took values greater than
or equal to 6.5% as indicating clinical diabetes (an international
threshold recently approved).11 Our results were insensitive to
the specific thresholds chosen. Respondents were classified as
having diabetes if either they answered affirmatively to the self-
reported diabetes question or their HbA1c levels were 6.5% or
greater. Our measures were thus unaffected by country differ-
ences in undiagnosed diabetes.
Measures of BMI and waist risk
Height and weight measurements were taken during nurse-
conducted physical examinations so objective BMI measures
were computed free of errors in self-reports.12 We experimented
with two BMI measuresdcategorical indicators of whether
respondents were obese (BMI $30) or overweight (BMI $25 and
<30) and continuous BMI measures (kg/m2) entered as
quadratics. As height may have an independent effect,13 height
in metres was entered as a quadratic.
BMI provides a crude index of adiposity by not considering
central fat mass, which is more strongly associated with disease
risk. Our data contained both BMI and central fat
massdobjectively measured waist circumference in centi-
metres.14 Similar to BMI, we experimented with two measures
of waist risk. The first categorised respondents into three waist
risk groups (low, medium and high) in which centimetre cut-off
points differed by gender.15 16 The male groups were low
(<94 cm), moderate (94e101 cm) and high risk ($102 cm),
whereas for women cut-off points were low (<80 cm), moderate
(80e88 cm) and high risk ($88 cm). Our second measure was
waist in centimetres, entered as a quadratic.
Other risk factors
American education was separated into high school or less
(0e12 years), more than high school but not a college graduate
(13e15 years) and college or more (16 years or greater). The
English three-way education division was qualified to a level
lower than `O' level or equivalent (typically 0e11 years), quali-
fied to a level lower than `A' level or equivalent (typically
12e13 years of schooling), and a higher qualification (more than
13 years). Our surveys collected several health-related behav-
iours including smoking status (ever smoked) and marital status
(single or married).
Statistical methods
We estimated six models of diabetes prevalence separately for
men and women. We began with a baseline model pooled across
countries with no covariates except an indicator of coun-
trydour `unadjusted' model or country differences in diabetes
prevalence we tried to explain. The subsequent five models
labelled 1 to 5 all included quadratics in age and in height, and
indicator variables described above for education, marital status
and smoking.
We were particularly interested in the role of BMI and waist
circumference combined with how they were measured. Models
1 to 5 differed in how we specified them. Model 1 used
conventional BMI categorical indicators of obesity and over-
weight; model 2 had the same BMI categorical indicators and
added waist categorical indicators of moderate and high waist
risk; model 3 had continuous BMI entered as a quadratic; model
4 had continuous BMI and continuous waist both as quadratics;
model 5 had the same model as model 4 but in addition allowed
the effects of continuous BMI and continuous waist to differ
between America and England.
We relied on ordinary least squares regression models of
prevalence, estimated using Stata statistical software. As our
models contained interaction terms, logistic regressions do not
provide a straightforward interpretation.17 Nevertheless our
conclusions from the non-interactive models were unchanged if
multiple logistic or multivariate probit models were used.
RESULTS
Table 1 lists means and standard deviations of variables and
displays results of statistical tests for country differences.
American male prevalence was 16% compared with 11% for
English men and 14% for American women compared with 7%
for English women. Both country differences in diabetes preva-
lence were statistically significant at the 1% level.
Conventional diabetes risk factors were similar in the Amer-
ican and English populations examined. On average Americans
are only a little taller, have slightly higher BMI and are
approximately 3 years older. The English were less educated and
more likely to have smoked, risk factors that normally increase
diabetes.3 18 19 The only attribute offering some explanatory
promise was waist circumference. American men have almost
3 cm larger waists than English men, and the waists of American
women are 5 cm bigger than English women (p<0.01).
Figures 1e3 present age standardised distribution of waist risk
(low, moderate and high) among those whose BMI is below 25,
between 25 and 30 and 30 and over separately by gender in both
countries. Age standardisation eliminated impacts of country
differences in age distributions. Using age groups 50e59, 60e69,
70e79, 80 years and over, age-weighted BMI and waist risks were
calculated. To capture risk variation, individuals were placed into
three BMI groups and three waist risk groups defined above.
Supplementary appendix table A, available online only, includes
statistical tests of differences in waist and BMI between countries.
American men were more obese than English men (31.6%
compared with 26.7%) but less overweight (44.0% compared
with 48.3%) with no difference in normal weight. Female
obesity differences were even smaller (32.9% of Americans
compared with 30.6% among English women), a disparity not
statistically significant and not large enough to explain a two-to-
one diabetes prevalence differential between countries.
Compared with English women, American women were less
overweight (32.1% compared with 38.7%) and more of normal
weight (35.0% compared with 30.8%). Given these BMI distri-
butions, it is unsurprising that BMI alone cannot explain higher
diabetes rates among Americans.
Marginal distributions of waist risk within each BMI group
were more to the disadvantage of American men than BMI

differences and female disparities are strikingd56.0% of English
women have high waist risk, whereas the comparable fraction
among Americans was 69.4%da statistically significant differ-
ence. These differences are in accord with recent evidence from
smaller more specialist studies in which body shape was
measured using three-dimensional body scanning equipment in
both countries.
If there was a one-to-one correspondence between BMI and
waist risk categories, there would be little reason to prefer one.
But this is not true. Among the overweight in figure 2, 56% of
American men have high waist risk compared with 41% of
English men, while 87% of American women have high waist
risk compared with 61% of English women. Even among those
with normal weight, the fraction with raised waist risk was not
trivial for US womend40.6% of Americans who were neither
overweight nor obese were categorised as high waist risk
compared with 8.9% among equivalent English women. The
only BMI category with little additional information obtained
from waist were the obese (figure 3). At least 95% of respondents
labelled obese were simultaneously labelled high waist risk.
Figure 4 summarises the ability of factors to explain country
differences in diabetes prevalence using our six models. For each
model, the solid bar indicates our estimate of `unexplained'
prevalence rate differences between America and England, while
the lines represent 95% CI around that estimate. The unadjusted
specification reported a baseline model pooled across countries
with just the country dummy (¼1 indicates US). This model
highlighted unadjusted country differences in diabetesd4.8%
for men and 7.3% for women.
Subsequent models in the next five rows in figure 4 sequen-
tially expand the set of covariates while maintaining the
assumption that the effects of covariates are the same in both
countries. All models below unadjusted included quadratic
controls for age and height, indicator variables for education
groups, single and smoking. Models 1e4 varied the way in
which BMI and waist circumference were included in models.
Model 1 estimates in figure 4 represented the traditional
approach to measuring BMIdtwo indicators for whether one
was overweight or obese. This model did not explain any
between-country prevalence differencedsome factors (age,
BMI) predict higher US diabetes prevalence, other factors
(education, height) predict the opposite with combined effects
largely offsetting. Model 2 highlights the impacts of adding
categorical variables to capture waist riskdthese effects are

quite modest in reducing unexplained country prevalence
differences.
Model 3 was similar to model 1 except continuous quadratic
BMI replaced standard obese and overweight categories controls.
Estimated country prevalence differences were unchanged.
Model 4 shows effects of including continuous quadratic
measures of BMI and waist risk. With both shape variables
measured continuously instead of as categories, we explained
one quarter of the original male difference in prevalence and
approximately 60% of the female difference. Continuous BMI by
itself does not help explain country differences (another illus-
tration of BMI deficiency), but a combination of continuous
measures of BMI and waist significantly reduced country
differences in `unexplained' diabetes prevalence.
Models 1e4 did not allow effects of BMI or waist on
predicting diabetes to vary by country. Our preferred model 5
allowed estimated impacts of both body shape measures to vary
between countries. The remaining unexplained male country
difference was 3 percentage points and 1.9 percentage points for
women. As indicated by 95% CI in figure 4, female country
difference in diabetes was no longer statistically significant.
Control variables in this model explained 38% of country
difference in male prevalence and 74% of female differences.
The regression models underlying model 5 in figure 4 are
presented in table 2. Estimates for non-anthropometric variables
were as expected.20 The probability of diabetes rose with age at
a decreasing rate, increased height is associated with lower
diabetes risk, and smoking and marital status did not matter.21 22
After controlling for waist, we found no statistically significant
effect of BMI for American or English men or women. In contrast
to weak BMI effects, waist risk was strongly associated with
diabetes, with risk increasing in waist circumference. Based on
a likelihood ratio test, quadratic waist terms were statistically
significant for American men and women implying that the
consequences of raised waist are higher for them compared with
the English.
DISCUSSION
We found significant roles for height and waist on diabetes
prevalence. The mechanisms by which height reduces diabetes
risk are unclear. Adult stature reflects childhood growth patterns
and an association of short stature with type 2 diabetes indicates
that impaired childhood growth leads to adult insulin resistance
and diabetes.23 Mechanisms include poor nutrition in child-
hood.24 There may be reverse causation at older ages, in which
co-morbidity with diabetes is associated with height reduction,
but we found no significant age interactions indicating that
these influences are unlikely to vary by country. While height
was related to diabetes risk, height cannot explain country
differences because average height was approximately the same
in both countries.
In contrast, waist circumference explained a substantial
proportion of higher diabetes in America for men and virtually
all differences for women, but continuous measures were
required to capture differences in diabetes risks between the two
populations.
Notes:
1. Solid bars indicate estimated prevalence differences; lines indicate 95% confidence
interval around the estimates.
2. Positive values of prevalence indicate greater prevalence in the US.
3. Models 2-5 all include the following risk factors: age and age2, height and height2 and
indicators of education, marital status and past smoking behaviour.
4. BMI and waist adjustments in models 1-4 are as follows. Model 1: categorical BMI
indicators; Model 2: categorical BMI indicators and categorical waist risk
indicators (medium, high); Model 3: BMI (kg/m2) and BMI2; Model 4: BMI and BMI2,
waist (cm) and waist2.
5. Model 5 contains the same adjustments as model 4, but with the effects of BMI and
waist being allowed to differ in the two countries.

Evidence cites increasing prevalence of obesity with increased
burden of disease,22 but little was explained here by obesity
categorised by BMI index.1 BMI provides a crude index of
adiposity by not considering central fat mass, which is more
strongly associated with disease risk. Acknowledging this is
important when making health comparisons across different
populations. Our data suggested that in each BMI category
a greater proportion of Americans were at increased disease risk
and that waist circumference played the key role.
There are several potential mechanisms, including different
rates of physical activity through exercise or activities of daily
life, diet differences, or a more adverse psychosocial environment
in America, all associated with central adiposity and type 2
diabetes.18 25 26 Adverse stressful environments may be associ-
ated with the development of central obesity.27
Evidence between central fat accumulation and diabetes risk is
striking.3 4 Compared with waist hip ratio, waist circumference
is a better marker of visceral fat.28 Fat cells located in the viscera
display distinct cellular features compared with fat cells else-
where, and a specific dysfunction of these cells may be the
pathophysiological basis for negative consequences of abdominal
obesity. Central fat cells have a higher turnover rate of triglyc-
erides, produce more pro-inflammatory and metabolic markers
than fat cells from other depots. They are involved in the
mobilisation of free fatty acids into portal circulation, impaired
liver function leading to insulin resistance and diabetes.
Our results were the same if we limited analyses to those
whose diabetes onset occurred after age 34 years so our conclu-
sions are not driven by country differences in type 1 diabetes.
Our results thus apply most directly to type 2 diabetes.
ELSA and NHANES allowed international comparisons in
large representative cohorts, a key strength of this paper, but
some limitations exist. Several covariates that might influence
diabetes risk were unavailabledequivalent collection of physical
activity or dietary information and medication intakes. Evidence
suggests that while more recently developed antihypertensive
medications are not diabetogenic, older treatments increase
diabetes risk.29 We cannot examine antihypertensive medication
in detail, but speculate that, while physical activity and dietary
intake may play a role, antihypertensive medication prescribing
practices are similar in America and England and are unlikely to
affect these international differences.
Two powerful conclusions follow from this research. Higher
American rates of diabetes compared with England were largely
due to a combination of high waist among Americans and
a higher impact of waist risk among Americans. The reasons
may be related to measures that were not available such as
objective measures of physical activity and dietary intake.
This combination of higher waist and higher risk of high
waist in America explained virtually all excess diabetes of
American women and almost half for American men. BMI alone
failed to explain any of these differences. Besides this key
substantive conclusion, our results showed that modelling
diabetes successfully requires good measures of waist risk,
particularly in populations that might differ in distributions of
body fat like the US and English. Similar issues should be
investigated for other cardiovascular disease and countries.

What is already known on this subject
< Middle-aged and older Americans have twice the rate of
diabetes prevalence compared with England.
< This differential is not explained by conventional risk factors
including age, smoking, social position and BMI.
What this study adds
< Middle-aged and older American men and particularly
American women have much higher waist circumference
compared with the English.
< High waist circumference measured continuously was far
more important than BMI in predicting diabetes prevalence.
< Higher diabetes in America than in England was largely
accounted for by higher American waist circumference and
larger impacts of high waist on diabetes in America.
