There is ample research showing that there are health disparities
for minorities with respect to seeking mental health services in the
United States. Although there are general barriers for minorities in
seeking service health, minority women are more vulnerable due
to their negative experiences and lower satisfaction in receiving
health care, compared to men. This study utilized the National
Latino and Asian American Study (NLAAS) data set, which is the
first population-based mental health study on Latino and Asian
Americans, to give a full description of Latina and Asian American
women's experience in mental health service seeking and identi-
fies the opportunities in increasing their satisfaction levels. The
results showed that perceived discrimination attributed to gender
or race/ethnicity is negatively predicting levels of satisfaction of
mental health service seeking. Older age, higher education levels,
longer duration in the United States, and better mental health,
are positively related to satisfaction levels for Latina and Asian
American women.

Effects of Discrimination and Acculturation 47
INTRODUCTION
As a profession, social work represents a major part of health and mental
health practice in the United States. Compared with psychiatry and clinical
psychology, the profession has long taken the lead in issues related to
race, ethnicity, and gender-related disparity (National Association of Social
Workers [NASW], 2007). However, there is a need for more evidence-based
research on this topic to keep up with the profession's practice-based leader-
ship role on the national stage. The Latino and Asian American populations
have been rapidly increasing in the United States (Passel & Cohn, 2008;
U.S. Census Bureau, 2002). Nevertheless, there is scant research to present
information about mental health service in these two subgroups.
Minorities frequently receive health care that is inadequate with respect
to quantity and quality (Briggance & Burke, 2002; Jones, Cason, & Bond,
2002). One of the most significant factors contributing to ethnic disparities
in health care is social and economic inequality (Nazroo, 2003; Seguin,
Potvin, St-Denis, & Loiselle, 1999; Snowden, 2003). Another contributing
factor is the inability of providers to recognize the cultural barriers faced by
their minority patients (Ivey & Faust, 2001; Sherer, 2003; Snowden, 2003).
Still others have to do with a culturally based stigma connected to mental
illness. Snowden (2003) theorized that health care disparities among mi-
norities occur due to the clinicians and mental health administrators making
``unwarranted judgments about people on the basis of race or ethnicity.'' It is
imperative that providers respect their ethnic minority patients and patients'
cultural beliefs and health practices. Ngo-Metzger, Legedza, and Phillips
(2004) recommended that providers must try to understand and incorporate
cultural understanding into their health care practice. These problems were
exacerbated in a managed care setting employing gatekeepers in which
ethnic minorities were less likely than White patients to receive appropriate
care (Cooper et al., 2003; Hargraves, Cunningham, & Hughes, 2001; Shi,
Forrest, von Schrader, & Ng, 2003; Van Ryn & Fu, 2003).
Culture-related identity and family structure in minority groups may vary
and may significantly affect their service needs and help-seeking behaviors
involved. For example, in Hispanic families, identity is often derived from
being a member of a group, rather than being an individual (Ivey & Faust,
2001). Hispanic males and elders advise family members regarding decisions
and become privy to a great deal of information; therefore, it may be unac-
ceptable in that culture for a youngster to accompany his mother to serve as
a translator (Haffner, 1992; Sherer, 2003). Ivey and Faust (2001) noted that
having family members as translators may cause potential stress and also
introduce bias, causing errors in the translation of symptoms and medical
history. Hispanics feel compelled to appear agreeable to their physicians out
of respect and courtesy, and as a result, these patients fail to question their
physicians without understanding them (Haffner, 1992). More important,
48 B. Huang et al.
ethnic minority patients would like providers to respect their culturally based
health beliefs and practices, and providers must recognize and understand
the cultural differences (Ngo-Metzger et al., 2004). It has been suggested to
learn the cultural differences among ethnic groups and also address cultural
differences before psychotherapy begins (LaRoche & Maxie, 2003).
Further, mental health providers from a mainstream background may
lack of knowledge about culture-related mental health manifestations. In
Asian American cultures, for example, somatic symptoms and nonverbal
expressions are more culturally accepted and less stigmatized (Herrick &
Brown, 1998). The lack of culturally appropriate services contributes to
the low levels of mental health usage for Asian Americans (Okazaki, 2000;
Takeuchi & Kramer, 1995; Takeuchi, Sue, & Yeh, 1995). Takeuchi et al.
(1998) found that Chinese immigrants and native-born Chinese living in Los
Angeles County were better served with ethnically matched health services.
Asian Americans are usually hesitant to seek services for their emotional
needs (Cheung & Snowden, 1990; Ying & Hu, 1994). This may be due in
part to health beliefs, centered in oriental medicine, taking a holistic view of
physical health and mental health rather than separating them (Ai, in press).
Emotional problems are closely associated with organ-based health, though
these organ functions are systematic as functionally described rather than
anatomically described (Ai, in press). Perhaps for the same reason, research
has found that Latinos living in the United States have underused mental
health services, and this is troubling from the standpoint of research and in
clinical practice (Vega & Lopez, 2001; Wang et al., 2005).
Women of color may face double barriers. Hispanic women make up
a disproportionate number of insured patients (Jones et al., 2002). They
faced barriers such as lack of education, low income, and single status that
prevent them from making their postpartum check-up visits (Jones et al.,
2002; Miranda et al., 2003). Minority women with low socioeconomic status
(SES) and inadequate social support networks have an increased risk of de-
pression (Cunningham & Zayas, 2002). On the other hand, minority women
do have a heightened need for appropriate mental health care (Diala et al.,
2001). Noh and Kasper (2003), for example, showed a significant association
between perceived discrimination against Korean immigrants and depressive
symptoms. Mental health issues may manifest themselves as gastrointestinal
symptoms or chest pains in Hispanics, or complaints of dizziness in Asians
(McCarthy, 2001). The manifestation of distress, negative emotion, and de-
pression among Hispanics and Asians are more somatic than emotional
(Takeuchi, Chun, Gong, & Shen, 2002). As shown in the Diagnostic and
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 4th edition (DSM-IV), the cultural
variations of certain mental health issues, such as ``hwa-byung'' in Korean
housewives, ``blacking out'' in Caribbean women, ``koro'' in Malaysians,
``locura'' in Latino and Latina, and qi-gong psychotic reaction in Chinese
(pp. 844­849; also see Ai, in press), may not be fully understandable by
Effects of Discrimination and Acculturation 49
mental health professionals from the mainstream backgrounds in the United
States.
The key to improving the utilization of mental health service for
Latina and Asian American women therefore lies in the improvement of
provider­patient relationship. As a start, social workers and major mental
health providers should know better whether the existing service is meeting
women's basic needs. A study by Ayanian et al. (2005) identified that
Hispanics reported more problems with coordinationof health care, and non-
English-speaking Hispanic patients reported more problems with their health
care providers. Similarly, Asian Americans patients rated their health care
experience poorly compared to Whites (Haviland, Morales, Reise, & Hays,
2003). Taira et al. (1997) reported that Asian Americans rated their overall
satisfaction with their primary care physician lower than that of Whites in
their cross-sectional study of 502 patients. Likewise, Hunt, Gaba, and Lavizzo-
Mourey's (2005) study showed that ethnic minorities were more likely than
Whites to have lower levels of trust and satisfaction with their physicians.
Moreover, Ngo-Metzger et al.'s (2004) study revealed that Asian Americans
were less likely to report positive interactions with their physicians than
were White patients. Additionally, results from the Consumer Assessment of
Health Plans Study of 47,300 Medicaid enrollees showed that racial/ethnic
and linguistic minorities reported worse care than did Whites (Weech-
Maldonado, Morales, Elliott, Spritzer, Marshall, & Hays, 2003).
Taken together, it is likely that discrimination and acculturation-related
issues may contribute to the lack of service seeking and satisfaction among
Latina and Asian American women. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed
the data from the national study on Latina and Asian American population,
conducted as part of the Collaborative Psychiatric Epidemiology Studies
(CPES) (Heeringa et al., 2004; Kessler et al., 2004; Pennell et al., 2004). The
main purpose of the CPES was to collect data on the prevalence and patterns
of mental disorders and their treatment patterns in U.S. adults (Heeringa
et al., 2004). The National Latino Asian American Study (NLAAS) adapted
its research design (e.g., procedure, main questionnaire about sociodemo-
graphics and mental health issues) from the National Comorbidity Survey
(NCS), in which the sample sizes were relatively small for ethnic minorities,
specifically for Asians (Kessler et al., 1994; Wang et al., 2005). The NLAAS
is specifically designed to integrate the psychiatric epidemiologic data and
psychiatric disorders of Latinos and Asian Americans (Alegria et al., 2004).
To date, new and limited publications on the NLAAS data noted that Asian
women born outside the United States were less likely than U.S.-born women
to experience a mental disorder during their lifetime (Abe-Kim et al., 2006).
For the purpose of the current study, we selected only Latina and
Asian American women who had sought mental health service within the
past 12 months. Based on the literature, we hypothesize that discrimination
attributed to race and/or gender issues would negatively affect satisfaction
50 B. Huang et al.
with service provided. However, we also expect other influences from ac-
culturation may be related to better outcomes. Finally, mental health status
and certain demographics were selected as controls.
METHOD
Participants and Sample Design
Based on the model of the National Comorbidity Study Replication (NCS-R)
and the National Survey of American Life (Alegria et al., 2004), the NLAAS
became the first population-based national survey for Latino and Asian Amer-
ican. The NLAAS questionnaire was available in six languages: English, Span-
ish, Mandarin, Cantonese, Tagalog, and Vietnamese. Instruments include so-
cial demographic variables, mental health screening and diagnosis variables,
service usage and evaluations, and acculturation and immigration items,
among others.
The sampling procedure for the NLAAS was previously documented,
and weights were developed to correct for sampling bias (Alegria et al., 2004;
Heeringa et al., 2004). The total sample size of the NLAAS is 4,649, including
2,554 Latinos, and 2,095 Asian Americans, among them, 1,427 Latina and
1,097 Asian American women. However, it is worth noting that, among
Asian descendents, this national study mainly targeted the three diverse
major subgroups with respect to SES, namely those with Chinese, Filipino,
and Vietnamese heritage. However, the survey did not target those in other
major Asian American subgroups with above-average SES, such as Eastern
Indian, Japanese, and Korean descendents (U.S. Census Bureau, 2002).
In the current study, we used 268 Latina and Asian American women
who had been seeking mental health service in the past 12 months (n D 188
for Latina, and n D 80 for Asian American women).
Measures
The dependent variable in this study is satisfaction of service use. The
variable used to select the sample was service usage. Respondents in the
NLAAS survey were asked the types of mental health services they used
with these questions: ``How many visits did you make to a (provider list)
in the past 12 months?'' These providers include psychiatrist, psychologist,
other mental health professional, general practitioner, nurse, occupational
therapist or other health professional, social worker, counselor and religious
or spiritual advisors, and any other healers). This variable was dichotomously
coded (0 D none, 1 D at least once). For every kind of providers the women
went to see in the last 12 years, they were asked about their satisfaction
with care received with the question ``In general, how satisfied are you with
Effects of Discrimination and Acculturation 51
the treatments and services you received from [service provider] in the past
12 months--very satisfied, satisfied, neither satisfied or dissatisfied, or very
dissatisfied?'' In the current study, we average the satisfaction scores, if the
women had gone to different kind of service providers, and use the mean
as the general satisfaction for mental service.
Based on literature review, we have included the major independent
variables as following: acculturation, discrimination, and reason for discrim-
ination. Acculturation is measured by English-language proficiency, using
an average of three items, self reported, on how well they speak, read,
and write English (Cronbach's alpha is 0.98); Discrimination was assessed
using the nine-question asking in the day-to-day life how often these things
happen to you, for example, ``you were treated with less courtesy than other
people.'' The internal consistency for this nine-item scale in this sample was
0.88. We used the mean of the nine items, and the mean is around 2. With 1
means never and 6 means almost every day, the overall mean in this sample
is around ``less than once a year.'' However, only about one fourth of the
women never had any discrimination toward her. Reason for discrimination
was measured by the answer to the questions: what do you think was the
main reason for these experiences, we grouped the answers ``your ancestry
or national origin or ethnicity'' ``gender or sex,'' and ``your race'' together
versus other reasons such as ``your age'' ``your sexual orientation,'' and ``your
weight,'' because we feel that the first three options are discrimination, that
is, speak to the fact that we were focusing on discrimination that is specific
to Latina and Asian American women. The resulting dichotomous variables
showed that among the 268 women, 35.1% feel that the discrimination she
experienced is the result of her being a Latina or Asian woman. The women
who had never had any discrimination experiences are coded 0 for this item.
For controls, we used age, education, and income, race/ethnicity (Latina
or Asian in our sample), U.S. born, and years in the United States, and mental
health self-rating. Income is measured using an index as the ratio to poverty
threshold. Years in the United States is categorized as 0 to 5, 6 to 10, 11 to 20,
and 21 years and beyond). The mental health self-rating was assessed with
one question: ``How would you rate your overall mental health--Excellent,
very good, good, fair or poor?''
ANALYSIS AND RESULTS
Descriptive Analysis
Table 1 shows characteristics of women respondents on whom they seek
for health care and the number of visits in the past 12 months. For service
utilization, 607 of the female respondents in NLAAS (24%) have seen at least
one of the nine kinds of professional for mental health issues in their lifetime.

And, 268 of the women (10.6%) have gone to see at least one those profes-
sionals in the past 12 months. In our sample of 268, if a woman went to seek
help, most likely, she went to general practitioner for help (47%), followed
by psychiatrist (one of three). Only 12% used a social worker for help.
The statistics of the dependent and predictor variables used in the
analysis are presented in Table 2. In the current analysis, satisfaction is
the outcome, dependent variable of the proposed regression analysis, with
higher score meaning higher levels of satisfaction. As shown in Table 2,
among the 268 women we are studying, the average score of satisfaction
ranges from 1 to 5, with 1 indicating very dissatisfied and 5 indicating very
satisfied, and mean of 4 indicating satisfied.
Among the 268 women in our analysis, age ranges from 18 to 88, with
a median at 41; education level ranges from fourth grade or less to 17 years
or more, with a median of 12th grade; income is measured using the 2001
Census household income-to-needs ratio; there are 40.3% of the sample who
are born in United States, and for the years in United States, the U.S.-born

were assigned the highest categories. In the current study sample, the mental
health self-rated has a mean of ``good,'' and few people choose the extreme
values.
MULTIVARIATE REGRESSION
The analysis plan is to run multiple regressions to test which variables are
significant after controlling of other potential predictors. Weights are used in
all regression attempts to account for sampling bias. There seems to be no
difference between Asian and Latina in terms of service seeking satisfaction.
The final regression results (N D 268) are presented in Table 3. With
df D 10, and F D 4.283, the R2 (.143) indicated that the multiple regression
model explained 14.3% of the variance in Latina and Asian women's mental
health­seeking satisfaction. As expected, mental health self-rating is closely
related to satisfaction, with higher level of mental health rating indicating
higher satisfaction. For our main hypothesis, the results showed that levels of
discrimination are not predicting levels of satisfaction; however, if the reason
of discriminating is perceived to be because of race/ethnicity or gender, it
leads to a lower level of satisfaction. For our secondary hypothesis, higher
level of English proficiency does not predicts higher level of satisfaction;
Being U.S. born alone does not predict satisfaction; however, longer years
of being in the United States is associated with higher levels of satisfaction.
Furthermore, education is also significantly predicting satisfaction level, with
higher level of education predicts higher level of satisfaction. Age has a pos-
itive relationship with satisfaction level. When other variables are controlled
for, poverty level or income does not predict satisfaction.

DISCUSSION
The current study may be the first to demonstrate the satisfaction pattern
among Latina and Asian American women who sought mental health service
over the past 12 months when the NLAAS was conducted. Not surprisingly,
the rate of service seeking is low, consistent with the general report from this
database (Alegria et al., 2007). Interestingly, some significant predictors for
satisfaction for service in the NLAAS are consistent with the finding for other
minority groups with respect to age and education (Jackson, Chamerlin, &
Kroenke, 2001; Sitzia & Wood, 1997). Similar to Abe-Kim et al.'s (2006) study,
for Latino and Asian Americans, the immigration factor in terms of years in
the United States is very important to mental health service seeking and
evaluations. This indicates that this acculturation related variable is a key to
accept the U.S. type of mental health services. Most of service seekers were
born outside of United States. Nonetheless, though the years in the United
States predict satisfaction levels significantly, being born in the United States
alone does not predict satisfaction level. It is also interesting to see that
income level is not a significant predictor in the current study.
The most novel finding in this analysis was that multivariate analysis
singled out that race and gender-based discrimination, rather than simple
frequency of discrimination experience, has the direct and independent effect
on service satisfaction. This finding not only lends strong support for our pri-
mary hypothesis, but also highlights the fact of the quality of discrimination
perceived by Latina and Asian American women overweighs its quantity
in the count for service-seeking satisfaction. Discrimination perceived by
minorities may impose negative impacts in general; however, for women of
color, if the discrimination is perceived to be because of being a woman or
because of being of color, the satisfaction of service seeking is especially
lower. Clearly, this finding will warrant the greater future research attention
among social workers and social scientists in the mental health professions.
The perceived reason for discrimination experience is especially noted that
we need not only study discrimination but also investigate the perceived
reason at a deep level with a more culture oriented perspective as well.
Another noteworthy factor lies in education, also standing out as pre-
dicting satisfaction level, contrasting with English proficiency that is not
predictive. Indeed, education, as a factor of individuals' early-life SES, may
be considered as one important faction of acculturation. This is because
in general race issues tend to interplay with social class problems in the
United States and in other countries where immigrants might be born. Certain
groups, due to better SES in their origins, might have already expose to
the U.S. or Western culture even before they came to the United States. In
contrast, those who were born in the minority and low SES communities
within the poor living environment (e.g., poor areas where Mexican Ameri-
can farmers reside or Chinese Americans with low education in the inner-city
Effects of Discrimination and Acculturation 55
Chinatowns) may have a slow process to adapt to the mainstream culture
characteristics even after immigrating for generations. These findings thus
bear some theoretical and clinical significance in that they provide insights
to what is actually at stake--English proficiency is important in women's
life, however, getting a higher level of education may be more beneficial
to move up alongside social ladders. Unlike age or years in the United
States, education and perceived reason for discrimination can be modified,
if professional effort can be made to prevent or intervene in a culturally
sensitive manner. In other words, the two significant variables are individual
or group characters that could be changed through some effort by mental
health professions and beyond.
The current study has important implications for the research, education,
and practice of mental health professions in general and social work in
particular with respect to their roles in the U.S. public health. According to
a national study of licensed social workers from the Center for Workforce
Studies by Whitaker, Weismiller, and Clark (2006), the top two practice areas
for licensed social workers are the areas of mental health (39%) and health
(13%), with 56% of health care social workers practicing within hospital
settings. Approximately 5 of 10 jobs in social work were in health care
and social assistance settings, and 41% of social workers in 2006 were em-
ployed in medical and mental health settings (Bureau of Labor Statistics,
2008). According to the Social Work Imperatives adopted at the National
Association of Social Work Congress on March 2005, one key imperative
was that social workers as a profession must ``elevate the public's aware-
ness of the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of social work practice in health
care.'' Along with the diversification and aging trends of the U.S. population,
social workers will play an increasingly critical role in health and mental
health care.
To echo the profession's call, social work must demonstrate its profes-
sional service satisfaction with the disadvantaged populations such as Latinos
and Asian Americans. As rapidly growing subgroups, the current study clearly
indicates their service challenges to social worker providers, as well as other
professions in mental and physical health. In addition to the need for more
research, educational formats and content must be modified at all levels
in schools of social work to expand the skills of social workers. However,
first of all, social work professors need to integrate the knowledge about
health beliefs and seeking behaviors in these hard-working but care-wise
disparity subgroups. Furthermore, to deal more effectively with their unmet
mental health needs, social issues in relation to their race, ethnicity, and
gender must be addressed in curricular development. Culture-based stigmas
and name-calling myths, such as immigrants who steal Americans' jobs typi-
cally tied to Latino Americans, and the so-called model immigrants typically
attached to Asian Americans, should be clarified first among professionals
and educators.
56 B. Huang et al.
Finally, and more important, the current and new generations of social
workers need more in-school and postgraduate refreshment education on
the diversity-based population change and the rising recognition of the
behavioral impact on public health. It can be envisaged that there will
be a rise in need for the permanent role of social work in public health
and primary care to reduce race, ethnicity, and gender-based disparities
while saving costs for hiring more costly nurses, clinical psychologists, and
psychiatrists in these areas. As such, we must endorse the integration of
health and mental health components in curricular development rather than
continuing the conventional overspecialized social work education. How-
ever, most important, our professionals need to enhance their capacities in
assessment and treatment of these mental health disorders on the basis of
the culturally sensitive practice.
Certain limitations inherent in the current study should be noted. The
current study is based on a cross sectional sample and is not an intervention
study. Findings here thus do not inform causality. Limited by sample size, we
do not present exact satisfaction rates for social work services. Furthermore,
as noted above, the three Asian American populations in the NLAAS mostly
excluded some major subgroups with the on-average better-off SES, which
may have certain impacts on the understanding of the interplay between
acculturation and SES in Latino and Asian Americans as two with more new
immigrants. There is the likelihood that with higher education these unde-
tected subgroups may share more similarity with mainstream Americans in
terms of mental health service seeking. Perhaps in part due to this exclusion,
the effect size in this analysis is modest. However, these assumptions must be
tested when the national survey includes these major subgroups who number
in the millions (U.S. Census Bureau, 2002). Although this new design may
not be attainable in a short term, more in-depth studies, including qualitative
ones, can be done to explore the undetected predictors and to cover and
represent wide range of ethnic groups. Another limitation of the current study
is the survey questionnaire does not include items on the characteristics of
the providers. Race, gender, and age discordances are factors in patient-
provider satisfaction research, which have special cultural meanings for Asian
and Latina women who seek mental health care.
In summary, the current study demonstrates that race and gender-based
discrimination, as well as several acculturation-related variables (e.g., years
in the United States and education) are significant predictors for satisfaction
of service seeking among women of Hispanic and Asian origin. It provides
us with opportunity in future prevention programs. The current study opens
a door for further exploring the effects of discrimination based on gender
and ethnicity. Mechanisms underlying the predictions of these factors for
the satisfaction with mental health service-seeking behaviors should also
be explored in the future for improvement for Latina and Asian American
women, two rapidly growing U.S. subpopulations.
