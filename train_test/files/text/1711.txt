OBJECTIVE -- Impaired fasting glucose (IFG) and/or impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) are
considered to constitute "pre-diabetes." We estimated the prevalence of IFG, IGT, and pre-
diabetes among U.S. adolescents using data from a nationally representative sample.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS -- We analyzed data from participants aged
12­19 years in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2005­2006. We used
fasting plasma glucose and 2-h glucose during an oral glucose tolerance test to assess the
prevalence of IFG, IGT, and pre-diabetes and used the log-binomial model to estimate the
prevalence ratios (PRs) and 95% CIs.
RESULTS -- The unadjusted prevalences of IFG, IGT, and pre-diabetes were 13.1, 3.4, and
16.1%, respectively. Boys had a 2.4-fold higher prevalence of pre-diabetes than girls (95% CI
1.3­4.3). Non-Hispanic blacks had a lower rate than non-Hispanic whites (PR 0.6, 95% CI
0.4­0.9). Adolescents aged 16­19 years had a lower rate than those aged 12­15 years (0.6,
0.4­0.9). Overweight adolescents had a 2.6-fold higher rate than those with normal weight
(1.3­5.1). Adolescents with two or more cardiometabolic risk factors had a 2.7-fold higher rate
than those with none (1.5­4.8). Adolescents with hyperinsulinemia had a fourfold higher
prevalence (2.2­7.4) than those without. Neither overweight nor number of cardiometabolic
risk factors was significantly associated with pre-diabetes after adjustment for hyperinsulinemia.
CONCLUSIONS -- Pre-diabetes was highly prevalent among adolescents. Hyperinsulin-
emia was independently associated with pre-diabetes and may account for the association of
overweight and clustering of cardiometabolic risk factors with pre-diabetes.
Diabetes Care 32:342­347, 2009
Individuals with impaired fasting glu-
cose (IFG) and/or impaired glucose tol-
erance (IGT) are at increased risk for
diabetes and cardiovascular-related death
(1,2). The state of abnormal glucose me-
tabolism characterized as IFG and/or IGT
has been referred to as "pre-diabetes" (3).
Previous studies of IGT among chil-
dren and adolescents have been largely
limited to those with obesity, a family his-
tory of diabetes, or multiple cardiometa-
bolic risk factors. The prevalence
estimates of IGT varied from 4 to 21% in
previous studies (4­7). Although IGT
prevalence estimates among overweight
adolescents is helpful in understanding
the absolute health risk associated with
IGT in this special population, the relative
health burden of IGT among overweight
adolescents compared with that among
adolescents of normal weight has not
been established. In a few school-based
studies, the prevalence of IGT is estimated
to range from 0.3 to 2.3%, and the prev-
alence of IFG is estimated to vary from 6.7
to 40.5% (8­10). However, because the
samples for these studies were selected
from students at a small number of
schools in narrow geographic areas, these
results may not be generalizable to the
entire U.S. adolescent population.
Estimates based on National Health
and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES) data indicated that the preva-
lence of IFG among U.S. adolescents aged
12­19 years was 7% during 1999­
2000 (11). However, NHANES did not
collect IGT data on U.S. adolescents be-
fore 2005­2006. To estimate the preva-
lence of IGT, IFG, and pre-diabetes
among U.S. adolescents aged 12­19 years
and to assess selected correlates of these
dysglycemic states, we thus examined the
NHANES 2005­2006 data.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND
METHODS -- The NHANES 2005­
2006 sample was drawn from the nonin-
stitutionalized civilian U.S. population,
and a multistage, stratified sampling de-
sign was used to recruit survey partici-
pants (12,13). NHANES 2005­2006
includes oversamples of low-income indi-
viduals, adolescents aged 12­19 years,
African Americans, and Mexican Ameri-
cans. A total of 2,689 adolescents aged
12­19 years (population size
33,448,181) were selected, 2,288 were
interviewed (response rate 85.0%; inter-
view sample), and 2,207 were examined
(response rate, 82.0%). There were 1,041
boys and nonpregnant girls aged 12­19
years randomly assigned to a morning
session. After having fasted for 8­24 h,
871 (83.7%) were tested for fasting
plasma glucose (FPG subsample). Of
those in the FPG subsample, 781 (89.7%)

were tested for an oral glucose tolerance
test (OGTT subsample).
Details of NHANES laboratory proce-
dures have been described elsewhere
(12,13). In brief, blood specimens were
frozen and stored at 70°C until analysis.
The plasma glucose concentration was
determined with a hexokinase method on
a Roche/Hitachi 911 analyzer at the Fair-
view Medical Center Laboratory of the
University of Minnesota. After an initial
blood sample was drawn for FPG testing,
participants were asked to drink a cali-
brated dose of Trutol (75 g glucose). Two
hours (15 min) later, a second plasma
sample was drawn and tested for postload
glucose concentrations. To maintain con-
sistency with previous NHANES surveys,
we converted glucose concentrations as
follows: glucose (Cobas Mira) 
0.9835  glucose (Hitachi 911) (13).
HDL cholesterol was measured di-
rectly in serum with Roche/Boehringer-
Mannheim diagnostics. Serum triglyceride
was determined in a sequence of three
coupled enzymatic steps involving glyc-
erol kinase, glycerophosphate oxidase,and
horseradish peroxidase. Serum insulin was
measured with the Merocodia Insulin
ELISA (13). Homeostasis model assess-
ment (HOMA  [glucose (millimoles per
liter)  insulin (microunits per millili-
ter)]/22.5) was used as a measure of insu-
lin resistance (IR) (14). Adolescents with
fasting insulin or HOMA 75th percen-
tile cutoff value were considered to have
hyperinsulinemia or HOMA-IR.
Participants' BMI (weight in kilo-
grams divided by the square of height in
meters) was calculated from their mea-
sured weight and height. The BMI percen-
tile was used to categorize participants'
weight status as normal (85th percen-
tile), at risk of becoming overweight
(85th­94th percentile), and overweight
(95th percentile) (15). Participants'
waist circumference was measured at the
level of the iliac crest on the midaxillary
line at minimal respiration to the nearest
0.1 cm (13). The mean blood pressure
was calculated as the average of the sec-
ond and third readings for those who had
three measurements, the second reading
for those who had two measurements,
and the only reading for those who had
one measurement (13).
Definitions of IFG, IGT, and pre-
diabetes
An adolescent is considered to have a pro-
visional diagnosis of diabetes if his or her
FPG is 7.0 mmol/l (126 mg/dl) or 2-h
glucose is 11.1 mmol/l (200 mg/dl).
IFG was defined as having FPG 5.6
mmol/l (100 mg/dl) but 7.0 mmol/l
(126 mg/dl). IGT was defined as having
2-h glucose 7.8 mmol/l (140 mg/dl) but
11.1 mmol/l (200 mg/dl). Pre-diabetes
was defined as having IFG and/or IGT (3).
Definitions of cardiometabolic risk
factors
The International Federation of Diabetes
criteria were used to determine whether
participants had any of the four condi-
tions that are part of the metabolic syn-
drome (i.e., central obesity, high
triglycerides, low HDL cholesterol, and
high blood pressure) (16,17). For all ad-
olescents, a high triglyceride level was de-
fined as 1.7 mmol/l (150 mg/dl), and
high blood pressure was defined as a sys-
tolic blood pressure 130 mmHg or a
diastolic blood pressure 85 mmHg
(16,17). For adolescents aged 12­15
years, central obesity was defined as a
waist circumference 90th percentile,
and low HDL cholesterol was defined as
1.03 mmol/l (40 mg/dl). For adoles-
cents aged 16­19 years, the International
Federation of Diabetes sex- and race/
ethnicity-specific cutoff values of waist
circumference (i.e., white males 94 cm,
African American males 94 cm, Mexi-
can-American males 90 cm, white fe-
males 80 cm, African American females
80 cm, and Mexican-American females
80 cm) were used to define central obe-
sity. Sex-specific cutoff values of HDL
cholesterol (i.e., 1.03 mmol/l [40 mg/
dl] in males and 1.29 mmol/l [50 mg/
dl] in females) were used to define low
HDL cholesterol (16). Current use of pre-
scribed antihypertensive medicines for
the treatment of previously diagnosed hy-
pertension was considered to be high
blood pressure.
Statistical analysis
We calculated the unadjusted prevalence
of IFG, IGT, and pre-diabetes by sex, race/
ethnicity, age, BMI categories, number of
cardiometabolic risk factors, hyperinsu-
linemia, and HOMA-IR. Appropriate
sampling weights of the interview sample
and FPG or OGTT subsample were used
to obtain the population prevalence esti-
mates for U.S. adolescents aged 12­19

years. In addition, we estimated the un-
adjusted and adjusted prevalence ratios
(PRs) and their 95% CIs using a multiva-
riable log-binomial model (18). We per-
formed all analyses using SAS (version
9.1; SAS Institute, Cary, NC) and
SUDAAN software (release 9.0; Research
Triangle Institute, Research Triangle
Park, NC) to account for the complex
sampling design. We considered results
with a two-tailed P  0.05 to be statisti-
cally significant.
RESULTS
Demographic characteristics
In the interview sample, there were 1,133
boys and 1,155 girls. There were 578
non-Hispanic whites, 782 non-Hispanic
blacks, 747 Mexican Americans, and 181
adolescents with other race/ethnicity. The
mean age was 15.5 years. Demographic
characteristics in the FPG and OGTT sub-
samples were similar to those of the inter-
view sample.
Prevalence of diagnosed diabetes
and pre-diabetes
There were seven adolescents who re-
ported having diagnosed diabetes
(weighted prevalence  SE 0.23 
0.14%), of whom two used insulin, two
used oral hypoglycemic agents, and three
did not use either insulin or hypoglyce-
mic agents. Thirty adolescents reported
having either diagnosed borderline diabe-
tes or pre-diabetes (weighted prevalence
0.91  0.24%).
Prevalence of diabetes based on FPG
and 2-h glucose
There were six adolescents who met the
FPG diabetes criteria (weighted preva-
lence 0.49  0.33%). Of these six, four
reported having diabetes and two did not
(undiagnosed diabetes 0.06  0.04%).
No adolescents met the 2-h glucose dia-
betes criteria.
Prevalence of IFG, IGT, and pre-
diabetes
To estimate the prevalence of IFG, IGT,
and pre-diabetes, we further excluded
two participants with diagnosed diabetes
and two participants with an FPG 7.0
mmol/l. The unadjusted IFG, IGT, and
pre-diabetes prevalence rates are shown
in Table 1.
Of the 777 adolescents, 660 (popula-
tion-weighted proportion, 83.9%) had nei-
ther IFG nor IGT, 94 (12.6%) had only IFG
(isolatedIFG),18(3.0%)hadonlyIGT(iso-
lated IGT), and 5 (0.5%) had both IFG and
IGT. The weighted proportions of isolated
IFG, isolated IGT, and both IFG and IGT
were 78.7, 18.4, and 2.9%, respectively.
The prevalence of IFG, IGT, and pre-
diabetes was each positively associated
with the number of cardiometabolic risk
factors that participants had (Fig. 1A).
Overweight adolescents with hyperinsu-
linemia had a higher prevalence of IFG
(P  0.05), IGT (P  0.05), and pre-
diabetes (P  0.05) than those of normal
weight with normal insulin (Fig. 1B).
The unadjusted prevalence of pre-
diabetes was higher among boys than
among girls (P  0.001), lower among
non-Hispanic blacks than among non-
Hispanic whites (P  0.05) and Mexican
Americans (P  0.05; data not shown),
lower among adolescents aged 16­19
than among those aged 12­15 (P  0.05),
and 2.6 times higher among adolescents
who were overweight than among those
of normal weight (P  0.05) (Table 2,
model 1). The prevalence ratios between
adolescents with and without pre-

diabetes altered slightly but remained sta-
tistically significant after adjustments for
sex, race/ethnicity, age, weight status, and
number of cardiometabolic risk factors
(Table 2, model 2).
Adolescents who had two or more of
the four cardiometabolic risk factors had a
2.7-fold higher unadjusted rate of pre-
diabetes than those with no risk factors
(P  0.001) (Table 2, model 1) and a 2.3-
fold higher prevalence than those with
one risk factor (95% CI 1.2­4.4; P 
0.01; data not shown). Moreover, the un-
adjusted prevalence of pre-diabetes was
four times higher among adolescents with
hyperinsulinemia than among those with
fasting insulin 75th percentile (P 
0.01) (Table 2, model 1). However, age,
weight status, and number of cardiometa-
bolic risk factors were no longer signifi-
cantly associated with pre-diabetes
prevalence after adjustment for hyperin-
sulinemia (Table 2, model 3).
Adolescents with IFG, IGT, or pre-
diabetes had a higher geometric mean of
fasting insulin (Fig. 2A) and HOMA (Fig.
2B) than those without these conditions
(all P  0.01). The mean  SE fasting
insulin value of adolescents with isolated
IGT (101.0  15.4 pmol/l) and that of
those with isolated IFG (94.4  8.7
pmol/l) were similar (P  0.76), and both
were significantly higher than that of ad-
olescents with neither IGT nor IFG
(53.5  1.6 pmol/l) (all P 0.01; data not
shown).
CONCLUSIONS -- Using the most
recent NHANES data, we estimated that
the national population-based prevalence
rates of IFG, IGT, and pre-diabetes among
U.S. adolescents aged 12­19 years were
13.1, 3.4, and 16.1%, respectively. IFG
accounted for nearly 80% of adolescents
with pre-diabetes. Pre-diabetes risk was
positively associated with being male and
having hyperinsulinemia and negatively
associated with being a non-Hispanic
black. Moreover, hyperinsulinemia ap-
peared to account for the association of
weight status and clustering of cardiovas-
cular risk factors with pre-diabetes.
The prevalence of IGT has been found
to be high among adolescents with obe-
sity (21%) (5) or those with a positive
family history of type 2 diabetes (25%) (6)
and in particular among those with both
obesity and a positive family history of
type 2 diabetes (35%) (7). In contrast,
several school-based studies have re-
ported a relatively low prevalence of IGT.
In Poland, the prevalence of IGT was
found to be 0.3% among all children and
adolescents aged 8­19 years but 7.1%
among those who were obese (8). The re-
sults of the Studies to Treat or Prevent
Pediatric Type 2 Diabetes (STOPP-T2D)
indicated that the prevalence of IGT was
2.3% among all eighth graders in four
middle schools of Southern California,
Texas, and North Carolina but 4.1%
among those who were overweight (9). In
the Princeton School District of Cincin-
nati (10), IGT was detected among only
0.5% of 5th to 12th graders. It is possible
that sampling and geographic variations
may account for these low prevalences.
To the best of our knowledge, our study is
the first report on the prevalence estimate
of IGT using a nationally representative
sample of U.S. adolescents. Our IGT prev-
alence estimates among all adolescents
(3.4%) and among overweight adoles-
cents (9.5%) were lower than the rates
reported in clinic-based studies but
higher than the rates reported in school-
based studies.
Our estimated IFG prevalence of
13.1% among U.S. adolescents in 2005­
2006 was 87.1% higher than the 7% esti-
mated from NHANES data in 1999­2000
(11). Rapid increases in the prevalence of
central obesity (19) among adolescents
may be a factor in the increased preva-
lence of IFG. Our results indicated that
overweight adolescents had a nearly two-
fold higher prevalence of IFG than did
those with normal weight.
It is noteworthy that adolescents with
two or more of the four cardiometabolic
risk factors (i.e., central obesity, high tri-
glyceride, low HDL cholesterol, and ele-
vated blood pressure) had a significantly
higher prevalence of pre-diabetes than
those with zero or one risk factor. These
findings, which were in agreement with
those from previous studies (6,7), have
several clinical implications. The pres-
ence of two or more cardiometabolic risk
factors among adolescents may be an in-
dication that their pre-diabetes status
should be assessed. Because pre-diabetes
is an intermediate stage in the develop-
ment of type 2 diabetes and has been
shown to be reversible through pharma-
cological and lifestyle interventions (20),

early detection and appropriate manage-
ment of pre-diabetes among adolescents
could effectively prevent or delay their de-
velopment of type 2 diabetes in later life.
As previous studies have shown (5,6),
we found that adolescents with pre-
diabetes had significantly higher fasting
insulin levels than those without pre-
diabetes. In one previous study, insulin
resistance was found to be the best pre-
dictor of 2-h plasma glucose in an OGTT
among obese adolescents (5). It has been
proposed that insulin resistance is a major
underlying cause of type 2 diabetes (21),
and intramyocellular and intra-abdominal
lipid accumulation is highly associated
with the development of insulin resis-
tance (22). Our results indicated that
hyperinsulinemia or insulin resistance
may play an important role in the associ-
ation of obesity and clustering of cardio-
metabolic risk factors with pre-diabetes.
The prevalence of hyperinsulinemia has
increased by 35% in the past decade
among U.S. adults (23). Therefore, early
identification and effective treatment
of insulin resistance could prevent or
delay the occurrence of pre-diabetes and
diabetes among both adolescents and
adults (24).
Similar to the finding of a previous
study (10), our results demonstrated that
only 2.9% of adolescents with glucose in-
tolerance had both IFG and IGT. IFG and
IGT may identify different populations at
risk of developing diabetes. It has been
proposed that IFG and IGT represent dis-
tinct metabolic abnormalities with differ-
ent etiological mechanisms, with IFG
being caused by impaired basal insulin
secretion and IGT being caused primarily
by peripheral insulin resistance (25). De-
spite these etiological differences, how-
ever, IFG and IGT have both been
associated with an increased risk of devel-
oping diabetes and subsequent cardiovas-
cular disease (1­3), and, as we showed,
both are strongly associated with obesity
and clustering of cardiometabolic risk fac-
tors before adjustment for hyperinsulin-
emia. Therefore, from a public health
point of view, it seems tenable to use the
term "pre-diabetes" to describe the condi-
tion of IFG and/or IGT and to identify
adolescents at increased risk for diabetes
in later life.
Our results are subject to two limita-
tions. First, the cross-sectional design of
the NHANES study precluded a causal in-
ference among obesity, clustering of car-
diometabolic risk factors, insulin
resistance, and pre-diabetes. Future stud-
ies with a longitudinal design are war-
ranted to identify the temporal sequence
among these variables. Second, because
of the low prevalence of IGT, we were
unable to conduct separate analyses of
factors associated with IGT. Therefore,
our results for pre-diabetes may be influ-
enced mainly by IFG. However, because
our study was focused on pre-diabetes
prevalence estimates rather than its pre-
dictors, interpretation of our results may
not be affected.
In summary, the high prevalence of
pre-diabetes among adolescents has
raised public health concerns. Because
adolescents with pre-diabetes usually
have no apparent clinical symptoms,
great efforts may be needed to identify
them early and to intervene against the
root causes of insulin resistance such as
overweight, physical inactivity, and un-
healthy diet in pediatric primary care and
through public health services.
