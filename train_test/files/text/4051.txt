Introduction
This article focuses on women's use of pornography in mod-
ern Taiwan, with an eye to making sense their "claimed
preference" for American pornography. As many scholars
have pointed out (Attwood, 2002; Keith, 2001; Paasonen,
2007), early studies of pornography tended either to frame
pornography in terms of an effects tradition or a feminist tra-
dition that has focused on articulation of personal "affect"
(e.g., Allen, d'Alessio, & Brezgel, 1995; Fisher & Grenier,
1994; Malamuth & Check, 1981; Padgett, Brislin-Slutz, &
Neal, 1989; Zillman, 2000). As a result, most work is "dislo-
cated" (Juffer, 1998, p. 8) from the production, circulation,
and consumption of pornography. The academic dislocation
from pornography consumption is particularly salient
because, as Alan McKee (2005) points out, while consumers
of pornography are often objects of research, they are "rarely
presented as subjects in the sense of being the thinking agents
who could offer an insight into the reasons for consuming
pornography and the effects it could have on them" (p. 71).
Such an absence of consumers' voices is filled by a col-
lection of work that explores specifically either the gender
differences in pornography use (Brown & L'Engle, 2009; S.
J. Carroll et al., 2008; Diamond & Dannemiller, 1989; Hald,
2006; Janghorbani, Lam, & The Youth Sexuality Study Task
Force, 2003; Lo & Wei, 2005; Pan, 1993) or the impact of
romantic partners' use of pornography on women (Bergner
& Bridges, 2002; Bridges, Bergner, & Hesson-Micnnis,
2003; Schneider, 2002). All of these studies point to an
important observation: Men and women differ greatly in the
use of, and taste for, pornography.
Informative as they might be, these studies however fail
to explore the more fundamental issue as to how and why
these gender differences in pornography use and consump-
tion pattern come about. We do not mean to deny other stud-
ies on pornography use that took a broader view rather than
just focused on gender, but the failure of the abovementioned
studies to explore the issue suggests that porn studies as a

Videos Because You Like It": The Politics
of Pornography Consumption in Taiwan

Abstract
This article focuses on women's use of pornography in modern Taiwan, with an eye to making sense their "claimed"
preference for American pornography. Our research shows that men and women display vast differences in pornography use
and pornography preference with men tending to identify with Japanese adult videos and women with American pornography.
Such gendered use of pornography has been substantially documented and examined through multiple disciplinary lenses.
While illuminating, these studies tend not to examine further how such gender differences come about. It fosters an impression
that gender can be used to explain away the reasons that men and women will differ in pornography use and sex. Gender
is thus seen as universally applicable and able to explain everything without providing any concrete explanations. From this
vantage, the specific, concrete gender norms that gave rise to the differences in pornography use in different cultures are
dismissed as just manifestations of their genders. This article therefore aims to recover the specific gender norms and politics
in Taiwan, which are often lumped together and explained away as gender inclinations and see how these specific contents
gave rise to gender differences in pornography use. To understand how these gender differences ultimately come about,
one needs to first explore how and why men and women consume pornography, respectively. Elsewhere, we have explored
Taiwanese men's use of, and preference for, pornography. This article therefore aims to examine Taiwanese women's use of
pornography with reference to gender norms in Taiwan.

field is still generally underlined by a general tendency that
sees gender as universal, essentialized, primordial, bounded,
unchanging, and homogeneous. The universal gender in turn
is used to explain away the reasons that men and women will
differ in pornography use and perhaps sex. In the event, spe-
cific, concrete gender norms that gave rise to the differences
in pornography use in different cultures are dismissed as just
manifestations of their genders. Sartre's criticism of the
Marxist views on class seems point-for-point appropriate to
the essentializing use of gender in the studies of pornography
use:
Marxists formalism is a project of elimination. The method is
identical with the Terror in its inflexible refusal to differentiate;
its goal is total assimilation at the least possible effort. The aim
is not to integrate what is different as such, while preserving for
it a relative autonomy, but rather to suppress it . . . The Marxist
would believe that he was wasting his time if, for example, he
tried to understand the originality of a bourgeois thought. In his
eyes the only thing that matters is to show that the thought is a
mode of idealism . . . The Marxist is therefore impelled to take
as an appearance the real content of behaviour or of a thought;
when he dissolves the particular in the Universal, he has the
satisfaction of believing that he is reducing appearance to truth.
(Sartre, 1963/1968, pp. 48-49)
In the same way, the abovementioned studies of pornog-
raphy use dissolve the particular content in the universal con-
cept of gender. The usage of gender as a universal concept is
thus no different from what Sartre called "the Terror," which
"purged cultural forms of their specific properties by dissolv-
ing them in generic inclinations of class standing and class
interest" (Sahlins, 1999, pp. 406-407). The aim of this article
is to recover the specific gender norms and politics in Taiwan
that are often lumped together and explained away as gender
inclinations and see how these specific contents gave rise to
gender differences in pornography use.
Our data for this article are culled from the anthropologi-
cal fieldwork one of the authors conducted in Taipei between
October 2002 andAugust 2005.As part of our larger ongoing
study exploring Asian sexualities, 22 Taiwanese female
informants ranging in age between 21 and 52 were
approached for in-depth interviews. These informants were
recruited through snowballing with socioeconomic and edu-
cational backgrounds as diverse as possible. During the
interviews, we invited them to talk about their ideas and per-
ceptions of sex and sexual behaviors as women in Taiwan. In
addition, we asked them to describe extensively their use of,
and preference for, pornography over the years.
Three important discoveries are identified. Out of our 22
female informants, 18 of them expressed patent distaste for
pornography. As we pushed them further, these female infor-
mants elaborated the reasons for their "disinterest" in por-
nography. Some women explained that they have never had
a chance to watch pornography; some others confessed that
they were curious about pornography but they dared not
watch it by themselves. There were also female informants
who had watched pornography but could not find it interest-
ing because they could not find the female and male charac-
ters portrayed "real." Still others lamented that they could
not enjoy watching pornography because they were usually
interrupted and therefore could not even finish watching the
whole movie.
Second, despite their relative disinterest in pornography,
most of them tended to have experiences with pornography
especially within their dating and marital relationships. They
reported that they watched pornography mainly because of
the request of their husbands or boyfriends. Finally, despite
their overt distaste for pornography, they tended to choose
"American" rather than "Japanese" pornography when we
further asked them which type of pornography they preferred
more. We do not mean that there is a monolithic notion of
American pornography or Japanese pornography. As is
widely known, Japanese adult video (AV) is renowned for its
wide array of genres and styles (Wong & Yau, 2014), and so
is the American pornography, not to mention the fact that the
content of the genres has undergone numerous changes over
the years. On the other hand, Taiwanese people must essen-
tialize both types of pornography to make sense and integrate
them into their sexual lives. Within the Taiwanese porn mar-
ket, one should not be surprised to find out that Japanese
pornography, as well as American pornography, is often seen
as monolithic with all the styles and genres being lumped
together. Elsewhere, we showed that Taiwanese men had
tended to conflate all Japanese AVs as bishjo (beautiful
young women) AVs, the prototypical genre of Japanese AVs
(Wong & Yau, 2014). Similarly, American pornography is
typically seen as brutal, physical, vulgar, and perhaps
mechanical vis-à-vis the mosaicked (i.e., pixelated) Japanese
AV because it is by and large hard core. More importantly,
although Taiwanese, men and women alike, acknowledge the
existence of American pornography wherein the female
characters portrayed are as sexually innocent as those in
Japanese AVs, the idea that American porn actresses are sex-
ually autonomous and thus aggressive is so established and
taken-for-granted in Taiwan so much so that no one would
challenge. It must be clear that essentialization of pornogra-
phy is not only unproblematic to the Taiwanese users but also
essential for them to make sense and understand it.
As such, the objective of this article is to explore why
Taiwanese female informants lacked interest in pornogra-
phy; why they would view pornography despite lacking
interest in it and why such access was often mediated by their
male partners; and ultimately why they would "claim" that
they preferred American pornography to Japanese AVs, if
they were asked to choose.
We shall begin by exploring why women lacked interest
in pornography. We argue that women's lack of interest in
pornography is due to their failures to appreciate it, to find
the female/male characters "real," and to enjoy it. As we
shall try to show, all these have to be understood in terms of
Wong and Yau 3
the local gender norms and the local configuration of sexual
beings. The same gender norms, however, require Taiwanese
women to watch pornography with their men. Yet women are
often unable to enjoy pornography in such joint viewing
because under the norms they are supposed to accompany
their men watching rather than watch with them. The frustra-
tions arising from their simultaneous failure to reject such
pornography viewing and failure to enjoy pornography made
them see American pornography as a weapon to express their
resentment toward the male domination in sex.
A Brief History of Pornography in
Postwar Taiwan
The history of pornography in postwar Taiwan is underlined
by three important changes: a change in the types of pornog-
raphy available in Taiwan, a change in the media of pornog-
raphy, and a change in the meaning of pornography.
Despite the severe regulation of pornography under the
authoritarian Kuomintang (KMT) rule in postwar Taiwan
(Wong & Yau, 2010), it does not mean that pornography
would not exist there. Throughout the 1950s and 1960s,
Danish and Dutch pornographies were the box office guaran-
tee of cinemas in Taiwan (Yeh, 1997). This was followed by
American pornography which made its inroads into Taiwan
in the early 1970s, and soon it became the dominant form of
pornography there. However, it lost its momentum when
JapaneseAVs began to take root in Taiwan in the early 1980s.
In contrast to the early Euro-American pornographies that
have clearly showed genitalia, Japanese AVs are instead
understood as "softcore" because their portrayal of the whole
genital region including pubic hair and acts of sexual pene-
tration is airbrushed and hidden behind a so-called `mosaic'
(a form of pixelization). More importantly, Japanese AVs are
renowned for their sophisticated presentations of female
facial expression and their different genres satisfying a wide
range of deviant desires (Chang, 2004; Yeh, 1997). By the
late 1980s, Japanese AVs have gained a strong foothold in
Taiwan, finding favor mainly with the younger generation.
Although less popular than before, American pornography
remains the dominant "Other" in modern Taiwan.
A Change in the Cultural Meaning of
Pornography
As Liechty (2001) perceptively points out, the meaning of
pornography is immensely unstable, often depending on the
sociopolitical context of a given society. In the 1980s, por-
nography was seen as a symbolic protest against martial law
imposed by the KMT regime under which freedom of expres-
sion was strictly prohibited (Yeh, 1997). However, the mean-
ing of pornography underwent changes as Taiwan was
transformed into a democratic state in the 1990s. A group of
female students from the Feminist Club of National Taiwan
University, for example, attempted to challenge male domi-
nation and patriarchy through hosting a 3-day public pornog-
raphy screening at a female dormitory in 1995 (T.-y. Luo,
1997). The screening, which aimed to "provide young
women sexual imaginations that are different from the tradi-
tional romantic love," "help women understand male gaze
and attitudes," and "stimulate the dialogue of women's sex-
ual autonomy" (T.-y. Luo, 1997, p. 192), was an overnight
sensation in Taiwan. While the members of Feminist Club
became target of criticism for holding the screening, their
screening came as a wake-up call to the issue of gender
inequality among the public. As a matter of fact, feminism
gained wider currency in Taiwan than it was in other parts of
Asia, which can be seen through the large number of aca-
demic departments, both undegraduate and postgraduate,
devoted to women's/gender studies in Taiwan. One might
say that pornography has now become one of the very means
for Taiwanese women to resist patriarchy.
A Change in the Form of Media Technology
Pornographies have been available to Taiwanese customers
at cinemas since the 1950s. Yet pornographies only became
popular in the 1980s when they emerged as illegal "pro-
grams" screened on cable TV. In the early years, subscribers
of illegal adult programs could watch pornographies espe-
cially Japanese AVs once they turned on their TV sets. With
no encryption, pornographies were made accessible to any-
one insofar as they subscribed to the relevant illegal cable
operators.
In 1993, the KMT government passed the Cable Radio
and Television Law that officially legalized both the broad-
cast and use of pornography in Taiwan (H.-w. Luo, 1996).
Cable TV became the prime means through which pornogra-
phies were obtained in the 1990s. However, pornography use
over the cable TV soon lost its momentum as the state
announced in 1999 that the traditional encryption would be
replaced with the "addresssable encryption" that greatly
increased the cost of accessing to adult channels on cable TV.
By the early 2000s, many pornography users switched to
pornographic VCD as an alternative.
In Taiwan, pirated pornographic VCDs are mainly sold
through VCD retailers. However, VCD retailers are suscep-
tible to state prosecution precisely because they are fixed in
location. Moreover, VCDs are by and large to be obtained
through physical buying. The problems and inconvenience
caused by state prosecution and physical buying soon made
many Taiwanese users, especially young men, turn to the
Internet.
By the early 2000s, pornographic VCDs had given way to
an even newer form of pornography: Internet pornography,
whose popularity can be attributed to its "accessibility,"
"affordability," and "anonymity" (Cooper, 1998, p. 187).
The two major ways through which Taiwanese users obtain
free pornographies over the Internet are FTP technology
4 SAGE Open
(File Transfer Protocol) and P2P technology (Peer to Peer).
Although the exact operations of these technologies are dif-
ferent, both require a high level of technological skills: to set
up the software, configure the system, optimize the port
number, and solve various problems one might encounter
during file transfers.
Three points can be identified in light of the above brief
history of pornography in postwar Taiwan. First, although
Japanese AVs are recognized as the most popular type of por-
nography among Taiwanese men (Bih & Hong, 2006; Chang,
2004), it will be incorrect to ignore the presence of American
pornography that remains as the dominant "Other" in post-
war Taiwan. As we shall see, our women informants pre-
cisely "claimed" to prefer American pornography, which is
often seen as more respectful to women because the female
characters portrayed are sexually autonomous.
Second, the cultural meaning of pornography has changed
from a sign of democracy to a way of challenging gender
inequality in Taiwan. Since the late 1980s when Taiwan has
been transformed into a democratic state, pornography
becomes to be seen as a weapon to challenge male domina-
tion in sex in Taiwan. Our women informants, as we shall see
shortly, precisely manipulated pornography to express their
frustration about men's sexual domination in Taiwan.
Finally and more importantly, technological advances
substantially affected the way Taiwanese obtained pornogra-
phy. Pornography was first viewed as movies at cinemas.
Then, it emerged as cable program and finally became por-
nographic VCD and Internet file. It must be stressed that
technological changes had profound impact on women's
access to pornography. While most of our female informants
were frequent computer users, not many of them were famil-
iar with FTP and P2P applications. In fact, none of our female
informants used either FTP or P2P to download pornogra-
phies over the Internet. If they do need material or informa-
tion via FTP or P2P, they would likely ask their boyfriends or
brothers to do so for them. One can see that Internet use in
Taiwan remains rather gendered; it is by and large dominated
by men. However, the problem is even if Taiwanese women
are technologically equipped, they will still encounter prob-
lems instigated by the local gender norms and the local con-
figurations of sexual beings.
The Six Binary Pairs of Sex in Taiwan
In our recent joint-article (Wong & Yau, 2012), we applied
Simon Hardy's (2009) notion of "pornographic realism" to
explore the preference of Taiwanese men for Japanese AV,
especially its prototypical genre of bishjo. Hardy argues
that pornographic realism is the defining characteristic of
pornography as a representational genre. The smaller the gap
between pornographic representations of sexuality and real
sex, the more attractive the pornographic movie is. We
showed that Taiwanese men would prefer Japanese bishjo
AVs to American variety because the narrative structure of
the former resembles their "real" sex more than the latter.
We first demonstrated that the so-called "real" sex is cul-
turally constituted. Taiwanese, men and women alike, tended
to talk about sex in terms of six binaries, and most crucially
paralleled the binaries with gender contrasts such that the
male sexual being is considered as biological, physical, ordi-
nary, necessary, uncontrollable, and thus "animal-like";
whereas the female sexual being is seen as cultural, spiritual,
non-ordinary, unnecessary, controllable, and finally "human-
like" (Table 1).
Sexual Being and Sexual Script
We then moved to examine how the "proper" sex act of
Taiwanese men and women is discursively constituted
through Simon and Gagnon's (1986) notion of "sexual
script." We demonstrated that the sexual script of Taiwanese
men is made up of five imperatives: to initiate sex, lead
women throughout sex, use several positions in sex, perform
sex for a period of time, and most importantly bring the
woman to orgasm. The sexual script of Taiwanese women is
also made up of five imperatives: to be initiated, led, pene-
trated, caressed, and brought to orgasm.
Taking closer look at these scripts, one can immediately
realize that although initial female sexual passivity is cultur-
ally correct and vital to the male sexual pleasure because it
enables men to assume initiative in sex, what men ultimately
want is not female unresponsiveness but sexual engagement
as exemplified by the imperative of bringing women to
orgasm. The crucial point here lies in the male tiaojiao (train)
through which man transforms his woman from being sexu-
ally passive to active. Putting this back into the binary oppo-
sitions outlined above, one can at once realize that the sexual
pleasure of Taiwanese men is meant to "transcend" the binary
oppositions between the male sex and the female sex by
transforming the "human"-woman into an "animal"-man so
that she will desire and enjoy sex as much as a man will. We
concluded that Taiwanese men preferred Japanese AV
because its narrative structure was precisely made up of an
"animal"-like male character attempting to transform a
"human"-like female character into "animal"-like and that
they could not identify with American pornography because

its narrative structure was made up of an "animal"-like male
character and an "animal"-like female character, leaving no
room for men to assume sexual initiative. Of course,
Taiwanese men would identify more with Japanese AV rather
than American variety also because of the unique historical
backgrounds. Elsewhere, we showed that the 50 years of
Japanese colonialism cultivated among the older generation
of Taiwanese a form of Japanese subjectivity (Wong & Yau,
2014). This made them develop a specific desire for, and a
complex attachment to, things from Japan including AVs,
even though they were prohibited by the KMT government
over the past century. The strong attachment of the older gen-
eration to Japanese AVs in turn made the latter the dominant
type of pornography in modern Taiwan. The younger genera-
tion of Taiwanese also embraced Japanese AVs. But they did
so not because they were historically attached to things from
Japan, but because they grew up watching Japanese AVs,
which had been habitualized as part of their daily life.
But still, this habitualized viewing of Japanese AVs could
not explain why our young Taiwanese male informants
would opt for the bishjo, the sweet and languid beautiful
young women. It is here where the configuration of "animal"-
man became an important conceptual tool to make sense
their choice of bishjo AVs over other genres or styles.
Women's Hesitation to Watch Pornography
As we can see, central to the women's script is female pas-
sivity in sex. As passive recipients of sex, women do not
need to consume pornography because doing so must mean
that they actively desire sex. The sexual script of woman in
Taiwan thus serves to prescribe women's use of pornography
through immense social stigma attached to a woman who
actively desires, and luxuriates in, pornography. The embar-
rassment and shame evoked by the social stigma make
women reluctant to access pornography by themselves.
All this, coupled by their lack of technological skills, sug-
gests that Taiwanese women are often deprived of opportu-
nity to develop an interest, let alone the relevant literacy, in
consuming pornography. They therefore will have difficulty
in appreciating pornography.
Unreal Female and Male Characters
The way Taiwanese women understand their own sexual
beings has profound impact on their pornography use. Recall
that the discursively constituted female sexual being is
"human"-like, whereas the sexual script of women in Taiwan
emphasized female passivity. The sexual script of Taiwanese
women is not the logical consequence of the female sexual
being; and the female sexual being is not the premise of the
Taiwanese women's sexual script either. To say that the
female sexual being is "human"-like does not necessarily
imply female passivity in sex. Equally, to say that women
should be passive in sex does not necessarily mean that their
sexual being has to be "human"-like. There is an
epistemological break between female sexual being and the
Taiwanese women's sexual script. This epistemological
break, we argue, further leads to an ontological break because
if Taiwanese women perceive their sexual being and sexual
script differently, they tend to believe that they are two dif-
ferent things. The female sexual being here appears to
Taiwanese women as their "real" sex, while the sexual script
represents the sexual norms imposed by the society; the for-
mer is what Taiwanese women's sex is, whereas the latter is
what their sexual behaviours should be. That is to say,
Taiwanese women do not see sexual passivity as their "real"
sex. They therefore tend not to be able to identify with the
sexually passive female character in Japanese AVs in general
and bishjo AVs in particular.
Taiwanese women do not find a sexually aggressive
woman "real" to them either. Taiwanese female informants
often described the American actresses as fake and unreal.
Inasmuch as their sexual being is neither sexually passive
nor aggressive but "human"-like, which is cultural, spiritual,
extraordinary, unnecessary, and controllable. They will not
find the sexually aggressive female character in American
pornographic movies attractive because this type of female
character simply does not appear to be "real" to them.
Neither could Taiwanese women identify with the male
character portrayed in American and Japanese pornogra-
phies. Because Taiwanese women perceive their sexual
being as cultural, spiritual, extraordinary, unnecessary, con-
trollable, and thus "human"-like, it follows that they dislike,
if not detest, male advances with clear sexual implications.
Nor do women like straightforward sex. Overwhelmed by
the spirituality of sex, they instead emphasize mood and
atmosphere, enjoy flirting and romance, and would love to
be sweet-talked to. Sex can only come after all these "spiri-
tual" things, but still it is unnecessary and containable. That
is to say, they tend to prefer a male partner with the same
sexual being with her. The "real" and "ideal" sexual partner
for Taiwanese women is a man whose sexual being is also
"human"-like (Table 2).
The Sexual Pleasure for Taiwanese
Women
If the sexual pleasure of Taiwanese women is derived from
dating and having sex with a "human"-like partner, it follows
that they could not find both Japanese AVs and American

pornography sexually pleasurable because the male charac-
ter portrayed in both types of pornography is not "human"-
like but "animal"-like. It should be clear by now that
Taiwanese women could not identify with the female and
male characters portrayed in pornography, both Japanese
AVs and American pornography alike, because they could
not find them "real." This explains why some of our other
female informants told us that despite having ample oppor-
tunty to view pornography by themselves, they still could not
find it interesting, either.
Pornography Viewing With Men
Nothwithstanding their lack of interest in pornography, many
of our female informants reported that as they entered into
romance or marriage, they were often asked by their male
partners to watch pornography together as a kind of foreplay
and accommodate the sexual needs of the latter afterward. In
what follows, we shall focus on the stories of Wen-chien,
Little Yun, and Mei-fung to see how they accommodate the
sexual requests made by their men. We do not mean that
these three women can represent the Taiwanese women. But
we would like to focus intensively on them so that we can
" . . . pick up on the complexity of meanings that sexuality
has for individuals and groups, and on the importance of con-
text in the construction of these meanings" (Attwood, 2005,
p. 68).
Wen-chien was 37 years old when we first met her in
2002. She held no interest in pornography. However, she
came across pornography throughout her past two marriages.
Married in 1989, her first husband offered to watch pornog-
raphy together during their brief marriage. However, Wen-
chien could not recall any detail of the movies she had
watched as their marriage began to have problem. In 1990,
the couple divorced after an incident of physical abuse. In
1991, Wen-chien married her second husband, with whom
she had been married for 10 years. During her 10-year mar-
riage with him, Wen-chien often came across pornography
because her husband held a strong taste for it. As indifferent
to pornography as Wen-chien might be, she often accompa-
nied her husband in watching pornography. As our conversa-
tion goes,
Researcher: Would you watch pornography with your
[second ex] husband?
Wen-chien: Yes, we did . . .
Researcher: Did he invite you to watch or was it a sort of
mutual understanding?
Wen-chien: Um . . . he wouldn't ask me directly . . . We
were married for 10 years. Everything came very natu-
ral. Usually, he would watch it by himself first during
the time I was taking a shower or doing skincare. Then
I would join him to watch together. We usually had sex
afterwards . . .
Researcher: So you mean he would come to you for sex
after watching?
Wen-chien: Yes . . . he would come to touch me, kiss me,
and caress me in the midst of viewing pornography . . .
because he got excited . . . haha . . .
Researcher: So you were not really watching the movie,
right?
Wen-chien: No I don't. As I said, I don't like
pornography.
Researcher: How often did you watch pornography with
him then?
Wen-chien: It depended on situations . . . but maybe once
a week or so . . .
Researcher: I see.
One can observe that pornography viewing appeared to be
part of Wen-chien's marital life even though she found it
unattractive. This is also the case in Mei-fung's life. Mei-
fung was a 27-year-old working mother of two daughters
when we first met her in early 2003. In 2007, under intense
family pressure, Mei-fung gave birth to a son and thereafter
she quit her job and became a full-time housewife. Mei-fung
described her husband as a very "conservative" person who
never talked about sex but would make her watch porno-
graphic VCDs with him at home.
Researcher: Have you ever watched pornography?
Mei-fung: Yes . . . recently . . . with my husband . . .
Researcher: So you are suggesting that you did not watch
pornography on cableTVor pornographicVCDs before?
Mei-fung: No . . .
Researcher: How could it be possible? Given that adult
channels on cable TV were so popular and porno-
graphic VCDs are just about everywhere in Taiwan . . .
Mei-fung: Um . . . my [natal] family did not subscribe to
adult channels. My family is quite strict on sex matters.
If a bedroom scene came up on the TV, my mother and
later I myself would switch channels . . . And we did
not buy VCDs . . .
Researcher: I see . . . so you watched with your husband?
Under what situations?
Mei-fung: In fact, my husband intentionally brought home
some Japanese pornographic VCDs, because he thought
that I was getting more and more disinterested in sex
. . . I think he has uncontainably strong sexual desires,
because he often woke up with an "erected" penis and
attempted to have sex with me, though our children were
by the side. But, I rarely have the desire, so sometimes I

But I did not find those VCDs sexually rewarding . . .
One can observe from the cases of Wen-chien and Mei-
fung that while Taiwanese women were by and large not
interested in pornography, many of them were made to watch
pornography by their men in the course of their lives. None
of our female informants told us that they were "forced" by
their men to watch pornography, but some reported that they
Wong and Yau 7
felt obliged to do so and some others said that they did it out
of the fear that their men would be angry or unhappy. An
obvious case in point is Little Yun.
Little Yun was a 26-year-old single woman when we first
met her in late 2002. Little Yun came from an extremely
troubled family where her birth parents were not married to
each other but others. Her birth father finally deserted the
family for another woman when she was 3. Traumatized by
this, she embarked her life project by finding fatherly love in
romance. She had been dating since 16. Her first lover was
her senior by 7 years. If she could sacrifice her own health by
undergoing four abortions at a backstreet hospital just
because she felt awkward to ask her first boyfriend to wear a
condom in the first place, perhaps we should be not surprised
that Little Yun would accompany him to watch pornography
even though she was not interested in it. As our conversation
goes,
Researcher: So you were always watching Japanese AVs
on cable TV with your first boyfriend?
Little Yun: Yes . . .
Researchers: But you said you were not really interested in
pornography, right? Then why watching it with him?
Little Yun: Yes, I am not interested in pornography. But he
wanted to watch . . .
Researcher: But you could always refuse to do so, right?
Little Yun: No . . . I won't refuse . . . umm . . .
Researcher: You won't refuse? Why was that?
Little Yun: Um . . . you would worry that he might be
upset or angry if I refused . . .
Researcher: So you mean that you ultimately fear that he
would dump you . . .
Little Yun: Um . . . right . . . you might say so.
Indifferent to pornography as Little Yun might be, she felt
obliged to accompany her man to watch pornography. For
she was afraid that her boyfriend would be displeased with
her, if she refused to do so.
Four points can be made in light of the above stories con-
cerning Taiwanese women's experiences of pornography
viewing. First of all, these women could not refuse men's
demand of viewing pornography together as they felt obliged
to do so. Second, as these women were supposed to accom-
pany their men to watch pornography rather than to watch
pornography with men, they had no choice on the content of
the movies they watched. Equally and third, these women
had no say as to when to start and when to finish, let alone
where to start and where to finish. Recall that Mei-fung's
husband brought home some pornographic VCDs for her to
watch so that she might be "more" interested in sex. However,
these pornographic VCDs were brought home and played by
her husband at his own will. Mei-fung was never consulted
about the content of the VCDs, not to mention whether she
really liked to watch pornography, or when to do so. In other
words, Mei-fung was deprived of a say on either the content
or the timing in her viewing of pornography.
Finally, just when these women might have been starting
to "get into" the movies, more often than not their viewing
would be interrupted as their men began to approach their
bodies for sex. Recall that Wen-chien would only join her
husband's viewing after doing her skincare or taking a
shower. In the course of watching pornography with her hus-
band, he might approach her body for sex. No wonder Wen-
chiensaidthatshehadneverfinishedwatchingapornographic
movie.
Central to these four points is that women have no say in
their use of pornography with men. Women are never equal
partners in such joint viewing of pornography. Their role is
simply to accompany men to watch pornography and subse-
quently accommodate their sexual needs when arise. In other
words, men dominate the whole process of joint viewing of
pornography, whereas women are at best sexual subordinate.
Claimed Preference to American
Pornography: Taiwanese Women's
Protest
When we pushed further and asked our Taiwanese female
informants if they had to choose between American and
Japanese pornographies, which one they would prefer, sur-
prisingly almost all of them claimed that they preferred the
former to the latter. Mei-fung, for example, was not inter-
ested in watching pornography, but she claimed that she pre-
ferred American to Japanese pornographies when she was
pushed to choose between them. In the following excerpts
from our interview with her, we shall see how she compared
Japanese AVs with the American variety.
Researcher: So those you guys watched are American? Or
Japanese?
Mei-fung: Might be both . . . I just watched a few only. I
think for the American movies, it seemed they were
doing exercise! Like they were dancing! Then, I think
I don't like watching Japanese AVs, it made me feel . .
. a bit deviant. It made me feel that it looked down
upon women! It made me feel that it didn't respect
women. For the American ones, the way they took the
film is that they took the film, per se. Then, you dis-
covered that they treated sex the same way as sports or
exercise. You know, like they are running or playing
badminton. Since sexual scenes are displayed for quite
long . . . and then, they are less disrespectful to women.
But they are rather boring and unarousing, anyway.
Researcher: Why do you think that Japanese AVs are
sexist?
Mei-fung: Cause they always focus on the faces of the
actresses, who look painful and . . . Or else, there will
be several men coming to couple with the actress.
Then, the lens stays still on her face while she looks in
great pain. And in the interview setting, is that called
"interview" . . . the woman is often asked how many
8 SAGE Open
sexual partners she ever has. She is then forced to
admit that she is very lascivious, just like a nympho-
maniac. My feeling is that we women are renjin kefu
(any man can be her husband)! More importantly, I
was always wondering if the Japanese AV actresses
were also under sexual or physical exploitation!
To Mei-fung, American pornography appears to be a por-
nographic film "taken for the sake of taking," in that sex has
become a form of "exercise" or "dancing." When asked to
elaborate what she meant by exercise or dancing, she
explained that the actor and actress were just machines
"operating" over there. In a sense, what she has described
suggests that American lovemaking is not sexual at all, but
desexualized to become a sport activity or an exercise. By
contrast, Japanese AVs left her an uneasy feeling that the sto-
ryline is deviant and women portrayed in the movies are
denigrated and looked down on. In addition, Mei-fung
thought that Japanese AV girls are always left as pained, in
suffering or exhausted as a result of the physical sex in the
movie. In essence, she found JapaneseAVs remarkably chau-
vinist not only in that they disrespect women in general but
also in that there is sexual and physical abuse for the women
in the movies.
Given her rather negative comments on Japanese AVs, we
could not but ask her whether she implied that American por-
nography was better than Japanese AVs. Mei-fung replied
that she disliked both in general but she would suggest that
American pornography was much less disgusting and giving
more respect and care to women. She added that perhaps it is
exactly this equal treatment of women that made Taiwanese
men including her husband unable to identify with American
pornography. She concluded that she would go for American
pornography rather than Japanese AVs.
Unlike Mei-fung, Little Yun actively reported that she
preferred American to Japanese pornographies. The reason
cited is common: Japanese AVs are deviant because they
tend to employ a lot of props, such as vibrators, dildos, chain
of pearls, liquid, and so on. But, most crucially, they give her
the feelings of "sensually violence" (ganguan baoli) and
"superior man-inferior woman" (nanzun nvbei).As she noted
in our interview,
The Japanese actresses are always almost forced to have sex.
Even though they did not want sex in the beginning, the men
would use a lot of props to stimulate her body, her breast, her
vagina, her clitoris, only to make her sexually excited. I think
these are always done violently as if women are second-class.
They do not respect women at all. Japanese are like this!
As we can see, she detests Japanese AVs on account of
their sex discrimination and their violence directed at women.
By contrast, she thought that the American variety is more
"natural," or "shenghuohua" (sort of daily life). She added
that women in American movies are positioned as "equal"
partners who are free to express their sexual desires and
enjoy sex. Her positioning of the American variety as equali-
tarian and thus liberal was by no means novel among our
informants, as Wen-chien also had similar ideas.
Well, Japanese AV is sick and misogynous; I don't like it . . .
same old plots, small room, and ugly actors. American
pornography is much much better, with handsome actors,
beautiful actresses and more interesting stories. Most
importantly, it treats women as equal partners. Women are not
there to serve the men! Sex is not one-way, but mutual!
What puzzles us most was that despite their patent dis-
taste for pornography and critical attitude toward Japanese
AVs, our Taiwanese female informants tended to be fairly
lenient toward American pornography. We cannot figure
out in the first place why Taiwanese women especially
those like Mei-fung, Little Yun, and Wen-chien, as we have
seen above, did not even have a chance to finish watching a
piece of pornographic movie when they were requested to
watch pornography with their men could have such a vivid
image of American and Japanese pornographies. Obviously,
the "vivid" image these women had about American and
Japanese pornographies comes from their impression rather
than actual experience of pornography viewing. Their
impression of American pornography as equalitarian and
thus liberal and that of Japanese AV as sexist can partially
be attributed to Taiwanese women's stereotypical image of
the gender relation in the two countries. But more impor-
tantly, these Taiwanese women, we argue, have tended to
project their personal and unhappy experience of sexual
coercion by their men in the joint viewing of pornography
onto the actresses of Japanese AVs, which further shapes
their perceptions of porn actresses in Japanese AVs as vic-
tims of male sexual domination and coercion, even though
they may not have much experience in watching Japanese
AV. Taiwanese women's perceptions of Japanese porn
actresses as victims in turn affect the way they respond to
Japanese AVs: They cannot find Japanese AVs interesting.
The arguments with which we conclude is that as Taiwanese
women experience suffering from male domination in the
joint viewing of pornography with their male partners, they
project such suffering onto the porn actresses in Japanese
AVs; and as they perceive Japanese AV actresses as victims
of male sexual domination and coercion, they reject
Japanese AVs. We take several sentences from Fareen
Parvez (2006),
Indeed, authenticity is necessary to their [women's] enjoyment
[of pornography]. But what the women perceive as authentic
depends in part on their own experiences. Specifically, I showed
how experiences with sexual violence and economic struggle
led many of the women I interviewed to perceive porn acting as
self-destructive and in some cases coercive. As a result, these
women sometimes found pornography emotionally upsetting
despite the arousal they generally obtained from it. Stated
differently, they experienced emotional dissonance, as they
perceive such dissonance in the porn actresses. (p. 625)
Wong and Yau 9
Our Taiwanese women, however, tried to do more than
their American counterparts who participated in Fareen
Parvez's research did. They rejected Japanese AVs also to
undermine, though symbolically, the male sexual domination
and coercion. As we have seen, these women vehemently
detested Japanese AVs, which were their men's favorite, on
grounds of their sexual discrimination against women. Here,
one should grasp the operation of equivalence that links
"Japanese AVs" with their male partners. As women detested
their male partners forcing them to watch Japanese AVs, they
naturally detested Japanese AVs, the kind of pornography
with which their men identified. The equivalence between
Japanese AVs and Taiwanese men is reinforced at the experi-
ential level. As Japanese AVs are the kind of pornography
women were required by their men to watch and follow,
Japanese AVs are simply their men--Japanese AVs for their
men. To these Taiwanese women then, Japanese AVs in gen-
eral have metaphorically become the symbol of their domi-
nating male partners who forced pornography alongside sex
upon them. If women vehemently detested Japanese AVs
even though they had very thin idea about it, it is not unrea-
sonable to say that they actually detested their male partners,
at least, for their domination in sex.
If Taiwanese women detested male domination through
vehemently denying JapaneseAVs, perhaps we should not be
surprised that they resisted male domination through a
claimed preference with American pornography. Recall that
most of their men preferred Japanese to American pornogra-
phies. Taiwanese women's totally opposite, though claimed,
preference for pornography, we argue, can be seen as their
attempt to undermine Taiwanese men's sexual hegemony.
Stated differently, women's claimed preference points
exactly to their attempt to undermine patriarchy. As noted,
most Taiwanese men regarded American porn actresses as
sexually aggressive and thus emasculating. However,
Taiwanese women we interviewed tended to think that the
American variety is more "natural," "artless," "shenghuohua
(sort of daily life)," "less misogynistic," "more liberal," and
thus better than Japanese AVs. By claiming that they pre-
ferredAmerican pornography with which they were unfamil-
iar and to which their male partners showed disdain, our
women informants expressed their frustration and distaste as
a woman in the male-dominant Taiwanese society. Just like
their predecessors in using pornography screening to launch
a public protest to the patriarchy, these women likewise
manipulated their "claimed" preference for American por-
nography to launch a protest against male domination in sex.
Conclusion
This article examined the pornography use of Taiwanese
women and especially their "claimed" preference for
American pornography. It started with the premise that
although the lack of technological skills barred
Taiwanese women from accessing pornography, what seem
more crucial are the local gender norms and configurations
of sexual beings. We showed that under the sexual script
women showing an interest in pornography still carried a
stigma that worked very well to stop women from accessing
pornography. Taken together, their lack of technological
skill and hesitation to access pornography explain why
Taiwanese women rarely came into contact with pornogra-
phy and thus deprived of the interest in appreciating
pornography.
Women's unique understanding of their sexual being as
"human"-like departed tremendously from the images of the
female characters portrayed in pornographies. They thus
could not identify with the female characters portrayed in
either Japanese AVs or American pornography. Likewise,
their understanding of their sexual being as "human"-like
also constrained the kind of men with whom they could sex-
ually identify: must also be "human"-like. As the male char-
acters in both Japanese AVs and American pornography were
not "human"-like, but "animal"-like, both types of pornogra-
phy could not find favor with women.
However, many of the Taiwanese women we interviewed
watched pornography with their male partners. They were
often demanded by their men to watch pornography and sub-
mitted to the demands under the intense social pressure gen-
erated by sexual script. Under the same script, women were
supposed to accompany their men to watch pornography
rather than watch pornography with men. These women
lacked any sense of autonomy with regard to pornography
viewing.
Of course that women did not refuse pornography view-
ing initiated by their male partners does not necessarily mean
that they were happy to do. Their frustrations arising from
their simultaneous failures to reject such pornography view-
ing and to enjoy pornography made them detest Japanese
AVs.As women detested their male partners forcing Japanese
pornographies upon them, they could not but transpose this
sense of hatred onto Japanese AVs with which their men
identified. Japanese AVs and Taiwanese men were rendered
equivalent to each other. That is to say, Taiwanese women
detested Japanese AVs as detest for male domination in sex.
If these women detested male domination through vehe-
mently denying Japanese AVs, perhaps we should not be sur-
prised that they resisted male domination through claiming
to prefer American pornography. It is especially true if we
take into account of the fact that Taiwanese men disliked
American pornography. By claiming that they preferred
American pornography to which their men showed disdain,
these women expressed their frustrations as a woman in the
male-dominant society.
