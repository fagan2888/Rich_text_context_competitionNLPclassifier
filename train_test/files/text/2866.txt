Non-technical summary
Research Question
The net interest income is for the majority of banks in Germany the by far most
important source of income. In this paper, we investigate how the bearing of credit risk,
term transformation and the liquidity and payment management for its customers
contribute to the net interest income.
Contribution
The above mentioned functions and their potential impact on a bank's net interest income
are well documented in the empirical literature. However, little is known about the concrete
value of the different contributions to the net interest income.In this study for the year 2012,
we carry out a quantification of the different components of the net interest income of the
banks in Germany. The idea is to estimate the costs (including opportunity costs) of
performing the above mentioned functions. We assume that in the long run earnings equal
costs and we apply these costs as the contributions to a bank's net interest income.
Results
For the median bank nearly half of the net interest income (47%) is due to the payment
and liquidity management for the customers. More than one third (35%) of the net
interest income stems from term transformation and 16% of the net interest income
results from bearing credit risk. Other contributions to the net interest income can be
due to a difference in the volumes of interest bearing assets and liabilities and due to a
bank's strong market position.

Fragestellung
Der Zinsüberschuss ist für das Gros der deutschen Banken die mit Abstand wichtigste
Einkommensquelle. In diesem Papier wird untersucht, wie das Tragen von
Kreditrisiken, die Fristentransformation und das Zahlungs- und Liquiditätsmanagement
für die Kunden zum Zinsüberschuss beitragen.
Beitrag
Die oben beschriebenen Funktionen und deren potentieller Einfluss auf den Zinsüberschuss
einer Bank sind in der empirischen Literatur gut dokumentiert.Wenig ist allerdings über die
konkrete Größe der einzelnen Beiträge zum Zinsüberschuss bekannt. In dieser Studie wird
für das Jahr 2012 eine quantitative Zerlegung des Zinsüberschusses für deutsche Banken
durchgeführt. Die Idee ist, für jede der oben beschriebenen Funktionen die dabei
entstehenden Kosten (einschließlich Opportunitätskosten) abzuschätzen. Unter der
Annahme, dass langfristig die Erträge den Kosten entsprechen, werden diese Kosten
dann als Beiträge zum Zinsüberschuss einer Bank angesetzt.
Ergebnisse
Auf das Zahlungs- und Liquiditätsmanagement für die Kunden entfällt für die
durchschnittliche Bank fast die Hälfte des Zinsüberschusses (47%). Aus der
Fristentransformation stammt für die durchschnittliche Bank gut ein Drittel des
Zinsüberschusses (35%) und aus dem Übernehmen von Kreditrisiken 16% des
Zinsüberschusses. Andere Beiträge zum Zinsüberschuss können dadurch entstehen, dass
sich zinstragende Aktiva und zinstragende Passiva nicht genau entsprechen oder dass
eine Bank eine starke Markstellung hat.

Abstract
Using unique data sets on German banks, we decompose their net interest margin and quantify
the different components by estimating the costs of the various functions they perform. We
investigate three major functions: namely, liquidity and payment management for the
customers, the bearing of credit risk, and term transformation. For the year 2012, the costs of
liquidity and payment management correspond, in the median, to 47%, the bearing of credit risk
to 16%, and earnings from term transformation to 35% of the net interest margin, respectively.
However, looking at the period 2005-2012, earnings from term transformation seem to account
for a much smaller share (about 20%) of the median bank's net interest margin.
Keywords: Net interest margin, credit risk, term transformation, liquidity and payment

1 Introduction
For most banks, the net interest margin is by far the most important source of income.
At the same time, seen from the perspective of the real economy, the banks' net interest
margin is considered to be the cost of financial intermediation. In this context, the net
interest margin is the wedge between what the borrowers have to pay for their loans and
what the ultimate lenders actually receive. The aim of this paper is to account for both
perspectives. For this purpose, we decompose this important economic variable, thereby
helping to gain a better understanding of the banks' intermediation functions. The main
issue we want to address in this paper is the quantification of the components of the
banks' net interest margin.
We investigate banks' major intermediation functions: namely, the bearing of credit
risk, term transformation, and liquidity and payment management for their customers.
The idea behind our approach is to estimate the costs associated with performing these
functions. Under the assumption that, at least in the long run, costs are covered by
earnings, we assume that the earnings from performing the various functions can be
derived from the respective costs.
Banks grant loans which are subject to the risk of default. Banks carefully select and
monitor their borrowers. Nevertheless, some of these borrowers cannot make their
interest payments and are unable to pay back their debts. This is especially true of risky
loans which have been given to firms in cyclical industries or which are not well
collateralized. In this paper, we not only take into account the expected losses of the
credit exposure, but also estimate a credit risk premium. Moreover, banks hold bonds
which also expose them to credit risk and should therefore earn them a decent
remuneration.
The banks' term transformation consists in granting long-term loans and taking in short-
term deposits. As the term structure of interest rates tends to increase with maturity,
term transformation is advantageous for banks. However, if the interest rate level rises,
banks' earnings from term transformation decrease because rising interest rates usually
have a greater impact on funding costs than on interest income. These differences in
impact are due to the fact that the maturities of banks' liabilities are usually shorter than
the maturities of their assets. This means that within a given time span of, say, one year,
2
the share of liabilities that has to be renewed at what are now unfavorable conditions is
larger than the new business on the asset-side which benefits from the more favorable
interest rates.
Another main function of banks is to perform liquidity and payment management for
their customers. They carry out money transfers for their customers, they provide cash
in the ATMs, and they enable their customers to store their money. This function also
includes the administrative expenses when customers take out a loan. Often, customers
do not pay directly for these services, but pay for them indirectly in terms of reduced
interest rates on their deposits and mark-ups on the loans. For instance, customers'
money placed in current accounts is remunerated only at a low rate (if at all), whereas
the remuneration of time deposits is geared to capital market rates.
Most papers that deal with banks' net interest margin derive qualitative statements: for
instance, that a bank's market power is positively correlated with its net interest margin.
By contrast, our paper aims at making quantitative statements: for instance, that the
earnings from term transformation account for a certain percentage of a bank's net
interest margin.
A bank's bearing of credit risk is the function that receives the most attention, especially
in academia. Term transformation is also an often-discussed issue, perhaps because of
its intuitiveness and owing to bank failures caused by excessive term transformation.
Surprisingly, in our empirical study, neither the bearing of credit risk nor the earnings
from term transformation are the most important sources of a bank's net interest
income. Instead, liquidity and payment management for the bank's customers turns out
to be the most important source. In our study for the German universal banks, we show
that, in 2012, liquidity and payment management account for 47% of a bank's net
interest income, followed by earnings from term transformation (35%) and by the
bearing of credit risk (16%), respectively.
The paper is structured as follows. In Section 2, we briefly review the literature in this
field and state our contribution. Section 3 is about the banks' functions and how we
quantify their contribution to the banks' net interest margin. In Section 4, we describe
the data and Section 5 gives the empirical results. Section 6 concludes.

2 Literature
There is a vast amount of literature on the banks' net interest margin. In principle, this
literature can be divided into three strands. The first is about bank characteristics and
market conditions that qualitatively explain the banks' net interest margin. Starting with
a dealership model, which goes back to Ho and Saunders (1981), banks are considered
as risk-averse dealers between depositors and borrowers of funds. This model has
become fundamental in designing empirical models that explain how banks set their
interest rate margins. Theoretical refinements have been suggested during the
intervening period. Examples of these are Angbazo (1997), Mc Shane and Sharpe
(1985), Maudos and Fernández de Guevara (2004), Carbó and Rodriguez (2007) and
Entrop, Memmel, Ruprecht, and Wilkens (2012). Their studies extend the basic model
by introducing, for example, credit risk, interaction between credit and interest rate risk,
term transformation, uncertainty with respect to money market rates and the role of non-
interest income business. Furthermore, Maudos and Fernández de Guevara (2004), and
Saunders and Schumacher (2000) highlight administrative costs as a major determinant
of the banks' interest margin. In addition, there are empirical papers that analyze the
banks' net interest margin without a theoretical model for deriving the determinants; for
example, English (2002), Memmel and Schertler (2013) and Gunter, Krenn, and
Sigmund (2013). By contrast, as stated earlier, we do not try to find further determinants
of the net interest margin, but to quantify the different contributions made by
performing the banks' intermediation functions.
The second strand of literature deals with the pass-through of capital market interest
rates to bank rates, which has been extensively discussed in the literature (e.g. De
Bondt, 2005; ECB, 2009; Weth 2002; Schlüter, Busch, Hartmann-Wendels, and
Sievers, 2012). While most of this literature is about the question of how completely
and rapidly banks adjust their rates to changes in market rates, some of these papers
analyze the determinants of interest pass-through parameters. By contrast, our interest in
the speed of the banks' pass-through is that this speed is one key determinant of the
bank's term transformation: Banks with a strong market position are able to have a large
gap between the legal and the actual maturity of the deposits. Using data on banks' own
assessment of their exposure to interest rate risk, we do not have to estimate how
4
quickly a single bank adjusts its rates to changes in the market rates, but can make use
of this interest rate risk exposure data.
The third strand is about the quantification of different components of the net interest
margin. Memmel (2011) performs this quantification for the German banks' term
transformation. While we make use of the same technique, we quantify all components
of the net interest margin, not only the term transformation. Costa and Nakane (2005)
provide a quantitative decomposition of Brazilian banks' lending spread, i.e. the
difference between the loan rate and a maturity equivalent swap rate. They concentrate
on the modeling of the administrative costs related to loan granting. By contrast, we try
to extract the entire costs associated with a bank's interest income-generating activities,
especially the costs of the customers' liquidity and payment management. In addition,
the authors neglect ­ by definition ­ the contribution of term transformation (because
this component is not included in the lending spread), and model the costs due to loan
losses in a rather elementary way. For Macedonia, Georgievska, Kabashi, and Manova-
Trajkovska (2011) examine the difference between a bank's lending rate and its deposit
rate, which is close in economic terms to the net interest margin. They quantitatively
decompose this difference, but their modeling is rather elementary and they also neglect
the role played by term transformation. Our contribution is to undertake a thorough
modeling of all major components of the banks' net interest income and to use very
suitable data sets on German banks.
3 Decomposing the net interest margin
In this section, we explain how we measure the costs and earnings of the various
intermediation functions; namely, the bearing of credit risk, term transformation, and
liquidity and payment management for the customers. In addition, we discuss technical
adjustments of the net interest margin.
3.1 Credit risk
We can divide the cost of bearing credit risk into two components. The first consists of
the expected losses in the credit portfolio. The second is the premium for bearing this
risk.
5
We assume that the expected loss rate of a loan depends on the loan's initial maturity
and the industry of the borrower. We further assume that the expected loss rates are
time-dependent and that a bank uses the then prevailing expected loss rates when it sets
the rates that it charges for newly granted loans. Therefore, the contribution to a bank's
net interest margin that covers the expected losses in the bank's credit portfolio is a
weighted average of past and current expected loss rates for different maturities and
industries. For the estimation of this contribution, we divide a bank's credit portfolio
into different industries and maturity brackets. The breakdown is such that we can
optimally use the information included in the Bundesbank's borrowers statistics (See
Section 4). Let
, ,
t j k
 be the expected credit loss rates in time t for industry 1,...,28
j 
and maturity bracket 1, 2, 3
k  and let
, , ,
t i j k
w be the corresponding weights in the credit
portfolio of bank i . Given the expected losses in the credit portfolio are fully taken into
account when loan rates are set, the contribution to a bank's net interest income due to
expected losses (in euro) in the credit portfolio

h is a function to weigh the
current ( 0
l  ) and past ( 0
l  ) expected loss rates making use of the information about
the loans' different initial maturities (See the section A.1 in the appendix and Table 1).2
The first maturity bracket ( 1
k  ) encompasses the loans with an initial maturity of up to
one year, the second bracket those with an initial maturity of more than one and up to
five years, and the third bracket contains loans with an initial maturity of more than five
years, where we assume, for reasons of data availability, that there is no loan with an
initial maturity of more than eight years. The expected credit loss rates
, ,
t j k
 are
estimated as the three-year average of the actual corresponding nationwide loss rates.
We use a three year horizon (instead of the loss rate in a given year) to reduce the noise
in the estimation.
2 Bolt, de Haan, Hoeberichts, van Oordt, and Swank (2012) also model the banks' net interest margin as a
function of past and current interest rates and expected loss rates. However, their dataset is much less
granular (no maturity breakdown and no industry breakdown), so that they have to strongly rely on
simplifying assumptions.

So far, we have only estimated the expected losses in the credit portfolio. However,
when a bank prices a loan, not only do the expected losses have to be covered, the bank
also needs to earn a risk premium. We assume that this risk premium

variables that we use to explain a bank's net interest margin, that means the
contributions from the bond portfolio (as explained below in this subsection), from term
transformation (Subsection 3.2), from the payment and liquidity management
(Subsection 3.3) and from the other components (Subsection 3.4). The factor  is equal
to the coefficient  if one is subtracted. The euro amount for expected losses in the
credit portfolio and the corresponding risk premium is then computed as

3 If we interpret the risk premium as a contribution to the unexpected loss in the Basel formula, the
relationship between the probability of default (a measure for the expected losses) and the unexpected
losses are not linear, but strictly monotonic increasing. In this context, Equation (2) can be seen as an
approximation.
7
In addition, banks hold bonds as well. Here, we use a bank's holdings of bonds issued
by non-banks multiplied by the bonds' premium over the yield of government debt. By
contrast, we neglect the credit risk contribution stemming from government bonds (and
loans). We do so, because we use the yield of government bonds as our benchmark for
risk-free assets. Furthermore, for most banks, the positions in government bonds and
loans tend to be minor ones, which means there is hardly any difference in our results in
terms of whether we use zero or any other reasonable credit risk premium for
government bonds.
3.2 Term transformation
A bank's earnings from term transformation cannot be observed directly. There is no
such item in the bank's financial statement, unlike, say, write-downs in the credit
portfolio. However, banks in Germany have to report their exposure to interest rate risk
in the banking book, and we use this information to gauge a bank's earnings from term
transformation, as done in Memmel (2011). His idea was to investigate a passive trading
strategy in risk-free government bonds with the same interest rate risk exposure as the
bank under consideration. Under the assumption that the same risk exposure yields the
same return, the net interest income of this passive trading strategy will be equal to the
banks' earnings from term transformation. The benchmark models (See, for instance,
Fama and French, 1992, and Carhart, 1997) for the stock market state that the expected
return of a share, not the actual return, is the same if the share has the same exposures to
the risk factors. By contrast, in our paper, we assume that the actual return is the same.
We believe that this is justified, because the returns of bond portfolios (of the same
currency and without default risk) are much more highly correlated than the returns of
stock portfolios.
The passive trading strategy consists in revolvingly investing in 10-year par yield
bonds, where this position is funded by revolvingly issuing 1-year par yield bonds. Our
timely discretion is at monthly intervals. This means that, each month, a 10-year bond
that was issued ten years ago at par comes due and the sum is then reinvested in the 10-
year bond that is now issued at par. The interest payments of the different bonds are
collected during one year and constitute the interest income of the strategy.
Accordingly, the interest expenses of the passive trading strategy consist of the interest
payments on the 1-year bond. The euro amount of the passive trading strategy is not
8
relevant for our purposes, but for the ease of exposition, we assume that its volume is
1,000.
Let

be the basis point value, i.e. the loss in euros in the case of a
one basis point parallel shift of the term structure, for bank i and the passive trading

3.3 Liquidity and payment management for the customers
As stated above, banks perform liquidity and payment management for their customers.
Performing such a function causes costs for bank branches and staff. We assume that, at
least in the long run, these costs are covered by corresponding earnings, for instance by
mark-ups on loans or by reduced bank rates for customer deposits. A bank's profits and
loss account has a position on administrative costs, which comprise personnel costs as
well as other administrative costs, such as depreciations on fixed assets and
amortizations on intangible assets. However, these costs include not only costs that
result from interest generating activities, but also costs from fee and trading business. In
order to extract the portion of operating costs which arise from liquidity and payment
management, we adopt two approaches and compare the outcome for robustness
reasons.
In the first specification (Equation (6)), we explain a bank's operating costs by different
sources of income, namely interest income and fee income. In doing so, we estimate the
following function for the period 1993 to 2012:
, 1 , 2 , ,
t i t i i t t i t i
OC NIM FEE T u
    
         (6)
with
,
t i
OC as operating cost relative to total assets,
,
t i
NIM as the net interest margin and
,
t i
FEE as income from fees and commissions over total assets. We conduct a panel
9
regression with bank-fixed effects in order to control for unobservable heterogeneity.4 A
time trend variable ( T ) accounts for technological changes which affect cost
development. We expect  to be negative, since costs have been declining through the
observed period. Income shares are considered as proxies for outputs in interest-
generating and fee-income-generating activities. In doing so, we divide operating costs
into three parts: a part which is directly associated with interest income, a part which is
caused by running fee-income business, and a residual which contains fixed costs and
costs stemming from other income sources, e.g. trading income. To be more precise,
variable costs directly related to net interest income are calculated as
1 ,
^
t i
NIM
  .
In the function above we do not consider trading income explicitly as an output
component, since this income source is very volatile and often takes on negative values.
Therefore, the appropriateness of net trading income as a proxy for the extent of trading
activities may be limited. As we use fixed-effects regressions, we do not assume
serious problems due to omitted variable bias. In order to test the appropriateness of this
assumption, we run a robustness check, where we introduce a variable which covers
other income components (i.e. it covers trading income and other non-interest income),
to total assets. As
,
t i
TRADE often takes on negative values, we only consider cases where
this variable is positive.
In the second specification, we take a more detailed view as we use concrete amounts of
different outputs (instead of the whole net interest income) to describe costs caused by
the banks' liquidity and payment management for their customers. Again, we run fixed-
effects panel regressions including the years 2008 ­ 2012:

CARDS is the number of cards (credit cards, cards with a cash function, with a payment
function as well as with an e-money function) a bank hands out to its customers per
100,000  of total assets. The variable TRANSACTIONS is defined as the number of
payment actions taken at the cashiers' desk per 100 of total assets. This variable serves
as a proxy for personal customer service. If a bank focuses more on face-to-face service
rather than on providing its services via internet and terminals it is expected to face

between coefficients, indicating inconsistency of the coefficients in the random effects specification.

higher administrative costs. We also introduce the amount of automated teller machines
per 100.000 of total assets. CREDITS comprise customer loans (as a percentage of
total assets) as a variable to account for the costs emerging within the loan granting
process (e.g. consultancy, monitoring, management and, if the loan engagement fails,
liquidation). This type of costs has also to be covered by net interest income.
Furthermore, we introduce SECURITIES (as a percentage of total assets) as a further
output.5 As in Equation (6), we include the variable FEE because fee-income generating
activities are expected to cause further administrative costs.6 We also perform a further
regression, where TRANSACTIONS are separated into whether money is paid in
(PAYMENT-IN) or paid out (PAYMENT-OUT). The reason for this is that paying in
could be assumed as more laborious than paying out, and therefore causes higher costs.
We furthermore introduce a time trend as in Equation (6). In a further specification we
test whether there is a significant interaction between TRANSACTIONS and fee-income.
Since fee-income generating activities (e.g. selling building savings contracts and
insurances) normally require a certain amount of personal service, a bank which is
already focused on personal service (e.g. a bank that carries out customers' transaction
at the counter) may gain synergies by offering additional fee-products. From Equation
(7), operating costs for providing liquidity and payment management (

3.4 Other components
There are further components determining banks' interest margins, such as market
power and inequality of interest-bearing assets and liabilities. In the interest margin
literature, which explains interest margins in a qualitative context, proxies like
concentration ratios or Lerner indices are often used in order to account for market
power (e.g. Maudos and Solís, 2009; Lepetit, Nys, Rous, and Tarazi, 2008; Maudos and
Fernández de Guevara, 2004). Measuring the quantitative part due to market power
seems to be rather difficult. One useful attempt to do this might be to interpret the
5 Customer loans and securities are often proposed as bank outputs by the literature on cost efficiency.
See, for example, Fiorentino, Karmann, and Koetter (2006), Koetter and Poghosyan (2009), Bos, Heid,
Koetter, Kolari, and Koos (2005) and Hauner (2005).
6 See also Lozano-Vivas and Pasiouras (2010) and Tortosa-Ausina (2003).
11
fraction due to market power as the difference between the identified components and
the actual value of the interest margin. Our calculations indicate little space for market
power margins. At this point it has to be mentioned that small markups could also be
due to cost and profit inefficiencies rather than reflecting little market power. Thus,
banks with market power could suffer from inefficiencies instead of reaping
monopolistic rents (see Koetter, Kolari, and Spierdijk, 2012; Koetter and Vins 2008).
Particularly when bank fixed effects in the equations for the liquidity and payment
management (Equations (6) and (7)) do not fully cover cost-inefficient deviations from
the cost function, part of the estimated magnitude of operative costs could reflect market
power induced cost-inefficiencies. However, from our point of view, a rather small
market power margin does not seem to be implausible. First, we assume that
competition in the banking market has increased due to the expansion of direct banks,
non-banks and near-banks. Second, it would be expected that small rural banks, in
particular, face low competition and, therefore, benefit in terms of higher margins. But
this argument is myopic, since savings and cooperative banks, which are located mainly
in rural regions, are committed to supporting common public interests, rather than to
focusing on profit maximization.
There are also technical issues related to interest margin calculation. We calculate the
net interest margin by subtracting interest expenses from gross interest income and
divide it by the banks' total assets. This procedure is appropriate when interest-bearing
liabilities equal interest-bearing assets. The net interest margin would however be
overestimated if interest-bearing assets were to exceed interest-bearing liabilities. We
therefore calculate a variable "Other". We assume that a bank obtains its residual
funding or invests its surpluses at the interbank market. The contribution to the net
interest margin is therefore calculated as

between interest bearing assets and liabilities may stem from a bank's capital (which in
most parts does not count to the interest bearing liabilities). The assumption that a bank
borrows or lends the difference in the volumes at the interbank market is a technical
12
assumption to equalize interest bearing assets and liabilities. We neglect price effects
that arise due to the assumed change in the liability structure.
Another issue that has become especially relevant during the recent low interest rate
environment is that deposit rates normally take positive values. When market interest
rates decrease, banks would normally adjust their loan rates as well as their deposits
rates. If the market interest rate level has fallen below a certain threshold, deposit rates
cannot be adjusted in the expected dimension (due to, for instance, the lower bound of
zero concerning deposit rates), thereby causing a decline in the actual net interest
margin. This aspect could contribute to a situation in which the sum of the calculated
components (credit risk compensation, term transformation, liquidity and payment
management costs, and other components) exceeds the actual net interest margin.
4 Data
For our analysis, we use regulatory data for banks in Germany. Apart from the banks'
financial statements (balance sheet, profit and loss accounts), we have quantitative
supervisory reports for each bank and each year at our disposal. From these data sets,
we take the elementary information about the banks; for instance, their total assets, their
operating costs, their net fee income, and their net interest income. This data is available
on an annual basis. For our panel regression in section 3.3, we use data from 1993 till
2012. In order to get more detailed information about the payments services a bank
provides to its customers we use the payment statistics. This database contains yearly-
based information about payment transactions in the German banking system and is
available from 2008 till 2012. We use data on the amount of cards a bank hands out to
its customers (i.e. credit cards, cards with a cash function, with a payment function as
well as with an e-money function), the amounts of payments carried at a cashier's desk
and the number of automated teller machines (ATMs) a bank reports.7 We apply a
relatively moderate outlier treatment, in which we truncate variables used in the
Equations (6) and (7) by banking group (i.e. savings, cooperatives, small commercials,
and large banks)8 at the 1st and 99th percentile. We furthermore account for mergers, as
7 Some banks, most of them regional banks, did not report the numbers of ATMs, cards and transaction,
which we have treated as missing values.
8 Large banks comprise "Landesbanken", "big banks" and central cooperative institutions. We choose this
grouping, because individual groups differ in their income ratios due to differences in business models.
13
the banks that have resulted from the mergers are usually substantially different from
the pre-merger banks. In Tables 7 to 10 in the appendix, we provide summary statistics.
For determining a bank's exposure to credit risk, we make use of the Bundesbank's
borrowers statistics and BISTA statistics. In this data set, the German banks' loan
exposure to the real economy is broken down into 28 different industries/sectors and
three maturity brackets. The 28 industries/sectors consist of 23 industries in the German
real economy (excluding government), three types of loans to German households, the
sector of German non-profit organizations, and foreign non-banking firms and
households (excluding government).9 The data is further broken down according to the
loans' initial maturity (three brackets: up to one year, more than one and up to five
years, more than five years). This data set not only includes the loan volume, but its
valuation changes as well, which allows us to calculate loss rates.
Concerning the banks' exposure to interest rate risk, we make use of the Basel interest
rate coefficient. This coefficient states the change in the present value of a bank's
banking book due to a standardized shock of the term structure of interest rates relative
to the banks regulatory capital. In the past, this shock consisted of a parallel shift in the
term structure of +130 basis points. Since 2011, the amount of the parallel shift has been
set to +200 basis points. To derive a bank's banking book basis point value
,i
BVP

, we
divide its Basel interest rate coefficient by 130 and 200, respectively, making use of the
near linear relationship of the interest rate risk for relatively small shocks, and multiply
it by the bank's capital. In accordance with Memmel (2011), we set the basis point
value of the passive trading strategy ( )
BPV TS 
to the constant of 0.3716 per 1,000
euros.10
9 To make the manuscript easier to read, we write "industries" instead of "industries/sectors".
10 The basis point value of the passive trading strategy, i.e. a measure for its interest rate risk, varies in the
course of time, depending on the level of interest rates. However, these variations are small and tend to be
negligible.

In Figure 1, we show the yearly net income of this strategy since 1983, the first year for
which we can calculate the net income. We see that the earnings from term
transformation in the years 2011 and 2012 are far above the average since 1983 of
2.04% p. a. Even so, these years are characterized by low (and sometimes negative)
interest rates. There may be two reasons for this. First, the steepness of the term
structure (the yield of a 10-year par yield bond minus the yield of a 1-year par yield
bond) is above its average since 1983, i.e. 1.29% average compared with 1.58%.
Second, the passive trading strategy benefits from the higher coupons of past 10-year
par yield bonds.
5 Empirical Results
5.1 Quantifying the components
In Table 2, the results for the quantification of the different components are shown. The
results are given for 2012 as the median relative to total assets (per year) and net interest
income, respectively. We can only carry out the break-down for the year 2012 because,
for the credit risk, we need a time series to estimate the contribution to the net interest
margin as a weighted average of past and present credit loss rates (see Equation (1)).
The data set on credit loss rates only started in 2003 and we use this period of ten years
to estimate the contribution of bearing credit risk for the year 2012.
We can derive the following conclusions. First, the component that reflects the costs of
the clients' liquidity and payment management is the most important, followed by the
component for term transformation and credit risk. In 2012, for the median bank, the
costs of liquidity and payment management account for 47% of the net interest income
and 104 bp per total assets. The relevant figures for term transformation and credit risk
are 35% and 16% of net interest income, and 77 bp and 34 bp relative to total assets,
respectively.

Second, when calculating operating costs that arise from liquidity and payment
management, specification I (Table 3) gives us a first hint about the range of the cost
share which has to be covered by interest margin. Specifications I-a to I-d suggest that,
on average, about 47% to 52% of net interest margin corresponds to administrative
costs. This finding is confirmed by specification II-b (Table 4), which makes it possible
to calculate the operating costs stemming from liquidity and payment management as
17
47% of net interest margin in the median in 2012 and as 49% in the median for the
period 2008 to 2012.11 The distribution of the cost share in 2012 is shown in Figure 2.
Figure 2: Banks' operative costs for the liquidity and payment management of their
customers as a percentage of net interest income margin in 2012. *n = 1550, 1 outlier
has been dropped.
Furthermore, we interpret the coefficients in specification II directly as cost unit rates.
According to these estimates, a card causes average costs of 80 per year, whereas an
additional ATM costs, on average, costs 64,000 (including depreciations). As expected,
PAYMENTS-IN are, on average, associated with higher costs per transaction than
PAYMENTS-OUT. The coefficient on FEE reflects the relatively high personnel costs
connected with fee products: For every 100 fee income, 32 operating costs are
incurred. Our calculations show that operating costs for securities are negligible, while
consumer loans cause 5 administrative costs per 1,000 customer loan. In both
specifications, administrative costs are not significantly influenced by time trend.12
Specification II-d in Table 4 shows no evidence for synergy effects between fee-income
11 We rely on specification II-b in order to calculate operating expenses for the provision of liquidity and
payment management, as time trend and interaction term do not play a significant role, but the
differentiation between PAYMENTS-IN and PAYMENTS-OUT does provide further information.
12 This could be due to a short time horizon. Even in specification I some banks face short time series as
we control for mergers.

Third, the component for term transformation seems very high, i.e. roughly one-third of
the median bank's net interest margin comes from this source. When we look at
Table 5, we see that this component is rather volatile in the course of time and that the
year 2012 shows very high term transformation figures. The median contribution of this
component over a whole interest rate cycle (here: from 2005 to 2012) has been 44 basis
points per total assets and year, and 20% of the net interest margin, whereas the
respective 2012-values are 77 basis points and 35%. Memmel (2011), who uses the
identical data for the period 2005-2009, obtains 25 basis points relative to total assets
and 13% of the net interest margin.

Table 5: Earnings from term transformation; bp = basis points; median bank; the
earnings are calculated as stated in Equation (5).
Fourth, earnings due to bearing credit risk seem rather low at 16% of the net interest
margin, all the more so since not only the loans' expected losses are accounted for, but a
risk premium as well (as estimated in Equation (3)). One reason for the rather low
contribution of bearing credit risk is due to the fact that the year 2012, for which we
carry out the break-down of the net interest margin, was characterized by very low loss
rates in the credit portfolio. As stated in Equation (1), the contribution for bearing credit
risk is a weighted average of past and present credit loss rates. However, the years 2010
to 2012 which were characterized by low loss rates, have a large weight in the portfolio
composition, so that the low contribution need not to be representative for a whole
business cycle (See Memmel et al., 2014, Figure 1, for a graphical representation of the
20
credit loss rate in Germany in the course of time). Another issue is the credit risk
premium. If we dropped this risk premium altogether (as suggested by the regression
results for Equation (3) in the first column in Table 6), the contribution of bearing credit
risk would be even lower (12%). Instead, we take the results of the single variable
regression (second column in Table 6), where the coefficient for the expected losses in
the credit portfolio is 1.363 (implying a risk premium of 36.3%). We do so, because the
variable for the payment and liquidity management includes administrative costs for the
loan granting, which may lead to biases in the estimates. An example may explain this:
Assume a bank grants a risky loan. For this loan, the probability of default and,
therefore, ceteris paribus the expected losses are higher. At the same time, this loan has
a higher-than-average probability that costly renegotiations and liquidations are
necessary, which increases the administrative costs above the average.
Fifth, the component due to the difference between interest bearing assets and liabilities
amounts to around 2 basis points, which corresponds to less than 1% of a the median
bank's net interest margin. The amount seems relatively small, but one has to take into
account that the average 3-month interbank rate was relatively low (0.57% p.a.) in 2012.
Sixth, the sum of the four components accounts for nearly 100% of the median bank's
net interest income. This finding is in line with the empirical results of Georgievska et al
(2011), who find that the sum of the components even exceeds the banks' net interest
income by up to 20%. The question is why there is so little left from the interest income
to cover the banks' fixed costs or to contribute to the remuneration of the banks' equity.
One possible answer could be that some of the costs are not associated with a
corresponding money outflow. As long as a bank sets its loan rates such that the
expected losses are covered, the money inflow ­ on average ­ is equal to or exceeds the
money outflow. However, if a bank invests in bonds, it receives interest that covers the
expected losses and it receives ­ on top of this ­ a credit risk premium, i.e. the costs we
derive are, at least in part, opportunity costs. Another possible explanation may be a
price setting across different sources of income. For instance, liquidity and payment
management is financed by low remuneration of current accounts, but there may also be
fees associated with, say, the current accounts.
21
5.2 Justification of the decomposition
As stated earlier, the results of the decomposition of a bank's net interest margin are not
right or wrong. There are no items in the profit and loss account about the exact
decomposition. If we define, for instance, earnings from term transformation as the
income of a passive trading strategy with the same interest rate risk, then we can only
make a point that the calculation is economically sensible or not. To do so, we explain
the bank's actual net interest margin by the components we derived.

regressions. Robust standard errors in parentheses. ***, **, * denote significance on a 1
percent, 5 percent or 10 percent level, respectively; "Expected credit losses" are the
expected losses in a bank's credit portfolio as stated in Equation (1); "Corporate bonds"
is the contribution to a bank's net interest margin stemming from its bond holdings; for
the other variable definitions see Table 2. All variables are divided by the banks' total
assets.
22
In Table 6, we show to what extent the different components can explain the banks' net
interest margin. We estimate the relationship as laid down in Equation (3), but only in
the cross-section for the year 2012, not as a panel. As explained above, we can only
determine the contribution of bearing credit risk for the year 2012, because we need a
time series of ten years (which correspond to the period of available data) to estimate
the contribution in the tenth year. We see the following results. First, the expected
losses in a bank's credit portfolio have an impact on the net interest margin of less than
one, at least in the specification where all variables are included. For the reason outlined
above, we choose the single variable regression (second column in Table 6); here the
coefficient is 1.363. However, we have to admit that this coefficient is only estimated
with relatively low precision and that it is not statistically significantly greater than one.
This said, we interpret the difference to one as the premium for bearing credit risk. This
risk premium is estimated to be about 36% of the expected credit losses.
The composition of the credit portfolio explains about 6.1% of the cross-sectional
variation of the banks' net interest margin. Second, the corporate bonds' credit risk
premium (including the expected losses) explains 3.6% of this variation. What is more,
the coefficient is close to one, the theoretical value. Third, the component for the term
transformation is ­ as all the components ­ highly significantly positive, but this
component is significantly different from one. Memmel (2011) showed that the cross-
sectional explanatory power of this variable is relatively low. Therefore, we run a fixed-
effects panel regression (results available on request) to see whether the time series
estimate of the coefficient is not statistically different from one. The time series estimate
is highly significantly positive and greater than the cross-sectional coefficient, but still
significantly smaller than one.
Fourth, costs for the clients' liquidity and the payment management explain nearly 23%
of total variation, which illustrates the importance of this component. The coefficient is
relatively close to one, although statistical equality to one is rejected. Concerning
operating costs, we furthermore run tests to justify the appropriateness of the chosen
cost function estimated in Section 3.3 in Equation (6) and (7). In specification I-a to I-d
we interpret
1
 as the variable unit costs stemming from interest-generating activities.
As we assume a linear relationship between operating costs and the income
components, variable unit costs correspond to marginal costs. From a theoretical point
23
of view, cost minimization of products measured in the same unit (here: euros of
operating income) requires equal marginal costs in the different product lines. Under the
assumption that banks minimize costs, the rejection of the equality of the marginal
costs, i.e.
0 1 2
:
H  
 , would give us a sign for misspecification. The corresponding
tests are reported in Table 3 and we see that the coefficients are not statistically
different.
We also obtain indications that these coefficients do not suffer from omitted variables.
Table 3 indicates that coefficients remain stable when introducing the trading income
(TRADE). We have also tested the equality of the coefficients in this specification. The
equality of the coefficients is only rejected when comparing the coefficient for the
variable TRADE and net interest income. One possible explanation could be that the
coefficient for other income sources may be overestimated, since we have ignored
negative values. Furthermore, for multicollinearity reasons, we abstain from accounting
for non-linearity in both specifications in terms of introducing squared terms. 13
Comparing specification I and II, specification II seems more advantageous, because, in
this approach, a bank's operating costs can be explained by economically meaningful
variables that have roughly the same explanatory power as the variables in specification
I. We use specification II-b in order to calculate the specific costs, as the differentiation
between PAYMENTS-IN and PAYMENTS-OUT seems useful, although the inclusion of
a time trend and the interaction term do not provide any further information.
All in all, there is evidence that the components for credit risk, term transformation, and
liquidity and payment management for the customers are sensibly chosen.
6 Conclusion
This paper is about quantifying the components of the banks' net interest margin. The
results have several implications. First, the liquidity and payment management for the
banks' clients need to be more in the focus of research. Issues like technical progress in
the payment management and other efficiency gains could be explored in more detail.
Second, stress tests on the banks' net interest margin should take into account the
component of liquidity and payment management for their customers. Up to now, such
13 Correlations between variables and their squared terms in specification I and specification II are about
90 %.
24
stress tests have focused mainly on the banks' credit and interest rate risk. Third, there
is a contribution to the question of which part of the banks' net interest margin is due to
functions that banks perform with an advantage over other market participants. There is
little doubt that banks have an advantage in carrying out liquidity and payment
management for their customers and the same holds true for the banks' loan granting
business. Concerning term transformation, especially the interest rate risk, which
accounts for up to one-third of the median bank's net interest margin, the literature says
that banks have only limited advantages in bearing this risk. That is to say, banks could
hand over their interest rate risk to the markets by means of appropriate positions in
interest swaps and no problems seem to arise from information asymmetries or wrong
incentives. The same is true of their bond positions.
In this paper, we investigate the German banking system. German banks are said to rely
greatly on earnings from term transformation. Nevertheless, there is reason to believe
that the large share of the net interest margin that is due to cost and earnings
management is a feature that is common to banking systems in many countries.

Appendix
A.1 Weighting function
In this appendix, the weighting function ( )
h  is derived, i.e. the function that shows how
past and current expected credit loss rates for an industry are to be weighted for the
contribution to the net interest margin that covers the expected losses in a bank's credit
portfolios (See Equation(1)). The expected loss rates  
, ,
m
t j m
 in
m
t in the industry j for
newly granted loans with maturity m are relevant for today, i.e. in time t , for loans that
were granted in time
m
t and have not matured yet, i.e. :
m
m v t t
   . We make two
assumptions. First, the expected loss rate in time
m
t is the same for all the loans in the
initial maturity bracket under consideration, i.e.   , ,
, ,
m
m t j k
t j m
 
 . Second, the loan
volume for a certain initial maturity m is spread equally across the maturity bracket k ,
i.e. ( , , ) 1/ ( )
k k k k
g m a b b a
  , where ( )
g  is the density, and
k
a and
k
b are the lower and
upper bounds of the maturity bracket k , respectively. In a given time span t
 , the
fraction 1/ m t
  of loans with initial maturity m has to be renewed to have a constant
balance sheet. For 1
k k
a b
  and 0 :
m k
v t t a
    , the expression for the weighting
function ( )
h  is therefore
 
   
 
1 1

where :
m
v t t
  is the time difference between today t and the point in time
m
t in the
past.
In the event that
k k
a v b
  , we can express ( )
h  as
 
   
 
1 1

1
ln ln

As we have only yearly data for the expected credit loss rates, we calculate the yearly
average of the weighting function, i.e.

For 1

and for 1 1

1
ln( ) ( 1) ln( 1) ln( ) 1
l k k

h b l l l l

.
This can be seen using the formula ln( ) ln( )
x dx x x x C
   
 . For the first maturity
bracket, i.e.
1
0
a  and
1
1
b  , the function ( )
h  and its average
0,1
h are set to one. The
values of the weighting function
