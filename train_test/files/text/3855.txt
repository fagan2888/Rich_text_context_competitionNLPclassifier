Introduction
Prostate cancer is the most common intrinsic male organ
malignancy in the world and the second leading cause of can-
cer death in American men, behind only lung cancer, with
about 233 000 new cases per year; among these patients, about
29 480 men will die of prostate cancer.1 The incidence of pros-
tate cancer in Taiwan is not as high as in the United States, but
it is increasing every year. To date, surgery, radiation therapy,
chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and/or immunotherapy are
used to treat cancers. Immunotherapy that promotes tumor
eradication through activating innate and adaptive immune
responses, including nonspecific stimulators, cytokines, mono-
clonal antibodies, radiolabeled antibodies, immunotoxins, and
cell-based therapy, is still a relatively new and promising
method in cancer treatments.2 During the tumor development
process, tumor cells may escape immune surveillance, imply-
ing that the restoration of the immune surveillance ability in
the host may improve cancer treatments.3,4 Accumulative clini-
cal results have indicated that immune-based therapies may
play a role in the treatment of patients with prostate and other
malignancies.5
Among cancer immunotherapy investigators, the grow-
ing interest over the past 2 decades in controlling the
immune system to get rid of cancer has heightened character-
ization of cytokines to exploit their vast signaling networks to
develop cancer treatments.6 Modulating cytokine secretion
profiles by immune cells using active immunomodulatory

Immune Cell­Conditioned Media
Suppress Prostate Cancer PC-3 Cell
Growth Correlating With Decreased
Proinflammatory/Anti-inflammatory
Cytokine Ratios in the Media Using 5
Selected Crude Polysaccharides
Hsiao-Chien Lin, MS1 and Jin-Yuarn Lin, PhD1
Abstract
Five different crude polysaccharides from guava seed (GSPS), bitter buckwheat (BBPS), common buckwheat (CBPS), red
Formosa lambsquarters (RFLPS), and yellow Formosa lambsquarters (YFLPS) were isolated to treat human prostate cancer
PC-3 cells via direct action or tumor immunotherapy. The splenocyte- and macrophage-conditioned media (SCM and
MCM) were prepared using individual selected polysaccharides, and then SCM or MCM was further collected to treat
PC-3 cells. The relationship between PC-3 cell growth and Th1/Th2 cytokines in SCM as well as proinflammatory/anti-
inflammatory cytokine secretion profiles in MCM were delineated. The results showed that all 5 selected polysaccharides
did not significantly inhibit PC-3 cell growth via direct action. However, SCM or MCM cultured in the absence or presence
of 5 selected polysaccharides significantly (P < .05) inhibited PC-3 cell growth. MCM cultured with 5 polysaccharides dose
dependently enhanced their inhibitory effects on the viabilities of PC-3 cells than those cultured without polysaccharides.
There was a significant (P < .05) negative correlation between PC-3 cell viabilities and (interleukin [IL]-6 + tumor necrosis
factor [TNF]-)/IL-10 level ratios in the corresponding MCM, implying that macrophages suppress PC-3 cell growth
through decreasing secretion ratios of proinflammatory/anti-inflammatory cytokines in a tumor microenvironment.

components may be a smart and effective strategy to treat
cancer via changing the tumor microenvironment in the
host. The growing evidence indicates that diets rich in veg-
etables and fruits reduce the risk of numerous chronic dis-
eases, including cancer. In addition, different fruits and
different parts of one fruit could be used in different ways
for the prevention and treatment of different cancers.7 The
combination of immunotherapy and plant-derived effective
components may provide a chance to treat prostate cancer.
Among active immunomodulatory components, particu-
lar polysaccharides are recognized as biological response
modifiers and may enhance the immune surveillance of
tumor cells. Recently, PS-F2, a polysaccharide purified
from Ganoderma formosanum, was shown to exert signifi-
cant antitumor activity via its immunological competence
to the host but not direct cytotoxicity to the tumor cells.
Both cellular and humoral immune responses in the host
contributed to PS-F2­induced tumor rejection, and PS-F2
can function as a vaccine adjuvant to stimulate the produc-
tion of antigen-specific antibodies.8 Particular polysaccha-
rides may exist in other different sources. Food materials
such as grains and fruit seeds that are rich in polysaccha-
rides deserve to be further studied for their anti­prostate
cancer potential.
Curative therapies for advanced or recurrent forms of
prostate cancer are still absent, mandating continued devel-
opment of novel, more effective treatment regimens.
Recently, natural ingredients have been found to have vast
potential for treating cancer, with potentially fewer side
effects than most of today's cancer therapies. Five selected
polysaccharides from guava seed, common buckwheat, bit-
ter buckwheat, red Formosa lambsquarters, and yellow
Formosa lambsquarters cultivated in Taiwan were found to
have diverse immunomodulatory potential. However, the
effects of these selected polysaccharides on human prostate
cancer PC-3 cells remain unclear. To unravel the puzzle,
these 5 polysaccharides were isolated to treat PC-3 cells via
direct action or tumor immunotherapy. Splenocyte- and
macrophage-conditioned media (SCM and MCM) were
prepared using selected polysaccharides and further col-
lected to treat PC-3 cells. The relationship between PC-3
cell growth and Th1/Th2 cytokine secretion profile in their
corresponding SCM as well as proinflammatory/anti-
inflammatory cytokine secretion profile in their correspond-
ing MCM were delineated.
Materials and Methods
Isolation of 5 Selected Polysaccharides
To isolate polysaccharides, seeds of fresh guava (Psidium
guajava Linn) fruit were first carefully collected and then
air dried at 40°C overnight for use. The air-dried seeds of
guava, common buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum), bitter
buckwheat (Fagopyrum leptopodum), red Formosa lambs-
quarters (Chenopodium formosanum), and yellow Formosa
lambsquarters (Chenopodium formosanum) were individu-
ally ground to powder using a grinding machine and then
passed through a 60-mesh sieve. To avoid disturbance in the
subsequent polysaccharide extraction procedure, the lipids
in the powder samples were removed using n-hexane (1:4,
weight/volume). The mixtures were shaken at room tem-
perature for 4 hours. After settling, the liquid phase contain-
ing n-hexane and oil was removed. The remaining solid
sample was air dried at room temperature to evaporate the
trace hexane. The de-fatted powder samples were stored at
-20°C until use.
To extract polysaccharides, aliquots of de-fatted powder
of guava seed, common buckwheat, bitter buckwheat, red
Formosa lambsquarters, and yellow Formosa lambsquarters
were added to 5 to 10 volumes of deionized water and
shaken at room temperature for 4 hours. The resultant mix-
tures were centrifuged at 5000 ×g for 30 minutes at room
temperature. The supernatant was collected, measured, and
volumetrically added with 3 volumes of 95% ethyl alcohol.
The mixtures were slowly shaken at 4°C for 12 hours to
precipitate the polysaccharides and centrifuged at 5000 ×g
for 30 minutes at room temperature to separate the insoluble
polysaccharides from the supernatant. The insoluble poly-
saccharide pellet was collected to evaporate any trace ethyl
alcohol. The polysaccharide pellet was lyophilized and
stored at -30°C until use. Five isolated polysaccharides,
including guava seed polysaccharides (GSPS), common
buckwheat polysaccharides (CBPS), bitter buckwheat poly-
saccharides (BBPS), red Formosa lambsquarters polysac-
charides (RFLPS), and yellow Formosa lambsquarters
polysaccharides (YFLPS) were obtained for the following
experiments. All 5 isolated polysaccharides have been par-
tially characterized. All 5 isolated polysaccharide fractions
had maximal absorption peaks around 210 to 230 nm, with
a minor peak around 260 to 280 nm. Total carbohydrate and
protein contents in these isolated polysaccharides indicated
that the isolated polysaccharides were proteopolysaccha-
rides or glycoproteins. Generally, crude polysaccharides
were contaminated by coextracted proteins. Unfortunately,
the step to remove proteins in the purification procedure
was skipped in this study, although the removal of proteins
may also discard particular proteopolysaccharides or glyco-
proteins in the crude polysaccharides. Among these isolated
polysaccharides, GSPS presented the highest sugar content
(60.7%), whereas BBPS had the highest protein content
(85.6%). Five isolated polysaccharides were further puri-
fied and identified using Sepharose 6B gel filtration col-
umn. Each isolated polysaccharide separated into 2 to 3
subfractions. The molecular weight (MW) of each subfrac-
tion was calibrated with a standard compound (blue dex-
tran, MW = 2000 kDa, Sigma­Aldrich Co, MO) or protein
MW standards kit (MWGF 1000 kit, MW: 6500-670 000
Lin and Lin NP15
Da, Sigma, MO) using the Sepharose 6B gel filtration col-
umn. MWs of guava seed polysaccharide subfraction 1
(coded as GSF1), GSF2, and GSF3 in GSPS were distrib-
uted at 6.1 × 105 kDa, 3.3 × 104 kDa, and 6.8 kDa; common
buckwheat polysaccharide subfraction 1 (coded as CBF1),
CBF2, and CBF3 in CBPS were distributed at 4.5 × 104
kDa, 1.8 × 102 kDa, and 9.4 kDa; bitter buckwheat polysac-
charide subfraction 1 (coded as BBF1), BBF2, and BBF3 in
BBPS were distributed at 4.5 × 104 kDa, 2.5 × 102 kDa, and
13 kDa; red Formosa lambsquarters polysaccharide sub-
fraction 1 (coded as RFLF1) and RFLF2 in RFLPS were
distributed at 6.2 × 104 kDa and 9.4 kDa; yellow Formosa
lambsquarters polysaccharide subfraction 1 (coded as
YFLF1) and YFLF2 in YFLPS were distributed at 3.3 × 104
kDa and 9.4 kDa, respectively.
Polysaccharides have highly complex structures and
species specificity. In generalized definition, polysaccha-
rides may include simple polysaccharides, glycoproteins,
and proteopolysaccharides. In general, polysaccharides are
soluble in water but insoluble in alcohol. However, the seed
samples are rich in starch, which is highly soluble in hot
water but insoluble in cold water. Hot water may extract a
great deal of starch from the samples and destroy active
ingredients. Therefore, a standard protocol with a slight
modification was used to extract the polysaccharides. The
samples were extracted using cold water (room tempera-
ture) rather than hot water (70°C-100°C) in this study.
Because all 5 isolated polysaccharides contain sugar and
proteins, they may be glycoproteins or mixtures of polysac-
charides and proteins. Because the characteristics of 5 iso-
lated polysaccharides consisting of sugars and proteins
have not been fully determined, they can be called crude
polysaccharides according to the generalized definition.
Isolation of Primary Immune Cells
Female BALB/cByJNarl mice (8 weeks old) were pur-
chased from the National Applied Research Laboratories,
Ministry of Science and Technology in Taipei, Taiwan,
ROC. The experimental mice were maintained in the
Department of Food Science and Biotechnology at National
Chung Hsing University, College ofAgriculture and Natural
Resources in Taichung, Taiwan, ROC. The animals were
provided chow diet (laboratory standard diet) and water ad
libitum. All mice were housed in stainless steel cages and
kept at a controlled temperature (23°C ± 2°C) and ambient
humidity (50%-75%). Lights were maintained on a 12-hour
dark-light cycle. After acclimation for 2 weeks, the experi-
mental mice were killed humanely for isolating primary
immune cells, including splenocytes and peritoneal macro-
phages. The animal use protocol listed in this study was
reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal care and
Use Committee (IACUC Approval No: 101-95R), National
Chung Hsing University, Taiwan, ROC.
The protocol was performed as described previously.9-11
Briefly, the experimental mice (10 weeks old) were anes-
thetized with diethyl ether and immediately bled using
retro-orbital venous plexus puncture to collect blood.
Immediately after blood collection, the animals were killed
humanely using CO

inhalation. Peritoneal macrophages
were prepared by lavaging the peritoneal cavity with 2 ali-
quots of 5-mL sterile Hank's balanced salts solution
(HBSS)--50 mL of 10× HBSS (Hyclone Laboratories Inc,
South Logan, UT), 2.5 mL of antibiotic-antimycotic solu-
tion (100× antibiotic mixture containing 10 000 units peni-
cillin, 10 mg streptomycin, and 25 µg amphotericin B per
mL in 0.85% saline; Atlanta Biologicals Inc, Norcross,
GA), 20 mL of 3% bovine serum albumin (Sigma-Aldrich

(Wako, Osaka, Japan), 425 mL sterile water--for a total of
10 mL through the peritoneum. The peritoneal lavage fluid
was centrifuged at 400 ×g for 10 minutes at 4°C. The cell
pellets were collected and resuspended in tissue culture
medium (TCM; a serum replacement, Celox Laboratories
Inc, Lake Zurich, IL), suspended in a medium consisting of
10 mL TCM, 500 mL Roswell Park Memorial Institute
1640 medium (Atlanta Biologicals Inc, Norcross, GA), and
2.5 mL of antibiotic-antimycotic solution (100× PSA). The
peritoneal adherent cells (>90% of macrophages) from each
animal were adjusted to 2 × 106 cells/mL in TCM medium
with a hemocytometer, using the trypan blue dye exclusion
method.9 Isolated mouse primary peritoneal macrophages
were used for subsequent experiments.
Immediately after the peritoneal cavity of the experi-
mental mice was lavaged for preparing peritoneal macro-
phages, the spleen was aseptically removed from the
experimental mice and homogenized in TCM medium.
Single splenocytes were collected and treated with red
blood cell (RBC) lysis buffer (0.017 M Trizma base [Sigma-
Aldrich Co], 0.144 M ammonium chloride [Sigma-Aldrich
Co], pH 7.4, 0.20 µm filtered) to lyse the RBCs. Splenocytes
isolated from each animal were adjusted to a concentration
of 1 × 107 cells/mL in TCM medium with a hemocytometer,
using the trypan blue dye for subsequent experiments.10,11
Preparation of SCM and MCM in the Absence
or Presence of the 5 Selected Polysaccharides
To achieve noncytotoxic optimal concentrations of 5
selected polysaccharide fractions, the cell viabilities of
macrophages treated with individual polysaccharides at
different concentrations were determined using 3-(4,5-
dimethylthiazol-2-diphenyl)-2,5-tetrazoliumbromide
(MTT, Sigma, MO) assay. All polysaccharide stock solu-
tions were aseptically diluted into working solutions using
TCM medium before use. The splenocytes or macrophages

(50 µL/well) in the absence or presence of polysaccharides
(50 µL/well) at the indicated final concentrations of 0, 1.6,
8, 40, 200, 500, and 1000 µg/mL in 96-well plates were
incubated at 37°C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO
2
and 95% air for 72 and 48 hours, respectively. The cell via-
bility was determined using MTT assay. GSPS, CBPS,
BBPS, RFLPS, and YFLPS at the same concentrations of
1.6, 8, 40, and 200 µg/mL were found to be noncytotoxic
doses for primary immune cells (data not shown); thus,
these noncytotoxic optimal doses at 1.6, 8, 40, and 200 µg/
mL were selected to treat PC-3 cancer cells through direct
action or tumor immunotherapy via preparing immune cell­
conditioned media (CMs).
To prepare an immune cell CM, isolated splenocytes (1
× 107 cells/mL TCM medium, 0.5 mL/well) or peritoneal
macrophages (2 × 106 cells/mL TCM medium, 0.5 mL/
well) were cocultured with GSPS, CBPS, BBPS, RFLPS,
and YFLPS at the indicated noncytotoxic concentrations of
0, 8, 40, and 200 µg/mL TCM medium (0.5 mL/well) in
24-well plates, respectively. The plates were incubated at
37°C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO
2
and 95% air
for 48 hours. The cultured plate was centrifuged at 400 ×g
for 10 minutes to collect the supernatant (ca 1.0 mL/well) in
the cell cultures--namely, SCM or MCM. The supernatant
of immune cell cultures was collected and lyophilized. The
lyophilized SCM or MCM was dissolved in 0.5 mL F-12K
medium: F12 Kaighn's modification medium supplemented
with 7% fetal bovine serum, penicillin (100 units/mL), strep-
tomycin (100 µg/mL), and amphotericin B (0.25 µg/mL).
The 2-fold concentrated CM was stored at -80°C until use.
Additionally, to clarify the relationship between cytokine
secretion profiles by immune cells and PC-3 cell viability,
levels of Th1 (interleukin [IL]-2) and Th2 (IL-10) cytokines
in SCM, and proinflammatory (IL-1, IL-6, and tumor
necrosis factor [TNF]-) and anti-inflammatory (IL-10)
cytokines in MCM were measured using a sandwich ELISA
according to the cytokine ELISA protocol from the manu-
facturer's instructions (mouse DuoSet ELISA Development
system, R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN).12
Effects of the 5 Selected Polysaccharides on the
Growth of Human Prostate Cancer PC-3 Cells
The human prostate cancer PC-3 cell line was purchased
from Bioresource Collection and Research Center (Food
Industry Research and Development Institute, Hsinchu,
Taiwan, ROC). The PC-3 cells were maintained in F-12K
medium at 37°C in a humidified incubator with 95% air and
5% CO
2
. After they had grown to 90% confluence in a 75T
tissue culture flask (TPP Biochrom AG, Trasadingen,
Switzerland), the PC-3 cells were plated at a density of 2 × 105
cells/mL in 96-well plates to perform the following bioassay.
To evaluate the direct action of 5 isolated polysaccha-
rides on PC-3 cell growth, PC-3 cells (2 × 105 cells/mL, 50
µL/well) were treated with GSPS, CBPS, BBPS, RFLPS, and
YFLPS (50 µL/well) at the indicated final concentrations of 0,
1.6, 8, 40, and 200 µg/mL F-12K medium as well as paclitaxel
(as a positive control) at 2.5 µ for 24 and 48 hours, respec-
tively. The cell viability of PC-3 cells was determined using
MTT assay.After incubation, aliquots of 10 µLof MTT (5 mg/
mL in PBS) were added to each well in the 96-well plate. The
plates were incubated at 37°C in a humidified incubator with
5% CO
2
and 95% air for another 4 hours. The plates were cen-
trifuged at 400 ×g for 10 minutes, and the culture supernatant
was carefully discarded. The cell pellet was carefully washed
with PBS buffer twice. Aliquots of 100 µL dimethyl sulfoxide
were added to each well and oscillated for 30 minutes to lyse
cell membrane to extract formed insoluble formazan in mito-
chondria. The absorbance (A) was measured at 550 nm on a
plate reader (ELISA reader, ASYS Hitech, GmbH, Austria).
The cell viability was expressed as the relative percentage
compared with the mean absorbency of the control. The cell
viability percentage in each biological determination was cal-
culated using the following equation: Cell viability (percent-
age of control) = [(Asample
- A
blank
)/(A
control
- A
blank
)] × 100.12
To evaluate the effects of cytokine immunotherapy on
PC-3 cell growth, PC-3 cells (2 × 105 cells/mL; 50 µL/well)
were treated with SCM (50 µL/well) or MCM (50 µL/well)
as well as paclitaxel (as a positive control) at 2.5 µ, respec-
tively, for 24 and 48 hours. To evaluate the possible interfer-
ence of different media used in the cell line (F-12K medium)
and primary cells (TCM medium), PC-3 cells cultured in
TCM medium alone were also selected as a negative control.
The remaining survival cells were measured using MTT
assay. PC-3 cells cultured in F-12K medium alone (a nega-
tive control) were selected as a control to calculate the
effects of SCM or MCM treatments. The cell viability (%) in
each biological determination was calculated using the fol-
lowing equation: Cell viability (percentage of control) =
[(A
sample
- A
blank
)/(A
control,F-12K
- A
blank
)] × 100.12
Statistical Analysis
Results are expressed as the mean ± SD. Differences
between means were compared using 1-way ANOVA, fol-
lowed by Duncan's multiple range test using the SPSS sys-
tem 19.0. The association between cytokine levels in CM
and the viabilities of PC-3 cells was described as the Pearson
product-moment correlation coefficient (r). P values <.05
were considered significant.
Results and Discussion
Direct Action of the 5 Selected Polysaccharides
on PC-3 Cell Growth
In our previous study, administration of GSPS, CBPS,
BBPS, RFLPS, or YFLPS at the indicated concentrations of
Lin and Lin NP17
1.6, 8, 40, and 200 µg/mL was found to be noncytotoxic to
primary immune cells. To evaluate direct action of 5
selected polysaccharides on PC-3 cell growth, the 5 isolated
polysaccharides at the indicated concentrations of 1.6, 8,
40, and 200 µg/mL were added to PC-3 cells for 24 or 48
hours, respectively. Paclitaxel administration at 2.5 µM was
selected as a positive control. The results showed that
administration of GSPS, BBPS, CBPS, RFLPS, and YFLPS
at the indicated concentrations could not significantly (P >
.05) inhibit the PC-3 cell viability as compared with that of
the control (Figure 1). Contrary to our anticipation, direct
administrations with 5 selected polysaccharides, particu-
larly CBPS and BBPS, slightly increased PC-3 cell viabili-
ties. Polysaccharides such as -glucans were found to have
cytoprotective and genoprotective effects on lymphocytes.13
Therefore, an indirect action of polysaccharides to treat
tumor cells through immunotherapy shows a promising
pathway. We assumed that direct administration of certain
polysaccharides might enhance the growth of PC-3 cancer
cells via stimulating particular receptors on the cancer cells
in vitro. However, it remains to be further studied.
Importantly, paclitaxel administration at 2.5 µM signifi-
cantly (P < .05) decreased the PC-3 cell viability, indicating
that paclitaxel may be applied to the treatment of PC-3 can-
cer cells via direct action to the cancer cells (Figure 1).
Effects of SCM or MCM on PC-3 Cell Growth
To evaluate the effect of cytokine immunotherapy using
immune cell CMs in the absence or presence of 5 polysac-
charides on PC-3 cell growth, PC-3 cells were treated with
SCM or MCM for 24 or 48 hours, respectively. PC-3 cells
cultured in F-12 K medium alone for 24 or 48 hours were
selected as a control to calculate the cell viability. The
results showed that there are no significant differences of
PC-3 cell viabilities between F-12 K medium and TCM
medium alone. Identically, paclitaxel (a positive control) at
2.5 µM significantly inhibited (P < .05) PC-3 cell growth
either through 24 or 48 hours of incubation compared with
the negative controls (Figure 2). Importantly, SCM treat-
ments significantly (P < .05) inhibited PC-3 cell viability
either through 24 or 48 hours of incubation as compared
with the negative controls. However, SCM cultured with
different concentrations of the 5 polysaccharides did not
show enhanced, but rather slightly decreased, inhibitory
effects on the viabilities of PC-3 cells relative to those cul-
tured without the 5 polysaccharides. Because these 5 poly-
saccharides were not removed from the SCM, the remaining
polysaccharides in the SCM might slightly increase the
growth of PC-3 cells via direct action (Figure 1). Most
important, SCM cultured without the 5 polysaccharides
exhibited a better inhibitory effect on PC-3 cell viability
than paclitaxel administration at 2.5 µM either through 24
or 48 hours of incubation (Figure 2). Our results indicate
that treatments of PC-3 cancer cells through tumor immu-
notherapy using splenocytes might have the better inhibi-
tory effect than that of chemotherapy using paclitaxel
(Figure 2).
Figure 3 shows the effects of MCM treatments on the
growth of PC-3 cells. The results showed that MCM treat-
ment significantly (P < .05) inhibited PC-3 cell viability
either through 24 or 48 hours of incubation as compared
with the negative controls (Figure 3). Importantly, MCM
cultured with different concentrations of the 5 polysaccha-
rides, particularly GSPS, CBPS, and YFLPS, showed
slightly and dose-dependently, although not significantly (P
> .05), enhanced inhibitory effects on the viabilities of PC-3
cells relative to those cultured without the 5 polysaccha-
rides (Figure 3). Because these 5 polysaccharides were not
removed from MCM, the remaining polysaccharides in
MCM might slightly increase the growth of PC-3 cells via
direct action (Figure 1), interfering with the net effect of
MCM. In addition, MCM cultured without the 5 polysac-
charides exhibited a better inhibitory effect on PC-3 cell
viability than paclitaxel administration at 2.5 µM, particu-
larly through 48 hours of incubation (Figure 3). Our results
indicate that treatments of PC-3 cancer cells through tumor
immunotherapy using immune cells might have better
inhibitory effect than that of chemotherapy.
In comparison with the effects of SCM and MCM admin-
istrations, both SCM and MCM presented inhibitory effects
on PC-3 cell viability, implying that immune cells, includ-
ing splenocytes and macrophages, might be involved in
anticancer activities in vivo. We hypothesized that cyto-
kines secreted by these immune cells are key contributors to
inhibiting the growth of PC-3 cells through cytokine che-
motherapy. To clarify the puzzle, associations between
cytokine secretion levels in the corresponding CM and via-
bilities of PC-3 cells were further analyzed.
Associations Between Cytokine Secretion Levels
in the CMs and Cell Viabilities of PC-3 Treated
With Their Corresponding CMs
To clarify the correlation between cytokine secretion levels
and cancer cell survival, the relationship between cytokine
levels secreted by immune cells and viabilities of PC-3 cells
treated with CM cultured without or with the 5 selected
polysaccharides were determined using Pearson's correla-
tion coefficients (r). Figure 4 shows associations between
the viabilities of PC-3 cells treated with SCM for 24 or 48
hours and IL-2, IL-10, or IL-10/IL-2 cytokine secretion
profiles in their corresponding SCM. The results showed
that the viability of PC-3 cells through 24 or 48 hours of
incubation did not significantly (P > .05) correlate with
IL-2 (Th1 cytokine), IL-10 (Th2 cytokine), and IL-10/IL-2
(Th2/Th1) secretion profiles by splenocytes, implying that
there was a weak correlation between the PC-3 cell viability

cytokines secreted in the SCM should be further analyzed to
provide stronger evidence.
Figure 5 shows associations between viabilities of PC-3
cells treated with MCM for 24 or 48 hours and IL-1, IL-6,
TNF- (proinflammatory cytokines), IL-10 (anti-inflamma-
tory cytokine), or (IL-6 + TNF-)/IL-10 cytokine secretion
profiles in their corresponding MCM. Contrary to our
expectedness, results showed that the PC-3 cell viability
through 24 hours of incubation significantly (P = .031) and
negatively (r = -0.221) correlated with IL-1 (proinflam-
matory cytokine) secretion by macrophages, demonstrating
that IL-1 might play a role in the inhibition to PC-3 cell
viability (Figure 5A). However, more evidence should be
accumulated to clarify the phenomenon. Importantly, the
results showed that the PC-3 cell viability through 24 hours
of incubation significantly (P  .0001) and negatively (r =
-0.385) correlated with (IL-6 + TNF-)/IL-10 (proinflam-
matory/anti-inflammatory) cytokine secretion ratios by
macrophages, indicating that increasing anti-inflammatory

cytokines but decreasing proinflammatory cytokines by
macrophages might inhibit the PC-3 cell viability (Figure
5I). Unfortunately, the significant correlation disappeared
after 48 hours of incubation (Figure 5J), showing that the
cytokine chemotherapy might just be effective for a short
period, resulting from the short half-life of cytokines.
Currently, the prevalent choices for treating human can-
cer are surgical resection, general chemotherapy, and radia-
tion therapy.14 Recently, the ability of the immune system to
fight cancer has been recognized and partially understood.
Tumor cells may be directly destroyed by immune cells,
such as natural killer cells and cytotoxic T cells in vivo.
However, tumor cells may escape immune surveillance, so
that they cannot be killed in time.3,4 Tumor immunotherapy
endeavors to promote tumor eradication through the activa-
tion of innate and adaptive immune responses, including
nonspecific stimulators, cytokines, monoclonal antibodies,
radiolabeled antibodies, immunotoxins, and cell-based
therapy.2 Accumulative clinical results reported that
immune-based therapies may play a role in the treatment of
patients with prostate and other malignancies.5 In the pres-
ent study, our results indicated that the PC-3 cell viability
treated with MCM through 24 hours of incubation signifi-
cantly (P  .0001; r = -0.385) negatively correlated with
(IL-6 + TNF-)/IL-10 (proinflammatory/anti-inflammatory)
cytokine secretion ratios by macrophages, implying that
increasing anti-inflammatory cytokines but decreasing pro-
inflammatory cytokines by macrophages might inhibit the
PC-3 cell viability (Figure 5I). Furthermore, maintaining
low inflammation status in vivo may inhibit the growth of
prostate cancer.Adopting dietary changes, such as a diet rich
in antioxidant or anti-inflammatory components, to regulate
the immune system may promote anticancer properties. Our
results showed that MCM cultured with different concentra-
tions of the 5 polysaccharides slightly and dose-dependently,
although not significantly (P > .05), enhanced their inhibi-
tory effects on the viabilities of PC-3 cells relative to those
cultured without the 5 polysaccharides (Figure 3), indicat-
ing that these selected polysaccharides might increase anti-
cancer abilities of immune cells, particularly macrophages
but not splenocytes (Figure 2), via their anti-inflammatory
potential. However, the anticancer mechanism of these
selected polysaccharides through tumor immunotherapy
should be further clarified.
Fucoidan, a polysaccharide from Undaria pinnatifida,
was found to induce the apoptosis of PC-3 human prostate
cancer cells via the inactivation of the ERK1/2 MAPK sig-
naling pathway, cell cycle arrest, and downregulation of the
Wnt/-catenin signaling pathway.15 Polysaccharide frac-
tions F1 and F2 from Cymbopogon citratus induce apopto-
sis by reducing mitochondrial transmembrane potential and
increasing pro-(Bax) apoptotic gene expression in Siha and
LNCap cells.16 Glycoproteins from Cyclocarya paliurus
leaves inhibit the growth of human gastric cancer HeLa cells
through keeping cell cycle arrest in the S phase, which may
further induce apoptosis.17 However, direct administrations of
GSPS, CBPS, BBPS, RFLPS, or YFLPS to PC-3 cells at the
indicated concentrations of 1.6, 8, 40, and 200 µg/mL did not
significantly (P > .05) inhibit the growth of PC-3 cells (Figure
1), but MCM cultured with different concentrations of the 5
polysaccharides did dose dependently enhance their inhibitory
effects on the viabilities of PC-3 cells (Figure 3). It is suggested
that these selected polysaccharides might exert their anticancer
abilities against PC-3 cells, via regulating particular immune
cells suchasmacrophagestoincreaseanti-inflammatorycytokine
production but decrease pro-inflammatory cytokine production in
vivo (Figure 5I). The anticancer properties of polysaccharides
have been shown to be primarily mediated through 3 approaches:
(1) direct cytotoxicity, (2) immunoenhancement, and (3) syner-
gistic effects in combination treatment with conventional

anticancer drugs.18 Based on our results from these 5 iso-
lated polysaccharides, we uncover another possible antican-
cer property of polysaccharides--that is, to decrease secretion
ratios of proinflammatory/anti-inflammatory cytokines in a
tumor microenvironment. After digestion of particular poly-
saccharides, certain immune cells in Peyer's patches in the
small intestine may be regulated to secrete cytokines into the
blood stream and constitute an immune environment in the
body. An anti-inflammatory immune environment in the body
may help inhibit the growth of human prostate cancers.
In the present study, we showed that SCM or MCM
inhibited the growth of PC-3 cells, possibly via the pathway
of cytokine immunotherapy (Figures 2, 3, and 5).
Mammalian models, such as the mouse, have been preemi-
nent in modeling human diseases, primarily because of the
striking homology between mammalian genomes and the
many similarities in aspects spanning from anatomy to cell
biology and physiology.19 The overall structure of the
immune system in mice and humans is quite similar.20,21
Therefore, mouse primary immune cell CMs were selected
to treat PC-3 cells. SCM, that is, CM of splenocytes con-
taining 41.54% B cells and 47.11% T cells, could reflect the
status of the adaptive immune system,22 whereas MCM,
that is, CM of macrophages containing higher than 90%
macrophages, could reflect the status of the innate immune
system. Our results further demonstrated that B lympho-
cytes, T lymphocytes, and macrophages might contribute to
the inhibition of PC-3 cell growth. However, characteriza-
tions and anticancer mechanisms of the 5 selected polysac-
charides remain to be further studied in the future.
Among the 5 selected polysaccharides, GSPS, CBPS,
and YFLPS had the better anticancer activity through tumor
immunotherapy (Figure 3). Guava (Psidium guajava)
shows potential for the treatment of different diseases--for
example, it has anti-inflammatory, antidiarrheal,23
antidiabetic,24 antihypertensive, antimicrobial,25 hepatopro-
tective,26 antiallergic,27 and anticancer/antitumor potential.28,29
Recently, guava leaf hexane fraction was found to modulate
both PI3K/AKT/mTOR/S6K1 and MAPK signaling path-
ways, leading to apoptosis through downmodulating pro-
teins that mediate tumor cell survival, proliferation,
metastasis, and angiogenesis in PC-3 cells.30 The present
study is the first to report an anticancer property of guava
seed polysaccharides through tumor immunotherapy.
Buckwheat, a herbaceous plant that belongs to the
Polygonaceae family, has been used for foods and tradi-
tional medicine in Taiwan. Buckwheat proteins were
reported to have anticancer activity.31 Buckwheat polysac-
charide has the potential to stimulate cytokine secretion by
peripheral blood mononuclear cells and to induce leukemic
THP-1 cell differentiation by both direct and indirect
treatments.32 The present study is the first to investigate the
effect of buckwheat polysaccharides on the growth of
human prostate cancer cells via tumor immunotherapy.
Formosa lambsquarters, which was found to have diverse
immunomodulatory potential, is an endemic species culti-
vated in Taiwan. The present study is the first to probe into
the effect of Formosa lambsquarters polysaccharides on the
growth of human prostate cancer cells via tumor immuno-
therapy. The application of particular polysaccharides using
tumor immunotherapy to treat certain cancers may be prom-
ising and provide an alternative choice for curing cancers.
The major purpose of this study was to evaluate and com-
pare the immunomodulatory potential of different polysac-
charides and their effects on human prostate cancer PC-3
cells to screen potent polysaccharides for the treatment of
prostate cancer. The purified fractions of most potent poly-
saccharides will be further subjected to thorough study in
the future.
Conclusions
In the present study, GSPS, CBPS, BBPS, RFLPS, and
YFLPS did not significantly inhibit PC-3 cell growth via
direct action. However, SCM or MCM cultured in the
absence or presence of the 5 selected polysaccharides sig-
nificantly (P < .05) inhibited PC-3 cell growth. MCM cul-
tured with 5 polysaccharides, particularly GSPS, CBPS,
and YFLPS, dose dependently enhanced their inhibitory
effects on the viabilities of PC-3 cells relative to those
cultured without polysaccharides. There was a significant
(P < .05) negative correlation between PC-3 cell viabili-
ties and (IL-6 + TNF-)/IL-10 level ratios in the corre-
sponding MCM, implying that macrophages suppress
PC-3 cell growth through decreasing secretion ratios of
proinflammatory/anti-inflammatory cytokines in a tumor
microenvironment.
