The purpose of this study was to conduct a preliminary
examination of the relationships among executive functions,
identity, and career decision-making in traditional-aged stu-
dents in their first two years of college. Executive functions
are mediated by the prefrontal cortex of the brain (e.g.,
Welsh, 2001) and incorporate processes involved in goal-
directed behavior (Welsh, Friedman, & Spieker, 2006).
Recently, authors have speculated that a relationship exists
between executive function and identity (Phillips, 2008;
Shanahan & Pychyl, 2007), and research identifying the rela-
tionship between identity and career decision-making is well
established (Blustein, Devenis, & Kidney 1989; Vondracek,
Schulenberg, Skorikov, Gillespie, & Wahlheim, 1995). This
literature begs the question whether there are relationships
among all three constructs, executive function, identity, and
career decision-making, and, if so, what is the nature of this
relationship? Currently, there is no published research
directly examining whether individual differences in execu-
tive functions are related to variations in identity status or
career decision-making, the latter being a major focus of
future-oriented planning in college students. Of particular
interest in this study was the degree to which identity and
executive functions may jointly predict the levels of career
certainty or uncertainty among college students.
Identity Development and Career
Decision-Making
The extant literature clearly demonstrates empirical evidence
for the theoretical connection between identity and career
decision-making, with much of this research based on
Marcia's (1966) extension of Erikson's original theoretical
work on identity development. According to Marcia, an indi-
vidual may be classified into four identity statuses according
to one's level of exploration and commitment: identity
achievement (exploration and commitment), identify fore-
closure (commitment with no exploration), moratorium
(exploration with no commitment), and identity diffusion (no
exploration or commitment). The relationship between iden-
tity development and career development is well established.
For example, Blustein et al. (1989) studied a sample of col-
lege students to examine the relationship between identity

Executive Function, Identity, and Career
Decision-Making in College Students
Marilyn Welsh1 and Sarah Schmitt-Wilson2
Abstract
This study examined the relationship among executive function, identity, and career decision-making as self-reported
by 82 college students. Participants were administered measures of executive function, identity status, career decision-
making, and an index of verbal intelligence. After controlling for intelligence, self-reported difficulties with the metacognitive
component of executive function were related to lower levels of identity achievement and higher levels of moratorium
and diffusion. Difficulties with behavioral regulation were associated with higher levels of moratorium and foreclosure.
Hierarchical multiple regressions with backward elimination indicated that individual differences in career certainty was best
explained by metacognitive control and identity achievement. In contrast, variation in career uncertainty was predicted by
verbal intelligence, behavior regulation, and low and high scores on identity achievement and diffusion, respectively. These
preliminary results fill a gap in the current literature on career decision-making, suggesting the importance of executive
function skills to this milestone process in the lives of emerging adults.

formation, as measured by the Extended Objective Measure
of Ego Identity Status (EOM-EIS; Bennion & Adams, 1986),
and career development. Their results suggested a negative
relationship between moratorium status and occupational
commitment, whereas identity achievement was positively
related to occupational commitment. In addition, there was a
relationship between career exploration and identity for the
moratorium and identity achievement statuses, indicating
that processes involved in the establishment of general iden-
tity (exploration and commitment) are similar to activities
comprising the career development process.
Similarly, Vondracek et al. (1995) found that junior high
and high school students who had successfully achieved
identity scored lower on all but one career indecision sub-
scales, as measured by the Career Decision Scale (CDS;
Osipow, 1987; Osipow, Carney, Winer, Yanico, & Koschier,
1976). Unexpectedly career indecision scores did not differ
for students classified as foreclosed, moratorium, and dif-
fused, despite the lack of commitment characterizing the lat-
ter two statuses. The authors conclude that differences in
career indecision can at best differentiate identity-achieved
individuals from those in the other three identity groups.
Although the relationship between identity and career
exploration continues to be investigated and refined, current
research exploring cognitive contributions to career deci-
sion-making is sparse by comparison. One might speculate
that by their very nature the processes of exploration and
commitment would involve cognitive skills such as plan-
ning, decision-making, monitoring, and organization. The
empirical question is as follows: To what degree do compo-
nents of executive function contribute to the career decision-
making process?
Cognitive Factors in Career Decision-
Making and the Possible Role of
Executive Function
Current literature exploring the career decision-making pro-
cess in adolescents and emerging adults has examined vari-
ous predictors in addition to identity, such as attachment
history or style (e.g., Downing & Nauta, 2010; Germeijs, &
Verschueren, 2009) and personality traits (e.g., Bullock-
Yowell, Andrews, & Buzzetta, 2011; Mojgan, Kadir, &
Soheil, 2011). In terms of cognitive contributions to the pro-
cess of occupational exploration and commitment, reported
research examines constructs such as "thinking styles" (Kim,
2011), dysfunctional career thoughts (e.g., Bullock-Yowell
et al., 2011; Bullock-Yowell, Andrews, McConnell, &
Campbell, 2012), and career decision-making self-efficacy
(e.g., Bullock-Yowell et al., 2012; Germeijs & Verschueren,
2009; Tang, Pan, & Newmeyer, 2008). Of these three predic-
tors, career decision-making self-efficacy (Betz & Luzzo,
1996; Taylor & Betz, 1983) shares the most parallels with
executive function, a construct that has not been examined
explicitly as a predictor of career decision-making.
Career decision-making self-efficacy is defined as an
individual's beliefs about his or her capability to successfully
carry out a variety of tasks related to the career decision-
making process (Taylor & Betz, 1983). The construct has
been demonstrated to be positively related to decision-mak-
ing certainty (Bullock-Yowell et al., 2012; Germeijs &
Verschueren, 2009) and negatively related to dysfunctional
career thoughts (Bullock-Yowell et al., 2012). More impor-
tantly, the Career Decision Self-Efficacy Scale (CDSE-SF;
Betz, Klein, & Taylor, 1996) assesses individual differences
in self-appraisal, gathering occupational information, goal
selection, making plans for the future, and problem solving.
It is here that the parallels with components of executive
functions of self-monitoring, goals setting, planning, and
strategic problem solving become apparent. Despite the
potential that executive functions could underlie career deci-
sion-making self-efficacy, to our knowledge there has not
been any published studies that have explicitly linked execu-
tive functions to career decision-making processes, such as
certainty and uncertainty. There is, however, a small emerg-
ing literature exploring the association between executive
function and identity development in adolescents and emerg-
ing adults and, given that career exploration and commit-
ment is a major element of identity development, this
literature is of interest, as well.
Executive Functions and Identity
Development
The role of executive function in identity formation has been
the focus of theoretical speculation in several studies; how-
ever, the empirical evidence is indirect, at best. For example,
Phillips (2008) proposed that brain development should play
a role in the development of identity, and he interprets
increases in identity achievement with age by stating,
"Identity scholars can no longer ignore the role played by
brain maturation on identity. New knowledge about brain
development must be integrated into models of identity if the
models are to accurately describe identity processes"
(Phillips, 2008, p. 214). However, Phillips (2008) did not
incorporate any direct or indirect measures of brain function
in his study, or a single measure of executive function, for
that matter. The fact that brain development and function
underlie identity development, as it does every other human
behavior, should not be in dispute; however, whether frontal
brain systems are most integrally involved in this process
remains an empirical question that can only be addressed by
including measures of executive function in these studies.
The indirect findings linking executive function with
identity are exemplified by studies such as that of Norvilitis
and Reid (2002), which identified associations between
executive function and gender identity. Their finding that
executive functions related to the masculine characteristics
of leadership and independence might suggest a connection
between executive functions and identity achievement;
Welsh and Schmitt-Wilson 3
however, the Marcia identity statuses were not measured in
this study. Similarly, Shanahan and Pychyl (2007) examined
the relationships among identity, procrastination, and agency,
and found the construct of procrastination correlated nega-
tively with achievement scores and positively with morato-
rium scores. The authors proposed relationship between
identity and procrastination that included a role for executive
function. Despite the fact that the authors suggest that execu-
tive function is necessary to complete the processes of explo-
ration and commitment involved in identity development,
there were no formal measures of executive function included
in this study.
Purpose
The purpose of this study was to fill in the gaps of the current
literature, particularly with regard to the potential contribu-
tion of executive function to career decision-making cer-
tainty and uncertainty. First, we examined the associations
between identity and executive function, after controlling for
verbal intelligence in a sample of traditional-aged, first- and
second-year college students. Although past research has
hinted at such associations, typically direct measures of
executive function and identity statuses are not included in
the same study. We hypothesized that individuals reporting
lower levels of executive function difficulties will report
higher levels of identity achievement, specifically, due to the
commitment and exploration required for identity achieve-
ment and the putative contribution of executive functions to
the goal-directed behaviors that would be required. We also
hypothesized that individuals reporting greater executive
function difficulties would indicate higher levels of diffu-
sion, a stage characterized by a lack of exploration and com-
mitment. It was unclear whether executive function would be
associated with the other identity statuses of moratorium and
foreclosure.
Second, we examined the prediction of career decision-
making certainty and uncertainty by identity and executive
function. Based on prior research suggesting a relationship
between identity and career decision-making (Blustein et al.,
1989; Vondracek et al., 1995), it was hypothesized that there
would be a relationship between identity achievement and
career certainty (i.e., confidence in future career plans) and a
negative relationship between diffusion and career uncer-
tainty (i.e., indecision about future career plans). As dis-
cussed previously, there is no literature exploring the
contribution of executive function, per se, to the career deci-
sion-making process. However, the strong evidence for the
contribution of career decision-making self-efficacy (e.g.,
Bullock-Yowell et al., 2012; Germeijs & Verschueren, 2009)
suggests the involvement of executive function processes.
This exploratory study examined for the first time whether
components of executive function, metacognition and behav-
ior regulation, as well as identity jointly predict career cer-
tainty and uncertainty.
Method
Participants
The sample consisted of 82 college students (42 Males and
40 Females) in their first two years of school, drawn from the
introduction to psychology courses at a midsized university
located in the Rocky Mountain region of the United States.
The mean age of the participants was 18.87 years (SD =
0.868). Although we did not record ethnicity of our partici-
pants, the students were recruited from a general education
course that most likely reflects the ethnic make-up of the uni-
versity as a whole. The university has 22% of the undergrad-
uate students who identify as ethnic minorities: 3% African
American, 2%Asian, 13% Hispanic, and less than 1% Native
American. According to Green (1991), the sample size of 82
provides adequate power to detect a large effect size. Such an
effect size could be anticipated on the basis of a substantial
empirical literature linking identity with career decision-
making and a strong theoretical base to predict associations
between executive function and identity and career decision-
making. Participants completed the study as one method of
fulfilling a requirement for the introductory psychology
course.
Measures
Extended Objective Measure of Ego Identity Status­Revised
(EOM-EIS-R).The EOM-EIS-R (Bennion & Adams, 1986;
Downing & Nauta, 2010) was used to measure the students'
identity status. The EOM-EIS-R is a measure comprising 64
items (with Likert-type responses ranging from 1 to 6) with
16 items pertaining to each of the four identity statuses (dif-
fusion, foreclosure, moratorium, and identity achievement)
as defined by Marcia (1980). Total scores for identity
achievement, foreclosure, moratorium, and diffusion were
created by combining the total scores for the interpersonal
ideological subscales (Blustein et al., 1989). Results of over
20 studies demonstrated internal consistency from .30 to .91
with a median of .66. Results appear to be stable over time
with an average test-retest reliability of .76 (Adams, 1998).
According to Adams (1998), the instrument demonstrates
construct, discriminant, and convergent validity in studies
involving samples consisting of college students. The predic-
tive and concurrent validity of the EOM-EIS-R has been
established by examining correlations between the identity
subscales and measures of self-acceptance, intimacy, and
authoritarianism (Adams, 1998). These correlations were
significant, albeit in the low to moderate range, and consis-
tent with theoretical expectations. In the current study, the
Cronbach's alpha was .689.
CDS.The CDS (Osipow, 1987; Osipow, Carney, Winer, et
al., 1976; White & Tracey, 2011) consists of 18 items (2
comprising the certainty and the remaining 16 the indecision
scales respectively). Respondents completed Likert-type
4 SAGE Open
ratings ranging from 1 (low similarity with item) to 4 (high
similarity with item). Reliability estimates obtained from
university students found test-retest correlations ranging
from .82 to .90 (Osipow, Carney, & Barak, 1976). Among
participants in the current sample, measures of internal con-
sistency produced Cronbach's alpha of .818 for the CDS.
The CDS Manual (Osipow, 1987) reports several studies
demonstrating the validity of the CDS as a measure of career
decision-making. In terms of concurrent validity, the CDS
scales significantly correlate in the expected direction with
the Assessment of Career Decision Making (ACDM; Buck
& Daniels, 1985; as cited in Osipow, 1987) and with the
Attitude Scale of the Career Maturity Inventory (CMI;
Crites, 1973; as cited in Osipow, 1987). In addition, the dis-
criminative validity of the measure is demonstrated by sev-
eral studies in which the CDS significantly distinguished
between college students self-reporting a commitment to a
future career vs. those self-reporting a lack of occupational
commitment (Osipow, 1987).
Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function. The Behavior
Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF; Guy,
Isquith, & Gioia, 2004) consists of 80 questions rated by the
individual on a scale of never, sometimes, and often (high
scores = deficits). This measure includes the Metacognitive
Index (MCI; working memory, planning/organization, orga-
nization of materials, and task completion subscores) and
Behavioral Regulation Index (BRI; inhibition, shifting, emo-
tional control, and monitor subscores). The overall internal
consistency reliability in the current study was .919 for the
BRIEF. Moreover, reliabilities for the BRIEF range from .93
for the BRI to .95 for the MCI with an overall reliability of
.96 for the instrument (BRIEF; Guy et al., 2004). Convergent
and divergent validity for the BRIEF is evidenced by the
high correlations between the BRIEF and other self-report
measures of "behavioral, emotional, academic, and atten-
tional functioning and were not correlated with measures of
somatization on the CBCL/YSR and BASC-SR" (BRIEF;
Guy et al., 2004, pp. 77-78). Furthermore, the two factors,
the MCI and BRI, were supported by factor analysis, account-
ing for 70% in the variance among a nonclinical sample (N =
1,000).
Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale­Fourth Edition (WAIS-IV).The
Vocabulary subtest of the WAIS-IV (Wechsler, 2008) is a
commonly used test of crystallized verbal intelligence. The
Vocabulary subtest has a test-retest stability of .89, and a
split-half reliability of .94. In addition, this subtest correlates
with the vocabulary subtest of the WAIS-III at .87 and it is
the single best indicator, among the other subtests, of the
Full-Scale IQ (FSIQ) score, correlating with FSIQ at .72
(Groth-Marnat, 2009). The complete test consists of 33
words (increasing in difficulty as the test progresses) used to
measure participants level of verbal knowledge. The test was
individually administered utilizing procedures outlined in
Wechsler (2008) but was shortened from 33 to 26 for time
purposes. In scoring the test, each word was scored on a scale
of 0 to 2 points by a member of the research team. An inde-
pendent scorer then verified the scores and inter-rater reli-
ability was 90%. The researcher addressed and rescored all
discrepancies and final scores were calculated.
Procedure
The study involved two sessions, each lasting approximately
1 hr. Each participant had to complete the first phase of the
study before completing the second. On arrival at the first
session, all participants signed in and they were given an
identification card to be used for admittance into the second
session of the study (a procedure used to ensure participant
confidentiality). During the first session, participants were
tested in groups of 10 to 20 and completed the BRIEF, the
CDS, and the EOM-EIS-R. The second session consisted of
the individual administration of the WAIS-IV, in addition to
other tasks as part of a larger study.
Analysis
Correlation coefficients were used to look at the relationship
between executive function, as measured by the BRIEF, and
identity, as measured by the EOM-EIS-R. Backward elimi-
nation regression analysis was utilized to explore the rela-
tionship between executive function, identity, and career
decision-making after controlling for intelligence. The anal-
ysis included entering all of the variables into the model then
progressively deleting predictors until only significant pre-
dictors remained in the final model. These regression analy-
ses were tested for the following assumptions: linearity,
independence, normality, and equal variances (Montgomery,
Peck, & Vining, 2001).
Results
Descriptive Statistics
Means and standard deviations for each of the tasks are pre-
sented in Table 1. Independent t-tests found no significant
sex differences among the major dependent variables; there-
fore, all analyses were conducted collapsing over gender.
Relationships Between Identity Statuses and
Executive Functions
Correlational analyses were conducted between the main
summary scores of each of our experimental measures of
identity and executive function, and represent partial correla-
tions controlling for verbal intelligence (i.e., vocabulary
score). To facilitate interpretation of these correlations, it is
important to note here that high index scores on the BRIEF
(MCI/metacognitive control and BRI/behavior regulation)
Welsh and Schmitt-Wilson 5
indicate executive function difficulties. There were statisti-
cally significant positive correlations between the BRIEF
MCI index and identity diffusion, r(68) = .235, p < .050, as
well as the BRIEF BRI index and identity foreclosure r(68)
= .315, p < .008. Identity moratorium was positively corre-
lated with the MCI, r(68) = .362, p < .002, and the BRI, r(68)
= .397, p < .001. There was a negative correlation between
the identity achievement and the MCI, r(68) = -.408, p <
.001, while the correlation between identity achievement and
the BRI, r(68) = -.218, p < .070, represented a statistical
trend (Table 2).
Regression Analyses of Executive Function,
Identity, and Career Decision-Making
Separate regression analyses were conducted to examine the
best predictors of career decision-making certainty and
career decision-making uncertainty. For each analysis, the
vocabulary score was entered into the first step. The purpose
of using the vocabulary score as a covariate in these analyses
was to account for the possibility that a portion of the shared
variance between the executive function and identity mea-
sures, and that of career decision-making was due to verbal
ability. Given that all three constructs were measured by
means of self-report, each survey is likely to tap verbal skills
to some extent. In the second step of the analysis, the two
executive function variables (MCI and BRI) and four iden-
tity variables (Identity Achievement, Moratorium, Diffusion,
and Foreclosure) were entered into the model. Next, a pro-
cess of backward elimination was conducted, such that only
significant predictors of career certainty and uncertainty
were included in the final model.
In the prediction of Career Certainty, the regression analy-
sis including vocabulary as a covariate, identity achieve-
ment, and executive function, specifically the metacognitive
index of the BRIEF, explained 28% of the variance, F(3, 70)
= 8.870, p = .000, R2 = .275. In this model, standardized beta
weights indicate that identity achievement,  = .324, p =
.004, and MCI,  = -.287, p = .011, were significant predic-
tors of Career Certainty, whereas vocabulary was not (Table
3). Alternatively, for the prediction of Career Uncertainty,
the regression analysis suggested a model consisting of
vocabulary, identify achievement, identity diffusion, and the
behavior regulation index that predicted almost 48% of the
variance in this construct. The full regression model was sig-
nificant, F(4, 67) = 15.475, p = .000, R2 = .480, and standard-
ized regression coefficients suggested that vocabulary,  =
­.214, p = .021; identity achievement,  = -.292, p = .003;
identity diffusion  = .409, p = .000; and the BRI index,  =
.270, p. = .004, were all significant predictors of Career
Uncertainty (Table 4).
Discussion
The goals of the current study were to fill the gaps in our
knowledge regarding the associations among three constructs
putatively related to a major milestone in emerging adult-
hood, the exploration of and commitment to a vocational

identity. Whereas previous research has established the link
between identity development and career decision-making,
the associations between a relevant domain of cognition,
executive function, and identity and career decision-making
have been unexamined to date. In general, there is little atten-
tion to the cognitive underpinnings of these constructs in the
recent literature on vocational development.
The findings of this study support a relationship between
identity and career decision-making that has been reported in
the literature (e.g., Blustein et al., 1989; Vondracek et al.,
1995), with career certainty predicted by higher scores on
identity achievement. In contrast, career uncertainty was neg-
atively related to identity achievement, but positively related
to moratorium and diffusion, consistent with the characteriza-
tion of these two identity statuses with regard to a lack of
commitment. These results are consistent with the conclu-
sions of Blustein et al. (1989) who found that occupational
commitment was positively related to identity achievement,
and such associations are not surprising given that a subset of
the questions on the EOM-EIS-R are related to the occupa-
tional decision-making aspects of identity development.
In addition, this study expanded on previous research sug-
gesting a link between executive function and identity by
explicitly testing this relationship with specific measures of
each construct. Our results provide empirical support for the
theoretical speculation of Norvilitis and Reid (2002) and
Shanahan and Pychyl (2007) that there is a relationship
between executive function and identity status. Consistent
with our predictions, the metacognition component of execu-
tive function (working memory, planning/organization, orga-
nization of materials, and task completion) was related to the
successful attainment of identity achievement, necessitating
commitment and exploration. Furthermore, increased levels
of metacognition were negatively correlated with identity
diffusion, characterized by a lack of commitment and explo-
ration. These results suggest a possible role for working
memory, planning/organization, organization of materials,
and task completion in the process of exploring and commit-
ting to a chosen identity in emerging adults.
Moratorium, characterized by a lack of commitment, was
associated with reports of greater difficulties with the
metacognitive index and the behavioral regulation index.
This demonstrates that individuals who are actively explor-
ing, but have not yet committed to a direction or plan, are
also self-reporting problems with aspects of executive func-
tion such as planning, working memory, and organized
behavior, as well as the executive function components of
emotion regulation, inhibition, and flexibility. One interpre-
tation is that those students who are aware of their active
exploration, but also their lack of commitment, may view
their own executive functions as inadequate not only in their
daily behaviors but also in the process of developing a strong
sense of identity. In addition, we found that the difficulties
with the behavioral regulation component of executive func-
tion were related to the identity status characterized by a lack
of exploration, that is, foreclosure. One interpretation is that
individuals with lower levels of inhibition, shifting, emo-
tional control, and monitor are more likely to commit to an
identity before exploring all possible options, perhaps
because they see themselves as not having the types of skills
required to support such exploration. Interestingly, behav-
ioral regulation was only moderately related to identity
achievement, and was not significantly related to identity
diffusion.
The major thrust of our study, however, was to examine
the joint contributions of identity and executive function to
career decision-making, especially levels of certainty and
uncertainty. Whereas, the literature clearly establishes a role
for identity (e.g., Blustein et al., 1989; Vondracek et al.,
1995) there is a need to explore the contribution of cognitive
skills to this decision-making process. The hierarchical mul-
tiple regression analyses demonstrated that identity achieve-
ment and executive function, specifically the metacognitive
index, were significant predictors of career certainty. The
results suggest that individuals with greater levels of work-
ing memory, planning/organization, organization of materi-
als, and task completion along with higher levels of identity
achievement are more likely to report greater certainty about
their plans for their future career. These findings are consis-
tent with the "planning style" of exploration (Lumberg,
1987) and "job search intensity" (Werbel, 2000) that are both
related to vocational growth. In addition, the results dovetail
nicely with the literature on the importance of career deci-
sion-making self-efficacy to the process of career develop-
ment. As reported in several studies (e.g., Bullock-Yowell et
al., 2011, 2012; Tang et al., 2008), this manifestation of self-
efficacy involves confidence in one's ability to plan, set
goals, and engage in organized, strategic behavior, and this
degree of confidence is positively related to career decision-
making. It makes sense that one's confidence in such abili-
ties would be related to one's self-perception of strengths in
the underlying skills---planning, goal setting, organized
behavior---that is, executive functions. Our findings demon-
strate that self-reported executive function skills are, indeed,
positively related levels of career decision-making certainty.
In contrast, an individual's scores on verbal intelligence,
identity diffusion, identity achievement, and the behavior

regulation component of executive function best predict
career uncertainty. That is, those college students with greater
career uncertainty indicated problems with emotion regula-
tion, inhibition, and flexibility, while endorsing the identity
diffusion status and demonstrating lower scores on the iden-
tity achievement status. Such a pattern of results is also con-
sistent with the current research examining the role of career
decision-making self-efficacy in the levels of career indeci-
sion (i.e., uncertainty) in adolescents and emerging adults.
The finding that the behavior regulation aspect of executive
functions more reliably predicted career uncertainty supports
other authors' speculations that "affectively charged" cogni-
tions (Cassidy, 1990; cited in Germeijs, & Verschueren,
2009) are evident during career indecision phases. The com-
ponents of the behavior regulation index of the BRIEF may
be considered to be "hot" executive functions (e.g., Egeland
& Fallmyr, 2010) or those executive functions infused with
emotional and motivational forces. In addition, Gati and
Amir (2010) point out that career decision-making difficul-
ties (i.e., indecision, uncertainty) frequently involve general
indecisiveness, problems obtaining information, and chal-
lenges distinguishing reliable from unreliable information.
Our finding that low vocabulary (perhaps reflective of other
intellectual deficits) was related to career uncertainty, but not
certainty, might suggest how verbal intelligence, along with
executive function impairments, interfere with the explora-
tion and information gathering that can lead to a diffused
identity and higher levels of career uncertainty.
Limitations
Whereas this study provides a foundation for the further
investigation of executive function, identity, and the role of
each in the career decision-making process, we must note
several limitations. This preliminary study included a rela-
tively small sample of traditional-aged students early in their
college career, and further research would benefit from the
investigation of the relationship between executive function,
identity, and career decision-making among individuals in
different age groups, as well as in varying situations (e.g.,
non-college educated young adults). For example, we were
perplexed by the finding that neither the Moratorium nor
Foreclosure identity statuses were significant predictors of
career certainty or uncertainty in our study. One speculation is
that, in a relatively homogeneous typical sample, the
"extremes" of the identity variable (i.e., IdentityAchievement
that involves exploration and commitment, and Diffusion that
involves neither exploration nor commitment) emerge as the
most sensitive predictions. Similarly, studying a non-college
sample of emerging adults might provide more variability in
the BRIEF measure of executive functions and allow an
examination of how more serious impairments in executive
function may affect the career decision-making process.
Further limitations include the fact that correlational find-
ings cannot determine cause and effect, and future studies
should use longitudinal designs and path analysis to deter-
mine whether causal and meditational relationships among
these constructs can be determined. Moreover, it is important
to note that, given that the measures used in this study were
self-report, there is the possibility of shared measurement
variance and a halo effect artificially increasing the correla-
tions observed.
Research Directions and Practical Implications
This study builds on previous research and explores the role
of executive function, a mechanism not previously investi-
gated as factor instrumental in the career development pro-
cess. Importantly, exploration of the connections between
executive functions and career decision-making self-efficacy
will be a potentially fruitful area of future inquiry. It may be
the case that career decision-making self-efficacy is the
mediator between executive function and the career deci-
sion-making process. Moreover, the current evidence of the
role of executive function abilities in the prediction of career
certainty is potentially helpful for counselors, parents, and
teachers. The logical extension of this finding is that activi-
ties that may increase basic levels of executive function and
the subsequent likelihood of identity achievement may better
prepare adolescents and emerging adults for making deci-
sions about their futures. In addition, career counselors may
be able to use the predictors of career uncertainty found in
this study--lower vocabulary, executive function deficits,
and a particular pattern of identity status--to identity stu-
dents who might be at risk for delayed or difficult career
exploration and commitment.
Conclusions
Notwithstanding the limitations stated above, this study rep-
resents an important contribution to an emerging literature
that has been replete with speculations, but few direct inves-
tigations of the contribution of executive function to identity
and to career decision-making.According to the current find-
ings, elements of self-reported executive function are related
to identity statuses and differentially predict the domains of
career decision-making certainty and uncertainty. Continued
research utilizing direct measures of executive/prefrontal
function will illuminate the manner in which neurological
development may influence identity development, voca-
tional development, as well as other important domains of
future planning characteristic of emerging adulthood.
