Summary: To examine trends in HIV prevalence in the US
household population, serum or urine samples from 2 National
Health and Nutrition Examinations Surveys (NHANES) (1988Y1994
and 1999Y2002), were tested for HIV antibody. In the 1999 to 2002
survey, data on risk behaviors, CD4 T lymphocytes, and antire-
troviral therapy (ART) were also available. In the 1988 to 1994
survey, there were 59 positive individuals of 11,203 tested. In
NHANES 1999 to 2002, there were 32 positive individuals of 5926
tested. The prevalence of HIV infection among those aged 18 to
39 years in NHANES 1988 to 1994 was 0.38% (95% confidence
interval [CI]: 0.22Y0.68) as compared with 0.37% (95% CI: 0.17 to
0.80) in 1999 to 2002. Prevalence did not change significantly
between surveys in any race and/or ethnic or gender group among
18- to 39-year-old participants. HIV prevalence was 3.58% (95% CI:
1.88 to 6.71) among non-Hispanic blacks in the 40- to 49-year-old
age group in 1999 to 2002, but the age range available in NHANES
1988 to 1994 was 18 to 59 years and does not allow direct comparison
of prevalence. Cocaine use and the presence of herpes simplex virus-
2 antibody were the only significant risk factors for HIV infection for
non-Hispanic blacks. Fifty-eight percent of infected individuals not
reporting ART had CD4 T-lymphocyte counts G200 cells/mm3
compared with 18.2% on therapy and 12.5% of participants newly
informed of their HIV status.
Key Words: national survey, HIV antibody, prevalence
(J Acquir Immune Defic Syndr 2006;41:651Y656)
As part of the overall surveillance activities to monitor the
HIV epidemic in the United States, testing for HIV
antibody has been included in 2 National Health and Nutrition
Examination Surveys (NHANES III conducted in 1988Y1994
and NHANES 1999Y2002). The prevalence of HIV from
NHANES III was 0.33% for those aged 18 to 59 years, with a
population estimate ranging from 290,000 to 733,000
infected individuals based on this representative sample of
the civilian noninstitutionalized household population of the
United States.1,2
Data from NHANES 1999 to 2002 provide the
opportunity to estimate the change in HIV prevalence in the
general household population since NHANES III. In the 10
years between the 2 surveys, the number of new AIDS cases
and deaths declined substantially after the introduction of
combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) in the late 1990s.
The number of estimated new HIV infections has remained
stable at approximately 40,000 per year; therefore, the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has estimated that
the number of individuals living with HIV infection continues
to increase.3 Surveillance data of persons diagnosed with HIV
infection has also demonstrated a changing epidemic that now
disproportionately affects poor and minority individuals.4
The NHANES 1999 to 2002 HIV prevalence provides an
estimate of the current epidemiology of infection in the general
household population. CD4 T-lymphocyte testing was also con-
ducted on HIV-positive individuals and age-matched controls to
examine the current state of immune function in infected parti-
cipants compared with noninfected individuals. In addition,self-
reported data on medication use in this survey provided insight
into treatment of HIV-infected individuals, and data on self-
reported risk behaviors provided informationon the contribution
of these behaviors in the general household population.
METHODS
Study Populations and Sample Design
The NHANES are a series of cross-sectional surveys
designed to provide national statistics on the health and
nutritional status of the general household population through
household interviews, standardized physical examinations,
and the collection of biologic samples in special mobile
examination centers (MECs).
The sampling plan of each survey has been a stratified,
multistage, probability cluster design that selected a sample
representative of the US civilian noninstitutionalized
population.5,6
In NHANES III, conducted from 1988 to 1994, 11,203
participants aged 18 to 59 years were anonymously tested for
antibody to HIV. Because the testing was conducted

anonymously, the only information linked to the HIV
antibody status was age group (18Y39 years and 40Y59
years), race and/or ethnicity, and gender. In 1999, the
NHANES became a continuous survey with data released in
2-year cycles. HIV antibody prevalence estimates from 1999
to 2002 are presented in this article. During these survey
years, HIV testing was not anonymous and was performed on
participants aged 18 to 49 years. Because age by individual
years was not associated with information on HIV status in
NHANES III, it is not possible to construct comparable age
groups for those aged 40 or more years across the 2 surveys.
In NHANES III and NHANES 1999 to 2002, race and/or
ethnicity was categorized as non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic
black, and Mexican American. Persons not fitting these
categories were classified as Bother[ and included in the total
population. In both surveys, Mexican Americans and black
Americans were sampled at a higher rate than other persons.
The HIV antibody test results were reported to
participants in NHANES 1999 to 2002 with other sexually
transmitted disease (STD) laboratory results using a call-in
password-protected system. If participants did not call for the
results, they were sent 3 reminder letters to encourage them to
call. Information on previous knowledge of HIV status was
obtained as part of the posttest counseling.
In the 1999 to 2002 survey, the HIV results can be
analyzed with other NHANES components and data. Vari-
ables analyzed include poverty index ratio calculated by
dividing total family income by the poverty threshold index
adjusted for family size at year of interview and categorized as
below poverty (G1) or at or above poverty (1 or above)7 and
education measured as last year of school completed and
grouped into 2 levels (less than high school graduate and high
school completed or more education) as well as marital status
grouped as married, living as married, or widowed; divorced
or separated; and never married. The sexual behavior and drug
use data were collected in a private room in the MEC using
an audio computer-assisted self-interviewing technique
(ACASI). The variables collected include use of cocaine and
intravenous drugs, age at first intercourse, lifetime number of
sexual partners, and history of male-to-male sex.
The NHANES 1999 to 2002 prescription drug use data
were collected during the household interview. Respondents
were asked: BHave you taken or used any medicines for which a
doctor`s or dentist`s prescription is needed in the past month?[
For each medication reported, the interviewer asked to see the
medication container to record the product names from the
label. If the container was unavailable (17% of all reported
products), the interviewer probed the subject for this
information.8
In both surveys, informed consent was obtained from
all participants and the National Center for Health Statistics,
CDC Ethical Review Board approved the protocols.
Laboratory Methods
In NHANES III, serum specimens were tested for HIV-
1 antibody using a US Food and Drug Administration
(FDA)Ylicensed enzyme immunoassay kit (Genetic Systems,
Redmond, WA or Organon-Teknika Corporation, Durham, NC).
Positive specimens were retested and confirmed by an FDA-
licensed Western blot assay (Biotech/Dupont, Rockville,
MD) and interpreted according to the Association of
State and Territorial Public Health Laboratory Directors
(ASTPHLD)/CDC criteria.9
In NHANES 1999 to 2002, serum specimens were tested
for HIV-1 and HIV-2 antibody (HIV-1/HIV-2 Peptide EIA,
Genetic Systems). HIV-1 was not differentiated from HIV-2
during these survey years; thus, positive results are identified
as HIV-positive without an indication of subtype in this article.
All repeatedly positive specimens were confirmed by Western
blot analysis (Calypte Serum Western blot; Calypte Biomedical
Corporation, Pleasanton, CA). NHANES participants who
consented to the HIV test but did not have venipuncture or
did not have sufficient serum available for the serum antibody
test were tested for HIV antibody using urine (Calypte HIV-1
Peptide EIA; Calypte Biomedical Corporation). Positive
specimens were retested and confirmed by Western blot analy-
sis (Calypte Urine Western blot; Calypte Biomedical
Corporation).10
Enumeration of CD4 T lymphocytes from NHANES
1999 to 2002 HIV-positive participants and age-matched
controls was performed on cryopreserved whole blood using
the method reported by Fiebig et al.11 Samples were batch-
thawed quickly with 8 to 10 samples per batch in a 37-C
water bath and analyzed within 2 hours of setup. The CD4
T-lymphocyte cell counts were obtained using the Becton
Dickinson MultiTEST reagent in TrueCOUNT tubes (Becton
Dickinson Immunocytometry Systems, San Jose, CA).
Comparison of this method with fresh normal whole blood
resulted in a correlation coefficient of 0.97, with a slope of
0.92 and a mean bias of j67.2 (CDC, unpublished data).
Antibody to herpes simplex virus (HSV)-2 was
determined by a type-specific immunodot assay. Details
about this method have been previously reported.12
Statistical Analyses
Prevalence estimates for both surveys were weighted to
represent the total civilian noninstitutionalized US household
population in the age groups covered in each survey and to
account for oversampling and nonresponse to the household
interview and physical examination but not for nonresponse to
phlebotomy. The weights were further ratio-adjusted by age,
gender, and race and/or ethnicity to the US population control
estimates from the current population survey adjusted for
undercounts.13 Standard errors were calculated using
SUDAAN (Research Triangle Institute, Research Triangle
Park, NC),14 a family of statistical procedures for analysis of
data from complex sample surveys. Ninety-five percent
confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using the logit
transformation.15 To examine possible predictors of seroposi-
tivity, differences in prevalence were evaluated by examining
P values calculated using a univariate t statistic obtained from a
general linear contrast procedure in SUDAAN. For total
comparisons between NHANES III and NHANES 1999 to
2002, data were age-adjusted by the direct method to the 2000
US population.16 Because the estimates are of small magnitude
relative to their standard errors (RSEs), all prevalence estimates
except for the total estimate in each survey were outside the
accepted RSE reliability cut point of less than 30%.17

The percentage of individuals on ART by CD4 T-
lymphocyte counts are not weighted because they are
provided to describe the characteristics of the HIV-positive
individuals in the survey rather than to provide national
estimates of these characteristics.
Response Rates
In NHANES III, 82.4% of selected participants aged 18
to 59 years agreed to be interviewed and 86.0% of these
(11,203 of 13,022 participants) agreed to the examination and
had sufficient serum available for the HIV assay. Response
rates were similar for both sexes (85.7% male and 87.5%
female) and age groups as well as for non-Hispanic whites
and blacks (85.7% and 85.9%, respectively) but were higher
for Mexican Americans (88.3%). No significant difference in
response rates was observed by demographic subgroup,
although the lowest response rate to the survey in this age
range was among never-married participants (84.3%). An
analysis of the potential effect of the differential response
using imputation of HIV results in nonrespondents resulted in
a reduction in prevalence.2
Overall, 81.5% of selected participants aged 18 to 49
years in NHANES 1999 to 2002 agreed to be interviewed,
and 91.8% of these (5926 of 6458 participants) agreed to the
examination and had blood or urine for the HIV test.
Response rates were similar for both sexes (92.2% of male
participants and 91.4% of female participants) and age
groups as well as for non-Hispanic whites and blacks (91.7%
and 91.9%, respectively) and were higher for Mexican
Americans (92.7%). There were no significant differences
in response rates by poverty index, education, or marital
status. Only 1 person (a 44-year-old black man) who reported
using HIV medications in the last 30 days during the
household interview did not have a blood or urine sample
available for HIV testing.
RESULTS
The prevalence of HIV infection among those aged 18
to 39 years in NHANES 1999 to 2002 (0.37%, 95% CI: 0.17
to 0.80) was not statistically different from the estimate from
NHANES III (0.38%, 95% CI: 0.22 to 0.68) for the same age
group (Table 1). The estimate among those aged 40 years and
older in NHANES 1999 to 2002 was 0.54% (95% CI: 0.29 to
1.03). The range of the estimated number of 18- to 49-year-
old individuals living with HIV infection in the United States
in 1999 to 2002 was 323,000 to 929,000. It is not possible to
compare prevalence estimates between the 2 surveys for
those aged 40 years and older, because data from a
comparable age group are not available. In NHANES 1999
to 2002, the prevalence in non-Hispanic blacks aged 40 to 49
years was 3.58% (95% CI: 1.88 to 6.71); non-Hispanic black
men aged 40 to 49 years (4.54%, 95% CI: 2.24 to 8.97) had
the highest prevalence. In NHANES III, prevalence among
non-Hispanic blacks can only be examined for the broader
age range of 40 to 59 years of age; therefore, direct
comparison of the prevalence of 0.86% (95% CI: 0.37 to
1.99) with the current survey cannot be made.
If HIV status were imputed for the 1 44-year-old black
man in NHANES 1999 to 2002 who reported using HIV
medications in the last 30 days during the household
interview but did not have a blood or urine sample available
for HIV testing, the overall prevalence estimate for the total
population and for non-Hispanic blacks would not change.
This individual was excluded from subsequent analyses.
In NHANES 1999 to 2002, HIV testing was linked to
survey data so that information on the demographic

characteristics and risk behaviors could be made available for
analyses along with HIV status (Table 2). Because there were
only 3 non-Hispanic white and 4 Mexican-American HIV-
positive individuals, sample sizes were too small to describe
associations with potential risk factors for these 2 groups in
any detail. Data are thus presented for the non-Hispanic
blacks and the total population. Despite this categorization,
low prevalence in all groups limited the statistical power to
identify significant differences between subgroups, although
most associations were in the expected direction. Only the
presence of antibody to HSV-2 was significantly associated
with increased in HIV positivity in the total and non-Hispanic
black populations. Non-Hispanic blacks who reported ever
using cocaine or street drugs had a significant increase in the
prevalence of infection (5.12%, 95% CI: 3.06 to 8.42 for users
vs. 1.73%, 95% CI: 0.97 to 3.07 for nonusers).
To provide an estimate of the current status of immune
function among infected NHANES 1999 to 2002 participants,
CD4 T lymphocytes were measured on the HIV-positive
blood samples and age-matched controls. Ten of 31 positive
samples (the other HIV-positive result was from a urine
sample with no blood obtained) had CD4 T-lymphocyte
counts of less than 200 cells/mm3. Testing of 34 age-matched
HIV-antibodyYnegative controls resulted in 1 individual with
a CD4 T-lymphocyte count less than 350 cells/mm3 (actual
value of 273 cells/mm3), and 1 individual had a count of 457
cells/mm3. All other individuals had cell counts ranging from
538 to 1640 cells/mm3. The CD4 T-lymphocyte distribution
for the 12 individuals with a blood sample for testing who
were newly diagnosed or did not report ART (No-ART) is
presented in Table 3. Seven of the 12 had CD4 T-lymphocyte
counts less than 200 cells/mm3 compared with 2 of the 11 on
ART. Among the 8 individuals who called in and reported
that they were newly diagnosed, only 1 had a CD4 T-
lymphocyte count of G200 cells/mm3. Skin testing for
Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB) was included in NHANES

1999 to 2000. None of the 18 HIV-positive individuals tested
in these years had a positive TB skin test. Overall 4.2% (95%
CI: 3.2 to 5.2) of NHANES participants aged 1 or more years
had a reactive TB skin test (CDC, unpublished data).
DISCUSSION
The NHANES are the only national population-based
surveys that provide an estimate of HIV antibody prevalence
in the US household population. Estimates from these surveys
can be used with those from national surveillance from
selected populations to provide a more complete picture of
the HIV/AIDS epidemic in the United States. Prevalence
estimates from the 2 surveys conducted approximately 10
years apart for those aged 18 to 39 years were not statistically
different. Data from NHANES 1999 to 2002 estimated that
between 270,000 and 905,000 individuals aged 18 to 49 years
are living with HIV infection in the US household population.
The upper limit of this estimate is similar to the CDC 2003
estimate of 1,039,000 to 1,185,000 persons in the United
States living with HIV/AIDS.18
HIV antibody prevalence in NHANES 1999 to 2002
was higher among persons with known risk behaviors and
among non-Hispanic blacks, which is consistent with other
CDC HIV antibody prevalence surveys.19 Data from the
CDC`s 1997 unlinked prevalence surveys in selected STD
clinics, drug treatment centers, and adolescent medicine
clinics19 had a black/white ratio that ranged from 1.5 among
men who have sex with men (MSM) and women attending
STD clinics to 4.3 among participants in the Young`s Men`s
Survey (MSM aged 15Y22 years who attended public venues
frequented by MSM in 7 cities during 1994Y1998).20
Among non-Hispanic blacks, a history of use of cocaine
or other street drugs had the strongest effect on infection. The
impact of drug use on HIV transmission through use of
contaminated needles or indirect transmission to sexual
partners or via maternal-child transmission has been well
documented and accounts for nearly half of the annual total
number of HIV cases in the United States.21 A 10-year
prospective study in Baltimore has demonstrated that risk
factors for HIV seroconversion differed by sex.22 For male
participants, needle sharing and male-to-male sex increased
HIV incidence, whereas for female participants, high-risk
sexual behavior was more significant than drug use beha-
vior.22 The only other significant variable in NHANES 1999
to 2002 was the presence of antibody to HSV-2, which was
associated with an increase in HIV seroprevalence in the total
and non-Hispanic black populations. HSV-2 infection has
been demonstrated to double the risk of HIV acquisition;23
thus, this association was not unexpected. There is evidence
that among those who are coinfected with HIV and HSV-2,
there is a significant biologic interaction between these 2
viruses, resulting in more efficient sexual transmission of HIV
and an increased HIV viral load during clinical and sub-
clinical HSV-2 reactivation.24,25 Because data from previous
NHANES demonstrated that 21% (95% CI: 19.1 to 23.1) of
the population had antibody to HSV-2 and that prevalence was
greater than 50% among non-Hispanic blacks aged 30 years or
older,12 a substantial percentage of the population has this
additional added risk associated with increased prevalence of
HIV infection.
Prescription drug use was obtained from all HIV-
positive persons during the household interview, and CD4 T-
lymphocyte counts were performed on all HIV-positive blood
samples. These data provide a cross-sectional estimate of
immune function among HIV-positive individuals in the
general population. Seven of the 12 individuals who did not
report current treatment had CD4 T-lymphocyte counts
G200 cells/mm3 compared with 2 of the 11 who reported
treatment, demonstrating that receiving ART treatment was
associated with better immune function in this population.
Among the newly informed individuals, only 1 individual
(12.5%) had a count G200 cells/mm3.
HIV antibody prevalence estimates in the 2 NHANES
conducted approximately 10 years apart assist in monitoring
the changing HIV epidemic in the United States, but because
of the low prevalence and the small number of HIV-positive
persons, these data need to be interpreted carefully. The
NHANES are designed to provide reliable estimates of
conditions by demographic groups based on a 10% pre-
valence with an RSE of G30%. The magnitudes of HIV
antibody prevalence in both NHANES do not meet these
standards, and the RSEs are greater than 30% for most
demographic groups. The NHANES are also limited by the
fact that many high-risk populations are not sampled, such as
prisoners and other institutionalized populations. In addition,
individuals who did not have a stable household would be less
likely to be sampled. Finally, the age range tested was only 18
to 49 years in the most recent survey; thus, estimates on
individuals outside this range were not provided.
Despite these limitations, a comparison across surveys
provides some insight into the HIV epidemic trends in the
United States. The concentration of the HIV epidemic in the
non-Hispanic black population seen in many CDC surveil-
lance programs4 was also observed in this household
population. On the positive side, individuals on antiretroviral
medication had improved immune function.
In January 2001, the CDC published an HIV prevention
strategic plan26 with an overarching goal of reducing by at
least 50% the number of new infections and of eliminating
racial and ethnic disparities. Emphasis was shifted from
focusing largely on prevention of transmission to those not
infected with HIV to preventing transmission from HIV-
positive persons.26 These strategies require that individuals
know their HIV status and that they have access to adequate
medical care and prevention counseling. At least 25% of the
NHANES HIV positive population did not know their test
results (8 individuals who called in for their results of the
32 positive participants), which is consistent with other

estimates.18 Increased testing in the general population, which
has been demonstrated to be justified on clinical and cost-
effective grounds, should help to reduce this gap in knowledge
and, hopefully, to reduce the disparities seen in this representa-
tive sample of the US population.27,28 Data from future
NHANES should continue to provide an estimate of the
prevalence of HIV infectioninthe general householdpopulation.
