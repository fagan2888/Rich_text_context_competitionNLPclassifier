Abstract: Background: While positive and negative affect are inversely linked, people may experience
and report both positive and negative emotions simultaneously. However, it is unknown if race alters
the magnitude of the association between positive and negative affect. The current study compared
Black and White Americans for the association between positive and negative affect. Methods:
We used data from MIDUS (Midlife in the United States), a national study of Americans with an age
range of 25 to 75. A total number of 7108 individuals were followed for 10 years from 1995 to 2004.
Positive and negative affect was measured at baseline (1995) and follow-up (2004). Demographic
(age and gender), socioeconomic (education and income) as well as health (self-rated health, chronic
medical conditions, and body mass index) factors measured at baseline were covariates. A series
of linear regressions were used to test the moderating effect of race on the reciprocal association
between positive and negative affect at baseline and over time, net of covariates. Results: In the
pooled sample, positive and negative affect showed inverse correlation at baseline and over time,
net of covariates. Blacks and Whites differed in the magnitude of the association between positive
and negative affect, with weaker inverse associations among Blacks compared to Whites, beyond all
covariates. Conclusion: Weaker reciprocal association between positive and negative affect in Blacks
compared to Whites has implications for cross-racial measurement of affect and mood, including
depression. Depression screening programs should be aware that race alters the concordance between
positive and negative affect domains and that Blacks endorse higher levels of positive affect compared
to Whites in the presence of high negative affect.

1. Introduction
In 1969, Norman Bradburn showed that positive and negative affect are two separate, but
inter-connected emotions with moderate negative associations [1,2]. Positive affect and emotions
include happiness, joy, contentment, interest and love [3­7]; negative affect and emotions include
sadness, guilt, fear, anger, and disgust [8­10]. While positive affect promotes health [11] and reduces
risk of mortality [12] via better psychological adjustment [13], negative affect increases risk of chronic
disease [14] as well as mortality [15] via vigilance, threat [16], and an unhealthy lifestyle [17].
Positive affect, a predictor of creation [18] and openness [19], is linked to lower autonomic
reactivity [20] and better physical and mental health [21]. Constant high levels of negative affect,
however, predisposes individuals to emotional and health problems [8­10]. The overall role of
negative affect as a common risk factor for a wide range of emotional and psychiatric disorders, such
Behav. Sci. 2017, 7, 48; doi:10.3390/bs7030048 www.mdpi.com/journal/behavsci
Behav. Sci. 2017, 7, 48 2 of 17
as anxiety and depression, is well established, and may partially explain why several disorders tend to
co-occur [22].
In addition to their physical health effects [23], positive and negative affect have major implications
for diagnosis of mood disorders, particularly depression [24]. Positive and negative emotions compose
major factors in mood disorders such as depression [25­27] and bipolar disorder [28]. As racial groups
differ in their tendency to experience or express positive and negative affect [29,30], there is a need for
cross-racial studies that compare racial groups for association between positive and negative affect [31­38].
Whether or not race alters simultaneous experience and presentation of positive and negative affect
is still unknown [29,30]. While some studies have suggested that the factorial structure of depression
scales is invariant across racial groups [39­41], other studies have shown that the degree by which
positive and negative affect correlate may depend on race and ethnicity [29,42,43]. While there is an
ongoing debate whether or not positive and negative affect similarly represent depression among Whites
and Blacks [38­41,44­50], there are studies showing higher reliability of negative affect despite lower
reliability of depression measures for Blacks compared to Whites [40,41,44]. Thus, positive and negative
affect domains may differently compose the presentation of depression for Blacks and Whites [39].
In a recent study by Moazen-Zadeh and Assari, the item loading for the item "I was happy"
to the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) measure was 0.68 and -0.66
respectively for Blacks and Whites [29]. In another study, by Assari et al., negative affect showed
stronger correlations with the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI)-based diagnosis of
clinical depression in Blacks compared to Whites, while positive affect was similarly linked to MDD
across race groups [45]. A national study found considerable variation in item loadings of the CES-D
scale between Blacks and Whites. While negative affect items showed a better loading for Blacks, the
positive affect items better loaded for Whites [5]. Canady et al. observed that the positive item "was
happy" had different loadings on a depression scale between Blacks and Whites [43]. All these studies
suggest that positive and negative affect may differently correlate between Blacks and Whites. These
findings may help us better understand why correlates of depression and affect vary for Whites and
Blacks [51­53], and why Blacks, who report higher levels of depressive symptoms (negative affect), do
not endorse DSM criteria for the clinical disorder [29,45,54].
While positive and negative affect are main factors in several depression scales [41,49,50,55],
different populations may differ in how they experience or express positive and negative affect
simultaneously [41,55]. Considering the gap in the literature on racial and ethnic variation in the
concordance between positive and negative affect endorsement [29,41­43,45­48], more research is
needed on moderating effects of race and ethnicity on the reciprocal links between positive and
negative affect [41,56,57].
We conducted the current study on racial differences in the bidirectional links between positive
and negative affect, using a national sample of adults in the United States.
2. Methods
2.1. Design
This longitudinal study used data from MIDUS (http://midus.wisc.edu), a 10 year longitudinal
study conducted between 1995 and 2004. The study was a national cohort study of over 7000 American
adults (aged 25 to 74). The study was carried out by the MacArthur Midlife Research Network.
The main purpose of the study was to understand the role of psychosocial factors in age related
variation in physical and mental health over the life course [58­62].
2.2. Data Collection
The survey used a multimodal data collection strategy, which was composed of a
computer-assisted personal interview (CAPI), a computer-assisted telephone interview (CATI), a
mail questionnaire, a telephone interview, and a face-to-face interview. First, the study employed an
Behav. Sci. 2017, 7, 48 3 of 17
initial 30-minute phone interview followed by a set (two) of self-administered questionnaires (SAQs).
SAQs were mailed to individuals who completed the phone interview [58­62].
2.3. Ethics
The study protocol was approved by the University of Michigan Institutional Review Board (IRB),
and written informed consent was obtained for all participants. The study was funded by the National
Institute on Aging (NIA). Monetary incentives were given at both Wave 1 and Wave 2 for compensation
(US $20 for completion of MIDUS 1 surveys and up to US $60 for completion of MIDUS 2 surveys).
2.4. Participants and Sampling
The study used random digit dialing (RDD), which is a method for selecting people for
involvement in telephone statistical surveys by generating telephone numbers at random in order
to enroll a random sample of adults. The national RDD survey used telephone numbers within
the continental United States as the sampling frame. The study used an oversampling in five cities
(related to geographic-specific agendas), resulting in a baseline RDD sample of 4244 individuals. The
sibling sample was then generated by a random selection of 529 cases from the RDD sample that had at
least one sibling. Limited to siblings within a family that had the same biological mother and father, the
study collected data from 950 siblings. The study also enrolled a twin sample, which used a two-part
sampling design. The first part involved screening a representative national sample of approximately
50,000 households for the presence of a twin (as part of ongoing national omnibus surveys). The second
part involved contacting the twin households and attempting to recruit twins (also aged 25­74) to
participate in the survey. Cooperating twins were asked to provide contact information for their
co-twin. The twin sample was ultimately composed of 957 twin pairs (n = 1914) [58­62]. As 1187
individuals were neither Whites nor Blacks, this study only included 5921 White and Black individuals.
Data collection of wave 1 was conducted in 1995 and 1996. The follow-up data collection was
conducted in 2004 and 2005. Advance letters with an accompanying brochure were sent to all Time-1
participants, to remind them about their past participation and to inform them that an interviewer
will contact them for the initial telephone survey in near future. After a phone interview, which lasted
30 min on average, participants received two SAQs via mail [58­62].
2.5. Follow-Up Data
From the total 7108 participants who were enrolled at baseline (completing the phone survey at
MIDUS 1), data were gathered for 4963 (70%) at MIDUS 2 9­10 years later. Overall retention rate was
75% in the MIDUS (adjusted for mortality). Major causes for non-participation at MIDUS 2 included
refusal (12%), could not be contacted (10%), too ill to be interviewed (8%), or deceased [58­62].
2.6. Measures
Predictor variables were those prominent in published research on survey participation and
retention, including 7 core demographic variables and 10 physical health variables from either the
baseline telephone interview or the SAQ.
2.7. Demographic Characteristics
Demographic variables were collected at baseline in 1995 and included age (continuous), gender
(0 = male (reference group), 1 = female), and race (0 = Whites (reference group), 1 = Blacks).
Socioeconomic status. Socio-economic variables included educational level (1 = less than high
school, 2 = high school graduate or equivalent, 3 = some college, 4 = college graduate or more) and
personal income. Both variables were operationalized as continuous measures.
Physical Health. The following physical health variables were included in the study: self-rated
health (SRH) (1 = worst, 10 = best), number of chronic medical conditions (CMC), and body mass
Behav. Sci. 2017, 7, 48 4 of 17
index (BMI). All measures were treated as continuous measures. While a higher score indicated better
SRH, higher scores for CMC and BMI reflected worse health.
Positive affect. Using a scale developed by Mroczek and Kolarz (1998), [63] positive affect was
assessed using six items referring to the question: "During the past 30 days, how much of the time did
you feel . . . " Items included "cheerful", "in good spirits", "extremely happy", "calm and peaceful",
"satisfied", and "full of life". Responses ranged from 1 (all of the time) to 5 (none of the time) for
each item [63]. Mean positive affect scores were computed if at least one of the affect items were
completed. Greater scores reflected more positive affect, with possible scores ranging from 1 to 5.
Internal consistency (reliability) was very good ( = 0.91 for all, 0.91 for Whites, 0.92 for Blacks). Other
studies have used this scale [64­66].
Negative affect. Using a scale developed by Mroczek and Kolarz (1998), [63] negative affect was
assessed in response to six items referring to the question: "During the past 30 days, how much of
the time did you feel . . . " Negative affect items included "so sad", "nervous", "restless or fidgety",
"hopeless", "worthless", and "everything was an effort". Responses ranged from 1 (all of the time) to 5
(none of the time) [63]. Mean negative affect scores were computed if at least one of the affect items
were completed. Greater scores reflected more negative affect, with possible scores ranging from 1 to 5.
Internal consistency (reliability) was excellent ( = 0.86 for all, 0.86 for Whites, 0.87 for Blacks). Other
studies have used this scale [64­66].
2.8. Statistical Note
We used SPSS 20.0 for Windows (IBM Inc. Armonk, NY, USA) for data analysis. For univariate
analysis we reported frequencies, percentages, and mean (standard deviations) in the pooled sample,
as well as based on race. For bivariate associations, we used independent sample t test, chi square test,
as well as Pearson correlation test. For multivariable analysis, we ran a series of linear regressions in the
pooled sample, with positive and negative affect as independent and dependent variables, respectively.
In our first models, only demographics and socio-economics were controlled for. Subsequently, we
controlled for health factors. First, we ran models without the interaction term. Then, we added the
race by affect interaction term. We ran models with wave 1 and wave 2 positive and negative affect
as outcomes. In the next step, we ran models stratified based on race. Unstandardized regression
coefficient (b), standard error (SE), 95% Confidence Intervals (CI), and p values were reported.
3. Results
Table 1 presents the results of descriptive analysis in the pooled sample and also based on race.
Compared to Whites, Blacks were younger, more frequently women, and had lower education and
income. Blacks had worse CMC, SRH and BMI compared to Whites. Blacks also had higher positive
affect at baseline compared to Whites. Blacks and Whites were similar in negative affect at baseline.
Table 2 presents the correlation matrix of the study variables in Whites and Blacks. While positive
affect in wave 1 and 2 were correlated in both racial groups, the magnitude of the correlation between
positive and negative affect were stronger for Whites than Blacks. Age was correlated with wave
1 positive and negative affect in Whites but not Blacks. Education and income also showed better
correlations with wave 1 and wave 2 positive and negative affect in Whites than Blacks.
Table 3a summarizes the results of four linear regression models to test the effects of negative
affect in wave 1 on positive affect in wave 1. Model 1-a only included demographic and socioeconomic
factors without any interaction term. Model 2-a included demographic and socioeconomic factors,
however also added the race by negative affect in wave 1 interaction term. Model 3-a included health
factors as controls with no interaction term. Model 4-a included health factors as controls, with race by
negative affect in wave 1 interaction term. According to our models, baseline negative affect showed
strong inverse correlation with wave 1 positive affect, net of socioeconomic (Model 1-a) and health
status (Model 3-a). Significant difference was found between Blacks and Whites for the association
between positive and negative affect such that the inverse association was weaker for Blacks compared

Table 3b provides a summary of four linear regression models with wave 1 positive affect as
the independent variable and wave 1 negative affect as the dependent variable. Baseline positive
affect showed strong inverse correlation with wave 1 negative affect, net of socioeconomic (Model
1-b) and health status (Model 3-b). Significant difference was found between Blacks and Whites for
the association between positive and negative affect such that the inverse association was weaker for
Blacks compared to Whites in the presence of demographic and socioeconomic (Model 2-b) as well as
health status (Model 4-b) (Table 3b).
Table 4a presents the results of four linear regression models with wave 1 negative affect as the
predictor and wave 2 positive affect as the outcome. According to our models, baseline negative affect
showed strong inverse correlation with wave 1 positive affect, net of demographic and socioeconomic
(Model 1-a) as well as health status (Model 3-a). Significant difference was found between Blacks and
Whites for the association between positive and negative affect such that the inverse association was
weaker for Blacks compared to Whites net of demographic and socioeconomic (Model 2-a) as well as
health status (Model 4-a) (Table 4a).
Table 4b shows the results of four linear regression models with wave 2 negative affect as the
outcome. According to our models, baseline positive affect showed inverse correlation with wave
2 negative affect, net of demographic and socioeconomic (Model 1-b) and health status (Model 3-b).
Significant difference was found between Blacks and Whites for the association between positive and
negative affect such that the inverse association was weaker for Blacks compared to Whites net of
demographic and socioeconomic (Model 2-b) as well as health status (Model 4-b) (Table 4b).
Table 5 summarizes predictors of wave 1 (Table 5a) positive and (Table 5a) negative affect in
Whites and Blacks. Based on this table, net of demographic and socioeconomic as well as health status,
positive affect showed inverse correlation with negative affect among Whites and Blacks. Regression
coefficients were larger for Whites than Blacks.
Table 6 presents predictors of wave 2 positive (Table 6a) and negative (Table 6b) affect in Whites
and Blacks. Based on this table, net of demographic and socioeconomic as well as health status, wave 1
positive affect showed inverse correlation with wave 2 negative affect among Whites but not Blacks.
Wave 1 negative affect also showed inverse correlation with wave 2 positive affect among Whites but
not Blacks.

4. Discussion
In our study, Black and White Americans differed in the magnitude of the inverse correlation
between positive and negative affect at baseline and over time. According to our study, the negative
association between positive and negative affect was weaker for Black compared to White Americans.
These differential correlations remained significant at baseline and over time, net of demographic,
socioeconomic, and health status.
Our finding of a stronger link between positive and negative affect among White compared to
Black Americans is consistent with previous findings showing weaker negative association between
depressive symptoms and hopefulness among Whites than Blacks [67]. In the presence of similar
depressive symptoms, Blacks maintain higher levels of hope than Whites, [67] and Blacks who endorse
high negative affect maintain high positive affect as well. Black-White differences also exist in the
magnitude of correlation between depression and evaluation of self [68]. Negative affect and depressive
symptoms differently negative feelings and cognitions about self in Whites and Blacks [68]. The weaker
effects of depression and depressive symptoms on physical health outcomes, such as incident chronic
disease [69] and all-cause [70] and disease specific chronic disease [71], in Whites than Blacks are
also known. In one study, depressive symptoms predicted future clinical depression in Whites
but not Blacks [30], and in another study, race altered how depressive symptoms map on clinical
depression [46].
Canady et al. found the item "I was happy" as the only item with different loadings between
Blacks and Whites after applying the cross-group constraints [43]. In a recent study, Assari and
Moazen-Zadeh found differences for several positive affect items, including the item "I was happy,"
on a depression scale for Blacks and Whites. The study showed worse item loadings for positive items,
namely "as good" and "hopeful," in Blacks than Whites. In the final model with a very good fit to the
data, the item "as good" showed poor loading for Whites and Blacks, however, the item "hopeful"
showed good loading for Whites but poor loading for Blacks [42].
A recent body of evidence has shown major racial differences in socioeconomic and health
correlates of negative emotions [51­53]. Negative emotions better predict medical conditions, obesity,
and mortality in Whites than Blacks [52,53]. Based on Black-White health paradox, defined as
less frequent depression despite a higher prevalence of chronic medical conditions among Blacks
compared to Whites [54,72­82], adversities and negative emotions are more common among Blacks [69].
Our findings may explain why emotional disorders are not as common as expected in Blacks.
According to the "undoing hypothesis," positive emotions are able to undo the harmful effects
of negative emotions [5,7]. Maintaining higher levels of positive affect in the presence of negative
affect in Blacks compared to Whites may explain the weaker effects of negative emotions on physical
health of Blacks. In this view, positive affect operates as a buffer against harms associated with
negative affect [7,20]. This phenomenon can explain why depressive symptoms predict incident
chronic disease [69] and mortality [52,53] for Whites but not Blacks. Inflammation also better correlates
with depression for Blacks than Whites [81,82]. This finding can also explain why depressive symptoms
predict subsequent MDD among Whites but not Blacks [29]. This phenomenon may also explain
why Blacks report better well-being (positive affect) than Whites, despite higher levels of stress,
psychological distress, and depressive symptoms [83].
Our findings are in support of the literature that suggests positive and negative affect are
separate but interconnected components of depression measurement, among both Blacks and
Whites [25­27,44,84]. While this study investigated positive and negative emotions, there is a need to
explore racial differences in correlations between emotions and other domains of depression such as
somatic complaints and interpersonal problems [85­88]. Future research may also test if resources and
assets such as self-esteem, social support, religion, or culture explain Black-White variation in the link
between positive and negative affect.
Our findings on Black-White differences in the link between positive and negative affect have
major implications for measurement of depression and depressive symptoms in ethnically diverse
Behav. Sci. 2017, 7, 48 12 of 17
populations. Clinicians and researchers who work with racially diverse populations should be aware
of race-specific links between positive and negative emotions. Compared to their White counterparts,
Blacks with depression may endorse higher levels of positive affect, which may reduce chance of
diagnosis of depression. We argue that positive and negative items of depression should not be simply
summed among diverse populations. Instead, positive and negative domains should be considered
as inter-connected but separate domains across racial groups. Domain-specific evaluation of mood
may be a better option than calculating a sum score of positive and negative items. Considering such
cross-ethnic variations may help with more accurate diagnosis and treatment of depression among
ethnically diverse populations [85,89].
Our findings also have implications for epidemiological studies of depression across various racial
groups. The differential link between positive and negative affect based on race causes measurement
bias for cross-racial measurement of mood outcomes, including but not limited to depression. Programs
that screen ethnically diverse samples for depression or depressive symptomatology should be aware
of how race alters the concordance of positive and negative affect. There is still a need for further
research on equivalence of depression, affect, and mood measurement among diverse racial and ethnic
groups [51,90,91]. Future research should focus on cross-racial validation of measures of depression.
Our study is subject to at least three limitations. The major limitation of this study was not
measuring culture [92,93]. Second, we did not include clinical diagnosis of MDD according to the
DSM criteria (composite international diagnostic interview criteria were used). Third, we did not
consider race by gender differences in this study. Despite how the race by gender intersection may
shape experience and expression of positive and negative emotions [94], limited sample size of Blacks
did not allow us to break our sample of Blacks to additional sub-groups. Despite this limitation, a
unique strength of our study was using nationally representative data of American adults that resulted
in nationally generalizable findings to the U.S. population.
In conclusion, our findings suggest that positive and negative affect have a weaker negative
association in Blacks than Whites, suggesting that in the presence of similar negative affect, Blacks
maintain higher levels of positive affect than Whites. These findings have health implications given the
protective effect of positive affect (the "undoing hypothesis"). It is unknown whether racial differences
in the magnitude of the correlation between positive and negative affect explains previously observed
Black-White differences in psychosocial and medical correlates of depression. In addition, these
findings are also important for measurement of depression. This finding calls into question the
measurement equivalence of affect, mood, and depression outcomes among Blacks and Whites.
5. Conclusions
In summary, positive and negative affect are more concurrent in Blacks compared to Whites. This
finding has implications for cross-racial measurement of affect and mood, including depression.
This information may have implications for diagnosis and screening of depression in racially
diverse populations.
