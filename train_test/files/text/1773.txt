Background--Although the role of inflammation in the pathophysiology of peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is well
established, the contribution of insulin resistance (IR) to PAD is less clear. We hypothesized that IR is associated with
PAD and that the presence of IR would influence the association between C-reactive protein (CRP) and PAD, an
association established predominantly in healthy individuals.
Methods and Results--We analyzed data from 3242 adults in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES) 1999 to 2004 who underwent measurement of ankle brachial index, CRP, and fasting glucose and insulin,
enabling calculation of homeostasis model of IR (HOMA-IR). Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs were estimated by
logistic regression. The mean prevalence of PAD (defined as an ankle brachial index 0.9) was 5.5% (SE, 0.47%).
HOMA-IR was independently associated with PAD (OR, 2.06; 95% CI, 1.1 to 4.0; P0.03 for quartile 4, P for trend
across quartiles0.047) after adjustment for age, gender, race/ethnicity, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, smoking, body
mass index, chronic kidney disease, and CRP. Elevated CRP (3 mg/L) also was strongly associated with PAD (OR,
2.2; 95% CI, 1.3 to 3.6; P0.003 versus CRP 1 mg/L). Stratifying subjects on the basis of median HOMA-IR, we
found that CRP 3 mg/L was no longer significantly associated with PAD in subjects with IR (OR, 1.3; 95% CI, 0.8
to 2.1; P0.3, P for interaction0.08).
Conclusions--These findings demonstrate that IR is strongly and independently associated with PAD. Furthermore, IR
modifies the association of inflammation with PAD. These data establish a role of IR in PAD and highlight the relative
importance of inflammation in patients with and without IR. (Circulation. 2008;118:33-41.)
Key Words: inflammation  insulin resistance  peripheral vascular disease
Both insulin resistance and inflammation have been im-
plicated in the development of atherosclerosis. The
contribution of inflammation to atherogenesis has been dem-
onstrated in both cellular and molecular investigations and
confirmed in epidemiological studies demonstrating an asso-
ciation of C-reactive protein (CRP; an inflammatory marker)
with increased cardiovascular risk.1­3 Similarly, insulin resis-
tance, increasingly appreciated as an important component of
atherogenesis, is associated with clinical atherosclerosis in
epidemiological studies and predicts future cardiovascular
events.4­8
Clinical Perspective p 41
Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is an important manifes-
tation of systemic atherosclerosis affecting an estimated 10
million Americans9 and is associated with significant limb
morbidity and cardiovascular mortality.10 The role of insulin
resistance in PAD is not well established, although several
lines of evidence support a linkage. Insulin resistance con-
tributes significantly to the development of diabetes mellitus,
a known risk factor for PAD,10 and studies have shown that
incident PAD may be associated with the metabolic syn-
drome11,12 and glucose intolerance,13 both manifestations of
insulin resistance. No prior study has evaluated the relation-
ship between PAD and a direct measurement of insulin
resistance. The homeostasis model of insulin resistance
(HOMA-IR) is a simple measure of insulin resistance derived
from fasting glucose and insulin values that correlates well
with insulin sensitivity derived from the glucose clamp
technique, the gold standard measure of insulin sensitivity.14
HOMA-IR has been shown to correlate with cardiovascular
disease6­8 and cerebrovascular disease,15­18 but the relation-
ship between HOMA-IR and PAD has not previously been
established.
In contrast to the limited data on insulin resistance and
PAD, several studies have shown that inflammatory markers,

the initial development of PAD,21,22 and portend adverse
outcomes in patients with established PAD.23,24 However, the
importance of CRP as a predictor of PAD and cardiovascular
disease has been established predominantly in healthy indi-
viduals.1,21 In subjects with diabetes or other established
cardiovascular risk factors, the association between CRP and
vascular disease is less clear. Indeed, conflicting data exist,
with several studies demonstrating a significant attenuation of
the association between CRP and myocardial infarction or
stroke in subjects with diabetes,25,26 although the data are not
uniform.27 With these inconsistent findings and the accumu-
lating evidence supporting the close interrelationship of
inflammation and insulin resistance,28­30 we hypothesized
that the presence of insulin resistance might modify the
association between CRP and PAD. Accordingly, we used the
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES) from 1999 to 2004 to evaluate the association
between HOMA-IR, a direct measure of insulin resistance,
and PAD and to determine the influence of insulin resistance
on the association of inflammation and PAD.
Methods
The NHANES is a series of surveys of the noninstitutionalized
civilian population in the United States. Sampling is performed in a
complex, stratified, multistage manner to provide nationally repre-
sentative data in an effort to assess the health and nutritional status
of adults and children in the United States. The 1999 to 2004
NHANES was reviewed and approved by the National Center for
Health Statistics Institutional Review Board. Informed consent was
obtained from all subjects.
Ankle Brachial Index Measurements
Beginning in 1999, adults 40 years of age were asked to participate
in a lower-extremity examination, including the ankle brachial index
(ABI), a diagnostic test for PAD with excellent performance char-
acteristics (79% to 95% sensitivity and 95% to 100% specificity).10
Systolic pressure was measured in the supine position in the right
arm (brachial artery) and in the posterior tibial artery of both ankles
with an 8-MHz Doppler probe. Blood pressures were measured twice
at each site in participants 40 to 59 years of age and only once for
participants 60 years of age. The ABI was calculated by dividing
the systolic blood pressure in the ankle by the systolic blood pressure
in the arm. We assigned a diagnosis of PAD if either leg had an ABI
0.90. Patients with ABI values 1.40 were excluded because these
values may be falsely elevated as a result of severe vascular
calcification.
Laboratory Methods
Standard automated biochemical analysis was used to determine
nonfasting serum glucose (Beckman Synchron LX20, Beckman
Coulter, Fullerton, Calif), and fasting glucose was measured with the
enzyme hexokinase method. Fasting insulin was determined with the
2-site immunoenzymometric assay (Tosoh AIA-PACK IRI, Tosoh
Bioscience Inc, Grove City, Ohio) in 2003 to 2004. For earlier years
(1999 to 2002), the Pharmacia insulin radioimmunoassay kit was
used for insulin measurement (Pharmacia Diagnostics AB, Uppsala,
Sweden). Because these methods yield slightly different measure-
ments, insulin values were converted as recommended in the analytic
guidelines.31 High-sensitivity CRP was measured by latex-enhanced
nephelometry. Serum creatinine and nonfasting cholesterol values
were determined by automated biochemical profiling (Beckman
Synchron LX20). Because of a change in assay, serum creatinine
values from the 1999 and 2000 examinations were corrected as
suggested in the laboratory documentation files. Fasting lipids were
analyzed with the Hitachi 704 Analyzer (Roche Diagnostics, Basel,
Switzerland). HOMA-IR was calculated as follows: {[fasting glu-
cose (mmol/L)][fasting insulin (U/mL)]}/22.5.32
Covariates
Race/ethnicity, gender, and age were assessed by self-report. Race/
ethnicity was categorized as non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic
black, Mexican American, or other. Subjects were considered to
have hypertension if they reported a physician diagnosis of hyper-
tension, if they reported taking prescription medications for hyper-
tension, or if systolic blood pressure was 140 mm Hg and/or
diastolic blood pressure was 90 mm Hg. These blood pressures
were taken separately from the ABI examination and measured with
a mercury sphygmomanometer. A diagnosis of hypercholesterolemia
was assigned if the subject reported a physician diagnosis of
hypercholesterolemia or reported taking prescription medications for
hypercholesterolemia or if the total cholesterol level was
6.21 mmol/L (240 mg/dL). Subjects were considered to have
diabetes mellitus if the subject reported a physician diagnosis of
diabetes, if the subject reported taking prescription medications
for diabetes (either insulin or oral agents), if nonfasting plasma
glucose was 11.1 mmol/L (200 mg/dL), or if fasting plasma
glucose was 7 mmol/L (126 mg/dL). Active smokers were deter-
mined from self-report (a positive answer to the question, "Do you
now smoke cigarettes?"). Those who did not meet these criteria were
considered former smokers if they answered yes to the question,
"Have you smoked at least 100 cigarettes in your life?" and never
smokers if they had never smoked in their lifetime. Body mass index
(BMI) was calculated as weight (kg) divided by height (m2)
(n3198). We used the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease
Study equation to estimate glomerular filtration rate (GFR) from
serum creatinine (SCr): GFR (mL · min1 · 1.73 m2)175
(SCr)1.154(age)0.203(0.742 if female)(1.210 if black).33 Sub-
jects with an estimated GFR 60 mL · min1 · 1.73 m2 were
classified as having chronic kidney disease. Diagnosis of congestive
heart failure, angina, heart attack, and stroke was made by self-
report. Any cardiovascular disease was defined as prevalent myo-
cardial infarction, heart failure, or stroke on the basis of a subject's
affirmative response to the question, "Has a doctor or other health
professional ever told you that you have had a [heart attack/
congestive heart failure/stroke]?" Subjects were categorized as
having the metabolic syndrome on the basis of the National Choles-
terol Education Program criteria if they had 3 of the 5 following
criteria: high-density lipoprotein 1.04 mmol/L (40 mg/dL) (men)
and 1.3 mmol/L (50 mg/dL) (women), waist circumference 102
cm (men) or 88 cm (women), triglycerides 1.7 mmol/L (150
mg/dL), fasting glucose 5.6 mmol/L (100 mg/dL), and elevated
blood pressure (systolic 130 mm Hg or diastolic 8 mm Hg).
Derivation of Sample Population
Our analysis combined data from the NHANES 1999 to 2004
examinations. ABI measurements were available for 7571 subjects in
NHANES 1999 to 2004, of which 113 were excluded on the basis of
ABI 1.40. One half of these participants, a representative sub-
sample of the US population, were asked to attend a morning session
during which fasting blood work was collected. Only individuals
who had fasted at least 8 to 24 hours were assigned a nonzero
fasting weight and thus were included in our sample population.31
This left 3499 with glucose and insulin values enabling calcula-
tion of HOMA-IR. We excluded subjects who were taking insulin
(n80) given the limitations of HOMA-IR measurements in this
subpopulation.34 After the exclusion of subjects who did not have
complete information available on other covariates of interest, the
remaining 3242 subjects constituted the sample population for
this analysis.
Statistical Methods
NHANES uses a complex, multistage, probability sampling design
to select participants representative of the civilian, noninstitutional-

ized US population. Given that our analysis was limited to the
representative subsample of individuals with fasting blood work, we
used the fasting sample weights to account for the sampling design.
Subjects were included in our analysis only if they had fasted a
minimum of 8 hours and had been assigned a nonzero fasting weight.
We generated a combined 6-year fasting weight variable by assign-
ing two thirds of the 4-year weight for 1999 to 2002 if the subject
participated during 1999 to 2002 or assigning one third of the 2-year
weight for 2003 to 2004 if the subject participated during 2003 to
2004.
Analyses were performed with SAS version 9.1 (SAS Institute,
Inc, Cary, NC) callable SUDAAN version 9.01 (Research Triangle
Institute, Research Triangle Park, NC) to account for the complex
sample design. Age- and gender-adjusted baseline subject character-
istics are reported as the weighted mean and SE or the weighted
percentile and SE. Categorical variables were compared by use of the
2 test or logistic regression. Comparisons of mean values across
groups and correlations between continuous variables were achieved
by linear regression. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs were estimated
by logistic regression. We divided HOMA-IR values into quartiles
and examined the presence of a linear trend across quartiles. We
further evaluated the odds of PAD in each quartile compared with the
reference group, HOMA-IR quartile 1. In a multivariable model, we
then adjusted for age, gender, race/ethnicity, hypertension, hyperlip-
idemia, smoking, BMI, chronic kidney disease, and CRP. A value of
P0.05 was considered statistically significant except for interaction
terms, for which a value of P0.10 was considered statistically
significance.
To assess whether the presence of insulin resistance influenced
the relationship between CRP and PAD, we stratified the popu-
lation by median HOMA-IR level to indicate the presence or
absence of insulin resistance and reevaluated the relationship
between CRP and PAD in these 2 categories. Given the lack of
established threshold values of HOMA-IR to indicate insulin
resistance, we used the median HOMA-IR level as a threshold
value in our analysis. A formal test for interaction also was
performed to evaluate the impact of insulin resistance on the
association between CRP and PAD.

the integrity of the data. All authors have read and agree to the
manuscript as written.
Results
Of the 3242 subjects in our sample population, 256 partici-
pants had an ABI 0.90, for an overall unadjusted weighted
prevalence (mean) of PAD of 5.5% (SE, 0.47%). Age- and
gender-adjusted baseline characteristics of participants with
and without PAD are summarized in Table 1. Subjects with
PAD had a significantly higher mean age (66.4 years [SE, 1.1
years] versus 55.5 years [SE, 0.3 years]; P0.0001) and a
higher prevalence of hypertension, coronary heart disease,
and chronic kidney disease. An elevated CRP (3 mg/L) was
noted in a significantly higher proportion of PAD subjects
(54.6% [SE, 5.0%] versus 40.3% [SE, 1.0%]), and mean CRP
levels were significantly higher in PAD subjects (7.5 mg/dL
[SE, 1.3 mg/dL] versus 4.4 mg/dL [0.2 mg/dL]; P0.02).
There were no significant differences in gender distribution
or BMI.
Association of HOMA-IR and PAD
Age- and gender-adjusted baseline characteristics of sub-
jects in each HOMA-IR quartile are shown in Table 2.
Subjects in the higher HOMA-IR quartiles were less likely
to be female or of non-Hispanic white race. Cardiovascular
risk factors, including hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and
diabetes, were significantly more prevalent in increasing
HOMA-IR quartiles. A history of smoking (current or
former) and the presence of chronic kidney disease were
not different in the groups. HOMA-IR correlated signifi-
cantly with several baseline variables, including BMI
(r0.45, P0.0001), high-density lipoprotein (r0.32,
P0.0001), triglycerides (r0.22, P0.0001), and CRP
(r0.12, P0.0002). There was no correlation between
HOMA-IR and LDL (r0.03, P0.05) or total cholesterol
(r0.01, PNS).
Age- and gender-adjusted PAD prevalence estimates
increased in a graded fashion in increasing HOMA-IR
quartiles: 5.0% (SE, 0.8%) in quartile 1, 5.4% (SE, 0.9%)
in quartile 2, 6.1% (SE, 0.7%) in quartile 3, and 7.8% (SE,
1.1%) in quartile 4 (P0.037, 2 test) (Figure 1). Com-
pared with subjects in the lowest HOMA-IR quartile,
subjects in increasing quartiles had a graded increase in
odds of PAD: OR1.24 (95% CI, 0.8 to 2.0) for quartile 2,
OR1.53 (95% CI, 0.96 to 2.4) for quartile 3, and

OR1.88 (95% CI, 1.2 to 3.0) for quartile 4 (P for
trend0.009) (Table 3, unadjusted).
In a multivariable model adjusting for age, gender, and
race/ethnicity (Table 3, model 1), HOMA-IR remained
associated with PAD with increasing odds of PAD across
HOMA-IR quartiles: OR1.19 (95% CI, 0.8 to 1.9) for
quartile 2, OR1.4 (95% CI, 0.9 to 2.3) for quartile 3, and
OR1.83 (95% CI, 1.2 to 2.9) for quartile 4 compared
with subjects in HOMA-IR quartile 1 (P for trend0.015).
In further analyses also adjusting for traditional atheroscle-
rotic risk factors (hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and smok-
ing) and BMI (Table 3, model 2), the linear association
between HOMA-IR quartiles and PAD persisted (P for
trend0.039), and quartile 4 had a 2-fold-increased odds
of PAD (OR, 2.07; 95% CI, 1.1 to 3.9) compared with
quartile 1. Finally, the magnitude and direction of the
association between HOMA-IR and PAD persisted after
additional adjustment for nontraditional factors related to
PAD, including chronic kidney disease and CRP (P for
trend0.047), and subjects in quartile 4 had an OR of 2.06
(95% CI, 1.1 to 4.0) compared with those in quartile 1
(Table 3, model 3). Additional adjustment for diabetes
resulted in a marginal attenuation of the association of
insulin resistance with PAD (P for trend0.058), although
subjects in the highest HOMA-IR quartile continued to
have an 2-fold increase in the odds of PAD (OR, 1.96;
95% CI, 1.03 to 3.8). After adjustment for hemoglobin A1c
as a measure of recent glycemic control instead of diabe-
tes, the relationship remained statistically significant (P
for trend0.047) (Table 3).
These findings were unchanged when HOMA-IR was
used as a continuous variable (after log transformation to
improve normality). Using a multivariable model account-
ing for age, gender, race/ethnicity, hypertension, hyperlip-
idemia, smoking, BMI, chronic kidney disease, and CRP,
we found that a 1-unit increase in log-HOMA conferred a
33% increased odds of PAD (OR, 1.33; 95% CI, 1.03 to
1.70; P0.029). This relationship persisted even after
additional adjustment for diabetes (OR, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.0
to 1.67; P0.047) or hemoglobin A1c
(OR, 1.36; 95% CI,
1.02 to 1.8; P0.036).
Given the recognized relationship between insulin resis-
tance and diabetes, a well-established risk factor for PAD,
we repeated our analyses excluding subjects with diabetes
to evaluate the association of HOMA-IR with PAD inde-
pendently of the effect of diabetes. We excluded all
subjects with diabetes (n485, including those with self-
report of diabetes, those taking insulin or oral agents, and
subjects with a fasting blood glucose level 126 mg/dL or
nonfasting level 200 mg/dL), leaving 2757 subjects

tion, there remained a graded increase in PAD prevalence
across increasing HOMA-IR quartiles, with prevalence
estimates of 3.8% (SE, 0.69%), 4.7% (SE, 0.94%), 5.7%
(SE, 0.79%), and 6.1% (SE, 1.38%) across the 4 quartiles,
respectively (P0.24, 2 text). In univariate logistic re-
gression analysis, a 1-quartile increase in HOMA-IR was
associated with an 18% increased odds of PAD (OR, 1.18;
95% CI, 0.98 to 1.42). Additionally, compared with
subjects in the lowest HOMA-IR quartile (in an unadjusted
model), subjects in increasing quartiles maintained a
graded increase in odds of PAD: OR1.24 (95% CI, 0.8 to
1.97) for quartile 2, OR1.52 (95% CI, 0.92 to 2.5) for
quartile 3, and OR1.62 (95% CI, 0.9 to 2.90) for quartile
4. As expected, exclusion of nearly 500 individuals from
our sample population attenuated the associations between
HOMA-IR and PAD; nonetheless, a graded increase in
PAD prevalence and graded increases in the odds of PAD

To evaluate the relationship between CRP and PAD, CRP
was first categorized as low (1 mg/L), intermediate (1 to 3
mg/L), or high (3 mg/L) according to published American
Heart Association/Centers for Disease Control guidelines.35
There was a significant graded increase in PAD prevalence
according to CRP category, with prevalence rates of 3.3%
(SE, 0.7%), 5.5% (SE, 0.8%), and 6.8% (SE, 0.8%) for CRP
levels of 1, 1 to 3, and 3 mg/L, respectively (P0.003, 2
test). Compared with subjects with a low CRP (1 mg/L),
subjects with a high CRP (3 mg/L) had a significantly
increased odds of PAD with an OR of 2.2 (95% CI, 1.3 to 3.6;
P0.003). Adjusting for age, gender, race/ethnicity, hyper-
tension, hyperlipidemia, smoking status, and chronic kidney
disease, we found a significant association between CRP and
PAD (OR, 1.02; 95% CI, 1.0 to 1.03; P0.014 for a 1-mg/L
change).
Influence of Insulin Resistance on the Association
of CRP and PAD
Given previous conflicting data suggesting that the associa-
tion of inflammation with atherosclerosis may be altered in
states of insulin resistance,25,26 we examined whether the
association of CRP with PAD is modified by the presence of
insulin resistance. We analyzed the association of CRP with
PAD in analyses stratified by median HOMA-IR level (1.86).
Among subjects without insulin resistance, there was a
graded increase in PAD prevalence among increasing CRP
categories, with prevalence estimates of 2.2% (SE, 1.0%),
4.4% (SE, 0.9%), and 6.7% (SE, 1.1%) for CRP levels of 1,
1 to 3, and 3 mg/L, respectively (P0.007, 2 test) (Figure
2). Expressed as an OR, CRP 3 mg/L significantly in-
creased the likelihood of PAD compared with a CRP 1
mg/L (OR, 3.2; 95% CI, 1.2 to 8.4; P0.02) in subjects
without insulin resistance. However, the association was
markedly blunted in subjects with insulin resistance. Subjects
with insulin resistance but low CRP (1 mg/L) had a notably
higher prevalence of PAD compared with subjects with low
CRP without insulin resistance (5.5% [SE, 0.8%] versus 2.2%
[SE, 1.0%]; P0.019). In the insulin-resistant group, PAD
prevalence rates increased slightly but not significantly, from
5.5% (SE, 0.8%) to 6.5% (SE, 1.1%) and 6.9% (SE, 1.0%) in
increasing CRP categories (P0.56, 2 test) (Figure 2). CRP
was no longer significantly associated with PAD in subjects

We further confirmed that the association of CRP and PAD
was significantly different in insulin-sensitive and insulin-re-
sistant subjects (P for interaction term0.08).
Discussion
We examined the interrelationships between inflammation,
insulin resistance, and PAD in this nationally representative
sample population and found that insulin resistance, indicated
by HOMA-IR, is strongly associated with PAD and that the
presence of insulin resistance attenuates the association be-
tween CRP and PAD. Furthermore, this is the first study to
illustrate the association of PAD and a direct measure of
insulin resistance, HOMA-IR, a simple method that uses
plasma insulin and glucose in a single fasting blood sample.
HOMA-IR has previously been reported only in relation to
cardiovascular6­8 and cerebrovascular disease.15­18 Indeed,
we found a roughly 25% increased odds of PAD for each
1-quartile increase in HOMA-IR, a finding that remained
consistent despite adjustment for typical atherosclerotic risk
factors, factors related to insulin resistance (ie, BMI), and
glycemic control (hemoglobin A1c
). In addition, although the
trend across quartiles was marginally no longer statistically
significant after adjustment for diabetes, the point estimates
were essentially unchanged, and subjects in the highest
HOMA-IR quartile continued to have a nearly 2-fold
increased odds of PAD. Using HOMA-IR as a continuous
variable, we found a strong relationship between PAD and
insulin resistance that persisted even after additional ad-
justment for diabetes or hemoglobin A1c
. These data
suggest that insulin resistance may have an association
with PAD along the entire spectrum of insulin resistance
and distinct from the impact of diabetes. Even after the
exclusion of subjects with diabetes, there were graded
increases in PAD prevalence with increasing HOMA-IR
quartiles, although the associations between HOMA-IR
and PAD were no longer statistically significant. Our data
support prior observations that PAD is associated with the
metabolic syndrome11,12,36 and glucose intolerance,13 both
surrogate markers of insulin resistance.
In contrast to the limited data on the association of insulin
resistance and PAD, the link between inflammation and PAD
has been well established. Our demonstration of a strong
association between CRP and PAD is consistent with prior
epidemiological data and prospective studies linking inflam-
mation with atherosclerosis in the coronary and peripheral
arterial beds.1­3,19­23,37 However, much of the information on
inflammation and atherosclerosis has been generated in
healthy individuals. Less clear is whether this relationship
persists in individuals with established cardiovascular risk
factors such as diabetes. Sakkinen et al26 studied the relation-
ship between CRP and myocardial infarction over a 20-year
period, and although they found a positive relationship
between CRP and myocardial infarction in the overall popu-
lation, the association was abolished in individuals with
diabetes. The same group also showed no significant rela-
tionship between CRP and stroke among patients with dia-
betes or hypertension.25 Prospective data from the Strong
Heart Study in an American Indian population found no
predictive value of CRP for incident cardiovascular events in
diabetic individuals.38 In contrast, the Women's Health
Study2 found that CRP added prognostic information regard-
ing cardiovascular events even in subjects with the metabolic
syndrome, and a study by Schulze et al27 found a strong
relationship between CRP and cardiovascular events among
men with diabetes. However, none of these studies focused
specifically on PAD, and none directly examined the role of
insulin resistance.
Given the conflicting data on the relationship of CRP and
vascular disease among subjects with diabetes and metabolic
syndrome, we explored the possibility that insulin resistance
in particular might influence the relationship between CRP
and PAD. Indeed, our analysis found a strong association
between CRP and PAD among individuals who were insulin
sensitive. However, this association was no longer evident in
subjects with insulin resistance.
The attenuation of the relationship between CRP and
PAD in the presence of insulin resistance may be explained
in part by the close interrelationship of inflammation and
insulin resistance in vascular disease.28 ­30,39 Extensive
experimental data demonstrate that inflammation leads to
impaired insulin metabolic signaling, resulting in insulin
resistance.39 Insulin resistance may in turn exacerbate
inflammation via increased cytokine and adipochemokine
expression (including tumor necrosis factor alpha-,
interleukin-6, leptin, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1,
plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, and others), elevation of
free fatty acid levels, and impaired endothelial nitric oxide
synthase activity.39,40 The reciprocal interaction of inflam-

mation and insulin resistance creates a cycle of further
increasing cardiovascular risk.
These findings also support the notion that atherogenesis
results from the complex interplay of multiple atherosclerotic
risk factors, each of variable influence in different vascular
beds. In individuals with few risk factors, inflammation may
have a relatively large contribution to the development of
atherosclerosis. In contrast, in the presence of a potent
cardiovascular risk factor, insulin resistance, the relative
contribution of inflammation to the pathogenesis of athero-
sclerosis may be diminished. In our study, subjects with
insulin resistance but without inflammation (CRP 1 mg/L)
already had a high prevalence of PAD (5.5%) compared with
those who were insulin sensitive and without inflammation
(2.2%). Among insulin-resistant subjects, the presence of
inflammation then resulted in only a marginal increase in
PAD prevalence (to 6.9% in the highest CRP category) that
was not statistically significant. Whether these data imply that
insulin resistance reduces the association of inflammation and
PAD by a distinct effect on vascular function or simply by
increasing inflammation, they highlight the complexity of the
interaction of these risk factors in PAD and suggest that the
role of inflammation in PAD may be modified in individuals
with insulin resistance.
Additionally, although there are common risk factors for
the development of vascular disease, the impact of specific
risk factors on the development of disease is not the same in
the peripheral vascular bed as in the coronary or cerebrovas-
cular circulations.41 Indeed, cigarette smoking, one of the
strongest risk factors for the development of PAD, was shown
in the Edinburgh Artery Study42 to have a greater impact on
PAD (OR, 1.8 to 5.6 for the risk of PAD in smokers versus
nonsmokers) than on coronary artery disease (OR, 1.1 to 1.6).
In contrast, hypertension and hyperlipidemia, potent risk
factors for coronary atherosclerosis, appear to have less
impact on the development of PAD, with a 10-mg/dL
increase in total cholesterol conferring only a 10% increased
risk of PAD.41 These findings suggest that individual risk
factors may have variable impact on different vascular beds,
and as such, a focused analysis of the impact of insulin
resistance on PAD is warranted and may shed light on the
differential pathophysiology of PAD compared with CAD
and cerebrovascular disease.
These pathophysiological differences may explain in part
the differences observed between our results and the findings
of the Women's Health Study2 and a study by Schulze et al,27
which suggest that CRP adds prognostic information regard-
ing incident cardiovascular disease in subjects with the
metabolic syndrome2 or diabetes27 at baseline. Our results
also stand in contrast to a cross-sectional study from Vu et
al43 in a smaller NHANES cohort suggesting that CRP
remains associated with PAD even in patients with metabolic
syndrome or diabetes, although not in those with established
cardiovascular disease. The discrepancy is explained in part
by differences in statistical methodology (the authors used the
group with low CRP and no established disease as the
reference population for all comparisons) and use of meta-
bolic syndrome as opposed to a direct measure of insulin
resistance.
These data are derived from a nationally representative
cohort and therefore are generalizable to the US adult
population. The ABI method has been demonstrated to have
excellent sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of
PAD.10 Despite these strengths, potential limitations of the
present study merit consideration. In NHANES, the ABI was
calculated from the blood pressure in only 1 arm, raising the
potential for misclassification by not excluding the possibility
of subclavian stenosis. Additionally, our analysis was limited
to the subset of participants with ABI measurements who had
a fasting blood sample drawn, reducing our sample size and
potentially limiting power. However, our final sample popu-
lation was nonetheless substantial, consisting of 3200
individuals in whom there were 256 cases of PAD. We also
are limited by the lack of established threshold values of
HOMA-IR for indicating the presence or absence of insulin
resistance. Prior studies have used quartiles8 or quintiles,6 and
given the lack established guidelines, we elected to use
standard median and quartile cut points in our analysis.
Additionally, there are notable differences in clinical vari-
ables by HOMA-IR quartile; even with multivariable models,
there may be confounding that may not be adequately
accounted for in our statistical models. Finally, the cross-
sectional nature of our study does not allow us to draw
conclusions regarding causality, and prospective studies are
required to clarify any temporal relationship and to delineate
the true causal relationships between inflammation, insulin
resistance, and PAD.
Conclusions
Insulin resistance is strongly and independently associated
with PAD. The presence of insulin resistance attenuates the
association of inflammation with PAD. These data establish a
role of insulin resistance in PAD and suggest that future
studies are warranted to better understand the complex
interplay of inflammation and insulin resistance in peripheral
arterial disease.

CLINICAL PERSPECTIVE
Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is an important manifestation of systemic atherosclerosis. Systemic inflammation and
insulin resistance are closely linked pathological states, and each contributes to the development of atherosclerosis.
However, the specific association of insulin resistance with PAD and the influence of insulin resistance on the relationship
between inflammation and PAD have not been established. Using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey 1999 to 2004, we found that insulin resistance, as measured by the homeostasis model of insulin resistance, is
strongly associated with PAD independently of known cardiovascular risk factors. Furthermore, we found that the presence
of insulin resistance blunts the association between inflammation, as measured by C-reactive protein, and PAD. These
findings suggest a direct link between PAD and insulin resistance along its entire spectrum and highlight the complex
interplay of insulin resistance and inflammation in atherosclerosis.
