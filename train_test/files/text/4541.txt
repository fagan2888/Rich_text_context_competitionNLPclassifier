Background Helminths have profound effects on the immune response, allowing
long-term survival of parasites with minimal damage to the host. Some of these
effects "spill-over", altering responses to non-helminth antigens or allergens. It is
suggested that this may lead to impaired responses to immunizations and
infections, while conferring benefits against inflammatory responses in allergic and
autoimmune disease. These effects might develop in utero, through exposure to
maternal helminth infections, or through direct exposure in later life.
Purpose To determine the effects of helminths and their treatment in pregnancy
and in young children on immunological and disease outcomes in childhood.
Methods The trial has three randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled
interventions at two times, in two people: a pregnant woman and her child.
Pregnant women are randomized to albendazole or placebo and praziquantel or
placebo. At age 15 months their children are randomized to three-monthly
albendazole or placebo, to continue to age five years. The proposed designation for
this sequence of interventions is a 2  2(2) factorial design.
Children are immunized with BCG and against polio, Diphtheria, tetanus, Pertussis,
Haemophilus, hepatitis B and measles. Primary immunological outcomes are responses
to BCG antigens and tetanus toxoid in whole blood cytokine assays and antibody
assays at one, three and five years of age. Primary disease outcomes are incidence of
malaria, pneumonia, diarrhoea, tuberculosis, measles, vertical HIV transmission, and
atopic disease episodes, measured at clinic visits and twice-monthly home visits. Effects
on anaemia, growth and intellectual development are also assessed.
Conclusion This trial, with a novel design comprising related interventions in
pregnant women and their offspring, is the first to examine effects of helminths and
their treatment in pregnancy and early childhood on immunological, infectious
disease and allergic disease outcomes. The results will enhance understanding of
both detrimental and beneficial effects of helminth infection and inform policy.

Introduction
Worldwide, more than 2 billion people have
helminth infections [1,2]. Concern regarding
effects on anaemia, nutrition, growth and intellec-
tual development, and specific disease syndromes,
has led to increasing advocacy for mass deworming
[3], with new recommendations for treatment in
two special, relatively unstudied groups ­ pregnant
women and preschool children [4]. Our study
addresses the effects of treatment in these two
groups.
Most people with helminths are unaware of their
infection, probably because helminth-induced
immunomodulation reduces host responses, allow-
ing parasite survival and minimizing tissue damage
[5]. This immunomodulation may "spill-over",
altering responses to unrelated organisms (viruses
[6], bacteria [7] and mycobacteria [8­10]) and
vaccines [11­15]).
We aim to determine whether these immunomod-
ulating effects are sufficient to reduce the efficacy of
immunization and increase susceptibility to infec-
tious diseases in childhood; and, if so, whether they
can be removed by deworming. In particular, it is
proposed that the high prevalence of helminth
infections in the tropics contributes to the low effi-
cacy of Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) immuniza-
tion and high incidence of tuberculosis in this
region [16­18]. BCG is frequently given to
neonates, before acquisition of helminth infection,
so the finding that exposure to helminths in utero
can influence the neonatal response to BCG may be
particularly important [19,20], but the implications
of observed changes in immune responses for
vaccine efficacy are not known. We planned, there-
fore, to study both the effects of maternal
helminths and of deworming during pregnancy,
and the effects of acquisition of helminths and
of deworming in early childhood, on responses
to immunization and on disease incidence in
childhood.
Helminth infections are generally considered
detrimental. However, recent evidence suggests that
they may have some benefits, protecting against
abnormal immune responses associated with atopic
and autoimmune disease [21­23]. Indeed, trials to
investigate the treatment of such conditions with
helminths are in progress [24,25]. Helminths may
also have a beneficial effect on the response to
other pathogens, perhaps protecting against severe
malaria [26], or modulating the progression of HIV
disease [27].
This trial is therefore designed to investigate the
balance of detrimental and beneficial effects of early
exposure to helminths and of their treatment. Here
we describe how the design of the trial evolved in
response to changes in policy regarding deworming
in pregnancy, to preliminary findings, and to results
from concurrent research. We show that the final
protocol involves a novel factorial design, examin-
ing related interventions not in the same study sub-
jects, but in pregnant women and their offspring.
This design gives efficiency with regard to logistics,
cost and trial burden in the community, but is also
pertinent to policy, as interactions between the
interventions, or additive effects would be impor-
tant during implementation.
Hypotheses
Our initial hypothesis anticipated that maternal
and childhood helminth infection would have
detrimental effects on the response to childhood
immunizations and to infectious diseases in
infancy. However, our preliminary findings [23],
and results from concurrent research [21,22,26,27],
suggested possible benefits in relation to disease
mediated by poorly regulated inflammatory
responses. Thus our current hypotheses, amended
in response to preliminary findings, are that 1)
maternal and childhood helminth infections
reduce the effectiveness of childhood immunizations
and increase susceptibility to viral and bacterial infec-
tious diseases, while reducing the incidence of
diseases mediated by poorly-regulated inflammatory
responses; 2) treatment of maternal and childhood
helminth infection improves the effectiveness of
childhood immunizations and modulates disease
incidence in childhood, with both beneficial and
detrimental effects.
Design
The study was designed in 2000/2001 to evaluate
presumptive treatment with albendazole in preg-
nancy and early childhood and commenced in June
2002. Results from 104 women enrolled using this
design (the "preliminary study") have been
reported [20,23]. In September 2002 the World
Health Organization (WHO) recommended that
pregnant and lactating women with schistosomiasis
no longer be excluded from treatment, but be given
praziquantel individually or during mass treatment
[4]. Therefore, the study was discontinued and
redesigned to include the use of praziquantel in
pregnancy. The revised design is presented here.
Recruitment using the revised design (the "main
study") ran from April 2003 to November 2005.
The study is a clinical trial with three ran-
domised interventions at two times, two in preg-
nant women, and one in their children. For this we
propose the designation, a 2  2(2) factorial
design (Figure 1).

(1) During pregnancy, women are randomized to
albendazole versus placebo and praziquantel
versus placebo: women receive a) praziquan-
tel  albendazole, b) praziquantel  placebo, c)
albendazole  placebo, or d) placebos only. All
women are treated with both drugs after delivery.
(2) At age 15 months their children are random-
ized to three-monthly albendazole or placebo, to
continue to age five years. This randomization is
independent of the mother's. Children provide
stool samples at annual visits and are treated for
helminths found.
The two intervention times create two phases.
The first addresses effects of maternal helminths
and maternal treatment, with immunological
outcomes measured at age one year, and clinical
events analysed from age zero to 15 months. The
second addresses the duration of effects of maternal
helminths and maternal treatment, and effects of
acquisition of helminths and of three-monthly
treatment with albendazole in childhood.
Setting
The study area comprises Entebbe Municipality
and Katabi subcounty, a peninsula in Lake Victoria,
Uganda (Figure 2) occupied by semiurban, rural
and fishing communities. The prevalence of
helminths among pregnant women is 66% [23]
(Schistosoma mansoni, 23%; hookworm, 38%;
Mansonella perstans, 22% [20]); the prevalence of
HIV, 13% [28]. Malaria, pneumonia and diarrhoea
are common in young children. Atopic disease is
expected to be sufficiently common to be assessed
as an outcome [23].
Recruitment and follow-up
Participation of the Ministry of Health, Entebbe
Hospital and the community were, and are crucial
to preparation for the study, recruitment and
follow-up. Before the study began, the research
Figure 1 A clinical trial with three randomised, placebo-
controlled treatments at two times: a 2  2(2) factorial
design
Figure 2 Study setting
team collaborated with the Ministry and Hospital
to provide training in prevention of mother-
to-child HIV transmission (PMTCT) and implement
PMTCT using nevirapine [29] in Entebbe.
Concurrently, maternity staff participated in plan-
ning the study and trained in data and sample
collection. Research procedures were integrated
into antenatal and maternity routines.
Meetings were also held with community leaders.
The study area comprises 57 villages, each with
an elected executive. Each committee appointed
volunteer assistants, two at first, supplemented
as the study expanded, to a total of approximately
150 volunteers. Volunteers visit participants twice
a month to make simple checks on the baby's
health, and attend monthly meetings to provide
feedback. They receive a bicycle and a small
allowance. Their work is supervised by full-
time field-workers, and verified by routine
checks with participants and spot-checks at their
homes.
Study procedures are outlined in Figure 3.
Routine follow-up visits are at six, 10 and 14 weeks
(polio, Diphtheria, tetanus, Pertussis, Haemophilus
and hepatitis B immunization), six months, nine
months (measles immunization) and one year.
Thereafter children are seen quarterly, to receive
study medication; vitamin A is given six-monthly.
Mothers bring participating children for interim
visits if they are sick.
Nevirapine for PMTCT and antiretroviral
therapy, if required, for HIV-positive participants,
are provided through the Hospital.
Information and consent
Written and verbal information is provided
in English and the vernacular. Documents written
in the vernacular are checked by back-translation.
Consent is recorded by signature or thumb-
print. Before enrolment, women consent for partic-
ipation during pregnancy and for their expected
infants' participation to age one year. There
is no lower age limit for inclusion: all pregnant
women (including those younger than 18 years)
are entitled to give consent in Uganda, and investi-
gation of the interventions among a represen-
tative population, including the youngest women
whose helminth prevalence might be highest
[30], was considered appropriate. After the baby
is delivered, mothers are given written information
to take home for the fathers. When infants are
one-year old, information is provided, and
consent obtained, for the trial of treatment in
childhood. The mother or father (or guardian if
both are deceased or unavailable) consents for the
child.
Parasitology
Stool and blood samples are obtained from women
at enrolment and delivery; from children at annual
visits. Stools are examined using the Kato-Katz
method [31,32] and charcoal culture for
Strongyloides [31,33]. Two Kato-Katz slides are pre-
pared from each sample, each examined within 30
minutes for hookworm, the following day for other
parasites. Blood is examined for Mansonella by a
modified Knott's method [34]. Intensity of infec-
tion is assessed by egg counts in stool and microfi-
larial counts in blood.
Interventions
Deworming women during pregnancy and after
delivery
The interventions during pregnancy are given as a
single treatment, at any time during the second or
third trimester.
The randomization code was prepared by the
trial statistician using Stata version 7 (College
Station, Texas, USA). Numbers were allocated in
blocks of 100 to four groups:
1) Praziquantel  albendazole
2) Praziquantel  placebo matching albendazole
3) Placebo matching praziquantel  albendazole
4) Placebo matching praziquantel  placebo
matching albendazole
Chewable albendazole and matching placebo
tablets were supplied in bulk (GlaxoSmithKline,
Brentford, UK). Praziquantel tablets, (Medochemie
Ltd, Limassol, Cyprus) were used to prepare identi-
cal praziquantel 300 mg and placebo capsules
(Almedica Europe Ltd, Deeside, UK). Colleagues in
Entebbe, not otherwise involved in the study,
prepare opaque, sealed envelopes, numbered
according to the randomization code, containing a
single dose of albendazole 400 mg (or matching
placebo) and 12 capsules of praziquantel (or match-
ing placebo).
Interviewer-counsellors allocate treatment in
order of the randomization sequence to women
enrolling at the antenatal clinic and observe the
treatment. Each woman receives 400 mg albenda-
zole (or matching placebo) and praziquantel cap-
sules (or matching placebo) equivalent to a dose of
40 mg/kg; leftover capsules are discarded.
Six weeks after delivery all women receive alben-
dazole 400 mg and praziquantel 40 mg/kg, with
additional anthelmintic treatment if indicated by
stool results (such as prolonged treatment for
Strongyloides). This was considered necessary, to
avoid prolonged delay in treatment of women for

potentially damaging helminth infections. Of
concern for interpretation of the results of the trial
is the possibility that there might be an effect on
the infant, mediated through breastfeeding, of
treating the mother after delivery. By treating all
women after delivery, any such effects are kept as
similar as possible between the intervention groups
(although, unavoidably, the reduction in worm
loads in those treated during pregnancy may mean
that effects of the second treatment are not
identical between groups). A second option, treat-
ing only those not treated during pregnancy, would
have meant that any effect of treatment during
breastfeeding would be confined to the groups not
treated during pregnancy, creating uncertainty
about whether treatment during pregnancy or after
delivery was more important in determining
outcomes in the children. The third option, not
treating women after delivery, or waiting for, say, a
year, was not considered to be ethical, due to
Figure 3 Study procedures
the resulting neglect of treatment or prolonged
delay.
Deworming children aged 15 months
to five years
The intervention in childhood is albendazole or
placebo given three-monthly.
A second randomization code, for treatment of
children, was prepared by the trial statistician using
Stata version 7. Study numbers were allocated in
blocks of 80 to two groups: albendazole or placebo.
Syrups for children under two years are supplied
by GlaxoSmithKline, ready-labelled with the ran-
domization code. Three bottles (15, 18 and
21-month doses) are provided for each child.
Each contains 10 mL syrup, equivalent to 400 mg
albendazole.
Chewable tablets of albendazole or matching
placebo are supplied in bulk for older children. The
second randomization code is used by colleagues in
Entebbe, not otherwise involved in the study, to
prepare opaque, sealed envelopes, numbered
according to the code, containing albendazole
tablets (or matching placebo) to be taken three-
monthly by children aged two years and above.
Children attending at 15 months are allocated
treatment by the nurse in charge in order of the
second randomization sequence. Children receive
200 mg (5 mL) albendazole syrup (or matching
placebo) at age 15, 18 and 21 months; the remain-
ing syrup from each bottle is discarded. Children
receive 400mg albendazole or matching placebo
three-monthly from age two to five years. Nurses
give and observe the treatments.
Stool samples from children are examined at
each annual visit; helminths found are treated.
All clinical staff and participants will remain
blinded to treatment allocations for women and
children until the study is complete.
Outcomes
The principal outcomes are:
1) Immunological responses to BCG and tetanus
immunization
2) Incidence of infection in childhood with malaria
and Mycobacterium tuberculosis.
3) Incidence of infectious and atopic disease events
in childhood (pneumonia, diarrhoea, malaria,
measles, tuberculosis and vertical HIV transmis-
sion; atopic eczema, urticaria, allergic rhinitis
and conjunctivitis, wheeze).
Secondary outcomes are anaemia, growth and
development.
Immunological responses to
childhood immunisations
Cellular responses to antigens from BCG and to
tetanus toxoid will be measured using whole blood
cytokine assays [20,35], providing data on the type
and quantity of cytokine produced. Measurements
will be made in samples obtained at age one, three
and five years.
BCG is a live, attenuated strain of Mycobacterium
bovis. Immunization usually leads to scarring at the
inoculation site and sometimes to complications
such as abscess formation, lymphadenopathy or
disseminated disease [36]. Examining our
preliminary data, we realized that helminth-
induced changes in the response to BCG might
influence not only cytokine responses, but also scar
size [20] and perhaps the incidence of complica-
tions. Therefore, in the final protocol, these
outcomes are systematically documented at age
six weeks and one year, and as illness events if
appropriate.
Tetanus immunization induces antibody produc-
tion, required for its beneficial effect. Antibody will
be measured at age one, three and five years.
Assessment of responses to measles immunization
will be performed in a substudy.
Incidence of infection
Helminth infection may influence disease expres-
sion for malaria [26], and our preliminary data
suggest a possible beneficial effect on disease
incidence in children aged two to three years
(unpublished data). However an effect on incidence
of infection is perhaps unlikely, since this depends
on biting by infected mosquitoes. To make this
distinction, malaria parasitaemia will be deter-
mined at annual visits. In view of the potential
public health importance of understanding the
effects of helminths on malaria, measurement of
anti-malarial antibody was added to the planned
measurements, in the final protocol, as an
additional surrogate measure of incidence of
infection [37].
On the other hand, recent data suggest that
BCG immunization may protect against infection
with Mycobacterium tuberculosis, as well as
against disease [38]. If so, helminth infection
may modulate this protective effect. Thus, in
addition to the outcome of tuberculosis disease
(planned from the outset, and discussed below)
we will estimate the incidence of tuberculosis
infection at annual visits by examining the cellular
response to antigens (such as early secreted antigen-
6) present in Mycobacterium tuberculosis but
not BCG.

Clinical Trials 2007; 4: 42­57 http://ctj.sagepub.com
Incidence of disease events
The initial protocol focussed on infectious disease
outcomes. In response to preliminary results and
concurrent research, atopic diseases outcomes were
added.
Disease events are documented at clinic visits.
Pneumonia is defined as cough, with difficulty in
breathing, and fast breathing (defined by age), with
or without abnormal breath sounds [39]. X-rays dis-
tinguish clinical and radiological pneumonia [40].
Diarrhoea is defined by the mother's report, with
stool frequency recorded [41]. Malaria is defined as
fever with parasitaemia, but this definition will be
reviewed as data on asymptomatic parasitaemia at
routine visits accrues, allowing a definition related
to asymptomatic parasite counts to be developed
[42]. Measles is defined by standard clinical criteria,
confirmed by measurement of specific IgM [43].
Tuberculosis suspects are investigated using gastric
aspirates, lymph node aspirates, or material from
other sites, for culture using BACTECTM (Becton
Dickinson, Sparks, Maryland, USA). Where positive
cultures cannot be obtained, a diagnostic algorithm
is used [44,45].
Data from clinic visits are supported by data col-
lected at twice-monthly, community visits.
Vertical transmission of HIV infection is deter-
mined by viral RNA assays (HIV-1 RNA 3.0 assay;
Bayer plc, Newbury, UK) in cord blood and at age
six weeks; by HIV-antibody tests at age 18 months.
Atopic eczema, urticaria, allergic rhinitis, allergic
conjunctivitis and wheeze are defined using criteria
from the International Study of Asthma and
Allergies in Childhood (ISAAC) [46], modified to
suit our young age-group. Documentation of clinic
events will be complemented by ISAAC-based ques-
tionnaires at age one and four years.
Anaemia, growth and development
Our principal objectives relate to immunological,
infectious and atopic disease outcomes. However,
effects on anaemia, growth and development are
important for evaluation of overall risks and
benefits of deworming.
Haemoglobin is measured in women at enrolment
and delivery; in cord blood, and in children at
annual visits.
Growth is assessed by birthweight, weights at all
routine visits, and measurements of height, head
circumference and mid upper-arm circumference at
annual visits.
Intellectual function is assessed at age 15 months, by
trained clinical staff, using a culturally appropriate
tool (the Kilifi Developmental Inventory; Wellcome
Trust Unit, Kilifi, Kenya). A new tool will be devel-
oped for assessment in children aged five years.
Statistical considerations
The analyses will have two components: analysis of
the intervention trial (which is randomized) and
analysis of the effects of helminths (which is obser-
vational).
Major analyses will be conducted for each phase
of the study.
(1) When all children complete age 15 months,
analyses will address effects of maternal
helminths and maternal treatment on outcomes
in infancy.
(2) When all children complete five years, analyses
will address the duration of effects originating in
pregnancy, and effects of acquisition of
helminths and of three-monthly albendazole
between age one and five years.
Unblinded analyses conducted before the end of
the trial, such as Phase 1 analyses, will be performed
by the trial statistician. Other staff will see only
aggregated data.
Analysis of the interventions in pregnancy
and of maternal helminth infection
The interventions in pregnancy will be analysed by
intention to treat. Effects of presumptive treatment
on study outcomes for the whole study population
will be examined. Three subgroup analyses are
planned, as follows, because effects are expected to
be stronger when mothers have susceptible species:
(1) effects of albendazole if mother had any species
susceptible to albendazole at enrolment;
(2) effects of albendazole if mother had hookworm
at enrolment (the commonest infection, most
responsive to albendazole [20]);
(3) effects of praziquantel if mother had schistoso-
miasis at enrolment.
Interactions between the treatments will be
examined.
It is possible that effects of helminths during
pregnancy, established before the interventions are
given, may not be altered or reversed by the inter-
ventions. Further, some species of helminth, such
as Mansonella, are unlikely to be affected by the
interventions. Thus it will be of interest to examine
the effects of helminth infection at enrolment on
the study outcomes, in addition to the effects of the
interventions on the study outcomes. The analysis
of the effects of helminths at enrolment will obser-
vational. Differences in effect according to
helminth species and intensity of infection, will be
examined. This analysis will use logistic or Poisson
regression or Cox proportional hazards methods (as
appropriate to each outcome), to take account of
potential confounding factors including maternal
age and tribe, maternal malaria or HIV infection
during pregnancy, the socioeconomic status of the
family and location of residence.
This general approach will be used for analysis of
effects of maternal helminths and maternal treat-
ment on study outcomes when children reach 15
months, and again at five years. At five years, analy-
ses will adjust for the acquisition and treatment of
helminths in childhood.
Analysis of the intervention in childhood
and of the acquisition of helminths between
age one and five years
The intervention in childhood will be analysed by
intention to treat, for the whole study population.
No subgroup analyses are planned.
Analysis of the effects of acquisition of
helminths will employ categories such as never
infected versus ever infected; age at first infection;
total number of annual visits at which infection is
found and will take account of potential confound-
ing factors, as discussed above in relation to effects
of maternal helminths.
The effects of the intervention in childhood, and
of acquisition of helminths, will be adjusted for
effects of the interventions and of helminth status
in pregnancy.
Interactions between maternal and childhood
interventions will be examined.
Twin and triplet pregnancies
Women with twin or triplet pregnancies are
enrolled, and treatment given as for singleton preg-
nancies. In the analysis allowance will be made for
"clustering" by mother.
Sample-size
Considerations regarding sample size evolved with
the change in study design to include praziquantel
as a second intervention in pregnancy, and with the
acquisition of data from the preliminary part of the
study, as outlined below.
A cohort of 2500 women has been recruited. This
sample-size was planned for the initial design (pre-
sumptive treatment with albendazole in pregnancy
and early childhood), as sufficient to detect effects
on immunological outcomes and common disease
events, and with the hope of detecting an effect on
incidence of tuberculosis in children under five
years old. No information was available for inci-
dence of tuberculosis in children in the study area.
In a well-documented community in South Africa
the incidence in under-fives was 3588/100 000p.a.;
3.5 times the incidence in adults [47]. The esti-
mated overall incidence in Uganda was 320/
100 000 p.a. [48], so a figure of 500/100 000 p.a. for
under-fives might be conservative. It was estimated
that, for the effect of albendazole in pregnancy, or
for a binary, combined variable for exposure to
helminths in utero and/or in childhood (expected to
be about 50%), a study with 1170 children in each
arm and median follow-up of three years would
have 80% power with   0.05 to detect a differ-
ence in incidence of 250/100 000 to 750/100 000
cases p.a. between groups. This estimate of effect
was large. However, the study seeks to examine the
possibility that helminths are crucial to the large
difference observed in efficacy of BCG between
temperate regions (often above 70%) and the rural
tropics (close to 0%) [61]. If this was so, then a large
effect was expected. It was noted that, for compari-
son of the effects of three-monthly albendazole
versus placebo in childhood, extension of the
follow-up period might be required.
Following the change in study design and acqui-
sition of data from the preliminary study the power
of the study to detect important effects and interac-
tions between interventions was reviewed, assuming
follow-up to age five years. In the preliminary study,
approximately 90% of enrolled mothers were seen
at delivery and 85% had live babies who entered
follow-up. Of live babies, 75% were seen at one
year. Although follow-up in the main study has
been better than in the preliminary study, the
figures from the preliminary study (with an esti-
mate of 10% loss to follow up per year after one
year) were used when the power of the study was
reviewed. Estimates may, therefore, be conservative.
Preliminary results suggest that the sample-size
will be adequate for immunological objectives.
Following neonatal BCG immunization, we
observed a difference in mean log10
production of
the cytokine, gamma interferon, in response to
mycobacterial antigens, of 0.64 log10
comparing
infants of mothers with hookworm to infants of
mothers without worms, and a difference of 0.28
log10
between infants of mothers with hookworm
who did, or did not receive albendazole [20].
Estimating attendance of 1594 infants at one year,
and 1046 children at five years, and standard
deviations of 0.8 log10
for mean log10
cytokine
responses, we anticipate 80% power with   0.05
to detect differences between intervention arms at
one year (and five years) of 0.11 (0.14) log10
cytokine response for the whole population, 0.16
(0.19) log10
for the subgroup whose mothers had
hookworm and 0.26 (0.33) log10
for those whose
mothers had schistosomiasis.
For clinical outcomes, Tables 1 and 2 illustrate the
smallest treatment effects that the study will detect,

with 80% power and   0.05. The figures apply to
effects of either maternal treatment, and, where
given for all children aged one to five, to the inter-
vention in childhood. The study has power to detect
small effects, except for tuberculosis, where the effect
size would have to be large; and to detect interactions
between treatments for most variables: for example,
an interaction effect of 1.59 for eczema [49].
Effects of helminths are expected to be stronger
than effects of the interventions, so, for common
outcomes, the anticipated sample-size will allow for
inclusion of confounding factors in the analysis.
On the basis of these considerations, the trial
steering committee decided to retain the planned
sample-size.
Ethical considerations
Given uncertainty regarding the immunological
benefits and risks of treating helminths in preg-
nancy and early childhood, a placebo-controlled
trial was undertaken. There was concern that inter-
ventions in pregnancy might lead to serious adverse
birth outcomes, so a data monitoring committee
(DMC) was established to monitor these and other
serious adverse events. Further, because a transient
increase in HIV load following anthelmintic treat-
ment [50] might cause an increase in vertical HIV
transmission, results for HIV RNA assays performed
in HIV-exposed infants at six weeks of age are
also reported to the DMC. Ethical considerations
specific to the interventions, are as follows.
Albendazole versus placebo in pregnancy
Albendazole treatment during pregnancy can have
a benefit for anaemia in areas of high hookworm
prevalence [51]. Therefore women with haemoglo-
bin below 8g/dL are excluded and referred for treat-
ment of hookworm (Table 3); haematinics and
presumptive treatment for malaria (interventions
with a similar or greater benefit for anaemia in
pregnancy [51,52]) are provided.
Additional suggested benefits of albendazole in
pregnancy include improvements in birthweight
and infant survival [53­55] but these have not been
demonstrated in controlled trials.
Teratogenicity is a concern in the use of benzim-
idazoles during pregnancy (reported in animals, but
not in humans) [56]. Therefore women are enrolled
after the first trimester.
Praziquantel versus placebo in pregnancy
Before our study started, no investigations of prazi-
quantel treatment in pregnancy had been per-
formed. Although presumed safe, based on animal
studies, its use was therefore avoided in pregnancy;
breastfeeding was discontinued for 72 hours after
treatment to avoid toxicity to the infant. The WHO
consultation of 2002 recommended use of prazi-
quantel during pregnancy based on a lack of evi-
dence of toxicity in a small number of pregnant
women treated for cysticercosis, and in large
numbers treated inadvertently during mass-
treatment campaigns, and on concerns regarding
prolonged neglect of treatment of schistosomiasis
in women of child-bearing years [4]. However, the
anecdotal data for cysticercosis do not provide
insight into the effects of killing intravenous schis-
tosomes. In particular, the systemic and transpla-
cental immunological effects of treatment of
schistosomiasis in pregnancy are unknown; the
benefits and risks for maternal and neonatal health,
remain uncertain.
Persistent diarrhoea with blood is the pathologi-
cal effect of chronic schistosomiasis mansoni most
likely to show an immediate response to treatment,
so women with these symptoms are excluded and
referred for investigation and treatment (Table 3).
Prolonged neglect of treatment is avoided in this
study by treatment of all women after delivery.
Three-monthly albendazole versus placebo
in children aged 15 months to five years
Since our study was planned, results have been pub-
lished describing a trial of deworming in children
under five years old in Zanzibar [57,58]. Outcomes
included growth, anaemia and cognitive develop-
ment. This study showed no statistically significant,

overall benefit of deworming. Subgroup analyses
found that mebendazole was associated with a
reduction in wasting malnutrition in children
under 30 months, and in moderate anaemia for
children under 24 months. The observation of
benefit principally in the youngest children, with
the lightest worm burdens, was the reverse of the
result expected. The authors suggest that the
youngest children might be particularly vulnerable
to the effects of helminths, or that inflammatory
processes during the response to initial helminth
infections might have a particularly severe effect.
The inconclusive and unexpected nature of these
results, added to the possibility that intensive
deworming may have adverse effects on atopic
disease and on severity of malaria, suggests
equipoise of potential beneficial and detrimental
effects, supporting the need for further study.

Discussion
There is increasing advocacy for deworming, with a
recent focus on pregnancy and early childhood.
Together with concern regarding effects on
anaemia, nutrition, growth and development, there
is intense interest in the hypothesis that helminths
impair the response to vaccines and increase
susceptibility to infectious diseases, while perhaps
protecting against immunologically-mediated
conditions such as atopic and autoimmune disease
and severe malaria. There is increasing evidence of
the importance of prenatal exposures (including
exposure to helminth infection) for health out-
comes in later life. Despite the potential importance
of such effects for health policy, few investigations
have been conducted to determine the magnitude
of the proposed effects of helminths, or the ability
of treatment to modify them.
Our study design has three aspects of particular
note. First, is the intention to examine effects of
helminths and of their treatment in the same study.
Analysis of the effects of helminths is pertinent,
because their magnitude is uncertain, but must take
account of confounding with factors such as
poverty and malnutrition. Examining the results of
treatment in a randomized trial may provide more
rigorous evidence of helminth-induced effects. This
is illustrated in Table 4 by a detailed breakdown of
results regarding the effects of maternal helminth
infection on the incidence of infantile eczema from
our preliminary study [23]. Although based on
small numbers, and given the proviso that the
analysis of effects of helminths requires adjustment
for confounders, the results seem to show, in the
placebo group, the albendazole-treated group and
overall, that the rate of eczema was about five times
higher in infants whose mothers never had
helminths (none-none) compared with those
whose mothers had persistent helminths (any-any).
In all helminth-status groups, the rate of eczema
was higher in the albendazole-treated group than
the placebo group (except none-any where both
rates were zero and numbers small). A small effect
of albendazole among those whose mothers never
had helminths (none-none) may be attributed to
clearing of infections not detected by the single
stool examination; a large effect among those
whose mothers cleared their infection (any-none)
suggests that the risk of eczema was highest in
infants of mothers who had helminths that were
cleared by treatment. Thus data suggesting an effect
of helminths can be supported by evidence suggest-
ing a reversal of their effect by treatment. At the
same time, the effects of a policy of presumptive
treatment in pregnancy can be considered.
Second, we have chosen to examine effects of
both albendazole and praziquantel during preg-
nancy in the same trial. This is relevant, since
deworming policy is likely to recommend both in
regions where geohelminths and schistosomiasis
are coprevalent [59,60]. However, there is increas-
ing evidence that immunological effects vary
between helminth genera. Studying these two treat-
ments in a factorial design will allow us to examine
their effects both separately and together.
Third, we have chosen to incorporate a trial of
the effects of deworming in young children in the
same cohort as a trial of deworming in pregnancy.
This again reflects emerging policy. Some losses are
inevitable between pregnancy and childhood, so
the number of people randomized in the childhood
component differs from the number randomized
during pregnancy, and the people themselves,
being mother and child are different. Despite this,
the interventions are related and may have interact-
ing or additive effects; hence the proposed, novel
designation, a 2  2(2) factorial design. This
approach is, as far as we know, unprecedented, but
is particularly relevant to the implementation of
related interventions in mothers and children,
when important interactions, such as potentiation
of effects of interventions in pregnancy by inter-
vention in childhood, may occur.
In addition to achieving scientific goals, the
combining of objectives is a matter of expediency.
Despite uncertainty regarding the benefits and risks

of deworming in pregnancy and young children,
enthusiasm for these policies means that the
window of opportunity for conducting such studies
is likely to be short. Indeed, our ability to detect
effects of the acquisition and treatment of
helminths in young children may be limited by the
on-going provision of albendazole in Uganda by
community-based distributors and on twice-yearly
"child days"; this extra treatment is, however, mon-
itored in the study, and uptake is likely to be similar
between the randomized groups.
The study has several potential limitations. First,
the sample-size may be insufficient for evaluation
of rare outcomes. Interpretation of the effects of
helminths on the response to immunization
depends, ultimately, on incidence of disease, thus
rare outcomes of particular interest include tubercu-
losis and measles. The likely incidence of tuberculo-
sis infection and disease in the cohort remains low
and uncertain. The incidence of measles may
increase in older children as vaccine-induced protec-
tion wanes, but depends, among other things, on
vaccine coverage in the community. Similarly, while
effects on infantile eczema are of interest, effects on
long-term risk of asthma will be of greater impor-
tance. Follow-up is currently planned to age five
years, but longer follow-up may be required to
obtain conclusive results for such conditions.
Second, the results may not all be generalisable.
Communities differ in important respects, such as
species and intensity of helminth infection, nutri-
tional status, and exposure to non-pathogenic
mycobacteria that may influence immunity to
tuberculosis [61], to pathogens (such as malaria and
HIV), to allergens, and to pollutants that may influ-
ence responses to allergens [62­64]. Similar studies
are needed in other settings.
Advocacy for deworming has created a climate in
which delayed or infrequent deworming may be
thought unethical. To our knowledge, the only
clearly demonstrated benefit of deworming in preg-
nancy is a reduction in hookworm-associated
anaemia and the benefits of frequent de-worming
for children under five are uncertain. In the absence
of proven benefit, and given the possibility of detri-
mental effects such as teratogenicity, promotion of
atopic disease or increased severity of malaria,
placebo-controlled trials remain appropriate.
Safeguards to prevent neglect of severe anaemia, or
of tissue-damaging infections, can be incorporated
into the study design, as described.
This is the first trial undertaken to examine the
effects of helminths, and of deworming in preg-
nancy and young children, on immunological,
infectious disease and atopic disease outcomes in
children. The design will allow the role of
helminths and benefits of deworming to be eluci-
dated in relation to the more conventional
outcomes of anaemia, growth and development,
also. The results are expected to inform policy and
to enhance understanding of both detrimental and
beneficial effects of helminth infection.
