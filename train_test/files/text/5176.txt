Abstract
What does the abundance of data and proliferation of data-making methods mean for the ordinary person, the person on
the street? And, what could they come to mean? In this paper, we present an overview of a year-long project to examine
just such questions and complicate, in some ways, what it is to ask them. The project is a collective exercise in which we
­ a mixture of social scientists, designers and makers ­ and those living and working on one street in Cambridge (UK),
Tenison Road, are working to think through how data might be materialised and come to matter. The project aims to
better understand the specificities and contingencies that arise when data is produced and used in place. Mid-way
through the project, we use this commentary to give some background to the work and detail one or two of the
troubles we have encountered in putting locally relevant data to work. We also touch on a methodological standpoint we
are working our way into and through, one that we hope complicates the separations between subject and object in data-
making and opens up possibilities for a generative refiguring of the manifold relations.

Take a look at the graphs in Figure 1. They present two
fairly typical examples of visualisations charting some
kind of data over time. In this case, they are the data a
few of us at Microsoft Research in Cambridge (UK)
have collected, over 18 hours, of vehicle and bicycle
journeys outside our office building.
But why are we collecting this data? To what end?
And when and where might it be put to use? To put it
another way, how might data like this ­ the flows of
traffic on a mostly residential road ­ come to matter?
Where might it matter and to whom?
It is precisely this line of questioning around data
mattering that has motivated a year-long project we
(a mixture of social and computer scientists, and
designers) are embarking on with the people living
and working on Tenison Road. The project, handily
called the Tenison Road project, stems from some trou-
bles we have had with all the excitement about data
being reported in the popular press and matched by
at least some of the claims coming from our academic-
ally minded colleagues. It is hard not to open a news-
paper, or for that matter a journal issue or conference
proceedings, without seeing some quite fantastic stories
stemming from a deluge of data of one sort or another.
At one extreme, we have some pretty exaggerated
claims envisioning data and especially Big Data as the
final answer for understanding just about anything that
has been, hitherto, too complex to understand. At the
other, we see an abundance of stories predicting that a
surveillance society, afforded by the proliferation of
personal data and hyperconnectivity, is set to dismantle
civic life as we know it. The trouble is that these it must
be said not altogether unwarranted concerns (see
Solove, 2011) tell us very little about how ordinary
folk make sense of data and how they might put it to
use if they had a choice. They say very little, if you will,
about what data might be on the street.
So, the Tenison Road project is in some small and
concentrated way a means to examine how data could
come to matter in a place and amongst people with
some very real ideas and concerns. For a year, eight

of us from Microsoft Research ­ along with some aca-
demic collaborators ­ are hoping to develop a sense of
how data might be materialised and why it might come
to matter for those who have a locale in common,
people bound not in some seemingly arbitrary way
through nodes in a dataset, but by the location they
work and live in. As such, the work represents an
effort to understand data as coming from somewhere
and intended for someone ­ notably in contrast to how
it seems in much of the Big Data rhetoric as `raw' and
somehow from nowhere and for no one in particular
(Mackenzie, 2006). It is then, to use a very particular
case, to think about not just technology development
but broader themes in social life, such as privacy and
data protection; the freedom of access to data; civic
participation and engagement; data-related policy
making; and generally how data might enable fuller
and hopefully better lives for citizens.
So, what is it we are doing exactly? For five months
now (beginning in November 2013), we have been
meeting, monthly, with some of Tenison Road's resi-
dents ­ those who have chosen to respond to our flyers,
posters and emails (we have over 60 people we are in
email contact with and the meetings have between 20
and 30 residents who regularly attend). Over that time,
we have collectively spoken about how data might be
relevant to Tenison Road and what matters to the
`community' (a term that is itself contested). These dis-
cussions are giving rise to several threads of activity
including monitoring traffic volumes, noise levels and
air quality; building an archive of the road's social his-
tory; and recording particular aspects of contemporary
life such as residents' movements, plant/wildlife, etc.
In gradually building up these disparate forms of
data, the aim has been to figure out how they should
serve the collective interests of Tenison Road. To this
end we have, together with the community, been work-
ing with different ways of storing, aggregating and
visualising the data. Again, the overarching ambition
has been to examine how data might come to matter to
the range of people who live and work on a street.
Naturally, such an ambition has surfaced tensions
around the data we are collecting, how we are collecting
it, who has rights to it, and how forms of authority,
control, omission, absence, etc. are performed through
what we might think of as these collective activities of
`making data matter' ­ or as Wilson (2011: 859) calls it
`the materiality of code-work'. Furthermore, they have
shown the manifold meanings that data can come to
have when put to work in everyday life. Let us offer a
particular cut through our activities to provide a fla-
vour of the tensions and multiplicities.
The traffic-related data we are beginning to record is,
in fact, motivated by significant changes that are under-
way at the southern end of Tenison Road, where it
intersects with the approach to Cambridge's one and
only railway station. At its formal opening in 1889, the
road ended some way from the station, separated by

rural land. Over time, the road extended and came to be
an important and well-used thoroughfare between West
Cambridge, to the north, and Cambridge Railway
Station, to the south. Today, as the residents regularly
lament, the road is used as a rat run for commuter
traffic and especially taxis that service the station
(Figure 2).
Traffic monitoring surveys had been commissioned
in 2012 by Cambridge County Council on behalf of the
residents to assess the severity of the problems and
judge whether any re-design of the road network
might alleviate traffic volumes. These surveys in part
contributed to funds (500,000) being earmarked for
road-calming measures, but to date no decisions have
been made as to what these might be. Since the surveys,
however, a set of far more significant planned changes
to the station area have given rise to yet further anxi-
eties for the community. Ongoing building work and
recently granted planning permission (of both offices
and residential flats) near the station will dramatically
increase the numbers of people passing through the
area. The residents association that Tenison Road resi-
dents are active in, GTARA, estimates the increase in
daily footfall from the proposed office space alone to be
in the order of 1500 people. Furthermore, the re-plan-
ning of the area includes a re-routing of traffic so that
the southern end of Tenison Road becomes the primary
station access road for taxis and private vehicles.
Understandably, then, there are members of the
community who are deeply concerned and looking for
ways to have some recourse with both the County
Council and the developers. It is in this context that
the Tenison Road project was launched and thus it is
hardly surprising that traffic monitoring was very
quickly raised as a candidate for thinking about data
and how it might be used.
From early on our efforts have focused on collecting
journey data (as above) using a thermal imaging
camera and visualising the results in different formats
(Figure 3). As the graphs show, current volumes are

indeed substantial and in aggregate the numbers appear
to have been a surprise even to those residents who
have been actively involved in our meetings. What
has been arguably more enlightening, however, has
been how different ideas for data sources have entered
into the conversations. The volume and speed of traffic
are, by some, thought not to adequately reflect their
worries. In one of our meetings a resident voiced a
greater concern for the noise on the street. He went
so far as to say he did not especially care how many
vehicles used the road or the speed at which they tra-
velled; he just did not want to hear them from inside
To capture traffic data, we have installed a thermal imaging camera to the roof of
the Microsoft Research building at the intersection of Tenison Road and Station
Road, in Cambridge (Figure 3(a)). Using heat readings, the camera is able to
disambiguate objects from a relatively temperature-uniform background (Figure 3(b)).

Our aim is to develop a range of ways for the data to be analysed and represented,
each of which will afford different kinds of interpretations from different types
of agents. For example, we are currently building a series of public installations
that will display information about speeds, traffic volumes, vehicle types, etc.
Figure 3(c) shows one of these visualisation systems in which we are envisioning the
data driving remotely controlled, mechanical pie-charts and graphs, creating a
spectacle for bystanders on the road to view the `data' they are themselves
producing, as well as ways for them to engage in and comment on it.

his house. Others have voiced a particular worry about
air quality. It's evident that even on a single street, the
ways in which one data set might be interpreted, and
the actions it may seem to imply, vary greatly.
What appears to be at stake in these conversations
about data then is the kind of environment the people
of Tenison Road believe they live in, and the sort of
place they wish to live in. As one of the residents put it
in an email correspondence with us:
[W]e have a range of people from those who like to
think of themselves as living in a residential back
street where traffic should not exist (even if they own
two cars) and those who delight in living in a lively
cosmopolitan city, albeit one of many commuters
according to the traffic data.
What the residents we have worked with have agreed
on and appear to form some consensus around is an
aspiration for a better quality of life, one that encapsu-
lates a sense of common (or communal) good. Data
is ­ perhaps unsurprisingly given the nature of this
project ­ framed as a means to affect change and
improve things such as traffic. As one of the more vocif-
erous residents in the community has phrased it, `the
purpose of data is action', and this action is to enable `a
better quality of life for the community'. Where some
of this consensus is complicated, however, is in how
exactly the data is understood with respect to collect-
ive action and a common good. A better quality of life
could mean a quieter street, a safer street, a street where
those living across the road are not cut off by a stream
of traffic, or a street that is in the midst of a lively
cosmopolitan city, with a busy railway station. And
each of these necessitates quite different forms of
action, collective or otherwise.
To situate the project within these different and, to
some extent, competing ideas of a common good, we
have initiated a traffic working-group made up of five
residents and one Microsoft staff member. As well as
making decisions about what exactly to monitor and
where, one of the aims of this group is to further
involve the community in data collection by, for exam-
ple, inviting residents to `collect' noise and air quality
readings on their premises, data that will, in turn, be fed
into a community repository of traffic-related data. The
hope is that a network of people may take shape `on the
ground' through sharing measuring equipment and a
collective involvement in data aggregation and analysis.
The point here is that, at least in the case of our
project, data come to be something that matters
through the increasing set of relations that are enacted
as that data is brought into being and put to use; the
mattering is in the ever thickening relations between
people and data. The `circulation and flow' of data
that Beer and Borrows (2013) write of and their refer-
ence to MacKenzie's (2005) `performative circulations'
draw attention to this kind of recursive role data can
have with social life. And yet a fluid relationality of this
sort raises further troubles for life on the street. We
might, for instance, speculate on the possibility of
someone on Tenison Road opting out of the traffic
monitoring activities ­ they might see it as a privacy
infringement or, as some have, question the efficacy of
the exercise. Whatever the case, what would it look like
to withdraw or withhold data here, where it is the
increasing density of manifold entanglements that give
the data significance for the community? The numbers
amassed using the thermal camera only begin to have
any valence when they are sizeable enough and patterns
can be found in their aggregate ­ the data works
because meaning is exercised through the undifferenti-
ated recognition of moving traffic; the patterns,
rhythms, changes, etc. are projected in and through
the sheer volume of non-descript numbers.
The work involved in the removal of a person's data
intervenes in this computational logic by giving pri-
macy to one particular set of figures rather than their
aggregates; it introduces the awkward need to identify a
unique individual in the data for them then to be
removed. To be fair, such an intervention would not
`break' the system ­ despite arguably aiming to achieve
the impossible ­ but it does disrupt how data analytics
and computation are understood as efficacious because
of their collective and impartial treatment of data.
Likewise, we see such disruptions surfacing troubles
elsewhere (because, as it has been argued, the compu-
tational work is in no way at a different level to the
context in which it is applied, but part of the same
expansive relational network; Latour et al., 2012).
That is, we find there is a disruption to the common
good associated with traffic monitoring. With someone
opting-out of the data, questions must be asked about
what constitutes `common' or `collective' in the case of
Tenison Road and how individual exceptions must be
accounted for. As with the data and the computation, a
logic of coherence through undifferentiated treatment
of each individual unravels what it means to assert col-
lective action.
To draw this thread to a close, we want to briefly
show that the mattering of data is further complicated
when it cuts across different relational assemblages.
Somewhat sceptical of our traffic monitoring activities,
one resident has voiced questions about the commu-
nity's role in producing data. She makes a distinction
between data `coming from us' and `being done to us'.
Troubled here are the separations between making data
and putting this data to work for the good of the com-
munity. In this case, the concern shows how the data-
making activities can be understood to be an equally
Taylor et al. 5
important factor in the hoped-for idea of community ­
that for the data to have some value they must in effect
be an intended product of the community.
Also salient is the desire to produce data simply as a
way of underpinning an understanding of the street in
its current form, located at a point in time, in the con-
text of change. For example, as part of our collective
deliberations on traffic, one discussion developed into
the possibility of tracking how residents' movements
and travel routines might change over the course of
the year, reflecting in some way the significant changes
afoot in the built environment. To this end, two resi-
dents have volunteered to wear location-tracking
devices and to feed their geo-temporal data into the
larger corpus of traffic data. In itself, this raises further
questions about the different qualities of individual
versus collective data and how these qualities sit in
terms of meaningful aggregation. However, here we
want to show what it might mean to read data and
consequently perform it in multiple ways.
An email received from a father and his two children
(who have regularly attended the community meetings),
responding to the traffic monitoring activities and spe-
cifically the location tracking (Figure 4), offers an indi-
cation of how such data can be associated with different
aspects of the street and thus reframed as a record of
`life' on the street. The email asks how the data might
be understood in terms of another activity we have
begun with Tenison Road, that is, building an archive
that represents a social history to the area.
Clearly, this message represents a sophistication in
thinking. It refigures the location data in quite a differ-
ent sense of movement. The data is seen as constitutive
of a `movement record' that locates the to-ings and fro-
ings on Tenison Road in wider trajectories of time and
social life.
In this refiguring, we can imagine significantly differ-
ent ways in which the data is materialised. The efficacy
of the data is not so clearly judged in terms of collective
action and communal good, but rather in how a com-
munity hopes to learn about itself and represent itself,
historically. Movement data, but also `the tools of
today', become entangled in particular moments and
those moments are located in extended lines of chan-
ging human, machine and social relations. Opting in is
less a shared conviction towards a common cause as it
is marking a juncture of such relations. The data, the
tools and the techniques are well and truly put back
into life on the street. As such, significant questions
are raised about what Beer and Burrows (2013) have
characterised as `by-product data'. They convincingly
argue that the data coming out of online
transactions and other forms of digital life constitute
a by-product that is, in its own right, a highly prized
and multifaceted commodity. We don't contest the
importance attributed to such by-product data, but
seek to show that it is not so hard to find situations
in which the modes of collection and aggregation come
to matter as much as the data itself. Overemphasising
the by-product-ness of the data belies the value its
means of production can have in social and (our spe-
cific case) street life.
Stepping back, then, the Tenison Road project still
feels very much in its early stages (despite being five
months in). As those who have conducted community
focused projects will attest, it takes a long time to build
trusting relationships, glean some sense of the issues at
stake, and figure out how to participate in these. At this
stage, what we're finding is how productive it has been
to quite literally `go to the street' not only just to dis-
cover how things are ­ how they are materialised and
matter for people ­ but also how they could be. We
find, even at the scale of the street, where the data we
are dealing with is far from `big' (in any computational
sense), data is folded into social life, and vice versa,
so that what comes to matter takes shape in and
through the myriad relations. Charts of data such as
those traffic graphs above are not in any way outside,
behind or below, but knitted into a road's community.
If anything, what's remarkable in our collective efforts
thus far is how, without question, data has become
ordinary, how they have entangled in the efforts of a
... I appreciate traffic is a major theme but we all think we don't want to
end up being the city council traffic department. . Traffic is about people
moving and people moving in the wider aspect is hugely interesting- moving
for work, moving for school, moving for fun. we'd all be very up for
tracking ourselves and seeing how our movement phenotypes differ.
I think the ideas of archive and record are more interesting and
potentially engaging in wider sphere and would be very interested how we
could use the tools of today to record life and movement. combining the
movement record within the sociological record might be able to make
traffic just that little more permanent than the more short term but ever
present gripes of urban traffic.

community to understand itself as such and decide
what else it could be. That is not to say the data does
not raise problems in this collective going-on, however.
Indeed, it does. By looking to see how the traffic data is
materialised in measurements, graphs, partitions, dis-
agreements, etc., we see how questions get raised
about its legitimacy and efficacy in both individual
and civic participation. Furthermore, such material
data practices foreground tensions about how private,
public and civic lives are constituted. The materialising
of data troubles how these categories are kept separate
and, indeed, the reasons of keeping them apart.
The very specific ways in which data come to matter,
then, are at one and the same time part and parcel of
how the relations between a road and its residents ­ a
community ­ come into being.
We are also coming to see what it means to recognise
our entanglements in those self-same troubles that our
research efforts are giving shape to. Microsoft being on
the street (indeed, part of the looming development),
and in some sense part of the community, has been
something we have kept in the frame, as it were, to
intentionally problematise the supposed rawness of
data and the imagined separation between the tech-
niques of data collection and analysis and worldly mat-
ters. The traffic records of journeys made on Tenison
Road are recorded and analysed by us and re-distrib-
uted through our own proprietary technological infra-
structures to residents and bystanders so they might
take some kind of collective action to improve the qual-
ity of life for a community. At the same time, Microsoft
stands quite literally as a monolith in this neighbour-
hood, provoking internal frictions within the commu-
nity about what exactly constitutes `better'. Yet, it is
precisely these troubles enacted through this `collective
going-on' (Verran, 2001: 159) that we hope to stay with
and productively work through in the coming months.
We see these responsive and responsible forms of tech-
noscientific practice (Barad, 2007) as a means to genu-
inely ask how data come to matter.
