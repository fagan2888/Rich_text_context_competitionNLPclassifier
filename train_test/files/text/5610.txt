Introduction
Today's global economy demands a more educated work-
force. Communities need to work together to improve 21st-
century learning and increase high-school graduation rates to
prepare more students for college and successful careers
(American Graduation Initiative, 2014). In 2009, President
Obama made a call to increase college graduation rates by
the year 2020. He laid out his desires for this initiative in the
form of innovative strategies that promote college comple-
tion. Less than half of new college students earn an associ-
ate's degree within 3 years or a bachelor's degree within 6
years (National Center for Educational Statistics, 2011). This
affects all industries, especially agriculture. This issue is
compounded when we find that there continues to be a short-
age of qualified graduates for agriculture jobs within the
United States (Goecker, Smith, Smith, & Goetz, 2010). One
reason for this shortage could be contributed to the decline in
student enrollment in colleges of agriculture and agriculture
majors (Baker, Settle, Chiarelli, & Irani, 2013).
The national high-school average freshmen graduation
rate (AFGR) is 78.2%. In the state of New Mexico, of every
100 students who enter ninth grade, only 67 will graduate
(Stillwell, Sable, & Plotts, 2011). This rate is even lower for
Hispanic students with a national AFGR of 71% and a state
of New Mexico Hispanic average of 63%. Only 32% of New
Mexico high-school students were found to possess college-
ready skills in math and science (Winograd & Sallee, 2011).
Yasar (2002) found that innovative project-based learning
increases conceptual understanding of science and promotes
positive attitudes toward learning science. The rate of stu-
dent success drops further as they continue into higher edu-
cation. Within the freshman class of 2010, only 39.4% of
New Mexico students who entered a 4-year degree program
graduated. It is secondary and post-secondary educators' job
to reach these students through innovative programs that
expose these students to the rigor of college courses and
higher education expectations early. Such programs allow
students to enter higher education better prepared and more
likely to succeed in academics and their careers (Bailey,
Hughes, & Karp, 2005).
An innovative program that can help students succeed and
increase college preparation for future graduates is the agri-
culture dual-enrollment program. Although dual enrollment/
concurrent enrollment options have been in use for many
years, agriculture-based dual-enrollment programs are not as
prevalent. Dual enrollment (sometimes referred to as concur-
rent enrollment) allows high-school students to enroll dually
in their normal high-school class and a corresponding col-
lege course (Estación, Cotner, D'Souza, Smith, & Borman,
2011). These classes can be offered as a face-to-face/online

Education Program

Abstract
There continues to be a shortage of qualified graduates for agriculture jobs within the United States. One reason for this
shortage is the decline in student enrollment in colleges of agriculture. One tool that can increase college preparation for
future graduates and help students succeed is the agriculture dual-enrollment program. Dual enrollment allows high-school
students to take courses while dually enrolled in a corresponding college course. The program was found to have a positive
impact on students taking more rigorous courses and gaining in-depth knowledge of agriculture. Teachers felt that this
program helped in establishing higher standards in coursework and in feeling satisfied about their job. It enhanced prestige
and program reputation. Dual enrollment was seen to have little to no impact on school counselors. Research focused on the
pedagogical approaches of these course offerings will benefit the creation of future high-quality dual credit courses.

hybrid where students participate in lab activities through
their high-school courses but complete assessments (test and
quizzes) online from the university instructor. This is also
referred to as blended learning (Barnett & Stamm, 2010).
This model has a high probability of success, because instruc-
tors deliver the same rigorous college content while consid-
ering the pedagogical strategies that may be better at
engaging secondary students (Karp, Bailey, Hughes, &
Fermin, 2005).
The original intent of the dual credit programs was to pro-
vide a challenging curriculum to academically prepared
high-school students (Kim, Kirby, & Bragg, 2004). As it has
evolved, this program has become a tool to help ease the
transition from high school into college (Bailey & Karp,
2003), to develop vocational skill readiness, and to reduce
time to a college degree (Burns & Lewis, 2000; Menzel,
2006). These programs have been shown to help alleviate
student boredom and "senioritis" (Klein, 2007) by allowing
for more independence in the learning process. Adelman
(2006) found that rigorous and innovative course offerings
have a significant impact on the transition from high school
into college success. As these programs have become more
common, they have become an option for both high- and
low-achieving students (Le & Frankford, 2011).
Studies by Adelman (2006) and Swanson (2008) revealed
that momentum to completion is an important factor in a stu-
dent's quest to obtain a college degree. When students to do
not obtain at least 20 credits by the end of their freshmen
year or choose not to enroll in postsecondary education right
after high school, they do not generate sufficient academic
momentum. This may eventually lead to failure to obtain a
college degree. Barnett and Hughes (2010) also found that
students who participate in dual enrollment enhance their
chances of college admission. Participating in dual enroll-
ment has the chance to create circumstances by which stu-
dents are reluctant to give up the credits earned. These
students are perhaps more likely to experience a sense of
achievement in their initial college credit classes and, there-
fore, enter post-secondary education without delay after high
school to a greater degree than non-participants.
Student participation in a dual-enrollment program has
also showed to have an impact on students'decision of a col-
lege major (Morrison, 2008), college persistence (Andrews,
2001), enhancing self-confidence, and helping students see a
connection between academic work and career success
(Medvide & Blustein, 2010). Dual enrollment has been
shown to benefit underrepresented and underachieving stu-
dents (Bailey et al., 2005), students who are enrolled in
career and technology education programs, first-generation
students (Farrell & Siefert, 2007), and both boys and girls
(Karp, Calcagno, Hughes, Jeong, & Bailey, 2007).
Although the benefits of dual enrollment have been
addressed, this research study will also help with any per-
ceived barriers to program success. Critics of dual enroll-
ment have also warned about students not participating in
these courses until they are ready. Mead (2009) cited stu-
dents who take courses too young or before they are ready
may end up becoming discouraged against any college in the
future. The study's review of literature has shown that other
concerns exist that must be addressed for a program to be
successful. These include providing strong support systems
from both secondary and university students, especially for
minority and low-income students (Barnett & Stamm, 2010);
engaging a broad student population (Edwards, Hughes, &
Weisberg, 2011); providing appropriate dual course sequenc-
ing); and modeling hybrid Career and TEcnology Education
(CTE)/academic courses that prepare students for career suc-
cess, all while maintaining high academic standards
(Adelman, 2006).
Agriculture Dual-Enrollment Program Model
The State of New Mexico School Grading Accountability
system requires that all students have taken at least one dual
credit/dual enrollment course or Advanced Placement (AP)
class to fulfill the requirements for graduation (New Mexico
Public Education Department, 2013). Those classes that
were dual-credit must have been completed successfully
with a grade of "C" or better. In the 2012-2013 school year,
79% of the students met this criterion. It was also found that
41% of the students limited themselves to only taking one
college course during their high-school career. Established
relationships with school leaders, teachers, and students can
lead to increased enrollment and success of students in dual-
enrollment programs. Offering more diversity in course
selections in the area of agriculture sciences will also help to
recruit and retain students in this high-need area.
The strategic plan of this program relies on four specific
goals for the overall program: access, accountability, afford-
ability, and student success. These courses are offered at no
cost to the school or student and are paid for by the state.
School administrators, secondary teachers, and university
faculty must be in agreement on the courses offered and in
what format they will be taught. A memo of understanding
(MOU) is kept on file with the high school, college, and the
state public education department. Teachers must be deemed
qualified by the university faculty and most often require a
minimum of a master's degree. Students must be at least a
junior in classification and in good academic standing (mini-
mum 2.5 grade point average [GPA]).
Currently, Eastern New Mexico University offers six dif-
ferent agriculture dual enrollment courses. These courses
include introduction to animal science, dairy science, intro-
duction to horticulture, introduction to metal fabrication,
rural buildings construction, and principles of engines and
power units. The 18 hr of dual-enrollment courses offered all
apply directly to majors in agricultural science. These courses
are offered in three different formats: fully online through the
university instructor, as a hybrid online/face-to-face model
with the university faculty offering online content and the
Chumbley 3
secondary teacher leading lab activities; and solely by the
high-school teacher serving as a university adjunct instruc-
tor. It has been found that programs with the hybrid course
model have a high probability of success, because instructors
deliver the same rigorous college content while considering
the pedagogical strategies that may be better at engaging sec-
ondary students.
To ensure program rigor, university instructors and high-
school teachers work together to make sure students are per-
forming their own work and put forth the required effort.
Student assessments are developed by the university instruc-
tor and are completed online through the university black-
board system. This increases student accountability and
upholds the high standards and rigor of the university.
Although strengths and benefits of the program have been
identified, areas that merit program improvement exist as
well. The dual-enrollment program, agriculture course offer-
ings, and how those courses are offered are continually
changing and adapting to best serve the needs of the students,
secondary schools, and the university. This research will
assist program leaders in addressing all of these needs and
making the necessary pedagogical, program, and course-
content changes.
Conceptual Framework
This research was guided by the Concern-Based Adoption
Model (CBAM; Hall & Hord, 2006), a conceptual frame-
work that describes, explains, and predicts probable teacher
concerns and behaviors throughout a change process. In this
case, the CBAM is applied to the change process of teachers
implementing and enrolling in the agriculture dual-enroll-
ment program. It was originally based on research that
showed that beginning teachers went through developmental
stages and expressed predictable concerns at each stage as
they learned to teach (Hall & Hord, 2001). The model was
later adapted to measure concerns teachers expressed as they
learned to use new practices and the extent to which they
actually implemented the innovations.
Today's educational systems involve numerous individu-
als responsible for facilitating change. These facilitators
need a means of assessing the needs of the individuals with
whom they work so that the most appropriate and timely
assistance can be given. Two important kinds of assessment
information CBAM provides are as follows: Concerns of the
individual about whatever new programs, products, or ideas
(innovations) are being offered, delivered, or implemented,
and individuals' knowledge of and how they use these inno-
vations. The particular focus of this study is on teachers'
stages of concern and levels of use components of this model.
Stages of Concern is a framework that describes the feel-
ings and motivations a teacher might have about a change in
curriculum and/or instructional practices at different points
in its implementation (Sweeny, 2003).At Stage 0,Awareness,
the teacher has little knowledge about or interest in the
change. At Stage 1, Informational, the teacher is interested in
learning more about the innovation. Teacher concerns at
Stage 2, Personal, involves concerns about how the innova-
tion relates to the individual. Stage 3, Management, is
reached when the teacher begins to experiment with imple-
mentation; at this point, teacher concerns intensify around
the logistics and new behaviors associated with putting the
change into practice. At Stage 4, Consequence, looks at con-
cerns about the effect of the innovation on the students. Stage
5, Collaboration, reflects teacher interest in coordinating
with other in using the innovation. Stage 6, Refocusing,
involves thinking about making major modifications in the
use of the innovation, or perhaps replacing it with something
else.
The CBAM Levels of Use focuses on general patterns of
teacher behavior as they prepare to use, begin to use, and
gain experience implementing a classroom change (Hall &
Hord, 1987, 2006). Level 0, Nonuse, reflects a state in which
the teacher has little knowledge of the change and no plans
for its implementation. Level I, Orientation, is when she or
he decides to seek more information about the change, but
has not made a decision to implement it. Level II, Preparation,
is when a teacher is actively preparing to put the change into
practice but has not actually begun to implement it in the
classroom. Level III, Mechanical, is when the teacher begins
change implementation. Level IVA, Routine, has been
reached when the teacher is comfortable with the change and
not planning to amend how it is used. Most teachers settle in
at a Routine level of use. Some, however, may actively assess
the impact of the innovation on their students and initiate
changes in the innovation or their use of it on this basis.
The CBAM is helpful not only in understanding the
change process, but also in designing change strategies. An
effective change strategy is one that helps teachers through
the stages, addressing the seven concerns more or less in
sequence (Anderson, 1997). For example, skipping the stage
of personal concern, or not giving teachers enough time to
work through it, makes successful change more difficult.
Different concerns always interact and are operationalized
by users at various development points throughout the pro-
cess. For example, the teachers' knowledge of the innova-
tion grows through the process of implementing the
innovation and may affect the raising or lowering of per-
sonal concerns.
Purpose/Objectives
Information from this study can contribute to a better under-
standing of the agriculture dual-enrollment program partici-
pants, their opinions of course offerings, and the overall
agriculture dual-enrollment program. The purpose of this
study was to understand teacher's perceptions of the New
Mexico agriculture dual-enrollment program impact on sec-
ondary school and students. Objectives that guided the
research for this study include the following:

1. Determining teachers' perceptions of the impact of
the agriculture dual-enrollment program to areas of
student success.
2. Evaluating teachers' perceptions of the impact of the
agriculture dual-enrollment program to secondary
teachers.
3. Evaluating teachers' perceptions of how the agricul-
ture dual-enrollment program's presence on a cam-
pus influences counselors.
4. Evaluating teachers' perceptions of the overall bene-
fit of the agriculture dual-enrollment program to the
secondary campus.
Method
This research used a descriptive study with open-ended
questions. These research methods sought to overcome
weaknesses of a single method (Johnson & Onwuegbuzie,
2004). After institutional review board (IRB) approval
and individual participant agreement to participate, col-
lection of data began. The sample population for this
study was all New Mexico teachers (N = 34) who were
currently offering the agriculture dual-enrollment courses
on their high-school campus out of the 90 teachers in the
state. We received a response rate of 84% (n = 28).
Comparison of early and late responders revealed no sig-
nificant (p < .05) difference. Based on this information,
the researcher felt the findings could be generalized to the
population.
Quantitative data were collected in relation to teacher's
perceptions on the cost and benefits of the dual-enrollment
program. Teachers were asked to rank the impact of the dual-
enrollment course offerings on a 1 to 5 scale (1 = strongly
disagree to 5 = strongly agree). The rating was on the dual
credit course offering in relation to areas of student success,
impacts on the high-school teacher, guidance counselor,
campus principal, and secondary school campus as a whole.
Teachers were asked open-ended questions relating to the
impacts on students, themselves as a teacher, and the school
as a whole, and their overall opinion of the agriculture dual-
enrollment program. The instrument used for this study was
the Teacher Dual Enrollment Impact Survey, developed by
the National Association for Concurrent Enrollment
Partnerships (NACEP)).
The NACEP is a professional organization with more than
200 postsecondary members across the United States. Per
NACEP guidelines, none of the "essential questions" was
deleted or modified beyond specifying course focus (in this
case, agriculture science). The validity of this instrument has
been established through testing and usage across the coun-
try within the NACEP (2011). Chief academic officers at the
institution were also given a chance to review drafts of the
survey to ensure validity from their perspective. The reliabil-
ity of the instrument resulted in a Cronbach's alpha score of
.957 post hoc evaluation.
Open-ended responses were solicited to investigate pro-
gram participants' experiences because this method allowed
researchers to understand how people "make sense of their
world" (VanMaanen, 1979). The researcher felt this was
appropriate with the CBAM as change within this model is
viewed as "a highly personal experience and involves devel-
opmental growth in feelings and skills" (Hall & Hord, 2001).
Open-ended questions were asked at the end of each Likert-
type scale. These were reviewed by the researcher and the
data analyzed using the constant comparative method (Glaser
& Strauss, 1967). This used unitizing and categorizing of the
data. The constant comparative method allowed the research-
ers to repeatedly compare the responses with previous
responses in an attempt to discover new relationships (Dye,
Schatz, Rosenberg, & Coleman, 2000). Following the unit-
izing of the data, the data were coded as part of an audit trail
to ensure confirmability (Erlandson, Harris, Skipper, &
Allen, 1993). The units of data were sorted into emergent
categories of ideas.
The researcher used measures of credibility to ensure vali-
dation of the study. Credibility relates to the level of confi-
denceintheresearcher,studydesign,andfindingstoaccurately
represent the data (Ary, Jacobs, Razavieh, & Sorensen, 2010).
Credibility was established through member checks and peer
debriefing. Participants were purposely selected for this study
based upon their experience teaching and participating in the
agriculture dual-enrollment program. Although there is poten-
tial to transfer this to other settings, the findings of this study
are limited to the participants of this study in the state of New
Mexico.
Findings
Objective 1 sought to measure the impact of the agriculture
dual-enrollment program on student success. Table 1 illus-
trates the perceived impact dual enrollment has on student
success.
Overall teachers agreed that the program had a positive
impact on student success. Teachers felt the largest impact of
the agriculture dual-enrollment program on students'success
was the learning of in-depth agriculture knowledge, staying
on campus to get college credit, and gaining an appreciation
for the challenge of college courses.
Teachers were also asked the open-ended question, "What
is the single greatest impact agriculture dual enrollment
courses have had on your students?" They responded that
involvement in the program led to more students getting
involved in more rigorous courses and different types of stu-
dents getting involved, encouraged them to stay in school,
and gave them the opportunity to start college early. Examples
of teacher comments include,
Many of these students are the first in their family to take college
course or even consider going to college. They never thought
about it until taking these courses.
Chumbley 5
This program encourages students to stay in school and take a
serious look at post-secondary education.
Several teachers saw the program as a benefit to students'
understanding of college rigor, gaining confidence in their
academic skills, allowing them more elective options, posi-
tively affecting their work ethic, helping them tie material to
real-world skills, and helping them to meet state standards
for graduation.
The second objective was to determine the perceived
benefit of the agriculture dual enrollment to secondary-
school teachers. Table 2 provides more detail on these
findings.
It was found that high-school teachers perceived the agri-
culture dual-enrollment program as a benefit to them person-
ally. They felt that this program had the greatest impact on
their ability to establish higher standards for student work,
making their job more satisfying, and helping them to feel
more connected to their discipline. It was found that teachers
felt supported by the university liaisons for the program.
Overall, they did not feel that their participation in the agri-
culture dual-enrollment program took away from other
duties, nor did it result in them being released from other
school duties.
When asked, "What is the single greatest impact the agri-
culture dual-enrollment program has had on you as the
teacher?" teachers reported a variety of impacts this program
has on them as a teacher. These included more students get-
ting involved and increased motivation as a teacher. Multiple
participants noted that it increased the rigor in their teaching
and their knowledge of new agriculture technologies. Several
teachers felt that it opened up more teaching options for
them. Two of the more experienced teachers wrote,
It has allowed me to view myself in a different way and evaluate
myself as an educator in order to improve my craft.
It has inspired me the continue learning and stay up with current
information and trends.
Objective 3 was evaluating teacher's perceptions of how
dual enrollment's presence on a campus influenced counsel-
ors. Table 3 details how teachers felt this program affects
counselor decisions.
The dual-enrollment programs'impact on school counsel-
ors was found to have the lowest average of all of the areas
of impact. They "disagreed" that the agriculture dual-enroll-
ment program had an impact on the way counselors enrolled
students in their classes or the way they presented college
options to students over other areas. These were also the
areas found to have the most variability in their responses.
The fourth objective was to assess teacher's perceptions
of the benefits of the agriculture dual-enrollment program to
the overall secondary campus. These findings are presented
in Table 4.
When determining teachers' perceptions of the dual-
enrollment program's impact on the overall secondary cam-
pus, teachers "agreed" that it had a positive impact. They felt
the strongest impacts of the program were in the areas of
enhanced prestige and reputation of the high-school campus.
The program was shown to have a positive impact on courses

being more rigorous and demonstrated to parents that their

Participants were then asked the open-ended question,
"What is the single greatest impact the agriculture dual-
enrollment program has had on your school?" A majority of
teachers felt that it increased the school and program prestige
as well as increased their school score with the state-grading
system. They felt this program established a positive relation-
ship between the high school, the agriculture program, and
the university. Teachers noted that it has led to increased par-
ent and community support. Two of our teachers who have
worked with this program for the last 2 to 3 years replied,
It gives the community a different view of our school. It gives
parents and the community ideas about what our school has to
offer our students.
This has been a selling point for many of the electives and it also
has made an impact on the student work in all classes.
The final question of the survey was an open response
asking, "What are some challenges that you have seen from
your involvement with the agriculture dual enrollment pro-
gram?" Teachers expressed that some possible challenges
they faced included getting all students interested in the
courses, aligning lab activities to match the college course
material, and finding time to develop lab activities that fit
with dual-enrollment agriculture courses, and that they
would like to have more resources from the university with
regard to technology.
Discussion
The researchers found that overall, teachers felt the agri-
culture dual-enrollment program had a positive impact on
students, teachers, and the secondary campus as a whole.
There was found to be an affirmative effect on the com-
munity's perception of the agriculture program and high-
school course rigor, similar to findings by Hughes (2010).
These findings are comparable with previous research on
the benefits of dual-enrollment courses (Bailey & Karp,
2003; Barnett & Hughes, 2010). The agriculture dual-
enrollment program leaders were validated in their goals
from the findings on their relationships with teachers and
the constructive comments made within open-ended ques-
tions. The positive impact on the campus as a whole is a
major part of change adoption within the CBAM. One of
the primary principles of this model is that the context of
the school influences the process of change. The teachers'
comments backed up these findings as well as provided
some more detail in how exactly they were affected in
these areas.
Based upon the comments, with regard to stages of con-
cern, teachers were found to be in Stage 4, Consequence.
This is when the teacher concerns focus predominantly on
the impact of the change on students in their classrooms and
on the possibilities for modifying the innovation or their use
of it to improve its effects. With regard to the framework
levels of use, teachers were found to be at Level IVA,
Routine. This involves teachers establishing a pattern of reg-
ular use and making few changes and adaptations in use of
the innovation.
Teachers did not feel that the program had a highly
positive impact on the way counselors perceived their pro-
grams or worked with their students. These findings were
counter to the findings of Medvide and Blustein (2010).
The findings of this study suggest that counselors are at
the lowest levels of concern and levels of use, awareness
and nonuse, respectively. These findings may be due to
counselors having limited contact with agriculture dual-
enrollment liaisons. By addressing the early stages of con-
cern related to awareness and informational, the researcher
can successfully reach the later stages of collaboration.
As the school counselors advance through the stages of
CBAM, it is the researchers' hope that this will lead to
them becoming advocates of the agriculture dual-enroll-
ment program.

Recommendations for Educational
Practice
Dual-enrollment program directors are encouraged to develop
and present a professional development workshop for school
counselors to increase their level of understanding and adoption
of the agriculture dual-enrollment program. We thought this
was important as the level of counselors' support was the con-
struct that had the lowest average scores from teachers. Using
the CBAM, counselors need to be better informed through
appropriate professional development before they can advance
further along the spectrums for levels of concern and levels of
use. As noted within CBAM, an organization does not change
until the individuals within it change (Hall & Hord, 2006).
It is suggested that continued professional development
should be offered focused on the training of new teachers and
experienced teachers as they possibly enter the higher stages of
concern, which involve refocusing and the consideration of
making major modifications in the use of the innovation. This
is suggested because, even with high overall opinion scores
from teachers, there is a little more than one third of the pro-
grams in the state that actually are taking advantage of this
unique program offering. This should include the development
of suggested lab activities to address some of the comments
made by participants. These trainings can help the high-school
instructors create the necessary college-like atmosphere and
assist in pedagogical strategies necessary for student success.
The best way to offer this professional development that
will reach the largest audience is by offering it at the annual
New Mexico agricultural science teachers' conference. It is
also suggested that professional development be offered for
campus administrators. In Chapter 1 of their book, Hall and
Hord (2001) list 12 principles of change within an educa-
tional CBAM, one of which is that administrator support is
vital to long-term program change and adoption.
Recommendations for Further
Research
Research focused on the pedagogical approaches of these
course offerings, both from the university instructor and the
secondary agriculture science teacher's teaching methods,
will benefit the creation of high-quality dual-credit courses.
It is suggested that researchers continue studying the benefit
of students' participation in the dual-enrollment program on
college entrance and success in higher education. Research
should also be done in relation to the reasons students take
dual-enrollment courses and the ultimate career paths of
these program participants. To develop a program that is
available to a wide range of learners, while maintaining high
standards for course accountability, more research should be
done to find how well these programs address student vari-
ances (attitude, learning style, autonomy, etc.). It is also sug-
gested that a similar study be conducted with school
administrators and school counselors to gauge their level of
use and stages of concern with the agriculture dual-enroll-
ment program.
