Objectives. Research has increasingly focused on the dynamic nature of disability and depressive symptoms in later
life. Little research, however, has modeled disability and depressive symptoms as dynamic, related processes.
Furthermore, virtually no research has considered social support as dynamic across age. Here, we investigate the
relationship between long-term patterns of disability, perceived and received social support, and depressive symptoms in
later life.
Methods. We use random coefficient (growth) models of four waves of Duke Established Populations for
Epidemiologic Studies of the Elderly data to determine whether disability, support, and depressive symptoms follow linear
trajectories across age and whether support mediates the relationship between disability and depressive symptoms.
Results. The results show that (a) trajectories of disability are strongly related to trajectories of depressive symptoms
and (b) trajectories of perceived support mediate the relationship between trajectories of disability and depressive
symptoms, whereas trajectories of received support do not.
Discussion. Disability, social support, and depressive symptoms are strongly interrelated processes in later life. Our
results are consistent with previous research in showing that perceived, rather than received, support mediates the
relationship between disability and depressive symptoms, but our results extend previous research in showing that this
mediation occurs across time.
ARE long-term patterns of disability related to long-term
patterns of depressive symptoms in later life? Can social
support be viewed as a process in later life that emerges in
response to disability, and, if so, what dimensions of social
support (if any) mediate the relationship between disability
patterns and depressive symptom patterns? In previous re-
search, disability has increasingly been conceptualized as
a chronic stressor affecting individuals persistently over time.
For example, contemporary research on the disablement
process emphasizes disability as a trajectory of experience
over time rather than a collection of static events (Verbrugge &
Jette, 1994). Paralleling this recent interest in considering
disability as a dynamic process across age, research on
depressive symptoms has increasingly discussed life course
patterns of symptomatology (e.g., Mirowsky & Ross, 1992). In
contrast, social support has yet to be considered a long-term
process at the individual level. Yet conceiving of disability as
a chronic stressor and social support as a resource that may be
mobilized in the face of such a stressor suggests that we should
consider social support as patterned in later life.
Drawing on stress theory, we argue that conceptualizing
disability, depressive symptoms, and social support as life
course processes and measuring them as long-term trajectories
can elucidate the way they interrelate over time. In treating
disability as a long-term trajectory, we offer an alternative
approach to estimating exposure to this chronic stressor and its
consequences. That is, the majority of previous research on the
deleterious effects of disability has been cross-sectional or
short-term longitudinal in design, limiting the ability to
understand the process of disability and its interrelationship
to other health and psychosocial life course processes. In this
research, we test the mediating effects of long-term patterns of
social support rather than the immediate and limited effect of
support as a static phenomenon, extending the way mediating
effects are tested for chronic stressors.
Disability, Depressive Symptoms, and Social Support
This research is guided by the conceptual outline of the stress
process (Pearlin, Menaghan, Lieberman, & Mullan, 1981),
which consists of three main components: sources, mediators,
and outcomes. This framework posits that stress may impact an
individual directly as a life course event or as a chronic strain
over time. Also central to this framework is the protective
role of mediators such as social support in limiting the impact
of stressors on psychological outcomes. Disability has been
considered a chronic stressor that is persistent and linked
to negative psychological outcomes (Turner & Noh, 1988).
Disability onset may cause a period of adjustment or disruption,
promoting feelings of worthlessness or hopelessness that may
fuel depressive symptoms (Boerner, 2004; Bruce, 2001). As
a chronic stressor, disability produces limitation in the ability to
perform social roles and may interfere with social interaction
for older individuals (Blazer, 1982; Lowenthal & Haven, 1968;
Thompson & Heller, 1990), and its psychological consequences
may endure over time. At the same time, it may threaten an
individual's ability to live alone and decrease a sense of
independence or mastery, which is known to be particularly
important for the continued psychological well-being of older
adults (Gignac, Cott, & Badley, 2000; Jang, Haley, Small, &
Mortimer, 2002; Worobey & Angel, 1990).
Much of disability research has focused on heterogeneity in
disability among the elderly and the short-term dynamic nature

of the disability experience (Beckett et al., 1996; Crimmins &
Saito, 1993; Maddox, Clark, & Steinhauser, 1994; Manton,
1988). Yet only a handful of studies have modeled disability as
individual-level trajectories (e.g., Li, Duncan, McAuley,
Harmer, & Smolkowski, 2000; Maddox & Clark, 1992;
Verbrugge, Reoma, & Gruber-Baldini, 1994). These studies
reveal a trend toward treating disability as a trajectory rather
than as a single transition or as a static circumstance, reflecting
the conceptualization of disability as a process that unfolds in
later life.
At the same time, research examining the relationship
between disability and depression/depressive symptoms has
remained relatively static in design but has established a strong
association between disability and depression/depressive
symptoms in older adults (Bruce, 2001). Whereas healthy,
functional elders have no greater risk of depression than those
at younger ages, those with functional impairment have
a significantly greater risk (Berkman et al., 1986; Roberts,
Kaplan, Shema, & Strawbridge, 1997). Research has shown
that the deleterious effects of disability on depressive symptoms
are greatest for adults over age 65 (Turner & Noh, 1988) and
that disability and poor health account for a majority of
depressive symptom incidence among older adults (Kennedy,
Kelman, & Thomas, 1990). These findings suggest that
disability is one of the most salient factors for the psychological
well-being of older adults, yet little is known about how long-
term patterning of disability relates to long-term patterning in
psychological well-being. The connection between disability
and depressive symptoms is somewhat reciprocal (Bruce, 2001;
Graney, 2000); however, although depressive symptoms have
been shown to predict disability onset (Penninx, Leveille,
Ferrucci, van Eijk, & Guralnik, 1999), others have found that
change in disability has a stronger effect on depressive
symptoms than symptoms has on disability (Ormel, Rysdyk,
Sullivan, van Sonderen, & Kempen, 2002).
Personal and social resources have received a great deal of
attention for their roles in the stress process in general and
specifically the disablement process. Among the most salient
and robust of these is social support. Social support has been
found to protect individuals from the effects of disability on
mental health (Jang et al., 2002). Multiple dimensions of social
support have been studied to determine which facets of support
provide protective effects for physical and mental health (Glass
& Maddox, 1992; Mendes de Leon, Glass, Beckett, Seeman,
Evans, & Berkman, 1999; Strawbridge, Cohen, Shema, &
Kaplan, 1996).
In this study, we focus on perceived and received support.
Perceived support has been found to be highly protective against
the effects of stress (Cohen & Wills, 1985; Kessler & McLeod,
1985; Wethington & Kessler, 1986), especially chronic stress
(Krause, 1986). In regard to disability, perceived support has
been shown to attenuate the effect of disability on depressive
symptoms (Allen, Ciambrone, & Welch, 2000; Jang et al., 2002;
Turner & Noh, 1988). The protective effects of received
support, however, remain in question. Despite the existence of
some evidence showing received support to be protective
against the effects of general stressors for older adults (Krause,
1986), received support has also been found to have no
ameliorative effects in the face of disability (Jang et al., 2002).
In addition, increased received support has been associated with
increased disability (Mendes de Leon, Gold, Glass, Kaplan, &
George, 2001; Seeman, Bruce, & McAvay, 1996). Overall, the
role of received support in the connection between disability and
depression remains relatively unclear.
Krause (1997) provides a theoretical explanation for the
conflicting findings across dimensions of social support. More
salient than a general measure of perceived support (which may
just measure relationship satisfaction), anticipated support may
be the key element for buffering the effects of a stressor on
negative psychological outcomes. Anticipated support may act
to promote feelings of autonomy (mastery) or personal problem
solving since belief in a personal network ready to react in the
face of stress may promote personal problem solving (Pierce,
Sarason, & Sarason, 1996; Wethington and Kessler, 1986). In
addition, the belief that others are ready to help when needed
may decrease the strain put on network relationships. In other
words, this belief may decrease the burden felt by support
networks and increase or maintain feelings of independence in
the individual. Conversely, received support may exacerbate
the effects of a stressor. This may be due to the fact that
personal resources may not be sufficient to cope with the
stressor, therefore increasing feelings of dependence or
powerlessness (Gore, 1979; Wheaton, 1985). In addition,
received support may lead to conflict with one's network due
to demands placed on their time and resources (Rook, 1984).
In this study, we do not attempt to disentangle the social
processes involved in support and its protective effects. Rather,
we attempt to measure the connection between disability and
depressive symptoms, and the effects of social support in this
connection, as life course processes. Thus, we extend previous
research in two ways. First, we determine the connection of
individual trajectories of disability and depression over a decade
in the lives of older adults. Most research to date either has used
cross-sectional data to examine this relationship or has used
short-term longitudinal data and cross-lagged (or related)
models. Our approach treats disability and depressive symp-
toms (well-being) as life course processes that are connected
throughout the later stage(s) of life. This approach is important
because although disability and depressive symptoms may or
may not be strongly related at any single point in time, life
course patterns in them may well be very strongly interrelated.
Second, we alternately introduce trajectories of perceived and
received social support to examine the longitudinal effects of
these protective factors. To date, no research has examined
trajectories of support in later life. In addition, most research
testing the mediating effects of support has been cross sectional
or two-wave longitudinal in design. These types of analytic
strategies cannot illustrate how the protective effects of social
support work function over long periods of time in response to
change in disability. We believe that this may account somewhat
for the conflicting results concerning both the effects of received
support and the type of protective effects perceived support offer.
We hypothesize that disability and depressive symptoms will
generally increase across age but will exhibit marked variation
across individuals, as suggested by previous research (Li et al.,
2000; Lynch & George, 2002). Furthermore, we hypothesize
that growth patterns in disability will be strongly associated
with growth patterns in depressive symptoms, meaning that
individuals with increasing trajectories of disability will also
be more likely to have increasing trajectories of depressive

symptoms, whereas individuals with decreasing trajectories
of disability will have declining trajectories of depressive symp-
toms. Finally, we hypothesize that social support trajectories
will mediate the connection between disablement and distress
over time (Turner & Noh, 1988). We expect the effect of
perceived support to be stronger than the effect of received
support, as suggested by previous literature (Krause, 1997).
METHODS
Sample and Variables
The data for this study are from the Established Populations
for Epidemiologic Studies of the Elderly (EPESE) at Duke
University. The EPESE Project is a National Institute on
AgingÂ­sponsored multicenter research program geared to
investigate the health of persons ages 65 or older at baseline.
The data include eight periods of measurement, four of which
were in-person interviews and four of which were telephone
interviews. We use only the in-person data, given that certain
key measures were not collected via the telephone interviews.
The baseline survey was conducted in 1986Â­87, with follow-up
in-person data collected in 1990, 1993, and 1996.
At baseline, the survey consisted of 4,162 respondents. Of
these, 162 were not directly interviewed and were not used
here. Of the 4,000 remaining, 124 persons did not have a valid
measure for disability status at any wave or for at least one of
the social support measures. After deleting observations
without valid data, the analytic sample consisted of 3,876
persons (6.9% missing). We include age, sex (male Â¼ 1), race
(Black Â¼ 1), baseline marital status (married Â¼ 1), and years of
formal education as covariates. Income is not included in the
analyses because (a) over 25% of the sample was missing on
the income item at baseline, (b) income is unstable in later
adulthood (whereas education is generally stable), and (c) the
causal direction of the relationship between income and health
is unclear, especially in late life. No individuals were missing
on these background variables.
We measure disability at each wave as a sum of seven
activities of daily living (ADL; Katz et al., 1963) and seven
instrumental ADL (IADL; Lawton & Brody, 1969) measures.
ADL items included whether the respondent needed help to (a)
walk across a small room, (b) bathe, (c) groom him/herself, (d)
dress him/herself, (e) eat, (f) get from a bed to a chair, and (g)
use the toilet. The IADL items included whether the respondent
could (a) use the telephone, (b) drive a car, (c) shop for
groceries, (d) prepare meals, (e) do housework, (f) take
medicine, and (g) handle money without help. The sum of
these items has been shown to be effective in capturing a full
range of disability (Spector & Fleishman, 1998).
We measure depressive symptoms at each wave using the
Center for Epidemiologic Studies--Depression (CES-D) Scale,
a well-known and highly reliable scale (Radloff, 1977;
Cronbach a across the four waves: .83, .87, .88, .89). However,
recent research suggests that certain items from the CES-D
Scale may be biased by physical impairment (Grayson,
Mackinnon, Jorm, Creasey, & Brae, 2000); nonetheless, results
obtained using a reduced version of the scale did not differ
substantially from those we present here.
We measured perceived and received social support at each
wave. The perceived support measure was the sum of two
items: one asking whether the respondents could count on at
least some family or friends for support in times of trouble and
the other asking whether the respondents had at least some
family or friends with whom they could discuss their problems.
The received support measure was the sum of 12 items
regarding whether the respondent had received support during
the last year from family or friends for a variety of issues.
Descriptive statistics for all variables used in the analyses at all
waves can be found in Table 1.
Analytic Strategy
We use random coefficients (growth) models to capture
disability, depressive symptoms, and social support trajectories
across age. In a growth model, time-specific (t) individual level
(i) measures (yit
) are viewed as a composite of the individual's
latent growth process and normally distributed random error.
If the latent growth process is assumed to be linear, then two
latent parameters define the process. Thus,

the error is 0, but the expected value for the structural aspect
of the model is a function of an individual-specific random
intercept (ai
) and slope (bi
) and time (t). This level equation
separates the time-specific measures into a structural compo-
nent (the trajectory) and random variation around the trajectory
(captured by r2). A second-level equation allows for the
inclusion of covariates to differentiate individuals' trajectories:

Ã:
In this specification, a different set of covariates may explain
latent baseline and growth factors (hence X and Z differ), and
their effects are expected to vary as well (hence c and d differ).
Unexplained between-individual variance in trajectories is
captured by sa
and sb
, thus enabling us to distinguish between
error at the individual level and heterogeneity at the between-
individual level. Thus, this model is an ideal technique for
analyzing panel data because, unlike standard regression
approaches, it is able to distinguish between change that occurs
at the individual level and heterogeneity that is attributable to
between-individual differences.
Our first model estimates trajectories of disability and
depressive symptoms. Included in the X and Z covariate vectors
for the depressive symptom trajectory are the random effects
from the disability trajectory. Our second and third models
include a trajectory of social support (received and perceived
support, respectively) as a mediator between disability and
depressive symptom trajectories. Thus, these models include an
influence of the random effects of disability on the random
effects for support and depressive symptoms, and the de-
pressive symptom trajectory also includes the random effects
for the support trajectories as predictors. Figure 1 provides
a conceptual diagram of the model.
Over the course of the study, a number of individuals died or
otherwise left the sample. Some of those who attritted at earlier
waves returned at later waves. In order to compensate for the
missing data without deleting observations with any missing
data, we estimated our models using a full-information maxi-
mum likelihood estimator within a structural equation modeling
framework (Mplus; Muthen and Muthen, 1998; Willett and
Sayer, 1994).
RESULTS
Table 2 shows the results of the random effects models with
trajectories of disability predicting trajectories of depressive
symptoms. The top portion of the table shows these effects
along with the effects of the background variables, and the
bottom portion of the table shows the explained variance for
each of the time-specific measures.
Regarding overall model fit, we report two measures: the
model v2 and the root mean squared error of approximation
(RMSEA). For a well-fitting model, the v2 should be
nonsignificant (indicating little discrepancy between the

observed and predicted data)--although larger sample sizes
tend to produce significant v2 values despite adequate fit--and
the RMSEA should be ,.1 (and preferably ,.05; Bollen,
1989). In the first model, we observe a significant v2 but an
RMSEA of .042, indicating good fit.
In the second level of the model, age has a positive effect on
latent baseline disability, as is expected. Men and married
persons evidence slightly less baseline disability than women
and the unmarried, whereas Blacks show slightly more baseline
disability than Whites, although none of these differences are
significant. Years of education has a strong negative effect on
baseline disability. In terms of the latent growth rates (the
slope) for disability, age increases the rate of growth in
disability symptoms, indicating either nonlinear growth in
disability across age or cohort differences in the rate of growth
in disability. Men have significantly slower growth in disability
across age (dÂ¼Ã.03, p , .05), as do married persons (dÂ¼Ã.03,
p , .1). Blacks are predicted to have higher growth rates in
disability, although the coefficient for Black is not significant.
Finally, education reduces the growth rate significantly (d Â¼
Ã.01, p , .001). The covariates as a whole explain 11% of the
variance in latent baseline disability and 17% of the latent
growth in disability across the survey period, and the explained
variances for each observed measure of disability are quite high
(ranging from 73% at Time 2 to 80% at Time 3), indicating
a good fit of the linear growth specification.
The depressive symptom portion of the model shows that age
has a nonsignificant effect on baseline depressive symptoms,
controlling for other factors. Males have significantly fewer
depressive symptoms at baseline, as do married persons. Blacks
have fewer symptoms at baseline as well, although the race
difference is not significant. Education has a strong negative
effect. Finally, latent baseline disability has a significant and
strong effect on baseline depressive symptoms (c Â¼ .22, p ,
.001). This coefficient implies that a 1-unit increase in baseline
level of disability translates into a .22-symptom difference in
baseline symptoms.
Relatively few variables affect the growth rate in depressive
symptoms. Only age, marital status, and disability growth have
an effect, with age's effect being negative (indicating either
a slowing of the rate of increase in depressive symptoms across
age or cohort differences in the rate of symptom increase) and
marital status and disability growth both increasing the growth
rate in symptoms. The effect of marriage is fairly large but is
overshadowed by the effect of disability (d Â¼ .14, p , .001).
The coefficient for disability growth implies that a 1-unit
increase in the growth rate for disability yields a .14-unit
increase in the growth rate for depressive symptoms. As
a whole, the covariates (including the latent trajectory
parameters for disability) explain 19% of the variance in latent
baseline depressive symptoms and 18% of the variance in latent
growth in symptoms, and the explained variance in the
observed measures is quite large (ranging from 44% at Time
1 to 51% at Time 2). Disability trajectories account for a large
proportion of this explained variance; without disability
trajectories, the covariates alone explain 10% and 3% of the
variance in latent baseline symptoms and growth in symptoms,
respectively (results not reported in table).
Tables 3 and 4 show the results of adding social support
trajectories as mediators of the disabilityÂ­depressive symptom
relationship. Table 3 contains the results of including
trajectories of received support, whereas Table 4 contains the
results of including trajectories of perceived support. In both
tables, the coefficients for predicting disability trajectories
change very little over those results presented in Table 2. This
is to be expected because we have not added any additional
information to help explain disability patterns.
In terms of received support trajectories, men report
receiving less support at baseline, and education also reduces
received baseline support. All other covariates have a positive
effect. Blacks report receiving more support, as do married
persons. Finally, latent baseline disability has a strong positive
effect on baseline received support, as may be expected: Those
who need more support tend to receive it. In terms of the

growth rate in support, men have slightly greater growth rates
in received support, whereas married persons report slightly
lower growth rates in received support than unmarried persons.
Finally, disability growth has a significant and strong effect on
growth in received support. Overall, 14% of the variance in
latent baseline received support is explained by the covariates,
whereas 16% of the variance in growth in received support is
explained. Furthermore, the explained variance for received
support is fairly high--ranging from 38% at Time 1 to 51% at
Time 4--indicating good fit of the linear specification for
growth in support.
For the sake of brevity, we do not discuss the effects of all
background covariates on depressive symptom trajectories;
rather, we concentrate only on the effects of disability and
received support. Received support has positive but non-
significant effects on both latent baseline depressive symptoms
(c Â¼ .01, p . .05) and growth in depressive symptoms (d Â¼ .08,
p . .05), indicating that received support has little to do with
depressive symptom trajectories. The effect of support also has
relatively little effect on reducing the relationship between
disability and depressive symptom trajectories. The effect of

DISABILITY, SUPPORT, AND DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOM TRAJECTORIES S243
toms is .21 and remains significant (p , .001), and the effect of
disability growth on depressive symptom growth also remains
large and significant (d Â¼ .13, p , .001). Thus, compared with
the results in the previous table, the addition of received support
only slightly decreases the effect of disability trajectories on
depressive symptom trajectories. More to the point, the
explained variance in both of the latent parameters for
depressive symptom trajectories is unaffected.
The results for perceived support presented in Table 4 reveal
a different story. Latent baseline disability has a negative effect
on latent baseline perceived support (c Â¼Ã.03, p , .001), and
latent disability growth has a negative effect on latent growth in
perceived support (dÂ¼Ã.05, p , .001). Latent baseline perceived
support has a strong negative effect on baseline depressive
symptoms (c Â¼ Ã.99, p , .001), and the effect of growth in
perceived support on depressive symptom growth is negative and
even stronger (d Â¼Ã1.70, p , .001). In this model, the direct
effect of baseline disability on baseline depressive symptoms
remains significant (cÂ¼.18, p , .001) but is reduced by 18% (1Ã
[.18/.22]). However, the effect of disability growth is reduced to
nonsignificance. These results indicate that trajectories of
perceived support completely mediate the effect of disability
growth on depressive symptom growth, whereas the negative
relationship between disability trajectories and perceived support
trajectories indicates that individuals may feel that support is
inadequate to help them cope with their levels of disability.
The increase in the explained variance for depressive
symptoms from the first model (disability and depressive
symptoms only) to the model with received support included
tells a similar story. When latent baseline perceived support is
included (see Table 4), the explained variance for latent
baseline depressive symptoms increases from .19 to .35 (an
increase of 84%). In terms of latent symptom growth, the
explained variance increases from 19% to 51% (an increase
of 168%). These results also support the perspective that
perceived support accounts for variation in trajectories of
depressive symptoms, whereas the results from Table 3 indicate
that received support does not.
DISCUSSION
To date, the gerontologic literature has often discussed
disability and depressive symptomatology as life course pro-
cesses in later life; our theories and hypotheses regarding them
have increasingly emphasized them as such, but our research
designs and analyses have remained effectively cross-sectional.
Furthermore, regarding social support, literature conceptualizing
support as a life course process, especially in later life, has been
virtually nonexistent. Yet, just as stress can be conceptualized as
a process--indeed, the notion of chronic stress implies a pro-
cess--social support can be considered a life course process that
emerges/develops in response to stress processes such as growth
in disability in later life. In this research, we have explicitly
modeled stress, depressive symptoms, and social support as
processes in later life. Our goal has been to examine the
relationship between long-term patterns of disability at the
individual level--a type of chronic stressor--and long-term
patterns of one of its psychological consequences--depressive
symptoms. In addition, we considered long-term patterns of
social support, both received/actual support and perceived
availability of support, as potential temporal--and not simply
static--mediators of this relationship.
The results strongly support the conceptualization of
disability, depressive symptoms, and support as linear pro-
cesses in later life. Specifically, a considerable amount of the
variance in the observed individual-level time-specific measures
was explained via a linear growth specification for each
(nonlinear specifications were also attempted but produced
similar results). Furthermore, a considerable amount of vari-
ability in trajectories of disability, support, and symptoms was
evident across the sample. The first model showed a strong
relationship between trajectories of disability and trajectories of
depressive symptoms, such that persons with increasing
trajectories of disability tend to have increasing trajectories
of depressive symptoms. In general, these results are fairly
consistent with previous research showing a relationship
between disability and depression or depressive symptoms
(Berkman et al., 1986; Bruce, 2001; Roberts et al., 1997).
However, our results extend previous research by demonstrating
that long-term patterns of disability are related to long-term
patterns of depressive symptoms at the individual level, a finding
that is important to advancing a life course understanding of the
interrelationship between late-life health processes.
Subsequent models including trajectories of received and
perceived support showed that trajectories of perceived support,
but not received support, tend to match trajectories of disability
and provide a buffer against the effect of disability on depressive
symptoms. The salience of perceived support as a stress
mediator is not a new finding (Cohen & Wills, 1985; Kessler
& McLeod, 1985). However, this work contributes to existing
literature in at least two ways. First, this research is the first
to demonstrate that this mediation extends over time and not
simply at one point in time. In fact, this is the first research, to
our knowledge, that considers treating social support as
a process. Much of the previous research has examined the
relationship between social support and depressive symptoms
using cross-sectional data or an inherently cross-sectional model
on short-term longitudinal data (e.g., by regressing depressive
symptoms on prior measures of support). Yet, to the extent that
chronic stressors such as disability (or repeated occurrences of
life event stressors) (Lynch & George, 2002) can be viewed as
life course processes, we can expect social support to evolve in
response as well, and the results indicate they do.
Our results indicate that trajectories of received support do
not buffer the effect of disability on depressive symptoms but
that perceived support completely mediates the relationship
between growth in disability and growth in symptoms. This
somewhat supports the work of Krause (1997) on anticipated
and received support. Perceived support had the expected
effect, but received support did not. Although individuals in our
sample were more likely to report higher levels of received
support as their disability levels increased (Mendes de Leon
et al., 2001; Seeman et al., 1996), received support did not
exacerbate the effects of disability on depressive symptoms, as
suggested by Krause (1997).
An important finding regarding perceived social support
was that the effect of latent baseline disability on baseline
depressive symptoms remained significant, while the effect of
growth in disability on growth in depressive symptoms was
eliminated by the inclusion of perceived support. This finding
TAYLOR AND LYNCH
S244
underscores the importance of using a truly longitudinal
method for modeling and understanding life course processes.
Our finding shows that the relationship between growth in
disability and growth in depressive symptoms is mediated by
growth in perceived social support, whereas baseline disabil-
ity's effect on baseline depressive symptoms is not mediated by
baseline perceived support. Using a cross-sectional design or
analysis therefore would not fully reveal the importance of
social support across the life course.
Despite the significance of the findings, one of the greatest
limitations of these analyses is that, even with our multiwave
longitudinal design, direction of causality cannot be conclu-
sively established between disability, social support, and
depressive symptoms. An important feature of growth model-
ing is that the method is more consistent with the concept of life
course processes than traditional cross-sectional or similar
methods. However, a limitation is that causal direction cannot
be established. Indeed, this is always a problem regardless of
the method used, but it is also true with growth models, because
the multiple measures are reduced to (often) two parameters per
individual so that the temporal priority of one set of measures
versus another is lost. We believe, however, that disability most
likely produces the need for social support and therefore
increases the actual receipt of support while perhaps simulta-
neously reducing the actual perception of support. Nonetheless,
although the perception of support may be reduced in the face
of disability, it may still be sufficient (as our results indicate) to
reduce depressive symptoms. Of course, we cannot rule out the
possibility that those with the highest levels of depressive
symptoms perceive the least support--the so-called ``contam-
ination hypothesis'' (George, Blazer, Hughes, & Fowler, 1989).
Although previous research has demonstrated less support for
this hypothesis than our causation hypothesis, even with long-
term longitudinal data, the direction of causality cannot be fully
ascertained. Our conclusion is that high levels of, and rapid
growth in, disability may produce feelings that an individual's
support is inadequate for handling disability but may nonethe-
less be sufficient to mediate the effect of disability growth on
depressive symptom growth.
