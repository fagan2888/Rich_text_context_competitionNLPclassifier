Background The anatomy of carotid stenosis may influence
the outcome of endovascular treatment or carotid endarterec-
tomy. Whether anatomy favors one treatment over the other
in terms of safety or efficacy has not been investigated in
randomized trials.
Methods In 414 patients with mostly symptomatic carotid
stenosis randomized to endovascular treatment (angioplasty
or stenting; n = 213) or carotid endarterectomy (n = 211) in the
Carotid and Vertebral Artery Transluminal Angioplasty Study
(CAVATAS), the degree and length of stenosis and plaque
surface irregularity were assessed on baseline intraarterial
angiography. Outcome measures were stroke or death occur-
ring between randomization and 30 days after treatment, and
ipsilateral stroke and restenosis 50% during follow-up.
Results Carotid stenosis longer than 0·65 times the common
carotid artery diameter was associated with increased risk
of peri-procedural stroke or death after both endovascular
treatment [odds ratio 2·79 (1·17­6·65), P = 0·02] and carotid
endarterectomy [2·43 (1·03­5·73), P = 0·04], and with increased
long-term risk of restenosis in endovascular treatment [hazard
ratio 1·68 (1·12­2·53), P = 0·01]. The excess in restenosis after
endovascular treatment compared with carotid endarterec-
tomy was significantly greater in patients with long stenosis
than with short stenosis at baseline (interaction P = 0·003).
Results remained significant after multivariate adjustment. No
associations were found for degree of stenosis and plaque
surface.
Conclusions Increasing stenosis length is an independent risk
factor for peri-procedural stroke or death in endovascular treat-
ment and carotid endarterectomy, without favoring one treat-
ment over the other. However, the excess restenosis rate after
endovascular treatment compared with carotid endarterec-
tomy increases with longer stenosis at baseline. Stenosis length
merits further investigation in carotid revascularisation trials.

Introduction
Endovascular treatment (EVT) of carotid stenosis by percutane-
ous transluminal balloon angioplasty or insertion of a stent has
emerged as an alternative to carotid endarterectomy (CEA). Ran-
domized controlled trials have shown an increased risk of peri-
procedural stroke associated with EVT compared with CEA, but
the excess in stroke risk was largely restricted to patients above the
age of 70 (1,2).Besides demographic and clinical factors,anatomi-
cal features of carotid stenosis may also contribute to differences
in treatment risk. In previous research, plaque ulceration was
associated with peri-procedural complications in CEA, but not in
EVT (3­6). The length of stenosis has been identified as a predic-
tor of peri-procedural stroke in EVT (3,6,7). However, neither
plaque irregularity nor length of stenosis has been included in
subgroup analyses of randomized trials comparing EVT versus
CEA, and their impact on long-term outcome remains unknown.
Aims
We therefore analyzed all intraarterial carotid angiographies
obtained at baseline in the Carotid and Vertebral Artery Translu-
minal Angioplasty Study (CAVATAS) to answer the following
questions: (1) Do degree of carotid stenosis, length of stenosis, or
irregular plaque surface predict procedural risks of EVT or CEA?;
(2) Do these factors have an impact on the long-term durability of
EVT or CEA in terms of recurrent ipsilateral stroke or carotid
restenosis?; and (3) Is one treatment superior to the other in terms
of safety or efficacy depending on anatomy of stenosis?
Methods
Patients, randomization, treatment, and follow-up
CAVATAS was a group of randomized, open, multicenter trials
designed to evaluate risks and benefits of EVT in carotid and
vertebral artery disease. In the main part of CAVATAS, 504

patients with predominantly symptomatic moderate or severe
carotid stenosis who were suitable for either procedure were
randomized in a 1:1 ratio to EVT or CEA at 22 academic and
nonacademic centers in Europe, Australia, and Canada between
March 1992 and July 1997. Randomization was done by computer
at the Clinical Trial Service Unit in Oxford, UK, with a minimi-
zation algorithm which took account of center and time from last
symptoms. Trial methodology and initial results, as well as out-
comes up to 11 years after treatment, have been previously
reported (8­10). In the initial phase of the study, EVT was per-
formed by balloon angioplasty alone. Stents became available
during the trial and were used in 26% of patients in the EVT
group, at the discretion of collaborating interventionists.
Approved cerebral protection devices were not available at the
time of recruitment in CAVATAS. Collaborating surgeons used
their preferred techniques for endarterectomy, either with
primary closure of the arteriotomy or closure with surgical
patches. Patients in CAVATAS were examined by an independent
neurologist at baseline and followed up 1, 6, and 12 months after
treatment and yearly thereafter. There was no predefined length of
follow-up, but centers were encouraged to follow up patients for
as long as the center and individual patients were willing to do so.
Follow-up ended in November 2007, 10 years after the last patient
had been recruited. For the present analysis, we included patients
randomized to EVT or CEA with available digital subtraction
angiography (DSA) at baseline. CAVATAS is a registered trial
(ISRCTN01425573).
Carotid imaging at baseline and during follow-up
Selective DSA in at least two views was specified as the carotid
imaging method of choice before randomization, in order to
establish the suitability of the lesion for either EVT or CEA.
Alternatively, centers were allowed to randomize patients on the
basis of consistent findings in noninvasive magnetic resonance or
computed tomography-based angiography (MRA and CTA) and
carotid duplex ultrasound (CDU). Due to limited image resolu-
tion of films obtained from MRA and CTA at the time of recruit-
ment into CAVATAS, only patients examined with DSA were
included in the present analysis.
CDU of the carotid arteries was carried out one-year after
treatment as a minimum and at yearly intervals thereafter. In
many centers, additional examinations were performed one- and
six-months after treatment, if possible. If cerebrovascular events
occurred during follow-up, additional CDU and angiography
(MRA, CTA, or DSA) was performed at the discretion of the local
investigators. As previously described, degree of stenosis on CDU
was determined by one investigator (L. H. B.) who was blinded to
treatment, based on standardized flow velocity criteria at the
central study office (9), and expressed equivalent to NASCET
angiography measures (11).
Anatomical parameters of carotid stenosis
A single, experienced investigator (L. H. B.) measured all DSA
films obtained at baseline. The following parameters were
assessed: Degree of stenosis was calculated according to the method
used in NASCET (11). Length of stenosis was measured in two
ways (Fig. 1): Length 1 was defined as the distance between the
proximal and the distal shoulder of the stenotic plaque, in the
projection that best elongated the stenosis (12). Length 2 was
defined as the distance between the proximal and distal points
where the degree of stenosis decreased to 80% of its maximum,
regardless of whether definite lesion shoulders were present or
not. To account for differences in scaling of DSA films, lengths 1
and 2 were expressed as a fraction of the diameter of the distal
common carotid artery (CCA), which was measured. The dis-
tance between measurement of the CCA reference diameter and
carotid bifurcation had to equate at least 2·5 times the CCA diam-
eter, because previous research has shown that the diameter of the
CCA stabilizes proximal to this point (13). We evaluated two
definitions of length of stenosis: first, using length 1 whenever two
definite lesion shoulders were present, and using length 2 if the
plaque did not have two definite shoulders; and second, using
always length 2. Plaque surface was classified as irregular or
smooth (14). Irregular surface comprised ulceration (seen in
profile as a crater extending from the lumen into a stenotic
plaque, or on face view as a double density), or plaques with
surface irregularity or presence of multiple small craters not clas-
sifying as ulcer niches (15).
Fig. 1 Measurement of length of stenosis. Stenosis length 1 (red line): distance between the two definite shoulders of the lesion. Stenosis length 2 (blue
line): distance between the proximal and distal points where the degree of stenosis decreases to 80% of its maximum. Stenosis length is expressed as
a fraction of the diameter (D) of the undiseased CCA. Examples a­c show length 1 and length 2 in different situations. (a) two definite lesion shoulders
are present ­ length 1 and length 2 are similar; (b) two definite lesion shoulders are present but lesion proximally extends to carotid bifurcation ­ length
1 > length 2; (c) no definite lesions shoulders ­ only measurement of length 2 is possible. CCA, common carotid artery; ICA, internal carotid artery; ECA,

Outcome events
The safety end-point for the present analysis was death or any
stroke causing neurological deficit lasting more than seven-days
occurring between randomization and 30 days after treatment.
The efficacy end-points were ipsilateral stroke lasting >seven-days
occurring more than 30 days after treatment, and any residual or
recurrent stenosis 50% or occlusion of the treated carotid artery
on ultrasound during follow-up (termed restenosis). Outcome
events were independently adjudicated in the central trial office
by two investigators (J. E., LHB), blinded to the treatment. In case
of disagreement, the principal investigator (M. M. B.) made the
final adjudication.
Statistical analysis
Patients were compared by the randomly allocated treatment
(intention to treat). Receiver operator curves (ROC) were used to
select the definition of length of stenosis (see above) which best
predicted the safety end-point, and to define threshold values to
dichotomize length and degree of stenosis for further analysis, at
the point where sensitivity equalled specificity.
Within each treatment arm, the associations of degree and
length of stenosis and plaque irregularity with the safety end-
point were assessed on the univariate level with chi-square statis-
tics; and on the multivariate level using binary logistic regression
models. Cox regression was used to investigate the association
between the three anatomical parameters and recurrent ipsilateral
stroke. Impact on restenosis was tested using interval-censored
generalized nonlinear models, as detailed previously (9). Formal
testing for subgroup-treatment effect interactions was performed
for each anatomical parameter and each end-point, by including
a multiplicative interaction term in the binary logistic regression
and the Cox regression models. Significant associations on the
univariate level and interactions were adjusted for all anatomical
parameters as well as age, sex, and baseline vascular risk factors
(diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, smoking, history
of peripheral artery, and coronary heart disease). Effects on the
safety end-point are expressed by odds ratios (OR), and effects on
efficacy end-points are expressed by hazard ratios (HR). Provided
in brackets are 95% confidence intervals of estimates.

Results
Imaging of carotid stenosis before randomization was done by
DSA in 435 of all 504 patients randomized in CAVATAS (86%;
EVT: 216/251, CEA: 217/253), MRA and CTA in 54 patients
(11%) and 8 patients (2%), respectively, and ultrasound alone in
8 patients (2%). In one patient in the CEA arm, no information
on the type of carotid imaging was available. In nine patients
(EVT: n = 3, CEA: n = 6) examined by DSA, films were unavail-
able. The remaining 424 patients (EVT: n = 213, CEA: n = 211)
with available DSA films were included in the analysis (Fig. 2).

The two groups did not differ in age, sex distribution, proportion
of patients with symptomatic stenosis (96%), presence of vascular
risk factors, degree of stenosis, length of stenosis by either of the
two definitions, or presence of an irregular plaque surface
(Table 1). In the EVT group, 162 patients were treated with
balloon angioplasty alone while stents were inserted in 51
patients.
There was no difference in the occurrence of death or stroke
lasting >seven-days between randomization and 30 days after
treatment between the EVT arm (23/213 patients, 10·8%: 13 non-
fatal strokes, 9 fatal strokes, 1 nonstroke death) and the CEA arm
(24/211 patients, 11·4%: 20 nonfatal strokes, 4 nonstroke deaths),
OR 0·94 (0·52­1·72). In the entire study population, length of
carotid stenosis using either definition significantly predicted the
safety end-point [definition 1, i.e., using length 1 where possible
and otherwise length 2: area under the ROC 0·62 (0·54­70),
P = 0·008; definition 2, i.e., always using length 2: area under the
ROC 0·67 (0·59­0·74), P < 0·001]. Definition 2 (always using
length 2) was selected for further analysis. There was a continuous
increase in risk of peri-procedural stroke or death across quartiles
of increasing length of stenosis (by definition 2) in both arms, as
shown in Fig. 3. The ideal threshold length for prediction of the
safety end-point equalled 0·65 times the CCA diameter, with a
sensitivity and specificity of 62%. For further analysis, length 2
was dichotomized at this value. Degree of carotid stenosis did not
predict peri-procedural stroke or death (AUC 0·532, 95% CI
0·445­0·619, P = 0·469), and patients were therefore separated at
the median value (81·25% stenosis) for further analysis.
In patients with stenosis longer than the threshold length, the
safety end-point occurred significantly more often than in
patients with shorter stenosis, both in the EVT arm (17·1% vs.
6·9%, unadjusted OR 2·79 [1·17­6·65], P = 0·02) and in the CEA
arm [16·5% versus 7·5%, unadjusted OR 2·43 (1·03­5·73),
P = 0·04; Table 2]. Associations remained significant after adjust-
ment for degree of stenosis, plaque irregularity, age, gender, and
vascular risk factors [EVT: adjusted OR 3·10 (1·19­8·13),
P = 0·02; CEA: adjusted OR 2·67 (1·07­6·68), P = 0·04]. There
were no significant associations between degree of stenosis or
surface irregularity with the safety end-point in both arms. There
was no evidence that either treatment was safer than the other in
the different anatomical subgroups (Fig. 4).
The 203 patients in the EVT arm and 207 patients in the CEA
arm who were still alive 30 days after treatment were followed up
clinically for a median duration of 5·0 years [interquartile range
(IQR): EVT 3·0­6·6, CEA 2·9­6·0]. Nonperioperative ipsilateral
strokes occurred in equal proportions of patients in both treat-
ment arms [HR 1·07, (0·50­2·28)] with cumulative 5-year inci-
dences of 6·9% each [standard error (SE): EVT 2·1% and CEA
2·0%]. Neither degree nor length of stenosis nor plaque irregu-
larity was associated with nonperioperative ipsilateral stroke
during follow-up in either treatment arm (Table 2), and there
were no significant subgroup-treatment effect interactions
(Fig. 4).
Ultrasound follow-up was performed in 183 patients in the
EVT arm and 176 patients in the CEA arm, for a median duration
of 3·9 (IQR 1·8­5·3) and 4·3 (IQR 1·4­5·6) years, respectively.
Restenosis 50% occurred significantly more often among
patients treated endovascularly (99 patients) than those having
undergone CEA (49 patients), with cumulative 5-year incidences
of 60·1% (SE 4·3%) and 31·4% (SE 4·0%), respectively, and an
overall HR of 2·63 (1·87­3·73; P < 0·001). In the EVT arm,
patients with long baseline stenosis had a higher risk of restenosis
than those with short stenosis [cumulative 5-year incidences
70·1% versus 53·8%, unadjusted HR 1·68 (1·12­2·53), P = 0·01;
adjusted HR 1·65 (1·08­2·51), P = 0·02, Table 2]. In contrast,
baseline length of stenosis was not associated with restenosis in
the CEA arm. There was a significant interaction between length
of stenosis, treatment, and restenosis (adjusted and unadjusted

P = 0·003), showing that the excess in restenosis after EVT com-
pared with CEA was significantly greater among patients with
long carotid stenosis than with short carotid stenosis at baseline
(Figs 4 and 5).
As the derivation of the cut-off value for length of stenosis was
based on outcome (peri-procedural stroke or death), we per-
formed a sensitivity analysis dichotomizing length of stenosis (by
definition 2) at the median value of the entire study population,
which corresponded to 0·56 times the CCA diameter. Longer
stenosis remained significantly associated with an increased risk
of peri-procedural stroke or death in the EVT arm [short stenosis
6/110 patients, long stenosis 17/103 patients, OR 3·43 (1·29­9·07),
P = 0·01], and by trend in the CEA arm [short stenosis 7/102
patients, long stenosis 17/109 patients, OR 2·51 (0·99­6·33),
P = 0·05]. Also, the interaction between length of stenosis and
treatment effect on restenosis remained significant.
Discussion
The analysis of anatomical parameters of carotid stenosis and risk
of treatment in CAVATAS yielded the following key findings: first,
greater length of stenosis increased the risk for peri-procedural
stroke or death in both EVT and CEA, to a similar degree; second,
greater length of stenosis increased the risk for restenosis after

EVT but was not associated with an increase in recurrent ipsilat-
eral stroke; and (3) the degree of stenosis and plaque surface did
not significantly alter treatment safety or efficacy of EVT or CEA.
CAVATAS was the first large-scale randomized trial comparing
safety and efficacy of EVT versus CEA for patients with predomi-
nantly symptomatic carotid stenosis. The study protocol defined
DSA as the method of choice for baseline carotid imaging, allow-
ing for a detailed analysis of anatomical aspects of carotid stenosis
prior to randomization. In more recent trials, only patients
undergoing endovascular treatment had DSA examination of
carotid stenosis as part of the stent procedure. Furthermore,
follow-up was performed for up to 11 years after treatment and
included regular examination by carotid ultrasound for the first
time in a large trial of symptomatic carotid stenosis. This enabled
us to investigate the relationship between anatomical parameters
of carotid stenosis and long-term durability of EVT and CEA in
terms of prevention of recurrent stroke and restenosis.
The length of stenosis was first identified as a risk factor in
coronary artery stenting (12). Subsequently, two open cohort
studies identified length of stenosis as a predictor of stroke in
carotid artery stenting (3,7). In an analysis of preprocedural DSA
in the stenting arm of the Endarterectomy Versus Angioplasty in
Patients with Symptomatic Severe Carotid Stenosis trial, the asso-
ciation between length of stenosis, dichotomized at 10 mm, and
risk of peri-procedural death or stroke was not significant (6).
Length of stenosis in these studies was defined as the distance
between the proximal and the distal shoulder of the atheromatous
lesion. In the present study, we propose a new definition for
measuring length of stenosis which is independent from the pres-
ence of definite lesion shoulders and which might be better suited
to assess lesion length in the carotid bifurcation. In addition, we
did an ROC analysis to determine the ideal threshold length of
stenosis to predict complications. Our findings confirmed length
of stenosis as a strong and independent risk factor for peri-
procedural stroke or death in EVT. Patients with long stenosis
may be at increased risk of embolism during EVT because of an
increased likelihood of dislodging atherosclerotic debris or
thrombus with larger plaque surface.
To date, research on anatomical risk factors in endarterectomy
has focused on degree of carotid stenosis and plaque irregularity
but did not investigate the significance of length of stenosis. The
present study demonstrated for the first time that increasing
length of stenosis leads to a very similar increase in treatment risk
in CEA as in EVT. The mechanism for this increase in surgical risk
remains unclear; it is conceivable that the larger carotid incision
required in patients with long stenosis leads to increased activa-
tion of the coagulation system and thus a higher risk for thrombo-
embolic stroke. As the risk increase for peri-procedural stroke or
death is very similar in both treatments, length of stenosis is
unlikely to help decide between the endovascular and the surgical
approach in a patient in whom invasive revascularization is
deemed necessary. However, length of stenosis ­ unlike degree of
stenosis ­ appears to be a strong determinant of treatment risk and
may thus help decide between invasive and conservative treatment
in patients in whom the benefit of revascularization is uncertain.
This question needs to be investigated in trials comparing conser-
vative treatment versus revascularization by stenting or surgery in
patients with low-to-intermediate risk carotid stenosis,such as the
2nd European Carotid Surgery Trial (ECST-2).
We previously reported a higher long-term risk of restenosis
after EVT compared with CEA in CAVATAS (9). In the present
analysis, increased length of stenosis at baseline independently
predicted residual or recurrent carotid stenosis after EVT. A pos-
sible explanation for this finding is that mechanisms leading to
residual or recurrent stenosis in EVT, such as elastic recoil of the
artery wall, wall hematoma following injury of the intima, and
neointimal hyperplasia, may be more pronounced if a longer
lesion is treated endovascularly. In contrast, length of stenosis did
not predict restenosis in patients treated with CEA. Length of
stenosis thus helps identify patients at increased risk of restenosis
with EVT who may benefit from prolonged ultrasound follow-up.
However, the results warrant confirmation in modern trials using
primary carotid stenting, where rates of severe restenosis have
been reported to be much lower than in CAVATAS (16,17).
Our findings that the degree of stenosis was not associated with
procedural risk of EVT or CEA were in accordance with previous
case series and clinical trials (3­7,18). A meta-analysis of CEA
trials identified plaque irregularity as an independent risk factor
for surgical complications (5), a finding which we could not
confirm.
Our study has important limitations. First, the majority of
patients in the EVT arm were treated with balloon angioplasty
alone, without use of stents. Since the time of recruitment in
CAVATAS, primary stenting has replaced balloon angioplasty as
the endovascular treatment technique of choice, potentially lim-
iting the external validity of our findings. The limited number of
patients in whom stents were inserted in CAVATAS (n = 51 were
included in the present analysis) did not allow for investigation of
the influence of the assessed anatomical parameters in carotid
artery stenting. However, the observed association of length of
stenosis and risk of EVT was consistent with findings from open
registries of primary stenting. Our results need confirmation in
recent and ongoing trials of carotid revascularization including
carotid stenting. Second, the study may have been underpowered
to detect interactions of stenosis morphology with treatment
regarding recurrent stroke. Third, a single rater reviewed all films,
and we therefore cannot provide data on interrater reliability of
the measurements. However, because determination of length of
stenosis is based on objective measurement, we would expect the
results to be reproducible. Nevertheless, in order to generalize our
findings to current clinical practice, the method needs validation
especially in noninvasive angiography, which has now largely
replaced intraarterial angiography in the diagnostic workup of
carotid stenosis.
In conclusion, our study demonstrated for the first time that
increasing length of stenosis increased the procedural risk of both
EVT and CEA, to a similar degree. Patients with longer stenosis
were at higher risk of restenosis after EVT, but length of stenosis
was not associated with recurrent ipsilateral stroke. The results of
our study therefore do not favor one treatment as a better choice
over the other in patients with long carotid stenosis. Further
research is warranted to investigate whether improved anti-

thrombotic medication or specific interventional or surgical
techniques (e.g., protection devices in EVT, shunting in CEA) or
medication regimes might be effective in reducing the higher
procedural risk in patients with long carotid stenosis. To confirm
our findings, and to examine whether the results can be repro-
duced with noninvasive magnetic resonance or computed
tomography-based imaging techniques, the association between
length of stenosis and procedural risk, recurrent stroke, and res-
tenosis should be investigated in recent and ongoing trials of
carotid revascularization.
