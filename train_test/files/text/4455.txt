Almost 14% of individuals above 70 years have dementia
(Plassman et al., 2007). Despite available formal caregiving
options, many family members of people with dementia take
on a more informal caregiving role. In 2004, more than 28
million family caregivers spent more than 30 billion hr car-
ing for a family member with any condition, which could be
roughly translated to more than US$300 billion market value
(National Family CaregiversAssociation & Family Caregiver
Alliance, 2006). Notably, 75% of care provided for individu-
als with Alzheimer's disease alone is done so by informal
caregivers (Schulz & Martire, 2004). In the present study, we
focus on these informal caregivers of persons with dementia
(PWDs), defined as caring for a family member or friend in
an informal capacity (as opposed to a professional or paid
capacity). Given the large number of informal caregivers, it
is important to understand the associated mental health
effects of caregiving.
There is a large amount of literature speaking to the physi-
cal and mental health effects of caregiving for family mem-
bers with dementia. Evidence consistently shows that this
role is associated with negative physical and mental health.
Specifically, caregiving for individuals with dementia or
Alzheimer's disease is associated with anticipatory grief
(Garand et al., 2012), clinical depression and anxiety (Schulz,
O'Brien, Bookwala, & Fleissner, 1995), depressive disorders
and symptoms (Kiecolt-Glaser, Dura, Speicher, Trask, &
Glaser, 1991), and changes in processing speed (Caswell
et al., 2003). Dementia caregiving is also associated with
decreased immunity and more days sick with infectious dis-
eases (Kiecolt-Glaser et al., 1991) and decreased health
behaviors (e.g., less sleep; Connell, Janevic, & Gallant,
2001). Moreover, caregiving for individuals with dementia
(vs. no dementia) is associated with increased physical and
mental health difficulties, familial conflict, and caregiver
strain (Ory, Hoffman, Yee, Tennstedt, & Schulz, 1999).
Despite the abundance of research on caregivers of PWDs,
relatively little attention has been paid to caregivers in rural
settings. In addition to the mental and physical effects, rural
caregivers face additional challenges in caring for an indi-
vidual with dementia or Alzheimer's disease. Notably, rural
caregivers indicate that their family member faces unmet ser-
vice needs (Li, Kyrouac, McManus, Cranston, & Hughes,
2012) and limited availability and accessibility of services
(O'Reilly & Strong, 1997b). In addition, they face potential

Mental Health in Rural Caregivers
of Persons With Dementia

Abstract
Informal caregiving for dementia is common and often affects caregiver mental health. In addition to typical stressors faced
by caregivers of persons with dementia (PWDs), rural caregivers often face additional stressors associated with living in
more remote locations; unfortunately, this group is largely understudied. Ninety-three caregiver­PWD dyads completed
measures of social support, perceived control, self-efficacy, burden, and cognitive functioning. Measures of PWD activities of
daily living and mental functioning were also collected. These variables were hypothesized to predict caregiver self-reported
symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress. Contrary to predictions, only caregiving-related self-efficacy and caregiver
burden predicted the caregiver's mental health. Future interventions for improving rural caregiver self-reported mental
health should target cognitions associated with caregiving self-efficacy and caregiver burden. Health care providers for rural
families should focus on ways to reduce feelings of caregiver burden and provide caregivers with useful skills and tools for
caregiving.

stigma associated with dementia and fear the lack of privacy
in a small community (Morgan, Semchuk, Stewart, &
D'Arcy, 2002). In one report, researchers note that rural care-
givers provide almost 50 hr of care a week (Kosberg,
Kaufman, Burgio, Leeper, & Sun, 2007). Interestingly, gen-
der differences appear in comparisons of urban and rural
caregivers; male caregivers in rural environments exhibit
poorer mental health as compared with their urban-dwelling
counterparts; however, no differences emerge between
female caregivers in the two locations (Tommis et al., 2007).
Home care staff note that rural caregivers may be reluctant to
use services in the area and may not request help until a crisis
situation emerges (Morgan et al., 2002). Despite the draw-
backs of being a caregiver of a PWD in a rural setting, rural
caregivers do express somewhat high levels of social support
(Kaufman, Kosberg, Leeper, & Tang, 2010). Social support
in rural areas, despite its potential negative consequences
(e.g., community members misunderstanding the dementia
condition and criticizing the caregiver's care decisions), does
provide benefits, such as access to informal networks and
less social isolation (O'Reilly & Strong, 1997a).
Much of the research on caregivers in rural settings is quali-
tative, which is a necessary first step to understanding the prob-
lems faced by this population. However, more work is necessary
to more fully understand the relationship among demographic
variables, reported caregiver burden and social support, patient's
dementia, and caregiver mental health, as previous research
suggests that rural and urban caregiving is qualitatively differ-
ent. In the present descriptive study, we will examine predictors
of caregiver mental health (self-reported anxiety, stress, and
depression) in a sample of rural dementia caregivers. This next
step affords service providers more information about potential
points of intervention for this group of individuals.
To our knowledge, this is the first examination of mental
health predictors in rural dementia caregivers. In the pres-
ent study, cognitive functioning, social support, caregiver
burden, perceived control over one's life, self-efficacy in
caregiving, and demographic variables (i.e., age and gen-
der), in addition to the care-recipient's level of dementia
and ability to complete activities of daily living (ADLs),
will be explored as possible predictors of self-reported
caregiver mental health.
Research supports the hypothesis that many of these factors
will predict dementia caregivers' mental health symptoms.
Greater social support is related to lower levels of depression
(Lopez, Romero-Moreno, Márquez-González, & Losada, 2012;
Williams, 2005), and a caregiver's burden is negatively related
to his or her mental health (Garand, Dew, Eazor, DeKosky, &
Reynolds Iii, 2005; García-Alberca et al., 2012). Demographic
variables are also related to caregiver mental health, including
age (Covinsky et al., 2003; Neundorfer, 1991; Sparks, Farran,
Donner, & Keane-Hagerty, 1998) and gender (Covinsky et al.,
2003; Mahoney, Regan, Katona, & Livingston, 2005).
Moreover, across elderly caregiving studies (i.e., not restricted
to dementia caregiving), spouses report greater depressive
symptoms than do caregiving children (Pinquart & Sörensen,
2011). The PWD's ability to perform ADLs also predicts care-
giver anxiety (Mahoney et al., 2005), as well as the PWD's level
of dementia (Sparks et al., 1998). Self-efficacy, an individual's
belief that he or she has control over the events in his or her life,
is related to how much stress one believes he or she can handle
and has to do with how he or she encounters challenges
(Bandura, 2000). Conceptually similar, caregiver self-efficacy
is a caregiver's self-report of his or her ability to engage indi-
viduals with dementia in meaningful activities, respond to the
individual's needs, and deal with caregiving difficulties.
Increased caregiving self-efficacy is associated with lower lev-
els of depression (Gilliam & Steffen, 2006) and mediates the
relationship between care-recipient behavioral problems and
caregiver depression (Sherwood et al., 2007).Agreater sense of
caregiving-specific self-efficacy may also be related to lower
levels of depression, anxiety, and anger (Steffen, McKibbin,
Zeiss, Gallagher-Thompson, & Bandura, 2002). Although the
cited research is by no means exhaustive, it does support the
hypothesis that there is a relationship between a caregiver's
social support, burden, self-efficacy, and demographic charac-
teristics and his or her mental health. However, previous
research has largely neglected caregivers in rural settings.
To our knowledge, this is the first exploration of whether
processing speed predicts mental health in caregivers.
Although previous research suggests that individuals'
chronic stressors (such as chronic health conditions) predict
changes in cognition (for review, see Marin et al., 2011)
and that caregiving status predicts cognitive functioning
(although this effect disappears when distress is entered
into the regression; Caswell et al., 2003), we will include
caregiver processing speed as a predictor of mental health.
Hypotheses
Better rural caregiver mental health (fewer self-reported
symptoms of stress, depression, and anxiety) will be predicted
by greater levels of caregiver social support, perceived con-
trol, and self-efficacy; lower levels of caregiver burden; and
better cognitive functioning. Moreover, demographic vari-
ables, such as being female and younger age, will be related to
better caregiver mental health. Finally, lower levels of demen-
tia and greater ability to performADLs in/by the care-recipient
will be associated with better caregiver mental health.
Method1
Participants
Individuals interested in receiving an intervention for care-
giver burden responded to local media advertisements or
learned about the intervention from community resources
(e.g., local Alzheimer's Association chapter). Each of the 93
participating families consisted of one primary caregiver
(defined by the participating family) and one PWD (this is
Werntz et al. 3
loosely defined, as not all PWDs had received a formal diag-
nosis). Seventy-five percent of the families reported receiv-
ing a diagnosis of dementia (see Table 1 for the dementia
breakdown). Families lived in rural areas of central Virginia.
Measures
Measures completed by the caregiver
Demographic questionnaire.In addition to typical demo-
graphic information, the questionnaire included items
regarding the relationship between the caregiver and PWD,
the number of years the caregiver has been caregiving for
this family member, and whether or not there is a profes-
sional caregiver present, as well. Five families did not report
demographic information (see Table 1 for participant char-
acteristics).

scale range from 0 to 126 (scored according to question-
naire guidelines), and scores on the individual scales range
from 0 to 42; higher scores reflect higher endorsement of
symptoms. Note that this questionnaire measures the phys-
iological symptoms of anxiety (e.g., "I felt I was close to
panic"), symptoms of stress (e.g., "I tended to overreact to
situations"), and depressive symptoms (e.g., "I felt that I had
nothing to look forward to"). Psychometric properties for the
DASS-21 (Lovibond & Lovibond, 1995) in a sample of older
adults seeking treatment for worry in a primary health care
setting suggest adequate internal consistency and correlates
with widely used measures for similar constructs (Gloster
et al., 2008). In the current sample, the full scale exhibits
high internal consistency, Cronbach's  = .93.
Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support.This
12-item questionnaire (Zimet, Dahlem, Zimet, & Farley,
1988) contains questions regarding the participant's per-
ceived social support from three domains: significant other,
family, and friends. Individuals rate the degree to which they
agree or disagree with statements about how supported he
or she feels by others. Scores range from 1 to 7 (mean of
item responses); higher scores reflect greater social support
in each of the domains. Cronbach's  = .93 in the current
sample.
Zarit Burden Index­22-item version (ZBI).This 22-item
(Zarit, Reever, & Bach-Peterson, 1980) questionnaire con-
tains questions regarding a caregiver's feeling of burden
related to caregiving. Scores range from 0 to 88 (sum of item
responses). Higher scores reflect greater feelings of burden;
little or no burden is reflected by scores of 0 to 21, mild to
moderate burden by scores of 21 to 40, moderate to severe
burden by scores of 41 to 60, and severe burden by scores of
61 to 88. Cronbach's  = .91 in the current sample.
Perceived control.This 12-item (Lachman & Weaver,
1998) questionnaire consists of questions regarding an indi-
vidual's sense of perceived control over his or her life. Per-
sonal Mastery (e.g., "I can do just about anything I really set
my mind to") and Perceived Constraint (e.g., "I often feel
helpless in dealing with the problems of life") subscales are
used to create a perceived control score with higher scores
reflecting a greater sense of perceived control overall and a
higher standing in each subscale. Possible scores range from
1 to 7 (mean of item responses). In the current sample, Cron-
bach's  = .79.
Caregiver Self-Efficacy Tool­20-item version.This 20-item
questionnaire (Braddock, 2008; modified for the current study)
consists of questions from the original 34-item questionnaire.
This assesses the caregiver's efficacy and self-efficacy in how
he or she is able to work with the PWD on activities provided
by the intervention (e.g., "At this time, I am confident that
I am able to understand my family member's interests and
hobbies"). Scores can range from 20 to 100 (sum of item
responses); higher scores reflect self-efficacy with respect to
caregiving in the caregiver. Cronbach's  = .94 in the current
sample.
Digit Symbol-Coding subtest of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence
Scale­III (WAIS-III).2
The Digit Symbol-Coding subtest
(Wechsler, 1997) measures cognitive processing speed by
asking participants to copy symbols of corresponding num-
bers into boxes as quickly as possible in 2 min. Possible
scores can range from 0 to 133 (sum of correct symbols).
Alzheimer'sDiseaseCooperativeStudy(ADCS)--ADLInventory­
Severe Impairment Version (ADCS-ADL-SIV).This 19-item
interview (Galasko et al., 1997) includes questions for the
caregiver of the PWD concerning the PWD's abilities to
perform ADLs over the past 4 weeks. Caregivers are asked
to describe the actions of the PWD observed in domains
such as eating functions, personal care functions, and his
or her ability to use items around the home. Using a struc-
tured interview, scores of 0 to 54 (sum of item responses)
were obtained with higher scores reflecting greater ability to
perform ADLs. This interview has adequate test­retest reli-
ability (with a significant correlation of .93 from baseline
to 1-month follow-up; Galasko et al., 2005). Note that this
form was used with permission from the National Institute
on Aging (NIA) Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study
(NIA Grant AG10483).
Measure completed by the caregiver and PWD
Mini Mental Status Examination (MMSE).In this brief
dementia screener, individuals are asked a series of ques-
tions regarding orientation (e.g., date and location), short-
term memory, and working memory. Scores on the MMSE
(Folstein, Folstein, & McHugh, 1975) range from 0 to 30
with higher scores reflecting greater cognitive functioning.
Although both age and education can affect mean scores on
the MMSE (Crum, Anthony, Bassett, & Folstein, 1993), in
the present intervention, a score of 30 reflects no dementia,
scores 26 to 29 reflect questionable dementia, scores of 21 to
25 reflect mild dementia, scores of 11 to 20 reflect moderate
dementia, and scores of 0 to 10 reflect severe dementia (Per-
neczky et al., 2006). In line with Crum et al.'s (1993) scoring
guidelines, both the serial sevens question (subtracting seven
from 100 and so on) and spelling WORLD backward were
administered, and the set that yielded the higher score was
used for scoring.
Procedure
Consent procedure.To ensure that all individuals compre-
hended the purpose of the intervention research study, as the
first step in the consent procedure, the researcher (a) informed
the caregiver and PWD of the goals of the study, (b) assessed
whether or not the PWD understood the purpose and goals of
Werntz et al. 5
the study, and (c) determined which consent forms were nec-
essary for each family. If the PWD comprehended the pur-
pose and goals, the researcher administered an informed
assent agreement to the PWD and a "guardian informed con-
sent" agreement to the caregiver so that he or she could sign
for the PWD. The caregiver was asked to sign a caregiver
informed consent agreement. It should be noted that some of
the PWDs were unable to sign the assent form. In this case of
last resort, the PWD could provide oral assent to participate,
and both the caregiver and the home visitor would sign and
date the assent form. The home visitor was also asked to pro-
vide a detailed rationale for not obtaining written assent.
Questionnaire administration.
All families participated in
their homes; both the PWD and caregiver were present. Fol-
lowing informed consent, caregivers completed the demo-
graphic, DASS-21, social support, ZBI, perceived control,
and caregiver self-efficacy questionnaires independently.
Researchers administered the digit symbol questionnaire,
ADL, and MMSE according to established measure guide-
lines. Note that during oral administration (ADL and
MMSE), the caregiver and PWD were separated when pos-
sible to ensure measurement validity (i.e., so one would not
overhear the other's answers).
Results
Analytic Plan
To assess the predictors of caregiver mental health (as
assessed by the DASS-21), a hierarchical linear regression
was conducted. Prior to running the regression analysis,
assumptions were checked. Notably, caregiver age and care-
giver mental health were not normally distributed; these
variables were transformed using a square root transforma-
tion and were normally distributed following the transforma-
tion. All other assumptions (multivariate normality, linearity,
normally distributed errors) were checked and met (see Table
2 for descriptive information for the measures before
transformation).
Predicting Caregiver Mental Health
To assess how well caregiver social support, perceived control,
caregiving self-efficacy, caregiver burden, and PWD's cogni-
tive functioning (on the MMSE) and ADL predict caregiver
mental health, when controlling for the caregiver's age and
gender, a hierarchical linear regression was computed. When
age and gender were entered, they did not significantly predict
caregiver mental health, F(2, 57) = .51, p = .605, R2 = .02.
However, when caregiver social support, perceived control,
caregiving self-efficacy, caregiver burden, and PWD's cogni-
tive functioning and ADL were entered into the model, they
significantly improved the prediction, R2 = .55, F(6, 51) =
10.62, p < .001.All variables entered together significantly pre-
dicted caregiver mental health, F(8, 51) = 8.22, p < .001.
Together, these variables accounted for 56.3% of the variance
in caregiver mental health.
Contrary to predictions, only caregiver self-efficacy,  =
-.38, t(51) = -3.35, p = .001, and caregiver burden,  = .44,
t(51) = 3.83, p < .001, were significant predictors of care-
giver mental health. Caregiver age, t(51) = -0.82, p = .419,
gender, t(51) = 0.22, p = .823, social support, t(51) = -1.74,
p = .089, perceived control, t(51) = -0.33, p = .746, the
PWD's cognitive functioning, t(51) = -1.52, p = .135, and
the PWD's ADL, t(51) = 1.35, p = .184, did not significantly
predict the caregiver's mental health.
Taken together, the results suggest that greater caregiver
self-efficacy in caregiving ability is related to better (i.e.,
lower scores) caregiver mental health. Moreover, better care-
giver mental health is related to less caregiver burden.
Surprisingly, caregiver age, gender, social support, perceived
control, and the PWD's cognitive functioning and ADL did
not significantly predict the caregiver's mental health.

Follow-up analyses. Following the results of the multiple lin-
ear regression, exploratory correlational analyses were con-
ducted to examine the relationship among caregiver
self-efficacy, caregiver burden, and mental health domains
(see Table 3 for correlation coefficients). Results suggest that
caregiver self-efficacy is negatively correlated with care-
giver depression, anxiety, and stress, such that as the care-
giver's self-efficacy in caregiving increases, depression,
anxiety, and stress decrease. Moreover, caregiver burden is
positively correlated with caregiver depression, anxiety, and
stress, such that increasing feelings of burden are associated
with greater reported depression, anxiety, and stress symp-
toms. Overall, caregiver burden is more strongly correlated
with mental health variables than caregiver self-efficacy.
In addition, a post hoc power analysis was conducted
using G*Power software (Faul, Erdfelder, Lang, & Buchner,
2007). Our sample (93 participants) was adequately powered
at .95 ( = .05) for a two-tailed t test, and medium effect size,
for eight predictors in a multiple linear regression.
Discussion
To our knowledge, this is the first assessment of multiple
predictors on the mental health of caregivers of PWDs in a
rural setting. Contrary to predictions, caregiver age, gender,
social support, perceived control, and the PWD's cognitive
functioning and ADL did not significantly predict the care-
giver's current mental health (as assessed on a self-report
depression, anxiety, and stress symptom measure). Consistent
with predictions, however, caregiver self-efficacy and bur-
den did predict caregiver mental health. Exploratory analy-
ses revealed medium-sized correlations between caregiver
self-efficacy and depression, anxiety, and stress. Moderately
large correlations emerged between caregiver burden and the
components of mental health. Taken together, these results
suggest the importance of rural caregiver's experienced bur-
den and feelings of self-efficacy while caregiving for a loved
one with dementia.
The present study failed to support previous dementia
caregiving findings with regard to the relationships between
mental health and social support (Lopez et al., 2012;
Williams, 2005), age (Covinsky et al., 2003; Neundorfer,
1991; Sparks et al., 1998), gender (Covinsky et al., 2003;
Mahoney et al., 2005), and relationship (Pinquart & Sörensen,
2011). Previous research has also found support for a rela-
tionship between caregiver mental health and the PWD's
reported ADL (Mahoney et al., 2005) and level of dementia
(Sparks et al., 1998). In the present sample of rural caregiv-
ers, these factors do not appear to play a significant role in
predicting their overall mental health when caregiving.
Prior work--replicated in the present study--has found
that the burden of caregivers of Alzheimer's disease patients
(García-Alberca et al., 2012) and individuals with mild cog-
nitive impairment (Garand et al., 2005) is related to caregiver
mental health. This suggests that the relationship between
mental health and burden is fairly robust, even across mild
and more severe forms of dementia caregiving. Caregiver
quality of life is also strongly tied to reported levels of care-
giver burden (Heggie et al., 2011). Burden has also been
found to mediate the relationship between a patient's disturb-
ing behavior and a lack of caregiver social support on depres-
sion in dementia caregivers (Clyburn, Stones,
Hadjistavropoulos, & Tuokko, 2000). These relatively robust
findings across studies make it clear that caregiver burden is
one area that could be targeted by interventions to greatly
improve caregiver's mental health. Caregiver self-efficacy
was also found to predict mental health in our rural dementia
caregivers. This result also is in line with prior work in this
area; self-efficacy is associated with lower levels of depres-
sion (Gilliam & Steffen, 2006; Romero-Moreno, Márquez-
González, Mausbach, & Losada, 2012) and mediates the
relationship between patient behavioral problems and care-
giver depression (Sherwood et al., 2007). Importantly,
researchers have found that the combination of self-efficacy
and spirituality in caregivers is associated with better mental
health (Lopez et al., 2012).
Individuals with greater self-efficacy are hypothesized to
be able to take on challenges, rather than avoid them, and are
less vulnerable to anxiety and depression (Bandura, 2000).
To measure caregiving self-efficacy in the current study,
caregivers were asked about their confidence in engaging the
PWD in activities around the home, coping with added
responsibilities around the home as a caregiver, and effec-
tively responding to the frustration associated with caregiv-
ing. Caregivers' greater feelings of caregiving self-efficacy
were associated with better mental health (i.e., fewer self-
reported symptoms of anxiety, depression, and stress). It is
perhaps the case that self-efficacy provides a certain resil-
iency in caregivers of individuals with dementia. What is
surprising, however, is that perceived control (a concept very
similar to self-efficacy) did not significantly predict care-
giver mental health. The caregivers may not have understood

this measure, as it was the measure most commonly left
incomplete in the packets. Thus, the questions may not have
been a valid measure of perceived control in this sample.
What is likely, though, is that there is something unique
about self-efficacy specific to caregiving skills--and not
more general feelings of control in one's life--that is related
to mental health in this sample of rural caregivers.
Limitations
There were a number of limitations in the current study that
should be noted. First, participating families all responded to
local advertisements for a caregiver intervention by a local
Alzheimer's disease group. All families had to be willing to
allow researchers to come into the home across a few months
to administer measures and interact with the caregiver and
PWD. Thus, the present sample may not be representative of
every rural family with an individual with dementia. Second,
religion and spirituality were not assessed in the current
study; thus, a potentially important aspect of coping or sup-
port was not included in our model. Caregivers of PWDs
have reported that religious coping is helpful when coping
with caregiving (Stolley, Buckwalter, & Koenig, 1999).
Research on religious coping in rural caregivers has primar-
ily focused on ethnic and racial differences. Results suggest
that African Americans endorse greater religious coping than
Caucasian individuals (from cities: Haley et al., 2004; and
rural areas: Kosberg et al., 2007). Despite our sample being
largely Caucasian, religion and religious coping may play a
role in caregiver's understanding of the caregiving role, and
thus may have affected the present results.
Importantly, results from the present analyses should be
interpreted in light of the fact that the self-efficacy measure
has yet to be rigorously tested or validated. Although previ-
ous work has utilized the longer form of the measure
(Braddock, 2008), the measure was shortened for the present
study and has not been validated in either form. Despite this,
the measure demonstrated excellent internal consistency in
the present sample and was found to significantly predict
caregiver mental health. In addition, participating caregivers
seem to have found the measure approachable, as they all
completed it. However, future work must test the reliability
and validity of the measure, especially in larger samples.
Future Directions and Conclusions
The present study was the first to our knowledge to examine
caregiver age, gender, perceived social support, perceived
control, burden, caregiver self-efficacy, and the PWD's cog-
nitive functioning and ADL as predictors of rural caregivers'
mental health. Contrary to predictions, only caregiver burden
and caregiver-related self-efficacy were significant predic-
tors of symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress.
Importantly, these two predictors accounted for more than
half of the variance in caregiver mental health, suggesting
the relative importance of these two components on mental
health. Future research should investigate interventions tar-
geting caregiver-specific burden and self-efficacy, seeking to
reduce the perceived burden by rural caregivers and increase
the relative control that caregivers have over their situation.
Specifically, interventions could teach caregivers how to
cope with increased responsibilities around the home, deal-
ing with difficult PWD behavior, and how to effectively
engage the PWD in meaningful activities around the home.
Given the results of the present study, interventions that suc-
cessfully target these areas may reduce mental health prob-
lems in rural caregivers, who deal with unique issues when it
comes to caregiving.
In addition to the difficulty of caregiving for an individual
with dementia or Alzheimer's disease, rural caregivers must
effectively cope with the added stressors of rural caregiving.
Largely forgotten by targeted interventions, rural caregivers
face the added challenges of lack of privacy and increased
stigma in small communities (Morgan et al., 2002) and lim-
ited availabilities of services (O'Reilly & Strong, 1997b).
The present findings are somewhat positive in that two fac-
tors that can be targeted by interventions, namely, caregiver
burden and self-efficacy, were shown to be predictive of
caregiver mental health. Many variables that would be
impossible to target in interventions, such as caregiver age
and gender, did not significantly predict mental health.
Moreover, it may be possible to target burden and self-effi-
cacy via telephone or Internet, which would overcome some
of the difficulties associated with rural caregiving.
Informal rural caregivers, often with little or no choice
due to limited resources, have made a difficult decision to
care for a loved one with dementia or Alzheimer's disease.
Moreover, these individuals have the added difficulties asso-
ciated with caregiving in rural areas. In the present study,
reduced caregiver burden and increased caregiving-related
self-efficacy are related to decreased caregiver mental health
(i.e., self-reported symptoms of depression, anxiety, and
stress). These results are promising in that they provide a
potential next step in creating targeted interventions for
reducing caregiver mental health issues.

Notes
1. Note that measures described here are a subset of measures
administered during an experimental intervention targeted
toward reducing caregiver burden. The present study only
includes measures administered during a baseline testing ses-
sion. A full list of measures and results is available from the
last author.
2. In preliminary testing in this sample, participants had a diffi-
cult time reading the numbers and symbols and copying them
into the corresponding boxes on the page owing to the size of
the print. In subsequent testing, we increased the size of the
print and boxes slightly (note that the entire form still fit on the
traditional 8.5" × 11" page).
