Is there a parliamentary
peace? Parliamentary
veto power and military
interventions from Kosovo
to Daesh
Wolfgang Wagner
Abstract
This article studies the effect of parliamentary involvement on security policy. Building on
Democratic Peace Theory, it examines whether democracies with a parliamentary veto power
are indeed less likely to participate in military interventions, than democracies without such a
veto power, ceteris paribus. By studying patterns of participation across 25 to 35 countries in five
military missions, this paper finds modest evidence for such a parliamentary peace and suggests
that it depends on the character of the military mission in question. If a mission is framed as a
test case of alliance solidarity, as was the case with OEF and the Iraq War, domestic institutional
constraints can be trumped by alliance politics. If, however, countries enjoy more discretion in
deciding on the use of force, domestic constraints such as parliamentary war powers have a
tangible impact on government policy.

Introduction
In August 2013, the British House of Commons provided a spectacular demonstration of
parliamentary war powers. After the use of chemical weapons in a suburb of Damascus
had been attributed to the Syrian government, the United Kingdom, France and the United
States showed resolve to respond with punitive military strikes against Bashar-al-Assad's
regime. In line with an emerging convention (Mello, 2017; Strong, 2015), the Cameron
government asked parliament to approve a strong response, including possible military
action. To Cameron's surprise, the House of Commons voted against the government

motion (Kaarbo and Kenealy, 2016). After the British government had declared that it
would refrain from any military strike, the French and American governments followed
suit. It is no exaggeration to conclude that the House of Commons is responsible for the
non-use of force against the Syrian government in 2013.
The 2013 House of Commons vote seems a perfect illustration of the effects of parlia-
mentary involvement on the substance of security policy. What is more, the episode seems
a textbook example of the institutionalist version of the democratic peace theory, according
to which domestic actors, such as parliaments, constrain the executive in its use of force.
However, much of this literature has taken its cues from the US system of checks and bal-
ances where Congress is more independent of the executive and legislative­executive rela-
tions are frequently antagonistic, especially if the president's party differs from the majority
in Congress. In parliamentary systems, by contrast, the majority party or coalition of parties
forms a functional unit with the government and open confrontation between parliament
and government is a rare exception. In parliamentary systems, the executive typically either
disciplines the parliamentary majority to support its policies or avoids a vote in anticipation
of an absent majority (on the executive rationale behind parliamentary votes, see Strong in
this Special Issue). From this perspective, the 2013 House of Commons episode is untypical
because it first and foremost indicates that the government misjudged the degree of dissent
within the governing majority (Kaarbo and Kenealy, 2016).1
In parliamentary systems, open confrontation between parliament and government is
exceptional, therefore parliamentary influence on deployment decisions should not be
equated with the former voting against proposals of the latter. Instead, the power of parlia-
ments should manifest itself in the pattern of liberal democracies' participation in military
interventions. As government decides in the shadow of parliament's war powers, and
because war powers differ across democracies, we should see countries with weak parlia-
ments use military force more often than those where prior parliamentary approval is
required. Participation patterns are a better way to study the effect of parliamentary involve-
ment on security policy than the actual exercise of legislative veto powers. By studying pat-
terns of participation across 25­35 countries in five military missions, this article contributes
to a systematic understanding of the effect of parliamentary involvement on security policy
and thus to the second guiding question for this Special Issue (Mello and Peters).
This article finds modest evidence for such a parliamentary peace and suggests that it
depends on the character of the military mission in question. If a mission is framed as a
test case of alliance solidarity, as was the case with Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF)
and the Iraq War, domestic institutional constraints can be trumped by alliance politics. If,
however, countries enjoy more discretion in deciding on the use of force, domestic con-
straints such as parliamentary war powers have a tangible impact on government policy.
The next section discusses the state of the art on the `parliamentary peace' (Dieterich
et al., 2015). It outlines the causal mechanisms that specify why parliamentary control is
expected to make the use of force less likely and reviews the empirical evidence thus far.
I then present the research design of this study and discuss the empirical findings. My
analysis of liberal democracies' (non-)participation in military interventions in 1999
(Kosovo), 2001 (Afghanistan), 2003 (Iraq), 2011 (Libya) and 2014 (Daesh) suggests that
countries with a parliamentary ex ante veto power are indeed less likely to contribute to a
military mission than countries without one. However, a closer examination of individual
missions demonstrates that such a pattern is only statistically significant for two of them:
Operation Allied Force (Kosovo) and Operation Unified Protector (Libya). In contrast,
countries with a parliamentary ex ante veto power were just as likely to join OEF, the Iraq
War and the air campaign against Daesh as countries without.

State of the art
Parliamentary peace: rationale and causal mechanisms
The idea that parliaments constrain governmental decisions on using force has a long
pedigree. In the summer of 1914, British MPs founded the `Union of Democratic Control'
out of frustration over the government's secret de facto commitment to come to the
defence of France. This commitment contradicted the official British policy to avoid an
entanglement in a war on the continent. The founders of the Union, among whom were
Ramsay MacDonald and Norman Angell, asked that `no treaty, arrangement or undertak-
ing shall be entered upon in the name of Great Britain without the sanction of parliament'
(quoted from Harris, 1996: 54).
Almost 60
years later, the same spirit was midwife to the War Powers Resolution
(WPR) in the United States. The WPR obliges the President to consult with members of
Congress before introducing US armed forces into hostilities. Moreover, the use of force
must be stopped after 60days unless Congress decides to extend the deployment, effec-
tively providing Congress with an ex post veto power. The resolution had met the stern
opposition of President Nixon who used his veto to block it. However, both houses over-
rode the veto with the two-third majorities required. The WPR was brought forward in a
climate of `deep distrust of the Presidency' (Franck and Weisband, 1979: 35) among
members of Congress and the public more broadly. To a large extent, this mistrust was fed
by the President's conduct of the war in Vietnam.
Several mechanisms have been identified that link institutional constraints (and parlia-
mentary control in particular) to a less bellicose policy.2 A first causal mechanism echoes
veto player theory, according to which any veto player makes any decision less likely for
the simple reason that an additional actor needs to agree.3 However, as pointed out above,
the implicit assumption that parliament has preferences independent of the executive con-
tradicts the logic of parliamentary systems, according to which the government and the
parliamentary majority form a functional unit.4 This logic makes the embarrassment of a
veto, such as the 2013 House of Commons veto on Syria, highly unlikely. However, even
though the juxtaposition between the government and its majority in parliament, on the
one hand, and the opposition, on the other, often trumps legislative­executive relations in
a parliamentary system, they do not do so always and entirely. First, backbenchers within
the governmental majority parties may be difficult to discipline, especially on questions
of using military force, which is often considered a moral issue. Second, governments
often aim at a broad consensus in support of their policies that includes at least the major
opposition party/parties. This consensus is often the case with military interventions,
which are seen and presented as transcending party politics. In both cases, a parliamen-
tary veto power encourages the government to reach out, address concerns and ultimately
compromise to secure broad support.
As a second causal mechanism, checks and balances slow down the decision-making
process. Bruce Russett emphasised that this slowdown can buy time for a diplomatic
solution (Russett, 1993: 40). With a view to the House of Commons' vote on Syria in
2013, one could add that the requirement to consult parliament can also cool down belli-
cose emotions: Prime Minister Cameron responded to the use of chemical weapons in a
suburb of Damascus with calls for punitive air strikes against the alleged perpetrator, the
Syrian government. The British press supported such punitive action.5 Although there are
several reasons for the government's defeat in the House of Commons (Kaarbo and
Kenealy, 2016), the parliamentary debate provided the space for doubts to be voiced and
forced the government to address them.
124 The British Journal of Politics and International Relations 20(1)
Third, institutional constraints influence the type of conflicts that leaders pick and the
way that they are fought. Siverson (1995) has argued that the mere count of war participa-
tions does not tell the full story because it does not distinguish between Germany in World
War II (with 1.8million battle deaths), on the one the hand, and the United States in the
Spanish-American War (5000 battle deaths), on the other (Siverson, 1995: 483). Instead of
counting war participations, Siverson (1995) suggests examining the lethality of conflicts,
understood as the logged number of casualties per 10,000 people. Comparing democracies
with non-democracies, he indeed finds support for the hypothesis that wars initiated by
democracies are significantly less lethal than those initiated by non-democracies. Students
of `democratic victories', that is, the finding that democracies tend to win the wars they
fight, draw on the same causal mechanism Reiter and Stam (2002), for example, argued
that democracies tend to win the wars they fight because democratic constraints make
leaders pick only conflicts they are confident of winning.
Of course, the same rationale that distinguishes democracies from non-democra-
cies also applies to differences among democracies with different levels of institu-
tional constraints. Indeed, Saideman and Auerswald (2012) argue that institutional
constraints tend to make governments impose caveats, that is, restrictions on how
their troops can be used in a military mission. With a view to Germany's contribution
to Afghanistan, they argue that `the necessity of maintaining parliamentary support
seems to explain why casualty aversion is THE top priority for German officers in
Afghanistan, guiding decisions on helicopters, operations, and the like' (Saideman
and Auerswald, 2012: 77).
The discussion above shows that parliamentary control of military missions does not
make participation in military missions impossible. Especially if there is broad support
for the use of force in parliament and among the public, parliament is unlikely to veto the
use of force. More typically, however, public support is modest and decision-makers are
aware that an initial wave of support (the `rally around the flag effect') can melt away the
longer the mission takes and the higher the number of casualties (Mueller, 1973). We
therefore expect that countries with a parliamentary veto power are, ceteris paribus, less
likely to participate in a military intervention.
Data and findings
Although this question has attracted growing interest in the wake of the democratic peace
debate, our knowledge about the actual effects of parliamentary war powers on govern-
ments' decisions to use military force is remarkably limited.
Peterson (1996), Auerswald (1999, 2000) and Elman (2000) compare decision-making
processes on the use of force between democracies with autonomous executives, on the
one hand, and executives facing strong legislatures, on the other. While all three find sup-
port for the general notion that institutional constraints by parliaments matter, they also
hesitate to claim a general relation between strong parliament and conflict avoidance
because parliament is not always less hawkish than the executive. Among the three
authors, Auerswald comes closest to a general proposition that different institutional sys-
tems impact on the likelihood of conflict initiation by the executive. Even if a legislature
is initially in favor of conflict, Auerswald argues, institutionally constrained executives
will be reluctant to engage in conflict because they are aware of the inherent risks of such
an endeavour. However, strong executives run a lower risk of domestic defeat and are
thus less risk-averse (Auerswald, 2004: 641f.).

Whereas Peterson (1996), Auerswald (1999, 2000) and Elman (2000) carry out in-
depth case studies, a second group of scholars run statistical analyses to examine the
hypothesis that the likelihood of a state initiating conflict decreases as legislative control
over foreign policy increases. Reiter and Tillman (2002) examine conflict initiation by 37
democracies over the period 1919­1992 with country-years as units of analysis. As a
proxy for legislative control, Reiter and Tillman (2002) use treaty ratification power.
Their findings are mixed. Although there is a statistically significant correlation between
legislative power over treaty ratification and the initiation of so-called Militarized
Interstate Disputes, the variable becomes insignificant if only conflicts involving the use
of force are included. Clark and Nordstrom (2005) have confirmed these findings.Aweak
spot in Reiter and Tillman's (2002: 816) study is their assumption that `legislative involve-
ment in treaty ratification is likely to extend to other areas of foreign policy'. Because
better data on parliament's war powers were missing, this assumption was the only way
to study a relatively large number of democracies over a relatively long period of time.
The dearth of data on actual war powers was overcome in the late 2000s. Dieterich
et al. (2010, 2015) collected data on the actual competences and practice of parliaments
of 25 members of the European Union at the time of the 2003 Iraq War. They find strong
evidence for a `parliamentary peace [...] [H]igh parliamentary war powers are associated
with reduced war involvement. Countries with a high degree of parliamentary war powers
were significantly less militarily engaged in the Iraq War' (Dieterich et al., 2015: 100).
Wagner et al. (2010) collected data on parliamentary war powers in 49 democracies
between 1989 and 2004, including countries in Europe, Asia, Africa, the Americas and
Oceania. They find that parliamentary veto power over military deployments is relatively
widespread, albeit still restricted to a minority of democracies.
Mello (2014) extended the analysis to additional interventions (Kosovo 1999 and
Afghanistan 2001) and countries (e.g. Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the United
States). Mello uses fuzzy set Qualitative Comparative Analysis as a method to identify
configurations of variables that impact on a government's decision to participate in a mili-
tary intervention. Using data from Dieterich et al. (2010) and Wagner et al. (2010), Mello
(2014: 186) finds `no cross-case pattern [...] for parliamentary veto rights'. For the
Kosovo intervention, Mello finds that the absence of parliamentary veto power is a neces-
sary condition for participation. However, for the Iraq War, Mello finds that constitutional
restraints explain the non-participation of numerous states better than parliamentary veto
power. In addition, several parliaments that could have vetoed participation did not do so.
Haesebrouck (2016a, 2016b) has used a very similar research design to examine the con-
tributions of liberal democracies to the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon
(UNIFIL) and to the air strikes against Daesh. As regards to UNIFIL, he finds that `the
presence of parliamentary veto [...] is associated with the absence of large contributions'
(Haesebrouck, 2016b: 152). With a view to the air strikes against Daesh, he finds that a
legislative veto `is a relevant condition, irrespective of partisan politics' (Haesebrouck,
2016a: 15). However, the `prospect of legislative meddling did not inhibit participation if
the combination of a strong threat and high alliance value provided states a strong incen-
tive to participate' (Haesebrouck, 2016a: 15).
Testing the parliamentary peace thesis
This section tests the parliamentary peace thesis empirically. I selected five cases of mili-
tary missions on the basis of criteria that have been established by major works in the
126 The British Journal of Politics and International Relations 20(1)
comparative study of `democratic wars'(Mello, 2014: 6­8; Schörnig et al., 2013: 25­27):
Only military missions after the end of the Cold War are included, to which several liberal
democracies made a sizable military contribution (excluding unilateral and minilateral
interventions as well as many UN-led peace operations). In addition, decisions to partici-
pate must have been politically controversial (excluding many small and low-risk opera-
tions), and there must have been variance in liberal democracies' involvement. Based on
these criteria, the following missions are included in this study: (1) Operation Allied
Force against targets in Serbia and Montenegro in 1999 to force Milosevic to stop vio-
lence against ethnic Albanians in Kosovo (therefore, usually referred to as `Kosovo
War'), (2) OEF in Afghanistan in 2001 to fight Al Quaida in response to the 9/11 terrorist
attacks, (3) the war against Iraq in 2003, (4) the air strikes against Libya in 2011 when
massive violence by Gaddafi's government against civilians was feared and (5) the cam-
paign against Daesh in Iraq and Syria since 2014.6
In all of these missions, some democracies decided to participate whereas others
decided against participation. If the parliamentary peace thesis holds, countries with a
parliamentary ex ante veto power should be overrepresented among the non-participants
whereas countries without parliamentary veto power should be overrepresented among
the participants.
As discussed above, four of the five cases studied here have already been examined
with a view to the impact of parliament on (non-)participation in military missions:
Kosovo and Afghanistan have been analyzed by Mello (2014), Iraq by Mello (2014) and
Dieterich et al. (2015) and the strikes against the so-called Islamic State by Haesebrouck
(2016a, 2016b). This article not only adds an analysis of Operation Unified Protector
(Libya 2011), it also extends the analysis to additional liberal democracies that were
excluded from the studies by Mello (2014) and Dieterich et al. (2015). Finally, in contrast
to Mello (2014) and to Haesebrouck (2016a, 2016b), this article does not apply a set-
theoretic methodology that treats parliamentary war powers as a possible necessary or
sufficient condition in combination with other factors. Instead, this article follows
Dieterich et al. (2015) in gauging the influence of parliamentary war powers on (non-)
participation in military missions by cross-tabulating the two variables. This difference in
methodology, however, is not meant to deny the advantages of a set-theoretic approach.
Instead, cross-tabulation is best understood to complement a set-theoretic approach and
thus allow for a triangulation of the question that this article shares with those by Mello
(2014) and Haesebrouck (2016a, 2016b).
The parliamentary peace thesis only applies to democracies. In order to identify
democracies, I rely on the Polity dataset, which has been widely used in International
Relations and conflict studies.7 The dataset includes an 11-point democracy scale (0­
10) and an 11-point autocracy scale (0­10). A country's regime type (`combined Polity
score') is then measured by subtracting its autocracy score from its democracy score,
yielding a 21-point scale (from -10 to +10). The Polity team itself considers states with
a Polity score of 6 or higher as democracies (Marshall and Cole, 2014: 20). However,
students of democracy and peace have often used a higher cutoff point to identify
democracies. In order to include only countries whose democratic credentials are
beyond doubt, I follow Gartzke (2001: 478) and Mello (2014: 8) who only include
states that score 8 or higher. This cutoff point is plausible as it excludes countries such
as Ukraine, Kyrgystan or, at times, Turkey whose democratic credentials have not been
beyond doubt and that are thus difficult to compare with `mature' democracies, such as
the United Kingdom or the Netherlands.
Wagner 127
In addition, I follow democratic peace custom by excluding `politically irrelevant'
cases, that is, countries that are very unlikely to participate in one of the military inter-
ventions under study in the first place. In studies of inter-state war, a shared border or
the involvement of a major power are typically taken as indicators of political relevance
because both make armed conflict a real possibility.8 Of course, geographical distance
has lost importance in the era of the `wars of choice' under study here. Indeed, some
distant states (e.g. Australia) have joined the coalitions intervening in some of the con-
flicts studied here. Nevertheless, it seems clear that the non-participation of a Latin
American country in, for example, the intervention in Libya, weighs differently than
the non-participation of a European country as the former has a much lower baseline
probability to even consider participation in the first place. To exclude states that are
unlikely to intervene anyway, I limit my study to states that are either full members of
NATO or linked to NATO via the Partnership for Peace (PfP) programme because the
purpose of the latter has been to allow NATO states to cooperate operationally with
non-members.9
It is beyond the scope of this article to discuss any of the military missions and the
(non-)participation of particular liberal democracies in detail. For the interventions in
Kosovo/Serbia,Afghanistan and Iraq, I follow the coding by Mello (2014) where possible
and add the cases missing in his sample.10 Data on the participants and non-participations
in air strikes against Daesh are taken from Haesebrouck (2016a); data on Operation
Unified Protector are based on International Institute for Strategic Studies (2012).
To distinguish countries with and without parliamentary veto power over military mis-
sions, I updated and extended the PARLCON dataset that is also used in the studies of
Mello (2012, 2014) and Haesebrouck (2016a). In contrast to its earlier version, Albania,
Estonia, Latvia, Moldova, Montenegro and Serbia have been added.11
To examine the parliamentary peace thesis, I carried out a set of cross-tabulations.
Where the number of cases is small and cells in the contingency tables are filled with only
few entries, Fisher's exact test is the best way to analyse whether parliamentary ex ante
veto power is correlated with non-participation in military missions in a statistically sig-
nificant way.
Findings
Tables 1 to 6 display cross-tabulations for the military missions studied.
The data show that for all missions together, there is support for the parliamentary
peace thesis: whereas a majority of intervening states has no parliamentary ex ante veto
powers, the majority of non-intervening states has such a veto, and this difference is sta-
tistically highly significant. However, this finding does not hold for every individual mis-
sion. The correlation between war powers and (non-)participation is statistically
significant at the 0.05 level for the 1999 Kosovo mission and the 2011 strikes against
Libya and at the 0.1 level for the campaign against Daesh. However, for OEF and Iraq,
the expected pattern is not present, let alone statistically significant.
Among the findings on individual missions, the one on Iraq is the most surprising as it
directly conflicts with the study by Dieterich et al. (2015), who found strong evidence for
a parliamentary peace. A closer look reveals that the difference in findings does not pri-
marily result from the addition of countries that were not members of the EU (and thus
excluded by Dieterich et al., 2015). Instead, the difference results from the use of Mello's
data on (non-)participation that include the period between May and August 2003, which

is excluded from Dieterich et al. (2015). In this period after the declared end of major
combat operations, countries with parliamentary veto powers such as Estonia, Macedonia,
Latvia, Lithuania and Romania contributed troops--against the expectation of the parlia-
mentary peace hypothesis. Proponents of the parliamentary peace may point out that
countries which contributed troops in the period between March and May 2003 partici-
pated in a war of aggression that lacked the authorisation from the United Nations Security
Council. In contrast, countries joining the coalition after May 2003 could refer to an
appeal by the United Nations Security Council to help rebuild the country and contribute
to security and stability. Although this change in international legal status does not lower
the risks for the troops on the ground, as subsequent casualties demonstrate, it impacts on
public support in liberal democracies. The finding on the 2003 Iraq operation is thus best
understood as a qualification, rather than a rejection, of the parliamentary peace.
The pattern of findings across missions suggests that the character of the mission has
an impact on whether parliamentary war powers constrain government participation. At
the same time, the variation across missions makes it unlikely that relatively stable factors
such as military capabilities or government system can account for this variance.12
What sets the missions in Kosovo and Libya apart from OEF and the Iraq War is their
justification as humanitarian interventions. In 1999, air strikes against targets in Serbia
were justified by the necessity to stop the violence by Serbian forces against ethnic
Albanians in Kosovo. Similarly, the 2011 strikes against Libya were based on United
Nations Security Council resolutions 1970 and 1973 that invoked the Responsibility to

Protect (Adler-Nissen and Pouliot, 2014) after statements by Libya's Muammar Gaddafi
led to fears of an imminent massacre of civilians. In contrast, the justifications for OEF
and the Iraq War emphasised self-defence: OEF started a day after an ultimatum, issued
by the US government to the Taliban regime in Afghanistan to hand over the leadership
of al Qaida, elapsed. On 18 September, Congress had authorised the US President `to use
all necessary and appropriate force against those nations, organisations, or persons he
determines planned, authorised, committed, or aided the terrorist attacks that occurred on
September 11, 2001, or harbored such organisations or persons'.13 Prior to this, the North
Atlantic Council of NATO decided that the attacks `shall be regarded as an action covered
by Article 5'14 in case they were directed from outside the United States. On 2 October,
the North Atlantic Council noted that the attacks indeed were externally directed and
therefore considered an attack against all members of NATO.
Humanitarian and self-defence rationales blend in the justification of air strikes against
Daesh in the case of the imminent threat to the Yazidis in northern Iraq. Thus, a humani-
tarian motive was the main trigger for air strikes in 2014. At the same time, however, the
initial air strikes were justified with a reference to a request from the Iraqi government
that had asked for support in its efforts to defend itself against Daesh (Ruys and Verlinden,
2015). Moreover, later extensions of the air strikes against targets in Syria followed a self-
defence rationale that was fuelled partly by Daesh's use of Syrian territory as a base for
operations against the Iraqi government, partly by the invocation of (collective) self-
defence by the French government after the terrorist attacks in Paris in 2015.
The limited impact of parliamentary war powers on (non-)participation in (collective)
self-defence missions can be attributed to the efforts of states to signal their support for key
allies, either out of genuinely felt solidarity or in anticipation of future support in return as
well as to the political pressure that key proponents of intervention exert on reluctant states.
After the 9/11 terrorist attacks, the United States left little doubt that it was `willing
and able to take successful military action against the Taliban and Al-Qaeda without
allied support' (Davidson, 2011: 131). However, many liberal democratic governments
expressed their readiness, if not eagerness to actively support the United States in its war
against terror. OEF became the umbrella for a broad coalition of states that wanted to join
an intervention in Afghanistan. The extent to which support resulted from genuinely felt
solidarity or from opportunism, that is, in anticipation of reciprocal future support from
the United States, is difficult, if not impossible to determine. In any case, to the commu-
nity of liberal democracies, it was clear that their participation was not militarily neces-
sary but of potentially high symbolic value.As a consequence, `alliance value'(Davidson,
2011), that is, an assessment of the importance of ties with the United States, played a key
role in decision-making. The German case may serve as an illustration. After his declara-
tion of `unconditional solidarity', Chancellor Schröder was determined to contribute
troops to OEF. Given widespread opposition in the governing coalition, the only way to
have his parliamentary majority endorse this decision was to link the deployment vote to
a motion of confidence. With 336 to 326 votes, the decision to participate in OEF was the
tightest in more than 140 deployment votes.
After two years, self-defence was again invoked by the United States while preparing
for the war against Iraq.15 In contrast to the immediate aftermath of 9/11, however, the
eagerness among allies to participate was rather low, and the Bush administration resorted
to a comprehensive set of carrots and sticks to create what critics called a `coalition of the
bribed, bullied and blind'(Gilfeather, 2003, quoted from Newnham 2008: 183). Newnham
(2008) has argued that this policy of economic linkage has often been effective.
Wagner 131
Furthermore, Newnham (2008: 197) argues that some states such as the Baltic countries,
participated in the Iraq War to secure US support in a future conflict with Russia. Although
some states, most prominently France and Germany, resisted the pressure, many others,
especially in central and eastern Europe, seized the opportunity to demonstrate transatlan-
tic solidarity (Schuster and Maier, 2006).
To be sure, alliance politics also played a role for OperationAllied Force and Operation
Unified Protector. The former in particular was widely seen as a test for NATO in its 50th
year of existence, and Germany's abstention in the UN Security Council vote on authoris-
ing force against Libya was certainly frowned upon. Nevertheless, neither the United
States nor other proponents of intervention exerted much pressure on liberal democracies
to make a military contribution.
Conclusion
This article provides modest evidence for a parliamentary peace. Taking five prominent
military missions of the past twenty years together, countries with a parliamentary ex ante
veto power are less likely to contribute to a military mission than countries without one.
However, a closer examination of individual missions demonstrates that such a pattern is
only statistically significant for three of them: Operation Allied Force, Operation Unified
Protector and, though only on the 0.1 level of statistical significance, the campaign against
Daesh. In contrast, countries with a parliamentary ex ante veto power were just as likely
to join OEF and the Iraq War as countries without such a veto.
Proponents of the parliamentary peace may of course point to the limited number of
cases and the skewed distribution between participants and non-participants in some mili-
tary missions, all of which make statistically significant correlations less likely. At the
same time, however, the findings reported here echo the studies reviewed above: the
effect of parliamentary war powers is not robust and unconditional; instead, it depends on
context conditions. Whereas Mello has identified government ideology, that is, the party
political composition of government, as an important factor that interacts with institu-
tional constraints, this article argues that the character of the respective mission qualifies
the effect of parliamentary war powers. If a mission is framed as a test case of alliance
solidarity, as was the case with OEF and the Iraq War, domestic institutional constraints
can be trumped by alliance politics. If, however, countries enjoy more discretion in decid-
ing on the use of force, domestic constraints such as parliamentary war powers have a
tangible impact on government policy.
Open confrontation between parliament and government is rare in parliamentary
systems and thus in the vast majority of countries studied in this article. Although the
2013 House of Commons vote that prevented the British government from striking
Syria is a highly visible demonstration of parliamentary war powers, it is also decep-
tive. A more typical manifestation of parliamentary influence on decisions to use
armed force are governments refraining from a military mission in the shadow of a
parliamentary veto in case support is weak or absent. Although governments can
always decide to whip the MPs of their party/parties into supporting the government
line, such action is politically costly and more likely to be taken under international
pressure than in its absence.

Notes
 1. Another rare episode is the March 2003 vote by the Turkish parliament to not allow the United States to
use Turkey as a base for the Iraq War (Kesgin and Kaarbo, 2010).
 2. An alternative perspective holds that democratic institutions do not constrain but `facilitate information
revelation by improving a government's ability to send credible signals of its resolve'(Schultz, 1999, with
reference to Fearon, 1994).
 3. Veto player theory was developed by George Tsebelis (1995, 2002).Although democratic peace theory has
developed a very similar argument, reference to Tsebelis' work is hardly ever made.
 4. A noteworthy exception is minority governments, which for this reason are expected to be less likely to
use military force (Maoz and Russett, 1993: 626). Empirical results, however, have been contradictory
with Ireland and Gartner (2001) finding support whereas Brulé and Williams (2009: 787) finding minority
governments to be `more likely to initiate conflict because they lack the parliamentary majority to demon-
strate domestic economic competence'.
 5. For example, the Economist showed Assad's face on its cover and titled `Hit him hard!'.
6. Space constraints do not allow an in-depth discussion of these missions here. For a discussion of the
interventions in Kosovo, Afghanistan and Iraq, see Mello (2014); for Iraq, see also Oktay (this issue) in
this Special Issue; for Libya, see Adler-Nissen and Pouliot (2014); for the campaign against Daesh, see
Haesebrouck (2016a).
 7. The Polity project was founded by Ted Gurr in the 1970s; the Polity IV database is hosted at the Center
for Systemic Peace at George Mason University and directed by Monty G. Marshall, http://www.sys-
temicpeace.org/polityproject.html (accessed 15 April 2017). This article is based on data from the 2015
version of the dataset (p4v2015).
 8. For the concept of political (ir)relevance, see Russett (1993: 74). The concept resembles the `possibility
principle', suggested by Mahoney and Goertz (2004) according to which cases should be excluded if the
outcome under study is impossible.
 9. The countries under study here by and large coincide with those analysed in Mello (2014) and Haesebrouck
(2016a). However, I add Lithuania, Slovenia and Switzerland to the Kosovo War study, Moldova and
Switzerland to the Afghanistan case study and Croatia, Macedonia, Moldova and Switzerland to the Iraq
War study. At the same time, I exclude Australia, Cyprus, Japan, New Zealand, the Republic of Korea and
Taiwan because they did not participate in Partnership for Peace (PfP) as well as Luxemburg and Iceland
because of their military insignificance.
10. Mello's coding of (non-)participation differs from the one in Dieterich et al. (2015) because the time
period under study is much shorter in the latter study. I dichotomised Mello's data with all states coded 0.6
or higher on Mello's scale as `participants' and all states coded 0.4 or lower as non-participants.
11. In addition, based on recent research by Fabrizio Coticchia and Francesco Moro (2017), Italy has been
recoded as not having a parliamentary ex ante veto power.
12. The relevance of military capabilities for conflict behavior has been widely acknowledged; the type of
democratic government, especially the distinction between presidential and parliamentary systems has
been suggested by Maoz and Russett (1993), Auerswald (1999) and Elman (2000). This leaves open the
possibility that less stable factors such as public opinion account for (some of) the variance. However,
data on public opinion of good quality are missing for a substantial number of countries under study in this
article.
13. Joint Resolution to authorise the use of United States Armed Forces against those responsible for the
recent attacks launched against the United States (PUBLIC LAW 107­40--SEPT. 18, 2001).
14. Quoted from Murphy (2002: 244).
15. In contrast to Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF), however, self-defence was not the only justification
brought forward by the United States. In addition, the Bush administration argued that a series of UN SC
resolutions allowed for the use of force.
