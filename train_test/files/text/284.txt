ABSTRACT
Objective: To estimate the return on US investment (ROI) in
overall health as well as four specific conditions.
Methods: The study utilized three distinct approaches to
"triangulate" the evidence as related to ROI in health care: 1)
an estimation of the average ROI in additional health-care
service expenditures in the United States for the year 2000
compared with the year 1980, based on US summaries of
health expenditures and health outcomes; 2) an estimate of
the ROI in Medicare services for the period from 1985 to
2000 for treatment of heart attack, stroke, type 2 diabetes,
and breast cancer, based on National Long-term Care Survey
data and Medicare claims; and 3) an estimate of the ROI for
selected major treatment innovations for the same four con-
ditions during the period from 1975 to 2000.
Results: We calculated that each additional dollar spent on
overall health-care services produced health gains valued at
$1.55 to $1.94 under our base case assumptions. The return
on health gains associated with treatment for heart attack,
stroke, type 2 diabetes, and breast cancer were $1.10, $1.49,
$1.55, and $4.80, respectively, for every additional dollar
spent by Medicare. The ROI for specific treatment innova-
tions ranged from both savings in treatment costs and gains
in health to gains in health valued at $1.12 to $38.00 for
every additional dollar spent.
Conclusion: The value of improved health in the US popu-
lation in 2000 compared with 1980 significantly outweighs
the additional health-care expenditures in 2000 compared
with 1980.
Keywords: health policy, innovation, Medicare claims,
return on investment.
Introduction
In 2002, the United States spent $1.6 trillion for health
care [1]. This figure was nearly triple the amount spent
on health care in 1980 ($621 billion) [1]. Thus, it
should not be surprising that the cost of health care
and what to do about it has been, and is today, a
national preoccupation, even to the point of being a
subject of presidential debates [2]. Recently, several
economists and policy analysts have completed studies
focusing on health care as an investment rather than
just as a cost, asking and attempting to answer the
question: what is the value of the benefits associated
with these expenditures? [3­6] These researchers have
compared estimates of the dollar value of incremental
health benefits (based on the value of a statistical life--
see Table 1) to incremental health-care costs and gen-
erated estimates of the return on the increasing US
health-care investment.
Nordhaus (2002) [3] argued that the utility form of
income accounting measures the value that the popu-
lation gets from its current level of consumption, thus
allowing for the enumeration of the increased value of
additional longevity and better health as well as the
value from consumption of the traditional market out-
puts. Valuing a statistical life at $3 million, and using
data on the increase in health-care costs and life
expectancy between 1980 and 1990, Nordhaus esti-
mated that every additional dollar spent on health care
returned between $1.90 and $2.60 and health benefits.
Using $5 million as the value for a statistical life,
Murphy and Topel (1999) [4] calculated that increases
in life expectancy from 1970 to 1990 generated $2.8
trillion annually to the US economy. This was reduced
to $2.4 trillion annually when increases in annual
health-care expenditures over the same time period
were netted out. Using $100,000 as the value of a qual-
ity-adjusted life-year (QALY), Cutler and McClellan
(2001) [6] calculated an overall return on investment
(ROI) in health care (US) from 1950 to 1990 to be
$3.71, and found that net benefits of treatment of five
conditions (heart attacks, low-birth weight infants, de-
pression, cataracts, and breast cancer) ranged from zero
(breast cancer) to $200,000 (low birth-weight infants).
In an analysis using the Medical Expenditure Panel Sur-
vey (MEPS) data, Lichtenberg (2001) estimated a re-
duction in other health-care costs of $71.09 for every
additional $18 spent on newer generation drugs [5].
Return on Investment in Health Care 147
The purpose of the present research was to extend
the previous work, cited above, in the following ways.
For the return of investment of total US investment in
health using national data, we extended the analysis an
additional 10 years, to the year 2000. As well, we pro-
vide estimates of ROI to Medicare using its data for
four specific health conditions, heart attack, type 2 dia-
betes, stroke, and breast cancer and we supplement
these analyses with estimates of ROI for major new
treatment advances in the four specific conditions. By
providing this multifaceted approach, we hope to pro-
vide more definitive evidence about the ROI in health
than has previously been published.
Methods
The study utilized three distinct approaches to "trian-
gulate" the evidence as related to the ROI in health care
in the United States. The first approach involved a cal-
culation of the ratio of annual increased expenditures
on overall health-care services in the United States for
the year 2000 compared with 1980 to the annual
decrease in deaths or increase in life expectancy in the
year 2000 compared with 1980. This approach gives a
snapshot view of the relationship between health-care
spending for both prevention and treatment and health
outcomes in a single year. Because health outcomes in
a given year are partially dependent on health expen-
ditures in previous years, this approach assumes that
the expenditures on health-care services in 2000 will
influence future health outcomes in the same way as
health-care expenditures before 2000 influenced health
outcomes in 2000. To more accurately reflect the fact
that health outcomes in a given year are partially
dependent on health expenditures in previous years, we
used two additional estimation approaches. The sec-
ond approach estimated the ROI in Medicare health-
care treatment services for the period from 1985 to
2000 for four health conditions: heart attack, stroke,
type 2 diabetes, and breast cancer. The third approach
looked at the same four health conditions, but esti-
mated the ROI for selected major treatment innova-
tions during the period from 1975 to 2000.
The four health conditions were chosen based on
several factors:
· Each disease is widely prevalent (see Table 2)
(heart attack affects 2.6% [7.6 million persons] of
population, type 2 diabetes 6.0%[17 million per-
sons], stroke 1.6% [4.7 million persons], breast
cancer 0.7% [2.2 million persons]), thereby lead-
ing to high death and disability rates with costly
implications;
· A broad spectrum of demographic groups is
affected by these diseases; across sex, race, and
age, to a lesser degree.
· Major financial investments have been made in
the treatment of the chosen diseases over the past
few decades [7], including numerous technologi-
cal innovations and advances in drug therapy,
which raises the question of the return to society
of those investments.
Approach 1: ROI in Overall Health
Annual summaries of health-care expenditures and
health outcomes (death rates, average life expectancy),
for the US population was compared for two points in
time, 1980 and 2000. Specifically, the observed costs
and health outcomes for the 2000 US population were
compared with costs and health outcomes that would
have been observed for the 2000 US population if the
age-adjusted per person expenditure rates, age-

adjusted death rates, and age-adjusted life expectancy
had remained at the 1980 levels. The costs included
costs for all health-care services including inpatient,
outpatient, and public health, publicly funded health-
care research, and for health facility construction. The
1980 costs were inflated to 2000 US dollars using "All
Items" from the Consumer Price Index [8] to express
these costs "relative to prices in the economy as a
whole" [6]. The differences in annual costs, deaths,
and life expectancy represent the incremental costs and
health gains experienced in 2000, compared with those
that would have been experienced at the 1980 values.
Based on estimates by Cutler and Kadiyala (1999)
[9], we assumed that 66.5% of the improvements in
health outcomes observed in 2000 compared with
1980 are attributable to the increased expenditures on
health-care services. This 65% (33% + [0.5 × 67%])
was estimated from Cutler and Kadiyala's estimates
for cardiovascular mortality that 33% of the reduction
in mortality was attributable to new medical technol-
ogy and 67% to the spread of new medical informa-
tion through physicians and health-care providers as
well as the media and other sources. We assumed that
50% of the spread of new medical information
occurred during a health-care service visit. We
assumed that changes in other factors associated with
health outcomes (behavioral, environmental, and soci-
oeconomic) over this time period had mixed effects on
health outcomes, some improving them. For example
reduced levels of smoking and hypertension and
reduced accident rates, and some worsening them
(increased obesity) resulting in 33.5% of the total
gains in health outcomes. The importance of this
assumption was tested in a threshold analysis.
To compute the ROI in overall health care, the gains
in mortality (i.e., avoided deaths) or life expectancy
(both outcomes examined) were converted into dollars
based on published estimates of the value of a statis-
tical life and value of a statistical life-year. Estimates of
the value of a statistical life have ranged from $1 mil-
lion to $9 million based on the type and year of the
study [6] (Table 1). The current study used a value of
a statistical life of $4 million and applied it uniformly
to all deaths avoided in 2000 compared with 1980
without regard to the age of death. This value was cho-
sen because it gave a value of approximately $100,000
per undiscounted life-year which has been used in pre-
vious studies to value health gains [6]. The value of an
undiscounted life-year, of a discounted life-year, and of
the annual consumption (annuity) value of 1 life-year
were computed from the $4 million value of a statis-
tical life using the following steps:
· Assumed age at which value of a statistical life is
estimated = 39 years.
· Remaining life expectancy at 39 years = 40.4
undiscounted using the US life table.
· Remaining life expectancy at 39 years = 23.1 dis-
counted at 3% using the US life table.
· Net present value of a life-year = $4,000,000/
40.4 = $99,092 (undiscounted).
· Net present value of a life-year = $4,000,000/
23.1 = $173,300 (discounted).
· Annual consumption (annuity) value of 1 life-
year = $99,092/40.4 = $2455 (undiscounted).
· Annual consumption (annuity) value of 1 life-
year = $173,300/23.1 = $7509 (discounted).
Approach 2: Return on Medicare's Investment in Four
Health Conditions
This analysis compared changes in inflation-adjusted
Medicare payments to changes in health outcomes
for incident cohorts of patients with the four health
conditions, heart attack, type 2 diabetes, stroke, and
breast cancer, during three subperiods: 1985 to 1989,
1990 to 1994, and 1995 to 2000. Details of the anal-
ysis have previously been reported [10].
The study population (N = 38,566) comprised indi-
viduals aged 65 and older randomly drawn for selec-
tion into the National Long-term Care Survey
(NLTCS). All Medicare institutional claims (hospital
inpatient, outpatient, home health, skilled nursing
facility, and hospice) were searched for ICD-9-CM
diagnosis codes specific to each of the four index dis-
eases. Persons were selected into the sample based
on a hospitalization with a primary diagnosis of AMI
(N = 2649) or stroke (N = 3337). For type 2 diabetes,
persons were selected into the sample at the first occur-
rence of a primary or secondary diagnosis on an insti-
tutional claim (N = 5018). For breast cancer, women
were selected based on a primary diagnosis of breast
cancer or a related procedure code on either a hospital
inpatient or an outpatient claim (N = 1160).
Outcomes common to all four diseases, heart
attack, type 2 diabetes, stroke, and breast cancer, were
changes in survival, activities of daily living (ADL) lim-
itations, cognitive status, prescription drug cost, and
placement in a nursing home. Mean life expectancy
was predicted during the 5-year period after the first
service date on the claim, separately for: 1) persons
with diagnoses recorded in 1985 to 1989; 2) an iden-
tical cohort in 1990 to 1994; and 3) an identical
cohort in 1995 to 1999. Differences between the pre-
dictions (2­1), and (3­1) reflected gains in life expect-
ancy, controlling for changes in other covariates (i.e.,
sex, race, age, educational attainment, health status
[the DxCG score]) [11].
Medicare cost was real (using the Consumer Price
Index, all items, all urban consumers), total Medicare
payments (2000 dollars) for the first 5 years after the
beneficiary's first date of service on the claim used to
define the index event. Linear regression was used with
the natural logarithm of cost after diagnosis as the
dependent variable. Increases in the cost of nursing
Return on Investment in Health Care 149
home use and prescription drugs cost were treated as a
reduction in the value of health outcomes. The cost of
nursing home use was calculated using an estimate of
annual cost at the midpoint of the first and last study
interval [12,13], multiplied by a factor of 0.897 [12] to
exclude Medicare's share of such cost. The cost of pre-
scription drugs was calculated using NLTCS commu-
nity survey responses on the number of prescription
drugs purchased, and either the dollar or percentage
cost borne by the beneficiary. A two-part model of
drug costs was used because not all individuals had
prescription drug expenditures: logistic regression to
predict the probability of purchasing any prescription
drugs, and linear regression to predict either the per-
centage or dollar amount paid for out-of-pocket by
those respondents who reported at least one prescrip-
tion drug purchase.
The dollar values of health outcomes represented
gains in survival, and reductions in the increase in ADL
limitations and cognitive impairment, net of increases
in non-Medicare nursing home and prescription drug
cost. To value survival gains, a value of $100,000 per
life-year without an ADL limitation [14­16]. For a life-
year with an ADL limitation, we used a value of
$50,000 [11]. For cognitive limitations, we decreased
the value of a life-year with or without an ADL lim-
itation by $2500 per question answered incorrectly.
Approach 3: ROI in Major Innovations
For each disease of interest, heart attack, type 2 dia-
betes, stroke, and breast cancer, we first compiled a
timeline of major treatment innovations that had
occurred in the past 25 years (see Appendix A). This
process was based on both consultation with clinical
experts and review of key clinical literature.
Second, a literature search was conducted using
search terms for the four diseases of interest, as well as
the following economic terms: "costs and cost analy-
sis," "pharmaceutical economics," "cost-benefit anal-
ysis," and "health-care costs." The search was limited
to English language articles published since 1975.
Each retrieved article was reviewed to determine
whether it met the following study inclusion criteria:
1. Included at least one treatment option that was
included in the list of selected treatment innova-
tions for the time period from 1975 to 2000 (see
Appendix A)
2. Did not compare similar forms of the same treat-
ment innovation (e.g., two innovative drugs
within the same drug class, such as two statins)
3. Utilized cost-effectiveness or cost-utility method-
ology that produced either a cost-effectiveness or
cost-utility ratio (i.e., cost per life-year gained or
cost per QALY gained) for comparator treatments
4. Study based in the United States or incorporated
US treatment patterns and costs
For relevant treatment comparisons within the
selected published studies, the ROI in a particular
treatment innovation was calculated as follows:
1. All costs reported as part of the cost-effectiveness
or cost-utility ratio results were updated to year
2000 US dollars based on the Medical Services
component of the Consumer Price Index [8].
2. A value of $100,000 was used as the net present
value of an undiscounted life-year or QALY
gained, and $173,000 as the net present value of a
discounted life-year or QALY gained and applied
to the study estimates of life-years gained or
QALYs gained [6,15].
3. The value of the incremental health gains was
divided by the incremental costs. Or an equivalent
calculation was to divide the study estimated cost
effectiveness ratio (inflated to $2000) by the value
for a undiscounted or discounted life-year.
As an example, a published study reports the incre-
mental cost-utility ratio for Treatment A relative to
Treatment B is $45,000 per QALY gained. The study
discounted both costs and outcomes, so the value
assigned to the QALY gained is $173,000. Thus, the
ROI in Treatment A versus Treatment B is $173,000/
$45,000 or more precisely "a value of $3.84 in health
gains for every dollar spent on Treatment A."
Results
Return on Investment in Overall Health
Between 1980 and 2000, the annual death rate
declined from 1039 to 872 per 100,000 persons
(16%); life expectancy from birth increased by
3.2 years (4%) and average life expectancy for all ages
increased by 2.18 years; and disability rates for people
over 65 years declined from 26.2 to 19.7 per 100 per-
sons (25%) [17]. However, there was a concomitant
increase in health spending. However, there was a con-
comitant increase in health spending during the same
time period, with annual (age-adjusted) per person
health-care costs increasing by $2296 (99%) [11,17].
For the period from 1980 to 2000, we calculated
that each additional dollar spent on overall health-care
services produced health gains valued at $1.55 to
$1.94 (Table 3). The ROI in overall health-care serv-
ices is greater than one under a wide range of alterna-
tive assumptions. As an example, for every additional
dollar spent on health-care services, the ROI remains
greater than $1 for all scenarios where a statistical life
is valued at >$2.6 million and for all scenarios where a
life-year is valued at >$64,500. Alternatively, assuming
our base case values of $4 million for the value of a sta-
tistical life and $100,000 for the value of a life-year, for
every additional dollar spent on health-care services,
the ROI remains greater than $1 for all scenarios
where at least 43% of the life expectancy gains are

directly attributable to the additional health-care
expenditures.
Return on Medicare's Investment in Four
Health Conditions
The results of the Medicare claims analysis are pro-
vided in Table 4. The health gains that occurred for
heart attack patients between the periods of 1985 to
1989 and 1995 to 1999 (i.e., an average of 0.30
increased life-years) were valued at $28,632. After
subtracting the increase in heart attack treatment costs
over the same time period ($26,093), the net benefit in
dollars was $2539 or, stated differently, the return on
health gains associated with heart attack treatment
was estimated to be $1.10 for every additional dollar
spent by Medicare. The return on health gains associ-
ated with treatment for the other three health con-
ditions were $1.49, $1.55, and $4.80 for every
additional dollar spent by Medicare for stroke, type 2
diabetes, and breast cancer, respectively (Table 4).
Return on Investment in Major Innovations
The literature review identified a total of 23 pub-
lished studies that reported cost-effectiveness or cost-
utility ratio results that could be utilized in ROI
calculations for the period from 1980 to 2000 (see
search results in Table 5). The results of the ROI cal-
culations are provided in Table 6. As an example,
Grover et al. (2001) [18] examined the cost-effective-
ness of statin therapy (vs. no statin therapy) in
patients with type 2 diabetes who did not have cardi-
ovascular disease. The cost-effectiveness ratio ranged
from $5063 to $23,292 (1998 dollars) per dis-
counted life-year gained, depending on study assump-
tions. Thus, the return on health gains for this
patient population was $7 to $31 for every addi-
tional dollar spent on statin therapy. For all studies
included in Table 5, the ROI ranged from both sav-
ings in treatment costs and gains in health to a return
on health gains of $1.12 to $38.00 for every addi-
tional dollar spent.

Discussion
Although the cost of medical care has been a national
preoccupation and concern for years now, the gains in
health have not been neglected by the popular media,
nor have the impressive array of health-care innova-
tions. We are all aware that improved health has value
to society as does access to the latest medical and
health-care advances. The question is how much value
relative to the cost.
But quantifying the value of these health-care gains
has received much less attention in the United States
until fairly recently, and our findings are consistent
with those studies that preceded ours [3,4,6]. For
instance, the Economic Policy Institute demonstrated
a remarkable positive correlation between national
health-care spending and life expectancy across all 30
countries of Organization for Economic Cooperation
and Development with, interestingly, two outliers: the
United States ranks highest (by far) in spending but
21st of 30 in life expectancy whereas Japan rates first
in life expectancy and 15th in expenditures (http://
w.epi.org/content.cfm?=1914; accessed November 15,
2005). However, our findings are not necessarily con-
sistent with other international work. For example, a
World Bank study found no clear correlation between
national health expenditures with life expectancy
across developed and developing countries [19,20]. It
is not clear to us why this inconsistency may exist but
may be have more to do with the limitations of the
data, for example, difficulty controlling for covariates,
than the absence of a relationship between health and
expenditure. As well, time series analyses of the impact
of change in a single country, as we have done, are a
very different analytical approach than the interna-
tional studies which have looked at the aggregate levels
of expenditure and health across countries at a single
point in time. Thus, our findings may not be in conflict
with these international comparison studies. In any
case, there is no strong theoretical or empirical argu-
ment that increasing expenditure will not increase
health.
To fully appreciate our findings, it is important for
the reader to understand several issues and caveats.
First, we attempted to take a broad, representative
approach to valuing health care in the United States.
This is important because of the complexity of the
question we faced and the imperfect nature of the
available evidence. We accomplished this by focusing
our research efforts across several dimensions. That is,
we chose to examine both overall health-care indices
relative to overall health-care costs; as well as to
examine in more depth four major diseases (heart
attack, type 2 diabetes, stroke, and breast cancer) in
terms of costs and benefits incurred by and accrued to
Medicare and resulting from key innovations over
time. These four diseases were chosen for several rea-
sons, including their being highly prevalent, costly and
each has been the subject of a great deal of expensive
and often effective innovation. Had we chosen other
diseases, we may well have seen different patterns of
ROI, which is one reason we were determined to also
estimate the overall ROI for national health-care
spending.
Second, our effort to develop the evidence presented
in this study was broad-based in that we researched the
existing clinical, economic, technology assessment and
outcomes literature, consulted with clinical specialists
in each of the four chosen conditions and examined in
detail the Medicare claims database and long-term
care survey data.
Third, although our primary task was to estimate
the ROI in health care, we fully recognize that many
nonhealth-care factors affect the population's health
both positively and negatively. For instance, although
between 1980 and 2000 many nonhealth-care factors
have led to positive gains in health (e.g., lower smok-
ing rates), many others (e.g., increased obesity) have
led to negative outcomes. Other factors such as rates of
exercise and environmental conditions may have both
positive and negative impacts on overall health indices.
It was not possible to adjust for all of these factors. In
our base case analysis, we have assumed that 66.5% of
the gains in health between 1980 and 2000 were
attributable to the provision of health education and
of preventive and treatment health-care services. A
sensitivity analysis explored higher and lower values
for this parameter. The confounding problem noted
above is much less of a concern for our disease-specific
findings because, for each disease, we begin our anal-
ysis with a population already afflicted with the dis-
ease, then we calculate the gain in health over time
relative to the health-care cost invested. Thus, for each
disease, the reader can more comfortably assume that
the estimated benefits are due to the investment in
health care.
Because of scope and access to data reasons, we
chose to concentrate our analysis on therapeutic rather
than preventive technologies. With few exceptions,
Medicare does not cover prevention. Had we chosen to
include prevention, we may have found different
results, although we are aware of no evidence that this
would be the case. Russell argued back in 1986 that
the focus on costs of prevention `. . . more precise, the
assertion that prevention saves money . . . was a mis-
placed notion.' (Russell LB. Is prevention better than
cure. Studies in Social Economics. The Brookings Insti-
tution, Washington, DC; 1986.) She went on to note
that although there were a few published studies dem-
onstrating medical costs savings and a few others dem-
onstrating preventing disease were estimated to be less
cost-effective than letting the disease develop and then
treat it, her main conclusion was consistent with ours:
that the public policy issue should be value not cost. To
Return on Investment in Health Care 153
our knowledge, the only study that has attempted to
evaluate the overall ROI of prevention was published
by the Public Health Services in 1995. (US Department
of Health and Human Services. Public Health Service.
"For a Healthy Nation: Returns on Investment in Pub-
lic Health." Report no. 390-173; 1995). Although a
true ROI was not calculated, the study reported that
25 of the 30 years of life gained since 1900 could be
attributed to public health/prevention efforts and that
some unspecified future investment in prevention and
public health could save up to 11% ($69 billion in
1994 dollars) of medical costs over 5 years.
Fourth, we attempted to evaluate the return on a
broad range of types of investment in health care as
opposed to restricting our efforts to high technology.
For instance, we note the significant advances of more
efficient hospital use (lower lengths of stay and hospi-
tal costs), better public health focused surveillance
techniques, better diagnosis and counseling for those
with high blood pressure or high cholesterol levels,
and better practices in glucose control as well as use of
many innovative pharmaceuticals, medical devices,
and diagnostic technologies.
Finally, we specifically examined whether the incre-
mental investment in health care has yielded a positive
return. We did not address whether society could
achieve these same health benefits at a lower cost or
whether the health-care system is operating efficiently
as a whole. This study should, however, provide addi-
tional perspective as the nation debates health-care
cost containment strategies, helping to refocus atten-
tion on increasing value rather than cost reduction as
the primary objective.
The results from the current study are likely to
underestimate the ROI in overall health-care services
because, for the most part, they do not include the
value of the morbidity gains from the reduction in dis-
ability over age 65 and gains in worker productivity
and quality of life attributable to new treatments for
specific health conditions. Over the past 20 years, sig-
nificant gains in productivity and quality of life asso-
ciated with health-care interventions in those less than
65 years of age have been shown for several diseases
including influenza, migraine, diabetes, and depres-
sion. Unfortunately, comprehensive national estimates
of changes in US productivity or quality of life attrib-
utable to health conditions are not available. If these
data were available, the ROI to overall health-care
services would likely be higher.
The values of a statistical life-year, $100,000
(undiscounted) and $173,000 (discounted) that we
used in our analyses and that have been used by others
previously were derived from empirical estimates of
the value of a statistical life. They support the view
expressed by Hirth et al. (2000) [21] that the current
benchmark value that is frequently use for cost-
effectiveness analyses, $50,000 per QALY, is an under-
estimate of the amount that people in the US are will-
ing to pay for an additional year of life.
Cutler and Kadiyala (1999) [9] and Cutler and
Meara (2001) [22] have argued that there are several
theories of better health measured by reduced mortal-
ity--that better health results from: 1) economic
growth; 2) new medical knowledge and practice; 3)
better access to health-care services; 4) better public
information about the new medical knowledge and
behavioral changes; and 5) government actions to
reduce risky behavior. They argue that in the US, the
improvements in life expectancy at the beginning of
the 20th century occurred as a result of economic
growth, whereas those in the middle of the century
were associated with medical advances in the treat-
ment of infection, and those in the later part of the cen-
tury were associated with better public information
and behavioral changes as well as improving preven-
tion and treatment services. The dependence of life
expectancy on all of these factors may confound the
relationship between levels of health-care spending
and life expectancy. This article has presented three
methods for measuring this relationship in an attempt
to obtain quantitative estimates of the ROI in health
care.
