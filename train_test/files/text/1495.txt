Hypertension (HTN) is extremely prevalent in the United
States affecting over 65 million people, ~29% of the adult
population.1,2 HTN remains a cardinal predictor of cardiovas-
cular disease events, stroke, and death.3 Similarly, it is associ-
ated with increased morbidity and health-care costs. Druss
et al. estimated that hypertensive patients accumulated almost
twice the per capita health-care costs when compared to other
chronic conditions including mood disorders, diabetes, heart
disease, and asthma.4 Total health costs for patients with HTN
were over $110 billion in 1996.
Depression is highly prevalent in the United States, affect-
ing an estimated 14.8 million adults or about 6.7% of the US
population above age 18 in a given year.5 According the World
Health Organization, unipolar major depression was the sec-
ond leading cause of disability-adjusted life years lost among
US women in 1996 and the fifth leading cause for all people
worldwide in 1999 (ref. 6). In addition to causing substantial
disability, diminished work productivity and absenteeism,
depression is associated with increased use of health-care
resources.7 Multiple studies have demonstrated that 
depression
is associated with increased all-cause mortality including

cardiovascular mortality.8­13 Earlier work by our group has
also demonstrated a significantly increased risk of death in
patients with comorbid depression and diabetes.14
Studies to date have failed to address the specific association
between comorbid depression and overall and ischemic heart
disease (IHD) mortality in adults with HTN. To address these
issues, we examined mortality in a large nationally representa-
tive cohort of adults aged 25­75 years in 1971­1975, who were
reinterviewed in 1982 and followed until 1992 (refs. 14­16).
We compared all-cause mortality among four subsets of par-
ticipants based on their disease status at the 1982 interview.

Association of Depressive Symptoms With
All-Cause and Ischemic Heart Disease Mortality
in Adults With Self-Reported Hypertension
R. Neal Axon1,2,Yumin Zhao1 and Leonard E. Egede1,2
Background
Hypertension (HTN) is a prevalent and important risk factor for both
cardiovascular and all-cause mortality. Depression is often present in
hypertensive patients and has also been associated with increased
mortality risk.The aim of this study was to evaluate the association
of depressive symptoms with all-cause mortality and ischemic heart
disease (IHD) mortality among adults with self-reported HTN.
Methods
We studied 10,025 participants in the National Health and Nutrition
Epidemiologic Follow-up Study (NHANES I) who were alive and
interviewed in 1982 and had complete data for the Center for
Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D). Four groups were
identified based screening status at initial interview: (i) no HTN, no
depression (reference group); (ii) HTN, no depression; (iii) no HTN,
depression; and (iv) both HTN and depression. Cox proportional
hazards regression was used to calculate multivariate-adjusted
hazard ratios (HRs) of death for each group.

and questionnaires that addressed various health topics.
Persons living in poverty areas, women of childbearing age
(25­44 years), and elderly persons (>65 years) were over-
sampled. Seventy percent (14,407 of 20,729 persons) of the
NHANES I cohort were medically examined. The NHANES
I Epidemiologic Follow-up Study (NHEFS) is a longitudinal
study of participants who were between 25 and 74 years old
during the 1971­1975 interviews.15,16 The first follow-up study
was conducted in 1982 and included all persons aged 5­74
years at the NHANES I assessment (n = 14,407). Participants
were subsequently interviewed in 1986, 1987, and 1992. The
1982 follow-up interview included data on self-reported medi-
cal conditions and an assessment of depression based on the
Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D).
For this investigation, we analyzed data on participants in the
NHEFS cohort who completed the CES-D in 1982 and were
followed until the 1992 interview date.
Definitions of HTN and depression. Self-reported HTN was
based on a "yes" response to the question, "Have you ever been
told by a doctor that you have hypertension?" Although this
question does not equate to a diagnosis of HTN, it has been
validated as a screen for HTN in epidemiologic studies.18­20
A positive screen for depression in the NHEFS study was
defined using the CES-D, a validated self-report scale for
assessing depression in the general population.21 The scale
consists of 20 items rated on a four-point scale with response
categories indicating the frequency of occurrence of each
item in the previous week. The four-point scale ranges from
0 (rarely or none of the time) to 3 (most or all of the time).
Scores for items 4, 8, 12, and 16 are reversed before scores for
the 20 items are summed. Total scores range from 0 to 60 with
higher scores indicating more depressive symptoms. A cutoff
of 16 has been used extensively for distinguishing depressed
from nondepressed patients. The CES-D is a valid and reliable
instrument for assessing depression in community samples
with high internal consistency, good construct and concurrent
validity, and modest test­retest reliability.21­24
Defining the study cohort. We defined our cohort as the 10,025
individuals who were alive and interviewed in 1982 and who
had complete data for the CES-D. Of the 14,407 respondents
eligible for inclusion in the 1982 follow-up study, 13,383 were
traced, 11,361 were living, and 10,523 were interviewed.16 We
excluded 498 individuals who either did not have complete data
for the CES-D or were missing data for covariates. We divided
the cohort into four groups based on the presence or absence
of self-reported HTN and depressive symptoms (defined as
CES-D 16) in 1982 as follows: (i) individuals without HTN
and without depression (No HTN/No DEP), (ii) individuals
without HTN but with depression (No HTN/DEP), (iii) indi-
viduals with HTN but without depression (HTN/No DEP), and
(iv) individuals with both HTN and depression (HTN/DEP).
Baseline data collection. Demographic, lifestyle behavior,
and comorbidity information were collected as part of the
1982 interview. We included age (in years) as a continuous
variable. Race/ethnicity was categorized as white vs. black/
other. Poverty/income ratio was defined as percentage of the
US federal poverty level and classified as <125, 125­399, and
400%. Education was categorized as <high-school graduate,
high-school graduate, or >high-school graduate, and marital
status was classified as not married or married. BMI was calcu-
lated from self-reported weight and height and categorized as
normal weight (18.5­24.9), overweight (25.0­29.9), and obese
(30.0). Smoking was grouped as never, former, or current
smoker, and physical activity based on the individual's engage-
ment in usual recreational activity was categorized as regular,
light, or sedentary. Self-reported aspirin use was dichotomized
as yes vs. no. In addition, respondents were asked to report
previously diagnosed medical conditions, including diabetes,
heart disease, stroke, and cancer.
Outcome measures. The main outcome measures were all-
cause mortality and IHD mortality across the four groups
in the cohort. Follow-up data were collected in four waves:
1982­1984, 1986, 1987, and 1992. For each wave, patient
or proxy interviews were conducted and health-care facil-
ity records as well as death certificates were obtained. Death
for each cohort member was ascertained through a search
of the National Death Index or through tracing of vital
status via a proxy interview. The reliability of the National
Death Index for epidemiological studies has been previously
validated.25,26 Length of follow-up for each individual was
calculated from the date of the baseline interview (1982­
1984) to either the date of death or the date of last follow-up
at which patients without confirmed death were presumed
alive and lost to follow-up.
Statistical analysis. Statistical analysis was performed with
SAS27 and SUDAAN28 and the approach recommended by the
National Center for Health Statistics for analyzing the NHEFS
was used.29 Means or proportions of baseline risk factors were
calculated for the reference group (No HTN/No DEP) and
the other three groups (No HTN/DEP, HTN/No DEP, and
HTN/DEP). All-cause mortality rates per 1,000 person-years
of follow-up were calculated for the four groups. Life expect-
ancy and survival times for the four groups were estimated by
the Kaplan­Meier product-limit method. Cox proportional
hazards regression models were used to calculate multivari-
ate-adjusted HRs of death for each group compared with the
reference group (model 1). A series of sequential multivariate
explanatory models were developed that included potentially
confounding sociodemographic and clinical variables. Model
2 incorporated sociodemographic variables suspected of influ-
encing the outcomes for hypertensive patients. Model 3 incor-
porated variables for lifestyle and behavioral variables such as
physical activity, smoking, and aspirin use. Model 4 incorpo-
rated adjustments for comorbid illnesses including diabetes
mellitus, cancer, stroke, and coronary heart disease. Similar
models were developed with IHD as the outcome of interest.
We performed post hoc tests to assess for interaction between

self-reported HTN and high CES-D score. We also developed
models using HTN/DEP as the reference group to determine
whether hazard ratios for death from all causes and from IHD
were significantly different between the HTN/DEP and HTN/
No DEP groups. The assumption of proportionality of hazard
was assessed for the four HTN/depression 
classification groups
and each study covariate; all multivariate models satisfied this
assumption.
Results
In this nationally representative sample of 10,025 adults fol-
lowed for an average duration of 8 years (83,943 person-years of
follow-up), 1,925 (19%) of the study subjects died. Table 1 shows
the baseline characteristics of the study participants. In general,
the group of individuals with both HTN and 
depression were
older, included more women, included more ethnic minorities,
were more likely to have sedentary lifestyles, more likely to be

overweight/obese, and more likely to have history of depression,
heart disease, and stroke at baseline compared with the other
three groups. Individuals with both HTN and depression also
tended to be poorer, less educated, and less likely to be married
at baseline compared with individuals in the other three groups.
Table 2 presents models for multivariate-adjusted HRs of
death from all causes according to HTN and depression sta-
tus at the 1982 interview. Unadjusted HRs are presented in
model 1. After incorporation of sociodemographic variables
(model 2), the HRs for all comparison groups were statistically
higher than the reference group, but the highest HR was 1.69
(95% confidence interval (CI) 1.41, 2.02) in the HTN/DEP
group. After incorporation of lifestyle and behavioral variables
(model 3), the HRs for the No HTN/DEP and the HTN/DEP
groups were slightly attenuated at 1.45 (95% CI 1.16, 1.82) and
1.61 (95% CI 1.32, 1.95), respectively. Finally, after incorpora-
tion of comorbid disease variables into the model (model 4),
the HRs for the No HTN/DEP, HTN/No DEP, and HTN/DEP
groups were all attenuated at 1.35 (95% CI 1.09, 1.67), 1.19
(95% CI 1.05, 1.35), and 1.39 (95% CI 1.14, 1.69), respectively.
Tests for interaction between self-reported HTN and CES-D-
positive for depressive symptoms were performed in all models
(1­4), and no significant interactions were found using prod-
uct terms. In post hoc analyses individuals with HTN and no
depression (HTN, No DEP) had a significantly lower adjusted
hazard ratio for death from all causes compared to those with
HTN and comorbid depression (HTN, DEP) (HR 0.85, 95%
CI 0.73­1.00).
Table 3 presents models for the multivariate-adjusted
HRs of death from IHD. Model 1 presents unadjusted HRs
for IHD mortality. After incorporation of sociodemographic
variables (model 2), the HRs for all comparison groups were
statistically higher than the reference group, but the highest
HR was 2.00 (95% CI 1.39, 2.87) observed in the HTN/DEP
group. After incorporation of lifestyle and behavioral varia-
bles (model 3), the HRs for the No HTN/DEP and the HTN/
DEP groups were slightly attenuated at 1.67 (95% CI 1.08,
2.58) and 1.86 (95% CI 1.29, 2.69), respectively. Finally, after
incorporation of comorbid disease variables into the model
(model 4), the HRs for the No HTN/DEP, HTN/No DEP, and
HTN/DEP groups were all attenuated at 1.54 (95% CI 1.01,
2.36), 1.38 (95% CI 1.04, 1.84), and 1.59 (95% CI 1.08, 2.34),
respectively. Tests for interaction between self-reported HTN
and CES-D-positive for depressive symptoms were per-
formed in all models (1­4), and no significant interactions
were found using product terms. In post hoc analyses, the
point estimate for the adjusted hazard ratio for individuals
with HTN and no depression (HTN, No DEP) compared
to those with HTN and comorbid depression (HTN, DEP)
trended lower, but this was not statistically significant (HR
0.87, 95% CI 0.63­1.20).
Discussion
This is the first study to compare the specific association of
depressive symptoms with all-cause and IHD mortality in
people with HTN using a nationally representative data set
that incorporates adjustment for comorbid diseases. The
study provides evidence that over a mean follow-up period
of 8 years, the coexistence of HTN and depressive symptoms
is associated with significantly increased risk of death from
all causes. The strength of this association was diminished
somewhat after controlling for sociodemographic, behav-
ior/lifestyle, and comorbid disease variables in sequential
multivariate-adjusted models. However, even after adjusting
for clinically relevant confounders, people with self-reported
HTN still had a significant 15% lower relative hazard for death
when compared to the group with both self-reported HTN
and depressive symptoms.
We observed similar trends toward increased IHD mortal-
ity in patients with comorbid HTN and depression, but this
did not reach statistical significance. There are several poten-
tial reasons for this observation. First, the smaller number
of IHD deaths may have limited our power to observe a dif-
ference in IHD mortality between the two groups. Second,
it is possible that a significant number of patients evaluated
in 1982 may have been classified as nonhypertensive who
would be considered hypertensive based on current guide-
lines. The second iteration of guidelines published by the Joint
National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation,
and Treatment of High Blood Pressure that were in effect at

original contributions Hypertension, Depression, and Mortality
this study's inception specified a systolic blood pressure of
>160mmHg and a diastolic BP of >95mmHg as a threshold
for the diagnosis of HTN.30 Also at this time, only about 51%
of patients were aware of their diagnosis of HTN.31 By 2003,
the threshold for diagnosing HTN was >140/90 (>130/80 for
patients with diabetes mellitus or chronic kidney disease),
and the proportion of patients aware of their HTN was up to
70% (refs. 1,32). If a significant proportion of hypertensive
patients were included in the "no HTN group", then this would
tend to minimize the risk difference between the two groups.
Additionally, there may have been crossover between groups if
patients developed HTN during the 8-year follow-up. If "con-
tamination" and crossover were significant, this may explain
why there was also no difference in cardiovascular mortality
between the group of hypertensive individuals with and with-
out comorbid depression.
Anda et al. previously described a relationship between
symptoms of depressed affect/hopelessness and subsequent
IHD morbidity and mortality in the NHANES I NHEFS study
cohort. These investigators found that the relative risk of
fatal IHD was 1.5 (95% CI 1.0, 2.3) for depressed affect, and
1.6 (95% CI 1.0, 2.5) for feelings of hopelessness using items
from the General Well-Being Schedule depression sub-scale
(GWB-D). A separate group has reported a significant cor-
relation between positive screen for depressive symptoms on
GWB-D and CES-D (0.71, P < 0.01) in the NHANES I NHEFS
cohort.33 NHEFS patients received the CES-D and two items
of the GWB-D during follow-up interviews, and 83 and 89%
of patients were classified in the same (depressed/nonde-
pressed) category on follow-up exam by the CES-D and GWB,
respectively.
Our report differs from the prior report by Anda et al. in sev-
eral important ways. First, our analysis uses the CES-D in place
of the GWB depression scale. The CES-D has better reported
sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of all depressive
syndromes when compared to the gold standard structured
clinical exam.21­24 Second, our analysis also looks at all-cause
mortality in addition to IHD mortality. Third, Anda et al. did
not include HTN in their models. In fact, they specifically
excluded respondents with baseline comorbid coronary artery
disease/angina pectoris, diabetes mellitus, stroke, and conges-
tive heart failure from their sample.
It is important for clinicians to appreciate the risk of comor-
bid depression in their patients with HTN for several reasons.
First, depression has been shown to be a predictor of incident
HTN.34 Second, depression has been shown to adversely affect
adherence to medical therapy for HTN.35,36 This study supports
the notion that there is an additional mortality risk associated
with comorbid HTN and depression. The biologic mecha-
nisms underlying this observed association are not clear, but
it is possible that increased burden of chronic diseases includ-
ing depression may contribute to increased allostatic load in
affected patients.37 Finally, there is emerging evidence that inte-
grated treatment strategies that target both HTN and depres-
sion simultaneously are safe and have the potential to improve
outcomes in primary care and subspecialty settings.38­41
The approach in this study has several strengths in that it
features a large, nationally representative sample prospectively
followed for a relatively long interval with available informa-
tion on key risk factors. This approach does have some limita-
tions. First, data were based on self-report, which might allow
misclassification. However, available evidence suggests that
self-reported information on chronic diseases and cardiovas-
cular risk factors are accurate.18,20,42­44
Second, the diagnosis of depression was not based on clinical
interview, the gold standard for diagnosis. However, the CES-D
is a well-validated and accepted tool for use in screening large
populations for depression.21­24 Third, it is possible that there
was some misclassification of HTN status given the evolution
of our understanding of HTN risk and diagnostic guidelines
over time. As discussed above, this phenomenon, if present,
would tend to underestimate the between-group differences.
Another important limitation of this study is the lack of infor-
mation regarding the severity of HTN in this data set given that
the degree of both systolic and diastolic BP elevation has a lin-
ear relationship to cardiovascular disease risk and mortality.45
In summary, both HTN and depression are highly prevalent
conditions conferring significant risk for overall morbidity and
mortality. This analysis of data from a nationally representative
sample of adults with prospective follow-up helps to confirm

this fact. This analysis further suggests that among patients
with self-reported HTN, comorbid depressive symptoms are
associated with increased all-cause mortality. This has sig-
nificant implications for health-care providers who will want
to identify comorbid HTN and depression and institute treat-
ment plans for both conditions.
