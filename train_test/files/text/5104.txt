Introduction
A reflex seizure is defined as a seizure that is objectively
and consistently precipitated by environmental or inter-
nal stimuli. It is differentiated from spontaneous epilep-
tic seizures, in which precipitating factors cannot be
identified.1 Reflex epilepsy syndrome is therefore one in
which all seizures are precipitated by sensory stimuli.
However, some authors suggest that this definition is too
restrictive and only the majority of seizures need to be
precipitated by sensory stimuli to constitute a reflex epi-
lepsy syndrome.2 Audiogenic reflex seizures describe
those predominantly induced by sounds.
Reflex seizures may occur in humans with idiopathic,
symptomatic or probably symptomatic epilepsies.2
Reflex seizures are reported to be either generalised,
such as absences (non-convulsive), myoclonic jerks or
tonic­clonic seizures, or focal.1 A specific stimulus may
result in isolated absences, myoclonic jerks or general-
ised tonic­clonic seizures (GTCSs), or may cause combi-
nations of all three. Patients may exhibit reflex and
spontaneous seizures.2 Myoclonic jerks are by far the
most common type of reflex seizures and may manifest
initially in the limbs and body, or focally involving just
the face or a single limb. Reflex absence seizures are
common in people, with reflex focal seizures being much
less common.
In summary, reflex seizures can occur with any epi-
lepsy type and the stimulus may be very specific.
Numerous epileptic seizure syndromes involving reflex
seizures are described, although a robust classification
scheme for reflex epilepsies remains elusive.

Abstract
Objectives This study aimed to characterise feline audiogenic reflex seizures (FARS).
Methods An online questionnaire was developed to capture information from owners with cats suffering from FARS.
This was collated with the medical records from the primary veterinarian. Ninety-six cats were included.
Results Myoclonic seizures were one of the cardinal signs of this syndrome (90/96), frequently occurring prior to
generalised tonic­clonic seizures (GTCSs) in this population. Other features include a late onset (median 15 years)
and absence seizures (6/96), with most seizures triggered by high-frequency sounds amid occasional spontaneous
seizures (up to 20%). Half the population (48/96) had hearing impairment or were deaf. One-third of cats (35/96)
had concurrent diseases, most likely reflecting the age distribution. Birmans were strongly represented (30/96).
Levetiracetam gave good seizure control. The course of the epilepsy was non-progressive in the majority (68/96),
with an improvement over time in some (23/96). Only 33/96 and 11/90 owners, respectively, felt the GTCSs and
myoclonic seizures affected their cat's quality of life (QoL). Despite this, many owners (50/96) reported a slow
decline in their cat's health, becoming less responsive (43/50), not jumping (41/50), becoming uncoordinated or
weak in the pelvic limbs (24/50) and exhibiting dramatic weight loss (39/50). These signs were exclusively reported
in cats experiencing seizures for >2 years, with 42/50 owners stating these signs affected their cat's QoL.
Conclusions and relevance In gathering data on audiogenic seizures in cats, we have identified a new epilepsy
syndrome named FARS with a geriatric onset. Further studies are warranted to investigate potential genetic
predispositions to this condition.

Original Article

We have become increasingly aware of audiogenic
reflex seizures in cats. A questionnaire-based method
was used to gather data to better define and characterise
the phenotype of feline audiogenic reflex seizures
(FARS). The purpose of this article is to provide a descrip-
tion of this syndrome.
Materials and methods
Case recruitment
Cases were recruited via the veterinary media (The
Veterinary Times and Veterinary Record), the internet
(solicitation on cat forums, Facebook and the
International Cat Care website) and the international
press (radio and newspaper driven) asking primary vet-
erinarians and owners to contact us regarding suspected
cases of audiogenic seizures in cats. Pedigrees, medical
history information, litter information and cheek swab
samples for DNA isolation were collected where possi-
ble. A detailed invitation-only questionnaire was pre-
pared and was preceded by owner interview via
telephone conversation or email in which an open
description of the seizure types was given by the owner.
On obtaining a description considered compatible with a
seizure (as determined by one of the authors [ML]) the
questionnaire invitation was given. Where available,
video recordings of episodes were reviewed to charac-
terise that the episodes truly represented an epileptic sei-
zure. In the cases recruited via primary veterinarians, a
full history was also requested and reviewed. If the
owner had contacted us directly and was included in the
study, consent was obtained to request and review the
history from their primary veterinarian. This history
supplemented the information gained from the ques-
tionnaire. Data were acquired from September 2013 to
March 2014.
Questionnaire design
The questions used in this questionnaire are detailed in
the Supplementary material. The questionnaire was
divided into four sections, with each section having its
own purpose. The questionnaire contained numerous
open-ended questions, to which the answer was recorded
verbatim, followed by specific leading questions. The
majority of questions were closed questions with multi-
ple choice answers. In order to ensure they were correctly
excluded, questions were also included to help recognise
those participants that did not fulfil the inclusion criteria.
Questions directed towards the types and characteristics
of the episodes also included an opportunity to provide a
description verbatim of the episodes. Where more than
one type of episode was observed, participants were
asked to characterise each individually. The questions
were therefore divided across the sections into those that
screened cats for audiogenic reflex seizures and those
that provided detailed phenotypic information in terms
of the signalment of animals, possible precipitating fac-
tors, general health, therapeutic trials, where relevant,
and the characteristics of the episodes. Questions were
randomised within each section to prevent owners from
drawing conclusions about the expected answer. The
project questionnaire was presented online utilising the
online survey software tool SurveyMonkey (http://
www.surveymonkey.com).
Inclusion criteria
Inclusion criteria were in place to exclude other disease
processes that may be misinterpreted as an epileptic sei-
zure or paroxysmal behaviour. It was important that all
cats had to have suffered three or more GTCSs that had
been precipitated by the same sound stimulus. A GTCS
was considered only if strict criteria were met, notably
the presence of tonic­clonic contractions of all limbs, and
the presence of an altered consciousness with autonomic
signs (specifically urination and/or salivation). A GTCS
was also excluded if the duration was reported to be >5
mins. If other types of episodes were present in addition
to a confirmed GTCS, the features of these episodes were
recorded individually in the questionnaire. A myoclonic
seizure or jerk was considered when there was a sudden,
brief involuntary contraction of a muscle or muscle
group. Absence seizures were considered as the occur-
rence of an abrupt, transient apparent loss of conscious-
ness with no motor activity. All cats had to have at least
a 1 year history of seizures.
Results
There were 128 respondents to the questionnaire. Thirty-
two cats were excluded because they did not meet the
inclusion criteria. This included 16 cats that had suffered
fewer than three GTCSs, 10 cats that had a history of
GTCSs for <1 year, four cats that had no reported auto-
nomic signs during the episodes and two cats that had
seizures reported to be >5 mins in duration.
Signalment
Details on 96 cats were therefore collected; these com-
prised 45 domestic shorthairs, 30 Birmans, six Burmeses
five domestic longhairs, four Bengals, two Maine Coons,
and one of each of British Shorthair, European Shorthair,
Norwegian Forest and Birman cross. Of the Birman cats,
12 (40%) were blue point and 18 (60%) were seal point.
The mean age of the cats at seizure onset was 15 years
(median 15 years; range 10­19 years). Forty-seven cats
were female (64% were neutered; 30/47) and 49 were
male (71% were neutered; 35/49).
Sound stimulus
All seizures, as per the inclusion criteria, occurred follow-
ing a noise stimulus, but in some cats spontaneous myo-
clonic jerks (18/90; 20%) and GTCSs (8/96; 8%) were
330 Journal of Feline Medicine and Surgery 18(4)
observed on rare occasions without an obvious noise
stimulus. All sounds triggering these seizures were high
pitched. The sounds were capable of triggering different
seizure types with no distinct sound predicting or pro-
ducing a distinct seizure pattern. In some cases, a repeated
sound initiated a myoclonic seizure that, when prolonged,
could progress to a GTCS. This phenomenon of audio-
genic kindling was reported in 86 cats. These sounds had
not always caused cats to seizure and could occur without
causing seizures on occasion in 32/96 cats (33%).Avoiding
these noises eliminated seizures in 72/96 cats (75%),
although many owners remarked that the nature of the
sounds made it very difficult to eradicate the seizures
completely. All owners felt they could reliably induce a
seizure by making one of the described trigger noises. The
loudness of the sound (amplitude) also seemed to increase
the severity of seizures, regardless of the type of seizure.
This was reported by 23% (22/96) of owners.
Sound stimuli identified to evoke seizures in cats
included the crinkling of tin foil (n = 82); a metal spoon
dropping into a ceramic feeding bowl (n = 79); the chink-
ing or tapping of glass (n = 72); paper or plastic bags
crinkling (n = 71); computer keyboard tapping or mouse
clicking (n = 61); the clinking of coins or keys (n = 59);
the hammering of a nail (n = 38); the clicking of an own-
er's tongue (n = 24); the sound of breaking the tin foil from
treatment or tablet packaging (n = 12); texting (n = 8);
a digital alarm (n = 6); the sound of Velcro (n = 6); the
clicking of a piezo lighter for a gas stove or the sound
made by igniting the gas hob (n = 4); a mobile phone
ring (n = 4); running water (n = 2); the sound created by
a dog scratching its neck and jangling its collar (n = 2); a
computer printer (n = 2); firewood spitting (n = 1);
wooden building blocks being knocked together (n = 1);
walking on a wooden floor with bare feet or squeaky
shoes (n = 1); and the short, sharp scream of a young
child (n = 1). There were no other reported precipitating
factors that could induce a seizure or make one more
likely to occur.
Clinical features
Apart from GTCSs, cats developed other seizure types
(see Figure 1): myoclonic jerks (90/96; 94%) and clinical
absences or presumed absence seizures (6/96; 6%). The
majority of cats (84/96; 88%), had myoclonic jerks and
GTCSs; with six (6/96; 6%) cats having the triad of
absence seizures, myoclonic jerks and GTCSs. Six cats
(6/96; 6%) had only GTCSs. Absence seizures antedated
myoclonic jerks in all six cats (6/96) with this seizure
type. The first seizure observed by the owner was a
GTCS in 17% (16/96) of cats, a myoclonic seizure in 70%
(67/96) of cats and an absence seizure in 6% (6/96) of
cats. Seven (7/96; 7%) owners were uncertain which sei-
zure type was observed first. All cats were reported to be
normal between the seizures.
GTCSs GTCSs were present in all cats, as per the inclusion
criteria. Therefore, all had an altered consciousness with
episodes lasting <5 mins. Urination was recorded in 74/96
(77%) and salivation in 83/96 (86%) cats. Videos were pro-
vided in three cases, which confirmed their nature as
GTCSs. The seizures never occurred more frequently than
one per 24 h period (ie, no clusters). GTCSs were often
(86/96; 90%) preceded by generalised myoclonic jerks,
most commonly of the head (82/96; 85%). GTCSs indi-
cated their coming just minutes in advance, with a series of
rapid myoclonic jerks of increasing intensity. GTCSs most
commonly occurred at a frequency of one every 3­6
months, although, overall, this was highly variable, with
periods as long as 18 months between seizures.
Fifty-eight cats (82/96; 85%) were ataxic following a
GTCS, with hunger (69/96; 72%), restlessness (42/96;
44%), seeking to be near their owners (21/96; 22%) and
thirst (6/96; 6%) also being reported. These postictal
signs abated within 24 h in all cats. However, many cats
improved within hours (31/96; 32%) or (30/96; 31%)
minutes of a GTCS.
Myoclonic seizuresMyoclonic jerks or seizures without
apparent loss of consciousness were frequently reported
(90/96; 94%). The jerks were described as brief (always
<30 s), commonly bilateral, rhythmic contractions that
mainly started in the head and neck (79/90; 88%) or
occasionally in the back/abdomen (11/90; 12%). How-
ever, all owners reported that the jerking could spread to
involve the shoulders and forelimbs (86/90; 96%), and/
or hips and pelvic limbs (83/90; 92%). Some jerks
occurred unilaterally (12/90; 13%) but none were
reported to involve only a single part of the body. Videos
were provided in 23/96 cats, which confirmed the nature

Lowrie et al 331
of these myoclonic seizures (see video in Supplementary
material). All owners reported that consciousness was
unaffected during these jerks. However, video footage
suggested there was some degree of impairment, albeit
brief. This discrepancy is understandable given the short
duration of the seizures and so impairment of conscious-
ness should be considered likely in these cats.
Myoclonic jerks were more likely to occur in clusters
(88/90; 98%) than as single episodes. The frequency and
intensity of myoclonic jerks varied from up to 20 in a day
to one every 3­6 months. Owners reported that more
violent jerks could result in cats falling to the floor. Rapid
successive jerks would frequently evolve into a GTCS
(86/90; 96%).
The majority of the cats were normal immediately
after a myoclonic episode (88/90; 98%), although two
cats were reported to be more sleepy than normal within
the first few hours only. No other postictal signs were
noted for this type of seizure.
The 16 cats that were excluded because they suffered
fewer than three GTCSs included 14/16 that reported
regular myoclonic jerks in response to specific sounds.
Some of these cats (12/16) had no reported episodes of
GTCSs. However, these cats have not been included in
the study population.
Absence seizures Periods of absence were rarely reported
within this population. Absences were considered when
the owners reported periods of staring with no motor
activity (6/96; 6%). These episodes would almost always
precede myoclonic jerks. Episodes lasted between 30 s
and 1 min in all six cats. Afew seconds after each episode,
the cats were reported to be quieter than usual by the
owners and slower to respond. Postictal signs were var-
ied, with all owners describing sleepiness and a per-
ceived feeling of their cat experiencing disorientation.
These signs could last up to a few hours (4/6; 67%) or
even up to 1 day (2/6; 33%).
Investigations
Diagnostic investigations were pursued in 85/96 cats
(89%). Haematology and biochemistry were performed
in 82/85 cats. Urinalysis (including specific gravity and
dipstick) was performed in 72/85 cats. Blood pressure
recording was performed in 52/85 cats. Magnetic reso-
nance imaging (MRI) of the brain had been performed in
32/85 cats, and computed tomography (CT) in 3/85 cats.
The results of cross-sectional imaging in these 35 cats
were normal. Cerebrospinal fluid investigation was per-
formed in 18 cats and the results were unremarkable.
Toxoplasma and Neospora serology was performed in
48/96 and 12/96 cats, respectively, and revealed no evi-
dence of active infection. Feline leukaemia virus and
feline immunodeficiency virus testing was performed in
12/85 cats and was negative in all.
Concurrent diseases
Concurrent diseases reported by the owners and cor-
roborated by primary veterinary surgeon notes were
diagnosed in 35 cats (35/85; 40%). These included
chronic renal disease (21/85), hyperthyroidism (6/85),
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (3/85), hypertension
(3/85) and diabetes mellitus (2/85). The cats with con-
current diseases did not have a progressive seizure
course, with seizures remaining static in 21/35 and
improving in 14/35 cats.
The mean weight of the cats was 4.2 kg (median 4 kg;
range 2­10 kg). Sixty percent of the cats (58/96) were
described as `eating all meals', with 25% (24/96)
described as picky eaters and 6% (6/96) having a poor
appetite. Eight percent of the cats (8/96) were described
as hungry all the time. Episodes of diarrhoea or vomit-
ing were described as frequent (6%; 6/96), occasional
(42%; 40/96) or infrequent (20%; 19/96), with 31/96 cats
having no reported episodes (32%). Twenty-seven per-
cent of the cats (26/96) were reported to have itchy skin,
excessive licking or feet/ear problems, although no
known allergies were reported by the owners. No own-
ers reported coughing, collapsing or breathing difficul-
ties. Fifty percent of the cats (48/96) were described as
having hearing impairment, including five cats where
the owners considered they were completely deaf.
Sixteen of these cats (16/48) had cross-sectional imaging
of the head (4/16 had CT and 12/16 had MRI), revealing
no obvious cause for this apparent hearing impairment.
Further, 21% (20/96) of cats were described as having
visual impairment, including three cats where the own-
ers thought they were completely blind.
Treatment
Treatment was pursued in 44/96 cats. Fifteen cats had
received phenobarbital and 29 cats had received leveti-
racetam. Among the 15 cats taking phenobarbital, 4/15
(27%) experienced adequate GTCS control, although
only one owner felt it reduced the frequency of the myo-
clonic seizures (7%). The remainder were reported by the
owners to have no change in seizure frequency. All cats
had received this drug for a minimum of 6 weeks before
discontinuing the medication. Serum concentrations
were only available in 3/15 cats and were within pub-
lished reference intervals but dosages were available in
all 15 cats and were considered acceptable. Levetiracetam
gave good control of both the GTCSs and myoclonic sei-
zures in 20/29 (69%) and 27/29 (93%) cats, respectively.
The remaining cats were reported by the owners to have
no change in seizure frequency. Dosages were available
in 27/29 cats and were considered adequate, and all cats
had received the medication for at least 2 months.
Additionally, those cats receiving no medication for sei-
zure control did not appear to progress or deteriorate
during the course of their seizures.

Outcome
Twenty-two cats were dead at the time of writing, all
having been euthanased. All 22 cats had suffered sei-
zures up until the point of euthanasia; therefore, the
average duration of seizures in these cats was 24 months
(range 13­38 months); median duration was 23 months.
The reason for euthanasia was seizure-related in just one
cat. The remaining 21 cats were euthanased owing to
concurrent diseases or a decline in condition.
The onset of epilepsy was highly variable, with single
seizures or clusters being observed. The course of the
epilepsy was non-progressive in the majority of cats
(68/96; 71%), with some owners reporting an improve-
ment with time (23/96; 25%). Thirty-three of 96 (33%)
owners stated that the GTCSs affected their cat's quality
of life (QoL); however, a much lower proportion (12%;
11/90) felt the myoclonic seizures affected their cat's
QoL.
Although the seizures were not a concern to the
majority, many owners (50/96; 52%) reported a slow
decline in their cat's health in that they became incoordi-
nated or weak in the pelvic limbs (24/50), less respon-
sive (43/50), stopped jumping (41/50), experienced
dramatic (>1 kg) weight loss (39/50), toileted inappro-
priately in the house (12/50) and got stuck in corners
(8/50) since seizure onset. However, these signs were
only reported in cats that had experienced seizures for
>2 years. Only nine cats that had experienced seizures
for >2 years were reported to be normal between sei-
zures. Of these 50 cats with a decline in general health,
only eight had been diagnosed with a concurrent dis-
ease. Eighty-four percent (42/50) of owners felt that
these non-seizure signs affected their cat's QoL.
Discussion
FARS are characterised by GTCSs, myoclonic seizures
and absence seizures. In gathering these data the consist-
ency of agreement between owners' responses has identi-
fied a degenerative syndrome of FARS in older cats.
There appears to be no sex bias, although cats exclusively
suffer from FARS later in life within their second decade.
The sounds responsible are high-pitched sounds, often
relatively quiet sounds, with increasing loudness and
persistence of a sound only serving to enhance the sever-
ity of epileptic seizures. Myoclonic jerks or seizures with
or without impairment of consciousness appear as one of
the cardinal signs of FARS, frequently occurring prior to
a GTCS in this population. One-third of the population
was diagnosed with concurrent diseases; however, this
most likely reflected the age of the population rather than
a causal relationship. This rationale is made on the basis
of the static or improving nature of the epilepsy in the
cats with concurrent medical conditions. However, 50%
of the population were reported to have hearing impair-
ment or were deaf. Therapeutic trials with levetiracetam
suggest this may be more suitable than phenobarbital to
control myoclonic seizures and GTCSs associated with
this condition. Although seizures remained relatively
non-progressive, other signs developed that were slowly
progressive exclusively in cats suffering this epilepsy
syndrome for >2 years. However, it cannot be deter-
mined whether this decline was due to concurrent dis-
ease and entirely coincidental to the association of FARS,
or part of the same syndrome.
We found a high number of Birman cats in the study
cohort (31% of cats), strongly suggesting a breed predis-
position to the condition and thus a hereditary tendency.
The ancestry of the Birman is such that the seal and blue
points are the original breed colours and cross-mating
with other breeds such as Persians and Siamese cats
have led to the development of other colours, which
appear unaffected by this syndrome. To date, all known
Birmans with this condition are of the seal and blue point
variety. A recessive or dominant mode of inheritance
seems unlikely based on the limited pedigree data
obtained. It is also important to state that Birmans had
the same clinical features of FARS as cats of other breeds,
so although the Birman may represent a different geno-
type or aetiology, the phenotype was comparable.
Animal models that recapitulate human epilepsies
are a useful and convenient tool for studying epilepsy.
Audiogenic epilepsy in rodents has become one such
influential model, with sound-induced seizures initiated
and driven by a brainstem network independent of the
forebrain ­ so-called `brainstem seizures'.3 The caudal
colliculus is critical for the initiation of audiogenic
seizures.4 Seizure discharges then spread to other brain-
stem nuclei such as the rostral colliculus, pontine reticu-
lar formation and periaqueductal gray.5 Repetitive
acoustic stimulation transforms these midbrain electrical
stimulations into limbic ones. The spread of these sei-
zure discharges to these forebrain structures after such
repetitive stimulation results in the clinical manifesta-
tion of an epileptic seizure. In the context of the cats
reported in this study, the term audiogenic kindling
refers to myoclonic seizures and/or GTCSs, which
develop after numerous daily sound exposures. This
process of epileptic activation of the forebrain by
repeated sound-induced brainstem seizures has been
referred to as audiogenic kindling.6,7
Levetiracetam has been shown to reduce the fre-
quency and progression of audiogenic seizures.8,9 The
antiepileptic effect of levetiracetam against audiogenic
seizures has been found to correlate with the affinity for
the synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2A.10 Mapping of leve-
tiracetam-selective binding sites in the rat brain identi-
fied high concentrations in structures such as the rostral
colliculus and periaqueductal gray; that is, the structures
involved in propagation of brainstem seizures.11 In con-
trast to other antiepileptic drugs, levetiracetam appears
Lowrie et al 333
to exert a more profound antiepileptic effect in kindled
audiogenic seizures than in non-kindled epileptic ani-
mals, supporting the hypothesis put forward by
Klitgaard et al,8 proposing that levetiracetam has
increased efficacy in the kindled epileptic brain.
The results of our study suggest that levetiracetam
may aid in reducing the frequency of audiogenic sei-
zures in cats, as well as their progression (preventing
audiogenic kindling), providing an exciting opportu-
nity to trial levetiracetam therapy for FARS. However,
the small number of cats receiving treatment and the
potential for variability in administration means this
aspect would require further investigation before any
claims are made about levetiracetam being a suitable
choice for epileptic myoclonus and FARS. It is interest-
ing to note that human studies also show that myoclonic
seizures are highly responsive to treatment with
levetiracetam.12­14
The reason for cats being so sensitive to these seem-
ingly benign high-pitch sounds may have an origin in
the ultrasonic hearing range of the species. Mice and rats
communicate in the ultrasonic frequency range (around
40 kHz).15 It is believed that cats developed a secondary
ultrasonic sensitive hearing range at these frequencies,
presumably as an evolutionary advantage in catching
rats and mice; their natural prey.15 Common domestic
noises with a high component of ultrasonic frequencies
­ such as tearing paper, opening cans, jangling keys and
hitting solid surfaces ­ may sound innocuous to us but
actually sound more startling to cats that are sensitive to
these frequencies. Deafness or hearing impairment was
reported in half the cats in this study, and no apparent
cause was found in those in which cross-sectional imag-
ing of the head was performed. We therefore speculate
from our data that sensorineural deafness may be associ-
ated with audiogenic seizures in cats, although these
signs, especially given the age of the population, may
have had no relationship at all to the FARS. Audiogenic
seizures in cats that are deaf seem paradoxical. It is spec-
ulated that cats become susceptible to cochlear damage
as a consequence of age and exposure to loud noises. The
frequency of the noise determines the position on the
cochlea that the irreversible damage to the outer hair
cells occurs.16 Work by Miller et al showed that the main
area of damage was in the middle and lower portions of
the second turn of the cochlea (corresponding to 7600Hz
­ everyday `loud' noises to us) but that the area of the
cochlea associated with detecting higher-frequency
sounds was not affected.16 Therefore, these cats will
appear deaf to us, although complete hearing loss is not
present. Further investigations will be required in this
area before final conclusions are drawn as hearing
impairment was perceived and reported by owners and
was not confirmed clinically, making it impossible to
confirm this clinical feature or its pathogenesis.
An interesting feature of audiogenic seizures in
rodents is that one particular strain displays concurrent
sensorineural deafness. Mutations in GIPC3 have been
found to cause progressive sensorineural hearing loss
and audiogenic seizures (Jams1) in mice and autosomal
recessive deafness in humans.17 Another important set of
proteins in epilepsy are those characterised by the pres-
ence of tandem epilepsy associated repeats, or epitem-
pin as it is also known.18 This family consists of several
proteins,18 including the four members of the LGI (LGI-1,
LG1-2, LG1-3, LG1-4) subfamily and VLGR1.19 Leucine-
rich glioma inactivated protein, a protein-truncating
mutation in LGI2 in the Lagotto Romagnolo dog, results
in benign familial juvenile epilepsy.20 Mutations in Vlgr1
have been found to be responsible for a monogenic form
of auditory seizures in certain strains of mice,21­23 and
are associated with hearing impairment in these same
mice.24 This makes them suitable candidate genes for
genetic analysis in cases of FARS. FARS also share simi-
larities with the progressive myoclonic epilepsies
(PMEs). PMEs are widely reported in humans and are
characterised by myoclonic seizures, tonic­clonic sei-
zures and progressive neurological deterioration, typi-
cally with cerebellar signs and dementia.24 In different
disease entities various types of seizures and neurologi-
cal signs predominate. Myoclonus in PME is typically
fragmentary and multifocal, and is often triggered by an
environmental or internal stimulus.25 The age of onset,
presenting signs, predominance of signs such as sei-
zures, or myoclonus over cerebellar signs and dementia
vary substantially across the different disorders. In
humans, there are five main causes of PME that have
been more accurately defined with recent advances in
genetic studies: Lafora disease, neuronal ceroid lipofus-
cinosis (NCLs), myoclonic epilepsy with ragged red
fibres, Unverricht­Lundborg disease (UCL) and siali-
doses.25 Only Lafora disease, NCLs and UCL have been
associated with reflex seizures. However, few are
reported in veterinary medicine, with only Lafora dis-
ease and several different subtypes of the NCLs having
been shown to have a clear genetic cause.26­34
Lafora disease has been reported in dogs,26,35­45 and
has some clinical correlation with FARS in that reflex
myoclonic seizures are a feature. The disease has a late
onset (median 7 years of age) with a slowly progressive
course,26,35­37 similar to the cats reported herein. The
myoclonic seizures may occur in response to auditory
and/or visual stimuli.35­37,46­48 Lafora disease in
Miniature Wirehaired Dachshunds has been shown to be
caused by the recessive inheritance of a biallelic expan-
sion of a dodecamer repeat in the malin gene (EPM2B or
NHLRC1).26 Mutations for the human disease have also
been identified in the laforin (EPM2A) and the malin
(EPM2B or NHLRC1) genes,49­51 making these candi-
dates for FARS.

The NCLs are a group of inherited PMEs resulting
from lysosomal storage disorders. They typically cause
myoclonic seizures, often in the terminal phase, along-
side other degenerative neurological signs. Eight genes
have now been described in canine NCLs: PPT1,27 TPP1
or CLN2,28 CLN5,29 CLN6,30 CLN8,31 CTSD,32 ATP13A233
and ARSG.34 In general, the descriptions of cats with
NCLs report progressive visual dysfunction and pro-
foundneurologicaldeclineinanimalsexclusivelyyounger
than 2 years of age.52­56 Myoclonic seizures are only
reported in end-stage disease. No gene defects have as
yet been identified in feline NCLs.55,56
The nature of this study meant that set criteria were
necessary for the phenotype and for inclusion of cats in
the study ­ this may be helpful for performing a genetic
study, which will form the second part of our investiga-
tions. Initial recognition of this disorder requires a select
collection of cases using defined criteria. However, it is
important to note that other seizure types, such as
absence and myoclonic seizures, are likely to occur as the
sole seizure type in this syndrome. As an example, it is
interesting to note that 12/16 excluded cats had myo-
clonic jerks alone with no GTCSs. Conversely, it is pos-
sible that some cats presented here may have suffered
absence seizures that the owners had not previously rec-
ognised. Furthermore, it is known that the frequency
and intensity of myoclonic jerks varies. For instance, in
humans they may be perceived only internally, as an
electric shock-like sensation. For this reason it is possible
that owners underestimated the number of episodes that
their cat was suffering. Therefore, the reliance upon clin-
ical historical evidence is likely to overstate the preva-
lence of GTCS when compared with absences and
myoclonic seizures. The spectrum of this syndrome can
be further defined should a genetic marker become
apparent for this condition.
It is accepted that this study has a number of limita-
tions; not least the fact that we were relying on owner
accounts, albeit with clinical correlation to the medical
history provided by primary veterinarians and video
footage (in 24% cats). For example, clinical confir
mation of hearing impairment would require brainstem
auditory-evoked response or some other form of audi-
torytesting,whichwasnotperformedhere.Furthermore,
histopathological examination has not been performed,
making it difficult to know if one disease process is more
likely than another. However, the consistent observa-
tions of this syndrome, combined with the large number
of cats and stringent inclusion criteria, suggest that this
has not adversely affected our results. It is accepted that
the inclusion of cats with absence seizures is debatable
as this seizure type has never been reported in this spe-
cies. However, these individuals had the features that
allowed inclusion in our cohort as audiogenic seizures
and, given the consistent descriptions by their owners of
absence seizures, it is worthy of mention in this report.
However, electroencephalography would be required to
confirm or refute this finding, and to further characterise
the myoclonic jerks and GTCSs.
Conclusions
This study has defined a previously unreported syn-
drome by using a carefully screened questionnaire and
medical records. In doing this it has allowed a large
cohort to be examined with the purposes of genotyping
this syndrome. The geriatric nature of this condition is
such that it may be overlooked in older cats that may
potentially suffer from other concurrent conditions, and
so this study serves a purpose in informing veterinary
practitioners of this syndrome. The phenotype is likely
to be broader than that described but specific criteria
were applied to ensure a homogeneous population.
Work is ongoing to identify the genetic basis of this
disorder.
Supplementary material  The following files are available:
A copy of the questionnaire given to owners of cats with sus-
pected feline audiogenic reflex seizures. Three short video clips:
(1) a cat exhibiting characteristic myoclonic jerks in response to
a noise stimulus; (2) a different cat suffering myoclonic seizures
triggered by sound progressing into a generalised tonic­clonic
seizure; (3) an audiogenic generalised tonic­clonic seizure in an
elderly Birman cat.
