Abstract
Objective: Cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) is a significant disease in south-eastern Anatolia because
it is prevalent among Syrian refugees. We identified the causative Leishmania species in CL patients
using molecular methods.
Methods: Novy­MacNeal­Nicolle medium was inoculated with aspirated fluid from suspected CL
lesions and tested for amastigotes with Giemsa staining. PCR amplified the internal transcribed
spacer 1 (ITS1) of the Leishmania genome in cultures containing Leishmania promastigotes from
100 patients, which were genotyped with a restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP)
analysis. A phylogenetic tree was constructed from ITS1 sequences of 95 culture fluid samples from
these patients.
Results: Leishmania amastigotes were detected in 92% of cultures with growth. Leishmania
promastigotes were typed as Leishmania tropica with both PCR­RFLP and sequencing.
Conclusions: Identification of L. tropica as the causative agent of CL in our region allows the
clinical course to be predicted, and guides treatment decisions and preventive measures.

Introduction
As in other parts of the world, cutaneous
leishmaniasis (CL) is a major public health
problem in Turkey. Anthroponotic CL
caused by Leishmania tropica has been
reported in Turkey since 1883, sometimes

occurring as epidemics. Leishmaniasis is
endemic to many countries in Africa,
America, Asia, and Europe, but the majority
of CL cases (> 90%) occur in Afghanistan,
Brazil, Iran, Peru, Saudi Arabia, and
Syria.1,2 Recently, millions of Syrians have
entered Turkey in response to conflicts in the
Syrian Arab Republic and are still residing
in this country. Although refugee camps
have been established in many cities, includ-
ing Gaziantep, many Syrian refugees are
also living in other parts of Turkey.3
The accurate diagnosis of CL, its treat-
ment, disease prevention, strategies for its
control, and management decisions require
the identification of the causative species
of the Leishmania parasite.4­6 The diagnosis
of CL is based on clinical features
and laboratory tests, including a direct
parasitological examination and/or indirect
testing with serology and molecular diag-
nostics.7 A universal PCR method targeting
the internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS1)
region, which occurs between the genes
encoding 18S rRNA and 5.8S rRNA, has
proved useful in the direct diagnosis and
identification of the Leishmania parasite
because this region is highly conserved
among species.8
Anthroponotic CL caused by L. tropica is
highly endemic in south-eastern Anatolia
and the eastern Mediterranean and Aegean
regions of Turkey. In south Anatolia, both
L. infantum and L. tropica have been
reported as the causative agents of human
CL. Leishmania major is known to be
endemic in the countries bordering southern
Turkey: Syria, Iraq, and Iran.9 In Syria,
CL has two forms: zoonotic CL caused by
L. major and anthroponotic CL caused by
L. tropica.10
In this study, we identified the causative
Leishmania species using PCR­restriction
fragment length polymorphism (RFLP)
and sequencing analyses of patients diag-
nosed with CL.
Materials and methods
Study population
Approval for this study was obtained
from the Ethics Committee of Gaziantep
University Faculty of Medicine (reference
number: 221). In total, 458 patients were
enrolled in the treatment program, including
433 patients of Syrian origin (94.5%) resid-
ing in refugee camps and 25 Turkish citizens
(5.5%) with a diagnosis of CL, who were
referred by primary and secondary health-
care facilities in the city of Gaziantep to the
Leishmaniasis Detection and Treatment
Center established at the Department of
Dermatology and Sexually Transmitted
Diseases in Gaziantep University Sahinbey
Research and Practice Hospital between
April 2014 and April 2015. The diagnosis
of CL was made based on clinical features
and microscopic Æ culture methods that
detected the presence of amastigotes in
suspected CL lesions of the patients.11,12
Of these patients, 100 (96 Syrian refugees
and four Turkish citizens) in whom promas-
tigotes were demonstrated in culture were
included in the study to detect and type the
Leishmania parasites. The mean age of our
patients (62% males, 38% females) was 19.4
years. Culture fluids from these 100 patients
were analysed with PCR­RFLP, and a
sequencing analysis was also performed in
95 of these patients to type the Leishmania
parasite.
Sampling
To collect aspiration fluid from the lesion
sites, 0.5 ml of a sterile 0.9% sodium chlor-
ide (NaCl) solution was drawn into a syr-
inge. After the lesion site was cleaned with
70% alcohol, the lesion was penetrated with
the syringe through the margin of the lesion
close to the intact skin. Sterile NaCl solution
was delivered into the lesion and the intra-
lesional fluid was collected into the syringe.

si et al. 115
The aspiration fluid was used to inoculate
Now­McNeal­Nicolle culture medium
(Besimik Ltd, Sti, Turkey), and a portion
of the collected sample was transferred onto
a clean slide to prepare a smear. The smear
was then stained with Giemsa staining solu-
tion and examined under a light microscope
(Olympus CX31, Tokyo, Japan) with a
100Â objective lens. Preparations showing
amastigotes were considered to be positive
(þ) for Leishmania spp. and preparations
with no amastigotes were considered nega-
tive (­) for Leishmania spp. All results were
recorded. The inoculated culture tubes were
stored at 23­25C and monitored every
second day for 1 month for the presence of
promastigotes. Promastigotes were detected
with a direct microscopic examination and
Giemsa staining of the culture fluid.11 The
samples of culture fluid containing promas-
tigotes were collected in sterile Eppendorf
tubes and stored at À80C until typing.
Isolation of Leishmania DNA
Leishmania spp. DNA was isolated from the
culture fluids with the QIAamp DNA Mini
Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and stored
at À20C.
PCR­RFLP analysis of ITS1 region
The forward primer (LITSR) 50-CTGGATC
ATTTTCCGATG-30 and reverse primer
(L5.8S) 50-TGATACCACTTATCGCAC
TT-30, specific to the ribosomal ITS1
region that occurs between the genes encod-
ing the small subunit (18S) ribosomal RNA
and 5.8S rRNA, were used in this study.13,14
A 50 ml reaction mix was prepared in a PCR
tube by adding 1 ml of 10 nmol forward
primer, 1 ml of 10 nmol reverse primer, 25 ml
of the Taq 2Â master mix (25 mM Taq 2Â
master mix; New England Biolabs Inc.,
UK), 13 ml of nuclease-free water, and
10 ml of template DNA. The 50 ml reaction
mix was processed in a thermal cycler
(Explera, Olly 96, Italy) using the pro-
grammed PCR protocol: one cycle at 95C
for 30 s; 30 cycles of 20 s at 95C, 40 s at
56C, and 60 s at 68C; one cycle at 68C for
5 min; and hold at 4C. A 1.5% agarose gel
was prepared containing 3.75 g of agarose
(AB Analitica, Italy), 250 ml of 10Â TBE
solution (Bio Basic Canada Inc., Canada),
and 25 ml of ethidium bromide (Amresco
Inc., OH, USA). A 10 ml aliquot of the PCR
product was loaded onto the agarose gel
together with 10-bp and 100-bp markers and
the DNA of L. infantum, L. major, and
L. tropica reference strains (as the positive
controls), after combination with 3 ml of
loading dye. The samples were run on the
agarose gel for 1­1.5 h at 80 mA and 130 V,
and visualized with a UV transilluminator
(UVP Upland, USA). The DNA of refer-
ence strains L. infantum MHOM/TN/1980/
IPT1, L. major MHOM/IR/173, and
L. tropica MHOM/AZ/1974/SAF-K27 was
used in the analysis.
RFLP
The RFLP procedure was performed with
the HaeIII restriction enzyme (New England
BioLabs, Inc.).13 In this step, 2.5 ml of 10Â
buffer, 1.5 ml of H2
O, 1 ml of HaeIII restric-
tion enzyme, and 15 ml of PCR product were
added to a PCR tube and incubated at 37C
for 2 h. A 2% agarose gel was prepared
containing 5 g of Metaphor agarose
(BioShop Canada Inc., Canada), 250 ml of
10Â TBE solution (Bio Basic Canada Inc.),
and 25 ml of ethidium bromide (Amresco
Inc.). The PCR products digested with the
restriction enzyme were loaded onto the gel
together with 10-bp and 100-bp markers and
the DNA of the L. infantum, L. major, and
L. tropica reference strains (as positive con-
trols), after combination with 3 ml of loading
dye. The samples were run for 3­4 h at
80 mA and 130 V, and visualized with a
116 Journal of International Medical Research 45(1)
UV transilluminator (UVP Inc., Upland,
CA, USA). The samples were evaluated by
comparing them with the markers and posi-
tive controls (Figure 1).
Sequencing the ITS1 region
The DNA extracted from the Leishmania
samples was analysed in the laboratories of
Iontek Anonim Sirketi (Iontec A.S.,
Istanbul, Turkey). The extracted DNA was
amplified by PCR using primers specific for
Leishmania. The primers used for sequen-
cing (LITSR 50-CTGGATCATTTTCCGA
TG-30 and L5.8S 50-TGATACCACTTATC
GCACTT-30) targeted the ITS1 region.
After the PCR procedure, the PCR product
was run on an agarose gel together with a
marker of known size and concentration to
check whether the PCR reaction had
occurred. The samples visualized on the gel
were purified and then sequenced with an
ABI Prism 310 Genetic Analyzer using an
ABI PRISMÕ BigDye Terminator Cycle
Sequencing Kit. A BLAST search (http://
blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi) was per-
formed for all the sequences and the
sequences were typed.
A phylogenetic tree was constructed by
the Iontek Anonim Sirketi laboratory (Iontec
A.S.). The phylogenetic relationships were
inferred from an ITS1 nucleotide sequence
alignment produced with the MAFFT mul-
tiple alignment program using a combin-
ation of the E-INS-i alignment options.15
`Neighbor joining method conserved sites'
was chosen as the method of phylogenetic
tree construction. For the bootstrap ana-
lysis, 1000 re-samplings was assigned in the
program code.
Results
The 100 patient samples that showed growth
of Leishmania promastigotes in culture were
included in the study and genotyped. A light
microscopic examination of the aspirated
samples stained with Giemsa staining solu-
tion showed the presence of Leishmania
amastigotes in 92 (92%) patients and an
absence of amastigotes in the remaining
eight patients (8%). A PCR­RFLP analysis
of the DNA from the Leishmania promasti-
gotes grown in culture identified all of them
as L. tropica (Figure 1). A sequencing ana-
lysis of 95 of the Leishmania DNA samples

Discussion
Leishmaniasis is endemic in more than
80 countries. Its overall global prevalence
is estimated to be around 12 million cases
and this figure increases by 1.5­2 million
each year.16 According to data for 2008
from the World Health Organization
(WHO), CL occurs in 82 countries and 1.5
million new cases are recorded every year.17
Migration, travel, and ecological changes
contribute to this increase. Host, parasite,
and vector characteristics determine the
occurrence and course of the disease.2 CL
is highly prevalent in our neighbouring
countries of Iraq, Iran, and Syria and there
are massive migratory flows into Turkey
from these countries, both controlled and
uncontrolled. According to a report issued
by the United Nations High Commissioner
for Refugees, 2,750,000 Syrian refugees are
currently living in Turkey. Some Syrians
with manifest CL have come to Turkey and
live in camps or various cities.3 According to
a WHO Report of 2010, Syria is one of the
countries most affected by CL, with more
than 25,000 cases per year.18 CL has been
endemic in the Aleppo region of Syria for a
very long time. However, there has been a
gradual increase in the number of cases
reported since the 1990s, with a maximum
number of 58,156 cases reported in 2011 in
the Idlib, Hamah, and Halab Provinces.19
An outbreak has occurred with the current
war in Syria and measures to combat the
disease are lacking, particularly in the
besieged and medically underserved areas.
New publications from the Turkish Ministry
of Health reveal shocking statistics. An
incidence rate of 53,000 cases was observed
in 2012, and 41,000 cases were reported in
the first 6 months of 2013.20
The identification of the different species
of the Leishmania parasite is based on an
isoenzyme analysis or molecular biological
methods.21 In the present study, Leishmania
promastigotes isolated from patient samples
were typed with PCR­RFLP and DNA
sequencing using primers specific for the
ITS1 region. The ITS1 fragment that were
similar to those obtained with standard
Leishmania strains was chosen as the target
for the diagnostic PCR analysis,22 because
ITS1 of the ribosomal DNA repeat unit has
previously been used to distinguish Old
World Leishmania species using RFLP
and DNA sequencing.22,23 The sensitivity
of the ITS1 analysis has been demonstrated
and PCR­RFLP with HaeIII is an efficient
technique for the identification of
Leishmania species.22
In patients with CL, the lesions differ
throughout the clinical course of the disease
and in response to treatment, depending on
the causative agent. In the present study, the
Leishmania species isolated from samples
from Turkish citizens was identified as
L. tropica. Leishmania tropica is the predom-
inant cause of CL in the south-eastern
Anatolia region,2 although in recent years,
L. major and L. donovani have also been
shown to be causative agents of CL in
Turkey.24 Toz et al.23 examined the parasites
in samples obtained from humans and dogs
living in 31 cities in Turkey, with the majority
of samples originating from Izmir, Aydin,
Hatay, and Sanliurfa, and identified 80.43%
of the human and canine visceral leishman-
iasis samples as L. infantum and 6.52% as L.
tropica, and 52.46% of the CL samples as L.
infantum and 26.90% as L. tropica.
In the present study, the Leishmania
parasite isolated from lesions of Syrian
refugees was L. tropica and no other species
was identified. Several studies have reported
that the most prevalent causative agents
of CL in Syria are L. tropica8,25 and
L. major.26 Consistent with our findings,
Yehia et al.27 established L. tropica as the
Ek¸
si et al. 119
causative Leishmania species in biopsy sam-
ples isolated from lesions of Lebanese,
Syrian, and Saudi Arabian patients with
suspected Leishmaniasis, using PCR­
RFLP. In Lebanon, Saroufim et al.28 identi-
fied L. tropica in 85% and L. major in 15%
of Leishmania isolated from the lesions of
Syrian refugees with CL.
Significant heterogeneity was observed in
the genetic structure of the L. tropica para-
site that was analysed phylogenetically in the
present study. Leishmania tropica is a very
heterogeneous species and a high degree of
intra-species polymorphism has been
described based on an isoenzyme analysis
and other molecular methods.29,30 This gen-
etic variation may produce different pheno-
types that are associated with a diversity of
clinical manifestations and geographic dis-
tributions.31 In their study, Ajaoud et al.32
reported that an analysis of the ITS1­5.8S
rRNA gene­ITS2 sequence in 31 specimens
of the Phlebotomus sergenti vector showed
great heterogeneity among L. tropica, segre-
gating them into 16 haplotypes and demon-
strating their phylogenetic relatedness to
Indian strains and one Moroccan strain
isolated from a CL patient. The heterozy-
gosity of L. tropica isolates has also been
suggested in a previous study.33
Schwenkenbecher et al.34 developed 16 poly-
morphic microsatellite markers for the
phylogenetic analysis of L. tropica. They
found a high degree of allelic heterozygosity
among the strains, which suggested sexual
recombination within the species. The vari-
ations reported in the Old World Leishmania
species using ITS1 PCR­RFLP analyses
range from highest to lowest in the order:
L. tropica > L. aethiopica > L. major > L.
donovani.9 Eroglu et al.35 reported that
DNA sequencing revealed genetic variation
in both L. infantum (variants 1­3) and
L. tropica (variants 1­5), and suggested
that the increase in disease occurrence may
be attributable to the geographic expansion
of the disease, changing patterns of
international travel, population migrations,
and the entry of non-immune people into
endemic regions and of infected people into
non-endemic regions.
Conclusion
There are many diseases prevalent among the
Syrian and Iraqi refugees fleeing the civil wars
in their countries, primarily CL. The risk of
epidemics is greater for anthroponotic infec-
tions because of the transmission cycle from
infected human to vector to human. Infected
migrants may carry the disease to our region,
particularly Nizip and its surrounds, where
environmental/climatic conditions favour the
vector. There is also a risk that the disease will
spread to other regions. The identification of
the causative Leishmania parasite in the cases
of CL detected in our region will guide
treatment decisions and the implementation
of the necessary preventive measures and
vector control strategies.
