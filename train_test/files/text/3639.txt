Abstract
Additional intervention and medical treatment of complications may follow the primary treatment of a ureteral stone. We
investigated the cost of the treatment of ureteral stone(s) within 45 days after initial intervention by means of retrospective
analysis of the National Health Insurance Research Database of Taiwan. All patients of ages 20 years diagnosed with ureteral
stone(s)( International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification/ICD-9-CM: 592.1) from January 2001
to December 2011 were enrolled. We included a comorbidity code only if the diagnosis appeared in at least 2 separate
claims in a patient's record. Treatment modalities (code) included extracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy (SWL; 98.51),
ureteroscopic lithotripsy (URSL; 56.31), percutaneous nephrolithotripsy (PNL; 55.04), (open) ureterolithotomy (56.20),
and laparoscopy (ie, laparoscopic ureterolithotomy; 54.21). There were 28
513 patients with ureteral stones (13
848 men
and 14665 women) in the randomized sample of 1 million patients. The mean cost was 526.4 ± 724.1 United States Dollar
(USD). The costs of treatment were significantly increased in patients with comorbidities. The costs of treatment among
each primary treatment modalities were 1212.2 ± 627.3, 1146.7 ± 816.8, 2507.4 ± 1333.5, 1533.3 ± 1137.1, 2566.4 ± 2594.3,
and 209.8 ± 473.2 USD in the SWL, URSL, PNL, (open) ureterolithotomy, laparoscopy (laparoscopic ureterolithotomy), and
conservative treatment group, respectively. In conclusion, URSL was more cost-effective than SWL and PNL as a primary
treatment modality for ureteral stone(s) when the possible additional costs within 45 days after the initial operation were
included in the calculation.

Introduction
Ureteral stone is a common disease worldwide with increasing
incidence and prevalence.1,2 Extracorporeal shock-wave litho-
tripsy (SWL) and ureteroscopic lithotripsy (URSL) are the 2
most common procedures performed to treat ureteral stones in
more developed countries.2 Medical expulsion is applicable
when the stone size is relatively small. Other more invasive
modalities include percutaneous nephrolithotripsy (PNL) and
open or laparoscopic ureterolithotomy. Shock-wave litho-
tripsy is often an outpatient procedure, whereas URSL may
require admission in certain situations. Extracorporeal shock-
wave lithotripsy is most efficacious for smaller stones incar-
cerated in the upper ureter, whereas URSL provides a better
stone-free rate for larger or more distal stones.3,4
Many studies have compared the effectiveness between
the 2 procedures; however, there are fewer studies on a
national level. There are 2 reports from Taiwan. Huang et al5
used hospital-based records to compare the effectiveness of
the 2 treatments and showed that URSL was significantly
more effective than shock-wave treatment for upper-third
ureteral stones. Chang et al compared treatment effective-
ness for distal ureteral stones and showed that URSL was
more efficacious than SWL in both cost and success rate.6
There are additional procedures after primary treatment such

as removal of double-J stent, salvage stone removal, and
medical treatment of complications, which may alter the cost
and initial treatment strategy, but less studies focused on this
issue.
We investigated the cost of treating ureteral stone(s)
including the cost generated within a 45-day postoperative
period by retrospective analysis of the National Health
Insurance Research Database of Taiwan. The primary objec-
tive of this study is to compare the cost-effectiveness between
SWL and URSL on a national level in Taiwan. The second-
ary outcome is to delineate the relationship between underly-
ing comorbidities and cost.
Methods
Database
This retrospective cohort used a database derived from the
National Health Insurance Research Database of Taiwan.
The data are a derivative of the National Health Insurance
Program of Taiwan that covers more than 99% of the popula-
tion. The personal data have been scrambled to prevent iden-
tification of any individual patients. The Longitudinal Health
Insurance Database 2000 (LHID2000) contains the claims
filed by 1 million randomized individual patients. The diag-
noses were classified by ICD-9-CM.This study was approved
by the Institutional Review Board of China Medical
University, Taiwan (CMUH104-REC2-115).
All cases diagnosed with ureteral stone(s) (ICD-9-CM:
592.1) from January 2001 to December 2011 were enrolled.
The study included all patients aged 20 years. Total case
number was 28513. We recorded the treatment methods and
related costs from the day of initial intervention to 45 days
after the initial treatment. The "cost" mentioned hereafter
included that of admission, primary intervention, salvage
treatment, and outpatient department follow-up. Baseline
comorbidities were recorded as well, including hypertension
(HTN; ICD-9-CM: 401-405), diabetes mellitus (DM; ICD-
9-CM: 250), and chronic kidney disease (CKD; ICD-9-CM:
585) that might affect the cost ureteral stones. We included a
comorbidity code only if the diagnosis appeared in at least 2
separate claims in the patient's record to avoid inclusion of
false diagnoses. Treatment modalities (codes) included SWL
(98.51), URSL (56.31), PNL (55.04), ureterolithotomy
(56.2), and laparoscopy (54.21). All costs were recorded in
United States Dollar (USD; 1 USD  0.03 New Taiwan
Dollar).
Statistical Analyses
All costs were expressed as mean ± standard deviation. A
chi-square test was carried out to examine the differences of
costs and comorbidities among different groups. A linear
regression model was used to examine the costs of treat-
ments, and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) of the
variables was calculated for each cohort. Analysis of data
was performed by the SAS statistical package (SAS System
for Windows; version 9.4). The adopted level of statistical
significance was P < .05.
Results
We included a total of 28
513 patients with ureteral stones
(13
848 men and 14
665 women). The overall average cost
was 526.4 ± 724.1 USD. There was no cost difference among
different sex and age groups. The treatment costs were sig-
nificantly increased in patients with comorbidities including
DM, HTN, and CKD (Table 1).
There were 7479 SWLs with an average cost of 1212.2
± 627.3 USD. The average cost of URSL was 1146.7 ±
816.8 USD in 1374 patients. The average cost of SWL was
significantly higher than that of URSL (P < .001). The
patients who received URSL incurred the lowest average
cost among all groups except conservative management
(P < .001). The highest cost was incurred by laparoscopy
in 8 patients with a mean of 2507.4 ± 1333.5 USD.
Percutaneous nephrolithotripsy is the modality incurring
the second highest mean cost of 1533.3 ± 1137.1 USD in
147 patients. Average cost of open ureterolithotomy was
2566.4 ± 2594.3 USD in 127 patients. In the 19517 patients
who did not receive surgery, medical expulsion therapy
was most probably prescribed, and the mean cost was
209.8 ± 473.2 USD (Table 2).
Siu et al 3
By comparing the deviation of mean cost from controls
between respective comorbidities, we found that DM lead to
an increased treatment cost of 36.7 (95% CI, 17.8-55.6) USD
when compared with patients without DM. Hypertension
increased the mean cost by 68.6 (95% CI, 54.0-83.3) USD.
Chronic kidney disease led to an increased cost of 171.8 (95%
CI, 120.5-223.0) USD (Table 3). When the group without defi-
nite intervention was used as a reference point, the additional
medical costs within 45 days of the primary treatment of a
ureteral stone by different treatment modalities are shown in
Table 4. The additional cost incurred by SWL was 986.9 (95%
CI, 972.6-1001.2) USD, whereas that of URSL was 812.3
(95% CI, 782.9-841.7) USD (P < .001).
Discussion
The introduction of SWL decades ago provided urologists and
patients with an option to avoid invasive intervention even if a
ureter stone would not be able to pass spontaneously. Three
decades later, the urologist still has to decide whether to proceed
with SWL or URSL when the probability of spontaneous stone
passage is low.6 The European Association of Urology guide-
lines included both SWL and URSL as standard treatment
modalities for ureteral stones, but SWL was favored for proxi-
mal stones <10 mm and URSL was favored for distal stones
>10 mm. It does acknowledge that whether to proceed with
SWL or URSL is not a simple decision, and many factors must
be considered.3 Studies to aid the urologist to make this decision
have been performed over the past 20 years.
Earlier retrospective single-center studies compared the cost
between SWL and URSL in the treatment of distal ureteral
stones and concluded that URSL was more cost-efficient.5,7,8 A
retrospective single-centered study of proximal upper urinary
tract stones suggested that SWL seemed to be reasonable for
renal calculi, but URSL remained the treatment of choice for
proximal ureteral stones in terms of cost-effectiveness.9 In
another retrospective single-centered study of patients with
proximal ureteral stones, the cost and stone-free rate (SFR)
were compared between those who received SWL and URSL
with holmium:yttrium-aluminum-garnet (YAG) laser, and con-
cluded that even when the stone burden was larger in the URSL
group, URSL proved to be more cost-effective and provided a
better SFR than SWL.5 A more recent study from a regional
hospital in Taipei arrived at a similar conclusion, but a pneu-
matic lithotripter (Swiss LithoClast; EMS, Nyon, Switzerland)
was used instead of holmium: YAG laser.9
Lotan et al10 reviewed the costs and success rates of obser-
vation, URSL and SWL in the treatment of ureteral stones
described in the literature, and then constructed a decision
tree model using computer software to compare the cost, and
found that URSL was more cost-effective than SWL. Matlaga
et al11 reviewed 8 studies that compared the SFR and cost-
effectiveness between SWL and URSL for ureteral stones,
and showed that URSL was better than SWL in both SFR and
cost-effectiveness; however, the review was biased by small
study number, heterogeneous data, and research methods. A

proximal ureteral stones >10 mm concluded that URSL was
more clinically effective than SWL, and the associated risks
were not significantly higher; however, cost-effectiveness
was not included as a variable.12 Cochrane database published
their findings in 2012, stating that URSL achieved a higher
SFR but with the cost of increased complication rates and
hospital stay.13 The cost of lithotripters may not differ between
studies because of the oligopoly of the international market
by a handful of specialized manufacturers, but the financial
cost of hospital days may differ greatly among countries.
A prospective randomized study from eastern China found
that despite having a higher SFR in treating distal ureteral
stones, URSLbrought upon more complications than SWLand
was associated with a higher cost; however, it is worth noting
that the average hospital stays of patients in the SWL and
URSLgroups were 5.4 and 6.6 days, respectively.14 The admis-
sion days in this study were astonishingly longer than that
reported in other countries and may cause discrepancies in cost
evaluation. In contrast, another randomized study on proximal
ureteral stones compared the SFR and complication rate of
laparoscopic ureterolithotomy, SWL, and URSL, and con-
cluded that URSL has a lower complication rate than SWL.15
The aforementioned study did not evaluate cost-effectiveness.
Even for renal stones, SWL may be less cost-effective than
URSLwhen the stone is less than 15 mm in the greatest length.16
Cone et al16 published an article showed the cost-effectiveness
comparison of ureteral calculi treated with URSL versus SWL.
This retrospective study revealed superior SFR for ureteral
stones less than 1.5 cm treated with URSLcompared with SWL.
Their decision analysis model demonstrated that when SFR for
SWL is less than 60% to 64% or is greater than 57% to 76% for
URSL, SWL is not a cost-effective treatment option. Based on
these findings, they suggested that careful stratification and
selection of stone patients may enable surgeons to increase the
cost-effectiveness of SWL. To avoid the inclusion of patients
without ureteral stones into the study population due to input of
incorrect ICD codes, our inclusion criteria included a treatment
code that confirms the original diagnosis of ureteral stone in
each entry. We calculated the costs of treatment within 45 days
instead of documenting a single procedural fee, because second-
ary procedures may follow an unsatisfactory primary proce-
dure, which may lead to increased costs within that period.
Our study showed that URSL was the most cost-effective
treatment of choice for ureteral stones if the calculation
included the cost incurred by additional treatment up to 45
days postoperatively. Our results supported the previous
study by Huang et al5 that compared the overall treatment
cost during admission among stone treatment modalities, but
that study did not include the costs of additional treatment
after primary intervention. Huang et al found that the overall
treatment cost was higher in the SWL group without reach-
ing statistical significance (USD 627.1 ± 267.3 vs 596.3 ±
143.5). After stratification by the location of the stone(s), the
overall treatment cost was significantly higher in the extra-
corporeal SWL group than in the URSL group for patients
with upper-third ureteral stones, irrespective of stone size.
Our data also revealed that the cost of SWL is significantly
higher than that of URSL (USD 1212.2 ± 627.3 vs 1146.7 ±
816.8) when the costs incurred by postoperative treatment
within 45 days of primary intervention were included. In
fact, URSL was the least costly primary intervention modal-
ity among all the treatment groups when postoperative treat-
ment costs were included in the calculation.
The management of ureteral calculi has evolved over the
past decades with the advent of new surgical and medical treat-
ments. The current guidelines support conservative manage-
ment as a possible approach for ureteral stones sized 10 mm.
More recently, Alevizopoulos et al17 showed that conservative
management is clinically effective with a significant cost-ben-
efit, particularly for the subgroup of stones sized 0 to 4 mm,
where a need for follow-up scans is in dispute. We separately
investigated whether the presence of comorbidities increased
the medical costs in patients who received lithotripsy, and the
results were significantly positive. Patients with comorbidities
have higher medical costs in our study. More complications
related to underlying comorbidities may increase cost, but this
relationship is more established for PNL.18,19
This is a nation-wide study comprising of data contributed by
various health care providers, from clinics to tertiary referral
medical centers, unlike the traditional multicenter or multina-
tional study,20 which limits the number of institutions involved.

The sample size is 28513 patients, larger than previous studies.
However, there are several limitations of this study. National
Health Insurance Research Database could not provide certain
details, such as stone size, location, or stone quantity. The
increase in cost may be related to usage of chronic medications
but not necessarily complications related to surgery. Therefore,
this may be the causes of higher cost in PNL and laparoscopy.
However, SWL and URSL might be in a same condition of
choice which can be compared. A similar limitation applies to
the comparison of treatment modality for different stone sizes.
Conclusions
In conclusion, SWL as the primary treatment for ureter stone
was associated with a higher cost when compared with URSL.
In terms of cost-effectiveness, URSL is superior to SWL and
PNL. Underlying comorbidities increases the overall medical
cost during the treatment of ureter stones. More data are
needed to delineate the specific parameters that may affect the
cost at a national level.
