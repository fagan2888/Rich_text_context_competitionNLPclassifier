Objectives. This study first considers age and cohort explanations for age-related changes in mean values and variance
in self-rated health. Second, it evaluates the contributions of genes and environments to self-rated health mea-
sured longitudinally.
Methods. Subjects were participants in the Swedish Adoption/Twin Study of Aging. Self-rated health assessments
were collected in four waves over a 9-year follow-up period, from one or both members of 788 twin pairs. Linear mixed
effect models were used to test for differences in means and variances. Structural equation modeling provided estimates
of genetic and environmental components of variance and contributions to stability.
Results. Changes in means and variance within cohorts seem to reflect illness. Earlier-born cohorts are more variable
and have lower self-rated health. These cohort differences were not explained by childhood socioeconomic status.
Correlations between time points reflect both environmental and genetic factors.
Discussion. Both genes and environments contribute to self-rated health longitudinally, and both age and cohort effects
are seen. Age-related changes in self-rated health can be attributed to illness. Cohort differences are most likely
attributable to socially mediated and individual-specific environmental factors.
INTEREST in the self-evaluation of health has grown over
the last 25 years. The most provocative finding is that
subjective health assessments are often superior to clinical
assessments for predicting outcomes such as mortality and
morbidity (Idler & Benyamini, 1997; Mossey & Shapiro, 1982;
Thomas, Kelman, Kennedy, Ahn, & Yang, 1992). Twin studies
that focus on self-rated health as an outcome have demonstrated
that cross-sectional increases in variability with age are
primarily due to environmental factors unique to the individual,
but also to genetic factors (Christensen, Holm, McGue, Corder,
& Vaupel, 1999; Harris, Pedersen, McClearn, Plomin, &
Nesselroade, 1992a; Romeis et al., 2000; Svedberg, Lichten-
stein, & Pedersen, 2001). It is unclear, however, whether these
findings reflect differences in cohorts where earlier-born
cohorts had more variability or whether the findings indicate
a true age-related increase in variance.
The extent to which change in self-rated health over time
reflects genetic or environmental influences has, to our
knowledge, not been investigated previously. If environmental
factors explain the correlation between follow-up occasions, this
would suggest that stability in self-rated health reflects
individual-specific environmental factors. These could be
accidents or chance events that happen during the life span
and that have enduring effects. If shared familial environmental
factors explain the time-to-time correlation, childhood socio-
economic status (SES) or other rearing influences may be of
importance. One of the most prominent factors contributing to
cohort differences in Sweden the last century is SES. A large
body of literature also indicates that SES is predictive of
morbidity, mortality, and decline in functional status at different
ages (e.g., House, Kessler, & Herzog, 1990; Liang et al., 2002;
Seeman & Crimmins, 2001). Thus, it is reasonable to predict
that childhood SES contributes to both cohort differences and
longitudinal changes in self-rated health. If, instead, genetic
factors explain stability in self-rated health, this would suggest
that the consequences of genes are transmitted longitudinally. If
there are changes in genetic influences at later follow-up
occasions or among older age groups, this might imply that
genetic influences tied to late-onset, chronic diseases are of
importance for individual differences in self-rated health as
people grow older.
Cross-sectional studies have demonstrated that increasing
age, increasing number of symptoms, presence of a longstanding
illness, and increasing number of new illnesses have shown
a marked effect on subjects' self-rated health status (e.g.,
Murray, Dunn, & Tarnopolsky, 1982). Unde
´n and Elofsson
(1998) further showed that functional health and life style have
a greater explanatory value for level of self-rated health status in
older age groups than younger ones (younger than 44 years).
However, cross-sectional studies do not allow one to distinguish
properly the effects of age from aging due to coexisting
processes contributing to differences between age groups such
as sampling, selection, or different life experiences related to
cohort (Idler, 1993; Maddox & Douglass, 1974; Schaie &
Baltes, 1996).
Of the few longitudinal studies focusing on self-rated health
as an outcome, some have reported change, while others report
stability in level with age. Differences between studies are
mainly due to differences between the study samples, differ-
ences in questions asked, and length of follow-up times. The
Los Angeles Health Survey (Goldstein, Siegel, & Boyer, 1984)
found that self-rated health remained relatively stable over
1 year. Changes in self-rated health status were not associated
with any indicators of objective health or health beliefs. In their
15-year longitudinal study, Maddox and Douglass (1973)
reported a substantial stability of self-rated health and persistent

high positive congruence between medical evaluations and self-
rated health. A Swedish longitudinal study showed no overall
change in self-rated health from 60 to 67 years of age (Tibblin,
Cato, & Svardsudd, 1990; Tibblin, Tibblin, Peciva, Kullman, &
Svardsudd, 1990), and a Finnish study found similar results
(Leinonen, Heikkinen, & Jylha, 1998), although another study
reported a slight decline of self-rated health over an 8-year
period (Markides & Lee, 1990). Nonetheless, results from the
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey I Follow-Up
Study suggest that not only is self-rated health sensitive to
deterioration in physical health over a 20-year period, but
declines over time in self-rated health are associated with
mortality (Ferraro & Kelley-Moore, 2001). In her 6-year follow-
up study, Idler (1993) tested whether the observed optimism in
self-rated health was attributable to changes in age, cohort, or
survivorship with a sample of elderly persons (65 years or
older). She concluded that none of the explanations could be
ruled out; selective survivorship, processes of aging, and cohort
differences all seem to play important roles. Taken together,
cross-sectional and longitudinal studies suggest that age-related
change in self-rated health may not be great, whereas cohort
differences may be present but generally overlooked.
An increase in individual differences across age groups has
been demonstrated cross-sectionally for several health-related
variables, including self-rated health, although variance in-
creases are not universal (Birren & Schroots, 1996; Schaie &
Baltes, 1996). A review of biologically oriented studies in the
gerontological literature shows that 75% of the cross-sectional
studies show patterns of increasing variability, that is, in-
creasing individual differences (Nelson & Dannefer, 1992).
Individual differences can be traced to genetic or environmental
influences. Genetic and familial factors represent illnesses,
functional capacity, personality, SES, and other influences that
in turn affect self-rated health status.
Age group differences in variance reported in previous cross-
sectional gerontological genetic studies (Harris et al., 1992a;
Svedberg et al., 2001) could also reflect cohort differences in
which earlier-born cohorts had a greater range of socioeco-
nomic and cultural influences than later-born cohorts. Alterna-
tively, terminal decline, a rapid change in social, physiological,
and psychological functioning prior to death, has been sug-
gested as a possible source of individual differences in late life
(Berg, 1996). When studying elderly people, the population can
be presumed to include both elite survivors and an unknown
number of individuals that are experiencing a terminal decline
phase in their physical functioning.
Longitudinal quantitative genetic data help to distinguish true
aging effects from cohort differences and also to investigate
genetic and environmental explanations for increasing in-
dividual differences. Generally, longitudinal changes in both
means and variance have been smaller than cross-sectional
differences (Finkel, Reynolds, McArdle, Gatz, & Pedersen,
2003; Pedersen & Reynolds, 1998; Viken, Rose, Kaprio, &
Koskenvuo, 1994). Longitudinal analyses of number of organ
systems affected by disease were investigated in a Swedish twin
study (Pedersen, Steffensson, Berg, Johansson, & McClearn,
1999). For those twin pairs that survived to the age of 80 or
older, there were longitudinal increases in variance across a 30-
year period, entirely attributable to increases in environmental
influences. Finkel, Pedersen, and colleagues (2003) also found
support for increases in environmental variance with age for
grip strength and well-being, while genetic variance remained
stable. Self-rated health has not been studied from a longitudinal
quantitative genetic perspective.
Our goals were first to investigate how mean levels change
with time and whether the increases in total variance and
variance components with age previously reported in cross-
sectional studies of self-rated health are replicated in a longi-
tudinal study. Four age groups were constructed based on birth
year. We predicted that mean levels within age groups would
remain relatively stable across time and that longitudinal
changes would be smaller than cross-sectional. Additionally,
we test whether an index of illness accounted for any age-
related changes in self-rated health and whether childhood SES
accounted for any cohort differences in self-rated health.
Second, we sought to investigate the extent to which genetic
and/or environmental factors contributed to phenotypic stability
over time, that is, correlations between time points.
METHOD
Participants and Data Collection
Participants in this study are from the ongoing longitudinal
Swedish Adoption/Twin Study of Aging (SATSA). This study
is based on a subsample from the Swedish Twin Registry
(Lichtenstein et al., 2002) and includes twin pairs reared together
(TRT) and twin pairs separated before 11 years of age and reared
apart (TRA). The sampling of SATSA twins and method of
zygosity determination have been described in detail elsewhere
(Pedersen et al., 1991). The data included in the present analyses
were collected by questionnaires in four waves starting in 1984
with new questionnaires sent out at 3-year follow-up intervals
(1987, 1990, and 1993). The analyses in this study are based on
data from the 788 twin pairs (1,576 individuals) of known
zygosity in which one or both members responded to the self-
rated health items at least once (pair-wise response frequency
65%). Ages at the first questionnaire (1984) range from 26 to
86 years (M ¼ 58.6, SD ¼ 13.6), and 40% of the sample were
male. For the purpose of comparisons with earlier results by
Harris and colleagues (1992a), we divided data into four age
groups based on age at first questionnaire (1984): younger than
50 years, 50­59 years, 60­69 years, and older than 70 years.
These groups represent different birth cohorts. The age at the last
measurement occasion of each age group is then the same as the
age of first occasion of the next age group. Response patterns
across measurement occasions by age group are presented in
Table 1. Fifty-four percent of the sample participated at all four
questionnaire occasions, and only 13 individuals had partners
with missing information on all four of the questionnaires.
SATSA was approved by the Ethics Committee of Karolinska
Institutet, the Institutional Research Boards of the Pennsylvania
State University and the University of Southern California, and
the Swedish National Data Inspection Authority.
Measures
Self-rated health was measured by a scale including four
questions (listed in Table 2), one of which asks respondents
for a global rating of their health and three items about their
health in the context of their own aging experience. Following
SVEDBERG ET AL.
S332
the same procedure as Harris and colleagues (1992a), the
items were standardized at the first questionnaire occasion to
a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1 before summing.
In questionnaires 2­4 (1987, 1990, 1993), the items were
standardized relative to means and variances at the first
questionnaire (1984) items and then summed, ensuring that the
definition of self-rated health remained invariant across testing
occasions. A more favorable self-rating of health is indicated by
a higher value on the scale. The items included were reasonably
homogeneous (Cronbach coefficient a ¼ .76) in 1984.
We included a measure of the number of organ systems
affected by a chronic illness (sum of illness) as an objective
indicator of health. This is an index designed to mirror
``constricted homeostasis,'' which is a general reduction in
physiological resilience that is not associated with a specific
diagnosis (Rowe, 1985). This scale is based on 51 health-related
items that were reduced to 13 categories (cardiovascular,
respiratory, neurological, metabolic, gastrointestinal, musculo-
skeletal, urologic, female reproductive, visual, auditory, aller-
gies, skin, and cancer). A score for the scale was then computed
as the sum of all categories that were reported to be affected by
at least one health problem (Harris et al., 1992a). A high score
indicates more health problems.
We also looked at SES in childhood (rearing home) measured
on the first questionnaire in 1984. The SES Scale includes three
components: material resources within the household, highest
education, and highest occupational status of the parents. This
scale is based on factor analyses. Variables were standardized to
a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1 before summing. A
higher score on the scale reflects higher SES level. For a more
detailed description, see Lichtenstein and colleagues (1992).
Analytical Procedure
Analysis of means and variances. --Linear mixed effect
models with repeated measures and unstructured covariance
structures, different for different age groups, were fitted to the
data by running the Proc Mixed procedure in SAS (SAS/STAT,
1999­2001). First, a model was fitted to data to test for
differences in means in self-rated health over time, within and
between age groups. Second, a model was fitted to the data in
the same manner, including sum of illness and childhood SES
as covariates. Two-sample Student t tests were calculated using
the SAS Proc ttest procedure to test for differences in mean
childhood SES between age groups. Then, similar models were
fitted to test for differences in variances.
Quantitative genetic analysis. --Differences in similarity
between zygosity groups provide information about genetic
and environmental effects that may be present. For example, if
the monozygotic (MZ) twin pairs are more similar than dizygotic
(DZ) twin pairs, then genetic effects are indicated. Shared
environmental effects refer to nongenetic influences that
contribute to similarity within pairs of twins regardless of
zygosity, for example, family environment and contact through-
out life. Nonshared environmental effects are individual-specific
influences not shared within a twin pair, like accidents or
occupations. To the extent that twin pairs are dissimilar,
nonshared environmental effects are indicated. Genetic differ-
ences also contribute to dissimilarities within DZ twin pairs.
To investigate what factors contribute to the variance in self-
rated health over a 9-year time span in the four different age
groups, a series of models was fitted to the raw data. Fitting to
raw data allows for inclusion of single responders and therefore
increases power in the analyses and provides population based
estimates of total variance. The series of models began with the
fully parameterized Cholesky model in a temporal context
illustrated in Figure 1 (Loehlin, 1996; Neale & Maes, 2002).
The figure depicts a simplified version of the model includ-
ing only one twin in a pair. T1
­T4
represent measurement of
self-rated health at four successive time points (1984­1993).
Three sources of variation were considered at each time: genetic
(A1­4
), shared environmental (C1­4
), and nonshared environ-
mental (E1­4
) variance (including measurement error). A, C, and
E give information about anonymous influences that are not
actually measured. Thus, A tells us that there are genetic
influences but not which gene. Using this multivariate model,

we can separate genetic and environmental effects specific to
each time point from effects that are in common to the previous
time points. Within this framework with four measurements
(time points), the first genetic factor (A) loads on all of the
measures, a second genetic factor loads on all but the first
measure, a third genetic factor loads on all but the first two of the
measures, etc. Shared environmental (C) and nonshared
environmental (E) factors load on the four measurements in
patterns similar to that of the genetic factors. The relative
importance of genetic and environmental effects on each of the
measurement occasions is calculated by squaring and summing
the parameter estimates for each measure and dividing the
squared parameter estimates by the sum of squares. Total
variance estimates from the model and the decomposition into
genetic and environmental variance at each measurement
occasion will be presented. Heritability estimates for each
time occasion may be obtained by taking the overall genetic
variance over total variance. First, we fitted a full model (ACE)
for each age group. A series of submodels were then fitted when
we dropped common a, c, and e parameters that contribute to
transmission from the full model (i.e., only time-specific a11
,
a22
, a33
, a44
, c11
, c22
, c33
, c44
, e11
, e22
, e33
, and e44
were kept in
the model; see Figure 1) to identify a parsimonious explanation
of the data and evaluate the hypothesis concerning transmission
of stability. Nested models were compared by likelihood-ratio
chi-square. Degrees of freedom are equal to the number of
parameters deleted from the full model. The reduced models
where common a, c, and e were dropped from the model were
compared with the fit of the full model.
All models were fitted to the standardized observations of
self-rated health by full information maximum likelihood
estimation implemented in the program Mx (Neale, Boker,
Xie, & Maes, 2002). The models assume that there is random
mating operating in the parental generation, no interaction
between genes and environment, and equivalent influence of
shared environments for MZ and DZ twins. A more detailed
discussion of these assumptions can be found in Martin,
Boomsma, and Machin (1997).
The standardized path coefficients from the Cholesky model
can be used to estimate how the correlations between self-rated
health at different time points are mediated and thereby describe
what factors contribute to stability over time. To evaluate
longitudinal stability, the proportions of the phenotypic
correlation attributable to a, c, and e between time points for
each age group were calculated (Plomin & DeFries, 1981). The
genetic component of the estimated phenotypic correlation (rP
)
for self-rated health between times 1 and 2 is a11
*a21
, the shared
environmental portion is c11
*c21
, and the nonshared environ-
mental portion is e11
*e21
. Following the same procedure among
the other follow-up occasions, the estimated genetic portion of
the phenotypic correlation for self-rated health between times
2 and 3 is (a21
*a31
) þ (a22
* a32
), the shared environmental

), and the nonshared environmen-
tal portion is (e21
*e31
) þ (e22
*e32
), and so on.
Because the SATSA sample consists of both TRT and TRA,
a second series of analyses was undertaken where rearing status
was taken into account. Inclusion of TRT and TRA enables us to
estimate the importance of similarities in the rearing environ-
ment, as distinct from other shared environmental influences
that might occur in adult life. In these analyses, a fourth
parameter was included by a unity correlation between these
latent factors for TRT and a zero correlation for TRA,
representing influences that result in greater similarity of TRT
than TRA (Lichtenstein et al., 1992; Plomin, DeFries, &
McClearn, 1990).
RESULTS
Analysis of Means and Variances
Mean values and standard deviations for the self-rated health
scale at baseline and at follow-up questionnaire occasions are
described in Table 3 by age group. Younger adults were more
positive about their health status than older adults at baseline. A
linear mixed effect model was fitted to the data controlling for
sex, rearing, and zygosity. Figure 2 illustrates mean values and
associated 95% confidence intervals of self-rated health at the
four measurement occasions within the four age groups
regardless of participation pattern. There were statistically
significant mean effects for age group and time and a significant
age group-by-time interaction (p , .05). Within each age
group, change between successive pair-wise time points (1984
and 1987, 1987 and 1990, and 1990 and 1993) was not
significant (p . .05), although statistically significant changes
between time points more distant apart were found for the
youngest and the two oldest age groups. For the age group
younger than 50 years, mean self-rated health was significantly
lower in 1993 than in 1984 and 1987 (p , .05). For the age
group 60­69 years, the mean value in 1993 was significantly
lower than the three earlier years (p , .003). For the oldest age
group (70 years and older), the mean value in 1993 was
statistically lower than in the years 1987 and 1984, and
the mean value in 1990 was statistically lower than in the year
1984 (p , .05).
Before testing the model with childhood SES and sum of
illness variables as covariates, we tested for mean differences in
childhood SES across age groups. Mean values and standard
deviations for childhood SES assessed 1984 and sum of illness
at all four time points are described in Table 3. The pattern of
means was linear for both, confirming greater advantage for
later-born cohorts.
When we included childhood SES and sum of illness
variables as linear covariates in the model, the main effects of
age group, time, and sum of illness were significant. The age
group-by-time interaction was no longer significant. Results are
illustrated in Figure 3. There were no changes in mean values of
self-rated health within age groups between 1987, 1990, and
1993. The time effect was due to each age group having
significantly lower self-rated health at baseline in 1984
compared with all of the following measurement occasions
(1987, 1990, and 1993; p , .01, .01, and .02 respectively).
These results indicate that sum of illness accounted for
a significant amount of change over time in self-rated health
but did not explain cohort differences. Age group differences
remained. The oldest age group showed statistically significant
lower mean self-rated health than age groups 50­59 years and
younger than 50 years, and the age group 60­69 years showed
significantly lower mean self-rated health than age group
younger than 50 years.
Figure 4 illustrates variances for self-rated health using the
same approach as for the mean values. In our first model, the
data did not show any substantial change in total variance within
age group across the 9-year interval apart from the youngest age

found. To evaluate this further, we compared a model with no
restrictions on the variances and covariances with a model with
equal variances at all four time points and equal correlations
between data measured with an equal distance apart (a model
with different age group-specific Toeplitz covariance struc-
tures). A likelihood-ratio test was calculated, and the data
supported the simpler model with the same variance at all four
time points but increasing variance across age groups (log
likelihood difference ¼ 20.36, p ¼ .3127). Including sum of
illness and SES as covariates did not affect the main result,
although differences between age groups were smaller (log
likelihood difference ¼ 27.08, p ¼ 0.0774) (see Figure 5).
Attrition
Among the total number of observations (N ¼ 6,304), 22%
had missing data on self-rated health. Inclusion of childhood
SES and sum of illness as covariates resulted in an additional
loss of 885 observations. There was a pattern of increasing
missing frequency for higher age groups and over time. The
amount of missing data at the first wave was 8%, 10%, 7%, and
6% for the four age groups, respectively. The corresponding
figures were 21, 20, 22, and 33% in 1987; 21, 22, 26, and 49%
in 1990; and 12, 20, 33, and 61% in 1993.
If the missing data can be considered missing at random, the
estimates obtained from the maximum likelihood estimation are
unbiased. If this assumption is not true, the missing data are
not ignorable and the missing mechanisms should be modeled
(Little & Rubin, 1987). With the advantage of technical and con-
ceptual simplicity, we performed a series of sensitivity analyses,
testing the effects of assumptions regarding the ``true'' responses
by those who missed a measurement occasion. We computed
multiple imputations assuming correlated multivariate normal
distribution for the data within twin pairs and then recalculated
our original analysis. Data missing because of death were not
imputed, but the data available before death were used. In four
separate analyses, the imputed values were then decreased (or
increased) by À0.5, þ0.5, À2, and þ2 units, respectively, to test
the consequences of assuming that nonresponse represented
worse (or better) true values. The results were consistent with the
original analyses of means and variance development (data not
shown), with only minor differences from the original results.
When imputed values were negatively adjusted, there were only
slightly lower means and higher variances, whereas for a positive
adjustment, the opposite was found.
Reasons for nonresponses were available for 44% of the
missing subjects, with 28% having died during the follow-up
period and 16% indicating that they were too sick to participate.
On this basis, we believe the nonobserved self-rated health
data represent poorer ratings rather than the contrary. This
assumption is also supported by evaluating the means and
variances for those who participated in the questionnaire
follow-ups as a function of number of occasions of participa-
tion. There is a pattern resembling terminal decline with
decreases in means at the last occasion of measurement (see
Figure 6). We can see by visual inspection that mean values are
lower for those who participated only at the first questionnaire
occasion compared with those who participated at more than
one occasion. Those participating in all four occasions have the
greatest mean level stability, whereas the variance is higher for
those who participated only the first time and lower for those

who participated at several occasions. Fewer twins participated
at all four occasions in the oldest age group; therefore, we also
looked specifically at this group. The twins who participated at
the fourth occasion had lower variability in 1984 than those
who dropped out over the course of the study. This finding
suggests that these individuals are farther away from death and
hence less variable because they are all healthier.
In conclusion, with these additional analyses, we consider the
results presented above regarding variances and mean de-
velopment to be conservative in the sense that availability of the
``true values'' for missing data would probably only increase
the variances at later time points and older ages and simul-
taneously decrease the mean values.
Quantitative Genetic Analysis
A fundamental assumption of quantitative genetic analysis
based on twin data is that variances are equal in MZ and DZ
twins. Analyses of variance in SAS and Mx yielded no
differences in means and variances between MZ and DZ twin
groups for the self-rated health scale except for the age group
50­59 years. Violations of this assumption typically result in
a worsening of fit of the genetic models but no influence on
parameter estimates.
There were no significant differences in intrapair similarity
between the two rearing groups, and shared rearing environ-
mental effects did not explain significant proportions of the
variance. Thus, in the following, we will focus on the results
where rearing is not specifically taken into account.
Figure 7 illustrates the total raw variances and the genetic and
environmental variances based on the most parsimonious model
evaluated from the four occasions 1984­1993 for each of the
four age groups as well as average total variance over time for
each age group. Table 4 shows the fit statistics of the model
fitting procedures for the full and most parsimonious models
based on Akaike information criteria. The most parsimonious
model for all of the age groups suggests that shared
environmental factors (C) in common to the four measurement
occasions could be dropped from the model; that is, only shared
environmental factors unique to each time point were kept in the
model. Nonshared environmental variance was the greatest
source of variance for all age groups at most of the measurement
occasions, except for the last measurement occasion for the
oldest age group. Most of the remaining variance was explained
by genetic factors.
Stability coefficients (i.e., phenotypic correlations [rP
]) from
the most parsimonious model and their decomposition into
genetic and nonshared environmental components are shown in
Table 5. The youngest age group has the lowest correlation
coefficients (rP
) around .45. Nonshared environmental factors
are the primary source of stability over a 9-year time span for
the youngest age group (under 50 years), whereas in the older
age groups, both nonshared environmental and genetic factors
account for almost equal portions of the total correlation.
DISCUSSION
This study aimed to investigate individual differences in self-
rated health over a 9-year time interval and between four age
groups. The research questions of focus were first whether the
cross-sectional decreases in mean values, increases in total
variance, and differences in sources of variation reported in
earlier studies were paralleled in longitudinal changes or if those
differences represent cohort effects. We evaluated the extent to
which childhood SES and an index of illness account for cohort
and longitudinal findings. Second, we asked how important ge-
netic and environmental influences are for phenotypic stability.
Cohort Versus Longitudinal Effects
We found that previous cross-sectional reports of a decrease
in mean level and an increase in total variance with age are not
fully replicated in longitudinal approaches. We found mean
levels to remain relatively stable over a period of 9-years within
Figure 6. Means and variances for self-rated health for all twins
participating in the questionnaires in a sequential order.
Figure 7. Total raw variances divided into genetic and environ-
mental variance of self-rated health at four occasions (1984­1993),
within four age groups. The best model is presented where we dropped
shared environmental effects (C). Time-specific A, C, and E are still in
the model as well as common A and common E. A ¼ genetic variance;
C ¼ shared environmental variance; E ¼ nonshared environmental
variance. aTwins younger than 50 years were all born after 1934,
age group 50­59 years was born between 1925 and 1934, age group
60­69 years was born between 1915 and 1924, and age group older
than 70 years was born before 1915.
LONGITUDINAL ANALYSIS OF SELF-RATED HEALTH S337
each age group after inclusion of morbidity data (sum of illness)
in our model. However, we also found that younger age groups
report a better self-rated health status than the older age groups.
Age differences in mean level have been reported earlier, and in
general, older people are more likely to rate their health as poor
(e.g., Murray et al., 1982). Consistent with the role of health in
accounting for self-rated health (Ferraro & Kelley-Moore,
2001; Unde
´n & Elofsson, 1998), the effect of change over time
was largely eliminated when disease status was taken into
account in our analysis. However, cohort differences remained,
suggesting that other factors play an important role for self-
rated health across different age groups. Different birth cohorts
might be affected by societal changes in different ways (Fritzell
& Lundberg, 2000). There has been strong economic de-
velopment in Sweden since 1940. Twins born 1914 or earlier
grew up when Sweden was fairly poor and during a time of
multiple epidemics. Industrialization increased the standard of
living, and the age groups born after World War I might have
gained more from that development than the prewar cohorts. In
support of this hypothesis, our comparison of SES during
childhood for the different age groups demonstrates that
younger age groups had a higher childhood SES level.
However, inclusion of childhood SES in our mixed effect
model did not explain the cohort differences in self-rated health
to any great extent. Societal changes not tapped by our SES
measure are more likely to explain these differences.
Our results also show that the increase in total variance is
greater between age groups than longitudinal contrasts within
age groups. This finding is consistent with the literature
contrasting cross-sectional with longitudinal findings within
the same study for other gerontological variables (Birren &
Birren, 1990; Nelson & Dannefer, 1992; Schaie & Baltes, 1996).
The age at the last measurement occasion of each age group is
the same as the age of first occasion of the next age group. The
total variance estimates at the last occasion for the youngest age
group matches the estimates of the first occasion for the second
age group. However, there are clearer differences in the start and
ending points for the last two age groups (60­69 years and 70
years and older), suggesting clearer cohort differences and little
longitudinal change for these age groups. Neither childhood
SES nor an index of morbidity explained these findings.
Sources of Variance
The contributions of genetic and environmental variance to
the total variance for all four age groups replicate well what has
been found in previous cross-sectional studies (Christensen
et al., 1999; Harris et al., 1992a,b; Lichtenstein & Pedersen,
1995; Romeis et al., 2000; Svedberg et al., 2001). Both genetic
and environmental variance appear to increase longitudinally,
although for the youngest age group in our present study, there
is not much variability. The increased variability is due to both
genetic and environmental sources of influence. Increasing
genetic variability might result from the fact that the twins
are coming into the age when many chronic diseases that are
influenced by genetic effects have their debut, for example,
coronary heart disease, hypertension, diabetes, etc. Some
people become affected, and others remain disease-free, leading
to increased individual differences.
Stability in Self-Rated Health Over Time
Stability of self-rated health, that is, interoccasion phenotypic
correlation, is lower for the youngest age group compared with
the older age groups, which might reflect the restricted range in
variation or the onset of health-related conditions. Primarily
nonshared environmental factors contribute to stability for the
youngest age group, and both genetic and environmental factors
contribute fairly equally to stability in the other age groups.
A somewhat higher environmental component of stability
indicates that the same environmental factors had an impact at
more than one occasion. Such nonshared environmental factors
could, for example, include social relationships, education, and

accidents that have an enduring effect on self-rated health. Equal
mediation by genetic and environmental effects has also been
found for personality traits (Pedersen & Reynolds, 1998). The
correlations between times are not explained by shared
environmental effects in any of the age groups. This is consistent
with our finding from our mixed effect model where childhood
SES, a typical measure of shared environment, does not explain
cohort differences in variance or time effects in self-rated health.
Strengths and Limitations
This study was restricted to a somewhat short follow-up time
period of 9 years, yet we were able to impose a ``synthetic cohort
sequential'' design such that the width of the age group was the
same as the length of the follow-up time. Only pairs where both
members responded at any one point in time contributed to
information on covariation (i.e., genetic variance); however, it is
a strength that we actually can include information on all twins
to receive adequate total variance estimates in our Mx models.
The effect of attrition is notable at least for the oldest age
group, an expected issue with a longitudinal project. Many in
the oldest group participated at fewer than all four occasions. As
reported, those who ``survived'' four occasions of measurement
were less variable than those who dropped out. This may very
well have to do with terminal decline or selection. Less healthy
persons in a population also tend to refuse answering questions
both initially and at follow-up occasions (Maddox & Douglass,
1974), another liability in longitudinal studies in general. If
anything, our results are attenuated by attrition.
CONCLUSIONS
Our findings suggest that previous reports of an increase in
variance in self-rated health with increased age primarily reflect
cohort differences and are not fully replicated longitudinally.
Mean levels remain quite stable within age groups over time, and
changes with age in level of self-rated health seem to be
explained primarily by illness. For variance as well, we found
more substantial cohort differences than longitudinal changes,
suggesting that the influence of socially mediated and in-
dividual-specific environmental effects may be greater than
individual differences due to onset of genetically influenced
diseases. The phenotypic stability over a 9-year time period is
explained almost equally by genetic and environmental factors
for all adult ages.
