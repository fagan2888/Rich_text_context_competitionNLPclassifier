Abstract
We use the simple, but prominent Helmholtz's squares illusion in which a vertically striped square
appears wider than a horizontally striped square of identical physical dimensions to determine
whether functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) BOLD responses in V1 underpin illusions of
size. We report that these simple stimuli which differ in only one parameter, orientation, to which
V1 neurons are highly selective elicited activity in V1 that followed their physical, not perceived
size. To further probe the role of V1 in the illusion and investigate plausible extrastriate visual areas
responsible for eliciting the Helmholtz squares illusion, we performed a follow-up transcranial
magnetic stimulation (TMS) experiment in which we compared perceptual judgments about the
aspect ratio of perceptually identical Helmholtz squares when no TMS was applied against selective
stimulation of V1, LO1, or LO2. In agreement with fMRI results, we report that TMS of area V1
does not compromise the strength of the illusion. Only stimulation of area LO1, and not LO2,
compromised significantly the strength of the illusion, consistent with previous research that LO1
plays a role in the processing of orientation information. These results demonstrate the
involvement of a specific extrastriate area in an illusory percept of size.

Introduction
Recent studies have shown a link between perceived size and the spatial extent of BOLD
responses in the primary visual cortex (V1) by presenting stimuli in the context of strong 2D
depth cues (Fang, Boyaci, Kersten, & Murray, 2008; He, Mo, Wang, & Fang, 2015; Murray,
Boyaci, & Kersten, 2006) or by manipulating the extraocular cues of vergence and
accommodation (Sperandio, Chouinard, & Goodale, 2012). Perceived size and size
constancy are thought to be computed beyond V1 (Blakemore, Garner, & Sweet, 1972)
and this has led to the idea that feedback from higher visual areas modulates BOLD
responses in V1, where both retinal and extraretinal signals must be brought together
(Sterzer & Rees, 2006). Whether any perceptual illusion arises solely from V1-specific
mechanisms (Michel, Chen, Geisler, & Seidemann, 2013; Pooresmaeili, Arrighi, Biagi, &
Morrone, 2013) regardless of feedback projections from higher areas (Fang et al., 2008;
Kok, Bains, van Mourik, Norris, & de Lange, 2016; Kok & De Lange, 2014; Murray
et al., 2006; Sperandio et al., 2012), is an issue yet to be resolved (see Discussion section).
In this study, we tested whether processing specific to V1 can be linked to perceptual
experience using the well-known Helmholtz squares illusion (Helmholtz & Southall, 1925;
Figure 1a), in which a vertically striped square appears wider than a horizontally striped one
of identical dimensions (Helmholtz & Southall, 1925). This illusion has the advantage of
minimizing high-level feedback to V1 as it does not depend on misapplied cues for size-

appears narrower than the upper square as first described by Helmholtz (Helmholtz & Southall, 1925). On the right,
the horizontally lined stimulus has been widened so it is no longer physically square, but now appears to match the
dimensions of the vertically lined square above it. The width of the perceptually matched horizontally lined stimulus
was increased (by 8­18%) according to each individual's psychophysics results. (b) BOLD response phase to rotating

constancy scaling (Murray et al., 2006; Sperandio et al., 2012) and is therefore a good candidate
to determine whether stimulus-driven BOLD responses in V1 alone underlies perceived size.
As others have (Kok et al., 2016; Kok & De Lange, 2014; Murray et al., 2006;
Pooresmaeili et al., 2013; Sperandio et al., 2012), we measured the extent of BOLD
responses in primary visual cortex, but in our case for horizontally and vertically lined
rectangles, which elicit the Helmholtz illusion. We found that the extent of BOLD
responses in primary visual cortex followed the physical, but not perceptual dimensions of
the stimuli. However, our participants performed a demanding central fixation task during
presentation of the stimuli, so attention was not on the stimuli. Consequently, we bias the
BOLD responses that we will measure to stimulus-driven activity by reducing the effect of
top-down feedback (Fang et al., 2008). We find no illusion-related BOLD responses in V1
consistent with the idea that stimulus-driven activity in V1 cannot solely explain the illusion
(Fang et al., 2008; see Discussion). We next investigated whether activity in V1 and two
candidate extrastriate visual areas (LO1 and LO2) played a causal role in the illusion. To do
this, we applied transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to one of the three cortical regions,
while participants judged the aspect ratio of horizontally and vertically lined rectangles. The
stimuli were set such that for each individual, they were normally perceived as square, despite
being physically rectangular. We predicted therefore that TMS of a cortical site underpinning
the illusion would generate a release from the illusion. Importantly, this release would register
as an increase in the number of responses that correctly identify the physical aspect ratio of
the stimuli that were normally perceived as perceptually square. Our results showed that
TMS to LO1 increased the number of correct responses relative to TMS to other sites (LO2
and V1) and a no TMS control condition. This shows that even when a stimulus-related task
is performed, which could arguably result in illusion-related signals being feedback to V1, the
activity in V1 alone does not cause the illusion. We show, therefore, that extrastriate
processing underpins this example of a size illusion.
Materials and Methods
Participants
Eight participants (six females; age range: 18­25 years old; mean ¼ 21) carried out the pre-
functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) psychophysics experiment, retinotopic-
mapping sessions, and the Helmholtz's squares fMRI experiment. Seven additional
participants carried out the pre-TMS psychophysics and TMS sessions (one female; age
range 23­47; mean ¼ 30). All participants had normal or corrected-to-normal visual acuity
and no history of neurological impairments. Informed consent was obtained in accordance
with the Declaration of Helsinki. Procedures and protocols were approved by the York
Neuroimaging Centre (YNiC) Research Ethics Committee at The University of York,
United Kingdom.
Design of the fMRI Experiment
Our first approach to understand what neural processes contribute to the Helmholtz square
illusion was to measure the extent of BOLD responses in V1 elicited by stimuli inducing and
also cancelling the illusion. The logic is as follows: squares comprising vertical lines appear
wider than squares comprising horizontal lines (Figure 1a), so BOLD responses along the
representation of the horizontal meridian in V1 (Figure 1b and c) would be of greater extent
for vertically than horizontally lined squares (e.g. black vs. red line in Figure 1d), if V1
activity follows the illusion. If the BOLD responses in V1 map the physical dimensions of
Mikellidou et al. 3
the stimuli, however, no difference in the extent of the activity would register. If the
horizontal lines are extended, such that the participant perceives the vertically and
horizontally lined stimuli to be equal in width (see ``perceptually matched'' in Figure 1a),
the extent of BOLD responses in V1 would be equal, if that activity follows the illusion. In
contrast, the extent of V1 BOLD responses along the representation of the horizontal
meridian would be greater for the horizontally lined than for the vertically lined stimulus,
if V1 follows the physical dimension of the stimulus.
In terms of the fMRI design, we presented four stimulus conditions. In general,
horizontally lined stimuli presented at an eccentricity of 3 were paired with vertically
lined squares presented at an equal eccentricity in the opposite hemifield. We varied the
hemifield in which the horizontally lined stimulus appeared (left or right) and the width of
the horizontally lined stimulus (physically or perceptually square). As a result, two of the
stimulus conditions comprised the vertically lined squares appearing in the left hemifield and
were paired with a horizontally lined rectangle that was either the same width or was wider,
appearing in the right hemifield. For the remaining two stimulus conditions, the vertically
and horizontally lined stimuli were on the right and left, respectively. The four stimulus
conditions meant that three different stimuli were presented to each hemifield; a vertically
lined square, a horizontally lined square, and a horizontally lined rectangle whose width was
perceptually matched to the vertically lined square and was thus physically wider.
Our hypotheses were tested by contrasting the extent of BOLD responses elicited by these
stimuli. Our outcome measure, D, to compare conditions was defined as (d1 À d2)/(d1 þ d2),
as shown in Figure 1d, where d is the distance over which the t-statistic exceeded 25% of its
peak value for the line region of interest (ROI) along the horizontal meridian representation
of V1 (Figure 1b and c). We selected 25% of the t-statistic as the threshold as it uniformly
registered highly significant BOLD responses but also offered a consistent measure relative to
the peak BOLD response in each participant. The advantage of computing D is that it is not
vulnerable to cortical magnification variations between participants. Because we had two
stimulus conditions (per hemifield) for which vertically lined squares were presented, our
contrast measure, D, provides baseline data for the extent of BOLD responses in V1 for
stimuli that were identical; we predict that D is zero (see Figure 2a i) for this baseline. The
prediction for the horizontally lined square and wider, rectangular horizontally lined
rectangle is that D will be positive (Figure 2a ii). This is an essential calibration as it
allows us to determine whether we can detect changes in the extent of BOLD responses in
V1 elicited by stimuli that are perceived as differing in width and which are indeed physically
different in width. The magnitude of D will vary depending on whether V1 follows the
illusion or the physical dimensions of the stimuli when the stimuli with differing line
orientation are considered. D will either be positive (V1 maps perceived stimulus width) or
zero (V1 maps the physical stimulus width) when the physically square stimuli with different
line orientation are contrasted (Figure 2a iii). When the vertically lined stimulus is contrasted
with the horizontally lined wider stimulus, D will either be zero (V1 maps perceived stimulus
width) or positive (V1 maps the physical stimulus width; Figure 2a iv).
The difference in the physical size of the stimuli that are perceived to be of equal width is
relatively small (mean 0.7--see Table 1). It is important therefore to assess whether a shift of
such a size can be detected in the retinotopic representation of V1. The well-characterized V1
cortical magnification predicts that the spread of BOLD responses due to the illusion (0.35
at each flank of the stimulus) should result in 2 mm of additional cortical activation at the
inner flank of the stimulus (3 eccentricity) but only 0.5 mm at the outer flank. It is likely
therefore that the resolution of fMRI will only detect shifts at representations of the near
rather than the far flank (Engel, Glover, & Wandell, 1997; see Figure 1d). To achieve
4 i-Perception 0(0)
measuring the total $2.5 mm predicted change in the extent of BOLD responses, we
performed fMRI at a reasonably high resolution (2.5 Â 2 Â 2 mm). So, while the change is
small, it should be detectable in V1 with our approach. However, for other visual areas which
have smaller representations of the visual field, we are unable to test our hypotheses because
of the spatial resolution of our fMRI measures. It is also important to note that the
differences in spatial extent that we are aiming to detect in V1 could be easily masked by
relatively small eye movements. With this in mind, we had participants perform a demanding
fixation task. A consequence is that this biases the BOLD responses that we will measure to
stimulus-driven activity by reducing the effect of top-down feedback (Fang et al., 2008).
Design of the TMS Experiment
While the fMRI experiment given earlier was designed to detect stimulus-related BOLD
responses in primary visual cortex and determine whether it was governed by perceptual
or physical dimensions of the stimulus, the data we can derive from fMRI are
correlational. Moreover, because of cortical magnification and fMRI resolution, we were
restricted to detecting changes in V1 alone. We therefore designed a TMS experiment that is
capable of probing the causal roles that V1 and two extrastriate visual areas play in the
perception of the Helmholtz illusion. We designed the study as a follow-up to the fMRI
study in which we detected no illusion-related BOLD responses in V1. However, one reason
for this could have been the absence of a stimulus-related task. Importantly, therefore, our
TMS experiment actively engaged participants in an aspect ratio judgment that highlighted
the illusion. Specifically, we had participants indicate whether rectangular stimuli, which were
set to be perceptually square, were taller or wider than a square. We can revisit the role of V1,
therefore, by applying TMS to it during these perceptual judgments. We also reasoned that
two other visual areas, LO1 and LO2, might also play a role in the Helmholtz illusion. LO1
has been shown to be orientation-selective (Larsson, Heeger, Larsson, & Heeger, 2006) and
TMS to LO1 also interferes with orientation discrimination (Silson et al., 2013). Given that
the stimulus difference that gives rise to the Helmholtz illusion is one of orientation alone, we
asked how LO1 might be involved. LO2 offers a good control region as it lies very nearby
LO1 and therefore tests the spatial specificity of any effect we might detect for LO1. Crucial
to the design of this experiment is the predicted behavioral outcome that is associated with a
release from the illusion. Individuals were presented with stimuli that they originally
perceived to be square, but were in fact physically anisotropic, meaning a release from the
illusion would result in participants' judgments becoming more veridical. That is, their
responses would reflect the physical anisotropy of the stimulus. We predict therefore an
increase in correct judgments when TMS disrupts activity in a region of the brain that
governs the illusion.
Procedures
Measuring the Size of the Illusion and Producing Stimuli that Null it
Key to both the experiments is the prerequisite that we can measure the Helmholtz illusion
and then produce stimuli that null the illusion for each individual. For the psychophysical
experiments that preceded the fMRI measurements, we presented stimuli in the left and right
hemifields simultaneously for 600 ms, with the nearest edge 3 away from a central fixations
cross. The lines comprising the stimuli alternated between black (300 ms) and then white
(300 ms) during the 600 ms trial and were presented on a uniform gray background that was
of luminance equivalent to the mean of the black and white lines. The two different phases of
Mikellidou et al. 5
the stimulus were used to prevent afterimages. To create prominent illusion, each rectangular
stimulus consisted of seven lines, with a duty cycle of 0.9 (thin lines on a gray background)
and a spatial frequency of 0.91 cycles/degree (Mikellidou & Thompson, 2013, 2014;
Thompson & Mikellidou, 2011). We spatially jittered the stimuli by up to 0.1 to prevent
afterimages providing cues to physical size changes between successive trials. We used the
method of constant stimuli to determine the point of subjective equality (PSE) under two
different conditions.
In one condition, we presented a reference, 6.6 square comprising horizontal lines to either
the left or right hemifield and in the other hemifield, we presented a test rectangle comprising
horizontal lines, which could be one of the seven widths (5.7, 6.0, 6.3, 6.6, 6.9, 7.2, and 7.5).
This condition provided control data as participants should, under these stimulus conditions,
have veridical perception as both the reference and test are defined by lines of the same
orientation. In another condition, we presented a 6.6 reference square comprising vertical
lines to either the left or right hemifield and in the other hemifield, we presented a test
rectangle, defined by horizontal lines, drawn from those used in the control experiment.
This condition was used to assess the size of the illusion. The height of the stimuli
remained constant for all conditions. The two conditions were interleaved into single runs.
Two runs were carried out, with each run comprising 700 trials (350 control and 350 illusion)
with each test stimulus width presented 50 times for each condition. The participant was
asked to indicate on which side (left or right) the wider of the two rectangles appeared. We
derived psychometric functions for each participant and fitted them with a cumulative
Gaussian. The PSE was found to be in the range of 6.56 to 6.63 for the control
condition and 7.09 to 7.79 for the illusory condition. Our participants were therefore
veridical in the control condition and experienced the illusion in the other condition where
the horizontal stimulus width was increased between 8 and 18% in order to be perceptually
matched to the vertically lined stimulus. The psychophysics took approximately 20 minutes to
complete. The results for individuals in the psychophysical experiment are shown in Table 1.
The ViSaGe (Cambridge Research Systems) Visual Stimulus Generator was used, along
with its MatLab (Mathworks, Natick, MA) CRS toolbox, to present calibrated stimuli on a
Mitsubishi Diamond Plus 91 monitor with precision timing (viewing distance ¼ 57 cm). The
screen's resolution was 1024 Â 768 pixels and the frame rate was 60 Hz (mean
luminance ¼ 10 cdmÀ2). A CB6 (Cambridge Research Systems) response box was used to
gather participants' responses.
For the psychophysical experiment that preceded the TMS experiment, we adopted a
modified approach. We reasoned that we needed to disrupt the representation of the

stimulus to interfere with the illusory percept. The paired stimulus design used in fMRI
would be impossible with a single TMS coil as the stimulus representation would be in
both hemispheres. Even with two coils and dual TMS, the proximity of the stimulus
representation in left and right V1 to the midline would not allow two coils to be
separated physically to stimulate left and right V1 simultaneously. We therefore presented
stimuli in only one location allowing us to stimulate its representation in V1, LO1, and LO2.
We also reduced the size of the stimuli to 2.9, so the stimulus representation in V1 was closer
to the cortical surface than it would have been for the larger stimuli used in the fMRI
experiment. This precaution gives us greater confidence that the distance between the TMS
coil and our three targets will not vary greatly and will not therefore be the cause of any
potential differences in the participant's responses. We also changed the stimulus duration to
200 ms as this is a period over which we routinely apply TMS to disrupt performance in
visual tasks and allows us to stay within published safety guidelines for TMS (Rossi et al.,
2009). As a result of the changes we made to the stimuli, we needed to assess how the aspect
ratios of these newly specified horizontally and vertically lined rectangles were perceived and
used the following stimuli and procedure to do so.
Stimuli were black, vertically and horizontally lined, rectangles presented on a uniform
gray background. As before, each rectangular stimulus consisted of seven lines, with a duty
cycle of 0.9 (thin lines on a gray background), but in this case subtended 2.9 along the
dimension orthogonal to the direction of the bars. The length of the bars was varied during
the psychophysical experiment.
Participants fixated a central red circle (0.15) throughout the experiment. Stimuli were
centred at 2.8 along the horizontal meridian in the visual field contralateral to planned TMS
stimulation and were viewed binocularly (Figure 3a). On each trial, the absolute position of
the stimulus was varied by adding a random value between 0 and Æ 0.1 to both x and y. The
stimulus was shown for 200 ms followed by an intertrial interval (ITI) in which the
participant indicated whether the stimulus was taller or wider than a true square. To
capture individual psychometric functions for both the horizontal and vertical Helmholtz
stimuli, a total of six interleaved staircases (1-up, 3-down; 3-up, 1-down; 1-up, 2-down; 2-up,
1-down; two 1-up, 1-down staircases) were completed for each stimulus. Horizontally and
vertically lined stimuli were randomly interleaved within the same experimental block. These
procedures were used to distribute trials at informative points along the psychometric
function, which was fitted using data from all trials, except the first two reversals which
were removed from the analysis. The step size was initially 0.4 and halved on reversals 3­
5. The staircase concluded after 14 reversals, resulting in $30 trials per staircase type ($180
trials per psychometric function). A cumulative Gaussian was fitted to the data and the 0.5
point was taken at the observer's PSE. The PSE gives the dimensions of the stimuli that were
perceived as square. To account for any variance across sessions, participants completed the
behavioural psychophysics three times and the average value was used in the TMS
experiment. Each of the three runs took approximately 20 minutes to complete. The results
for the psychophysical experiment are shown in Table 2.
Stimuli were generated using Matlab and Psychtoolbox (Brainard, 1997; Kleiner et al.,
2007) and displayed on a Mitsubishi Diamond Pro 2070SB display (viewing distance ¼ 57 cm)
with a resolution of 1024 Â 768 pixels and a refresh rate of 60 Hz.
Retinotopic Mapping Procedures for Both fMRI and TMS Experiments
Crucial to the fMRI and TMS experiments is the need to identify retinotopic maps in each
individual. For our fMRI experiment, we need to identify V1 and for the TMS experiment,
Mikellidou et al. 7
we need to identify V1, LO1, and LO2. All imaging data involved in the process of
retinotopic mapping were acquired on a GE 3-Tesla Signa HD Excite scanner at the
YNiC, University of York.
A rotating wedge was used to map polar angle and expanding rings were used to map
eccentricity and standard Fourier methods were used to analyze the retinotopic data (DeYoe
et al., 1996; Engel et al., 1997; Sereno et al., 1995). Stimuli were unmasked portions of a
100% contrast radial checkerboard (14 radius) with 24 radial segments on a mean gray
background. Wedges were 90 in size and rotated counterclockwise about a red fixation cross.
Ring stimuli expanded about fixation. Participants maintained fixation throughout the scan.
Both wedges and rings were high contrast (>98%, 400 cdmÀ2) checkerboard stimuli that
reversed contrast at a rate of 6 Hz. For the fMRI experiment, four scans were collected (two
wedges and two rings) and each scan contained seven cycles of wedges/rings, with 36 s per
cycle. For the TMS experiments, eight scans were collected (four wedges and four rings) and
each scan contained eight cycles of wedges/rings, with 36 s per cycle. For both the fMRI and
TMS experiments, data were averaged across scans.
Functional data across all sessions were aligned to a canonical anatomical volume using a
proton-density image acquired with the same prescription as the functional data as an
intermediate alignment step. Motion correction was achieved using FSL's MCFLIRT
(Jenkinson, Bannister, Brady, & Smith, 2002) and no significant movements were seen
throughout scanning. The functional time series were high-pass filtered to remove baseline
drifts. We used mrVista and mrMesh analysis software to perform the retinotopic analysis
and visualize data in volume and inflated cortical views (http://white.stanford.edu). Visual
areas were hand drawn on these inflated cortical views according to established reversals in
polar angle demarcating specific visual areas (Larsson, Heeger, et al., 2006; Wandell,
Dumoulin, & Brewer, 2007).
The anatomical data that provided a canonical volume were acquired with different
procedures for the fMRI study and for the follow-up TMS study. For the fMRI study, a
3D-Fast Spoiled Gradient-Recalled Echo (FSPGR) sequence was used to acquire multi-
average, whole-head T1-weighted anatomical volumes for each participant (repetition time
[TR] ¼ 7.8 ms, time to echo [TE] ¼ 3 ms, TI ¼ 450 ms, field of view [FOV] ¼ 290 Â 290 Â 176,
256 Â 256 Â 176 matrix, flip angle ¼ 20, 1.13 Â 1.13 Â 1.0 mm3). Data were obtained with an
eight-channel head coil. For the TMS study, we adopted a revised protocol that we now
routinely use to increase tissue contrast for automated segmentation: Three whole-head T1-
weighted anatomical volumes were acquired for each subject (TR ¼ 7.8 ms, TE ¼ 2.7 ms,

using a 16-channel (half-head coil) and averaged. One T2*-weighted fast gradient recalled
echo scan was also acquired (TR ¼ 400 ms, TE ¼ 4.3 ms, flip angle ¼ 25, field of
view ¼ 290 Â 290 Â 176, 256 Â 256 Â 88 matrix, 1.13 Â 1.13 Â 2 mm3) using a 16-channel
head coil. Average T1 data were divided by the T2* data in order to correct for signal
gradient resulting from the signal dropout of the 16-channel coil and to improve white/
gray matter contrast. One whole-head eight-channel T1-weighted volume was acquired for
each subject for use in coregistration for TMS (TR ¼ 7.8 ms, TE ¼ 2.9 ms, TI ¼ 450 ms, flip
angle ¼ 20, FOV ¼ 290 Â 290 Â 176, 256 Â 256 Â 176 matrix, 1.13 Â 1.1.13 Â 1 mm3). For
both methods of acquiring anatomical data, the average T1-weighted anatomical volume
was segmented into white and gray matter for each hemisphere using Freesurfer (http://
surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/). The subsequent gray-white matter segmentation was hand
edited and checked for topology errors using itkGray (http://white.stanford.edu).
For the fMRI study, retinotopy data were obtained with gradient recalled echo pulse
sequences to measure T2* BOLD data parallel to the calcarine sulcus (TR ¼ 2000 ms,
TE ¼ 30 ms, FOV ¼ 256 mm, 128 Â 128 matrix, 26 contiguous slices, slice thickness ¼
2.5 mm, in-plane resolution ¼ 2 Â 2 mm). Magnetization was allowed to reach a steady
state by discarding the first five volumes. Data were obtained with an eight-channel head
coil. For the TMS study, a revised approach was adopted that exploits the increased signal to
noise of a 16-channel coil and uses a slightly higher spatial resolution. Gradient recalled echo
pulse sequences were used to measure BOLD signals acquired parallel to the calcarine sulcus
(TR ¼ 3000 ms, TE ¼ 30 ms, flip angle ¼ 90, FOV ¼ 192 Â 192 Â 78, 96 Â 96 matrix, 39
contiguous slices per volume at 2 Â 2 Â 2 mm3). The first three volumes from all scans were
discarded to allow the magnetization to reach magnetization steady state.
Procedure for the fMRI Study Examining the Extent of BOLD Responses in V1 Elicited by
Horizontally and Vertically Lined Stimuli
To obtain robust V1 responses in fMRI, we varied the contrast of the lined rectangles by
alternating their luminance between 20 and 0 cdmÀ2 every 300 ms (contrast reversal 1.67 Hz)
on a uniform grey background (10 cdmÀ2). Stimuli were rear projected onto an acrylic screen
and viewed by participants lying supine in the scanner from 57 cm via a front-silvered mirror
mounted onto the MRI head coil. To determine whether regions of the early visual cortex
have a representation for perceptual differences, we presented stimuli on either side of
fixation while acquiring T2* weighted volumes.
In the first out of four stimulus conditions employed, Helmholtz's squares consisting of a
horizontally striped and a vertically striped square of identical dimensions (6.6 Â 6.6; seven
lines; duty cycle ¼ 0.9; spatial frequency ¼ 1.30c/). The vertically and horizontally lined
squares appeared in the left and right hemifields, respectively, in one condition and vice
versa in the other. In the other two conditions, in order to compensate for the Helmholtz's
squares illusion, the pre-fMRI psychophysics results from each individual were used to adjust
the width of the horizontally striped square such that it would be perceptually matched with
the vertically lined square. As before, the vertically and horizontally lined stimuli appeared in
left and right hemifields, respectively, in one condition, and vice versa in another. Each
stimulus condition was presented for a block of 9 s followed by a 9 s block of uniform
gray. In total, eight blocks per condition were presented in a pseudorandom order. The
duration of the run was therefore 4 conditions Â 8 blocks Â 18 s ¼ 576 s. Each participant
completed two runs. Because the block length of 9 s was much longer than the 0.6 s
stimulus duration we used in psychophysics, we tested one of our participants with this
Mikellidou et al. 9
longer (9 s) stimulus duration and found that their results were unchanged (control PSE:
6.57 [short duration 0.6 s] vs. 6.59 [long duration 9 s]; illusion PSE: 7.17 [short duration
0.6 s] vs. 7.20 [long duration 9 s]).
We used a demanding central attention task to ensure that participants maintained
fixation, as small shifts in gaze could hinder our ability to detect small changes in the
extent of cortical BOLD responses. A fixation task also serves to minimize top-down
influences on V1. In the task, participants fixate a small white central square and count
the number of times the position of a smaller red square, which was flashed randomly at
one of the eight immediately surrounding locations, appeared at 12 o'clock. At the end of
each run, participants reported the count. The accuracy on this very demanding task varied
between 70 and 97%.
The fMRI acquisition parameters were identical to those used for the retinotopic mapping
data and yielded the relatively high in-plane resolution of 2 Â 2 mm2 that was required to test
our hypotheses. The fMRI data were also motion corrected and aligned to the canonical
anatomical data as specified earlier. We then computed t-statistics from general linear
modelling as implemented in mrVista. In this process, data were first high pass filtered
with a boxcar function of duration of 18 s. Otherwise, data were left spatially unsmoothed
but were up-sampled when transformed to the anatomical space. The spatial distribution of
the t-statistic data along the representation of the horizontal meridian was analyzed as
specified in the design of the study (described earlier and see also Figure 1).
Procedure for the TMS Study Examining the Causal Roles of V1, LO1, and LO2 in
Size Perception
For the TMS study, we assessed our retinotopic mapping data to locate the targets for
stimulation. The identification of LO1 and LO2 is identical to that described previously
(Silson et al., 2013). V1 was identified from the polar angle data as the hemifield map
found in calcarine cortex. Targets for TMS were selected from the hemisphere in which
LO1 and LO2 were most clearly identifiable, resulting in the left hemisphere being
stimulated in five observers (Table 3). For each participant, centroids for V1, LO1, and
LO2 were calculated for accurate TMS coil targeting using the Brainsight system (Rogue
Research). The distance between these centroids is shown in Table 3. Further, we included an
optimal trajectory for all ROIs that specified the angular approach of the TMS coil to the
target region. For LO1 and LO2, the trajectories were set approximately parallel to one

another, each going through the center of mass the respective ROI. Using retinotopic
eccentricity maps, we restricted the V1 ROI to the center of the Helmholtz stimuli (2.8).
To maximize the effects of TMS along the horizontal meridian, a trajectory was created in
Brainsight that aligned the TMS coil down the calcarine sulcus through the center of this
ROI. Having gathered fMRI data for relatively large, more eccentric Helmholtz stimuli, we
knew that we needed to create smaller, less eccentric Helmholtz stimuli in order to make them
accessible to TMS stimulation.
For each 200 ms stimulus presentation (Figure 3a), a train of four biphasic pulses,
separated by 50 ms (20 Hz) were delivered at 70% of the max stimulator output (2.6 T). As
we did not have specific predictions about feedforward versus feedback processing, we used
this protocol to cover time periods that should be influenced by both processes. Pulses were
delivered by a Magstim `figure of 8' coil connected to a Magstim Rapid 2 stimulator.
Participants were seated in a custom built chair with chin rest and temple support.
The coil was mechanically secured, placed directly above the cortical target, and pressed
flush against the participants scalp to minimize the coil-target distance. The coil was
tracked in real time to provide trial-by-trial measurements of coil-target distance and coil-
target offset.
Each subject underwent four counterbalanced sessions (no TMS and TMS to V1, LO1, or
LO2). During each session, four trial types were presented: Horizontally lined stimuli that
were (a) perceptually and (b) physically square, and vertically lined stimuli that were (a)
perceptually and (b) physically square. There were 50 presentations of each trial type
(total 200 trials). The no TMS session took approximately 10 minutes to complete and
each TMS session took approximately 20 minutes to complete. The order of trials was
randomized with a minimum ITI of 2000 ms in addition to the participants' reaction time.
Trials for which coil-target displacement was large (>2.5 mm), or reaction time was greater
than 2000 ms after the offset of the stimulus, were removed from the analysis ($1%). We
included trials in which physically square stimuli were presented because they can allow us to
test whether participant response become biased to wider or taller as a result of TMS or as a
result of the orientation of the stimuli. For example, the predicted release from the illusion
would mean that horizontally lined stimulus that was set to be perceptually square would be
perceived as wider, a response that might arise if a bias related to the stimulus orientation
occurs. However, such a bias would be expressed for the physically square, horizontally lined
stimuli, so examination of responses to the square stimuli will show whether an orientation
and TMS-dependent bias in aspect ratio judgments arises.
Two observers (S2 and S5) did not experience the Helmholtz illusion for the vertically
striped stimuli (see Table 2). We would not expect to be able to elicit a release from the
illusion when the illusion is not present and therefore excluded trials to the vertically lined
stimuli for these two observers from the analysis. We recruited eight participants for the TMS
experiment. One participant did not complete the experiment due to salient phosphenes
which they found distracted them from the task.
Results
Assessing the Extent of BOLD Responses in V1 and Its Relationship With an Illusory
Percept of Size
For each observer, we first established psychophysically the extent of the Helmholtz squares
illusion (see Experimental Procedures, Table 1). By increasing the width of the horizontally
lined squares, we generated stimuli that cancelled the illusion; these stimuli were perceptually
Mikellidou et al. 11
square, but physically rectangular (Figure 1a). During the fMRI experiments, participants
viewed three different stimuli: a vertically lined square, a horizontally lined square, and a
horizontally lined rectangle whose width was perceptually matched to the vertically lined
square, but as a result was physically wider. These stimuli were presented in a different
pairing (see Methods section) that allowed the calculation of contrasts to examine whether
V1 maps the perceptual or physical dimensions on the stimuli. Figure 2a illustrates these
contrasts and the associated predictions for V1 mapping the perceived stimulus width (top
panel) or V1 mapping the physical stimulus width (bottom panel).
Comparisons (i) and (ii) allow us to gauge whether our measures are sensitive to detect
changes in physical size which are equivalent to the perceived changes observers experience in
the illusion (Figure 2a). Comparisons (iii) and (iv) will have very different results depending
on the role of V1 in the Helmholtz squares illusion (Figure 2a). If stimulus-driven BOLD
responses in V1 underlies the illusion, stimuli of matched physical width defined by
orthogonal line orientation will elicit different activity profiles, whereas those matched for
perceived size should register no difference in activity profile (Figure 2a--top row). If
however stimulus-driven BOLD responses follows the physical dimensions of the stimulus,
we predict the opposite (Figure 2a--bottom row).
Data showing D for each individual are shown in Figure 2b. The pattern of results is
largely uniform across participants. This pattern is confirmed in the group means shown in
Figure 2c. The value of D is distributed around zero for stimuli of the same orientation and
dimensions (contrast (i)), whereas the contrast between stimuli of the same orientation, but
different dimensions (contrast (ii)) is positive. Taken together, these results confirm that our
scanning parameters appeared sensitive enough to detect relatively small physical differences
in V1. The crucial comparisons to determine whether V1 maps the perceived size of the
stimulus come from contrasts iii and iv. For contrast iii, D is again distributed around
zero showing that for stimuli of different orientation, but identical physical dimensions,
the extent of BOLD responses in V1 is very similar. In the situation when the stimuli
differ in orientation, but are matched perceptually, D is positive reflecting V1's sensitivity
to unequal size of the stimuli. Qualitatively, therefore, the pattern of the data (Figure 2b) is
indistinguishable from the lower panel of Figure 2a in which the prediction of the results for
``V1 maps physical stimulus width'' is given.
The data fit neatly in a framework that can be assessed statistically with a two-way
analysis of variance (ANOVA), the factors being physical width (same/wider) and
orientation (parallel/orthogonal). A significant main effect of physical width, F(1, 7) ¼ 11.4,
p ¼ .012), but not orientation, F(1, 7) ¼ 0.05, p ¼ .826, was found. The interaction between
physical width and orientation was not significant, F(1, 7) ¼ 0.33, p ¼ .582. The extent of
BOLD responses along the representation of the horizontal meridian is therefore entirely
explained by the physical dimensions of the stimuli. It is important to note that this is not a
null result; the extent of BOLD responses changes significantly in V1 as a result of a change in
the dimension of the stimulus, but the change is not dependent on the orientation of the
stimuli, which does affect our perception.
The Causal Role of V1, LO1, and LO2 in an Illusory Percept of Size
Having established that stimulus-driven BOLD responses in V1 do not underpin the
Helmholtz squares illusion, we asked whether this result arose because the illusion is
underpinned by neural processing outside of V1. To answer this question, we had
participants make judgments on perceptually square horizontally and vertically lined stimuli
while we applied TMS to three candidate regions: V1 and extrastriate LO1 and LO2 (Figure 3a;
12 i-Perception 0(0)
Larsson, Heeger, et al., 2006). As before, each participant was tested ahead of the TMS session
to determine the dimensions of the rectangle that were perceived square (Table 2).
If TMS successfully disrupts neural processing specific to one's percept of the Helmholtz
squares illusion, a release from the illusion would be experienced. The more the illusion
dissipates, the more the physical anisotropy of the stimuli will become apparent, and
therefore the more correct responses will be made by the observer. If TMS does not
interfere with processing specific to the illusion, we would expect no change in the
proportion of correct responses. That is we expect responses around chance (0.5) for a
stimulus that is perceptually square where the participant has to make a forced choice
response--taller or wider? For the no TMS condition, responses were not at floor (0.5)
but around 0.65 (Figure 3c), suggesting that during the psychophysics, participants had a
tendency to overcorrect for the Illusion. Even at 0.65, there is plenty of room for a
release from the illusion (toward 1.0), so this overcorrection did not hinder the design of
the study.
The individual data detailing the proportion of correct responses across the baseline no
TMS and TMS (V1, LO1, and LO2) sessions are shown in Figure 3b. It is clear that in each
observer (except S3), TMS to LO1 results in the greatest number of veridical responses. This
is reflected in the group means as shown in Figure 3c. A one-way repeated measures ANOVA
revealed a significant main effect of TMS site stimulation, F(3, 18) ¼ 9.93, p ¼ .00004. We
compared proportion of correct responses among the four conditions by conducting six
pairwise t-tests (two-tailed, Bonferroni corrected). Compared to the no TMS condition
(M ¼ 0.65, SD ¼ .12), TMS of area V1 does not compromise the strength of the illusion,

M ¼ 0.68, SD ¼ .14; t(6) ¼ 1.49, p ¼ .99. Interestingly, only disruption of area LO1
compromised significantly the strength of the illusion compared with the no TMS
condition, M ¼ 0.78, SD ¼ .17; t(6) ¼ 3.85, p ¼ .048, emphasizing the importance of LO1 in
processing of orientation information (Larsson, Landy, & Heeger, 2006; Silson et al., 2013;
Tibber, Anderson, Melmoth, Rees, & Morgan, 2009). Disruption of LO1 processing lead to
significantly more veridical responses compared with disruption of V1, t(6) ¼ 4.14, p ¼ .036.
Further, disruption of LO1 led to significantly more veridical responses compared with
disruption of LO2, t(6) ¼ 4.21, p ¼ .03. Selective stimulation of LO2 (M ¼ 0.66, SD ¼ .17)
did not significantly affect the proportion of veridical responses compared with no TMS,
t(6) ¼ 0.64, p ¼ .99, and V1 stimulation, t(6) ¼ 1.0, p ¼ .99).
Exploring Potential Explanations of the TMS Results
The TMS task reported here is largely robust to nontask specific effects such as increased
distraction owing to discomfort during TMS. Task distraction would most likely result in one
guessing, causing responses to move toward floor (0.5) in the opposite direction to a predicted
release from the illusion. Still, we wanted to rule out whether TMS to LO1 or LO2 interfered
with visual tasks in general. That is, was the TMS site-specific effect we observed for the
aspect ratio judgments also specific to that task? To do this, we had six of our seven
participants perform a contour integration task (not part of the original design reported
here). Participants were required to indicate in which of two temporal intervals, a contour,
defined by aligned Gabor elements within an array of randomly orientated Gabors, appeared
(Field, Hayes, & Hess, 1993). We found no effect of the site of TMS on performance in this
task, F(2, 10) ¼ 0.78, p ¼ .93. Task performance for TMS to LO1 and LO2 was, M ¼ 0.72
SD ¼ .02 and M ¼ 0.73 SD ¼ .05, respectively. A two (Experiment: contour integration,
Helmholtz) by three (ROI: no TMS, LO1, and LO2) repeated measures ANOVA found
no main effect of experiment, F(1,5) ¼ 0.22, p ¼ .656, a significant main effect of ROI F(2,
10) ¼ 4.14, p ¼ .049, and importantly, a significant interaction between experiment and ROI,
F(2, 10) ¼ 8.72, p ¼ .006), indicating that the effect of TMS to LO1 was specific to the
Helmholtz stimuli reported here.

Because response bias may occur during TMS stimulation, we designed the experiment to
include stimuli to explore this possibility (see Methods section). A response bias related to the
orientation of the stimuli could provide a pattern of results that is interpreted as a release from
the illusion (a bias in reporting wider for horizontal stimuli and taller for vertical stimuli). To
check for response bias, we presented physically square stimuli of different line orientation
which normally show the illusion. A one-way ANOVA for the horizontally lined, F(3,
18) ¼ 0.29, p ¼ .831, and vertically lined, F(3, 18) ¼ 1.03, p ¼ .401, physically square stimuli
showed responses to these stimuli to be constant across all experimental conditions (no TMS,
V1, LO1, and LO2) ruling out the possible role of observer response bias in this experiment.
A speed-accuracy trade-off, although unlikely, could cause the pattern of results reported
here. That is, participants may take longer to respond in order to increase accuracy. Reaction
times across all conditions are shown in Figure 4a. No significant differences were found, F(3,
18) ¼ .338, p ¼ .798, ruling out an explanation based on a speed­accuracy trade-off.
A change in coil-target distance or coil-target error (the offset between the desired and
actual position of the TMS coil) could also account for the pattern of results reported here.
No differences were found between conditions for these measures: Figure 4b coil-target
distance, F(2, 12) ¼ .251, p ¼ .782; Figure 4c coil-target offset, F(2, 12) ¼ .039, p ¼ .962.
These results suggest that neither changes in coil-target distance nor coil-target error can
account for the pattern of results reported here.
Importantly, as we discussed earlier, the effective depth of the figure-8 coil used in this
experiment is 2 to 3 cm (Deng, Lisanby, & Peterchev, 2013; Thielscher & Kammer, 2004).
Figure 4b shows that the average coil-target distance for V1, LO1, and LO2, was 1.80 cm,
1.83 cm, and 1.93 cm, respectively, indicating that TMS is effective and equally so across our
stimulation sites. Further, the coil-target offset was very small<0.5 mm, indicating accurate
TMS coil positioning across conditions (Figure 4c).
Discussion
We established psychophysically the extent of the illusion and how to generate stimuli that
cancelled it; these stimuli were perceptually square, but physically rectangular. Crucially, we
could use these stimuli to probe whether visual cortex mapped physical or perceptual size.
First, we confirmed that the extent of BOLD responses in V1 followed the physical
dimensions of the stimulus rather than its perceived dimensions. These results therefore
served to confirm that the processing specific to V1 was not sufficient to give rise to the
Figure 4. Plots of potentially confounding variables for the PSE-matched Helmholtz stimuli. (a) Reaction
time. (b) Coil-target distance. (c) Coil-target offset. Error bars represent the standard error of the mean. No
significant differences were found between any of the conditions reported here.

illusion (Fang et al., 2008). Second, during perceptual judgments of stimuli that cancelled the
illusion, we found that TMS to LO1, and not V1 or LO2, shifted participants' perception
from the illusory to the physical dimensions of the stimuli.
While BOLD responses in V1 can undoubtedly be modulated by illusory percepts (Fang
et al., 2008; He et al., 2015; Kok et al., 2016; Kok & De Lange, 2014; Murray et al., 2006;
Pooresmaeili et al., 2013; Sperandio et al., 2012), our results show that V1 does not have the
capacity to cause the illusory percept itself. We are able to draw this conclusion on the basis
that we were able to document small, but significant changes in the extent of BOLD responses
in primary visual cortex that followed only physical, rather than perceptual dimensions of the
stimulus. Had primary visual cortex followed the illusion, our methods were sensitive enough
to detect it. Importantly, and in contrast with previous reports, we provide causal evidence
illustrating that extrastriate, rather than primary visual cortex, is responsible for the
experience of a size illusion. This result stands alongside existing evidence suggesting other
illusions may have a neural locus in the extrastriate lateral occipital area as observed for the
Mu
¨ ller-Lyer illusion (Weidner & Fink, 2007) and Kanizsa-type illusory figures (Wokke,
Vandenbroucke, Scholte, & Lamme, 2012).
We designed our study after Fang et al. (2008) who found illusion-related BOLD
responses in V1 dissipated when attention was occupied using a demanding central fixation
task. The authors reasoned that reducing attention to the 2-D contextual surround that gives
rise to the Ponzo illusion likely reduces feedback to V1 from extrastriate regions known to
process these 2-D depth cues. By similarly occupying attention in the fMRI study reported
here, we aimed to reduce any effects of top-down feedback and thus bias our measures to
look at stimulus-driven BOLD responses in V1. However, more recent work published since
we designed our study suggests that occupying attention may not rule out feedback signals to
V1. Kok et al. (2016) examined perceptual completion of Kanizsa-type figures and found
illusion-related BOLD responses in the in the deep layer of V1, known to receive extrastriate
feedback, when attention was occupied centrally. It should be noted that although no
significant difference was observed, there was a reduction in illusion-related BOLD
responses when attention was occupied using a more demanding task (Kok & De Lange,
2014). Importantly then, by simply manipulating attention, we cannot distinguish between
V1-specific and feedback accounts of illusion-related BOLD responses in V1, as in both cases
discussed earlier, the illusion-related BOLD responses in V1 can be attributed to feedback
(Fang et al., 2008; Kok & De Lange, 2014). Thus, it is important to examine what causal roles
visual areas play in illusions with the use of TMS. The efficacy of such an approach has been
demonstrated by Maus et al. who find only TMS to MTþ, but not V1, reduces the flash-lag
illusion (Maus, Ward, Nijhawan, & Whitney, 2013). These TMS findings dovetail with
evidence for a neural correlate of the flash-lag effect in MTþ, and not V1, observed when
participants' attention was occupied centrally (Maus, Fischer, & Whitney, 2013). During the
TMS study reported here, we had participants fixate centrally while assessing the aspect ratio
of the stimuli presented to them, rather than perform the demanding fixation task we used in
fMRI. The absence of an effect of TMS to V1 during a stimulus-related task means that even
if V1 were to show illusion-related BOLD responses, which we may have failed to detect
because of the absence of a stimulus-related task, it does not appear to play a causal role in
the illusory percept. It is important to note that there is no methodological reason why we
should have encountered a lack of effect of TMS to V1. We ensured that the stimuli were
located such that their representation in V1 was relatively near the scalp surface, which meant
that the distance between the coil and neural tissue was not significantly different across our
three stimulation sites (V1, LO1, and LO2; Figure 4). The capacity for TMS to disrupt neural
processing should therefore be equal for all sites.

While it is plausible that many reports of illusory effects correlating with V1 BOLD
responses reflect feedback from higher visual areas (Fang et al., 2008; Kok et al., 2016;
Kok & De Lange, 2014; Murray et al., 2006), three recent reports may prove to be
exceptions. First, changes in perceived size, resulting from adaptation, could originate in
V1. However, similar effects found in area V2 (Pooresmaeili et al., 2013) pose a challenge
in distinguishing between feedforward and feedback propagation of signals (Chouinard &
Ivanowich, 2014). Second, while there is compelling evidence demonstrating that Emmert's
illusion can elicit a commensurate distortion of V1 retinotopy (Sperandio et al., 2012), V1
itself is not essential to experience this illusory percept. This is described in the case of patient
D.B. whom, having had their right primary visual cortex removed, still experienced Emmert's
illusion as a prime-sight' in their left visual field (Weiskrantz, Cowey, & Hodinott-Hill, 2002).
Third, distortions to Gabor stimuli found in Macaque V1 are predicted based on the
receptive field properties of V1 neurons, a finding that is mirrored in human
psychophysical data (Michel et al., 2013). It is likely however that this effect is specific to
stimuli that matched the dimensions of the putative receptive fields. Our results show that at a
different scale, for the Helmholtz stimuli used here, the opposite perceptual distortion is
found and that this distortion is not reflected in V1 BOLD responses.
So, it appears that while evidence exists for a change in the BOLD response profile of V1
that follows visual illusions (He et al., 2015; Kok et al., 2016; Kok & De Lange, 2014; Murray
et al., 2006; Ni, Murray, & Horwitz, 2014; Sperandio et al., 2012), recent work suggests it
likely originates from feedback from extrastriate cortex (Fang et al., 2008; Kok et al., 2016;
Kok & De Lange, 2014; Weiskrantz et al., 2002) and may not play a causal role in our
perception. However, to make such conclusions requires careful examination of the
neurochronometric processing between V1 and extrastriate regions. Our approach to this
was to select a TMS protocol that covered the canonical time periods for both feedforward
and feedback processing between V1 and extrastriate regions (see Methods section). By
choosing this protocol, we believe that we captured both feedforward and feedback
processing related to the Helmholtz illusion during TMS stimulation. Alternative, elegant
strategies have also been used; Wokke et al. show using single and double-pulse TMS that
one's percept of Kanizsa-type illusory figures is disrupted at an early, feedforward time
signature in LO, and a late, feedback time signature in V1, suggesting that both early
processing in LO and feedback to V1 contribute to the perceptual completion of these
figures (Wokke et al., 2012). It is important then that future studies also examine such
feedforward and feedback processing by using TMS pulses of varying latencies. This
neurochronometric approach could be used to study different illusions, including those
that require 2-D contextual surrounds (e.g., Ponzo), to explore whether V1 is causally
involved in the illusion or if specific extrastriate loci underpin those illusions (Maus,
Fischer, et al., 2013; Wokke et al., 2012). Further, future studies could examine potential
roles of extrastriate regions other than LO1 and LO2 in the Helmholtz illusion.
One question is how TMS stimulation to orientation-specific LO1 may affect a release
from the illusion, whereas TMS stimulation to shape-specific LO2 does not (Silson et al.,
2013). Given that the Helmholtz illusion is dependent on orientation, disrupting orientation-
specific processing may be expected to result in a release from the illusion as we observed with
stimulation to LO1--in a classic psychophysical sense, we can think of perception and thus
the PSE shifting toward the veridical dimension of the physically stretched stimulus.
Disrupting shape-specific processing as would be predicted when stimulating LO2 should
lead only to shape estimates becoming more variable, affecting the just noticeable difference
without shifting the PSE. Further research could ask whether such effects do result from
TMS to LO2, but it is noted that TMS experiments of this type would require a very large
Mikellidou et al. 17
number of trials to fully capture the psychometric function. Due to TMS safety, concerns
(Rossi et al., 2009), and the four stimulus types used here, we used a limited number of trials
and did therefore not capture full psychometric functions. The influence of TMS on neural
processing is not entirely clear. However, the disruption of orientation-specific processing in
LO1 is likely a result of increased noise, which degrades an orientation signal that gives rise to
the illusion.
To conclude, we identify a specific extrastriate area, LO1, that underpins an illusion of size
dependent upon the orientation of lined rectangles. Moreover, V1 appears not to be causally
involved in the illusory percept, a finding that may also generalize to other illusions of size.

Author Biographies
Kyriaki Mikellidou originally from Cyprus, received her degree in
Psychology at the University of York, UK. She was then awarded
with a departmental scholarship to do an MSc in Cognitive
Neuroscience, and in 2009 she received a three-year education
grant from the A G Leventis Foundation to continue her studies
with a PhD in Psychology at the University of York under the
supervision of Peter Thompson and Antony Morland. Following
the completion of her PhD in 2013 she joined the PisaVision lab to
work with David Burr and Concetta Morrone. Currently, she is
studying the human visual system by carrying out both
psychophysics and neuroimaging experiments in healthy
volunteers as well as members of the clinical population.
Andre
´ D. Gouws is a neuroscientist at the York Neuroimaging
Centre. He earned his degree in Physiology at the University of
Newcastle, and a PhD in Psychology from the University of
York. His research interests include the use of multimodal
neuroimaging techniques and psychophysics to characterize the
function and structure of the visual system in health and disease.

Antony B. Morland is Professor of Visual Neuroscience in the
Department of Psychology and the Head of Neuroscience in the
Hull-York Medical School. He read Physics at Imperial College,
London, UK and stayed there to study for his PhD on deficits in
human colour vision. His postdoctoral studies on visual
dysfunction continued in London in collaboration between
Imperial College and the Medical Research Council's Human
Movement and Balance Unit. In 1997 he was awarded a
Wellcome Trust Research Career Development Fellowship that
allowed him to travel to Stanford University, where he learned
fMRI techniques for assessing visual cortical function. He has
used these techniques to investigate how the visual areas of the brain are organized in
health and disease.
Bruce D. Keefe received his PhD after completing a 1+3 ESRC
fellowship at the University of Wales Bangor. He currently works
at the York Neuroimaging Centre with Tony Morland where he
uses a combination of psychophysics, neuroimaging, and
transcranial magnetic stimulation to study human vision.
