Introduction
How has the Great Recession impacted democracy? One
concern is that democratic accountability could be threat-
ened, if bad economic conditions trigger disenchantment
and abstention. Although the current situation is not so
bleak, the three European countries most damaged by the
latest economic crisis have recently experienced significant
decreases in voter turnout rates. In the last two general elec-
tions, Spain's turnout dropped from 74% to 69%, Italy's
from 81% to 75%, and Greece's from as much as 71% to
63%.1 More generally, in 2009 the European Parliament
elections recorded their lowest turnout since 1979.
This recent evidence seems to align with earlier findings
regarding the economy's effect on turnout. Rosenstone
(1982) argues that economic crises harm turnout, since vot-
ers facing economic difficulties are too preoccupied with
their personal financial situations to visit the polls. Yet the
literature devoted to examining how economic turmoil
affects turnout also points to null or even positive impacts
(Blais, 2000; Radcliff, 1992). To cast light on these mixed
results we focus on an attitude that constitutes a necessary
condition for electoral participation: the civic duty to vote.
The missing link in the rational choice equation for turn-
out, civic duty is an attitudinal element that helps us under-
stand why people show up at the polls, even if the costs of
voting exceed the benefits (Blais, 2000; Riker and
Ordeshook, 1968). Besides being a highly relevant predictor
of turnout, civic duty is also an attitude related to citizenship
norms, the legitimacy of the political system, and the citi-
zenry's general political support and engagement, all of
which are attitudinal dimensions presumably sensitive to the
economy (Armingeon and Guthmann, 2012; Córdova and
Seligson, 2009). It therefore makes sense to wonder whether
people are less inclined to consider voting in terms of civic
duty when the economic situation takes a sharp downturn.
To explore the effects of the economic crisis on civic
duty, we analyze data from Spain, a country significantly
hit by the debt crisis in Europe, especially in terms of its
youth. We use a four-wave panel survey that allows us to
track changes in Spaniards' attitudes toward voting over a
period of a year and a half (i.e., November 2010 to May
2012), during which the economy severely worsened. We
examine the effects of the economic crisis through two dif-
ferent sets of indicators: perceptions of the economy and
citizens' personal economic and working circumstances.
A call of duty in hard times: Duty to vote
and the Spanish Economic Crisis
Carol Galais and André Blais
Abstract
Although scarce, the literature addressing the effects of the economy on voter turnout and political attitudes has yielded
mixed results. By using individual, longitudinal data from Spain--a country devastated by the Great Recession--our
study illuminates how the latest economic crisis has impacted citizens' perceptions of voting. We analyze how economic
conditions and perceptions of the economy have transformed the belief that voting is a civic duty, which is one of the
strongest attitudinal predictors of turnout. Our results suggest that hard times slightly weaken citizens' sense of civic
duty, particularly among the youngest. However, the adverse effects of the economic crisis are compensated by the
positive effects of the electoral context, and as a consequence there is no aggregate decline in civic duty during the
period examined (2010­2012).

Ultimately, we ascertain how changes in such indicators are
related to changes in individuals' conception of voting as a
civic duty.
This research contributes to the existing debate on the
effects of the economy on turnout and system support in
several manners. Firstly, the study focuses on an attitude
that precedes and shapes the decision to vote, leaving aside
other explanatory factors, such as costs, benefits, and the
perceived probability of affecting the result of the elections.
This means that if we find an effect of the economic crisis
on the belief that voting is a duty, such effect on turnout
might be even larger, via other determinants. Secondly, it
uses longitudinal data, which allow us to estimate a fixed-
effects model. Therefore, our results are free from omitted
variable bias and make us pretty confident about the find-
ings. Thirdly, we examine a recent and timely example of a
deep crisis (Spain) for which we explore the role of a wide
array of objective and subjective economic variables. Thus,
we go beyond analyzing the effects of unemployment, the
most studied economic variable. Fourthly, we take into
account the specific effect of the electoral context. This
allows us to show that the negative effect of the crisis is
offset by the positive effect of the electoral context, espe-
cially among youth.
The economic crisis and attitudes toward voting
The link between the economy and turnout--more particu-
larly, between economic downturns and attitudes related to
turnout--is far from clear. While the effects of the economy
on how people vote have attracted a great deal of attention,
the impact on turnout itself remains much less explored
(Pacek and Radcliff, 1995). Moreover, studies addressing
this issue have reported inconclusive and contradictory
results. Deteriorating economic conditions have been found
to hamper turnout in the US (Rosenstone, 1982), but also to
boost it, as long as citizens can identify whom to blame
(Arcenaux, 2003). We find the same contradictions for
developing countries: economic downturns have been
found to boost turnout (Aguilar and Pacek, 2000; Radcliff,
1992) but also to have no impact whatsoever (Lavezzolo,
2008).
Findings on the matter also differ depending on the
countries under study, whether scholars approach the issue
from a macroeconomic or individual perspective, and
whether they look at specific subgroups in the population.
In fact, Rosenstone's (1982) results that support the so-
called `withdrawal hypothesis'fail for disadvantaged social
groups, which are more motivated to vote during economic
crises (Southwell, 1996).
In light of the Great Recession that began in 2007, the
link between the economy and electoral outcomes has
been reexamined, although voter choice has received far
more attention than turnout. Such continued neglect of the
latter further justifies our attention to civic duty, which
stands out as a chief predictor of turnout. If the latest sus-
tained economic crisis has eroded the moral basis for vot-
ing, then turnout is bound to decrease in the future. Civic
duty is the least `rational' determinant of turnout, hence
presumably the least sensitive to the economy. If we show
that the economy is able to hamper it, the negative effects
of the economy on turnout may be even larger, as eco-
nomic downturns will probably also affect individuals'
resources and incentives.
In this respect, some recent studies suggest an erosion of
attitudes related to system support. For instance, Stevenson
and Wolfers (2011) find that the crisis has had detrimental
effects on trust in public institutions, while Armingeon and
Guthmann (2012) show a relationship between negative
perceptions of the economic crisis and a decrease of trust in
legislatures. These detrimental effects could be larger in
younger democracies, and damage trust in elections and
even support for representative democracy (Córdova and
Seligson, 2009). The question therefore becomes whether
the recent economic crisis has similar negative effects on
citizens' duty to vote.
In this regard, two theories offer different causal mecha-
nisms to explain the link between the crisis and changes in
voter attitudes (Newton and Norris, 2000). On the one
hand, the socio-cultural perspective emphasizes the role of
individual life situations and experiences in shaping civic
mindedness and other attitudes consistent with democracy.
In this model, worsened economic conditions may compel
citizens to focus on personal interests instead of those of the
community, thereby weakening the social value of voting
as a duty. This strand of research is in line with the so-called
`withdrawal hypothesis' (Rosenstone, 1982). From this
point of view, the economic crisis may alter the normal tra-
jectory of life events by delaying the transition to adult-
hood. Thus, the emergence of new adult interests, such as
politics, may be belated. In this sense, a voter's member-
ship in a disadvantaged group may undermine the develop-
ment of a sense of civic duty.
Unemployment is by far the most analyzed aspect of
economic adversity, although the evidence about its effects
is mixed. More precisely, becoming unemployed has been
found to be consistently, albeit weakly, related to support
for social policies aimed at helping the poor (Margalit,
2013; Schlozman and Verba, 1979). If we focus more spe-
cifically on political involvement, most studies conclude
that unemployment (particularly among the youth) relates
to lower levels of participation, especially electoral partici-
pation, and reduces political interest and trust (Anderson,
2001; Bay and Blekesaune, 2002; De Witte, 1992). Yet this
literature is far from consensual. Some studies, especially
the most recent, do not seem to reach such pessimistic con-
clusions (Giuni and Lorenzini, 2013; Lorenzini and Giuni,
2012; Parry et al., 1992).
On the other hand, the institutional performance model
suggests that perceptions of economic and political
Galais and Blais 3
conditions connect a government's performance to political
legitimacy (Almond and Verba, 1963; Weatherford, 1992).
For instance, Stulhofer and Rimac (2002) propose that
social changes stemming from the economic crisis affect
evaluations of economic, political, and social conditions,
which in turn affect dominant social values and foster cyni-
cism as well as opportunism. From this perspective, a wors-
ening of the economy adversely affects the civic duty to
vote out of disappointment with the system's performance.
However, it has also been found that individuals facing eco-
nomic adversity who blame the government for their situa-
tion are actually more likely to vote (Arceneaux, 2003).
Altogether, the impact of economic situations on citizens'
perceptions of voting is quite unclear.
The Spanish economic crisis
To understand how the economy can affect attitudinal
change regarding turnout, it is necessary to control for two
elements: the political context and a voter's belonging to
a disadvantaged group. As regards contextual effects,
some citizens may revise their sense of duty as an election
approaches, as they do with respect to trust in democracy
or political institutions (Bowler and Donovan, 2002;
Franklin, 2004). Indeed, general political attitudes have
been shown to react more to political factors (e.g., elec-
toral campaigns) than to economic conditions (Bratton
and Mattes, 2001; Clarke et al., 1993; Evans and
Whitefield, 1995). Therefore, the proximity of an upcom-
ing election could more than offset the negative effect of
the economic crisis.
In order to take into account changing elements of the
political context, it is particularly interesting to adopt a lon-
gitudinal perspective to keep most elements of the political
system constant. With this purpose, we examine Spain,
which held a general election in November 2011 that coin-
cided with the implementation of several austerity meas-
ures and resulted in a change in government. Spain is a
relatively young democracy that still experiences changes
in aspects of its political culture and is thus likely influ-
enced by major economic changes, such as those it has
endured since 2008. If economic downturns affect the atti-
tudinal basis of turnout, then we should be able to see such
influence in Spain. In this particular context, it is also
important to consider the effects of age, since the Great
Recession in Spain has been especially difficult for the
youngest citizens.
A quick outline of the Spanish economic crisis takes us
back to 2008, when the explosion of the real estate bubble
prompted a collapse of housing prices. This collapse
stopped housing construction and left thousands of people
in the construction industry unemployed. When banks dis-
covered that (subprime) mortgages could no longer be paid,
they drastically reduced loans to businesses and individu-
als, which only worsened the economic situation.
Mortgages and evictions constitute significant dimen-
sions of the economic crisis. Since 2007, more than 420,000
foreclosures and 220,000 evictions have occurred. By
2012, every 15 minutes one new Spanish family lost their
home yet remained in debt for their mortgages.2 Spanish
courts evict individuals unable to fulfill their mortgages,
but they must still pay off their remaining debt to the
bank--interest and late fees included--since their property
has suffered a substantial devaluation. This critical situa-
tion in turn triggered many protests against the Mortgage
Law. In fact, a Popular Legislative Initiative requesting a
payment-in-kind formula has gathered more than 1.4 mil-
lion supporters. All in all, we can assume that surrendering
home ownership yet maintaining a huge debt triggers a
feeling of abandonment by the authorities that may jeop-
ardize a citizen's beliefs about her civic duties.
Although the European Central Bank approved a bailout
for Spanish banks in 2012, credit has not yet flowed into
individuals or enterprises. The bailout arrived in exchange
for a commitment to trimming the budget deficit to 3.6% of
the gross domestic product (GDP), which entailed addi-
tional welfare cutbacks. Consequently, unemployment
rates jumped from 8% in 2007 to 26% in 2012. For citizens
under 25 years of age, these figures are far worse: unem-
ployment among the youngest reached 50% in 2012 and
57% in 2013. Along with Ireland, Spain holds the record of
the steepest increase of youth unemployment among
European Union (EU) members since the onset of the Great
Recession (O'Higgins, 2012). As a social group, Spanish
youth has suffered most from the crisis, particularly due to
the so-called `labor-market duality,' which consisted of the
gap between temporary and permanent contracts that
impedes newcomers from accessing steady employment
(Scarpetta et al., 2010). This is important, since previous
research has shown that temporary work hampers turnout
(Gallego, 2007).
Despite this dire scenario, our data show a slight increase
in the sense that voting is a civic duty during the year and a
half under analysis. Figure 1 shows that the percentage of
respondents who felt that voting is a duty increased during
the period analyzed here, particularly among the youngest.
However, what role did the economic crisis play in this
evolution?
Research design and data collection
To test the effects of the economic crisis on perceptions of
voting as a civic duty, we used the study Centro de
Investigaciones Sociológicas (CIS) 2855, an online panel
survey conducted in four waves during a period of 18
months in November 2010, May 2011, November 2011,
and May 2012.3 Respondents were selected from an online
survey pool set up by the active recruitment of potential
respondents active in mainstream commercial websites in
Spain.4 The sample consists of Spanish citizens between
4 Research and Politics 
the ages of 16 and 45 years with Internet access, since the
survey was designed to examine attitudinal change among
young people who are theoretically open to social change.
We ran two fixed-effects linear estimations.5 Fixed-
effects estimations aim to neutralize the impact of all time-
invariant individual characteristics by producing unbiased
coefficients due to omitted time-invariant characteristics
(e.g., gender, previous socialization, education).Among the
advantages of the estimation method, the large quantity of
observations increased the degrees of freedom, reduced
collinearity among the explanatory variables, and improved
the efficiency of the estimates. Note that this constitutes a
major contribution to the existing literature on the effects of
the economic crisis. The use of longitudinal data and fixed-
effects models allows us to be more confident about our
causal claims.
We use Blais and Achen's (2012) operationalization to
assess perception of voting as a civic duty, which yields a
four-category variable ranging from 0 (i.e., not dutiful at
all) to 3 (i.e., very dutiful).6 All independent variables in
our models are recoded to range from 0 to 1. Thus, their
coefficients can be interpreted in terms of the effect on duty
across time as individuals move from its minimum to maxi-
mum value.7 Hence, a coefficient for a dichotomous item
appears as the effect of acquiring that condition during the
time span covered by our data on the evolution of civic
duty.
In our first estimation, we consider the objective and
subjective effects of the crisis. As objective indicators of
economic conditions we consider variations in the
employed/unemployed status, in income, type of work
(e.g., temporary, permanent), and mortgage (e.g., with or
without). The subjective economic variables gather several
perceptions of the economic situation, for which we create
a scale that combines three questions about perceptions of
the economy. The first asks for a general evaluation of the
Spanish economic situation, the answers to which range
from `very bad' to `very good'; the second asks for an eval-
uation compared to a year ago, for which possible answers
are `worse,' `the same,' and `better.' For the third question,
the respondents are asked to evaluate the likely evolution of
the economic situation by the same time next year. All
questions are recoded to range between 0 and 1, then added
(Cronbach's alpha of 0.63) and rescaled again to range
from 0 to 1. A fourth subjective indicator refers to the eval-
uation of one's personal economic condition compared to a
year ago. The answers (worse, same, better) have also been
recoded to range from 0 to 1; the lowest value indicating a
negative evaluation. For more details on the descriptive sta-
tistics of these variables, see the appendix.
The second estimation adds period effects operational-
ized by means of dummy variables, leaving Wave 1 as the
reference category. Wave dummies should then be inter-
preted as the average increase in the level of the depend-
ent variable compared to Wave 1, everything else being
equal. This is aimed to take the political context into
account, and more specifically the electoral campaign
held during Wave 3 fieldwork. This is consistent with
two-way fixed-effect panel model specifications, which
seek to account for unobserved heterogeneity across both
time and individuals.
Finally, both the first and the last estimation account for
youth vulnerability by interacting the independent varia-
bles with the age of the respondent. For this purpose, age is
rescaled so that its minimum value (i.e., 16 years old) takes
the value of 0 and its maximum (i.e., 45 years old) the value
of 29. This way, the interpretation of interaction effects
becomes simpler, since any main effect will point to the
impact of an independent variable when age is at its mini-
mum value (i.e., 16 years old).
Results
Table 1 presents the results of the two fixed-effects linear
estimations of changes in perceiving voting as a civic duty.
The first specification analyzes the impact of the variables
conditional on age. The main effects of unemployment,
permanent worker, and mortgage indicate the impact of
becoming unemployed, permanently employed, or obtain-
ing a mortgage during this period on the evolution of the
belief that voting is a civic duty, among respondents 16
years of age. The coefficient for income identifies the effect
of moving from the lowest monthly income category (i.e.,
less than 300) to the maximum (i.e., more than 6000) for
younger respondents; as one gets richer (poorer) one's
sense of duty becomes stronger (weaker). Becoming unem-
ployed does not significantly weaken sense of civic duty,
neither among the youngest respondents nor among the eld-
est (see the non-significant interaction coefficient).
Similarly, losing or gaining permanent employment does
not have any effect. Contrarily, obtaining a mortgage is a

sign of status and maturity that significantly improves citi-
zens' sense of civic duty.8
The interaction coefficients for income and mortgage
status confirm that the effects of these variables on percep-
tions of voting as a civic duty are stronger for the youngest
respondents. Hence, a salary reduction or changes regard-
ing mortgages strike harder among the youngest. By con-
trast, both the scale aimed to assess the evolution of
individuals' perceptions of the economy and the indicator
that gauges the evaluation of the personal economic situa-
tion revealed that these factors play no role among any
respondents, regardless of their age.
Model 2 adds period effects to the previous estimation in
order to tap the influence of context. The estimation finds
similar effects for the objective variables and their interac-
tions with age. The main effect of age is now not signifi-
cant, as its variation within individuals is almost completely
captured by the time trend.9 Also, the effect of mortgage
and its interaction with age is only significant at 90%,
which indicates that time dummies also partly capture the
effect of economic downturn. The main effects for the wave
dummies indicate a positive impact, which is significant,
and follow an increasing trend over time. The interaction
terms show that the positive effects of an election (Wave 3)
and its aftermath (Wave 4) are less strong as age increases.
There is, therefore, a period effect caused by the election
held in November 2011, which occurred one week after
Wave 3 was conducted. Interestingly, this effect has not
decayed 6 months after the election. The magnitude of the
period effects is so important that it offsets the negative
effects of a worsened economic situation or working status
among the youngest respondents.
Regarding the relevance of these independent variables,
the F-test rejects the possibility that all coefficients are
equal to zero in both models. Additional joint significant
tests (not shown) tested the significance of the indicators of
Table 1. Fixed-effect linear estimations of the evolution of
duty to vote (November 2010­May 2012).

objective economic and working conditions, perceptions of
the economy, wave dummies, and the interactions in the
models. The results of these successive Wald tests reject the
possibility that the effects of objective indicators and all
interactions are jointly zero. They also point to the signifi-
cance of time effects, thus justifying the inclusion of year
dummies, although they also confirm that the coefficients
for the subjective perceptions of the economy and their
interactions with age are together not different from zero.
Figures 2 and 3 depict the predicted effect of changes
in income or mortgage on sense of civic duty, on the basis
of Model 1. An improvement or deterioration of income
significantly affects the perception of voting as a civic
duty only for those under 27 years of age. After that age,
the effect is indistinguishable from zero. As for mort-
gages, their effect disappears after 21 years of age.10
These age markers are generally in line with socialization
theories, which hold that most political attitudes develop
and crystallize before a person reaches 25 years of age
(Newcomb et al., 1967). Hence, poor economic condi-
tions can jeopardize attitudes toward democracy, includ-
ing the feeling that voting is a duty, but only among those
whose attitudes are still under formation: the youngest.
Reversely, the positive effects of getting socially inte-
grated by means of gaining purchasing power or the sta-
tus of homeowner play a role exclusively among the
youngest.
Conclusion
Past research on the effects of the economy on elections
focused mainly on the US, on votes (i.e., not turnout), and
on the aggregate instead of the individual level. They also
failed to take into account the effects of the political con-
text. The few studies that have incorporated some of these
elements have challenged Rosenstone's (1982) pessimistic
findings about the negative effects of economic downturns
on turnout.
In addressing the effects of the latest economic crisis on
turnout, our research brings about several novel aspects of
the topic. Firstly, we focus on a moral attitude that precedes
and anchors electoral behavior, taking a step back in the
causal chain that explains the vote. In this sense, our results
are worrisome as they suggest that the negative influence of
the crisis on turnout may perpetuate the future through its
impact on duty, even when the crisis is over. Furthermore,
as the vote is also affected by other `rational' variables pre-
sumably more sensitive to economic conditions--such as
resources and incentives--the final effect of the crisis on
turnout may be even greater.
Secondly, we go beyond testing the effects of unemploy-
ment, addressing two mechanisms by which an economic
crisis may demean the civic duty to vote: worsened per-
sonal economic circumstances and perceptions of the econ-
omy. Thirdly, by focusing on a country within the series of
especially hit by the economic crisis, we are able to take a
longitudinal perspective, and to estimate the effects of the
electoral context.
Finally, we contribute to the existing literature about the
effects of the economy on attitudes related to political
engagement and support with an innovative research
design. In our study, based on panel data, we used linear
fixed-effects models to measure the effects of the crisis on
the perception of voting as a civic duty. We found no effects
of subjective perceptions of the economy, of becoming
unemployed or a temporary worker. Nevertheless, we
detect a significant relationship between changes in income
and mortgages and the belief that voting is a civic duty.
These relationships, however, only emerge among the
youngest citizens.
To sum up, the effect of economic crisis in the evolution
of the civic duty to vote is quite modest and confined to the
youngest segment of the population. Moreover, this small

negative effect is completely offset by other factors, the
most obvious being the presence of an election. Such a
finding bodes well in the sense that adhesion to civic
responsibilities survives even in a country experiencing
very hard times. Nevertheless, it remains to be seen
whether, in the long term, a severe economic crisis could
amplify and crystallize the adverse results found among
the youngest and thereby bring Rosenstone's (1982) find-
ings back to life.

Autónoma de Barcelona (UAB) research group Democracy,
Elections and Citizenship (P.I. Eva Anduiza). It was also
financed by the Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation
(CSO2010-18534).
 4. Wave 1 consisted of 2100 respondents, while Wave 2 added
620 new respondents. Further details can be found at http://
www.netquest.com/papers/esomar26_en.pdf. We have
not excluded any respondents in order to minimize panel-
conditioning effects, a phenomenon that occurs when pan-
elists change their attitudes or behaviors as a result of being
on a panel study (Clinton, 2001; Sobol, 1959).
 5. Given the ordinality inherent in our dependent variable, the
most logical option would be an ordinal logistic estimation.
As far as we can tell, however, it is impossible to estimate
an ordinal logit model with panel data and fixed effects.
We therefore decided to estimate linear regression models,
which yield more straightforward results. Nevertheless, we
have conducted an additional test for robustness that con-
sists of dichotomizing the dependent variable (i.e., `no duty'
and `not very strong duty' versus `somewhat of a duty' and
`very strong duty') and running a logit estimation with fixed
effects. The results are practically identical to those shown
here.
 6. The exact wording is as follows:
A.
For some people voting is mostly a duty. They think they
should vote regardless of their views on the parties. For
others, voting is an option. They decide whether or not
to vote according to their opinions about the parties. For
you voting is all about:
 1. A duty ( ask B)
 2. An option
B. To what extent do you feel it a duty?
1. Very strongly
2. Somewhat strongly
3. Not very strongly
7. While the majority of respondents at some point changed
their belief regarding voting as a civic duty, other factors
experienced less variation. This was particularly true for the
mortgage indicator, for which only 8% of our respondents
experienced some change.
8. Reversely, no longer having a mortgage can mean either
wealth (i.e., the loan has been completely repaid) or, most
likely due to the situation explained above, loss of wealth
(i.e., as a consequence of foreclosure and eviction).
 9. Almost, but not completely. As some respondents entered the
study in wave 2, and depending on the date of their birthday,
they may have just `aged' one year, while others may have
given three different values for this variable.
10. According to our data, 71 individuals between 16 and 21
years old reported having a mortgage at some point. In
Spain, minors cannot be responsible for mortgages unless
they have inherited a property. We hence assume that most
of those under 18 years old and probably also some between
18 and 21 years old are referring to their parents' mortgage.
Regardless, this variable would still be tapping into varia-
tion in the purchasing power and economic status within the
family.
