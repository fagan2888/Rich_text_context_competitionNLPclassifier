ABSTRACT
Background: Total body iron calculated from serum ferritin and
soluble transferrin receptor concentrations allows for the evaluation
of the full range of iron status.
Objective: We described the distribution of total body iron and the
prevalence of iron deficiency (ID) on the basis of total body iron in
US pregnant women.
Design: We examined data from the National Health and Nutrition Ex-
amination Survey (NHANES) in 1999­2006 for 1171 pregnant women.
Results: ID prevalence (6SE) in US pregnant women, which was
defined as total body iron ,0 mg/kg, was 18.0 6 1.4%. Pregnant
women in the first trimester had a higher mean total body iron than
did pregnant women in the second or third trimesters. ID prevalence
in pregnant women increased significantly with each trimester (6.9 6
2.2%, 14.3 6 2.1%, and 29.5 6 2.7% in the first, second, and third
trimesters, respectively). Pregnant women with parity 2 had the
lowest mean total body iron and the highest prevalence of ID com-
pared with values for pregnant women with parity of 0 or 1. The ID
prevalence in non-Hispanic white pregnant women was significantly
lower than in Mexican American or non-Hispanic black pregnant
women. The mean total body iron and the prevalence of ID did not
differ by educational level or by family income.
Conclusions: To our knowledge, these are the first data on total
body iron distributions for a representative sample of US pregnant
women. Low total body iron is more prevalent in pregnant women
in the second or third trimesters, in Mexican American pregnant
women, in non-Hispanic black pregnant women, and in women with
parity 2. Am J Clin Nutr 2011;93:1312­20.
INTRODUCTION
Iron deficiency (ID) is the most common known form of
nutritional deficiency; preschool children and women of child-
bearing age are at highest risk (1). During pregnancy, the ex-
pansion of blood volume by '35% and growth of the fetus,
placenta, and other maternal tissues increase the demand for iron
from 1.0 to 1.5 mg/d to 5.0 mg/d in the second and third tri-
mesters (2, 3). The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC), the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecolo-
gists, and the Institute of Medicine recommended universal
consumption of prenatal supplements with iron to meet preg-
nancy requirements and prevent anemia (4­6). Recent random-
ized controlled trials indicated that universal supplementation
with iron to meet pregnancy requirements can reduce risk of low
birth weight and preterm births (7, 8).
In 2003, Cook et al (9, 10) introduced a method for estimating
total body iron on the basis of the ratio of soluble transferrin
receptor (sTfR) to serum ferritin. This quantitative estimate,
which expresses total body iron on the basis of body weight,
allows for an evaluation of the full range of iron status from
deficiency to excess within a population and provides information
on iron status beyond that of the ferritin model, which is tra-
ditionally used to assess the ID prevalence in the US population
(11). Positive values of total body iron represent storage iron, and
negative values of total body iron indicate tissue ID. The sug-
gested cutoff for defining ID is ,0 mg/kg (9, 10). Thus, the
measure greatly enhanced the evaluation of iron status and the
response to iron interventions in populations in which in-
flammation was uncommon or had been excluded by laboratory
screening. Published data on the use of total body iron to assess
the iron status of pregnant women supported its use in this
important at-risk group. For example, the pattern of total body
iron in pregnant Jamaican and Bolivian women (9) or in US
African American women (12) followed expected patterns,
which provided indirect evidence that the model may be valid
for use in pregnancy.
Information on the iron status of pregnant women in the United
States has been limited to monitoring anemia in low-income
pregnant women or in nonrepresentative samples (7, 8, 13­18).
However, an objective to monitor ID in pregnant women was
included, for the first time to our knowledge, in Healthy People

2010 (19). To address these needs, the National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) oversampled preg-
nant women during 1999­2006, and in 2003, NHANES started
measuring sTfR in addition to serum ferritin. A special project
that used surplus sera to measure sTfR and ferritin in pregnant
women included in NHANES 1999­2002 was undertaken to
enhance the sample of pregnant women for whom total body iron
can be assessed. In this article, to our knowledge, we present the
first estimates of total body iron, sTfR, and serum ferritin for
pregnant women included in NHANES 1999­2006. We also
examined the distribution of total body iron by survey, age group,
race-ethnicity, trimester, parity, education, and family income.
Furthermore, we evaluated prevalences and associations of ID on
the basisoftotalbodyironwiththat onthebasisofferritinorsTfR
alone or on the basis of anemia in pregnant women. These data
addressed important gaps in our knowledge about the full
spectrum of iron status in US pregnant women.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS
Study population and sample selection
Data from NHANES 1999­2006 represented the total civilian,
noninstitutionalized population in the United States for those
years. Although NHANES 1999­2006 was conducted in 2-y
cycles, for the purpose of most analyses in the current study, we
pooled data for all 8 y to obtain an adequate sample size of
pregnant women. NHANES used a stratified multistage proba-
bility sample that was based on the selection of counties, blocks,
households, and finally persons within households. The surveys
were conducted by the National Center for Health Statistics,
CDC, via household interviews followed by standardized phy-
sical examinations in mobile examination centers. Ethical ap-
proval was obtained, and written consent was received from all
participants. Procedures for data collection and analyses were
published elsewhere (20­23).
The reproductive status of subjects was based on a positive
urine pregnancy test or self-reported pregnancy. Urine pregnancy
tests were administered to all female subjects aged 12­59 y.
Pregnant women in the NHANES sample fell into 2 groups (24).
The first group consisted of women aged 15­39 y who were
eligible to be selected for a supplemental sample of pregnant
women on the basis of specific sample domain criteria related to
race-ethnicity, age, and a self-report of pregnancy at the time of
the household screening interview. The pregnancy status of the
first group was confirmed at the physical examination via lab-
oratory tests.
The second group of pregnant women consisted of women ages
15­39 y who may have been unaware of their pregnancy status at
the screening interview or who may have become pregnant in the
timebetweenthehouseholdinterviewandphysicalexaminationin
the mobile exam center and pregnant women aged ,15 or .39 y
(eg, women who were not eligible to be selected for the supple-
mental sample).
Werestrictedourstudysampletopregnantwomenwhoattended
mobile examination centers to undergo blood collection for bio-
chemical analyses (n = 1224). We excluded pregnant women who
were missing serum sTfR or ferritin measurements (n = 53). Our
final sample included 1171 pregnant women. Of the 1171 preg-
nant women in our analytic sample, 919 women were part of the
supplemental pregnancy sample identified at the screening in-
terview. Because the supplemental pregnancy sample was se-
lected to be included in the survey by using predesigned
algorithms, valid response rates could be provided for them. The
919 women from the supplemental sample in the current study
represented 65% of the selected supplemental pregnancy sample,
76% of the interviewed supplemental sample, and 81% of the
examined supplemental sample.
Laboratory analysis and variable definition
Serum sTfR and ferritin assays for 2003­2006 specimens and
the surplus specimens from 1999 to 2002 were conducted at the
National Center of Environmental Health, CDC. Methodologic
details were described earlier (11). In brief, the Tina-quant sTfR
assay (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany), which is an
automated homogeneous immunoturbidimetric assay, was per-
formed on a Hitachi 912 clinical analyzer (Roche Diagnostics,
Indianapolis, IN) (25). Because no reference range was provided
for sTfR concentrations in pregnant women, we used the manu-
facturer-specified range for women of 1.9­4.4 mg/L (25) and
defined sTfR concentrations .4.4 mg/L as a threshold for ID. The
reference range was determined by calculating the 2.5th and
97.5th percentiles for sTfR in 261 women who fulfilled all criteria
for the absence of anemia, an acute-phase response, and ID and
were consequently included into the reference population (25).
Serum ferritin was measured by using 2 methods. In 2003, a
single-incubation 2-site immunoradiometric assay (BioRad Lab-
oratories, Hercules, CA) was used. Thisassay was discontinuedby
the manufacturer in early 2004, so ferritin was measured in 2004­
2006 by the Roche Tina-quant ferritin immunoturbidimetric assay
on the Hitachi 912 clinical analyzer (Roche Diagnostics) (27). The
same Roche method as used in 2004­2006 was used to analyze the
surplus specimens from pregnant women in NHANES 1999­2002
(20, 21). Because of method differences between the BioRad and
Roche ferritin assays, concentrations obtained for 2003 samples
with the BioRad assay had to be statistically adjusted to be com-
parablewiththose obtainedfor 2004samples withtheRoche assay
for NHANES 2003­2004. This was accomplished before the data
release by the National Center for Health Statistics NCHS by
applying 3 piecewise linear-regression equations described in
detail elsewhere (26). An abnormal value for ferritin concen-
trations was defined as ,12.0 lg/L (4).
Hemoglobin was measured as part of a complete blood count in
the mobile examination centers with the Beckman Coulter MAXM
hematology flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter Inc, Fullerton, CA)
(20­23). We defined anemia for pregnant women according to
CDC thresholds (4) of a hemoglobin concentration ,110 g/L for
pregnant women in the first trimester; ,105 g/L for pregnant
women in the second trimester; ,110 g/L for pregnant women in
the third trimester; and ,110 g/L for pregnant women in an un-
known trimester. C-reactive protein (CRP) was measured at the
University of Washington by latex-enhanced nephelometry (Dade
Behring Inc, Deerfield, IL) (20­23). We defined signs of inflam-
mation as abnormal CRP concentrations .5.0 mg/L (27).
Parity was based on self-report of the number of pregnancies
that resulted in a live birth in women aged 12 y who reported
that they had ever been pregnant. Parity was categorized into 0,
1, or 2 births.

The trimester was based on the number of months pregnant
reported by the mother. Only female subjects who reported that
they were pregnant at the time of the medical examination were
asked about their trimester. The first trimester was defined as 3
mo pregnant, the second trimester was defined as 4­6 mo
pregnant, and the third trimester was defined as 7 mo pregnant.
The trimester value for women who did not know, were not
asked, or did not report how long they had been pregnant was
categorized as unknown.
Race-ethnicity was based on self-reported data. Participants
who reported they were of a Latino ethnicity other than Mexican
American and participants who reported they were from more
than one race-ethnic group were excluded from comparisons by
race-ethnic group because of the small sample size of these
groups.
Pregnant women's educational levels were based on the highest
grade or level of education completed (less than high school, high
school diploma, and more than high school). Family income was
based on the poverty-income ratio, which is the ratio of household
income to the family's appropriate poverty threshold from the US
Census Bureau.
Statistical analysis
WeplottedtheserumsTfRandferritindistributionsforpregnant
women. We log transformed ferritin [ln(ferritin)] and sTfR [ln
(sTfR)] to normalize the distributions because ferritin and sTfR
concentrations were positively skewed (28, 29). We described the
serum ferritin and sTfR distributions [geometric means and 50th
(median), 25th, and 75th percentiles]. For the distributions of total
body iron and hemoglobin, arithmetic means and percentiles were
usedbecausebothtotalbodyironandhemoglobinwerenotskewed
distributed,unlikesTfRorferritin(9,10).Percentagesofabnormal
valuesfortotalbodyiron,ferritin,sTfR,andhemoglobinwerealso
calculated.
Total body iron was calculated as previously described in
detail (11) from sTfR and ferritin concentrations by using
a formula from Cook et al (9, 10) after converting Roche sTfR
concentrations to those equivalent to the Flowers assay (30) used
in the development of the total body iron model (9, 10).
Total body ironðmg=kgÞ ¼
2 ½log10
ðsTfR 3 1000 4 ferritinÞ 2 2:8229 4 0:1207 ð1Þ
To convert the Roche sTfR concentrations to those equivalent
to the Flowers assay (30), we applied a conversion equation
derived from a previous comparison (24) of the 2 assays (n = 40):
Flowers sTfR ¼ 1:5 3 Roche sTfR þ 0:35 mg=L ð2Þ
We used the original Roche ferritin concentrations for the total-
body iron calculation because a previous comparison of the Roche
assay with the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method used
to develop the total-body iron model (9, 10) indicated that these
2 methods generated similar values (11).
For total body iron, we presented the mean and ID prevalence
(total body iron ,0 mg/kg) in pregnant women by each 2-y survey
cycle, age groups (12­19, 20­34, and 35­49 y), trimester (first,
second, third, and unknown), parity (0, 1, and 2), race-ethnic
group (non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, and Mexican
American), education (less than high school, high school diploma,
and more than high school), and family income poverty income
ratio (,130% compared with 130%).
We also conducted secondary analyses to explore the possible
effect of inflammation on our results because pregnancy can be
considered an inflammatory state. In specific, we deleted women
with elevated CRP concentrations (.5 mg/L) and compared the
prevalence of ID defined by the total body iron with those ob-
tained in the main analyses. In addition, we evaluated the as-
sociations of ID on the basis of total body iron and with that on
the basis of ferritin or sTfR alone or on the basis of anemia
overall and by trimesters and race-ethnic groups.
We used SUDAAN (version 9.2; Research Triangle Institute,
Research Triangle Park, NC) with 8-y sample weights to account
for the complex survey design. An 8-y weight variable was
created by assigning one-half of the 4-y weight (WTMEC4YR)
for 1999­2002 if the person was sampled in 1999­2002, one-
quarter of the 2-y weight (WTMEC2YR) for 2003­2004 if the
person was sampled in 2003­2004, and one-quarter of the 2-y
weight (WTMEC2YR) for 2005­2006 if the person was sampled
in 2005­2006. We calculated crude and adjusted point estimates
for total body iron. We used multiple linear regression models to
calculate the adjusted mean total body iron and predicted mar-
ginal from multiple logistic regression models to calculate ad-
justed ID prevalence. In our analyses, multiple comparisons were
made across sociodemographic characteristics in total-body iron
indicator. The point of these analyses was not to test joint hy-
potheses. Instead, we tested a priori expectations about total body
iron in relation to each characteristic. Thus, we set statistical
significance at P , 0.05, and no adjustments were made with the
recognition that some of the differences in these comparisons
may have been due to chance (31).
RESULTS
In the total sample of US pregnant women from 1999 to 2006,
the mean age was 27.5 y, and the mean parity was 1.95. The
proportions of US pregnant women who were Mexican Ameri-
can, non-Hispanic white, and non-Hispanic black, were 15.2%,
56.3%, and 15.3%, respectively. The proportions of US pregnant
women who were in their first, second, third, and unknown tri-
mesters at the time of the medical examination were 19.1%,
32.4%, 28.7%, and 19.8%, respectively. Approximately 23.3% of
US pregnant women had less than a high school education, 19.6%
of US pregnant women had high school diploma, and 57.3% of
US pregnant women had more than high school education. For
27.3% of US pregnant women, the family income was below the
130% poverty income ratio.
Means, medians, and selected percentiles and percentages of
abnormal values (prevalences of anemia or ID) of total body iron,
ferritin, serum sTfR, and hemoglobin for US pregnant women are
shown in Table 1. The prevalence of ID from ferritin (25.0%)
was significant higher (paired t test on the difference of proba-
bility of ID, P , 0.01) than that from sTfR (17.4%) or total body
iron (18.0%). However the prevalence of ID from sTfR and from
total body iron was not statistical significant (P . 0.05). The
prevalence of anemia was 5.4% (Table 1).

and prevalence of ID) stratified by selected characteristics are

presented in Table 2. Differences in the unadjusted mean total
body iron across the 2-y survey periods were not significant.
However, after adjusting for age, race-ethnic group, trimester,
parity, education and family income, mean total body iron was
significantly higher in 2003­2004 and 2005­2006 than in 1999­
2000 and 2001­2002. The unadjusted prevalence of ID of
pregnant women from 1999 to 2000 was significantly higher
than that from 2001 to 2002 and 2003­2004 but did not differ
significantly from that from 2005 to 2006. The adjusted preva-
lence of ID by survey period showed a similar pattern to the
unadjusted rates by survey years except that the prevalence for
1999­2000 was significantly different from that for 2005­2006.
Pregnant women aged 35­49 y had a higher mean total body
iron than did pregnant women ,35 y old. The prevalence of ID
in pregnant women aged 12­19 and 20­34 y was .3 times
higher (unadjusted prevalence) or .5 times higher (adjusted
prevalence) than the rate for pregnant women aged 35­49 y
(Table 2). The distribution of total body iron by 3 age groups
presented in Figure 1A showed a clear shift in the distribution
between 35­49 y pregnant women and the other 2 age groups
(12­19 and 20­34 y). However, the distribution of total body
iron in pregnant women 35­49 y was much flatter than in the
other 2 age groups (Figure 1A).
Pregnant women in the first trimester had the highest mean total
body iron compared with that of pregnant women in the second or
third trimesters. The prevalence of ID in pregnant women in-
creased with trimester. For example, the prevalence of ID for
pregnant women in the second trimester was .2 times higher
(both unadjusted and adjusted rates) than the rate for pregnant
women in the first trimester; and the prevalence of ID for preg-
nant women in the third trimester was .2 times higher (both
unadjusted and adjusted rates) than the rate for pregnant women
in the second trimester (Table 2). Not surprising, the distribution
of total body iron among 3 trimesters in pregnant women were
well separated (Figure 1B) and indicated a complete shift in
the distribution in each trimester rather than only a shift below
the cutoff (,0 mg/kg). Pregnant women with parity 2 had the
lowest mean total body iron and the highest prevalence of ID
compared with pregnant women with parity of 0 or 1.
Non-Hispanic white pregnant women had a higher unadjusted
mean total body iron than either Mexican American pregnant
women or non-Hispanic black pregnant women. However, after
the adjustment, the mean total body iron in non-Hispanic white
pregnant women differed significantly from that in non-Hispanic
black pregnant women but not from that in Mexican American
pregnant women. The prevalence of ID in non-Hispanic white
pregnant women was significantly lower than the prevalence in
Mexican American pregnant women and in non-Hispanic black
pregnant women, even after the adjustment (Table 2). The dis-
tribution of total body iron by the 3 race-ethnic groups shown in
Figure 1C indicated that the distribution shifted to the right for
non-Hispanic white pregnant women and to the left for non-
Hispanic black pregnant women. The mean total body iron and
the prevalence of ID did not differ by educational level or family
income (Table 2).
Results of the secondary analyses conducted to assess the
effect of inflammation on study results indicated that 43.9% of the
sample had elevated CRP concentrations (.5 mg/L). Prevalences
of ID after excluding subjects with elevated CRP concentration
did not substantially differ from the results on the basis of the
full sample shown in Table 2. After excluding subjects with
elevated CRP concentration, prevalences of ID by using total
body iron were 18.6% overall and 4.7%, 13.5%, and 33.1% for
women in the first, second, and third trimesters, respectively.
In pregnant women who were ID as defined by total body iron
,0 mg/kg, 93.3% of women were ID as defined by low ferritin
concentrations (,12 lg/L) compared with only 10.0% of
women among those with total body iron 0 mg/kg. In pregnant
women who were ID as defined by total body iron ,0 mg/kg,
64.0% of women were ID as defined by high sTfR concen-
trations (.4.4 mg/L), but only 7.2% of women had sTfR
concentrations .4.4 mg/L among those with total body iron
0 mg/kg. In pregnant women who were ID as defined by total
body iron ,0 mg/kg, 16.2% of women were anemic as defined
by low hemoglobin concentrations compared with 3.1% of
women in those with total body iron 0 mg/kg.
With the use of low ferritin concentrations (,12 lg/L) to
define ID, a similar pattern and prevalence of ID was observed
by trimester and by race-ethnic group (Table 3) compared with
that on the basis of total body iron (Table 2). A similar pattern
and prevalence of ID on the basis of high sTfR concentrations
(.4.4 mg/L) by trimester and by race-ethnic group (Table 3)
were also observed compared with total body iron (Table 2).
The observed higher prevalence of an anemia pattern in
the third trimester also was similar to that of total body iron
(Table 3).
The relation between the prevalence of anemia and total body
iron is shown in Figure 2. The prevalence of anemia was '32%

in pregnant women with less than 24 mg total body iron/kg,
which decreased exponentially (logistic regression model for
trend test, P , 0.01) in pregnant women with greater concen-
trations of total-body iron stores, and flattened to ,1% in
pregnant women with total body iron .8 mg/kg.
DISCUSSION
The public health importance of monitoring ID in pregnant
women is reflected by the inclusion of an objective to monitor the
iron status of this at-risk group in Healthy People 2010 (19). In
the current article, to our knowledge, we present the first na-
tionally representative data on the estimated average total body
iron and prevalence of ID on the basis of total body iron for
pregnant women in the US, which is to reflect that some of this
data had already been reported to HP 2010 for monitoring
purposes. The monitoring of the iron status of pregnant women in
previous versions of Healthy People was restricted to anemia,
which is the last stage of ID. It is important to identify and
monitor ID during pregnancy because anemia is caused by factors
other than ID; anemia with but not without ID has been associated
with low birth weights, preterm deliveries, and perinatal mortality
(32), and in women without anemia in early pregnancy, ran-
domized controlled trials suggested iron supplements were
needed to prevent third trimester anemia and low birth weights
and/or preterm births (7, 8).
We observed that the overall prevalence of ID for US pregnant
women defined by total body iron ,0 mg/kg was 18.0 6 1.4%,
and '30% of women in the third trimester were iron deficient.
The CDC recommended universal supplementation to meet the
iron requirements of pregnancy (4). The iron intake in pregnant
women during NHANES III was observed to be less than the
estimated average requirement of 22 mg Fe/d, which led the
Institute of Medicine committee on Dietary Reference Intakes to
note the need for iron supplementation during pregnancy (6).
The prevalence of total body iron ,0 mg/kg in pregnantwomen
in the current study was double the prevalence of total body iron
,0 mg/kg that we previously reported in nonpregnant women
and 1.3­4.9 times higher than the prevalence observed in children
age 1­5 y (11). Prevalences of ID in pregnant women observed in
previous smaller studies conducted in the United States were not
directly comparable with our results because the previous studies

used other approaches to define an impaired iron status, such as
low hemoglobin or low ferritin amounts (7, 8, 13­18).
We also showed that low total body iron was more prevalent in
women in the second or third trimester, Mexican American
pregnant women, non-Hispanic black pregnant women, and
women with parity 2. However, neither the mean total body
iron nor the prevalence of ID differed significantly by educa-
tional level or family income. However, some of our results
cannot be interpreted by sociodemographic characteristics alone
without detailed information on iron intakes from diets or sup-
plements. Data from NHANES 1988­1994 indicated that, in
pregnant participants, the use of supplements that contained iron
differed by race-ethnicity but not by family income (33). This
analysis was focused on the distribution and prevalence of ID
defined by total body iron with common sociodemographic
stratification. Additional studies are needed to explore the
relations between total body iron and all of the behavior
characteristics.
Similar to studies in nonpregnant women (1, 34), pregnant
women who had parity 2 had a higher prevalence of ID than
pregnant women who had parity ,2. Differences by age were
less clear and, to our knowledge, have not been previously re-
ported in US pregnant women. Older women may have better
diets or be more likely to consume supplements before and
during pregnancy (35).
The strengths of this study included the use of a sample drawn
primarily from a supplemental sample of pregnant women from
NHANES 1999­2006, which was designed to provide more
precise estimates of the status of pregnant women in the United
States. The analytic sample used in the current study also had an
adequate sample size for a detailed analysis. Also, total body iron,
which is a new suggested indicator for better assessment of iron
status, was used for all estimates.
However, our study also had limitations. First, total body iron
has only been indirectly validated for use in pregnant women
because the phlebotomy study conducted to validate the model
did not include pregnant women (9). However, our secondary
analyses showed that the prevalence of anemia decreased ex-
ponentially (Figure 2) in pregnant women with greater con-
centrations of total-body iron stores. This suggested, as in
analyses in nonpregnant women (11), that total body iron
measured in pregnant women might be used to determine the
severity of ID. Although not all anemia is due to ID, the observed
higher prevalence of anemia pattern in the third trimester was also
similar to that of total body iron. These additional results may
provide indirect support for the validity of total body iron in
pregnant women. Second, sTfR concentrations from NHANES
had to be adjusted to be comparable with values produced by the
Flowers sTfR assay used in the development of the total-body
iron store model (4, 28), and an adjustment factor had to be
applied to make ferritin concentrations in 2003 comparable with

sTfR is soluble transferrin receptor. In calculating total body iron, we
converted the Roche sTfR concentration to be equivalent to the Flowers
assay (30) used in the calculation of the total body iron model by
applying the following conversion equation: sTfR = 1.5 · Roche sTfR +
0.35 mg/L (24). The unweighted sample size (n) is provided for each point.

those in surrounding survey years (19). Third, regression equa-
tions used to adjust sTfR and ferritin concentrations were based
on the assumption that the assays remain stable over time. Fourth,
a nonresponse bias may have been present in the estimates
presented in the current study. A nonresponse bias because of
a refusal to participate in the physical examinations in NHANES
was reduced by a nonresponse adjustment factor included in the
calculation of the sample weights for use with examinee data.
Approximately 19% of the pregnant women in the analytic
sample who were part of the supplemental sample that came to
the examination centers lacked usable ferritin and sTfR data, and
this nonresponse was not addressed by the sample-weight
adjustments. However, previous studies have not shown that
reweighting existing sample weights to account for this additional
nonresponse had much effect on estimates (36, 37). Fifth, our
results did not take inflammation and infection into account, even
though pregnancy was considered an inflammatory state. How-
ever, results from secondary analyses suggested that the potential
effect of inflammation on our results was small. Specifically,
43.9% of our sample had elevated CRP concentrations (.5 mg/L),
but the prevalence of ID after their exclusion was not substantially
different from the results on the basis of the entire analytic
sample. Finally, the lack of a standard sTfR assay method and
a standard reference material will limit the use of total body iron
in other studies.
In conclusion, to our knowledge, we present the first data on
total-body iron distributions from a representative sample of US
pregnant women. These data fill an important need for monitoring
the iron status of pregnant women, which has been identified as
a public health objective in Healthy People 2010. We showed that
ID defined by total body iron ,0 mg/kg in pregnant women was
more prevalent than we previously reported for nonpregnant
women and for children aged 1­5 y (11).
