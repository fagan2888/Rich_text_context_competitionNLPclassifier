Decline of the Oldest Old in China

Objectives. Research in China has shown that women are significantly disadvantaged in cognitive functioning in old
age. This article adds to this line of inquiry by examining gender differentials in the odds of having cognitive impairment
at baseline and during follow-up among the Chinese oldest old, as well as the potential pathways linking gender and the
likelihood of having cognitive impairment.
Methods. Using two waves (1998 and 2000) of the Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey, the researcher
estimated logistic and multinomial regression models of cognitive impairment for a nationwide sample of people aged
80­105 years old (N ¼ 8,291).
Results. Among the Chinese oldest old, women were at higher risk than men for having cognitive impairment both at
baseline and during 2-year follow-up, controlling for age, activities of daily living disability, and rural residence.
Women's disadvantages in socioeconomic status, social network, and participation in leisure activities partially accounted
for the gender differentials in cognitive impairment.
Discussion. The findings suggest that oldest old Chinese women are a vulnerable group at higher risk for cognitive
impairment than oldest old men. Closing gender disparities in formal education will significantly reduce the gender gap in
cognitive impairment in old age.
POPULATION aging historically has been characterized as
a social problem faced by developed countries. Today, it is
quickly becoming a major social issue in many developing
countries (Hayward & Zhang, 2001). For example, China, the
most populous developing country in the world, is aging at an
unprecedented speed and in an extraordinary scale due to the
rigorous family planning program in place during the past several
decades, a significant increase in life expectancy, and a
population of 1.3 billion people. In 2000, China had the
largest number of the oldest old (i.e., people aged 80 and
older) in the world, and researchers predict that the
number will climb from 13 million to more than 100 million by
2050 (Zeng, Liu, & George, 2003). Such rapid growth of the
oldest old foretells a significant future burden of cognitive and
functional disability in China and calls for more research into
the factors associated with health disadvantages in old age.
Gender is one factor that warrants a closer look in cultural
settings such as China where significant differences in gender
roles, opportunities, and obligations have conditioned the
experiences of men and women throughout the life course.
Like most women in developing countries, Chinese women
have historically lived in a patriarchal, patrilineal, and patrilocal
society in which they were structurally and systematically de-
nied education in early life, mental stimulation through high-
skilled occupations during adult life, and a large social
network--all of which are associated with cognitive develop-
ment and maintenance (National Research Council, 2000).
Thus theoretically older Chinese women may face higher risk
of cognitive impairment than older men due to their lifetime of
social and economic disadvantage.
A growing body of research on cognitive impairment and
dementia in China confirms that Chinese women are signifi-
cantly disadvantaged in cognitive functioning in old age (Gu &
Qiu, 2003; Yu et al., 1989; Zeng et al., 2003). In one of the
seminal studies of cognitive impairment in China, Yu and
colleagues found large gender disparities in the prevalence of
both severe and mild cognitive impairment among those aged
65 and older in the city of Shanghai. However, no studies have
yet explored empirically the socioeconomic and cultural factors
that could account for the significant gender differences in
cognitive impairment in China.
This study intends to fill this gap by addressing two questions:
(a) Are there gender differentials in cognitive impairment among
the Chinese oldest old? and (b) Do socioeconomic status (SES),
social network, leisure activities, and differential survival explain
the gender gap in cognitive impairment? This article expands
upon the literature in several ways. First, previous studies in
cognitive impairment have seldom used nationwide samples.
Most studies were conducted in large cities such as Shanghai and
Beijing, despite the fact that 75% of the Chinese population lives
in rural areas (Liang et al., 2000). The current study used
a recently released data set whose survey areas covered 85% of
the total population in China. Second, the present study uses
longitudinal data to examine gender differences in the onset of
cognitive impairment. The majority of previous research has only
looked at gender differentials in the prevalence of cognitive
impairment. Although prevalence is an important indicator of
the burden of cognitive impairment in the older population, it
can be influenced by incidence rates as well as the survival rates
of those with cognitive impairment. Therefore, it is not easy to
interpret these results. Third, no previous study has examined in
depth the reasons behind the significant gender differences in
cognitive impairment; most studies are largely limited to simple
bivariate analyses (e.g., Gu & Qiu, 2003; Zeng et al., 2003).

Gender Differences in Cognitive Impairment in China
Several studies report unusually large gender differences in
cognitive impairment in China. In one study in Shanghai (Yu
et al., 1989), the prevalence rate of severe cognitive impairment
among women was 3.75 times as high as that among men. Zeng
and Vaupel (2002) reported that the gender gap in cognitive
functioning among the oldest old was extremely large. Whereas
20% of men aged 90­99 had poor cognitive functioning, as
many as 37% of women in the same age group suffered from
poor cognitive functioning. Elderly women also had signifi-
cantly higher prevalence and incidence rates of dementia than
elderly men (Zhang et al., 1998; Zhang et al., 1990). During
a 3-year follow-up study of a cohort of Chinese elders aged
70 and older in Hong Kong, women had a 2.5-fold increased
risk of having cognitive impairment compared with men (Ho,
Woo, Sham, Chan, & Yu, 2001). In comparison, research in
developed countries has found no gender differences in the
incidence of cognitive decline and dementia (Chodosh, Reuben,
Albert, & Seeman, 2002; Ruitenberg, Ott, van Swieten,
Hofman, & Breteler, 2001) but higher prevalence rates of
cognitive impairment and dementia among women than among
men (Heeren, Lagaay, Hijmans, & Rooymans, 1991; Weissman
et al., 1985).
Reasons for Gender Differences in Cognitive Impairment
in China
The recent rise of feminist gerontology as well as current
knowledge about the risk factors of cognitive impairment and
dementia can lend some insight into the gender differences in
cognitive impairment in China. Feminist gerontology argues
that gender relations are ``constructed power relations embed-
ded in social processes and institutionalized in social arenas
with important consequences for life chances'' (Calasanti,
2004, p. 306). For the current oldest old Chinese, who spent
their childhood and adulthood in a patriarchal society, these
power relations privileged men and disadvantaged women with
regard to nutrition intake (e.g., sons were often favored and
given better food in the family, according to Watson [1991]),
educational and occupational opportunities, the formation of
large and diversified social networks, and participation in
leisure activities. All of the gender inequalities experienced
over the life course may put oldest old Chinese women at
higher risk for cognitive impairment compared with oldest old
men. This article examines four mechanisms potentially linking
gender and cognitive impairment in China. The first three focus
on Chinese women's disadvantages in SES, social network, and
leisure activities, which previous researchers have identified
as important predictors of cognitive impairment in old age
(Bassuk, Glass, & Berkman, 1999; National Research Council,
2000; Wang, Karp, Winblad, & Fratiglioni, 2002). The last
mechanism is differential survival rates (Perls, Morris, Ooi, &
Lipsitz, 1993).
SES. --According to the brain reserve capacity theory, ``lack
of early education could lower brain reserve and allow for
clinical symptoms of dementia to appear at an earlier date in the
disease process'' (Zhang et al., 1990, p. 436). Previous research
suggests that formal education and adult occupation provide
cognitive practice that is conducive to the development and
maintenance of cognitive abilities (National Research Council,
2000). For both historical and cultural reasons, the current
cohort of oldest old Chinese women was significantly
disadvantaged in both educational and occupational achieve-
ment compared with their male counterparts. Oldest old women
were born and raised in the semi-colonial and semi-feudal
Chinese society. Women's status was extremely low in this
patriarchal society. For centuries, women were at the bottom of
the social hierarchy: ``Except for those few who worked in the
fields, women were kept confined to their immediate living
quarters, denied an education, and not permitted to own prop-
erty or to work outside the home'' (Walstedt, 1978, p. 380). As
a result, the majority of oldest old Chinese women were
illiterate and had little exposure to non-agricultural occupations.
Lack of education and work opportunities also meant that most
of oldest old women were exposed to simple environments
(e.g., their living quarters and the fields) throughout their lives.
Schooler (1987) suggested that continued exposure to a simple
environment may have a negative effect on cognitive func-
tioning due to a lack of diverse stimuli. Thus, Chinese elderly
women's low SES may play a significant role in the gender gap
in cognitive impairment.
Social network. --In general, oldest old Chinese women have
smaller social networks compared with their male counterparts
for at least three reasons. First, due to women's longer
longevity, oldest old women are more likely than oldest old
men to be widowed. Whereas men were expected to remarry
after the loss of a spouse, women were often expected to remain
chaste and unmarried (Walstedt, 1978). Second, marriage has
historically been patrilocal. Due to the taboos against same-
village marriages, women often left their village upon marriage,
entered their husbands' families and communities as strangers,
and had few opportunities to visit their own family, relatives,
and friends. Therefore, women's social ties with their own
family and friends were often weakened substantially after
marriage whereas men's social network remained stable
(Watson, 1991). Third, many oldest old Chinese women have
spent their whole lives staying at home and taking care of their
husbands and children; their social network might be relatively
smaller than that of older men who worked outside the home
and had coworkers and friends. Recent research has shown that
structural features of social network (i.e., size and frequency of
contact) influence cognitive health in later life (Ho et al., 2001;
Zunzunegui, Alvarado, Del Ser, & Otero, 2003). The ``use it or
lose it'' hypothesis suggests that mental stimulation can protect
against cognitive decline. Because all social interactions require
mobilization of cognitive faculties, people with larger social
networks have more opportunities to use their cognitive
functions and thus are less likely to lose them (Bassuk et al.,
1999). Holtzman and colleagues (2004) found that more
frequent contact in larger social networks was associated with
less cognitive decline 12 years later. In another study, Swedish
researchers reported that an extensive social network protected
against dementia (Fratiglioni, Wang, Ericsson, Maytan, &
Winblad, 2000).
Leisure activities. --Oldest old Chinese women are also less
likely than their male counterparts to participate in leisure activ-
ities such as reading, writing, and playing cards or mah-jong
ZHANG
S108
due partly to their lack of education (Zeng et al., 2003)
and partly to the centuries-old idea that women should be at
home serving their husbands and taking care of children rather
than pursuing their own hobbies. Recent literature shows that
different leisure activities--including social, physical, and
intellectual activities--requires the use of different cognitive
components such as memory, planning, and time and space
orientation and thus could protect against cognitive decline in
old age (Wang et al., 2002). Moreover, engaging in leisure
activities entailing high cognitive effort (such as playing games
or cards and reading books or newspapers) was more strongly
associated with having cognitive ability than engaging in
activities low in cognitive effort (such as gardening and
performing household tasks; Singh-Manoux, Richards, &
Marmot, 2003).
Differential survival rates. --The higher prevalence of
cognitive impairment among oldest old Chinese women com-
pared with men may be caused in part by differential mortality
selection (Perls et al., 1993; Zhang et al., 1990). For example,
Perl and colleagues found that while mortality rates for men and
women with normal cognitive function were similar, demented
women in two age groups (80­89 years old and 90­99 years
old) were more likely than demented men to survive. Pre-
liminary research in Shanghai also suggests that mortality rates
for demented men may be slightly higher than for demented
women. Nonetheless, the gender gap in the prevalence of
cognitive impairment in China is so great that differential
mortality is unlikely to be the major factor (Zhang et al., 1990).
Based on previous research, this article hypothesizes that
among the Chinese oldest old (a) women are at higher risk than
men for cognitive impairment, and (b) women's disadvantages
in SES, social network, and leisure activities largely account for
their higher risk of cognitive impairment compared with men.
METHODS
Data
Using two waves (1998 and 2000) of the Chinese
Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey (CLHLS), I examined
gender differentials in the risk of cognitive impairment among
the Chinese oldest old. The CLHLS was conducted in a
randomly selected one half of the counties and cities of China's
22 provinces. The survey area covered 85% of the Chinese
population. The target respondents were aged 80 and older in
1998; they were interviewed again in 2000. In the baseline
survey, 8,959 respondents aged 80 and older were interviewed;
in the second wave, 4,744 surviving respondents (53%)
completed the interview. The richness of information collected
on cognitive functioning, SES, social network, and lifestyles
makes the CLHLS particularly suitable for research on gender
disparities in cognitive impairment among the Chinese
oldest old.
The present study focuses on 8,805 respondents aged 80­105
years old in 1998 (see Figure 1). I excluded those who reported
being aged 106 or older due to insufficient information to
validate their old age (Zeng & Vaupel, 2002). The analytic
sample for the odds of having cognitive impairment at baseline
was restricted to 8,291 respondents, which reflects the
elimination of 39 persons with missing data on key independent
variables and 475 respondents who did not participate in the
cognitive test due to hearing or vision impairments, sickness,
refusal to participate, or other unspecified reasons. The analytic

sample for the onset of cognitive impairment from 1998 to
2000 was restricted to 6,453 respondents whose cognition was
considered normal in 1998 based on their scores in the
cognitive test. Of these respondents, 774 (12%) experienced the
onset of cognitive impairment during the two-year interval,
1,877 (29%) died, and 709 (11%) were lost to follow-up or
could not take the cognitive test due to various reasons.
Measures
Dependent variables. --I measured the cognitive functioning
of the Chinese oldest old by using the Chinese version of Mini-
Mental State Examination (MMSE), which tests four aspects
of cognitive functioning: orientation, calculation, recall, and
language (Folstein, Folstein, & McHugh, 1975). The Chinese
version of the MMSE (see Appendix) was culturally translated
from the international standard of the MMSE questionnaire and
was carefully tested in pilot survey interviews. On the whole,
most items could be translated without modification. However,
some items were changed in order to adapt to the cultural and
socioeconomic conditions of the Chinese oldest old so that all
questions would be easily understandable and answerable if the
respondent had normal cognitive functioning. For example, the
Chinese MMSE asks respondents to name as many foods as
possible instead of writing a sentence (which is an impossible
task to ask of this group of the oldest old, the majority of whom
are illiterate). In calculation, the question was simplified
(Zeng & Vaupel, 2002). Consistent with previous studies, the
number of ``unable to answer'' answers was much higher for
the relatively difficult tasks compared with the relatively easy
tasks. As has been recommended in the literature, I counted
responses of ``unable to answer'' as incorrect answers (Herzog
& Wallace, 1997). The range of scores for the MMSE is 0 to
30, with lower scores indicating poor cognitive ability. For the
current sample, the reliability of the MMSE scale was high
(Cronbach's a¼.94), and the weighted mean score was about 25.
Because there are no established guidelines for determining
cognitive impairment in the Chinese oldest old, I followed the
criteria set by the international standard and by previous stud-
ies conducted in China. Respondents were defined as having
``moderate-severe cognitive impairment'' (hereafter ``cognitive
impairment'') if their score of MMSE was less than 18 (Gu &
Qiu, 2003; Nguyen, Black, Ray, Espino, & Markides, 2003; Yu
et al., 1989). The choice of using a very low cut-off point such
as 18 reduced MMSE measurement error because those in-
dividuals who scored less than 18 had a very high probability
of being cognitively impaired, regardless of education (Folstein
et al., 1975; Zhang et al., 1990). Although significant im-
provements have been made on the cognitive screening
instrument for illiterate and low education populations, it is
unrealistic to expect the full elimination of the influence of
education on screening tests (Teng et al., 1994). For example,
respondents with no formal education were usually less familiar
with the test procedures and more nervous during the testing
than those who had some formal education (Zhang et al., 1998;
Zhang et al., 1990). Given that the overwhelming majority of
oldest old Chinese women are illiterate and that oldest old
Chinese men have very limited education, it is appropriate to
use a very low cut-off point to measure cognitive impairment.
The odds of having cognitive impairment were based on the
individual's MMSE score in 1998. Scores lower than 18 were
coded as 1, indicating the presence of cognitive impairment;
scores equal to or higher than 18 were coded as 0, indicating
no cognitive impairment. The onset of cognitive impairment
within the approximately 2-year interval (1998­2000) was
based on whether MMSE scores for respondents whose
cognition was considered normal at baseline fell below 18 at
follow up. The dependent variable in the longitudinal model
has four outcomes: cognitively impaired, death, loss to follow
up, and cognitively normal (the reference category).
Independent variables. --In this study, gender (female ¼ 1)
was the focal independent variable. I examined three blocks of
variables that might mediate gender differentials in cognitive
impairment and measured each at baseline. The first block
was SES. Two indicators were created to reflect a respondent's
overall SES: education and primary lifetime occupation.
Because educational attainment of the Chinese oldest old is
extremely low, years of schooling were grouped into two
categories: 0 years (no formal education ¼ 1) and one or more
years. Primary lifetime occupation was measured as a dummy
variable including non-agriculture and agriculture/housework
(the reference category). Previous research in China has found
that people working in the fields as well as those without paid
jobs are at higher risk for cognitive impairment in late life than
those working in a non-agriculture sector (Gu & Qiu, 2003). The
second block was social network, which included marital status
(single ¼ 1), the number of children who frequently visited (0­
5), and whether the respondent had frequent sibling visits. The
third block was participation in leisure activities, including
exercising, garden work/growing vegetables, reading news-
papers or books, playing cards or mah-jong, watching TV or
listening to the radio. All were measured as dummy variables.
The control variables included age, activity of daily living
(ADL) disability, and place of residence (rural ¼ 1). Advancing
age is associated with cognitive impairment (e.g., Zeng et al.,
2003; Zunzunegui et al., 2003). ADL disability has been linked
with higher prevalence rates of cognitive impairment (Gu &
Qiu, 2003; Yu et al., 1989) and higher incidence rates of
cognitive decline (Black & Rush, 2002), although the specific
mechanisms remain unclear. I indexed ADL disability by
counting the number of ADLs that a respondent could not
perform independently. (The six ADLs items were bathing,
dressing, eating, indoor transferring, toileting, and continence.)
The summated scale ranges from 0 to 6 (Cronbach's a ¼ .86).
In China, there are large disparities in standards of living
between rural and urban areas. Compared with their urban
counterparts, rural residents are disadvantaged in many aspects,
including quality of education, access to good jobs, health care,
and geographic mobility (Liang et al., 2000). Previous research
on China has found that the urban oldest old have better
cognitive functioning compared with rural residents (Zeng &
Vaupel, 2002).
Analytic Strategy
I first examined the characteristics of the Chinese oldest old
by gender (this article reports means for continuous variables
and percentages for categorical variables). Then a series of
nested logistic regression models were estimated to test the
ZHANG
S110
gender differentials in the odds of cognitive impairment among
the Chinese oldest old. The first model estimated the total effect
of gender, controlling for age, ADL disability, and place of
residence. The second model incorporated socioeconomic
factors achieved earlier in life, which are most exogenous to
cognitive impairment in advanced age. Then social network
and leisure activities were entered sequentially to assess the
changes in the main effects of gender on cognitive impair-
ment. Reductions in the main effects after the introduction
of these variables would point to the importance of SES, social
network, and leisure activities as mechanisms that contribute
to gender differentials in cognitive impairment.
I used multinomial logistic regression to examine the onset of
cognitive impairment. The total effect of gender was estimated
first, controlling for age, ADL disability, and rural residence;
then SES, social network, and leisure activities were entered
sequentially to assess whether the main effects of gender on the
incidence of cognitive impairment were reduced. Unless other-
wise noted, this article presents results based on unweighted
data. As the sampling weights in the data set are solely a
function of the major independent variables used in the analysis
(i.e., age, gender, and rural residence), the unweighted
estimates are preferable because they are unbiased, consistent,
and have smaller standard errors than weighted estimates
(Winship & Radbill, 1994).
RESULTS
The descriptive profiles in Table 1 demonstrate substantial
differences in the characteristics of oldest old men and women
in China. As expected, oldest old women were older, less
educated, and less likely to work in a non-agricultural sector
than oldest old men. As high as 81% of oldest old women had
received no formal education, compared with 33% of oldest old
men. Only 18% of oldest old women had ever held a job in
a non-agricultural sector compared with 45% of their male
counterparts. Compared with oldest old men, oldest old women
were more likely to be single, less likely to have frequent visits
by siblings, and had fewer children who visited frequently. In
addition, oldest old women were less likely than oldest old men
to participate in all five leisure activities. The prevalence of
cognitive impairment for oldest old women was 2.2 times as
high as that for oldest old men.
Table 2 shows the results of logistic regression models,
which examined the roles that SES, social network, and leisure
activities play in gender disparities in the odds of cognitive
impairment at baseline, net of age, ADL disability, and rural
residence. According to Model 1, the odds of having cognitive
impairment were 2.2 for oldest old women in relation to oldest
old men, controlling for age, rural residence, and ADL dis-
ability. As expected, adding SES in Model 2 significantly
reduced the gender effect on cognitive impairment. Model 3
incorporated social network. The gender effect was reduced
slightly but remained statistically significant. Model 4 incor-
porated leisure activities, and the gender effect was further
reduced but remained statistically significant. The odds of being
cognitively impaired were 1.3 for oldest old women in relation
to their male counterparts, controlling for all the covariates.
Consistent with previous findings about correlates of
cognitive impairment, results in Model 4 show that age and
ADL disability were positively associated with cognitive im-
pairment. Rural residents had slightly higher odds of cognitive
impairments than their urban counterparts ( p , .1). Respond-
ents with no formal education were at higher risk for cognitive
impairment than respondents with some education; respondents
who had worked in a non-agricultural sector had less risk of
cognitive impairment than those who had worked in the
agricultural sector or had no paying job. Being single was
associated with higher odds of cognitive impairment, whereas
having children who frequently visited was associated with

lower odds. The effect of sibling visits was in the expected
direction but was not statistically significant. Consistent with
previous research, each leisure activity was associated with
having lower odds of cognitive impairment.
Next, I estimated multinomial logistic regression models to
examine (a) whether there were gender differences in the onset
of cognitive impairment among the oldest old whose cognition
was normal at baseline, and (b) what factors contributed to
gender differences in the risk of cognitive impairment. Table 3
summarizes the results from the series of nested models. Model
1 shows that gender had a significant effect on the risk of
cognitive impairment, controlling for age, ADL disability, and
rural residence. Oldest old women were 66% more likely than
oldest old men to experience the onset of cognitive impairment.
Age, ADL disability, and rural residence significantly increased
the risk of cognitive impairment. Adding SES to Model 1
substantially reduced the gender effect, although it remained
strong and statistically significant. Model 2 suggests that the
gender effect was partially mediated by gender differences in
education and primary lifetime occupation, both of which are
risk factors of cognitive impairment. Model 3 incorporated the
social network variables. The gender effect was further reduced
but remained statistically significant. Model 3 shows that
having children who frequently visit significantly reduced the
risk of cognitive impairment. However, sibling visits and
marital status did not have the same protective effects against
cognitive impairment. In Model 4, the gender effect was
reduced slightly and became statistically nonsignificant after
the introduction of the five leisure activities. Consistent with
previous studies in China and other countries, the present study
found that people who did garden work or grew vegetables,
played cards or mah-jong, or watched TV or listened to the
radio ( p , .1) were less likely than those who did not par-
ticipate in these activities to experience the onset of cogni-
tive impairment.
The sixth column of Table 3 shows the risk of death relative
to being cognitively normal from 1998 to 2000. Strong gen-
der differences in mortality existed among those who were
cognitively normal at baseline: Oldest old women were sig-
nificantly less likely (odds ratio ¼ 0.57) than their male
counterparts to die, controlling for all the covariates. Age and
ADL disability significantly increased the risk of death. On the
other hand, being married, having children who frequently visit,
exercising, gardening, and watching TV or listening to the radio
significantly reduced the risk of death.
The last column of Table 3 shows the risk of loss to follow
up relative to being cognitively normal. Those who lived in
rural areas, did garden work or grew vegetables, or had siblings
or children who frequently visited were less likely than those
who did not participate in these activities to drop out of the
study. Those who had ADL disability or could read newspapers
or books were more likely to drop out. These findings are
consistent with previous studies in China and Japan that showed
that people with higher SES were more likely than people with
lower SES to drop out of research studies, partly due to greater
mobility among those with higher SES (Gu, 2005).
Finally, I performed an indirect test to examine whether the
gender differential in the prevalence of cognitive impairment
was partly due to the differential mortality selection among men
and women with cognitive impairment. Table 4 shows the
results of the logistic regression model that regresses the log
odds of death between 1998 and 2000 on age, rural residence,
cognitive impairment at baseline, being female, and the in-
teraction terms of female and cognitive impairment at baseline.
Consistent with previous findings, oldest old women with
cognitive impairment were significantly less likely than their

0.79 ¼ 0.59) as high for oldest old women with cognitive
impairment as for their male counterparts, net of age and
rural residence.
Using models not shown here, I tested whether the effects of
SES, social network, and leisure activities on the risk of
cognitive impairment differed for women and men at baseline
and during follow-up. Results suggested few statistically sig-
nificant gender interaction effects, with one exception. Having
an occupation in a non-agricultural sector lowered women's
odds of having cognitive impairment at baseline more than they
did men's.
DISCUSSION
Gender may be an important risk factor of cognitive im-
pairment in developing countries such as China, where older
women have been oppressed in a patriarchal and patrilineal
society from early childhood to adulthood. Previous research in
large Chinese cities such as Shanghai and Beijing report
substantial gender inequalities in the prevalence of cogni-
tive impairment.
This article added to this research by examining the gender
effect in the likelihood of cognitive impairment in the oldest
old. It is the first article that uses nationwide longitudinal data
to study gender differentials in cognitive impairment in a
developing country as well as specific mechanisms leading to
those differentials. Results showed that gender has a significant
effect on the risk of cognitive impairment in the Chinese oldest
old, controlling for age, ADL disability, and rural residence.
Adding SES substantially reduces the gender differentials in the
risk of cognitive impairment, suggesting that the low SES status
of Chinese oldest old women contributes to their poor cognitive
functioning in old age. As for the explanatory powers of the
three blocks of variables (SES, social network, and leisure
activities), SES appears to be the most powerful, accounting for
42% of the gender differentials. Social network and participa-
tion in leisure activities together explain about 24% of the
gender differentials, net of SES. However, the remaining 34%
of the gender differentials cannot be explained in the full
model. Previous research as well as the indirect test of
differential survival rates of oldest old men and women with
cognitive impairment suggest that the survival advantages of
oldest old women with cognitive impairment compared with
their male counterparts might play a role in the remaining
gender gap in the prevalence of cognitive impairment.
The results from the multinomial logistic regression models
show that SES is also the most powerful mediating variable.
The SES block explains about 39% of the gender effect in the
onset of cognitive impairment. Social network and participation
in leisure activities also play important roles. Together they
explain about 24% of the gender effect, net of SES.
A caveat in interpreting these results is that the life
experiences of the current cohort of Chinese oldest old are
vastly different from those of future cohorts of older adults. The
cohorts in this study experienced much political and social
unrest in 20th century China: the Revolution of 1911 that
overthrew the Qing Dynasty, the 10-year civil war between the
Communist Party and Kuomingtang, the 8-year war against the
Japanese invasion in the mid-1930s, the subsequent civil war
that led to the founding of the People's Republic of China in
1949, the terrible famine in 1959­1960, and the 10-year Cultural
Revolution (1966­1976) that led to nationwide turmoil and
political persecution. In other words, the current cohort of the
oldest old are lucky survivors of wars, famines, and political
persecution. The exceptionally good health of the Chinese oldest
old, men in particular, may also reflect this selection effect.
Because each new cohort is exposed to distinct experiences that
may affect their cognitive functioning in their twilight years,
monitoring the gendered health pattern of the future cohorts of
older people is crucial in helping researchers understand the
roles that aging, cohorts, and time periods play in cognitive
impairment (Alwin, McCammon, Rodgers, & Wray, 2004).
The present study has several strengths, including the use of
longitudinal data, the use of a large nationwide sample of the
oldest old, and the exploration of mediating roles of SES, social
network, and leisure activities in the gender differentials in
cognitive impairment. However, researchers should consider
several limitations when interpreting the results. First, a brief
epidemiological screening instrument for dementia rather than
a comprehensive clinical evaluation was used to detect
moderate-severe cognitive impairment. Obviously, clinical eval-
uations are more accurate; however, due to budget limitations,
the CLHLS did not conduct clinical tests. Nevertheless, the
effects of the major independent variables on cognitive im-
pairment in the study are consistent with previous studies that
used clinical tests to detect cognitive impairment. Second,
although the CLHLS included self-reports of major diseases--
some of which are risk factors for cognitive impairment--this
information was not included in the present analysis because
the data were inaccurate. Most Chinese oldest old, particularly
those in rural areas, do not have medical records and access to
clinical diagnosis due to poor medical facilities.
In spite of these limitations, this article extends researchers'
understanding of the excess gender differentials of cognitive
impairment among Chinese oldest old. Although oldest old
women have significantly lower mortality rates than oldest old
men, they are at much higher risk for cognitive impairment due
to their lifetime disadvantages in SES, social network, and
leisure activities. Chinese oldest old women are a vulnerable
group that needs much help. These findings also suggest that
women in other developing countries may face the same
problems as Chinese women as life expectancy continues to
improve. This is because women in most developing countries
are less educated, have fewer opportunities to develop their
cognitive skills over their life course, and hold a lower social
and economic status than men.

GENDER, COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT, AND DECLINE S113
In less than 50 years, China's oldest old population is
projected to reach 100 million. Most of the future cohorts of
older people will have only 1 or 2 children due to the one-child
policy. It will be increasingly difficult for elderly parents to rely
totally on adult children to take care of them. The increasing
rate of cognitive impairment among women and other
economically disadvantaged groups poses significant problems
not only for the individuals and families but for Chinese society
as a whole. Future research should focus on whether mod-
ifications of some predictors of cognitive decline in later life--
such as life-long learning, volunteer work, participation in
social and leisure activities either at home or in community
centers for elders, and strengthening intergenerational ties--
could delay the onset of cognitive impairment. Ultimately, this
article suggests that investment in girls' education will have
long-term payoffs, even to the oldest old age, and closing
gender disparities in formal education will significantly reduce
the gender gap in cognitive impairment in old age.
