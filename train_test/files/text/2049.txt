Abstract
Background: several studies examining diet and functional status of individuals have focused on single nutrients or food
groups. Studies examining the relationship between diet and health have increasingly witnessed a shift in focus from single
nutrients to overall diet quality. The objective of this study was to examine the association between overall diet quality and
self-reported disability.
Setting: the 1999­2004 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES).
Subjects: a nationally representative sample of Americans 60 years.
Methods: overall diet quality was assessed using the United States Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Healthy Eating
Index-2005 (HEI-2005). Self-reported measures of disability included activities of daily living (ADLs), instrumental activities
of daily living (IADLs), leisure and social activities (LSAs), lower extremity mobility (LEM) and general physical activities
(GPAs).
Results: older adults with higher HEI-2005 scores were less likely to experience LEM (P for trend = 0.001) and GPAs
(P for trend < 0.001) disability. Compared with older adults whose HEI-2005 scores were in the lowest quartile, the likelihood
of both IADLs and GPAs disability were significantly lower in those with HEI-2005 scores in quartiles two, three and four.
Compared with those who had HEI-2005 scores in the lowest quartile, the odds of LEM disability were significantly lower for
those with HEI-2005 scores in the highest quartile.
Conclusion: older adults who do not adhere to the 2005 Dietary Guidelines for Americans report disability more frequently than
those who do adhere to the guidelines.

Diet quality and disability
Introduction
According to the Surgeon General's Call to Action in 2005,
54 million people living in the USA have some disability
[1]. Diet is an important modifiable factor contributing to
functional disability, particularly in older adults [2, 3].
Several studies examining the relationship between diet and
functional status of individuals have focused on single
nutrients or food groups [3­7]. Because people consume a
combination of foods, it is difficult to attribute the effects
of a single nutrient to health outcomes [8]. Thus, studies
examining the relationship between diet and health have in-
creasingly witnessed a shift in focus from single nutrients
to overall diet quality. Dietary indexes, based on recommen-
dations from various organisations, have been constructed
to aid in identifying diet quality, patterns and variety [9].
The Healthy Eating Index-2005 (HEI-2005), developed
by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), is
a reliable measure of overall diet quality that assesses adher-
ence to the 2005 Dietary Guidelines for Americans (DGA)
[10]. HEI-2005 emphasises dietary recommendations that
are not currently being met in the USA. This dietary index
differs from an earlier version, HEI-1995, because it incor-
porates an assessment of foods and nutrients on a density
basis (amounts per 1,000 calories) [10]. It also includes new
food groups: whole fruit, dark green and orange vegetables
and legumes, whole grains and oils. Lastly, it incorporates a
discretionary component, the calories from solid fat,
alcohol and added sugar (SoFAAS). The HEI-2005 and its
earlier version (HEI-1995) have been widely used in epi-
demiological studies [11]. One previous study reported that
the HEI-1995 was associated with mobility limitations
among older adults (70­79 years) [12]. However, other dis-
ability domains were not examined in this study.
To our knowledge, no other studies have examined the
association between overall diet quality, as measured by
HEI-2005 scores, and self-reported disability assessed by
multiple domains. Therefore, the purpose of this study was
to examine the association between HEI-2005 scores and
self-reported disability in a nationally representative sample
of older adults.
Methods
Study design and participants
Data were from the 1999­2004 National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), conducted by
the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). The
NHANES surveys are multistage, stratified area probability
samples. Data were obtained from a sample of non-
institutionalised civilians during both a detailed in-person
home interview and a health examination [13].
Of 4,984 participants 60 years, 640 participants were
excluded because of missing covariates (age, gender, race/
ethnicity, education, smoking status, marital status, availabil-
ity of emotional support, availability of financial support,
household size and number of close friends) and 234 parti-
cipants were excluded because of missing dietary informa-
tion. After excluding missing data for activities of daily
living (ADLs; n = 4), instrumental activities of daily living
(IADLs; n = 158), leisure and social activities (LSAs; n = 69),
lower extremity mobility (LEM; n = 552) and general phys-
ical activities (GPAs; n = 514), the final sample size was
4,106 for ADLs, 3,952 for IADLs, 4,041 for LSAs, 3,558
for LEM and 3,596 for GPAs. This study was approved as
exempt by the Institutional Review Board of Auburn
University.
Dietary assessment
One 24-h dietary recall that employed the USDA
Automated-Multiple Pass Method (AMPM) was used to
collect the dietary data. The AMPM included multiple
passes through the 24 h of the previous day. During the
AMPM interview, participants received cues to help them
remember and describe foods and the amounts of foods
they consumed [14].
The HEI-2005, a composite score assessing an indivi-
dual's adherence to the 2005 DGA, was used to measure
overall diet quality [10]. The HEI-2005 is comprised of 12
nutrient- and food-based components. The first six compo-
nents, including total fruit, whole fruit, total vegetables,
dark green and orange vegetables and legumes, total grains
and whole grains, are each given a score of 0­5 points. The
next five components including milk, meat and beans, oils,
saturated fat and sugar are each given 0­10 points. The last
component that reflects calories from solid fat, alcohol and
added sugars (SoFAAS) is given 0­20 points. The sum of
the scores for the 12 components is the total HEI-2005
score, which ranges from 0 to 100, with a higher score indi-
cative of a more healthful diet. Information about the
HEI-2005 and its scoring system is reviewed elsewhere
[10].
For the purpose of this analysis, HEI-2005 scores were
categorised into quartiles to express the diet quality: the
first quartile represents the lowest quality and the fourth
quartile represents the highest quality. The lowest quartile
of HEI-2005 scores was chosen as the reference group.
Each of the HEI-2005 component scores was analysed as
an indicator variable (individuals who met their dietary
recommendations vs. all others).
Disability
Nineteen validated questions were used to assess five
domains of disability: ADLs, IADLs, LSAs, LEM and
GPAs [13, 15]. Each question assessed the difficulty an in-
dividual had in performing a task without the aid of any
equipment. For each item, participants were allowed to
select from among four levels of difficulty: `no difficulty',
`some difficulty', `much difficulty' and `unable to do'. The
items examined included locomotion and transfers, house-
hold productivity, social integration, and manipulation of
366

surroundings. Four activities were classified as ADLs: dress-
ing oneself; walking between rooms on the same floor;
getting in and out of bed; and using a fork, knife and
drinking from a cup. Three activities were used to classify
IADLs: managing money; doing household chores; and
preparing meals. LSAs also consisted of three activities:
going out to movies and events; attending social events;
and performing leisure activities at home. LEM consisted
of two activities: walking a quarter mile and walking up 10
steps. GPAs consisted of seven activities: stooping, crouch-
ing, kneeling; lifting or carrying; standing up from an
armless chair; standing for long periods; sitting for long
periods; reaching up over head; and grasping/holding small
objects. Disability was defined as any difficulty in perform-
ing one or more of the activities within a given domain.
Data analyses
All descriptive and inferential statistics were estimated using
STATA (version 10, 2007, Stata Corp, College Station, TX,
USA) to account for sample design and sampling weights.
Six-year examination sample weights were derived using an
approach described in the NHANES analytic guidelines to
account for the unequal probabilities of selection, person-
level non-response and a post-stratification adjustment to
the estimated US population [13].
Associations between quartiles of HEI-2005 scores and
covariates (descriptive characteristics) were tested with 2
tests for categorical variables and linear regression analysis
for continuous variables. Multiple logistic regression models
were used to estimate the associations between quartiles of
HEI-2005 scores and self-reported disability. Tests for
linear trends across quartiles of HEI-2005 were conducted
using the median value in each HEI-2005 category as a
continuous variable in the logistic regression models. The
relationships between each of the 12 individual HEI-2005
components and self-reported disability were also examined
using multiple logistic regression models. Age, gender,
race/ethnicity, education, smoking status, marital status,
availability of emotional support, availability of financial
support, household size and number of close friends were
controlled for in all logistic regression models. For this ana-
lysis, age was considered to be a continuous variable. Three
race/ethnicity categories were examined: non-Hispanic
white, non-Hispanic black and Hispanic. Level of education
was defined as < a high school degree or a high school
degree. Smoking status was determined by the self-reported
use of cigarettes, cigars or pipes, and participants were clas-
sified as never, former or current smokers. Married
included those who reported being married or living with
their partner. Single included those who were widowed,
separated or never married. Availability of emotional
support was assessed by the presence of someone to talk
over problems or to help make a difficult decision.
Availability of financial support was assessed by the pres-
ence of someone to help pay bills, housing costs, hospital
visits, or provide food or clothes. Household size was
dichotomised at 2 people living in a household. The
number of close friends was dichotomised at the median
value 5 of the target population. Statistical significance was
assigned at P < 0.05 (two-sided).
Results
Descriptive characteristics of the analytic sample for ADLs
by quartiles of HEI-2005 scores are presented in Table 1.
More than one-half of the participants were non-Hispanic
white, female and married but living alone, and had an edu-
cation  high school, emotional and financial support, 5
close friends and GPAs disability.
Table 2 shows the results for the associations between
total HEI-2005 scores and self-reported disability by quar-
tiles of HEI-2005 scores. After adjusting for covariates,
HEI-2005 scores were not statistically associated with
ADLs and LSAs disability. Older adults with higher
HEI-2005 scores were less likely to experience LEM (P for
trend = 0.001) and GPAs (P for trend < 0.001) disability.
Compared with older adults whose HEI-2005 scores were
in the lowest quartile, the likelihood of both IADLs and
GPAs disability were significantly lower in those with
HEI-2005 scores in quartiles two, three and four.
Compared with those who had HEI-2005 scores in the
lowest quartile, the odds of LEM disability were significant-
ly lower for those with HEI-2005 scores in the highest
quartile.
Table 3 shows the results for the associations between
individual HEI-2005 component scores and self-reported
disability by quartiles of HEI-2005 scores. Some of the in-
dividual HEI-2005 component scores were statistically asso-
ciated with self-reported disability. The odds of IADLs,
LEM and GPAs disability were significantly lower for indi-
viduals who met the recommendations for HEI-2005 total
fruit and whole fruit scores compared with those who did
not meet those recommendations. The likelihood of IADLs
disability was significantly lower for older adults who met
the recommendations for HEI-2005 dark green and orange
vegetables and legumes scores. The likelihood of LEM and
GPAs disability was significantly lower for those who met
the HEI-2005 SoFAAS recommendations than for those
individuals who did not.
Discussion
This study is among the first to document an inverse asso-
ciation between overall diet quality, measured by HEI-2005
scores, and self-reported disability among a nationally rep-
resentative sample of older Americans. Our findings are
consistent with a longitudinal study that reported that older
adults with lower HEI-1995 scores had a higher risk for in-
cident mobility limitations (equivalent to LEM in the
current study), defined as a reported difficulty with walking
a quarter mile or climbing 10 steps [12].

Two other studies examined the association between the
consumption of food groups and functional status [4, 5]. In
the Study of Women's Health Across the Nation (SWAN),
middle-aged women with lower fruit and vegetable intakes
were more likely to report subsequent functional limitations
as assessed 4 years later using the Medical Outcomes Study
Short-Form 36 [5]. In the Atherosclerosis Risk in
Communities (ARIC) Study, researchers reported that lower
fruit and vegetable consumption was associated with
poorer lower extremity function, ADLs and IADLs among
middle-aged and older black and white participants [4].
Likewise, we found that meeting the HEI-2005 recommen-
dations for total fruit and whole fruit consumption was
associated with a lower likelihood of reporting disability in
IADLs, LEM and GPAs. Also, meeting the HEI-2005
recommendations for consumption of dark green and
orange vegetables and legumes was associated with a lower
likelihood of IADLs disability.
The protective effects of consuming fruit may be
explained by the antioxidants found in these foods [16, 17].
Antioxidants, including the carotenoids, vitamin C, vitamin
E and other polyphenols, may prevent free radical damage
that contributes to inflammation associated with chronic
diseases and subsequent functional decline [6, 18]. Both
cross-sectional and longitudinal studies have reported low
serum or plasma carotenoid concentrations were associated
with poor physical performance including gait speed and
muscle strength [19­22]. Consumption of fruits and vegeta-
bles, the most important natural sources of antioxidants,
may be important dietary components that function to
minimise functional limitations. One longitudinal study also
reported that women with higher dietary cholesterol, total
fat and saturated fat intakes reported more functional lim-
itations than those who did not [5]. Similarly, we found that
individuals who did not meet the HEI-2005 recommenda-
tions for SoFAAS had a higher likelihood of LEM and
GPAs disability.
It is important to note that the cross-sectional design did
not allow us to study the causal relationship between
HEI-2005 and disability. Further, the NHANES data does
not include institutionalised individuals who probably have a
higher prevalence of disability than community-dwelling
older adults. Therefore, the lack of significant associations
found between HEI-2005 scores and self-reported disability
for ADLs and LSAs may be due to these measures not
being sensitive enough to discriminate among high function-
ing community-dwelling individuals [23]. Additionally, the
HEI-2005 scores in this study were based on a single
24-hour dietary recall instrument, which may be subject to
under- or over-reporting, depending on the population [24].
The AMPM method has been shown to underestimate
energy intakes by 11% in a population of normal, overweight
and obese persons [14]. Finally the NHANES data set does
not include other variables, such as depression, that may
play a role in the relationship between diet and disability.
This study also has a number of strengths. Functional
status was evaluated using self-reported measures that
encompassed five different domains covering physical,
social and psychological contexts. In addition, the
NHANES data were rigorously collected and allow us to
examine a nationally representative sample population.
Further, diet quality was measured using HEI-2005 scores
that reliably simultaneously capture DGA recommendations
[10]. The HEI-2005 incorporates several recommendations
which allow us to address the complexity of diet beha-
viours. Using HEI-2005 scores to measure diet quality is
also useful for comparisons across different study popula-
tions. Studies using data-driven analyses to examine dietary

Diet quality and disability
behaviours within a population may not be replicated in
other populations [25]. Additionally several factors, such as
social support, that may affect the relationship between diet
and disability were accounted for in our study. Finally, the
component scores used to calculate the total HEI score
offer an opportunity to study important components of
dietary intake and their relationships to disability.
Conclusion
The results demonstrate that adherence to the 2005 DGA
was associated with lower disability in physical, social and psy-
chological domains among older adults. This study will help
others to shape more effective policy interventions to
promote healthy diets and prevent functional decline in older
adults. The 2005 DGA are the most authoritative dietary
recommendations provided to the US population.
Understanding the health benefits of following the guidelines
is essential for setting up effective behavioural interventions.
Public health goals related to reducing healthcare costs and
enhancing the quality of life in the older adult population are
dependent on ensuring proper nutritional status and main-
taining functional abilities. The development of targeted inter-
ventions for reaching these goals will only be met through
improving our understanding of the complex factors influen-
cing the relationship of nutrition and functional status.
Key points
· Adherence to the 2005 DGA was associated with a lower
likelihood of disability.
· Meeting the HEI-2005 component recommendations for
fruits, vegetables and SoFAAS was associated with lower
disability.
· The HEI-2005 score encompasses important dietary
characteristics and may be a useful tool to predict func-
tional abilities.

Abstract
Background: there are limited population-based data on urinary symptoms and the natural history of urinary incontinence
after a first stroke.
Aim: to study the prevalence of urinary symptoms, and the natural history and factors associated with urinary incontinence
after first-ever stroke.
Methods: we administered a standardised urinary symptom questionnaire at 3 and 12 months after stroke to patients en-
rolled in the North-East Melbourne Stroke Incidence Study. Urinary symptoms and evolution of urinary incontinence were
recorded. Logistic regression was used to model associations between baseline factors and incontinence at 12 months.
Results: more than 80% of survivors reported one or more abnormal urinary symptoms at 3 or 12 months, with nocturia
most frequent. Incontinence was present in 43.5% of patients at 3 months, and 37.7% at 12 months, with urge incontinence
being most common. Pre-stroke continence (P < 0.001) and female sex (P < 0.001) were independently associated with incon-
tinence at 12 months, whereas the effect of greater stroke severity was magnified with advancing age (P for interaction = 0.05).
Conclusion: the majority of survivors reported abnormal urinary symptoms early and late after stroke. Around a third of
patients had incontinence at 12 months, with pre-stroke UI, age, female sex and stroke severity predicting its presence.
