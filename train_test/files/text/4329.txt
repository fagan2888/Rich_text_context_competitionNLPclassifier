Abstract
Aim: To determine the opinions and attitudes of Turkish obstetricians and midwives to caesarean
section (C-section) and vaginal birth following a C-section.
Methods: The study involved obstetricians and midwives who were working in a state women's
hospital and two private hospitals in Gaziantep, Turkey. Participants were asked to complete
questionnaires on sociodemographic data and provide opinions about C-section.
Results: A total of 88 midwives and 22 obstetricians participated in the study. Approximately one-
third of midwives believed caesarean rates were high at their institution and more than 50%
thought that the rate should be reduced. In contrast, although approximately 80% of obstetricians
thought that caesarean rates in their institutions ranged between 25­50%, only 18% believed the
rate was high and 68% believed that the rate of should be reduced. Midwives and obstetricians
tended to agree on most suggested reasons for high C-section rates. When asked about
interventions that may reduce the C-section rates, midwives and obstetricians had opposing views.
However, most participants agreed that prenatal childbirth preparation courses would be
beneficial.
Conclusions: This study showed that most midwives and obstetricians believe the rate of
C-section at their institution is high and should be reduced.

Introduction
Caesarean section (C-section) is recom-
mended to maintain the health of the
mother and fetus when vaginal birth causes
complications.1­4 Although the indications
for caesarean delivery should be determined
on the basis of the medical condition of the
mother and baby, in some countries, such as
Turkey, the option for caesarean delivery on
request and patients' choice have led to a
considerable increase in C-section rates.5 A
study from Turkey in 2012 reported that
50% of caesarean deliveries were performed
on the obstetrician's recommendation or
patient's request.6 Other factors that may
influence the high rates of C-section include,
increasing trend in large for gestational age,
older age of the mother at first pregnancy,
socioeconomic status of the family, fear
of childbirth and/or perception that a
C-section is an easier way of giving birth.7
In addition, studies show that obstetricians
have also performed unnecessary caesarean
deliveries because of the fear of malprac-
tice3,8 and the long waiting time for vaginal
birth.9 For example, a study conducted by
the Turkish Ministry of Health found that
45% of physicians stated a preference for C-
section because of the fear of malpractice
and 27% of physicians reported that it took
less time, was easy to perform and was more
risk-free than a vaginal birth.10 A cross-
sectional study undertaken among pregnant
women in India, reported that 64% of
women believed that the doctors were delib-
erately opting for caesarean deliveries
instead of vaginal deliveries and that the
decision to perform a C-section was made by
the doctor.7 In addition, data from a study
from Egypt showed that 60% of
obstetricians accepted performing C-section
upon maternal request.11
According to the recommendations of the
International Federation of Gynecology and
Obstetrics, elective C-section other than for
medical reasons is not ethical.12 There is
evidence to suggest that C-section is asso-
ciated with an increased risk of severe
maternal and fetal morbidity related to
bleeding, uterine rupture, wound dehis-
cence, deep vein thrombosis, endotoxic
shock, puerperal sepsis, urethral and bowel
injuries, respiratory distress syndrome in the
new-born and breastfeeding problems due
to sedation in the newborns.2,13 Indeed, the
World Health Organization (WHO) has
recommended that the rate of C-sections
should not exceed 15% of all deliveries.14
However, with the exception of Iceland and
Finland, all Organisation for Economic Co-
operation and Development (OECD) coun-
tries have reported an increased rate of
caesarean deliveries over recent
years.11,15­17 In the USA, the rate for
C-sections in 2010 was 32% of all
births,17 while in Turkey in 2008, the rate
was 38%.18
Optional C-section without a medical
reason is a public health concern because
compared with uncomplicated vaginal deliv-
ery it is associated with an increase in
maternal mortality,19 higher hospital costs
(i.e. the price of a vaginal delivery is
estimated to be 50% less than the price of
a C-section),6 longer length of hospital
stay,17,20 and substantial burden on the
general economy.15
Over recent years, political, social and
medical projects in Turkey have been
initiated to try to minimize the physician
and hospital driven C-section rate.21
1740 Journal of International Medical Research 45(6)
For example, to eliminate any commercial
interest of hospitals, the fee for a vaginal
birth has been increased to the equivalent
for a C-section delivery. In other countries,
this practice has been associated with a
decrease in the number of caesarean deliv-
eries.22,23 Other practices followed in Turkey
include penalties (i.e. lower premiums) for
physicians and hospitals that are associated
with high numbers of C-sections and
rewards (i.e. higher premiums) for phys-
icians who encourage vaginal births.
However, although studies report that vagi-
nal birth after C-section is generally success-
ful7 as in several countries, Turkey has
adopted a general policy of `once a caesar-
ean, always a caesarean'.6,21, 24­26 Therefore,
this study aimed to examine the opinions
and attitudes of a sample of Turkish obstet-
ricians and midwives towards C-section and
vaginal birth following a caesarean delivery.
Methods
Study population
The midwives and obstetricians involved in
this study worked in a state women's hos-
pital and two private hospitals in Gaziantep,
Turkey (city population 1.8 million people).
The study took place between 01 January
2012 and 30 June 2012. A questionnaire
was used to determine the sociodemographic
characteristics of the study participants.
Questionnaire to determine participants'
views
To determine the views of the midwives and
obstetricians on vaginal or caesarean birth
following a C-section, a 5-point Likert-type
questionnaire was constructed based on a
related literature search. The questionnaire
consisted of 13 statements and participants
were asked to rate each statement as one of
the following: certainly do not agree, do not
agree, not sure, agree, certainly agree.
Responses were also scored 1­5, where
1 ¼ certainly do not agree and 5 ¼ certainly
agree. Of the 13 statements, eight were
related to possible causes for high C-section
rates and five were related to interventions
that may have affected the rates. A pilot
study was performed using 10 midwives and
two obstetricians (who also participated in
the actual study) to test the participants'
understanding of the questionnaires. As a
result of the pilot study, statements 4 and 5
were amended.
The final 13 statements were as follows:
(1) The increase in the rate of caesarean
births is related to birth difficulties.
(2) The increase in the rate of C-section is
because of new developments in
technology.
(3) The increase in the rate of caesarean
births is due to hospital management.
(4) The increase in the rate of caesareans
is due to the preferences of pregnant
women and their family/relatives.
(5) The increase in the rate of caesareans
is due to the fear of malpractice.
(6) The increase in the rate of caesareans
is due to the high number of births in
the organization.
(7) The increase in the rate of C-section is
due to the high number of previous
caesarean births.
(8) The increase in the rate of C-section
is due to the high number of women
who become pregnant at an advanced
age.
(9) The use of a partogram reduces the
rate of caesarean delivery.
(10) Getting a second expert opinion on the
type of delivery reduces the rate of C-
section.
(11) Application of the external cephalic
version reduces the rate of C-section.23
(12) Vaginal birth after caesarean birth
reduces the rate of C-section.
(13) Prenatal childbirth preparation
courses would decrease the caesarean
delivery rate.

The questionnaire was distributed to the
participants by the two researchers
(Menekse Aslan and Sezer Kisa) in a
sealed envelope and completed question-
naires were returned in a sealed envelope.
The study was approved by Zirve
University Ethics Committee (15-February-
2011; Approval Number: 2011-21). Verbal
or written informed consent was
obtained from all participants before the
start of the study. Participation was under-
stood to be completely voluntary and
anonymous.
Statistical analyses
All statistical analyses were performed using
the SPSSÕ statistical package, version 20.0
(SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) for
WindowsÕ. A P-value < 0.05 was con-
sidered to indicate statistical significance.
Paired Student's t-tests were used to com-
pare differences between the midwives and
obstetricians in questionnaire scale scores
and 2-test was used to evaluate differences
between midwives and obstetricians in cat-
egorical data (the three categories were:
agree/certainly agree; not sure; not agree/
certainly do not agree).
Results
From the identified local population of 120
midwives and 49 obstetricians, 88 midwives
and 22 obstetricians participated in the
study. The majority of participants were
less than 40 years of age (mean Æ SD age,
32.12 Æ 6:49 years; range, 21­50 years) and
approximately 70­80% had 1 to 9 years of
experience in the job (Table 1). All midwives
were women but the majority of the obstet-
ricians were men (17 of 22; 77%). Most
participants had 1­2 children, but while
58% (35 of 60) midwives had a vaginal
birth for their last child, 60% (12 of 20)
obstetricians had undergone a caesarean
delivery for their last child.
When midwives were asked about caesar-
ean delivery rates in their institutions,
approximately one-third (31%) of them
believed the rate was high and more than
half (52%) of them held the view that the
rate should be reduced (Table 2). In con-
trast, although approximately 80% of
obstetricians thought that caesarean rates
in their institutions ranged between
25­50%, only 18% believed the rate was
high and approximately two-thirds of them
(68%) believed that the rate should be
reduced.

Considering statements 1­8, midwives
and obstetricians tended to agree on five of
the eight suggested reasons for high rates of
C-section (Table 3). However, they dis-
agreed on statements 1, 3 and 6. For state-
ment 1 (i.e. the reason for the increase in the
rate of caesarean births is related to birth
difficulties) and statement 6 (i.e. the increase
is due to the high number of births in the
organization), obstetricians had signifi-
cantly higher mean scores (i.e. agreed with
the statement) compared with midwives
(P < 0.05) (Table 3). In contrast, for state-
ment 3 (i.e. the reason for the increase in the
rate is due to hospital management), mid-
wives had a significantly higher mean score
(i.e. agreed with the statement) compared
with obstetricians (P < 0.05).
Similarly, when the responses were
grouped into three categories (i.e. `agree/
certainly agree', `not sure' and `not agree/
certainly do not agree') significant differ-
ences between midwives and obstetricians
were found for statements 1, 3, and 6
(P < 0.05). In addition, a significant differ-
ence between the two groups was also found
for statement 4 (i.e. the increase in the rate of
caesareans is due to the preferences of
pregnant women and their family/relatives)
with more midwives than obstetricians
agreeing with the statement (P < 0.05).
When participants were asked their opin-
ions about interventions that may reduce the
high C-section rates (statements 9­13), mid-
wives and obstetricians had opposing views.
Midwives tended to agree more with the
propositions (i.e. use of partogram, getting a
second expert opinion, application of the
external cephalic version, advocating vagi-
nal birth, prenatal childbirth preparation
courses) compared with obstetricians and
this was reflected by their significantly
higher mean scores for statements 9­12
(P < 0.05) (Table 4). However, most partici-
pants agreed that prenatal childbirth prep-
aration courses would be beneficial.

that almost one out of three midwives and
one out of five obstetricians thought that
rates in their institutions were high and more
than 50% of midwives and obstetricians
were of the opinion that the rate should be
reduced. Indeed, a report based on data
from OECD countries concluded that C-
section rates are highest in Turkey (43%)
and Mexico (42%) and lowest in the
Netherlands (14%) where home births are
a common option for women with low risk
pregnancies.4,17 According to Turkey's
Ministry of Health, caesarean delivery
should only be performed when there is a
significant risk of maternal or fetal morbid-
ity or mortality.21 However, although the
Ministry of Health does not look favourably
upon elective caesareans, studies con-
ducted in Turkey have found that one of
the main drivers for C-section is maternal
request.27,28
A large proportion of the obstetricians
participating in the present study suggested
that birth difficulties were responsible for the
high rates of caesarean deliveries. This
finding is in agreement with other studies
that found the principal indications (85%)
for caesarean delivery were labour difficul-
ties, fetal distress, breech presentation and
previous caesarean delivery.7,18,29 In con-
trast, midwives in this present study were of
the opinion that hospital management
policy was responsible for the high rates of
caesarean births. Studies from other coun-
tries have reported similar findings and
found that a large percentage of women
believed that hospitals were promoting
caesarean deliveries rather than vaginal
births.7,22,30 Importantly, a report from the
WHO found that healthcare system factors
have been overlooked as potentially import-
ant determinants of C-section utilization in

favour of the impact of women's choices and
doctors' preferences.9
Among the suggested reasons for high
caesarean rates, `a high number of previous
caesarean births' attained a high score
among midwives and obstetricians. In
Turkey, as in several countries, a policy of
`once a caesarean, always a caesarean' has
been adopted.18,24­26 The WHO has sug-
gested that obstetricians have a substantial
influence on the type of delivery and con-
tribute importantly to the increase in C-
section rates.9 The report also concluded
that there was a direct association between
the number of midwives per head and a
decrease in caesarean delivery rate.9
Most midwives who participated in this
present study agreed that a strategy for
reducing high C-section rates was to obtain
a second expert opinion. Having the option
to request a second opinion has been sug-
gested as being a strong facilitator for
encouraging women to choose the safest
mode of delivery.23 However, a study from
Canada found that some obstetricians
believed that a second opinion should only
be obtained after a request from a family
practitioner because of difficulties in the
medico-legal responsibilities between two
obstetricians.23 Moreover, we believe that
it would be difficult to insist on a second
opinion for women who have already
decided to have a planned C-section. In
Turkey, there is no legal obligation to
request a second opinion but some countries
do require a second opinion for non-urgent
caesarean deliveries particularly in cases
where caesarean delivery on maternal
request is planned.31,32
In this present study, a large proportion
of midwives and obstetricians (52 of 110;
47%) believed that encouraging vaginal
delivery following a caesarean birth for
women who fulfilled the appropriate criteria
would reduce the rate of C-section.
However, the obstetricians in the present
study did not agree with this proposal. A
study from Egypt concluded that obstetri-
cians' perspectives towards caesarean deliv-
ery were influenced by feelings of insecurity
about performing problematic vaginal
deliveries, fear of legal liability, non-
organizational practice and higher revenue
from C-section births compared with
uncomplicated vaginal births.11
Although midwives and obstetricians in
Turkey have the final decision on the mode
of delivery, some patients insist on C-section
delivery.27 However, a study of 247 pregnant
women in India suggests that women do not
rigidly adhere to a preferred method of
birth.7 In the Indian study, the majority of
women reported that they would prefer a
vaginal delivery and so patient preference is
unlikely to be a principal driver for increas-
ing C-section rates.7 However, most women
were in favour of C-section if it was neces-
sary to protect their health or that of their
baby.7,33 Data from a Turkish study of the
views of 49 family physicians on caesarean
delivery on maternal request, found that
61% felt that there should be a medical
indication for caesarean delivery.21 In con-
trast, another study from Turkey found that
24% of medical students were of the opinion
that optional C-section can be performed
without any medical indication.34
The majority of the participating obstetri-
cians and midwives in this present study
agreed with the hypothesis that prenatal
childbirth preparation courses would
decrease the rate of caesarean delivery.
However, there are conflicting results in the
literature. One study showed that there is a
need for nurse-led relaxation classes and
birth preparation classes that may reduce
C-section rates in low risk pregnancies.35
However, a study conducted in Canada
involving 1,318 pregnant women found that
many women were not prepared to make
their own decisions on mode of delivery.36 In
addition, another study concluded that
obstetricians believed that informing women
about the risks and benefits of vaginal

delivery versus elective C-section was time-
consuming and may have no impact on their
final decision, particularly when women
request a repeat C-section.1,17,23
A possible limitation of the study was
the small sample size and the unequal
number of participants in each group (i.e.
88 midwives and 22 obstetricians). In add-
ition, the questionnaire had not been exten-
sively tested and so had not been effectively
validated. Therefore, further studies are
required to substantiate these preliminary
findings.
In conclusion, the results of this study
suggest that the following strategies could be
implemented and may result in a reduction
of the C-section rate in Turkey: (i) prenatal
childbirth education classes should be
promoted to increase pregnant women's
knowledge about the risks and benefits of
C-section compared with vaginal delivery;
(ii) the knowledge and skills of midwives
and physicians/obstetricians with regard to
vaginal birth following a C-section should
be improved; (iii) unnecessary elective pri-
mary C-section rates should be reduced
without compromising maternal and fetal
safety; (iv) health policies that advocate a
second expert opinion for elective C-section
should be initiated and could be used as a
strategy to reduce the primary C-section
rate; and (v) further research is needed to
determine the reasons for maternal elective
C-sections.
