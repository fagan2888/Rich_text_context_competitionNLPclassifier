Introduction
Well-functioning domestic and international agricultural com-
modity price transmissions play an important role for efficient
resource allocation and economic growth. Slow and imperfect
price transmissions leave producers and consumers to make
decisions based on prices that do not reflect their real social
costs and benefits, leading to slow economic growth (World
Bank, 2012b). An understanding of spatial market integration
is important to formulate good economic policies (Dutoit,
Villafuerte, & Urrutia, 2009; Moser, Barrett, & Minten, 2009;
Varela,Aldaz-Carroll, & Iacovone, 2012). Spatial market inte-
gration refers to both short-term comovements and long-run
relationships among prices. It is defined as the smooth trans-
mission of price signals and information across geographically
separated markets (Goletti, Ahmed, & Farid, 1995). Market
integration can also be defined as a measure of the extent to
which demand and supply in one location are transmitted to
another (Negassa, Meyers, & Maldhin, 2003). Price differ-
ences beyond what can be explained by transportation and
transaction costs indicate inefficient arbitrage and possibly the
existence of market power. If markets are not well integrated,
this often reflects the presence of infrastructural and institu-
tional bottlenecks that interfere with the efficient flow of
goods and prices between markets (Goletti & Babu, 1994).
Investigating price transmission from the international to
the domestic market, and integration among domestic mar-
kets within a country helps governments in formulating
effective polices regarding investments in infrastructure and
decisions aimed at improved food security and reduced pov-
erty. Regional and international price differences and spatial
price dynamics provide important information for public
market regulation and intervention, as well as information to
producers and consumers when making decisions regarding
resource allocation. Weak market integration may convey
incorrect signals to both producers and consumers (Alexander
& Wyeth, 1994; Dawe, 2008; Dutoit et al., 2009; Varela
et al., 2012).
Rice is the basic staple food for about half of the world's
population. International trade in rice is thin, with only about
5% to 7% of total world production being traded globally

Are Pakistan's Rice Markets Integrated
Domestically and With the International
Markets?
Burhan Ahmad1 and Ole Gjølberg2
Abstract
We analyze whether Pakistan has become one domestically integrated rice market and whether Pakistan's rice markets are
integrated with the international markets, using monthly data from 1994 to 2011. During this period, major policy shifts took
place. In 2002, Pakistan terminated the price support policy; in 2002-2004 export subsidies were introduced, and in 2008,
a minimum export price policy was adopted. We compare the degree of integration before and after 2002. We find that
most of the regional rice markets in Pakistan are integrated domestically. Pakistan's rice markets are also integrated with
the international markets, using prices in Thailand and Vietnam as benchmarks. The price support policy abolition seems to
have contributed to greater domestic integration, while the subsequent export policies seem to have decreased the extent
of Pakistan's integration with the international markets. However, although Pakistan's rice markets generally are domestically
integrated as well as integrated with the international market, price adjustments are quite slow. Thus, only 3% to 11% of
deviations from long-run equilibrium are adjusted on a monthly basis, indicating that a shock in international markets takes
several months to be fully transferred to prices in Pakistan.

Asia's Rice Bowls," 2011). In Asia, domestic policies basi-
cally ensure self-sufficiency in many countries. The major
exporters of milled rice include Thailand, Vietnam, Pakistan,
India, China, the United States, and Italy. However, two
exceptional rice trading nations are Pakistan and Thailand
due to their low domestic consumption, which is less than
50% of their total production (Childs & Baldwin, 2010).
The thin nature of the world rice market may generate
localpricepatternsandexcessivelocalvolatility.Protectionist
trade policies such as regulated prices, procurement and gov-
ernment storage, import tariffs, export subsidies, and export
taxes adopted by importers and exporters of rice may
strengthen price hikes and volatility in rice markets (Childs
& Baldwin, 2010; Razzaque & Laurent, 2006; "Rice: Asia's
Rice Bowls," 2011; Wailes, 2005).
Rice is an important food and cash crop within Pakistan's
agricultural industry, being the second largest staple food
crop after wheat and the second largest export item after cot-
ton and cotton products (Government of Pakistan [GoP],
2011). Pakistan ranks 12th in paddy rice production and 4th
in milled rice exports in the world. Paddy rice contributes
1.3% to world production, and exports of milled rice account
for 10.9% of total world rice exports (United Nations, Food
and Agriculture Organization [UNFAO], 2010). Two main
varieties of rice, International Rice Research Institute (IRRI)
and Basmati, are produced. In this study, we use monthly
prices in the major IRRI rice markets in Pakistan, whereas
the free on Board (FOB) price of Thai 5% broken rice (a
close substitute for IRRI rice) is used as an international
benchmark price1 to test the level of market integration
between domestic and international markets. In addition to
export prices for Pakistan, export prices from Thailand and
Vietnam are used to analyze international market integration.
Both Thai and Vietnam rice prices have been major interna-
tional benchmarks. Earlier studies such as Mushtaq, Abbas,
Abedullah, and Ghafoor (2006) and Ghafoor and Aslam
(2012) focused mainly on the market for Basmati rice in
Punjab province. The present study uses the price of IRRI
rice--a species with higher yields, production, and exports--
to analyze the effects of the support price policy that was
ended in 2002, export subsidies between 2002-2003 and
2003-2004, and minimum export price policies in 2008, and
a comparison of market integration before and after 2002.
An Overview of the Rice Sector in
Pakistan
Pakistan being a developing country with an agro-based
economy has 42% of its labor force working in agriculture,
which accounts for 23% of its gross domestic product (GDP).
Rice production covers about 20% of the total cropped area
for food grain production in the country.2 It accounts for
almost 6% of the value added in agriculture and contributes
1.3% of GDP. About 40% to 50% of the rice produced in
Pakistan is exported because of the relatively low annual per
capita domestic consumption of about 10 kg (Anwar, 2004;
GoP, 2011). This also explains higher exports of IRRI rice
compared with Basmati rice, as consumption of Basmati rice
is higher than that of IRRI rice. The marketing chain is com-
posed of domestic producers, village dealers, commission
agents, wholesalers, retailers, processors, and exporters
before reaching domestic and international consumers.
Punjab province is a major producer of Basmati rice,
whereas Sindh province is a major producer of IRRI rice.
There was no Basmati production in Sindh province until
2008, and only a very small area was allocated subsequently.
Although the area under total rice cultivation has varied by
25%--between 2.1 and 2.6 million hectares--production
nearly doubled between 1994 and 2011, reaching 7.1 million
tons. The area under basmati rice cultivation varied between
1.3 and 1.7 million hectares, while production of Basmati
rice fluctuated between 1.2 and 3.1 million tons. The area
under cultivation and the production of IRRI rice ranged
between 0.62 and 0.92 million hectares, and between 0.3 and
3.0 million tons, respectively. Despite the lower area under
IRRI rice cultivation, its production remained higher than
Basmati because of its high yield per hectare. The average
yield of IRRI and Basmati production was 2,468 and 1,208
kg per hectare, respectively, from 1993 to 1996; yet it was
2,931 and 1,737 kg per hectare from 2008 to 2011. During
2001-2011, total exports of rice varied between 1.58 and
4.18 million tons, with Basmati and non-Basmati (mainly
IRRI6 and IRRI9)3 exports varying between 0.55 and 1.17
million tons and 1.01 and 3.15 million tons, respectively. In
the latter period, exports of non-Basmati rice varieties were
greater than that of Basmati rice, which reflects the increas-
ing importance of IRRI rice for export. During the crisis
period 2007-2008, exports for both varieties decreased, pos-
sibly because of the minimum export price policy during this
period. However; after the crisis period and the withdrawal
of the policy, exports of both varieties increased, with a
larger increase seen for non-Basmati rice exports, indicating
a greater responsiveness of non-Basmati rice exports to
increased prices during the crisis period. As a result of the
decrease in prices in 2009-2010, exports of non-Basmati rice
decreased again (GoP, 2012; UNFAO, 2010).
A wide range of government policies and regulations influ-
encing the rice markets have been enacted in Pakistan. Still, the
interventions in many cases have been temporary, or they have
not been implemented to an extent that has had strong effects
on economic behavior. For example, there have been restric-
tions on the movement of rice across regions within Pakistan
and bans on the production of certain varieties and sowing in
certain areas to reclaim saline lands. Price supports and govern-
ment procurement programs existed until 2001-2002. After
2002, the government's role has been limited to the occasional
and irregular announcement of an indicative support price
(Salam, 2009). This essentially is to create a price floor during
the post-harvest period when supply is abundant, but it does not
replace market-determined prices. The intention is to correct
Ahmad and Gjølberg 3
shortcomings in the marketing system (Anwar, 2004). In 1987-
1988, the government allowed the private sector to export rice,
which gave rise to the Rice Exporters Association of Pakistan
(REAP; 2010), formed in 1988-1989 by private exporters.
During the study period, no export taxes were imposed; how-
ever, an export subsidy was provided in 2 years, 2002-2003 and
2003-2004 (World Trade Organization [WTO], 2011).
However, on account of the high international prices in 2007-
2008, the government fixed the minimum export prices inApril
2008, but this was abolished by October 2008 (Salam, 2009).
Import tariffs on rice were in effect but were reduced from 15%
to 10% on an most favored nation (MFN) basis in 1999.
Exchange rate policies include a managed float since 1982 and
multiple exchange rate regimes in 1998 after the nuclear tests.
Since 2000, the current flexible exchange rate system has been
in place (Hyder & Mahboob, 2006).
Domestic and International Rice Prices
1994-2011
In this study, we have included prices from six regions in
Pakistan, which are Sukhar, Hyderabad, Multan, Rawalpindi,
Peshawar, and Hyderabad (see the map in the appendix).
Among the selected markets for the present study, Peshawar
andQuettaaretheprovincialcapitalsofKhyberPakhtoonkhan
and Baluchistan provinces, respectively, while Rawalpindi is
the neighbor city of the provincial capital of Punjab,
Islamabad. Hyderabad is located close to Karachi, the provin-
cial capital of Sindh and a port city. Sukhar is located in Sindh
province close to Hyderabad and also to Multan, close to the
border between Sindh and Punjab provinces. Hyderabad and
Sukhar are located closer to the major production regions,
with populations of about 10.4 and 0.40 million, respectively.
Multan is close to Sukhar and has a population of about 1.55
million. Quetta and Peshawar are more remote from the pro-
duction regions, with populations of about 0.84 and 1.3 mil-
lion, respectively; however, Peshawar is situated close to the
border of Afghanistan, while Quetta is located close to the
borders of Iran and Afghanistan. Both countries are among
the largest markets for rice exports from Pakistan. Rawalpindi
has about 1.83 million inhabitants and lies between Multan
and Peshawar but is closer to Peshawar.
The monthly prices of rice in the international market are
represented by Thai (FOB) 5% broken long grain white rice.
Just like IRRI, this is a coarse grain, and the two are close
substitutes. The Thai price and an average price of six domes-
tic regions of Pakistan are plotted in Figure 1. Price fluctua-
tions are evident, along with a declining price trend during
the period 1995-2001 followed by rising prices and a sharp
increase in price during the international food crisis in 2007-
2008. Domestic prices are lower than international prices as
transportation costs are not included in domestic prices.
Quality differences can be another reason as they are close
but not perfect substitutes. Low domestic prices represent an
incentive and potential to export. However, our main con-
cern is to study the comovement of prices in the domestic
and international markets and to examine whether the
changes in the international markets are being transmitted to
the domestic markets.
Data and Method
The data for Thai 5% broken white rice in U.S. dollars for the
period January 1994 to April 2011 are taken from the World
Bank pink sheet (World Bank, 2012a), while the data for
prices of IRRI rice in Pakistan's domestic markets are taken
from agricultural statistics of Pakistan (GoP, 2012). Domestic
prices are converted to U.S. dollars using monthly exchange

rates from Oanda (2012). Prices of IRRI rice and Thai 5%
are taken to test the market integration between domestic and
international markets as both are coarse varieties and are
close substitutes. The data for FOB prices of Pakistan,
Thailand and Vietnam 25% broken rice are taken from vari-
ous monthly issues of Rice Market Monitor published by the
UNFAO (2013) for the period 2006-2013. These prices are
taken to test the integration among the international markets
as they are all coarse varieties with 25% broken contents and
are close substitute.
Cointegration analysis is a standard approach in studies of
market integration. Following the approach of many studies
of spatial integration, we apply theAugmented Dickey­Fuller
(ADF) and Phillips­Perron (PP) unit-root tests to test the sta-
tionary of the data. All the price series are found to be non-
stationary in levels in log form and stationary in first
differences, allowing for the testing of cointegration among
the price series. We apply the Johansen methodology
(Johansen & Juselius, 1990) estimating the trace and maxi-
mum eigenvalues to test for cointegration among the prices
series. The Engle and Granger (1987) two-step procedure
(hereafter EG) is also used to test for cointegration. As men-
tioned above, there was a fundamental change in Pakistan's
agricultural and trade policy after 2002 when the support
policy was terminated and a minimum export price policy
was implemented in 2008. Such policy shifts may represent
structural breaks in the time series and as such, generate sub-
stantial econometric challenges when conducting cointegra-
tion analysis. Specifically, a structural break may affect the
power of cointegration tests (see, for example, Campos,
Ericsson, & Hendry, 1996). A number of econometric
approaches have been presented to handle structural breaks in
the times series (e.g., Franses, 2001; Johansen, Moscow, &
Nilesen, 2000). Instead of applying such rather complicated
methods, we have taken a more simplistic approach. Thus, to
analyze the effects of the support policy that was ended in
2002 and the export policies that were adopted after 2002, the
sample is divided into two sub-periods, before and after 2002.
This approach enables us to study directly whether the policy
change had an effect on market integration.
Vector error correction models (VECMs) are estimated if
the series are cointegrated. The general form of the VECM is

Previous Studies on Market Integration
There is a large body of literature on commodity market
integration, including a number of studies focusing on
markets in developing countries. Silvapulle and Jayasuriya
(1994) found integration among domestic rice markets in
the Philippines, while Dawson and Dey (2002) found
highly integrated rice markets in Bangladesh. Van Tilburg,
Kuiper, and Swinkels (2008) tested law of one price for
potato markets in Bhutan using three auction prices. They
found integration during 1996-2000 while market imper-
fections existed for the period 2002-2005. Munir,
Sureshwaran, Selassie, and Nyankori (1997) found market
integration among all the selected markets of vegetables
in Indonesia. Kaur, Arshad, and Tan (2010) found market
integration in the broiler sector in Malaysia although
structural rigidities were present. Nga (2009) found inte-
gration among 9 out of 34 rice markets in Vietnam, while
Ghosh (2010) found integration of grain markets within
and across different states in India. Acharya, Ramesh,
Birthal, Kumar, and Negi (2012) found integration among
most domestic rice and wheat markets in India. Mushtaq
and Dawson (2002) applied Johansen's test and the VECM
methodology to measure the acreage response of agricul-
tural commodities in Pakistan. Asche, Gjølberg, and
Guttormsen (2012) used Johansen's test to test the central
market hypothesis in the Sorghum markets of Tanzania.
Acharya et al. (2012) applied cointegration and VECM
techniques to measure market integration in the rice and
wheat markets of India. Silvapulle and Jayasuriya (1994)
used Johansen's methodology to test the market integra-
tion of rice in the domestic markets of the Philippines.
Minot (2011) applied cointegration and error correction
techniques to investigate the effects of changes in the
world food markets on the staple foods of Sub-Saharan
Africa using the small-country assumption. Greb, Jamora,
Mengel, von Cramon-Taubadel, and Würriehausen (2012)
studied colinks among domestic markets of agricultural
commodities in developing countries with those among
international markets, using cointegration and error cor-
rection techniques.
Among the studies on integration of domestic markets
with international markets, Conforti (2004) investigated
price transmission for a number of agricultural commodities
for 16 countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America using
autoregressive distributed lag models and cointegration tests.
He found relatively incomplete transmission in African mar-
kets relative to that in Asian and Latin American markets.
For Pakistan, he used annual data for some of the major crops
and animal products such as meat. He found a long-run rela-
tionship between the domestic price and the world reference
Ahmad and Gjølberg 5
price for wheat, rice, maize, and bovine meat; however, coin-
tegration tests did not confirm the results for the latter. He
also found a long-run relationship between export prices of
Basmati rice and domestic wholesale prices of IRRI rice.
Sanogo and Amadou (2010) found that prices of coarse rice
in Nepal responded to shocks originating in India. Minot
(2011) found long-run relationships with the world food
prices for only 13 out of 62 domestic markets in Sub-Saharan
Africa. Rice prices are more closely related to international
market prices than are maize prices. John (2013) found that
Thai rice export price shocks are transmitted into the domes-
tic markets of Thailand, although the causality tests between
export and domestic prices were not clear possibly because
domestic pricing policies were in place.
Market integration studies were also conducted to ana-
lyze the policy effects. Among others, Ghosh (2011) inves-
tigated the effects of agricultural policy reforms on spatial
market integration of food grain markets in India. He found
that policy reforms contributed to improvement of spatial
market integration in the post-reform period as segmented
or poorly integrated markets in the pre-reforms period
were strongly integrated in the post-reform period. Sekhar
(2012) found market integration among those agricultural
markets of India that did not face restrictions on interstate
or interregional trade such as chick-peas and edible oils.
He added that rice markets were not integrated at the
national level because of restrictions on interstate trade.
Chand (2008) found that the price spike in 2007-2008 was
not transmitted to the domestic markets of India because of
policy intervention by the Indian government (Acharya
et al., 2012). Nga (2009), however, found integration
among the rice export prices in Vietnam and Thailand, and
that removal of export quotas did not have a significant
effect on the relationship between prices in these two
countries. Dorosh and Rashid (2013) found that before the
crisis in 2007, domestic prices in Bangladesh were cointe-
grated with subsidized import parity prices; however, after
mid-2007, prices in Bangladesh increased because of the
restrictive export policies of India, which is one of the big-
gest import markets for Bangladesh. John (2013) con-
cluded that Thailand's domestic price policies are not
creating large distorting effects on world rice markets.
Econometric Results
The results for the ADF and PP unit-root tests are presented
in Table 1. The hypothesis that the log prices contain a unit
root could not be rejected at the 5% level of significance,
indicating that all the prices are non-stationary except the
Vietnam 25% price, which is stationary at the 5% level of
significance according to ADF test, but non-stationary
according to the PP test. The ADF test statistic of -2.91 is
very close to the 5% critical value of -2.89. However, taking
the first differences of the logs of prices, the unit-root hypoth-
esis is clearly rejected. These tests were also applied by
including a trend term, but the stationarity results remain
unchanged. So, all the prices series are I (1), permitting an
analysis of cointegration among the prices obtained in the
different markets.
In this study, pairwise market integration among
Pakistan's domestic markets is tested using the Johansen
and EG methodologies. Lag selection was made using the
Akaike information criterion (AIC), Schwarz Bayesian
information criteria (SBIC), and/or Hannen­Quim infor-
mation criteria (HQIC) selection criteria for Johansen tests
while four lags were selected for EG tests. Using Johansen's

method (Table 2), we find all the pairs to be cointegrated
except for Hyderabad­Peshawar and Hyderabad­Quetta.
Applying the EG test (Table 3), we find that the Hyderabad­
Peshawar, Hyderabad­Rawalpindi, and Hyderabad­Multan
pairs are not cointegrated (indicated with bold formatting).
No cointegration indicates that price signals are not trans-
mitted efficiently from one market to another, possibly
resulting in non-optimal decisions among producers, con-
sumers, and inventory holders. Moreover, marketing mar-
gins are likely to be higher than in other markets as the
absence of cointegration can be exploited by traders. The
possible absence of cointegration and inefficient flow of
information between Hyderabad and Peshawar/Quetta may
reflect the distance between these markets, situated in
three different provinces and having the greatest distance
among the sample markets. The result may also reflect low
levels of trade and poor infrastructure. Government invest-
ment, particularly in infrastructure and transportation, in
markets that are not integrated might help to integrate
these markets.
The results from our Johansen cointegration and EG tests
are presented in Tables 4 and 5, respectively. The results

indicate that a long-run cointegration relationship exists
between the prices. The trace and maximum eigenvalue statis-
tics are greater than their respective critical values, suggesting
that all six domestic markets are integrated with the interna-
tional market and that there is one cointegrating vector in
each pair of domestic markets and the international market.
The results also show that the average prices of rice in the
domestic markets of Pakistan and the price of Thai 5% bro-
ken rice are also cointegrated. The ADF results for the EG
tests show that all domestic prices including their average are
integrated with the Thai 5% prices except for prices in
Hyderabad and Sukhar markets.
The trace and maximum eigenvalue statistics for Thai and
Viet 25% broken rice show that these export prices are inte-
grated, while the results of the EG test indicate that these mar-
kets are not integrated. Both the Johansen and EG tests find that
Pak andViet 25% export prices are cointegrated, whereas results
for Pak and Thai 25% are mixed. According to the trace statis-
tics, these markets are integrated, whereas the maximum eigen-
value statistics and EG tests show that they are not integrated.
As described in "An Overview of the Rice Sector in
Pakistan" section of this article, there was a policy change in
2001-2002, when the support price policy was terminated.
Moreover, after 2002, export subsidies were granted to rice
exporters for the 2 years 2002-2003 and 2003-2004, and a
minimum export price policy was adopted on account of the
price spike during the so-called food crisis in 2007-2008.
After 2002, the government's role was limited to the occa-
sional and irregular announcement of an indicative support
price (Salam, 2009). The data set is divided into two parts--
that is, before and after 2002. ADF and PP unit-root tests are
performed on both data sets, and the results are presented in
Tables 6 and 7. The results indicate that both the series are
non-stationary at log levels and stationary after taking first
difference of the log series suggesting that order of integra-
tion is one. Two exceptions are Hyderabad, which is station-
ary at 5% level during 2003-2011, and Peshawar, which is
stationary at 10% in the period 1994-2002.

The Johansen and EG tests were used to test for cointegra-
tion among pairs of domestic markets as well as the interna-
tional market. The ADF stationarity test results (Table 8) for
the EG test reveal that 10 market pairs were not integrated
until 2002, whereas the number of non-integrated market pairs
falls from 10 to 8 after 2002. This indicates that the degree of
cointegration among the domestic markets increased after the
termination of the support price policy. However, before 2002,
this policy did not seem to influence the degree of cointegra-
tion of Pakistan's domestic markets with the international
market as almost all the markets were integrated with the
international market. The results suggest a positive influence
of the policy change on the functioning and degree of cointe-
gration within the domestic markets, which supports the cessa-
tion of the costly support price policy and government
procurement. Mushtaq and Dawson (2002) recommended
ending the support price policy for rice in Pakistan.
Both the Johansen and EG test results show that all the
domestic rice markets were integrated with the international
market before 2002 except for Hyderabad, which was not inte-
grated according to Johansen's test but integrated according to
the EG test results. Using the average domestic price as a proxy
for Pakistan's rice market, we also find Pakistan to be integrated
with the international market before 2002. However, both tests
show that the degree of market integration with the international
market decreased after 2002 as Sukhar and Multan were no lon-
ger integrated according to the Johansen test results (Table 9),
whereas all the markets were no longer integrated according to
EG results (Table 10). Moreover, both of the test results show
that average domestic prices were not cointegrated with the
international reference price after 2002. The export subsidy
policies adopted by Pakistan during the period 2002-2004 and
the minimum export price policy in 2008 may have caused this
decrease in the degree of integration.
Ahmad and Gjølberg 9
The pairwise VECM estimates using the maximum
likelihood method for those domestic markets found to be
cointegrated are reported in Table 11. Lag selection was
made using the AIC, SBIC, and/or HQIC selection crite-
ria, which suggested the lag order of two. Langrangian­
Multiplier (LM) test was applied to test autocorrelation
between the VECM residuals. The results accept the
hypothesis of no autocorrelation at 5% level of signifi-
cance in most of the market pairs except Quetta­
Rawalpindi, Quetta­Sukhar, and Quetta­Peshawar;
however, autocorrelation does not exist at Lag 1. As the
estimations for all other market pairs are conducted at
Lag Level 2, we did the same for these market pairs for
getting short-run elasticities and better comparisons.
However, there is no change in the level of significance
of the coefficients, while their magnitude varies a little.
The coefficients for the long-run relationships are statis-
tically significant and negative at the 1% level of signifi-
cance in all pairs. The long-run elasticity of price
transmission ranges from 0.89 to 1.0 indicating a high
degree of transmission of price changes from one market
to the other in the long run. The Johansen test results for
cointegration show that a long-run relationship exists
among these markets. However, the degree and statistical
significance of the coefficients on the speed of adjust-
ment vary across the pairs. For most of the pairs, the
coefficients on the speed of adjustment are statistically
significant at the 1% or 5% level of significance, except
for Multan­Quetta, which is significant only at the 10%
level of significance. These coefficients have the expected
signs, indicating that prices converge. However, there are
two exceptions, Rawalpindi­Quetta and Peshawar­Quetta,
whose coefficients are not statistically significant. In con-
trast, the coefficients of Quetta­Rawalpindi and Quetta­
Peshawar are statistically significant, implying that prices
in the Quetta markets adjust to correct any disequilibrium
between these pairs. The values of the coefficients of
short-run adjustment are all small, varying from 0.02 to
0.22. The pairs including Hyderabad have the lowest
speed of adjustment. The pairs including Rawalpindi, the
neighboring city of Pakistan's capital Islamabad, move
quickly toward equilibrium with a speed of adjustment
from 11% to 22%, except for Rawalpindi­Quetta, which
has an insignificant coefficient as described earlier. A
possible reason is the large distance between the two
markets, resulting in low volumes of trade. The actual
data on trade between these markets are not available;
however, it can be approximated on the basis of the distance
between the cities and from the location of the production
regions. For instance, Quetta and Rawalpindi are both non/
very small producers and very far from each other, being
situated on two different sides of the producing regions and
in two different provinces.
In general, the process of adjustment toward long-run
equilibrium appears to be slow. The estimated correction
parameters are in the range 0.03 to 0.22 across the different
market pairs, implying that 3% to 22% of any divergence
from long-run equilibrium is corrected monthly. Possible
reasons for this slow adjustment are the low level of
domestic consumption, low volume of trade in distant mar-
ket pairs, poor infrastructure, and market power of traders.
The coefficients on the short-run elasticity of price trans-
mission are statistically significant and have the expected
signs in many cases, suggesting that price changes in
recent months significantly affect current and future
changes in the prices among these market pairs. These
results are helpful for forming expectations of future prices
and accordingly, decisions regarding storage and resource
allocation. However, there are market pairs where the
short-run price transmission elasticity coefficients are not
significant, suggesting that past changes in prices are not
transmitted in the short run, although there exist signifi-
cant long-run equilibrium relationships. This might be due
to the direction of causality, distance, and infrastructure
between them resulting in weak market integration or a
low speed of adjustment.
The VECM's results for the Pakistan's domestic and
international markets are reported in Table 12. Lag selec-
tion was made using the AIC, SBIC, and/or HQIC selec-
tion criteria, which suggested the lag order of two. LM
test was applied to test autocorrelation between the VECM
residuals. The results accept the hypothesis of no autocor-
relation at 5% level of significance. The coefficients on
the speed of adjustment in domestic as well as interna-
tional markets are statistically significant at 1% or 5%

level of significance except for Peshawar. This suggests
that both the prices adjust to deviations from the long-run
equilibrium; however, coefficient values are very small
ranging from 0.03 to 0.11, which suggest that process of
adjustment is very slow. About 3% to 11% of deviation
from the long-run equilibrium is adjusted every month.
The possible reasons can be the infrastructure deficien-
cies, slow transportation, and trade rigidities. Our objec-
tive in this article is to examine the price transmission
from the international markets to the domestic markets of
Pakistan. Hence, interpretation of the results focuses on
the results of domestic market equations in the VECM.
The VECM estimates for each of the individual domestic
markets paired with the international market show that the coef-
ficients of the speed of adjustment in all markets are statistically
significant at the 1% level of significance, except for the
Hyderabad market, which is significant at the 5% level of sig-
nificance. This coefficient is not significant for Peshawar. This
implies that prices in all individual markets except Peshawar
move toward a long-run equilibrium with the international
market. The coefficient value in Rawalpindi, Multan, and
Quetta markets is about 0.10. The values of these coefficients
for Sukhar and Hyderabad, the closest markets geographically,
are 0.07 and 0.02, respectively. The coefficient for the
Hyderabad market is quite low despite the fact that the
Hyderabad is not far away from Karachi from where it is easy
to ship rice to the international markets. This reflects that
direct trade from Sukhar to Karachi is taking place. Sukhar is
located relatively closer to the production areas, and it makes
a little difference to travel to Karachi or Hyderabad. The coef-
ficients on the long-run equilibrium in all the markets are sta-
tistically significant at the 1% level of significance. The
coefficient values ranges from 0.68 to 0.98, showing that in
the long run, about 68% to 98% of changes in the international
market are transmitted to the domestic markets of Pakistan.
The short-run elasticity of price transmission with
respect to own lagged differenced market price and lagged
differenced international price presents a mixed picture.
All the short-run elasticity coefficients are statistically
significant at the 1% or 5% level of significance except
for Sukhar and Quetta. In Sukhar, its own price short-run
coefficient is not significant, whereas in Quetta, short-run
coefficient with respect to world's price is not significant.
The values on these coefficients range from 0.21 to 0.32.
The Hyderabad market captures more of the effect of past
changes in its own price, 32%, compared with the interna-
tional price. Only 3% of changes in the international market

a,b,cStatistically significant at the 1%, 5%, and 10% levels, respectively.
42% of past price changes are transmitted each month
compared with 33% of changes in the international market
over a month. The values for the Peshawar market are
19% and 18% in 1 month, respectively. The coefficients
on the short-run elasticities with respect to the interna-
tional price in the Quetta market are not significant,
whereas with respect to its own market, it is significant.
This shows a low responsiveness of the Quetta market to
the international market, although it is integrated with the
international market, and its long-run coefficient is statis-
tically significant. Low responsiveness may be due to its
geographical location, which is far from most of the other
major markets, small size of the market, and poor law and
order condition. Greb et al. (2012) found that rice market
pairs are less cointegrated than maize markets. They also
found that domestic prices adjust to international prices
for most agricultural commodities except rice. Contrary to
Greb et al. (2012), we find that Pakistan's domestic prices
for rice adjust to the international market; however, the
level of the adjustment is low.
The above results can be helpful in decision making
regarding allocation of resources by producers and inven-
tory holders as well as consumers. Producers and traders
can form forecasts of future price changes based on changes
in prices in the current and recent past period, and can
make their production and storage decisions accordingly.
Producers can allocate more resources to increase produc-
tion if they expect increases in prices, and vice versa, based
on the long-run price adjustment coefficient. Inventory
holders can form expectations based on the short-run coef-
ficients. They will store if they expect prices to increase in
the coming months, and vice versa. These production and
storage decisions can affect food security.
Summary and Conclusion
In this study, we have reported econometric results on whether
Pakistan's rice markets are integrated domestically and with
international markets, focusing on cointegration and the speed
of price adjustments. We investigate the effects of the change
in policy that took place in 2002; when Pakistan terminated its
support price policy and subsequently introduced export poli-
cies, export subsidy, and minimum export price policy.
The results from the EG and Johansen tests strongly
indicate that all the domestic markets are integrated, pos-
sibly excepting Hyderabad­Peshawar, Hyderabad­
Rawalpindi, Hyderabad­Multan, and Hyderabad­Quetta.
The VECM estimates of the domestic markets reveal that
Ahmad and Gjølberg 13
prices converge in the long run; however, the speed of
adjustment toward long-run equilibrium is generally low.
The adjustment coefficients vary from 0.02 to 0.22 across
various pairs of markets, indicating that about 2% to 22%
of the divergence from the long-run equilibrium is being
corrected monthly. The long-run coefficient varies from
0.89 to 1, revealing that about 90% to 100% of price
changes are transmitted across different pairs of the mar-
kets in the long run. The ending of the support price policy
seems to have resulted in an improvement in the integra-
tion of domestic markets as the number of non-integrated
market pairs decreased after 2002.
All the domestic markets in Pakistan appear to be integrated
with the international market possibly excepting Hyderabad
and Sukhar, although the speed of adjustment is rather slow.
The estimated coefficients of adjustments indicate that the
domestic markets tend to converge with the international mar-
ket in the long run, and about 3% to 11% of the divergence
from long-run equilibrium due to shocks in the international
market is corrected within a month. Slow adjustment may be
due to the existence of infrastructure deficiencies, slow
transportation, and trade rigidities. Government should
invest on infrastructure to improve the extend of market inte-
gration and speed up the process of adjustment toward long-
run equilibrium particularly in the province of Sindh, which is
the main production region and possesses low quality of infra-
structure with greater room for infrastructure development.
Government should act as watch dog and keep an eye on the
marketing system particularly on the role of market intermedi-
aries to avoid any malpractices that can affect the smooth func-
tioning and integration of markets, which can convey the
wrong signals to producers and can result in inefficient alloca-
tion of resources. The long-run elasticity of price transmission
ranges from 0.68 to 0.98 across markets, suggesting that 68%
to 98% of changes in the international price are transmitted to
domestic prices in the long run. Among the export markets for
rice, Pakistan's rice markets seem to be integrated with the
markets of Thailand and Vietnam.
The cointegration and VECM results suggest that while
domestic markets are integrated with, and responsive to,
changes in the international market and domestic markets,
responsiveness to own (local) shocks is higher although
exceptions exist. Producers and traders can form expecta-
tions of future changes in prices based on changes in
prices in the current and last period, and can make their
production and storage decisions accordingly.
Support price policy reforms have improved market
integration within Pakistan; however, they do not seem to
have affected the integration of Pakistan with the interna-
tional market, while export policies have reduced the extent
of market integration of Pakistan with the international
market. It is, therefore, reasonable to conclude that reduc-
ing government intervention in price determination would
increase international market integration further.

Notes
1. Since 2011, the Thai rice price has no longer been used as
an international reference price. After being elected in 2011,
Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra introduced substantial
subsidies to Thai rice farmers, causing Thai rice prices to
increase substantially above international prices.
2. Some further details can be found in Ahmad and Garcia
(2012).
3. International Rice Research Institute (IRRI6) and IRRI9 coarse
rice varieties were developed at the IRRI in the Philippines.
IRRI9 was developed by crossing the IRRI6 and Basmati rice
varieties.
