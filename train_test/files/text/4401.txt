Abstract
Objective: A retrospective cohort study to develop a classification scheme for abnormal vocal
cord movement (AVCM) before and after thyroid surgery.
Methods: Clinical and laryngoscopic data from patients who underwent partial or total
thyroidectomy were analysed. AVCM was classified as mild (type I), moderate (type II) or
severe (type III), according to laryngoscopic findings.
Results: The study included 1619 patients, of whom 39 had preoperative AVCM and 65 had
postoperative AVCM. Recovery rates for preoperative, postoperative and total type I AVCM were
higher than the corresponding type III AVCM. Recovery rates for total type II AVCM were higher
than those for type III AVCM at 1, 3 and 6 months postoperatively. Asymptomatic patients had
better recovery rates than symptomatic patients.
Conclusion: We have developed a useful classification system for patients with AVCM after
thyroidectomy. Pre- and postoperative laryngoscopy can identify asymptomatic AVCM and is
essential to evaluate the extent of recurrent laryngeal nerve injury in these patients.

Introduction
Thyroid surgery is a common procedure that
is frequently used to treat thyroid cancer,
goitre, and overactive thyroid.1,2 The most
common complications after thyroid sur-
gery include bleeding, hypoparathyroidism,
infection, recurrent laryngeal nerve injury

(RLNI) and hypothyroidism.3,4 Rare com-
plications, such as damage to the sympa-
thetic trunk, are occasionally reported,
although most can be avoided while per-
forming surgery.5
The reported rate of RLNI after thyroid
surgery ranges between 1.4% and 15%.6­8
RLNI symptoms may include postoperative
hoarseness and dysphonia, and can lead to
abnormal vocal cord movement (AVCM).
Bilateral RLNI may also be accompanied by
breathlessness and life-threatening upper
airway obstruction.9 These clinical manifest-
ations are often subacute. Generally, the
vocal fold initially remains in the parame-
dian position, and definite vocal changes
may develop over days or weeks.10 The
incidence of RLNI is highest during re-
explorations, Graves' disease or thyroid
carcinoma procedures.11,12 Injury can
occur as a result of stretch injury, pressure,
crush injury, electrocautery, suction trauma
or ischaemia,13,14 but it is difficult to deter-
mine the cause of RLNI during surgery as
these injuries are not visually discernible. To
reduce the incidence of RNLI, the anatom-
ical structure should be carefully assessed.
The integrity of the recurrent laryngeal
nerve can be guaranteed by careful identifi-
cation and assessment during the surgical
procedure, as visual identification may
decrease the risk of permanent nerve palsy
after thyroid surgery.15
Perioperative vocal fold paralysis can be
assessed using functional voice assessment
(via endoscopy) and vocal function assess-
ment (e.g., maximum phonation time, pitch
range, perceptual voice quality, etc.).16
There are no validated laryngoscopic stand-
ards available for vocal cord function assess-
ment after thyroidectomy, however. Such
standards would allow assessment of the
presence and extent of nerve damage, and
the risk of aspiration or respiratory com-
promise due to vocal cord impairment. The
aim of the present study was to develop a
new classification scheme for AVCM before
and after thyroid surgery. Such a scheme
could be used to evaluate the extent of pre-
and postoperative RLNI in patients with
thyroid disease, and predict the prognosis
of RLNI.
Patients and methods
Study population
This retrospective cohort study included all
patients (including those with vocal cord
dysfunction caused by thyroid disease) who
underwent partial or total thyroidectomy
and perioperative laryngoscopic examin-
ation at the Department of Thyroid
Surgery, China­Japan Union Hospital,
Changchun, China, between January 2010
and January 2011. Exclusion criteria were:
other vocal cord disease; laryngeal disease;
laryngeal surgery.
The study was approved by the institu-
tional review board of China­Japan Union
Hospital, Changchun, China, and all
patients (or their next-of-kin if aged <18
years) provided written informed consent.
IONM
In all patients, the recurrent laryngeal nerve
was exposed during thyroidectomy, and its
functional integrity was determined using
intraoperative neuromonitoring (IONM), as
described.11,17 The four-step IONM proced-
ure obtains electromagnetic signals from the
vagus nerve and recurrent laryngeal nerve
before and after resection of the thyroid
lobe. All IONM procedures were performed
by the same physician (J.X.).
Laryngoscopy
All patients underwent routine laryngo-
scopic examination to assess vocal cord
movement (VCM) before and 1 day after
surgery (ENF-P4 laryngoscope; Olympus,
Tokyo, Japan). All laryngoscopic exam-
inations were performed by the same
1030 Journal of International Medical Research 42(4)
physician (J.X.), and abnormal vocal cord
movements were confirmed by an experi-
enced otolaryngologist. Pre- and postopera-
tive laryngoscopy findings were compared.
Patients were stratified between three
groups: control (normal pre- and postopera-
tive findings); preoperative abnormal
(abnormal preoperative findings); and post-
operative abnormal (normal preoperative
but abnormal postoperative findings).
In the case of normal postoperative
laryngoscopy findings, no further examin-
ations were performed. In all other cases,
laryngoscopy was repeated at 7 days and 1, 3
and 6 months after surgery, or until normal
VCMs were observed (to a maximum of 1
year). Patients were considered to have
permanent vocal cord damage if their laryn-
goscopy findings were abnormal 6 months
after surgery. Patients with postoperative
AVCM were given standard treatment,
with intravenous dexamethasone and oral
vitamin B.
Recurrent laryngeal nerve monitoring
The NIMÕ II monitoring system
(Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN, USA) was
used to monitor, test and confirm visual
identification of the recurrent laryngeal
nerve. After its intraoperative visual
identification, the nerve stimulator settings
were 1 mA and 100 mV. Nerve testing was
repeated at the most distal part of the
dissected recurrent laryngeal nerve to the
entry point. The stimulus necessary to gen-
erate a response at the cricoarytenoid joint
and distal dissection was recorded for each
nerve. Vagal stimulation was performed
with a current of 1 mA after direct anatom-
ical exposure of the vagus nerve. Pathologi-
cal reports and information regarding
patients' pre- and postoperative vocal cord
mobility were reviewed and documented.
AVCM classification
Normal VCM was defined as bilaterally
symmetrical and fast, with normal ampli-
tude. AVCM was classified as mild (type I),
moderate (type II), or severe (type III),
based on laryngoscopic findings and neuro-
monitoring (Table 1).
Statistical analyses
Data were presented as n (%) and compared
using 2-test. Statistical analyses were per-
formed using SPSSÕ
version 16.0 (SPSS Inc.,
Chicago, IL, USA) for WindowsÕ. P-
values < 0.05 were considered statistically
significant.

Results
The study enrolled 1842 patients, of whom
223 were lost to follow-up due to lack of
subsequent laryngoscopic examinations.
The final analysis therefore included 1619
patients (374 male/1245 female; median age
46 years, age range 19­72 years). A total of
39 patients were stratified into the preopera-
tive abnormal group, 65 were stratified into
the postoperative abnormal group, and the
remaining 1515 patients were stratified into
the control group.
Patients presented with papillary thyroid
carcinoma of both lobes (n ¼ 218, 436 recur-
rent laryngeal nerves at risk) or a single lobe
(n ¼ 679, 679 recurrent laryngeal nerves at
risk); nodular goitre (n ¼ 624, 1248 recurrent
laryngeal nerves at risk); follicular adenoma
of both lobes (n ¼ 13, 26 recurrent laryngeal
nerves at risk) or a single lobe (n ¼ 40, 40
recurrent laryngeal nerves at risk); Hurthle
cell follicular adenoma (n ¼ 7, seven recur-
rent laryngeal nerves at risk); lymphocytic
thyroiditis (n ¼ 28, four recurrent laryngeal
nerves at risk); medullary thyroid carcinoma
(n ¼ 9, 18 recurrent laryngeal nerves at risk);
and primary squamous cell carcinoma of the
thyroid (n ¼ 1, two recurrent laryngeal
nerves at risk). In total, 2460 recurrent
laryngeal nerves were at risk. Demographic
and clinical data of the study population
stratified according to laryngoscopy findings
are given in Table 2.
The failure rate of IONM for detecting
functional integrity in the recurrent laryn-
geal nerve was 10.8% (175/1619) in the total
study population and 52.9% (55/104) in
patients with AVCM. In the 1515 patients
with normal VCM, 120 showed abnormal
signals during the operation, and 1395
patients showed normal signals. The use of
IONM for detecting functional integrity in
the recurrent laryngeal nerve detection had
sensitivity 47.1%, specificity 92.1%, positive
predictive value 29.0%, and negative
predictive value 96.2%.
Data regarding the clinical recovery of
patients with AVCM, stratified according to
classification, are given in Table 3. A sig-
nificantly higher percentage of patients with
preoperative type I AVCM recovered from
RLNI within 1 or 7 days after surgery than

27 [85.3%] and 27/27 [100%] vs 1/12 [8.3%]
and 1/12 [8.3%]; P < 0.001 for both com-
parisons). Of the 39 patients with preopera-
tive AVCM, 34 were asymptomatic.
A significantly higher percentage of asymp-
tomatic patients than symptomatic patients
recovered within 7 days (28/36 [77.8%] vs
0/5 [0%]; P ¼ 0.001). Of the 65 patients with
postoperative AVCM, 36 were asymptom-

patients than symptomatic patients recov-
ered within 7 days (28/36 [77.8%] vs 14/29
[48.3%]; P ¼ 0.013; Table 3).
Data regarding causes of and recovery
from AVCM are given in Table 4. The 7-day
recovery rate was significantly lower in
patients with postoperative type II AVCM
than in those with postoperative type I (8/12
[66.7%] vs 18/21 [85.7%]; P ¼ 0.198). In
addition, the 7-day and 1-month recovery
rates were significantly lower in patients
with postoperative type III AVCM than
those with postoperative type I AVCM
(16/32 [50.0%] vs 18/21 [85.7%]; P ¼ 0.008,
and 24/32 [75.0%] vs 21/21 [100%];
P ¼ 0.013, respectively). There were no sig-
nificant differences between postoperative
type II and postoperative type III AVCM
groups in 7-day or 1-month recovery rates.
The 7-day recovery rate of combined pre-
and postoperative type I AVCM was sig-
nificantly higher than that of combined
type II AVCM (93.8% vs 66.7%;
P ¼ 0.009) and combined type III AVCM
(38.6%; P < 0.001). There was no significant
difference in 7-day recovery rate between
combined type II and type III AVCM,
however. The recovery rate was significantly
higher in combined type II AVCM than
type III AVCM at 1 month (91.7%
vs 56.8%,;P ¼ 0.039), 3 months (100% vs
65.9%; P ¼ 0.024) and 6 months (100% vs
70.5%; P ¼ 0.049) postoperatively.
Discussion
The surgical management of thyroid disease
has markedly improved during the past
century.18 In the last 20 years, total thyr-
oidectomy has become the preferred option
for managing bilateral benign goitre,
Graves' disease and some thyroid cancers.

The recurrent laryngeal nerves may be
injured during thyroidectomy, however,19
due to complete or partial transection, trac-
tion, contusion, crush, burn, misplaced liga-
ture or compromised blood supply. RLNI is
generally unilateral and transient, but is
sometimes bilateral and permanent, causing
paralysis of the vocal cords or true vocal-
fold paresis.12,20 Surgeons can prevent per-
manent injury to the RLN during surgery by
identifying and carefully tracing the recur-
rent laryngeal nerve's path21 or using nerve-
monitoring devices, but the most effective
method for protecting the nerve remains
unclear. Although the incidence of perman-
ent recurrent laryngeal nerves paralysis
after thyroidectomy is relatively low
(0.2­2%)1,3,9, it remains an important com-
plication that may affect a patient's health-
related quality-of-life.

Perioperative laryngeal examinations are
necessary to determine RLN function, but
normal vocal quality does not ensure sym-
metrical VCM. The results of the current
study underline the importance of laryngos-
copy for visual identification of VCM.
Patients with preoperative type I AVCM
were at a high risk of developing RLNI
during surgery in the present study, but all
recovered within 7 days after surgery. Of the
patients with type III preoperative AVCM
in the current study, the vast majority had
RLN involvement due to cancer invasion
and none recovered from the injury. The
prognosis for patients with type I AVCM
was better than that for those with type III
AVCM. In addition, the majority (87.2%)
of patients in the present study with pre-
operative AVCM were asymptomatic.
Taken together, our findings indicate that
preoperative laryngoscopy is necessary in
patients undergoing thyroidectomy, in order
to identify the underlying cause of AVCM
and aid in determining prognosis.
Repeated laryngoscopic examination
may provide essential information regarding
AVCM recovery. Compared with day 1
findings, laryngoscopic findings were signifi-
cantly improved at day 7 after surgery in
patients with type I AVCM in the present
study. Recovery was slower in patients
with type II or III AVCM. Timely laryngo-
scopic examinations are therefore extremely
important for the assessment of type II and
type III patients.
The present finding that 87.2% of
patients with preoperative AVCM and
55.4% of those with laryngoscopically-
observed postoperative AVCM were asymp-
tomatic concurs with others who have sug-
gested that it is arbitrary to judge VCM
purely on the basis of clinical symp-
toms.22­25 We suggest that regular pre- and
postoperative laryngoscopic examinations
should be performed in all patients sched-
uled to undergo thyroid surgery, in order to
offer timely medical treatment, shorten
recovery time and improve the outcome of
patients with perioperative AVCM.
Asymptomatic patients with pre- or post-
operative AVCM had significantly better
outcomes than symptomatic patients, in the
present study. It is possible that RLNI was
less severe in asymptomatic patients than
symptomatic ones, resulting in more rapid
recovery. The presence of clinical symptoms
may therefore be an indicator of poor
outcome in patients with RLNI.
The present study is limited by the follow-
up schedule, since it was not possible to
determine precise recovery times for RLNI.
The relationship between recovery time
and RLN electrophysiological signals also
requires further investigation.
In conclusion, we have developed a useful
classification system for patients with RLNI
after thyroidectomy. Pre- and postoperative
laryngoscopy can identify asymptomatic
AVCM and is essential to evaluate the
extent of RLNI in these patients.
