Introduction
Archaeological studies in Nigeria have shown that its people
have, for millennia, exploited a wealth of mineral resources for
the production of stone and metal tools and pottery. Traditional
resource extraction and development continue into the 21st
century. We argue that increased knowledge and understanding
of this heritage can contribute to an alternative vision for
resource extraction and development in Nigeria (see Figure 1).
Nigerian metal- and clay-working traditions extend back in
time at least two and a half thousand years. For example, peo-
ple of the Nok culture created distinctive terra cotta figurines
more than 2,500 years ago and people at Igbo­Ukwu mined
copper alloys in the ninth century AD (B. Fagg, 1990; Shaw,
1970), while the identification and exploitation of mineral
resources such as tin ore on the Jos Plateau dates even earlier,
to approximately 900 BC (B. Fagg, 1946; W. Fagg, 1952). In
the 1970s, Shaw (1973) and Fraser (1975) reported the recov-
ery of bronze or brass objects in the Tada, Jebba, and Giragi
areas. Neaher (1976) has identified at least three centers of
metal working in Igbo land--Awka in Anambra State, Eha
Alumona in Nsukka, and Agulu Umana in Udi, Enugu State
used bronze/brass and iron in their metal works. Still other
studies have shown extensive exploitation of hematite ores for
iron smelting in Nsukka areas such as Opi, Orba, Umundu,
Nrobo, Lejja, and Obimo. In addition, archaeologists search-
ing for the sources of the Igbo­Ukwu bronze have discovered
early exploitation of lead and zinc at Enyigba Abakaliki and
copper in the Benue trough (Chikwendu, Craddock, Farquar,
Shaw, & Umeji, 1989; Chikwendu & Umeji, 1979; Craddock
et al., 1997; Onwuejeogwu & Onwuejeogwu, 1977).
The legacy of ancient resource extraction continues in the
present day. The archaeology of stone tool manufacture at
the Ugwuele-Uturu Okigwe illustrates early and extensive
exploitation of dolerite for the production of hand axes,
cleavers, picks, and flake tools, whereas modern people con-
tinue to quarry this outcrop for road construction gravel.
Similarly, people in Benin, Awka, Eha Alumona, Nsukka,
Agulu Umana, and Udi continue to cast bronze and brass
(Okpoko & Ibeanu, 1999).
Traditionally, stone tool production has been associated
with hunter-gatherer and early agricultural societies.
Archaeologists have long considered clay, and later metal
technology, to coincide with the formation of agricultural
societies with increased division of labor and intensified
exchange of goods and services. More recently, social
archaeologists have begun to highlight the roles that indi-
vidual men and women played in shaping their material
worlds through the use of such objects (Haaland, 1997).
Mineral objects of all kinds play a major role in the devel-
opment of states and kingdoms in Nigeria and elsewhere.
In this article, we attempt to use archaeological and ethno-
graphic data to identify the source extraction methods for
some of these raw materials in the past, and to examine how
failure to manage such resources has adversely affected tech-
nological and resource development in Nigeria. We begin
with a discussion of Nigeria's archaeological heritage of three
traditional resource types: stone, ceramic, and metal, espe-
cially iron. We include ethnographic examples illustrating the

Nigeria's Archaeological Heritage:
Resource Exploitation and Technology
Emeka E. Okonkwo1 and A. M. Ibeanu1
Abstract
People have exploited mineral resources for several reasons ranging from the production of metal and ceramic objects to
stone and wooden tools. Indigenous extraction and use of mineral resources for production of general goods among others
have continued unabated. In this article, archaeological and ethnographic data were used to identify extraction methods for
some of these raw materials in the past, and thus, examine how failure to manage such resources has adversely affected
technological and resource development in Nigeria

persistence of these technologies in the recent past and pres-
ent. We conclude with a discussion of some possible ramifi-
cations of Nigeria's production heritage on the course of its
current and future development (Figure 1).
Raw Material Sources
Humans have long made use of mineral resources--clay,
metal, and stone--to manufacture tools. Such resources
formed the raw material for hunting, farming, and other utili-
tarian implements, as well as symbolic objects imbued with
social or ritual powers. Ultimately, the need for more effi-
cient tools led to the exploitation of quality iron ores such as
hematite for the production of iron implements.
Stone Tool Production
Stone artifacts have been produced in Nigeria since the
Acheulian time (ca. 500,000-200,000 years; see Shaw, 1975).
For instance, in the Nok valley, stone hand axes, cleavers,
and picks were recovered from the sites of Mai-Idon Toro,
Pingell, and Nok. Also in the forest zone of south-eastern
Nigeria, a stone tool factory site was discovered in 1977 at
Ugwuele-Uturu Okigwe (Andah & Derefaka 1983; Anozie,
Chikwendu, & Umeji, 1978). However, the dating of
Acheulian tools/sites in Nigeria has been trailed by contro-
versies (Anozie, 1983; Clark, 1983; Allsworth-Jones, 1987;
Okafor, 1989).
Furthermore, stone tools have continued to be used in
many parts of Nigeria (plate 1). For example, Ibeanu (2000)
recently observed the use of a stone anvil and hammer by
Ugwuogu blacksmiths in Uturu Okigwe. In addition,
Okonkwo (2004) notes that in Sukur Kingdom, Adamawa
State, 18th-century grinding stones, basins, and mortar hol-
lows are still in use, thus demonstrating the persistence of the
technical tradition (David & Sterner, 1989).
Some materials, such as obsidian (not readily available)
lend themselves more easily to tool production than quartz/
quarzite, so Nigerian hunter-gatherers have long visited
remote quarries to gather quality raw materials for stone tool

making (Hodges, 1964). Such lithic resources are later recov-
ered at archaeological sites outside the source areas. Stone
tool technology, like all technologies, change over time.
These changes may be a response to environmental shifts. As
in many other parts of the world, stone tools in Nigeria can
be divided into two broad categories: flake tools and ground
or polished tools such as axes.
Flake tools, such as scrapers with limited working edge
were mostly used for the processing of hides and fibers for
use by humans. And perhaps, with increased and more
effective demand on resource exploitation, man opted for
more efficient and smoother cutting/digging tools--pol-
ished stone axes, which could be held with hand or hafted
on wood--thereby expanding the scope of man's subsis-
tence base such as incipient farming activities. In Nigeria,
most traditional agricultural tools seem to have taken cue
from stone tools. For instance, the iron knives, hoes, axes,
and picks have longer and sharper cutting edges compared
with the hunter-gatherer's digging sticks weighted with
bored stones.
Clay--Pottery Production
The earliest evidence of pottery production in Nigeria dates to
the fourth millennium BC in Rop Rockshelter (W. Fagg,
1972). To date, ceramic objects remain important in the
economic and socio-cultural life of Nigerian peoples.
ArchaeologicalandethnographicstudiesalikeshowNigerians
use traditional pottery for cooking and storage; they also play
a prominent role in religious ceremonies and rituals.Avariety
of pottery traditions exist within Nigeria, including terra cotta
discovered at Nok, and "potsherd pavements" found at Nok,
Daima, and Ife archaeological sites. Nrobo potters of Nsukka
area manufactured clay smoking pipes.
Despite the adverse impact of western colonialism on tra-
ditional art and craft, pottery has demonstrated some mea-
sure of resilience and adaptation (Fowowe, 2004; Ibeanu,
2000; Lioyd, 1953). For example, apart from the adaptation
of pottery forms, such as ornamental wares, the demand for
Ilorin black pots (Kashim, 2004) is still on the increase for
use in socio-cultural practices in parts of Igbo land, such as
title taking, traditional medicine, religious practices, and
marriage.
In parts of Igbo land, traditional pots not only serve utili-
tarian functions but also ceremonial, ritual, and status sym-
bols (Ibeanu, 1992, 2006). The above socio-cultural factors
such as title taking, traditional medicine, marriages, and rit-
ual practices help in no small way to continue to sustain the
production of traditional pottery wares in parts of Nigeria.
The Ilorin black pots were achieved as a result of the high
technical skills of traditional potters.
The production process requires getting a bigger pot with
perfectly round bottom as a mould. The mould is placed on the
ground at a balanced position and clay lumps are put together
gradually around the pot taking proper cognizance of even
thickness and smoothness. (Kashim, 2004, p. 63)
After allowing the base to be a little bit hardened, the
molding process continues on till the desired shape and size
is achieved (plate 2). "Are" (a sharp edged smooth pebble) is
used to make spiral decorations on the inner parts of the pot.
The pottery wares are smoothened with coconut shells or
leaves and fired in open fire. At a temperature of about 600
°C to 850 °C, the pots are removed from fire and dipped in a
heap of saw dust, which impacts carbonized effect on the
pots. Later, the hot pots are immersed in a big pot containing
liquid extracted from tree barks and bean pods. The contact
of the hot pottery wares with the black liquid produces a boil-
ing effect on the surface of the pots giving it a black shinning
effect characteristic of Ilorin pots. This type of pot is still
produced and used in Ilorin irrespective of the influx of
imported wares (plate 3 & 4).
Iron and Metal Production
The utilization of iron in the production of tools and orna-
ments seems to have occurred prior to or simultaneously with
other metal ores in Nigeria. Artifacts of iron and other metals
were recovered from the same archaeological level for the first
time at Daima site; thus, the transition from stone use to iron
was documented in Daima dated between 5 AD and 6 AD
(Connah, 1969). Unlike in northern Africa and Europe, which
had distinct Iron and Bronze Ages, the earliest evidence so far
for ore exploitation and smelting of iron and metal was dated
700 BC at Opi Nsukka and 500 BC in Taruga-Nok site,
whereas the earliest date for bronze artifacts recovered in

Nigeria is from Igbo­Ukwu sites dating to the 9th century AD
(Okafor, 1993; Shaw, 1970). The ores used for smelting at
these early sites were mined with simple tools or collected on
the surface from eroded ore bearing deposits found in different
parts of Nigeria.
Common ores for smelting at archaeological and contem-
porary ethnographic sites include hematite, limonite, magne-
tite, and hardpan occurring in bogs. For example, Sassoon
(1964) also observes that in Sukur Kingdom, magnetite is the
local source of ore for smelting. In Nsukka and Okigwe
areas, hematite ores were smelted in the past. Umeji (1985)
has observed that iron ores have traditionally been obtained
along the Nsukka­Okigwe escarpment.
The type of ores for smelting depends on the availability
and accessibility of the mineral resources in the environment
where the iron smelters live and work. However, the relative
ease of acquisition/abundance of iron ores explains why iron
objects were more numerous than copper artifacts, and may
also explain why iron smelting seem to have predated the
smelting and production of copper artifacts in Nigeria.

Furnace/smelting.Smelting involves the reduction of iron/
copper oxides (ores) to iron/metals. This is achieved by heat-
ing the ores with charcoal in an enclosed earthen chamber
known as furnace. Three types of furnaces have been noted
in parts of Nigeria: These include pit or bowl furnaces, dome
furnaces, and shaft furnaces (plate 5a-c).
The iron smelting tradition of Nigeria exemplifies the
Nigerian tradition of innovation; thus, the various types of
smelting furnaces observed in parts of Nigeria seem to sug-
gest improvement overtime in smelting technique culminat-
ing with the slag-tapping shaft furnace at the time of colonial
intervention. Besides, a lot of rituals are associated with the
iron workers/workshops and in some places iron workers
held very high social status in the society. In Ihube, Okigwe,
Ogadazu (a small earthen pot) that is located inside a black-
smith workshop is used to administer oath to people. It is a
general belief that the water in the Ogadazu ritual pot has the
potency to cure some ailments such as skin disease and swol-
len leg (Ibeanu & Okpoko, 1994). Another important point is
the bellows used in iron working, from fire to animal skin
covered bellows to rubber and now motorized bellows as
observed in some blacksmiths' workshops. Also, pottery
wares must have played significant roles in iron working
given the quantity of potsherds in smelting sites.
The pit furnace is made up of a simple, clay-lined pit, two
or more feet deep, and is the oldest furnace type noted in
Nsukka and Abakaliki as well as in Taruga-Nok (Anozie,
1979; Tylecote, 1975). The dome furnace was an improve-
ment on the earlier type because it has a superstructure with
a small opening on top for recharging allowing faster attain-
ment of higher temperature. Dome and pit furnaces alike
employ bellows to raise the temperature, and both produce
very heavy slag in Nsukka and Abakaliki areas, thereby indi-
cating perhaps their low efficiency in iron extraction. Both
require that slag be cooled with the iron bloom and then bro-
ken away and deposited on site, a process that leaves a dis-
tinctive archaeological signature. In the Yoruba village of
Ola-Igbi, a dome furnace continued to be used into the late
19th and early 20th centuries (Bellamy, 1904).
The 5- to 6-feet-tall chimney-shaped shaft furnace is the
most type of traditional furnace. Shaft furnaces feature a
slag-tapping devise, which draws the melted slag in the fur-
nace into a slag pit, and thus, creates an archaeological signa-
ture different from the other two.
Shaft furnaces continue to be employed in parts of Benue
and by the Berom people, as well as those of Sukur Kingdom.
They stand as an example of cultural resilience when smelt-
ing has gone into extinction in other parts of Nigeria. In
Nigerian antiquity, smelted iron was either hammered or cast
to produce tools and other objects. Casting techniques
include the use of open molds, piece molds (for solid cast-
ing), cire perdue (lost wax), and false core (hollow casting).
Discussion and Conclusion
We have tried foreground early successful attempts by
Nigerians of different ethnic groups to harness the mineral
resources available to them. In so doing, they added value to

the raw materials and used the finished products to meet their
own survival needs. The traditional skills and indigenous
knowledge of Nigeria's ethnic groups have been callously
left to fossilize in the archaeological record, and are ignored
in current attempts at economic planning. The Nigerian
nation today is bereft of her past "golden Age" so long as our
ancient heritage of resource extraction and production does
not inform the present and future development of the coun-
try. For example, to what extent have we integrated our
indigenous knowledge from different local industries to form
the bedrock of our industrial development strategies?
It is not always correct to blame our development set-
backs on western colonialism, especially if we are unable to
appreciate our own past technological breakthroughs. For
example, the analysis of the pig iron from the traditional
smelting furnace at Ola-Igbi village in Yoruba showed that
the iron produced there was actually steel iron with a very
low carbon content of 1.6%, and the blacksmiths of the area
were able to further refine the metal to reduce the carbon
contents to 1%. The smiths considered this locally produced
steel to be much stronger and more durable than the European
imported iron. But by the time of W. Fagg's (1952) visit, they
were using imported iron, even though they considered it an
inferior product (Bellamy, 1904).
Also, ethnographic studies inAgulu Umana in Udi, Enugu
State, observed people's creative skills in both iron smelting,
blacksmithing, and casting. As a result, their blacksmiths
were engaged by the colonial master in the iron foundry that
produced the railway sleepers. Craddock and Picton (1986)
noted the addition of lead to the Igbo­Ukwu copper alloys,
which made possible the complex casting of the Igbo­Ukwu
bronze artifacts. This mastery of the technical properties of
copper alloys by the Igbo­Ukwu traditional metallurgists has
not been seen anywhere else in the world.
No doubt, the European intervention adversely affected
the continued development of traditional skills in mineral
exploitations and other spheres of traditional technology in
part by bringing techniques that would add more economic
value to their investments returns. Successive Nigerian gov-
ernments have since failed to take advantage of the abundant
local skills for industrial development such as the colonial
masters. For example, the local blacksmiths and other crafts-
men were extensively used by the European colonialists in
the iron foundry for the Nigeria railway sleepers as well as in
the equipment and engine maintenance workshop at Ebute
Metta. It is the policy somersaults of Nigerian government,
which nipped such initiatives in the bud, that have since
allowed the technological development to stagnate. Thus,
Nigeria regrettably has remained a consumer rather than a
hybridization of technologies.
