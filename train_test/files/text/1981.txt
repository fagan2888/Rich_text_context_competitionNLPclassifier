Summary
Background and objectives It has been suggested that moderate reductions in estimated GFR (eGFR) among
older adults may not reflect chronic kidney disease (CKD).
Design, setting, participants, & measurements We examined age-specific (60, 60 to 69, 70 to 79, and 80
years) associations between eGFR level and six concurrent CKD complications among 30,528 participants
from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 1988 to 1994 and 1999 to 2006
(n  8242 from NHANES 2003 to 2006 for hyperparathyroidism). Complications included anemia (hemo-
globin 12 g/dl women, 13.5 g/dl men), acidosis (bicarbonate 22 mEq/L), hyperphosphatemia (phos-
phorus 4.5 mg/dl), hypoalbuminemia (albumin 3.5 mg/dl), hyperparathyroidism (intact parathyroid
hormone 70 pg/ml), and hypertension (systolic/diastolic BP 140/90 mmHg or antihypertensive use).
Results Among participants 80 years old, compared with those with estimated GFR (eGFR) 60 ml/min per
1.73 m2, the multivariable adjusted prevalence ratios (95% confidence interval) associated with eGFR levels of 45
to 59 and 45 ml/min per 1.73 m2 were 1.39 (1.11 to1.73) and 2.06 (1.59 to 2.67) for anemia, 1.33 (0.89 to 1.98)
and 2.47 (1.52 to 4.00) for acidosis, 1.11 (0.70 to 1.76) and 2.16 (1.36 to 3.42) for hyperphosphatemia, 2.04 (1.39 to
3.00) and 2.83 (1.76 to 4.53) for hyperparathyroidism and 1.09 (1.03 to 1.14), and 1.12 (1.05 to 1.19) for hyperten-
sion, respectively. Higher prevalence ratios for these complications at lower eGFR levels were also present at
younger ages. Reduced eGFR was associated with hypoalbuminemia only for adults 70.
Conclusions Reduced eGFR was associated with a higher prevalence of several concurrent CKD complica-
tions, regardless of age.

Introduction
The prevalence of moderate to severe chronic kid-
ney disease (CKD), defined as an estimated GFR
(eGFR) 60 ml/min per 1.73 m2, increases with age
(1). In the National Health and Nutrition Examina-
tion Survey (NHANES) 1999 to 2004, the prevalence
of reduced eGFR (60 ml/min per 1.73 m2) was
37.8% among participants more than 70 years old
(1). Importantly, for older adults, reduced eGFR has
been shown to be associated with higher rates of
mortality, cardiovascular disease, and geriatric con-
ditions such as functional decline, frailty, and cog-
nitive impairment (2­6).
Despite these data, some have suggested that re-
duced eGFR levels among older adults may not reflect
the presence of kidney disease, but instead may be a
normal age-related decline in GFR (7). Along these
lines, age-specific cut points for staging CKD in the
National Kidney Foundation Disease Outcomes Qual-
ity Initiative (NKF-KDOQI) guidelines have been pro-
posed (8). However, the use of age-specific cut points
for staging CKD remains controversial.
In the general population, eGFR levels 60 ml/min
per 1.73 m2 are associated with a higher prevalence of
concurrent CKD-related complications including ane-
mia, acidosis, hyperphosphatemia, hypoalbuminemia,
hyperparathyroidism, and hypertension (9­12). Deter-
mining whether an increased prevalence of these com-
plications is present with reduced eGFR among older
adults may help define the need for clinical evaluation
of CKD-related complications in this population (13).
Accordingly, we evaluated the age-specific association
between eGFR levels with six concurrent complications
of CKD among participants in the US National Health
and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES) con-
ducted in 1988 to 1994 and 1999 to 2006.

multistage, stratified clustered probability samples of the
US civilian noninstitutionalized population. The current
analysis used NHANES data from the 1988 to 1994 surveys
(conducted in two phases: 1988 to 1991 and 1991 to 1994)
and from the 1999 to 2006 surveys (conducted in four
phases: 1999 to 2000, 2001 to 2002, 2003 to 2004, and 2005 to
2006) (14). This analysis was limited to participants 20
years of age and older who completed a medical evalua-
tion in the NHANES mobile examination center (n 
39,316). After excluding those with missing serum creati-
nine, hemoglobin, bicarbonate, phosphorus, albumin, uri-
nary albumin, urinary creatinine, or BP measurements,
those who had eGFR 15 ml/min per 1.73 m2 or were
pregnant, 30,528 participants had complete data for the
analysis of the associations between eGFR and anemia,
acidosis, hyperphosphatemia, hypoalbuminemia, and hy-
pertension. Intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) was avail-
able in NHANES 2003 to 2004 and 2005 to 2006 only and
was analyzed for 8242 participants.
Data Collection
Age, gender, and race/ethnicity were obtained via self-
report. Participants who reported having smoked 100 or
more cigarettes during their lifetime were classified as
current smokers if they reported current smoking in
NHANES III or smoking "some days" or "most days" in
NHANES 1999 to 2006. Waist circumference was measured
midway between the lowest rib and the iliac crest with the
participant standing. Diabetes mellitus was defined by a
prior diagnosis, excluding during pregnancy, use of insu-
lin or oral hypoglycemic medication, fasting glucose 126
mg/dl or nonfasting glucose 200 mg/dl. C-reactive pro-
tein (CRP) was measured using a low-sensitivity assay in
NHANES III, whereas a high-sensitivity assay was used in
NHANES 1999 to 2006. CRP was categorized as 3, 3 to
10, and 10 mg/L.
Measures of Kidney Function
After recalibration of serum creatinine to standardized
measurements obtained from the Cleveland Clinic Re-
search Laboratory (15), eGFR was estimated using the
Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration
equation (16). eGFR was categorized as 60, 45 to 59, and
45 ml/min per 1.73 m2. Urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio
(ACR) was calculated from spot urine albumin and creat-
inine samples obtained during the medical examination.
Assessment of Concurrent CKD Complications
Six concurrent complications of CKD were studied. He-
moglobin was measured by Coulter Splus Jr. in NHANES
III and Beckman Coulter MAXM in NHANES 1999 to 2006.
Anemia was defined using National Kidney Foundation
guidelines as hemoglobin 12 g/dl for women and 13.5
g/dl for men (17). Bicarbonate, phosphate, and serum al-
bumin were assayed using Hitachi 737 in NHANES III,
Hitachi 704 in NHANES 1999 to 2006, and Beckman-Syn-
chron LX20 in the NHANES 2001 to 2006. Acidosis was
defined as serum bicarbonate 22 mEq/L. Hyperphos-
phatemia was defined as serum phosphate 4.5 mg/dl.
Hypoalbuminemia was defined as serum albumin 3.5
g/dl. Serum iPTH was measured at the University of
Washington, in Seattle, Washington, on an Elecsys 1010
autoanalyzer (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany),
using an electrochemiluminescent process. Hyperparathy-
roidism was defined as iPTH levels 70 pg/ml. To stan-
dardize the laboratory values across all of the phases of
NHANES, the age, gender, and race/ethnicity adjusted
mean level for hemoglobin, bicarbonate, phosphate, serum
albumin, and iPTH for participants 20 to 39 years old
without diabetes and hypertension, eGFR  60 ml/min
per 1.73 m2, and ACR 10 mg/g for each survey was
calculated. Differences from the value for NHANES 2005
to 2006 were then added to or subtracted from values for
the other NHANES phases. Standardized laboratory val-
ues were used for the main analyses, whereas nonstan-
dardized values were used in a sensitivity analysis. BP was
measured six times in NHANES III and three times in
NHANES 1999 to 2006. Using the average of all available
BP measurements, hypertension was defined as a systolic
BP 140 mmHg, diastolic BP 90 mmHg, or self-reported
use of antihypertensive medication.
Statistical Analyses
The NHANES study population characteristics and
prevalence of concurrent CKD complications were cal-
culated by age group (20 to 59, 60 to 69, 70 to 79, and 80
years of age). The crude prevalence of concurrent com-
plications was calculated by eGFR category (60, 45 to
59, and 45 ml/min per 1.73 m2) for each age group,
separately. Prevalence ratios for concurrent CKD com-
plications were calculated, adjusting for age, gender,
race/ethnicity, cigarette smoking, waist circumference,
diabetes mellitus, hypertension (except for the model
with hypertension as the outcome), ACR, and CRP. We
used prevalence ratios to determine the associations be-
tween eGFR level and concurrent CKD complications
given the cross-sectional data and high frequency of
events (18,19). Prevalence ratios are interpreted simi-
larly to odds ratios and relative risks. Formal tests for
multiplicative interactions were conducted by compar-
ing 2 [astctr] log likelihood in regression models in-
cluding the full population with and without interaction
terms (age group [astctr]level of eGFR). Analyses were
repeated using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease
(MDRD) Study equation to calculate eGFR and using
nonstandardized laboratory values.
Within age grouping, multivariable adjusted prevalence
ratios for each complication were calculated by eGFR mod-
eled as a continuous variable, using restricted quadratic
splines with knots at 30, 60, 90, and 120 ml/min per 1.73
m2. Analyses were performed incorporating the NHANES
sampling weights to obtain unbiased estimates using
SUDAAN version 10 (Research Triangle Institute, Research
Triangle Park, North Carolina) and R version 2.9.2 (R
Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria).
Sampling weights were combined across all survey phases
from NHANES 1988 to 2006. The SEs for all estimates were
obtained using the Taylor series (linearization) method
accounting for the complex, multistage recruitment of
NHANES participants.

Results
Participant Characteristics
Compared with individuals included in the present analyses,
those excluded were more likely to be women (63.5% versus
50.8% of those included) and non-Hispanic black (17.1% versus
10.2% of those included) and less likely to be non-Hispanic
white (66.1% versus 74.7% of those included). Differences be-
tween those excluded versus included were small with respect to
age (45.7 versus 45.5 years, respectively) and Mexican-American
race-ethnicity (10.1% versus 9.0%, respectively).
Of those included in the current analysis, participants 80
years and older were more likely than their counterparts in
the younger age groups to be women, non-Hispanic white,
and nonsmokers (Table 1). Additionally, systolic BP and
ACR levels were higher and eGFR levels were lower in the
older age groupings. Older age was also associated with a
higher prevalence of anemia, hyperparathyroidism, hy-
poalbuminemia, and hypertension. The prevalence of aci-
dosis and hyperphosphatemia was lower at older age.
Age-Specific Association of eGFR Categories and CKD
Complications
The unadjusted age-specific prevalence of concurrent
CKD complications by eGFR categories is displayed in
Figure 1. Among participants 80 years of age the preva-
lence of anemia, acidosis, hyperphosphatemia, hyperpara-
thyroidism, and hypertension increased progressively at
lower eGFR categories (Figure 1). The prevalence of hy-
poalbuminemia increased at lower eGFR categories only
among participants 70 years old. For participants 70
years of age, the unadjusted prevalence of hypoalbumine-
mia was lower among individuals with an eGFR 45 to 59
ml/min per 1.73 m2 compared with 60 ml/min per 1.73
m2 and was highest among those with eGFR 45 ml/min
per 1.73 m2.
Among participants 80 years of age, compared with
those with eGFR 60 ml/min per 1.73 m2, the multivari-
able adjusted prevalence ratios (95% confidence interval
[CI]) associated with eGFR levels of 45 to 59 ml/min per
1.73 m2 and 45 ml/min per 1.73 m2 were 1.39 (1.11 to
1.73) and 2.06 (1.59 to 2.67) for anemia, 1.33 (0.89 to 1.98)
and 2.47 (1.52 to 4.00) for acidosis, 1.11 (0.70 to 1.76) and
2.16 (1.36 to 3.42) for hyperphosphatemia, 0.39 (0.16 to 0.93)
and 1.15 (0.44 to 3.01) for hypoalbuminemia, 2.04 (1.39 to
3.00) and 2.83 (1.76 to 4.53) for hyperparathyroidism, and
1.09 (1.03 to 1.14) and 1.12 (1.05 to 1.19) for hypertension,
respectively (Table 2). A significant interaction between

age and eGFR was present for hypoalbuminemia (P-inter-
action 0.001) and hypertension (P-interaction  0.04) but
not the other complications studied (P-interaction 0.20).
Among participants 20 to 59 and 60 to 69 years, lower
eGFR levels were associated with increased multivariable
adjusted prevalence ratios for hypoalbuminemia. In con-
trast, among individuals 70 to 79 and 80 years old, an
eGFR of 45 to 59 ml/min per 1.73 m2 was associated with
lower prevalence of hypoalbuminemia than among partic-
ipants with eGFR 60 ml/min per 1.73 m2. Among par-
ticipants 80 years old, the prevalence ratios for hyperten-
sion were smaller when compared with younger
participants. Results were similar when analyses were re-
peated using the MDRD study equation and when non-
standardized laboratory values were used (data not
shown).
Age-Specific Association of eGFR Modeled as a
Continuous Variable and CKD Complications
With the exception of hypertension for adults 60 to 69
years of age, within each age group, increased multivari-
able adjusted prevalence ratios for each complication were
present at lower eGFR modeled as a continuous variable
(Supplemental Figures 1 to 6). A trend toward higher
prevalence ratios for anemia and hypoalbuminemia were
seen at higher eGFR. However, the confidence intervals for
these estimates were wide in the older age groupings.
Discussion
In the current analysis of a large US national cross-
sectional sample, reduced eGFR was associated with a
higher prevalence of several concurrent CKD complica-
tions regardless of age. When compared with individuals
with an eGFR 60 ml/min per 1.73 m2, a higher preva-
lence of concurrent CKD complications at eGFR 45 ml/
min per 1.73 m2 was present for anemia, acidosis, hyper-
phosphatemia, hyperparathyroidism, and hypertension.
Also, a higher prevalence of these complications was pres-
ent at an eGFR of 45 to 59 ml/min per 1.73 m2 even among
adults 80 years of age. Although previous studies have
established the associations of GFR level and the concur-
rent CKD complications studied herein, the current study
extends these findings to older adults.
Prior studies have reported a higher prevalence of ane-
mia, higher basal PTH levels, as well as a higher preva-
lence of hyperparathyroidism and hypertension among
older adults irrespective of kidney function (20­23). The
prevalence of hyperphosphatemia has been reported to be
less common at older ages (24,25). Similar to these reports,
in the current study a higher prevalence of anemia, hyper-
parathyroidism, and hypertension and a lower prevalence
of hyperphosphatemia was present in the older age
groups. Population-based data on chronic metabolic acido-
sis are limited. In contrast to one previous report (26), in
the current study, the prevalence of acidosis decreased
with age. Although this could potentially be explained by
the more common use of thiazide-type diuretics among
older adults, further research into the age-specific preva-
lence of chronic metabolic acidosis may be warranted.
Despite overall age-related changes in the prevalence of
these complications, at eGFR levels 45 ml/min per 1.73
m2, a higher prevalence of anemia, hyperphosphatemia,
acidosis, hyperparathyroidism, and hypertension was con-
sistently present for all age groups. These findings were
robust even after age-stratification and multivariable ad-
justment and thus are unlikely to be explained by the effect
of age alone. Furthermore, among participants 80 years

of age, eGFR 45 to 59 ml/min per 1.73 m2 was associated
with a higher prevalence of anemia, hyperparathyroidism,
and hypertension. Although not statistically significant,
similar trends were seen for acidosis and hyperphos-
phatemia among participants 80 years. When eGFR was
modeled as a continuous variable, with the exception of
hypertension among participants 60 to 69 years, similar
patterns of increased prevalence ratios for each complica-
tion were present at lower eGFR within each age group.
For participants 70 years of age there appeared to be a
stable prevalence of hyperphosphatemia at eGFR levels
below 45 ml/min per 1.73 m2.
In the current study, the overall prevalence of hypoalbu-
minemia was higher in the older age groups, but the asso-
ciation between reduced eGFR and hypoalbuminemia was
only seen among participants 70 years. Although serum
albumin is an indicator of visceral protein, serum concen-
trations are affected by other factors including rate of
synthesis, catabolism, and inflammation and may vary by
etiology of kidney disease and severity of proteinuria (27).
Thus, among older participants other factors such as sub-
clinical inflammation may be more strongly associated
with hypoalbuminemia than reduced eGFR (28). In addi-
tion, individuals with lower levels of creatinine produc-
tion, and thus higher eGFR, may also have lower serum
albumin. This may also explain the high prevalence of
hypoalbuminemia and anemia at higher eGFR levels when
modeled as a continuous variable (29). Prior studies have
shown adverse outcomes associated with high eGFR levels
and may reflect low muscle mass (30).
The importance of reduced eGFR, especially in the 45 to
59 ml/min per 1.73 m2 range, among older adults is con-
troversial (7). Prior studies have shown weaker associa-
tions between eGFR and adverse events and a lower cor-
relation between kidney function and evidence of
nephrosclerosis on renal biopsy among older adults
(31,32). However, more recent studies clearly demonstrate
that moderate reductions in eGFR are associated with ad-
verse outcomes and a disproportionately higher preva-
lence of frailty, cognitive impairment, and functional de-
cline (3,5,6). In meta-analyses conducted by the Chronic
Kidney Disease Prognosis Consortium of general popula-
tion and high-risk cohorts, eGFR 60 ml/min per 1.73 m2
was associated with increased all-cause and cardiovascular
mortality among adults 65 years of age as well as their
counterparts 65 years of age (33,34). Similarly, in the
population-based Reasons for Geographic and Racial Dif-
ferences in Stroke study, the association between reduced
eGFR and all-cause mortality was evaluated across narrow
age groups (i.e., 45 to 59, 60 to 69, 70 to 79, and 80 years)
(4). Higher rates of all-cause mortality at eGFR levels of 45
to 59 and 45 ml/min per 1.73 m2, compared with 60

ml/min per 1.73 m2, were present in all age groups includ-
ing individuals 80 years.
Findings from the current study add to the growing
evidence of the clinical importance of even moderate re-
ductions in eGFR among older adults. First, our findings,
together with previous reports of increased mortality and
other adverse outcomes, do not support using age-specific
cut points for CKD diagnosis and staging. Second, the
current findings suggest that clinical evaluation of concur-
rent CKD complications should be considered for all pa-
tients with reduced eGFR, regardless of their age. Recog-
nition of concurrent complications may be especially
important in older adults. Although CKD management in
general prioritizes slowing the progression of kidney dis-
ease to prevent ESRD, many older adults are unlikely to
have progressive disease (35). Among older adults with
reduced eGFR, the risk of ESRD may be less of a concern
than the risk of a hip fracture with subsequent functional
decline and nursing home placement. In addition to the
increased risk of fracture associated with reduced eGFR,
renal osteodystrophy, and acidosis-related bone turnover
(36), several concurrent CKD complications have been
shown to be associated with fall risk (37). Although an
association between acidosis and falls has not been directly
reported, uremic acidosis has also been shown to cause
muscle wasting, and muscle weakness predicts falls (38).
Whether or not treatment of these complications reduces
falls remains unknown. Further research is needed to bet-
ter determine how to prioritize outcomes among older
adults with reduced eGFR. Subsequent clinical trials that
include outcomes other than mortality and ESRD may be
necessary.
The findings from the present analyses should be inter-
preted within the context of known and potential limita-
tions. First, the cross-sectional design does not allow for
evaluation of temporal associations between reduced
eGFR and CKD complications. Among older adults, it is
possible that the complications studied may have preceded
kidney dysfunction and a causal relationship between re-
duced eGFR and CKD complications cannot be inferred
(39,40). Data on kidney function were available from a
one-time blood draw and misclassification is possible.
However, misclassification of those with normal kidney
function into the reduced GFR group would likely have
biased the results toward the null. There is also a possibil-
ity of survivor bias as reduced eGFR has been shown to be
associated with increased mortality (30). The current anal-
ysis was limited to community-dwelling adults and may
not reflect the experience of older adults residing in nurs-
ing homes. Associations of eGFR and some concurrent
complications, as well as interactions may not have been
statistically significant because of the low numbers of cases
in certain age strata, rather than the absence of true asso-
ciations. Despite this limitation, the patterns between
lower eGFR and a higher prevalence of CKD complications
were similar in magnitude within each age strata. Further-
more, the low numbers did not allow us to use a more
restricted reference group, which may be more appropriate
when examining associations with estimated GFR from
creatinine, especially in the elderly.
Conclusions
In conclusion, in a large, nationally representative sam-
ple of US adults, reduced eGFR was associated with a
higher prevalence of anemia, acidosis, hyperphos-
phatemia, hyperparathyroidism, and hypertension at all
ages, even among participants 80 years of age. These
findings suggest that clinical evaluation of concurrent CKD
complications should be considered for all patients with
reduced eGFR, regardless of age.
