Abstract
Objectives: We explore the association between a neighbourhood's ethnic com-
position and the foods and nutrients consumed by Mexican-Americans.
Design: Cross-sectional survey of a large national sample, from the Third National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (1988­94), was linked to the 1990 Census.
The outcomes were food frequencies and serum levels of micronutrients. The
variable of interest was percentage of Mexican-Americans at the census tract level.
Setting: United States.
Subjects: A total of 5306 Mexican-American men and women aged 17­90 years.
Results: Increased percentage of Mexican-Americans at the census tract level was
associated with less consumption of fruits, carrots, spinach/greens and broccoli
and with lower serum levels of Se, lycopene, a-carotene, vitamin C and folate. By
contrast, increased percentage of Mexican-Americans at the census tract level was
associated with more consumption of corn, tomatoes, hot red chilli peppers and
legumes such as beans, lentils or chickpeas.
Conclusions: An increased percentage of Mexican-Americans at the census tract
level was associated with less consumption of selective foods (e.g. some fruits,
broccoli) and low levels of serum Se or vitamin C, but it was associated with more
consumption of other foods (e.g. legumes, tomatoes, corn products) that may
have positive effects on health in this population.

Health
Assimilation and acculturation have long been recognized
as important though complex correlates of change in health
risk profiles of immigrants and the resulting ethnic popu-
lations(1,2). The standard model that dominates research on
acculturation and health suggests that new immigrant
populations typically have a set of risk profiles that are
distinctive from those of the population of the host society
in which they have settled. These differences may reflect a
combination of influences, including the maintenance of
culturally distinctive behaviours characteristic of the coun-
try of origin; the distinctive influences of the immigration
experience itself, including disruption of personal networks
and exposure to discrimination; and the correlation of
the decision to migrate across national boundaries with
distinctive personal characteristics. Time spent in the host
society ­ measured in years, and sometimes generations,
among the descendents of immigrants ­ tends to erode
these differences. Social epidemiologists frequently turn
to the variables of time and, where relevant, linguistic
change ­ the adoption of the language of the destination
society ­ as correlates of changes in social and behavioural
risk profiles away from those characteristic of the immi-
grant group itself, and towards those characteristic of
segments of the broader population of the country of
destination(1,3­5).
Recently, increased attention has been given in the
social epidemiology literature to the influence of the social-
spatial context of health. In particular, a growing literature
investigates variation in local social environments with
respect to variables such as quality of food supply, local
modelling of healthy diets and personal habits, stressful-
ness of daily living and encouragement of physical
activity(6­10). In the context of the social scientific study of
immigrant incorporation, this emphasis is concordant with
a well-documented relationship linking ethnic residential
enclaves with the maintenance and intergenerational trans-
mission of ethnic-specific cultures(11­13). Drawing on these
broader social science research findings, epidemiologists
have investigated the hypothesis that ethnic concentration
of immigrant-derived populations in neighbourhoods is

associated with the maintenance of group-specific social
behavioural practices that influence health outcomes.
The Mexican-American population of the USA provides
a particularly noteworthy case for the investigation of the
effects of residential concentration on health. Compared
with non-Hispanic whites, Mexican-Americans have lower
mortality rates from all causes, and from leading causes
including CVD and cancers at most common sites(13­18).
Mexican-American mortality rates are consistently reported
to be lower for immigrants than they are for Mexican-
Americans born in the USA(13,15,17­19). That mortality rates
are lower for a Mexican-American population that is
on average socio-economically disadvantaged has been
described as an epidemiological paradox(20,21).
One of the leading hypotheses about the better than
expected health and mortality outcomes for Mexican-
Americans, as well as the apparently poorer outcomes
for US-born Mexican-Americans compared with immi-
grants from Mexico, points to protective aspects of health-
related behaviours among immigrants, including healthier
diets, lower rates of smoking, substance and alcohol use,
and higher rates of physical activity(13,16,21,22). Indeed,
studies of acculturation have documented a relationship
between acculturation and less healthy lifestyles in the
Mexican origin population, although effects of accul-
turation are not entirely negative. Notably, both health-
care access and use of screening improves with greater
acculturation.
A small but growing number of studies have examined
the hypothesis that a high concentration of Mexican
populations in residential communities is associated with
better health outcomes. To date, results have been mixed.
Some studies report evidence of lower mortality, lower
chronic disease morbidity, better mental health and
higher self-rated health(23­31). Others report weak, con-
tradictory or null results(13,32,33).
In the present study we investigate the relationship
between ethnic residential concentration of Mexican-
Americans and dietary intake. Specifically, we investigate
the hypothesis that there is a strong relationship between
ethnic concentration, e.g. residence in a barrio commu-
nity, and types of foods consumed. This hypothesis has a
high degree of plausibility, because a high level of ethnic
concentration in a local community creates a context for
the supply of ethnic-specific food products and for the
modelling of dietary practices. The Mexican-American
population lives in very diverse residential settings, ran-
ging from homogeneous ethnic environments in near-
border areas in the south-west, to neighbourhoods
throughout the USA where they are highly integrated with
non-Hispanics. Do dietary practices among Mexican-
Americans in different neighbourhood settings differ in
ways that suggest that integration with other groups leads
to deterioration of dietary practices that help explain the
increasing rates of chronic disease prevalence among
more acculturated Hispanics?
Methods
Data source
The Third National Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey (NHANES III), a large US survey conducted from
1988 to 1994, is a major source of information on the
nutritional and health status of the US population aged
2 months or more(34). The strength of this survey is that
it used the same stratified multistage probability design
as previous National Health and Nutrition Examination
Surveys(34). Weights indicating the probability of being
sampled were assigned to each respondent, enabling
results to represent the US population for each group.
Mexican-Americans were over-sampled to produce sta-
tistically reliable health estimates for the largest ethnic
minority subgroup in the USA. The data were collected
via standardized questionnaires administered by health
professionals at participants' homes; standardized medi-
cal examinations by physicians, medical technicians and
other health professionals at the National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey mobile examination centres
(MEC); and laboratory tests on whole blood and sera.
Interviews were conducted in English and Spanish after
informed consents were obtained at the initial home
interview. The interviewer gave each person selected for
the survey a brochure which described the survey pro-
cedures using a question-and-answer format and inclu-
ded photographs of people being examined in the MEC
rooms. The final page of the brochure was a paper that
required the signature of each participant 18 years of
age and older(34,35). Response rates were high, 78 % com-
pleted both the home interview and the medical exam-
ination. To get the percentage of Mexican-Americans
at the census tract level, the NHANES III was merged
with the 1990 US Census data. To avoid any potential
identification of subjects, the merge of the NHANES III
public database(36) with neighbourhood data (US Census
Bureau, 1990)(37) was made by the National Center for
Health Statistics (NCHS) Research Data Center (Hyattsville,
MD, USA). We sent the statistical models needed for
our analyses and the NCHS remote system sent us back
the results. The study protocol was approved by the
University of Texas Medical Branch Institutional Review
Board.
Study sample
The sample for our analyses included 5306 Mexican-
American men and women aged 17­90 years who completed
both the home questionnaire and medical examination.
Measurements
The outcomes were food frequencies and serum levels
of nutrients.
Food frequencies were assessed by a 1-month quali-
tative FFQ(38,39). The NHANES III nutrient database for
individual foods is derived from the US Department of
2294 CA Reyes-Ortiz et al.

Agriculture's Survey Nutrient Database(39,40). To ensure
the accuracy of the nutrient contents of foods, substantial
care was taken to include a wide variety of traditional
Mexican foods (e.g. red chilli peppers)(41,42). The FFQ,
administered during the household interview, was used
to ask respondents about the average number of times
foods were eaten during the 1-month period preceding
the interview date. Frequencies of consumption of foods
from the following food groups were ascertained: fruits,
vegetables, grains and legumes.
Serum levels of nutrients have been shown to correlate
well with dietary intake of respective nutrients(43). The
micronutrients examined included those considered to
be of potential public health significance and thought to
decrease the risk of cancer or CVD(44­48). Serum levels of the
following nutrients were obtained: lycopene, Se, vitamin E,
vitamin D, vitamin A, vitamin C, vitamin B12
, folate, a-car-
otene and b-cryptoxanthin. Serum levels of nutrients were
determined by nutritional biochemistry. MEC collected
blood samples and used the following assay or instru-
mentation methods for laboratory assessments: `Quanta-
phase Folate' RIA Kit (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA,
USA) for folate; HPLC (Waters Corporation, Milford, MA,
USA) for vitamins A, C and E and carotenoids (lycopene,
a-carotene, b-cryptoxanthin); INCSTAR 25-OH-D RIA Kit
(INCSTAR, Stillwater, MN, USA) for vitamin D (25-hydroxy-
vitamin D3
); 125I-folic/57Co-B-12 for vitamin B12
; and
graphite furnace atomic absorption using Perkin­Elmer
model 3030 and 5100 instruments (Perkin­Elmer Co.,
Norwalk, CT, USA) for Se(34).
A measure of contextual acculturation, the percentage
of Mexican-Americans at the census tract level (a higher
percentage indicates more isolation or less integration
with other ethnic groups)(25) was used as a continuous
variable. Other variables were age (years, used as a
continuous variable) and gender (male and female).
Statistical analyses
All statistical analyses were carried out using the statistical
software packages SAS for Windows version 9?1 (SAS
Institute, Inc., Cary, NC, USA) and SUDAAN version 7?11
(Research Triangle Institute, Research Triangle Park, NC,
USA). All analyses incorporated sampling weights that
adjusted for unequal probabilities of selection. Because of
the complex survey design used in NHANES III, tradi-
tional methods of statistical analysis based on the
assumption of a simple random sample may not be reli-
able. Sample weights are needed to produce correct
estimates of population quantities. Other aspects of the
sample design (e.g. PSU (primary sampling units) pair-
ings) should be taken into account to obtain correct
standard errors and significance levels for hypothesis
testing(49,50). With continuous outcome variables, fre-
quency of foods (e.g. cereals, tomatoes) or serum levels
of nutrients (e.g. Se, lycopene), we used age- and gender-
adjusted linear regression analyses (REGRESS procedure)
to examine the independent association of the percentage
of Mexican-Americans at the census tract level with food
frequencies and serum levels of nutrients.
Results
The study population comprised 2682 Mexican-American
men (50?6 %) and 2624 women (49?4 %); 35 % of subjects
were aged 17­29 years, 29?2 % were aged 30­44 years,
13?5 % were aged 45­59 years, 17?5 % were aged 60­74
years and 4?8 % were 75 years of age and older. Age
group distributions did not differ by gender. Eighty-eight
per cent of subjects came from three of the four
US­Mexico border states: California, Texas and Arizona.
These states correspond to the south-west area of the USA
where the majority of Mexican-Americans reside.
Table 1 shows the multivariate linear regression ana-
lyses for the relationship between consumption of spe-
cific foods (more detailed description is provided in
the table) and percentage of Mexican-Americans at the
census tract level. It shows that increased percentage of
Mexican-Americans in the neighbourhood was associated
with less consumption of melons (unstandardized beta
coefficient (b) 5 21?21, SE 0.52, P 5 0?0266), any other
fruits (e.g. apples, bananas; b 5 24?57, SE 1.34,
P 5 0?0017), carrots (b 5 21?61, SE 0?70, P 5 0?0273),
spinach/greens (b 5 ­1?17, SE 0?27, P 5 0?0001) and
broccoli (b 5 ­1?84, SE 0?5, P , 0?0001). On the other
hand, increased percentage of Mexican-Americans in the
neighbourhood was associated with more consumption
of the group of fruits that included peaches, nectarines,
apricots, guava, mango and papaya (b 5 0?32, SE 0.68,
P 5 0?63). Although this association did not reach statis-
tical significance, it suggests that these fruits ­ especially
the traditional mango and papaya ­ may be important
diet components of high-density Mexican-American
neighbourhoods. By contrast, increased percentage of
Mexican-Americans in the neighbourhood was associated
with more consumption of corn products (b 5 11?12,
SE 2?98, P 5 0?0006), flour tortillas (b 5 7?17, SE 2?63,
P 5 0?0097), tomatoes (b 5 2?76, SE 0?94, P 5 0?0060), hot
red chilli peppers (b 5 4?05, SE 1?48, P 5 0?0097) and
legumes such as beans, lentils or chickpeas/garbanzos
(b 5 11?56, SE 1?81, P , 0?0001).
Table 2 shows the multivariate linear regression ana-
lyses for the relationship between serum levels of nutri-
ents and percentage of Mexican-Americans at the census
tract level. It shows that increased percentage of Mexican-
Americans at the census tract level was associated with
lower levels of lycopene (b 5 23?77, SE 0?62, P , 0?0001),
Se (b 5 24?99, SE 1?55, P 5 0?0033), vitamin C (b 5 20?10,
SE 0?03, P 5 0?0025) and folate (b 5 20?88, SE 0?33,
P 5 0?0117). Increased percentage of Mexican-Americans
at the census tract level was also associated with higher
levels of b-cryptoxanthin (b 5 1?53, SE 1?18, P 5 0?20) and

Discussion
In the present study, we focused on spatial aspects of
assimilation in relation to dietary quality using data from a
geo-coded NHANES III data set, where the characteristics
of tract populations from the 1990 census were attached
to individual records to investigate the relationship
between the social characteristics of tract populations
and nutrient profiles measured through self-reported
dietary recalls and measurement of serum nutrients. The
emphasis on spatial characteristics of residential com-
munities as a possible correlate of changes in nutrition is
consistent with a very old social science research finding
that residential concentration of immigrant and ethnic
populations serves to maintain ethnic-specific cultural
patterns(11,12). It is also consistent with a recent research
stream in epidemiology that investigates the socio-eco-
nomic characteristics of neighbourhoods of residence in
relation to health-related behaviours and health out-
comes(51). It also identifies a variable with a broad range
among Mexican-Americans, who are distributed across a
broad spectrum of residential environments, ranging from
a high degree of ethnic segregation in the border region
of Texas, to full integration with non-Hispanics in urban
and suburban communities throughout the USA(52).

been associated with lower risk of all-cause mortality using

Breast Cancer Detection Demonstration Project(54); and with
lower risk for CVD using data from the Physicians' Health
Study(55), the Nurses' Health Study(56,57), the Health Profes-
sionals' Follow-up Study(57,58) and the Framingham Nutrition
Studies(59). In addition, case­control and cohort studies
showed that vegetables and fruits have been associated with
reduction in the risk of some cancers including mouth and
pharynx, oesophagus, stomach, colon-rectum, larynx, lung,
breast (vegetables only), ovary (vegetables only), bladder
(fruits only) and kidney(60­62).
However, higher concentrations of Mexican-Americans
in a neighbourhood are correlated with poverty and
disadvantage; therefore, the pattern of low consumption
of some fruits (e.g. cherries, berries) and some vegetables
(e.g. broccoli) in our study may reflect unaffordable costs
for foods or lower availability in a neighbourhood food
environment(26). Indeed, in another study, Bodor et al.(63)
reported that greater fresh vegetable availability within
100 metres of residences was a positive predictor of
vegetable intake.
Studies of health and mortality patterns of Mexican-
Americans living in the USA have previously reported
greater longevity(13,17­19) and lower biological risk pro-
files(64) for Mexican-American immigrants residing in the
USA compared with non-Hispanic whites and US-born
Mexican-Americans. US-born Mexican-Americans appear
to have mortality rates and biological risk profiles similar to
or not much worse than those of non-Hispanic whites,
which some commentators appear to ascribe as unexpected
because of the much lower average socio-economic
status of US-born Mexican-Americans compared with
non-Hispanic whites.
The explanation of the lower mortality and better than
expected biological risk profiles of Mexican-Americans
remains a matter of investigation and debate. Recent
work has substantially removed data quality concerns
as the principal explanation of these patterns(19,65,66).
A second hypothesis suggests that the greater propensity
to immigrate of persons with better health may play a
leading role, although direct evidence for this hypothesis
remains weak. A third set of explanations points to
healthier socio-cultural risk profiles as a contributing
element. More nutritious diets for immigrants, lower rates
of smoking and substance use, and stronger social sup-
port, are frequently hypothesized to contribute to the
Mexican-American mortality advantage. These hypoth-
eses are concordant with evidence showing decreases in
the quality of diets and health-related behaviours with
increasing time and generation in the USA(1,39,67,68).
On the other hand, high consumption of legumes
(especially beans) and hot red chilli peppers may reflect
cultural preferences and more affordable foods for this
Mexican-American population(41,42). It has been reported
that dietary patterns are different and generally less healthy
for US-born compared with immigrant Mexican-Americans.
Dixon et al.(41) reported that US-born Mexican-Americans
consumed significantly more fat and less fibre and vitamins,
and were less likely to meet dietary guidelines than were
immigrant Mexican-Americans. Also, Guendelman and
Abrams(67) reported that first-generation Mexican-American
women had higher average intakes of protein, vitamins A
and C, folic acid and Ca than second-generation Mexican
women, whose nutrient intake resembles that of white non-
Hispanic women. Other studies have shown that accul-
turation to the US culture among Mexican-Americans was
associated with increased dietary fat and sugar along with
higher waist circumference and abdominal obesity(41,69­71).
A potential explanation on how acculturation affects diet
among Mexican-Americans is related to a higher food store
availability and consumption of fast food in inner-city
neighbourhoods(72,73). The consumption of these other
foods may influence the selection of a healthier diet profile
in our study population of Mexican-Americans.
So the question we asked was whether there was evi-
dence of dietary advantages in more rather than less
ethnically homogeneous Mexican-American communities
that could help explain lower rates of incidence and
mortality for some chronic diseases for Mexican-Amer-
icans as a population group. Therefore, consumption of
higher amounts of legumes (beans, lentils or chickpeas)
may protect the health of a population with high con-
centration of Mexican-Americans in the neighbourhood.
Indeed, consumption of higher amounts of legumes may
have a protective effect against cancer. Kolonel et al.(74)
reported that intake of legumes (whether total legumes,
soya foods specifically, or other legumes) was inversely
related to prostate cancer risk. Also, Correa(75) examined
data from forty-one countries and found a significant
inverse correlation between bean consumption and
mortality due to prostate, breast and colon cancer. In
other human or animal studies, high consumption of dry
beans has been associated with lower rates of myocardial
infarction among Costa Ricans or fewer colon adeno-
carcinomas among rats(76,77). These findings may be part
of the explanation why those Mexican-Americans living
in neighbourhoods with a high concentration of Mexican-
Americans exhibit lower cancer incidence or lower
overall mortality(25,26). In Mexico, common beans are the
second source of protein, carbohydrates, vitamins and
minerals after corn(78,79). Beans contain complex carbo-
hydrates and are rich in Mg, Cu and a-linoleic acid; these
components may improve insulin sensitivity and lipid
profiles(76). Beans are also an excellent source of non-
nutritive constituents such as fibre, protease inhibitors,
phytic acid, isoflavonoids, lignans and polyphenols
such as tannins. These compounds have antioxidant,
antimutagenic and anticarcinogenic activities and are also
free radical scavengers(78­82). In addition, capsaicin, the
major pungent ingredient in red peppers, decreases the
growth (e.g. inducing the apoptosis) of human and
in vitro prostate cancer cells(83), human leukaemic
cells(84), gastric(85) and hepatic carcinoma cells in vitro(86).

Finally, consumption of tomatoes has been found to have
protective cardiovascular effects, with potential protec-
tion for prostate, oesophagus, stomach, lung and breast
cancer(87­89).
One limitation of our study is the cross-sectional design
of the NHANES III, which prevented us from drawing
causal inferences. Dietary assessment tools also have
inherent limitations. A serum level of nutrients and
1-month qualitative FFQ are not representative of indivi-
dual nutrient intakes because of day-to-day variation in
food consumption. However, serum levels of nutrients
are an objective measure, and we included a proxy for
contextual acculturation ­ i.e. neighbourhood density
(percentage of Mexican-Americans at the census tract
level) ­ that may capture other contextual factors related
to the environment where Mexican-Americans live(25­28).
The NHANES III questionnaire does not distinguish
between traditional and non-traditional fruits (e.g. papaya
or mango v. apricots) or other foods (e.g. corn tortillas v.
corn muffins) among Mexican-Americans; this may lead
to biased estimations or underestimations of some tradi-
tional foods in this population. In addition, NHANES III
includes a mixed group of unprocessed-corn products
such as bread or muffins but, with the exception of corn
tortillas, does not include the consumption of processed-
corn and specifically masa products that are essential
foods in the diet of countries of Hispanic origin in the
Americas. Masa is used to make tortillas (or tortillas
chips), tamales, pozole, arepas and empanadas(90,91).
Masa is obtained after thermal-alkaline treatment, or a
nixtamalization process, of the corn kernels. It involves
lime-cooking (calcium hydroxide solution), followed by
steeping for 12­16 h, washing and stone-grinding the
corn grains to produce masa. Cooking the corn with lime
significantly increases its Ca (.700 %), P and Fe con-
tent(91). Ca from masa acquires great relevance because it
represents almost the only source of Ca in some Latin
American countries. Masa products provide an important
source of energy, proteins, dietary fibre, antioxidants and
nutrients such as phytochemicals and carotenoids (e.g.
lutein, zeaxanthin, b-cryptoxanthin)(92). However, lime-
cooking affects the amount of resistant starch and the
quality of protein. For example, the partial removal of the
pericarp or bran leads to finished products that are con-
sidered as semi-whole grain foods(92). Also, digestibility
of the protein is decreased slightly, possibly because
hydrophobic interactions, protein denaturation and cross-
linking of proteins occur during maize processing that
change the solubility of these components, which could
affect amino acid release during enzymatic digestion(93).
The Hispanic population is the largest minority group in
the USA, and Mexican-Americans constitute the majority of
this group. Isolated Mexican-American communities tend to
maintain many of their traditional foods; however, public
health campaigns are necessary not only to promote these
traditional foods but also to make accessible other essential
foods in their diet. On the other hand, more research is
needed to assess potential health-protective effects of
traditional Mexican-American foods such as avocados or
specific kind of beans (e.g. pinto, black).
In conclusion, an increased percentage of Mexican-
Americans at the census tract level was associated with
less consumption of selective or non-traditional foods
(e.g. some fruits such as melons, apples, berries; or
vegetables such as broccoli) and low levels of serum Se
and vitamin C, but it was associated with more con-
sumption of traditional foods such as corn products,
legumes (beans, lentils and chickpeas), tomatoes and hot
red chilli peppers. Thus, consumption of these traditional
foods may make a difference to the health risk profiles in
this population. Further studies are needed to determine
if other nutrients or foods (e.g. masa products) that were
not include in the data may influence dietary profiles in
high-density Mexican-American neighbourhoods. Also,
research is needed to explore whether unhealthier prac-
tices such as the consumption of fast foods or sedentary
lifestyles are common among isolated Mexican-American
neighbourhoods.
