The public health community faces numerous challenges in
measuring community preparedness and resilience. This
study aimed to identify existing measures of partnership,
self-sufficiency, and social connectedness, as well as gaps and
opportunities in the measurement of community preparedness
and resilience. To accomplish these aims, the study team
conducted a broad environmental scan to identify a list of
possible measures in these areas and then assessed these
measures using a set of standard criteria and feedback from key
informants. Results suggest that while there is great interest in
quantifying community preparedness, existing data have major
limitations. There is a need for more measures of organizational
and network activity and measures in the area of community
engagement and empowerment.
KEY WORDS: community resilience, measurement, preparedness
Over the last decade, emergency preparedness com-
munication campaigns and other interventions have
encouraged individual and family-level preparedness,
with messages emphasizing the benefits of house-
hold emergency preparedness kits. These messages
have helped raise some public awareness about dis-
aster readiness but, overall, have not resulted in sig-
nificant behavior change.1 In addition, as the number
and costs associated with disaster increase, communi-
ties, and not simply individual households, are chal-
lenged with making decisions about where to rebuild,
how to recover, and how to address readiness for the
next disaster. This recognition that whole community
must convene to develop integrated disaster plans and

prepare constituents for the magnitude and length of
response and recovery is evidenced in national plan-
ning documents that call for community resilience
and a heightened emphasis on community-level ca-
pacities and capabilities for disasters.2 For example,
the National Health Security Strategy asks communi-
ties to consider the extent to which they have strong
partnerships across government and nongovernmental
organizations.3 Other frameworks such as the National
Disaster Recovery Framework or Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention's (CDC's) Public Health Emer-
gency Preparedness Capabilities argue for community
capacity building, yet in all of these policy documents,
there is little information on the metrics that should or
could be used in monitoring and evaluating commu-
nity capacity or readiness.4,5
Disaster research suggests that there are several do-
mains that capture aspects of community-level pre-
paredness and serve as indicators of community
capacity.6 The ability of the community to collectively
marshal resources without external intervention is one
component (ie, self-sufficiency). Another is the com-
munity's ability to engage diverse stakeholder groups
in meaningful ways across the disaster continuum (ie,
strong partnerships). Finally, recent disasters (eg, Hur-
ricane Sandy, Newtown) underscore the value of so-
cial ties in supporting community recovery (ie, social
connectedness). In the following sections, we briefly
describe the research in each core area.
Individuals on the scene are often the "first respon-
ders" to an incident and are capable of mobilizing
quickly to prevent many negative impacts of disaster
(eg, injury or death)7-9; thus, fostering individual and
community self-sufficiency is key to minimizing the

public health impact of an event. Creating a more self-
sufficient population can maximize a community's abil-
ity to leverage local resources and help minimize the
deployment of external aid, in many instances.10 Indi-
vidual stockpiling and household emergency planning
efforts are measures of self-sufficiency at the individual
level, whereas postevent measures of requests for (and
deployment of) external assistance indicate whether a
community was self-sufficient. Current activities to in-
crease self-sufficiency can mitigate certain negative im-
pacts of disaster; therefore, measuring these activities
and actions could help emergency planners gauge the
level of resources that may be needed postdisaster and
prioritize which behaviors and activities to further in-
centivize.
Effective partnerships between and among govern-
mental and nongovernmental organizations (eg, re-
gional public health and health care coalitions) con-
tribute to the overall preparedness of a community
by maximizing participation in preparedness activities
and increasing the volume and diversity of resources
(by pooling them), including personnel, land resources,
and in-kind assets.11 Effective partnerships can also
help shore up critical infrastructure through memoran-
dums of agreement prior to a disaster.10 The National
Health Security Strategy underscores the need for part-
nerships in stating, "The actions required to fully
achieve community resilience are beyond the scope of a
single department, policy, or level of government."3 In
addition, the CDC's Public Health Cooperative Agree-
ment Performance Measures emphasize the impor-
tance of partnerships with 2 performance measures that
capture the extent to which a diversity of organizations
are involved in community preparedness and recovery
efforts.12 Measures that assess both the diversity of par-
ticipation, such as the CDC measures, and the quality of
the partnership can suggest where additional partners
need to be engaged as well as where existing partner-
ships need to be strengthened.
Social connectedness, or the interconnectivity of indi-
viduals and organizations in a community, contributes
to a community's overall preparedness.10 These per-
sonal and professional social networks can be ac-
cessed by individuals in need of information and real
or perceived social supports, as well as leveraged to
quickly mobilize needed resources after a disaster.13-15
Living in a community with strong social connect-
edness can improve survival chances and safety of
community residents during a disaster.16,17 Measur-
ing social connectedness could include assessments of
neighbor-to-neighbor connections, connections of in-
dividuals to organizations, or connections among key
service-providing organizations. Measuring both the
absence/presence of such networks as well as their
overall structure (eg, where are the key communicators
within these networks) can provide useful direction on
where to broaden the reach of emergency communica-
tions, how to leverage networks for information, and
who to engage in deeper partnership.
Despite the recognition that these 3 core areas are
critical to evaluating the state of community prepared-
ness, to date, very little progress has been made on
measurement. As with other areas of emergency pre-
paredness research, the infrequency of disasters makes
ongoing measure development challenging (eg, creat-
ing robust predictive models and distinguish variables
that drive readiness).2
Furthermore, inconsistent definitions of "commu-
nity" have also contributed to a lack of clarity about
how to bound and assess community readiness or
preparedness (eg, should measures be at the individ-
ual, household, organizational, or broader community
level; should individual or household measures be ag-
gregated to reflect resilience at the broader community
level; and how do you define community [eg, by zip
code, county]?)18 Finally, there is growing recognition
that concepts such as engagement and social connect-
edness are ambiguous and can be difficult to define and
operationalize among practitioners, making measure-
ment challenging for researchers.
To help address these challenges in measurement
and begin to set an agenda for future measure develop-
ment, this study aimed to identify existing measures of
partnership, self-sufficiency, and social connectedness,
as well as gaps and opportunities in the measurement
of community preparedness and resilience. To accom-
plish these aims, the study team conducted a broad en-
vironmental scan to identify a list of possible measures
in these areas and then assessed these measures using
a set of standard criteria and feedback from key infor-
mants. A list of measures identified through the envi-
ronmental scan and an assessment of their strengths
and weaknesses for use in planning and public report-
ing are described in the following text.
 Methods
To identify existing measures of partnership, self-
sufficiency, and social connectedness, first, we con-
ducted a broad environmental scan to identify a list of
all possible measures in these areas and then narrowed
the list of identified measures using a standard set of
evaluative criteria and feedback from stakeholders.
Environmental scan
We reviewed national survey instruments such as the
Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS)
survey,19 the National Health Interview Survey,20

and the Federal Emergency Management Agency's
(FEMA's) Citizen Corps survey,21 grant program guid-
ance (eg, Hospital Preparedness Program and Pub-
lic Health Emergency Program [PHEP] Cooperative
Agreements),12 Healthy People 2020 measures,22 peer-
reviewed and gray (organizational and practitioner)
literature, and Web sites of relevant agencies and orga-
nizations such as the CDC, Department of Housing and
Urban Development, and Red Cross. Published and
gray literature databases that were searched included
PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar, EMBASE, CINAHL,
and the New York Academy of Medicine's Grey Liter-
ature Report. As a final step, we reviewed all survey
instruments and reports listed in the FEMA's Disas-
ter Preparedness Surveys Database,23 which compiles
household, business, and school surveys that explore
individual or organizational preparedness. We used
the following keywords to guide our searches of the
literature: "(metric OR measure* OR instrument OR
indicator) AND (resilience OR partnership OR engage-
ment OR self-suffic * OR preparedness OR connected-
ness). Whileweprioritizedthepreparednessandhealth
literature, we also looked more broadly to identify
sources in other disciplines that may be applicable to
preparedness.
Although we mapped out 8 key domains of commu-
nity resilience in our previous work,10 we focused our
environmental scan on measures in the areas of self-
sufficiency, partnership (including the engagement of
individuals and organizations), and social connected-
ness. We reasoned that these were focus areas of both
the National Health Security Strategy (objective 1)3
and CDC's Community Preparedness Public Health
Emergency Preparedness Capability.5 In addition, these
domains can be measured at various levels, including
the individual level, organizational level, and/or wider
community level, thus illustrating the complexities re-
garding the appropriate unit of analysis in community
resilience. The domains of community resilience that
were not captured in this scan included population
wellness/well-being, access to care, quality, and effi-
ciency. We excluded these because they have not been
prioritized in recent policy documents. This may be the
case because these domains reflect even broader public
health goals outside the scope of traditional emergency
preparedness.
For the purposes of this exercise, we used the re-
search described earlier to define self-sufficiency as the
ability of individuals and communities to assume re-
sponsibility for their preparedness and limit requests
for outside assistance. Partnership refers to efforts both
to promote partnerships within and between gov-
ernment and nongovernmental organizations and to
promote civic engagement among individuals and or-
ganizations. Finally, social connectedness refers to the
connections between individuals and organizations
within a community that ensure access to critical re-
sources (eg, information, financial assistance) and pro-
mote mental health. Our search revealed more than 3-
dozen measures, many of which have not traditionally
been applied in a preparedness context.
Narrowing the list of measures
In the next phase of our scan, we sought to eliminate
from the list of measures the measures that were of
relatively poor quality and retain those that were of
the highest to moderate quality. To accomplish this, the
study team scored measures using 5 evaluative criteria:
(1) validity (ie, does the measure what is intended?); (2)
reliability (ie, are the data subjective or objective?); (3)
utility (ie, is the measure useful to stakeholders?); (4)
maturity (ie, has the measure been piloted or fielded?
Is it about to be retired?); and (5) feasibility (ie, does the
measure pose a reasonable burden for collection and
have the support needed to sustain it?). We chose the
top 25% of measures on the basis of total score, which
yielded a set of 8 measures across the 3 domains of
interest.
Next, we vetted these 8 most highly rated measures
with a convenience sample of 9 informants represent-
ing local and state health departments and the US De-
partment of Health and Human Services. These experts
were recruited from a group of the study team's profes-
sional contacts who regularly engage on topics related
to community resilience and preparedness. Informants
were invited to participate in 30-minute semistructured
interviews in which they were asked to review and
comment on the strengths and weaknesses of the mea-
sures. We probed the 5 evaluative criteria. We also
queried these informants about other measures that
may be missing, including data sources that have not
historically been considered for community prepared-
ness measurement but may, in fact, be relevant. We
reviewed interview notes for comments and recom-
mendations but did not apply traditional qualitative
data analysis techniques due to fact that exercise was
designed to solicit informal input rather than develop
or modify a theory or conceptual model.
 Results
We list and briefly describe the most robust measures
of self-sufficiency, partnership, and social connected-
ness. We also highlight publicly available information
on these measures (eg, baseline status if available)
as well as summarize informant comments regarding
their strengths and weaknesses.

Household Preparedness Is Not Enough  S73
Self-sufficiency
In the area of self-sufficiency, we identified 3 mea-
sures, all of which measure individual preparedness
behaviors. Two of the measures are from the FEMA's
Citizen Corps survey21 (% with a plan and % with
first aid training), and one is from the preparedness
module of CDC's BRFSS survey (% stockpiling specific
supplies).19 Informants mentioned that a major strength
of these measures is that they are pulled from national
surveys that have been fielded more than once in the
past decade; thus, baseline data--and in some cases,
data on trends--are available (Table 1). As such, they
are among the more mature, "reportable" indicators
of community resilience. One major limitation of the
BRFSS measure, however, is that the CDC no longer
plans to sponsor the preparedness module, so this ques-
tion will no longer be fielded by states in 2013. Thus,
this measure cannot be used to track progress toward
individual preparedness in coming years. In addition,
fewer than 18 states have fielded it 1 or more times
since 2006. Thus, the extent to which these data can
be used to tell a story about "national" preparedness
or preparedness at the community level is in ques-
tion. With BRFSS, it is not always possible to drill
down to the county level among the few states that
fielded the optional preparedness module at least once.
Also, community-level analyses are not even an op-
tion for FEMA/Citizen Corps data because fewer than
5000 people across the United States are surveyed each
time the instrument is fielded (3 separate times since
2003). Another major limitation of these measures is
that all fall at the individual or household level and
do not consider the self-sufficiency of organizations or
broader systems. Because they do not inventory these
organizational and system assets, these measures pro-
vide limited information about whether the broader
community is self-sufficient (ie, limited reliance on out-
side resources during and after a disaster).
Key informants further explained that there is some
controversy regarding survey questions on individu-
als' stockpiling and planning behaviors. For example,
simply having a detailed plan does not necessarily in-
dicate that household members have knowledge of the
plan's content or could follow its instructions in an
event.
Partnership
In the area of partnership and engagement, we identi-
fied a total of 3 measures. All of the measures are from
the CDC/PHEP and capture the activities of health de-
partments, rather than individuals or other govern-
mental or nongovernmental organizations. A major
strength of these measures is that they are well specified
in grant guidance, and they were vetted by numerous
experts. Also, data on performance will be provided by
all PHEP grantees across the United States, thereby pro-
viding a national snapshot. Nonetheless, because these
measures are new for fiscal year 2012, we do not cur-
rently have any data and cannot report baseline levels
of performance (Table 2). As described by informants,
another drawback of these measures is that they focus
exclusively on the activities of one major stakeholder
within the community, the local health department.
Because community resilience emphasizes a whole-
community approach,2 these measures are somewhat
limited.
Social connectedness
We identified 2 measures of individuals' ties to other
individuals in their communities including percent-
age of individuals who talk to their neighbors and

percentage who exchanged favors with their neighbors.
While these measures do not have an obvious link to
emergency preparedness in the traditional sense, key
informants argued that such measures of social con-
nectedness are crucial for a range of health outcomes
including ability to withstand and recover from an
incident. Because neighbors are often called upon to
support one another during an event (when exter-
nal assistance is not yet available) and are the true
"first responders," communities with strong neighbor-
to-neighbor connections will be more self-sufficient and
thus more resilient.
A major strength of both of these measures is that
they are from the US Census Bureau's Current Popu-
lation Survey (Table 3), a national survey of approx-
imately 150 000 individuals. This is a large enough
sample to conduct sophisticated statistical analyses, in
some cases at the local level.24
 Discussion
Our results suggest that while there is great inter-
est in quantifying community preparedness, exist-
ing data have major limitations. Robust indicators of
community preparedness are few in number, and even
when data are collected, the information may not al-
ways be tracked systematically to allow for both a na-
tional assessment and a localized picture to drive com-
munity planning.
At present, the strongest measures for the purposes
of public reporting and planning are the CDC/PHEP
community partnership measures. Data on these spe-
cific measures should be available in the next 12 to 18
months, although future analysis should explore the
association of these variables with real and exercised
responses. For many of the older measures, baseline
data are available; however, these measures are focused
exclusively on the activities of individuals. It is unclear
whether rolling up these data to the community level
(eg, % of individuals within a county) is a meaningful
predictor of community response and recovery capac-
ity. Furthermore, the social connectedness items from
the Current Population Survey have not been used in
the emergency preparedness context.
By cataloging measures of self-sufficiency, partner-
ship, and social connectedness, we revealed important
gaps, namely, the need for more measures of organiza-
tional and network activity and measures in the area
of community engagement and empowerment. There
are also no true capability measures within this set;
ideally, we should have a mix of both capacity and ca-
pability measures.25 While the CDC/PHEP community
partnership measures are strong because they capture
interactions that are occurring among numerous sec-
tors in the community, they are only measures of "who
is at the table" rather than measures of the strength,
effectiveness, or quality of those relationships. Once
these measures are tested across the United States by
PHEP awardees, the CDC should consider adding ad-
ditional measures that focus on how such relationships
are being leveraged to achieve preparedness outcomes.
Our results also suggest opportunities for how and
when community preparedness data are collected. For
example, we do not have clear expectations for what
communities can capture during a real-time event and
what preevent information could be in place to aid
that analysis. In addition, there are currently no sys-
tematic frameworks regarding how information on
community-level sufficiency, partnerships, and social
connectedness will guide intervention or trigger local
decisions about where to build community capacity.
The major limitations of our environmental scan in-
clude (1) lack of a systematic approach to identifying
nonhealth sources; (2) subjective approach to scoring
identified measures; and (3) use of a convenience sam-
ple of informants who represent only the health sector
rather than the full range of sectors engaged in commu-
nity preparedness efforts; however, to our knowledge,
this is the first study to undertake such an ambitious

Although public health practitioners and policy
makers can use the measures described here to be-
gin to quantify and assess trends on select aspects
of community preparedness and disaster resilience, a
great deal of additional work is necessary. Ongoing
measurement facilitates public reporting and account-
ability, as well as continuous quality improvement;
however, these purposes cannot be achieved unless
we develop new measures in areas where there are
gaps and test novel measures that have not historically
been applied to the preparedness context. We antici-
pate that quantifying resilience will be as complex as
achieving it.
