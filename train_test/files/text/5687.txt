Reluctant activists? The impact of
legislative and structural attempts of
surveillance on investigative journalism
Anthony Mills and Katharine Sarikakis
Abstract
If we accept that surveillance by the State and `sousveillance' by the media in Western democracies tend towards a
relative equilibrium, or `equiveillance' supported by the function of journalism as a watchdog and that the rule of law
largely protects fundamental freedoms, this paper argues that the act of `mutual watching' is undesired by the State and
comes at a very high cost to journalists. The combination of technological capacity, legislative change and antidemocratic
sentiments of the State, in the context of its willingness and ability to collect and process Big Data on an unprecedented
scale, disrupt the preconditions for a strong democracy based on free media and free citizens. This paper examines the
politics of investigative journalism under the conditions of dominance of the State by investigating the experiences of
journalists with surveillance. Our interviews with 48 journalists show that journalists are acutely aware of surveillance
and its noxious impact. Well beyond simple `watching' these experiences are remarkably similar in non-Western and
Western countries. Journalists are engaging increasingly with technological and other communities, as they aim to defend
journalism and their lives. Their activism is operationalised in three areas: (a) in reluctant often-fraught cooperation with
hacktivists, (b) in self-directed protection of communications and sources and (c) in not always willingly acting as
dissenters vis-a-vis the State. This paper explores the extent to which journalists consider equilibrium to be distorted,
and how they are countering any slide into subdued democracy.

Surveillance and journalism
One of the documents released by Edward Snowden
in 2013, destined for army intelligence, warned that
`journalists and reporters representing all types of
news media represent a potential threat to security',
adding: `Of specific concern are ``investigative journal-
ists'' who specialise in defence-related expose
´ s either for
profit or what they deem to be of the public interest'
(The Guardian, 2015a). This put in no uncertain terms
journalists as specific targets in a `surveillance web'
(Lyon, 2015: 24). While the surveillance of journalists
predates the modern surveillance society era, the
already-existing zealous willingness of State actors,
coupled with an unprecedented technological ability
to gather and analyse huge amounts of digital informa-
tion, or Big Data, represents an unparalleled threat to
watchdog journalists and their confidential sources,
including whistle-blowers, even in Western democracies.
In the current surveillance state climate, investigative
journalists are faced with the exponentially growing
challenge of securing (1) their communication with
each other, (2) their communication with sources
and (3) the sometimes-huge volumes of top-secret Big
Data they store and analyse to produce public interest
journalism.
In 2009 Dover and Goodman noted that sustained
academic analysis of the broader relationship between

the media and intelligence agencies has been thin.
Existing studies on agenda-building efforts by Western
intelligence agencies adopt a broader view of the ways in
which the government, the media, and citizens influence
each other's agendas (Bakir, 2013; Lang and Lang,
1981).
A mutually influencing dynamic is established through
leaks and official inquiries, news media using technology
and live dissemination capacities, and NGOs representing
civil society. However, the State's strategic actions include
spying on the media (Alwood, 2007), harassing and black-
listing journalists (Spaulding, 2009).
Spaulding observes that in climates involving the
targeting of dissent by the authorities, constitutional
rights are far from a guarantee against targeting and
blacklisting, and the curtailment of freedom of speech,
even for journalists. Not only `backward' democracies
or repressive regimes, but also Western democracies
engage actively in covert surveillance of journalists.
Andrejevic (2006) called post 11 September state
surveillance asymmetric amid a constant push by state
intelligence bodies to enhance their technological sur-
veillance capabilities, while at the same time intensify-
ing the secrecy within which they operate. He notes that
although the news media have reported on this asym-
metry, their doing so cannot be considered `reciprocal'
surveillance because for the most part it amounts to
underscoring `just how little we know about the gov-
ernment's use of new media technology to accumulate,
store, and sort information about citizens' (Andrejevic,
2006: 395). Troublingly in the view of Campbell and
Carlson (2002), subjects willingly participate in their
own surveillance, possibly due to a commodification
of privacy, in which its value as a human right is no
longer recognised but it is willingly compromised in
return for consumer benefits. Furthermore, the possi-
bility of opting out of such bartered-away privacy and
self-facilitation of consumer surveillance may in most
instances be illusory (Elmer, 2003). There is nonetheless
a growing willingness to organise monitoring of, and
resistance to, what Fernback (2013) calls networked
surveillance by actors such as Facebook. `These actions
are an attempt at equality and responsibility in a demo-
cratic society that disrupts the institutionalized power
of panoptic surveillance' (Fernback, 2013: 19).
`Sousveillance' or `surveillance from below'
(Fernback, 2013; Ganascia, 2010; Mann and Ferenbok,
2013) and its interplay with the media and politico-
strategic communication has evolved rapidly (Bakir,
2010), tending ­ at least in Western democracies ­
towards a form of equiveillance (Mann et al., 2006), an
uneasy constantly threatened balance between the sur-
veillors and the surveilled, who make use of easily access-
ible rapidly evolving citizen media surveillance
technology. Sousveillance has been facilitated through
the variegation and innovation of news production net-
works and platforms, as well as through the increased
emergence of social media and whistleblowing sites
(Bakir, 2015). Ganascia (2010) highlights the fact that
developments in sousveillance technology have fused
the hitherto more separate realms of private and public
sphere.
The ways in which surveillance developments relate
specifically to journalism and in particular investigative
journalism in its watchdog role is an understudied area.
There is little known in academic work on the effects of
attempts at `mutual watching' that digital whistle-
blowers and WikiLeaks engage in, for journalism as a
watchdog. An examination of the ways in which news
media are reacting to counter the effects of such sur-
veillance, legislation and efforts at manipulation or how
they might seek equiveillance, as described by Mann
et al. (2006), is also necessary. Even how journalists
are using advances in technology, such as encryption
and other secure forms of communication, and means
of countering surveillance is rather under-researched.
Mann et al. (2003) describe, in more general terms,
the turning against, or `detournement' of surveillance
techniques, by the surveilled against the surveillors as
reflectionism, but do not make the case specifically for
journalists. Bakir (2015) highlights this paucity of
research, noting that only a fraction of academic journal
articles deal with the interplay between intelligence agen-
cies' agenda-setting and journalism. Bakir explores
the ways in which mass surveillance impacts on the
democratic process and the media, including the erosion
of the watchdog role of the media, and the weakening of
democracy as a whole, particularly in conjunction with
other restrictive legislation linked to national security
(Bakir, 2015).
Following the outline of relevant, limited, scholar-
ship and after a description of methodological con-
cerns, this paper reports on the findings deriving from
in depth interviews with journalists with regard to these
under-studied questions. In this vein, this research is
problem-driven but with the aim to provide impetus
towards further theoretical development and analysis
of the factors shaping communicative environments
within which a `watchdog' philosophy of investigative
journalism is crucial for democracy.
Methodology
Problem-driven research begins with a diagnosis and evi-
dence of a particular difficulty impeding a social relation.
In this case, the issue at stake is the degree to which
journalism as the so-called fourth estate may be dis/
enabled to fulfil its function, and whether media govern-
ance within democratic environments enables a watch-
dog journalism in the age of surveillance marked
2 Big Data & Society
by unprecedented Big Data retention capacities, in terms
both of legislation and technology. Problem-driven
research is associated with solution-aimed research. This
is often the case, although solution must not be assumed
to be a prescription for concrete practices necessarily.
We apply a non-reductionist critical approach to under-
stand and map the array of influences experienced in
the everyday practice of journalism, when it involves
the investigation of uncomfortable questions and sen-
sitive issues. We do so, by taking as our departing point
the well-documented fears of and criticisms against
the capacity and practice of mass surveillance over citi-
zens and journalists. The treatment of whistle-blowers,
such as Julian Assange, Edward Snowden, Chelsea
Manning, and Antoine Deltour and Raphael Halet,
of LuxLeaks (Reuters, 2016a, 2016b; The Guardian,
2015b, 2016a), as front people of the freedom of infor-
mation movement, by the State has been punitive.
We gathered evidence in three stages: the first stage is
the identification of possible impediments to freedom of
imparting information due to surveillance. Existing
academic and other writings and reports allowed us
to identify an array of possibilities of interference as
well as counteraction. Second, we identified journalists
who fulfil the following characteristics: they are known
for their investigative work; have 10 years' experience
in the field or more; engage in international topics;
work with major media companies. We aimed to
ensure and capture experience and knowledge in inves-
tigative journalism of a `before' and `after' picture of
surveillance. Almost all of our subjects are also either
staff members of, or have close ties to, major media
companies, and/or stable employment conditions
to the degree that these are achievable under the finan-
cial crisis, hence they can rely on the relative security
necessary to pursue investigative work. We interviewed
51 individuals, 42 of whom are journalists (US: 7;
Germany: 5; Austria: 5; Hungary: 3; UK: 3; Greece 4;
Turkey: 3; France: 2; Morocco: 1; Netherlands: 1; Syria:
1; Lebanon: 1; Russia: 1; Iran: 1; Egypt: 1; Italy: 1;
Zimbabwe: 1; Poland: 1), working in print, broadcast
and online. We interviewed eight media experts, includ-
ing former journalists, active in media research/advocacy
for NGOs and a university (Poland: 3; Hungary: 2; UK:
1; US: 1; Serbia: 1). Two of the journalists we inter-
viewed also have experience of media advocacy for an
NGO. Finally, we also interviewed one whistle-blower.
The selection of interviewees was a combination of
accessibility and an effort to include journalists based
in countries with varying degrees of freedom. The coun-
tries referred to span rankings in the Reporters without
Borders (2016) World Press Freedom Index from 2
(The Netherlands) to 177 (Syria), and scoring from 11
(The Netherlands) to 90 (Iran) on the `Freedom of the
Press 2016' index (Freedom House, 2016).
We ceased to conduct interviews when we reached
saturation of responses. Our aim was to explore the
views and strategies of journalists in the current climate
of mass surveillance, whether effective or not, and in
relation to the future of journalism. Interviews lasted
between 15 minutes and two hours and took place not
only in private or public physical spaces, but also online
and by phone. In some cases, interview appointments
were arranged without electronic means and/or on
some occasions mobile telephones were not present,
i.e. carried by the researchers or the interviewee. We
used online technology that is argued to provide some
basic protection of privacy. Our data analysis is based
on inductively identifying themes as they emerged from
the discussions with journalists. Interviews were semi-
structured with the aim to allow professionals them-
selves to identify core issues with surveillance and
to speak of coping and their tactics of resistance.
We aimed at addressing a comprehensive universe of
factors from technology to media organisation, and
from personal views to professional judgements with
regard to the profession and democracy. Hence we fol-
lowed ground theory practices to allow the data to
speak for itself, but starting from the basic categories
of enquiry. Further, we sought to identify patterns,
connections and divergence among the responses and
connect those back to the political, economic and insti-
tutional dimensions of the journalistic environment(s).
Here, we use only those names and quotes for which we
were given permission but also draw upon information
given by the anonymised subjects.
Legislative pressure
In recent years, the immediate aftermath of terror
attacks in the USA in 2001 and later in Madrid,
London, Paris and Brussels have brought about a
public discourse ready to compromise on fundamental
rights in the name of security, enhanced through new
legislation that has enshrined in law the right of State
actors to gather and analyse enormous amounts of
communications data. The Patriot Act, passed just six
weeks after 11 September, facilitated spying on ordin-
ary American citizens through surveillance of phone
and email communication, of bank and credit card rec-
ords, and of Internet activity (American Civil Liberties
Union, 2016). Lyon (2003) noted that `responses to
9/11 are serving to speed up and spread out such
surveillance in ways that bode ill for democracy, per-
sonal liberties, social trust and mutual care' (p. 6).
The Snowden revelations in 2013 subsequently
showed the degree to which secretive mass surveillance
of huge numbers of innocent American citizens had
been conducted by the NSA for years, including the
systematic gathering of phone records of tens of
Mills and Sarikakis 3
millions of people, and the routine, direct tapping into the
servers of nine US Internet companies including Google,
Facebook and Microsoft (BBC, 2014). Meanwhile, the
Foreign Intelligence Surveillance court, tasked with
approving requests for surveillance of a foreign subject,
in which the communications of US citizens may be
caught up, meets in secret (The Guardian, 2015c).
Metadata surveillance coupled with unprecedented
technological surveillance analysis capacities make it
far easier to identify journalists' sources. Maybe that
is the reason why under the administration of US
President Barack Obama, there have already been
more prosecutions of whistle-blowers and leakers than
under all previous presidential administrations com-
bined (Foreign Policy, 2013).
A series of legislative changes across mature democ-
racies aim to cement and normalise the state of surveil-
lance over communication by assigning such powers to a
range of institutions and without the necessary oversight
of the judicial system. In a 2015 report, the Council
of Europe's commissioner for human rights, Nils
Muiz
 nieks, noted that democratic oversight of national
security services in Europe remains `largely ineffective'
(Council of Europe, 2015a). In the US, in May 2016, it
emerged during a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing
that government representatives did not know how
many Americans have been affected by a secretive sur-
veillance programme (Electronic Frontier Foundation,
2016).
The common threads of these laws are the enlarge-
ment of the State and the restriction of individuals
through increased mass surveillance; gathering of moni-
toring data; restrictions to information dissemination
for journalists and citizens. We are currently witnessing
the fundamental and gradual redrafting of fundamental
freedoms, such as privacy and the freedom to access
and impart information.
In the UK, the proposed Investigatory Powers Bill
allows for increased, disproportionate surveillance
by police, security services and other state entities with-
out sufficient oversight (The Guardian, 2016b).
Opposition politicians, journalists and human rights
observers have warned that the proposed Bill threatens
journalistic secrecy.
In Germany, treason legislation has recently been
used against journalists who divulged national security
information provided by a confidential source. Spain's
new Citizens Security Law, also referred to as the gag-
ging law, outlaws `the unauthorised use of images of
police officers that might jeopardise their or their fam-
ily's safety or that of protected facilities or police oper-
ations' (The Guardian, 2015d).
In France, surveillance law no. 2015-912 of 24 July
2015 grants powers to the security services to monitor
the phone and Internet activity of anyone suspected of
links to terrorism, without the need for judicial approval
(Re/code, 2015). In addition, the law requires Internet
companies to install `black boxes' that suck up, for ana-
lysis, metadata of huge numbers of Internet users in
France. A flexible definition of `link to terrorism' could
see the communication of journalists directly targeted.
Draft legislation for new Dutch surveillance laws
provides security services with broad powers to inter-
cept Internet data, in a move the Dutch Human Rights
Commission branded `a major infringement of the right
to privacy and secret communications' (Irish Times,
2016). Hungary's 2011 anti-terror surveillance legisla-
tion, meanwhile, was found in early 2016 by the
European Court of Human Rights to be a violation
of European privacy law.
In Poland new surveillance legislation, in particular
increased intelligence agency access to data, and a
loosening of controls on police surveillance are central
to fears about a broad slide towards illiberal democracy
reminiscent of that in Hungary (Reuters, 2016c).
Across the world, surveillance legislation is being
drafted in the name of combating terrorism and enhan-
cing security (Council of Europe, 2015b). A core
common threat of all such legislation is the increased
space, with insufficient transparency and oversight, for
State actors to disproportionately gather and analyse
communications data of citizens. The authority of
national citizens is being potentially eroded, through a
reconfiguration of the notions of privacy, secrecy, com-
munication and even democracy, by a `new nobility of
intelligence agencies operating in an increasingly autono-
mous transnational arena' (Bauman et al., 2014: 126).
This new nobility is unlikely to see its primary objective
as the securing of democracy regardless of what polit-
icians may say: `the old suspicion that agencies claiming
to secure our life and well-being often turn out to be
extremely dangerous retains considerable wisdom'
(Bauman et al., 2014: 134). Bauman et al. (2014) argue
that Western democracies are not (yet) on the verge of
totalitarianism, but the focus on more intrusive, wide-
spread surveillance and invasions of privacy in the name
of security constitute a threat of the kind seen in
undemocratic states to entrenched liberties ­ among
them the right of a free press to hold public officials,
including those who operate intelligence agencies, to
account. This reconfiguration, which security agencies
highlight in particular after terrorist attacks, elevates
`security' as a primary concern. `What used to be under-
stood as authoritarian options are made to seem desir-
able, even natural' (Bauman et al., 2014: 137).
The experiences of surveillance
In Western democracies, which now constitute a `sur-
veillance society' (Lyon, 2015: 28), journalists tend not
4 Big Data & Society
to face the same kind of physical risks as those in repres-
sive regimes, but the aim and act of intimidation through
surveillance is a commonality with non-Western coun-
tries. Our interviewees listed frequent undue delays and
harassment when travelling through airports; threat of
prosecution under secrecy, treason or espionage laws;
physical or online intrusion, signalling the presence of
surveillance and the disregard of rights to freedom of
movement, to information, privacy and dignity.
Inhibiting freedom of movement
For months after he interviewed Snowden in Hong
Kong, Guardian journalist Ewan MacAskill (interview,
2 March 2016) was pulled out of the passport line every
time he left the UK through Heathrow airport:
`They would say, ``Your passport's been lost.'' I said,
``Well, it's not lost, I haven't reported it lost.'' And then
next time: ``Your passport's been stolen.'' I said, ``It's
not been stolen'' . . . Every time it was a different
reason.' Then-Guardian journalist James Ball (now
with Buzzfeed News UK) (interview, 2 March 2016),
who was also on the Snowden reporting team, had
`constant aggravation' entering the US in the months
after the Snowden story broke: `Every time I flew
through I would get a full bag search and then second-
ary security screening.
Italian journalist Stefania Maurizi (interview,
12 March 2016), who covered both WikiLeaks and
Snowden for the Italian weekly L'Espresso, was har-
assed while transiting an airport [in Italy], where she
was singled out for secondary screening after being
paged on the airport loudspeaker system.
`People who have decided to work in this field know
that the next time they go to the States it can happen
that they are thoroughly searched and that all their
electronic devices will be taken . . . and so on. And this
could also happen in London Heathrow,' says Michael
Sontheimer (interview, 15 March 2016), who coordi-
nated Der Spiegel's Snowden coverage.
Deliberate intrusion and surveillance signalling
Unmarked vans were parked outside the homes of jour-
nalists who covered the Snowden story (Luke Harding,
interview, 29 February 2016). The Guardian was forced
to destroy the hard drives of computers used in its
reporting with pneumatic drills and sledge hammers in
the basement under the watch of two note- and photo-
graph-taking security officials from The Government
Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) ­ one of
whom allegedly said: `We can call off the helicopters'
(Reuters, 2013). Luke Harding, who was also on the
Guardian's Snowden reporting team, says the computer
destruction incident `was Stasi, because. . . what
democratic government forces a national newspaper to
destroy their computers?'
He recalls as well: `There were trucks that would roll
up outside The Guardian's offices and outside her
(then-Guardian US editor Janine Gibson) home.
I had some strange encounters in Rio . . . when I met
Glenn (Greenwald) we had to move location about
three or four times because suddenly a whole host of
people were kind of eavesdropping on us . . . These
unpromising young men would suddenly sit with their
backs to us. Subsequently I was more or less propos-
itioned by someone who looked like CIA central cast-
ing in the lobby of my hotel, a guy . . . suggesting we
should go sightseeing together.'
A month later, when Harding was writing his book
about the Snowden affair, the noticeable surveillance
took a bizarre turn: `At certain points in the
text . . . someone would start remotely deleting the text.'
Maurizi was also targeted with `aggressive', intimi-
dating overt physical surveillance during the Snowden
coverage, in a public park where she was meeting a
high-level source in the late afternoon in Berlin. And
Sontheimer says: `One of our colleagues was followed
by quite a few agents of a secret service.'
Luke Harding from the Guardian recalls the covert
surveillance as he and his colleagues reported on
Snowden: `Janine Gibson [then-US-editor of The
Guardian], her chats with Glenn Greenwald kept on
falling through, there was someone trying to get a
``man in the middle'' [interception hack] on her
laptop.' `If you work in this field you can be sure that
your phone numbers, your email address and so on will
end up on some selectors list of the NSA or GCHQ,'
adds Sontheimer from Der Spiegel, which learned from
the Snowden leaks that half a year after it covered the
WikiLeaks cables in 2010, its research was monitored
and phone calls surveilled (Holger Stark, interview,
15 March 2016).
Journalists interviewed for this paper who were
subjected to this kind of surveillance reported
adopting a variety of digital counter-security measures.
Nonetheless, so advanced and pervasive are the surveil-
lance capabilities of certain States that it is becoming
increasingly difficult for journalists who work on sensi-
tive stories to find any `safe space' at all. Many of them
reported feelings of `paranoia'.
Threat of legal action
Journalists at the Guardian newspaper in the UK knew
that if they did not comply with certain demands their
newspaper could be shut down. `You've had your fun,'
they were told by the government. `Now we want the
stuff back (The Guardian, 2013).' The Official Secrets
Act was mentioned. Ewan MacAskill was `prepared by
Mills and Sarikakis 5
Guardian lawyers for going in front of a grand jury'
when he flew to the Guardian's offices in New York.
More than two years on, UK journalists who covered
Snowden are still `under investigation'.
A criminal treason investigation, carrying the threat
of lengthy imprisonment was opened in Germany
against Markus Beckedahl, the founding editor of
German data and surveillance news website Netzpolitik
(interview, 12 March 2016) and a colleague of his after
they published an article based on confidential docu-
ments from the BND, Germany's federal intelligence
agency. As soon as he was officially named a suspect
in a treason investigation, the intelligence agencies
were legally allowed to mobilise surveillance tactics
under the `anti-terror' umbrella. `That's something we
were until now familiar with from repressive regimes,'
says Beckedahl.
Chilling effect
US investigative journalist Seymour Hersh (interview
16 March 2016) says: `The government's always hostile
to reporters that tell a different story than they do. It's
always been chilling.' But he notes that they `now have
more tools they can use'.
The enhanced surveillance capacities and the willing-
ness to deploy them on a massive, intrusive scale in
Western democracies are having a `great impact' on
watchdog journalism, warns long-time US national
security reporter James Bamford (interview, 24 March
2016) `I think it is the beginning of what might be called
a Panoptic society.'
The emergence of the surveillance state in Western
democracies has chilling effect implications far beyond
the realm of journalism, Maurizi warns: `I have serious
concern not only for me and my profession . . . but for
everyone.'
Maurizi is echoed by Beckedahl, from Netzpolitik:
`Of course we are more hesitant to get on the phone
with certain sources. We minimise email contact, even
when it's encrypted . . . The kind of surveillance systems
we have set up after 9/11 would have been a dream for
the East German Stasi [secret police].'
`Western democracies are democracies until you do
something, you step out of the cosy circle of accepted
appropriate ``information''' states US investigative jour-
nalist Gavin MacFadyen (interview, 16 March 2016).
Alan Rusbridger (interview, 25 April 2016), editor of
The Guardian when it broke the Snowden story, warns:
`If you believe that the role of journalism is to hold
people to account, to provide verifiable information,
so that people know what's actually going on, that
someone's going to challenge the official version of
events . . . the more you inhibit that, the more you
damage democracy.'
Surveillance of journalists in eroded and
non-Western democracies
When increasingly pervasive, technologically advanced
and unaccountable surveillance is combined with ero-
sions of other democratic ingredients such as judicial
and media independence, the Panoptic chilling effect of
ubiquitous surveillance is intensified for journalists and
their sources.
`I am fully aware that my emails, my phone calls, are
monitored,' says Hungarian investigative journalist
Attila Batorfy (interview, 21 January 2016). He refers
to a colleague who investigates espionage stories, being
threatened: `The secret police was very clear: stop writ-
ing articles about our job [or] we will publish your con-
versations, your emails, your family background, on
government-linked sites.'
Prominent Hungarian investigative journalist Attila
Mong (interview, 03 February 2016) warns of a `grey
zone' around the secret services and police involving
contractors and subcontractors. `They don't ask for
the special permission from a judge described in the
legislation. They just do it.'
Polish investigative journalist Makarenko (inter-
view, 24 February 2016) says that there is concern
within the journalistic community in Poland about
new legislation making surveillance `out of control'.
He says: `They don't need a court order to eavesdrop
or monitor my activity online whatsoever.'
In Turkey, Sevgi Akarcesme (interview, 23 March
2016), editor-in-chief of Turkey's Today's Zaman news-
paper until it was taken over by the government, says:
`When you know you are being monitored by Big
Brother you watch your words.'
The further a country moves across the political
spectrum away from democratic standards, the greater
the frequency with which surveillance of critical jour-
nalists is linked to the threat of, or actual, physical
harm, including assassination, when the surveillance
fails to have its intended chilling effect.
Lebanese journalist Samir Kassir, husband of
BBC Arabic journalist Gisele Khoury (interview,
24 February 2016), was killed by a car bomb in
Beirut in 2005. `In 2001 we [my husband and I] knew
we were under surveillance. They wanted to make it
obvious. When we were in restaurants they were at
the table near us, they followed our car, they tried
one night to be very close to his body when we were
walking.'
Among the many journalists detained in Syria was
Beirut-based freelance reporter Sofia Amara (interview
25 January 2016), who was held at Damascus airport.
`They had my name at the airport. As soon as I stood
there I thought, I'm dead . . . It was the longest two or
three hours of my life.'
6 Big Data & Society
A common characteristic of surveillance of journal-
ists under repressive regimes is the deliberately overt
nature of elements of the surveillance, to maximise
the chilling effect.
`Security agents make no secret of the fact that they
are monitoring Facebook and Twitter accounts,' says
Egyptian journalist Shahira Amin (interview, 28
February 2016), who adds: `My phones are tapped
and a security official has told me that I'm being
monitored.'
A journalist who has worked in Iran, and was impri-
soned there because of that work (interview 04 March
2016) recalls: `I remember I was in a park with one of
my friends, and he said, Hey, look over there, there's a
woman in a chador filming us,' recalls `And then when
I was imprisoned and interrogated they asked if I knew
they had been following me.'
In rush to resist surveillance and protect
sources, journalists take the
cryptography crash course
Resistance to surveillance today involves technology-
geared tactics: taking crash courses in encryption, digi-
tal tech and cyber security in general, irrespective of
the `level' of democracy. The operational security meas-
ures now used range from `burner' throwaway mobile
phones, which are more difficult to monitor, to the
deliberate destruction of email correspondence so that
it cannot be used in possible future legal proceedings
or to identify secret sources, to an emphasis on face-to-
face meetings with confidential sources, to eschewing
electronic communication and its associated surveil-
lance risks entirely, and to the setting up of
both online and physical dead drop boxes, like that of
The Guardian in New York.
Journalists are also much more cautious now about
cross-border travel with data and what their email trail
indicates. `I'd definitely be careful about not carrying,
especially across a border, some material that contains
the names of sources who were confidential who
I thought might get in trouble and I've become much
more careful about what I put in emails, that's for sure,'
says New York Times national security reporter Scott
Shane (interview 18 March 2016). `Because the emails
that I exchanged with John Kiriakou that turned up in
that prosecution I thought of at the time, and I think of
today, as completely innocent and not revealing any
kind of criminal action on his part. That's not the
way the Justice Department ended up seeing it.'
Journalists engage in intensified operational security,
including encryption of hard disks, chat, messaging and
email using apps like Signal, Red Phone, or Proton
Mail and PGP public (communications encryption)
keys, use of the anonymous Tor (browser), password
security optimisation including two-step verification,
use of air-gapped computers (that are never connected
to the Internet) `We just endlessly take precautions
now,' says MacAskill. His colleague at the Guardian,
Luke Harding (interview, 29 February 2016) says:
`For the first six months after Snowden, when I was
meeting the editor and the rest of the staff, the first
thing we'd do, we'd get rid of our IPhones. We'd lock
them away or put them in a different part of the build-
ing' or `in the fridge [which interferes with audio inter-
ception and surveillance] . . . I don't have it around
whenever I'm having a semi-serious conversation.'
Mediapart editor Edwy Plenel (interview, 16 March
2016) puts no diary appointments or any other import-
ant information online. Instead he uses small note-
books, which he subsequently destroys.
In Zimbabwe, investigative reporter Tawanda
Kanhema (interview, 06 December 2015) says, the
cat-and-mouse surveillance game with the authorities
has even more facets: `They tell you you can't take
pictures so you have to come up with ways of protect-
ing your physical data storage devices. You have to
come up with ways of protecting your computer phys-
ically beginning from guarding against burglaries into
your apartment by people, by third-party actors
affiliated with the state. You have to take that first
step of ensuring that you don't store any data on phys-
ical storage devices that are kept in your home.'
There is also the challenge of securing data, not just
communications. Polish investigative journalist
Makarenko says: `Everything we collect needs to be
secured, and so far this is not the case. More and
more sensitive data will be moved to the cloud. The
question is who is going to manage the cloud.'
There's a flip side to using digital security, though,
especially in undemocratic countries like Russia.
Russian journalist Andrei Soldatov (interview 29
February 2016) warns that if journalists start using
encryption, that really gets the Federal Security
Service interested in them because they feel that they
must have something suspicious to hide. But there's
another aspect for journalists where the danger of phys-
ical harm for journalists is high: `Imagine you have
your laptop locked, encrypted with all the latest cut-
ting-edge technologies . . . you cross the border and you
might be stopped by border troops at the airport or
some other border control point, and you might be
asked to open your laptop. At that point you might
compromise in order to be let in or not to miss your
flight.' Another possibility, says Soldatov, is that `you
are stopped with your encrypted laptop in a conflict
zone. This happened to a journalist for Novaya
Gazeta who was stopped by separatists and put in jail
and he was ``kindly'' asked to provide the password or
they would ``break all his fingers. . .''. Sometimes the
Mills and Sarikakis 7
best encryption is to not bring your laptop with you at
all or to have a blank laptop with no emails, no photo-
graphs, just a basic device, that's all.'
Veteran UK investigative journalist Duncan
Campbell (interview, 15 March 2016), too, warns that
investigative journalists should not fall into the trap of
relying entirely on the security offered by digital secur-
ity: `Forget all the magic crypto-stuff . . . Secure Drop
and all of the other new-fangled stuff is of no use at
all if the metadata that [the sources] may have left in
numerous places which identifies their exploratory jour-
ney or contemplation of ethical issues can be
found . . . You have a stack of burner phones and a
plan . . . so that you do not go for the tecchie solu-
tion . . . but as soon as possible, and as untraceably as
possible you break the metadata trail and you have to
get to human contact with that person.' And if you're
meeting a source, `don't take your phone.'
In some instances, surveillance may not have the
intended effect of completely subduing journalists,
prompting a degree of anger and stubborn determin-
ation to `resist'. White and Zimbardo (1980: 51) used
the term `reactance' to describe a condition in which
`people will be upset at their loss of freedom, will
increase efforts to exercise their free speech, and may
attack the agents of the surveillance.' Such `reactance'
lies at the heart of Lyon's assertion (2015) that there is
hope for a fightback against the surveillance state.
An emerging nexus? Traditionally
reluctant to embrace `activism',
journalists join forces with hacktivists
to fight back
In the age of social media, in which the ability to record
and disseminate information lies at virtually every-
body's fingertips, the line between journalism and activ-
ism is in many instances becoming increasingly blurred
(NiemanReports, 2014), unnerving many traditional
journalists who consider activism to be entirely separate
from journalism. Many journalists would agree with
the view of Guardian columnist and digital media pro-
fessor Dan Gilmor who argues that professional jour-
nalists should be: thorough; accurate; fair; independent
(not in terms of being free of the inherent biases of
employers and one's self, but in the sense of being will-
ing to challenge assumptions) (onMedia, 2014). And
they would subscribe to the view of former New York
Times media columnist David Carr that `journalists are
responsible for following the truth wherever it may
guide them' (New York Times, 2013). While journalists
may also be activists, Carr argues, `activism can also
impair vision'. He says: Activists can and often do
reveal the truth, but the primary objective remains
`winning the argument' with the `tendentiousness of
ideology' creating `its own argument' (New York
Times, 2013).
The aim of this paper, though, is not to explore
activism in its various forms and facets, but rather to
shed light and provide focus on the impact of surveil-
lance on democratic journalism through the contextual-
isation of journalists' practices and experiences.
Despite the reluctance with which many traditional
journalists perceive any association with activism,
a pillar of hope for a democratic fightback against sur-
veillance rests on the emerging nexus between so-called
hacker activists, or `hacktivists', and journalists report-
ing on sensitive topics such as national security and
mass surveillance, in which the hackers provide expert-
ise on everything from online security involving encryp-
tion, to the actual provision to journalists of sensitive
public interest information, and the journalists provide
for the hackers a platform and reach that would
be otherwise unattainable. This notion can be closely
linked to a form of `outsider journalism' beyond the
confines and challenges of traditional journalism plat-
forms. Such journalism may herald a form of `sousveil-
lance' of the future in the age of surveillance,
particularly since there is a perception that traditional
news platforms, facing an extraordinary array of chal-
lenges, including business model viability in the online
age coupled with the explosion of public relations,
influence exertion by corporate owners, the pressures
of 24-hour live news environments, and now the sur-
veillance-fuelled ability of governments to identify leaks
and whistle-blowers ­ within or outside the confines of
the law ­ are increasingly unable or unwilling to tackle
all or any of the really sensitive stories about which it is
crucial that citizenries in healthy democracies know.
Although journalists and hackers or hacktivists are
in many respects fundamentally different, they share
a similar platform in what Lyon (2015) calls the strug-
gles over information freedom and control over infor-
mation, and in some instances wear both hats at the
same time. Examples include Julian Assange, and Jacob
Appelbaum, a hacktivist who as a journalist collabo-
rated with Der Spiegel on a number of articles covering
the Snowden leaks. Appelbaum was also associated
with WikiLeaks. Asked if we are seeing a move towards
`subversive' journalism bringing together outsider dis-
senting journalists and hacktivists, MacFadyen (inter-
view, 16 March 2016) says `without a doubt'. Former
Guardian editor Rusbridger (interview, 25 April 2016)
says: `We've seen certain situations recently where jour-
nalists and hacktivists have collaborated. And we don't
know where the recent Panama Papers come from but
it looks at least possible that that came from a hack.
Whenever we've worked with any of those kinds of
people they are quite bemused by the lack of technical
8 Big Data & Society
knowledge or awareness that many of these (news)
organisations have . . . we can learn from these people
and should learn.'
In another example of such collaboration civil soci-
ety NGOs are helping exiled Syrian journalists in
Turkey use highly sophisticated security measures
including encrypted software and protocols to minimise
the potentially lethal likelihood that the Syrian or
Turkish regimes, or jihadist groups, can infiltrate elec-
tronically. Amara worked with activists and IT special-
ists to travel to Syria undercover, to protect her online
presence including social media accounts through VPN
networks, installed in France. She gave a Syrian hack-
tivist control of her computer for four or five hours so
he could install a VPN network that at that time was
unbreakable by the Syrian authorities. She also men-
tioned as an example of effective citizen journalism in
Syria the group of citizen journalists `Raqqa is Being
Slaughtered Silently', in reference to the IS-controlled
northern Syrian city of Raqqa, who use the latest digi-
tal technology to gather and distribute information
from the ground while circumventing surveillance by
Islamic State. `These guys are not professional journal-
ists but they are taking so much risk . . . doing the same
thing . . . and creating such an impact.' Meanwhile, US
investigative news platform ProPublica has launched a
version of its site on the dark web (through the ano-
nymous Tor browser network), for readers who want to
stay anonymous online (The Verge, 2016). Another
example of the convergence of hacktivism and journal-
ism is James Ball's transition from working for
WikiLeaks to working on the Snowden leaks as a jour-
nalist for The Guardian. There are even joint hackti-
vism-investigative journalism conferences such as the
CIJ Logan forum in Berlin, where a sense of common
ground and goals prevails.
One of the challenges to this dynamic, however, is
the fact that hacktivists do not enjoy the same protec-
tions as more easily identifiable journalists working for
traditional media outlets. It recently emerged for, e.g.
that Google was forced to secretly turn over a year's
worth of Appelbaum's Gmail metadata ­ i.e. whom he
emailed, when, and the details of IP addresses he used
to log on to his Gmail account ­ to US investigators
(The Intercept, 2015) as part of their investigation into
WikiLeaks. Appelbaum has chosen to live in Berlin
where, he says, `the cost of physically harassing me or
politically harassing me is much higher than when I last
lived on U.S. soil' (The Intercept, 2015).
Conclusions
An attempt of mutual watching, with the aim of bring-
ing about transparency, lay at the core of the acquisi-
tion and dissemination of information in the WikiLeaks
and Snowden affairs, and its transformation into jour-
nalistic material, in a continuation of a journalistic
tradition that has understood itself as a watchdog.
In this era of possible veillance, albeit it with an imbal-
ance of scale and capacity tilted in favour of the State,
journalism's attempt to take part in a `normalised'
veillance through the use of Big Data has severe impli-
cations that do not contribute towards more transpar-
ency, due to the imminent danger of watchdog
journalism becoming unfeasible. We are finding jour-
nalists in a state of reacting to surveillance threats,
within a climate of surveillance but not engaging
unproblematically in surveillance themselves. If we
accept that mutual watching is operationalised through
whistleblowing, then the impact on journalism is prob-
lematic. Although journalism may have benefited from
access to Big Data, it is also paying a high price.
As journalists, citizen journalists, and hacktivists
converge in a form of new combined journalism seeking
to challenge the Panoptic erosion of democracy, in defi-
ance of the reluctance the media has traditionally dis-
played with regard to any affiliation with activism, or
any notion of activist journalism, their task is facili-
tated by the same online digital world that has allowed
for increased surveillance, but that also makes it easier
for whistle-blowers to gather and transfer information
to journalists.
However, throughout the world, the surveillance
pushback against investigative and critical journalists
pursuing sensitive stories, especially in the realm of
national security and defence, is intense. The strategy
of promoting submission and conformity through
increasingly advanced and pervasive surveillance is a
chilling thread that unites governments across the pol-
itical spectrum, from superficially healthy democracies
in danger of sliding into Panoptic homogenising self-
censorship, eroded illiberal democracies riding waves of
authoritarianism, populism and nationalism, and
repressive regimes intent on retaining absolute power
and control. In democracies, surveillance is not directly
linked to the threat of assassination and torture, but its
relentless march towards ever greater powers and ever
fewer privacy safeguards, amid the establishment of
favourable legislative and institutional governance par-
ameters, is enough to chill the reporting climate and tilt
the equiveillant balance of mutual veillance unmistake-
ably in favour of non-transparent state agencies.
As democracy erodes more broadly, the pace of the
shrinkage of watchdog journalism space picks up rap-
idly because the surveillance is increasingly unaccount-
able, aligns with politico-financial pressure, conducive
new laws and a hollowed-out judiciary, and is linked to
a broader array of veiled and direct threats, including
imprisonment. Western democracies face the threat of
an insidious surveillance-fuelled slide towards societal
Mills and Sarikakis 9
submission and conformance that is a hallmark of
undemocratic regimes.
Across the political spectrum surveillance tactics
employed against journalists make demonstrative
the power of the state while at the same time starkly
underscoring the vulnerability of journalists' rights and
protections. Apparently arbitrary decision-making on
the surveillance of journalists may be designed to illus-
trate an intimidating power to disregard ­ in some
instances even make ­ the `rules' governing the flow
of information in a society, and the fate of journalists.
In Western countries, erosive legal frameworks
often underpin the process. In repressive regimes the
laws can be bent, interpreted and ignored at will.
Ultimately, in both democratic and undemocratic
countries the goal underlying the surveillance of jour-
nalists is the same: to cultivate a chilling effect that
promotes conformance and submission to the domin-
ant governing view. The only major difference lies is the
degree of willingness and ability to resort to violence
for those journalists who don't get the message. The
current counter-tactics of journalists offer no guarantee
as to future strategies. The cost of failure to stem the
surveillance tide is incalculable in terms of personal
resources, mental health and the future of democracy.
