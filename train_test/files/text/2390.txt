Abstract
Background: Consumption levels of prescription opioids (POs) have increased substantially worldwide, particularly
the United States. An emerging perspective implicates increasing consumption levels of POs as the primary system
level driving factor behind the observed PO-related harms. As such, the present study aimed to assess the correlations
between consumption levels of POs and PO-related harms, including non-medical prescription opioid use (NMPOU),
PO-related morbidity and PO-related mortality.
Findings: Pearson's product-moment correlations were computed using published data from the United States
(2001 ­ 2010). Consumption levels of POs were extracted from the technical reports published by the International
Narcotics Control Board, while data for NMPOU was utilized from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health.
Additionally, data for PO-related morbidity (substance abuse treatment admissions per 10,000 people) and PO-related
mortality (PO overdose deaths per 100,000 people) were obtained from published studies. Consumption levels of POs
were significantly correlated with prevalence of NMPOU in the past month (r =0.741, 95% CI =0.208­0.935), past year
(r =0.638, 95% CI =0.014­0.904) and lifetime (r =0.753, 95% CI =0.235-0.938), as well as average number of days per
person per year of NMPOU among the general population (r =0.900, 95% CI =0.625-0.976) and NMPOU users (r =0.720,
95% CI =0.165­0.929). Similar results were also obtained for PO-related morbidity and PO-related mortality measures.
Conclusion: These findings suggest that reducing consumption levels of POs at the population level may be an
effective strategy to limit PO-related harms.

Background
Pain has been long regarded as a stepchild area of medi-
cine until recently. Prescription opioids (POs) are mainly
used as analgesics in the treatment of mild to severe
pain, including cancer and chronic non-cancer pain. In
the context of expanded pain care, their consumption
levels have tripled globally since 1990; however, this ex-
pansion has occurred almost exclusively in high-income
countries, particularly the United States, which has ranked
highest in per capita consumption of POs (based on stan-
dardized doses) for the past decade [1].
Coinciding with this expansion in consumption levels
of POs in the United States have been several PO-
related harms, namely non-medical prescription opioid
use (NMPOU), PO-related morbidity and PO-related
mortality. For example, prevalence of NMPOU during
the past year has risen to almost 5% over the past decade
[2]. Similarly, substance abuse treatment admissions for
POs have increased from 28,326 in 2000 to 157,171 in
2010 [3], whereas there has been a fourfold increase be-
tween 1999 and 2010 in the number of drug poisoning
deaths involving POs [4]. Therefore, it is hardly surpris-
ing that PO-related deaths now surpass deaths related to
heroin and cocaine use combined [5].
Given previous experiences with other psychoactive sub-
stances, one perspective on this area of research, sup-
ported by emerging evidence from the United States [6-8]
and Canada [6,9,10], implicates increasing consumption
levels of POs as the primary system-level driving factor be-
hind the surging opioid epidemic. This short report aims

to further this perspective by using published data for the
United States from 2001 ­ 2010.
Methods
Data
Consumption levels of POs
Annual consumption levels of POs were derived from
technical reports published by the International Narcotics
Control Board (INCB), which detail the availability and
use of narcotic substances in various countries based on
information provided by international governments to the
board [1]. Data within these reports were available in the
form of defined daily doses for statistical purposes (S-DDD),
which are technical units of measurements meant for stat-
istical analysis, and which facilitate comparisons between
different kinds of opioids based on their potency [1]. In
short, calculation of this metric involves a series of suc-
ceeding divisions of the annual consumption of narcotic
substances by 365, country population (millions) during a
given year and defined daily dose [11]. Importantly, a
given year is defined as the midpoint of its interval in the
presentation of the data for this metric by the INCB [1].
For example, the estimate for 2010 represents the average
of the estimates for the 2009 ­ 2011 interval [1].
PO-related harms: NMPOU, PO-related morbidity and
PO-related mortality
Measures of NMPOU included annual prevalence of
NMPOU during the past month, past year and lifetime,
which were drawn from nationally representative surveys
of the United States population: National Survey on Drug
Use and Health Series [2]. These surveys define NMPOU
as use without a prescription or use solely for the
experiences or feelings induced by POs [2]. Additionally,
two other measures targeting the extent of NMPOU occa-
sions were also taken from these surveys, namely average
number of days per year per person of NMPOU among
the general population and among NMPOU users [2].
The PO-related morbidity and PO-related mortality
measures were extracted from published studies [12,13].
The PO-related morbidity measure was substance abuse
treatment admissions for POs per 10,000 people [12],
which was based on data from the Substance Abuse and
Mental Health Services Administration's Treatment Epi-
sode Data Set. Though this measure has been previously
analyzed with S-DDD [6], it was included in the present
study to provide a comprehensive overview of the harms
of PO use in the United States. On the other hand, the
PO-related mortality measure, PO overdose deaths per
100,000 people [12,13], was computed using data from
the National Vital Statistics System multiple cause-of-
death file. Importantly, the 2009 estimate for this meas-
ure was based on an imputation procedure, as data was
not available in published studies.
Table 1 presents the annual data from 2001 ­ 2010 for
the consumption levels of POs, NMPOU, PO-related mor-
bidity and PO-related mortality measures.
Analytic strategy
The primary analytic strategy involved the computation
of Pearson's product moment correlations. As such, r-
values and their respective 95% confidence intervals
were estimated for the correlations between consump-
tion level of POs and each of the PO-related harms de-
tailed previously, viz.: NMPOU prevalence (past month,
past year and lifetime), average number of days per year

and NMPOU users), substance abuse treatment admis-
sions for POs per 10,000 people and PO overdose deaths
per 100,000 people.
Findings
Figures 1 and 2 visualize the relationship between con-
sumption levels of POs and each of NMPOU, PO-related
morbidity and PO-related mortality measures included in
the present study. Table 2 presents the results of the cor-
relational analyses. Based on these data, moderate correla-
tions were observed between consumption levels of POs
and prevalence of NMPOU in the past month (r =0.74),
past year (r =0.64) or lifetime (r =0.75). However, con-
sumption levels of POs were strongly correlated with aver-
age number of days per year per person of NMPOU
among the general population and NMPOU users (r =0.90
and 0.72 respectively). Furthermore, consumption levels of
POs were very strongly correlated with morbidity and
mortality measures, including substance abuse treatment
admissions for POs per 10,000 people (r =0.95) and PO
overdose deaths per 100,000 people (r =0.99).
Discussion
This short report documented significant correlations be-
tween consumption levels of POs and PO-related harms,
including NMPOU, PO-related morbidity and PO-related
mortality. These correlations are corroborated by evidence
from several other American [8,9] and Canadian studies
[7,10,11]. For instance, based on nationally representative
data from the United States dating from 1995 to 2004,
Wisniewski et al. also documented significant correlations
between dispensing levels of two POs and NMPOU preva-
lence and emergency department visits [9].

However, the magnitude of three correlation coefficients
observed in the present study were noteworthy, as near per-
fect correlations (r >0.90) were observed with consumption
levels of POs: average number of days of NMPOU among
general population, substance abuse treatment admissions
for POs per 10,000 people and PO overdose deaths per
100,000 people. The strength of these correlations indicate
linear increases in PO-related harms with increases in
consumption levels of POs. Such near perfect correlations
have been demonstrated previously for PO-related mor-
bidity in the United States [6], but to our knowledge not
for NMPOU or PO-related mortality. Importantly, these
findings suggest that in comparison to prevalence esti-
mates of NMPOU, average number of days of NMPOU
may be better indicators of NMPOU in the United States.
This may partly be due to the stabilization of NMPOU
prevalence estimates over the past decade (p >0.05), and
the parallel increases (p <0.05) in average number of days
of NMPOU over the same time period.
Based on recent data, there seems to be a convergence
of evidence implicating increasing consumption levels of
POs as the primary system-level driving factor in the sur-
ging opioid epidemic. Interestingly, consumption levels of
POs have continued to increase throughout the past dec-
ade, despite limitations in evidence regarding the effective-
ness of pharmacotherapeutic treatment of cancer and
chronic non-cancer pain with POs [14,15]. For example, a
review on the effectiveness of long-term opioid manage-
ment for chronic non-cancer pain concluded that there
was only weak evidence to suggest clinically significant re-
ductions in pain [15]. Similarly, the evidence for effective-
ness of POs for cancer pain is mixed [14]. Given this
current state of the evidence, health policy must weigh
benefits of increased consumption levels of POs against
the PO-related harms, i.e. potential gains in addressing in-
dications of pain vs. NMPOU, PO-related morbidity and/
or PO-related mortality. There exists a need for rigorous
reviews of clinical indications that legitimately warrant
treatment with POs in comparison to other alternatives.
Experts must debate whether there is a genuine need to
treat as many individuals as currently treated with POs in
the United States.
Irrespectively, the link between consumption levels
and public health relevant harms of POs is similar to
that observed with other psychoactive substances, in-
cluding alcohol and tobacco [16,17]. This link persists in

the opposite direction as well when the availability of
POs is decreased, i.e. reductions in availability coincide
with reductions in PO-related harms [18-20]. These
findings emphasize that increased availability of psycho-
active substances, including medications, should always
be considered in a broader context, encompassing both
a clinical and public health perspective.
A key limitation of the present study pertains to the
inability to infer causation from the correlations pre-
sented. For example, closer surveillance due to increas-
ing public health interest may be responsible for the
observed increases in consumption levels of POs or PO-
related harms, which would inevitably result in positive
correlations. In summary, using data from the United
States dating from 2001 ­ 2010, correlations between
consumption levels of POs and PO-related harms were
documented. These findings suggest that curbing con-
sumption levels of POs at the population level may be
an effective strategy towards limiting PO-related harms.
