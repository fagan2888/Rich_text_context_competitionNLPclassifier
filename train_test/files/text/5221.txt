Introduction
The continued integration of service-learning (SL) in higher
education has led SL administrators and researchers to ques-
tion what motivates or prevents faculty from adopting this
engaged pedagogy, and how institutions might better support
faculty and increase satisfaction for those who are in various
stages of changing pedagogy. Arguments for the importance
of engagement in higher education have been directed at
campus leadership and have focused primarily on the bene-
fits for institutions as a means of communicating the credi-
bility and usefulness of universities as important institutions
in civic life (Brukardt, Holland, Percy, & Zimpher, 2004;
Kellogg Commission on the Future of State and Land-Grant
Universities, 1999; TRUCEN: The Research University
Civic Engagement Network, 2008). While this call for higher
education to return to its civic mission is critical for support-
ing and advancing SL pedagogy, many questions remain
about the role faculty play as catalysts for the ongoing cul-
tural and pedagogical shift toward engagement.
Over the last 30 years, adoption of SL pedagogy in U.S.
higher education has grown as colleges and universities
explore ways to increase experiential learning opportunities
for students to apply what they are learning to local and
global issues (Campus Compact, 2012). In SL courses, stu-
dents engage in meaningful service activities and critical
reflection on the service experience to enhance academic
learning, deepen civic understanding, and provide some
mutual benefit to the community through their work (Bringle
& Hatcher, 1996). SL is a form of community and civic
engagement; however, it differs from volunteerism or philan-
thropy by making relevant service a critical component of
the teaching and learning activities in a course. SL best prac-
tices encourage faculty to consider the following when
designing SL courses: develop academic learning goals that
are connected to and reinforced by the SL activity, establish
relationships with community partners that are mutually ben-
eficial, and integrate critical reflection throughout the course
to connect the service with the learning goals.
Bringle and Hatcher (1995) assert that the faculty role in
institutionalizing SL should not be underestimated as faculty
are primarily responsible for the direction and design of cur-
riculum and are therefore gatekeepers for the adoption and
promotion of innovative pedagogies such as SL. However,
according to Tierney and Bensimon (1996), faculty social-
ization through the organizational structure of departments

Changing Pedagogy: Faculty Adoption of
Service-Learning: Motivations, Barriers,
and Strategies Among Service-Learning
Faculty at a Public Research Institution
Su-I Hou1 and Shannon Wilder1
Abstract
This study conducted inductive analyses on faculty motivations, barriers, and strategies for service-learning (SL) adoption in a
major public research university in the Southeast United States. Data found faculty members with prior SL experience were
often motivated by intrinsic personal values, yet external barriers need to be addressed to increase morale. An overwhelming
lack of recognition and rewards was perceived, despite the institutional policy set to formally recognize SL. The policy­
practice gap and issues compounding the implementation in a research institution context were highlighted. Results provide
insights to better institutionalize policy and support to encourage faculty SL adoption.

reinforces faculty perceptions of which activities colleagues
value and which activities are discouraged. As such, there
seems to be a gap between institutional policies that explic-
itly provide support for engagement activities such as SL and
how such policies are actually applied in different disciplines
and departmental cultures. A "top-down" approach to recog-
nizing SL as valuable scholarly work is not sufficient for
institutionalizing SL. Perceptions of "what counts" toward
advancement and promotion have great implications for SL's
adoption among faculty at different career stages (Jaegar
&Thornton, 2009). Research has shown that early career fac-
ulty are particularly motivated by extrinsic factors such as
promotion and tenure for involvement in SL and other activi-
ties outside of traditionally valued scholarly work (O'Meara,
2003). At research institutions, this gap between institutional
policies supporting engagement work and faculty percep-
tions of localized acceptance from colleagues engaged in
peer review and evaluation of one another's work is also
compounded because research institutions privilege schol-
arly work over teaching and service activities.
To further understand the influence faculty has on the
institutionalization of SL, Driscoll (2000) proposed some
broad areas for ongoing research including motivation, sup-
port required, impact of SL on faculty, reported satisfaction,
and obstacles and challenge. While a few recent studies have
looked at faculty motivation, satisfaction, and barriers to
adoption of SL (Abes, Jackson, & Jones, 2002; Bulot &
Johnson, 2006; Hammond, 1994; Hou & Wilder, 2009;
Pribbenow, 2005), the faculty role in SL's advancement is
still in great need of research. Furco (2001) writes that for SL
to be fully institutionalized at research universities "faculty
must be made aware of how it is tied directly not only to their
teaching and service activities, but also to their research."
Integrating SL into the three spheres of traditional faculty
work at research institutions--teaching, research, and ser-
vice (institutional and public service)--requires understand-
ing the culture and context of a particular institution.
The purpose of this study is to examine faculty motiva-
tions, barriers, and strategies toward SL adoption at a major
public research university in the Southeast. The mission of
the current study institution includes engagement (service)
and its promotion and tenure policy specifically mentions SL
as a scholarly activity that can be included in promotion dos-
siers. The current research aims to examine how faculty
members view SL in a university that has set a policy to for-
mally recognize it and the possible gaps between policy and
practice. It serves as an example of how to conduct an inter-
nal study of faculty member perceptions of motivating and
inhibiting factors, in the context of a large research univer-
sity. A recent article compared faculty SL perceptions among
SL faculty versus non-SL faculty and found that the per-
ceived institutional barriers are high regardless of faculty's
previous SL involvement (Hou, 2010) and explored ways to
encourage culture change at an institution that has already
taken steps to enact policies for faculty rewards, recognition,
and support for SL. Therefore, a closer investigation of moti-
vations and suggested strategies among faculty who have
been engaged in SL could provide some insights on the ten-
sions between faculty motivations, values, and norms at
research university environment, and practice of engage-
ment. Results have implication on adding new understanding
of community engagement in higher education among SL
engaged faculty for identifying supportive strategies to better
encourage SL adoption, while addressing faculty perceptions
of institutional barriers.
Method
Study Participants and Data Collection
A representative sample of 1,200 faculty members from a
major research university in the Southeastern United States
was identified. This research institution has an established
Office of Service-Learning (OSL) to promote and support
the development of quality academic SL experiences through
a range of faculty development programs and funding oppor-
tunities. Faculty members who have instructional responsi-
bility or who had taught a course in the previous academic
year were eligible to participate in this institutional-wide
survey.
An administrative memo was sent out to deans, directors,
and chairs informing them of the upcoming survey, followed
by an invitation email sent directly to faculty members.
Participants had a 3.5-week window to respond to the online
survey. The first email reminder was sent out a week after the
invitation email, and the 2nd email reminder was sent out a
week before the survey was due. A total of 449 faculty mem-
bers participated in the online survey. This study was con-
ducted with the approval of the Institutional Review Board
for the Protection of Human Subjects at the researcher's
institution.
Measurement
An online Faculty SL Benchmark Study Survey was devel-
oped. Online surveys have been utilized commonly as one of
the effective ways to gather campus-wide information by the
study institution. This survey was developed by reviewing
existing literature, seeking feedback and input from key
stakeholder groups including the institution's Office of SL, a
campus-wide SL Curriculum Committee, and an SL Interest
Group (SLIG), which was a campus-wide network consist-
ing of faculty, staff, and community partners. Both quantita-
tive and qualitative data were gathered. Survey questions
were generally stated in a way that all faculty members,
regardless of their prior experience with SL, would be able to
respond. However, to gain better understanding of reasons
and motivations driving SL faculty to continue to engage in
SL, and to explore continued barriers faced and recom-
mended strategies, the current analysis zoomed in on SL
Hou and Wilder 3
faculty and their qualitative responses. This study focused on
identifying and examining themes from the following three
open-ended questions:
·
· What do you think motivates faculty involvement in
SL? Or what factors encourage and hinder faculty to
be engaged scholars?
·
· What are some barriers you anticipate experiencing
when (or if) you become more involved in SL?
·
· What are some strategies you would recommend to
address some of the barriers or challenges related to
faculty involvement in SL?
Data Analysis
The inductive, descriptive analyses were conducted using
an iterative, analytical approach. Survey responses from
the above three structured open-ended questions were
compiled and analyzed individually by two trained
researchers, generating semantic codes pertaining to the
issue (Braun & Clarke, 2006). Once codes were agreed on
at the individual level, the compiled responses were cross-
analyzed to identify categories and patterns. The analyses
were carried out through several readings and interpreta-
tion of the raw data. Researchers identified codes via open-
coding, and major thematic areas that inductively
characterized faculty motivation, barriers, and strategies
were derived.
Results
A total of 449 faculty participated in the study; about 60%
were males and 80% were tenure(d)-track faculty. The pro-
portions of faculty from each college/school participating in
the survey are representative to the overall institutional sam-
ple. Among these participants, 22.7% had prior SL experi-
ence (n = 102) and were included in the current analyses.
Data showed that the SL faculty group were more likely to be
females, more likely to be at associate professor rank, less
likely to come from the arts and sciences college, and more
likely to be faculty from education- or social-science-related
colleges (Table 1).
Overall, our data showed that the SL faculty was mostly
internally motivated or connected to personal commitments,
as well as rewards from student appreciation of active learn-
ing strategies and opportunities. Barriers included lack of
time, recognition or rewards, and logistical support.
Participants suggested providing release time, recognition
in the promotion and tenure process, training/mentoring,
and funding opportunities. Key themes identified below
were discussed by the order of their importance in each of
the three category areas (motivations, barriers, and strate-
gies), with more frequently mentioned themes discussed
first. Selected quotes were also provided to illustrate key
themes identified.
Faculty Motivations-Key Themes
Passion and personal interests. A majority of the SL faculty in
the study expressed an intrinsic passion for better student
learning outcomes as the most important motivational factor.
This was an important finding as intrinsic motivation is usu-
ally stronger, which could last longer compared with exter-
nal incentives. "Personal interest, desire to provide students
with realistic work experience, and adding new challenges to
teaching" were some of the reasons mentioned. These fac-
ulty members reported that they "embraced SL as a preferred
pedagogical strategy due to a desire to communicate the pro-
fessional and personal challenges involved in service," "a
genuine interest in holistic student development," "the
opportunity to provide students with real world application,"
and "value towards experiential learning." Data showed that
personal values guided their commitment to SL and was a
strong motivating factor evident throughout responses. One
faculty member provided this perspective,
In my case the motivation to establish a service-learning course
has been to give undergraduate students career exploration
opportunities and to give graduate students applied experience
needed to advance their training and careers.

Of particular interest, however, was that very few faculty
reported external, tangible rewards as primary reasons.
Intrinsic motivation was the most important driving force. In
fact, several noted, "I got involved despite colleagues'advice
against it."
Social commitment.Social commitment was the second
salient motivating factor. Social commitment reflects per-
sonal values and is a more intrinsic force. Many faculty
members indicated a true desire to connect with the commu-
nity through their discipline. "Passion for community
engagement," "desire to give back and contribute to com-
munity improvement," and a "commitment to supporting the
land-grant university mission" were all important reasons of
social commitment. To summarize, internal motivations or
commitment, pure passion for it, and a desire to be connected
with community were found to be salient among most SL
faculty members.
Rewards. The intangible rewards of seeing students gaining
self-confidence and engage in active learning were the third
most frequently mentioned motivational factors. The intan-
gible rewards received from seeing positive student learning
outcomes can bring faculty longer-lasting joy and satisfac-
tion. "Student enthusiasm and appreciation" can be powerful
motivators for continuing an SL course, noted by one faculty
respondent. "The learning outcome observed in students,"
"the increased learning and discussion that took place in a
service-learning class," "satisfaction in helping the commu-
nity while providing an engaging learning environment,"
"resolving real life problems," and "community relationship
building" were all important intangible rewards.
Faculty Barriers-Key Themes
Lack of (external) reward or recognition. Although many fac-
ulty experienced satisfying intangible rewards from students,
the lack of external reward or recognition discouraged many
SL faculty members. Many SL faculty commented, "such
work is not rewarded or recognized" and "service-learning is
viewed as less academic." Several faculty even stated that
"tenured faculty are HOSTILE to the idea of service-learn-
ing," "such activities are not counted or are counted less for
promotion and tenure," or "felt they were being penalized or
devalued for pursuing such activities." One participant
stated, ". . . the only aspect of my work that is recognized in
my department is standard academic publishing. Anything
else--including community projects--is looked down
upon."
Others stated,
It's something "extra" that is incredibly time intensive with little
professionalpay-off.Currently,itfeelsthatcollegeadministrators
are giving it a lot of lip service and saying how much they value
it, but in the end it is just a pat on the back if you do it.
I have a full research agenda and teaching load and I don't have
time to do extra activities that are not recognized by my
department . . . . I publish a great deal, but BECAUSE of my
community service I am perceived as less scholarly. I am
actively DISCOURAGED from working in the community.
Such work needs to be rewarded but it is not.
The fact that non-SL faculty members discounted the
efforts needed for developing such courses was very discour-
aging. Many SL faculty members voiced their frustrations
that colleagues should "reward community service rather
than penalize me for it."
Other faculty members commented,
Most barriers I have experienced have come from traditional
tenure track faculty members who have not participated in such
activities and have no appreciation for it. They want it to be
provided by non-tenure track faculty.
The investments in time and energy in SL activities can be
significant and can be devoted to those activities that are
"valued" by the department and colleagues.
Our data clearly showed that although recognition of SL
work was not even among the top three most important moti-
vators for adoption of SL pedagogy among SL faculty mem-
bers, it was indeed one of the most significant barriers
identified for continuing the work with positive morale.
Time, time, and more time. Lack of time was the second most
significant barrier. The need for time and energy to establish
partnerships and coordinate logistics and the lack of release
time from other responsibilities posed significant barriers.
Faculty participants commented,
Time, lack of logistical support from staff, liability issues, the
greater emphasis given to research over teaching in tenure
decisions. You will get tenure by being an outstanding researcher
and an average teacher. You will not get tenure by being an
outstanding teacher and an average researcher.
We, the already overworked faculty members, cannot do
everything, and the time it takes to conduct a SL course or
project takes away much needed time for writing research
articles and grant proposals. Research productivity leads to
tenure and promotion and raises--not service-learning courses.
Our data showed that lack of time was the reality, and
analyses suggested that this barrier was still closely linked
with the lack of recognition, particularly during the tenure
and promotion process described above.
Logistics and funding.These included identification of sites,
transportation, and scheduling issues, assessment procedures at
placement sites, coordination with community partners, and risk
management issues. In addition, funding for SL projects was
often limited and hard to find. Faculty members commented,
Hou and Wilder 5
Funds for this kind of work are limited, and even if we get funds
for this work (which are typically small pots of funding), this
funding does not help us research faculty in our demonstration
of research excellence (in the way that real grants [NIH, EPA,
NSF, etc.] and manuscripts in peer-reviewed journals do).
Faculty Recommended Strategies--Key Themes
Reward/incentives.The most important strategy overwhelm-
ingly pointed to establishing more tangible rewards. This
highlighted again the barriers identified above needed to be
addressed. These ranged from release time, reduced course
loads, providing assistants to help with coordination and com-
munication, and limiting enrolment for SL courses. Also, par-
ticipants argued the pressure to produce more credit hours runs
contrary to best practices in quality SL courses and suggested
a need to develop institutional policies to limit enrolment.
Promotion and tenure recognition.This is certainly among a
significant concern among faculty especially in a research-
focused university. Faculty suggested recognition strategies
such as to "show faculty how they could use service-learning
to enhance promotion and tenure so they don't feel like it is
going to contribute negatively." Some commented on the
need to change policy so service--broadly defined--is rec-
ognized and counted toward tenure. Furthermore, demon-
strating that "administrative faculty across the institution
value tenure track faculty participation in service-learning"
was viewed as critical to increase the morale of SL faculty.
Training/mentoring and funding. Suggestions included provid-
ing workshops and assistance for faculty to incorporate SL
into existing courses, and educate not only faculty but also
administrators on SL pedagogy:
Training--More mentoring and workshops to explain what SL
is . . . benefits associated with SL . . . how to begin . . . how can
someone incorporate SL in more classes; logistical work and
who to contact in the community; where to find support and the
like; experiences from a more supportive and engaged
department. More visibility and publicity about what's going on
in those types of course.
Providing more funding opportunities was also suggested,
such as mini-grants to add SL into existing courses, faculty
grants for SL projects, and student SL grants or stipends to
do more in-depth projects. In addition, "opportunities to
showcase student service-learning projects," "venues to rec-
ognize faculty efforts," and "a focus on scholarship that can
emerge from service-learning courses" were suggested.
Discussion
Our data clearly showed that intrinsic motivation to improve
student learning and development was the most important
driving force for faculty adopting SL pedagogy despite
discouragement from colleagues or their departments. This
finding was consistent with existing studies (Abes et al.,
2002; Bringle, Hatcher, & Games, 1997; Hammond, 1994;
Vogelgesang, Denson, & Jayakumar, 2010). Although ser-
vice and outreach is part of the core mission in a public
research university, when it comes to promotion and tenure,
the three areas are usually not weighted equally, with
research activity clearly privileged (Furco, 2001). Our cur-
rent data strongly suggest that perceived external barriers
were high even among faculty members who have over-
come obstacles and already actively engaged in SL in the
study research institution. These institutional culture and
values toward SL need to be addressed to increase morale
and encourage further faculty adoption of this pedagogy.
Institutions should also explore ways to provide tangible
rewards and recognition as important strategies to increase
faculty morale and promote policy implementation to sup-
port community engagement.
Although it is no surprise that SL is not a top priority
within research institutions for promotion, our data pro-
vide important insights from the perspectives of SL faculty
at a large research institution regarding the tensions
between intrinsic motivations and the extent to which
institutional or cultural norm barriers affecting faculty
were willing and able to engage in the SL project. The cur-
rent study shows that the issues of lack of recognition or
rewards were overwhelmingly prominent. Although recog-
nition of SL work was not among top motivators for fac-
ulty SL engagement, it was indeed one of the most
significant barriers identified for continuing the work. The
tensions between the intrinsic motivations toward experi-
ential learning from faculty members and the non-conduc-
tive reward system exist in research university environment
were high. Despite its explicit service and outreach mis-
sion, the recent establishment of the OSL, and the promo-
tion and tenure policy support for SL; faculty in the current
study perceived significant gaps between institutional pol-
icy and the actual practice norms at their most immediate
unit (department) levels. This widespread perception that
SL involvement damages advancement opportunities must
be taken into account when providing extrinsic support for
faculty adopting SL. The fact that the SL faculty at the
study institution was more likely to be at the associate pro-
fessor rank indicates their proven success and survival in
the tenure and promotion process or their adoption of SL
after successful achieving tenure. A significant number of
the SL faculty actually indicated having adopted this
approach for years and in more than one course (80+%).
These were likely outstanding faculty with scholarly activ-
ities meeting the more "traditional" promotion criteria
while at the same time adopting SL approach, with or with-
out the support of institutional policy.
The significant gaps between institutional policy and
unit practice on SL may be compounded with the empha-
sis on traditional research in promotion and
6 SAGE Open
tenure criteria, which commonly exist in research-focused
institutions. Hlengwa (2010) provides some theoretical
perspective on why certain disciplines might be more
likely than others to adopt SL pedagogy and provides
some insights on the possibilities and constraints of infus-
ing SL into the curriculum. Research universities in par-
ticular are encouraged to consider ways to support forms
of engaged scholarship such as SL and community-based
participatory research not only in their promotion and ten-
ure guidelines but also through faculty development pro-
grams focused on engaged scholarship. In addition to
institutional administrative support, strategies also need
to be strengthened and targeted at the unit levels to value
the important role tenure track faculty play in SL involve-
ment. Special efforts are also needed to gain buy-in and
support among the unit administrative leaders. Identifying
ways to re-frame SL as a form of valued scholarship and
approach that could facilitate deeper integration of all the
three faculty responsibilities warrants attentions. There is
continued need to examine further the enabling and con-
straining factors, both from structure (discipline) level
and faculty perspective.
The study is limited in its shorter quotes due to the nature
of online surveys. Additional insights might be emerged
from more in-depth interviews, particularly with those who
chose to engage in SL despite the potential risks to their ten-
ure and promotion process, and who eventually earned ten-
ure. Future research could further examine these areas to
learn perspectives from this special group of faculty
members.
In summary, the study provides insightful comments
from SL faculty in a large research institution and opportu-
nity of a more representative sample to voice their concerns
in depicting a better understanding on the issue. Results
provide understanding of SL within a research institution
context, as well as insights to help universities better insti-
tutionalize policy, provide support to address unit culture,
and institute recognition systems to encourage faculty SL
adoption.
