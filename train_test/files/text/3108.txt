HYPERTENSION IS A MAJOR RISK
factor for cardiovascular dis-
ease morbidity and mortal-
ity.1-3 The National Health
and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES), conducted by the National
Center for Health Statistics, provides pe-
riodic information on the health of the
US population. Based on earlier analy-
ses of NHANES data, with the possible
exception of black men aged 50 years or
older, hypertension prevalence has de-
creased between 1960 and 1991.4 In ad-
dition, during this time, the entire popu-
lation-based blood pressure (BP)
distribution shifted downward.5
In apparent contrast with these fa-
vorable trends, according to the Behav-
ioral Risk Factor Surveillance System
(BRFSS), self-reported hypertension
was 24.9% in 1999 compared with
22.9% in 1991.6 This increase may rep-
resent an increase in awareness, but be-
cause the BRFSS does not include BP
measurements, the current hyperten-
sion prevalence rate in the commu-
nity is not known.
Despite the overwhelming evidence
that hypertension control is associated
with a significant reduction in cardio-
vascular events,7-9 less than 25% of the
US population with hypertension had
their BP controlled in 1988-1991.10 The
goal of the US Department of Health and
Human Services that 50% of Americans
with hypertension have their BP con-
trolledbytheyear2000wasnotmet,and
this goal has been reestablished to be
achieved by 2010.11,12 Recent trends in
hypertension control in the US popula-
tion are not known.
We analyzed NHANES data to de-
termine trends in the prevalence, aware-
ness, treatment, and control of hyper-

Context Prior analyses of National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES)
data through 1991 have suggested that hypertension prevalence is declining, but more
recent self-reported rates of hypertension suggest that the rate is increasing.
Objective To describe trends in the prevalence, awareness, treatment, and control
of hypertension in the United States using NHANES data.
Design, Setting, and Participants Survey using a stratified multistage probabil-
ity sample of the civilian noninstitutionalized population. The most recent NHANES
survey, conducted in 1999-2000 (n=5448), was compared with the 2 phases of NHANES
III conducted in 1988-1991 (n=9901) and 1991-1994 (n=9717). Individuals aged 18
years or older were included in this analysis.
Main Outcome Measures Hypertension, defined as a measured blood pressure
of 140/90 mm Hg or greater or reported use of antihypertensive medications. Hyper-
tension awareness and treatment were assessed with standardized questions. Hyper-
tension control was defined as treatment with antihypertensive medication and a mea-
sured blood pressure of less than 140/90 mm Hg.
Results In 1999-2000, 28.7% of NHANES participants had hypertension, an in-
crease of 3.7% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0%-8.3%) from 1988-1991. Hyper-
tension prevalence was highest in non-Hispanic blacks (33.5%), increased with age
(65.4% among those aged 60 years), and tended to be higher in women (30.1%).
In a multiple regression analysis, increasing age, increasing body mass index, and non-
Hispanic black race/ethnicity were independently associated with increased rates of
hypertension. Overall, in 1999-2000, 68.9% were aware of their hypertension (non-
significant decline of -0.3%; 95% CI, -4.2% to 3.6%), 58.4% were treated (in-
crease of 6.0%; 95% CI, 1.2%-10.8%), and hypertension was controlled in 31.0%
(increase of 6.4%; 95% CI, 1.6%-11.2%). Women, Mexican Americans, and those
aged 60 years or older had significantly lower rates of control compared with men,
younger individuals, and non-Hispanic whites.
Conclusions Contrary to earlier reports, hypertension prevalence is increasing in the
United States. Hypertension control rates, although improving, continue to be low.
Programs targeting hypertension prevention and treatment are of utmost importance.

1988 and 2000.
METHODS
NHANES is a stratified multistage prob-
ability sample of the civilian noninsti-
tutionalized US population. The third
NHANES was conducted in 2 phases be-
tween 1988 and 1994; the first phase in
1988-1991 and the second phase in
1991-1994.13 The most recent NHANES
was conducted in 1999 and 2000.12 Al-
though each of the surveys has an over-
all similar design, the 1999-2000 sur-
vey has a smaller sample size and is the
first part of the continuous NHANES.14
This may lead to a higher SE for vari-
ables measured in the 1999-2000 sur-
vey.15 All participants provided in-
formed consent and the data were
approved by the Centers for Disease
ControlandPreventionInstitutionalRe-
view Board as ensuring confidential-
ity.14 For this analysis, we included data
onallparticipantsaged18yearsorolder.
This includes age, sex, and self-
assigned race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic
whites, non-Hispanic blacks, Mexican
Americans, and other racial groups, in-
cluding non­Mexican American His-
panic whites and blacks). In addition,
body mass index (BMI; calculated as
weight in kilograms divided by the
square of height in meters) and BP mea-
surements and hypertension and diabe-
tes mellitus history were included.
A certified operator performed BP
measurements using a mercury sphyg-
momanometer and a standardized pro-
cedure in each survey during the home
interviewandduringthephysicalexami-
nation at home or at a mobile examina-
tion center. A cuff size appropriate for
theparticipant'sarmcircumferencewas
used. Quality control was ensured by
operator recertification, procedural
checklists, and data review.16,17 In the
1999-2000 phase, 9.7% had fewer than
3BPreadingscomparedwith0.5%inthe
1991-1994phaseand0.4%inthe1988-
1991phase(P.01).Asmall(1%)and
similar number of participants in all 3
phasesreportedthattheyhadneverhad
a BP measurement. Those interviewed
but not examined were not included in
the analysis (n=1076 in 1988-1991,
n=790 in 1991-1994, and n=472 in
1999-2000).
Eachsurveyusedsimilarquestionsfor
hypertension history. We considered a
participant to be hypertensive if the av-
erage systolic BP (SBP) was 140 mm Hg
or higher or the average diastolic BP
(DBP) was 90 mm Hg or higher or if the
participant was currently receiving an-
tihypertensive medications. The same
criteria were used for both diabetic and
nondiabetic participants. Participants
were considered to be aware of their hy-
pertension if they answered "yes" to the
interview question "Have you ever been
told by a doctor or health professional
that you had hypertension, also called
high blood pressure?" Participants were
considered to be treated if they an-
swered "yes" to the interview question
"Because of your high blood pressure/
hypertension are you now taking pre-
scribed medicine?" Participants were
considered to have their hypertension
controlled if they were receiving anti-
hypertensive medications and their av-
erage SBP was less than 140 mm Hg and
average DBP was less than 90 mm Hg.
A separate control variable was defined
for diabetic participants. Participants
were considered diabetic if they an-
swered "yes" to at least 1 of these inter-
viewquestions:"Haveyoueverbeentold
by a doctor that you have diabetes or
sugar diabetes?" or "Are you now tak-
inginsulin?"or"Areyounowtakingdia-
betes pills to lower blood sugar?" Dia-
betic participants were considered to
have controlled hypertension if they
were receiving antihypertensive medi-
cation and their mean BP was below the
recommended target. Because of the
change in recommendations between
1988 and 2000 to a lower target BP in
diabetic individuals, we defined con-
trolinthosewithdiabetesbasedon2cri-
teria for BP: a mean SBP of less than 140
mm Hg and a mean DBP of less than
90 mm Hg, and a mean SBP of less than
130 mm Hg and a mean DBP of less than
85 mm Hg.18
Each survey oversampled African
Americans, Mexican Americans, and
individuals aged 60 years or older.14,19
Toadjustforoversampling,specialsam-
plingweightswereincludedinouranaly-
sis.Theseweightsalsoadjustedfornon-
response bias and poststratification
population totals.20 To obtain estimates
of the sampling errors, a Taylor linear
approximation method and jackknife 1
procedures were used in each of the 3
surveys.19,21,22 In consideration of the
complexsampledesign,SASversion8.02
(SURVEYMEANS,SURVEYREG)23 and
WesVar version 4.2 (Westat Inc, Rock-
ville, Md) software were used. For sta-
tisticalanalysesofdifferencesovertime,
data from the 1999-2000 survey were
compared with 1988-1991 data rather
than the entire NHANES III survey to
provide more comparable sample sizes.
The test for a linear trend over the 3
phases of the NHANES survey is the

tion were considered unreliable.15,24
Hypothesis testing was not performed
on unreliable estimates. Age adjust-
mentandpopulationestimateswerecal-
culated using the standard 2000 US
population estimates, with a popula-
tion breakdown by 10-year incre-
ments.25 The following age groups were
used in this analysis in accordance with
the 1999-2000 survey's analytic guide-
lines: 18-39 years, 40-59 years, and 60
yearsorolder.15 Testsfortrendwereper-
formed using the t test for comparisons
of weighted means (to adjust for sam-
pling weights) between the 1988-1991
and 1999-2000 data. We used a conser-
vative approach for statistical signifi-
cance (=.01) to help account for mul-
tiple comparisons. Multiple regression
analysis was performed with hyperten-
sionastheoutcomevariableandage,sex,
race/ethnicity, and BMI as predictors to
calculate the independent association
between the predictors and the out-
come variables. This analysis was per-
formed separately for each of the 3
phases. Results were nonstandardized.

had the highest prevalence of hyperten-

1991-1994, and P=.01 for 1999-2000)
and Mexican Americans had the lowest
rates (P.001 for all 3) in all 3 surveys,
and rates for all racial/ethnic groups
tended to increase between 1988 and
2000.Hypertensionprevalenceincreased
to a greater extent in individuals aged
60 years or older than in younger indi-

Hypertension was not associated with
sex (P=.37) in the regression analysis.
In all 3 surveys, demographic charac-
teristics and BMI accounted for 30% to
31% (age accounted for 26%, non-
Hispanic black race/ethnicity for 0.4%,
and BMI for 5%) of the hypertension
prevalence.
To address the possibility that the
increase in the age-adjusted hyperten-
sion prevalence could be secondary to
the increase in BMI from 1988-1991 to
1999-2000, we calculated the contribu-
tionofthisincreaseinBMItotheincrease
in hypertension prevalence. Adjusting
the 1988-1991 hypertension preva-
lence for the differences between 1988-
1991 and 1999-2000 covariates using
analysis of covariance, 2.0% of the 3.6%
increaseofhypertensionprevalencewas
attributable to an increase in BMI.
Because the recommended goal for
hypertension control has been changed
to less than 130/85 mm Hg in those with
diabetes,18 we considered the possibil-
ity that the increase in prevalence in the
1999-2000 phase may be due to initia-
tionofantihypertensivetherapyatlower
BP levels, in accord with this new rec-
ommendation. A separate analysis of
age-adjustedprevalenceexcludingthose
with diabetes demonstrated an in-
crease in hypertension prevalence be-
tween 1988 and 2000, but this increase
was no longer significant (24.3 [SE, 2.0]
in 1988-1991 vs 27.8 [SE, 1.9] in 1999-
2000; P=.10).
In 1999-2000, 68.9% of all hyperten-
sive participants were aware of their hy-
pertension,and58.4%werereceivingBP
medication(TABLE 5).Hypertensionwas
controlled in 53.1% of those taking
medication, and among all hyperten-
sive participants, BP was controlled in
only 31.0%. Awareness remained un-
changed from 1988 to 2000, although
treatment and overall control in-
creased by 6.0% (P=.007) and 6.4%
(P=.004), respectively. Among partici-
pants with diabetes, control rates de-
clined but not significantly, possibly be-
cause of the small number of
hypertensive individuals with diabe-
tes.BasedontheBPcriterionoflessthan
140/90 mm Hg, 46.9% of all patients
withhypertensionanddiabeteshadtheir
hypertension controlled in 1999-2000
compared with 53.1% in 1988-1991.
Control rates were lower for partici-
pants with diabetes, based on the BP cri-
terion of less than 130/85 mm Hg.
We then evaluated the separate ef-
fects of sex, race/ethnicity, and age on
hypertension awareness, treatment, and
control (TABLE 6). Between 1988 and
2000, hypertension awareness rates re-
mained stable in both men and women.
Hypertension treatment and control
ratesincreasedinmen(P.001forboth)
but did not change significantly in
women. In the 1999-2000 survey, hy-

tween men and women (P = .12),
whereas treatment rates were higher, al-

COMMENT
This analysis indicates that almost 29%
of the adult US population, an esti-
mated 58.4 million individuals, had
hypertension in 1999-2000. This is an
overall increase from 1988-1991 and
demonstrates a reversal of the previ-
ouslyreportedtrendofanoveralldecline
inhypertensionprevalencebetween1960
and 1991 using the NHANES survey.4 It
also shows that women, non-Hispanic
blacks,andtheolderpopulationhavethe
highest rates of hypertension. In 1999-
2000,almost30%ofallhypertensiveindi-
vidualswereunawareoftheirillness,42%
were not being treated, and, at the time
thattheirBPwasmeasured,69%didnot
have their hypertension controlled.
Women, older participants, and Mexi-
can Americans tended to have the low-
estratesofcontrol.Inaddition,in1999-
2000, nearly 75% of all patients with
diabetes and hypertension did not have
their hypertension controlled to the BP
target of less than 130/85 mm Hg rec-
ommended in 1997.18

The observed increase in hyperten-
sion prevalence during the last 10 years
is in accordance with results from the
BRFSS.6 However, as expected, the
prevalence based on NHANES data is
higherbecauseBPmeasurementwasnot
performedintheBRFSSsurvey.Ourdata
suggest that the increased prevalence is
not explained by an increased aware-
ness of hypertension. Potentially, the in-
creased prevalence may be related to an
increase in BMI as well as the aging of
the US population. Based on an analy-
sis of NHANES data, Flegal et al26 re-
cently reported an increase in preva-
lence of obesity during this same period.
Our analysis indicates that BMI was as-
sociatedwithhigherhypertensionpreva-
lence after adjusting for age, sex, and
race/ethnicity and contributed to 2%--
more than half--of the 3.6% increase in
hypertension prevalence. Therefore, the
increasedprevalenceofhypertensionbe-
tween 1988-1991 and 1999-2000 ap-
pears to be partially related to but not
solely secondary to the increase in BMI.
Although awareness rates remained
unchanged, treatment and control rates
have each increased by approximately
6% between 1988 and 2000. In the lat-
est survey, treatment and control rates
of 58% and 31% are comparable with
rates observed in the Framingham data
between1990and1995,inwhich60.7%
of hypertensive patients were treated
and 29% had their hypertension con-
trolled.27 Furthermore, our analysis
shows that, compared with younger in-
dividuals with hypertension, older in-
dividualswithhypertensionhavealower
rate of control despite being equally
likely to be treated. Although previous
studies have also shown that hyperten-
sionislesslikelytobecontrolledinolder
patients,27-30 this analysis demonstrates
that since 1988 the control rate in the
elderly population has minimally in-
creased and remains lower than in those
aged 40 to 59 years. We also observed
that Mexican Americans had lower rates
of awareness, treatment, and control
than non-Hispanic whites and non-
Hispanic blacks. This pattern persisted
between 1988 and 2000.
Women had a greater increase in hy-
pertension prevalence than men from
1988 to 2000, and in the 1999-2000 sur-
vey,hypertensionprevalencewashigher
in women aged 60 years or older than
in any other age or sex group. Other sur-
veys have suggested higher prevalence
of hypertension in elderly women. For
example, in the National Health Inter-
view Survey, 38% of women 65 to 74
years old reported hypertension com-

spite the increase in hypertension preva-
lence in women, awareness, treatment,
and control rates remained unchanged
from 1988 to 2000.
Lowering BP in patients with diabe-
tes and hypertension is associated with
decreases in cardiovascular events and
renal failure.32,33 Our analysis demon-
stratesthatin1999-2000,onlyonequar-
ter of diabetic participants receiving
antihypertensivedrugshadtheirhyper-
tension controlled to the recom-
mended BP of less than 130/85 mm Hg.

Thelowcontrolratesobservedinthis
analysiscanbeexplainedinpartbylack
of awareness or treatment. However,
even in those who reported that they
were receiving hypertension medica-
tions, only 53% had hypertension con-
trolled to the recommended target. In
addition,recentanalysisoftheFraming-
hamHeartStudydemonstratedthatcon-
trol was only 33.7% at follow-up in a
cohort of participants with hyperten-
sion that was treated and uncontrolled
at baseline.34 Conceivably, different

age on race/ethnicity and sex differ-
ences.However,despiteuniversalhealth
insurance (Medicare) for those aged 65
yearsorolder,hypertensioncontrolrates
were lowest among individuals aged 60
years or older. Other reports have also
noted low hypertension control rates in
theelderly,28 inpatientstreatedataVet-
erans Administration hospital,35 and in
inner-city African Americans,36 despite
availability and access to medical care.
Theseobservationssuggestthatimprov-

trol in the United States. In addition,

Although measurements obtained at
a single point in time may overestimate
the prevalence of hypertension, this po-
tential problem was minimized by tak-
ing the average of 3 separate measure-
ments obtained under the same
standardized conditions in each of the
surveys. Other potential sources of bias
in the reported estimates of hyperten-
sionprevalenceincludepossibleBPcon-
trol by nonpharmacological means (diet
and exercise), failure to sample home-
less or other unnumerated persons, pos-
sible differential response rates, and lack
of estimates for smaller racial/ethnic
groups. Also, this analysis depends on a
national survey that documents self-
reported medical history. Although this
method has been shown to be accurate
in estimating hypertension preva-

lence,37 limitations exist. Participants
whoreportinaccuratelythattheyarenot
receiving antihypertensive medications
or who cannot recall if their physician
has ever told them that they have hyper-
tension are considered nonhyperten-
sive or unaware of their disease. Also,
participantswhohavebeentoldthatthey
have hypertension but are not receiv-
ing medications and have BP below the
140/90 mm Hg cut points are not
counted as hypertensive. In addition, in
this survey, medication use or type was
not confirmed, which can lead to mis-
classification. For example, partici-
pants may have been using medications
that lower BP for another indication.
Despite progress in treatment and
control, hypertension remains an im-
portant public health problem, and our
analysis of the NHANES data has sig-
nificant public health implications. The
increase in hypertension prevalence in
women, non-Hispanic blacks, and older
individuals highlights the need for in-
terventions that would target preven-
tion in these groups. Even greater
strides will need to be made, as the im-
portance of reducing BP with healthy
lifestyle interventions in prehyperten-
sive individuals in the general popula-
tion (BP of 120-129/80-89 mm Hg) has
recently been emphasized, and the tar-
get BP goal for antihypertensive therapy
in diabetic individuals has been low-
ered to less than 130/80 mm Hg.38 In
addition, improving hypertension treat-
ment and control in women, the older
population, Mexican Americans, and
diabetic individuals will have a signifi-
cant impact on overall control rates,
which would be translated into im-
proved cardiovascular outcomes. Al-
though control rates have improved
since 1988, these rates remain unac-
ceptably low. If the increase in hyper-
tension control rates remains at the
current pace, the 50% target for hyper-
tension control by 2010 will not be met.
Programs targeting hypertension pre-
vention to achieve the 16% target for
hypertension prevalence by 2010 and
improving awareness and treatment are
of utmost importance for the health of
the US population.
