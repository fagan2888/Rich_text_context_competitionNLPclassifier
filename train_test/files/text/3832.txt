Abstract
Objectives: To investigate the efficacy and safety of sedation with dexmedetomidine in upper
gastrointestinal endoscopy.
Methods: Patients with ASA physical status I­II undergoing elective upper gastrointestinal
endoscopy were randomly allocated to receive dexmedetomidine or midazolam for conscious
sedation. Continuous peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2
), heart rate, mean arterial pressure
(MAP), Ramsay Sedation Scale (RSS) and numeric rating scale pain scores were recorded before,
during and after the procedure. Patients completed a post-procedure satisfaction questionnaire.
Results: Patients in the midazolam group (n ¼ 30) experienced a significant decrease in MAP
during sedation compared with pre-sedation values. Patients in the dexmedetomidine group
(n ¼ 30) had significantly higher SpO2
and RSS scores during sedation than those in the midazolam
group. Overall satisfaction was higher in the dexmedetomidine group than the midazolam group.
There were no clinically significant complications in either group.
Conclusion: Dexmedetomidine has a good safety profile and is an effective sedative for use in
upper gastrointestinal endoscopy.

regarding potential discomfort and pain,
and are generally unable to tolerate the
procedure with topical pharyngeal anaes-
thesia alone. Conscious sedation enables
patients to maintain their response to
verbal and tactile stimuli without losing
cardiovascular and ventilatory function.1
This form of sedation combines an opioid
analgesic and a benzodiazepine, and is
commonly used in upper gastrointestinal
endoscopy.2,3 The a-adrenoceptor agonist
dexmedetomidine dose-dependently reduces
arterial blood pressure and heart rate, and
decreases haemodynamic and plasma cat-
echolamine responses. It is used as a seda-
tive, anaesthetic adjuvant, premedicant and
anxiolytic, and has minimal adverse effects
on respiratory function.4­7 The aim of this
study was to investigate the use of dexme-
detomidine compared with midazolam in
conscious sedation for upper gastrointes-
tinal endoscopy, and examine its effects on
perioperative haemodynamics, sedation,
pain and patient satisfaction.
Patients and methods
Study population
This retropective randomized study
recruited patients with ASA physical status
I­II8 who were scheduled to undergo elect-
ive upper gastrointestinal endoscopy
between January 2012 and December 2012
at Union Hospital, Fujian Medical
University, Fuzhou, China. Exclusion cri-
teria were: inability or unwillingness to
participate or to give consent; ASA status
!III; coexisting cardiac anomalies; aged
<20 years or >60 years; allergy to study
drugs (midazolam, dexmedetomidine or opi-
oids); history of chronic alcoholism, sedative
or narcotic analgesic drug abuse; advanced
or decompensated liver or renal disease;
uncooperative; and any serious illness.
The study was approved by the ethics
committee of Fujian Medical University,
China and adhered to the tenets of the
Declaration of Helsinki. All subjects pro-
vided written informed consent prior to
enrolment.
Anaesthesia
Using a computer generated randomization
schedule, patients were assigned to undergo
conscious sedation with either dexmedeto-
midine or midazolam and were taken into
the operating room without any premedica-
tion. Patients in the dexmedetomidine group
received 0.3 mg/kg dexmedetomidine bolus
injection and 1 mg/kg fentanyl citrate intra-
venous infusion 10 min before endoscopy,
followed by 0.2­0.3 mg/kg per h dexmedeto-
midine continuous infusion until an appro-
priate level of sedation was achieved.1
Patients in the midazolam group received
0.05 mg/kg midazolam bolus injection
and 1 mg/kg fentanyl citrate intravenous
infusion 10 min before endoscopy, followed
by 0.01 mg/kg midazolam at intervals of
approximately 2­5 min until a satisfactory
level of sedation was achieved.1 Additional
0.01 mg/kg midazolam boluses were avail-
able for rescue sedation, if required. In both
groups, additional and 1 mg/kg fentanyl
boluses were available for rescue analgesia.
Standard monitoring (electrocardiogram,
pulse oximetry and noninvasive blood pres-
sure) was performed and antecubital venous
access for intravenous fluids was achieved
with a 20G intravenous cannula. All patients
received prophylactic oxygen (1­2 l/min) via
a nasal cannula during the procedure.
A physician was present throughout the
procedure and provided direct supervision
of the endoscopist. All endoscopies were
performed using standard techniques1,2 and
were carried out by the same endoscopist.
Data collection
All patients were observed in the recovery
room until Aldrete post-anaesthesia

recovery score reached !9 (full recovery
from sedation).9 The time to full sedation
and full recovery were recorded for all
patients. Complications occurring during
and after endoscopy, including apnoea,
SpO2
< 85%, decreased blood pressure
(<80% of basal value), HR <50 beats/min,
cough or abnormal body movements were
noted. Patients' overall satisfaction was
assessed via questionnaire immediately fol-
lowing discharge from the procedure
room.10
Continuous peripheral oxygen saturation
(SpO2
), heart rate (HR) with telemetry and
mean arterial pressure (MAP) were recorded
at the following time-points: 1, before sed-
ation; 2, full sedation, before endoscopy; 3,
5 min after beginning of endoscopy; and 4,
after completion of endoscopy and discon-
tinuance of drugs. Ramsay Sedation Scale
(RSS)11 and numeric rating scale for pain
(NRS)12 scores were recorded at time-points
2 (full sedation, before endoscopy) and 3
(5 min after beginning of endoscopy).
Statistical analyses
Continuous data were presented as
mean Æ SD and range. Between-group com-
parisons were made using Student's t-test for
normally distributed data or Mann­
Whitney U test for non-normally distributed
data. Within-group comparisons were made
using paired t-test for independent variables
or Wilcoxon test for dependent variables.
P-values <0.05 were defined as statistically
significant.
Results
The study recruited 60 patients (35 male/25
female; mean age 35.9 Æ 10.9 years; age
range 20­60 years), who were randomly
assigned to receive either midazolam or
dexmedetomidine (n ¼ 30/group). Demo-
graphic and clinical data on the patients
are shown in Table 1. There were no statis-
tically significant between-group differences
in sex distribution, age, weight or time to full
sedation or recovery.
Data on clinical parameters at each time-
point are shown in Table 2. In the mid-
azolam group, mean arterial pressure was
significantly lower at time-points 2 and 3
compared with time-point 1 (P < 0.05 for
both comparisons). SpO2
and RSS scores
were significantly higher in the dexmedeto-
midine group than the midazolam group at
time-points 2 and 3 (P < 0.05 for all
comparisons).
According to data obtained from ques-
tionnaires, patients in the dexmedetomidine
group rated their overall satisfaction with
the procedure higher than those in the

P < 0.05). A total of six patients (dexmede-
tomidine group n ¼ 1; midazolam group
n ¼ 5) thought that they required either
more or less sedation than they received.
No patient reported experiencing any severe
pain during the procedure. The amnesic
effect was equivalent in both groups, with
no patient reporting any recollection of
intra-procedure events.
A total of eight patients required add-
itional sedation and analgesia (dexmedeto-
midine group n ¼ 3; midazolam group
n ¼ 5). No patient experienced rebound
hypertension, tachycardia or acute reversal
of sedative and analgesic effects in either
group. No patient required prolonged post-
procedure monitoring, unplanned admis-
sion or subsequent medical attention.
Discussion
Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy is a rou-
tine procedure, but patients may experience
discomfort and pain. Topical anaesthesia
alone has been advocated for endoscopy in
order to avoid the cost and risk of conscious
sedation,13,14 but this approach is likely to
be less acceptable to patients and reduce
their willingness to undergo repeat proced-
ures. Sedation is routinely used in upper
gastrointestinal endoscopy,15­17 with care
taken to balance patient comfort and post-
procedure side effects. The most suitable
agents for conscious sedation during upper
gastrointestinal endoscopic procedures are
still being investigated. In common with
other reports,10,18,19 the present study com-
pared the sedatives dexmedetomidine and
midazolam. Our data showed that patients
in the dexmedetomidine group experienced
better peripheral oxygen saturation and RSS
scores than those in the midazolam group.
Dexmedetomidine has been approved for
sedation in critically ill patients in the
intensive care unit, and during surgery,

Dexmedetomidine also has been reported
to reduce the stress response to surgery and
intensive care,20,21,22 and has been shown to
be a useful sedative agent for colonoscopy.10
Midazolam was selected as the medica-
tion for comparison in our study owing to its
frequent use as a sedative in gastroscopy and
endoscopy.10,18,19 Midazolam is usually
used alone for gastroscopy and is combined
with opioids (meperidine or fentanyl) for
colonoscopy and endoscopic retrograde
cholangiopancreatography (ERCP).10,23
Some studies have recommended propofol
as a sedative in upper gastrointestinal endos-
copy, but difficulties in estimating the cor-
rect dosage and the lack of a direct
antagonist limit its use, particularly in
high-risk patients.24 Dexmedetomidine and
midazolam were used in the present study
because these drugs have distinctive
pharmacological profiles and their respect-
ive adverse effects require different manage-
ment strategies.10,18,19
Dexmedetomidine is commonly adminis-
tered as a bolus of 0.5­1.0 mg/kg, followed
by an infusion of 0.2­2.0 mg/kg per h. The
initial loading dose may cause adverse car-
diovascular reactions such as hypertension,
hypotension, bradycardia or sinus arrest,
especially in patients taking medication
capable of producing negative chronotropic
effects (e.g. b-adrenergic antagonists and
digoxin) or those with hypovolaemia.25­27
An infusion of 0.5 mg/kg per h has been
shown to be highly effective in promoting
sedation and analgesia for mechanical ven-
tilation even without prior bolus.28,29 In the
present study, the bolus dose was reduced to
0.3 mg/kg to avoid rapid haemodynamic
changes,26,27 and a continuous infusion of
0.2­0.3 mg/kg per h was used. This relatively
low total dose may explain the absence of
respiratory and cardiovascular complica-
tions in our study, and the low initial
loading dose followed by continuous infu-
sion of dexmedetomidine provided
adequate, well controlled sedation. High
doses of sedative drugs are likely to cause
complications, especially in high-risk
patients.30
Airway protection and the maintenance
of cardiovascular stability are important
responsibilities of the endoscopist during
upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. Oxygen
desaturation is a common complication
during sedation, possibly due to the overuse
of sedative agents and subsequent lack of
ventilation.30 Patients in the dexmedetomi-
dine group had higher SpO2
than those in
the midazolam group in the present study,
indicating that dexmedetomidine had no
significant respiratory depressive effects.
Since dexmedetomidine binds to a2 recep-
tors rather than gamma-aminobutyric acid
(GABA) receptors, patients can be easily
aroused from sedation and experience less
significant respiratory depression than those
sedated using midazolam.31,32 Endotracheal
intubation should be considered in patients
with poor respiratory status (SpO2
< 85%)
or those who are deeply unconscious (RSS
score !6).
Hypotension resulting from cardiac
instability is a concern during upper gastro-
intestinal endoscopy. The invasive nature of
the procedure can lead to patient anxiety,
hyperventilation and arrhythmia. Dexmede-
tomidine has been associated with brady-
cardia, which can be reversed with drug
treatment and will resolve spontaneously
after weaning.28,29 No patient experienced
clinically significant bradycardia in the pre-
sent study, and there were no cases of
rebound hypertension or tachycardia fol-
lowing discontinuation of either drug.
This study has several limitations. First,
the retrospective nature of the study intro-
duces potential bias in data collection and
incomplete data for some patients.
Secondly, the small cohort precluded reach-
ing statistical significance for all study end-
points, and much larger numbers of patients
must therefore be evaluated to confirm the
520 Journal of International Medical Research 42(2)
safety profile of dexmedetomidine. Thirdly,
the study included only low-risk patients
(ASA I or II), since high-risk patients
(ASA III­IV) are generally sedated by
anaesthetists in our institution. Finally,
this was a single-centre study and others
may have different findings.
In conclusion, our results suggest that
dexmedetomidine has a good safety profile
and is an effective sedative for use in upper
gastrointestinal endoscopy.
