A representative sample of 815 pre-hurricane residents of the areas affected by Hurricane
Katrina was interviewed 5­8 months after the hurricane and again 1 year later as the Hurricane
Katrina Community Advisory Group (CAG). The follow-up survey was carried out to study
patterns-correlates of recovery from hurricane-related post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD),
broader anxiety-mood disorders and suicidality. The Trauma Screening Questionnaire
screening scale of PTSD and the K6 screening scale of anxiety-mood disorders were used
to generate DSM-IV prevalence estimates. Contrary to results in other disaster studies, where
post-disaster mental disorder typically decreases with time, prevalence increased significantly
in the CAG for PTSD (20.9 vs 14.9% at baseline), serious mental illness (SMI; 14.0 vs 10.9%),
suicidal ideation (6.4 vs 2.8%) and suicide plans (2.5 vs 1.0%). The increases in PTSD-SMI were
confined to respondents not from the New Orleans Metropolitan Area, while the increases in
suicidal ideation-plans occurred both in the New Orleans sub-sample and in the remainder of
the sample. Unresolved hurricane-related stresses accounted for large proportions of the
inter-temporal increases in SMI (89.2%), PTSD (31.9%) and suicidality (61.6%). Differential
hurricane-related stress did not explain the significantly higher increases among respondents
from areas other than New Orleans, though, as this stress was both higher initially and
decreased less among respondents from the New Orleans Metropolitan Area than from other
areas affected by the hurricane. Outcomes were only weakly related to socio-demographic
variables, meaning that high prevalence of hurricane-related mental illness remains widely
distributed in the population nearly 2 years after the hurricane.

Introduction
Hurricane Katrina was the deadliest hurricane in the
United States in seven decades and the most
expensive natural disaster in US history. More than
500 000 people were evacuated. Nearly 90 000 square
miles were declared a disaster area (roughly equal to
the land mass of the United Kingdom).1 More than
1600 deaths were confirmed and more than 1000
people still remain missing.2 As one might expect
based on these facts, epidemiological data have
documented an extremely high prevalence of psycho-
pathology in the population affected by Katrina.3,4
The most representative epidemiological study esti-
mated that nearly half of the pre-hurricane residents
of the New Orleans Metropolitan Area and one-fourth
of the pre-hurricane residents of the other areas
affected by Katrina had a DSM-IV anxiety-mood
disorder 5 months after the hurricane, with 30% of
those from New Orleans Metro and 12% of those from
the remainder of the hurricane area estimated to have
post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).3
The destruction caused by Hurricane Katrina has
lingered much longer than that occurring after pre-
vious hurricanes.5 Indeed, many people living in the
areas affected by Katrina continue to be without
essential services 2 years after the storm. One might
expect from this that the typical pattern of recovery
from post-disaster mental illness would be delayed.
Previous research has documented an inverse J-shaped
recovery curve for PTSD after traumatic events, with
recovery most rapid in the first year, more gradual in
the second year and stabilizing into chronicity after
2 years.6 Although fewer studies have examined recovery
after natural disasters,7­9 the results are generally con-
sistent with the larger literature in finding that a
substantial proportion of post-traumatic mental illness
resolves within 1 or 2 years. But there are exceptions. For
example, a longitudinal study of victims of the 1992
Hurricane Andrew in Florida carried out 6 and 30

months after the hurricane found that the prevalence of
PTSD actually increased slightly over time.9 A similar
pattern has been found in long-term studies of refugees
exposed to ongoing severe stress,10,11 whereas recovery
has been much more common in studies of refugees
whose objective life situations improved substan-
tially.12,13 In the case of armed services personnel
returning from combat duty in Iraq and Afghanistan,
the even more extreme pattern has been found of PTSD
symptoms actually increasing over time.14,15
It would not be surprising, based on these results, if
a similar pattern of slow recovery or perhaps even an
increase in mental illness, compared to cases shortly
after the hurricane, was found in follow-up studies of
survivors of Hurricane Katrina. The current report
presents data on this matter from the Hurricane
Katrina Community Advisory Group (CAG), a repre-
sentative sample of pre-hurricane residents of the
Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)-
defined areas in Alabama, Louisiana and Mississippi
directly affected by Katrina16­18 who agreed to
participate in a series of tracking surveys over several
years to assess need for mental health services. The
baseline survey was carried out 5­7 months after
the hurricane and the first follow-up survey of the
same sample was carried out 1 year later. Results from
this two-wave panel sample are presented here on
trends in the prevalence and correlates of hurricane-
related anxiety-mood disorders.
Three results from the baseline CAG survey are
noteworthy as a backdrop to the current report. First,
the estimated prevalence of anxiety-mood disorders in
the baseline CAG survey was roughly twice as high as
the estimated prevalence found 3 years earlier using
the same measures in the sub-sample of the National
Comorbidity Survey Replication (NCS-R)19 residing in
areas subsequently affected by Hurricane Katrina.4 We
will present data here on trends in this prevalence over
the subsequent year. Second, the socio-demographic
correlates of these disorders were largely the same in
the CAG and the NCS-R, suggesting that the adverse
mental health effects of Hurricane Katrina were
equally distributed across broad segments of the
population. We will examine whether patterns of
change in these disorders over the subsequent year
also were consistent or varied across broad socio-
demographic segments of the population. Third, the
prevalence of suicidality in the baseline CAG sample
was much lower than in the NCS-R despite the higher
prevalence of anxiety-mood disorders. Subgroup ana-
lysis traced this low prevalence of suicidality to
widespread feelings of optimism in the affected
population that the practical problems of living created
by the hurricane would soon be resolved. This
optimism turned out to be unrealistic, as the subse-
quent pace of government reconstruction efforts was
slow. This raises the question whether the slow pace of
recovery resulted in a rise in the prevalence of
suicidality to a level more consistent with the high
prevalence of anxiety-mood disorders in the popula-
tion, a possibility that we evaluate here.
Materials and methods
The sample
The CAG target population was English-speaking
adult (aged X18) pre-hurricane residents of the
counties (in Alabama and Mississippi) and parishes
(in Louisiana) defined by FEMA as directly affected by
Hurricane Katrina (www.fema.gov/hazard/hurricane/
2005katrina). Pre-hurricane residents of these areas
were eligible for the sample regardless of whether they
were in these areas at the time of the hurricane and
regardless of the extent they or their property were
affected by the hurricane. Census data suggest that
only about 1% of this population was unable to speak
English, suggesting that the restriction of the sample to
English-speakers did not introduce major bias into the
sample.
Respondents were selected from three sampling
frames: the telephone numbers (land lines and cell
phones) of the roughly 1.4 million families that
applied for assistance from the American Red Cross
(ARC); a random-digit dial (RDD) telephone frame of
households in the areas affected by the hurricane and
a supplemental sample of hotels that housed FEMA-
supported evacuees. Although the use of RDD might
seem impractical in a population where many people
evacuated, evacuation was much more common in
New Orleans Metro than the remainder of the affected
areas. Furthermore, many evacuees had returned as of
the time of the survey. RDD was useful in contacting
these nonevacuees and returned evacuees. The vast
majority of evacuees, in comparison, applied to the
ARC for assistance and could be traced through
contact information provided in the ARC applications
for assistance. Other evacuees could be traced in the
RDD sample through a call-forwarding service set up
by Bell South in the wake of the hurricane that
forwarded calls to phone numbers anywhere in the
country requested by the person in whose name the
pre-hurricane phone was registered. More details on
sampling and adjustment for overlap of the frames are
reported at www.HurricaneKatrina.med.harvard.edu.
The baseline CAG survey was carried out between
19 January and 31 March 2006, 5­7 months after the
hurricane. A total of 1043 respondents completed
the interview, representing an estimated 41.9% of the
eligible households we screened. This low coopera-
tion rate is due at least in part to the fact that we
required a commitment from respondents for long-
term involvement in the CAG in order to participate
in the baseline survey, as the main goal of the CAG
was to track the progress of recovery over time. An
analysis of data obtained from the full screening
sample found that those who did not join the CAG
were similar to participants on all socio-demographic
variables, but had a somewhat higher level of self-
reported hurricane-related stress exposure (assessed
by asking respondents to rate their hurricane-related
stress exposure on a 0­10 scale where 0 meant `no
stress at all' and 10 meant `the most stress you can
imagine a person having') and more psychological

distress (assessed with a short series of questions
about frequency of common anxiety-mood symp-
toms). The median and inter-quartile range (IQR:
25th­75th percentiles) of reported hurricane-related
stress exposure were 8.0 (6.0­10.0) among nonre-
spondents and 7.0 (5.0­9.0) among CAG members.
The median and IQR of reported psychological
distress on a scale scored to have a 0­10 theoretical
range were 2.9 (1.2­4.4) among nonrespondents
and 1.7 (0.6­3.5) among CAG members. A weight
was applied to the baseline CAG data to adjust for
these response biases. A within-household probabi-
lity of selection weight was also used along with
a post-stratification weight to adjust for residual
discrepancies between the CAG and the 2000 Census
population on a range of social, demographic and pre-
hurricane housing variables. The consolidated CAG
sample weight, finally, was trimmed to increase
design efficiency based on evidence that trimming
did not significantly affect the estimated prevalence
of anxiety-mood disorders.
Detailed personal contact information (current and
permanent addresses, land line and cell phone
numbers, email addresses) and tracing information
(contact information for three people who would
know how to find the respondent if he/she moved)
was obtained for all baseline CAG respondents. This
information was used to find baseline respondents for
a follow-up survey carried out 1 year after the initial
interview. Some 815 of the baseline respondents were
successfully traced and interviewed in this follow-up
survey (78.1% of the baseline sample). Minor differ-
ences in the composition of the follow-up sample
compared to the baseline sample in socio-demo-
graphic characteristics, traumatic stress exposure
and mental health were adjusted for by using a
propensity score adjustment weight20 applied to the
consolidated baseline weight.
Measures
Anxiety-mood disorders. The K6 scale of nonspecific
psychological distress21 was used to screen for
DSM-IV anxiety-mood disorders within 30 days of
each interview.22 Scores range from 0 to 24. Two
independent validation studies have shown the K6
has an area under the receiver operating characteristic
curve of between 0.8621 and 0.8923,24 in predicting
DSM-IV anxiety-mood disorders that meet the
severity criteria for the Substance Abuse and Mental
Health Services Administration's definition of serious
mental illness (SMI)25 when compared to diagnoses
generated from comprehensive diagnostic interviews.
Based on these K6 validation studies, scores of 13­24
were classified probable SMI, while scores of 8­12
were classified probable mild­moderate mental
illness (MMI) and scores of 0­7 were classified
probable noncases. The designation of MMI is a
residual definition of respondents estimated to meet
criteria for a DSM-IV anxiety-mood disorder but not
SMI. Previous research has shown that MMI is of
considerable public health importance because of its
high prevalence, burden and risk of transition to
SMI.26
A small clinical reappraisal study of five respon-
dents selected randomly from each of these three K6
categories (SMI, MMI and noncase) was carried out
with the structured clinical interview for DSM-IV
(SCID).27 The syndromes assessed were DSM-IV major
depressive episode, panic disorder, generalized anxi-
ety disorder, PTSD, agoraphobia, social phobia and
specific phobia. Serious mental illness was defined as
a DSM-IV diagnosis with a global assessment of
functioning28 score of 0­60 and MMI as a DSM-IV
diagnosis with a global assessment of functioning of
X61. The SCID interviews confirmed K6 classifica-
tions for 14 of 15 respondents. The exception was a
respondent classified as having SMI by the K6 but
MMI by the SCID based on a global assessment of
functioning (GAF) score of 65 (with GAF of 0­60
required to diagnose SMI). These results, although
based on only a small sample, suggest that the K6 has
excellent psychometric properties (estimated in the
SCID sample weighted to adjust for the sample-wide
K6 distribution), including sensitivity (1.0 for SMI,
0.90 for MMI and 1.0 for either SMI to MMI) and
specificity (1.0).
Given the special importance of PTSD in trauma
situations, a separate PTSD screen was included
based on the 12-item Trauma Screening Question-
naire (TSQ),29 a validated screen for PTSD.30 Our
version differed from the original TSQ in using
dimensional response options rather than a simple
yes­no response format to assess 30-day symptom
frequency (never, less than once a week, about once a
week, two to four days a week and almost every day).
A clinical reappraisal study was carried out to
calibrate TSQ responses to DSM-IV PTSD with 30
respondents judging possible cases and 10 randomly
selecting others. A cut-point on the factor-based 0­42
scale of TSQ responses (12 items, each scored 0­4) of
20 þ was selected to approximate the SCID PTSD
prevalence in the weighted (to adjust for over-
sampling of screened positives) clinical reappraisal
sample. Sensitivity (0.89), specificity (0.93) and area
under the receiver operating characteristic curve
(0.91) were all excellent for this dichotomous screen.
Suicidality. Suicidality was assessed with questions
about the occurrence of suicidal ideation (`seriously
thinking about killing yourself'), plans and attempts
within the past 12 months using questions originally
developed for the National Comorbidity Survey.31
Hurricane-related stressors. The baseline survey
included 29 structured questions developed based
on pilot interviews about hurricane-related stressors.
These included traumatic stressors that occurred at
the time of the hurricane (for example, death of a
loved one, a life-threatening experience that occurred
to the respondent), highly stressful experiences that
occurred in the aftermath (for example, homelessness,

physical adversity) and chronic stressful experiences
that occurred in the first 5­7 months after the
hurricane (for example, geographic dislocation,
financial adversity). The latter set of questions was
repeated in the follow-up survey. In addition,
respondents were asked to provide a quantitative
rating of the overall stressfulness of their situation by
reporting `how stressful overall' they would say their
experiences related to the hurricane and aftermath
were on a 0­10 scale `where 0 means not at all
stressful and 10 means the most stressful thing you
can imagine.' Based on the finding that responses to
the structured questions about specific stressors were
strongly related to responses to the global rating
question, we focus on trends in responses to the latter
question in the current report, distinguishing
respondents who reported severe (9­10), serious
(7­8), moderate (5­6) or mild (3­4) stress from other
respondents (0­2).
Socio-demographics. We examined associations of
the mental health outcomes with a number of socio-
demographic variables, including the respondent's
age, sex, race/ethnicity, family income in the year
before the hurricane, education, current health
insurance coverage and current living situation. Age
was coded 18­39, 40­59 and 60 þ . Race/ethnicity
was coded non-Hispanic whites, non-Hispanic black
and other (largely Hispanics and Asians). Family
income was coded in quartiles, where low was
defined as less than or equal to 0.5 of the
population median on the ratio of per tax income to
number of family members, while low-average was
defined 0.5 þ through 1.0 on the same ratio, high-
average 1.0 þ through 3 and high 3 þ on this ratio.
Years of education were coded in four categories:
0­11, 12 (high school graduate), 13­15 and 16 þ
(college graduate). Health insurance was coded yes­
no. Current living situation, finally, was coded in four
categories: living in the same house as before the
hurricane, in the same county/parish but not the same
house, in the same state but not the same county/
parish and in a different state.
Analysis methods
Cross tabulations were used to examine patterns of
onset, recovery and persistence of estimated DSM-IV
anxiety-mood disorders that qualify for the designa-
tions of SMI and MMI and of suicidal ideation, plans
and attempts. The significance of differences in these
prevalence estimates between the baseline and
follow-up surveys was evaluated using within-
respondent paired comparison tests. The effects of
socio-demographic variables and stress measures in
predicting trends in these outcomes were estimated
using logistic regression analysis.32 When the baseline
value of the outcome variable is included as a control
in such equations to predict outcomes at the time of
follow-up, as it is here, the regression coefficients can
be interpreted as predictors of change in the out-
comes.33 In the absence of estimated interactions
between the substantive predictors and the baseline
measure of the outcome, the effects of the predictors
on change are assumed to be the same in predicting
onset and absence of remission of the outcome. In
order to determine whether the associations of the
predictors with onset and absence of remission differ,
we evaluated the statistical significance of interac-
tions of substantive predictors with baseline mea-
sures of each outcome. Logistic regression coefficients
and their standard errors were exponentiated to create
odds-ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95%
CI's) for ease of interpretation. Because the data were
weighted, the Taylor series linearization method34
was used to calculate design-based significance tests.
Multivariate significance was evaluated using Wald's
w2 tests based on design-corrected coefficient
variance­covariance matrices. Statistical significance
was evaluated using two-sided 0.05-level tests.
Results
Trends in DSM-IV anxiety-mood disorders and
suicidality
The estimated prevalence of any anxiety-mood
disorder did not change significantly between the
baseline survey (30.7%) and the follow-up survey
(33.9%; t = 1.9, P = 0.06), although the trend is
positive (Table 1). The estimated prevalence of SMI,
in comparison, is significantly higher in the follow-up
than baseline survey in the total sample (14.0 vs
10.9%, t = 2.4, P = 0.018) and nearly significant in the
sub-sample of respondents who are not from the New
Orleans Metropolitan Area (13.2 vs 9.4%, t = 1.9,
P = 0.053). This trend is not significant, in compar-
ison, in the New Orleans Metro sub-sample (16.9 vs
16.5%, t = 0.3, P = 0.81). The estimated prevalence of
PTSD is significantly higher in the follow-up than
baseline survey in the sub-sample exclusive of New
Orleans Metro (20.0 vs 11.8%, t = 4.0, P < 0.001), but
not in the New Orleans Metro sub-sample (24.1 vs
25.9%, t = 0.9, P = 0.37). The prevalence of suicidality,
finally, is significantly higher in the follow-up than
baseline survey both with regard to suicidal ideation
(6.4 vs 2.8%, t = 3.9, P < 0.001) and suicide plans (2.5
vs 1.0%, t = 3.1, P = 0.002). These trends, unlike those
for SMI and PTSD, are significant and relatively
comparable in magnitude in both the New Orleans
Metro sub-sample and in the remainder of the sample.
We cross-classified baseline and follow-up diag-
noses in order to study the composition of the
diagnoses with significant trends. The majority of
respondents classified as having SMI at follow-up
either already had SMI at baseline (39.9%) or pro-
gressed from baseline MMI, PTSD or suicidal ideation
(31.6%) to SMI, while the remaining 28.5% represent
delayed onsets (that is, no MMI, no PTSD and no
suicidal ideation at baseline; Table 2, Part I). A similar
pattern exists for PTSD, where the majority of follow-
up cases either already had PTSD at baseline (47.3%)
or progressed from baseline SMI, MMI or suicidal
ideation to PTSD (27.1%), while the remaining 26.8%

are delayed onsets (that is, no SMI, MMI and no
suicidal ideation at baseline). The proportions of
delayed onsets are comparable for suicidal ideation
(24.1%) and somewhat higher for suicide plans
(46.6%), while the proportions with persistence
(16.6 and 26.0% for ideation and plans, respectively)
are lower than those for SMI and PTSD. The propor-
tions that represent progressions (that is, from base-
line cases with SMI, MMI or PTSD) are higher for
suicidal ideation (59.3%) than for SMI or PTSD and
comparable for suicide plans (27.4%) compared to SMI
and PTSD.
It is noteworthy that the majority of respondents
with baseline SMI (51.1%) continued to have SMI at
follow-up, while 30.8% improved (that is, were
classified as having MMI, PTSD or suicidal ideation
at follow-up but not longer classified as having SMI)
and only a relatively small minority (18.1%) recov-
ered (that is, no longer met criteria either for any of
the following: SMI, MMI, PTSD, and suicidal idea-
tion; Table 2, Part II). In the case of PTSD, 66.4% of
baseline cases continued to have PTSD at follow-up,
while an additional 16.9% were classified as having
MMI, SMI or suicidal ideation but not PTSD at follow-
up, and only 16.7% recovered. Persistence was
somewhat lower for suicidal ideation (37.9%), but
much higher for plans (69.8%). Improvement, in
comparison, was comparatively high for suicidal
ideation (49.9%), but not for suicide plans (12.2%).
Recovery (that is, no MMI, or SMI, no PTSD and no
suicidality at follow-up), finally, was relatively
uncommon for either suicidal ideation (12.2%) or
plans (18.0%).
Socio-demographic predictors of the trends
Only three of the socio-demographic variables are
significant predictors of trends in SMI, PTSD or
suicidal ideation: respondent age, family income and
current living situation (Table 3; suicide plans, which
also increased significantly over time, were too rare to
be included in the trend analysis). Respondent age
significantly predicts increased prevalence of PTSD
(highest increases among respondents ages 40­59)
and suicidal ideation (highest increases among
respondents ages 18­39). Low family income predicts
increased prevalence of all three outcomes. Family

living situation predicts increased prevalence of SMI
(higher increases among respondents not living in the
same town as before the hurricane, whether or not
they live in the same county-parish or state, compared
to those living in the same town, whether or not they
live in the same house). While significant in statistical
terms, these associations are not strong in substantive
terms. The significant ORs (in the range 0.2­5.7)
explain only between 2.1% (PTSD) about 2.7% (SMI)
of the variance in the outcomes based on f2 tests.
An attempt was made to distinguish the predictors
of delayed onset from the predictors of persistence by
including interactions between the predictors and the
baseline measures of the outcomes in an expanded
version of the prediction equations, but none of these
models converged due to the sparseness of the data. As
a result, we cannot determine whether the significant
socio-demographic predictors are predicting delayed
onsets of the outcomes, persistence or both.
The effects of hurricane-related stress
One possible explanation for the significant increases
in the prevalence estimates of SMI, PTSD and suicidal
ideation is that hurricane-related stresses might have
increased over time due to the slow pace of recovery
efforts. As it turns out, though, this is not the case. A
significantly lower proportion of respondents re-
ported hurricane-related stress in the follow-up
survey (57.5%) than in the baseline survey (91.7%;
t = 19.5, P < 0.001; Table 4). This significant decrease
exists both in the New Orleans Metro sub-sample
(97.9 vs 78.3%, t = 10.0, P < 0.001) and in the
remainder of the sample (90.0 vs 51.7%, t = 13.8,
P < 0.001). The decrease exists not only for stress
overall but also for severe stress (32.6 vs 13.2%,
t = 15.8, P < 0.001) and serious stress (27.6 vs 12.9%,
t = 21.4, P < 0.001). It is noteworthy, in light of the fact
that the SMI-PTSD increases exist only in the sub-
sample exclusive of the New Orleans Metro Area, that
the decrease in hurricane-related stress is less
pronounced in New Orleans Metro than the remain-
der of the sample. Indeed, the prevalence of stress in
the follow-up survey is significantly higher in the
New Orleans Metro sub-sample than in the remainder
of the sample (78.3 vs 51.7%, t = 6.5, P < 0.001). This
means that higher levels of residual hurricane-related
stress cannot explain the fact that SMI-PTSD pre-
valence increased over time only among respondents
not from the New Orleans Metro Area.
Another possibility is that the psychological effects of
hurricane-related stresses increased over time even
though the magnitude of the stresses themselves
decreased. A comparison of the cross-sectional associa-
tions between hurricane-related stresses and the out-
comes finds some superficial support for this possibility
with regard to SMI, as the ORs linking stress with SMI
in the follow-up survey are consistently larger than the
parallel ORs in the baseline survey (Table 5). However,
these differences are not statistically significant
(w4
2 =8.1, P=0.09). Furthermore, the pattern is not less

pronounced in the New Orleans Metro sub-sample than
in the remainder of the sample (w4
2 =5.1, P=0.28;
detailed results available on request) This means that
heightened reactivity to hurricane-related stress cannot
explain the fact that the significant increase in SMI is
confined to respondents in the sub-sample exclusive of
the New Orleans Metro Area. Furthermore, the pattern
of higher ORs at follow-up than baseline does not hold
either for PTSD or for suicidal ideation. In the case of
suicidal ideation, the rarity of the outcome required the
stress measures to be dichotomized (severe stress vs all
others) to stabilize parameter estimates.
The model was expanded to study the effects of
hurricane-related stress on trends in SMI, PTSD and
suicidal ideation. This was carried out by adding a
control for the baseline value of the outcome to the
prediction equation along with measures of stress
assessed in both surveys. Baseline stress was not a
significant predictor of trends in either SMI (w4
2 =4.3,
P =0.37) or PTSD (w4
2 =8.0, P=0.09), while stress at
follow-up was significant in both equations (w4
2 =31.5,
P <0.001; w4
2 =13.0, P =0.011). No significant interac-
tions were found between baseline stress and follow-up
stress or between sub-sample (that is, New Orleans
Metro vs the remainder of the sample) and either
measure of stress (detailed results available on request).
Based on these results, the final model for trends in SMI
and PTSD included stress in the follow-up sample as

the only key predictor (Table 6). Stress exposure in
this model is associated with substantial variation in
both SMI and PTSD at follow-up, with ORs for serious-
severe stress in the range 35.8­42.2 for SMI and
12.8­20.3 for PTSD after controlling for baseline SMI
and socio-demographics.
A good way to grasp the substantive significance of
these results is to examine standardized prevalence
estimates of the outcomes SMI and PTSD at follow-
up. The latter are prevalence estimates in which
adjustments have been made to correct for the
associations of stress with baseline values of the
outcomes, socio-demographics and sub-sample, so
that the effects of stress can be seen distinct from the
effects of these other variables. These standardized
prevalence estimates are 0.3% SMI and 1.4% PTSD
among respondents with no residual hurricane-
related stress compared to 29.5­30.6% SMI and
38.8­46.1% PTSD among respondents with moder-
ate-to-severe stress. If we think of these associations
as causal, the population-attributable risk proportions
of SMI and PTSD due to hurricane-related stress
(that is, the proportions of currently existing SMI
and PTSD that would be expected to remit if all
hurricane-related stress was resolved) are 89.2% for
SMI and 31.9% for PTSD. (Detailed results available
upon request.)
The best-fitting model is different for suicidal
ideation, as baseline stress and stress at follow-up
(both dichotomized to severe-serious vs all others due
to the rarity of the outcome and the nonlinearity of the
association with hurricane-related stress) interact in
predicting trends in suicidal ideation (w4
2 = 7.2,
P = 0.007). The best-fitting model is one that distin-
guishes respondents with severe-serious hurricane-
related stress in one or both surveys vs all others.
An additional complication, though, is that the effect
of stress in this model differs significantly between
the New Orleans Metro sub-sample and the remainder
of the sample (w4
2 = 8.47.2, P = 0.007), with OR
substantially higher among respondents not from the
New Orleans Metro Area (104.1) than from New
Orleans Metro (2.2). The prevalence estimates of
suicidal ideation at follow-up among respondents
with severe-serious hurricane-related stress are 3.1%
in the New Orleans Metro sub-sample and 13.0% in
the remainder of the sample compared to 0.3 and
0.0% among respondents without severe hurricane-
related stress. If we think of these associations as
causal, the population-attributable risk proportion of
suicidal ideation associated with severe-serious hur-
ricane-related stress is 61.6% in the total sample.

Discussion
Four principal limitations of the study need to be
noted. First, mental disorders were estimated with
screening scales rather than with clinical interviews.
It should be noted, though, that the K6 screening scale
has previously been validated21,23,24 and that the
modified TSQ was found to be valid in our clinical
reappraisal study. Nonetheless, screening scales are
inevitably less precise than clinical interviews,
generally leading to associations being attenuated.
Based on this fact, the results reported here about
predictors are likely to be conservative. Second, the
baseline CAG survey response rate was low and the
sampling frame excluded people who were unreach-
able by telephone. These problems presumably led to
the most marginalized segments of the population
being under-represented in the sample, making the

prevalence estimates reported here of anxiety-mood
disorders and hurricane-related stress conservative.
Third, the ratings of hurricane-related stress were
retrospective and subjective, raising concerns about
bias related to current emotional functioning. Fourth,
even though we interpreted the associations between
hurricane-related stress and the outcome measures in
causal terms, it is possible that unmeasured common
causes (for example, pre-hurricane history of psycho-
pathology that influenced stressor exposure and post-
hurricane mental illness) influenced the observed
associations. Caution is consequently needed in
interpreting these associations.
Within the context of these limitations, the pre-
valence estimates of anxiety-mood disorders both at
baseline and in the follow-up survey in the New
Orleans Metro sub-sample are considerably higher
than those found in previous surveys of mental illness
after natural disasters in the United States, while the
prevalence estimates in the remainder of the sample
are comparable to those in previous studies.35,36
Previous reviews have noted that comparisons of
prevalence estimates across disasters is challenging
due to the wide range of disaster experiences to which
people in disasters are exposed. However, broadly
speaking, the higher prevalence estimates of anxiety-
mood disorders in the New Orleans Metro sub-sample
are consistent with the results of studies that
considered persons in highly disaster affected
areas,37,38 while the lower prevalence estimates in
the remainder of the sample are consistent with the
results of previous studies in areas with lower
disaster impact.39,40
The significant increase in prevalence estimates of
SMI, PTSD and suicidal ideation plans are different
from the patterns found in other longitudinal surveys
of mental illness after natural disasters, where
prevalence typically decreases.7­9 As noted in the
Introduction, even in cases where there is no
decrease, the typical pattern is for prevalence to
remain stable for some time rather than to increase
significantly9 The increasing prevalence of SMI,
PTSD and suicidal ideation plans in the CAG is
consequently striking.
The fact that the increases in SMI and PTSD are
confined to respondents not from the New Orleans
Metro Area is difficult to interpret in light of the
higher levels of hurricane-related stress both at base-
line and at follow-up in the New Orleans Metro sub-
sample. It is possible to speculate post hoc that the
much greater media attention directed at New Orleans
than the other areas affected by Katrina might have led
to a greater sense of abandonment among affected
people not from the New Orleans Metro Area, but we
have no data to evaluate this interpretation. Another
possibility is that the increases in SMI, PTSD and
suicidality are partly due to increases in stressors that
might only be indirectly linked to the hurricane. This
possibility is consistent with evidence from several
longitudinal studies that low-intensity ongoing stres-
sors significantly predict long-term PTSD, presumably
because these nagging stressors erode the resistance
resources that would otherwise promote recovery.41,42
However, it is unclear why such stressors might be
more prevalent among people not from the New
Orleans Metro Area than from New Orleans Metro.
Finally, there is the possibility that psychological
vulnerability to such stressors is higher among people
not from the New Orleans Metro Area and that this
heightened vulnerability explains why the increases
in SMI and PTSD documented here were confined to
this sub-sample. Exactly this kind of difference was
found in our analysis of the association between
residual hurricane-related stress and suicidal ideation.
However, caution is needed in interpreting this result
due to the small number of respondents with suicidal
ideation and the wide confidence interval of the
estimated OR in the sub-sample of respondents not
from New Orleans Metro.
The findings that young people, people with low
socio-economic status and people who were geogra-
phically displaced are at comparatively high risk of
anxiety-mood disorders and are consistent with
previously documented correlates of mental illness
after disasters35,36 and other traumas.43 Importantly,
though, these associations are modest in magnitude,
suggesting that the mental illness associated with
Hurricane Katrina is distributed across the full range
of the socio-demographic spectrum of the affected
population. It is noteworthy in this regard that the
significant upward trends in SMI, PTSD and suicid-
ality were found to be unrelated to sex, race/ethnicity,
education and health insurance status.
These results lead to four conclusions. First,
hurricane-related stress clearly is playing a critical
role in the high prevalence of hurricane-related
anxiety-mood disorders in this population. Second,
the fact that the associations between these stresses
and the mental health outcomes considered here were
stronger among affected people from areas other than
the New Orleans Metro Area suggests that undeter-
mined stress and/or vulnerability factors are present
among people from areas other than New Orleans
Metro that should lead policy makers to focus special
attention on the needs of these people. It is note-
worthy that the opposite pattern was found in an
earlier analysis of anxiety-mood disorders in the
baseline survey, where effects of the stressors that
occurred during the hurricane and the immediate
aftermath were stronger in the New Orleans Metro
sub-sample than the remainder of the sample.3 It is
unclear why this geographic variation has reversed in
the subsequent year. Third, the observation that these
adverse effects are only weakly related to socio-
demographic variables means that efforts to address
the needs for mental health treatment in this popula-
tion need to deal with all segments of the population
rather than target only specific high-risk population
segments. Fourth, the fact that hurricane-related
stressors were still quite common in the population
at the time of our follow-up assessment, which
occurred nearly 2 years after the hurricane, and that
Psychiatric trends after Hurricane Katrina

high proportions of the outcomes at follow-up were
attributable to these continuing stresses suggests that
efforts to address the problem of increased mental
illness and suicidal ideation-plans among people
affected by Hurricane Katrina will require efficient
provision of practical and logistical assistance to deal
with the high remaining levels of stress. This may be
particularly challenging when it comes to helping
pre-hurricane residents of the affected areas who are
now living elsewhere in the country, but it is
especially important to reach these geographically
displaced people because of their comparatively high
risk of SMI.
