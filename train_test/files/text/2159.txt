This article studies whether conformism behavior affects individual outcomes
in crime. We present a social network model of peer effects with ex ante
heterogeneous agents and show how conformism and deterrence affect
criminal activities. We then bring the model to the data by using a very detailed
data set of adolescent friendship networks. A novel social network­based
empirical strategy allows us to identify peer effects for different types of crimes.
We find that conformity plays an important role for all crimes, especially for
petty crimes. This suggests that, for juvenile crime, an effective policy should
be measured not only by the possible crime reduction it implies but also by
the group interactions it engenders. (JEL A14, C21, D85, K42, Z13)
1. Introduction
A large literature has developed on the general causes of, and the impact of
public policy on, crime. Yet, no consensus has emerged on quite basic issues,
such as, for example, the effects of incentives, both positive and negative, on
crime.
Juvenile crime is an important aspect of this debate. According to the US
Department of Justice, juveniles were involved in 16% of all violent arrests
and 32% of all property crime arrests in 1999. In addition, more than 100,000
juveniles are held in residential placement on any given day in the United

States. However, despite these figures, there are still many unanswered
questions about juvenile crime. Some have shown that deterrence has a nega-
tive impact on juvenile crime (Levitt 1998; Mocan and Rees 2005). It has also
been shown that crime committed by younger people have higher degrees of
social interactions (Glaeser et al. 1996; Jacob and Lefgren 2003; Patacchini
and Zenou 2008).1
There is indeed a growing literature in economics suggesting that peer ef-
fects are very strong in criminal decisions. Case and Katz (1991), using data
from the 1989 National Bureau of Economic Research survey of youths living
in low-income Boston neighborhoods, find that the behaviors of neighborhood
peers appear to substantially affect criminal activities of youth behaviors. They
find that the direct effect of moving a youth with given family and personal
characteristics to a neighborhood where 10% more of the youths are involved
in crime than in his/her initial neighborhood is to raise the probability that
the youth will become involved in crime by 2.3%. Ludwig et al. (2001) and
Kling et al. (2005) explore this last result by using data from the moving to op-
portunity (MTO) experiment that relocates families from high- to low-poverty
neighborhoods. They find that this policy reduces juvenile arrests for violent
offences by 30%­50% as compared to the control group. This also suggests
very strong social interactions in crime behaviors. Patacchini and Zenou (2008)
test the role of weak ties2 in explaining criminal activities, revealing that weak
ties have a statistically significant and positive effect both on the probability
to commit crime and on its level. Finally, Bayer et al. (2009) consider the in-
fluence that juvenile offenders serving time in the same correctional facility
have on each other's subsequent criminal behavior. They find strong evidence
of peer effects in criminal activities since exposure to peers with a history of
committing a particular crime increases the probability that an individual who
has already committed the same type of crime recidivates with that crime.
The aim of the present article is to analyze the role of conformism in
juvenile crime using a network perspective. There are two important challenges
in the empirics of social interactions: (a) the assessment of the existence of the
endogenous effect of peers and (b) the explanation of how peers influence each
other, that is, the mechanism generating such social interactions.3
We first present a social network model where individual utility depends
on conformism. Conformism is the idea that the easiest and hence best life
is attained by doing one's very best to blend in with one's surroundings and
to do nothing eccentric or out of the ordinary in any way. It may well be
1. In the crime literature, the positive correlation between self-reported delinquency and the
number of delinquent friends reported by adolescents has proven to be among the strongest and
one of the most consistently reported findings (see, e.g., Warr 1996, 2002; Matsueda and Anderson
1998; Haynie 2001).
2. Weak ties are defined in terms of lack of overlap in personal networks between any two
agents; that is, weak ties refer to a network of acquaintances who are less likely to be socially
involved with one another (see, in particular, Granovetter 1973).
3. See, in particular, the special issue on peer effects in the Journal of Applied Econometrics
(Durlauf and Moffitt 2003).

best expressed in the old saying, "When in Rome, do as the Romans do."
To be more specific, using an explicit network analysis,4 we develop a model
where conformism5 associated with deterrence is the key determinant of crim-
inal activities. Our model is as follows. Each criminal belongs to a group of
best friends and derives utility from exerting crime effort. We have a standard
costs/benefits structure a la Becker with an added element, conformism. The
new aspect of this model is that the social norm is endogenous and depends on
the structure of the network. Indeed, direct friends define a social norm, and
depending of the location in the network, each individual has a different refer-
ence group. The utility function is such that each individual wants to minimize
the social distance between his/her crime level and that of his/her reference
group.
We derive the Nash equilibrium of this game and obtain that, when in-
dividuals are ex ante heterogenous (e.g., different race, sex, parents' educa-
tion, etc.), they provide effort proportional to that of their reference group of
best friends and that deterrence reduces crime.6 An interesting result is that,
when individuals are ex ante identical, that is, differ only by their location in
the network, then, in equilibrium, all agents provide the same effort level. In
other words, the Bonacich centrality index7 is the same for all individuals
in the network. This is a surprising result since Ballester et al. (2006), us-
ing a similar social network model but without conformism, find that, when
individuals are ex ante identical, each of them will provide a different effort
level depending on his/her location in the network (as measured by his/her
Bonacich index). Our result is due to the fact that the cost of deviating from
the norm is sufficiently high so that individuals behave identically in equilib-
rium. However, when an additional heterogeneity is introduced (apart from
the location of the network, individuals are heterogenous in their ability of
committing crime, which is correlated with their idiosyncratic characteristics),
4. There is a growing literature on networks in economics. See the recent literature surveys by
Goyal (2007) and Jackson (2007, 2008).
5. In economics, different aspects of conformism and social norms have been explored from a
theoretical point of view. To name a few, (a) peer pressures and partnerships (Kandel and Lazear
1992) where peer pressure arises when individuals deviate from a well-established group norm, for
example, individuals are penalized for working less than the group norm, (b) religion (Iannaccone
1992; Berman 2000) since praying is much more satisfying the more average participants there are,
and (c) social status and social distance (Akerlof 1980, 1997; Bernheim 1994; Battu et al. 2007,
among others) where deviations from the social norm (average action) imply a loss of reputation
and status.
6. In this model, we assume that benefits of crime always outweigh the costs. In the case of
ex ante heterogeneities, one could have a two-stage game, where in the first stage, people decide
to become criminal or not and then, in the second stage, only those who decide to be criminal
(i.e., all individuals for which the benefits of crime are lower than the costs) will be embedded
in a network. This will not affect the main results since we will work on a subset of people who
are criminals. This is because, in our utility function, only criminals affect other criminals, which
means that for noncriminals, the social network does not play any role.
7. To be more precise, the Bonacich centrality measure takes into account both direct and
indirect friends of each individual but puts less weight to distant friends.
4 The Journal of Law, Economics, & Organization, V28 N1
individuals deviate from the social norm and behave partly according to their
ability.
This theoretical model is along the lines of the growing literature on the
social aspects of crime. In Sah (1991), the social setting affects the individual
perception of the costs of crime and is thus conducive to a higher or a lower
sense of impunity. In Glaeser et al. (1996), criminal interconnections act as a
social multiplier on aggregate crime. Calv´
o-Armengol and Zenou (2004) and
Ballester et al. (2006, 2010) develop social network models of pure peer effects
and no conformism.8,9
We then test our model using the US National Longitudinal Survey of Ado-
lescent Health (AddHealth), which contains unique detailed information on
friendship relationships among delinquent teenagers. Empirical tests of mod-
els of social interactions are quite problematic because of well-known issues
that render the identification and measurement of peer effects quite difficult:
(a) reflection, which is a particular case of simultaneity (Manski 1993), and
(b) endogeneity, which may arise for both peer self-selection and unobserved
common (group) correlated effects.
In this article, we exploit the architecture of social networks to overcome this
set of problems and to achieve the identification of endogenous peer effects.
More specifically, in social networks, each agent has a different peer group,
that is, different friends with whom each teenager directly interacts. This fea-
ture of social networks guarantees the presence of excluded friends from the
reference group (peer group) of each agent, which are however included in
the reference group of his/her best (direct) friends. This identification strat-
egy is similar in spirit to the one used in the standard simultaneous equation
model, where at least one exogenous variable needs to be excluded from each
equation. In addition, because we observe individuals over networks, we can
use a specification of the empirical model with a network-specific component.
By doing so, we are able to control for the presence of network-specific un-
observed factors affecting both individual and peer behaviors. Such factors
might be important omitted variables driving the sorting of agents into net-
works or effects arising from unobservable shocks that affect the network as
a whole. Such an approach proves also useful to tackle one further empirical
concern stemming from the fact that each agent's peer group (rather than the
whole network) might be affected by common unobservable factors. Indeed,
once our particularly large information on individual (observed) variables and
network characteristics are taken into account, (within-network) linking deci-
sions appear uncorrelated with peer group­level observables. Finally, the va-
riety of questions in the AddHealth questionnaire allows us to find observable
8. The difference between our present model and these three models are discussed in detail at
the end of Section 2.2 below.
9. Linking social interactions with crime has also been done in dynamic general equilibrium
models (
Imrohoro
glu et al. 2000; Lochner 2004) and in search-theoretic frameworks (Burdett et al.
2003, 2004; Huang et al. 2004). Other related contributions on the social aspects of crime include
Silverman (2004), Verdier and Zenou (2004), Calv´
o-Armengol et al. (2007), and Ferrer (2010).
Juvenile Delinquency and Conformism 5
proxies for typically unobserved individual characteristics that are commonly
believed to induce self-selection (ability, leadership propensity, parental care,
etc.). The addition of "school dummies" is used to control for school-specific
inputs.
Observe that school dummies also account for differences in the strictness
of anticrime regulations across schools as well as for local crime policies.
The identification of deterrence effects on crime is a difficult empirical ex-
ercise because of the well-known potential simultaneity and reverse causality
issues (Levitt 1997), which cannot totally be solved using our network-based
approach. We avoid to directly estimate such effects (i.e., to include in the
model specification observable measures of deterrence, such as local police
expenditures or the arrest rate in the local area). Rather, we focus our attention
on the estimation of peer effects on crime, once deterrence effects have been
controlled for.
This strategy leads to the following main findings: Conformity plays an im-
portant role in explaining criminal behavior of adolescents, especially for petty
crimes. Specifically, a one standard deviation (SD) increase in individual i's
taste for conformity or equivalently in the average criminal activity of individ-
ual i's reference group raises individual i's level of crime by about 5.2% of a
SD when total crime is considered. It ranges from 9.8 to 1.4 moving from petty
crimes to more serious crimes.
The analysis of peer effects is, however, a complex issue, and our analysis
has obviously some limitations. First, our model is only one of the possible
mechanisms generating such externalities. It is not, however, rejected by our
data and highlight the importance of network topology in explaining criminal
activities. Second, in the absence of experimental data, one can never be sure
to have captured all the behavioral intricacies that lead individuals to associate
with others. Nevertheless, by using both within- and between-network varia-
tions and by taking advantage of the unusually large information on teenagers'
behavior provided by our data set, our analysis is one of the best attempts to
overcome the empirical difficulties.
The rest of the article can be described as followed. In Section 2, we derive
our main theoretical results. Section 3 describes the data and the empirical
strategy. In Section 4, we present our empirical results, both for all crimes and
for each type of crime. Section 5 checks the sensitivity of our results when the
actual directions of the friendship nominations are exploited. Finally, Section 6
concludes.
2. Theory
2.1 The Basic Model
There are N individuals/criminals in the economy.
2.1.1 The Network. N = {1,...,n} is a finite set of agents. The n-square ad-
jacency matrix G of a network g keeps track of the direct connections in this
network. Here, two players i and j are directly connected (i.e., best friends) in
6 The Journal of Law, Economics, & Organization, V28 N1
g if and only if gij = 1, and gij = 0, otherwise. Given that friendship is a
reciprocal relationship, we set gij = gji.10 We also set gii = 0. The set of
individual i's best friends (direct connections) is Ni(g) = {j = i | gij = 1},
which is of size gi i.e., gi = n
j=1
gij is the number of direct links of
individual i . This means in particular that, if i and j are best friends, then in
general Ni(g) = Nj(g) unless the graph/network is complete (i.e., each
individual is friend with everybody in the network). This also implies that
groups of friends may overlap if individuals have common best friends. To
summarize, the reference group of each individual i is Ni(g), that is, the set of
his/her best friends, which does not include himself/herself.
Let ij = gij/gi, for i = j, and set ii = 0. By construction, 0 ij 1. Note
that 

 is a row normalization of the initial friendship network g, as illustrated in
the following example, where G and 

 are the adjacency matrices of, respec-
tively, g and 

.
Example 1. Consider the following friendship network g:
2 1 3
Then,
G =



0 1 1
1 0 0
1 0 0


 and 

 =



0 1/2 1/2
1 0 0
1 0 0


.
2.1.2 Preferences. We focus on adolescent crime and we denote by ei(g)
the crime effort level of criminal i in network g. We also denote
by ei(g) the average crime effort of the gi best friends of i, which is
given by
ei(g) =
1
gi
j=n

j=1
gijej. (1)
From now on, when there is no risk of confusion, we drop the argument g.
Each individual/criminal selects an effort ei 0 and obtains a payoff u(ei,ei)
given by the following utility function:11
ui(ei,ei) = a+biei - pei f -ce2
i -d(ei -ei)2 (2)
with a,c,d > 0 and bi > 0 for all i.
10. This is not an important assumption since all our theoretical results hold even when gij =
gji. We discuss this issue in Section 5.
11. Crime effort ei could mean different things, but here ei is the frequency of crime rather than
actually taking the time to plan and not get caught. This is why the assumption that the probability
of being caught is increasing with effort makes sense in the utility function.
Juvenile Delinquency and Conformism 7
This utility has a standard cost/benefit structure (as in Becker 1968). The
proceeds from crime are given by a+bi ei and are increasing in own effort ei.
There is an ex ante idiosyncratic heterogeneity, bi, which captures the
fact that individuals differ in their ability (or productivity) of committing crime.
Indeed, for a given effort level ei, the higher bi, the higher the productiv-
ity and thus the higher the booty a + bi ei. Observe that bi is assumed to be
deterministic, perfectly observable by all individuals in the network and corre-
sponds to the observable characteristics of individual i (like, e.g., sex, race,
age, parental education, etc.) and to the observable average characteristics
of individual i's best friends, that is, average level of parental education
of i's friends, etc. (contextual effects). To be more precise, bi can be
written as
bi(x) =
M

m=1
mxm
i +
1
gi
M

m=1
n

j=1
mgijxm
j , (3)
where xm
i
is a set of M variables accounting for observable differences in
individual, neighborhood, and school characteristics of individual i and m,m
are parameters. This form is only adopted for the ease of the empirical
implementation.
The costs of committing crime are captured by the probability to be caught
pei, which increases with own effort ei, as the apprehension probability in-
creases with one's involvement in crime, times the fine f, that is, the sever-
ity of the punishment. Also, as it is now quite standard (see, e.g., Verdier
and Zenou 2004; Conley and Wang 2006), individuals have a moral cost of
committing crime equal to ce2
i
, which is reflected here by their degree of
honesty c.12 So the higher c, the higher the moral cost and it increases with
crime effort.
Finally, the new element in this utility function is the last term
d (ei - ei)2, which reflects the influence of friends' behavior on own action.
It is such that each individual wants to minimize the social distance between
himself/herself and his/her reference group, where d is the parameter
describing the taste for conformity. Indeed, the individual loses utility d(ei -
ei)2 from failing to conform to others. This is the standard way economists
have been modeling conformity (see, among others, Akerlof 1980, 1997,
Bernheim 1994, Kandel and Lazear 1992; Fershtman and Weiss 1998). We can
analyze the bilateral influences of this utility function. They are
given by
2ui(ei,ei)
ei
ej
=









-2(c+d) < 0 when i = j;
0 when i = j and gij = 0;
2d > 0 when i = j and gij = 1.
12. Assuming different degrees of honesty ci would not change any of our results.
8 The Journal of Law, Economics, & Organization, V28 N1
Since, when i = j, 2d > 0, an increase in effort from j triggers an upward
shift in i's response and thus efforts are strategic complements from i's per-
spective within the pair (i, j).
Observe that beyond the idiosyncratic heterogeneity, bi, there is a second
type of heterogeneity, referred to as peer heterogeneity, which captures the
differences between individuals due to network effects. Here, it means that in-
dividuals have different types of friends and thus different reference groups ei.
As a result, the social norm each individual i faces is endogenous and depends
on his/her location in the network as well as the structure of the network. In-
deed, in a star-shaped network (as the one described in Figure 1) where each
individual is at most distance 2 from each other, the value of the social norm
will be very different than a circle network, where the distance between indi-
viduals can be very large.
2.2 A Simple Symmetric Case
In this section, we assume that, ex ante, all individuals/criminals are identical,
that is, same ex ante idiosyncratic heterogeneity, so that bi = b.13 This of course
does not mean that they have the same peer heterogeneity since individuals
have different reference groups. We can calculate the Nash equilibrium of this
game where each individual chooses ei by taking as given the actions of the
other players. We have the following result.
Proposition 1. Assume that bi = b and b > pf. Then the conformity game
with payoffs given by (equation 2) has a unique Nash equilibrium in pure
strategies, which is equal to
e
i = e
i =
b- p f
2c
. (4)
In particular, the higher the deterrence, the lower the crime level.
Proof. See Appendix A.
This is an interesting result. It says that, even if individuals are ex ante het-
erogeneous because of their location in the network and thus have different
reference groups and social norms (peer heterogeneity), in a conformist equi-
librium where each individual would like to conform as much as possible to the
norm of his/her reference group, all individuals will exert the same effort level.
The equilibrium effort e
i
is increasing in the booty b, decreasing in the deter-
rence pf and in the disutility of committing crime c. In other words, ex ante
heterogeneity and the distribution (in particular the variance) of population do
not matter in a conformist equilibrium even if it does ex ante. It is really the
average that plays a crucial role in this model. This contrasts with the results
13. We relax these assumptions in Section 2.3.
Juvenile Delinquency and Conformism 9
of Ballester et al. (2006)14 who find that, when the utility function has not this
conformism component, ex ante heterogenous agents are ex post heterogenous
in terms of outcomes.
Let us explain in more detail why in this model the location in the net-
work does not matter for equilibrium effort, whereas it does in Ballester et al.
(2006).
The model of Ballester et al. (2006) is the so-called local aggregate model
where peer (social network) effects enter in the utility function as follows:
ui(ei,g) = a+bi ei - pei f -ce2
i
own concavity
+ d
n

j=1
gijeiej
local aggregate peer effects
. (5)
It is thus the sum of the efforts of his/her peers, that is, n
j=1
gijeiej, that
affects the utility of individual i. So the more delinquent i has criminal friends
and the more active they are, the higher is his/her utility. On the contrary, in
the so-called local average model (our model), the utility function is given
by equation (2). In that case, it is the deviation from the average of the ef-
forts of his/her peers that affects the utility of individual i. So the closer is
i's effort from the average of his/her friends' efforts, the higher is his/her
utility.
Consequently, the two models are quite different. From a pure technical
point of view, the adjacency matrix G of direct links of the initial network
totally characterizes the peer effects in the local aggregate model, whereas it
is a transformation of this matrix G to a weighted stochastic matrix 

 that
characterizes the peer effects in the local average model.
Given these two aspects, the result of Proposition 1 is not that surprising.
Indeed, in both models, it has been shown that the Nash equilibrium effort
of each individual is proportional to his/her (Bonacich) centrality in the net-
work (Ballester et al. 2006). In the local aggregate model, even if individ-
uals are ex ante identical (i.e., same own concavity), their position in the
network is different, which means that their (Bonacich) centrality is also
different. Since the latter is basically characterized by the matrix G,15 then
each individual will exert a different effort since he/she has a different position
in the network. On the contrary, in the local average model, if individuals
are ex ante identical and even if their position in the network is different,
their (Bonacich) centrality will be the same because it is defined by the matrix
14. And also Calv´
o-Armengol and Zenou (2004) and Ballester et al. (2010).
15. To be more precise, the vector of Bonacich centralities in the local aggregate model


lag(,g) is given by


lag(,g) =
+

k=0
kGk1,
where 1 is a vector of one.
10 The Journal of Law, Economics, & Organization, V28 N1


 and not by G, where 

 is a row normalization matrix of G.16 From an
economic viewpoint, in the local aggregate model, different positions in the
network imply different effort levels because it is the sum of efforts that
matter, whereas in the local average model, the position in the network does
not matter since it is the deviation from the average effort of friends that affects
the utility.
Take, for example, the star-shaped network with three individuals in Exam-
ple 1. In the local aggregate model, individual 1 will exert the highest effort
since he/she has two direct friends and will thus receive high local comple-
mentarities, given by e2 + e3, whereas the two other individuals has only one
friend and each will only receive e1. In the local average model, this is not any-
more true since the peer effect component of individual 1 is - e1 - e2+e3
2
2
,
whereas for individuals 2 and 3, we have - e2 - e1
2
2
and - e3 - e1
2
2
, re-
spectively. The differences in the direct links are already small, and, in equilib-
rium, where both direct and indirect links are taken into account (through the
Bonacich centralities), these peer effect aspects turn out to be the same for all
individuals in the network.
2.3 The General Model
Let us generalize this theoretical model for the case of ex ante heterogenous
individuals in terms of bi. We have the following result.
Proposition 2. Consider the general case when all individuals have ex ante
idiosyncratic and peer heterogeneities and different tastes for conformity. As-
sume that bi > pf for all i. Then there exists a unique Nash equilibrium where
each individual i provides the following crime effort:
e
i =

, (6)
which is increasing with the average crime effort of the reference group ei,

is given by

where the second equality is shown in the proof of Proposition 1 in Appendix A.

Furthermore, for a given ei, this equilibrium crime effort e
i
is increasing
with ex ante heterogeneity bi and decreasing with deterrence pf,
e

< 0, (8)
whereas its relationship with the taste for conformity d is ambiguous since

Proof. See Appendix A.
The previous result of Proposition 1 does not hold anymore since there are
now both idiosyncratic and peer heterogeneities. We find that individuals will
provide criminal effort proportional to their reference group ei (see equation
(7)) and to their ex ante idiosyncratic heterogeneity bi (see equation (8)). Also,
deterrence pf will negatively affect the crime effort (see equation (8)). Thus,
not surprisingly, Proposition 2 shows that the only Nash equilibrium is asym-
metric since each individual provides different crime efforts. Furthermore, the
effect of the taste for conformity d on equilibrium crime effort e
i
is ambiguous
because there are two opposite effects. On the one hand, higher d increases e
i
because of higher peer effects. On the other, higher d decreases e
i
because of
a higher chance to be caught. As a result, as can been seen in equation (9), if
the first effect dominates the second one, then the relationship between d and
e
i
is positive.
3. Data and Empirical Strategy
3.1 Data
Our data source is the National Longitudinal Survey of Adolescent Health
(AddHealth), which contains detailed information on a nationally represen-
tative sample of 90,118 students in roughly 130 private and public schools, en-
tering grades 7­12 in the 1994­1995 school year.17 AddHealth contains unique
information on friendship relationships, which is crucial for our analysis. The
friendship information is based upon actual friends' nominations. Pupils were
asked to identify their best friends from a school roster (up to five males and
five females).18 A link exists between two friends if at least one of the two
individuals has identified the other as his/her best friend.19
17. For a detailed description of the survey and data, see the AddHealth Web site at http://www.
cpc.unc.edu/projects/addhealth.
18. The limit in the number of nominations is not binding, not even by gender. Less than 1%
of the students in our sample show a list of 10 best friends, less than 3% a list of five males
and roughly 4% name five females. On average, they declare to have 6.04 friends with a small
dispersion around this mean value (SD equal to 1.32).
19. Note that, when an individual i identifies a best friend j who does not belong to the sur-
veyed schools, the database does not include j in the network of i; it provides no information
about j. Fortunately, in the large majority of cases (more than 93%), best friends tend to be in the
same school and thus are systematically included in the network.

Figure 1. The Empirical Distribution of Adolescent Networks.
Figure 1 shows the empirical distribution of friendship networks in our sam-
ple by their size (i.e., the number of network members).20 It appears that most
friendship networks have between 36 and 74 members. The minimum number
of friends in a network is 18, whereas the maximum is 88. The average and the
SD of network size are 49.51 and 16.80.
By matching the identification numbers of the friendship nominations to
respondents' identification numbers, one can obtain information on the char-
acteristics of nominated friends.
Besides information on family background, school quality, and area of res-
idence, the AddHealth contains sensitive data on sexual behavior (contracep-
tion, pregnancy, and AIDS risk perception), tobacco, alcohol, drugs, and crime
of a subset of adolescents. We use these data to construct our dependent vari-
able ei. AddHealth contains an extensive set of questions on juvenile delin-
quency, ranging from light offenses that only signal the propensity toward a
delinquent behavior to serious property and violent crime.21 First, we adopt
the standard approach in the sociological literature to derive an index of delin-
quency involvement based on self-reported adolescents' responses to a set of
questions describing participation in a series of criminal activities. The sur-
vey asks students how often they participate in each of the different activities
during the past year.22 Each response is coded using an ordinal scale ranging
20. The histograms show on the horizontal axes the percentiles of the empirical distribution of
network component members corresponding to the percentages 1, 5, 10, 25, 50, 75, 90, 95, 100,
and in the vertical axes the number of networks having number of members between the i and i-1
percentile.
21. Specifically, it contains information on 15 delinquency items. Namely, paint graffiti or
signs on someone else's property or in a public place; deliberately damage property that did not
belong to you; lie to your parents or guardians about where you had been or whom you were with;
take something from a store without paying for it; get into a serious physical fight; hurt someone
badly enough to need bandages or care from a doctor or nurse; run away from home; drive a car
without its owner's permission; steal something worth more than $50; go into a house or building
to steal something; use or threaten to use a weapon to get something from someone; sell marijuana
or other drugs; steal something worth less than $50; take part in a fight where a group of your
friends was against another group; act loud, rowdy, or unruly in a public place.
22. Respondents listened to pre-recorded questions through earphones and then they entered
their answers directly on laptop computers. This administration of the survey for sensitive topics
minimizes the potential for interview and parental influence while maintaining data security.
Juvenile Delinquency and Conformism 13
from 0 (i.e., never participate) to 1 (i.e., participate one or two times), 2 (par-
ticipate three or four times) up to 3 (i.e., participate five or more times). On
the basis of these variables, a composite score is calculated for each respon-
dent.23 The mean is 1.03, with considerable variation around this value (the SD
is equal to 1.22). The Crombach- measure is then used to assess the quality
of the derived index. In our case, we obtain an  equal to 0.76 (0  1)
indicating that the different items incorporated in the index have consider-
able internal consistency. Second, in Section 4.2 we consider different cate-
gories of crime, which are chosen accordingly to the seriousness of the crime
committed. Using the corresponding information for nominated friends, we
are able, for each individual i, to calculate the average crime effort ei of his/her
peer group. Excluding the individuals with missing or inadequate informa-
tion, we obtain a final sample of 9322 students distributed over 166
networks.24
3.2 Empirical Strategy
Guided by Proposition 2, our aim is to assess the actual empirical relationship
between the group criminal effort ei and individual effort level e
i
(comparative
statics result; equation (7)).
The main novel feature of our estimation with respect to previous works is
the use of the architecture of networks to evaluate peer effects. Let us explain
this more clearly.
3.2.1 Reflection Problem. In linear-in-means models, simultaneity in behav-
ior of interacting agents introduces a perfect collinearity between the expected
mean outcome of the group and its mean characteristics. Therefore, it is dif-
ficult to differentiate between the effect of peers' choice of effort and peers'
characteristics that do impact on their effort choice (the so-called reflection
problem; Manski 1993). Basically, the reflection problem arises because, in
the standard approach, individuals interact in groups, that is, individuals are
affected by all individuals belonging to their group and by nobody outside the
group. In other words, groups do overlap. In the case of social networks, in-
stead, this is nearly never true since the reference group is the number of friends
each individual has. So, for example, take individuals i and k such that gik = 1.
Then individual i is directly influenced by gi = ni
j=1
gijej, whereas individual
k is directly influenced by gk = nk
j=1
gk jej, and there is little chance for these
two values to be the same unless the network is complete (i.e., everybody is
linked with everybody). Formally, social effects are identified (i.e., no reflec-
tion problem) if G2 = 0, where G2 keeps track of indirect connections of length
23. This is a standard factor analysis, where the factor loadings of the different variables are
used to derive the total score.
24. The networks include both criminals and noncriminals.
14 The Journal of Law, Economics, & Organization, V28 N1
2 in g.25 This condition guarantees that I, G and G2 are linearly independent.
G2 = 0 means that there exist at least a path of length 2 between two individ-
uals.26 In other words, if i and j are friends and j and k are friends, it does not
necessarily imply that i and k are also friends. Even in linear-in-means models,
the Manski's (1993) reflection problem is thus eluded. These results are for-
mally derived in Bramoull´
e et al. (2009) (see, in particular, Proposition 3) and
used in Calv´
o-Armengol et al. (2009). Cohen-Cole (2006) presents a similar
argument, that is, the use of outgroup effects, to achieve the identification of
the endogenous group effect in the linear-in-means model (see also Weinberg
et al. 2004; Lin 2008; Laschever 2009).
3.2.2 Endogenous Network Formation/Correlated Effects. Although this set-
ting allows us to solve the reflection problem, the estimation results might still
be flawed because of the presence of unobservable factors affecting both in-
dividual and peer behavior. It is thus difficult to disentangle the endogenous
peer effects from the correlated effects, that is, from effects arising from the
fact that individuals in the same group tend to behave similarly because they
face a common environment. If individuals are not randomly assigned into
groups, this problem might originate from the possible sorting of agents. If
the variables that drive this process of selection are not fully observable, po-
tential correlations between (unobserved) group-specific factors and the target
regressors are major sources of bias. In our case, two types of possibly corre-
lated effects arise, that is, at the network level and at the peer group level. The
use of network fixed effects proves useful in this respect. Assume, indeed, that
agents self-select into different networks in a first step and that link formation
takes place within networks in a second step. Then, as Bramoull´
e et al. (2009)
observe, if linking decisions are uncorrelated with the observable variables,
this two-step model of link formation generates network fixed effects. Assum-
ing additively separable network heterogeneity, a within-group specification
is able to control for these correlated effects. In other words, we use a model
specification with a network-specific component of the error term and adopt
a traditional (pseudo) panel data fixed-effects estimator, namely, we subtract
from the individual-level variables the network average.27
25. The coefficient g[2]
ij
in the (i, j) cell of G2 gives the number of paths of length 2 in g between
i and j.
26. It is extremely rare that in the real world the condition G2 = 0 is not satisfied since it would
basically imply that all networks are complete. In our data set, where 166 networks are considered
(see above in Section 3.1), none of them are complete and all satisfy the condition that guarantees
the identification of social effects.
27. Bramoull´
e et al. (2009) also deal with this problem in the context of networks. In their
Proposition 5, they show that if the matrices I, G, G2, and G3 are linearly independent, then
by subtracting from the variables the network component average (or the average over neigh-
bors, i.e., direct friends) social effects are again identified and one can disentangle endogenous
effects from correlated effects. In our data set, this condition of linear independence is always
satisfied.
Juvenile Delinquency and Conformism 15
Observe that our particularly large information on individual (observed)
variables should reasonably explain the process of selection into groups. Then
the inclusion of network fixed effects acts as a further control for possible sort-
ing effects based on unobservables.
To document to what extent this approach accounts for self-selection in our
case, we need to provide evidence that (a) network fixed effects account for
unobservable factors driving the allocations of agents into networks and (b)
once observables and network fixed effects are controlled for linking decisions
are uncorrelated with peer-level observables. In other words, (b) should show
that, conditional upon network fixed effects, student and peer characteristics
are orthogonal, thus indicating that peer group formation is random conditional
upon network.
We thus consider individual variables that are commonly believed to induce
self-selection into teenagers' friendship groups and perform two different
exercises. First, we estimate the correlations between such individual-level
variables and the network averages of the residuals obtained from a regres-
sion analysis where the influence of a variety of other factors (see Table B1,
Appendix B, for a precise description of variables) and network fixed effects
are washed out. Second, we estimate the correlations between such individual-
level variables and peer group averages (i.e., averages over best friends), once
the influence of our extensive set of controls and network fixed effects are
washed out. The results are reported in Table 1 (in the second and third columns,
respectively).28 The estimated correlation coefficients are not statistically sig-
nificant for all attributes considered in both columns. This indicates that, in our
case, (a) the particularly large information on individual (observed) variables
and (additively separable) unobserved network characteristics account for a
possible sorting of students into networks and (b) conditionally on individual
and network characteristics, linking decisions are uncorrelated with observable
variables.29
28. More formally, in the first exercise, we estimate the ordinary least square (OLS) residuals
from the equation

is the set of the average values of the M controls of i's
direct friends, k denote network fixed effects, and ik the random error term. We then report in the
first column of Table 1 the OLS estimates that are obtained when regressing yi,
on the residuals
ik averaged over networks. In the second column, instead, we report the estimated ms associated
to xm
j,
= yi,.
29. The architecture of social networks with nonoverlapping groups also offers the opportunity
for instrumental variable estimation to control for peer group correlated effects. Since individual
k /
 gi, the characteristics of k do not directly affect ei (i's outcome) but, since k  gj, they affect
ej (j's outcome), and since j  gi, ej affects ei. As a result, the characteristics of k affects ei only
indirectly through its effect on ej. This means that the characteristics of k are a valid instrument
to estimate the endogenous social effect for ei. We experimented with different sets of instruments

3.2.3 Correlated Individual Effects. Finally, one might question the presence
of problematic unobservable factors that are neither network specific nor peer
group specific, but rather individual specific. In this respect, the richness of the
information provided by the AddHealth questionnaire on adolescents' behav-
ior allow us to find proxies for typically unobserved individual characteristics
that may be correlated with our variable of interest. Specifically, to control
for differences in leadership propensity across adolescents, we include an in-
dicator of self-esteem and an indicator of the level of physical development
compared to the peers, and we use mathematics score as an indicator of abil-
ity. Also, we attempt to capture differences in attitude toward education and
parenting by including indicators of the student's motivation in education and
parental care.
3.2.4 Correlated School Effects. Similar arguments can be put forward for
the existence of possible correlations between our variable of interest and
(different characteristics of excluded friends), but our results, that is, our estimates of peer effects,
remain always qualitatively unchanged.
Juvenile Delinquency and Conformism 17
unobservable school characteristics affecting structure and/or quality of school-
friendship networks in analyzing students' school performance. Because the
AddHealth survey interviews all children within a school, we estimate our
model conditional on school fixed effects (i.e., we incorporate in the estimation
school dummies). This approach enables us to capture the influence of school-
level inputs (such as teachers and students quality, and possibly the parents'
residential choices), so that only the variation in the average behavior of peers
(across students in the same school) would be exploited.30
3.2.5 Deterrence Effects. So far in this section, we have focused our atten-
tion on the main purpose of our empirical analysis, which is to be found in the
identification of peer effects and conformism in crime using the network archi-
tecture. The identification of deterrence effects (pf in our theoretical model)
on crime is an equally difficult empirical exercise because of the well-known
potential simultaneity and reverse causality issues (Levitt 1997), which cannot
be totally solved using our network-based empirical strategy. School dummies,
however, also account for differences in the strictness of anticrime regulations
across schools (i.e., differences in the expected punishment for a student who
is caught possessing illegal drug, stealing school property, verbally abusing a
teacher, etc.) as well as for differences in crime policies at the local level (be-
cause schools are in different areas). As a result, instead of directly estimating
deterrence effects (i.e., to include in the model specification observable mea-
sures of deterrence, such as local police expenditures or the arrest rate in the
local area), we focus our attention on the estimation of peer effects in crime, ac-
counting for observable and unobservable school, and hence area-of-residence,
variables (such as policing practicing, ethnic concentration, low informal so-
cial control, lack of educational or economic opportunities, etc.) that might be
correlated with our variable of interest.

each individual i, and our measure of taste for conformity or strength of peer
effects is captured by the parameter  (in the theoretical model  = d/(c+d)).
To be more precise,  = d/(c+d) measures the taste for conformity relative to
the direct, time or psychological costs of crime (captured by the parameter c).
So if c were very small,  would be positive and large even if the taste for
conformity (d) were very small. Finally, the error term consists of a network-
specific component (constant over individuals in the same network), which
might be correlated with the regressors, k, and a white noise component, ik.
A precise description of the variables included and the corresponding descrip-
tive statistics are contained in the Data Appendix to this article (Table B1,
Appendix B).
Model (10) is the empirical equivalent of the first-order conditions of our
model of network peer effects given by equation (6) in Proposition 2. It is
the so-called spatial lag model or mixed-regressive spatial autoregressive
model (Anselin 1988) with the addition of a network-specific component
of the error term. Once the variables are transformed in deviations from the
network-specific means, a maximum likelihood approach (see, e.g., Anselin
1988) allows us to estimate jointly 

, 

, and .
4. Empirical Results
4.1 Testing the Model
The maximum likelihood estimation results of model (10) are reported in the
second column of Table 2 ("All crimes").31 The table shows that the estimated
coefficient of , which measures the taste for conformity, is statistically sig-
nificant and has a positive sign. Specifically, a one SD increase in individual
i's taste for conformity or equivalently in the average criminal activity of indi-
vidual i's reference group raises individual i's level of crime by about 5.2% of
an SD. This evidence supports our theoretical framework predicting a relevant
role of peers and conformity to peers' behavior in shaping criminal activities
among teenagers.
4.2 Different Types of Crime
The literature on local interactions has uncovered some interesting differences
between different types of crime. For instance, Ludwig et al. (2000) find that
neighborhood effects are large and negative for violent crime but have a mild
positive effect on property crime. In contrast, Glaeser et al. (1996) find instead
that social interactions seem to have a large effect on petty crime, a moderate
effect on more serious crime, and a negligible effect on very violent crime.
The basic idea of our theoretical model is that agents' criminal behavior is
driven by their desire to reduce the discrepancy between their own crime effort
31. When the model is estimated with an increasing set of controls (i.e., by adding the different
groups listed in Table B1), the value of  decreases, thus indicating that we are capturing impor-
tant confounding factors. However, the qualitative results remain unchanged. The complete list of
estimation results is available upon request.

and that of their reference group (i.e., their best friends). We find that such a
model is validated by our data for juvenile crime as a whole.
The richness of the information provided by the AddHealth data on juve-
nile crime enables us also to test our conformism model for different types
of crime, thus making our analysis directly comparable to previous works.
Specifically, we analyze whether the magnitude of the peer effects depends
on the type of crime committed. We split the offences reported in our data
in three groups (with increasing costs of committing crime). The first group
(type-1 crimes) contains (a) to paint graffiti or sign on someone else's prop-
erty or in a public place, (b) to lie to the parents or guardians about where
or with whom having been, (c) to run away from home, and (d) to act loud,
rowdy, or unruly in a public place. The second group (type-2 crimes) consists
of (a) to get into a serious physical fight, (b) to hurt someone badly enough
to need bandages or care from a doctor or nurse, (c) to drive a car without its
owner's permission, and (d) to steal something worth less than $50. The third
group (type-3 crimes) encompasses (a) to take something from a store with-
out paying for it, (b) to steal something worth more than $50, (c) to go into a
house or building to steal something, (d) to use or threat to use a weapon to get
something from someone, and (e) to sell marijuana or other drugs. Less than
20% of the teenagers in our sample confess to have committed the more seri-
ous offences.32 To be precise, these three groups contain 3488, 4084, and 1803
individuals, respectively.
32. Adolescents are selected in a more serious type of crime group if they have committed at
least one of the offences considered in the group.

where ei,,l is now the index of crime of type l committed by individual i
in network , and the rest of the notation defined for model (10) applies.
The estimation of this model provides type of crime-specific peer effects. The
results are contained in columns 3, 4, and 5 of Table 2. We find that the
estimated coefficient l, which measures the taste for conformity for type-l
crime, remains always significant and positive whatever the seriousness of the
crime considered, but it decreases in magnitude when moving from light to
more serious crimes. A one SD increase in individual i's taste for conformity
for type-1 crimes or equivalently a one SD increase in the average crimi-
nal activity of individual i's reference group translates roughly into a 9.8%
decrease in SDs of individual i's criminal activity when petty crimes (type-1
crimes) are considered, whereas this effect amounts to 6.3 and only to 1.4 for
intermediary (type-2 crimes) and serious crimes (type-3 crimes), respectively.
This evidence is in line with the findings of Glaeser et al. (1996) who show
that social interactions are more important for petty crimes.
5. Robustness Check: Undirected Versus Directed Networks
Our theoretical model and consequently our empirical investigation assume
so far that friendship relationships are symmetric, that is, gij, = gji,
. In this
section, we check how sensitive our results are to such an assumption, that is,
to a possible measurement error in the definition of the peer group. Indeed, our
data make it possible to know exactly who nominates whom in a network, and
we find that 12% of relationships in our data set are not reciprocal. Instead of
constructing undirected network, we will now focus on the analysis of directed
delinquent networks.
In the language of graph theory, in a directed graph, a link has two distinct
ends: a head (the end with an arrow) and a tail. Each end is counted sepa-
rately. The sum of head end points count toward the indegree and the sum of
tail end points count toward the outdegree. Formally, we denote a link from
i to j as gij = 1 if j has nominated i as his/her friend, and gij = 0, other-
wise. The indegree of student i, denoted by g+
i
, is the number of nominations
student i receives from other students, that is, g+
i = j
gij. The outdegree of
student i, denoted by g-
i
, is the number of friends student i nominates, that is,
g-
i = j
gji. We can thus construct two types of directed networks, one based
on indegrees and the other based on outdegrees. Observe that, by definition,
whereas in undirected networks the adjacency matrix G = [gij] is symmetric,
in directed networks, it is asymmetric.

6. Conclusion and Policy Implications
In education, crime, smoking, teenage pregnancy, school dropout, etc., econo-
mists have pointed out the importance of peer effects in explaining these
outcomes (see, e.g., Glaeser and Scheinkman 2001). Understanding the gen-
erating mechanism of such peer effects is essential for the interpretation of
the findings and to provide policy guidance. We believe that conformity is the
key element determining economic outcomes that involve interactions with
peers. In the present article, we propose a model that explains how conformity
and deterrence impact on criminal activities. In particular, we find significant
impact of peers on individual criminal activity for individuals belonging to
the same group of friends. We then test the model using the US National
Longitudinal Survey of Adolescent Health (AddHealth), which contains unique
detailed information on friendship relationships among delinquent teenagers.
A "reversion-to-the-group-mean" effect is identified.
Our results suggest that, for teenagers, the decision to commit crime de-
pends on the seriousness of crime. In particular, for petty crimes, adolescents
are strongly affected by their environment and peers because of externali-
ties involved in social decision making. In their study of a gang located in
a black inner-city neighborhood, Levitt and Venkatesh (2000) find that "social/
nonpecuniary factors are likely to play an important role" in criminal deci-
sions and gang activities. Here, even though we do not focus on gangs, we
highlight one of these social/nonpecuniary factors: the desire to conform to
the group's norm. Because of the implications of juvenile crime for adoles-
cent's behavior in the future, an effective policy should be measured not only
by the possible crime reduction it implies but also by the group interactions it
engenders.
To be more precise, if social interactions and conformism are crucial to un-
derstand juvenile criminal activities, then a targeted policy identifying "key
players" (or "key groups of players") in a given area (Ballester et al. 2006,
2010) may be an effective way to reduce crime. A key player (or a key group)
is an individual (or a group of persons) belonging to a network of criminals
who, once removed, leads to the highest aggregate delinquency reduction. In
practice, the planner may want to identify optimal network targets to concen-
trate (scarce) investigatory resources on some particular individuals, or to iso-
late them from the rest of the group, either through leniency programs, social
assistance programs, or incarceration. The success of such policy depends on
the ability to identify a social network, and this task may be not as difficult as it
seems to be. For instance, Haynie (2001) and the present article use friendship
data to identify delinquent peer networks for adolescents in the United States
that participated in an in-school survey in the 1990s. Sarnecki (2001) provides
a comprehensive study of co-offending relations and corresponding network
structure for football hooligans and right-wing extremists in Stockholm. In all
Juvenile Delinquency and Conformism 23
these cases, one may directly use the available data to determine the key player
or group players.
Social mixing policies, like the MTO experiment (mentioned in Section 1),
which relocates families from high- to low-poverty neighborhoods, could also
be an effective tool in breaking delinquent networks. Indeed, by moving "key"
delinquents (or "key groups" of delinquents) from one area to another, this
policy will disrupt the communication and the links between delinquents in a
given network. As a result, by using together a key player (or a key group)
policy and the MTO program, that is, moving families whose delinquents are
"key" in a local network, would have a very efficient effect in reducing crime
because they move "key" delinquents to richer areas while breaking criminal
networks in poorer areas.
Appendix A
Proofs of Propositions of the Model
Proof of Proposition 1. First, observe that 

 is a stochastic matrix, that is,
[k]
ij
0 and j [k]
ij = 1, and thus the largest eigenvalue of 

 is 1, that is,
µ1(

) = 1. Second, by plugging equation (1) in equation (2), for the case
bi = b, we obtain
ui(ei,ei) = a+bei - pei f -ce2
i -d(ei -ei)2
= a+bei - pei f -ce2
i -d ei -
j=ni(g)

j=ni(g)

j=1

+(b- pf)ei -(c+d)e2
i +2d
j=ni(g)

j=1
ijeiej.
Now, assuming b > pf, we can apply Theorem 1 of Ballester et al. (2006)33
with  = b- pf,  = 2(c+d),  = 0,34 and  = 2d. Hence, the condition for
existence and uniqueness of a Nash equilibrium can be written as 2(c + d) >
2d, which is always satisfied since c > 0. Third, let us calculate the Bonacich
vector. By definition,
i(,

) = mii(

33. Observe that the term a - d j=ni(g)

does not matter since the derivative of this
term with respect to ei is equal to zero.
34. This is the  in Ballester et al. (2006).
24 The Journal of Law, Economics, & Organization, V28 N1
since 

, 

1,..., 

k,... are stochastic matrices and thus
n
j=1ij = ··· =

j=1[k]
ij = 1. As a result,
i(,) =

j=1
k =

.
Applying again Theorem 1 in Ballester et al. (2006), where  = d/(c+d),
our Nash equilibrium is given by
e =




b-p f
2c
.
.
.
b-p f
2c



.
This implies that e = e and thus all players provide the same effort level
(b- pf)/(2c).
Proof of Proposition 2. First, observe that  is a stochastic matrix ij 0
and j ij = 1 and thus its largest eigenvalue is 1, that is, µ1(

) = 1. Second,
as for the proof of Proposition 1, we have
ui(ei,ei) = a+biei - pei f -ce2
i -di(ei -ei)2
= a-di
j=n

j=1
ijej
2
+(bi - pf)ei -(c+di)e2
i +2di
j=n

j=1
ijeiej.
Assume that bi > pf for all i. The utility function is nearly the same as the
one in Ballester et al. (2006),35 where i = bi - pf,  = 2(c + d),  = 0,36
and  = 2di. The main difference is that we now have ex ante heterogeneity
because of i. However, because  = 0 (i.e., there is no global substitutability),
the condition for existence and uniqueness of a Nash equilibrium is still given
by  > µ1(

),37 which in our case is equivalent to 2(ci +d) > 2d for each i.
This is always satisfied since ci > 0 for all i. Third, equation (6) is just the
first-order condition for each individual i.
35. Observe that the term a - d j=ni(g)
j=1 ijej
2
does not matter since the derivative of this
term with respect to ei is equal to zero.
36. This is the  in Ballester et al. (2006).
