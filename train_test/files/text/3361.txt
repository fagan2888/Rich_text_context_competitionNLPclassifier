Abstract
Objective: To investigate the relationship between air concentrations of fine particulate matter
52.5 mm in diameter (PM2.5) and ischaemic attacks in high-risk elderly patients (aged 60 years).
Methods: This retrospective data analysis study extracted clinical data from an electronic medical
chart system and environmental air quality data from the Ministry of the Environment Atmospheric
Environmental Regional Observation System. Patients were stratified into four groups according to
whether or not they had type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and/or an ischaemic attack (i.e. cerebral
infarctions and myocardial infarctions) during the 2-year study period. Analysis of the combined
clinical and environmental data produced the odds ratio for the likelihood of experiencing an
ischaemic attack.
Results: Clinical data were collected from 94 647 patients. On days when the air temperature was
25C and PM2.5 concentration was 20mg/m3, an ischaemic attack was more likely to occur in
the T2DM group than in the group without T2DM. An ischaemic attack was more likely to occur 2
days after an increase in the PM2.5 concentration compared with the same day as and 3­6 days
after the increase.
Conclusion: The results of this study confirmed an association between PM2.5 and ischaemic
attacks in high-risk patients.

Introduction
In guidelines regarding the relationships
between air pollutants and health hazards,
the World Health Organization (WHO) has
reported associations not only with mortal-
ity rates, in the form of all-cause deaths and
cardiovascular disease deaths, but also with
hospital admissions, emergency examin-
ations, the occurrence of ischaemic events,
and a variety of symptoms, including
arrhythmia, cardiovascular events and
heart rate fluctuations.1 Large-scale cohort
studies in the same field began to be per-
formed in around 1980, primarily in the
USA,2 but the degree of interest has
increased in recent years, and the research
field has expanded to other countries.
A study conducted in 20 US cities
investigated the possibility that short-term
changes in atmospheric concentrations of
particulate matter 52.5 mm in diameter
(PM2.5) increase the risk of acute ischaemic
stroke.3 A review article described higher
mortality rates in regions where the PM2.5
concentration was high compared with
regions where it was not.4 For example, the
overall number of deaths in regions where
the mean PM2.5 concentration was 20mg/m3
was approximately 1.1 times higher than in
regions where it was 10mg/m3.4 The authors
of the review also reported an approximately
1.25 times higher number of deaths from
lung cancer and an approximately 1.15 times
higher number of deaths from cardiovascu-
lar disease in regions where mean PM2.5
concentration was 20mg/m3 compared with
regions where it was 10mg/m3.4 The main
stroke centre in Boston, USA, carried out
analysis of data from 1705 stroke cases
during a 10-year period. It reported that
the incidence of stroke increased by 34%
24 h after air pollution worsened from a
`good' level (according to the ambient
air pollution standard set by the US
Environmental Protection Agency) to a
`moderate' level.5 Analysis of data from
Ontario, Canada, showed that a short-term
rise in PM2.5 in specific patient groups
increased the possibility of ischaemic
attacks.6 Studies have been conducted in
individual European countries, such as the
UK and Germany,7,8 and also in Europe as
a whole ­ as a broad target region. For
example, the `Air Pollution and Health: A
European Approach 2' project showed that
short-term exposure to air pollutants was
related to mortality rates.9 An analysis of
data from 22 European cohort studies sug-
gested the existence of associations between
air pollutants and cardiovascular disease
mortality rates.10
Research has been undertaken in
other world regions. A study conducted
in Santiago, Chile, found a relationship
between PM2.5 exposure and hospital
admissions for stroke.11 A case-crossover
study using Taiwan as the target region
identified an association between PM2.5 and
ischaemic stroke.12 In Japan, a survey cover-
ing 100 000 subjects that extended over
a 15-year period was conducted in three
prefectures (Miyagi, Aichi and Osaka).13
It identified a significant increase in the risk
of male lung cancer deaths associated with
PM2.5 exposure.13 A survey undertaken in
five prefectures in western Japan demon-
strated that short-term exposure to air pol-
lution may increase the risk of death from
haemorrhagic stroke and ischaemic stroke.14
Other studies have also reported relation-
ships between exposure to air pollutants,
including PM2.5, and health hazards.15­17
640 Journal of International Medical Research 44(3)
A meta-analysis of data from 34
previously published studies found that the
short-term risk of a heart attack increased as
air pollution concentrations increased.18
Another meta-analysis showed that fine
particulate matter 10 mm (PM10) and
PM2.5 concentrations increased the risk of
stroke and heart attack.19 A review article
found that several groups, including elderly
subjects, patients with diabetes mellitus and
patients with coronary artery disease,
appeared to be particularly sensitive to the
harmful effects that resulted from exposure
to particulate matter.20 Strong relationships
between myocardial infarction and/or
stroke were found in nine of 14 studies
related to PM10 and in two of five studies
related to PM2.5.21 Research, including in
animal models, has also been conducted to
investigate the health impacts of PM2.5
exposure and to determine the pathophysio-
logical mechanisms that link air pollution
and diseases such as type 2 diabetes mellitus
(T2DM) and myocardial infarction.22­24
The objective of this study was to analyse
the relationship between air PM2.5 concen-
trations and ischaemic attacks in elderly
patients (60 years) with T2DM ­ a high-
risk population for ischaemic attacks
(i.e. cerebral infarctions and myocardial
infarctions).
Patients and methods
Extraction and accumulation of data
This retrospective data analysis study
extracted clinical data from the Mega-Oak
electronic medical chart system (National
Centre for Global Health and Medicine
database, which holds information on
patients, clinical laboratory tests, medica-
tions, disease names and all ordering data)
and publicly released environmental data
from the Ministry of the Environment
Atmospheric Environmental Regional
Observation System (Soramame-kun).25
The clinical and environmental data were
then integrated using a database and ren-
dered anonymous using Standardized
Structured Medical Information eXchange
software version 2 (Consortium for SS-MIX
Dissemination and Promotion, Kanagawa,
Japan).26 A flowchart of the data processing
procedure is shown in Figure 1.
Target data
Among the data obtained at the observation
points of the Ministry of the Environment
Atmospheric Environmental Regional
Observation System (Soramame-kun),
which are available to the public, PM2.5
concentration (daily means) and air tem-
perature (daily means) data were collected
for the 2-year period between 1 January
2011 and 31 December 2012 from the Tokyo
Adachi-ku Ayase observation point ­ the
closest observation point to the National
Centre for Global Health and Medicine,
Tokyo, Japan.
Clinical data were obtained by extracting
data for patients aged 60 years (the age
group in which ischaemic attacks are most
common) from the insurance claim data of
patients who were examined at the National
Centre for Global Health and Medicine
Hospital, Tokyo, Japan, during the desig-
nated 2-year period. From this information,
data were then extracted for patients who
had been examined in the hospital's
Department of Neurosurgery, Department
of Emergency Medicine and Department of
General Internal Medicine. There is evi-
dence that because they eat a lot of fish,
healthy Japanese people are at lower risk of
heart disease than their healthy western
counterparts;27,28 this study was therefore
restricted to patients aged 60 years (i.e.
high-risk patients). Data extracted and
evaluated for each patient from the Mega-
Oak electronic medical chart system were:
age, sex, presence or absence of T2DM, date
of an occurrence of an ischaemic attack and
date of attendance at another clinical
Hoshino et al. 641
consultation. The dates of occurrence of
ischaemic attacks consisted of a combin-
ation of the dates of occurrence of cerebral
infarctions and myocardial infarctions,
which were the main categories of ischaemic
attacks analysed in this study.
The study protocol was approved by the
Clinical Research and Ethics Committee
of Aoki Hospital, Hakuseikai Healthcare
Corporation, Honjo, Saitama Prefecture,
Japan (no. 26-098). A notice in the hospital
explained that the medical data spontan-
eously recorded during patient examinations
would be used anonymously for an aca-
demic study. Each of the patients providing
data also gave written informed consent at
the initial consultation.
Statistical analyses
All statistical analyses were performed using
the JMPÕ statistical package, version 10.0.2
(SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA). A basic
statistical analysis was undertaken for each
of the groups included in the analysis. The
odds ratio (OR) for each of the groups was
calculated using the method shown in
Table 1. The analysis methods were mod-
ified in order to determine whether ischae-
mic attacks as a result of exposure to PM2.5
were more likely to occur in patients
60 years who had T2DM than in patients
60 years who did not have T2DM; and to
identify the degree of rise in PM2.5 concen-
tration at which the occurrence of ischaemic
attacks starts to increase in an ischaemic
attack high-risk group, i.e. elderly patients
with T2DM. More specifically, for each of
the study analysis groups, the PM2.5 con-
centrations were divided into 1 mg/m3 refer-
ence values from 10 mg/m3 to 30 mg/m3; and
by proceeding from one reference value to
the next, the ORs were repeatedly calculated
according to the group below and at or

in a Japanese study that examined the relationship between air concentrations of particulate matter52.5 mm
in diameter (PM2.5) and ischaemic attacks in elderly patients (aged  60 years) with and without T2DM.
Database construction was achieved by extracting clinical data from the Mega-Oak electronic medical chart
system and environmental data from the Ministry of the Environment Atmospheric Environmental Regional
Observation System (Soramame-kun). The clinical and environmental data were then integrated and rendered
anonymous using Standardized Structured Medical Information eXchange (SS-MIX) software.

above each reference value by using the
procedure in Table 1. In addition to the
PM2.5 concentrations, the data sets were
also reorganized by using air temperature
data and time lag data (differences between
the day the PM2.5 concentration was rec-
orded and the day the ischaemic attack
occurred) and the various ORs were calcu-
lated. The following are examples of how the
specific data sets were analysed: (i) analyses
were performed that were restricted to
patients at an air temperature of 20C
and 25C, which are high-temperature
environments in which the effects of PM2.5
tend to manifest; (ii) data were prepared
with the numbers of occurrences divided
into ischaemic attack time lags at 1-day
intervals, i.e. same day (Lag 0), 1 day later
(Lag 1) and 2 days later (Lag 2), the
calculations were performed by dividing
the respective PM2.5 concentrations from
10 mg/m3 to 30 mg/m3 into 1 -mg/m3 reference
values, and then the time lags at which the
OR increased were identified. Data were
produced according to each set of conditions
(i.e. whether the patient had T2DM, high
temperature conditions) and the multi-tiered
analysis data are expressed in a way that
makes visual comparisons possible. A P-
value5 0.01 was considered statistically
significant.
Results
Maximum mean daily PM2.5 concentration
was 67mg/m3 and mean daily PM2.5 con-
centration was 17 mg/m3. Even though this
present study used data from a 2-year
period, the PM2.5 concentration was
25 mg/m3 on only 16.7% (122/730) of
days; and it exceeded 35mg/m3, the reference
value in Japan, on only 4.4% (32/730) of
days. Data from 94 647 patients aged
60 years (mean 130 patients/day) were
obtained. There were 12 818 patients with
T2DM (mean 18 patients/day) among them,
and patients who were examined for an
ischaemic attack accounted for 11 179
(mean 15 patients/day) of the total number
of patients. Baseline data for the patients
included in these analyses are shown in
Table 2. Patients were divided into four
groups: (i) a group with T2DM who were
recorded as having had and been examined
for an ischaemic attack during the survey
period (5198 patients [3345 male, 1853
female]; mean age 74.59 years); (ii) a group
with T2DM who had not had an ischaemic
attack (12 818 patients [8571 male, 4247
female]; mean age 73.21 years); (iii) a group
without T2DM who were recorded as
having had and been examined for an
ischaemic attack during the survey period
(11 179 patients [6311 male, 4868 female];
mean age 75.31 years); and (iv) a group
without T2DM who had not had an ischae-
mic attack (65 452 patients [32 924 male, 32
528 female]; mean age 73.96 years). The four
groups of patients were compared: the two
groups that had ischaemic attacks were
significantly older than the two groups that
did not (Student's t-test, P5 0.0001 for all
comparisons); the two groups with T2DM
had significantly higher male-to-female
ratios than the two groups without T2DM

(Pearson's 2, P5 0.0001 for all
comparisons).
The results of the calculations of the
likelihood of an ischaemic attack occurring
when the PM2.5 concentration was high and
the air temperature was 20C are shown in
Tables 3 and 4; the results for when the
air temperature was 25C are shown in
Tables 5 and 6. The data for the T2DM
group are shown in Tables 3 and 5, and the
data for the group without T2DM in
Tables 4 and 6. When the calculations were
made for the air temperature 20C, there
were no significant increases in the ORs for
either group of patients (Tables 3 and 4).
When the calculations were made for the
combination of air temperature 25C and
patients with T2DM (Table 5), the ORs
tended to be higher than for the other
combinations of analytical conditions. This
was particularly noteworthy when the time
lag was 2 days, as the results showed higher
ORs at PM2.5 reference values in the 20­
24mg/m3 range, indicating that ischaemic
attacks were more likely to occur under
these analytical conditions than under other
conditions. By contrast, in the group with-
out T2DM in the same PM2.5 reference
range, the ORs were almost 1.00 (Table 6),
indicating that there were no differences in
the risk of ischaemic events according to the
PM2.5 concentrations.
The combination of analytical conditions
under which the OR was the highest (OR
1.24) was: patients with T2DM, PM2.5
concentration reference value 20mg/m3,
mean air temperature 25C and a time
lag of 2 days from exposure (Table 5). When
the 2-test was performed in relation to these
conditions, the 2-test value for the null
hypothesis `When the PM2.5 concentration
is 20mg/m3, there is no difference in inci-
dence of ischaemic attacks from when the
PM2.5 concentration is520mg/m3' was 5.63
(P ¼ 0.018). Thus, the null hypothesis was
rejected at a 5% significance level, thereby
confirming that the PM2.5 concentration
made a significant difference to the incidence
of ischaemic attacks. When the 2-test was
performed in relation to patients without
T2DM under the same analytical condi-
tions, the 2-test value was 6.04 and the
difference was not significant (P ¼ 0.865).
The following section describes the ana-
lysis of patients with T2DM aged 60 years
exposed to a mean air temperature 25C
with a time lag 2 days after exposure to
PM2.5. Table 7 shows the details of the
numbers of patients included in the OR and
95% confidence interval analyses of the
occurrence of ischaemic attacks. These
detailed data were used to review material
for future tasks, including determining the
advantages and limitations of the analytical
methods that were used in this present study.
The results in Table 7 demonstrate that the
numbers of patients who had an ischaemic
attack below the reference value and at or
above the reference value were very small,
and that the 95% confidence intervals
widened as the patient numbers got smaller.
Some sections of the data were unsuitable
for analysis, as identified in Table 7. Figure 2
shows the changes in ORs according to the
PM2.5 concentration reference values in the
optimal range for the analysis without inclu-
sion of the unsuitable data described previ-
ously in Table 5 (i.e. for 10­12 mg/m3 and
25­30 mg/m3). The ORs for the occurrence of
ischaemic attacks on Day 2 after exposure
showed that the occurrence of ischaemic
attacks gradually increased at a mean
PM2.5 concentration of 16 mg/m3 and
peaked at 20 mg/m3; although the ORs
varied widely, the high ORs tended to
continue.
Discussion
Patients at high risk of ischaemic events,
such as the elderly and those that have
arrhythmias, are more vulnerable than
healthy people to changes in the environ-
ment; they might therefore be more likely to
Hoshino et al. 645
manifest the effects of exposure to air pol-
lutants, including PM2.5. Among existing
research on high-risk patients, a study on
myocardial infarct survivors in Israel
showed a clear association between cumu-
lative chronic exposure to PM2.5 and recur-
rence of a cardiovascular event after a first
myocardial infarct; a strong possibility that
increases in PM2.5 concentration act as a
trigger in high-risk patients was suggested.29
A study conducted in collaboration with the
American Heart Association concluded that
a strong association existed between short-
term exposure to a high PM concentration
and the acute cardiovascular mortality rate,
and that the association was particularly
strong in high-risk patients.30 Moreover,
they showed that even within the standard
set by the US Environmental Protection
Agency, there was an association between
PM2.5 and the acute cardiovascular mortal-
ity rate.30 The present study showed that
when the PM2.5 concentration was 20mg/
m3, ischaemic attacks were more likely to
occur in high-risk patients aged 60 years
who had T2DM compared with those with-
out T2DM. In research investigating other
environmental factors, a study conducted in
Mexico City showed strong associations
between changes in cardiac autonomic

patients and exposure both to PM2.5 and
carbon monoxide;31 it will be necessary to
assess the impact of carbon monoxide on
ischaemic attacks in a high-risk group in
future ongoing research in Japan. A Swedish
study, which analysed the relationship
between air pollution and the occurrence
of ventricular arrhythmias in patients at
high risk for ventricular arrhythmias,
demonstrated that a worsening of air pollu-
tion could trigger an arrhythmia within
2 h.32 In contrast, the present study of the
occurrence of ischaemic attacks (i.e. cerebral
infarction and myocardial infarction)
demonstrated that there was a significant
increase in the occurrence of attacks 2 days
after exposure. The reason for this may be
that thrombosis or embolism occurs against
the background of circulatory failure after
an arrhythmia develops, and there is a time
lag before an ischaemic attack occurs.
Research has shown a time lag of 1 day
between an increase in PM2.5 concentration
and the time an event such as a stroke
occurred.33 The same study reported that
the number of deaths due to the occurrence
of an event tended to increase after the
PM2.5 concentration rose in comparison
with the day before it rose; and that the

events did not just occur on the day of the
increase in PM2.5 concentration but some-
times occurred on and after the following
day.33 Moreover, events tended to be four-
times more common during warm periods
than cold periods.33 The results of the
present study also showed an association
between warmer air temperatures of 25C
and the occurrence of ischaemic attacks 2
days after PM2.5 exposure in patients with
T2DM who were 60 years of age. A time
series analysis of data collected at the
National Taiwan University Hospital
showed that during warm seasons, PM2.5
was associated with emergency room visits
for ischaemic stroke by patients who were
65 years of age and by female patients.34 In
Japan, based on epidemiological findings
related to the health of highly sensitive and
vulnerable persons (e.g. those with a respira-
tory or cardiovascular disease, or diabetes),
an expert committee on environmental
standards for fine particulate matter stated
the importance of assessing environmental

particularly when the time lag was 2 days, the values were higher in the 20­24 mg/m3 PM2.5 reference value

value of 20mg/m3 and above, the OR 2 days after PM2.5 exposure was 1.24, which was significantly higher than
the OR for the group without T2DM under the same conditions (see Table 6)

standards to protect such individuals.13
Thus, there is a strong likelihood of an
association between warm weather and
ischaemic attacks in high-risk patients, and
further assessments (e.g. of the impact of
ultraviolet rays in warm weather) and eluci-
dation of the mechanisms responsible for the
associations would be useful.
In this present study, the highest OR was
in the T2DM group on a day when the air
temperature was 25C and the time lag was
2 days, thereby indicating that when the
PM2.5 concentration increased, an ischae-
mic attack tended to be more likely to occur
2 days later in the patients with T2DM than
in the patients without T2DM. It is particu-
larly noteworthy that this result was demon-
strated at the 5% significance level when
20mg/m3 was used as the PM2.5 reference
value. Environmental standard PM2.5 ref-
erence values have been set in individual
countries based on analyses of their effects
on health hazards in epidemiological studies
(Table 8).1,13,35­40 In Japan, `associations
between short-term exposure and long-term
exposure and circulatory and respiratory
disease death and lung cancer deaths' were
described by an expert committee.13

The 24-h mean environmental standard
was set at 25mg/m3 by the WHO1 and at
35mg/m3 in Japan.39 According to the results
of previous studies,1­24,29­40 it appears that
the closer the reference value for stratifica-
tion approaches these standards, the clearer
the associations between PM2.5 concentra-
tions and ischaemic attacks tend to become.
In the present study, the ORs were highest
when the PM2.5 concentration was 20mg/
m3. However, when the reference value for
the data used in this study was increased, the
amount of data available to calculate the
OR decreased; for example, when a level of
28 mg/m3 was used for the analysis, data
for 510 days in the 2-year period qualified
for inclusion in the analysis. It is therefore
unlikely that further studies of whether
ischaemic attacks are more common at
higher reference values will be possible at
the locations used in the present study. It
would be useful, however, to accumulate
more data for higher reference values in
the future.
In terms of the reliability of the data used
in this study, measurements made at the
Adachi-ku Ayase observation point pro-
vided the environmental data and the
National Centre for Global Health and
Medicine Hospital provided the clinical

experiencing an ischaemic attack 2 days after exposure at an air temperature of 25C according to the
concentration of particulate matter52.5 mm in diameter (PM2.5) reference values in the optimal analysis
range. OR for the occurrence of an ischaemic attack on Day 2 after exposure gradually increased starting at a
mean PM2.5 concentration of 16mg/m3; OR peaked at 20mg/m3. Although the ORs varied widely, the tendency
for the OR values to be high continued

data. Both sites are located within the 23-
ward (ku) part of Tokyo, and the Adachi-ku
Ayase observation point is the closest obser-
vation point to the hospital. Nevertheless,
the distance between the two sites in a
straight line is 12 km, and it is impossible
to rule out the possibility of differences
arising between the PM2.5 concentration
around the hospital and the PM2.5 concen-
tration at the Adachi-ku Ayase observation
point. Moreover, in terms of geographical
distribution of patients who attend the hos-
pital, because the diseases targeted in the
present study required emergency transpor-
tation to the hospital and a corresponding
outpatient clinic examination, most of the
patients lived within 20 km of the hospital;
therefore, in this study there is a reliable link
between geographical location, environmen-
tal data and health effects. However, when
analysing data of other patients in the
future, geographical distribution may be
even more varied and the analysis more
difficult. The time lag data revealed no
significant difference between ORs of the
groups with and those without T2DM on
the day of the increase in PM2.5 concentra-
tion, but there was a significant difference
between them 2 days later. Ischaemic attacks
are pathological conditions that develop as a
result of occlusion of an artery; and they
occur as a result of an arterial occlusion by a
thrombus based on an atherosclerotic lesion,
or by embolization caused by an embolism
that develops due to an arrhythmia.
Particularly because the risk of thrombosis
is higher in elderly versus young patients, the
symptoms progress more slowly and in a
stepwise manner than in embolism, which is
more common in younger people; thus, the
development of a time lag of at least several
hours between the environmental exposure
that acts as the trigger and the completion of
the clinical pathology is inevitable. Because
the length of time lag varies from disease to
disease, improving the reliability of the
linkage between the patient and environ-
mental data in relation to other diseases will
be a future challenge.
Even though this present study used data
from a 2-year period, the PM2.5 concentra-
tion was 25mg/m3 on only 16.7% of the
days, and it exceeded 35mg/m3, the reference
value in Japan, on only 4.4% of the days.
When the present study tried extracting data
only on the days when the air temperature
was high, even fewer data were available.
Consequently, because there were so few
days when both the PM2.5 concentration
and air temperature were high, it will be
necessary to increase the reliability of the
results of the analysis by accumulating data
continuously. Our study group has devel-
oped a tool for extracting and accumulating
clinical and environmental data. Because the
clinical data used in the present study had
been input daily by physicians and nurses
during routine clinical practice, and the
environmental data used are publicly avail-
able, the introduction of the tool to extract
and combine these data kept costs down,
compared to costs involved with building a
clinical database from the ground up.
Continuous monitoring with this tool may
be a good method of analysing associations
between environmental factors and disease
structure.

In the 13­24 mg/m3 PM2.5 concentration
range, the numbers of patients were suffi-
cient for analysis; at 20 mg/m3 in the high
temperature range, the OR for the occur-
rence of ischaemic attacks in patients with
T2DM was significantly higher than in
patients without T2DM. In high-risk
patients, even when the PM2.5 exposure
concentration was below the environmental
standard value, as shown by the changes in
the ORs, the risk gradually increased start-
ing at a PM2.5 concentration of 20 mg/m3,
which suggests that it is impossible to rule
out the possibility of an impact of low-
concentration exposure on the occurrence of
ischaemic attacks.
As for the methods used in this study,
from the standpoint of searching for
the lowest value at which air pollutants
affect so-called low-concentration-exposure
groups and the time lags in the occurrence of
the ischaemic attacks, at present, when big
data are formed based on extraction from
electronic charts, it would seem that
some parts of the methodology will be
useful in other clinicoepidemiological stu-
dies. Nevertheless, even when there is a large
number of patients, as in the present study,
the reliability of the ORs decreased when the
lowest and highest concentrations in the
target period of the analysis were
approached; the inability to make compari-
sons between them would seem to be a
limitation of this method of analysis.
In the present study, the time lag of the
occurrence of ischaemic attacks after PM2.5
exposure appeared to be 2 days, so
research in the future will target a number
of environmental factors, including other air
pollutants and weather phenomena. After
taking the numbers of patients and the mean
values of 3-day changes in environmental
factors into account and performing partial
correlation analyses of each element, and
then by eliminating duplicate environmental
factors and performing a multiple regression
analysis according to the items selected,
future monitoring will calculate the degree
to which PM2.5 and other environmental
factors are related to ischaemic attacks and
the extent of their individual contributions.
Using PM2.5 and other environmental fac-
tors as parameters, future analyses will deter-
mine the seasonal fluctuations in their impact
and search for methods of prevention.
In conclusion, this study constructed a
database combining environmental and clin-
ical data and then analysed the data for
associations between ischaemic attacks and
PM2.5 concentrations. Analyses showed
that on days when air temperature was
25C and the PM2.5 concentration was
20mg/m3, ischaemic attacks were more
likely to occur in elderly patients with
T2DM than in those without T2DM.
Ongoing, continuous monitoring of the
clinical and environmental data will help to
improve the accuracy of future evaluations
of the associations between environmental
factors and disease structure.
