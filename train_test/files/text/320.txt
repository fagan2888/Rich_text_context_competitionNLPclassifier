ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND A large proportion of US adults have elevated transferrin satura-
tion, an indicator of a predisposition for iron overload. The purpose of this study
was to evaluate the relationship between elevated serum transferrin saturation
and mortality.
METHODS This cohort study was conducted using data from the First Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey I (1971­1974) (NHANES I) merged with the NHANES
I Epidemiologic Followup Study (1992) (N = 10,714). We used SUDAAN and appro-
priate weights to make population estimates for the adult US population (aged 25 to
74 years at baseline). All-cause mortality was evaluated in relation to serum transferrin
saturation of greater than 45%, greater than 50%, greater than 55%, and greater
than 60% using Cox proportional hazards regression.
RESULTS In a Cox proportional hazards model controlling for potential confound-
ers, including comorbid diseases, smoking, and cholesterol, all-cause mortality
is significantly greater for persons with a serum transferrin saturation of more
than 55%, compared with those with saturations below this cutoff (hazards ratio
[HR] =1.60, 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.17-2.21). No one who died had
hemochromatosis as any of the 20 listed causes of death. Many of the underlying
causes of death for persons with serum transferrin saturation levels of more than
55% are common causes of death in the general population, although these per-
sons were more likely to have died of cirrhosis and diabetes, a finding consistent
with iron overload.
CONCLUSIONS In this nationally representative cohort of adults, those with elevat-
ed serum transferrin saturation, more than 2% of the adult US population, were
at increased risk for all-cause mortality.

INTRODUCTION
Excess iron and iron overload can facilitate the occurrence of a variety
of diseases, including cirrhosis, congestive heart failure, diabetes, and
cancer.1-4 Pathologic iron accumulation affects many organs, such
as the liver, pancreas, and heart, among others.5 Hereditary iron overload
is characterized by excessive intestinal absorption and cellular deposition
of iron and is found in several conditions, including hemochromatosis,
African iron overload, and iron-loading anemias.2,4,6 Hemochromatosis is
among the most common inherited metabolic abnormalities, particularly
among those of Northern European origin.7-11
Serum transferrin saturation is a commonly used indicator for a predis-
position of iron overload, and its measurement is a frequent first step in
screening protocols for hereditary hemochromatosis.5 A substantial propor-
tion of adults in the United States have elevated transferrin saturation lev-
els, although few have a diagnosed iron overload condition.9 Whereas iron
overload facilitates certain disease processes, it is unclear whether elevated
transferrin saturation is a risk factor for mortality.

SERUM TRANSFERRIN SATURATION AND MORTALITY
Although several studies have focused on the mor-
tality risk associated with hemochromatosis, method-
ological limitations and population definitions suggest
additional investigation into the risk associated with
transferrin saturation is warranted. Several cross-sectional
studies have attempted to examine the mortality risk
of being homozygous for the C282Y mutation of the
HFE gene by investigating whether homozygotes were
underrepresented in older age-groups.12,13 These stud-
ies found that homozygotes were not underrepresented
and argued that life-threatening disease might not occur
in many C282Y homozygotes. These studies, however,
were not cohort studies assessing survival time or mortal-
ity risk, and they defined their population based on a
genetic marker rather than a clinical indicator (eg, trans-
ferring saturation). Other studies have been based on
patients with a diagnosis of hemochromatosis.14,15 These
additional studies are based on patients with advanced
disease as evidenced by baseline rates of 68% for cirrho-
sis. Because few patients with elevated serum transferrin
saturation levels ever have hemochromatosis diagnosed,
estimating risk based on this advanced disease popula-
tion might not indicate the true risk of iron overload or
elevated transferrin saturation.16
It is unclear whether elevated serum transferrin
saturation has an unrecognized deleterious affect on
survival.16,17 The purpose of this study, therefore, was
to examine the mortality risk among a nationally rep-
resentative cohort of persons who have elevated serum
transferrin saturation levels.
METHODS
The design of this study is a retrospective cohort
study of persons aged 25 to 74 years at the time of the
index interview. The data sources used in this study are
the First Health and Nutrition Examination Survey I
(1971­1974) (NHANES I) merged with the NHANES
I Epidemiologic Followup Study (1992) (NHEFS).
NHANES I was multistage, stratified probability
survey designed to collect extensive demographic,
medical history, nutritional, clinical, and laboratory
data representative of the noninstitutionalized civilian
US population.
The NHANES I Epidemiologic Followup Study is
a national longitudinal study designed to investigate
the relationships between clinical, nutritional, and
behavioral factors assessed at baseline NHANES I and
subsequent morbidity, mortality, and institutionaliza-
tion. The NHEFS initial population includes the 14,407
participants who were 25 to 74 years of age when first
examined in NHANES I. More than 98% of those in
the initial NHANES I cohort were traced and supplied
data in the NHEFS.
The follow-up information was gathered in 1 of 3
ways. Subjects were interviewed who could be con-
tacted and could participate. Surviving subjects were
always administered the subject questionnaire. If the
subject was alive but incapacitated, a slightly modified
version of the subject questionnaire was administered
to a proxy respondent. A separate proxy questionnaire
was used only when the person had died. Finally, for
those who had died during the period between the
NHANES I index interview and the follow-up inter-
view, information from a death certificate was recorded.
Transferrin Saturation
In the original NHANES I, serum transferrin saturation
was measured. We defined elevated serum transfer-
rin saturation as greater than 45%, greater than 50%,
greater than 55%, and greater than 60%. All of these
cutoff values had previously been proposed or used in
population-based studies of elevated serum transferrin
saturation.18,19 The serum transferrin saturation percent-
age was calculated by dividing the serum iron level by
total iron-binding capacity.
Mortality
Mortality was measured as all-cause mortality. It has
been contended that all-cause mortality is an endpoint
more unbiased than disease-specific mortality.20 The
mortality variable was assessed using death certificates.
The cause of death was measured as the underlying
cause of death.
Control Variables
We attempted to examine the independent relation-
ship between elevated serum transferrin saturation and
mortality while controlling for potential confounders.
Control variables that were available in the NHANES I
baseline data set were age, sex, race, poverty status, and
education. Insurance was not available in this data set,
but poverty status, which is an index based on income
and number of household members, was. Comorbidities
were controlled for at baseline by positive responses to
questions regarding whether a physician ever told the
patient that he or she had any of 42 different condi-
tions (eg, diabetes, high blood pressure, hepatitis). The
Charlson Comorbidity Index was calculated from the
responses to these questions.21 We also included total
serum cholesterol and smoking status at baseline as
control variables for mortality risk.
Data Analysis
For the analysis of the NHEFS we used sampling
weights to calculate prevalence estimates for the civil-
ian noninstitutionalized US population aged 25 to 74
years in 1971 to 1974. Because of the complex sampling

SERUM TRANSFERRIN SATURATION AND MORTALITY
design of the survey, we performed all analyses with
SUDAAN.22 Our cohort for analysis was limited to
those with data in both the baseline and follow-up data
sets and who had their serum transferrin saturation
measured (N = 10,714).
We examined the relationship between elevated
serum transferrin saturation and proportion of the
cohort surviving throughout the follow-up period. We
computed Kaplan-Meier curves for mortality and time
in years since the baseline examination for elevated
serum transferrin saturation at 55%, because this level
has been suggested as an action point for further inves-
tigation of iron overload.23 Results provided unadjusted
estimates of the all-cause mortality rate for those with
and without elevated serum transferrin saturation.
Finally, we performed Cox regressions with survival
time for serum transferrin saturation levels in 3 differ-
ent models. The first model defined the population into
several categories of transferrin saturation at baseline
(45% [reference category] or less, 45.1% to 50.0%,
50.1% to 55.0%, 55.1% to 60.0%, and greater than
60%) controlling for age, sex, race, poverty status, edu-
cation, total serum cholesterol level (200 mg/dL [5.20
mmol/L] or higher or less than 200 mg/dL), current
smoking status, and comorbidities. The second and
third models were computed examining the population
as individuals having elevated or normal transferrin
saturation percentage, defining elevated transferrin sat-
uration as greater than 55% in one model and greater
than 60% in another. These models were computed for
all-cause mortality. In these models, survival time was a
continuous variable measured in 1-year increments.
RESULTS
Table 1 displays the characteristics of the population.
The proportion of the population with elevated serum
transferrin saturation was 6.8% at more than 45%
saturation; 3.8% at more than 50% saturation; 2.3% at
more than 55%; and 1.3% at more than 60% satura-
tion. As displayed in Table 1, those with transferrin
saturation levels of greater than 55% are more likely to
be male, white, and college educated, compared with
the overall population.
Figure 1 shows the cumulative, unadjusted all-cause
mortality with time for persons who had elevated trans-
ferrin saturations at 55%. After controlling for con-
founding variables in a Cox proportional hazards model
(Table 2), all-cause mortality risk is significantly greater
for those with a transferrin saturation of 60% compared
with those who had a transferrin saturation of 45% or
less. When the entire population is dichotomized into
elevated or not elevated transferrin saturation levels at
55%, however, persons with elevated transferrin satura-
tion levels have a significantly increased mortality risk
(hazards ratio [HR] 1.60, 95% confidence interval [CI],
1.17-2.21). Mortality risk is also significantly greater
for those with a transferrin saturation of greater than
60%, compared with those at less than this cutoff.
No one in the cohort who died had hemochromato-
sis as any of the 20 listed causes of death. Table 3 shows
the top 10 causes of death for those with a transferrin
saturation of more than 55%. Compared with those who
had a transferrin saturation of 55% or less, both groups
have 5 of the 10 causes of death in common. Consistent
with the descriptions of iron overload, however, cirrhosis
and diabetes were more common underlying causes of
death among the elevated transferrin saturation cohort.
DISCUSSION
The current study indicates that persons with a serum
transferrin saturation greater than 55% are at increased
risk of all-cause mortality. Elevated serum transferrin levels
are associated with decreased survival, even after control-
ling for factors such as comorbid conditions (eg, hyper-
tension, diabetes, cancer), smoking, and elevated choles-

terol levels. Historically, the morbidity and mortality of
iron overload diseases has been associated with cirrhosis
and other liver diseases, diabetes mellitus, and cardiomy-
opathy. These findings provide new information on the
impact of elevated serum transferrin saturation.
Approximately 2% of the adult US population has
transferrin saturation levels greater than 55%. Accord-
ing to estimates from the early 1990s, more than 3.3
million US adults have an elevated transferrin saturation
according to this criteria.16 This risk factor for mortality
is essentially unrecognized in a substantial proportion of
adults. To provide some context, the prevalence of dia-
betes, both diagnosed and undiagnosed, is estimated at
approximately 8% of the population.24
Although the current study has found an association
between elevated transferrin saturation and mortality,
the underlying pathophysiologic mechanism associ-
ated with the increased risk is unclear. Consistent with
the pathophysiologic mechanism of hereditary hemo-
chromatosis and African iron overload, an elevation
in serum transferrin saturation might represent an iron
overload state with accumulation of iron in vital organs.
The findings of this study indicating a relatively
underinvestigated risk factor for mortality have simi-
larities to those of recent investigations focusing on
C-reactive protein (CRP). C-reactive protein was first
associated with cardiovascular disease when it was
noticed that CRP was increased after an acute myo-
cardial infarction.25 It was unclear what this marker
represented as an acute-phase reactant, even though
it had a consistent relationship with cardiovascular

disease outcomes.26 Much as the findings of the pres-
ent study between baseline transferrin saturation and
survival risk 20 years later, CRP was a strong predictor
of risk even 20 years after initial blood samples were
obtained.27 C-reactive protein is now recommended as
useful in cardiovascular disease detection and preven-
tion.26 Further research is needed to determine whether
useful prognostic information is yielded from measures
of transferrin saturation.
A strength of this study is that it uses a national
population estimate as a cohort. Further, the results are
based on elevated serum transferrin saturation rather
than on a specific diagnosis, such as hemochromatosis.
Because hemochromatosis is so rarely diagnosed, popu-
lation level estimates of morbidity or mortality using
persons with hemochromatosis might represent impli-
cations only for those with advanced disease manifest-
ing a classic presentation.
Several limitations to these results should be noted.
First, the estimate from the NHANES I was based on
elevated serum transferrin saturation measurements, an
appropriate first step in determining a predisposition
to iron overload. Serum transferrin saturation can be
considered a phenotypic marker of homozygosity for
hemochromatosis but by itself does not indicate the
presence or absence of iron overload. Thus, a single
elevated transferrin saturation level might have resulted
in overestimates of the prevalence of those who will
progress to iron overload in the study population.
In conclusion, elevated serum transferrin satura-
tion has implications for increased mortality risk. The
additional mortality associated with elevated serum
transferrin saturation would appear to affect many
more persons than previously thought. A substantial
proportion of the US adult population appears to
share this risk.
