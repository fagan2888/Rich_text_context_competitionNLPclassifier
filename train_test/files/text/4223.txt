Article
Future workplaces will be affected by the pressures of rapid
technological change, aging population, and declining
workforce, and consequently, many scholars agree that
ergonomics needs to gain more relevance at workplaces
(Brewer & Hsiang, 2002; Caple, 2008; Charness, 2008;
Charness & Holley, 2004; Croasmun, 2004; Dul et al.,
2012; Kumashiro, 2000; Schwoerer & May, 1996; Walker,
2006). This is especially true in the case of office work as
most offices have undergone, and will most likely undergo,
extensive changes when it comes to adopting new technolo-
gies and products. Although academics and policy makers
might agree that there is a real need to develop the practice
of ergonomics, there may be other contradictory develop-
ments in modern culture that are also reflected in the orga-
nizational culture as well as design culture, and those may
in fact diminish the role played by the practice and under-
standing of ergonomics.
The object of this study is not ergonomics as such; rather,
it is understood as a cultural idea and resource that actors can
utilize for different purposes in different contexts. The article
analyzes how the vision of ergonomics is constructed during
a manufacturing process in a company that specializes in
producing ergonomic office furniture and products, and how
this vision is intertwined with certain conceptions of office
workers and work spaces.
Those who design and produce material objects and inte-
rior design concepts to organizational settings anticipate how
their products will be interacted with, and how they will fit
within specific spaces (Dant, 2008). The vision of the role of
ergonomics, and the related visions of future workers and
work environments act as tools that help organize design
knowledge to create a shared conception and consensus of
the aims of specific projects. In addition, the visions of future
office workers and office environments do not just reflect
reality but actively strive to shape it and contribute to creat-
ing that reality (Pollock & Williams, 2010). The idea that the
producers' and designers' intentions and ideas are in some
ways embodied in the design and also responded to by the
users (see Koskinen, 2006; Koskinen, 2007; Mazé &
Redström, 2007; Silverstone & Haddon, 1996; Tiles &
Oberdiek, 1995) is not new, but there is still a lack of empiri-
cal research that identifies the practices and arguments which
aim to freeze these visions and intentions into certain kind of
office spaces and furniture.
Analyzing the material and aesthetic dimensions of mod-
ern organizational culture has lately become a rich and grow-
ing field of critical research (see, for example, Chugh &
Hancock, 2009; Cohen, 2010; Dale, 2005; Dean, 2005;

Bad Enough Ergonomics: A Case Study of
an Office Chair
Virve Peteri1
Abstract
The article analyzes ergonomics as a social and cultural phenomenon, as something that is formulated and described by
speakers in a specific social context; in a company that is specialized in producing ergonomic office furniture. Through a
case study of an office chair, the article examines how ergonomics and its association with the vision of the potential users
and their working spaces are constructed by the relevant actors in project meetings and individual interviews during the
manufacturing process. The article is concerned with how, in the process of producing an office chair, the chair gains an
identity of an aesthetic design object and how this comes to mean the reformulation of the idea of ergonomics. The empirical
analysis also provides insight into how the somewhat grand discourses of soft capitalism or aesthetic economy are not
abstract, but very much grounded in everyday practices of an organization. The article establishes how the vision shared by
all the relevant actors invites active, flexible, and cooperative end-users and how the vision also has potential material effects.
The research is an ethnographically inspired case study that draws ideas from discursive psychology.

Yavetz, 2004; Strati & deMontoux, 2002; Valtonen, 2012;
Witz, Warhurst, & Nickson, 2003). This field of research
shows how the design of objects and spatial settings for mod-
ern organizations is also a physical embodiment of a specific
organization's culture and values. Sometimes, the display of
things and people is identified as presenting the values of
"knowledgeable capitalism" or "soft capitalism" (Chugh &
Hancock, 2009; Heelas, 2002, pp. 81-83; Thrift, 2005, pp.
20-47) or "aesthetic economy" (Böhme, 2003; Entwistle,
2009), while highlighting the soft characteristic of modern
work life: creativity, inspiration, emotions, and aesthetics.
Indeed, it would be naive to assume that the visions the
designers and producers promote would be somehow iso-
lated from larger cultural and societal values and discourses.
However, as part of this developing field of research, the
reformulation of ergonomics has yet not gained attention,
and this article aims to shed light on the specific meanings of
ergonomics and their possible consequences through a case
study of an office chair.
Central to the literature concerning soft capitalism is the
proposition that it is a form of capitalism that puts emphasis
on organizations as flexible entities that "go with the flow,"
always in action and on the move, aiming to produce workers
who fit this type of an organization. Flexible organizations
aim to recreate themselves by attempting to generate new
traditions and representations of themselves and the world,
instead of accepting established knowledge. In fact, the
refusal of established knowledge is the basic premise on
which these organizations are built. Also, one form of this
recreation is to promote new kinds of office buildings that
materialize and demonstrate the new flexible organization
usually by trying to maximize social interaction and innova-
tion (Thrift, 2005). The rhetoric of soft capitalism is the rhet-
oric of caring and sharing (Thrift, 2005), and it is concerned,
as already mentioned, with beauty, emotions, and playful-
ness (Chugh & Hancock, 2009). It strives to enhance com-
mitment and motivation (Heelas, 2002, p. 81), and tries to
create new slogans, transform information and knowledge to
find "fresh" ways to motivate employees and attract custom-
ers. This rhetoric identifies the success of an organization to
lie with culture, narratives, knowledge, and creativity rather
than with technologies, rationality, and cost­benefit calcula-
tions even though its practices have a strong utilitarian
dimension, and it is basically an attempt, as Paul Heelas
(2002) notes, to instrumentalize these soft values for eco-
nomic ends.
The literature concerning soft capitalism has some impor-
tant resonances with the work of Gernot Böhme (2003) as is
also pointed out by Shalene Chugh and Hancock (2009).
Böhme comes to the conclusion that we have entered into an
advanced phase of capitalism which may be characterized by
an aesthetic economy. By this, he means that the aesthetic
qualities of commodities have developed into an autonomous
value, a new type of use value. What is central here is the way
commodities can be attractive, add new feeling to places,
spaces, and people, and "serve to stage, costume and intensify
life" (Böhme, 2003, p. 72).
Böhme also introduces the concept of aesthetic labor
which refers to all those practices that "aim to give an appear-
ance to things and people, cities and landscapes, to endow
them with an aura, to lend them an atmosphere," and accord-
ing to Böhme, this concept encompasses all human activi-
ties, be it the activities of artists, designers, or producers, that
aim to "lend to things, people and ensembles that more which
goes beyond their handiness and objective presence."
Aesthetic laborers take part in the process of creating a new
value, a staging value, and here Böhme also expands the
definition of aesthetic labor to include more than just embod-
ied self-presentations of employees. He casts light on the
importance of analyzing the process of creating staging value
with all its practices, things, and people who interact to cre-
ate this something more (Chugh & Hancock, 2009). Joanne
Entwistle (2002, 2009) has also argued in favor of that view,
stating that although some research has been carried out on
the market conditions under which different cultural artifacts
with an aesthetic value are produced, there is currently a lack
of empirical work within different fields of cultural produc-
tion and services to allow us to truly map the diversity of
practices in which the aesthetic value is produced. And it is
precisely this process that my article discusses. The objective
of the article is how, in the process of producing an office
chair, the chair gains an identity of a special aesthetic design
object that has this something more, and how this also comes
to mean the reformulation of the idea of ergonomics. The
empirical analysis also aims to demonstrate how the some-
what grand discourses of soft capitalism or aesthetic econ-
omy are not mere abstractions but very much grounded in the
everyday practices and discourses of an organization.
The article proceeds as follows. Before representing the
results of the case study, I will discuss, in brief, ergonomics
as a historical and cultural idea. After that, the methodologi-
cal approach and the data used will be introduced in short.
The construction of a new vision is analyzed in detail in the
subsequent sections. The last section of analysis aims at
examining how the chair can be analyzed as an embodiment
of the new vision. In the concluding section, I present and
discuss the central findings.
The Idea of Ergonomics
Most often, "ergonomics" refers to a biomedical framework
which focuses on the measurable qualities of human­envi-
ronment interaction and the resultant stress to the body.
However, organizational and social issues that did not tradi-
tionally exist in the core of ergonomics have lately been con-
sidered to be gaining more relevance; therefore, the
integration of social scientific knowledge with ergonomics
has increased (Moray, 2008). For example, over the last few
Peteri 3
years, a field of ergonomics called macroergonomics, which
aims at creating certain novel guidelines for the practice of
ergonomics, has been gaining more importance (Caldwell,
2008; Haro & Kleiner, 2008; Theberge & Neumann, 2010).
It recognizes, among other things, the importance of organi-
zational culture, history, and goals and is also concerned with
the actual design processes of products and the organiza-
tions'environments. Yet, ergonomics and design as changing
cultural phenomenon in capitalism have so far not attracted
attention in empirical studies.
Work on chair comfort was started in earnest in the 1940s
and 1950s, around the same time as the term ergonomics was
introduced. However, the background for the idea of ergo-
nomics can be identified in the F.W. Taylor's scientific man-
agement and in the war efforts. As new weaponry was rushed
into mass production, it was soon realized that design deci-
sions affected performance and reliability in a major way
(Peteri, 2004; Pheasant, 1996). Scientific management pro-
moted the idea of different tasks being divided among experts
and different experts being separated spatially and seated in
different types of chairs. This idea developed into a hierar-
chical organization of chairs which has had a long-lasting
effect on office chair design. Typically, general office work-
ers, executives, and managers sit in chairs that reflect their
status in the company (Olivares, 2011).
After the Second World War in Great Britain, a group
consisting of members who had backgrounds in engineer-
ing, medicine, and human sciences formed a society that
was to study "human beings in their working environment,"
and the society came up with the word "ergonomics" to
describe what they were doing. All the members of the soci-
ety had been involved in research concerning the capacities
of soldiers (Pheasant, 1996). After the First and Second
World Wars, the cultural notion of "mental health" started to
change, as many soldiers were suffering from various psy-
chological symptoms that had before the wars been consid-
ered biological and more or less preexisting weaknesses in
the personality. It was realized that stressful circumstances
can produce "shell shock," temporary psychotic symptoms
(Crocq, 2005; Jarvis, 2009; Peteri, 2004; Rae, 2007). After
the wars, this new knowledge was taken into account when
designing workplaces and tools that would improve ergo-
nomics (Peteri, 2004).
Interest in ergonomics increased even further after the
first commercial computers based on transistors arrived.
Researchers who were interested in "human factors" started
to analyze people's cognitive styles and system design con-
cerning computers in the late 1960s and through the 1970s
(Grudin, 2006, pp. 405-407). Before the mid-1980s, ergo-
nomic furniture design focused on supporting the body; but
from the mid-1980s, ergonomic design had to support the
body for 8 consecutive hours of seated PC use. At that time,
the Council of the European Union passed legislation that set
minimum ergonomic standards to be met in the workplace.
This originated partly from an increased public awareness of
consumer goods' ability to either support or prevent health
and wellness--whether they were food, cigarettes, cars, or
office chairs (Olivares, 2011).
However, products were designed with the users' point of
view in mind even before the 1940s. The fact that things such
as chairs to sit and relax on have existed is a good example of
that.Already in the Victorian era, furniture called patent seat-
ing was developed to prevent spinal ill health. The patent
seating led the way for ergonomic furniture already 120
years before ergonomics as a term was coined. However, the
Victorian culture failed to appreciate the chair that was to
assist posture, and it was considered vulgar for anyone else
than the elderly or the disabled to use. In the Victorian era,
maintaining a dignified and upright posture specifically
without the help and support of furniture demonstrated
morality, sophistication, and willpower (Pynt & Higgs,
2008). This example further proves how good usability and
ergonomics, which were of course not the terms used at that
time, are not fixed and objective facts but culturally and his-
torically shaped.
In the late 19th century, the American architect Louis
Sullivan (1896) became famous for presenting the idea that it
is actually a natural law that form should always follow func-
tion, indicating that the functional considerations should deter-
mine the design of an object. However, in practice the products
designed by the representatives of the Modern Movement
were not that "user-centred"; rather, the early "functionalism"
came to mean just the lack of ornamentation:
According to this theory, functional objects are, of necessity,
aesthetically pleasing. This is called "functionalism." It was the
dominant theory underlying the so-called "Modern Movement"
in design. When we consider such modern classics as the Marcel
Breuer "Wassily" chair (1925) or the Mies van der Rohe
"Barcelona" chair (1929) we find very little relationship between
the form of these seats and that of the human body which it is
(presumably) their function to support. The fact that such pieces
are commonly referred to as "occasional chairs" implies that
they are without particular function-- except to be used
"occasionally." (Pheasant, 1996, p. 9)
The so-called Postmodern Movement in Arts argued
against the central ideas of functionalism. Corin Hughes-
Stanton (1968) claimed that postmodernism was less "anti-
puritanical and more humanistic than the modern school,"
and it means that "we may no longer (to give a single exam-
ple) have to choose between ergonomic but clinically dull
cars, and pleasure-giving but dangerous cars" (p. 43). In his
vision, postmodernism not only produced more variety, dec-
oration, playfulness, and flamboyance in design but also
acknowledged the importance of ergonomics. It is quite
interesting how in this context "modernism," with its striving
for designs that would serve a purpose for its users, is now
associated with antihumanism that ignores "all those other
human needs that give so much pleasure and satisfaction."
4 SAGE Open
In the 21st century, claims have emerged that follow the
basic argument of postmodernists and develop it a bit further
by arguing that aesthetically pleasing is actually naturally
functional. This argument goes on to say that functionality
should follow the form, as pleasurable objects are naturally
good for the users. Furthermore, it is argued that modern
design places far too much emphasis on usability and not
enough on the aesthetics that promote enjoyment and plea-
sure (e.g., Blythe & Wright, 2003; Norman, 2004; Tractinsky,
2006). Donald Norman, who has been one of the most prom-
inent advocates of user-centered design, has previously
argued (Norman, 1998) that the usability of everyday things
is the most important aspect of design. Recently, Norman has
claimed that the emotional aspect may after all be more
important, and that if things are attractive, they usually work
better. From that follows that as the products make people
happier, people will also become more creative and innova-
tive in their work (Norman, 2004). Lately, the idea (also
familiar from the rhetoric of the so-called soft capitalism)
that aesthetically pleasing, good looking, or "cool" office
design promotes inventions and inspiration has been widely
embraced by the business sector (e.g. Howell Hirt, 2012;
Youshaei, 2012), and when searching for information on the
Internet using search terms such as "good office design," it
soon becomes clear that especially information technology
(IT), advertising, and media companies such as Facebook,
Skype, Pixar, and Google are presented as leading the way
for this line of thinking.
By analyzing how my informants talk about ergonomics
in this study, I do not try to classify them as advocates of a
certain view of ergonomics. The interviewees employ exist-
ing and emergent cultural notions of ergonomics as concep-
tual resources by which they justify their notions. The history
of the idea of ergonomics and the writings related to soft
capitalism are relevant, because they provide background for
the interviewees' comments analyzed here. Economic forces
are at the core of ergonomics as they bring in the claims for
humans to adapt to working environments. Even though
ergonomics represents the "humanitarian argument in organ-
isation studies" (Hofbauer, 2000), from a sociological per-
spective it is also an ideological practice, which shapes
bodies, actions, and social relations.
Research Material and the
Methodological Approach
When I became interested in the practice of ergonomics in
the field of industrial design, especially in the context of
modern offices, I contacted a company that specializes in
ergonomic office furniture. I requested a permission from the
company's directors to gather information of their design
practices. Soon, I got an approval to join in and follow a
design process that we (the company's product manager, one
of the company's designers and I) decided would most prob-
ably be completed within the time that I had funding for this
research project (2009-2012) and which the product manager
also described as "a very interesting case."
I did not inform the company's directors in advance that I
was specifically interested in the practice of ergonomics, as I
already knew it to be their specialist field. Much to my sur-
prise, when I inquired about the ergonomic practices of the
company or of the different actors, the informants looked
mostly bewildered and/or uncomfortable and at times even
irritated. At first, I was at least as bewildered as my infor-
mants. As ergonomics concerning office furniture means two
different things, first, laboratory tests to prove that the prod-
uct passes the requirements of ergonomic standards, and sec-
ond, the designer's and the team's expertise to produce a
suitable chair for certain chosen situations and work tasks,
much of this knowledge is either standardized or probably
taken for granted, and therefore, difficult to articulate. It was
only later that I came to realize that maybe this very awk-
wardness itself contained something interesting, something
worth reflecting on.
My research is an ethnographically inspired case study of
an office chair. The fieldwork period lasted from September
2009 to summer 2012, and included observations about and
interviews at an organization, which specializes in producing
ergonomic office furniture and products. To get to know the
company, I began by exploring the company's annual reports
(2007-2008), and during the project, I continually followed
its website, Facebook page, and everything that was written
about it in magazines and newspapers. The fieldwork in the
company consisted of informal discussions regarding the
organization's design practices, studying documents express-
ing the guidelines for design and manufacture as well as
interviews with relevant actors. The project team that worked
on manufacturing this office chair consisted of several engi-
neers, two people from the marketing department, a market-
ing director, project manager, technical designer, and
industrial designer. The industrial designer was hired from
outside the company to work on this particular office chair.
The interviews took place either in the industrial designer's
firm, the company's head office, or in one of the company's
factories where the actual production, product development
meetings, and different laboratory tests took place.
For the purposes of this article, data that consist of informal
meetings and discussions, individual interviews with the
designer of the chair, the company's product manager, the
design director, and the design manager, along with the meet-
ings with the project team, have been analyzed.Altogether, the
data consist of 15 meetings that were not recorded (these took
place in the company's laboratory, company's restaurant or
during car journeys from the company's head office to the fac-
tory) and of seven individual interviews and five meetings of
the project team that were recorded and transcribed. The indi-
vidual interviews lasted from 1 to 2 hr, and the meetings with
the project team lasted from 1 to 3 hr. The data also include a
film lasting 30 min, where the designer explains and sketches
out the design process. This film was originally made for the
Peteri 5
staff who are involved in the production or selling of the prod-
ucts to "make them more motivated and involved in the proj-
ect," as described by the product manager in an interview. The
more informal discussions that were not recorded were written
down as field notes. For the purposes of this article, whenever
possible, I tried to find the data samples from the data that
were transcribed, so that I could show word for word how
informants described or justified something.
In addition, the data contain notes from project meetings
written by the technical designer, and a business abstract of the
chair (18 PowerPoint slides) created and written by the prod-
uct manager. The business abstract includes a "product portfo-
lio," which is an artifact used to evaluate, define, and justify
the place of the product in relation to the company's other
products and to similar products produced by competitors. The
portfolio is utilized to define the market "slot" the product is
intended for: which kinds of environments it is designed for,
and what the design and price indicate of its place among other
products. The data also include photos and field notes of the
international Stockholm Furniture Fair where the specific
chair was introduced and marketed for the first time.
The analytic approach has derived some ideas from dis-
cursive psychology. According to discursive psychology,
artifacts can be perceived as having invitation and inhibition
toward certain kinds of actions. An article by Brown and
Middleton (2006) draws basic ideas from discursive psy-
chology, and they assume the position that artifacts can be
conceived as material frameworks, which either enable or
constrain certain discourses or practices. They add that it is
reasonable to assume that objects place limits on the ways
they can be described and constructed in a discourse, but
they do not exist "just there." Instead of assuming that there
exists a given object world, which people describe through
"things as they are," they state that artifacts and workplace
communication can be approached by analyzing "how they
are formulated and described by speakers," and thus "the
mutual orientation of speakers to things is a discursive
accomplishment, which can be studied as such" (Brown &
Middleton, 2006, pp. 195-196). According to this point of
view, ergonomic knowledge is something that speakers and
actors construct in talk and use as a linguistic resource rather
than just possess. Hence, a focus on constructions in talk
requires the recognition of discourse as "strategies and mean-
ings" constructed in conversations. Discursive psychology
involves looking at the forms of language use, its contents
and functions. Through language, we find ways to speak
about objects and artifacts, which may have potential mate-
rial effects (Brown, Middleton, & Lightfoot, 2001).
The Chair as a Symbol of
Organizational Change
The company in question, which I shall refer to as Möbel to
preserve its anonymity, is an old Scandinavian family busi-
ness which designs and produces interior solutions for
working environments and public spaces. It is traditionally
well known for its high standards of ergonomic furniture and
is one of the largest companies in its sector in Europe. The
need to modify the brand or the narrative of the organization
has developed, as noted by the directors, on the realization
that the firm has established itself as a prominent actor in the
field of ergonomic office furniture. This vision of the com-
pany is so well established that, as Möbel's project manager
stated, the vision of good ergonomics has degraded other
essential images of the company:
You have to think of what is an individual product's synergy
with our strategy. We have this new slogan that we are launching,
Emotional Places, which I dig. In my line of work, it has been a
burden that Möbel is so strongly seen as a company that produces
good ergonomic office furniture. When architects design
separate spaces for individuals to work on their computers they
think of Möbel, but when they design lounges, entrance halls
and boardrooms, it is a different case. (November 2009)
It was clear from the outset that the manufacturers wanted
to produce a chair that would stand for the ongoing organiza-
tional change to gain that "synergy with the new strategy," as
the project manager stated. The chair and the products to fol-
low would compose a new "product family" and would also
advocate a new line of thinking for the whole organization,
both outside and inside the organization. In the business
abstract, the chair is described as embodying a "classic" line,
"emotional design" and "timeless design" that "will easily
adapt to different kinds of architectural environments."
The new way of thinking was also explained as distanc-
ing the company from the old-fashioned ways of making
decisions. One way to pursue this, as I learned from a
Scandinavian business magazine, was that the company
"snatched" a new design director from a globally well-
known IT company. The idea was that the new design direc-
tor would bring with him a more contemporary line of
thinking and making business, and one embodiment of that,
as the product manager stated, was the product portfolio that
the new design director had created after his arrival. This
particular design director described in an interview that the
way of thinking in Möbel was very old fashioned and
brought with it "a social democratic way of making deci-
sions" as opposed to a more "focused way that will also
enable more high profile products and no grey mass." This
is a discursive tactic known as a "contrast argument"
(Edwards & Potter, 1992, p. 163). A speaker makes his ver-
sion seem like a fact by contrasting it with an alternative that
seems unconvincing and like a bad choice.
In an interview, the project manager labeled the "old way"
as a "Swedish mode of discussing everything endlessly and
listening to everyone, so that before long every idea is viti-
ated." In a project meeting in spring 2010, the furniture
designer also commented on the progress of the project in an
ironic manner, and stated that he did not object to
"Scandinavian dynamics" as such "if we achieve a deep
6 SAGE Open
commitment," to which the technical designer replied that
the slowest part of the process was finally over, and it was
time to really get to work. All the key actors of the design
process frequently utilized a discursive construction of the
"old model" as a rhetorical act that needed no other justifica-
tions. It was a discursive resource that articulated, depending
on the context, a "natural connection" between the chair and
the new brand, or between the chair and a vision of the
changing world of modern offices. In these constructions, the
old vision is often geographically and politically localized: It
is a Swedish or Scandinavian way, the social democratic way
of thinking and making things. The new vision does not have
a similar kind of explicit geographical location or political
identity; although it seems evident that it is not a social dem-
ocratic view nor is it restricted geographically to Scandinavia.
Otherwise, identifying the old vision as Scandinavian and
social democratic would be senseless.
Below, the project manager describes the changes in mod-
ern work life, which are closely connected to the new vision
and design of this specific chair:
Working is so different nowadays, and people work in so many
different places. People work more at home and also, according
to a result of a recent research conducted by Kontor System
[name changed], nowadays, offices are more than just that . . .
they are meeting places. Modern work life is very fragmented:
people work in different places, they travel, they work in their
home offices, and increasingly, office spaces are becoming
meeting places, not so much reserved for individual standard
work stations anymore. People travel more, and not everyone
needs a separate desk. That produces challenges for this
collection as well. (...) So you have this lounge-like chair, where
you sit in a relaxed manner, and the communication is also
different. I believe that the furniture cultivates behaviour so that
when you have more casual colours and design, it is not a
meetinginatraditionalsenseanymore;rather,itisaconversation.
You can have a small side-table and your laptop on it, you can
check something, but you can also sit comfortably. Now you
have to sit stiffly on your small chairs at small tables, the four of
you. (November 2010)
Based on the data, it seems that the new organizational
culture or the brand of the company indicates a new mode of
thinking about work environments. As in the excerpt above,
they are no longer seen as offices or public spaces or lounges
or entrance halls or board rooms, but as the project manager
claims, first and foremost, as "meeting places." Thus, the
furniture would need to be more relaxed to support and pro-
duce freer and more inspirational conversations and meet-
ings. In the excerpt above, modern work life is seen as a
collection of fragments and different contexts where one
works. The connection between fragmented work tasks and
changing workplaces followed by a need to create more
places as meeting places is not obvious. One might even sug-
gest that fragmented work life could call for a counterbal-
ance in the form of more separate work stations, but the
project manager justifies his visions by referring to recent
research. Thus, his views have additional scientific basis and
do not seem to require further justification. The director pro-
vides details of the situation to emphasize the difference
between the old and new models.
The firm Kontor System (the name has been changed) that
produced the research project, which the project manager
uses as a justification for his visions, is a company that pro-
vides services for other companies renting office spaces. The
research project in question was carried out by several insti-
tutions, and Möbel was one of the sponsors and collaborators
of the project. The companies involved offered the cases for
the research project and the cases dealt, for example, with
mobility, open plan offices and new work space solutions. In
the research report, the cases were then explicitly described
as reflecting contemporary working life. This was not a
research result as such but adopted as a starting point for the
research project. Thus, this is a defining moment for the
vision and the design project, because at this point the vision
gained a new status and a new identity: It was not only a
vision in a utopian sense but it became scientific knowledge.
To put it bluntly, the companies fed the research project with
visions in the form of case studies that were defined as repre-
senting the recent developments of working life and spaces.
As quid pro quo, they gain a new status and identity for their
visions.
The old world of meetings and meeting spaces is con-
structed in the excerpt as a situation where people have to
"sit stiffly in small chairs." The lounge-like chair, which is
traditionally seen as not being intended for sitting on for long
durations, is now constructed as the ideal: It is more comfort-
able, and not only that, but it also produces more civilized
behavior. Therefore, the meeting is no longer a traditional
meeting but a "conversation." This vision implies a discus-
sion that is free of authoritarian aspects. It is a conversation,
where persons meet and share their views.
While the relevant actors represent the old model as an
antithesis of the new model of organizational culture, the
clear opposition between these models is actually ambiguous
when analyzed from a discursive point of view. The old
model was referred to, in various contexts of the interview,
as a "Swedish" or "Scandinavian" way of discussing things
indefinitely, and thereby wasting all chances for creating
anything really innovative. The new model seems to call for
an attitude toward work where sharing ideas and conversa-
tions is the most important and essential element of creating
new ideas and innovations. It seems that the old model stands
for constant discussions and the new model signifies more
conversations and less working alone. The difference seems
to be that the new model's conversations take place in more
open offices among the designed furniture that is defined as
more casual and free spirited. Thus, the workers of the new
model have their discussions in full view of everyone, and
these conversations are staged by special design furniture.
Peteri 7
In the first data sample, the project manager stated that "it
has been a burden that Möbel is so strongly seen as a com-
pany that produces good ergonomic office furniture." Thus,
the meanings attached to ergonomics are contradictory. On
one hand, it is one of their special fields of expertise and the
key element in their success, and on the other hand, it seems
to be one of the central reasons they have developed a need
to remold their brand and their vision.
The Reformulation of Ergonomics
When I inquired about the industrial designer's vision of
modern work spaces as the context for his products, he also
utilized the discursive resource of "the old model" of office
environments "when the static idea of ergonomics was the
central way to perceive things here in Scandinavia" and con-
tinues in an ironic manner "people were situated in lines in
their own workrooms doing the same work; it was like fac-
tory workers in office environments, but now it is more
mobile." And just a few sentences later in the interview, he
continues describing the office chairs that were created on
the basis of this old model:
They were passive chairs, and the expectation was that a persons'
neck and hands were to be in a certain fixed position. I do not
believe in that. I believe that the starting point has to be good,
but not fixed and static, and a human being herself needs to be
active. She has to get up, she has to reach for things, she has to
stretch in different directions, and raise her legs up and other
things as well. (December 2009)
Interestingly, in this extract, the ergonomic quality of a
chair is not constructed solely as a feature of the chair. More
emphasis is actually laid on the user of the chair. She has the
obligation to take responsibility of the ergonomics of the
chair; she has to stay on the move and not expect that
the office furniture will take care of her neck or hands.
Considered from a realistic point of view, this is a reasonable
argument, but when considered from a discursive perspec-
tive, the statement raises several questions. First, the con-
struction of an "old model" communicates a vision of office
work consisting of monotonous and repeated tasks, which
reminds one of factory work. Thus, the new open offices
seem to produce more interesting work and duties, whereas
separate workrooms encourage monotonous work. The new
open office and the furniture that goes with the new office
model also allow people to be more mobile and almost guide
them to be on the move. Consequently, the ergonomics of a
working environment becomes the responsibility of an indi-
vidual worker. A chair's role in this new setting is to encour-
age workers to be on the move. A chair needs to be good
enough to sit on but not so good that people would enjoy
remaining seated for long periods of time. The key element
of what might be called "new ergonomics" is actually that
the chair needs to be bad enough to encourage its users to get
up. The office chairs that have traditionally been considered
as ergonomic office chairs with their adjustable armrests,
backrests, and headrests are now redefined as passive chairs.
Consequently, in the "new ergonomics" the activity or pas-
sivity of a chair is not a feature of the chair but of the user.
In the meetings of the project team, the ergonomic quality
is very rarely discussed other than when referred to in an
ironic manner as belonging to an old-fashioned view on
designing for work environments. Once at a project meeting,
we got to sit on the prototypes of the chair, and each of us had
a chance to make a brief comment on the experience. Mostly
the comments could be interpreted as positive or neutral
("very nice" or "like it" or just "mmm"), the only exception
being the technical designer who claimed that the chair did
not fit his body type. Nobody responded to his comment, not
even the designer.
The ergonomic quality of the chair is most explicitly
addressed in the film that was produced in spring 2010 to
"motivate the employees" who take part in the production or
marketing of the chair. In the film, the designer describes a
certain feature of the chair that is typical for chairs he has
designed, and adds that this is "first of all, ergonomically
very well designed" and "enables good sitting position and
does not put pressure on the legs." Later in the film, the
designer announces that he has hopes of how the products
will be marketed, and notes that he wants to say something
more about the ergonomics of the chair: "If chairs were cho-
sen by vote, the customers would choose a chair that enables
only a passive sitting position." He continues that these
chairs "would remind one of children's car seats, which feel
safe, but in that position you cannot really move anything but
your fingers." He emphasizes the absurdity by acting as
being squeezed in a car seat in a position in which he looks
like he can only hold his hands above his shoulders and move
his fingers.
Apparently the ergonomic quality of a chair is something
that cannot be evaluated by the customers. The example of a
child's car seat, even though an anecdote, shows that custom-
ers' opinions and knowledge of ergonomics are quite infan-
tile, and the customers make choices that might feel "safe" or
good. Therefore, the sellers have to give advice, so that cus-
tomers do not make these easy mistakes. In other words, the
customers need to be directed, so that they do not choose
products that feel good, but from a designer's point of view,
do not function properly in new office environments that
need more active users.
The Embodiment of the New Vision of
Office Work
The active nature of this specific chair is often mentioned as its
most important feature. In practice, the chair is designed to be
flexible in a sense that it allows a tiny amount of movement. It
is not entirely firm and immobile, not a rocking-chair-like
8 SAGE Open
object, but elastic. This is congruent with the visions that con-
ceptualized workers who are, above all, mobile and share
relaxed conversations. The chair itself encourages small
movement. It is also consistent with the vision of modern
office spaces, in which employees do not have separate work
stations but use whatever free space there is in an overall open-
space office to either work on their laptops or have a chat with
coworkers or customers. Interestingly, this flexibility is never
mentioned as ergonomically good even though it enables vari-
ous sitting positions.
In the business abstract, the chair is described as "a uni-
versal chair," which will fit every kind of situation.According
to the designer, the flexibility of the chair enables it to be
used for several purposes: to work alone on the laptop, to eat
lunch, to have a casual conversation in a more relaxed sitting
position, or to have a more formal meeting.Also, the fact that
the chair is designed to resemble lounge furniture, as
explained by the project manager, invites workers to be on
the move and not remain seated for long periods of time.
The designer articulates in an individual interview and
also in a project meeting in spring 2010 that the design of the
chair becomes most apparent when there are many such
chairs in the same space. The designer then goes into saying
that several of these chairs together produce a "certain bal-
anced rhythm." The project manager also reflects that it is a
feature that can even be appreciated from a distance and
from outside the office building. Thus, the chairs compose a
form that is most distinctive only when viewed from a dis-
tance, for example, through large panorama windows.
Because of this, the directors decide that several chairs must
be tacked high up on a wall as the chair is presented at the
international Stockholm Furniture Fair. Otherwise, the "spe-
cial rhythm" that can only be properly appreciated from afar
would not be visible to the customers. This feature seems to
specifically suit an open-space office. Thus, it fits in well in
office buildings that have glass walls and are staged to be
viewed from outside to inside.
When the chair is introduced at the fair, the company
gives out a press release in which they state that they are
introducing a new vision of modern work life. This is a new
practice, since before this the press releases have just intro-
duced specific pieces of furniture. Now, the furniture is men-
tioned only in brief at the end of the press release. In other
words, now the company is selling a vision, and the furniture
is in a secondary position. The vision is taking the leading
role. The chair is introduced as an illustration of the vision, a
materialization of it.
With the production of this chair, the company also estab-
lishes several other new practices. The directors and the
designer report in individual interviews that in this specific
project, all the decision makers (i.e., the directors and the
designer) met several times even before starting the coopera-
tion to discuss the characteristics of the new brand and to
develop a shared understanding of the vision of new office
environments and also of what kind of special know-how
they expected the designer to bring along. According to the
interviewees, it was unusual for these meetings to take place
more than a year before any detailed plans of the specific
product existed. The directors explain that they wanted to be
sure that the designer grasped their whole vision. Then, the
directors made a deal with the designer that he would be
present in all the project meetings and would commit his
time to make a film where he would explain the story of the
chair. These were all new practices.
The project manager explains the need for these new pro-
cedures by saying that it is important that the chair is strongly
associated with the designer who has won several design
prizes, and that it would not be as convincing if the project
manager instead of the designer were to explain the meaning
of this chair and its position as part of the new brand and
vision to the engineers and marketing people. It is much
more "motivating" when the designer himself takes part in
the meetings and delivers the story. "Stories are vital when
you want to make a product sell," clarifies the project man-
ager. Thus, you could say that the directors utilize the
designer as a brand managing tool who sells the idea of the
new brand to their employees.
In the film, the designer explains the vision of changing
work environments, and thus delivers the main idea of the
new brand to the employees. He describes how the chair can
be recognized as a reflection of this vision. He also narrates
how the chair can be identified as his creation, because it has
certain details that resemble some features of northern nature
and wild life. Thus, the designer associates the individual
product as part of a larger entity of his entire work as a
designer, and thereby, individual chairs gain an identity as
aesthetic design objects that have a history longer than the
separate product as such. They are not just office chairs but
authentic design objects to be appreciated as part of a larger
entity and a long history. The designer incorporates authen-
ticity and originality not only into the product but also into
the new brand.
Conclusion
With the help of this case study, the article was able to pro-
vide insight into how material objects come to carry and
mediate "ideological meanings" (see Mazé & Redström,
2007) that may have very concrete impacts on organizational
practices and culture, and even on workers' health. In other
words, the reformulation of ergonomics does not only mean
new ideas and concepts but also very concrete material
effects on human bodies. Also, design is not only a matter of
aesthetics or usability but it is also about politics.
The contribution of this article is twofold. The article has
demonstrated how in the process of producing an office
chair, the chair gains a status of an aesthetic object. In addi-
tion, the empirical analysis provides insight into how soft
capitalism is grounded in the everyday practices and dis-
courses of the organization. The article analyzes how the
Peteri 9
reformulation of ergonomics in the company is intertwined
with a vision in line with the ideas of soft capitalism. In the
core of that vision is the aesthetic object which has to "speak"
the vision in its materialized form. The objects and artifacts
that convey the vision cannot be just any kinds of objects:
They have to have the status of an aesthetic design object.
Thus, establishing the vision as truth also means elevating
and ennobling the identity of the object as an aesthetic object.
The fact that when the chair is presented for the wider public
for the first time, it is being tacked up high on a wall above
our heads could, in a way, be seen as a reflection of its ele-
vated character. The chair is above the everyday life, and
thus, may even promise to raise us up and above the con-
straints of the mundane.
Despite being small-scale and thus to some extent
restricted, the article casts light on the process of creating
staging value with all its practices, things, and people who
interact to create this something more. The vision as a discur-
sive or rhetorical accomplishment is accompanied by several
practices and arguments that work to give the chair an iden-
tity of an aesthetic object and, hence, make it into a material-
ized form of the vision. The contrast argument works to
justify the vision on a discursive level; the research project
helps turn the utopia into a reflection of reality; the meetings
between the company's directors and the designer solidify
the vision as a shared goal; the new press release raises the
vision into a primary role, and the designer's presence at the
meetings and involvement in producing a "motivational"
film associate the chair more strongly with the vision and the
designer, and so the chair gains a status of a creation of an
award-winning designer. Thus, the status of an aesthetic
object comes into being as a result of multiple practices and
choices made by the directors of the company, the designer,
the marketing people, the researchers, and the consumers.
As those aforementioned practices and discursive means
strive to freeze the intentions of the manufactures, this pro-
cess can also be seen as domestication of the ideas of soft
capitalism. The vision manifests itself through this universal
chair in contrast with the Scandinavian or Swedish chairs
and practices emphasizing the local (as meaning here
restricted, passive, and narrow) nature of the "old" and tradi-
tional. Not only is this new chair global or international in
nature but pompously universal as well. In this context,
Scandinavian does not mean authenticity, purity, or equality
as in the marketing strategies of, for example, Ikea or some
Scandinavian cosmetic brands and clothing companies.
According to the vision, ergonomics belongs to the past, and
in the past it was very much the local way to perceive and
design things. Even though the roots of ergonomics are not
originally in Scandinavia, the fact that ergonomics is so
strongly associated with the Scandinavian context is linked
in the data with the idea of Scandinavia as a promised land of
technical engineering as well as the so-called social engi-
neering. However, the old way is never described in a matter
of fact way but with irony which could implicate that the
vision has not established itself as the dominant truth in
Scandinavia since otherwise there would be no reason to
ridicule the old way. Rather, it could just be presented as a
historical conception that no longer prevails.
As said before, although policy makers and academics
may share the opinion that the importance of ergonomics is
growing, in the data, ergonomics is constructed as almost the
keyword of a bygone age and of old-fashioned ideas.
Ergonomics is passé and not even fashionably retro. It is a
modernist dream that does not take into account the consum-
ers' supposed yearning for color, beauty, and mobility. The
juxtaposition of ergonomics and the so-called humanism has
its roots in the 1960s postmodernism that saw ergonomics as
too rational an idea lacking pleasure, playfulness, and flam-
boyance. Needless to say that those were not the original
aims of "ergonomics" as a developing idea and practice after
the World Wars. It was not developed to bring in the fun to
workplaces but to make them more efficient and safe. One
might think that ergonomics and good usability are fixed and
objective facts, but the article proves how they are culturally
and historically shaped. In soft capitalism, the office furni-
ture needs to be ergonomically bad enough to encourage the
users to take more responsibility of their own health.
The new vision is presented as politically neutral and
humane as it claims to offer more free-spirited meetings,
casual and colorful meeting spaces in contrast with the social
democratic way that produces gray mass and gray office
workers. Yesterday's ergonomic chairs are redefined as pas-
sive, and the new lounge-like furniture is presented as the
ideal. This "occasional chair" of the day is defined as more
user friendly in a novel way: Ergonomics ceases to be the
responsibility of the designer and the manufacturer, and
becomes the responsibility of the new mobile worker, part of
her self-discipline. If the Victorian age refused the basic
ideas of ergonomics to demonstrate sophistication and will-
power, our age refuses similar values to demonstrate the
staging power of things, mobility, and individuality of ideas
and people as well as to save money. Lounge-like furniture
goes with an open plan office that will save square footage
and reduce costs. The directors of the company also admit
this to be the case. There is no reason to hide it as it is con-
sidered a natural fact.
The new vision aims at creating a world consisting of
people, objects, and environments that compose a unity that
would "welcome" this product as a natural element with its
associations. The new vision is described as more demo-
cratic as it invites an open office where everything and
everyone are in view. The chair itself is democratic in that
sense that everyone, regardless of their status in the com-
pany, is seated in this very same universal chair. In other
words, in this context democracy does not mean one's own
personal space and ergonomic furniture but the same aes-
thetic design furniture and visibility for everyone. However,
this universal vision does not include everything and every-
body. The chair is suitable, for example, for working on a
10 SAGE Open
laptop but not even once is it mentioned as suitable for work-
ing on a desktop computer. Working alone is not part of this
universal idea. A room of one's own would hide the chair's
staging value, its special design, and the rhythm it is sup-
posed to create in an open office space.
