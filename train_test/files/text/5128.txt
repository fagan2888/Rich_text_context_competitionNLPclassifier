Expression of Genes That Influence
Cytoskeletal Organization and
Differentiation of Schwann Cells

Abstract
In the developing peripheral nervous system, a coordinated reciprocal signaling between Schwann cells and axons is crucial
for accurate myelination. The myelin and lymphocyte protein MAL is a component of lipid rafts that is important for targeting
proteins and lipids to distinct domains. MAL overexpression impedes peripheral myelinogenesis, which is evident by a delayed
onset of myelination and reduced expression of the myelin protein zero (Mpz/P0) and the low-affinity neurotrophin receptor
p75NTR. This study shows that MAL overexpression leads to a significant reduction of Mpz and p75NTR expression in primary
mouse Schwann cell cultures, which was already evident before differentiation, implicating an effect of MAL in early Schwann
cell development. Their transcription was robustly reduced, despite normal expression of essential transcription factors and
receptors. Further, the cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase signaling pathways
important for Schwann cell differentiation were correctly induced, highlighting that other so far unknown rate limiting factors
do exist. We identified novel genes expressed by Schwann cells in a MAL-dependent manner in vivo and in vitro. A number of
those, including S100a4, RhoU and Krt23, are implicated in cytoskeletal organization and plasma membrane dynamics. We
showed that S100a4 is predominantly expressed by nonmyelinating Schwann cells, whereas RhoU was localized within myelin
membranes, and Krt23 was detected in nonmyelinating as well as in myelinating Schwann cells. Their differential expression
during early peripheral nerve development further underlines their possible role in influencing Schwann cell differentiation
and myelination.

Introduction
During development of peripheral nerves, Schwann cells
are in tight contact with axons providing mutual trophic
support. Accurate Schwann cell development and myelin-
ation are controlled and regulated by reciprocal axon-glia
interaction (reviewed in Nave & Trapp, 2008). Although
axonal signals crucial for development were identified,
the process of differentiation and myelination is not yet
fully understood. One essential growth factor is neuregu-
lin1 (NRG1), which is shown to be involved in the regu-
lation of the entire Schwann cell lineage, encompassing
survival and proliferation of Schwann cell precursors as
well as myelination (reviewed in Garratt et al., 2000).
Also neurotrophins such as nerve growth factor (NGF),
brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and neuro-
trophin 3 (NT3) were shown to be critical for survival,
migration, and myelination (reviewed in Xiao et al.,
2009). Moreover, the correct localization of proteins
and lipids within distinct Schwann cell compartments
was shown to influence myelination. Such regulatory

mechanisms of signaling and trafficking were often
associated with glycolipid- and cholesterol-enriched
membrane domains, so-called lipid rafts (Kramer
et al., 1999; Schaeren-Wiemers et al., 2004; Schafer
et al., 2004).
One important component of lipid rafts is the myelin
and lymphocyte protein MAL (VIP17/MVP17), a nongly-
cosylated integral membrane protein with four transmem-
brane domains. MAL is localized in polarized epithelial
cells of the kidney, stomach, and thyroid gland and was
shown to be involved in the sorting and transport of ves-
icles to the apical membrane (reviewed in Frank, 2000).
MAL overexpression leads to pathological apical mem-
brane formation in kidney and stomach, demonstrating
that its correct dosage is essential for proper function
(Frank et al., 2000). In the nervous system, MAL is
expressed by oligodendrocytes in the central nervous
system (CNS) and by Schwann cells in the peripheral ner-
vous system (PNS; Schaeren-Wiemers et al., 1995a;
Schaeren-Wiemers et al., 1995b). MAL expression in
Schwann cells starts already at embryonic day 17, impli-
cating a role in development (Frank et al., 1999). It is
expressed by both myelinating and nonmyelinating
Schwann cells and is localized not only in compact
myelin but also in noncompact regions such as paranodal
loops and Schmidt-Lantermann incisures (Erne et al.,
2002). Mice overexpressing MAL manifest a retarded mat-
uration of Remak bundles and progressive segregation of
unmyelinated axons (Buser et al., 2009b; Frank et al.,
2000). Furthermore, mice overexpressing MAL show a
delayed onset of myelination, reflected in hypomyelinated
fibers during early development (Buser et al., 2009b).
Along with changes on the morphological level, altered
gene transcription and protein expression were detected
in MAL-overexpressing mice. In sciatic nerves of newborn
mice, reduced expression of the low-affinity neurotrophin
receptor p75NTR was identified (Buser et al., 2009b). These
results suggested that altered p75NTR expression in MAL-
overexpressing mice is the cause of delayed onset of mye-
lination, as distinct expression of p75NTR has been shown
to be important for proper initiation of myelination
(Cosgaya et al., 2002). Herein this study, we analyzed par-
ticular signaling pathways known to be relevant for
Schwann cell differentiation by investigating primary
mouse Schwann cell cultures treated with either forskolin
or NRG1 (Schmid et al., 2014). A whole genome expres-
sion profiling was further performed to identify MAL-
dependent differentially expressed transcripts.
Material and Methods
Mouse Line
The MAL-overexpressing mouse line was generated by
introducing a 34-kb insert of the cosmid pTCF-
MAL2.1, containing the Mal gene, which is flanked by
8 kb of upstream nontranscribed region (Frank et al.,
2000; Magyar et al., 1997). MAL is overexpressed in a
tissue- and cell-specific manner, and pathological alter-
ations were previously described (Buser et al., 2009b;
Frank et al., 2000). MAL-overexpressing mice were rou-
tinely bred with C57/Bl6 mice, and heterozygous mice
with respective wild-type littermates were used in this
study. All mice were kept under standard specific patho-
gen-free conditions, housed, and treated according to the
guidelines for care and use of experimental animals of the
veterinary office of the Canton of Basel-Stadt.
Primary Mouse Schwann Cell Cultures
Schwann cells were prepared as described earlier (Schmid
et al., 2014). Sciatic nerves from postnatal day 1 (P1) mice
were dissociated with 0.4% collagenase and 0.125% tryp-
sin, Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM; D6546;
Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine
serum (FBS) was added, and cells were seeded onto 24-
well plates (PrimariaTM, BD Bioscience). A day after,
Schwann cells were treated with 10 mM cytosine b-D-arabi-
nofuranoside (AraC) twice for 24 h to reduce fibroblast
proliferation. Schwann cells were passaged, and cells of
the respective genotype were pooled and cultured in
DMEM containing 10% FBS, unless not otherwise
stated. For mRNA expression analysis, primary
Schwann cells were seeded at a density of 25,000 cells/
well. For immunofluorescence analysis, 15,000 Schwann
cells were seeded on poly-D-lysine and laminin-coated
glass coverslips in a 40-ml drop. Purity of mouse Schwann
cell cultures determined by immunofluorescent stainings
for p75NTR and S100b revealed more than 85% enrichment
(information about antibodies in Supplementary Table 1).
For Schwann cell differentiation assay, cells were sti-
mulated with 20 mM forskolin (Sigma-Aldrich) in
DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS for 24 h as
described earlier (Schmid et al., 2014). For investigation
of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3-kinase) activity,
Schwann cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented
with 1% FBS for 15 h and then treated with 2.5 nM
human recombinant heregulin-b1 (herein called neuregu-
lin1; Sigma-Aldrich) in DMEM supplemented with 1%
FBS for 15 min at 37C (Ogata et al., 2004).
Expression Analysis
Schwann cells were washed with phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS), and total RNA was isolated using RNeasy
Micro Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's
protocol. First-strand cDNA synthesis was performed
using Transcriptor Reverse Transcriptase (Roche) and
random hexamer primers (Roche). Primers for quantita-
tive reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction
2 ASN Neuro
(qRT-PCR) were designed with Clone Manager software
(Science and Educational Software) or with NCBI
PrimerBLAST. Primer pairs were chosen to overlap
exon/intron junctions to prevent amplification of gen-
omic DNA (Supplementary Table 2). qRT-PCR was per-
formed on the 7500 Fast Real-time PCR System (Applied
Biosystems) with Fast SYBR Master Mix (Applied
Biosystems). The acquired mRNA copy numbers were
normalized to the one of the 60S ribosomal protein sub-
unit L13a. For the graph of Mpz and p75NTR, values
represent the mean of at least 20 independent experiments
for unstimulated and at least 9 independent experiments
for stimulated primary Schwann cells [Figure 1(a) and
(b)]. For qRT-PCR analysis of Sox10, Oct6, Krox20,
cJun, Krox24, Egr3, and Mag, data represent the mean
of at least nine independent experiments [Figure 1(c)].
For the in vivo analysis, sciatic nerves of two MAL-over-
expressing mice and respective wild-type littermates were
pooled, and total RNA was isolated with the ZR RNA
MicroPrepTM Kit (Zymo Research). First-strand cDNA
synthesis was performed using GoScriptTM reverse tran-
scriptase (Promega) and random hexamer primers
(Roche). qRT-PCR was performed on the ViiATM 7
Real-time PCR System (Applied Biosystems) with
KAPA Sybr Fast Master Mix (Kapa Biosystems). The
acquired mRNA copy numbers were normalized to the
one of the 60S ribosomal protein subunit L13a.
Determination of PI3-Kinase Activity by Measuring
Phospho-Akt Levels
To determine the phospho-Akt levels in vivo, sciatic
nerves of four newborn MAL-overexpressing and wild-
type littermates were collected per experiment.
Homogenization of the nerve tissues was performed in
lysis buffer (20 mM phosphate buffer pH 7.4, 250 mM
NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, and 0.1% sodium dodecyl sul-
fate [SDS]) with complete protease inhibitor mixture
(Roche), 5 mM NaF, and 1 mM Na3
VO4
using Lysing
Matrix D tubes (MP Biomedicals) in a FastPrep FP120
homogenizer (MP Biomedicals) for 30 s at 6.0 m/s. The
homogenate was incubated in 4Â Laemmle buffer and
20% b-mercaptoethanol for 1 h at 37C. Protein separ-
ation on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis
(PAGE) gel, protein transfer, and antibody incubations
were performed as described earlier (Buser et al., 2009b).
Immunofluorescent signal detection was investigated by
the OdysseyTM Imaging System (LI-COR) and quantified
using ImageJ. The expression levels were normalized to
the one of b-actin.
Whole Genome Expression Profiling
MAL-overexpressing and wild-type Schwann cells were
cultured and stimulated with 20 mM forskolin for 24 h
(Schmid et al., 2014). Nine experimental samples were
investigated per condition, derived from five independent
experiments. Total RNA was isolated using RNeasy
Micro Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's
protocol. All RNA samples had an RNA integrity
number (RIN) of above 8, verified with the Agilent
Bioanalyzer system (Agilent Technologies). RNA ampli-
fication, biotinylation, in vitro transcription, and cRNA
hybridization were performed as described earlier (Kinter
et al., 2013; Schmid et al., 2014). MouseWG-6 v2.0
Expression BeadChips from Illumina were scanned
using the iScan Reader (Illumina), and global median
normalization of gene expression was performed with
the GenomeStudio software (version 2011.1, Illumina).
All data passed the quality control analysis as assessed
by the Illumina on-board software (GenomeStudio, ver-
sion 2011.1) and principal component analysis (PCA;
Partek Genomics Suite, version 6.6, Partek Inc.).
Significantly differentially expressed genes were further
analyzed with the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) soft-
ware (Ingenuity Systems) and the Database for
Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery
(DAVID, version 6.7, DAVID Bioinformatics
Resources; Huang da, Sherman, & Lempicki, 2009).
Immunofluorescent Microscopy
Cultured Schwann cells were rinsed with PBS and fixed in
4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min. After washing
three times with PBS for 30 min, unspecific binding sites
were impeded by incubation with blocking buffer con-
taining 1% normal donkey serum (Chemicon Int.), 2%
cold fish skin gelatin (Sigma-Aldrich), and 0.15% Triton
X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich) in PBS for 1 h at room tempera-
ture. Primary antibodies (Supplementary Table 1) were
incubated in blocking buffer at 4C overnight.
Fluorochrome-conjugated secondary antibodies were
diluted in blocking buffer and incubated for 1 h at room
temperature. Stained sections were embedded in
FluorSave (Calbiochem). For in vivo immunofluorescent
stainings, 10-mm tissue sections of fresh-frozen sciatic
nerves of 3-month-old MAL-overexpressing mice and
wild-type littermates were mounted on Superfrost Plus
slides (Thermo Scientific), dried at room temperature,
and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min. After
washing three times for 30 min with PBS, slides were
incubated in 80% ethanol for 1 h and thereafter washed
with PBS. Further procedure was performed as described
earlier. Immunofluorescent images were acquired with
either a Nikon A1R microscope (40Â objective, numer-
ical aperture 1.30) or with a Zeiss LSM710 microscope
(40Â objective, numerical aperture 1.30; 63Â objective,
numerical aperture 1.40). For quantification of phospho-
Akt staining, 400 nonoverlapping images per genotype
and condition were acquired. For each image, a threshold
Schmid et al. 3
level of 2 to 255 was set, and the average staining inten-
sity was recorded. The mean of this value was determined
for each coverslip (50 images) and then for each condi-
tion. The average staining intensity was calculated over
three independent experiments. Image processing was
performed with ImageJ 1.47 b software and Adobe
Photoshop software (version CS5.1).

MAL Overexpression Leads to Decreased Mpz and
p75NTR Expression in Primary Schwann Cell
Cultures
From our developmental study on PNS myelination, we
observed that MAL overexpression retarded the onset of
myelination (Buser et al., 2009b). Therefore, we investi-
gated whether Schwann cells overexpressing MAL are
less responsive to stimuli for Schwann cell differentiation
in vitro. Schwann cells isolated from sciatic nerves of P1
MAL-overexpressing mice and wild-type littermates were
treated for 24 h with 20 mM forskolin, a generally used
reagent to activate the cAMP response element-binding
protein (CREB) and to induce the expression of myelin-
related genes (Lemke & Chao, 1988; Monje et al., 2009;
Parkinson et al., 2003; Schmid et al., 2014). Subsequently,
differential gene expression was analyzed by qRT-PCR.
Schwann cells derived from MAL-overexpressing mice
showed a robust overexpression of Mal mRNA also
in vitro under both treated and untreated conditions
(data not shown). Schwann cell differentiation upon for-
skolin treatment was determined by the induction of
myelin protein zero (Mpz/P0) expression. In wild-type
Schwann cells, a 6.5-fold induction of Mpz mRNA
expression was detected upon stimulation with forskolin
[Figure 1(a)]. The increase of Mpz expression upon treat-
ment was comparable between MAL-overexpressing and
wild-type cells. However, Schwann cells derived
from MAL-overexpressing mice showed an overall 50%
reduction of Mpz mRNA expression under both unstimu-
lated (p < 0.0001) and stimulated (p < 0.007) conditions
[Figure 1(a)].
Expression of p75NTR in wild-type Schwann cells was
reduced approximately 35% by forskolin stimulation
[Figure 1(b), wtþ], corresponding to the in vivo situation
in which p75NTR expression was downregulated during
myelination (Buser et al., 2009b). Along with the reduced
expression of Mpz, untreated Schwann cells overexpres-
sing MAL manifested a 25% reduction in p75NTR mRNA
expression compared with wild-type cells [p < 0.0001;
Figure 1(b)], confirming the in vivo situation (Buser
et al., 2009b). As for wild-type cells, forskolin treatment
led to a 30% decrease of p75NTR expression level in
MAL-overexpressing Schwann cells [Figure 1(b)], and
still, a reduction of 20% compared with wild-type cells
could be detected (p < 0.006).
The expression levels of Sox10, Oct6, Krox20, cJun,
Krox24, Egr3, and Mag were investigated in primary
unstimulated mouse Schwann cell cultures [Figure 1(c)]
to determine whether the reduced mRNA level of Mpz
and p75NTR was possibly caused by the altered expression
of transcription factors known to modulate their expres-
sion (Bermingham et al., 1996; Gao et al., 2007; Jaegle
et al., 1996; Peirano et al., 2000; Topilko et al., 1994). In
MAL-overexpressing Schwann cells, Sox10 expression
was slightly reduced (p < 0.08), validating previous
in vivo observations (Buser et al., 2009b). However,
expression of the transiently activated transcription
factor Oct6 was increased in MAL-overexpressing
Schwann cells (p < 0.06). Furthermore, the expression of
Krox20 was significantly increased in MAL-overexpres-
sing Schwann cells compared with wild-type cells
(p < 0.005). As a negative regulator for myelination, the
expression of cJun was investigated (Parkinson et al.,
2008), although no altered transcription was detected in
MAL-overexpressing Schwann cells. The transcription
factors Krox24 and Egr3 were investigated due to their
ability to modulate p75NTR expression (Gao et al., 2007),
but the expression levels of both transcripts were not sig-
nificantly changed. In contrast to Mpz, MAL overexpres-
sion did not influence the expression of the myelin-
associated glycoprotein (Mag), which is also early
expressed during Schwann cell development.
Our results demonstrate that the activation of the
CREB signaling pathway is not affected by MAL over-
expression and did not improve reduced Mpz and p75NTR
expression in MAL-overexpressing Schwann cells. Our
analysis further revealed that Mpz and p75NTR were
already reduced in unstimulated Schwann cells overex-
pressing MAL, suggesting that alteration in gene regula-
tion due to MAL overexpression is taking place at an
early stage of Schwann cell development.
Phosphorylation of Akt Is Not Altered in
MAL-Overexpressing Schwann Cells
As the activation of the CREB signaling pathway seemed
to be unaffected by MAL overexpression, we investigated
whether the decreased Mpz expression in MAL-overex-
pressing mice is caused by a reduced activation of the
PI3-kinase pathway, a major signaling pathway in
Schwann cells required for myelination. Protein expres-
sion levels of total Akt and phosphorylated Akt, a key
effector of PI3-kinase, were measured in sciatic nerves of
newborn mice by quantitative Western blot analysis. In
MAL-overexpressing mice, both total Akt and phos-
phorylated Akt were expressed at normal levels
[Figure 2(a)]. To determine the activation of Akt, the
ratio of phosphorylated Akt to total Akt was assessed
[Figure 2(b)]. This ratio was similar between MAL-
overexpressing and wild-type nerves, indicating that
delayed onset of myelination in MAL-overexpressing
mice was not due to reduced Akt phosphorylation.
Investigation of p75NTR expression was included as an
Schmid et al. 5
internal control, and its expression was decreased by 30%
in newborn MAL-overexpressing mice, validating previ-
ous observations (Buser et al., 2009b).
In parallel, we investigated Akt phosphorylation in
primary mouse Schwann cell cultures. MAL-overexpres-
sing and wild-type Schwann cells were treated with
2.5 nM NRG1 for 15 min to induce Akt phosphorylation
in vitro, and the activation of Akt was determined
by immunofluorescence for phosphorylated Akt
[Figure 2(c) and (d)]. We analyzed the mean intensity of
the phospho-Akt immunofluorescence in stimulated and
unstimulated cells of both genotypes. NRG1 treatment
resulted in a significant 3.5-fold induction of phosphory-
lated Akt in wild-type Schwann cells [p < 0.0001; Figure
2(c) and (d)], which is consistent with previous results in
rat Schwann cells (Ogata et al., 2004). A comparable
induction was observed for Schwann cells derived from
MAL-overexpressing mice. In MAL-overexpressing
Schwann cells, phosphorylation of Akt was unaltered in
either condition compared with wild-type cells, which is
in line with the in vivo observation. Schwann cell
morphology was not changed during NRG1 treatment,
verified by a comparable distribution of p75NTR staining
(data not shown). From our data, we conclude that
delayed onset of myelination in MAL-overexpressing
mice was not caused by impaired activation of the PI3-
kinase/Akt pathway, as phosphorylation of Akt was
unaltered in sciatic nerves of newborn mice overexpres-
sing MAL. Further, comparable staining intensities of
phosphorylated Akt were detected between MAL-over-
expressing and wild-type Schwann cell cultures, indicat-
ing that induction of the PI3-kinase/Akt pathway is
functional.

nerves derived from newborn MAL-overexpressing mice and wild-type littermates were analyzed by quantitative Western blot analysis. A
representative blot for p75NTR, Akt, and phosphorylated Akt (Ser 473) was used for illustration. (b) The activation of Akt pathway,
indicated by the ratio phospho-Akt to Akt showed no alteration in MAL-overexpressing nerves, whereas p75NTR protein expression was

expression. Columns represent the mean value of three independent experiments, and the error bars indicate the SD. (c)
Immunofluorescence stainings on primary MAL-overexpressing and wild-type Schwann cells were performed with an antibody recognizing
phosphorylated Akt (Ser 473). Cells were stimulated with 2.5 nM neuregulin1 for 15 min, and an induction of Akt phosphorylation was
detected for both genotypes. DAPI as a nuclear marker was used for counterstaining. Bar: 50 mm. (d) Quantification of the mean signal

transcripts was performed for primary mouse Schwann
cell cultures. In total, nine independent samples of
untreated and forskolin-treated Schwann cells derived
from MAL-overexpressing mice and wild-type littermates
were analyzed. One coding DNA sequence may be repre-
sented by several distinct oligonucleotides (probes). For
all examinations, probe-specific analysis was performed,
allowing to identify MAL-dependent differentially
expressed transcripts with high confidence. To investigate
the effect of MAL overexpression on global gene expres-
sions, data were visualized by an initial PCA generated in
Partek Genomics Suite (Supplementary Figure 1). This
analysis revealed that treatment with forskolin was the
major source of variability. Based on the genotype, no
distinct clustering of MAL-overexpressing and wild-type
samples was detected, suggesting that only a small
number of genes were differentially regulated in
Schwann cells overexpressing MAL.
In a first step, we analyzed the mRNA expression
levels of transcription factors that are implicated in
Schwann cell development, differentiation, and myelin-
ation (Table 1, A). This analysis revealed a small but
significant reduction of Sox10 mRNA expression in
MAL-overexpressing Schwann cells. In general, however,
transcription factors known to positively or negatively
modulate Schwann cell differentiation and myelination
were not altered in MAL-overexpressing Schwann cells.
Analysis of the expression pattern of receptors implicated
in neuregulin or neurotrophin signaling (e.g., ErbB2,
ErbB3, TrkB, TrkC) also revealed no significant changes
in MAL-overexpressing Schwann cells (Table 1, B).
However, p75NTR mRNA levels were significantly
reduced, validating data obtained by qRT-PCR.
Analysis of myelin-related gene transcripts showed the
expected increase of Mal in MAL-overexpressing
Schwann cells, and the reduced expression of Mpz upon
MAL overexpression could be confirmed (Table 1, C). In
addition, a significant reduction of 2',3'-cyclic nucleotide
3' phosphodiesterase (Cnp) and the proteolipid protein
plasmolipin (Pllp) was identified in MAL-overexpressing
Schwann cells, which was validated by qRT-PCR
(Supplementary Figure 2). Like MAL, plasmolipin is a
component of lipid rafts and shares some structural simi-
larities (Bosse et al., 2003; Magyar et al., 1997). Both
tetraspans are expressed in the CNS, the PNS and in
the apical membrane of tubular epithelial cells in the
kidney (Cochary et al., 1990; Zacchetti et al., 1995),
underlining a putative functional relationship between
MAL and plasmolipin. The expression of other myelin-
related transcripts seemed not to be affected in MAL-
overexpressing Schwann cells.
A closer look at gene sequences associated with the
extracellular matrix (ECM) revealed significant reduction
of a-dystrobrevin (Dtna) and dystroglycan (Dag1), two
members of the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex
(Table 1, E). Transcripts of other members of this com-
plex were either expressed below background levels or
were unaltered (Dtnb, Sgcd, Snta1-Sntg2, and Utrn).
This was also the case for the different isoforms of integ-
rin and laminin as well as for entactin (nidogen, Nid1/2)
and the proteoglycans agrin (Agrn), perlecan (Hspg2),
and bamacan (Smc3). However, significantly increased
expression levels of collagen type II a1 (Col2a1) and col-
lagen type IV a5 (Col4a5) transcripts were detected in
MAL-overexpressing Schwann cells, whereas comparable
expression levels for collagen type V and VI were
observed. Investigation of genes implicated in polarity
revealed normal mRNA expression levels in MAL-over-
expressing Schwann cells (Dlg1, Pard3, and Dock7).
In summary, we identified that transcripts of a small
number of genes known to be involved in Schwann cell
development were differentially expressed in MAL-over-
expressing Schwann cells, but the consistent reduction of
Mpz and p75NTR expression cannot be explained by these
changes.
MAL-Dependent Differential Gene Expression in
Schwann Cells
To further investigate the effect of MAL overexpression
on gene transcription, microarray data were analyzed
more stringently using an FDR-adjusted p value
of < 0.05. This study revealed that the mRNA expression
levels of 15 genes were highly significantly reduced in
MAL-overexpressing Schwann cells, whereas those of 7
genes were increased (Table 2). Literature search revealed
that the expression of most of these genes has not yet
been reported in Schwann cells.
In MAL-overexpressing Schwann cells, substantial
transcriptional reduction was detected for the glutamic
acid decarboxylase 2 (Gad2/Gad65), the asialoglycopro-
tein receptor 1 (Asgr1), the ectonucleoside triphosphate
diphosphohydrolase 2 (Entpd2), and the intermediate fila-
ment keratin 23 (Krt23). MAL overexpression resulted
also in reduced mRNA expression levels of the proteo-
glycan synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2B (Sv2b), the
TRAF2 and NCK interacting kinase (Tnik), the GTP-
binding protein Di-Ras1 (Diras1), and the chloride chan-
nel calcium-activated 4 (Clca4). In addition, significant
reduction of mRNA expression levels could be detected
for the vesicle amine transport protein 1 homolog-like
(Vat1l), the member 10 of the immunoglobulin superfam-
ily (Igsf10), as well as the glycolysis-influencing gene
6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-biphosphatase 4
(Pfkfb4). A comparable reduction was identified for the
ionotropic glutamate receptor AMPA1 (Gria1/GluR-A/
Glur1), the ras homolog family member U (RhoU/
Wrch1), and a-dystrobrevin (Dtna).
In MAL-overexpressing Schwann cells, significantly
increased expression levels of Mal were detected, serving

as a positive control. Further, increased mRNA expres-
sion levels were observed for the monooxygenase DBH-
like 1 (Moxd1), the secreted signaling protein Wnt16, as
well as the tropomyosin- and nonmuscle myosin II-bind-
ing protein S100a4/Mts1. Upon MAL overexpression,
the intracellular lipid receptor oxysterol-binding pro-
tein-like 3 (Osbpl3), the water channel aquaporin 1
(Aqp1), and the transcriptional cofactor LIM domain-
binding 2 (Ldb2) were also identified to be significantly
increased.
To detect putative functional clustering of the MAL-
dependent differentially expressed genes, a hierarchical
cluster analysis was performed (Supplementary Figure
3). This analysis revealed an unambiguous separation
between untreated and treated Schwann cells, indicating
that the hierarchical clusters of genes were primarily
influenced by their expression changes upon forskolin
treatment. Further, most of the samples of the respective
genotype clustered within the same stimulation condition.
However, a functional clustering of particular gene
sequences was not evident.

The expression pattern of the newly identified differen-
tially expressed transcripts in Schwann cells overexpres-
sing MAL was further investigated in sciatic nerves of

development, differentiation, and myelination were unaltered in MAL-overexpressing cells. Based on a probe-specific analysis, several probes per coding
DNA sequence were analyzed separately. The expression was normalized to the global median, and data indicate the ratio of expression in MAL-over-
expressing to wild-type Schwann cells. Unadjusted p 0.01 was accounted as significant (bold); n.s. ¼ not significant.

Dtna, for which no differential expression was observed
in peripheral nerve tissue neither at early nor at later
developmental time points (P10, P20, adult, data not
shown). As expected, the strong induction of Mal
mRNA levels could be confirmed in MAL-overexpres-
sing nerves at both investigated time points [Figure
3(b)]. This was also the case for S100a4 mRNA expres-
sion that was significantly increased in MAL-overex-
pressing nerves, in line with the in vitro observation.
In comparison to primary mouse Schwann cell cultures,
no differential expression of Osbpl3, Aqp1, and Ldb2
was detected in vivo, and Clca4, Moxd1, and Wnt16
were expressed below background levels. These results
demonstrate that MAL-overexpression influences tran-
scriptional regulation of most of the newly identified
genes both in vitro and in vivo, suggesting a functional
relevance in Schwann cells.
S100a4 Is Predominantly Expressed in
Nonmyelinating Schwann Cells
Cytoskeletal dynamics is crucial for Schwann cell devel-
opment. For S100a4, which regulates the cytoskeleton
organization by promoting the disassembly of myosin II
filaments (Li et al., 2003), significantly increased mRNA
expression levels were observed upon MAL overexpres-
sion both in vivo and in vitro. For this reason, the spatial
protein expression pattern of S100a4 was investigated
(Figure 4). In primary Schwann cell cultures, immuno-
fluorescent microscopy revealed that all Schwann cells,

Figure 4. Investigation of the spatial expression pattern of S100a4 in cultured Schwann cells and in sciatic nerves. Immunofluorescent
microscopy revealed a strong cytoplasmic S100a4 expression in a subpopulation of cultured Schwann cells (a, arrow). Due to this strong
immunofluorescent signal, the acquisition time was reduced, and therefore, cells still considerably expressing S100a4 appeared only weakly
positive (a, asterisk). (b) In contrast to S100a4, p75NTR signal was observed at a homogenous intensity level, indicating that those cells
belong to the Schwann cell lineage. (c) Analysis of S100a4 mRNA levels revealed robustly increased expression levels in sciatic nerves
derived from MAL-overexpressing mice at all investigated time points. Data were normalized to the expression of 60s, and P0 wild-type

identified by p75NTR [Figure 4(b)], expressed S100a4, but
a subpopulation of Schwann cells showed very high
expression of S100a4 in the cytoplasm [Figure 4(a),
arrow].
We further investigated the expression of S100a4
in vivo. In addition to P0 and P5, significantly increased
mRNA expression levels of S100a4 were also detected at
P10, P20, and in adult mice overexpressing MAL
[Figure 4(c)]. The spatial expression pattern of S100a4
was also investigated on transversal sciatic nerve sections
of 3-month-old MAL-overexpressing and wild-type mice.
We detected a strong S100a4 immunofluorescent signal in
Remak bundles in MAL-overexpressing mice, identified
as Mbp-negative areas [Figure 4(d), arrows]. Remak bun-
dles in MAL-overexpressing nerves are readily identifi-
able due to progressive segregation of unmyelinated
axons observed in these mice (Buser et al., 2009b) and
due to expression of p75NTR, a marker for nonmyelinat-
ing Schwann cells [Figure 4(e), arrows]. In wild-type mice,
only weak S100a4 immunofluorescent signal was detected
in Remak bundles, confirming increased S100a4 expres-
sion in MAL-overexpressing mice not only on mRNA
but also on protein levels [Figure 4(f), arrows]. In sum-
mary, our data show that the expression levels of S100a4
mRNA and protein, a regulator of the cytoskeleton
organization, were upregulated upon MAL overexpres-
sion in vitro and in vivo. Further, we detected S100a4
protein to be predominantly expressed in nonmyelinating
Schwann cells.
Cellular Expression Pattern of RhoU and Krt23 in
Schwann Cells
We further investigated the expression pattern of RhoU
and Krt23, which are also known to be involved in
cytoskeleton organization, and were significantly
reduced by MAL overexpression both in cultured
Schwann cells and in sciatic nerves of newborn mice.
First, their spatial localization was investigated in cul-
tured primary mouse Schwann cells. The Cdc42-related
superfamily member RhoU was localized throughout
the cytoplasm [Figure 5(a), arrows], within membrane
protrusions [Figure 5(a), arrowheads] as well as along
Schwann cell processes [Figure 5(a), open arrowhead].
Immunofluorescent microscopy for the intermediate fila-
ment Krt23 detected a punctated staining pattern in the
cytoplasm [Figure 5(d), arrows] and in membrane pro-
trusions [Figure 5(d), arrowhead]. Further, Krt23
immunofluorescence could be identified within and
along Schwann cell processes [Figure 5(d), open arrow-
head]. In addition to cultured Schwann cells, the expres-
sion pattern of RhoU and Krt23 was investigated on
transversal sciatic nerve sections of adult mice
[Figure 5(b), (c), (e), and (f)]. RhoU protein was
detected within the myelin sheath [Figure 5(b),
arrows], identified by Mbp [Figure 5(c), arrows], but
not in nonmyelinating Schwann cells in Remak bundles
[Figure 5(c), encircled area]. For Krt23, a punctated
staining was observed in myelin membranes
[Figure 5(e) and (f), arrows] as well as in nonmyelinating
Schwann cells [Figure 5(f), encircled area].
Our data show that RhoU was localized within myelin
membranes, and Krt23 was detected in nonmyelinating as
well as in myelinating Schwann cells, indicating that over-
expression of MAL influences both nonmyelinating and
myelinating Schwann cells.
Analysis of Annotation Tags for Significantly Altered
Genes in MAL-Overexpressing Schwann Cell
Cultures
A possible common functional role of the 15 genes, whose
transcripts were highly significantly decreased in MAL-
overexpressing Schwann cells, was investigated by the
IPA of Ingenuity Systems and the DAVID. No common
signaling pathway, protein­protein interactions, or
common transcriptional regulator for those genes was
identified. However, functional annotation charts
revealed that almost one third of the investigated genes
(Asgr1, Gria1, Gad2, and Rhou) were associated with the
term palmitate (p < 0.0005, indicating that these genes are
specifically associated with this term more often than
would be expected by chance). All of them were also
reduced in vivo, suggesting a functional role in Schwann
cells. Palmitoylation has been shown to be important for
efficient targeting of myelin proteins to the plasma mem-
brane (Schneider et al., 2005). These data support the cur-
rent concept for the functional role of MAL in sorting and
trafficking of particular components to the plasma mem-
brane (Schaeren-Wiemers et al., 2004).
Discussion
A previous study on PNS development revealed that
MAL overexpression led to a delayed onset of myelin-
ation, hypomyelinated fibers, and reduced Mpz and
p75NTR expression levels in newborn mice (Buser et al.,
2009b). We postulated that MAL plays a critical role in
PNS myelin formation, probably by influencing the traf-
ficking of particular membrane components important
for axon-glia interaction and downstream signaling
during the process of myelin initiation. From that
study, we concluded that MAL dosage influences Mpz
and p75NTR expression levels in the PNS and maybe by
that the progress of myelination. This is unexpected
because MAL is considered to be a regulator of raft-
dependent protein transport processes but not a regulator
of gene expression. However, our data point to a cascade
of events that ultimately leads to reduced expression
levels of the major myelin protein Mpz and the p75NTR
16 ASN Neuro
receptor and to delayed myelination in MAL-overexpres-
sing mice. In this study, the consequence of MAL over-
expression was investigated in primary mouse Schwann
cell cultures. We analyzed its effect on the transcriptional
level as well as its influence on major signaling pathways
known to be important for Schwann cell differentiation
and myelination. Significantly reduced mRNA expression
levels were detected for Mpz and p75NTR in cultured
MAL-overexpressing Schwann cells, validating the
in vivo observation. Reduced expression of Mpz and
p75NTR was already evident before Schwann cell differen-
tiation, implicating that the effect of MAL overexpression
affects early processes in Schwann cell development.
Herein this study, we further demonstrated that primary
mouse Schwann cells overexpressing MAL can activate
the CREB signaling pathway upon treatment with for-
skolin, indicated by a comparable induction of Mpz
expression as observed in wild-type cells. We also
showed that the delayed onset of myelination in vivo is
not due to impaired phosphorylation of Akt, suggesting
that the PI3-kinase pathway is functional. In line, phos-
phorylation of Akt was induced in MAL-overexpressing
Schwann cell cultures in a comparable degree as in wild-
type cells. Differential expression analysis of genes impli-
cated to be regulated upon activation of the Raf-kinase
(Napoli et al., 2012) revealed no transcriptional alter-
ations in MAL-overexpressing Schwann cells, also
demonstrating that the ERK pathway seems not to be
affected by MAL overexpression (Supplementary
Table 4).

Schmid et al. 17
of Mpz and p75NTR expression in MAL-overexpressing
Schwann cells cannot be explained by the minor tran-
scriptional effects of known genes in Schwann cells. For
this reason, a whole genome microarray was performed,
and a set of genes implicated in the regulation of the
cytoskeleton was identified to be differentially regulated
by MAL overexpression [Supplementary Figure 4(a)].
One differentially expressed gene transcript was S100a4,
a member of the EF-hand family of calcium-binding pro-
tein. In general, S100a4 inhibits the assembly of nonmus-
cle myosin II monomers into filaments and promotes the
disassembly of myosin II filaments, implicated in
remodeling the actin cytoskeleton [Li et al., 2003,
reviewed in Vicente-Manzanares et al., 2009;
Supplementary Figure 4(b)]. In Schwann cells, myosin
II was shown to be necessary for peripheral myelination,
indicated by reduced number of myelin segments,
reduced expression of myelin proteins, as well as impaired
basal lamina assembly shown by RNA interference in
myelinating cocultures (Wang et al., 2008). Our study
revealed that MAL overexpression led to increased
mRNA and protein levels of S100a4 both in vitro and
in vivo throughout development and in the adult.
Increased S100a4 expression in MAL-overexpressing
Schwann cells might therefore increase the disassembly
of myosin II filaments, thereby influencing actin filament
stability. Further, immunofluorescent colocalization ana-
lysis in peripheral nerves identified S100a4 to be
expressed predominantely in nonmyelinating Schwann
cells. This observation suggests that the strongly S100a4
positive Schwann cells in vitro belong to the nonmyelinat-
ing Schwann cell lineage.
Another gene associated with cytoskeleton organiza-
tion is the intermediate filament keratin 23 (Krt23), a
member of the type I cytokeratin family (Zhang et al.,
2001). The expression of Krt23 mRNA was strongly
reduced upon MAL overexpression both in vitro and
in vivo. Immunofluorescent microscopy of adult periph-
eral nerves revealed its protein localization in myelinating
as well as in nonmyelinating Schwann cells. For Krt18,
an interaction partner of Krt23 (Liffers et al., 2011), kera-
tin monomers were shown to appear at the cell periphery
close to the plasma membrane, and to be transported
along actin fibers, allowing intermediate filament network
reorganization [Kolsch et al., 2009; Supplementary
Figure 4(b)]. In Schwann cells, only little is known
about the expression of keratins. Our previous analysis
revealed that Krt23 and Krt10 were substantially
expressed in Schwann cells in vitro, whereas other keratin
transcripts were not detected in primary Schwann cell
cultures (Schmid et al., 2014). Thus, reduced
expression of Krt23 in MAL-overexpressing Schwann
cells might debilitate integration of keratin monomers
into the keratin filament network that is mediated by
actin fibers.
Along these lines, we identified reduced expression of
RhoU/Wrch1 in cultured MAL-overexpressing Schwann
cells and in sciatic nerves of newborn MAL-overexpres-
sing mice. Spatial expression analysis on sciatic nerves
revealed that RhoU is expressed by myelinating but not
by nonmyelinating Schwann cells. RhoU is implicated in
the activation of the JNK signaling pathway and is essen-
tial to maintain F-actin polarization [Ory et al., 2007; Tao
et al., 2001; Supplementary Figure 4(b)]. RhoU overex-
pression results in altered cytoskeletal architecture by dis-
solution of F-actin stress fibers in 3T3 cells (Tao et al.,
2001). In MAL-overexpressing Schwann cells, we further
observed a decreased mRNA expression levels of the
TRAF2 and NCK-interacting kinase (Tnik), belonging
to the germinal center kinase (GCK) family
[Supplementary Figure 4(b)]. Tnik specifically activates
the JNK pathway and induces disruption of F-actin
and by that inhibits cell spreading (Fu et al., 1999).
However, reduced expression could not be observed in
sciatic nerve tissues derived from MAL-overexpressing
mice, suggesting that MAL overexpression does not
have a general impact on the expression of Tnik. Its
expression might be tightly regulated within a particular
stage during Schwann cell development or differentiation.
The observed reduced expression of Tnik and RhoU in
MAL-overexpressing Schwann cells may influence their
potential to induce disassembly of F-actin and by that to
modulate cytoskeleton dynamics important for Schwann
cell membrane mobility. Their functional role in Schwann
cells is not yet known, but they might be novel candidates
involved in modulating early events of Schwann cell dif-
ferentiation, in which JNK and actin are known to play
an important role (Fernandez-Valle et al., 1997;
Parkinson et al., 2004). In line, the reduced expression
of Cnp in MAL-overexpressing Schwann cells may also
point to altered cytoskeletal dynamics. Cnp was shown to
bind to tubulin heterodimers and to influence F-actin and
microtubule reorganization in oligodendrocytes (Lee
et al. 2005). In a previous study, we reported reduced
protein expression of Cnp in membrane preparations of
P5 sciatic nerves of MAL-overexpressing mice (Buser
et al., 2009b). Hitherto, it was unknown whether this
reduced expression is a consequence of the delayed
onset of myelination or whether it is directly linked to
MAL overexpression. Now we can speculate that reduced
Cnp protein levels in vivo are a direct consequence of
MAL overexpression and not of the delayed myelination,
because other myelin-associated genes were not differen-
tially regulated in MAL-overexpressing Schwann cell
cultures.
Besides microtubules, actin filaments, and intermedi-
ate filaments, a fourth filamentous system is known in
Schwann cells, namely, the family of septins (Buser
et al., 2009a). Septins form higher order filaments by
heteromeric assembly and can interact with components
18 ASN Neuro
of cellular membranes, as well as with actin filaments and
microtubules (reviewed in Saarikangas & Barral, 2011).
In polarized cells, septins are involved in membrane com-
partmentalization and vesicle transport. A whole set of
septins are expressed in Schwann cells throughout devel-
opment and in the adult, and they were localized in particu-
lar cellular compartments (Buser et al., 2009a). MAL was
shown to interact with septin 6, which in turn is associated
with particular septins and actin, probably establishing spe-
cialized scaffolds in distinct myelin compartments [Buser
et al., 2009a; Supplementary Figure 4(c)]. Due to this
direct link between MAL and a component of the cytoskel-
eton, it is tempting to speculate about the modulatory role
of MAL in plasma membrane mobility.
During Schwann cell development and differentiation,
accurate cytoskeleton organization is crucial, and altered
cytoskeletal architecture might influence the onset of
myelination by disturbing radial sorting. Two important
modulators for radial sorting are the Rho family
GTPases Rac1 and Cdc42 (Benninger et al., 2007;
Nodari et al., 2007). Analysis of downstream targets of
the Rac1 and Cdc42 signaling pathways revealed, how-
ever, no altered transcription in MAL-overexpressing
Schwann cells, proposing that these signaling cascades
are also functional in MAL-overexpressing Schwann
cells (Supplementary Table 5).
Besides proper cytoskeleton organization, the correct
assembly of the ECM is also essential for accurate myelin
formation. Indeed, a number of transcripts of genes asso-
ciated with the ECM were differentially regulated
in Schwann cells overexpressing MAL, such as -dystro-
brevin, dystroglycan, and collagen type II 1. In addition
to proper gene expression levels of ECM members, accur-
ate sulfatide levels are required to anchor laminin-1
(a1b1g1) and laminin-2 (a2b1g1) to Schwann cells and
consequently to assemble the basal lamina (Li et al.,
2005; McKee et al., 2007). Interestingly, previous reports
showed that MAL binds sulfatide (Frank et al., 1998;
Saravanan et al., 2004). This finding suggests that
MAL-dependent binding of sulfatide influences func-
tional integration of laminins into the basal lam-
ina, resulting in impaired integrin- and dystroglycan-
mediated signaling and by that effect myelination in
Schwann cells.
MAL Overexpression Altered Expression of Genes
Associated With Palmitate
Bioinformatic analysis of highly significantly reduced
genes in MAL-overexpressing Schwann cells revealed an
enrichment of the term palmitate. Palmitoylation is a
reversible posttranslational modification by covalently
adding the saturated fatty acid palmitate to cysteine resi-
dues via thioester linkages, leading to increased protein
hydrophobicity, and consequently facilitates interaction
with lipid bilayer (reviewed in Linder & Deschenes,
2007). Long-chain saturated-free fatty acids such as
palmitate accumulate in membrane lipid rafts and influ-
ence the lipid environment, which might result in altered
downstream signaling by affecting receptor functions
(reviewed in Simons & Toomre, 2000). In Schwann
cells, palmitoylation is required to translocate p75NTR
protein into cholesterol-rich domains of the plasma mem-
brane, which is crucial for subsequent cleavage by the
g-secretase (Underwood et al., 2008). Further, palmitoy-
lation of Pmp22 and Plp is implicated in the efficient pro-
tein transport to the plasma membrane (Schneider et al.,
2005; Zoltewicz et al., 2012). The protein MAL is an
important component of lipid rafts and is localized in
the trans-Golgi network, where lipid rafts are constituted.
It is tempting to speculate that MAL overexpression
alters the composition of lipid rafts, consequently dis-
turbing the balance of accurate palmitoylated proteins
in particular signaling platforms. Thus, altered palmitoy-
lation might lead to impaired downstream signaling influ-
encing the efficiency of myelination in newborn MAL-
overexpressing mice.
Conclusion
MAL overexpression manifests retarted maturation of
nonmyelinating and myelinating Schwann cells, indicated
by differential expression of the myelin protein Mpz and
the neurotrophin receptor p75NTR (Buser et al., 2009b).
This presented study describes novel genes expressed by
nonmyelinating as well as myelinating Schwann cells,
which are differentially expressed in a MAL-dependent
manner and are implicated in the regulation of cytoskel-
etal organization and plasma membrane mobility.
Summary statement
MAL overexpression leads to reduced expression of Mpz
and p75NTR, despite functional pathways and normal
expression of genes important for Schwann cell differenti-
ation. Particular differentially expressed genes implicated
in cytoskeleton organization were identified, proposing
them as novel candidates influencing myelination.
