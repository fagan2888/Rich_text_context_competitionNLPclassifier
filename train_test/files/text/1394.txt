Introduction
Obesity remains a major public health issue, particularly in terms
of its inequitable distribution and high risk among minority sub-
populations in the United States (1). The most recent national
cross-sectional estimates show no declines in obesity in any US
subpopulation (2). Yet there is a paucity of nationally representa-
tive, longitudinal data capturing the transition from adolescence to
adulthood. Longitudinal data are needed to better understand the
patternsofobesitydevelopmentovertime,thepermanencyofobes-
ity at each age, and the ideal points for intervention. We examine
trends in obesity persistence, incidence, and reversal in adolescents
followed for 12 years from the mid-1990s to 2008 using nation-
ally representative data from the National Longitudinal Study of
Adolescent Health (Add Health).
Methods and Procedures
Survey design
The study population initially consisted of 20,745 adolescents enrolled
in Add Health, a longitudinal, nationally representative, school-based
study of US adolescents in grades 7­12, supplemented with minor-
ity special samples and collected under protocols approved by the
Institutional Review Board of the University of North Carolina-Chapel
Hill.Asampleof80highschoolsand52middleschoolsfromtheUnited
States was selected to ensure this sample is representative of US schools
with respect to region of country, urbanicity, school size, school type,
and ethnicity.
Wave II included 14,438 eligible wave I (1994­1995) adolescents (aged
12­21 years) who would still be enrolled in high school during 1996,
including dropouts, measured between April and August, 1996. In waves
III and IV, all wave I respondents were followed regardless of wave II
participation. Wave III included 15,197 eligible original wave I respond-
ents (aged 17­26 years), measured in April 2001 and between August
2001 and April 2002. Wave IV included 15,608 eligible original wave I
respondents (aged 24­32 years), measured April­June 2007 and between
January 2008 and January 2009. Our final analytic sample included 8,675
respondents with complete measured height and weight data at waves II,
III, and IV (early release data). Those excluded from the sample (preg-
nant females, and individuals lost to follow-up or lacking complete data)
were more likely to be Asian, older and from the lowest parental income
tertile based on wave I data. However, obesity prevalence based on wave
I self-reported weight and height was not statistically different for those
included (10.8%) vs. excluded (10.4%). The survey design and sampling
frame have been described elsewhere (3,4).
Study variables
Height and weight were measured at waves II, III, and IV during in-
home surveys using standardized procedures. Using the recommended

No longitudinal analyses using national data have evaluated the increase in obesity from adolescence into early adulthood.
We examined obesity incidence, persistence, and reversal in a nationally representative cohort of US teens followed into
their early 30s, using measured height and weight data, in individuals enrolled in wave II (1996; 12­21 years), wave III (2001;
17­26 years), and wave IV (2008 early release data; 24­32 years) of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health
(N = 8,675). Obesity was defined as a BMI 95th percentile of the 2000 Centers for Disease Control/National Center for
Health Statistics growth charts or 30kg/m2 for individuals <20 years and 30kg/m2 in individuals 20 years. In 1996, 13.3%
of adolescents were obese. By 2008, obesity prevalence increased to 36.1%, and was highest among non-Hispanic black
females (54.8%). Ninety percent of the obese adolescents remained obese in 2008. While annual obesity incidence did not
decline in the total sample across the two study intervals (2.3% per year 1996­2001 vs. 2.2% per year 2001­2008), rates
among white females declined (2.7 to 1.9% per year) and were highest among non-Hispanic black and Hispanic females
(3.8 and 2.7% per year, 1996­2001 vs. 3.0 and 2.6% per year, 2002­2008, respectively). Obesity prevalence doubled
from adolescence to the early 20s, and doubled again from the early to late 20s or early 30s, with strong tracking from
adolescence into adulthood. This trend is likely to continue owing to high rates of pediatric obesity. Effective preventive and
treatment efforts are critically needed.

definition for comparability from adolescence to adulthood (5),

obesity was defined in individuals <20 years as 95th percentile of the
age- and sex-specific Centers for Disease Control growth reference or
BMI 30kg/m2 and in adults 20 years: BMI 30kg/m2. Respondents
who exceeded scale capacity (wave III: 330 lb; wave IV: 440 lb) were
coded as obese.
A combination of in-home surveys of parents and adolescents provided
race/ethnicity data, which was categorized as Hispanic (Cuban, Puerto
Rican, Central/South American, Mexican, other Hispanic), non-Hispanic
white, non-Hispanic black, or Asian-American (Chinese, Filipino, other
Asian). Age at last birthday was reported.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was carried out using Stata Version 10.0 (6). For inci-
dence and prevalence estimates, we used survey procedures to correct
for multiple stages of cluster sample design and unequal probability
of selection to ensure that our results were nationally representative.
Longitudinal sample weights for waves I­III were used in the analysis,
to provide correction for nonresponse bias over time (7). Data limita-
tions precluded the use of sample weights for wave IV, but the longitudi-
nal sample weights are likely to provide acceptable estimates given that
the analytic sample includes individuals present across all measurement
occasions. Because the time periods between survey waves were not the
same (1996­2001 and 2001­2008), we present overall and annual inci-
dence rates (new cases between survey waves/number of years between
surveys). This approach assumes a constant rate of increase across the
observed time period. We used an F-statistic and t-test to compare
group means of obesity prevalence across the three measurement peri-
ods and incidence across the two time intervals. For race/ethnic differ-
ences within sex and within age, the Bonferroni correction for multiple
comparisons was applied. To explore possible cohort effects, we defined
three age groups based on age at wave I (12­14, 15­16, 17, and older)
and tested age differences where there was overlap (e.g., obesity rates for
individuals aged 19 years at wave II vs. those 19 years at wave III) using
two-sided t-tests.
Results
In 2008, 36.1% of the sample was obese, with variation
across sex and ethnicity (persistent and incident obesity col-
umns, Table 1). The vast majority (90%) of obese adolescents
remained obese into their 30s: 94% of females overall, 95%
of black females, and 88% of males remained obese. Obesity
prevalence was highest in the oldest age groups across all race/
ethnic categories. Less than 10% of individuals who were ini-
tially obese at wave II became nonobese by wave IV.
Obesity prevalence more than doubled from 1996 to 2001
and again from wave 2001 to 2008. Incidence was higher
for females from 1996 to 2001, but not from 2001 to 2008
(Table 2). Annual obesity incidence was highest among black
females. There were no statistically significant differences by
baseline age group across any of the obesity transitions.
In Figure 1, we provide an example of the differences in
blacks vs. whites across baseline age cohort. For females in
each baseline cohort group, we find statistically significant
black­white differences except at wave II in the 18­21-year-
old baseline cohort group (borderline significant P = 0.07).
In contrast, we found no evidence of cohort effects within

race/
ethnicity groups, all three age groups experienced similar
increases in obesity with age.
Discussion
We observed a dramatic increase in obesity prevalence from
adolescence into adulthood (4). Our sample represents a
cohort of >15 million 13­20-year-old students at public and
private schools in the United States, followed over a 12-year
period and shows that an estimated 5.5-million adolescents
are obese by the time they reached their early 30s. With the
trend toward increasing obesity in younger US children (2),
these numbers will likely be higher for the cohorts to come
(8). As longitudinal studies have shown, a substantial amount

of weight is gained during the transition from adolescence
to young adulthood (4,9), with strong tracking from adoles-
cence into adulthood (10­12). The longitudinal and racial/
ethnically diverse Add Health cohort uniquely captures lon-
gitudinal trends in the understudied period from adolescence
in the 1990s to the third decade of life. Using these data, we
find interesting racial differences. Although the ratio of obese
black to white females drops from 1.84 to 1 in 1996 and 1.66
to 1 in 2008, we see persistent disparity in obesity prevalence
by year (1996: 19.3% blacks, 10.5% whites; 2001: 35.9% blacks,
22.5% whites; 2008: 54.8% blacks, 33.1% whites), represent-
ing a prevalence difference of 8.8% at 1996 and 21.7% at 2008
(Tables 1 and 2).
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES) data capture changes in rates by age group using
repeated cross-sections, showing a leveling off of obesity rates
in women (2). The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute
Growth and Health Study followed a multicenter biracial
cohort (N = 2,379) of 9­10-year-old females (1985) over 10
years documenting doubling of obesity prevalence into adult-
hood (blacks: 17.7­36.9%; whites: 7.7­18.0%), with relatively
stable racial differences in prevalence (13). In the biracial
Bogalusa cohort (N = 2,392) of 5­14 year olds (1973­1974)
followed over a mean of 17.1 years, annual BMI increases were
~30­40% higher in black vs. white females (14). Our data show
that black females start off with higher proportion of obesity,
have higher annual incidence rates, but the ratio of obesity
prevalence in black vs. white females reduces over time.
Our longitudinal, nationally representative, and ethnically
diverse data capture the transition from adolescence to middle
adulthood over multiple measurement occasions. We find that
the upward trend in obesity continues into the adult years and
is evident in both males and females and in all major US eth-
nic groups. The public health implications of this upward trend
in obesity prevalence are substantial. This early development,
persistence, and incidence of obesity foreshadows increased
mortality and morbidity (and potentially earlier onset) related
to a variety of chronic diseases later in life (15­17). Although
all groups are affected, black and Hispanic females seem par-
ticularly at risk. Our findings emphasize the critical need for
focus on obesity prevention before adulthood.
