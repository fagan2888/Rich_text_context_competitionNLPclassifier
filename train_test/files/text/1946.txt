Older Adults' Psychological Well-Being

Objectives. Guided by interactional role theory and employing a resilience framework, this study aimed to investigate
whether formal volunteering protects older adults with more role-identity absences in major life domains (partner,
employment, and parental) from poorer psychological well-being.
Methods. We used data from 373 participants, aged 65­74, in the 1995 National Survey of Midlife Development in the
U.S. (MIDUS). Multivariate regression models estimated the effects of major role-identity absences, formal volunteering,
and the interaction between major role-identity absences and volunteering on respondents' negative affect, positive affect,
and purpose in life.
Results. Participants with a greater number of major role-identity absences reported more negative affect, less positive
affect, and less purpose in life. Being a formal volunteer was associated with more positive affect and moderated the
negative effect of having more major role-identity absences on respondents' feelings of purpose in life.
Discussion. Consistent with previous studies, findings indicate that having more role-identity absences constitutes a risk
factor for poorer psychological well-being. Results further demonstrate that being a formal volunteer can protect older
adults with a greater number of major role-identity absences from decreased levels of purpose in life. The findings suggest
that associations between volunteering and psychological well-being might be contingent upon the volunteer's role-
identity status and the dimension of psychological well-being examined.
VOLUNTEERING is an increasingly popular activity
among older adults in the United States. A growing
emphasis on staying active in later years, a widespread cultural
value of volunteering, and rising income and educational levels
among the aged have led to more older adult volunteers over
the last few decades (Chambre, 1993). Much of the current
societal enthusiasm for volunteering in later adulthood focuses
on the mutual benefits of such activity, namely, that older adults
have the availability and ability to assist others and that
volunteering provides older adults with needed constructive
activities and productive roles (e.g., Rouse & Clawson, 1992).
Research on volunteering and well-being suggests that formal
community involvement, indeed, is beneficial for older adults'
well-being. Previous studies have found that volunteering is
associated with better self-health ratings (Morrow-Howell,
Hinterlong, Rozario, & Tang, 2003), increased life satisfaction
(Van Willigen, 2000), decreased mortality (Musick, Herzog, &
House, 1999; Shmotkin, Blumstein, & Modan, 2003), higher
levels of contentment (Jirovec & Hyduk, 1998), as well as lower
levels of functional dependence and depressive symptomatology
(Morrow-Howell et al., 2003). Researchers also have suggested
that volunteering might have differential benefits on well-being
according to subgroup variations within the older adult
population. For example, Musick and colleagues (1999) found
that volunteering has a greater protective effect on mortality for
older adults with lower levels of informal social contact relative
to the effect for older adults with higher levels of informal social
contact. Overall, however, evidence for contingent effects of
volunteering on well-being has been limited and inconsistent
(Morrow-Howell et al., 2003), and few studies have investigated
the extent to which volunteering might be associated with unique
advantages for different dimensions of psychological well-being.
The current study aimed to advance understanding of
volunteering and well-being by focusing on the possibly
contextual and dimension-specific advantages of older adults'
formal volunteer activities. We draw on a large body of
empirical and theoretical work that identifies role-identity
absences in major life domains to be a risk factor for older
adults' well-being; this literature suggests that lacking partner,
employment, and parental role identities--independently and
cumulatively--is adversely associated with older adults' well-
being (Coleman, Antonucci, & Adelmann, 1987; Hong &
Seltzer, 1995; Moen, Dempster-McClain, & Williams, 1992;
Rushing, Ritter, & Burton, 1992; Sieber, 1974; Verbrugge,
1983). Guided by interactional role theory and using a resilience
framework, we conceptualize being a formal volunteer as a role-
identity that might moderate the association between an older
adult's accumulation of major role-identity absences and their
psychological well-being.
Theoretical and Empirical Background
Interactional role theory. --Gerontologists often draw on
role theories in their investigations of volunteering and well-
being (Morrow-Howell et al., 2003). Our study was guided by
interactional role theory--a framework outlined by Styrker and
Statham (1985) that integrates classic symbolic interactionism
and traditional role theory. Interactional role theory posits that
people in society occupy a number of social positions. These
positions are associated with behavioral expectations for the
social actors occupying them, regardless of the actors'
individual personalities, and become roles (Sieber, 1974).
When a person internalizes a positional designation, which is

S258
gained through interactions in role relationships, a role-identity
is formed, and role-identities collectively form one's self
(Burke & Tulley, 1977).
The relation between role-identities and well-being con-
stitutes a classic theme in the social sciences. Durkheim's
(1979) notion of ``anomie,'' or the malaise resulting from
rolelessness and separation from a larger social order, attests to
early ideas about the linkages between roles, identity, and well-
being. Likewise, Turner (1978) considered role enactment to be
a germinal process through which people validate their self and
gain esteem. Thoits (1983) further postulated that roles provide
meaning, guidance, direction, and purpose for individuals'
lives, thereby helping persons to avoid negative mental health
and disorganized behavior. Finally, Bronfenbrenner (1979)
explained that because roles are rooted in both people's micro-
and macro-social worlds, they assert a powerful influence over
how a person acts, is treated, relates to others, thinks, and feels.
Interactional role theory has guided research revealing that
volunteering holds greater psychological and physical health
advantages for older, as opposed to younger, adults (Van
Willigen, 2000). Volunteering might hold more meaning for
older adults, because they are more commonly missing other
major role-identities such as paid employment and marital role
identities. If this were the case, older adults who experience
a greater number of major role-identity absences would derive
greater psychological advantages from volunteering than older
adults who experience fewer major role-identity absences.
Major role-identity absences and well-being in later adult-
hood. --Research on marital, parental, and employment status
suggests that an absence in any one of these major roles is
associated with negative psychological outcomes (Gove, Style,
& Hughes, 1991; Kim & Moen, 2002; Marks, Bumpass, & Jun,
2004; Moen, 1996; Prigerson et al., 1995; Stroebe, Stroebe, &
Schut, 2001; Umberson and Gove, 1989). Additionally,
research has demonstrated that having fewer of these three
major role-identities is negatively associated with well-being;
many role-identity absences is a risk factor for poorer mental
health (Coleman et al., 1987; Hong & Seltzer, 1995) and
physical health (Rushing et al., 1992; Verbrugge, 1983). A
number of studies have examined the association between well-
being and role-identity absences by considering the parental,
partner, and employment role-identities together with others,
such as being a volunteer, relative, friend, group member,
neighbor, homemaker, grandparent, and student. Although
occupying multiple roles has the potential to create conflicting
and overwhelming demands for an individual's behavior
(Goode, 1960), overall, studies on multiple roles have indicated
that a larger number of role-identities is associated with better
physical and mental health (Adelmann 1994a, 1994b; Miller,
Moen, & Dempster-McClain, 1991; Pietromonaco, Manis, &
Frohardt-Lane, 1986; Thoits, 1986).
Although research has addressed the cumulative effects of
role-identities on well-being, little research has investigated the
extent to which nonwork and nonfamily sources of role-
identity, such as volunteering, interact with partner, parental,
and employment role-identity absences (i.e., major role-identity
absences) to influence well-being. Investigating these inter-
actions is important for creating a more nuanced understanding
of processes that promote psychological well-being in later
adulthood, especially as individuals spend an increasing
number of adult years in retirement (Kinsella & Velkoff,
2001) and as an increasing number of adults enter later
adulthood without partners and children (Schoen, Urton,
Woodrow, & Baj, 1985).
Applying a resilience model: Volunteering as a protective fac-
tor in the face of risk. --To model and test relationships between
older adults' major role-identity absences, volunteer activities,
and psychological well-being, this study employed a resilience
framework. Although scholars have long disputed definitions of
resilience (for more detailed reviews, see Luthar, Cicchetti, &
Becker, 2000; Rutter, 1990), we conceptualize resilience as
a multidimensional process, which entails both adversity that
places individuals at heightened risk for experiencing negative
outcomes and protective factors that buffer individuals against
these negative consequences of adversity (Rutter, 1990). We
treat multiple types of major role-identity absence as a risk
factor for decreased well-being. Taking into account Moen and
colleagues' (1992) discussion of role context, which focuses on
how the effect of one role on well-being might be influenced by
a combination of other roles, we hypothesize that being a formal
volunteer might serve as a protective mechanism moderating
the risk of having major role-identity absences on three
dimensions of psychological well-being.
Psychological well-being: A multidimensional construct. --
Within the gerontologic literature on volunteering and psycho-
logical well-being, well-being has been investigated most
commonly in terms of life satisfaction (Van Willigen, 2000).
Although gerontologists often characterize volunteer activities
as opportunities for meaning, role enactment, and productivity
(Herzog & House, 1991; Jirovec & Hyduk, 1998), few
researchers have measured well-being in these or related terms.
To address substantive limitations of previous research, this
study focuses on three dimensions of well-being relating to two
different approaches to conceptualizing well-being (Ryan &
Deci, 2001). We include measures of positive and negative
affect to investigate how volunteering is associated with
hedonic conceptions of well-being, which typically approach
well-being as the maximization of life satisfaction and positive
affect and the minimization of negative affect (Kahneman,
Diener, & Schwarz, 1999). We also include a measure of
purpose in life: an indicator that is consistent with eudaimonic
approaches that conceptualize well-being as an individual's
fruitful engagement with life, meaning finding, and experiences
of optimal growth (Keyes, Shmotkin, & Ryff, 2002).
Hypotheses. --Guided by interactional role theory and
a resilience framework as well as the current empirical
literature, we developed a conceptual model (Figure 1),
suggesting that volunteering would moderate the risk of an
increased number of major role-identity absences on psycho-
logical well-being among older adults. We then tested the
following hypotheses:
Hypothesis 1. Older adults who have more role-identity absences
in major life domains (partner, employment, and parental)
will report poorer psychological well-being compared with
older adults who report fewer major role-identity absences.

Hypothesis 2. Older adults who are volunteers will report better
psychological well-being in contrast to older adults who are
not volunteers.
Hypothesis 3. Older adults with a greater number of major role-
identity absences who are volunteers will experience better
psychological well-being in contrast to older adults with more
major role-identity absences who are not volunteers.
METHOD
Data
This study used data from a subsample of National Survey of
Midlife Development in the U.S. (MIDUS) respondents. The
MIDUS national probability sample that answered both
telephone and self-administered surveys includes 3,032
English-speaking, noninstitutionalized adults who were be-
tween the ages of 25 and 74 when interviewed in 1995. The
analytic sample for this study consisted of 373 adults between
the ages of 65 and 74, inclusive.
The MIDUS sample was obtained through random digit
dialing, with an oversampling of older middle-aged respondents
and men made to ensure a good distribution on the cross-
classification of age and gender. Sampling weights correcting for
selection probabilities and nonresponse allow this sample to
match the composition of the U.S. population on age, sex, race,
and education. For this study, multivariate regression models
were estimated with both the unweighted and the weighted data.
No major differences in results were found. Therefore, results
from unweighted analyses are reported, as these analyses provide
estimates that are most efficient; that is, they provide parameters
with minimized standard errors (Winship & Radbill, 1994).
Respondents first participated in a telephone interview
lasting approximately 40 min. The response rate for the
telephone questionnaire was 70%. Respondents to the tele-
phone survey were then asked to complete two self-adminis-
tered mail-back questionnaires. The response rate for the
questionnaire was 86.8% of telephone respondents. Therefore,
the overall response rate for the sample that answered both the
telephone survey and the questionnaire was 60.8%. Non-
respondents to the MIDUS tended to have lower levels of
education and income and to be from nonmajority racial­ethnic
groups. Sampling weights correct for this bias in weighted
analyses, and we control for these factors in unweighted as well
as weighted analyses. (For a detailed technical report regarding
field procedures, response rates, and weighting, see http://
midmac.med.harvard.edu/research.html#tchrpt.)
Measures
Negative and positive affect. --Two six-item scales were
used to measure positive and negative affect (Mroczek &
Kolarz, 1998). To assess negative affect, participants were
asked how frequently in the last 30 days they felt (a) so sad
nothing could cheer them up, (b) nervous, (c) restless or fidgety,
(d) hopeless, (e) that everything was an effort, and (f) worthless.
Similarly, to assess positive affect, participants were asked how
frequently they felt (a) cheerful, (b) in good spirits, (c)
extremely happy, (d) calm and peaceful, (e) satisfied, and (f)
full of life. Respondents answered each of the 12 affect items
by using a 5-point scale (1 ¼ all of the time, 5 ¼ none of the
time). Items were reverse coded and summed so that higher
scores indicated more negative and more positive affect.
Cronbach's alpha was .83 and .88 for the negative affect and
positive affect indexes, respectively.
Purpose in life. --To assess purpose in life, the questionnaire
included a three-item version of Ryff's Purpose in Life Index
(Ryff, 1989; Ryff & Keyes, 1995). For large survey use, Ryff
created this three-item index as an additive measure designed to
represent the conceptual breadth of ``purpose in life,'' which
she found in factor analyzing her 20-item scale. One subfactor,
future orientation, is indicated with the item, ``I live life one day
at a time and don't really think about the future.'' A second
subfactor, related to having a sense of aims and direction, is
indicated with the item, ``Some people wander aimlessly through
life, but I am not one of them.'' A third subfactor, related to
having new goals, is indicated with the item, ``I sometimes feel
as if I've done all there is to do in life.'' For all three items,
respondents were asked to ``indicate how strongly you agree or
disagree'' with the statements on a 6-point continuum (1 ¼
strongly agree, 6¼strongly disagree). Items were reverse coded
and summed so that higher scores indicated more purpose in life.
This additive index is correlated highly (r . .70) with its parent
20-item, highly reliable scale (Ryff & Keyes, 1995).
Major role-identity absences score. --Participants received
a summative score of major role-identity absences by adding
together their number of absent roles in major life domains:
partner (not married), employment (not employed full- or part-
time), and parental (no living biological, adopted, or stepchild,
nor any living child who a respondent had helped to raise for 5
years or more). Higher scores indicated participants who
experienced a greater number of major role-identity absences.
Volunteer status. --A four-part item in the questionnaire
asked participants, ``On average, about how many hours per
month do you spend doing formal volunteer work of any of the
following types: (a) hospital, nursing home, or other healthcare-
oriented volunteer work; (b) school or other youth-related
volunteer work; (c) volunteer work for political organizations
or causes; (d) volunteer work for any other organization, cause,
or charity?'' Respondents who reported volunteering in any
quantity per month for any combination of volunteer

organizations were coded ``1.'' Respondents who reported no
volunteering were coded ``0.''
Control Variables
Previous work has demonstrated that psychological well-
being is associated with age, race, gender, education, income,
and health (Mroczek & Kolarz, 1998; Ryff, 1995). In addition
to being related to the dependent variable, these sociodemo-
graphic variables are also related to the independent variables
of interest: major role-identity absences (Tucker & Mitchel-
Kernan, 1995) and volunteering (Duke, Leventhal, Brownlee,
& Leventhal, 2002; Meadows, 1996). To provide evidence that
major role-identity absences and their interaction with being
a volunteer contribute to psychological well-being independent
of other factors, age, race, gender, income, education, and
functional health limitations were controlled in all analyses.
Respondents' age was assessed as years since birth at the time
of the telephone survey. Participants who identified themselves
as African American were coded ``1'' on a dichotomous variable
for race. Likewise, participants who identified themselves as
female were coded ``1'' on a dichotomous variable for gender.
Participants' income was computed by combining their personal
annual income with that of their spouse. Education was coded on
a 4-point scale, with ``1'' indicating that the participant had
completed some or no years of high school, ``2'' indicating that
the participant had completed high school, ``3'' indicating that the
participant had some years of higher education, and ``4''
indicating that the participant had obtained a 4-year college
degree or more education. Functional health limitations were
assessed with six items asking respondents to indicate the degree
to which their health limits them in carrying groceries, climbing
several flights of stairs, bending, kneeling, or stooping, walking
several blocks, engaging in vigorous activity (e.g., running,
lifting heavy objects), and engaging in moderate activity (e.g.,
bowling, vacuuming; 1¼``a lot,'' 4¼``not at all''). Scores were
reverse coded, and the mean level of response was computed;
higher scores indicated more functional health limitations.
Data Analytic Sequence
Multivariate regression models were estimated to test the
hypothesized associations among psychological well-being
outcomes, major role-identity absences, and volunteer status.
Preliminary analyses examined evidence for gender differences
in the effects of major role-identity absences as well as for
gender differences in the effects of volunteering, on each of the
three outcomes. None of the gender interactions in these models
reached statistical significance (p .05); therefore, it was
deemed appropriate to analyze data from women and men
together.
For final analyses, in the first model, the six control variables
were entered. In the second model, the main independent
variables (major role-identity absences and volunteer status)
were added to evaluate Hypotheses 1 and 2. In the third model,
the interaction term (major role-identity absences 3 volunteer
status) was added to evaluate Hypothesis 3 and to further
evaluate Hypotheses 1 and 2. All three models were estimated
across each of the three dimensions of psychological well-being.
RESULTS
Descriptive Findings
Table 1 presents descriptive information regarding the
prevalence of major role-identity absences. More than three
fifths (61.1%) of the respondents reported having only one
major role-identity absence, and very few (4.0%) reported
having all three. Having a parental role-identity absence was
the least common form of major role-identity absence; 8.1% of
the sample reporting having no living children. About one third
of the respondents (32.6%) experienced a partner role-identity
absence, and 78.3% lacked an employment role-identity. Table
2 provides descriptives for all analytic variables. Thirty-six
percent of participants reported volunteering for a formal
organization at least once per month.
Major Role-Identity Absences and
Psychological Well-Being
To examine initial evidence for our first hypothesis regarding
the linkages between major role-identity absences and psycho-
logical well-being, we estimated a model regressing each
psychological well-being outcome on participants' number of
major role-identity absences and volunteer status (Table 3,
Model 2). Major role-identity absences consistently predicted
participants' poorer psychological well-being, which provided
strong initial support for Hypothesis 1. More major role-
identity absences were associated with more negative affect

(b ¼ .70, p .01), less positive affect (b ¼À.65, p .05), and
less purpose in life (b ¼À.50, p .05).
Volunteering and Psychological Well-Being
To examine initial evidence for our second hypothesis
regarding linkages between volunteering and psychological
well-being, we again focus on Table 3 (Model 2). Results
demonstrated that being a volunteer was a predictor of more
positive affect (b¼ .88, p .05). Volunteer status failed to help
predict respondents' levels of negative affect and purpose in life.
Volunteering as a Protective Factor
To examine evidence for our third hypothesis regarding how
volunteering might moderate the effect of major role-identity
absences on psychological well-being, we estimated Model 3,
which added the major role-identity absences3volunteer status
interaction variable. Results demonstrated a significant
interaction effect for respondents' purpose in life (b ¼ 1.05,
p .05), but not for their positive or negative affect. These
findings suggest that the effect of major role-identity absences
on respondents' feelings of purpose in life is contingent upon
whether or not they volunteer.
To better interpret this interaction, we calculated predicted
scores for purpose in life for volunteers and nonvolunteers
across the two end-points of the continuum for major role-
identity absences (i.e., no major role-identity absences and all
three major role-identity absences). As Figure 2 demonstrates,
for nonvolunteers, an increase from zero to three major role-
identity absences lowered respondents' predicted purpose in
life by about 1 SD. However, for volunteers, a greater number
of role-identity absences was not associated with a substantial
change in levels of purpose in life. These patterns suggest that
volunteering beneficially moderates the relationship between
respondents' major role-identity absences and feelings of
purpose in life, providing support for Hypothesis 3.
DISCUSSION
The findings of this study contribute to our understanding of
linkages among role identities in major life domains, formal
volunteering, and multiple dimensions of psychological well-
being in later life. First, consistent with previous studies on
roles and well-being in later adulthood (Coleman et al., 1987;
Hong & Seltzer, 1995), findings indicate that having major
role-identity absences constitutes a strong risk factor for older
adults' poorer psychological well-being. When compared with
respondents with fewer major role-identity absences, older
adults with more role-identity absences in major life domains
reported lower levels of psychological well-being across all
three dimensions examined in this study.
Second, results from this study contribute to recent geronto-
logic interest in the need to investigate differential advantages of
volunteering, depending on the diverse contexts of older adults'
volunteer activities (Morrow-Howell et al., 2003; Musick et al.,
1999; Van Willigen, 2003). This study highlights one way in
which role context might influence the relationship between
volunteering and well-being. Specifically, results suggest that
volunteering serves as a protective factor against the psycho-
logical well-being disadvantage of reduced sense of purpose in
life that accompanies a greater number of major role-identity
absences. Consistent with interactional role theory, which posits
that social roles contribute to one's self through the creation of

role-identities (Stryker & Statham 1985), the results suggest that
formal volunteering provides a role-identity from which older
adults can derive psychological advantages. The likelihood that
major role-identities are associated with increased social contact
also makes our results congruent with the findings of Musick and
colleagues (1999) that volunteering has a greater protective
effect on mortality for socially isolated older adults than for
those who are socially integrated.
It is noteworthy that the resilience model was not
consistently supported across all three dimensions of psycho-
logical well-being examined. Results suggest that volunteering
might not protect participants from the increased negative affect
and the decreased positive affect that accompanies a greater
number of major role-identity absences in young old age, but
volunteering provides a mechanism through which older adults
with more role-identity absences in major life domains can
maintain goals, aims, and direction (i.e., purpose in life). We
contend that the inconsistency in these results is substantively
coherent. Because eudaimonic approaches to well-being--
which include purpose in life--address participants' active
engagement with life and because marriage, work, children, and
volunteering are primary channels through which people gain
a sense of engagement, it is plausible that the proposed
resilience model was confirmed for purpose in life, but not for
positive or negative affect. Similarly, we interpret the pattern of
main, independent effects on hedonic dimensions of well-being
(i.e., negative and positive affect) as substantively coherent. A
strong U.S. ideology of volunteering as a ``feel good'' activity
for people of all ages might explain why volunteering is
associated with positive affect, but not negative affect.
Volunteering might not prevent us from feeling dysphoric, but
it might help us to feel cheerful and happy in later adulthood.
Overall, results from this study are congruent with geronto-
logic theorizing about social roles and might further illuminate
why volunteering has been found to have greater psychological
significance in the lives of older adults than younger adults (Van
Willigen, 2000). Evidence for the buffering effect of volunteer-
ing on purpose in life supports theories that posit that social role
identities are an important source of meaning for adults (Thoits,
1983). Accordingly, volunteering might provide older adults,
who are likely lacking other major sources of role-identity, an
opportunity for developing more meaning and experiencing
more purpose in their lives. Younger adults might not derive as
strong a well-being advantage from volunteering because they
typically do not experience as many major role-identity
absences as older adults do.
In addition to helping to identify role contexts in which
volunteering holds greatest well-being advantages for partici-
pants, this study also demonstrates the importance of specifying
and examining exactly which dimensions of psychological well-
being are most likely to be influenced by volunteering. Patterned
differences in results from this study suggest that, depending
upon the conceptualization and dimensional measure of
psychological well-being used, analyses might or might not
detect linkages between volunteering and well-being. Perhaps
this fact can account for some of the inconsistencies in previous
findings regarding older adults' volunteer activities and well-
being (see Jirovec & Hyduk, 1998, for a review). Findings from
this study further support the idea that psychological well-being
is a multidimensional construct (Keyes et al., 2002) and underline
the importance of continuing to do research grounded in varied
conceptualizations of psychological well-being.
It is important to note that the conclusions drawn from this
study must be considered with caution. Owing to its cross-
sectional methodologic design, the direction of causality
between volunteering and psychological well-being cannot be
established with certainty. For example, having more positive
affect might lead some older adults to engage in volunteering,
rather than their greater positive affect being a result of
volunteer activities. Studies employing longitudinal designs are
needed to investigate more conclusively the causal associations
between major role-identity absences, volunteering, and
psychological well-being. Also, this study does not investigate
whether informal volunteering (e.g., helping a neighbor) serves
as a protective factor for older adults' well-being, nor does it
specify the possibly varied advantages of different forms and
levels of formal volunteering. Additionally, the study's sample
was limited to young-old adults, aged 65­74. Patterns and
processes might differ for adults age 75 and older.
Nonetheless, the results of this study contribute additional
empirical support for the psychological benefits of increasing
opportunities for older adults' volunteer activities. Findings
suggest, however, that volunteering is not a universal panacea
influencing all dimensions of psychological well-being, nor is it
associated with the same degree of psychological benefit for all
older adults. Further research is needed to address the limitations
of this study, to identify other factors that might serve as
protective mechanisms for older adults' psychological well-
being when major role-identity absences put them at risk, as well
as to develop a more precise understanding of when volunteering
is most strongly associated with enhanced psychological well-
being. Continuing to investigate these processes will provide
researchers and practitioners with a more comprehensive and
useful understanding of how optimal mental health might be
achieved and maintained through the entirety of adulthood.
