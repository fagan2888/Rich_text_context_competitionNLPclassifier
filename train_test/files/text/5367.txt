Introduction
Intimate partner violence (IPV) comprises, "any behaviour
within an intimate relationship that causes physical, sexual
or psychological harm, including acts of physical aggression,
sexual coercion, psychological abuse and controlling behav-
iours" (Heise & Garcia-Moreno, 2002, p. 89). It has been
recognized as a major medical, psychological, social, and
public health problem (Banyard & Cross, 2008; Exner-
Cortens, Eckenrode, & Rothman, 2013; Silverman, Gupta,
Decker, Kapur, & Raj, 2007; World Health Organization
[WHO], 2002). Findings from the WHO multi-country study
on women's health and domestic violence revealed that
about 15% to 71% of women aged 15 to 49 years had expe-
rienced physical and/or sexual violence by an intimate part-
ner at least once in their lifetime (Garcia-Moreno, Jansen,
Ellsberg, Heise, & Watts, 2006). A review of data from
Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) conducted in 10
countries also revealed that the lifetime prevalence of physi-
cal or sexual violence among currently married or cohabiting
women aged 20 to 44 years ranged from 16% to 75% (Hindin,
Kishor, & Ansara, 2008). Findings from some studies con-
ducted in Nigeria similarly indicate that IPV is common
among women. For example, Mapayi, Makanjuola, Fatusi,
and Afolabi (2011) reported that about 37.0% of women
aged 18 to 37 years attending the antenatal clinic and welfare
units of a primary health center in Ile-Ife, South-West
Nigeria, had experienced IPV in the 12-month period pre-
ceding their survey (Mapayi et al., 2011). Balogun, Owoaje,
and Fawole (2012) reported a lifetime IPV prevalence of up
to 70% among women aged 15 to 49 years in South-Western
Nigeria. The discrepancies in prevalence rates across studies
have been attributed to factors such as differences in method-
ology, definitions of violence, study population as well as
willingness of study participants to disclose this information
especially if privacy is not ascertained during the data collec-
tion process (Krug, Mercy, Dahlberg, & Zwi, 2002).
Generally also, reporting of IPV is still a problem in many
countries (Krug et al., 2002).
IPV can take many forms such as physical violence, sex-
ual abuse, and psychological abuse (Heise & Garcia-Moreno,
2002; Watts & Zimmerman, 2002). A number of problems

Abstract
This study was conducted to determine the prevalence and predictors of intimate partner violence (IPV) among female
youth in an urban low-income neighborhood in Ibadan, Nigeria. Data for 298 female youth (15-24 years) were analyzed. The
respondents' mean age was 20.8 ± 2.2 years and 21% had suffered IPV within 12 months of the study. Predictors of 12-month
IPV were circumstances surrounding sexual debut: coerced (odds ratio [OR] = 4.18; confidence interval [CI] = [1.49, 11.75])
or forced (OR = 4.76; CI = [1.67, 13.59]) compared with consensual sex, history of partner involvement in fights (OR = 2.78;
CI = [1.02, 7.54]), and history of partners' father beating mother (OR = 41.82; CI = [5.03, 347.80]). IPV is common among
female youth in Idikan community and interventions need to target these youth and their partners.

have been associated with IPV and these include physical
injuries (Antai, 2011; Esere, Idowu, Durosaro, & Omotosho,
2009), substance use problems (Decker et al., 2014; Exner-
Cortens et al., 2013), and sexual and reproductive health
problems such as unintended pregnancy, nonuse of condoms,
sexually transmitted diseases including HIV/AIDS (Decker
et al., 2014; Hindin et al., 2008; Silverman et al., 2007), and
adverse pregnancy outcome (Silverman et al., 2007).
Violence within an intimate relationship is not restricted
to adults but is similarly pervasive among young people
(Bruce, 2011; Stöckl, March, Pallitto, & Garcia-Moreno,
2014). Although, males also experience violence from their
intimate partners, females are more likely to be victims and
to suffer from the attendant effects of IPV (Gass, Stein,
Williams, & Seedat, 2011; Heise & Garcia-Moreno, 2002;
Krug et al., 2002). A number of studies have also docu-
mented that young age is associated with being a victim of
IPV (Abramsky et al., 2011; Heise & Garcia-Moreno, 2002;
Mapayi et al., 2011). Findings from studies among young
females have documented IPV rates as high as 66%. For
example, Stöckl et al. (2014), in their analysis of IPV
among adolescents and young women aged 15 to 24 years
in nine countries, found a lifetime prevalence of IPV that
ranged from 19% to 66%. Decker et al. (2014), in a study
among adolescents residing in vulnerable urban communi-
ties in five global cities, revealed that among ever-partnered
women, past-year IPV prevalence ranged from 10.2% to
36.6%. Young females who experience IPV are exposed to
similar consequences as older adult women; however, an
additional challenge for them is the fact that experiencing
IPV during this stage in their development is an established
risk factor for violence within future intimate relationships
(Bruce, 2011). Exner-Cortens et al. (2013), in their study on
the "longitudinal associations between teen dating violence
victimization and adverse health outcomes," demonstrated
that teenage respondents who experienced teen dating vio-
lence had a higher incidence of various adverse health out-
comes such as substance abuse, suicidal ideation, and IPV
victimization. These highlight the immediate and long-term
negative consequences of IPV on young females. In addi-
tion, young females residing in low-income settings within
cities are at increased risk of violence and several other
negative health outcomes (United Nations Children's Fund,
2012).
The Ecological Model for Understanding IPV
This article utilized the ecological model to explore the fac-
tors that predispose female youth, that is, females aged 15 to
24 years (United Nations Department of Economic and
Social Affairs [UNDESA]) to IPV victimization. According
to the WHO World Report on violence and health, the eco-
logical model "explores the relationship between individual
and contextual factors and considers violence as the product
of multiple levels of influence on behavior" (Krug et al.,
2002). The ecological model has been utilized by various
researchers to explain the factors influencing violence which
operate at individual, relationship, community, and societal
levels (Figure 1; Krug et al., 2002).
Individual factors are personal factors within the indi-
vidual that increase the likelihood of being a victim or a
perpetrator of violence. Examples of these include female
gender, age, low level of education, substance abuse, previ-
ous experience to violence, and so on. Female youth resid-
ing within low-income communities are more likely to have
low levels of education, be unemployed or engaged in
menial jobs, and have a history of witnessing parental vio-
lence compared with their counterparts residing in higher
income communities (Krug et al., 2002; Stöckl et al., 2014).
Within the ecological model, relationship-level factors are
those which involve close social interactions between the
individual and people in his or her family or immediate
environment and the influence of these relationships on
violence perpetration or victimization. Relationship-level
factors predisposing female youth in low-income commu-
nities to IPV include discord within their intimate relation-
ships, being in relationships with men who have lower
levels of education, are unemployed, have multiple part-
ners, exhibit controlling behavior, use substances, and who
experienced violence when growing up (Krug et al., 2002;
Uthman, Lawoko, & Moradi, 2010). Community-level fac-
tors refer to the community contexts, for example, neigh-
borhoods, workplaces, and schools within which social
relationships are domiciled. Within the community, factors
such as low levels of education among the community
members, high levels of poverty and unemployment, and
low socioeconomic status of women influence the rates of
IPV (Heise & Garcia-Moreno, 2002; United Nations
Children's Fund, 2012). The societal level includes factors
within the society at large such as institutional, community,
and public policies and laws that regulate or support healthy
actions and practices. Other societal-level factors promot-
ing IPV within low-income communities include weak
legal sanctions against IPV, sociocultural values and norms
that view IPV as acceptable, and norms that associate man-
hood with dominance and aggression (Heise & Garcia-
Moreno, 2002; Krug et al., 2002; McLeroy, Bibeau,
Steckler, & Glanz, 1988; U.S. Department of Health and
Figure 1. Ecological model for understanding violence.

Onanubi et al. 3
Human Services, 2005). The ecological model when
applied to violence is also useful in the development of
interventions that target key actors or institutions at the dif-
ferent levels of influence.
In spite of the fact that young females are at higher risk for
IPV compared with their older counterparts, there is a pau-
city of published research on IPV among them (Russell et al.,
2014) especially in developing countries like Nigeria.
Furthermore, available studies among this vulnerable cate-
gory of women are usually school-based (Russell et al.,
2014; Swart, Seedat, Stevens, & Ricardo, 2002) and/or
health-facility based (Mapayi et al., 2011). These would miss
out on a significant proportion of females residing in these
poor communities, because many of them already have lim-
ited access to amenities such as education and health care
(United Nations Children's Fund, 2012). The focus of this
article was therefore to determine the prevalence and predic-
tors of IPV among female youth aged 15 to 24 years residing
in Idikan community, a densely populated, low-income
urban community in Ibadan North-West Local Government
Area (LGA), Oyo state, Nigeria. Our findings would add to
the existing body of knowledge on IPV among female youth
in developing countries like Nigeria and also provide data
required to develop interventions targeting this category of
females. Data for this article were from a larger cross-sec-
tional study on IPV among women of reproductive age in
married/current relationships residing in a low-income com-
munity (Idikan) in southwestern Nigeria.
Method
This was a cross-sectional community-based study and we
analyzed data for young women aged 15 to 24 years residing
in Idikan community, Oyo state, Nigeria.
Study Area
Idikan community is an inner core community in Ibadan
North­West LGA, Oyo state, Nigeria (Lawoyin et al., 2004).
It is a densely populated area comprising mainly of people of
Yoruba ethnicity. Most families are polygamous with large
family sizes comprising grandfathers, uncles and aunts, and
grandchildren residing in smaller apartments or rooms all
located within the family compound (also called "agbole").
There are established health facilities within the community
providing primary care and referral services (Osamor &
Owumi, 2010).
Study Participants
The study participants comprised female youth (aged 15-24
years) in current relationships. The definition of youth used
in this article is in line with the United Nations's definition
which specifies that a youth is an individual aged 15 to 24
years of age (UNDESA).
Sampling Technique
Respondents were selected using a cluster sampling tech-
nique. The Idikan community is located within the inner core
of the Ibadan North-West LGA. The community is composed
of smaller units--compounds--and within each compound
are two or more houses. Two or more extended families
reside in each house. A major road runs through the commu-
nity and divides it into two approximately equal and largely
homogeneous neighborhoods. For this study, one half of the
community was selected by balloting. All the houses within
the selected neighborhood were visited and every eligible
woman residing in these houses who provided informed con-
sent was interviewed (Owoaje & OlaOlorun, 2012).
Instrument and Data Collection
Data were collected over a period of 4 months. The informa-
tion was obtained from the respondents using questions from
the WHO Multi-Country Study on Women's Health and Life
Events questionnaire (version 9.9) used for the WHO Multi-
Country Study on Women's Health and Domestic Violence
(WHO, 2000, 2005). The data collection procedures were
further informed by the safety recommendations for con-
ducting research in domestic violence outlined in the WHO
manual: "WHO Multicountry Study on Women's Health and
Domestic Violence Against Women" (WHO, 2005) and in
the WHO and PATHS manual on "Researching Violence
Against Women: A Practical Guide for Researchers and
Activists" (Ellsberg & Heise, 2005). The Department of
Community Medicine runs a community clinic within the
Idikan community and the clinic home visitors assisted the
research team with community entry and navigating within
the community. On arrival in the family compound, the
research staff introduced themselves to the household head
or other adult in the household, and explained that the study
was about women's health issues. As suggested in the WHO
guidelines, the research staff did not mention that questions
on violence would be asked. Within each household, all
women aged 15 to 45 years who were married or had been in
an intimate relationship were approached to participate in the
study. Each eligible respondent suggested a convenient and
private location within the household/family compound
where the questionnaires could be administered without
interruption by her partner/husband or other family mem-
bers. This was often on the porch, in the sitting room, or on
the corridor or in a section within the family compound were
the respondent could be free to answer the questions. The
interviewers had been trained to change the topic or discon-
tinue the interview if other people came into the room,
approached the section of the home environment where the
interview was being conducted, or if they had a sense that the
respondent's privacy might be breached. A few women
requested to have the interviews in their workplaces which
were not very far from their homes for better privacy.

Information obtained included respondents' sociodemo-
graphic characteristics, sexual history, experience of vio-
lence as a child, and history of physical and sexual violence
experienced within 12 months of the study. Information on
selected partner characteristics was also obtained. The
response rate for the larger study among the 15- to 45-year-
old married or ever-partnered women was approximately
98.6%. The current article is based on information obtained
from the female youth aged 15 to 24 years.
Measures
Outcome variable
Experience of IPV victimization within 12 months of the
study.Experience of at least one form of violence (physi-
cal or sexual) from an intimate partner at least once in the
12-month preceding the study.
Information on physical IPV victimization was obtained
by asking respondents if their current husband/partner or any
other partner had done any of the following to them within
12 months prior to the study: slapped or thrown something at
respondent that could hurt the respondent; pushed or shoved
respondent or pulled respondent's hair; hit respondent with
fist or something else that could hurt her; kicked, dragged, or
beaten respondent up; choked or burned respondent on pur-
pose; or threatened to use or actually used a gun, knife, or
weapon against respondent.
For sexual IPV, respondents were asked if their current
husband/partner or any other partner had ever done any of
the following to them within 12 months prior to the study:
physically forced respondent to have sexual intercourse
when she did not want to, or forced respondent to do some-
thing sexual that they found degrading/humiliating.
Respondents were also asked if they had sexual intercourse
when they did not want to with their current husband/partner
or any other partner because they were afraid of what he
might do.
Explanatory/independent variables. Our choice of explanatory
variables was guided by the ecological model and informa-
tion from previous literature which had identified some fac-
tors associated with IPV among women (Abramsky et al.,
2011; WHO, 2002). Variables were limited to selected fac-
tors at the individual and relationship levels of the ecological
model. Individual-level factors studied were as follows:
1. Sociodemographic characteristics: respondent's age,
current relationship status (i.e., if respondent was
currently married or in an intimate relationship),
highest level of education, and occupation;
2. Sexual history: age at first sexual intercourse, num-
ber of sexual partners ever had, circumstances sur-
rounding first sexual intercourse (consensual or
forced);
3. History of violence: experience/witness of childhood
violence by respondent;
4. Experience of violence by the respondent's mother.
Relationship-level factors: These were limited to selected
partner characteristics and included the following:
1. Partners' sociodemographic characteristics such as
age, education, employment status, type of work;
2. Relationship of partner to respondent (spouse or
partner);
3. Type of marriage (monogamous or polygamous
marriage);
4. History of partner witnessing violence as a child
(whether or not his father used to beat up his mother);
5. History of partner being involved in physical fights;
and
6. Use of alcohol by intimate partner
Analysis
Data were analyzed using SPSS version 20.0 software. The
associations between the outcome variable (IPV in the last
12 months) and the selected characteristics were first
explored using bivariate analysis (chi-square test). Following
the bivariate analysis, individual and partner variables that
were associated with experience of IPV within 12 months of
the study at p < .1 were entered into the multiple logistic
regression model (using a stepwise approach) to determine
factors predicting IPV among the female youth.
Ethical approval for the study was obtained from the Oyo
State Ministry of Health Ethical Review Committee. The
trained research staff obtained verbal informed consent from
all respondents and they were informed that they were free to
refuse to participate and would not suffer any consequences
if they chose not to participate. The research staff adminis-
tered the questionnaires to the respondents, and confidential-
ity was maintained.
Results
Respondents' Characteristics
A total of 298 female youth with a mean age of 20.8 ± 2.2
years were interviewed. More than two thirds of them,
(68.1%) were currently married, 73.8% were Muslims,
66.4% had at most primary education, and 70.5% were cur-
rently working (Table 1). More than three quarters (76.2%)
of the females had sexual debut when they were aged 15 to
19 years, 87.9% had ever had at most one to two sexual part-
ners;78.2% stated that their first sexual intercourse was con-
sensual while, 9.7% said it was forced (Table 1). Twenty-nine
(9.7%) reported that their mothers had been victims of part-
ner violence.

Partner Characteristics
Information on the characteristics of the respondents' part-
ners is presented in Table 2. The mean age of the respon-
dents' partners was 26.5 ± 4.8 years, ranging from 16 to 50
years. Approximately 60% had at most secondary education
and 267 (89.6%) were employed at the time of the survey.
About two thirds, 106 (66.7%), of the female youth stated
that their current partner was in an intimate relationship with
another woman/women. Forty-seven (15.9%) women stated
that their partners were currently using alcohol or other psy-
choactive substances, and 8.8% were frequently involved in
physical fights.As many as 71.8% were aware that their part-
ners' fathers used to beat up their mothers.
Prevalence of IPV Among the Female Youth
Sixty-two (20.8%) of the female youth had experienced at
least an episode of physical and/or sexual IPV in the 12
months preceding the survey; of these, 43 females had been
victims of physical violence while 27 were victims of sexual
violence. Of those who experienced physical violence, 43
(100%) were slapped or had something thrown at them, 18
(41.9%) were kicked/dragged/beaten up, and 17 (39.5%)
were hit with a fist or something that could hurt. Twenty-four
(88.9%) victims of sexual violence had sexual intercourse

Factors Associated With Experience of IPV in the
Last 12 Months
Individual factors associated with experience of IPV in the last 12
months. About a quarter of the female youth who had their
first sexual intercourse when they were aged 15 to 19 years
had experienced IPV compared with their counterparts who
had their first sexual intercourse when they were aged 11 to
14 years (6.5%) or 20 to 24 years old (15.0%). Circumstances
surrounding sexual debut was significantly associated with
IPV victimization as 37.9% of respondents who reported that
their first sexual experience was forced had experienced IPV
in the 12 months preceding the survey compared with 27.8%
who said their first sexual intercourse was coerced and 17.6%
who said their first sex was consensual (p = .021; Table 4).
Partner-related factors associated with experience of IPV in the
last 12 months. Findings on the association between partner
characteristics and experience of IPV in the last 12 months
are presented in Table 5. A higher proportion of female youth
whose partners were engaged in unskilled/manual employ-
ment (29.5%) and in semiskilled employment (16.4%) had
experienced IPV in the last 12 months (p = .031). None of the
two female youth whose partners were in professional occu-
pations had experienced IPV. A significantly higher propor-
tion of female youth (25.7%) who reported that their partners'
fathers beat their mothers experienced IPV compared with
those whose partners'fathers never beat their mothers (8.3%;
p = .001). Approximately 35% of female youth whose part-
ners had been involved in a physical fight compared with
those whose partners had never been involved in a fight
(19.6%) had experienced IPV (p = .081).
Predictors of IPV in the last 12 months
Individual-level factors predicting IPV victimization in the
last 12 months were age at first experience of sexual inter-
course and circumstances surrounding sexual debut (i.e.,
whether first sexual intercourse was consensual, coerced, or
forced) Table 6. Respondents who had their first sexual expe-
rience when they were aged 15 to 19 years had a significantly
higher odds of IPV victimization compared with those aged
11 to 14 years (odds ratio [OR] = 8.19, confidence interval
[CI] = [1.62, 41.43], p = .011). Respondents whose first
experience of sexual intercourse was nonconsensual (coerced
or forced) were greater than 4 times more likely to have
experienced IPV compared with those whose first sexual
experience was consensual.
Partner factors that were significant predictors of IPV vic-
timization in the last 12 months were partners' involvement
in a physical fight and history of partner's father beating his
mother. Respondents who reported that their partners had
been involved in physical fights were greater than 2.5 times
more likely to have experienced IPV than their counterparts
whose partners had not been involved in physical fights (OR
= 2.78; CI = [1.02, 7.54], p = .045). Furthermore, respon-
dents who stated that partners' fathers used to beat their
mothers were also more likely to have experienced IPV in
the last 12 months compared with their counterparts whose
partners' fathers did not beat up their mothers (OR = 41.82;
CI = [5.03, 347.80], p = .001).
Discussion
This study assessed the prevalence and predictors of IPV
among female youth from a low-income urban community.
Prevalence of IPV
Our findings revealed that many female youth in the study
area were experiencing IPVas more than a fifth (21%) reported
12-month experience of IPV. This is comparable with findings
from some other studies; for instance, O'Donnell, Agronick,
Duran, Myint-U, & Stueve (2009) reported a 12-month preva-
lence of IPV of 29% among economically disadvantaged
young adult women aged 22 to 25 years in New York. Some
other researchers have reported higher prevalence rates of IPV
among young females; for instance, Russell et al. (2014)
reported a 3-month prevalence of 39% among in-school girls
in the eighth grade in Cape town, South Africa. On the whole,
our findings confirm the wide range in IPV prevalence often
reported within and between countries. This wide variation
was also highlighted in the WHO multi-country study on IPV
among adolescents and young women aged 15 to 24 years
which reported a lifetime prevalence of IPV that ranged from
19% to 66% (Stöckl et al., 2014).
In the current study, we found 12-month prevalence rates
of physical and sexual IPV of 14.4% and 9.1%, respectively.
Onanubi et al. 7
These are higher than corresponding values reported by
Umana, Fawole, and Adeoye (2014) who found lifetime
prevalence of physical and sexual IPV of 7.9% and 6.6%,
respectively, among postgraduate students (aged < 20 and 35
years) in Ibadan. Our higher prevalence rates could be
because, compared with the sample studied by Umana et al.,
our respondents were slightly younger overall, had lower
levels of education, and resided in vulnerable communities.
These characteristics (younger age and low levels of educa-
tion) have been identified as factors that confer increased
vulnerability for IPV (WHO, 2002).
Predictors of 12-Month IPV Victimization
Our study revealed a number of individual and partner-related
factors that were associated with 12-month IPV. Individual
factors associated with IPV (after logistic regression analysis)
were (a) age at first sexual intercourse (those who had first
sexual intercourse when they were 15 to 19 years old com-
pared with those aged 11 to 14 years at first sex and (b) cir-
cumstances surrounding sexual debut--Young women who
reported that their first sexual experience was not consensual
or forced were more likely to have experienced IPV. Stöckl

et al. (2014) similarly found that a history of nonconsensual
sexual debut was significantly associated with IPV victimiza-
tion. The incident of forced or unwanted sexual debut might
have occurred within the 12-month period under investiga-
tion and could thus explain this finding. Another possible
explanation could be that the female had remained in this abu-
sive relationship and the violence had continued.
Partner-related factors significantly associated with
12-month IPV were history of partner being involved in a
fight and partner's father beating his mother. Other studies
have similarly reported that women whose partners have a
history of being involved in aggressive behavior including
physical fights were more likely to be victims of IPV.
O'Donnell et al. (2009), in their longitudinal study on IPV
among economically disadvantaged young adult women,
found that those who had a history of aggressive behavior in
their middle school years were likely to perpetrate IPV as
young adults. Female youth in our study who reported that
their partner's father used to beat his mother were more likely
to report a history of IPV than their counterparts who did not
have a similar history. Findings from existing literature have
documented that a positive history of IPV between partner's
parents is an established risk for women to experience vio-
lence from their partners (Hindin et al., 2008). This phenom-
enon has been referred to as "inter-generational cycling of
violence," described as the effect of witnessing violence in
the family as a child (Seedat, Van Niekerk, Jewkes, Suffla, &
Ratele, 2009). Possible reasons which have been adduced for
this include the fact that men who witnessed their fathers
beating up their mothers might have grown up with the
impression that this behavior is part of a relationship/marital
role that gives a man the right to abuse his partner as a means
of correction or discipline (Umana et al., 2014). Hence these
men behave in a similar manner toward their own partners/
spouses. Children who grow up witnessing violence within
the family may also be wrongly socialized to thinking that
this is a normal "disciplinary measure." This finding high-
lights the need to target individuals who report a history of
violence between their parents with appropriate interventions
so that these affected children do not grow up to continue the
cycle of violence within their own homes. In addition, some
cultures in Africa support beating of wives as an "appropriate
disciplinary measure" (Uthman et al., 2010). This fuels IPV;
hence, urgent steps need to be taken to discourage this view.

Conclusion
Our findings confirm that IPV is a problem among female
youth residing in low-income communities. Past experi-
ence of violence was a major factor associated with IPV
among our study population as the female youth who
reported a history of IPV between their own or their part-
ners' parents and a history of their partners being involved
in physical fights were at higher risk of being victims of
IPV victimization. These findings highlight the urgent need
for comprehensive intervention programs to target vulner-
able females as well as men within our study area. It is
important to invest in primary prevention intervention
efforts to prevent IPV among female youth in our study
area. Our findings supported "inter-generational cycling of
violence." We thus recommend that, psychological inter-
ventions that target women and men with a history of IPV
in their parents could be useful in reducing the prevalence
of IPV in our study area.
Limitations
Our study has a few limitations. First, we obtained self-
reported history of IPV, and the prevalence could be lower
than expected as a result of information and recall bias.
Some of the respondents could have withheld information
regarding their personal experiences due to a general culture
of silence regarding IPV in our society. We however tried to
minimize this by encouraging the respondents to be open
about their experiences and emphasizing that the informa-
tion they provided would be useful in advocating for appro-
priate interventions. We made efforts to reduce recall bias
by obtaining information on past-year experience of IPV in
addition to a history of any past experience of IPV. Finally,
our study was cross-sectional in nature; hence, we report on
factors associated with IPV and these do not imply a causal
relationship. However, these factors are consistent with
results from other studies. Our findings thus contribute to
the existing body of knowledge on IPV among female youth
in socially disadvantaged communities and would be useful
in developing interventions to target them.
Implications of Study Findings
Our findings emphasize the need for existing interventions
to reach young females in disadvantaged neighborhoods to
reduce the occurrence of IPV among them. One of the ways
to reach these women could be through routine screening
for violence at any point when they encounter a health
professional.
