Given that diversity has been the core of the Indian cultural fabric, one
often finds a naturally created diverse workforce in Indian organizations.
Therefore, even as several large and small countries in the developed world
have been working on creating diverse and inclusive workplaces over the last
four decades, India Inc. did not feel the acute need to focus on issues of diversity.
However, this also meant that issues around inclusion and exclusion, groupism, and
unconscious discrimination--though real in a diverse work group--were ignored.
Globalization and glocalization have changed the context for businesses all over the
world including India, leading to a shift in discourse among Indian businesses and
discussions about diversity. Being able to recognize and promote the uniqueness of
different groups of a diverse workforce is not only acknowledged as instrumental
in improving performance, but also an imperative that organizations can no longer
choose to ignore. While there has been considerable academic debate on the value of
diversity, it is accepted that diversity adds both tangible and intangible value, even
if it requires working through the issues and costs that sometimes accompany it. For
India Inc., the imperatives for diversity have been akin to those in other countries
and include a need to attract talent to meet the demands of an expanding knowledge
industry sector, creating competent teams for the Indian operations of multinational
companies (MNCs), and the ambition of Indian organizations to go global.

Several studies have looked at the relationship
between the company's workforce demographics
and its bottom line.1,2 In one study of Fortune 500
companies, it was found that the top 25 per cent
of the firms in terms of the presence of women in
senior management, actually yielded returns to their
stockholders that were 30 per cent higher than those
of their peers.3 Gender diversity was associated with
increased sales revenue and customers, and greater
relative profit. In a report by Deloitte, it is argued that
diversity and inclusion lead to improved business
outcomes, and diversity means more than `just having
a sprinkle of women and a dab of color'.4 Using data
from the National Organizations Survey in the United
States, Herring5 found racial diversity to be associated
with increased sales revenue, more number of
customers, greater market share, and greater relative
profits. Thus, diversity can provide many potential
advantages to organizations. On one level, it helps
organizations to reach out to diverse customer groups
and markets, and on another level, by allowing for a
variety of perspectives, it promotes innovativeness
and superior work outcomes and performance.
Not surprisingly, diversity management is an
important agenda in most organizations today and
many even have chief diversity officers, much like
chief operating officers or chief financial officers.
What we see today is the discourse increasingly
shifting to one of inclusion, over and beyond that
of diversity. Increasingly, research is showing that
while explicit goals for diversity may be set, implicit
biases often limit the ability to achieve those goals.6

Also, merely pushing for diversity through, most
popularly, gender, or age, or geographies is not
adequate to reap the benefits of having a diverse work
force. The clincher is, given a diverse workforce, to
promote quality, respect, and trust across multiple
teams and geographies composed of heterogeneous
people in terms of age, gender, sexual preferences,
physical abilities, and national cultures. Diversity
management strategies or approaches have been
criticized for not addressing the exclusion of people
from different identity groups and their limited access
and participation in the organization.7
This colloquium has two objectives. One is to briefly
review the literature and debates on diversity
and inclusion in the academic literature. We hope
to briefly look at what exactly do diversity and
inclusion mean? Are they simply new buzzwords in
the business world representing old wine in a new
bottle, or do they allude to different things? What
influences diversity and inclusion, and what do we
know about research regarding them? What are the
fault lines in managing issues around them? What
role does leadership and organizational climate
play in shaping inclusive organizations? The other
is to include voices from industry, diversity, and
inclusion heads of organizations to share what their
own journey has been towards creating diverse and
inclusive organizations.
DEFINING DIVERSITY8
The term diversity is often used to describe the
composition of work groups. At the most basic level,
diversity is viewed as demographic differences.
Emphasis on diversity focuses on the composition
of work groups around factors, which generally
distinguishes one individual from the other, mostly
in terms of observable demographic characteristics
such as gender, race, ethnicity, or age, or in terms
of non-observable attributes such as education or

socio-economic status.9,10 Diversity has been described11
as `the varied perspectives and approaches to work
that the members of different identity groups bring'.
Hays-Thomas and Bendick12 define it as `the mixture of
attributes within a workforce that in significant ways
affect how people think, feel, and behave at work,
and their acceptance, work performance, satisfaction,
or progress in the organization'. While demographic
diversity may be a visible lead indicator, diversity of
thought is seen as the end game.13
Just as there are different diversity definitions,
there are also a multitude of perspectives that have
been found to exist within organizations vis-à-vis
diversity. Two complimentary typologies of diversity
have been proposed. Dass and Parker14 propose a
continuum of perspectives ranging from diversity as
a threat and diversity as a source of problems such as
discrimination and fairness to diversity as a means to
create opportunities such as access to new markets
and diversity as something that has the potential for
learning (including costs and benefits). Similarly,
examining the effects of diversity on work group
processes, Ely and Thomas15 offered a somewhat similar
typology of organizational approaches to diversity,
the integration-and-learning perspective, the access-
and-legitimacy perspective, and the discrimination-
and-fairness perspective. The discrimination-and-
fairness perspective involves focus on justice and the
fair treatment of all members, as a moral imperative.
The access-and-legitimacy perspective is based on
the recognition that the organization's markets and
constituencies are culturally diverse, and, therefore,
matching the organization's own workforce is a way
of gaining access and legitimacy to those markets.

The integration-and-learning perspective is premised
on the belief that the skills, experiences, and insights
of diverse employees are a potentially valuable
resource for learning and change, and is valued in the
workgroup for the attainment of its goals. It is argued
that the dominant perspective among organizational
members influences the way diversity is handled
within organizations. It is proposed that the integration-
and-learning perspective is what provides sustained
benefits in the long run.
DEFINING INCLUSION
Changes in the discourse about diversity have seen
a shift from debates about affirmative action to focus
more extensively on the notion of inclusion. The
inclusion literature is still under development and there
appears to be limited agreement on the conceptual
underpinnings of the construct.16
Ithasbeenarguedthatifjust10percentmoreemployees
feel included, the company will increase work
attendance by almost one day per year per employee17.
A Catalyst report has found that, in India, employee
perceptions of inclusion account for 43 per cent of
team citizenship behaviour18. According to the Deloitte
report, when employees think that their organization
is committed to and supportive of diversity and they
feel included, they report better business performance
in terms of their ability to innovate, responsiveness
to changing customer needs, and team collaboration.19
They argue that organizations need to rebalance
their focus on inclusion rather than prioritizing only
diversity, to fully unleash the potential of diversity. In
other words, an additional effort is needed to focus on
inclusion, over and beyond diversity.
In one of the early descriptions of inclusion, Miller20
calls it the extent to which individuals are `allowed
to participate and are enabled to contribute fully'.

According to another definition21, inclusion is `the
degree to which an employee is accepted and treated
as an insider by others in a work system'. Considering
it along a continuum, Mor Barak22 notes that `employee
perception of inclusion­exclusion is conceptualized as
a continuum of the degree to which individuals feel
a part of critical organizational processes'. According
to the Mor Barak model, diversity and organizational
culture contribute to perceptions of inclusion­
exclusion, which in turn are related to job satisfaction,
organizational commitment, individual well-being,
and task effectiveness. Emphasizing on the fairness
perspective and the active seeking out of employees in
the process of inclusion, Holvino, Ferdman, and Merrill-
Sands23 define inclusion as `equality, justice, and full
participation at both the group and individual levels, so
that members of different groups not only have equal
access to opportunities, decision-making, and positions
of power, but they are actively sought out because of
their differences'. Towards achieving this, Roberson24
argues that inclusion refers to `the removal of obstacles
to the full participation and contribution of employees
in organizations'. Elsewhere it is defined as `the extent
to which employees believe their organizations engage
in efforts to involve all employees in the mission and
operation of the organization with respect to their
individual talents'.25
The pairing of diversity and inclusion at times leads
to the misunderstanding that these are related and
similar. It is argued that while diversity can be achieved
by hiring different people in the organization, inclusion
is a process that involves change in mindset of all the
people in an organization. Achieving diversity is a
technical and complicated problem, but experiencing

is an outcome and inclusion is a process. At the end

of the day, a diverse organization in all countries and
contexts will have more or less the same look and feel.
An inclusive organization will only be reached through
an emergent contextual involvement of all employees
and thus each inclusive organization will look and feel
very different.
CREATING INCLUSIVE WORKPLACES
In inclusive organizations, non-traditional employees
are not expected to merely assimilate to dominant
norms.26 The concept of a climate of inclusion27 has
been discussed as the one where identity group
status is unrelated to access to key resources, creating
opportunities for heterogeneous individuals to have
ties that are cross-cutting.
One of the ways that organizations and leaders
contribute to being less inclusive is by pretending that
organizations are gender, racially, or culturally neutral.28
Thus, it makes sense that organizations create employee
resource groups29 sometimes known as affinity groups
or business resource groups, which are essentially
established networks to promote a welcoming envi-
ronment for minority or under-represented groups.
Attempts to create inclusive workplaces must consider
individual differences, needs, and perceptions as well
as focus on creating structures, systems, and processes
that make people feel valued and treated equitably.30
Some research on antecedents of inclusion is described
below to enhance our understanding of what it takes to
create inclusive workplaces.

a diversity climate.31,32,33 Research also suggests that
in such a climate, employees are willing to speak up
and participate more fully,34 and discrimination and
harassment tend to be lower.35 Some studies have shown
perceptions of inclusion as related with procedural
fairness36 and appreciation of members' contributions
by the leader.37 A climate characterized by open
communication and transparent recruitment, promotion and
development has also been linked to employee inclusion.38
ADeloitte report has found the drivers of inclusion to be
merit-based practices and policies, senior leader behaviours,
managers' behaviours, and work-life balance.39
At the interpersonal level, inclusion calls for respect and
acceptance, empathy, listening skills, dignity, trust, decision-
making authority, and access to information.40,41 Inclusion
suffers when employees view others in terms of
oversimplified stereotypes, thus creating and sustaining
differences, rather than working to integrate and
overcome differences. Blindness to other's social identities
can also be damaging in a diverse work context.42

through their actions, belief in, and commitment to

diversity, creating opportunities for dialogue about
differences, and when required, even altering rules
for acceptable behaviours.43,44 Empirical research
has shown that when leaders solicit and appreciate
employee input, it helps create work climates that are
high in psychological safety.45 The work of Shore et al.46
indicates that both inclusive leadership and inclusive
practices can be viewed as antecedents of inclusion.
An inclusive leader has been characterized as one
who visibly champions diversity and initiatives linked
to it, seeks out and values employees' contributions,
demonstrates a collaborative leadership style, has
the ability to manage conflict, embodies merit-based
decision-making, possesses cultural competency, and
creates a sense of collective identity.47 Interestingly,
the cultural context and role of leadership interact
significantly. For example, in China, relatively stronger
links existed between altruistic leadership, inclusion,
innovation, and citizenship.48
Skills Needed for Creating Inclusive Organizations
While diversity and inclusion are recognized as
important for effective organizations, the specific
research on what skills or competencies are required
to engender inclusion is still in its nascent stage. In
their research, Hays-Thomas, Bowen, and Bourdreaux49
asked their respondents to tell them about a situation in
which they had observed someone dealing either very
effectively or very ineffectively with a work situation
that involved challenges related to diversity among
employees. Required values, knowledge, and skills for
line/staff, middle managers, and top leadership were
identified based on the analysis of the critical incidents
and are shown in Table 1.

OUTCOMES OF INCLUSION
Inclusive work climates have been linked to employee
outcomes of well-being, job satisfaction, and organiza-
tional commitment.50 Some other outcomes of inclusion
are posited as high-quality work relations, job satis-
faction, intention to stay, job performance, organiza-
tional citizenship behaviour, organizational commit-
ment, well-being, creativity, and enhanced career
opportunities.51

representation of historically disadvantaged groups
could be the resentment or backlash from those who do
not directly benefit from such practices, augmenting in
some cases the negative stereotypes that may already
exist.55 As some caution56, there is a need to scrutinize the
extent to which the rhetoric of diversity and inclusion
actually meets the reality and the expression of voice
among the minorities in today's organizations. Thus,
it is important to ensure that diversity and inclusion
efforts are not reduced to tokenism57, as perceived by
the minority group members, and are also seen as fair
by others in the organization.
In this colloquium, our attempt is to capture the
journey of a few organizations, located in India, that
have embraced inclusion in spirit and may have
gone beyond simply having numbers that reflect
diversity. In having the organizations share their
journey--what propelled them, their insights and
practices--we hope to present lessons for Indian
organizations on what it is to create an inclusive work
culture. In the questions that they are asking them-
selves today, we hope to present dilemmas and chal-
lenges that give hints on what needs to be addressed
in terms of unconscious biases and larger societal
issues beyond organizational structures. The six
organizations that we present here are by no means
the only exemplars of inclusive organizations. We are
aware of and have interacted with several organiza-
tions that have embraced inclusion as a high priority
and made clear progress in their respective journeys.58
However, due to space and time considerations, the
sample has been chosen to represent multinational
and Indian origin organizations, manufacturing
and service sector, large- and medium-sized organ-
izations. Moreover, the inclusion of other groups,

Wipro Ltd. is a global information technology,
consulting, and outsourcing company with
over 1.5 lakh employees serving clients in
175 + cities across six continents. It is globally recognized
for its innovative approach towards delivering business
value and its commitment to sustainability. Today the
company is a trusted partner of choice for global busi-
nesses looking to `differentiate at the front' and `stand-
ardize at the core' through technology interventions.
Wipro recognizes that a talented and diverse
workforce is a key competitive advantage, and that
a heterogeneous group is better equipped to handle
complex and intangible problems. Diversity in the
workforce also results in a rich organizational mosaic
of ideas and practices which can enhance innovation
and customer delight leading to higher revenues.
Nurturing diversity and making inclusivity a part of
Wipro's culture has thus remained a key focus area for
the organization and is a strategic enabler to ensure
business and performance.
Wipro's commitment to being an equal opportunity
employer has been integral to its code of conduct,
policies, and processes. In order to give structure and
impetus to the diversity charter and to channelize
concentrated effort in building a more inclusive and
global workforce, the Diversity and Inclusion (D&I)
programme was formally launched in 2008. The
programme is multi-dimensional and consists of four
pillars--gender, persons with disabilities, nationality,
and underprivileged/disadvantaged communities.
Worldwide, research has indicated that there has been
slow progress in these areas as indicated by the low
work participation rate for women in the organized
sector, under-representation of women in leadership
positions, high unemployment rate of persons with
disabilities, etc. Over the years, Wipro's diversity
agenda has focused on driving initiatives to address
these areas and some of these initiatives have gained
prominence as industry benchmarks.
The impact of these efforts is reflected in the current
profile of Wipro's workforce comprising 32 per cent

POLICIES AND PROCESSES
Laying the Foundation for an Inclusive Culture
Being a sensitive and inclusive employer is part of
our vision statement. Our recruitment policy clearly
states that we are an equal opportunity player and
even includes the local diversity agenda for specific
geographies in the addendum. For example, in the
USA, there has to be a certain amount of hiring from
the pool of veterans. When it comes to gender diversity,
our key belief is that as we increase the input pool, there
would be more women with the ability and aspiration
to grow within the organization. So, we have focused
on hiring more women at the entry level to better the
gender ratio through the entire pipeline.
For D&I initiatives to be successful, leadership
support is crucial. Our senior management team has
actively taken part in spreading the message. Today
the communication around D&I is driven through our
internal blog. Several senior leaders including our CEO
publish their blogs here to promote the D&I agenda.
Many also take on mentoring roles for young women
employees in the organization.
Creating a culture that supports diversity requires
sustained focus and effort. We have two internal

people with different sexual orientation (lesbian, gay,
bisexual, transgender--LGBT community) seems to
have a lesser focus in India Inc. when compared to
gender diversity. We have included two articles based
on research and insights shared by organizations
working in these specific areas. The attempt is to begin
a dialogue on nurturing inclusion and reaping bene-
fits of diversity for all organizations.
VIKALPA · VOLUME 40 · ISSUE 3 · JULY-SEPTEMBER 2015 331
training modules around gender sensitization. They
are available online and it is mandated that everyone
completes them by a certain time period after joining
and get certified. In our efforts to ensure gender
diversity, we are sensitive that men may feel side-
lined. So in our gender-related initiatives, we have
tried to include their contribution on this journey. Men
regularly attend our `Women of Wipro' Speaker Series
where we have a facilitated interaction with senior
women employees from our customer organizations.
Many of the mentors in our `WOW Mentorship
programme for high potential women employees'
are senior male employees of Wipro. Essentially,
managers--both men and women--are custodians of
our diversity charter.
BEST PRACTICES AT WIPRO
Gender Diversity
What has worked for us at Wipro is to not look at gender
diversity from a `one size fits all' approach. The life
stages of women employees can be roughly divided
into three phases. The early years of their career, when
the key driver is to learn new technologies, and there
are less constraints in terms of hours at work or travel.
The next is the middle stage where life changes with
marriage or childbirth, and the women need flexibility
and organizational support to sustain their careers.
The third stage is essentially where the personal
front seems more settled and the drive seems to be
around the impact one is making on the organization.
Monetary rewards by themselves become less of a
motivator and the woman employee will continue
within the organization only if she is able to make a
difference to the larger charter of the organization,
through hugely visible projects, client interfacing roles
or driving important agendas for the organization. We
have realized that the unique needs and aspirations
of each of the three stages need to be taken into
account in planning the strategies for inclusion. Being
sensitive to these stages has specifically helped us at
Wipro to increase the number of women in the middle
management levels.
Women in Leadership
Under gender diversity, we have a mentoring
programme that has been in place for the last three
years. In this programme, senior leaders--both men
and women--act as mentors to women employees.
Close to 100 women employees across the globe are
selected and put through the mentoring initiative with
the objective of grooming them for leadership roles.
While the manager is definitely available to discuss
career growth, having a mentor helps create dedicated
time where the young mentees can discuss relevant
issues on a regular basis. Right at the beginning of the
process, each mentee defines a clear objective with
her mentor and the progress is tracked through the
engagement. Through this programme, we are aiming
at increasing the number of women in the middle
management levels. When we started this programme
in 2012, we had a gender ratio of almost 50 per cent,
which dropped to 8 per cent as they reached the senior
levels. However, today the share of women employees
in the middle management level has moved to 22 per
cent from 2014.
Generational Diversity
Another important area for us has been to ensure
inclusion around generational diversity--with 54 per
cent of our employees being between 22 and 30 years,
40 per cent between 30 and 45 years, and 6 per cent
above 45 years. We ran an employee perception survey
every two years and in a voluntary section called the
`generational survey', we asked questions specific to
what people across different generations valued. The
survey challenged a prejudice several of us had about
millennials--that they got disinterested quickly and
changed jobs at every given opportunity. It showed
that their value system was not too different from
the older generations, that they also valued learning,
growth; they just may seem a little more self-occupied
than others. This was a huge eye-opener for us.
The survey also showed certain trends--like social
networking--that one could definitely subscribe to
the millennials. This led us to lift the organization-
wide ban on access to the social network sites such
as Facebook and Twitter. Seeing how much learning
happened through this medium, we actually
developed our own networking tool, called Yammer.
We actively encourage the use of Yammer as a forum
for people to form groups with different interest and
skills for writing code in a specific technology, and
resolving specific issues.
Hiring of People with Disabilities
At Wipro, people with disabilities (PwDs) have been
placed in mainstream positions (see Figure 1). Wipro
selects all its employees based only on merit and it
332 COLLOQUIUM
believes that persons with disability could aspire for
any of these positions. In the last four years, the number
of employees who have disclosed their disabilities has
reached over 440.
To support the differently abled people, we have
looked at different aspects of infrastructure, training,
and sensitization.
Wipro is a member of the Confederation of Indian
Industry (CII), the NationalAssociation of Software and
Services Companies (NASSCOM), and International
Labour Organization (ILO). With CII and NGOs, such
as Sarthak, Ability Foundation, and Enable India, it
has run job fairs to help differently abled people with
a platform to find job opportunities besides organizing
inclusive campus hiring with JSS, Dr Ambedkar
Institute of Technology For Handicapped (AITH), and
National Institute of Speech and Hearing (NISH). We
have established relationships with colleges where
there are students with disabilities, and we encourage
them to participate.

We have an Interviewer Certification Programme
which prepares interviewers to be inclusive. So far,
over a 1,000 interviewers have cleared this course. The
recruiter while interviewing candidates with disability
elicits information on what reasonable accommodation
could be required while going through a selection
process. We have introduced a self-identification form
in which employees could indicate any accessibility
issue or accommodation requirement at the time of
joining. Any accessibility issue that has been brought
up so far has been effectively resolved in 48 hours by
the company. Battery-operated vehicles have been
procured for people with disabilities to travel within
the campus.
The Travel and Transport Policy has been revamped
to include `reasonable accommodations'. Wipro
is committed to providing additional reasonable
accommodation wherever required to ensure a level
playing ground for people with disabilities.
Barrier-free Communication
The Wipro Kinesics website has been developed to
maintain a communicative environment between
hearing and hearing-disabled employees in Wipro.
It is a combination of Indian, American, and local
sign languages. The tool includes sections on Wipro
terminologies, detailed dictionary, conversation,
and sign language basics. Wipro Kinesics brings
to prominence the need for communication to be
barrier-free and for such communication at work
to include categories of disability like speech and
hearing. Through this, we anticipate that a large
number of organizations may be able to attract talent
with speech and hearing disabilities and improve
career opportunities for them.
`Winclusive' is a vibrant community of employees
with disabilities that discusses the applicants'
accessibility. The community posts change requests.
These are implemented to the extent feasible. Changes
are internally tested and released to the community
which then validates the application. Also, help
requests by new employees are addressed through
this community. This helps enable new employees
to become quickly productive. The team has also
reviewed all our employee policies numbering up to 58
and has come out with recommendations on possible
reasonable accommodation for people with disabilities.
`Winclusive' community has now become a part of
Wipro's social media platform, Yammer, which has
been successfully able to connect people and share
global updates in the disability sector.
Managers and leaders are trained in sign language.
Rendition of the Indian National Anthem is done in
sign language to create an inclusive environment.
Wipro observes the International Day for People with
Disabilities every year on December 3, by building
sensitivity amongst employees at large and also by
inviting NGOs working with PwDs to display their
products and share their expertise.
We have a PWD engagement calendar through which
townhalls,paneldiscussions,rewardsandrecognitions,
VIKALPA · VOLUME 40 · ISSUE 3 · JULY-SEPTEMBER 2015 333
feedback session with managers of disabled employees,
etc. are regularly planned and organized.
Barrier Free Infrastructure
`Breaking all Barriers', an annual contest for Wipro
employees, is a forum through which employees
review Wipro's physical infrastructure (accessibility
within buildings, accessible restrooms, railings, ramps,
signages, etc.) and collaborate with the Facilities
team to bring about changes. An exclusive policy on
accessibility on the intranet portal helps individuals
to suggest reasonable accommodation requirements
to the Facilities team. Wipro's Building Standards
(which was earlier based on National Building Code
2005) have been modified to include international
norms developed by the United Nations `Accessibility
for the Disabled, A Design Manual for a Barrier Free
Environment', and the latest draft of the Building
Code prepared by the National Centre for Promotion
of Employment for Disabled People (NCPEDP) and
AccessAbility, India.
Accessible Information Systems
Wipro has a set of over 100 software applications
that are used by over 1,00,000 employees daily. These
applications address a variety of requirements in
HR, travel, leave, cash, career, etc. These applications
are created by the Information Systems (IS) Team,
and maintained by a team of over 500 employees.
Before deployment, each application is extensively
validated against the WCAG-2.0 guidelines (Web
Content Accessibility Guidelines) with a focus on visual
and motor disabilities. After deployment, the software
is field tested by the community group. Deviations
or modification requests reported by the field are
prioritized and the application is re-deployed to ensure
that it meets WCAG-2.0 guidelines. Wipro.com, the
website of Wipro, has also been made accessible by
following the WCAG2.0 guidelines.
Skills have to be augmented to enable a software
developer to develop as per the WCAG-2.0. Each
engineer is first made aware of the needs of persons
with disabilities. They are then trained­in person, or
through webinars, or through e-training sessions­on
what makes software accessible. After the training,
they have to clear assessment tests to get certified. The
course content is upgraded periodically to meet the
changes and challenges of new technologies (such as
mobile enablement). It is reassuring to see many of
these certified employees reflecting a changed outlook.
Wipro has a full-time consultant from Diversity and
Equal Opportunity Centre (DEOC) to keep us abreast of
the changes in the environment, statutory obligations,
and also to advise on taking the inclusivity initiative for
employees with disabilities to the next level.
Inclusion of Disadvantaged Community
A Rural BPO
Wipro's rural BPO centre was launched in Manjakkudi
in 2011 as a `Back Office to Back Office Model' as the
result of a tie-up with Swami Dayananda Education
Trust. The trust strives to provide quality education to
the economically backward regions of Tamil Nadu. The
centre completed three years in 2014 and from an initial
strength of 50 employees, it grew to 100 employees
in the second year, and around 150 employees in the
third year. The centre has enabled the creation of job
opportunities and in turn reduced the migration of
youth to urban areas.
Tracking Inclusion through Audits
Besides industry research and engagement with
external stakeholders on D&I themes, Wipro tracks
key diversity indicators to identify opportunity
areas. Our key organizational metrics are gender
disaggregated and published in the public domain
in our business responsibility report and standalone
sustainability report. These indicators include
workforce composition, leadership pipeline, attrition
percentage, training data, and results of the biennial
employee perception survey, which includes
questions on D&I, freedom of expression, fairness,
etc. The structured analysis of these data drives the
D&I goals for the year. For instance, three years ago,
we looked at how salary increases were happening for
women employees across the organization. This audit
highlighted that, while there was no apparent
disparity in the senior management, in the lower
levels, in some pockets, women seemed to get the
short end of the stick. This could possibly be due
to managers getting the men in the teams to stretch
more or possibly a prevalent societal bias that the
men as a single breadwinner need a better salary than
the women, who possibly are part of double income
families. Since these were isolated incidents and not
334 COLLOQUIUM
all-pervasive, we addressed it by counselling the
individual managers to eliminate these disparities.
Last year, we also commissioned three key in-house
surveys to identify current gender equity perspectives
in the organization and to identify the focus areas.
The survey results have produced Six-Sigma action
plans around global deployment efforts, lateral hiring
practices, and company-wise tracking, monitoring, and
publishing of these efforts.
COUNTERING CHALLENGES IN INCLUSION
Societal biases around gender obviously creep into the
workplace. For instance, a manager's perception on how
hard it is to expect the women team members to take late
night calls or stretch at times may come in the way of
him/her having a good gender diversity in his/her team.
Second, when it comes to the differently abled, despite
the infrastructure being there, some employees may
feel that someone who is, say visually impaired, may
not have the same speed on delivering like the others
in the team. While such beliefs may not be prevalent,
identifying where they exist and sensitively dealing with
it at an individual level need a sustained effort.
Wipro being an equal opportunity employer considers
differently abled candidates at par with the candidates
without disability. However, to be able to hire more
of differently abled candidates, we need to develop
more people with the skills required in the IT sector.
Wipro has collaborated with NGOs and institutes to
train and develop the differently abled candidates
and prepare them for the IT industry. Also, at times,
there could be reluctance among the business groups
in letting on board a differently abled employee in
their teams.
Increased awareness and sensitization sessions on the
inclusion of PWDs and showcasing the achievements
of our differently abled employees in the town halls
help us address these biases.
GOING FORWARD
Currently, although we operate at a global level, we
are still largely Indian. Over the next few years, one
of the focus areas would be on how we could become
a more global organization by recruiting men and
women of different nationalities and cultures. We are
also looking at how best we can create a level-playing
field for differently abled employees and bridge the
gap between their hiring and their placement in a
project and ensure a better long-term career path for the
differently abled employees.

price-sensitive and competitive market. Serving around
184 million customers, Vodafone provides innovative,
customer-friendly, and differentiated products and
services through a wide scale distribution and exclu-
sive retail footprint--backed up with a modern, tech-
nologically advanced network for both voice and data.
A value-based organization, Vodafone is committed to
achieving the highest standards of health, safety, and
well-being for its employees and business partners.
As a responsible corporate, Vodafone India has been
working with several partners from the social sector to
address some of India's most pressing challenges over
the years. Sustainability for Vodafone is an ongoing
journey as it believes that what is good for the society
VIKALPA · VOLUME 40 · ISSUE 3 · JULY-SEPTEMBER 2015 335
is good for business. The Vodafone Foundation too
is actively engaged in corporate social responsibility
(CSR) by harnessing the potential of mobile services and
technology to maximize impact within communities,
especially in the domains of women, agriculture,
education, and disaster relief.
THE DIVERSITY JOURNEY AT VODAFONE
VodafoneIndiaemploys13,000people,ofwhichwomen
comprise 20 per cent of the workforce. Employees
work in 23 different circles pan India. The company
consciously began to focus on three key pillars of
diversity--gender, ethnicity, and business experiences
and skills--in 2010. In the last five years, the practice
has led to diversity reflecting across the organization,
be it at the circle level, in the corporate office, or at the
Vodafone group level.
Enhancing the diversity of the workforce has a clear
business impetus. Thirty-three per cent of the telecom
customer base is women and ensuring a similar gender
ratio in the workforce meant better engagement with the
customer. Consciously, adding diversity in nationality
and experience also meant a huge scope for innovation
and new products. It is believed that different ways of
thinking and approaches are the core advantage of a
diverse workforce.
As we embarked on increasing diversity, we realized
that just stating something as a diversity agenda would
not suffice. To bring in and ensure the acceptance of
each specific group required widespread and in-depth
attention. To inspire a change in culture for the inclusion
of a variety of minority groups within the organization,
a change in mindset was necessary. Thus, we decided
to focus on first, increasing the number of women in the
organization and also integrating them and making it
possible for them to contribute to the maximum of their
potential. It was assumed that unless we tackled gender
diversity and demonstrated exemplary performance
around this area, the employees may become sceptic of
our larger programme of increasing diversity and reduce
thecommitmenttomakediversityhappenonotherfronts.
SUPPORTING INCLUSION
Senior Management Support and Sensitization
The starting point at Vodafone India was to support
diversity and create a work environment that believed
in diversity and supported inclusion. Our top
management and the strategic leadership team were
very clear that this was the right thing to do. In fact,
Marten Pieters, a former MD and CEO of Vodafone
India, hosted the first Focused Group Discussion
(FGD) with women employees to get a pulse of the
issues on the ground. The organization then spent
close to a year and a half preparing the ground in
creating a culture that would embrace and support
diversity and inclusion. A module around inclusive
leadership and unconscious bias was conducted
for 2,500 + line managers to initiate a change in
the mindset and also to enroll the senior leaders as
champions of diversity.
Naturally, the starting point for these inclusion sessions
was the Executive Committee. The sessions were then
conducted across different circles with the business
head of that particular circle as the host. This helped
to communicate that it was not an HR initiative but
something that the business managers also believed in
and supported.
At the end of each of these workshops, each of the
circles came up with a list of things that they wanted
to work on to include diverse people in their circles.
Based on the analysis of action points chosen at each
circle in India, Vodafone chose the top three areas to
work on to ensure that specific nuances and priorities
common to all regions would get addressed. People
within each of the circles partnered with the HR teams
to make the necessary changes required to build the
right culture to support diversity and inclusion. Such
initiatives included: sensitizing line managers on
respectful language, work-life balance practices, and
women-friendly policies.
POLICIES AND PRACTICES
We have paid attention to the challenge of ensuring
inclusion through specific policies and practices.
For example, to support gender diversity, we have
identified two specific issues that stop women from
contributing to their potential--maternity leave and
a sense of safety and security--and have adopted
appropriate measures:
· We have introduced the global minimum standard
of four months of maternity leave across all our
operating companies across the world and also
implemented reduced hours of work for six months
post-return from maternity for child care.
336 COLLOQUIUM
We have also laid out a detailed maternity-
transitioning process to support the women on
maternity. It also enables the line manager to plan
work better. In fact, the transitioning process starts
even before the women employee goes on maternity
leave. We sensitize the line managers to take care of
her special needs during this period, reassess her
goals to ensure that they are commensurate with her
stage of maternity, have role-related conversations
in advance, and bring in the replacement in the
form of a maternity cover. We assign a buddy who
stays connected with her during the leave period.
On return, the employee is re-oriented into the
organization/role. Enough care is taken to see
that she does not lose on her benefits, for example,
incentives, bonus, etc. while on maternity leave and
KPIs are reworked to ensure that they match the
hours she will work.
· For women in our organization, we have customized
the philosophy of `Safe Workplace, Safe Travel and
Safe Stay':

It is mandatory to have a late night drop facility
via a company vehicle in case a women employee
happens to work late.

In some locations, such a drop is additionally
supported with a security person escorting the
woman right up to her door step.
When women employees are scheduled to arrive
late from outstation trips, they are provided
company vehicles to get to their home from the
airport/station.

All vendors providing transport services have
undergone police verification and background
checks.

Moreover, hotels or guesthouses need to follow
specific instructions to ensure the safety of
women for empanelment.

Prevention of sexual harassment at workplace
is very strongly enforced by the Internal
Complaints Committee.
Tracking Inclusion
To ensure that the people who are hired are included in
the real sense, we have also put in place the tracking of
numbers at the hiring stage--both in terms of gender
and in getting people from diverse experiences and
skills. On a regular basis, data around increments
and promotions are reviewed to ensure that all the
deserving people are getting recommended for
promotion irrespective of the gender and that there is
no disparity on the basis of gender. There are regular
dipstick surveys to ensure that Vodafone India is seen
as an equal pay and equal opportunity employer.
In the annual Vodafone People Survey, there are specific
questions on diversity and inclusion; for instance, `Am
I being treated fairly?' `Am I being respected?' The
responses are closely tracked at an organization level.
This survey is conducted yearly and forms a part of
Managers' report which is viewed very closely by the
organization. As Ashok Ramchandran, Director, HR,
Vodafone India, says: `Even if a manager is delivering
great results but is not sensitive, then he is not the right
person for us. And we have had to part ways with some
people of this kind as an exception'.
Driving Inclusion through Communication
Discussion on the inclusion of women is part of the
biannual town halls. Senior leaders, the CEO, the HR
director, all make it a point to repeatedly talk about
inclusion of women. Management conferences held
each year also make it a point to showcase the D&I
results. The best circle awards are decided by adding
diversity and inclusion of women as a criterion for
judging the performance on each circle.
Addressing Exclusion
All the Vodafone circles have an internal complaints
committee where any person, be it a man or a woman,
can report any sexual harassment that they may be
experiencing at the workplace. There are frequent
campaigns, through e-mailers, communication by
business managers encouraging people to speak up to
highlight issues.
`ZubaanSambhalKe' campaigns--A series of awareness
mailers have been circulated to men and women
employees highlighting the various aspects of sexual
harassment at the workplace and beyond. Additionally,
associatedlegalimplicationshavealsobeenhighlighted.
The focus on diversity and inclusion has resulted in
several unique practices within the organization.
One such concept that has gained a life of its own and
made an impact is the Vodafone Inclusivity Network
(VIN). It is detailed in Exhibit 1.
The Angel Stores
Vodafone India has set up 34 `Angel Stores' across 21
circles in the country. These retail outlets are managed
VIKALPA · VOLUME 40 · ISSUE 3 · JULY-SEPTEMBER 2015 337
and run entirely by women employees, thereby making
them unique. From the security and pantry staff, to
the customer service resources and management-level
personnel, women occupy all the positions. The company
believes that this is a way to empower women employees.
The `Angel Stores' have been successful in building and
maintaining loyalty among all their customers--both
men and women. In keeping with the Vodafone tradition,
the customer service offered at these stores matches the
class and standard of all other Vodafone retail outlets.
The friendly female staff helps customers, both men and
women, feel at ease while they are visiting the stores
and purchasing products, thus enhancing customer
experience.
`Project Shakti': Building Diversity in the
Frontline
Afocused initiative is to hire women for non-traditional
roles by giving them exclusive support for one year.
For instance, we went to engineering colleges in rural
locations and hired an all-women batch of graduate
The 4C model for valuing diversity and promoting
inclusion involves Customer, Colleagues,
Community, and Communication. There is a VIN
chapter in each Circle. The Circle chapters take the
onus of creating engagement initiatives around
the 4Cs. There is a quarterly meet of circle senior
sponsors to share best practices with corporate. The
entire network is driven by the 23 business circles
across India. VIN teams across the circles have both
men and women employees across different levels
who drive the 4C initiatives.
· The 4C initiatives for including more women have
the following objectives:
· To inspire and empower women to maximize
their potential for both individual and business
success
· To promote cross-gender understanding and
an inclusive culture wherein people get a safer
environment to communicate thoughts and views
specifically on any cultural or policy barriers
· To support the creation of a consistent Vodafone
employer brand that is attractive to women
· To provide insights into the requirements of female
customers to inform the development of Vodafone
products and service

Coffee with the CEO
engineer trainees or field trainees. The selected women
were specifically hired to work in sales and were
assigned as a responsibility of the senior people in the
circle who were their mentors. The mentor doubled as
sponsor as well by ensuring that the hired women were
successful in their assignment and overcame challenges
if any. The trainees were put on a year's rotation
programme focusing on understanding the product,
market, customers, and process. During that period
they were not given any actual responsibility or role.
Post the first year, they were transferred to territories
within the circle as territory leaders.
The project has been a success and the hired women are
all performing well in roles which were predominantly
done earlier by male colleagues. This initiative is
now being run in other circles across Vodafone with
every circle having its own name. The project is now
currently running in the second year with a third year
planned soon.
In the first year, we had hired 15 trainees, and seeing
the success of the programme, increased the number
to 28 in the second year. We continue to build on this
programme.

`Project Samridhi': Fe-tailers--Our Women
Retailers
Vodafone Samridhi is an integral part of Vodafone's
objective to encourage women empowerment in
Haryana, thereby making a difference to the lives of the
communities we engage with.
Under the project, Vodafone has appointed women
from the lowest echelons of the society to encourage
them to become entrepreneurs and earn a living for
themselves. This programme is slated to be extended
to other districts in rural Haryana in a phased manner.
As part of the pilot, 24 women from Narnaul in
Mahendergarh district were trained to sell e-top-ups
and recharge vouchers. As an additional support
mechanism, Vodafone women retailers have been
given special incentives in the first two months.
This pilot was successful and now we have 66 such
Fe-tailers.
This initiative has given a huge recognition to the brand
Vodafone and has enabled the reach of Vodafone in
rural areas which were otherwise difficult to penetrate.
It has also given an opportunity of earning a living to
women in rural areas.
Career Development: Pathways to Success and
Everywoman Network
`Pathways to Success' is a career development series
for our women employees to take on future leadership
roles in the organization. They come together for two
days and focus on Career Maps, Personal Brand, and
Networking; and the series has been very well received.
In addition, we have enrolled all our women on
`Everywoman Network'. Everywoman is the world's
largest web-based network and learning and
development platform for women in business and
female entrepreneurs. It enables like-minded women
to share experiences, opportunities, and ideas; they are
provided a backdrop to enable confidence and success
to grow.
We have also been making some efforts in including
persons with disability and creating openness for
people with different sexual orientation and ensuring
the success of those coming from diverse educational
backgrounds.
Working with Differently Abled: `Project Drishti'
VodafoneIndiahastiedupwiththeNationalAssociation
of Blind (NAB) to hire visually impaired associates for
the call centre in Mumbai on an experimental basis.
These associates are supported by imparting specific
training and converting the collaterals in Braille and
by providing infrastructure support in terms of giving
them Braille-enabled phone and so on.
`The core objective is to create a win­win between our
business goals and critical social cause by generating skill
sets and earning opportunity amongst the differently
abled people, and helping them become self-dependent'.
When experimented in Mumbai, it was found that
their productivity was higher than the others; they had
higher conviction and convincing power, were polite
and persuasive, and their commitment was noticeably
higher. NAB was therefore approached for the tie-up
to start with this unique project called `Drishti' and it
spread in other circles across the country as well.
Celebrations
Besides week-long celebrations to commemorate
the International Women's Week, globally Vodafone
has started to celebrate Parent's Day, and also has
special programmes for people from different sexual
orientation or preferences and so on.
VIN keeps the topic of D&I alive in all our 23 circles.
The D&I practices and line managers at Vodafone
continue to be recognized:
- Arvind Vohra, Operations Director East, was given
the WILL Choice of Women's Awards 2014 for his
leadership and support to the D&I agenda.
- Dilip Kumar Ganta received the D&I Champion for
the `I Inspire Biz Diva Awards 2015'.
- Vodafone figures in the top two MNCs, according
to a survey conducted by AON Hewitt, which
benchmarks its D&I focus and best practices.
Inclusion for Diverse Skillsets
We have also spread our net far and wide to attract
professionals from all backgrounds. To ensure that the
recruits who come from non-telecom backgrounds are
able to function well in Vodafone, we have worked on
designing a very structured onboarding process. The
newmanagementtraineesandpeoplefromnon-telecom
VIKALPA · VOLUME 40 · ISSUE 3 · JULY-SEPTEMBER 2015 339
backgrounds undergo cross-functional induction and
an intense technology session. There are 30-, 60-, and
90-day modules to ensure that the recruits interact with
the right people to gain a better understanding of the
business and the industry.
THE WAY AHEAD
In retrospect we know that the initial efforts to drive
conversations across the organization enabled us to
set the right tone for driving diversity and inclusion,
helping employees see the business imperative and
reduce the risk of diversity and inclusion initiative
as being just another good-to-do thing. The decision
to focus on one aspect of diversity and do a deep-
dive in it further helped achieve visible results in a
short timespan. `Over the past two years, we focused
intensely on becoming gender-balanced and moved
from having 14 per cent women in our workforce to
20 per cent today. This focus will continue in the next
phase of our evolution,' confirms Ashok Ramchandran,
Director, HR, Vodafone India. `The company's
`Discover Graduate' programme, under which it
hires from business schools and technology institutes,
focuses on 50 per cent women hires at the entry-level.
The transformation agenda will continue!'
Countering the mindset especially at the supervisory
levels is an ongoing challenge. In certain small pockets,
we also encounter biases/prejudices around what
women employees are capable of doing--for instance,
meeting aggressive sales targets, travelling extensively,
and being interested in taking up certain kinds of
roles. The other big obstacle is the leaking pipeline--
women opting to quit owing to a whole lot of societal
and personal reasons. This is also related to the larger
societal construct that women after all need to take
care of their families and unless society makes it more
and more conducive for women to get educated and
progress as professionals, this will be a challenge for
organizations across the board.
At Vodafone, we recognize inclusion as a process, an
ongoing journey. Given the commitment from our top
management and the sustained discussions and efforts
across different levels, we know we are on the right
track in creating a culture that welcomes and celebrates
diversity in its truest essence.

MakeMyTrip.com, India's leading online travel
company, was founded in the year 2000. It
was launched in the USAto primarily market
to NRI travellers. Founder Deep Kalra conceptualized
it with the vision of empowering Indian travellers with
a greater choice, transparency, and convenience. The
success in the US market was followed up by an India
launch in 2005. As the first and only comprehensive
online travel site with real time booking for flights,
hotels, holidays, and cars, MakeMyTrip.com rapidly
became the preferred choice of millions of travellers.
A pioneer among online travel companies in India,
MakeMyTrip.com enjoys great top-of-mind recall and
is now synonymous with online travel in the country.
MakeMyTrip proactively began to diversify its
product offering in 2007, adding a variety of services
such as hotel bookings and holiday packages. It also
adopted a hybrid model through self-owned and
franchisee brick-and-mortar stores to reach out to
customers in Tier 2 markets. The first retail office was
set up in Ahmedabad in 2007. Today, MakeMyTrip is
a one-stop-travel shop that offers a broad selection
of travel products and services in India. It has 24
company-owned travel stores in 18 cities and 42
340 COLLOQUIUM
franchisee-owned travel stores which primarily sell
travel packages in 38 cities.
MakeMyTrip is the dominant market leader with 47
per cent market-share (as per an independent study
conducted by Phocus Wright in 2013). Remaining
reliable, efficient and at the forefront of technology,
MakeMyTrip's commitment and customer centricity
allow it to better understand and provide for its
customers' diverse needs and wants, and to deliver
consistently. It enjoys the reputation of being
technology-forward and innovative--and delighting
customers through service and value-based offerings.
It has a popular travel app in the market, with over 7.2
million downloads to date.
After becoming the first Indian travel company to list
overseas through its initial public offering (IPO) in
NASDAQ in 2010, MakeMyTrip expanded its global
footprint through acquisitions such as Luxury Tours
& Travel (Singapore), HotelTravel.com (Bangkok),
and EasyToBook.com (Amsterdam). It has received
numerous accolades for providing best-in-class services
to travellers including the World Travel Awards (2014),
CNBC Travel Award (2013), and the Lonely Planet
Travel Award for best travel facilitator (2012 and 2013).
Setting Out on the Diversity Trip
MakeMyTrip employs 2,600 employees in the age range
of 22­50, located in 24 cities in India and six countries.
Today women comprise 40 per cent of the workforce.
There are employees belonging to more than 10
countries. There is a conscious attempt to increase
diversity beyond gender and increase regional diversity
because it is expected to impact business positively.
Diverse perspectives, it is argued, would provide richer
insights into help create and shape products that serve
the needs of a large and diverse customer base.
Making Inclusion a Reality
Given our diverse group and the understanding that
efforts were needed for us to work smoothly with each
other, the D&I Council was set up in 2012 to drive
inclusion. It has the sponsorship and support from the
senior-most leaders. This council is owned by a body
of 35 employees that represent various functions and
tenures. The D&I Council agenda is divided into four
focus areas:
1. Inclusive communication platforms
2. Celebration of diversity
3. Improving the gender ratio at the mid-to-senior
level
4. Providing better facilities at the workplace
Each of these subgroups has worked to ensure
the adoption and sustenance of these inclusion
agendas. Several changes in policy, infrastructure,
and interventions were introduced based on the
recommendations of the council members. Some of
these are listed below:
· Ensuring the safety of women employees, travel
rosters, and customer visits are planned mindfully.
· Given that there are concerns about safety for
those employees on the road, MakeMyTrip
partnered with Smart 24×7 to introduce an app
that assists users during emergency situations
through features, such as panic buttons, panic
alerts, travel-status updates, and voice- and photo
recording. The safety app is very popular with
employees, and has been downloaded by 75 per
cent of the women-employee base and 66 per cent
of the total employee base.
· Revised laptop policy: Lighter laptops were
introduced following the employee feedback. These
are being rolled out first for new hires and women
employees and over a period of time it would cover
the entire employee population.
· Flexibility in workplace attire: Smart casuals to
ensure employees are comfortable in the workplace.
Also, offer freedom to wear/display religious motifs
such as tilak, kada, hijab.
· Industry-leading maternity leave policy: Three
months of fully paid leave plus three months of
additional leaves (with half-pay or work from home).
· Provision for infrastructure support for pregnant
employees, such as ergonomic chair, foot rest,
special cab if required.
· In the case of critical positions, a hire may be made
once the incumbent goes on maternity leave.
However, the employee is assured that she will return
to the role once she re-joins from her maternity leave.
· Celebrating regional festivals across offices nation-
wide and encouraging employee participation
through contests and other on-ground engagement
activities.
· Nukkad nataks (street plays) performed on the floor
stressing on the need for changing mindsets towards
diversity and inclusion.
One initiative that has created a huge win­win situation
for the organization is the creation of opportunities
for women to work from home. MakeMyTrip is the
VIKALPA · VOLUME 40 · ISSUE 3 · JULY-SEPTEMBER 2015 341
first company (in the travel and e-commerce space) to
introduce work-from-home opportunities for women:
Holiday Experts Channel.
We recognized that a large number of women have had to
giveuptheircorporatecareersmid-streamduetohomeor
family reasons. A very talented workforce exists outside
the corporate ecosystem that is keen to make careers on
their own terms. This insight led to the conceptualization
of the Holiday Expert Channel. This was launched with
33 people in Delhi in 2012, and followed by phased
launches in Mumbai, Bengaluru, and Kolkata. Today, the
channel has grown to a 1,000-plus network across nine
cities including non-metro centres, such as Ahmedabad,
Chandigarh, and Pune. The programme is also being run
in Chennai and Hyderabad.
The Holiday Expert Channel programme is designed
specifically for stay-at-home women who have prior
work experience and love to travel. MakeMyTrip offers
them the opportunity to take up customer queries, help
plan and sell a holiday, and earn up to a one-third share
of the profits on every holiday booking. This is a flexible
programme; so, the women can devote as much time as
they are comfortable with. On average, a holiday expert
books 4­6 holidays every month, earning between
`20,000 and 30,000 a month. Top-selling holiday experts
can make up to `65,000 a month.
Potentialhiresaregraduateswithgoodcommunications
skills and customer service orientation. MakeMyTrip
provides all the necessary training and background
information to transform these ladies into `Holiday
Experts'. They are given access to the database and
proprietary software so that they can create an ideal
holiday package for customers. They also undergo
extensive training and are educated about various
travel destinations, MakeMyTrip booking processes,
transaction modalities, and other related details.
We have identified a huge pool of women who have
to give up their corporate careers mid-stream due to
home or family reasons. A very talented workforce
exists outside the corporate ecosystem that is keen to
make careers on their own terms. This insight led to
the conceptualization of the Holiday Expert channel.
This programme has been a huge success for us across
various parameters. We feel extremely proud to offer
an exciting job opportunity to a talented workforce that
had to drop off the tenured career track. Women in our
Holiday Experts programme are driven to succeed,
extremely engaged, and motivated. Little wonder than
that in a short span of time, this channel is contributing
20­25 per cent of our holiday business. It brings down
operational expenses since we do not have to invest in
fixed assets for these employees. Overall this is a win­
win proposition for both the employees and business.
Our acknowledgement of the value it offers is evident
in the pace of growth of this channel.
Managing Challenges at the Ground Level
Being a young organization, there is good bonding
among employees and not much resistance to new ways
of thinking and doing business. However, the journey
towards increasing diversity is new. Although there
is an understanding of why it is important to increase
diversity, there are also challenges regarding firmly
deep-rooted stereotypes and beliefs that impact the
perceptionsandacceptanceoftheothergroup.Therefore,
ground-level campaigns and robust communication
measures are required to drive the mindset change.
Tracking performance and sharing relevant data have
helped change mindsets and build the business case for
diversity. Over the years, we believe that the D&I charter
and the council have been able to firmly entrench the
need to have diversity and reasonable accommodations
that need to be made to increase diversity. Yet, there is
a dearth of senior women leadership in MakeMyTrip.
We are not sure how to have more women in the top
management.Webelievethatmentoringofhighpotential
women may help to attract women to these jobs. It is the
next challenge that has been taken up by the Diversity
Council. Also, given the nature of our business, it is best
for us to continuously foster the diversity of age, regions,
and religions in our workforce.
Fostering Inclusion at Schneider Electric, India R&D

Schneider Electric develops technologies and
solutions to make energy safe, reliable, efficient,
productive, and green. As a global specialist in
energy management and automation with operations
in more than 100 countries, Schneider Electric offers
integrated energy solutions across multiple market
segments. The group invests heavily in R&D in order
to sustain innovation and differentiation, with a strong
commitment to sustainable development.
Schneider Electric's India R&D in Bengaluru is one
among the key R&D centres for the group, some of the
others being in France, US, Mexico, and China. The
India R&D Centre hosts close to 1,500 employees who
provide R&D services to the five main lines of business
globally. It is a highly matrixed organization with
business units reporting globally.
Schneider Electric recognizes that diversity and inclu-
sion are not `nice-to-have' features in a corporate state-
ment, but are an essential ingredient of a progressive,
high performance, and innovative organization. Global
research and our personal experience have shown us
that diversity is clearly linked to productivity, perfor-
mance, creativity, and innovation. Our customer base
is also becoming more diverse, especially with women
taking more buying decisions and exercising more
purchasing power. It is essential therefore that our
workforce mirrors the diversity of our customers for us
to better address their requirements.
When we started our diversity journey several years
ago, one area of focus was to increase the gender
diversity in the organization. The second population
we looked at included differently abled individuals
(visual impairment, speech/hearing impairment, and
orthopaedic impairment).
MAKING INCLUSION A REALITY

Diversity & Inclusion at the forefront of our aspirations
for the workforce. It is a critical component in how we
will develop the organization and has the sponsorship
of the executive committee.
Some of the conscious practices in supporting Diversity
and Inclusion in our India R&D Centre are outlined
below.
Creating a Representative Diversity Committee
In Schneider Electric India R&D, we progressively put
together a Diversity and Inclusion (D&I) Committee
which is composed, led, and activated almost entirely
by employees from the core business units (very
small representation from HR). This committee itself
represents the kind of diversity we value in Schneider
Electric--as it has people from different generations
(from millennials to people in their fifties), genders,
and also persons with disabilities. All members are
voluntarily a part of this committee which is headed
by a senior manager. The team works together to select
specific action areas towards inclusion for each year
and conceptualize programmes to run for those areas
and then implement the same.
Leadership Commitment
Senior leaders of the organizations have specific
targets around building up diversity in their teams.
The HR business partners are tasked with supporting
their leaders on the D&I agenda. Strong messaging
from our apex leaders at the global as well as the
local level gives D&I the much needed support and
sustained momentum at Schneider Electric. At the
global level, two leaders from our HR Council have
been assigned to lead Diversity & Inclusion across all
countries where we have a presence. The respective
senior HR leaders in these countries have been
assigned the D&I portfolio to ensure good traction
and focus.
POLICIES AND PRACTICES
Specific efforts are made to identify, engage, develop,
and retain high potential diversity employees.
Development programmes that involve elements
like international assignments, coaching/mentoring
on as and when needed basis, exposure to internal
and external thought leaders (e.g., through panel
discussions, leadership seminars, guest lectures, and
more), opportunities to connect with local and global
VIKALPA · VOLUME 40 · ISSUE 3 · JULY-SEPTEMBER 2015 343
leaders of Schneider Electric, and customized learning
workshops are some of the inputs that are available
to the diverse employee group. One of our interesting
initiatives was a theatre workshop run by the celebrated
women thespians for 20 high-potential women in the
Schneider Electric R&D. The workshop was designed
to help these high-potential women employees learn
methods by which they could express themselves more
powerfully in the business sphere.
In addition, we have put in place some significant
policies and facilities, specially designed to support
diversity in our workforce. These policies include work-
from-home, flexi-hours, and a crèche facility adjoining
our campus. It has been communicated across the
organization that all of these facilities are open to all
employees, not just women employees. It is our belief
that if the benefits are inclusive of all, they create a
positive acceptance for the diverse groups and also
convey the message that in spirit we are being inclusive.
To specifically support women employees, we have
looked at both policies and infrastructure support.
For example, we have created a mothers' roomin our
facility which allows lactating and expecting mothers
to use it during the day, if required.
Changing Mindsets
While support through policies is necessary, we
believe that inclusion is hugely impacted by mind-
sets. Conceptually, we all understand how diversity is
important but it was still important for us to amplify
the business case for enhancing gender diversity to get
buy in of the majority men in the organization. We also
used creative ways to acknowledge and celebrate the
contribution of women in the workforce through initia-
tives like an `Appreciation Week'--when our workforce
specifically acknowledges the contributions of women
employees for the work they do in India R&D (through
post-it messages stuck on public message boards).
To help make the dialogue on women inclusion
central to other dialogues, we have organized inter-
company panel discussions by D&I experts and senior
professionals from several industries on the topic of
Women in Leadership. So far we have had discussions
with topics ranging from the core differences in how
men and women approach their careers to effective
strategies that will allow women to claim and hold their
positions in male-dominated business environments,
without having to sacrifice their femininity.
We have also worked on helping employees become
aware of the conscious and unconscious biases
towards women through workshops and focus group
discussions.
Sensitization for Inclusion of PWDs
An area that we have actively addressed at Schneider
Electric India's R&D centre has been the inclusion of
persons with disabilities (PWDs). For instance, after
we moved to a new campus in Bengaluru, we realized
that our managers were not very aware of how the
campus supports or challenges our visually impaired
employees. In order to help sensitize our managers to
the needs of these employees, we organized a `Blind
Walk' where several senior leaders were taken to the
8th floor of the building blind-folded, and then asked
to make their way down to the Ground Floor cafeteria
unassisted. What would have taken them less than 10
minutesonaregulardaytookanexcruciating40minutes
for most of the leaders! At the end of the experience,
they were visibly moved by the challenges they had
encountered and could empathize deeply with their
visually impaired team members. This also led to some
decisions being made about enhancing accessibility in
the building. We did a similar exercise for the Global
HR Tools team to help them understand which tools are
accessible for visually impaired employees and which
ones need improvement.
While it is easy to become aware and empathetic
through an intense experience like the `Blind Walk',
being inclusive is a different matter altogether. To help
our managers dispel the myths around the differently
abled and their ability to contribute, we held a `Demo
Hour' for our people managers. This was a compact
60-minute session where a few of our differently abled
employees made short 10­15 minute demo presenta-
tions on their day-to-day work. Our visually impaired
employees, for instance, showed the managers how
they use screen reader software to navigate huge data-
bases at great speed--so much faster than `sighted'
individuals! Orthopedically impaired employees
showed how their disabilities are in no way an imped-
iment to their ability to deliver high quality work in
labs. They made it clear that an inclusive mindset and
environment is all they need in order to thrive and
contribute. Experiences such as this event have helped
our managers to open their minds greatly to the differ-
ently abled--to the extent that they are now asking for
such profiles when they have opportunities to hire.
344 COLLOQUIUM
Through all these sensitization efforts, our managers
are encouraged to build and sustain a diverse team.
Last year the gender diversity went up despite
limited flexibility to hire. Sixty per cent of our
new hires are women and we have identified two
engineering colleges exclusively for women where
we go to recruit women employees. As an example
of increasing diversity on the disability front, today
we have five differently abled employees successfully
integrated into the R&D centre.
PLANS FOR THE FUTURE
There are several challenges that we currently
encounter in building a diverse and inclusive
organization. As an industry, we do not easily attract
women. At times, the location of our facility is also
seen as a challenge. The hiring, being very specific
and need-based, sometimes does not allow us the
time required to hire candidates who will add to the
diversity in the organization.
However, despite the challenges, we are focused on
being seen as the best in creating a diverse and inclusive
organization.Drivingoureffortsthroughthecommittee,
having policies and practices that acknowledge and
support the differences, and continuing the dialogue
and action towards bettering the inclusion practices--
all reflect our commitment and sustained effort. At
present, we are in the process of formulating a part-time
working policy to support those who are unable to
work full-time for various reasons. We believe that if
we make such a policy available to all our employees,
we will be able to retain talented people who cannot
work full time.
We are also exploring programmes and policies for
`Second Innings' through which we will offer career
opportunities to women who took a break from work.
This programme intends to create full-time, part-time,
and advanced internship opportunities for women
who took extended breaks from their careers (e.g.,
due to child care, relocation, health concerns, etc.)
and are looking to get back to the workforce. We will
first be looking at identifying women in this group,
who have the competencies that we value/need at
Schneider Electric India R&D. Following this, we will
create opportunities for these individuals to `test-drive'
potential careers at SE India R&D in ways that allow
them to determine if they would be a good fit for the
company and vice versa.
What has specially been heartening for us so far is
that Diversity and Inclusion in SE is not perceived
as an `HR Issue' but supported as a core business
agenda providing real business results. With such a
focus in place, the India R&D team is committed to
becoming progressively more diverse and inclusive
as a workplace and fostering an environment where
differences are respected, encouraged, and celebrated.

Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide, Inc. is
the most global high-end hotel company in the
world with more than 1,200 properties in 100
countries. Our strength lies in ten distinct lifestyle
brands, an award-winning loyalty programme, and
2,40,000 talented associates worldwide. Starwood is
a fully integrated owner, operator, and franchisor of
hotels, resorts, and residences with the following inter-
nationally renowned brands: St. Regis®, The Luxury
Collection®, W®, Westin®, Le Méridien®, Sheraton®,
Four Points® by Sheraton, Aloft®, Element®, and the
recently introduced Tribute PortfolioTM.
At Starwood, we call our shared values `promises'.
These promises guide our everyday actions and ensure
a common understanding of what we can expect from
one another. They define the organizational culture by
enabling us to `Go the Extra Step by taking actions that
build lasting connections and loyalty, Play as a Team by
working globally and across all teams in the company,
VIKALPA · VOLUME 40 · ISSUE 3 · JULY-SEPTEMBER 2015 345
and Do the Right Thing by using good judgment,
respecting our communities, associates, owners, part-
ners, and the environment.
We are committed to creating a company that is a great
place to work and provides wonderful guest experiences,
great returns to stakeholders, and is growing, strong, and
stable. These values are imbibed by each associate who
joins Starwood all over the globe by further absorbing
the individual brand values of each of the 10 brands of
Starwood and making them a way of life.
DIVERSITY AT STARWOOD
Workforce diversity is a broad term embracing the
similarities and differences among associates from
all walks of life in terms of age, gender, background,
culture, race, orientation, and education. Inclusion, on
the other hand, is a state of being valued and supported.
It means leveraging on the diversity, regardless of the
differences. At Starwood, we are not simply accepting
diversity and inclusion. We are running towards it. We
are actually on a mission for inclusion. We seek out
people who are different, we strive for variety; and we
push diversity to the forefront. Not because we should.
But because it is vital for the success of our people
and our company. And because it matters. For an
organization that operates in the hospitality business
across the country and the world, we believe, our
diversity allows us to connect better with our customers
and the culture of the place. Given our efforts, we are
a very diverse workforce--be it on counts of gender,
regional, and now even differently abled people.
Fortunately, the hospitality industry as such is seen
as a great career opportunity by women and we have
always enjoyed gender diversity right from the start.
While across the organization we stand at 15 per cent
today, many departments, especially in the white-
collared jobs in our hotel would have a gender ratio
ranging from 40­60 per cent. In fact, at Starwood, you
would see women even in the non-traditional roles; for
instance, the kitchen of most hotels tends to have an
all-male staff but currently we have three women as
part of the kitchen team in The Westin Gurgaon, New
Delhi. Our Executive Committee comprises The Westin
Gurgaon of 50 per cent female representation which is
higher than most hotels in the region. Even though our
numbers look good for women, we do not take it for
granted that women will always seek employment in
our organization and drive it consciously.
This piece is written with specific reference to our
efforts to increase diversity at the Westin Gurgaon. We
follow the corporate mandate and specifically localize
our efforts to meet our realities in Gurgaon. Since the
last year, we have put in specific effort to reach out to
the differently abled. We go to job fairs which are held
for this group and regularly scout for talent. We also
tied up with an institute that works with the speech
and hearing impaired people and through them we
took on some trainees last year.
Factors Facilitating Diversity and Inclusion at
Starwood
To begin with, Starwood has a very flat structure where
people across the levels are involved in decision-
making. Managers have an open-door policy and
employees have easy access to share issues the they face
and come up with solutions that might help to resolve
the issues. Empowerment in decision-making creates
an environment of inclusion across the organization.
Second, performance is managed purely through
achievement of goals and this creates a transparent
environment that stresses on meritocracy irrespective
of what gender you are or which region you belong to.
The performance matrix also contributes to ensuring
that employees experience the organization as an equal
opportunity employer.
Third, is the top management support. The language
we speak around D&I related aspects is consistent
across the organization and this is possible only when
it is driven right from the CEO level. Sanjay Sharma,
Area General Manager India, Starwood Hotels and
Resorts, leads it by example. He has focused on
employing more women associates this past year,
not only as frontline staff but also in other grades
and levels. This is an attempt to correct the male-to-
female ratio in all levels. As a policy, we source at
least three resumes of women candidates for every
vacant position and interview at least one woman
before closing any position.
To further our D&I agenda, the senior leadership team
takes on specific measurable goals. For instance, in
terms of gender diversity, my goal as the HR head is
to increase it by an additional 3 per cent this year. We
also have specific targets for training and employing
persons with disability.
346 COLLOQUIUM
Policies and Practices Promoting Inclusion
With this focus, Starwood launched its Starwood Global
Female General Manager (GM) Initiative which serves
as a roadmap for increasing female GM representation
globally. The spotlight on increasing female GMs is a
result of an extensive study which sought to understand
the current state of women in the GM pipeline and the
GM roles within the organization. The study included
identifying the barriers to increasing the women GM
representation and implementing a globally agreed
strategy and action plan. The global study established
that Starwood had a balanced gender representation
at executive levels but also reflected an opportunity
to increase female representation at GM positions.
The same insights applied to Starwood Asia Pacific
(of which Starwood Gurgaon is a part)--Starwood
Asia Pacific employs over 74,500 associates, of which
42 per cent are women. Specifically, 38 per cent of the
executive team members in Asia are women but only 12
per cent are in GM positions.
Diversity training has been put in place which educates
employees on what might constitute harassment and
exclusion and encourages them to bring up issues when
they see anything that would be seen as discriminatory.
There is also sensitivity training in place which focuses
on having conversations around the changing of social
culture. Countering prejudices such as, only men
can stretch and need to do all the difficult tasks and
that women are not necessarily focused on long-term
growth, constitute an important part of creating an
organization ethos that supports inclusion.
We have also taken several measures to ensure the
safety of women employees. Women travelling back
late at night fill out a form and share the vehicle details
confirming that they are dropped by a company vehicle
and are accompanied by a security guard. They are also
provided with company accommodation. It is true that
women enjoy special benefits compared to their male
counterparts regarding safety, but we are open and not
apologetic about it.
Also recognizing the change women experience around
child birth, we are very proactive in extending the right
kind of support to ensure that we are able to retain
them during and after maternity. For instance, we give
them an option to change their function, or move on
to flexible timings. The impact is seen in the fact that
100 per cent of our women employees who have taken
maternity breaks have come back to the organization.
We have provided hearing and speech impaired asso-
ciates with special badges to ensure their comfort-
able movement in guest areas. One of the associates is
working in our Associate Cooperative Store, i.e., a store
where associates can purchase groceries at discounted
rates. She uses rate charts to share the prices of items
along with a white board which helps her communi-
cate easily with others. Another associate working in
the pastry shop offers guests the menu card which
eases his stress to lip read to decipher the guest's order.
To support cultural diversity, Star Finder, our online
interface, helps candidates across the globe to explore
opportunities with any Starwood hotel in the world.
This helps us in getting people from different regions
and also creates bonding across the team members.
Addressing Potential Issues Case by Case
While there may be many policies, procedures,
and training to support D&I, ultimately, how it is
experienced across the organization boils down to
individual acts. Therefore as a culture, we never treat
any incident as a minor one. We promptly reach out
to specific employees to address issues that may not
be good for our culture--say the use of inappropriate
language. In one instance, one of the vendors sent a cab
for a woman employee almost 45 minutes after it was
scheduled to arrive. While this may be a one-off incident
and there were no dire consequences associated with it,
we made it a point to take up this issue with the vendor
to send a signal to our associates that we cared for
them. Being in the hospitality business, sometimes our
front office may have to deal with offensive behaviour
of the customers. There have been incidents in the past
where a customer behaving inappropriately with an
employee was asked to leave the hotel premises and
his club membership was recalled. We have regular
conversation with managers to take up any issue that
impacts their respective associates irrespective of how
frequent or large the incident is.
Tracking D&I
Besides having clear targets that support our D&I
goals, we also track it on a monthly and quarterly basis.
We send information regarding gender diversity and
PWDs to the regional office on a regular basis. This
enables us to review progress of inclusion initiatives.
The tracking process helps us assess where we stand in
comparison to other hotels. This not only is an effective
VIKALPA · VOLUME 40 · ISSUE 3 · JULY-SEPTEMBER 2015 347
tool for benchmarking but also provides us insights
into best practices at these hotels. Year on year, we have
been able to increase these numbers and comparing
ratios to previous quarters and years certainly gives
us the motivation and the understanding that we are
moving in the right direction.
Successful Practices to Promote Inclusion
The programme that we launched in 2014 to hire the
differently abled people has been very successful. We
tied up with Sarthak, an institute that works with the
speech and hearing impaired population, and through
them we hired our first batch of five students in
August 2014. This group was put through a rigorous
orientation session and was given projects to do in
different departments before we could find the right
fit. They were also assigned mentors in each of their
departments. To ensure inclusion into the work group,
many of our employees went through training to learn
sign language. In fact, all the mentors had to learn it
because integration of the trainees was driven by the
mentors and not so much by the HR team. And now
in our meetings and at times even in our town halls, it
is very heartening to see people using sign language
not only when they communicate with these trainees
but also with others in the meeting so that the trainees
follow the entire communication. At present we have
four out of the five associates working with us from
Sarthak, we intend to coach them and help them hone
their skills to grow within Starwood. Furthermore, we
plan to incorporate hiring more PWDs in future.
Starwood India properties are constantly seeking
new opportunities to integrate people who have been
ignored by mainstream by tying up with organizations
in order to increase workplace diversity. For instance,
recently, we have tied up with some NGOs working
with survivors of human trafficking and have taken
trainees from that pool. Such partnerships are mutually
beneficial as they not only utilize our resources to
educate and train the less privileged for employment
in our properties but also help us gain motivated and
committed associates.
Ms. Ritu Singh Verma, Regional Director, Human
Resources, South Asia, Starwood Hotels and Resorts
India Pvt Ltd., encourages HR leaders in the region
to look for new ideas and strategies to attract,
develop, and retain lady associates. This year, she
has introduced outsourcing of exit interviews of lady
associates who resign and leave. This would give a
neutral perspective and insight into the experiences
of lady associates at Starwood and help us identify
areas for improvement.
CHALLENGES IN OUR JOURNEY
Sensitivity towards inclusion boils down to the
individual acts of managers. The thought process of the
associates and the acceptance of change is essential for
the success of diversity initiatives. It is a challenge to
overcome the mental blocks of the associates who do
not like any change in the makeup of the workforce
and tend to form cliques or groups to resist any such
move. Also, difficulty in communication can pose a
challenge owing to the presence of myriad cultures
and languages spoken. We believe that if we do not
address such difficulties proactively it may easily lead
to confusion and disintegration in the group.
Today, our managers show different levels of focus on
D&I. Where the managers invest highly on the D&I
agendaitgetsclearlyreflectedatthegrouplevel.Ensuring
a sustained focus across the organization is going to come
from building ownership with each manager.
THE WAY FORWARD
One question that I frequently raise with respect
to the differently abled is the career growth we can
offer them. Currently, we are geared to take them as
individual contributors. But as they grow within the
organization, to what extent we are training them
to take on larger people responsibilities and interact
freely and confidently with others is something that
still needs to be worked out.
Diversity and inclusion is the need of the hour. As
HR leaders, we need to drive this, for the company
and its stakeholders can reach their full potential only
when they leverage on diversity. As a global company,
Starwood represents ten diverse brands in hundreds
of diverse markets. We cannot bring an authentic
global experience to our guests if our thoughts, ideas,
and beliefs come from one small corner of the world.
Our success will thrive from the infinite number of
differences that make each one of us! Be it our life
experiences, our career journey, or our educational
learnings, our collaborative culture is what will keep us
on top. As we see it, there is no way but to traverse the
path of including differences.

DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION JOURNEY
At InterGlobe, the promoters have always been
committed to the belief that having an inclusion agenda
is a key business enabler. In the initial years, our
senior leadership across group companies underwent
a diversity and inclusion programme. Inputs from
that workshop helped us in articulating our D&I
philosophy. We formed the group level and business
level D&I councils whose key responsibility was the
identification of focus areas based on 3Cs (common
sense, consensus, and co-creation). Policies supporting
an inclusive culture were introduced and programmes
around specific causes such as health and wellness,
women's safety, etc. were organized. We now aim to
touch employees' lives though equality, enablement,
and empowerment.
BUILDING A DIVERSE WORKFORCE
Diversity and Inclusion are fundamental to our culture
and core values, fostering an innovative, collaborative,
and high energy work environment. Our wide range
of D&I efforts are focussed around the following areas:
Gender Diversity
InterGlobe has a relatively young workforce with 44
per cent of the women employees between the age
group of 20­35 years, characterized with aspirations
to grow at a rapid pace and the ability to be
immensely multi-faceted in their skills and interests.
Over the last decade the company has experienced
a silent revolution with higher numbers of younger
employees having moved to managerial roles and
significantly more women at the shop floor. We have
13 per cent of the women in leadership roles, 15 per
cent in managerial roles, and 22 per cent in supervisory
roles. The number of women in engineering hangar
roles has also increased from 0 to 16 in just one year
during 2013­14. The business leaders recognize the
benefits of maintaining healthy gender diversity in
the workplace. Our hiring focus through various
mediums--employee referrals, internal job postings,
VIKALPA · VOLUME 40 · ISSUE 3 · JULY-SEPTEMBER 2015 349
campus hiring, social media, and search firms--has
been on gender balanced workforce. The vendors are
also mandated to have 50 per cent of the housekeeping
staff and chauffeurs as women. In our airline business,
women are hired not only as cabin crew, but also as
pilots--14.7 per cent of our pilots are women and this
number has been increasing every year.
Breaking Traditions
Engineering hangars are a fully 24×7 environment
where technicians and engineers are working in shifts
to do major aircraft maintenance for IndiGo. They
are sited at an isolated location and are not publicly
accessible. This had traditionally been a male bastion.
Until one day, when the President while interviewing
a lady with engineering degree for another position
at the airport, asked her as to why she was not being
interviewed for the relevant position in the engineering
hangar, and was surprised to hear that the reason was,
`There were no ladies toilets in the hangar'. Needless
to say, a woman's washroom was constructed and now
we are very proud to have 16 women at the engineering
hangar. Appropriate infrastructure like setting up of
washrooms and changing room facilities has enabled
us to achieve this unconventional hiring initiative.
Similarly, we had few women employees at the ramp--
the place where the aircraft is parked. The reason
being, the job required special types of shoes--ramp
shoes to be worn. However, the manufacturer in India
only made men's shoes. We identified a vendor who
could make shoes for women and we now have women
working at the ramp.
Even in our hotel development business where construc-
tion is the core function, maintaining a good gender mix
is a challenge. To address this, we mapped jobs which
were women-friendly and where getting qualified
women engineers at construction sites were not diffi-
cult. This journey included sensitizing project managers
about work environment, hygiene factors, managing
aspirations of women, creating office space at sites which
included building separate washrooms for women, and
providing medical facility to handle any emergency.
Extending this focus externally, the technology business
has initiated an exhaustive short-term, market-
oriented, and placement-linked employability skills
training programme with 250 under-privileged young
girls above 18 years of age.
Cultural Diversity
Over the last decade, the InterGlobe group has
substantially grown. We have moved from being an
Indian organization to a diversified conglomerate
working from more than 20 countries.All the InterGlobe
businesses have offices across locations in India and
abroad. There is, hence, a culturally and linguistically
diverse workforce, with varying requirements. To
support this, all critical communication that takes place
on a group level, like the Code of Conduct, is made
available in multiple languages that our employees are
comfortable with.
To ensure culture diversity in our technology business,
a global magazine named Jeepney is published every
year. The magazine not only involves the sharing of
practices, experiences, and leadership connects but also
the collaboration between different geographies. We
also launched a `No Sir No Ma'am' campaign aimed
at addressing everyone with their first name to bring
equality and openness in our work culture.
Generational Diversity
Besides the rich gender and cultural diversity, we also
have employees belonging to different generations,
which is now growing as an area of diversity and
inclusion that needs to be addressed. In line with the
demographic profile of the country, in InterGlobe as
well, the highest number of employees is below the
age group of 30 years. Furthermore, the other groups
of employees that are significant in number are in
their late adulthood, in the bracket of 55 years and
over. We are making attempts to ensure that these two
groups can energetically work together. From personal
aspirations to health and wellness needs, we cater to
the work-life balance needs of different generations to
create supportive workplace environment that values
and trusts employees.
Ensuring Inclusion in a Diverse Workforce
We realize that to create an organization with a
healthy gender mix requires us to ensure women
receive necessary support through transitions in
their personal lives. We have taken several such steps
towards making women employees comfortable in
the workplace. A liberal maternity leave policy has
helped women employees plan their family along
with a great career. Women have the option of clubbing
350 COLLOQUIUM
their available leave with their three-month maternity
leave and extending their time away from work. They
can also avail of the option to work from home for
additional two months which helps in retention. For
some women who require more flexibility, we are
open to contractual agreements. Post their return,
they are offered a flexi-time option. Other facilities
like nursing rooms, day care facility, and security
guards accompanying in official transportation are
provided to women employees. To meet the basic
hygiene need of diverse population, in our IT and
BPO business we have introduced feminine vending
machine in the ladies washroom.
Women can avail `Adoption Leave' of three months if
they are adopting a baby between the age of 0-3 months
and for one month when adopting a baby older than
three months. Women pilots are rostered in a manner
that they are not required to work on weekends.
Furthermore, opportunities for women are created
across locations, when they may be required to relocate
due to personal reasons.
All the middle and hiring managers in the
technology business have undergone workshops on
understanding various nuances of gender biases and
prejudices. We used theatre-based methodology to
deliver this key message. To engage with such diverse
workforce, we celebrate Women's Day, Mother's Day,
Father's Day and similar such days in all businesses.
All our businesses have women network forums
which enable women employees to connect with
each other and also provide them a platform to
share success stories and discuss issues of common
interests, etc.
Sustaining Diversity and Inclusion
Every business at InterGlobe has a formal Diversity
Council, comprising a Business Head, an HR head, and
a Legal Head. This Council has been created to ensure
diverse workforce and build an inclusive environment.
It also addresses issues on harassment--verbal, mental
or sexual in nature and discrimination that employees
may raise. The focus of the organization towards
supporting gender diversity can be seen through
several aspects of employees' responses to various
aspects around safety, work-life balance, and diversity
of thought gathered during annual Engagement
Surveys. The scores as given by employees have risen
over the last year (Table 1).
Table 1: Results of Engagement Survey
2013 2014
Work-life Balance 73% 80%
Safety 84% 91%
Diversity of thought 73% 79%
Note: * Top 2 Box score in the AoN Hewitt Employee Engagement
Survey.
Countering Challenges in Our D&I Journey
InterGlobe has substantially grown over the last
decade. Employees join the organization from
differing geographies, sections of society, etc. and
the level of sensitivity towards inclusion varies
with every individual. Thus, ingraining inclusion in
every employee's mind needs tremendous effort. It
requires employees to unlearn multiple stereotypes
and notions and re-learn how to adopt diversity and
inclusion. One of the focus areas identified for the
group companies is creating an impactful diversity
and inclusion training that is not restricted to top
level leaders and managers, but is applicable across
all levels.
Lastly, there are also external challenges. The skewed
gender mix is not only restricted to workplaces, but
starts much earlier. In certain streams in the graduate
and post-graduate programmes, women enrolment is
still low. This challenge needs to be addressed, because
of its overall impact on the recruitment scenario.
THE WAY AHEAD
InterGlobe has done well to ensure a healthy gender
and regional diversity. However, this is not enough.
There is still a large section of potential employees in
the society that remains untapped. The company is
exploring the idea of engaging employees who may be
differently abled and from LGBT communities.
Having these employees on board would not only allow
access to vast talent available but also help in creating
an overall culture of `care' and `mutual respect'.
The second area being looked at is skill development
for high potential women managers. The requirement
for these women has increased peer level interactions
that go beyond mere training programmes and allow
for interaction with best practices in other workplaces
VIKALPA · VOLUME 40 · ISSUE 3 · JULY-SEPTEMBER 2015 351
as well, that may not be limited to the travel industry.
Creating an exchange programme, where talent could
undertake short-term assignments, or undertake a
learning journey under the tutelage of senior women
leaders, is definitely an intervention the group would
like to introduce and take forward.

Insights and Lessons from Organizations supporting the
journey in workplaces
The idea of belonging and membership, being part of a
community, is a basic human need. It's one of the principles
of our democratic society. We all have the same needs, we
want to be loved, we want to have friends, we want to
feel that we are making a contribution in our families, in
our communities.... We learn about understanding what
someone's interests and point of view are by interacting
with them. To include everyone is to open up those
possibilities for learning and appreciating our humanity.
­Dr. Joseph Petner, Educator
In a recent research study that we conducted across
21 organizations ranging from small to medium and
across industries, when asked to respond to current
diversity concerns, merely 2 per cent of the sample
spoke of promoting diversity with respect to sexual
orientation. In most cases, it was never referred to and
when specifically asked by the researchers, responses
bordered around the `Don't ask­Don't tell' rule.
Employers and managers are quick to point out that
they do not discriminate on the basis of `personal'
choices. This is far from the truth from the perspective
of the LGBT working in organizations. A study done
by Mingle, the first of its kind in India, covering 455
employees who were either homosexual or bisexual63,
reported that when asked about facing discrimination
from managers or company authorities because of their
sexual orientation, 11 per cent responded as `Often' and
9 per cent responded as `Sometimes'. Data from a survey
by Human Rights Campaign Foundation to study the
63 Mingle (2012). Annual LGBT Workplace Diversity and Inclusion
Survey, 2011­12. Retrieved from http://mingle.org.in/pdf/
LGBT-Workplace-Survey-2012-MINGLE.pdf
experiences of the LGBT community in America64 also
revealed that one in four employees reported staying in a
job specifically because the environment was inclusive, 9
per cent quit because the environment was not accepting,
35 per cent felt compelled to lie about their personal lives
at work; and a third felt distracted from the job at hand
due to negative workplace environments.
It is also widely argued that one's sexual orientation
is personal and does not belong to the workplace.
However, if one reflects on workplace conversations--
especially the ones that get people to form bonds and
feel truly engaged with one another--many of them are
in the realm of revealing to our co-workers who we are
as people. Weekend plans, significant life events, light
banter, and gossip are all such an ingrained part of our
interactions that it is very easy to take it for granted
for those whom the conversations are about their
realities. When asked, over 80 per cent of non-LGBT
workers report that conversations about social lives
and relationships come up weekly and often daily.
For any member of a work team to not fully engage
in such conversations, either because they choose
to remain closeted or the sense that it makes others
uncomfortable, or because they feel judged, can have a
painful, isolating impact. The study by Mingle pointed
that of the employees who chose to remain closeted,
17 per cent felt it had a direct impact on their
productivity and 33 per cent felt there was an indirect
impact. Not feeling free to talk about themselves not
only has an isolating effect but also creates a feeling
of their career being stalled.65 The sharing of all parts

of self can foster trust and rapport and is an essential
part of human interactions. Thus it can be argued that
lack of openness around issues of inclusion of the LGBT
community has an impact on productivity, retention,
and employee engagement. In the competitive scenario
faced by all organizations, is it really advisable to allow
conditions that lead to a decrease in productivity?
Acompelling reason for Indian organizations to consider
inclusion of the LGBT community is that despite there
being no legal framework within the country and the
debate and outcry around Section 377, we are still being
evaluated on global principles of diversity. The Human
Rights Campaign Foundation's survey points out that
while 61 per cent of the Fortune 500 US based companies
had sexual orientation in their non-discrimination policy
in 2002, the number is up to 91 per cent as on 2014.
The other factor is the changing face of the workforce.
Millennials are increasingly becoming a large
percentage of the employees and age levels are going
down in Indian organizations. The millennials value
diversity and are much more open about engaging in
conversations around gender equality and sexuality.66
It would be important to point out to a recent trend of
visible investments being made by Indian companies
in reaching out to the LGBT consumers. The idea of
attracting `pink money' is seen clearly in the more recent
marketing efforts. According to a report by Forbes India,
with help from Out Now Consulting (a marketing
consultancy specializing in this sector)67, the percentage
of Indian adult population that is LGBT amounts to 30
million people with annual earnings being close to `1.5
lakh crore. This articles notes that organizations today are
seeing the benefit of being seen as LGBT friendly, given
the greater disposable income of this group.

help prepare the foundation and culture to promote
the inclusion of the LGBT community. We provide a
summary to help organizations wanting to include
LGBT in their workforce.
1. Equal opportunity policies: Include equal
opportunity for all regardless of sexual orientation
and gender identity or expression and procedures
to prohibit discrimination or harassment based on
the same.
2. Diversity training: Have specific reference to LGBT
issues.
3. Diversity structure: Have at least an executive
sponsor for LGBT issues and also establish a
network when there is enough interest.
4. Benefits: Ensure that benefits to employees also
cover the same-sex partners regardless of the
employee's marital status, sexual orientation,
gender expression, or gender identity.
5. Corporate culture: Have open communication
through posters, emails, intranet, and meetings to
portray how the company supports and values its
LGBT workforce.
6. Market positioning: Engage in respectful and
appropriate marketing to the LGBT community and
use them as protagonists for marketing in India.
7. Monitoring: Keep a pulse on recruitment, career
development, and employee engagement with
respect to LGBT employees who choose to self-
identify. Also, track the complaints or grievances
involving LGBT employees
8. Community and advocacy: Be a visible role model
for LGBT workplace equality by sharing best
practices and also engaging in external LGBT-
specific efforts (marketing or advertising, non-profit
group, or public support for legal LGBT equality).
Shifts Seen in the Corporate Sector
Global business leaders must accept all the
complications and challenging issues that surface if
they are authentic with their efforts to build a truly
inclusive work environment. You cannot rank someone
else's inclusion...you cannot say gender is critical,
culture is critical but LGBT... complicated so let's put
it aside. As business leaders you are either in the game
of true inclusion or not...you are in 100% or not...there
is no middle ground'.

In 2012, Forbes magazine reported that the HR
departments of 11 top multinationals-- including
Goldman Sachs, the Royal Bank of Scotland, Cisco,
Dell, Novell, General Electric, and Microsoft--came
together at the Bengaluru campus of IBM to share best
practices for fostering a culture of LGBT inclusion in
their organizations70. Some of the positive initiatives
that organizations have undertaken to promote LGBT
Inclusion are presented below in the hope to provide
pointers to employers undertaking this journey.
Having LGBT Employee Resource Groups (ERGs)
In a society that is extremely queasy when talking of
sexuality, the ERGs play a critical role in creating a
supporting environment for the LGBT community.
In the Mingle survey, 84 per cent of the respondents
found ERGs as being very helpful. Where these groups
do not exist, 86 per cent felt the need for one. One of
the successful ERGs has been the one at IBM India.
The organization has The Employee Alliance for Gay,
Lesbian, Bisexual and Transgender Empowerment at
IBM (EAGLE at IBM), which is committed to promoting
a safe and open working environment for all employees,
regardless of sexual orientation, gender identity, or
gender expression71. The organization initiated a reverse
mentoring project where members of EAGLE paired
up with senior employees to discuss issues ranging
from alternative sexuality, queer pride events to career
advancement. According to KalpanaVeeraraghavan,
the Workforce Diversity Manager in IBM India,72
The project sensitizes workforce on inclusiveness of sexual
inclinations.Theuniquegay-straightcollaborationisaimed
at building awareness about LGBTs among employees,
who cannot easily correlate with people not conforming to
hetero-normative behaviour. The conversations between
mentors and mentees help segue naturally to other subjects
like discussing their career paths.

creating a safe and respectful work environment
for employees from the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and
transgender (LGBT) community. There are several
awareness programmes and exclusive events that are
held to foster inclusion.73
Having an ALLY Network
Goldman Sachs launched its MD Ally Strategy in Asia
Pacific in 2010. From 100 members in 2010, the number
has grown to more than 300 today.74 The goal was to
communicate the support of the senior members to
ensure that LGBT employees succeed in their chosen
paths. A selected group of managing directors across
the organization who pledged their support to the
LGBT Network were listed in Goldman Sachs' LGBT
Network website. Training materials were designed
to help these managing directors understand the
role of an MD Ally, as well as equip them with the
necessary knowledge and skills to advocate a work
environment that respects, welcomes and supports
LGBT professionals.
Giving Visibility to LGBT Inclusion in the Equal
Opportunity Policy
Several organizations have in the last four years
modified their policies to reflect their commitment
to LGBT rights. For instance a short excerpt of British
Council's equal opportunity statement reads: `Our
Equal Opportunity Policy commits us to ensuring that
there is no unjustified discrimination in the recruitment,
retention, training and development of staff on the basis
of age, disability, gender including transgender, HIV/
AIDS status, marital status including civil partnerships,
pregnancy and maternity, political opinion, race/
ethnicity, religion and belief, sexual orientation, socio-
economic background, spent convictions, trade union
activity or membership, work pattern and on the basis of
having or not having dependents or any other irrelevant
grounds.'75 Similarly, given Accenture's Meritocracy
Policy which is based on sexual and gender orientation,

Accenture India also follows its global policy towards
LGBT professionals. HR policy of CITI bank India has a
provision to protect rights of LGBT group.76
Promoting Awareness
The LGBT Network and Office of Global Leadership
and Diversity in collaboration with Goldman Sachs
University, organizes numerous LGBT related events
throughout the year, giving employees plenty of
opportunities to learn about LGBT issues. The network
has its own website and a newsletter which it uses to
share upcoming events and ways that employees can
create a more inclusive workplace for LGBT employees.
Humsafar trust has in the past staged a one act play
MadhavBagh which shows a mother coming to terms
with her child's sexuality. The play has been used as
a fulcrum in the corporates (Goldman Sachs, Infosys,
and Google) to invite a dialogue amongst people
in the audience. Given that the audience is a mix of
people who are from the sexual minority community
and other people who are interested in the subject, the
dialogue helps break the ice to bring up taboo issues
which usually don't get discussed at the workplace.
Public Support
Beyond communicating its commitment to LGBT
inclusion internally, another avenue for organizations is
through active participation in public forums held for and
by the LGBT community. For instance, through Gayglers
(theemployeeresourcegroupofLGBTGooglersandtheir
allies), employees of Google from all over India travelled
to join the Pride March in Bengaluru in November
2012.77 Another example is the work done by the Godrej
group that hosts Kashish, an LGBT film festival that is
also supported by other corporates such as Barclays and
IBM. Godrej more recently hosted a national conference
by Mission for Indian Gay and Lesbian Empowerment

IN CONCLUSION
There have been some winds of positive change for
the transgender community in the recent past in
India. Be it the appointment of the first transgender
college principal in a women's university in Kolkata,
or having a transgender anchoring a daily television
news, and a transgender mayor in Chhattisgarh.
The gay, lesbian and bisexual community is yet to
celebrate such public victories in a society that treats
homosexuality as being immoral and illegal. With
the cloak of silence that has covered the issues for a
long time slowly falling, it's time for corporate India
to actively address LGBT inclusion. In doing so, we
would not be addressing issues merely around sexual
orientation but about something as fundamental as
one's identity. There is support available from NGOs
focusing on LGBT rights--HumsafarTrust in Mumbai
and SwabhavaTrust in Bengaluru to name a few.
There are lessons to be learned from organizations
who are the forerunners in this journey.
Inclusion had been a front-burner agenda in corporate
India perhaps only in the past decade. While gender
diversity has been treated as the low-hanging fruit in
this journey, advocates of diversity and inclusion are
slowly admitting that inclusion can never happen if
one is focused on labels of gender, race, region, and
abilities. To be truly inclusive, one has to embrace
it in its true spirit--to be respectful and accepting of
the more invisible indicators of diversity. In being
willing to break the silence around homosexuality
and extending visible support and acceptance of the
LGBT community, perhaps corporate India can pave
the way to create a more inclusive world, a world in
which the LGBT community lives, as expressed in the
words of the great poet and philosopher Rabindranath
Tagore, `Where the mind is without fear and the head is
held high'.

Challenging the Real Barriers: Inclusion of Persons with
Disabilities
Neharika Vohra Vijayalakshmi Chari
Professor Independent Coach and Story-teller
Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad Bengaluru
e-mail: neharika@iimahd.ernet.in e-mail: vijji.chari@gmail.com
The World Report on Disability, jointly published
by the WHO and the World Bank, suggests that
more than a billion people in the world today
experience disability.79 It argues that persons with
disabilities are capable of productive employment
with the support of aids and yet their employment rate
is 60 per cent lower, on an average, than the general
non-disabled population.
In India, no data on disability was collected until 2001
as part of the 10-year census.80 In the 2011 census, the
classification of disabilities was introduced to collect
specific data on the type of disabilities. However, the
census reveals underreporting of PWDs. In 2011 census
data, only 2.1 per cent of the population is reported
as PWD compared to the global estimates of 10­15
per cent. The majority (75 per cent) of those reported
as PWD resided in rural areas. Furthermore, out of
70 million people that are estimated to be living with
disability in India, only 1,00,000 have found jobs.81
At the practice level, only very few organizations in
India have recognized the need to tap into the vast
resource pool of PWDs. Three of the six organizations
representedinthiscolloquiumhaveputeffortinlooking
at the reality and addressing the needs of differently-
abled people in their inclusion agenda. However,
several organizations still have concerns which prevent
them from hiring people with disabilities. The concerns
range from lack of awareness (of what constitutes

disability), to conscious and unconscious biases
around the perceived capability of PWDs, and practical
apprehensions on the effort and investment required to
make workplaces disabled-friendly.
The National Centre for the Promotion of Employment
for Disabled People (NCPEDP)82 conducted a survey
of `top 100 multinational companies' in India in 1999
and found that the rate of employment of persons with
disabilities in the private sector was a mere 0.28 per
cent, 0.05 per cent in multinational companies, and only
0.58 per cent in the top 10 IT companies in the country.
A similar study conducted by NCPEDP in 2009 shows
that there has been a marginal increase since then. In
the public sector, it averages between 1 to 2 per cent
and in the private sector between 0.5 to 1 per cent. On
an average, for all types of disabilities (which includes
visual, hearing, locomotor, and mental disabilities),
73.6 per cent of the population is out of the labour force
(Shenoy, 2011).83 Many organizations in India Inc. have
started to address employment of PWDs under the aegis
of CSR initiatives, affirmative action, etc. There is also a
marked increase in awareness to create inclusive spaces
for the differently-abled population in educational
institutions, hospitality industry, and hospitals. IT
and ITES organizations too have made some headway
in this area. In most progressive organizations hiring
PWDs, commitment from the senior management,
exhaustive sensitization and messaging, and ensuring
accessibility are the common threads contributing to
the success of the efforts.84

356 COLLOQUIUM
A BUSINESS CASE FOR HIRING PWDS
The exclusion of PWDs from work force leads to an
estimated $1.37 to $194 trillion worth of annual loss in
GDP.85 With the number of PWDs in India estimated
to be at 70 million, it is a significantly large `minority'
group seeking employment.
In the last decade, there has been a change in the legal
scenario, nationally and internationally, for promotion
of equal opportunities for persons with disabilities.
In India, the applicable legislation is the Persons with
Disabilities (Equal opportunities, Protection of Rights,
Full Participation) Act, 1995.86 According to the PWD
Act, 3 per cent of all categories of jobs in the government
sector are reserved for PWDs, and it provides
employment incentives for public and private sector
companies that have at least 5 per cent of their workforce
comprising persons with disabilities. Employment
reservation in the government sector is applicable for
only three types of disabilities--locomotive, hearing,
and visual impairments. Until two decades ago, the
reservation was only for the C and D (support staff)
categories of jobs. It was only in 1995 that reservations
were extended to category A and B (officer level) jobs.
Under programmes like MGNREGA (Specific Needs
of Special Categories under MGNREGA, 2010),87
the guidelines specify that suitable work should be
provided for persons with disabilities, but in practice
there is limited understanding about what kinds of
jobs they can do and what support can be provided
to enhance the opportunities for the disabled. In the
Rights of Persons with Disabilities Bill (RPDB) 2014, a
reservation of 6 per cent in all jobs has been proposed.
It may thus be argued that it makes eminent business
sense to hire PWDs because it complies with the law
of the land and the government rewards businesses for
doing so.
Beyond the legal considerations, there have been
extensive surveys in the West in the last decade on
tracking organizational impact of hiring PWDs on

productivity, work culture and workforce morale. Data
fromtheseresearchstudiesindicateslesserabsenteeism,
higher productivity, and better retention of employees
with disability. An AIF survey88 done across 12
employers across industries that maintained a positive
track record with respect to hiring and retaining PWDs
revealed several business benefits such as:
· Higher customer footfall in retail outlets
· Higher level of motivation among other peers
· Better business results
· Negligible attrition rates.
Besides implications on employment, the social circles
of PWDs, which includes families and friends, also
constitutes a significantly large consumer base for
organizations. Even at the macro level, optimizing all
human resources at national level is crucial for overall
productivity as a nation.
The road towards hiring and integrating PWD is paved
with manifold challenges.
CHALLENGES AT THE GROUND LEVEL IN
HIRING PWD
As in the case of inclusion efforts with respect to any of
the `minority groups', individual biases pose the biggest
road block when it comes to hiring PWDs. Paternalistic
attitudes of managers and custodians of mainstream
organizations influence decisions of what work the
people can do and how they can perform to the best of
their ability, and often is not based on a discussion with
the PWDs. Rama Chari of DEOC (Diversity and Equal
Opportunity Centre), shares, `At times even the NGOs
working with PWDs along with the corporates believe
that PWDs are best suited to do desk jobs and can at
best become data operators. The prevailing mindset
is that the differently-abled people will not be able to
"cope" with the environment or the job description'.
The second challenge is that many organizations
take on the agenda of hiring PWDs as a feel-good or
charity. In fact many organizations hire PWDs as part
of fulfilling their CSR agenda. Organizations follow a
piecemeal approach and hire only to meet some internal
targets and do not look at the inclusion of PWD in letter
and spirit. Therefore, the cause of integrating PWD

gets diluted with spurts of action and lacks long-term
sustained changes in the work structure and culture.
Socially, people without disabilities also tend to
rationalize feelings of pity towards those with disabilities
by reducing contact and distancing themselves, both
physically and emotionally, from the concerned
individuals to avoid discomfort. This also makes
members of the PWD feel uncomfortable and their
discomfort creates a downward spiral in building long-
last relationships. Lack of education about PWD and
openness towards differences contribute to this dynamic.
Inaccessibility is another barrier when it comes to
inclusion of PWDs in the workplace. Changes in
the physical infrastructure come with significant
repercussions in terms of cost and effort. A group of
architects and social work professionals working out of
Ahmedabad-run detailed disability audits of building
and workplaces for nominal charges.89 Geeta Sharma,
working in Unnati, Ahmedabad and part of the group
shares her experience: `Compared to the situation 10
years ago, organizations are now a little more open to
having accessibility audits done to assess their built
environments; however, since most people still continue
to think that accessible designs are required only for
persons with disabilities who are not so visible in public
spaces, they do not feel motivated enough to make
modifications even if they get an access audit done.
The reality is that use of accessible features benefits
more than 60 per cent of the population, including
senior citizens, children, persons with temporary
disabilities, persons carrying luggage and many more'.
Transport is another barrier--it is either not provided
by the organization or the public transport and private
vehicles are not disabled-friendly.
ADDRESSING THE CHALLENGES
A consistent theme in the literature on accommodating
persons with disabilities is that of rehabilitation and
reasonable accommodation.90 The rehabilitation
literature looks at the factors affecting the inclusion of
employees with disabilities in the work environment.

Retrieved 12 May 2015 from http://askjan.org/media/lowcos-
thighimpact.html
Failure to provide the needed accommodation for
a qualified individual can be legally viewed as
discrimination. Reasonable accommodation may
include providing assistance or making such changes
in the job or workplace environment that will enable
the person/employee to perform his/her role. This
may include making physical alterations like providing
for an accessible toilet, providing reading software
for persons with visual impairment or providing for
materials in large print for persons with low vision,
and constructing a ramp or lowering a desktop to
accommodate a person using a wheelchair.91
For ensuring non-discrimination and easy assimilation
of differently abled work force, job descriptions
could have a more thorough skill mapping with all
the job requirements. This gives the applicant a clear
picture and helps them assess their capacity to take
on the job instead of the organization taking a biased,
ill-informed view of the same. Also an in-depth
sensitization programme goes a long way in promoting
dialogue and dispelling myths around disabilities.
Collaborating with capacity-building organizations can
help corporates bring in the right kind of sensitization
training to promote its inclusion efforts.
Having a more holistic view of accessibility is another
area that needs to be addressed. A report prepared by
DEOC (Diversity and Equal Opportunity Centre) on
behalf of CII,92 after collating the critical aspects, has
offered the following suggestions for organizations:
· Put in place an overarching equal opportunity
policy
· Have a look at the accessibility of all physical
facilities--from the parking lot, office spaces,
entrances, stairways and elevators to the cafeteria
and washroom facilities
· Arrange for accessible transport to reach the
workplace and move around in the office premises
· Assess the suitability of furniture, fixtures and
flooring for suitability for PWDs
· Ensure all communication (for instance using
e-formats, audio formats, sign language, braille,
subtitling films, etc.) is converted into formats that
are accessible by PWDs

· Evaluate feasibility of safety and emergency
evacuation processes for PWDs. Also conduct drills
to train PWDs
· Make available the assistive technology when
possible (accessing the website, computers, software
programmes)
· Conduct regular access audits to identify issues that
may inhibit PWDs from full participation.
The above suggestions are in conformity with the
United Nations Convention of Rights with Disabilities.93
In addition to hiring PWDs, organizations can actively
engage in proactively training and developing their
talent. Research also shows that this is a winning
strategy for both groups. Such projects can be taken
in conjunction with NGOs and educational institutes
working with PWDs. The training can be a multipronged
approach that looks at developing technical and social
skills among the disabled. For instance, Blind People's
Association, Ahmedabad, has started an employment
cell to provide employment across disabilities, with a
specific focus on women with disabilities and attempts
to create employment opportunities for employment and
self-employment in public and private sectors. Similarly
ADAPT (Abled, Disabled, All People Together, earlier
called Spastics Society of India) provides education and
trainingtopromoteemployment,entrepreneurshipskills,
and income generation for persons with disabilities.
Supporting these programmes with inputs on both
technical and social skills can create effective bridges
between the PWD community and employers.
In addition to the efforts that have been highlighted in
the organizational stories in this colloquium, we would
also like to highlight some of the impactful work done
for inclusion of the PWDs in other Indian organizations.

in 2015, it is the market leader in Western India as
the seller of its products to large companies such as
Honda, Tata's, and Siemens. Half of the workforce
at Microsign is comprised of PWD, including deaf
and dumb, mentally challenged, and orthopedically
challenged. Microsign's inclusion efforts are clearly
reflected in:
· Part of the mission and vision statement: Its business
goals are quality, precision, reliability, and its social
goals are `ABLE THE DISABLED' and remove

social standing.
· Recruitment approach: Bhavnagar has two prominent

· Training: The new recruits are asked to observe

then trained by the existing team.
· Job allocation: Each employee is assigned tasks that

person could serve as an ability to do the task better.
For example, a deaf person placed at an injection
unit does not get affected by the noise and thus takes
fewer breaks and displays sharper concentration. The
mentally challenged people are assigned repetitive
tasks, such as packaging, as repetition is therapeutic
for them. In the packaging department, 7 out of the 10
people working are mentally challenged.
Based on the work that has happened in Microsign,
the CEO Nisheeth shares, `with suitable modifications
in the job context, persons with disabilities who have
the right attitude and requisite skills, can perform'. He
confidently adds, `Now I know that there is nothing
such as abled and disabled. The disabled have some
abilities and the abled have other disabilities'.
CONCLUSION
When it comes to inclusion of PWDs in organization,
the discourse needs to change from hiring differently
abled people as a charitable gesture to being able to
understand and highlight the business case supporting
the cause. Having brought in a certain number of PWDs
into the workforce, the challenge is then to help the
latter 85 per cent of people not living with disabilities
or the non-disabled segment of the population to
understand the challenges that their co-workers face
on a regular basis.
Some possible directions for strengthening inclusive
practices with regard to disability include:
· Developing capabilities of persons with disabilities
to better negotiate for their rights, themselves.
· Making the terms and conditions of work and
employment fair and favourable for persons with
disabilities.
· Empowering persons with disabilities to work
better by allowing job shadowing and mentoring
by internal employees and with special educators/
trainers.
· Upscaling efforts for inclusion by documenting
them, creating best practices, and creating wider
dialogue with various institutions.
· Building an emancipatory research agenda to
investigate the lived experiences of persons with
disabilities in various walks of life, particularly
those of women with disabilities in rural areas.
360 COLLOQUIUM
Making Inclusion Happen: What Truly Matters
Neharika Vohra Vijayalakshmi Chari
Professor Independent Coach and Story-teller
Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad Bengaluru
e-mail: neharika@iimahd.ernet.in e-mail: vijji.chari@gmail.com
From the colloquium and the extant research on
diversity and inclusion, it is clear that when
organizations begin to create a diverse workforce,
they realize that unless efforts are made to include the
different people, diversity per se would not be able to
make much contribution. The need to include arises
from the response humans have to something that they
see as being different. Most people are most comfort-
able with those who are like them.
From this colloquium, we can say that the following
efforts seem to be common in most organizations:
· Defining and communicating a clear business case
that supports the need for a diverse work force.
· Aiming mainly to first improve gender diversity and
then shifting focus on to other aspects of diversity--
regional, generational, differently abled people and
in some rare cases, the LGBT community.
· Identifying champions mainly in the senior
leadership team to communicate the intent and to
drive efforts for supporting diversity and inclusion.
· Looking at a range of interventions to increase
sensitization--at times focused on specific groups--
like recruitment team, people managers and at
times, to reach out to the entire organization to
address unconscious biases and acts of exclusion.
While the programmes are quite robust, all the
organizations spoke of ensuring that these are done
on a continuous and sustained basis.
· Being unapologetic in supporting unique needs
of the diversity--could be with respect to gender,
religion, or physical needs.
· Highlighting the diversity in the culture and
celebrating it--through festivals or hosting forums
and talks on aspects of inclusion.
· Having zero tolerance policy towards exclusion and
having mechanisms that make it safe and possible
to highlight and address issues of exclusion,
harassment, and discrimination.
· Measuring diversity and inclusion--be it in terms
of continuously monitoring the demographics at
different levels to using employee surveys to assess
employee perceptions and engagement around
inclusion and feeling a sense of belonging.
· Identifying collaborators in the larger eco-system--
the NGOs and community-based organizations
working with specific groups. Also a willingness
to share practices and learn from the experiences
of other corporates doing focused work around
diversity and inclusion.
The above are some of the lessons that can be learnt
by organizations who are beginning their efforts in
ensuring inclusion or have made a serious commitment
to D&I. In addition, as organizations move towards
diversity and inclusion, they also realize that one
size may not fit all in attempting to include different
minority groups. As Derven's research indicates,
diversity and inclusion initiatives must be adapted to
each region, requiring a multi-faceted approach across
the organization's policies and practices.97 Taking
an ethno-centric approach for driving diversity and
inclusion initiatives globally has been cautioned as a
sure recipe for failure.98 It is important to recognize that
dimensions of diversity vary in scope and importance
across cultures and organizational leaders need to be
awareofthemintheirinitiatives.Justthisfactchallenges
those involved in the diversity and inclusion initiative
to be creative, open and flexible in their approaches,
programmes, and policies.
On the basis of our research, reading, and discussions
about inclusion with organizations, we paint a word
picture of what a truly inclusive organization99 would

of employees rather than in whom the competency
resides.
· The labels of skills, competence, citizenship, and
roles can coexist with identities such as gender,
regions, and special needs.
· Inclusion efforts are not directed towards one
particular community or group but are reflected
in respectful and supportive practices towards all
individuals irrespective of gender, community, age,
sexual preferences, and unique needs.
· Leaders demonstrate through their actions, belief in
and commitment to diversity, creating opportunities
for dialogue about differences, and when required,
even alter rules and norms to accommodate
differences.
· Employees are able to bring their whole selves to
the organization, expressing and giving voice in
an unhindered way to ensure effective problem
solving, decision making, creativity, and enhanced
performance in multiple ways.
· The policies and processes bear a stamp of the
diverse needs and perspectives that exist in the
organization.
· The employee is seen as a whole person with a life
outside the workplace as well.
· It is explicitly recognized that all employees have
peaks and troughs ­ in some cases it is predictable (as
seen often in the case of women employees) and at
times it is sudden (as can happen to anyone--man or
woman--given their own personal responsibilities,
needs, and aspirations). Recognizing this, the
system extends empathy and the expected support
rather than imputing motive to their commitment
and abilities when the person going through the
trough.
· A sense of belonging is created and experienced not
by dismissing but by celebrating the uniqueness
among individuals.
· There is an active checking of a predominantly
dominant (in most cases masculine) discourse, for
example, `I know everything, I need no help, I can
win if I try hard, I need to compete to get ahead'--
and alternative discourses are encouraged, for
example, `I do not know everything, I may need
help, I can win if we all try hard, I need to collaborate
to get ahead'.
· The focus is to be natural rather than correct. For
example, it is natural to be curious but correct to not
show curiosity.
· The merging of being natural and respect creates an
environment of joy and exploration rather than a
climate of being proper and constrained as created
by correctness and rule obeisance.
· There is a willingness to accept openly the presence
of biases and shortcuts in judgements and recognize
when it comes in the way of limiting another
person's potential and capability.
· Conflicts and complaints arising out of perception
of biases of others are openly discussed and not
brushed under the carpet.
· Inclusiveness is a way of life and not something nice
to do when the going is good for the organization
and put on the back-burner when there is a crisis in
the organization.
In conclusion, we raise some other questions that we
believe individuals involved in diversity and inclusion
efforts within organizations and researchers need to
work with:
· What differences are we willing to address in our
attempts towards inclusion? In what ways could we
move beyond the obvious labels such as gender and
ability to some of the more invisible differences?
· To what extent are we willing to acknowledge the
impact of our larger social structures and realities
on our efforts of creating a diverse workplace?
Some realities of the Indian socio-cultural fabric--
say caste dynamics or socio-economic status-- seem
to not find adequate visibility in the conversations
and efforts that Indian organizations are putting.
In most cases, organizations do not capture caste
as part of their demographics. However, the reality
is that even if organizations do not acknowledge
it, people know caste and how it may be leading
to dynamics that might be exclusionary of people
belonging to some castes and socio economic status.
Only a few organizations are making the effort to
provide opportunities for people from economically
disadvantaged backgrounds to find work in the
organization.
· Besides the structured processes and mechanisms
to promote D&I, what could be some creative
ways in which the spirit behind the thought of
diversity is promoted among employees across the
organization?
· What could be ways of acknowledging and
benefiting from our intrinsic ability as Indians to
live, interact, and prosper in a diverse community?
Or even to use the premium that our culture
places on relationships to facilitate inclusion
interventions?

· How do we keep everyone continually engaged
in the organization? What could we do to make
everyone experience that inclusion does not benefit
just a select few but when embraced in its entirety
serves for everyone's and a larger good.
There clearly is a need to have more open authentic
conversations to move towards this ideal. These
conversations would perhaps help promote the existing
discourse that support inclusion and also derive inputs,
tostrengtheninterventionsdrivinginclusion.Inclosing,
we share this excerpt from Margaret Wheatley's book,
Turning to one another: Simple conversations to restore hope
to the future:
Ask `What is possible?' not `What's wrong?'
Keep asking. Notice what you care about. Assume that
many others share your dreams.
Be brave enough to start a conversation that matters.
Talk to people you know. Talk to people you don't know.
Talk to people you never talk to. Be intrigued by the
differences you hear. Expect to be surprised. Treasure
curiosity more than certainty. Invite in everybody
who cares to work on what's possible. Acknowledge
that everyone is an expert about something. Know
that creative solutions come from new connections.
Remember, you don't fear people whose story you
know. Real listening always brings people closer
together. Trust that meaningful conversations can
change your world.Quidempo rerion
