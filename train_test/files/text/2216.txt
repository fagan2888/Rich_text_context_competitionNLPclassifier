Background: To investigate how incarceration may affect risk of
acquiring HIV and other sexually transmitted infections, we tested
associations of ex-offenders' sexual risk behavior with the male-female
sex ratio and the male incarceration rate.
Methods: Longitudinal data from 1287 drug-involved persons on
probation and parole as part of the Criminal Justice Drug Abuse
Treatment Studies were matched by county of residence with popula-
tion factors, and stratified by race/ethnicity and gender. Generalized
estimating equations assessed associations of having unprotected sex
with a partner who had HIV risk factors, and having 1 sex partner in
the past month.
Results: Among non-Hispanic black men and women, low sex ratios
were associated with greater risk of having unprotected sex with a risky
partner (adjusted relative risk [ARR]  1.76, 95% confidence interval
[CI]  1.29, 2.42; ARR  2.48, 95% CI  1.31, 4.73, respectively).
Among non-Hispanic black and non-Hispanic white (NHW) women,
low sex ratios were associated with having 1 sex partner (ARR 
2.00, 95% CI  1.02, 3.94; ARR  1.71, 95% CI  1.06, 2.75,
respectively). High incarceration rates were associated with greater risk
of having a risky partner for all men (non-Hispanic black: ARR  2.14,
95% CI  1.39, 3.30; NHW: ARR  1.39, 95% CI: 1.05, 1.85;
Hispanic: ARR  3.99, 95% CI  1.55, 10.26) and having 1 partner
among NHW men (ARR  1.92, 95% CI  1.40, 2.64).
Conclusions: Low sex ratios and high incarceration rates may
influence the number and risk characteristics of sex partners of ex-
offenders. HIV-prevention policies and programs for ex-offenders
could be improved by addressing structural barriers to safer sexual
behavior.
In the United States, one in every 100 adults is currently
incarcerated, the highest rate in the world.1 Racial and ethnic
disparities in the criminal justice experience parallel those
observed in HIV/AIDS, with non-Hispanic blacks (NHBs) and
Hispanics representing about 12% and 16% of the general
population, respectively,2 but about 41% and 22% of those
incarcerated,3 and 49% and 20% of those recently diagnosed
with AIDS.4 Better understanding the determinants of behavior
that facilitate HIV transmission among the population that
experiences incarceration may be critical for understanding
both overall HIV/AIDS epidemiology and trends in racial/
ethnic disparities in HIV/AIDS.
Incarceration affects the inmates' sexual partnerships,
social networks, families, and communities, and these effects
may extend throughout the period of community supervision.
People on probation and parole are required to meet regularly
with a parole or probation officer and abide by supervision
conditions. In 2007, 5.1 million people were on probation or
parole.5 Returning to the community may also entail a return to
drug use and sexual behaviors and, for some, to an increase
beyond preincarceration levels.6 Prisoners returning to the
community may also have limited social and economic oppor-
tunities, often experiencing homelessness, poverty, and unsta-
ble living circumstances, which can contribute to vulnerability
to HIV infection. People under community supervision can be
especially vulnerable to population determinants of sexual be-
havior and may be more likely to engage in relationships with
risky sex partners. For example, high rates of relationship
dissolution, difficulties finding housing or employment on
release, and relapse to drug use may encourage some ex-
inmates to engage in sexual relationships in exchange for
housing or money. The relative availability of partners in
communities where inmates are released may facilitate or
impede development of sexual relationships with multiple
partners, or with partners that may be more likely to be
infected with HIV or other sexually transmitted infections
(STIs) themselves, or that may belong to a sexual network
that includes infected individuals.
The male-female sex ratio and the male incarceration
rate may represent structural or population factors outside of
individual control that can affect sexual behavior and member-
ship in sexual networks that may help explain the link between
racial/ethnic disparities in HIV prevalence and in incarceration.
The sex ratio is calculated as the number of men per 100

women. Although slightly more boys are born than girls,
women tend to outnumber men in adulthood, as male mortality
rate surpasses that of females throughout the lifespan. Incar-
ceration, military service, and migration can also lower the sex
ratio. These effects may be more pronounced in some geo-
graphic areas and racial/ethnic groups. For example, a high
black male incarceration rate may have a large impact on a
city's or county's sex ratio for blacks in the reproductive age
range (ages: 15­49 years), but may not be noticeable at the
neighborhood or state level, and may have no association with
sex ratios of other racial/ethnic or age-groups. A low sex ratio,
indicating a shortage of men, reflects an increased demographic
opportunity for the men remaining in the community to accrue
more heterosexual partners. For people on probation or parole,
opportunities for sexual partnerships with low-risk partners
may be limited by the assortative nature of sexual partnerships
and by the perception among potential partners that ex-offend-
ers are members of a high-risk group.
Although the incarceration rate may directly relate to
HIV incidence through incarceration of injection drug users, it
may also serve as an independent indicator of the rate of
relationship disruption or of relationship vulnerability.6,7
Among men with primary partners, incarceration for longer
than a month can lead to relationship dissolution and to having
multiple sex partners on release.6 Having a partner who was
recently incarcerated has been associated with having multiple,
transactional, concurrent, and risky partners, as well as with
having had a recent HIV or STI diagnosis.8,9 Partner charac-
teristics are likely to reflect characteristics of risk networks.
Thus, incarceration may decrease the ability of former prisoners to
maintain safer social and sexual networks they may have had
before incarceration. Few studies have examined sexual risk be-
havior during parole and probation,10­14 with most focused on
individual knowledge and attitudes or relationship factors.
This study aimed to explore the influence, before and
during community supervision, of 2 potential population deter-
minants of sexual behavior thought to increase exposure to HIV
and other STIs: the sex ratio and the male incarceration rate in
the county of residence.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Sample
The data came from the 2 completed studies with over-
lapping instruments that were part of the Criminal Justice Drug
Abuse Treatment Studies-1 (CJDATS) cooperative agreement.
One study, Transitional Case Management, tested whether case
management during reentry increases participation in commu-
nity drug abuse treatment, enhances access to social services,
and improves outcomes during a 9-month follow-up. Eligible
participants were (a) at least aged 18 years; (b) referred to a
community-based substance abuse treatment program; (c)
within 2 to 3 months of release; and (d) released to a metro-
politan area where case management activities were being
conducted. The second study, Step'n Out, examined the effect
of collaborative behavioral management that integrated treat-
ment counseling and community supervision versus standard
parole on crime, drug use, and rearrest during 9-month follow-
up. Parolees with preincarceration substance use disorders at
moderate-to-high risk of recidivism constituted the target pop-
ulation. Inclusion criteria were (a) at least 18 years old; (b)
English speaking; (c) probable drug dependence immediately
before incarceration (i.e., Texas Christian University [TCU]
Drug Screen II15 score 3 or mandated drug treatment); (d)
substance use treatment as a mandated or recommended con-
dition of parole; (e) moderate-to-high risk of drug relapse
and/or recidivism (i.e., Lifestyle Criminality Screening Form
[LCSF] score 716 or a history of 2 prior drug abuse treat-
ment episodes or drug-related convictions). Neither of the
studies aimed to alter HIV risk behavior, and intervention
content did not directly address HIV. Study descriptions and
findings are reported elsewhere.17,18
Data for the present analysis included 1287 drug-in-
volved participants on probation and parole across 23 locations
and up to 3 time points. Study sites were located in Rhode
Island, Connecticut, Delaware, Virginia, Oregon, Kentucky,
and Colorado.
Variables
Individual-Level Factors. Baseline self-reported age,
race/ethnicity, gender and marital status (married/living as mar-
ried with partner  1, else 0), a time-varying variable, were
assessed at each interview.
Population Factors. Using decennial census data, we
estimated 3 population factors: sex ratios, incarceration rates,
and poverty rates for the participants' counties of recruitment
and follow-up, which were used as an indicator for county of
residence. Poverty rate served as a control variable. County was
assumed to approximate the catchment area of potential sexual
partners. Two separate sex ratios were calculated for each
racial/ethnic group. An assortative or matched sex ratio was
calculated for the NHB, non-Hispanic white (NHW), and His-
panic populations. A disassortative sex ratio was also calcu-
lated for each race/ethnicity using the sum of the population in
racial/ethnic categories other than that of the target racial/ethnic
group. To facilitate comparisons, a median split defined cate-
gories of the population factors for each race/ethnicity and
gender, where low sex ratios and high incarceration and pov-
erty rates were dummy coded (1/0). In locations with sparse
data for a given racial category, the population factor was set to
missing, but was retained in the analysis as a separate category.
Table 1 defines the population factor cut-points.
Outcomes. HIV/AIDS risk behaviors were collected
by interview at baseline, 3- and 9-month follow-up using a
modified version of the National Institute for Drug AbuseRisk
Behavior Assessment.18 We analyzed 2 sexual risk behaviors
reported in the past 30 days: sex with multiple partners (any
gender) and unprotected sex with a risky partner. Sex with
multiple partners was defined as reporting 2 or more to the
following question: "In the past 30 days, how many different
people have you had sex (vaginal, anal, or oral) with?" People
who reported 0 or 1 partner were included in the reference
group. Engaging in unprotected sex with a risky partner was
defined as 0 response to any of the following questions: "How
many times in the past 30 days have you had unprotected sex
(vaginal, anal, or oral) with: (a) someone who is not your primary
partner; (b) someone who shot drugs with needles; (c) someone
who sometimes smokes crack/cocaine and/or methamphetamine;
or (d) while trading sex for drugs, money, or gifts?" People who
reported 0 to all of these questions or who reported no sex in the
past 30 days were included in the reference group.
Analysis
Because of known race and gender differences in crim-
inal justice populations,1 drug use,19 health equity,20 and HIV
risk behaviors,21 we stratified the analyses into NHB males,

NHW males, Hispanic Males, NHB females, and NHW fe-
males. Hispanic females (N  39) and all other race categories
(N  55) were excluded because of small population sizes. To
adjust for similarities within site and across time for the same
participant, generalized estimating equations (GEEs) with a log
link (to estimate relative risks) were built. Because our goal
was to generate population-average estimates of the association
between population-level determinants and HIV sexual risk be-
havior and given their greater statistical flexibility, GEEs were
preferred over nonlinear mixed models (e.g., SAS [version 9.2,
Cary, NC] Proc GLIMMIX). Parallel analyses were conducted
using Proc GLIMMIX as a sensitivity analysis. Similar findings
for many of the analyses were detected but appeared less robust
when there were smaller sample sizes with only 2 to 3 points
per person, a known drawback of this modeling approach.22
Multicollinearity was checked for the full models using
variance inflation factors and, when indicated, reduced par-
simonious models are presented. All models controlled for
individual-level factors and time (as a fixed effect). Individ-
ual-level factors included age, time, Criminal Justice Drug
Abuse Treatment Studies-1 (Transitional Case Management
or Step'n'Out), and marital status. Time interactions were
tested but were either not significant or unstable (because of
sparse data); therefore, we present only main effects.
This study was approved by the Rhode Island Hospital
Institutional Review Board and, for the 2 underlying studies, by
each site Institutional Review Board, and the federal Office of
Human Research and Protection.
RESULTS
Sample Characteristics and Preincarceration HIV
Risk Behaviors
Analysis included 1051 males and 236 females. Men
were a median 34 years old,  one-third had completed high
school, and a minority were married or living as married with
a partner before incarceration (Table 2). Women were a median
35 years old and also had low educational attainment. Prein-
carceration HIV sexual risk behaviors were common. Having
multiple sex partners in the past 30 days was reported by more
than a third of men, and slightly under a third of women. NHB
men had the highest prevalence of having multiple sex partners
in the 30 days before incarceration. Both NHB men and women
had the lowest prevalence of having unprotected sex with a
risky partner in the 30 days before incarceration.
Population factors differed greatly across racial/ethnic
groups (Table 1). NHB participants had higher median rates for
incarceration and lower median sex ratio values compared with
both NHW and Hispanic participants.
Social Determinants and HIV Sex Risk Behaviors
During Community Supervision
Table 3 reports unadjusted and adjusted relative risk
(ARR) ratios for the population determinants of interest, strat-
ified by gender and race/ethnicity.
Non-Hispanic Black Participants
Among NHB male participants, both unadjusted (rela-
tive risk [RR]: 1.35 [1.03, 1.77]) and adjusted (ARR: 2.14
[1.39, 3.30]) models revealed significant associations of higher
incarceration rate with increased risk of having unprotected sex
with a risky partner. Adjusted (ARR: 1.76 [1.29, 2.42]) models
detected significant associations of lower matched sex ratio
with increased risk of having unprotected sex with a risky
partner. Sex ratios and incarceration rates were not significantly
associated with having multiple recent sex partners among
NHB male participants.
In unadjusted analyses among NHB female participants,
the matched sex ratio exhibited a strong association with the
risk of engaging in unprotected sex with a risky partner (RR:
2.37 [1.27, 4.39]) and having multiple sex partners (RR: 2.14
[1.12, 4.09]). However, the adjusted model demonstrated mul-
ticollinearity between the poverty rate and sex ratio variables.
Therefore, reduced models were fit that removed the variables
in a stepwise manner. Reduced models without poverty rate
confirmed the previously detected associations between the
matched sex ratio and the risk of engaging in unprotected sex
with a risky partner during community supervision (ARR: 2.48
[1.31, 4.73]) and with a low matched sex ratio and greater risk
of having multiple sex partners (ARR: 2.00 [1.02, 3.94]).
Non-Hispanic White Participants
For the NHW males, a higher incarceration rate (ARR:
1.39 [1.05, 1.85]) was associated with both increased risk of
engaging in unprotected sex with a risky partner and with
having multiple sex partners (ARR: 1.92 [1.40, 2.64]).
Unadjusted models for the NHW females revealed asso-
ciations between the low disassortative sex ratio (RR: 1.72
[1.03, 2.88]) and having multiple sex partners. Multicollinear-
ity between poverty and both sex ratios precluded multivariable
analysis of having multiple partners. Reduced adjusted models
that removed poverty and age and included either sex ratio
found an association between lower sex ratio and having mul-
tiple partners (matched ARR 1.71 [1.06, 2.75]) or disassortative
sex ratio (ARR: 1.72 [1.06, 2.77]) (Table 3). GEEs with logit
links were also fit to these data: low sex ratios (matched
adjusted odds ratio [AOR]: 4.16 [1.55, 11.1]); disassortative
sex ratio (AOR: 4.17 [1.57, 11.08]) were associated with in-

and poverty.
Hispanic Participants
Among Hispanic males, a higher incarceration rate
(ARR: 3.99 [1.55, 10.26]) and a lower disassortative sex ratio
(ARR: 2.99 [1.63, 5.51]) were associated with increased risk of
having unprotected sex with a risky partner in the adjusted
model (Table 3). Sex ratios and incarceration rates were not
significantly associated with having multiple recent sex part-
ners in this group.
DISCUSSION
In this sample of people on probation and parole, sex
ratios and incarceration rates in the county of residence pre-
dicted the quantity and HIV risk characteristics of recent sex
partners. NHB male and female participants living in counties
with low NHB sex ratios had greater risk of having unprotected
sex with a risky partner. For these groups, the interaction
between having been incarcerated and living in an area with a
shortage of men may facilitate participation in or entrance into
riskier sexual networks. This could partly explain elevated HIV
and STI rates among blacks compared with whites. For NHB
women, low NHB sex ratios were also associated with having
multiple partners. The status of NHB men as ex-offenders may
have limited their opportunities to acquire less risky partners.
Significant associations were also observed among
NHW and Hispanic participants. High incarceration rates were
associated with greater risk of having unprotected sex with a
risky partner among Hispanic men and of having both unpro-
tected sex with a risky partner and having more than one
partner among NHW men. Hispanic men were more likely to
have unprotected sex with a risky partner if the disassortative
sex ratio was low. NHW women were more likely to have
multiple partners if they lived in a county with low-matched or
disassortative sex ratios. The associations of disassortative sex
ratios among NHW women and Hispanic men may reflect more
interracial/ethnic opposite sex partnerships with risky partners.
A recent national population-based study found that low
sex ratios and high male incarceration rates were associated
with a greater likelihood of having multiple partners in the past
year among NHB men, but not among NHB women.23 Al-
though the population and sexual behavior questions differ
from those of the current study, the findings among NHB men
are similar. One other study of the effects of sex ratios and
incarceration rates on sexual behavior among blacks showed no
association among men and a positive association among
women.24 Further analyses indicated that this finding was the
result of less sex work among women in low sex ratio areas.
However, that study used sex ratio data from the census tract (a
smaller geographic unit) in a single geographic area, and it is
unclear how well this unit describes the area in which people
seek partners.25 Geographic studies of mobility of drug-in-
volved parolees suggest this population changes residences
across moderate distances.26 Thus, county of residence may
provide a reasonable estimate of the catchment area for poten-
tial sex partners.
Poverty was treated as a control variable in our analyses
and was retained whenever possible in the models. Modeling
problems arose when poverty rate was collinear with 1 or more
of the exposures of interest. As this happened only in instances
among the women, and sample sizes for the women were the
smallest, it is not possible to entirely disentangle the effects of
small cell sizes (a statistical problem) from sex-specific vul-

nerabilities (a sociological problem). That is, collinearity may
have been because of high levels of the female probationer/
parolee's particular vulnerabilities, linked to syndemics 27­29 of
sex work, transactional sex, limited social support and family
ties, proclivity to return to neighborhoods with concentrated
poverty, high male incarceration rates, and fewer same-race
male partners. Analyses to explore these associations in a larger
sample of women under community supervision are needed.
Results underscore the fragility of the reentry period and
the need to focus efforts on housing, work assistance, and job
placement in the community. Ex-offenders are disqualified
from many sources of public support and have difficulty finding
employment,11 and people convicted of state or federal felonies
involving the use or sale of drugs are banned from receiving
cash benefits or food stamps.30 These diminished life opportu-
nities may decrease ex-offenders' ability to develop and main-
tain committed sexual partnerships or marriage. This may be
more pronounced among NHB males because of high levels of
unemployment and incarceration.
Our findings have several limitations. First, data were
self-reported and may have been affected by measurement
error. Sexual risk behavior outcomes did not distinguish be-
tween vaginal, anal, and oral sex, and between same-gender
and opposite-gender sex. Second, it was not possible to distin-
guish all instances of condom use from sex; thus, results may
conflate influences on both frequency of sex and frequency of
condom use. The sample may not have provided sexual risk or
population data that were representative of all racial/ethnic
populations on community supervision. The lack of a control
group precludes analysis of incarceration as an individual fac-
tor. For the Transitional Case Management study, which re-
cruited participants in prison, county of recruitment may be a
poor proxy for county of residence. However, sensitivity anal-
yses iteratively eliminating Transitional Case Management
sites indicated no fundamental change in the magnitude or
direction of the observed associations. The relatively small size
of racial/ethnic subsamples precluded testing nonlinear associ-
ations with sex ratios, which are known to exist.23 We were
unable to include data from counties with small populations.
Finally, our exploratory analyses detected statistically signifi-
cant and valid associations, but the use of GEEs with a log link
returned unstable RRs in some strata, especially the women.
Replication of these findings in a larger sample of women
recently released from incarceration is recommended.
Implications
A lack of adequate primary and secondary HIV preven-
tive interventions suggests that new approaches are needed to
reduce HIV transmission to and from minority populations.31
To this end, efforts to address population factors may return
greater HIV-prevention effects. For instance, interventions to
reduce the incarceration rate in a community, such as through
the use of drug courts32 or implementation research that re-
aligns police and parole/probation officer interventions with

public health goals,33 could help reduce sexual risk behavior
and sexual network dynamics that facilitate HIV transmission.
This kind of policy intervention could improve outcomes by
both reducing the number of individuals experiencing incarcer-
ation and by reducing the contribution of high rates of incar-
ceration to sex ratio imbalance. Improving access to treatment
for drug-dependent inmates, before release and on reentry, can
reduce recidivism, improve health outcomes,34 and, in time,
may promote lifestyle and sexual partnership stability. Other
policy interventions, such as lifting restrictions against people
with criminal histories from receipt of public housing or other
support, can influence community HIV risk by reducing a
structural barrier that undermines committed partnerships.11
Public health may be served by helping incarcerated men and
women maintain their marriages or other important partner-
ships, especially considering that most incarcerations last under
1 year,3 that many people are reincarcerated,1 and that relation-
ship dissolution has been found to be related to subsequent
sexual risk behavior.6
In conclusion, our findings suggest that ex-offenders
living in counties with a low sex ratio or a high incarceration
rate are particularly vulnerable to sexual behavior and partner
characteristics that may put them at risk for HIV or other STIs,
particularly for those living in high prevalence areas. Research
is needed to determine whether racial/ethnic differences in sex
ratios or incarceration rates contribute to racial/ethnic dispari-
ties in sexual transmission of HIV or other STIs.
