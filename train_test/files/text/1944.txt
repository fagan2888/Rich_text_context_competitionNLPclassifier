LIFE-SPAN psychological research has long been inter-
ested in structural relations among intraindividual
changes within and between domains of functioning (Baltes
& Nesselroade, 1979; Magnusson & Cairns, 1996). Our
study explores the developmental ordering of three central
components of successful aging, namely indicators of per-
ceived control, health, and social support. An extensive
body of research has demonstrated that perceived control
shows moderately strong cross-sectional relations with lev-
els of health and social support (Krause, 2007; Lachman &
Weaver, 1998; Rodin, 1986). Relatively little is known,
however, about possible antecedent­consequent relations
between levels of functioning and subsequent changes
across the three domains. To examine the nature and corre-
lates of such relations, we apply change score (CS) models
to 9-year longitudinal data from two occasions of the na-
tional Midlife in the United States survey (MIDUS). Specif-
ically, we (a) empirically compare competing unidirectional
and multidirectional accounts of across-domain associa-
tions and (b) explore if and how changes in one domain are
accompanied by changes in another domain and whether
the strength of these relations differs with age, gender, and
education.
Antecedent­Consequent Relations of Perceived Control to
Health and Social Support
Perceptions of control refer to beliefs about one's capa-
bility to bring about a given outcome (Lachman & Weaver,
1998; Levenson, 1981; Skinner, 1995). Such feelings of au-
tonomy and self-determination are generally considered to
be essential constituents of successful aging and show con-
siderable associations with indicators of adaptation (Baltes
& Baltes, 1990; Lachman, Neupert, &Agrigoroaei, in press;
Rowe & Kahn, 1997; Ryff & Singer, 1998). For example, it
is well established that perceived control shows sizeable
cross-sectional associations with various health measures,
including better physical and mental health, and a longer
life (Krause & Shaw, 2003; Kunzmann, Little, & Smith,
2002; Taylor, Helgeson, Reed, & Skokan, 1991). Similarly,
various forms of social support (e.g., caring for and appre-
ciating the other, empathy, providing help) have been linked
to perceived control (Antonucci, 2001; Cohen & Wills,
1985). However, the directionality and developmental se-
quences of such associations are less well understood and
have rarely been empirically examined, particularly when de-
velopmental changes across the three domains are considered
conjointly. We draw from Lachman's (2006) integrative

Objectives. To examine antecedent­consequent relations of perceived control to health and social support across
adulthood and old age.
Methods. We applied (multigroup) change score models to two waves of data collected 9 years apart from 6,210
participants of the Midlife in the United States survey (MIDUS, 24­75 years at baseline). We used composite
measures of perceived control (personal mastery and constraints), health (chronic conditions, acute conditions,
and functional limitations), and social support (support and strain associated with spouse/partner, family, and
friends).
Results. Analyses revealed evidence for direct and independent multidirectional accounts. Greater initial control pre-
dicted weaker declines in health and stronger increases in support. In turn, increases in control were predicted by better
initial health and more support. Changes in control were also accompanied by concurrent changes in the other two do-
mains, and relations involving control were larger in size than those between health and support. We found only small
sociodemographic differences across age, gender, and education group.
Discussion. We conclude that perceiving control may serve as both a precursor and an outcome of health and social
support across the adult age range and suggest routes for further inquiry.

conceptual model and consider control beliefs to be both an
antecedent and an outcome of adaptation in the health and
social domains (see also Skaff, 2007; Uchino, 2006).
In this model, preserved control beliefs or a lack thereof
are expected to have profound motivational and behavioral
consequences (e.g., engagement and persistence in activi-
ties, particularly in the face of difficulties) that in the long
run either restrain or help to exploit an individual's
resources. Perceived control thus acts as an antecedent con-
dition that fosters health or social support. Specifically, in-
dividuals who report greater control beliefs are often more
inclined to adopt and continue with health maintenance be-
haviors, such as exercise and preventive care (Rodin, 1986;
Seeman, Unger, McAvay, & Mendes de Leon, 1999). Sense
of control may also be an important factor in how well
people manage to actively seek out, mobilize, and handle
the availability of social support (Lang, Featherman, &
Nesselroade, 1997). For example, despite plausible expec-
tations that those in need will receive most support, indi-
viduals with a strong sense of control are more likely to
attract sources of support than those who convey a helpless
outlook (Pearlin & Schooler, 1978).
In turn, the Lachman and colleagues (1997) model also
posits that control beliefs constitute an outcome of resources
in the health and social domains. In particular, people in
better health may perceive themselves to have the means for
achieving desired outcomes, whereas aspects of poor health
such as chronic conditions or functional limitations may
destabilize feelings of control (Cairney, Corna, Wade, &
Streiner, 2007; Wurm, Tesch-Römer, & Tomasik, 2007).
Similarly, supportive social experiences and exchanges
have been proposed to constitute major sources for percep-
tions of control (see also Antonucci & Jackson, 1987;
Bandura, 1977; Deci & Ryan, 1995). Features of social support
that may foster a sense of control include encouraging
mastery attempts, providing supportive performance feed-
back, and suggesting appropriate coping responses in times
of strain. However, the empirical evidence in both domains
is rather inconclusive, primarily because many studies are
based on cross-sectional data that preclude inferences re-
garding the temporal sequence (for discussion, see Martire,
Stephens, & Townsend, 1998). Longitudinal findings are
also mixed, with some studies reporting predictive effects of
health or support for perceived control, whereas other stud-
ies do not (e.g., Krause, 1987; McAvay, Seeman, & Rodin,
1996; Skaff, Pearlin, & Mullan, 1996). Our conceptual
premise in this study is that perceived control serves both
antecedent and consequent functions for adaptation in the
health and social domains.
The nature and correlates of multidirectional across-
domain associations
A key feature of the Lachman's (2006) model and other
models (Skaff, 2007; Uchino, 2006) is the embedded and
interdependent nature of across-domain changes. Though
directional inferences cannot be drawn from concurrent
changes, highly valuable insights can be gained from exam-
ining if change in one domain in the system is accompanied
by change in another domain (Seeman & Lewis, 1995). For
example, decrements in perceived control might undermine
the pursuit of health maintenance behaviors, thereby
resulting in declining health, which in the long run may
lead to cascades of further reductions in control beliefs. In
a similar vein, control beliefs are often considered one
mechanism underlying well-known relations between
facets of social support and health (Antonucci, 2001;
Berkman, Glass, Brisette, & Seeman, 2000; Bisconti &
Bergeman, 1999). We thus expect the size of support-health
relations to be reduced when all three domains are consid-
ered simultaneously.
Conceptual and empirical work alike also suggests that
multidomain associations may be moderated by third
variables, such as age (Lachman, 2006; Mirowsky, 1995).
Health problems typically occur more often and are more
serious in old age relative to young and mid adulthood
(Aldwin, Spiro, & Park, 2006). Such health decrements in
available resources of strength and vitality can be expected
to undermine and exert limitations on older adults' control
efforts (Rodin, 1986). In a similar vein, a compromised
health system may be particularly vulnerable to the detri-
mental effects of lack of control. Both arguments suggest
stronger control­health associations in old age than in
earlier phases of life. Also, one of the prime reasons why
perceived control typically shows only minor decrements in
old age may be because older adults increasingly attempt to
derive their sense of control from more controllable and at-
tainable sources, such as one's social network (Heckhausen,
Wrosch, & Schulz, 2010). This also suggests more pro-
nounced control­social associations in old age than in
earlier phases of life. We will additionally explore if across-
domain associations differ by gender and education. Spe-
cifically, women typically report more health problems
(Moen, 1996) and are often more active in social net-
works (Antonucci & Akiyama, 1987). It thus appears con-
ceivable that these domains are more tightly connected to
perceived control among women relative to men. Finally,
cross-sectional reports indicate that perceived control buf-
fers the negative health effects of low socioeconomic status
(SES; Lachman & Weaver, 1998). Such across-domain as-
sociations may thus be stronger for low-SES in contrast to
high-SES groups.
The present study
We extend and qualify earlier insights into the nature and
implications of antecedent­consequent relations of per-
ceived control to health and social support across adult-
hood. We go beyond previous reports by examining all
three domains conjointly and by targeting across-domain
CHANGES IN PERCEIVED CONTROL, HEALTH, AND SUPPORT 63
relations in a longitudinal context. To do so, we applied CS
models to two-wave 9-year MIDUS data (N = 6,210; 24­75
years at baseline) to address two sets of questions. First,
considering initial level of perceived control as an anteced-
ent, we determined its predictive role for levels and changes
in health and social support. Targeting change in perceived
control as an outcome, we simultaneously examined the
predictive role of previous levels of health and social
support. Based on our guiding conceptual framework
(Lachman, 2006), we expected multidirectional associa-
tions in that perceived control would uniquely predict sub-
sequent changes in health and support and that initial health
and support in turn independently would predict changes in
control. In a second step, we explored if change in one do-
main was accompanied by changes in other domains and if
differential across-domain associations emerged in age,
gender, and education subgroups.
Methods
We used two-wave 9-year data from the national MIDUS
survey conducted in 1995­1996 (T1) and 2004­2006 (T2).
Detailed descriptions of the study are published in Brim,
Ryff, and Kessler (2004) and Lachman and Weaver (1998).
A brief overview is given subsequently.
Participants and Procedure
To recruit MIDUS participants, a national sample of
households in the 48 contiguous states with at least one
telephone was selected using random digit dialing. The
core sample of 7,120 noninstitutionalized adults was strat-
ified by gender and age with the greatest number between
40 and 60 years. Participants were interviewed for 20­30
min by telephone (70% response rate) and then received a
questionnaire in the mail containing the measures used in
this study. An average of nine years (range of 8­10 years)
later, 75% of survivors from the original sample agreed to
participate. We included all participants with valid data on
the three target domains (control, health, and support) at
the first occasion, resulting in a sample of 6,210 partici-
pants. Of those, 62% provided data for the second wave.
Relative to the remaining participants, those who contrib-
uted longitudinal data were older, M = 47.33, SD = 12.41
vs. M = 45.24, SD = 13.62; F(1, 7,018) = 45.24, included
more women, 55% vs. 47%; c2(1, N = 7,070) = 47.20, and
more people with 3 years of college or more, 48% vs. 36%;
c2(1, N = 7,120) = 100.4, all p's < .01. Using T-standardized
scores (for details, see below), we also found that longitu-
dinal participants reported at baseline slightly more
control, M = 50.36, SD = 9.72 vs. M = 49.41, SD = 10.42;
F(1, 6,208) = 13.42; R2 = .002, better health,
M = 50.47, SD = 9.48 vs. M = 49.21, SD = 10.76; F(1, 6,208) =
23.17; R2 = .004, and more support, M = 50.48, SD = 9.60
vs. M = 49.22, SD = 10.59; F(1, 6,208) = 23.24; R2 = .004,
all p's < .01.
Measures
Perceived control was measured using a unit-weighted
composite of four items assessing personal mastery and
eight items assessing perceived constraints (for details, see
Lachman & Firth, 2004). Participants were asked to indi-
cate the extent to which they agreed with each of the items
(e.g., "What happens to me in the future mostly depends on
me."), using a 7-point scale (1 = "strongly agree" and 7 =
"strongly disagree"). Mastery items were reverse coded, so
that higher scores reflect perceiving more control (a  .85 at
both occasions).
Health was measured using a composite of chronic health
conditions, acute conditions, and the number of functional
limitations. Chronic conditions were self-reports of the
number of chronic medical conditions from a comprehen-
sive list of 29 health conditions (e.g., asthma, thyroid
disease, migraine headaches, ulcer, hay fever, and stroke)
participants had experienced or been treated for in the past
twelve months. For acute conditions, participants rated how
often they experienced each of nine physical symptoms
during the past thirty days (e.g., lower backaches, trouble
getting to sleep or staying asleep, and sweating a lot).
Functional limitations represent the sum across items ask-
ing whether respondents had experienced any limitations in
carrying out eight (instrumental) activities of daily living
(e.g., bathing; climbing; walking). To compute a compre-
hensive measure of multiple aspects of health, standardized
means across the three variables were aggregated and
reverse coded, with higher scores reflecting better health
(a  .71 at both occasions; for details, see Röcke & Lachman,
2008).
Social support was assessed with 24 items, 8 of which
asked about the social support and social strain (but not de-
pendency) associated with each of three sources, spouse/
partner, family, and friends. Participants were asked to an-
swer each item (e.g., "How much does your partner appre-
ciate you?", "How often does your partner criticize you?")
using a 4-point scale (1 = "a lot" and 4 = "not at all"). Support
items were reverse coded, so that higher scores reflect stron-
ger support (a  .85 at both occasions; for details, see Walen
& Lachman, 2000).
To examine whether the strengths of across-domain asso-
ciations differed by sociodemographic strata of age, gender,
and education, we opted for a statistically thorough, yet
straightforward and parsimonious multigroup approach. To
ensure sufficiently large group sizes, we used cutoffs at age
60 at the first occasion (young and middle aged: N = 4,967
vs. old age: N = 1,243) and 3 or more years of college (less
education: N = 3,464 vs. more education: N = 2,746), re-
spectively, to contrast groups of different age and education.
We note that determining the cutoff points for dividing the
adult life span into distinct age periods is always somewhat
arbitrary. Because of continuous demographic shifts in
work life and general life expectancies in industrialized
countries, precise transition ages are difficult to define. In

our analyses, we follow earlier approaches using age 60
years as approximating the end of midlife and the start of
young old age (for discussion, see Lachman & Firth, 2004).
The approach also provided the benefit of obtaining two
subsamples with reasonably large size. We also carried out
follow-up analyses that used different split ups of the groups
(i.e., ages 55, 65, and 70 years as the cutoff) and found the
same substantive pattern of results as reported in the text.
Data Preparation and Statistical Procedure
To ensure a common metric across variables, measures
were standardized to a T metric (M = 50; SD = 10 at base-
line). Intercorrelations and descriptive information for our
measures are presented in Table 1. For example, across-
domain correlations were sizeable both between baseline
levels (e.g., rcontrol.T1 ­ health.T1 = .37) and between levels at
baseline and nine years later (e.g., rcontrol.T1 ­ health.T2 = .30).
We also note mean-level changes, which we corroborated
by separate analyses of variance with two repeated mea-
sures (T1 and T2). Largely consistent with extant reports
(Aldwin et al., 2006; Mirowsky, 1995; Shaw, Krause,
Liang, & Bennett, 2007), our analyses revealed average
stability in perceived control (p > .10) as well as average
declines in health, F(1, 3,847) = 1,027.97, p < .01, partial h2 =
.211, and average increases in social support, F(1, 3,847) =
122.90, p < .01, partial h2 = .031. Our focus, however, was
not on these prototypical two-wave changes over a 9-year
period but on examining between-person differences in
across-domain associations. We targeted this objective us-
ing a contemporary technique in developmental inquiry,
CS models (see McArdle, 2009; McArdle & Nesselroade,
1994).
In CS models, the effect of variable X at T1 (XT1) on vari-
able X at T2 (XT2) is constrained to a value of 1. As a conse-
quence, some part of XT2 is exactly identical to XT1, and the
residual portion DX is explicitly parameterized and directly

interpretable as the raw change score. Importantly, this
change score is unobserved but as a latent variable directly
related to the observation (Bollen, 2002). We generated a
change score independent of initial level by regressing la-
tent change DX on initial level XT1. To address our research
questions, we estimate a conjoint change score model of the
three domains and inspect the direction and size of two sets
of parameters. For the first question, we consider the simul-
taneously estimated regression weights that each factor at
T1 has on the latent changes. These signify the predictive
and reciprocal associations between control beliefs, health,
and social support at baseline and two-wave change. For the
second question, the change scores are allowed to correlate
so as to represent across-domain correlations between con-
current changes. We also used statistically nested model
comparisons and the resulting loss in overall model fit (as
indexed by the c2 difference per df) to evaluate whether or
not the size of a given parameter estimate differs between
sociodemographic groups. Models were fit to the data using
Mplus (Muthén & Muthén, 1998­2006). We applied full in-
formation maximum likelihood estimation algorithms to all
data points available, which allowed treating incomplete
data as missing at random (Little & Rubin, 1987).
Results
Antecedent­Consequent Relations of Perceived Control
to Health and Social Support
Results are presented in Figure 1. To begin with baseline
levels, there was a positive manifold of considerable size
between perceiving greater control, better initial health,
and more social support (e.g., scontrol.T1 ­ health.T1 = .37;
shealth.T1 ­ social.T1 = .23). Most important for our question is
the prediction of two-wave change. Greater perceived con-
trol at baseline was predictive of less pronounced declines
in health (b = .12) and stronger increases in social support
(b = .10). To illustrate, Figure 2 graphs a scatterplot of
perceived control and subsequent health changes and shows
that participants who reported a strong sense of control at
baseline, on average, were more likely to maintain health
or to decline less.
In addition, between-person differences in perceived
control changes were uniquely predicted by baseline levels
of both health and support. Specifically, increasing per-
ceived control over time was independently predicted by
both better initial health (b = .12) and more initial support
(b = .09). In contrast, there were no across-domain associa-
tions between initial levels and subsequent changes in
health and support. Results from the CS model thus provide
evidence for reciprocal antecedent­consequent relations of
perceived control to health and social support. Sense of con-
trol was directly and independently predictive of subsequent
changes in health and support, and in turn, change in control
was predicted by previous levels of health and support. The

magnitude of the standardized path coefficients, however,
was in the range of small effect sizes.
The Nature and Correlates of Multidirectional Across-
Domain Associations
Our second objective was to inspect the correlated
changes and examine whether the strengths of associations
differed between the sets of domains considered and across
sociodemographic groups. To begin with the size of corre-
lated changes reported in Figure 1, one can see positive and
sizeable associations of between-person differences in rates
of change across domains. Reports of increasing control
over time were accompanied by less pronounced declines in
health (r = .17) and stronger increases in support (r = .22).
To illustrate, Figure 3 shows a scatterplot of concurrent
changes in perceived control and social support, indicating
that participants who experienced increased support over
time were, on average, more likely to report more perceived
control as well. Both Figures 2 and 3 highlight the tremen-
dous amount of between-person heterogeneity. A small and
significant correlation was also found between changes in
health and changes in support (r = .07).
In a final step, we examined if and how across-domain
relations differed by age, gender, and education. To do so, we
compared a baseline model (estimating all parameters freely
in all age, gender, and education groups) in a hierarchical
fashion with models that constrained all variances to be equal
Figure 1. Results from a change score (CS) model as applied to two-wave 9-year longitudinal Midlife in the United States survey data of control beliefs, health,
and social support. Means, intercepts, and variances were omitted for clarity. Unlabelled unidirectional paths set to 1.
across groups, set all covariances and regressions invariant,
and estimated all fixed effects to be invariant. Results of
these analyses are reported in Table 2.Age comparative anal-
yses revealed highly significant losses of model fit when we
fixed the average levels of functioning to be of equal size
between young and middle-aged adults versus older adults (
Row 5). As one would expect, follow-up analyses indicated
that, for example, older adults were on average in poorer
health relative to young and middle-aged adults. Most im-
portant for our question, setting the size of across-domain
associations to be invariant across age groups revealed a
small but statistically reliable difference (Row 4). We note,
however, that the loss in c2 per df was considerably weaker
than for setting either means or variances to be age invariant.
As it turned out, the magnitude of age differences in across-
domain associations was indeed relatively small, amounting
to less than a 0.1 difference (e.g., bcontrol.T1 ­ social.D = .09 vs.
.07). Our model comparisons by gender (Rows 6 through 10)
revealed gender differences in average levels (e.g., poorer
health for women) and variances (e.g., more variability in
health among women) but most importantly, no significant
loss in model fit when setting across-domain relations invari-
ant across men and women. Analyses of education differ-
ences indicated reliable differences in across-domain
associations (Rows 11 through 15), but their absolute size
was rather minimal, and no single group difference exceeded
a 0.1 difference (e.g., bcontrol.T1 ­ social.D = .06 vs. .11 in the less
well and well-educated groups, respectively).

maintain health or to decline less. The figure also highlights the tremendous amount of between-person heterogeneity. Data presented in T scores (M = 50 and
SD = 10).
In sum, we found that changes in control beliefs were ac-
companied by concurrent changes in the other two domains,
and associations involving control were somewhat larger in
size than those between health and support.Analyses target-
ing sociodemographic characteristics indicated statisti-
cally significant differences for age and education, but the
size of these differences was relatively small, suggesting
that change relationships were relatively consistent across
subgroups.
Discussion
Our objective was to examine antecedent­consequent re-
lations of perceived control to health and social support
across the adult age range. Applying CS models to two-
occasion data over 9 years of 6,210 MIDUS participants
revealed evidence in line with our guiding conceptual
framework that unique and independent multidirectional re-
lations exist (Lachman, 2006). Consistent with the view of
an antecedent role of control beliefs, we found that greater
initial perceived control independently predicted weaker
declines in health and stronger increases in social support.
In turn, consistent with the view of a consequent role of
control, our analyses revealed that subsequent increases in
perceived control were predicted by better initial health and
more initial support. Addressing the nature and correlates of
such multidomain associations, we found that changes in
control were accompanied by concurrent changes in the
other two domains. The strength of these relations differed
by age and education, but differences were small in size. We
take our results to suggest that perceived control serves as
both a precursor and a consequence of health and social
support across adulthood and old age, and we highlight
routes for further inquiry to thoroughly address questions
about developmental ordering.
Antecedent­Consequent Relations of Perceived Control to
Health and Social Support
In line with conceptual and empirical work, the present
study reports sizeable associations and a positive manifold
across domains of perceived control, health, and social sup-
port (Antonucci, 2001; Krause & Shaw, 2003). We corrobo-
rate and provide empirical evidence for our guiding
framework (Lachman, 2006), suggesting that perceived
control serves both antecedent and consequent functions.
Our findings add to the literature by examining all three do-
mains conjointly and demonstrating that such relations ex-
tend beyond the typically reported mean-level associations
and generalize to longitudinal change.
To begin with, our results illustrate that perceived control
represents an important predictor for key indicators of
CHANGES IN PERCEIVED CONTROL, HEALTH, AND SUPPORT 67
adaptation, namely both levels of and long-term changes in
health and social support. Our longitudinal findings extend
the time frame over which buffering effects of control be-
liefs against health declines have been reported from 1.5
years in the EPESE (Mendes de Leon, Seeman, Baker,
Richardson, & Tinetti, 1996) and 2.5 years in the MacArthur
Successful Aging studies (Seeman et al., 1999) to an average
of 9 years. Conjointly, these findings are consistent with no-
tions suggesting that a strong sense of control may help peo-
ple to engage in and maintain health-promoting behaviors
(e.g., exercise, preventive care; Rodin, 1986). Our results also
endorse and illustrate theories of control (e.g., Heckhausen &
Schulz, 1995) according to which control beliefs allow peo-
ple to mobilize social support, particularly in times of strain.
Considering perceptions of control as a consequence, one
important finding was that preserved physical health indeed
constitutes a unique source for between-person differences
in control. Individuals in good health were not only more
likely to feel in control initially but also to report a gain in
their sense of control over time. It is conceivable that better
health provides more opportunities to experience self-related
mastery and thus not only helps maintaining but also build-
ing one's sense of personal mastery and control. Similarly
important, we found supportive relationships with one's
family to have long-term beneficial effects for feelings of
control and an increase therein. These findings offer em-
pirical evidence for theoretical accounts proposing that
various forms of social support represent prime sources for
feelings of control across the adult age range (Antonucci &
Jackson, 1987). For example, support may convey the sense
that people can count on someone if needed, which likely
nurtures a sense of efficacy and control. Similarly, observ-
ing a close network member enacting a certain workout reg-
imen may enhance one's own sense of efficacy to carry out
and persist with the regimen (Bandura, 1997). It was be-
yond the scope and possibilities of our study to explore
these and other possible mechanisms, so future studies ad-
dressing such pathways are warranted.
The Nature and Correlates of Multidirectional Across-
Domain Associations
Our results about the nature and correlates of multido-
main relations correspond with notions that control beliefs
are indeed embedded in a complex and pervasive system of
reciprocal influences and may play a central role in this
context. Of course, a comprehensive empirical test was not
possible with two waves of data, but our findings neverthe-
less provide useful initial insights on which future more
mechanism-oriented studies may capitalize and elaborate.
As a first result, we found that changes in feelings of con-
trol were accompanied by functionally meaningful changes
in the social and health domains. This finding is important
in and of itself. It illustrates that a positive cross-domain

control as well. The figure also highlights the tremendous amount of between-person heterogeneity. Data presented in T scores (M = 50 and SD = 10).

manifold not only exists between levels of functioning but
also between age-related changes in those domains. Gener-
ally speaking, our results point to the importance of opting
for a dynamic and systemic perspective when attempting to
better understand level and change in perceptions of control
across adulthood. One may argue, for example, that a lack
of or declines in perceived availability of social support
may threaten personal belief systems about control (e.g.,
Antonucci & Jackson, 1987; Lang et al., 1997), which in
turn may have negative consequences for well-being and
health (House, Landis, & Umberson, 1988). A major point
implicated in our findings is exactly the apparent need for
more research addressing such questions about the develop-
mental ordering and reciprocal dynamics among the various
domains involved.
Second, our findings can also be taken to indicate the
substantial role the variables included play for determining
between-person differences in the three-variable system un-
der consideration. At the same time, we found that associa-
tions involving perceived control were reliably different
from zero, whereas those between health and social support
were not. This result needs replication and extension, but
we take this pattern to highlight that a sense of control may
play a key role in the well-documented relations between
social support and health (for overview, see Berkman et al.,
2000; Rook, 1995). One pivotal next step to illuminate this
role would be to extend cross-sectional reports (Bisconti &
Bergeman, 1999) and examine if perceived control indeed
mediates (fully or partially) longitudinal relations among
social support and health. Establishing such effects also has
major implications for the refinement of health prevention
and intervention programs (e.g., attempting to boost percep-
tions of control).
Finally, the strength of across-domain relations was
found to differ by age and education, but differences were
small in size. In essence, the general pattern was very simi-
lar with some associations being slightly more pronounced
in one group or another. These findings suggest that cross-
domain linkages between levels and changes in perceived
control, health, and support are largely independent of and
pervasive across a broad range of sociodemographic strata.
From an intervention perspective, these are promising find-
ings because they highlight that boosting one variable (e.g.,
control) may also have enhancing implications for the other
two variables (e.g., health, support), irrespective of the pre-
ceding functional level. In contrast, however, declines in
control appear to be foreshadowed by losses in health and
support. More work is needed to better understand the pos-
sible role of mediating events (e.g., disability, widowhood)
and if and how control beliefs can be guarded against the
effects of such age-related declines. At the same time, we
note several factors in our study that may have contributed
to the relative lack of differential associations. To start with,
previous work on the importance of sociodemographics has
primarily been cross-sectional and focused on level,
whereas our study was longitudinal in nature and focused
on long-term changes. Similarly, including more process-
oriented variables such as social relations as additional pre-
dictors in our analyses may have left relatively little variance
to be explained by more macro sociodemographic charac-
teristics. We also acknowledge that further in-depth studies
targeting potentially important nuances may provide useful
qualifications to our results. For example, it appears con-
ceivable that control­health relations are mediated by
adopting health-promoting behaviors (Mirowsky & Ross,
1998) that may reveal larger health-beneficial effects among
low-SES groups.
Limitations and Outlook
Applying CS models to two-wave data obtained from a
national sample across the adult age range provided for a
direct operational definition of our research questions and
revealed initial insights into reciprocal across-domain asso-
ciations. However, we note several limitations of our study.
With only two waves of data (and modeling manifest vari-
ables), CS models are not distinguishable from and reveal
the same set of findings as more traditional autoregressive
models, which can produce biased results if the variables
under scrutiny are differentially reliable and (or) stable over

Notes: In the age group model, young and middle-aged adults (aged 24­59
years at T1; N = 4,967) were compared with older adults (aged 60­75 years at
T1; N = 1,243). In the gender model, men (N = 2,949) were compared with
women (N = 3,261). In the education groups model, persons with lower educa-
tional achievement (less than 3 years of college; N = 3,464) were compared with
persons with higher educational achievement (3 or more years of college; N =

CHANGES IN PERCEIVED CONTROL, HEALTH, AND SUPPORT 69
time (Rogosa, 1980). It is thus imperative to replicate and
extend any directional interpretations with more rigorous
methodologies (e.g., dynamic modeling tools; McArdle &
Hamagami, 2001). We note that these methods typically
require data being collected over three or more waves to
fully remedy the weaknesses inherent in other approaches
(McArdle & Nesselroade, 1994, see Gerstorf, Lövdén,
Röcke, Smith, & Lindenberger, 2007).
Another set of limitations revolves around the specific-
ity of our findings. To begin with, we note that the aging
individual is not fully described by three variables. Includ-
ing additional factors (e.g., cognitive functioning, well-
being: Lachman, 2006) may thus help to better understand
how across-domain associations observed in this study are
embedded in other complex systems of influence. In addi-
tion, our social support measure assessed aspects of sup-
port rather than dependency (e.g., emotional or financial)
and also did not distinguish if the support received was
indeed asked for and appreciated. This aspect is important
given previous reports that receiving more help than
wanted or needed may result in reduced feelings of control
and well-being (Newsom & Schulz, 1998; Rook, 1995).
We tapped this concern by replicating our pattern of find-
ings when we used a an inverse of social strain (Follow-up
analyses using various alternative indicators of our mea-
sures yielded substantively the same pattern of results as
reported in the text. Specifically, we have targeted (a) sepa-
rate measures for social support and social strain rather
than a combined variable as the social support indicator as
well as separate measures for the three sources of support
and strain (spouse/partner, family, and friends), (b) sepa-
rate measures of acute health conditions, chronic health
conditions, and number of functional limitations rather
than the unit-weighted composite across the three vari-
ables, and (c) income rather than education as the socio-
economic indicator. We additionally carried out follow-up
analyses (d) including linear interaction variables of the
three T1 indicators with either age or education in the pre-
diction of two-wave 9-year changes.), but a more detailed
examination of this possibility is warranted. Also, it would
be instructive to explore the extent to which between-person
associations revealed by two-wave data over 9 years are
similar to within-person associations revealed by data
collected over many more, relatively closely spaced occa-
sions (e.g., Röcke, Li, & Smith, 2009). It is also an open
question whether or not the associations observed general-
ize to an age-based time metric, can be found over much
shorter time frames, such as weeks or months, and if do-
main-specific control (e.g., feeling capable of eliciting de-
sirable social or health outcomes) would have generated
stronger effects in the respective domain (see Lang et al.,
1997). A similarly promising route for future inquiry is
whether across-domain dynamics different from those
found in this primarily midlife and old age sample may
emerge very late in life when individuals often approach
critically low levels of health (see Gerstorf, Ram, Röcke,
Lindenberger, & Smith, 2008).
Our study represents an initial effort to conjointly exam-
ine antecedent­consequent relations between level and lon-
gitudinal change across perceived control, health, and social
support. We have shown that perceived control facilitates
adaptive functioning and helps to sustain and enrich one's
multidomain resources. At the same time, physical and
interpersonal resources such as good health and social
support are linked to the availability as well as gains in psy-
chological resources, such as perceived control. Our study
thus provides further impetus to thoroughly examine pro-
cesses involved in antecedent­consequent relations of con-
trol beliefs to health and social support.
