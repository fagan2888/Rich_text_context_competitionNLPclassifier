Because of the long half-life of lead stored in bone (years), skeletal lead stores may be a source of endogenous
lead exposure during periods of increased bone demineralization, such as menopause. To test the hypothesis
that postmenopausal bone resorption increases blood lead levels, the authors examined cross-sectional
associations of bone density-related factors with blood lead levels among women aged 40­59 years from the
Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (1988­1994). Factors related to bone turnover were
significant predictors of blood lead level. Bone mineral density was significantly inversely related to blood lead
levels in log-linear multivariate models that adjusted for age, race/ethnicity, smoking, education, household
income, alcohol use, and residence (urban/rural). With menopausal status added to the model, naturally and
surgically menopausal women had adjusted median blood lead levels that were 25% and 30% higher,
respectively, than those of premenopausal women (2.0 µg/dl). Current use of hormone replacement therapy was
associated with significantly lower adjusted median blood lead levels (1.8 µg/dl) than past use (2.6 µg/dl) and
never use (2.2 µg/dl). Lead stored in bone may significantly increase blood lead levels in perimenopausal women
because of postmenopausal bone mineral resorption. Attention to factors that prevent bone loss may lessen or
prevent this endogenous lead exposure.

Despite major reductions in environmental lead exposure
for much of the US population (1), lead poisoning remains a
significant public health problem (2). While young children
and some adults continue to be at risk from exogenous
sources of lead exposure, new evidence suggests that some
persons may be at risk for recurring endogenous exposure to
lead previously accumulated over time in the skeleton (3­6).
Like calcium, lead is a bone-seeking element. Over 90
percent of the total burden of lead in the body resides in the
skeleton, where it has a half-life on the order of years to
decades (7­10). Thus, exposure to lead over the course of a
lifetime results in accumulation of lead in the skeletal
compartment (11­13) such that bone lead levels are gener-
ally higher among older persons (14). Of particular concern
is the potential for renewed exposure to lead released from
bone in older persons who were excessively exposed to envi-
ronmental lead, by current standards, prior to its removal
from gasoline (1978­1990) and paint (1977) (15).
The human skeleton is a dynamic physiologic compart-
ment of mineral metabolism. Mineral absorption and resorp-
tion are affected by many factors, including age, diet,
weight-bearing activity, trauma, metabolic disorders,

hormonal status, pregnancy, lactation, and menopause (16­
20). In response to these factors, both lead and calcium are
deposited in the skeleton and may act similarly (4, 21, 22).
Lead competes with calcium for transport and binding sites,
and when calcium is released from bone, lead is also liber-
ated (23­30). Additionally, lead does not accumulate
uniformly throughout the skeleton but is selectively taken up
at different sites and in different types of bone (e.g., trabec-
ular bone more than cortical bone) (8, 26, 31, 32). These
events may be of particular importance to women because of
the changing dynamics of bone mineral metabolism related
to events such as pregnancy, lactation, and menopause (33,
34). Over her lifetime, a woman loses up to 50 percent of
trabecular bone and 30 percent of cortical bone, and 30­50
percent of this bone loss occurs in the early postmenopausal
years (35­39). Estrogen deficiency appears to play a signifi-
cant role in bone loss (37, 40), and hormone replacement
therapy (HRT) after menopause has been shown to prevent
bone loss (38, 41­46) or even increase bone density (47).
There is mounting observational evidence that lead may be
mobilized from the skeleton during periods of increased
bone demineralization, such as pregnancy and lactation (48­
51), very old age (52), and menopause (3, 6, 53, 54).
Increases in blood lead associated with menopause are of
concern because recent research has linked lead in the blood,
at levels previously thought to be safe, to a number of
adverse health outcomes in adults, including increased blood
pressure (55­58), reduced kidney function (59), decrements
in neurocognitive function (60, 61), and increased risks of
atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease mortality (62).
Two cross-sectional studies of US women that used data
from the Second National Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey (NHANES II; 1976­1980) and the Hispanic Health
and Nutrition Examination Survey (1982­1984) docu-
mented that postmenopausal women have significantly
higher blood lead levels than premenopausal women, after
results are controlled for age and other factors related to
exogenous lead exposure (3, 6). A cross-sectional study
conducted in the early 1990s found an inverse relation
between blood lead levels and bone-related factors,
including menopause (63). Another study also identified
menopausal status as an independent predictor of blood lead
levels in a random sample of Scandinavian women (53).
However, these studies were carried out at a time when envi-
ronmental exposures and population blood lead levels were
much higher than they are at present. More recently, among
perimenopausal women from the Nurses' Health Study who
were not using HRT, investigators found higher blood lead
levels and observed that bone lead was more strongly associ-
ated with blood lead in comparison with current HRT users
(64). In a study of women from the Third National Health
and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III), Nash et
al. (58) reported the association between blood lead and dia-
stolic hypertension to be most pronounced in postmeno-
pausal women. A recent study of women in Mexico City,
Mexico, where environmental exposure to lead is high,
found no association between blood lead and bone mineral
density (BMD) (65). However, to our knowledge, the associ-
ation has never been examined in the context of lower envi-
ronmental lead exposures, where the contribution of
endogenous lead to blood lead may be more relevant.
The goal of this investigation was to test whether BMD
and other factors related to bone status (menopausal status,
time since menopause, and use of HRT) are associated with
blood lead levels in ways consistent with the hypothesis that
postmenopausal bone density loss results in increased
endogenous lead exposure in the context of low exogenous
exposure to lead.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study population
The study population included adult females from
NHANES III. NHANES III comprised a cross-sectional
population sample that was obtained through a complex
survey design and was intended to be representative of the
US civilian, noninstitutionalized population. Over a 6-year
period (1988­1994), participants took part in a household
survey interview and an in-depth physical examination with
laboratory tests. Other details on the survey design have been
published by the National Center for Health Statistics (66).
The present investigation focused on the 2,575 women
aged 40­59 years who took part in the NHANES III survey
interview. From this group, women were excluded for the
following reasons: 212 did not undergo physical examina-
tion or blood testing; 77 did not have information on blood
lead levels; 181 had bone density measurements that were
considered unreliable by the technicians performing the
dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry; and 70 had an indetermi-
nate menopausal status because of missing information. A
further 121 women of ethnicities other than non-Hispanic
Black, non-Hispanic White, and Mexican-American were
excluded because of low numbers in any single category of
self-reported ethnicity. The remaining 1,914 women consti-
tuted the sample used in the present analyses.
Definitions
Blood lead. Blood samples were obtained by venipunc-
ture from all adult participants during the physical examina-
tion. Blood lead was measured by graphite furnace atomic
absorption spectrophotometry at the laboratories of the
Center for Environmental Health, Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (Atlanta, Georgia). The assay detec-
tion limit was 1.0 µg/dl. Each sample analysis was
performed in duplicate, and the average of both measure-
ments was used in these analyses. Persons with blood lead
levels less than 1.0 µg/dl (n = 201) were assigned a value of
0.5 µg/dl for consistency with previous analyses of
NHANES III data by other investigators (2).
Covariates. Information on race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic
Black, non-Hispanic White, or Mexican-American), age
(years), smoking (current, former, or never), household
income, and education was obtained from the household
interview. The poverty income ratio, a ratio of household
income to the federal poverty-level income (for a given
family size, adjusted to the poverty threshold for the year of
the interview), was used to create a three-level household
BMD-related Predictors of Blood Lead Level in Women 903

income variable. A participant was assigned a household
income level above the poverty line if the poverty income
ratio was greater than 1 and a household income level at or
below the poverty line if the poverty income ratio was less
than or equal to 1; data were considered missing if the survey
participant did not report household income. A four-level
education variable was created on the basis of the number of
years of education reported by the survey participant: less
than high school (<12 years), completion of high school (12
years), some college (>12­<16 years), and completion of
college or more (16 years). A dichotomous variable based
on area of residence (urban/rural) was also included.
Information on participants' alcohol use (frequency and
amount consumed per week) was obtained using the exami-
nation-associated interview questionnaire. A four-level cate-
gorical variable for weekly alcohol intake was created, with
the following levels: none; <1 drink per week; 1­<3 drinks
per week; and 3 drinks per week.
Menopausal status. A variable was created to categorize
women as premenopausal (ovarian function intact), surgi-
cally menopausal (both ovaries removed surgically before

cessation of menses), or naturally menopausal (nonsurgical
loss of ovarian function). Participants without a history of
reproductive surgery were classified as premenopausal if
they reported having had a menstrual period during the
previous 12 months and postmenopausal if they did not,
consistent with World Health Organization criteria. Women
who had undergone a hysterectomy (without ovariectomy)
that coincided with the date of the last menstrual period were
assigned a menopausal classification on the basis of age (<51
years, premenopausal; 51 years, naturally menopausal).
Women without a history of hysterectomy or ovariectomy
who were current users of HRT were classified in the same
way. Women who had undergone bilateral ovariectomy that
coincided with the date of the last menstrual period were
classified as surgically menopausal. Women who had under-
gone hysterectomy or ovariectomy after the date of the last
menstrual period were classified as naturally menopausal.
HRT status. Women were classified as current users, past
users, or never users of HRT on the basis of self-reported
data from the examination questionnaire. Duration of HRT
use in years was also ascertained by self-report at the time of
the examination.
Time since menopause. Information on time since
menopause was estimated as the difference in years between
age at the time of the NHANES interview and self-reported
age at the time of the last menstrual period or ovariectomy,
whichever came first. Women aged 51 years or more whose
last menstrual period coincided with hysterectomy were
assumed to be postmenopausal.
Bone mineral density. BMD was measured in five
regions of the femur by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry in
the NHANES III medical examination: femoral neck, inter-
trochanter, trochanter, Ward's triangle, and total. All five
measurements were examined in bivariate analyses of BMD
and blood lead level. For multivariate analyses, the BMD
value from the trochanter region was used.
Statistical methods
The associations of blood lead level with trochanter BMD,
menopause, time since menopause, and HRT were modeled
using multiple linear regression, controlling for other factors
related to blood lead level. Because the distribution of blood
lead values was nonnormal, as has been found by other
investigators using NHANES data and other data sets (2), we
used natural logarithmic transformation of the blood lead
variable in multiple linear regression analyses. Covariates
included age, race/ethnicity, smoking, education, household
income, alcohol use, and residence.

The statistical analyses were conducted using SAS (67),
incorporating the examination sampling weights and survey
design of NHANES III (66). Tests for trend for categorical
variables were carried out in regression models by coding
levels as integers (scores) and evaluating tests for the proba-
bility that the slope of the regression line was nonzero.
SUDAAN statistical software (68) was used to calculate
standard errors for the estimates, accounting for both the
weights and the complex survey design. All estimates
presented here were calculated incorporating the sampling
weights. Adjusted geometric mean blood lead levels were
obtained using the LSMEANS statement in SUDAAN.
RESULTS
Sample characteristics
A demographic description of the sample is provided in
table 1. The distribution of menopausal status among women
aged 40­59 years varied significantly by race/ethnicity (p =
0.0136). As compared with White women, non-Hispanic
Blacks appeared to be overrepresented among surgically
menopausal women, whereas non-Hispanic Whites and
Mexican Americans were slightly underrepresented. The
mean age of the sample was 48.1 years, and, as expected,
menopausal status was strongly correlated with age. Post-
menopausal women were more likely to abstain from weekly
alcohol use (by self-report) and less likely to have a college
education than premenopausal women.
Distributions of data on BMD and other bone density-
related factors
Menopausal status was significantly associated with BMD
measurements from all five regions of the femur (p <
0.0001), with premenopausal women having a higher BMD
than surgically and naturally menopausal women (table 2).
Postmenopausal women were more likely than premeno-
pausal women to be either current or past users of HRT (p <
0.0001). Current users of HRT had been undergoing HRT
for a longer amount of time than past users (a mean of 6
years vs. 2.9 years). Current users of HRT who were meno-
pausal had the longest duration of HRT use (6.9 years).
Surgically menopausal women were, on average, further
away in time from menopause than naturally menopausal
women (12.7 years vs. 9.5 years; p < 0.0001).
Blood lead levels for bone density-related predictor
variables
Premenopausal women had a geometric mean blood lead
level of 1.9 µg/dl, as compared with 2.7 µg/dl and 2.9 µg/dl
for surgically menopausal women and naturally menopausal
women, respectively (table 3). Current users of HRT had a
lower geometric mean blood lead level than women who
reported never having used HRT (1.9 µg/dl vs. 2.2 µg/dl).
Past users of HRT had a geometric mean blood lead level of
3.0 µg/dl. Women who had never used HRT and women
who had used HRT for at least 1 year had lower mean blood
lead levels than women who had been using HRT for less
than 1 year. Relative to premenopausal women, geometric
mean blood lead levels peaked among women who were 0­2
years past menopause and were lowest among postmeno-
pausal women who were 9 or more years beyond meno-
pause. Blood lead levels were significantly related to
menopausal status and BMD. In bivariate analyses, BMD
measured in all five regions of the femur was significantly
inversely associated with blood lead level (table 4).
Age-stratified analyses
Compared with premenopausal women of the same age,
postmenopausal women had significantly higher geometric
mean blood lead levels in every age group (figure 1), with
the greatest differences being observed in the group aged
45­49 years. In addition, for every age category, current
users of HRT had lower geometric mean blood lead levels
than past or never users (figure 2).

Multivariable analyses
BMD in the trochanter region was significantly inversely
associated with blood lead level (natural log), even after
adjustment for age, ethnicity, residence, household income,
smoking, and alcohol use (table 5, model with BMD only). A
one-unit change in BMD was associated with a 0.6-µg/dl
lower geometric mean blood lead level. Age was positively
associated with blood lead. Non-Hispanic Blacks had signif-
icantly higher blood lead levels than non-Hispanic Whites.
Persons living in urban or suburban areas had higher blood
lead levels than those living in more rural areas. Having a
household income at or below the poverty line was associ-
ated with a significantly higher blood lead level than having
an income above the poverty line. Education was not signif-
icantly associated with blood lead. Nonusers of alcohol had
significantly lower blood lead levels than frequent users.
Current and former smokers had significantly higher blood
lead levels than persons who had never smoked.
Menopausal status. When menopausal status was added
to the model, the association of BMD with blood lead (log-
transformed) remained significant. Differences in blood lead
level between pre- and postmenopausal women also with-
stood multivariable adjustment for the established predictors
of blood lead level (table 5, model with BMD and meno-
pausal status). Naturally menopausal women had a signifi-
cantly higher geometric mean blood lead level than
premenopausal women (2.5 µg/dl vs. 2.0 µg/dl; p = 0.0126)
after adjustment for age, race/ethnicity, urban/rural resi-
dence, household income, educational level, alcohol use, and

smoking status. Surgically menopausal women also had a
significantly higher adjusted blood lead level than premeno-
pausal women (2.6 µg/dl vs. 2.0 µg/dl; p = 0.0009).
HRT use. HRT use was significantly associated with log
blood lead level in a model that adjusted for BMD, meno-
pausal status, and other covariates (table 5, model with
BMD, menopausal status, and HRT). The addition of HRT to
the model did not materially alter the association of BMD or
menopausal status with blood lead level. Among postmeno-
pausal women, never users of HRT had a significantly higher
adjusted geometric mean blood lead level than women who
were currently using HRT (2.2 µg/dl vs. 1.8 µg/dl; p =
0.0006). Former users of HRT also had a significantly higher
adjusted blood lead level than current users (2.6 µg/dl vs. 1.8
µg/dl; p = 0.0004).
Time since menopause. Time (years) since menopause
was a significant predictor of blood lead level among women
who were not current users of HRT (table 5, model with time
since menopause). Postmenopausal women who were closer
in time to the last menstrual period tended to have signifi-
cantly higher blood lead levels than both premenopausal
women and postmenopausal women who were further away
in time (9 years) from the menopausal transition.
DISCUSSION
These analyses suggest that menopause and bone status
are predictors of blood lead level among women aged 40­59
years in the US population. BMD was significantly inversely
associated with blood lead level after adjustment for other
factors traditionally associated with blood lead. Menopausal
status and HRT use, both of which are associated with BMD,
were important predictors of blood lead level independently
of age and other factors. Despite recent declines in environ-
mental lead exposure, the estimated effects of menopause
observed in this study are similar to those reported for
NHANES II (1976­1980) by Silbergeld et al. (3) and later by
other investigators (6, 63, 65). Among women not currently
on HRT, time since menopause, a potential marker of bone
density loss, was significantly associated with blood lead,
with postmenopausal women closer in time to the meno-
pausal transition tending to have higher blood lead levels
than those further away from menopause. These associations
withstood multivariate adjustment for current BMD, race/
ethnicity, age, smoking, alcohol use, education, household
income, and urbanicity. In the absence of HRT, time since
the menopausal transition was associated with bone
demineralization; these observations are consistent with the
hypothesis that bone demineralization increases the blood
lead levels of menopausal women.
To our knowledge, this study is the first to have examined
the relation between BMD measured by dual-energy x-ray
absorptiometry and blood lead level. A statistically signifi-
cant association between concurrent measurements of BMD
and blood lead level was observed after multivariate adjust-
ment for menopausal status. A low BMD measurement may
reflect either recent decline in BMD or longstanding bone
mineral status. It is possible that lead may affect BMD,
rather than BMD's affecting lead. Experimental studies in
rats demonstrate that the effects of lead in decreasing bone
growth and density are associated with perinatal exposures
(69, 70). Because of the cross-sectional design of NHANES
III, inferences about the temporal nature of any of the associ-
ations reported here cannot be made on the basis of these
data alone.

Women who were current users of HRT had adjusted blood
lead levels lower than those of past or never users, indepen-
dently of age. This observation is consistent with the findings
of other investigators (64) and supports the hypothesis that
blood lead levels among postmenopausal women are partly
driven by factors that affect bone loss. However, the possi-
bility cannot be ruled out that differing lead exposure profiles
between these groups of women were responsible for the
observed effect, despite our attempt to control for this through
multivariate adjustment for factors known to be associated
with lead exposure. Women who choose to use HRT may be
different from women who do not with regard to many health
behaviors and exposures, both known and unknown (71).
However, it is unlikely that this is the only explanation, since
no differences between former users and never users of HRT
were observed after multivariate adjustment.
Our results reinforce the possibility that blood lead stores
may represent an endogenous source of lead exposure.
Although the differences in average blood lead levels
reported here are relatively small, increases in blood lead by
these amounts may still pose a risk to women who experi-
ence significant bone loss or have higher bone lead levels at
the start of menopause. Moreover, small increases in blood
lead level are associated with decrements in neurocognitive
performance (72) and increased risks of atherosclerosis and
hypertension (57, 58, 73). Significant increases in risk of
peripheral arterial disease were reported in adults with
increases in blood lead within the range found in this study
(74).
The magnitude of postmenopausal changes in blood lead
level may depend on a number of factors, including the
amount and bioavailability of lead stored in bone prior to
menopause and the rate and magnitude of bone mineral loss.
Initial bone lead stores at menopause may differ among
different ethnic groups on the basis of prior exposures (2).
Moreover, there is evidence that BMD and rates of loss after
menopause may differ by ethnicity (75­77). Bone lead

measurements taken over time may provide additional
insights into these issues.
There is some evidence that lead mobilized from bone
stores may be preferentially partitioned into plasma as
compared with erythrocytes; this suggests that lead released
from bone may be more toxicologically relevant than lead
entering the bloodstream from environmental sources (78),
though there is also evidence to suggest that this is not the
case (79). If this is the case, increases in the release of endog-
enous lead may result in transfers of more lead to critical
compartments in soft tissue (10, 78). Although this theory
has not been proven directly, this observation may explain
recent findings that bone lead is more predictive of outcomes
such as hypertension in older persons than is blood lead (57,
80), as well as observations that the relation between blood
lead and diastolic hypertension appears to be stronger among
postmenopausal women (58). We recommend that investiga-
tors studying health outcomes associated with lead exposure
in women during the menopausal transition measure bone
lead levels in addition to blood lead levels.
