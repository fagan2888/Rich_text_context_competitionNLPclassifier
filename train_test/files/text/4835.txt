Introduction
Violence against women and girls is one of the most wide-
spread and least recognized human rights abuses in the world
(Cooperative for Assistance and Relief Everywhere [CARE],
2010). Globally, one out of three women will experience
sexual violence in their lifetime (World Health Organization
[WHO], 2005). Sexual violence is any sexual act that is
forced against someone's will. It includes coerced sex, sex-
ual abuse, rape, and attempted rape (WHO, 2002). Most
rapes are committed by persons known to the victim and
most victims of sexual violence prefer not to report
(McGregor, 2005; WHO, 2005). Sexual violence has severe
short-term and long-term consequences on women's physi-
cal and mental health (WHO, 2003). Rape carries a heavy
social stigma sometimes resulting in rejection by families
and communities (Alemika, 2013; WHO, 2002). Social atti-
tudes often condone violence against women and stigmatize
and blame the survivor. Many countries lack adequate health
and counseling services for survivors and strong mechanisms
for protection and legal redress (CARE, 2010).
All types of sexual abuse involve victims who do not con-
sent or who are unable to consent or refuse to allow the act.
Sexual abuse is a serious offense, yet discussion on the topic
is often avoided and the type of sexual abuse that is rarely
discussed is sexual exploitation of children and youth
(Kevonne & Janine, 2007). One of the most startling aspects
of these sex crimes is that many go unreported; therefore,
rape and sexual assault prevalence is difficult to determine
(WHO, 2002, 2003). In a study in Nigeria, it was reported
that only 22.9% of respondents who had experienced rape
reported the offense to the police (Alemika, 2013).
In the Nigerian criminal law, rape is defined as
unlawful carnal knowledge of a woman or girl without her
consent or with her consent if the consent is obtained by force or
by means of threat or intimidation of any kind, or by fear of
harm or by means of false and fraudulent representation as to the
nature of the act. (Criminal Code Act, 1990, S.357)
Despite the existence of the laws, Amnesty international
(2012) reported that "rape and other forms of sexual violence
against women and girls remains rife." The authorities con-
sistently fail to prevent and address sexual violence.
Adolescent girls are particularly vulnerable to sexual
abuse. The WHO (2005) has reported that "younger women,
especially those aged 15 to 19 years, are at higher risk of
sexual violence by a partner in almost all settings" (p. 8).

Sexual Violence Among Out-of-School
Female Adolescents in Lagos, Nigeria

Abstract
Sexual violence against females is a public health problem. This descriptive cross-sectional study sought to determine the
prevalence of sexual violence among out-of-school female adolescents in Lagos, Nigeria and examine the context in which
it occurs. Three hundred and fifty adolescents, between the ages of 10 and 19 years, working in Sandgrouse market, Lagos,
were selected using cluster sampling. Data were collected using an interviewer-administered questionnaire. Almost half
(42.9%) of the respondents have had sexual intercourse, and median age at initiation was 17 years. Forced initiation was
reported by 15.8%, and 36.3% reported that first intercourse was due to coercion. Among the sexually active, only 12.3%
stated that "it is what they desire." Majority of respondents (64.1%) believe that rape is common in their community, and
18% of the sexually active have experienced rape. Out-of-school adolescents in this community are at risk of sexual violence.
The factors that make them vulnerable need to be addressed.

Out-of-school adolescents are a highly vulnerable group.
Whereas the National Population Commission (NPC;
Nigeria) and ICF Macro (2009) documented a 6.6% preva-
lence rate of experience of sexual violence among girls (ages
15-19 years), a study conducted among out-of-school adoles-
cents in Iwaya, Lagos, Nigeria, reported that 18% of the girls
in the study population had experienced forced sex and 45%
of them had experienced statutory rape (Kunnuji & Esiet,
2015).
Nigeria has the largest number of out-of-school children
with a 58% net enrollment ratio for girls in primary school
and a net secondary attendance rate of 44% for females. Out-
of-school girls are from the poorest wealth quantiles (British
Council Nigeria, 2012). Poverty may further increase their
vulnerability to sexual violence. This study was conducted to
determine the prevalence of sexual coercion, abuse, and rape
among out-of-school adolescents in Lagos, Nigeria and to
describe the context in which this sexual violence occur.
Method
This descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted in
Sangrouse/Sura market, which is one of the major markets in
Lagos, Nigeria. A wide variety of items are sold in stalls
within the market with each item sold in designated sections
within the market. These sections are called "iso" and are
named according to what items are sold in that section of the
market. There are several out-of-school female adolescents
working or serving as apprentices in the market.
The study population was the female out-of-school ado-
lescents who were unmarried and between ages of 10 and 19
years working or serving as apprentices in the market. The
minimum sample size was estimated using the Cochran's
(1977) formula n = Z2PQ/D2.
The sampling method used was cluster sampling. The
market is grouped into sections ("iso") depending on the
items sold. Each section was taken as a cluster. There were
18 sections (clusters) in the market, including provisions sec-
tion, yam section, drinks section, ingredients/vegetable sec-
tion, and toiletries/cosmetics section. Using the clusters as
sampling units, our sample frame was the list of clusters. A
simple random sample of clusters was selected, and all the
units (eligible respondents) in the selected cluster were
recruited into the study. Eighty-three percent of clusters in
the market were surveyed. A representative sample of 350
respondents was recruited from the clusters to participate in
the study.
Data were collected using pretested questionnaires which
were administered by trained interviewers. The question-
naire comprised of four sections and was developed guided
by review of literature of studies on sexual violence. It con-
sisted of sixty questions to elicit information on socio demo-
graphic characteristics, sexual coercion, and violence. The
questionnaire was semi-structured and consisted mainly of
closed-ended questions. Ten female medical interviewers
were trained for 2 days to collect data. The questionnaire was
pretested in a similar market. Epi info 6 statistical software
was used for data entry and analysis. Ethical approval to con-
duct the study was obtained from the ethical committee of
the Lagos University Teaching Hospital. Informed consent
was obtained from the respondents' parents/guardians and
from all respondents.
Limitations
Appropriate measures were taken to reassure respondents of
confidentiality and maintain their privacy. However, because
of the sensitive nature of the questions asked, there might
have been some underreporting and respondents may have
given socially accepted responses. Only adolescents attached
to stalls were used to ensure a fairly stable population.
Therefore, the "mobile" adolescents who hawk goods in the
market were excluded from the study. However, they make
up a small minority of adolescents in the market.
Results
Three hundred fifty female adolescent respondents were
interviewed in the market. Majority (89.4%) were older ado-
lescents between the age of 15 and 19 years (Table 1). Mean
age was 17 years. Less than a third of respondents (29%) had
completed secondary school. The main reasons given for
why they were out of school was because they were unable
to afford the cost of formal education (33.0%). Less than half
of the respondents lived with their parents; 24.3% live with
both parents whereas 3.7% and 20.3% live with their father
or mother, respectively. The others live with employers, rela-
tives, and guardians and friends, whereas 2.9% live alone
(Table 1). One hundred ninety-four respondents (57.4%)
stated that they received enough money from their parents/
guardians to meet their basic needs. Some respondents
(35.2%) claimed that they are encouraged to find means to
supplement what their parents/guardians give.
Half of the respondents (50.6%) believed that sex was
only proper ("okay") among married people, and 35.1% felt
it is "okay" to have sex when dating steadily; 1.7% felt it was
"okay" among people who are dating occasionally, whereas
12.6% said they are not sure. None of the respondents con-
sidered sex as acceptable with a stranger or someone they
had just met. Almost half (42.9%) of respondents have had
sex (Figure 1). Majority of respondents who have had sexual
intercourse first had intercourse between the ages of 15 and
19 years. Median age at initiation was 16 years. A boyfriend
was the first sexual partner of majority of respondents
(93.6%). When asked for the reason for having sex for the
first time, only 43.8% said it was what they desired. Others
said it was because they felt they needed to do so to show
love/commitment to their partner (20.5%), whereas others
(15.8%) said they were forced by their sexual partners.
Others stated that they were pressurized into their first act of
Odeyemi et al. 3
sexual intercourse by their partners (6.8%), and for a few
others (2.7%), the reason for the first sexual encounter was to
receive gifts (Table 2).
Among the 150 respondents who have had sexual inter-
course, 134 were currently sexually active and 18.7% had
had more than one sexual partner in the preceding 6 months
before the study. Majority (77.9%) are having sex in the
belief that it is the way to express their love for their partner.
For 24.0%, it is because their partner demands it, and for
7.8%, the reason is "because they are forced to do so." Only
12.3% stated they have sex because it is what they desire.
During their last sexual encounter, only 28% used condoms.
Majority of respondents (64.1%) believed that it was
common for females to exchange sex for gifts in their com-
munity. However, only 2 (1.3%) admitted to currently being
engaged in that practice. Most (67.1%) of the girls reported
that it is common for girls to be raped in their locality.
Twenty-seven of the sexually active respondents (18%)
reported that they had experienced rape (Table 3).
Discussion
Although the teenage years should be a relatively healthy life
stage, many adolescent girls in developing countries are at
risk. For many, their well-being is compromised by poor
education, violence and abuse, unsafe working conditions,
and lack of autonomy--all manifestations of gender inequal-
ity and poverty (Temin, Levine, & Oomman, 2010). All the
350 female adolescent respondents in this study were out of
school, and less than a third of respondents (29%) had com-
pleted secondary school. Several reasons have been given for
the low participation of girls in secondary education in
Nigeria, including economic status. According to a report by
the British Council in Nigeria (2012), "there is a strong cor-
relation between Nigerian girls' net school attendance and
wealth" (p. 31). The main reason given by the respondents in
this study for being out of school was because they were
unable to afford the cost of formal education (33.0%). As
reported by Lloyd and Young (2009), "the immediate bene-
fits of education during adolescence are greater safety,
enhanced social status, and better opportunities for self-actu-
alization and empowerment" (p. 36). Less than half of the
respondents lived with their parents. Majority live with
employers, relatives, guardians, and friends, or live alone.
These social, economic, and environmental factors make
these female adolescents vulnerable to sexual coercion and
sexual abuse. The person an adolescent resides with

influences their age at initiation of sexual intercourse
(Odeyemi, Onajole, & Ogunowo, 2009). Individual factors
that protect women or put them at risk include, "the woman's
level of education, financial autonomy, previous victimiza-
tion, level of empowerment and social support" (WHO,
2005, p. 8).
Almost half (43%) of adolescent females in Nigeria are
reported to be sexually active, with 20.3% of them having
engaged in sexual intercourse by the age of 15 years (Federal
ministry of Health (Nigeria) [FMOH], 2008). Similarly in
this study, 42.9% of respondents reported that they have had
sex. Median age at initiation was 16 years. A boyfriend was
the first sexual partner of majority of respondents (93.6%).
These adolescents therefore require information, goal setting
skills, refusal skills, and decision-making skills to help them
make the right choices about their sexual behavior. Young
age is risk factor for partner violence. As reported in the
WHO Multi-Country Study on Women's Health and
Domestic Violence Against Women (WHOMCS) study,
younger women especially those between ages 15 and 19 years
are at higher risk of current sexual violence in most settings. For
example in Urban Bangladesh, 48% of 15 to 19 year olds reported
physical or sexual violence compared to 10% of 45 to 49 year
olds. In urban Peru, the difference was 41% among 15 to 19-year-
olds versus 8% of 45 to 49-year-olds. (WHO, 2005, p. 8)
In this study, respondents were asked to indicate whether
their first experience of sexual intercourse was forced, or by
choice. Less than half (43.8%) said they had their first act of
sexual intercourse because it was what they desired. Others
had their first act of sexual intercourse because they felt they
needed to do so to show love/commitment to their partner
(20.5%) or because they were forced (15.8%). Others said
they had their first experience of sexual intercourse because
they were pressured to do so by their partners (6.8%), and to
receive gifts (2.7%). Similar high rates of forced or coerced
sexual initiation have been reported in population-based
studies conducted in such diverse locations as Cameroon, the
Caribbean, Peru, New Zealand, South Africa, and Tanzania.
According to these studies, "between 9% and 37% of adoles-
cent females, have reported sexual coercion at the hands of
family members, teachers, boyfriends or strangers" (WHO,
2003, p. 1). A WHO (2005) report states,
In 10 of 15 settings studied, over 5% of women who had ever
had sex reported their first sexual experience as forced. The
figure was 14% or more in Bangladesh, Ethiopia, provincial
Peru, and the United Republic of Tanzania. (p. 14)
The wide variation may be a reflection of social attitudes
toward female sexuality or real cultural differences.
There is significant underreporting of sexual violence.
Therefore, published statistics are unlikely to provide an
accurate picture of the true scale of the problem. Sexual vio-
lence is ubiquitous; it occurs in every culture, in all levels of
society and in every country of the world. In many cases, it
begins in childhood or adolescence and as reported by the
WHO (2002, p. 149; 2003, p. 1), "up to one-third of females
describe their first sexual experience as being forced."
Among the 150 respondents who have had sexual inter-
course, 134 (89.3%) were currently sexually active and
18.7% stated that they had more than one sexual partner in
last 6 months. Majority (77.9%) are having sex in the belief
that it is "the way to express their love for their partner";
24.0%, because their partner demands it; and 7.8%, because
they are forced to do so. Only 12.3% stated they are sexually
active because that is what they desire. This demonstrates
that many of these adolescents are in sexual relationships for
the pleasure of their partners; they feel they have no other
choice and perceive that it is the right thing to do. This atti-
tude may be an expression of the way these females have
been socialized, as evident from the finding in the Nigerian
National HIV/AIDS and Reproductive Health Survey
(NAHRS) in which many of the females interviewed were of
the opinion that "a wife has no right to refuse sex and
deserves to be beaten if she refuses to have sex with her part-
ner" (FMOH, 2008, p. 143). The touchstone of coercion is an
individual woman's lack of choice to pursue other options
without severe social or physical consequences (Heise,
Moore, & Toubia, 1995). According to WHO (2002), "sexual
violence is more likely to occur where beliefs in male sexual
entitlement are strong and where gender roles are more rigid"
(p. 162). In Ethiopia and Thailand, a large number of women
reported having intercourse because they are afraid to refuse
and report being coerced out of fear (WHO, 2005). Studies in
Bangladesh have also reported that women feel that it is
"natural" for a man to have sex with his partner against her
will and the woman always has to conform to his requests. In
the provincial sites of Bangladesh, Peru, Tanzania, Ethiopia,
and Samoa, between 10% and 20% of women felt that
"women do not have the right to refuse to have sex with their
partners under any circumstances" (WHO, 2005, p. 11). The
reported lifetime prevalence of sexual violence by a partner
ranged between 6% in city sites in Japan, Sergio, and
Montenegro and 59% in Ethiopia with rates in most places
falling between 10% and 50%. The proportion of women
physically forced into intercourse varied from 4% in Serbia
and Montenegro to 46% in Ethiopia and Bangladesh. These
high rates of forced sexual intercourse are particularly worri-
some in the light of the HIV pandemic and the long-term
challenges faced by those who are victims. It is therefore
important to challenge the social norms that condone and
therefore perpetuate violence against women. During adoles-
cence, girls need accurate information about risks and
choices offered in a nonjudgmental manner, peer and other
social support to make healthy choices, and tools to deal with
risks to their health (Temin et al., 2010).
Majority of respondents in this study (64.1%) believed
that it was common for females to exchange sex for gifts in
their community. This is not surprising considering the
Odeyemi et al. 5
socioeconomic status of these respondents and the finding
that 42.6% of the respondents stated that they do not receive
enough money from their parents/guardian to meet their
basic needs, and some respondents (35.2%) claimed that
they are encouraged to find means to supplement what par-
ents/guardians give. These situations make these adolescents
vulnerable. Availability of funds to meet basic needs has
been reported to be associated with initiation of sexual activ-
ity among adolescents (Odeyemi et al., 2009). However,
only a few respondents (1.3%) admitted to currently being
engaged in the practice of exchanging sex for gifts, which is
likely to be underreporting due to the stigma associated with
transactional sex. From the report of the FMOH (2008), the
proportion of respondents who have ever received gifts or
favor for sex is higher in the younger age group (15-29
years).
Data from country and local studies published by WHO in
2003 indicate that "in some parts of the world at least, one
woman in every five has suffered an attempted or completed
rape by an intimate partner during her lifetime" (WHO,
2003, p. 1). Poverty, living in a community with a general
tolerance for sexual violence, and weak sanctions against
perpetrators have been identified as being contributory fac-
tors (WHO, 2002). In Nigeria, concerns have been raised
about the prevalence of violence against women and girls,
including sexual harassment. In this study, most (67.1%) of
the girls reported that it is common for girls to be raped in
their locality. Twenty-seven out of the 150 respondents
(18%) who have had sexual intercourse reported that they
had experienced rape. Victims are unwilling to report certain
types of violence, such as rape, because of shame and social
stigma, and so very few cases are brought to court in Nigeria,
and a conspiracy of silence conceals the nature and extent of
the problem (British Council Nigeria, 2012). The inadequate
social and legal sanctions create an environment that allows
sexual violence to occur. Support needs to be provided for
the victims, and the legal environment needs to be conducive
for adolescents who desire legal action against perpetrators.
Sexual violence has both physical and psychological effects
on health and well-being; these can be short- and/or long-
term. The potential reproductive and sexual health conse-
quences are numerous, including unwanted pregnancy,
sexually transmitted infections (STIs), HIV/AIDS, and
increased risk for adoption of risky sexual behaviors (e.g.,
early and increased sexual involvement, and exposure to
older and multiple partners; WHO, 2003). According to
WHO (2003),
The mental health consequences of sexual violence can be just
as serious and long lasting. Victims of child sexual abuse, for
example, are more likely to experience depression, substance
abuse, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and suicide in later
life than their non-abused counterparts. Worldwide child sexual
abuse is a major cause of PTSD, accounting for an estimated
33% of cases in females and 21% of cases in males. (p. 15)
Further studies need to be done to document the effects of
sexual abuse on women in this environment.
Conclusion and Recommendation
Out-of-school adolescents are at high risk of sexual coercion
and sexual abuse; 15.8% of respondents stated that their first
act of sexual intercourse was forced, whereas among the
sexually active, 18% reported that they have experienced
rape. These are acts of sexual violence. Appropriate social
and legal sanctions must be put in place to reduce the preva-
lence of sexual violence, and support should be provided for
the victims. Gender norms that promote violence against
women need to be addressed, and young women need train-
ing on negotiation skills. A national campaign should be ini-
tiated to tackle gender violence and raise awareness of its
detrimental impacts on society.
