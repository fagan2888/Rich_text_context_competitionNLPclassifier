Abstract
Objective: To explore expression and clinical relevance of phosphohistidine phosphatase
1 (PHPT1) in clear-cell renal cell carcinoma.
Methods: Patients with clear-cell renal cell carcinoma who underwent radical or nephron-sparing
nephrectomy were enrolled. Correlations between PHPT1 expression and demographic and
clinical characteristics were analysed prospectively.
Results: In total, 122 patients (78 male/44 female) were included. In normal kidney tissue, PHPT1
expression was observed only in the proximal tubule. High PHPT1 expression levels were
associated with larger tumour size, higher Fuhrman nuclear grade and advanced pathological
tumour­node­metastasis (pTNM) stage compared with low PHPT1 expression levels. Patients
with low PHPT1 expression showed better overall survival and progression-free survival compared
with those with high PHPT1 expression. In addition, multivariate analysis showed that nuclear grade
and pTNM stage were independent predictors of progression-free survival and overall survival in
patients with clear-cell renal cell carcinoma. PHPT1 expression was also an independent predictor
of overall survival but not progression-free survival.
Conclusions: PHPT1 was expressed in the epithelium of proximal tubuli and nuclei of clear-cell
renal cell carcinoma tissue samples. High levels of 14 kDa phosphohistidine phosphatase protein
were negatively associated with overall survival and progression-free survival in patients with
clear-cell renal cell carcinoma.

Introduction
The global incidence of renal cell carcinoma
has increased by 2­4% annually over the
past decade, and renal cell carcinoma is
thought to account for $3% of adult
malignancies and 80­85% of all kidney
cancers.1 In the USA, kidney cancers were
projected to account for an estimated 65 150
new cases and 13 680 deaths in 2013.2 The
exact aetiology of renal cell carcinoma
remains unclear and is probably multifac-
torial. Mutational inactivation of von
Hippel­Lindau disease tumour suppressor
protein in clear-cell renal cell carcinoma is
thought to be one of the molecular fac-
tors underlying this disease.3 For example,
abnormal expression of von Hippel­Lindau
disease tumour suppressor, E3 ubiquitin
protein ligase (VHL) gene will result in
upregulation of hypoxia-inducible factor
1-a and lead to epidermal growth factor
receptor signalling,4 which will further acti-
vate Raf serine/threonine kinase isoforms
(e.g. Raf-1 and B-Raf) and increase cell
proliferation and survival.5 Abnormal
expression of VHL can indirectly stimulate
angiogenesis by increasing the production of
vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)
and platelet-derived growth factor, which
are substrates of receptor tyrosine phos-
phorylation.4,6 All of these factors promote
the metastasis of renal cell carcinoma,4,6 and
targeted therapy aimed at regulating abnor-
mal serine/threonine or tyrosine phosphor-
ylation has been a crucial turning point in
the treatment of metastatic renal cell cancer.
Many active drugs target neoplastic neo-
angiogenesis by directly blocking VEGF
(e.g. bevacizumab),7­9 or its receptor (e.g.
tyrosine-kinase inhibitors).10­13 Some tar-
geted drugs have significantly improved the
prognosis patients with of renal cell
carcinoma.8,14,15
Phosphohistidine is widely used in
signal transduction activity of the eukary-
otic cells, and accounts for 6% of the
protein-bound phosphate.16 The function
of phosphohistidine in eukaryotes is little
studied, however, compared with serine/
threonine and tyrosine phosphorylation.
Analysis of the molecular structure of
phosphohistidine has shown that the phos-
phoramidate bond in phosphohistidine at
the 1-N and 3-N positions of the imidazole
ring is different from the phosphoester bond
in phosphohydroxyamino acids. Moreover,
the N-bound phosphate of phosphohistidine
is very labile under acidic conditions.17,18
Research in the field of phosphohistidine
phosphorylation has, therefore, been ham-
pered by difficulties in analysis and detection
of phosphohistidine under the often very
acidic conditions during which protein char-
acterization is performed.19,20
The present study aimed to explore the
clinical significance of phosphohistidine
phosphatase 1 (PHPT1) expression in
clear-cell renal cell carcinoma. Expression
of PHPT1 in clear-cell renal cell carcinoma
was examined using an immunohistochem-
ical approach to determine 14 kDa phos-
phohistidine phosphatase (PHPT1) protein
levels; correlations between PHPT1 expres-
sion and clinicopathological features and
prognostic factors in clear-cell renal cell
carcinoma were investigated.
Patients and methods
Study population and clinicopathological
data
In this prospective observational study,
patients with clear-cell renal cell carcinoma
who underwent radical or nephron-sparing
nephrectomy at Beijing Friendship
Hospital, Capital Medical University,
Beijing, China were sequentially enrolled
between 1 January, 2005 and 30 December,
2012. Clinical records, imaging data and
histopathological features were fully docu-
mented. Prior to data analyses, each
748 Journal of International Medical Research 43(6)
clear-cell renal cell carcinoma sample was
re-evaluated with regard to the carcinoma
type, tumour stage and nuclear grade.
Tumour staging was redefined according to
the 2010 tumour­node-­metastases (TNM)
classification system by reviewing imaging
data and slides.14 Nuclear grading was
reassigned according to the Fuhrman
system by two independent pathologists.21,22
Recurrence or metastasis of renal cell car-
cinoma was determined according to clinical
and radiographic findings. Disease-related
deaths were identified by reviewing the
medical records.
Inclusion criteria comprised patients
diagnosed with clear-cell renal cell carcin-
oma. Patients receiving chemotherapy or
radiotherapy following surgery, or who were
diagnosed with clear-cell renal cell carcin-
oma (in addition to other types of renal cell
carcinoma) were excluded. The follow-up
period was defined as the time from surgery
to time of death or time of last recorded
clinical data.
The present study was approved by the
Beijing Friendship Hospital, Capital
Medical University ethics review committee,
and written informed consent was obtained
from all participants.
Sample collection and processing
Tumourtissue samples were collected from
each patient during surgery to remove the
clear-cell renal cell carcinoma. During this
surgery, healthy tissue samples were also
obtained from each patient from an area
2 cm from the tumour tissue. All samples
were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (Sigma-
Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA) in 100 mM
phosphate buffered saline (PBS; pH 7.5),
and embedded in standard paraffin
wax. Tissue sections were cut to 6-mm
thickness and stored at 4C. Haematoxylin
and eosin stain was used to visualize tissue
sections.
Tissue samples and
immunohistochemistry
Paraffin-wax sections were deparaffinized
with xylene and rehydrated in decreasing
concentrations of ethanol. Antigen retrieval
was performed by heating the sections in an
antigen retrieval buffer (1 Â citric acid buffer
solution, pH 6.0 [Sangon Biotech, Shanghai,
China]) in a microwave oven (model
MYZH931, Kaixiu Trade, Guangzhou,
China) at 90C for 45 min. Endogenous
peroxidase activity was blocked using 3%
H2
O2
for 10 min at room temperature, fol-
lowed by blocking of endogenous biotin
enzyme with normal goat serum for 30 min
at room temperature. Sections were then
incubated with a 1 : 40 dilution of polyclonal
rabbit anti-PHPT1 primary antibody
(TA302276; OriGene, Beijing, China) over-
night at 4C, washed three times with 0.01M
PBS (pH 7.4), followed by incubation with a
1:500 dilution of mouse antirabbit horse-
radish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated anti-
body (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) at room
temperature for 60 min. Sections were
then washed again three times in PBS.
Immunostaining was visualized using a
horseradish catalase diaminobenzidine
colour kit (Sangon Biotech, Shanghai,
China), and the sections were counter-
stained with haematoxylin. For negative
controls, 0.01M PBS (pH 7.4) was used in
place of the primary antibody.
Tissue sections were observed at
200 Â magnification using an Olympus
microscope (Olympus, Japan). A total of
three sections were analysed per patient,
with 15 fields of view captured for each
section. Positive stained cells and total cells
were counted in each field. For each patient,
the percentage of positive cells was calcu-
lated as the mean of three sections (15 fields
per section). Expression of PHPT1 was
classified into four grades determined by
the percentage of positive cells in the tumour
Shen et al. 749
section as follows: grade 1, 5% positive
cells; grade 2, 6%­25% positive cells; grade
3, 26%­50% positive cells; grade 4, > 50%
positive cells. Grade 1 and 2 tumours were
considered to have low PHPT1 protein
levels (negative); grade 3 and 4 tumours
were considered to have high PHPT1 pro-
tein levels (positive).
Statistical analyses
Measurement data were presented as mean Æ
SD and statistical analyses were performed
using SPSSÕ, version 13.0 (SPSS Inc.,
Chicago, IL, USA) for WindowsÕ. Clinico
pathological data were compared between
patients with PHPT1-positive and PHPT1-
negative tumours. To verify the association
between categorical variables, 2-test was
performed. Student's t-test for independent
samples was used, to analyse continuous
variables. Prognostic single factor analysis
was performed using Kaplan­Meier curves
and the log-rank test to determine between-
curve differences. The Cox proportional haz-
ards model was employed in multiple fac-
tor analysis. The endpoint for survival
probability was defined as the occurrence of
metastasis and/or death by renal cell carcin-
oma. Statistical significance was determined as
P< 0.05.
Results
Clinicopathological findings
A total of 122 patients (78 male and
44 female) were included, with a mean age
of 63.5 Æ 18.04 years (median 65, range
27­86 years), and mean tumour size of
7.9 cm (range, 2.0­20.0 cm). Two patients
presented with von Hippel­Lindau disease
and five patients had a family history of
renal cell carcinoma. Seventy five patients
(61.48%) were diagnosed by unrelated ima-
ging examinations, whereas 47 patients
(38.52%) had some clinical symptoms prior
to diagnosis. Of all patients, 43 (35.25%)
were pathological (p)TNM stage I, 34
(27.87%) were stage II, 25 (20.49%) were
stage III and 20 (16.39%) were stage IV.
Regarding tumour cell Fuhrman nuclear
grade, 35 (28.69%) patients were grade I
and II, 51 (41.80%) patients were grade III,
and 36 (29.51%) patients were grade IV. The
duration of follow-up ranged from 6­84
months (median, 36 months).
Immunohistochemical staining
and outcome evaluation
There was no PHPT1 expression in any
parts of the glomeruli in the normal kidney
cortex from positive contrast samples, how-
ever, PHPT1 expression was observed in
normal kidney proximal tubuli as brown
granules deposited mainly in the epithelium.
PHPT1 was expressed in the nuclei of the
clear-cell renal cell carcinoma tissue
(Figure 1). Tissue samples from 47 patient
(38.52%) expressed low PHPT1 levels, with
high levels of expression found in samples
from 75 patients (61.48%). Correlations
between PHPT1 expression and clinico-
pathological parameters are shown in
Table 1. There were no between-group stat-
istical differences in PHPT1 expression in
terms of sex or age. High levels of PHPT1
expression were significantly associated with
larger tumour size, higher Fuhrman
nuclear grade and advanced pTNM stage
(P¼ 0.021, 0.024, 0.040, respectively; Table 1)
compared with low PHPT1 expression.
Association between PHPT1 expression
and survival
One patient was censored during the follow-
up period. Univariate analysis, based on the
results of immunohistochemical examin-
ation, revealed that patients with low
PHPT1 expression showed better overall
survival and progression-free survival com-
pared with patients with high PHPT1 expres-
sion levels (P< 0.05; Table 2; Figure 2).
750 Journal of International Medical Research 43(6)
In addition, pTNM stage and Fuhrman
nuclear grade correlated significantly with
overall and progression-free survival
(P < 0.001). Multivariate analysis showed
that Fuhrman nuclear grade and pTNM
stage were independent predictors of overall
survival and progression-free survival in
patients with clear-cell renal cell carcinoma
(Table 3). PHPT1 expression was also an
independent predictor for overall sur-
vival, but not for progression-free survival
(Table 3).

Discussion
The PHPT1 14 kDa phosphatase enzyme,
which dephosphorylates phosphohistidine,
was the first protein histidine phosphatase
discovered in vertebrates, and was purified
from porcine liver cytosol and cloned from a
human kidney genomic DNA library.15,23
The full physiological function of PHPT1
remains unclear, although evidence is grow-
ing for its role in cellular function and
metabolism. The known target proteins of
PHPT1 are mammalian ATP-citrate lyase,24
the b-subunit of heterotrimeric G-protein25
and the calcium-dependent potassium chan-
nel, KCa3.1.26
Mammalian PHPT1 enzyme shows spe-
cific phosphatase activity against peptides
and proteins containing phosphohistidine,
and has been shown to enhance the rate of
dephosphorylation of 1- and 3-phosphohis-
tidine in peptides.27 Expression of PHPT1
has been associated with tumour invasion,
and increased expression has been observed
in a high metastasis cell line; furthermore, in
vivo and in vitro studies have revealed roles
for PHPT1 in the migration and invasion of
lung cancer cells.28 Using immunohisto-
chemical techniques, higher PHPT1 protein
levels have been found in lung cancer tissue
samples compared with normal tissues adja-
cent to lung cancer.29 Moderate levels of
PHPT1 protein have been observed in the
proximal tubules of human kidney tissue.16
Clear-cell renal cell carcinoma is a proximal
tubular epithelium-derived carcinoma that
possibly originates from mature renal tubu-
lar cells in the proximal tubule of the
nephron.30 PHPT1 is ubiquitously distribu-
ted in the mammalian organism,16 and con-
trast sections in the present study verified
PHPT1 expression in adult kidney, with
brown granules deposited mainly in the
epithelium of the proximal tubuli, but not
in any part of the glomeruli. Moderate
PHPT1 expression in the epithelium of
proximal tubuli and weak expression in the
epithelium of distal tubules has been found
by immunohistochemical staining, with no
signal observed in the loop of Henle, distal
tubule and or in glomeruli cells.16 PHPT1 is
strongly expressed in variety of rapidly
dividing epithelial tissues, such as those of
the skin, oesophagus, vagina and cervix.16 In
the National Center for Biotechnology
Information UniGene database,31 mRNA
levels of PHPT1 are shown to be high in the
mammary gland, heart, pituitary gland and
parathyroid glands, suggesting that PHPT1

might have a role in cell proliferation and
differentiation.
To the best of the authors' knowledge,
the present study is the first to investigate
PHPT1 expression in clear-cell renal cell
carcinoma using immunohistochemical
staining. Overexpression of PHPT1 is
accepted to be related to some malignant
tumours, for example, increased PHPT1
mRNA levels associated with a recurrent
9q34 duplication was found in 33% of
paediatric T cell acute lymphoblastic leu-
kaemia cases.32 Moreover, the PHP14
(PHP1) protein was found to be overex-
pressed in highly metastatic lung cancer cell
lines. Immunohistochemical analysis
showed PHPT is highly expressed in primary
lung cancer.29
Overexpression of PHPT1 is related to
the invasiveness and migration of some
malignant tumours. High expression of
PHPT1 was associated with the metastatic
potential of CL1-5 lung cancer cell lines.
Invasiveness and migration of CL1-5 cells
was decreased in vitro when cells were
incubated with PHP14-siRNA, while over-
expression of PHP14 in the NCIH 1299 lung
cancer cell line promoted their invasiveness
and migration in vitro.28 Furthermore, 75%
of patients with lung cancer had higher
PHPT1 mRNA levels in lymph node metas-
tasis tissue than in adjacent noncancerous
tissue, and significantly higher PHPT1 pro-
tein levels were detected by immunohisto-
chemistry in the lymph node metastasis
group than in the group without lymph
node metastasis.29 The present study also
found that PHPT1 expression levels were
positively associated with larger tumour
size, and higher Fuhrman nuclear grade
and pTNM stage; therefore, patients with
high levels of PHPT1 expression exhibited a
worse clinical outcome. The mechanisms by
which PHPT1 promotes tumour invasion
and metastasis remain unclear. Knockout of
PHPT1 by PHP14 siRNA in CL1-5 lung
cancer cells (which normally have numerous
microspikes or long filopodia along the cell
membrane under microscopy) changed
F-actin distribution and displayed a
smooth, continuous cortical layer of actin
and few microfilament bundles that was
similar to poorly metastatic CL1-0 cells,28
which suggested that modulation of cyto-
skeleton reorganization were affected.
In conclusion, the present study showed
that high nuclear expression of PHPT1 was
associated with a worse clinical outcome in
patients with clear-cell renal cell carcinoma.
Using the Cox proportional hazards model,
Fuhrman nuclear grade and pTNM stage
were independent predictors of overall sur-
vival and progression-free survival in
patients with clear-cell renal cell carcinoma.
PHPT1 expression was also shown to be an
independent predictor of overall survival,
but not progression-free survival.
