ABSTRACT
Background: BMI is one factor that is used to determine a child's
eligibility for lipid screening and treatment. BMI, which is an in-
direct measure of body fat, may inadequately represent the biolog-
ical effect of body fat percentage on lipid concentrations.
Objective: We examined the relation between directly measured
body fat percentage and lipid concentrations in a representative
sample of US youths.
Design: Data from 7821 participants aged 8­19 y from the 1999­
2004 NHANES were analyzed. Body fat percentage was measured
by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Total and HDL-cholesterol
concentrations were measured in serum. Serum triglyceride and
LDL-cholesterol concentrations were measured in a subsample of
2661 fasting NHANES participants aged 12­19 y. Prevalences of
adverse total cholesterol (.200 mg/dL), LDL cholesterol (.130
mg/dL), triglycerides (.150 mg/dL), and HDL cholesterol (,35
mg/dL) were measured.
Results: Approximately 10.0% [60.7% (SE)] of participants had
high total cholesterol, 7.0 6 0.4% of participants had low HDL
cholesterol, 9.7 6 1.0% of participants had high triglycerides, and
7.6 6 0.7% of participants had high LDL cholesterol. Prevalence of
adverse total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, and LDL
cholesterol in US youths with high adiposity (greater than or equal
to the age- and sex-specific 75th percentile of body fat percentage)
was significantly greater (P , 0.01) than for participants without
high adiposity. In multiple linear regressions adjusted for age, sur-
vey period, and race-ethnicity, the variance in lipid concentrations
explained by body fat percentage was 2­20% (P , 0.001).
Conclusion: Adverse lipid concentrations and high adiposity are sig-
nificantly associated in youths. Am J Clin Nutr 2011;94:877­83.
INTRODUCTION
Atherosclerosis is believed to have multifactorial origins in
childhood (1). A high concentration of LDL cholesterol, a low
concentration of HDL cholesterol, and obesity in childhood all
may contribute to the development of cardiovascular disease (2).
Adverse lipid concentrations in adolescence have been shown to
be correlated with adverse lipid concentrations in early adulthood
(3, 4) and have been hypothesized, along with obesity, to con-
tribute to the development of atherosclerosis in children (1, 2, 5,
6) and adults (7­9).
Although childhood obesity and adverse lipid concentrations
are risk factors for atherosclerosis, researchers have described an
association between a high childhood BMI (weight in kilograms
divided by height in meters squared) and adverse lipid con-
centrations (10­16). In small longitudinal studies, as childhood
ponderosity or age-adjusted BMI increases, lipid concentrations
tend to worsen (17, 18), and as childhood BMI decreases, lipid
concentrations improve (19).
The high prevalence of elevated BMI in US youths (20, 21) and
the apparent association between high BMI, adverse lipid con-
centrations, and atherosclerosis has raised concern regarding the
immediate and long-term health effects of high adiposity in
childhood. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) has
recently recommended fasting lipid profile screening for youths
(2) with BMI-for-age85th percentile on the 2000 CDC growth
charts (22) and also recommended the pharmacologic treatment
of children aged 8 y with LDL concentration persistently
160 mg/dL despite diet therapy who have other risk factors,
which may include BMI 95th percentile (2). Thus, a child's
BMI, in combination with other risk factors such as a family
history of cardiovascular disease or high LDL cholesterol, can
influence both lipid screening and pharmacologic treatment
decisions.
BMI measures body mass and does not distinguish between fat
and lean mass. When BMI is used to estimate adiposity, it is
assumed that, at a given height, a greater weight is associated with
increased fatness (23). BMI is an imperfect measure of adiposity,
although children with BMI-for-age 95th percentile tend to
have excess body fat (24, 25). If the body fat mass has a biologic
effect on lipid concentrations, this effect may be inadequately
represented by BMI (26).
Studies that used nationally representative data to examine the
relation between childhood BMI and lipid concentrations have
been published (11, 26). In the current study, to examine the

relation between high adiposity and lipid concentrations more
precisely, the associations between body fat percentage and lipid
concentrations (total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, triglycerides,
and LDL cholesterol) were analyzed using data from a nationally
representative sample of US youths. Differences by age group,
race-ethnicity, and sex were tested.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS
Data came from the 1999­2004 NHANES conducted by the
National Center for Health Statistics of the CDC (27). The
NHANES is a complex, multistage probability sample that is
representative of the US civilian noninstitutionalized population
and includes a home interview and standardized physical exami-
nation at a mobile examination center. The 1999­2004 NHANES
oversampled non-Hispanic blacks, Mexican Americans, and
adolescents aged 12­19 y, among other demographic groups, to
provide statistically reliable estimates for these groups. Race-
ethnicity was self-reported or reported by a proxy. Race-ethnicity
was categorized into the following 3 groups for this analysis: non-
Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, and Mexican American.
Other race-ethnic groups did not have a large enough sample size
forseparateanalyses.Thesurveywasreviewedandapprovedbythe
National Center for Health Statistics Institutional Review Board.
Written consent was obtained from participants aged 18 y, and
parental consent and child assent were obtained for youths aged 7­
17 y. These analyses used data from NHANES participants aged
8­19 y.
Total analysis sample and fasting subsample
The NHANES 1999­2004 sample consisted of 10,732 partic-
ipants aged 8­19 y, 9459 (88.1%) of whom were interviewed and
9130 (85.1%) of whom were interviewed and examined. Youths
who did not have total body fat percentage calculated or imputed
(n = 265), did not have lipids measured (n = 900), self-reported as
having diabetes (n = 43), or were being treated with drugs that may
have caused secondary hypercholesterolemia such as estrogens,
androgens, b-blockers, carbamazepine, anabolic steroids, and
progestins (n = 101) were excluded from all analyses. The total
analysis sample comprised 7821 participants aged 8­19 y. Total
and HDL cholesterol measures were available for these 7821
children. Of the 7821 survey participants in the total analysis
sample, 2661 participants aged 12­19 y reported that they had
fasted for 8.5­23 h before phlebotomy in the morning examina-
tion. Fasting LDL cholesterol and triglycerides were available for
these 2661 children.
DXA measurement and high-adiposity definition
Whole-body dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scans
were taken with a Hologic QDR-4500A fan-beam densitometer
(Hologic). Hologic software (version 8.26:a3*; Hologic) was
used to administer all scans. Hologic Discovery software (version
12.1; Hologic) was used to analyze scans. Participants who were
too tall (.6 ft, 5 in), too heavy (.300 lbs) for the DXA table or
who were pregnant did not undergo a DXA scan and, thus, had
missing DXA data. DXA data were considered invalid if re-
movable or nonremovable objects were present or if there was
an arm/leg overlap, body parts out of the DXA-table scan area,
positioning problems, or missing limbs.
DXA data were not missing at random (ie, heaviest partic-
ipants were more likely to have missing DXA data, and DXA data
were not collected for girls in 1999 because of the lack of In-
stitutional Review Board approval). Consequently, a multiple
imputation of missing DXA data for nonpregnant participants
aged 8 y was performed. The multiple imputation allowed for
uncertainty because of imputation to be reflected in the analysis.
The NHANES has created and recommended analyzing the 5
completed data files that contained both the nonmissing and
imputed DXA data values (28, 29), which we used in our
analyses. Of the 7821 subjects in these analyses, DXA data were
imputed for 1045 participants (13.4% of participants).
Highadipositywasdefinedasatotalbodyfatpercentagegreater
than or equal to the sex- and age-specific internal smoothed 75th
percentile. Although there are no standard values of body fat
percentage that are considered to represent high adiposity, body
fatnesspercentilesfromthe75thto85thpercentilesapproximately
correspond to the assumptions that obese children (95th per-
centile of BMI-for-age) are likely to have high adiposity, and
normal-weight children (,85th percentile of BMI-for-age) are
relatively unlikely to have high adiposity (25).
Lipid measurement and adverse lipid concentration
definitions
Total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and triglycerides were
measured in the serum for NHANES participants aged 3 y. For
participants with triglyceride concentrations 400 mg/dL (4.52
mmol/L), LDL cholesterol was calculated by using Friedewald's
equation (30). Because the distribution of triglyceride values
was highly skewed, log transformation was applied to tri-
glyceride data. Triglycerides and LDL cholesterol were avail-
able only for participants aged 12 y who reported that they had
fasted for 8.5­23 h before a morning examination (27). Children
,12 y of age were not asked to fast. The method for measuring
HDL cholesterol was changed in 2003. Because of this change
in methodology, HDL cholesterol values showed an average
increase of 3.0 mg/dL (;6%) in the NHANES 2003­2006
compared with in the NHANES 1999­2002 (31). Prevalences of
low HDL concentrations shown in Tables 1 and 2 were
a weighted average of HDL measurements from 1999 to 2004. A
comparison of 1999­2002 and 2003­2004 showed no significant
differences in prevalences of low HDL concentrations between
the 2 time periods. The change in the methodology of HDL
measurements was taken into account in the multiple linear
regression analyses by including the survey period as a covariate
in the models. Adverse lipid concentrations were defined as
follows: total cholesterol .200 mg/dL, triglycerides .150 mg/
dL and LDL cholesterol .130 mg/dL were considered high.
HDL cholesterol ,35 mg/dL was considered low. (2, 32)
Statistical analysis
Differences in the prevalence of adverse lipid concentrations
between youths with and without high adiposity were estimated
by sex, race-ethnicity (non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black,
and Mexican American) and age groups (8­11, 12­15, and 16­
19 y). In youths with high adiposity, comparisons of adverse lipid
concentrations between sexes, race-ethnic groups, and age groups
were also made. Univariate comparisons were tested by using
a Student's t statistic with the appropriate number of df and

based on a 2-sided P value. The Bonferroni method was used to
adjust for multiple comparisons (33). To examine the relation
between body fat percentage and lipid concentrations controlled
for possible confounding effects of survey period, age and race-
ethnicity, 8 lipid and sex specificmultiple linear regression models
adjusted for the survey period (because of the change in the HDL
measurement methodology), age, and race-ethnicity, were used.
To determine whether the relation between body fat percentage
and lipid concentrations differed by sex, 4 lipid-specific multiple
linear regression models that included a variable to represent the
interaction between sex and body fat percentage were used. These
models were adjusted for the survey period, age, race-ethnicity,
and sex.
Data were analyzed with SAS version 9.2 (SAS Institute) and
SUDAAN version 10.0.0 (Research Triangle Institute) statistical
programs. All analyses used sample weights to account for dif-
ferential probabilities of selection into the sample, nonresponse,
and noncoverage. For analyses that involved serum total and HDL
cholesterol, the examination sample weight was used, and for
analysesthatinvolvedserumtriglycerideandLDL cholesterol, the
morning fasting sample weight was used (27). Statistical analyses
took into account the multiple imputations of body fat data by
averagingthe5setsofimputations.Thevariationbetweenimputed
data sets was formally accounted for in the SEs and significance
levels by incorporating the between- and within-imputation var-
iances (28, 29). Standard errors were estimated with the SUDAAN
version 10.00 statistical program by using Taylor series lineari-
zation (34).
RESULTS
Sample sizes, mean percentage body fat, and the prevalence of
obesity (BMI 95th percentile of BMI-for-age) for both the
total sample and the fasting subsample are shown in Table 3. In
8­19-y-olds, the mean (6SE) body fat percentage for boys was
25.4 6 0.2% and for girls was 33.0 6 0.2%.
Approximately 10.0 6 0.7% of the total sample had high total
cholesterol, and ;7.0 6 0.4% of the total sample had low HDL
cholesterol. In the subsample of fasting youths age 12­19 y,
;9.7 6 1.0% of participants had high triglycerides, and ;7.6 6
0.7%) of participants had high LDL cholesterol (Table 1).
Prevalences of adverse lipid concentrations for different
amounts of percentage body fat for boys and girls is shown in
Figure 1.
For boys, prevalences of high total cholesterol, high trigly-
cerides, or low HDL cholesterol were significantly greater in
those with high adiposity than in those without high adiposity
(P , 0.01). No difference in the prevalence of high LDL cho-
lesterol was seen by adiposity status in boys (Table 2). For girls,
the prevalence of low HDL cholesterol was significantly greater
in girls with high adiposity than in girls without high adiposity
(P , 0.01). No differences in prevalences of high total choles-
terol, triglycerides, or LDL cholesterol were seen by adiposity
status in girls. In all 3 race-ethnic groups and youths age 12­19 y,
the prevalence of high total cholesterol was significantly greater
in youths with high adiposity than in youths without high adi-
posity. Likewise, in all 3 race-ethnic groups and all age groups,
prevalences of low HDL cholesterol and high triglycerides were
significantly different between youths with and without high
adiposity. However, the prevalence of high LDL cholesterol
differed by adiposity status only in non-Hispanic blacks and did
not differ in either of the age groups examined (Table 2).
Multiple linear regression showed that body fat percentage was
positively associated with serum total cholesterol, LDL choles-
terol, and serum triglycerides and inversely associated with HDL
cholesterol in both boys and girls. The variance in lipid con-
centrations that was explained by multiple linear regression
models (R2) was between 2% and 20% (Table 4). Multiple linear
regression that used body fat mass (in kg) instead of percentage
body fat gave very similar results (data not shown). In the lipid-
specific multiple linear regression models, tests of the in-
teraction between sex and body fat percentage showed that boys

body fat percentage than did girls for serum total cholesterol
(P , 0.01) and triglycerides (P , 0.01) but not for HDL cho-
lesterol or LDL cholesterol. Tests of the interaction between
race-ethnicity and body fat percentage showed that non-Hispanic
whites had a stronger association between total cholesterol and
body fat percentage (P , 0.01) than did non-Hispanic blacks.
No interactions were shown for HDL cholesterol, LDL choles-
terol, or triglycerides. Tests of the interaction between age group
and body fat percentage showed that children age 16­19 y had
a stronger association between HDL cholesterol and body fat
percentage (P , 0.01) than did children aged 8­11 and 12­15 y.
No interactions were found for total cholesterol, LDL choles-
terol, or triglycerides.
DISCUSSION
In this study, analyses of a representative sample of US youths
suggest associations between high body fat percentage and ad-
verse concentrations of total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, tri-
glycerides, and LDL cholesterol. These results were consistent
with those shown by an analysis of NHANES data that explored
the association between BMI and adverse lipid concentrations
in youths (11). In our study, associations varied by sex, race-
ethnicity, and age group. Boys had consistently stronger associations
between body fat percentage and lipid concentrations than
did girls, which was a pattern that has been previously observed
(35).
The AAP recommends targeted screening of all children 2 y of
age with a positive family history of dyslipidemia or premature
cardiovascular disease or an unknown family history or when
obesity (as defined by BMI), hypertension, or diabetes is present
(2). The results of our study suggested that, in 8­19-y-olds, older
teens (aged 16­19 y) had a stronger relation between adiposity
and HDL cholesterol than did children and adolescents. How-
ever, this study was unable to examine the relation between
adiposity and lipid concentrations in children aged 2­8 y.

Steinberger et al (38) showed that percentage body fat was cor-

cholesterol (correlation coefficients = 0.28 and 20.24, re-
spectively). However, Owens et al (39) reported that body fat
percentage did not explain a significant proportion of the variation
in lipid concentrations in an analysis restricted to obese children.
These studies all had very small sample sizes and limited gener-
alizability.
The current study had findings similar to those of Teixeira et al
(36), Higgins et al (37), and Steinberger et al (38), who presented
weak correlations between percentage body fat and lipid con-
centrations. However, the current analyses were conducted on
a much larger probability sample of children that was nationally
representative of the US pediatric population. In addition, the
NHANES data contained children with a wide range of body fat
percentage.
It is important to note that there is no clear definition of
too much body fat in children. Other studies have analyzed body
fat percentage as a continuous variable (36, 38, 39), compared
tertiles of body fat percentage (36), compared subjects above or
below the median body fat percentage (38), have used a percentile
cutoff (40), or have identified body fat percentage cutoffs that
indicated adverse cardiovascular risk profiles in their population
(37). The current study defined high adiposity based on the
NHANES 1999­2004 internal smoothed 75th percentiles of body

ADIPOSITY AND LIPID CONCENTRATIONS IN YOUTHS 881

fat percentage from the nationally representative sample of US
children.
There are no universally accepted cutoffs for adverse childhood
lipid concentrations that predict adult cardiovascular disease.
However,thecurrentAAPguidelinesgiveLDLcholesterolcutoffs
for pharmacologic treatment in children (2). A persistent LDL
cholesterol concentration of 190 mg/dL or a persistent LDL
cholesterol concentration of 160 mg/dL in combination with
BMI 95th percentile (22) qualifies a child aged 8 y for phar-
macologic treatment if diet therapy fails to correct dyslipidemia
(2). Although the lipid cutoffs used in this study were lower than
those that qualify a child for pharmacologic-treatment consider-
ation, this study showed no significant difference in the prevalence
of high LDL cholesterol in youths with and without high adiposity
for non-Hispanic whites and Mexican Americans.
Strengths ofthecurrent study includedtherepresentativenature
of the sampling, the large sample size, and the use of DXA to
measure percentage body fat. Limitations included the fact that
a substantial proportion of potential subjects did not have lipids
measured.Acomparisonofthetotalsample(n=7821)withthe900
children that did not have lipids measured because of a lack of
a serum sample (whowere excluded from thetotal analysis sample
and all analyses) revealed no difference in the sex ratio or race-
ethnicity. However, children aged 8­11 y were less likely to have
lipids measured than were adolescents aged 12­15 y or teens aged
16­19 y. Second, the small number of children who supplied
fasting blood samples may have decreased the power to describe
the relation between percentage body fat and triglycerides or LDL
cholesterol. Third, the methodology used to measure HDL cho-
lesterol changed during the study period and potentially affected
the results. However, adjustments for this change were included in
the analyses. Fourth, lipid concentrations have been shown to dip
in the pubertal time period (41), whereas body fat percentages
increase in girls and decrease in boys during the pubertal time
period (42). The pubertal stage was not measured in the NHANES
1999­2004, but we did use the same age groups as these 2 studies
in an effort to reflect the pubertal time period. Finally, NHANES
1999­2004 did not obtain information on the family history of
hypercholesterolemia. The family history explains a large per-
centage of the variance in lipid concentrations (43). The inclusion
of family history as a potential confounder in our multivariate
models would have allowed us to see the variance in lipid con-
centrations beyond that explained by family history. Thus, the
inclusion of family history information may have given us more
accurate estimates (and smaller SEs of the estimates) of the as-
sociation between lipid concentrations and body fat percentage.
Inconclusion,themajorityofyouthswithhighadiposity didnot
havehightotalcholesterol,LDLcholesterol,ortriglyceridesorlow
HDL cholesterol. In youths with high adiposity, the prevalence of
adverse lipid concentrations varied by sex, race-ethnicity, and age
group. Significant associations were seen between body fat per-
centage and lipid concentrations. Body fat percentage explained
2­20% of thevariation in lipid concentrations, which suggests that
body fat percentage is one factor that influences lipid concen-
trations in youths. Future analyses might focus on the analysis of
non-HDL lipid concentrations and include pubertal status and
family history information to improve estimates of the association
between lipid concentrations and body fat percentage in youths.
