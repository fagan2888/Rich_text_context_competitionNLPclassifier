Abstract
Objectives: Women who combine formal and informal caregiving roles represent a unique, understudied population. In the
literature, healthcare employees who simultaneously provide unpaid elder care at home have been referred to as double-
duty caregivers. The present study broadens this perspective by examining the psychosocial implications of double-duty
child care (child care only), double-duty elder care (elder care only), and triple-duty care (both child care and elder care or
"sandwiched" care).
Method: Drawing from the Work, Family, and Health Study, we focus on a large sample of women working in nursing
homes in the United States (n = 1,399). We use multiple regression analysis and analysis of covariance tests to examine a
range of psychosocial implications associated with double- and triple-duty care.
Results: Compared with nonfamily caregivers, double-duty child caregivers indicated greater family-to-work con-
flict and poorer partner relationship quality. Double-duty elder caregivers reported more family-to-work conflict, per-
ceived stress, and psychological distress, whereas triple-duty caregivers indicated poorer psychosocial functioning
overall.
Discussion: Relative to their counterparts without family caregiving roles, women with combined caregiving roles reported
poorer psychosocial well-being. Additional research on women with combined caregiving roles, especially triple-duty car-
egivers, should be a priority amidst an aging population, older workforce, and growing number of working caregivers.
Key Words:Double-duty care--Healthcare employees--Psychosocial well-being--Sandwiched generation--Triple-duty care--Working
caregivers
Although women traditionally serve as family caregiv-
ers and predominately fill caregiving occupations in the
healthcare industry (National Alliance for Caregiving and
AARP, 2009; Paraprofessional Healthcare Institute, 2011),
women who combine paid, formal care and unpaid, fam-
ily care roles remain an understudied population (Ward-
Griffin, 2004; Ward-Griffin, Brown, Vandervoort, McNair,
& Dashnay, 2005). In the literature, paid healthcare
professionals who simultaneously provide unpaid elder
care at home are referred to as double-duty caregivers
(Rutman, 1996). Double-duty care, however, comprises a
limited body of research. Conceptually, double-duty care
overlooks other types of family caregiving roles. Further,
double-duty care research has primarily been based on
qualitative data, women working outside of the United
States, and relatively small samples (e.g., Boumans &
Dorant, 2014; Ross, Rideout, & Carson; 1994; Rutman,
1996; Scott, Hwang, & Rogers, 2006; Ward-Griffin,

& Brown, 2011).
Using a large sample of women working in nursing
homes in the United States, the current study builds on
and extends the literature by considering different com-
bined caregiving roles among healthcare employees. That
is, we broaden the definition of double-duty care to refer to
healthcare employees providing a single family caregiving
role at home, whether it be child or elder care, and dis-
tinguish between these roles with the terms "double-duty
child care" and "double-duty elder care," respectively. We
also account for healthcare employees in the sandwiched
generation (e.g., Miller, 1981), meaning women who pro-
vide both child and elder care at home; we call these women
"triple-duty caregivers" to emphasize their simultaneous
engagement in three different caregiving roles--formal
care, child care, and elder care. Additionally, we examine
the psychosocial implications associated with both double-
and triple-duty care by applying the stress process model
(Pearlin, Mullan, Semple, & Skaff, 1990). Specifically, we
assess subjective primary (perceived stress, psychologi-
cal distress) and secondary (work and family role strains)
stressors among women with combined caregiving roles.
Double- andTriple-Duty Care
Nearly 66 million adults provide some form of unpaid
family care in the United States (National Alliance for
Caregiving and AARP, 2009), constituting the largest
source of long-term care in the nation (AARP Public Policy
Institute, 2011). As the population rapidly ages (Jacobsen,
Kent, & Lee, Mather, 2011), there will be a greater need
for family caregivers' contributions. The interplay of recent
societal and demographic trends, however, has complicated
the provision of family care. Americans are remaining in
the workforce longer and employment among older women
is at a record high (Blakely, 2011; Jacobsen et al., 2011).
At home, women continue to outnumber men as family
caregivers (National Alliance for Caregiving and AARP,
2009). Collectively, these trends indicate that the number of
women balancing work and caregiving roles is increasing
(Gordon, Pruchno, Wilson-Genderson, Murphy, & Rose,
2012). Caregiving is further complicated by delayed child-
birth and longer life expectancy, which can leave women
"sandwiched" between caring for dependent children and
older adults while working (e.g., Pierret, 2006). Yet, one
of the most complex combinations of work and caregiving
roles is also one that has been neglected in the literature--
women who provide formal care at work and informal care
at home or double-duty care (Ward-Griffin, 2004).
The healthcare industry is currently facing significant
challenges from accelerated population aging, such as
retaining an aging workforce already older than that found
in other industry sectors, providing care to a rising num-
ber of older patients, and recruiting healthcare workers
to counter a potentially severe nursing shortage amidst an
increasing demand for services (Harrington & Heidkamp,
2013; Hatcher, 2006; Institute of Medicine of the National
Academies, 2008). Given that women dominate the major-
ity of professions within the healthcare industry and
typically enact family caregiving roles (National Alliance
for Caregiving and AARP, 2009; U.S. Bureau of Labor
Statistics, 2013), the increasing likelihood that healthcare
employees will be balancing caregiving demands at home
presents an additional challenge (Ward-Griffin et al., 2009).
Despite this projection, empirical investigations of women
simultaneously participating in both private and public
domains of care were "almost non-existent" a decade ago
(Ward-Griffin et al., 2005, p. 381) and remain limited to
date (Boumans & Dorant, 2014). Instead, researchers have
primarily considered professional, paid caregiving and per-
sonal, unpaid caregiving to be separate domains (Ward-
Griffin, 2008).
We address this limitation by conducting a timely exam-
ination of the psychosocial implications associated with
double- and triple-duty care. To our knowledge, only one
study has examined the implications of multiple caregiving
roles among healthcare employees (Scott et al., 2006). That
study assessed the impact of providing child, elder, and
sandwiched care at home on hospital staff nurses' fatigue
and stress. Nurses with family caregiving roles reported
more stress, physical fatigue, and mental fatigue relative to
their nonfamily caregiving counterparts. Specifically, levels
of fatigue and stress were highest among nurses engaging
in sandwiched care at home. However, the Scott and cow-
orkers (2006) study was limited by a small sample of elder
and sandwiched caregivers (32 and 29, respectively). The
current study is therefore the first to examine the psychoso-
cial implications associated with different family caregiving
roles among a large, unique sample of women working in
nursing homes in the United States.
Conceptual Framework:The Stress Process
We adapted the stress process model (Pearlin et al., 1990)
to examine the perceived psychosocial implications of dou-
ble- and triple-duty care. The stress process model is based
on the concept of proliferation (Pearlin & Aneshensel,
1994; Pearlin, Aneshensel, & LeBlanc, 1997). Proliferation
occurs when a stressor or set of stressors experienced in
the family caregiving role generate new problems in other
roles or lead to an accumulation of stressors that spread to
multiple life domains (e.g., work). The stress process model
also distinguishes between primary and secondary stress-
ors. Within the context of family caregiving, primary stress-
ors are directly rooted in caregiving hardships and drive the
stress process by producing other stressors. In this paper,
primary stressors refer to subjective appraisals of hardships
encountered in family caregiving roles. Secondary stressors
are exacerbated or influenced by primary stressors; they
arise as a result of caregiving demands but occur in other
roles. In the current study, we pose the following questions
202 Journals of Gerontology: PSYCHOLOGICAL SCIENCES, 2016, Vol. 71, No. 2
for both sets of stressors: How do nonfamily caregiving
healthcare employees differ from women with combined
caregiving roles? How do women with combined caregiv-
ing roles differ from each other?
Primary Stressors
We consider two subjective indicators of primary stress-
ors, perceived stress and psychological distress. Given
that women in combined caregiving roles provide care
at work and at home, they may be exposed to challenges
beyond typical stressors associated with family caregiving.
For instance, relative to home-based care workers, nurs-
ing home employees indicate more physical and emotional
strain (Hasson & Arnetz, 2008). Indeed, these nurses
engage in physically demanding tasks and experience work-
place stressors ranging from witnessing the decline and/or
death of patients to respecting patients' autonomy when
confronted with physical resistance (Ross et al., 1994;
VonDras, Flittner, Malcore, & Pouliot, 2009). However,
healthcare employees may anticipate or expect such stress-
ors because it is likely that they self-selected into their
employment role (Pearlin & Aneshensel, 1994). That is,
because healthcare employment is a role that women have
embarked on, prepared for, or settled into, they are aware
of or familiar with its stressors. Similarly, double-duty
child caregivers may be balancing two expected care roles
in that child care is often regarded as a more normative
or planned role relative to other family care roles (Pearlin
& Aneshensel, 1994). Further, unlike caring for an elderly
person, child care recipients become increasingly independ-
ent over time and care arrangements are often more stable
(Hessel & Keck, 2009). Thus, double-duty child caregiv-
ers may subjectively experience hardships more similarly to
nonfamily caregivers than double-duty elder or triple-duty
caregivers.
In contrast, double-duty elder and triple-duty caregiv-
ers may be balancing expected and unexpected care roles.
Qualitative data from double-duty elder caregivers sug-
gests that they are often not self-selected into their fam-
ily caregiving role; rather, women describe facing strong
familial pressure to provide family care because of their
gender and healthcare expertise (Ward-Griffin et al., 2005).
Double-duty elder caregivers also mention family mem-
bers' heavy reliance on them for providing or coordinating
care, being pressured to accept more care responsibilities
than desired, and having high expectations of themselves to
provide quality care. These findings are reminiscent of role
captivity, wherein an individual unwillingly enacts or feels
trapped by a family caregiving role (Pearlin et al., 1997).
Role captivity is associated with distress, partially because
family caregivers feel that they lack control or power over
aspects of their own lives (Pearlin & Aneshensel, 1994). In
addition, elder care has been considered more emotionally
demanding as well as less predictable than child care given
that elder care recipients' needs increase over time, change
suddenly, and last for an unspecified period of time (Hessel
& Keck, 2009). Double-duty elder and triple-duty caregiv-
ers may therefore indicate more primary stressors relative
to their nonfamily caregiving counterparts and double-duty
child caregivers.
Secondary Stressors
The designated secondary stressors for our investigation
focus on role strains within the major institutions of work
and family. With women increasingly balancing employ-
ment and family caregiving, interest in work­family issues
and the implications of multiple roles has grown (Gordon
et al., 2012). Yet, research to date has largely not consid-
ered the work­family interface for women with combined
caregiving roles (Ward-Griffin, 2004). Acknowledging that
secondary stressors typically arise when there are con-
flicts between social roles (Knussen, Tolson, Swan, Stott,
& Brogan, 2005), the current study examines healthcare
employees' appraisals of work­family conflict (bidirec-
tional) and work-to-family (unidirectional) positive spill-
over. Although positive spillover may seem discrepant in
comparison to our other psychosocial indicators, we con-
sider this a work­family strain or subjective secondary
stressor to the degree in which work-to-family positive
spillover is diminished or absent (Pearlin et al., 1990).
While we are unaware of any studies that have assessed
work­family stressors among triple-duty caregivers, prior
evidence suggests that double-duty elder caregivers indicate
both positive and negative work­family outcomes, whereas
double-duty child caregivers report negative effects. For
instance, a previous study of hospital-based nurses found
that double-duty child care was correlated with work­fam-
ily conflict, but double-duty elder care was not (Gottlieb,
Kelloway, & Martin-Matthews, 1996). In contrast,
Boumans and Dorant (2014) found that more hours of fam-
ily care provision was associated with greater work­family
conflict as well as family-to-work positive spillover among
double-duty elder caregivers. These work­family conflict
findings are consistent with qualitative data from double-
duty elder caregivers in which women express feelings of
prolonged caregiving, the perception of being on-call all
day with limited or no time off, and a continuous negotia-
tion and subsequent renegotiation of professional and per-
sonal role boundaries (Ward-Griffin et al., 2011). Boumans
and Dorant (2014) attributed their positive spillover find-
ings to the role expansion perspective, which posits that
individuals benefit from balancing multiple roles by accu-
mulating or enhancing resources such as mastery, social
support, and personal accomplishment. Indeed, double-
duty elder caregivers identify recognition, self-esteem, and
opportunities for personal and family growth as rewarding
aspects of family caregiving in qualitative interviews (Ross
et al., 1994). Boumans and Dorant (2014) also noted that
role expansion may be especially applicable to double-duty
elder caregivers because their care roles are essentially an
203

extension of each other, with similar knowledge or skills
used in both roles to manage comparable care demands.
The current study also utilizes a subsample of healthcare
employees in a wider family network through their roles
as a spouse or partner (n = 893). The presence of a spouse
or partner does not mean an individual automatically ben-
efits from partner support; rather, relationship quality is
more critical for support (Pearlin, Lieberman, Menaghan,
& Mullan, 1981). Thus, women who positively appraise
partner relationship quality may be able to capitalize on
partner support to avoid, eliminate, or reduce stressors
when confronted with caregiving hardships. For instance,
support encompassing both personal and professional
resources has been negatively correlated with the degree
of blurring between professional and personal care roles
(Ward-Griffin et al., 2011). We therefore assess healthcare
employees' perceptions of partner relationship quality
(partner support and strain) to understand whether women
with combined caregiving roles view partners as resources
or stressors. Similar to work-to-family positive spillover, we
considered partner support to be a stressor to the degree
in which it is diminished or absent. We also decided not
to examine partner support as a moderating resource to
explain stressor variation; rather, we opted for a compre-
hensive assessment of proliferated stressors among women
with combined caregiving roles. That is, we sought to
assess differences in exposure to proliferated stressors and
examine whether healthcare employees with varying family
caregiving roles are different in their exposure to stressors
rather than assume similar exposure across roles (Pearlin
et al., 1997).
Method
Sample and Procedures
Data derive from the Work, Family, and Health Study
(WFHS), which examined work and family life outcomes
among healthcare employees (Bray et al., 2013). Employees
were recruited from 30 nursing homes spanning six states,
all owned by the same long-term health and specialized
care company. Eligible employees worked a minimum of
22.5
hr per week in direct patient care, were not exclu-
sively night shift workers, and received study information
through recruiting materials and informed consent docu-
ments. Of 1,783 eligible employees, 1,524 (85%) enrolled
in the WFHS. Participants completed 1-hr long computer-
assisted personal interviews regarding work experiences,
personal well-being, and family relationships at a private
location in the workplace.
The current study focuses on the 1,399 women who
agreed to be interviewed. Women had a mean age of 38.7
(SD = 12.7, range = 18­72), 72% were non-Hispanic White,
and 64% were married or in a cohabiting relationship.
Most (67%) held positions as certified nursing assistants
(CNA) and registered nurses or licensed practical nurses
(28%). Sixty-one percent of women had some college
education or were college graduates and the modal house-
hold income was $60,000 or more. Just over half (52%)
worked a regular daytime shift and the average company
tenure was 6.33 years (SD = 6.61, range = 1­42).
Measures
Combined caregiving roles
We categorized employees into four groups based on exist-
ing child and elder care measures from the WFHS, which
are comparable to those found in other studies (e.g.,
Dautzenberg et al., 2000; Neal & Hammer, 2007; Tement
& Korunka, 2013). Dependent child care was defined as
having children 18 years of age or younger living with the
employee for at least 4 days per week.Elder care was defined
as providing care (e.g., help with shopping, medical care, or
assistance in financial/budget planning) for at least 3hr per
week in the past 6 months to an adult relative, regardless of
their living situation. Triple-duty caregivers satisfied crite-
ria for both the child and elder care measures. Two women
were excluded from family care classifications for indicat-
ing they had children but not providing their ages. Overall,
there were 498 (36%) nonfamily caregivers, 475 (34%)
double-duty child caregivers, 228 (16%) double-duty elder
caregivers, and 196 (14%) triple-duty caregivers. On aver-
age, both double-duty child (SD = 0.95) and triple-duty
(SD = 1.02) caregivers reported having 1.93 children living
at home. The average age of dependent children was 6.81
(SD = 5.18) and 8.29 (SD = 5.31) in double-duty child and
triple-duty caregiving households, respectively.
Primary stressors
We used a global measure of perceived stress (Cohen,
Kamarck, & Mermelstein, 1983) and the K6 measure
of psychological distress (Kessler et al., 2003). Perceived
stress comprised four items (e.g., "How often have you
felt that things were going your way?") pertaining to the
last 30 days. Responses ranged from 1 (very often) to 5
(never). We reverse-coded two items and summed responses
to compute perceived stress scores ranging from 4 to 20,
with higher scores reflecting more stress ( = .76). Six
items examined psychological distress (e.g., "How much of
the time did you feel hopeless?") during the past 30 days.
Responses ranged from 1 (none of the time) to 5 (all of the
time). We summed responses to compute a composite dis-
tress score ranging from 6 to 30, with higher scores denot-
ing greater distress ( = .84).
Secondary stressors
We used the work­family conflict scale from Netermeyer,
Boles, and McMurrian (1996). Five items pertained to
work-to-family conflict (e.g., "The demands of your work
interfere with your family or personal time") and five items
assessed family-to-work conflict (e.g., "Family-related
strain interferes with your ability to perform job-related
duties") in the past 6 months. Responses ranged from 1
204 Journals of Gerontology: PSYCHOLOGICAL SCIENCES, 2016, Vol. 71, No. 2
(strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). Higher scores
reflect more work-to-family ( = .88) and family-to-work
( = .79) conflict. The WFHS also included the affective
spillover subscale from Hanson, Hammer, and Colton
(2004) to examine work-to-family positive spillover. The
scale comprised four items (e.g., "Being happy at work
helps you to be happy at home"), with responses ranging
from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). Higher
scores indicate greater work-to-family positive spillover
( = .85).
We adopted a measure of partner relationship quality
from Schuster, Kessler, and Aseltine (1990). Five items eval-
uated support (e.g., "Does your partner appreciate you?")
and five items examined strain (e.g., "Does your partner
criticize you?") within the past month. Responses ranged
from 1 (not at all) to 4 (a lot). We summed all items for
each subscale, which resulted in a total score ranging from
5 to 20. Higher scores reflect greater support ( = .92) and
strain ( = .83).
Covariates
We selected a number of demographic, employment, and
health covariates motivated by the stress process model
and past research. The model considers caregivers' social
and economic background characteristics, specific fea-
tures of the family caregiving context, and the caregivers'
health status to be key characteristics influencing stressors
(Pearlin et al., 1990). Caregivers' ascribed statuses, such
as age (in years) and race (White, other), along with edu-
cational attainment (postsecondary education or not) and
income (measured in $5,000 increments up to $60,000
or more), are embedded in the stress process. Further,
adults' perceived stress, subjective well-being, and caregiv-
ing strain have differed by demographic characteristics in
prior research (Jivraj, Nazroo, Vanhoutte, & Chandola,
2014; Perkins et al., 2013; Vasunilashorn, Lynch, Glei,
Weinstein, & Goldman, 2014); we therefore examine these
background characteristics as potential statistical controls.
We also consider marital status (married/cohabiting versus
single) because partners are part of employees' networks
and may provide support; indeed, the continuously mar-
ried are considered advantaged in psychological well-being
(Sasson & Umberson, 2014). Additionally, we select fea-
tures of the employment role controlled for in previous
double-duty care and healthcare employee studies, includ-
ing hours worked per week, company tenure, and occupa-
tional status (CNA vs. other) (Boumans & Dorant, 2014;
Schrijnemaekers et al., 2003). We also include the psycho-
logical job demands scale from Karasek and coworkers
(1998) because work demands are linked to greater work­
family conflict (Gordon et al., 2012), and elder care is asso-
ciated with work-related strain (Trukeschitz, Schneider,
Mühlmann, & Ponocny, 2013); higher scores indicate
greater job demands ( = .59).
To account for family caregiving context, we control
for developmental disabilities, physical health problems,
or long-term, serious mental health problems among
dependent children. With regard to health status, we assess
employees' diagnoses of chronic health conditions (diabe-
tes, cancer, and high blood pressure) as such conditions
have been differentially associated with caregiving strain
(Perkins et al., 2013). Similar to prior research, history of
chronic health conditions was obtained by dichotomous
indicators (e.g., "Has a doctor ever told you that you have
cancer?") (Perkins et al., 2013). Given its relationship to
emotional well-being over the life course (Windsor, Burns,
& Byles, 2013), we also examine employees' functional
disabilities with the physical functioning subscale from the
SF-36, which assesses the ability to perform various physi-
cal activities (e.g., climbing stairs); higher scores indicate
better physical functioning ( = .87; Ware & Sherbourne,
1992).
Analytic Strategy
We first examine employees' demographic, employment,
and health characteristics for potential inclusion as covari-
ates in multivariate analysis by conducting analysis of
variance tests with Tukey post hoc comparisons to iden-
tify mean differences among nonfamily, double-duty child,
double-duty elder, and triple-duty caregivers. We include
any variables on which the groups differ significantly, in
addition to child disability, as covariates. Next, we perform
multiple linear regression analysis to predict the psycho-
social implications (primary stressors: perceived stress,
psychological distress; secondary stressors: work­family
conflict, partner relationship quality) of double- and triple-
duty care with nonfamily caregivers as the reference group.
We also analyze adjusted mean differences with analysis of
covariance (ANCOVA) tests using Tukey post hoc compari-
sons to assess how women with combined caregiving roles
differ from each other. For relationship quality analyses, we
restrict the sample to married and cohabiting employees
(n = 893).
Results
Background and Context of the Stress Process
Table 1 provides information about demographic, work,
and health characteristics by combined caregiving roles.
Employees differed by age, marital status, race, company
tenure, psychological job demands, functional disability,
and high blood pressure. We therefore used these vari-
ables, as well as child disability, as covariates. On average,
double-duty child and triple-duty caregivers were younger
than nonfamily and double-duty elder caregivers, married
or cohabiting to a greater extent than double-duty elder
caregivers, and were more racially diverse and had shorter
company tenure than nonfamily caregivers. Additionally,
double-duty child caregivers were married or cohabiting
more and had better physical functioning scores relative
to nonfamily caregivers as well as had shorter company
205

tenure and reported high blood pressure to a lesser extent
than double-duty elder caregivers. Both double-duty elder
and triple-duty caregivers indicated greater psychological
job demands than nonfamily caregivers.
Psychosocial Implications
Multiple regression and ANCOVA results are presented
in Tables 2 and 3, respectively. Company tenure and high
blood pressure were nonsignificant predictors across mod-
els and subsequently removed; this did not affect model fit
or alter results. For each psychosocial indicator we present
regression results first, in which no family care is the refer-
ence group, and then discuss adjusted mean differences in
outcome scores across all four groups of employees.
Nonfamily Caregivers versus Double-Duty Child,
Double-Duty Elder, andTriple-Duty Caregivers
Primary stressors
Double-duty elder and triple-duty care were associated
with greater perceived stress and psychological distress
in regression analysis. A subsequent ANCOVA comple-
mented these findings; double-duty elder and triple-duty
caregivers had higher perceived stress (p < .05 and p <
.05, respectively) and psychological distress (p < .001 and
p <.001, respectively) scores. Additionally, employees who
were older, White, married or cohabiting, and had better
physical functioning indicated fewer subjective primary
stressors, whereas child disability and more psychological
job demands were linked to more primary stressors.
Secondary stressors
In regression analysis, triple-duty care was associated with
greater work-to-family conflict, with the same findings
emerging in a follow-up ANCOVA (p < .05). Child disabil-
ity and more psychological job demands were also related
to greater work-to-family conflict, whereas better physical
functioning and older age were linked to less work-to-fam-
ily conflict. All three combined caregiving roles predicted
more family-to-work conflict, but none of the combined
caregiving roles were associated with work-to-family posi-
tive spillover; ANCOVA results complemented these find-
ings in that double-duty child (p < .01), double-duty elder
(p < .001), and triple-duty (p < .01) caregivers had higher
family-to-work conflict scores, and there were no group
differences for positive spillover. Employees who were
older, White, married, and had better physical functioning
also reported less family-to-work conflict. As for partner
relationship quality, both double-duty child and triple-duty
care were associated with less support and greater strain.
Similarly, double-duty child and triple-duty caregivers had
lower support (p < .05 and p < .01, respectively) and higher
strain (p < .001 and p < .001, respectively) scores. Child dis-
ability was also associated with less partner support while
better physical functioning predicted less partner strain.

Double-Duty Child Care versus Double-Duty
Elder Care versusTriple-Duty Care
ANCOVA results indicated that triple-duty caregivers had
higher psychological distress (primary stressor, p < .001)
and work-to-family conflict (secondary stressor, p < .05)
scores than double-duty child caregivers. Additionally,
double-duty elder caregivers had higher psychological dis-
tress scores than double-duty child caregivers (p < .001).
Double-duty elder and triple-duty caregivers did not signifi-
cantly differ on any psychosocial indicators.
Discussion
Women with combined caregiving roles represent a unique
group of working caregivers. Given their invaluable soci-
etal contributions and an increasing need for their services,
it is essential to acquire additional information about this
understudied population. The present study builds on exist-
ing literature by broadening the perspective of double-duty
care, focusing on women working in nursing homes in the
United States, and examining the psychosocial implications
of double- and triple-duty care.
Double-Duty Caregivers
Our findings suggest that double-duty child caregivers
experience fewer stressors, particularly subjective primary
stressors, in comparison to employees balancing elder and
sandwiched care roles. This group, however, indicated
greater secondary stressors in the form of family-related
strains relative to nonfamily caregivers. Our results are
consistent with a study on hospital-based nurses that found
positive correlations between child care and strain- and
time-based family-to-work conflict (Gottlieb et al., 1996).
Further, parenthood has been linked to lower marital sat-
isfaction, a finding attributed to role conflicts and restric-
tion of parents' freedom, which reflects double-duty child
caregivers' poorer relationship quality (Twenge, Campbell,
& Foster, 2003). Our findings also align with prior research
suggesting that child care is a more normative role and
that working child caregivers are least likely to experience
self-loss or depression (Hessel & Keck, 2009; Pearlin &
Aneshensel, 1994). Moreover, these results are consistent
with our expectation that double-duty child caregivers' sub-
jectively experience hardships more similarly to nonfamily
caregivers than double-duty elder and triple-duty caregivers.
Our results also suggest that double-duty elder caregivers
experience more negative subjective primary stressors and
family-related strains conflicting with work than their non-
family caregiving counterparts. These findings complement
a prior study by Boumans and Dorant (2014), which found
that more family care hours were associated with poorer
mental health, more emotional exhaustion, and increased
home-to-work conflict among double-duty elder caregiv-
ers. Further, our results align with qualitative evidence from
double-duty elder caregivers in which women speak about

heightened stress from comprehension of care recipients'
medical conditions; guilt, powerlessness, and helplessness if
they lack needed clinical expertise or make poor medical
decisions; and blurred boundaries between professional and
familial caregiving roles (Ward-Griffin, 2004), all of which
may psychologically transfer between work and home
domains and manifest through stress and distress.
Triple-Duty Caregivers
Overall, triple-duty care was associated with poorer psy-
chosocial well-being relative to no family care; triple-duty
caregivers also had greater work-to-family conflict and
psychological distress scores than double-duty child car-
egivers. These results are consistent with previous work by
Scott and coworkers (2006), who found that hospital staff
nurses with sandwiched care obligations at home indicated
greater mental fatigue and increased stress compared with
their nonfamily caregiving counterparts. Interestingly, psy-
chosocial implications did not differ between double-duty
elder and triple-duty caregivers; rather, these caregivers
both reported more family-related strain and negative pri-
mary stressors compared with nonfamily caregivers. Unlike
double-duty elder caregivers, however, triple-duty caregiv-
ers reported greater work-related strain and poorer rela-
tionship quality than nonfamily caregivers, which raises
questions about the availability and utilization of profes-
sional and personal support among this group.
Limitations
Our study is the first to use a large sample of women work-
ing in nursing homes in the United States to examine the
psychosocial implications of double- and triple-duty care.
Nevertheless, we utilize self-report data and a cross-sec-
tional, correlational design, which constrains the ability
to identify causal relationships or detect changes in stress-
ors. Considering our focus on nursing home workers, our
findings may also not be generalizable to other healthcare
employees (e.g., physicians). Although we used a diverse
sample, everyone worked for the same corporation, further
limiting generalizability. We were also unable to exhaus-
tively examine covariates with the potential to influence
stressors, such as employees' perceptions of the division of
household labor or specific features of caring for an older
adult. Given our use of multiple regressions, our analy-
sis does not account for the bias of unobserved variables.
Further, although we assessed negative and positive work­
family outcomes, the WFHS did not include a family-to-
work positive spillover measure.
Moreover, we conducted a secondary analysis of data
from the WFHS, which was not specifically designed to
study caregiving. Similar to Tement and Korunka (2013)
and Scott and coworkers (2006), we applied proxy meas-
ures of family caregiving roles to determine role occu-
pancy and did not possess information regarding objective
primary stressors or caregiving demands (e.g., elder care
recipients' health status). However, subjective reactions to
caregiving have played a larger role in prior research on
stress proliferation among caregivers than objective physi-
cal demands (Knussen et al., 2005). Additionally, a sub-
sample of employees in the current study participated in
qualitative interviews in which they were asked about elder
care obligations. Employees mentioned caring for an aging
relative who is chronically ill, in declining health, or has
multiple health problems (end-stage renal disease, demen-
tia, diabetes), monitoring parents' health status, assisting
with recovery from adverse health events (post-stroke, hip

replacement surgery, paralysis), helping with daily activi-
ties (bathing, dressing, transportation), managing par-
ents' estates, and overseeing professional or hospice care.
Employees also mentioned being emotionally preoccupied
with care recipients' health when at work. Thus, even
though we do not assess objective primary stressors, quali-
tative evidence from the WFHS suggests that employees
cared for older adults with a variety of health conditions
and engaged in a range of caregiving tasks. One advantage
of the current approach is that, given the diversity of care
situations reported, our sample may be more representative
of working caregivers than a sample selected for a certain
threshold of care or diagnosis (e.g., dementia). Indeed, our
heterogeneous sample may actually underestimate the psy-
chosocial implications of double- and triple-duty care.
Future Directions
We have several suggestions for future double- and triple-
duty care research, which should be a priority amidst an
aging population, older workforce, and growing number
of working caregivers. First, researchers should assess
whether these caregivers find existing workplace programs,
practices, and policies relevant or useful for their unique
work­family demands. This is particularly important for
single healthcare employees with family care obligations.
Nearly half of double-duty elder caregivers in the WFHS
sample were single, automatically leaving them without
access to the potential resource of partner support. To
compensate for a lack of resources at home, single double-
and triple-duty caregivers may rely on workplace supports
more heavily. Alternatively, supportive policies may be in
place but family caregivers may fear workplace penalties
for utilization or overutilization of available formal sup-
port. Prospective qualitative research could explore these
issues further by asking double- and triple-duty caregivers
to identity perceived barriers to workplace supports and
also discuss key resources at home for facilitating work-life
balance in the absence of partner support.
Further, healthcare employers can administer work-
force and workplace assessments to examine as well as
monitor the changing demographics, skills, and work-
life demands of their current workforce (Harrington &
Heidkamp, 2013; Neal & Hammer, 2007; Ward-Griffin
et al., 2009). The subjective stressors associated with dou-
ble- and triple-duty care will likely become a greater con-
cern for the healthcare industry as it seeks to retain or
hire employees with an increased likelihood of family care
obligations at home. Workplace assessments may provide
important insight regarding effective strategies for attract-
ing and retaining employees as well as identifying alter-
nate pathways into retirement (Sweet, Pitt-Catsouphes,
Besen, Hovhannisyan, & Pasha, 2010). Feedback from
these assessments could also be used to develop appro-
priate and targeted work-life strategies, flexible or cus-
tomized scheduling practices, family-friendly policies,
health-promoting practices, and supervisor behavior
training programs with an emphasis on work­family
support (Kossek, Hammer, Kelly, & Moen, 2014). In
turn, such changes could reduce turnover, increase job
satisfaction, enhance health, and facilitate work-life bal-
ance (Harrington & Heidkamp, 2013), all of which may
benefit care recipients by decreasing caregivers' stressors
and increasing resources. Moreover, engaging employees
in decision-making processes regarding workplace prac-
tices and policies may provide family caregivers with the
opportunity to inform employers about aspects of their
job that create work­family conflict and also propose
ways to ameliorate such situations (Sweet et al., 2010).
Additional research on the prevalence, types, and implica-
tions of double- and triple-duty care among both women
and men employed in different occupations within the
healthcare industry is also warranted.
