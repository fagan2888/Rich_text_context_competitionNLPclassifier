Prevalence estimates are presented as the number of persons one would need to screen to identify one participant with the constellation of findings specified in
the left-hand column of the table.
For example, if screening the diabetic population ages 20 to 39 with a urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio alone, 4 persons would need to be screened to identify
one person with albuminuria. Point estimates are provided with 95% confidence intervals. Albuminuria describes the presence of either microalbuminuria or
macroalbuminuria. Serum creatinine is in mol/L; GFR is glomerular filtration rate in mL/min/1.73 m2.
a Estimate was based on 10 or less unweighted participants demonstrating the finding, and as a result should be interpreted with caution
