OBJECTIVE -- The purpose of this study was to examine the prevalences of diagnosed and
undiagnosed diabetes, and impaired fasting glucose (IFG) in U.S. adults during 1999­2002, and
compare prevalences to those in 1988­1994.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS -- The National Health and Nutrition Exami-
nation Survey (NHANES) contains a probability sample of adults aged 20 years. In the
NHANES 1999­2002, 4,761 adults were classified on glycemic status using standard criteria,
based on an interview for diagnosed diabetes and fasting plasma glucose measured in a
subsample.
RESULTS -- The crude prevalence of total diabetes in 1999­2002 was 9.3% (19.3 million,
2002 U.S. population), consisting of 6.5% diagnosed and 2.8% undiagnosed. An additional
26.0% had IFG, totaling 35.3% (73.3 million) with either diabetes or IFG. The prevalence of total
diabetes rose with age, reaching 21.6% for those aged 65 years. The prevalence of diagnosed
diabetes was twice as high in non-Hispanic blacks and Mexican Americans compared with
non-Hispanic whites (both P  0.00001), whereas the prevalence of undiagnosed diabetes was
similar by race/ethnicity, adjusted for age and sex. The prevalence of diagnosed diabetes was
similar by sex, but prevalences of undiagnosed diabetes and IFG were significantly higher in
men. The crude prevalence of diagnosed diabetes rose significantly from 5.1% in 1988­1994 to
6.5% in 1999­2002, but the crude prevalences were stable for undiagnosed diabetes (from 2.7
to 2.8%) and IFG (from 24.7 to 26.0%). Results were similar after adjustment for age and sex.
CONCLUSIONS -- Although the prevalence of diagnosed diabetes has increased signifi-
cantly over the last decade, the prevalences of undiagnosed diabetes and IFG have remained
relatively stable. Minority groups remain disproportionately affected.

Diabetes and its complications are
major causes of morbidity and mor-
tality in the U.S. (1). The economic
cost of diabetes in medical expenditures
and lost productivity was estimated to be
$132 billion in the U.S. in 2002 (2). Na-
tionally the prevalence of self-reported di-
agnosed diabetes has steadily increased
over time (3), but the extent to which this
increase is due to enhanced detection is
uncertain. Undiagnosed diabetes and im-
paired fasting glucose (IFG) also have im-
portant health consequences (4,5). Only
one nationally representative survey, The
National Health and Nutrition Examina-
tion Survey (NHANES), examines both
diagnosed diabetes and undiagnosed dia-
betes. This survey showed that from 1988
to 1994, undiagnosed diabetes comprised
approximately one-third of total diabetes
(diagnosed and undiagnosed) in U.S.
adults (6). The prevalence of IFG was
nearly as high as the prevalence of total
diabetes. In 1999, the NHANES became a
continuous annual survey with data re-
leased every 2 years, and we reported the
prevalence of diagnosed diabetes, undiag-
nosed diabetes, and IFG in adults based
on data from 1999 to 2000 (7). The lim-
ited sample size in these 2 years, however,
restricted the detail and reliability of our
analyses. New criteria for defining IFG
have since been adopted (8,9), and only
limited estimates of the prevalence of IFG
based on this new definition have been
reported using the 2 years of data from
NHANES 1999 to 2000 (10).
In this report, we analyze the preva-
lence of diagnosed diabetes, undiagnosed
diabetes, and IFG in adults in the U.S.
using 4 years of the NHANES data
(1999­2002). Results are examined in
detail according to age, sex, and race/
ethnicity. We compare these prevalence
estimates to those from the NHANES
1988­1994.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND
METHODS -- The NHANES 1999­
2002 was conducted by the National
Center for Health Statistics (11). The
survey is designed to be representative
of the U.S. civilian noninstitutionalized
population, on the basis of a complex,
multistage probability sample. Survey
participants are interviewed in their
homes and subsequently receive a phys-
ical and laboratory examination in a
mobile examination center. Among eli-

gible subjects, 83.0% were interviewed
and 78.0% were examined.
In 1999­2002, 10,291 individuals
aged 20 years completed the household
interview. Questions covered demo-
graphic characteristics and medical con-
ditions, including a history of diabetes.
Specifically, individuals were asked if,
other than during pregnancy for women,
a doctor or health care professional had
ever told them they had diabetes. Based
on this question, 991 individuals aged
20 years were classified as having diag-
nosed diabetes. Three additional individ-
uals were excluded from analyses because
of missing diabetes information.
Each household was randomly as-
signed to either a morning or afternoon/
evening examination session. There were
4,271 individuals aged 20 years with-
out diagnosed diabetes who were as-
signed to a morning session, and plasma
glucose values were obtained from 3,770
(88.3%) of them after they fasted for 8 to
24 h. This group is subsequently re-
ferred to as the plasma glucose sub-
sample. Recommendations for the
diagnosis of diabetes are based on studies
of plasma glucose measured after an over-
night fast (9). Pregnant women (n  236)
were included, and none had undiagnosed
diabetes based on their fasting plasma glu-
cose (FPG) values. Plasma glucose values
were not analyzed for 420 people with in-
valid or unknown fasting times and 81 peo-
ple with unknown glucose values.
The procedures for blood collection
and processing are described elsewhere
(11). Plasma glucose was measured at a
central laboratory using a hexokinase en-
zymatic method, with a coefficient of vari-
ation of 3% during the 4 years of the
survey. Standard diagnostic criteria were
used to categorize people without diag-
nosed diabetes as to whether they had un-
diagnosed diabetes (FPG 7.0 mmol/l)
or IFG (FPG 5.6 to 7.0 mmol/l) (9).
Race/ethnicity was categorized according
to NHANES guidelines to allow compar-
ison across the surveys (11). Age was cat-
egorized as 60 years for consistency
with NHANES guidelines (11) and 65
years to provide findings relevant to the
Medicare population.
Estimates from the NHANES 1999­
2002 are compared with those from the
NHANES III conducted during 1988­
1994. The NHANES III used similar in-
terview questions on previous diagnosis of
diabetes (6,11). The same collection meth-
ods and laboratory were used for all speci-
mens to determine FPG concentration (11).
Sampling weights were used to pro-
vide estimates that are representative of
the U.S. population (11). For the
NHANES 1999­2002, individuals with
diagnosed diabetes from the entire inter-
viewed sample were combined with indi-
viduals without diagnosed diabetes from
the plasma glucose subsample. Appropri-
ate sampling weights were used so that
the sum of the sample weights from the
two groups added to the total U.S. popu-
lation. For the NHANES 1988­1994,
prevalences of normal fasting glucose, un-
diagnosed diabetes, and IFG in the sub-
sample of people without diagnosed
diabetes were each adjusted for the prev-
alence of diagnosed diabetes from the in-
terview sample, so that the sum of all
diagnostic categories added to the total
U.S. population (12). This difference in
approach for NHANES 1988­1994 was
required because the plasma glucose sub-
sample weights for that survey did not
account for some individuals having in-
valid or unknown fasting times or un-
known plasma glucose values.
To account for different age and sex
distributions between groups and over
time, we derived estimates that were age-
and sex-standardized to the U.S. 2000
Census population using the direct
method, with age categories of 20­39,
40­59, and 60 years. SUDAAN (13)
was used to calculate SEs in the NHANES
1999­2002 based on the Taylor Series
linearization method (14). For the
NHANES 1988­1994, variance estimates
were based on Fay's modified balanced
repeated replication (15), an alternative
method that is preferred for the data pro-
vided in the NHANES 1988­1994. A SAS
routine was written specifically for these
analyses.
CIs were calculated for the logit of
each estimated percentage, and then the
end points were back-transformed (16). A
one-sample t test was used for testing
whether differences between subgroups
in proportions in the NHANES 1999­
2002 were significantly different from
zero. Two-sample t tests were used to test
differences in proportions between the
two surveys. A P value of 0.05 was con-
sidered statistically significant. When we
compared estimates among subgroups or
within subgroups over time, no adjust-
ments were made for multiple compari-
sons in determining the statistical
significance of differences.
RESULTS
Diagnosed diabetes
The prevalence of diagnosed diabetes as-
certained by interview in adults aged 20
years in 1999­2002 is shown in Table 1.
Overall the crude prevalence was 6.5%
for the total population, 5.6% in non-
Hispanic whites, 10.0% in non-Hispanic
blacks, and 6.5% in Mexican Americans.
The prevalence generally rose with age in
all race/ethnic groups and sex-groups,
reaching 15.8% at ages 65 years for the
total population. The overall crude prev-
alence was similar for men (6.7%) and
women (6.3%).
Standardized prevalence estimates are
presented in the last column of Table 1.
Consistent with the age-specific preva-
lences, the age and sex standardized preva-
lence of diagnosed diabetes was about twice
ashighinnon-Hispanicblacks(11.0%)and
Mexican Americans (10.4%) compared
withnon-Hispanicwhites (5.2%, both P 
0.00001). Among non-Hispanic whites,
the standardized prevalences of 6.0% in
men and 4.5% in women were signifi-
cantly different (P  0.02), consistent
with the higher prevalence in men across
all ages until age 65 years. Among non-
Hispanic blacks and Mexican Americans,
however, prevalence estimates standard-
ized by age were not significantly different
between men and women.
Undiagnosed diabetes
The crude prevalence of undiagnosed di-
abetes ascertained by measurement of
FPG in the NHANES 1999­2002 was
2.8% in the total population aged 20
years (Table 2). The prevalence of undi-
agnosed diabetes generally rose with age
in all race/ethnic groups and sex-groups,
reaching 5.8% overall in those aged 65
years. Although the crude percentage of
individuals with undiagnosed diabetes
was significantly lower in Mexican Amer-
icans than in non-Hispanic whites (1.8 vs.
2.9%, P  0.03) and non-Hispanic blacks
(1.8 vs. 3.3%, P  0.04), standardized
prevalences were similar for non-
Hispanic whites, non-Hispanic blacks,
and Mexican Americans. The standard-
ized prevalence of undiagnosed diabetes
was significantly higher in men than in
women in the total population (3.6 vs
2.1%, P  0.02) and in non-Hispanic
whites (3.5 vs. 1.9%, P  0.02), consis-
tent with the higher prevalence in men
across all ages in these groups. The stan-
dardized prevalence of undiagnosed di-
abetes, however, was not different by

sex in non-Hispanic blacks and Mexican
Americans.
IFG
The crude proportion of adults aged 20
years with IFG was 26.0% in 1999­2002
(Table 3). The prevalence of IFG generally
increased with age in all groups, peaking
at 39.1% in the total population aged
65 years. In Mexican-American men,
however, the prevalence of IFG appeared
to peak at middle ages (53.5% at age
40­59 years), although these estimates
are less reliable because of the limited
sample size. Standardized prevalences
were similar to crude estimates. Preva-
lences differed considerably by race/
ethnicity. The overall standardized
prevalence in non-Hispanic blacks
(17.7%) was significantly lower than that in
non-Hispanic whites (26.1%, P  0.0007)
and Mexican Americans (31.6%, P 
0.00001), a pattern consistent across all
ages. Overall standardized prevalence was
lower in non-Hispanic whites than in Mex-
ican Americans (P  0.008). The standard-
ized prevalence was significantly higher in
men(32.8%)thaninwomen(19.5%)inthe
total population (P  0.00001) and in non-
Hispanic whites (33.1 vs. 19.6%, P 
0.00001) and Mexican Americans (42.2 vs.
21.2%, P  0.00001).
Change in prevalences of diabetes
and IFG
Table 4 shows a comparison of the prev-
alence of diagnosed diabetes, undiag-
nosed diabetes, total diabetes (combining
diagnosed and undiagnosed), IFG, and
combined total diabetes and IFG in adults
aged 20 years during 1999­2002 and
1988­1994. Both crude and standard-
ized prevalences are shown. The overall
crude prevalence of diagnosed diabetes
rose significantly from 5.1% in 1988­
1994 to 6.5% in 1999 ­2002 (P 
0.0002). The significant increase was not
merely attributable to changes in the age
and sex distribution between the surveys
since the standardized prevalence also
rose significantly (from 5.4 to 6.5%, P 
0.004). The prevalence of diagnosed dia-
betes increased in all age-groups, sex-
groups, and race/ethnic groups, but the
increase was most prominent in older

from 8.4 to 11.0%, P  0.007). In con-
trast, the prevalence of undiagnosed dia-
betes was stable across the two surveys,
overall (standardized prevalence 2.8% in
both 1988­1994 and 1999­2002) and in
mostsubgroups;oneexceptionwasinMex-
ican Americans in whom there was a sig-
nificant decrease in the crude prevalence,
but no significant change in the standard-
ized prevalence. The overall total crude
prevalence of diabetes (diagnosed and
undiagnosed) increased from 7.8% in
1988­1994 to 9.3% in 1999­2002 (P 
0.007), but the change in standardized
prevalence was less and not statistically
significant (from 8.2 to 9.3%, P  0.06).
The change in standardized prevalence
was most prominent in men (from 8.7 to
10.6%, P  0.02) and in non-Hispanic
blacks (from 12.3 to 14.6%, P  0.04).
The standardized prevalence of IFG was
stable across the two surveys in all groups
(overall from 25.5 to 26.0%) except for
non-Hispanic blacks in whom there was a
decrease (from 23.3 to 17.7%, P 
0.005). The combined prevalence of dia-
betes (diagnosed and undiagnosed) and
IFG was also constant across the two sur-
veys, overall (standardized prevalence
from 33.7 to 35.3%) and in all subgroups.
Ratio of undiagnosed to total
diabetes
In 1999­2002, the percentage of total di-
abetes that was undiagnosed, based on
the ratio of the crude prevalence of undi-
agnosed and total diabetes, was 30.1%
[95% CI 25.834.9] (results in this sec-
tion are not tabulated). Although this per-
centage was lower than that in 1988­
1994 (34.6% [30.6­38.9]) because of the
significant increase in diagnosed diabetes
and stable prevalences of undiagnosed di-
abetes across the two surveys, the change
was not significant (P  0.15), nor was
there a significant change in the standard-
ized percentage of total diabetes that was
undiagnosed between the two surveys
(34.5% in 1988­1994, 30.1% in 1999­
2002, P  0.16). The decreases between
the surveys in the standardized percentage
of total diabetes that was undiagnosed for
non-Hispanic blacks (from 31.5 to 24.8%)
and Mexican Americans (from 31.5 to
22.4%) were not significant. In 1999­
2002, the percentage of diabetes that was
undiagnosed was significantly higher in
non-Hispanic whites (34.0% [95% CI

(21.8% [14.4­29.2], P  0.01) and in men
(34.3% [27.8­40.9]) than in women
(25.5% [19.9­31.1], P  0.05). There
were no significant differences, how-
ever, by age. Similar results were found
using standardized prevalences.
CONCLUSIONS -- Diabetes affects a
substantial proportion of the U.S. popu-
lation. Based on data from the NHANES
1999­2002, 9.3% of persons aged 20
years had either diagnosed or undiag-
nosed diabetes, representing an estimated
19.3 million persons in 2002. This per-
centage rose to 21.6% in those aged 65
years. About one-third (30.1%) of diabe-
tes was undiagnosed. An additional
26.0% of adults had IFG, a condition that
increases the risk for diabetes and is asso-
ciated with other cardiovascular risk fac-
tors (5). Thus, a combined total of 35.3%
of the adult U.S. population (73.3 million
persons) had diabetes or IFG. The preva-
lence of diagnosed diabetes has increased
significantly from 1988­1994 to 1999­
2002, yet prevalences of undiagnosed di-
abetes and IFG have remained relatively
stable. Considerable variation by race/
ethnicity and sex in the prevalences of di-
abetes and IFG continues to exist, once
adjustments are made for differing age/
sex distributions.
Our point estimates, which are based
on 4 years of data, are more precise than
the preliminary estimates, which were
previously reported based on 2 years of
data (7,10). Nevertheless, some of the es-
timates we report here for subgroups de-
fined simultaneously by age, sex, and
race/ethnicity are unreliable, particularly
for the prevalence of undiagnosed diabe-
tes. CI have been provided, however, to
assist reader interpretation.
The FPG value is currently recom-
mended for screening for diabetes and
IFG because it is quick, easy to obtain,
and acceptable to patients in clinical set-
tings. Oral glucose tolerance tests were
not performed in the NHANES 1999­
2002; consequently, additional individu-
als with abnormal postload glucose
tolerance and normal fasting glucose lev-
els have not been identified. Although this
group is unlikely to affect prevalence of
diabetes substantially (8), the addition of
impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) would
significantly increase estimates of total
pre-diabetes (IFG and IGT) (5­6,17). It

should also be noted that determination
of undiagnosed diabetes and IFG in the
NHANES was based on a single plasma
glucose reading from subjects who self-
reported that they fasted appropriately;
this result may not be duplicated upon
retesting as suggested for diagnosis in a
clinical setting. Consequently, some of
the prevalence estimates may be over-
stated. There are no better surveys, how-
ever, for a national assessment of diabetes
and pre-diabetes using current diagnostic
criteria.
Although the increase in total diabe-
tes over the last decade was not statisti-
cally significant, the prevalence did rise
significantly in men and in non-Hispanic
blacks. Overweight and obesity have also
risen over the last decade (18). Available
data are not sufficient to investigate
whether this association might be causal.
Currently, non-Hispanic blacks and
Mexican Americans have almost twice the
standardized prevalence of total diabetes
of non-Hispanic whites, and no evidence
indicates that this differential has de-
clined over the last decade. Clearly, how-
ever, the proportion of total diabetes that
is undiagnosed is no greater in non-
Hispanic blacks and Mexican Americans
than in non-Hispanic whites. In fact, the
data suggest the possibility that the pro-
portion that is undiagnosed in these
groups has decreased over the last decade.
Possible explanations for such a decrease
are lacking. Decreases over the past sev-
eral decades in the proportion of diabetes
that is undiagnosed have occurred only
among the most obese (19).
We found a higher prevalence of both
diagnosed and undiagnosed diabetes in
men than in women among non-Hispanic
whites, but a similar prevalence by sex
among non-Hispanic blacks and Mexican
Americans. Whether this difference by
race/ethnicity is a function of higher
prevalences of overweight and obesity
among non-Hispanic black and Mexican-

American women (18) may warrant fur-
ther research.
Interestingly, the prevalence of IFG in
non-Hispanic blacks was substantially
lower than that in non-Hispanic whites
and Mexican Americans, despite the prev-
alence of diagnosed diabetes in non-
Hispanic blacks being twice as high as
that in non-Hispanic whites and similar to
that in Mexican Americans. This finding
also merits further research.
Lifestyle modification such as weight
management and increased physical ac-
tivity reduces the risk of diabetes among
persons with IGT (20). However, there
are no signs that obesity is abating (18),
and features of insulin resistance are evi-
dent in adolescents with IFG (21). The
prevalence of diagnosed diabetes has in-
creased significantly over the last decade.
Although the prevalences of undiagnosed
diabetes and IFG have remained relatively
stable, the current prevalences of total di-
abetes and IFG are excessive relative to
national health objectives (22), particu-
larly in minority groups.
