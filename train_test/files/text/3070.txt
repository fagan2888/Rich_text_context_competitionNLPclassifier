Screening is vital to preventing vi-
sual loss from diabetes because reti-
nopathy is often asymptomatic early in
the course of the disease.6,7 While no
randomized trials have demonstrated
that screening directly reduces rates of
blindness, simulation models predict a
reduction in visual loss with retinal
screening. A number of previous cost-
effectiveness analyses have demon-
strated that, from a societal or govern-
mental viewpoint, annual screening and
treatment for PDR and macular edema
are cost-effective interventions.8-10 As a
result of these studies, provision of an-
nual screening is being used as a mea-
sure of quality of care, with inclusion
in Health Employer Data and Informa-
tion Set (HEDIS) measures and other
guidelines for diabetes care.11-14 While
these guidelines have been widely dis-
seminated, compliance has been dis-
appointing, with annual screening rates
generally ranging from 18% to 65% and
broad-based population surveys sug-
gesting rates of approximately 50%.15-18

Context Annual eye screening for patients with diabetes mellitus is frequently pro-
posed as a measure of quality of care. However, the benefit of annual vs less frequent
screening intervals has not been well evaluated, especially for low-risk patients.
Objective To examine the marginal cost-effectiveness of various screening inter-
vals for eye disease in patients with type 2 diabetes, stratified by age and level of
glycemic control.
Design Markov cost-effectiveness model.
Setting and Participants Hypothetical patients based on the US population of dia-
betic patients older than 40 years from the Third National Health and Nutrition Ex-
amination Survey.
Main Outcome Measures Patient time spent blind, quality-adjusted life-years
(QALYs), and costs of annual vs less frequent screening compared by age and level of
hemoglobin A1c
.
Results Retinal screening in patients with type 2 diabetes is an effective interven-
tion; however, the risk reduction varies dramatically by age and level of glycemic
control. On average, a high-risk patient who is aged 45 years and has a hemoglo-
bin A1c
level of 11% gains 21 days of sight when screened annually as opposed to
every third year, while a low-risk patient who is aged 65 years and has a hemoglo-
bin A1c
level of 7% gains an average of 3 days of sight. The marginal cost-
effectiveness of screening annually vs every other year also varies; patients in the
high-risk group cost an additional $40 530 per QALY gained, while those in the
low-risk group cost an additional $211 570 per QALY gained. In the US population,
retinal screening annually vs every other year for patients with type 2 diabetes costs
$107 510 per QALY gained, while screening every other year vs every third year
costs $49 760 per QALY gained.
Conclusions Annual retinal screening for all patients with type 2 diabetes without
previously detected retinopathy may not be warranted on the basis of cost-
effectiveness, and tailoring recommendations to individual circumstances may be pref-
erable. Organizations evaluating quality of care should consider costs and benefits care-
fully before setting universal standards.

Previousanalysesofscreeningfordia-
betic eye disease have not adequatelyex-
amined the marginal benefits of in-
creased screening frequency or specific
methods of targeting patients. For ex-
ample, it has been suggested that all pa-
tients with type 2 diabetes be screened
at diagnosis and, if the result is nega-
tive, further screening be deferred for 3
to 4 years.14 Clinical predictors of dia-
betic retinopathy can also be used to ef-
fectively stratify the frequency of dia-
betic eye screening. For example, risk
of retinopathy and eventual blindness
canbestratifiedbylevelofglycemiccon-
trol.12,19-21 Thus, we sought to evaluate
whether hemoglobin A1c
level can be
used to effectively stratify the fre-
quency of diabetic retinal screening and
improve the efficiency and cost-
effectiveness of screening.
METHODS
We created a nonstationary Markov
model22,23 tosimulatetheprogressionof
diabeticretinopathyandmacularedema.
Simulatedpatientswereclassifiedbased
onwhethertheyhadnoretinopathy,non-
proliferative retinopathy (based on the
modified Airlie House classification),24
proliferative retinopathy (levels greater
than53e),macularedema,orblindness
(defined as visual acuity of less than 20/
100inthebettereye).Thesimulatedpa-
tientswerefurtherclassifiedbywhether
they had been diagnosed as having reti-
nopathy or macular edema. The key as-
sumptions and estimates for the model
are outlined in TABLE 1.
To provide a population base of pa-
tients with type 2 diabetes for the study,
we used the characteristics of the dia-
betic population older than 40 years in
the Third National Health and Nutri-
tion Examination Survey (NHANES
III),37 a nationally representative sample
of the US population. Patients were
grouped into initial levels of eye dis-
ease in the model based on the preva-
lenceofvariouslevelsofdiabeticeyedis-
ease reported in NHANES III. We used
ordinal logistic regression to smooth the
predictions of levels of eye disease based
on age and glycemic control. These es-
timates are outlined in TABLE 2.
The model structure is outlined in the
FIGURE.Theincidenceofdevelopingand
progressing through the stages of non-
proliferative retinopathy was assumed
to be related to level of glycemic con-
trol, as outlined in Table 1. The rela-
tionship was derived from the UK Pro-
spectiveDiabetesStudy(UKPDS),which
showed that a decrease of 0.9% in he-
moglobin A1c
(from 7.9% to 7.0%) was
related to a 21% decrease in risk of reti-
nopathy progression over 12 years.21

dent of level of glycemic control.38,39
Rates of such progression were taken
from the Diabetic Retinopathy Study
(DRS) and the Early Treatment of Dia-
betic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS).2,3
Mortality rates were based on life
tables published by the US govern-
ment.37 These were modified to reflect
the increased mortality rates observed
in patients with diabetes in general26-30
and were further adjusted for disease
state based on observed mortality risks
in observational studies.31 The mortal-
ity multipliers are outlined in Table 1.

Patients who were diagnosed as having
high-risk PDR or confirmed high-risk

ter and focal photocoagulation, respec-
tively. Therapy for macular edema was
guidedbyfluoresceinangiography.13 Pho-

is less effective in preventing visual loss
from macular edema than PDR.
Quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs)
were used as the primary model out-
come measure. The model predictions
for overall life expectancy were ad-
justed for time spent blind based on a
utility for blindness of 0.69 in the base-
line case.42-44 Because screening for eye
disease can appear to improve survival
asaresultoftheincreasedobservedmor-
talityratesseeninpatientswithmoread-
vanced eye disease, we standardized life
expectancy to that of annual screening
and calculated the total QALYs for each
screeningintervalbyusingthetimespent
blind and the utility of blindness. Total
effectivenesswasthencalculatedbycom-
paringthetotalQALYswitheachscreen-
ing interval. All costs and years of life
were discounted at 3%.
Costs were standardized by using av-
erage Medicare reimbursement for an
ophthalmology visit with dilated eye ex-
amination, laser photocoagulation (fo-
cal and scatter), and fluorescein angio-
gram. In the baseline case, no direct
costs were attributed to blindness, al-
though the impact of attributing medi-
cal and societal costs to blindness was
explored in sensitivity analyses. In these
sensitivity analyses, we used costs of
blindness from prior cost-effective-
ness analyses9,10,45 to allow compari-
son between studies. Thus, in the base-
line case, we used the perspective of a
third-party payer, while governmen-
tal and societal perspectives were ex-
plored in sensitivity analyses.
We evaluated the costs and effective-
ness of screening the US population of
patients with known type 2 diabetes us-
ing data from NHANES III (Table 2).
The proportions and total numbers of
patients with diabetes in the US popu-
lation were calculated using the survey
weights from NHANES III. We as-
sumed that, at baseline, none of the pa-
tients had been previously screened, so
that at entry, all patients were screened
at the intervals defined in the model. On
diagnosis of retinopathy, patients were
screenedannually.Thepredictionsofthe
model (costs and QALYs) were then ap-
pliedtotheUSpatientpopulation,strati-
fied by age and level of glycemic con-
trol. By summing total QALYs and costs
acrossageandhemoglobinA1c
strataand
comparing these between screening in-
tervals, we were able to calculate the
marginal cost-effectiveness of increas-
ing screening frequency for the popu-
lation of patients with type 2 diabetes in
the United States.
One-way sensitivity analyses were
conducted on individual estimates to as-
sess their impact on the costs and effec-
tiveness of screening. The ranges of es-
timates encompass the ranges reported
in the literature. Because only single
studies were available in some cases (eg,
ETDRS and DRS), a range of possible ef-
fectiveness was estimated for the pur-
poses of sensitivity analyses. These
ranges are outlined in Table 1. Multi-
variate sensitivity analyses were con-
ducted using a simulation approach to
estimate the variance and distribution of
the cost-effectiveness estimates.Thisap-

RESULTS
TABLE 3 shows model predictions for
various health states for 3 selected
groups (high, moderate, and low risk)
of patients. Results for average pre-
dicted time spent blind, using the base-
line case assumptions, are presented in
TABLE 4. As expected, risk of blind-
ness varies by age and hemoglobin A1c
level. For example, in the absence of a
screening program, a 45-year-old pa-
tient who maintains an average hemo-
globin A1c
level of 11% would be pre-
dicted to spend, on average, 358 days
blind during his or her lifetime, while
a 65-year-old patient who maintains a
hemoglobin A1c
level of 7% would be
predicted to spend, on average, 20 days
blind. The estimates of risk in Table 4
clearly show that screening is effective
and that more frequent screening is
more effective. For our prototypical
high-risk case (aged 45 years; average
hemoglobin A1c
, 11%), screening ev-
ery 5 years decreases estimated aver-
age time spent blind by 164 days per
patient (from 358 to 194 days spent
blind), increasing the screening inter-
val to every 3 years reduces time spent
blind by 24 days, and annual screen-
ing further reduces time spent blind by
21 days. For most groups, however, the
marginal return on increasing screen-
ing frequency is small; for example,
screening every 3 years vs no screen-
ing for a 65-year-old patient with he-
moglobin A1c
of 7% reduces time spent
blind from 20 to 12 days, while screen-
ing annually further reduces time spent
blind to 9 days, but at more than twice
the cost ($380 per patient vs $810 per
patient, data not shown).
The marginal cost-effectiveness of in-
creasing screening frequency, strati-
fied by age and hemoglobin A1c
levels,
is presented in TABLE 5. Given the di-
minishing returns accrued by greater
screening frequency, it is not surpris-
ing to find that annual screening usu-
ally costs more per QALY gained than
lessfrequentscreeningintervals. For ex-
ample, for a 65-year-old patient with an
average hemoglobin A1c
level of 9%, an
annual screening program compared
with an every other year screening pro-
gram would result in spending an ad-
ditional $123 580 for every additional
QALY gained. In this same group, ev-
ery other year vs every third year screen-
ing, costs an additional $62 610 per
QALY gained. For many patients, an-
nual screening costs are substantially
more, with little marginal benefit, when
compared with screening every other
or even every third year. The patients
who benefit the most, and for whom
screening is most cost-effective, are
those who have particularly poor gly-
cemic control.
We examined the accuracy of the
model by comparing the predictions of
the model for clinical end points with
those observed in the UKPDS. The cu-
mulative incidence of retinopathy pro-
gression in the model was similar at all
times to those observed in the UK study
(eg, for patients with a hemoglobin A1c
level of 7%, the 12-year incidence was
38.6% in the UKPDS and 37.5% in our
model). Examination of stages be-
yond initial retinopathy suggest that the
model is highly predictive of the UKPDS
results as well. For example, our model
predicts that UKPDS patients with an
average hemoglobin A1c
level of 7% will
have a 10-year risk of photocoagula-
tion of 7.6% (also 7.6% in the UKPDS),
and those with an average hemoglo-
bin A1c
level of 8% will have a 10-year
risk of photocoagulation of 10.0% (vs
10.3% in the UKPDS).

of patients with known type 2 diabe-
tes in the United States. Based on the
survey weights from NHANES III, we
estimate that approximately 5.3 mil-
lion people have been diagnosed as
having type 2 diabetes (this sample
was limited to subjects for whom both
age and hemoglobin A1c
values were
reported). As shown in TABLE 6, the
model predicts that the current popu-
lation of patients with type 2 diabetes
will accumulate 50 081 384 QALYs
without any retinopathy screening.
Screening at 5-year intervals increases
this to 50 216 915 QALYs at a cost of
approximately $2.3 billion, for a cost-
effectiveness of about $16 790 per
QALY gained. However, the marginal
cost-effectiveness of increasing
screening frequency from every other
year to every year costs more than
$107 000 per QALY gained.
Sensitivity Analyses
We conducted extensive sensitivity
analyses to examine the factors that had
the greatest impact on our estimates of
cost-effectiveness. While there are few
data suggesting that blindness has a di-
rect consequence on medical care costs,
blindness has potential costs such as
government provision of disability com-
pensation and Medicare.48 One prior
analysis estimated values of the social
cost of blindness ranging from $32 per
year for those who become blind at age
65 years or older to $14 296 per year
for those who become blind prior to age
65 years,45 while another estimated
$5100 per year of blindness.9 These
numbers have a fairly substantial ef-
fect on the overall cost-effectiveness of
the intervention; in fact, for high-risk
populations (those with young onset or
poor glycemic control), annual screen-
ing appears to save money compared
with no screening. However, inclu-
sion of these costs has minimal im-
pact on the marginal cost-effective-
ness of increasing screening frequency,
with changes of less than $5000 per ad-
ditional QALY gained (compared with
the baseline case results) being typi-
cal. The effect of adding societal costs
is small because increasing screening
intervals have only a small impact on
time spent blind for most patients with
type 2 diabetes.
Thesinglemostimportantvariablein
determining overall costs is the cost of
the screening examination. When the
costisdecreasedto$28,approximately
halfofcurrentMedicarereimbursement
for an eye examination, the marginal
cost-effectiveness of annual screening
vseveryotheryearscreeningimproves,
butstillremainsmorethan$50 000per
QALY for many subgroups. When the
resultsareappliedtotheUSpopulation,
a 50% reduction of the cost of a dilated
eyeexaminationleadstoamarginalcost-
effectiveness of $86 500 per QALY for
annual vs every other year screening.
Thus,evenifthecostofanexamination

The variable that had the largest im-
pact on the effectiveness of screening
was the utility placed on a year of blind-
ness. In the baseline case, we used a util-
ity of 0.69.43,44 One prior analysis used
much lower utility values for blind-

ness: 0.48 for the majority of blind in-
dividuals, with a subset who had even
lower utility values.8 When a value of
0.48 is used for the utility of blind-
ness, annual screening in the US popu-
lation appears more cost-effective, with
values of approximately $60 000 per
QALY gained compared with every
other year screening. Other variables af-
fected the effectiveness of screening, but
the influence of these variables was
not large across a reasonable range of
values.
Multivariate sensitivity analyses were
conducted by creating distributions of
the estimates based on the ranges out-
lined in Table 1 and running repeated
iterations of the model, randomly sam-
pling from these ranges.46,47 This pro-
duces a distribution of the cost-
effectiveness values. The 95% range of
cost-effectiveness for 3 groups is out-
lined in TABLE 7. The distribution
shows only a 17.3% chance that the
marginal cost-effectiveness of annual vs
every other year screening is greater
than $50 000 per QALY for the high-
risk group. In contrast, none of the
10 000 simulations performed for the
medium- and low-risk groups demon-
strated that annual screening is cost-
effective compared with every other
year screening.
COMMENT
Diabetic eye disease remains a major
cause of blindness in the United
States. Randomized trials have shown
that laser photocoagulation can sig-
nificantly reduce the risk of blindness
in patients with advanced eye compli-
cations.2,3 However, optimal screening
intervals have not been adequately
evaluated, particularly with regard to
variability in eye disease risk in those
at low risk. Despite this, many organi-
zations, including the National Com-
mittee for Quality Assurance, through
HEDIS measures,11 recommend that
annual eye examinations be used not
only as a general guideline, but as a
quality standard in all patients with
diabetes.
Our study suggests that such recom-
mendations may be overzealous. The
baselinecaseanalysisshowsthatinmany
groups of patients, annual screening of-
fers very little marginal benefit over ev-
ery other year screening. For some low-
risk groups (eg, those with good
glycemic control, older age, and no reti-
nopathy on prior examination), every
third year screening may be almost as
good as annual screening and is a more
cost-effective approach. In addition to
health care costs, unnecessary patient
burden must be considered. Patients
with diabetes average 8 to 12 outpa-
tientvisitsannually,49 andvisitsthathave
little expected benefit can compete with
other recommended care, both in terms
of health care resources and patient time
and energy.
Using NHANES III to estimate the
distribution of age and glycemic con-
trol in the United States, we have shown
that if a single screening strategy were
to be recommended for the entire US
population, every other year screen-
ing would seem to be the optimal
choice, if the commonly suggested
guideline of $50 000 per QALY gained
is used as the definition of a cost-
effective intervention.50 However, rec-
ommendations better tailored to indi-
vidual patient circumstances would
seem preferable. A number of poten-
tial screening strategies could be pro-
posed. For example, annual screening
could be recommended for all pa-
tients with hemoglobin A1c
values over
10% (20% of patients with diabetes
in the US population according to
NHANES III), while the remainder of
the population could undergo screen-
ing every 2 to 3 years, with the least fre-
quent screening interval being re-
served for those with excellent glycemic
control. Monitoring and feedback sys-
tems would be needed to ensure that
this less frequent screening interval did
not lead to patients not being screened
at all. The most aggressive approach
supportable by our results would be to
recommend that annual screening is the
safest strategy, but that if patients
achieve good glycemic control and have
normal results of baseline examina-
tion, every second or third year screen-
ing is almost as good at preventing
visual loss. Under this scenario, pro-
fessional recommendations do not
change, but performance and quality
measures, particularly those associ-
ated with incentive and disincentive
payments, must recognize that pa-
tients and physicians might choose less
frequent screening intervals.
We conducted extensive sensitivity
analyses to test the robustness of our
conclusions. In general, the largest un-
certainty is not how little benefit the
low-risk patients receive, but pre-
cisely how large the benefit is to the
higher risk, and thus higher benefit, pa-
tients. Inclusion of a direct cost of blind-
ness into the model had minimal im-
pact on the marginal cost-effectiveness
of annual screening, although it dra-
matically improves the overall cost-
effectiveness of any screening com-

pared with no screening. Sensitivity
analyses also show that the cost of the
screening examination is an impor-
tant component of the overall cost-
effectiveness of a screening program.
However, even when costs are cut in
half, the marginal cost-effectiveness of
annual vs every other year screening is
more than $50 000 per QALY gained.
We should also note that, given recent
data, hypertension control may fur-
ther reduce the efficacy of screening
since aggressive treatment of hyperten-
sion appears to reduce risk of retinopa-
thy substantially.51,52 Therefore, we may
have overestimated the benefits of
screening for those with excellent blood
pressure control.
One weakness of our study is our in-
ability to firmly define the utility of
blindness (visual acuity 20/100) and
lesser levels of visual impairment. Sen-
sitivity analyses demonstrate that the
utility of blindness is an important pre-
dictor of the cost-effectiveness of a
screening program, and estimates of av-
erage utility vary widely.43,45 In addi-
tion, we were unable to adequately as-
sess the impact of states of visual
impairment less than blindness be-
cause of limited information on the risks
and utilities of these states. Because util-
ity is likely to vary dramatically from
patient to patient, a shared decision-
making approach to retinal screening
intervals may be best when formulat-
ing a plan of care for patients with dia-
betes. Whether we recommend an-
nual or every second to third year
screening, patients should know that
the lowest risk will accrue with an-
nual screening; however, as long as gly-
cemic control is good, and screening
occurs every 2 to 3 years, the risk of de-
veloping blindness is still low. An-
other potential weakness is that an an-
nual screening program could allow
other conditions, such as glaucoma and
cataracts, to come to earlier medical at-
tention. However, the impact of screen-
ing for these conditions in a diabetic
population has not been studied.
This study is also limited in its abil-
ity to address potential variations in reti-
nopathy risk in minority populations.
While the risk of retinopathy appears
to be higher in certain ethnic groups,
there continue to be conflicting data on
level of risk,53-55 and some or all of the
increased risk may be due to hyperten-
sion and level of glycemic control.56-58
In particular, it should be noted that
there are conflicting data on the risks
of retinopathy in the Hispanic popula-
tion; recent analyses suggest that el-
evated risk may persist after adjust-
ment for glycemic control and
hypertension.58 It should also be noted
that the risk estimates used in this
analysis were based on the UKPDS
study population, which included mi-
norities, but not Hispanic Americans.
Thus, the aggregate estimates may re-
flect reasonable population, but not pa-
tient-specific, risks, and certain groups,
most notably Hispanics and Native
Americans, may not be adequately rep-
resented in the analysis.
It is clear that we can improve the ef-
ficiency of screening by targeting pa-
tients based on commonly measured
clinical indicators. Ironically, those who
will benefit most from eye screening are
the patients whom providers often find
the most frustrating to treat; namely,
those with poor glycemic control. How-
ever, these are the patients who need
to be the most aggressively screened.
This may run counter to a common im-
pulse to give up on other interven-
tions when patients are noncompliant
or are unsuccessful with treatments to
improve glycemic control. However,
setting a standard of having 80% of a
diabetes population receiving annual
eye examinations will not be produc-
tive if the high-risk patients are the ones
not being regularly screened.
Our study suggests that annual reti-
nal screening for most patients with
type 2 diabetes produces little benefit
that is not achieved with every second
to third year screening. Although our
conclusions would be stronger if there
were empirical data on the efficacy of
varying screening frequencies, the re-
sults of this analysis suggest that the of-
ten-cited policy of annual eye screen-
ing for all patients with type 2 diabetes
should be reevaluated. Furthermore,
groups involved in dissemination of
quality-of-care standards need to re-
consider the marginal benefit of fre-
quent eye examinations when setting
their quality and performance stan-
dards. If not, we run the risk of encour-
aging, or even demanding, ineffi-
ciency and requiring care that would
not be wanted by many well-informed
persons with type 2 diabetes.
