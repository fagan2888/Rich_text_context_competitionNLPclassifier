Positive and negative affect are easily seen as opposite ends
of a single continuum (i.e., as being unidimensional).Aunidi-
mensional model, with well-being at one pole and ill-being at
the other, however, presents qualitative differences between
individuals who are high compared with low in both dimen-
sions (Ito & Cacciopo, 1998). Indeed, there is extensive evi-
dence that positive and negative affect are best thought as two
independent dimensions of the affective system (for a review,
see Garcia, 2011; cf. MacLeod & Moore, 2000). The Broaden-
and-Build Theory (Fredrickson, 1998, 2006), for example,
posits that the function of positive affect is related to approach-
related behavior, which builds an individual's resources for
survival and well-being, while negative affect inhibits behav-
ior that might lead to pain or punishment. Positive affect is a
dimension that varies from pleasant engagement (e.g., enthu-
siastic and active) to unpleasant disengagement (e.g., sad and
bored). The negative affect dimension, on the other hand,
moves from unpleasant engagement (e.g., anger and fear) to
pleasant disengagement (e.g., calm and serene; Watson &
Clark, 1994; Watson, Clark, & Tellegen, 1988). Nevertheless,
there is evidence that rather than being completely indepen-
dent, the two affectivity dimensions might be interrelated in a
two-dimensional circumplex model containing not only
arousal (vertical axis) but also a valence dimension (horizon-
tal axis; Russell, 1980).
In the context of personality, positive and negative affect
dimensions are strongly associated with extraversion and

The Dark Side of the Affective
Profiles: Differences and Similarities
in Psychopathy, Machiavellianism,
and Narcissism

and Patricia Rosenberg3
Abstract
The affective profiles model is based on the combination of individuals' experience of high/low positive affect and high/low
negative affect: self-fulfilling, high affective, low affective, and self-destructive. We used the profiles as the backdrop for the
investigation of individual differences in malevolent character traits (i.e., the Dark Triad: psychopathy, Machiavellianism,
and narcissism). A total of 1,000 participants (age: M = 31.50 SD = 10.27, 667 males and 333 females), recruited through
Amazons' Mechanical Turk (MTurk), responded to the Positive Affect Negative Affect Schedule and the Dark Triad Dirty
Dozen. Individuals with a high affective profile reported higher degree of narcissism than those with any other profile,
and together with individuals with a self-destructive profile, also higher degree of Machiavellianism and psychopathy than
individuals with a low affective and self-fulfilling profile. Males scored higher in Machiavellianism and psychopathy. Together
with earlier findings, our results show that while individuals in both the self-fulfilling and high affective profiles are extrovert
and self-directed, only those in the high affective profile express an immature and malevolent character (i.e., high levels of all
Dark Triad traits). Conversely, individuals in the self-fulfilling profile have earlier reported higher levels of cooperativeness
and faith. More importantly, the unique association between high levels of positive emotions and narcissism and the unified
association between negative emotions to both psychopathy and Machiavellianism imply a dyad rather than a triad of
malevolent character traits.

neuroticism, respectively. For example, individuals who
score high on extraversion attend and react more intensely to
positive stimuli than individuals with low levels of positive
affect (i.e., introverts). In contrast, individuals who score
high on neuroticism attend and react more intensely to nega-
tive stimuli than individuals with low levels of negative
affect (i.e., emotionally stable individuals; Larsen & Ketelaar,
1991). However, sensitivity to negative stimuli is best pre-
dicted by measures of being a neurotic introvert (i.e., being
high in harm avoidance or high in neuroticism and low in
novelty seeking or low in extraversion), whereas sensitivity
to positive stimuli is best predicted by being a stable extra-
vert (i.e., being high in novelty seeking or high in extraver-
sion and low in harm voidance or low in neuroticism; Corr,
Kumari, Wilson, Checkley, & Gray, 1997; Corr et al., 1995).
Hence, positive and negative affect represent general biobe-
havioral systems: positive affect is related to the Behavioral
Activation System (BAS) or sensitivity to reward as well as
approach motivation, while negative affect is related to the
Behavioral Inhibition System (BIS) or sensitivity to signals
of punishment as well as avoidance motivation (Gray, 1981;
Watson, 2002; Watson, Wiese, Vaidya, & Tellegen, 1999).
Following this line of thinking, Archer and colleagues
have developed four affective profiles: self-fulfilling (high
positive affect, low negative affect), high affective (high posi-
tive affect, high negative affect), low affective (low positive
affect, low negative affect), and self-destructive (low positive
affect, high negative affect; see for example, Adrianson,
Ancok, Ramdhani, & Archer, 2013; Archer, Adolfsson, &
Karlsson, 2008; Archer, Adrianson, Plancak, & Karlsson,
2007; Bood, Archer, & Norlander, 2004; Norlander, Bood, &
Archer, 2002; Norlander, Johansson, & Bood, 2005; Palomo,
Beninger, Kostrzewa, & Archer, 2008; Palomo, Kostrzewa,
Beninger, & Archer, 2007). A person with a self-fulfilling
profile shows high self-acceptance, high autonomy, purpose
in life, high energy, and internal locus of control (i.e., agency),
positive relations with others, and helpful behavior (i.e., com-
munion), and also seek support in faith (i.e., spirituality),
while a person with a self-destructive profile experiences low
levels in all these variables (e.g., Archer & Garcia, 2014,
2015; Garcia, Nima, & Kjell, 2014; Rapp Ricciardi et al.,
2014; Schütz, Sailer, et al., 2013). These variables are all pre-
dictors of well-being or what Cloninger (2004, 2006, 2013)
defines as feeling good (i.e., happiness), doing good (i.e.,
mature and actively virtuous living), physical health (i.e.,
absence of disease or infirmity), and prosperity (i.e., success,
good fortune, and flourishing). As the affective profile model
is person-centered (Garcia, 2015; Garcia, MacDonald, &
Archer, 2015), it is possible to discern differences between
profiles at the extreme ends of the model (i.e., self-destructive
vs. self-fulfilling, low affective vs. high affective), but also
within individuals that differ in one affectivity dimension and
are similar in the other (i.e., self-destructive vs. high affective,
self-destructive vs. low affective, low affective vs. self-fulfill-
ing, and high affective vs. self-fulfilling). In other words, the
affective profile model provides the advantage of studying
multidimensional profiles of specific combinations of traits,
because it allows the understanding of the experience in an
individual who is "adapting within his or her biopsychosocial
context" (Cloninger & Zohar, 2011, p. 25; see also Cloninger
& Garcia, 2015; Garcia & Rosenberg, 2015).
More recently, researchers (e.g., Garcia, 2012; Garcia,
Kerekes,Andersson-Arntén, &Archer, 2012; Garcia, Schütz,
& Archer, 2015; Jimmefors et al., 2014) have focused on dif-
ferences between profiles with regard to personality mea-
sures using models such as the Big Five model (Costa &
McCrae, 1992) and Cloninger's psychobiological model
(Temperament and Character Inventory; Cloninger, Svrakic,
& Przybeck, 1993). As hypothesized by these researchers,
individuals with a self-fulfilling profile scored high in self-
directedness, high in cooperativeness, high in persistence,
high in extraversion, high in self-regulatory strategies
defined as locomotion or a "just-do-it" mentality, and happi-
ness-increasing strategies related to agency (e.g., frequently
exercising, active leisure, goal-pursuit), communion (e.g.,
helping others, receiving help from others), and spirituality
(e.g., seek support in faith). In contrast, individuals with a
self-destructive profile scored high in reward dependence,
high in neuroticism, high in self-regulatory strategies defined
as assessment or inaction, and happiness-increasing strate-
gies focused on suppression and rumination (e.g., suppres-
sion of negative thoughts, rumination of negative
experiences). Moreover, individuals with a high affective
profile were higher in reward dependence, higher in self-
transcendence, higher in self-directedness, high in persis-
tence, high in extraversion, and high in both locomotion and
assessment. In contrast, individuals with a low affective pro-
file were high in self-directedness, high in harm avoidance,
and high in the self-regulatory strategy of assessment.
Taken together, these results suggest that individuals with
a high positive affect profile (i.e., self-fulfilling and high
affective) share certain personality features, but that individ-
uals with a high affective profile also share features with
individuals with a self-destructive profile. For example, indi-
viduals with a high affective profile are goal-directed, hard
working, and agentic (i.e., high in self-directedness, high in
persistence) as individuals with a self-fulfilling profile, but
as individuals with a self-destructive profile they are also
low in autonomy (i.e., one aspect of agency), pessimistic and
tend to worry (i.e., high in neuroticism), are highly depen-
dent on external appraisal (i.e., high in reward dependence),
and ruminate about their ability to achieve goals (i.e., high in
assessment). Other important differences between the indi-
viduals with a self-fulfilling and those with a high affective
profile are, for example, that individuals with a high affec-
tive profile do not score high in helpful behavior, tolerance
toward others, and empathy (i.e., communion and coopera-
tive traits). Individuals with a self-fulfilling profile are, for
instance, the only ones who report that they seek support in
faith as one strategy in their own pursue of the happy life
Garcia et al. 3
(Garcia, Schütz, & Archer, 2015; Schütz, Sailer, et al., 2013).
However, individuals with a high affective profile score
higher than individuals with low negative affect profiles (i.e.,
low affective and self-destructive) in self-transcendence (i.e.,
a spiritual trait partially defined as the ability to sense a unity
with something bigger than the self; Cloninger, 2004; Garcia,
2012).
To expand the personality constructs that define each of
the affective profiles, the present study aims to investigate
differences between profiles in Dark Triad traits (i.e., psy-
chopathy, Machiavellianism, and narcissism). The Dark
Triad traits are, for instance, suggested to expand the Big
Five personality model (Veselka, Scherme, & Vernon, 2012),
that is, one of the personality models in which we have dis-
cerned differences between affective profiles. Thus, differ-
ences among profiles in their level of Dark Triad traits will
also expand the current understanding of the affective pro-
files model. In addition, the affective profiles differ in per-
sonality traits using Cloninger's psychobiological model,
which is related to the Big Five model but yet a distinctive
model of personality that measures character traits (Garcia,
Anckarsäter, et al., 2015). To the best of our knowledge,
Cloninger's psychobiological model has not been used in
conjunction with the Dark Triad. Hence, using the affective
profiles model to map the Dark Triad traits in conjunction
with earlier discerned personality differences among affec-
tive profiles in two different personality models might con-
tribute to the debate of the Dark Triad as three distinctive
traits (i.e., uniqueness argument; for example, Jones &
Paulhus, 2011; Rauthmann & Kolar, 2013; Vernon, Villani,
Vickers, & Harris, 2008) or as one global trait (i.e., unifica-
tion argument; for example, Jonason, Li, & Teicher, 2010;
Jonason, Li, Webster, & Schmitt, 2009; Jonason & Webster,
2010; Jones & Figueredo, 2013). Before discussing our
expectations and the implications of these relationships in
the context of Cloninger's biopsychosocial model of person-
ality, we briefly present the Dark Triad and how individuals'
Big Five personality traits are related to their malevolent
traits.
The Dark Triad: Psychopathy,
Machiavellianism, and Narcissism
Paulhus and Williams (2002) coined the term Dark Triad
when they identified three clusters of personality traits at a
subclinical level within the normal population: psychopathy,
Machiavellianism, and narcissism. Psychopathy refers to
high impulsivity, thrill-seeking, and low empathy and anxi-
ety (Paulhus & Williams, 2002). The Machiavellian person-
ality includes manipulative behaviors and deception for
self-benefit (Jakobwitz & Egan, 2006). Individuals high in
Machiavellianism are cynical, misanthropic, cold, prag-
matic, and show immoral beliefs, and detached affect
(Rauthmann & Will, 2011). Individuals high in narcissism
show exaggeration of self-worth and importance, superiority
over others, and are manipulative toward others yet they
have a fragile sense of the self (Ames, Rose, & Anderson,
2006). They show vanity to an extreme, are constantly seek-
ing attention, and harbor feelings of entitlement they do not
deserve (Lee & Ashton, 2005). In other words, these traits
are at the conceptual level different from each other (i.e., the
uniqueness argument). Nevertheless, previous research has
showed that the three traits have low to moderate correla-
tions with one another (Jakobwitz & Egan, 2006; Lee &
Ashton, 2005; Paulhus & Williams, 2002). Paulhus and
Williams, for example, reported positive intercorrelations
between narcissism and psychopathy, and between
Machiavellianism and psychopathy. There was also a low
intercorrelation between narcissism and Machiavellianism.
Although these results have been replicated in some studies
(e.g., Jakobwitz & Egan, 2006), they have not been repli-
cated in others (e.g., Vernon et al., 2008). In addition, some
studies report stronger correlations between the dark traits,
while others report weaker correlations (e.g., Jakobwitz &
Egan, 2006; Lee &Ashton, 2005; Paulhus & Williams, 2002;
Vernon et al., 2008). Hence, there is a wide range of mixed
results on how interrelated the dark traits actually are.
In line with the uniqueness argument, however, individu-
als high in narcissism stand apart by their high scores on self-
enhancement (Furnham, Richards, & Paulhus, 2013; Jones &
Paulhus, 2011). Self-enhancement, for instance, has been
associated with extrinsic spiritual behavior (Sedikides &
Gebauer, 2010), that is, spiritual behavior adopted as a means
to an end (Allport & Ross, 1967). Individuals high in psy-
chopathy, on the other hand, are different from individuals
scoring high in the others Dark Triad traits because they also
score high on impulsivity (Jones & Paulhus, 2011).
Nevertheless, individuals high in levels of each of the Dark
Triad traits share also high levels of agency and low levels of
communion (Jones & Paulhus, 2011; Paulhus & Abild,
2011), which supports the unification argument.
Indeed, research on the Dark Triad shows these traits cor-
relate with aggression, bullying, and racism, that is, antago-
nistic behaviors in interpersonal situations (i.e., low
communion). High levels of psychopathy, for example, are
positively related to direct (i.e., physical or verbal) and indi-
rect aggression (i.e., gossiping, spreading rumors; Douglas,
Bore, & Munro, 2012; Muris, Meester, & Timmermans,
2013), high levels of Machiavellianism are positively associ-
ated with both forms of aggression but more strongly to indi-
rect aggression, and narcissism is positively linked to direct
forms of aggression (Kerig & Stellwagen, 2010; Lau &
Marsee, 2013). With regard to bullying, psychopathy is the
one dark trait most strongly related to bullying, followed by
Machiavellianism and narcissism (Baughman, Dearing,
Giammarco, & Vernon, 2012). It is important to point out that
bully/victims score significantly higher than non-bully/non-
victims on psychopathy, Machiavellianism, and narcissism
(Linton & Power, 2013). The Dark triad is positively corre-
lated with out-group threat perceptions, anti-immigrant
4 SAGE Open
prejudice (Hodson, Hogg, & McInnes, 2009), and different
formsofracism(Jones,2013).HighlevelsofMachiavellianism
predict modern racism (i.e., specific types of inequality rather
than negative responses to minorities in general), whereas
high levels of psychopathy predict old-fashioned racism
(embedded in opposition of any form of racial equality). In
sum, the three dark traits seem to share a non-cooperative
core, but with different nuances of non-cooperative behavior.
This suggests a one global trait structure (i.e., unification
argument) rather than a ternary structure (i.e., uniqueness
argument). In this context, researchers have turned to one of
the most common and reliable model of personality, the Big
Five, to discern differences and similarities between individu-
als who express these malevolent traits.
A Dyad of Personality Models: The
Dark Triad and the Big Five Model
As it could be expected, individuals who score high in any of
the three Dark Triad traits score low in agreeableness as well.
Individuals who score high in psychopathy and narcissism
score also high on extraversion and openness. Those high in
Machiavellianism and psychopathy score low in conscien-
tiousness, while individuals high in psychopathy also score
low in neuroticism (Paulhus & Williams, 2002). As with the
relationships within the triad, relationships between the triad
and the Big Five traits have been replicated in some studies
(Lee & Ashton, 2005) but not in others (Jakobwitz & Egan,
2006). Yet other studies report correlations between each of
the Dark Triad traits and several of the Big Five traits, for
example, high psychopathy with low agreeableness and low
conscientiousness, and high narcissism with high extraver-
sion, high openness, and low agreeableness (Vernon et al.,
2008). Thus, even if there are some correlations between the
Dark Triad and the Big Five, these are neither large nor consis-
tent and this indicates that the two models represent overlap-
ping but distinct clusters of personality (Vernon et al., 2008).
The most consistent finding is that individuals who
express high levels in any of the Dark Triad traits also score
low in agreeableness (Jakobwitz & Egan, 2006; Jonason &
Webster, 2010; Lee & Ashton, 2005; Paulhus & Williams,
2002). Importantly, agreeableness is positively related to the
character trait of cooperativeness in Cloninger's model (De
Fruyt, Van De Wiele, & Van Heeringen, 2000, 2006, Garcia,
2012; Garcia, Anckarsäter, et al., 2015). For instance, while
the Dark Triad as one global construct (i.e., the sum of all
three traits) is related to low levels of agreeableness, high
levels of extraversion, high levels of openness, low levels of
neuroticism, and low levels of conscientiousness, the only
common correlate for each unique dark trait is low levels of
agreeableness (Jonason et al., 2010). This does, as discussed
earlier, suggest a common uncooperative core for the three
dark traits (i.e., unification argument).
Individuals who are agreeable are described as interested in
socialharmony,whereasthosewhoaredisagreeablearedescribed
as antisocial, autocratic, selfish, stubborn, demanding, head-
strong,impatient,intolerant,outspoken,hard-hearted,argumenta-
tive, and aggressive (cf. low cooperativeness; Cloninger, 2004).
Hence, it is clear why individuals with high levels in any of the
dark traits always score lowest in agreeableness and are less likely
to help other people (Furnham et al., 2013; Jonason, Li, & Buss,
2010; Lannin, Guyll, Krizan, Madon, & Cornish, 2014; Veselka
etal.,2012;White,2014).Agreeablenessis,indeed,consideredas
the core trait contributing to prosocial behavior (Aghababaei,
Wasserman, & Nannini, 2014; Carlo, Okun, Knight, & de
Guzman, 2005; Lee & Ashton, 2005). However, although a per-
son high in the Dark Triad traits is predominantly disagreeable,
she or he is also low in conscientiousness, stable, and extravert
(Furnham, Richard, Rangel, & Jones, 2014).
The Present Study
The aim of this study was to investigate differences between
affective profiles in the Dark Triad traits. To the best of our
knowledge, no other studies have investigated these differ-
ences. We expect this to expand the research on differences in
personality between affective profiles because the Dark Triad
traits are suggested to expand the Big Five personality model
(Veselka et al., 2012), which is one of the personality models
already studied using the affective profiles model. Research
on the Dark Triad has a fairly detailed picture of which of the
Big Five personality traits help to discern diferences (i.e.,
uniqueness argument) and commonalities (i.e., unification
argument) among the Dark Triad traits. This is, however, not
the case for Cloninger's model of personality, which has
already been used to discern differences in personality
between affective profiles. Hence, using the affective profiles
model as the framework for differences in malevolent tenden-
cies, in conjunction with earlier discerned personality differ-
ences among profiles, might contribute to the debate of the
Dark Triad as one global trait (i.e., unification argument) or
three distinctive traits (i.e., uniqueness argument).
In the context of affectivity, psychopathy seems to be
associated with high levels of negative affect (Love &
Holder, 2014), which is a marker for neuroticism and harm
avoidance. In contrast, psychopathy is associated with low
levels of positive affect (Love & Holder, 2014), which is a
marker for low levels of extraversion and self-directedness.
Thus, suggesting that individuals with a self-destructive
profile (low positive affect/high negative affect) can be
expected to be high in psychopathy. In this line, individuals
with a self-fulfilling profile (high positive affect, low nega-
tive affect) have been depicted as more cooperative and tol-
erant to others, more stable, and conscious, whereas
individuals with a high negative affect profile (i.e., high
affective and self-destructive) are depicted as less agree-
able (Garcia, 2012; Garcia et al., 2014). These earlier find-
ings suggest that individuals with a high affective or a
self-destructive profile should score higher in the Dark
Triad traits. Nevertheless, one obvious difference between
Garcia et al. 5
individuals with a high affective and those with a self-
destructive profile is that individuals with a high affective
profile experience high positive affect, which is positively
related to extraversion (see, for example, Garcia's [2012]
study, in which individuals with a high affective profile
score higher in extraversion compared with individuals
with a self-destructive profile). Extraversion is, for instance,
positively related to narcissism (e.g., Paulhus & Williams,
2002; Vernon et al., 2008). Therefore, we expected indi-
viduals with a high affective and a self-destructive profile
to be higher in both psychopathy and Machiavellianism
compared with individuals with a self-fulfilling or a low
affective profile, but this two high negative affect profiles
(i.e., self-destructive and high affective) were expected
to differ in narcissism--the individuals with a high affec-
tive profile being the ones expected to score higher in
narcissism.
Method
Ethics Statement
The review board of the Network for Empowerment and
Well-Being approved the research protocol, which was found
to comply with the law concerning research involving humans
and requiring only informed consent from the participants.
Participants, workers from the crowdsourcing platform
Amazon's Mechanical Turk (MTurk), provided their consent
by simply accepting the task (or HIT as it is called in MTurk)
and then answering the survey. This acceptance is recorded
electronically together with the participants' answers.
Participants and Procedure
The participants (N = 1,000, age M = 31.50 SD. = 10.27; 667
males and 333 females) were recruited through MTurk
(https://www.mturk.com/mturk/welcome). MTurk allows
data collectors to recruit participants (workers) online for
completing different tasks in exchange for wages. This
method for data collection online has become more common
during recent years and it is an empirical tested valid tool for
conducting research in the social sciences (see Buhrmester,
Kwang, & Gosling, 2011). Participants were recruited by the
following criteria: being U.S. resident and being able to
speak and read fluent in English. Participants were paid a
wage of .20 cents of American dollars for completing the
task and informed that the study was anonymous and volun-
tary. The participants were presented with a battery of self-
reports comprising the affect and Dark Triad measures, as
well as demographic questions (e.g., age, sex). We included
two validity check items to control for random responding
("In this question, please answer either agree or disagree"). A
total of 52 individuals out of 1,052 (i.e., 5.20%) were dropped
from the final analysis because they answered erroneously to
one or both validity check items.
Instruments
Positive Affect and Negative Affect Schedule.The instrument
(Watson et al., 1988) instructs participants to rate to what
extent they generally have experienced 20 different feelings
or emotions (10 positive affect and 10 negative affect) during
the last weeks, using a 5-point Likert-type scale (1 = very
slightly, 5 = extremely). The 10-item positive affect scale
includes adjectives such as strong, proud, and interested. The
10-item negative affect scale includes adjectives such as
afraid, ashamed, and nervous. We averaged together the
responses to each item to create an index of each scale.
The DarkTriad Dirty Dozen. The instrument (Jonason & Web-
ster, 2010) is composed of 12 items (Likert-type scale: 1 =
not at all; 7 = very much), four for each Dark Triad trait:
psychopathy (e.g., "I tend to lack remorse"), Machiavellian-
ism (e.g., "I have used deceit or lied to get my way"), and
narcissism (e.g., "I tend to want others to admire me"). We
averaged together the responses to each item to create an
index of each trait.
Statistical Treatment
Participants'positive and negative affect scores were divided
into high and low using the median as reference and then
combined to create the four affective profiles (cutoff points
in the present study: high positive affect = 3.20 or above; low
positive affect = 3.10 or less, or above; high negative
affect = 1.90 or above; low negative affect = 1.80 or less).
This resulted in 281 individuals with a self-fulfilling profile,
216 with a low affective profile, 198 with a high affective
profile, and 305 individuals with a self-destructive profile.
The distribution of the participants over the profiles showed
that the number of individuals in the low affective and high
affective profiles were about the same. Similarly, about the
same number of participants was allocated to the self-
destructive and self-fulfilling profiles (see Table 1). A
Shapiro­Wilkes test for normality showed that the affective
profiles scores on the Dark Triad, except for high affective
individual's scores on Machiavellianism, deviated from the
normal distribution. Nevertheless, the Central Limit Theorem
suggests that, with sufficiently large sample sizes, it is plau-
sible to assume that sampling distributions of means are nor-
mally distributed regardless of the distributions of the
variables (Tabachnick & Fidell, 2007). Moreover, there were
no significant results on Levene's test for homogeneity of
variance with the profiles as the independent variable.
To check for the validity of the profiling of the partici-
pants, we contacted an independent researcher who has
worked with k-means analyses as the method for the person-
oriented approach on individual differences. Our data were
submitted to this analysis. Specifically, Ward's hierarchical
cluster analysis was used to divide the sample into four
groups, and k-means cluster analysis used the starting points
6 SAGE Open
from this analysis to investigate whether individuals actually
ended up in a group most similar to their affective profile.
The weighed mean of clusters homogeneity coefficient was
.73. Suggesting a good model fit and that the participants in
the present study were categorized in four profiles using their
combination of self-reported affect (S. MacDonald, personal
communication on January the 2nd, 2015). Part of the data in
the present study was used in a study in which we address
methodological questions regarding the median split and
cluster approaches (see Garcia, MacDonald, & Archer,
2015).

ate correlations for Machiavellianism and psychopathy (r =
.49, df = 998, p < .001) and Machiavellianism and narcissism
(r = .43, df = 998, p < .001) but a less strong relation between
psychopathy and narcissism (r = .21, df = 998, p < .001).
Negative affect was positively and significantly related to
psychopathy (r = .15, df = 998, p < .001), Machiavellianism
(r = .20, df = 998, p < .001), and narcissism (r = .20, df = 998,
p < .001). Positive affect was positively and significantly
related to narcissism (r = .12, df = 998, p < .01) and negatively
correlated to psychopathy (r = -.10, df = 998, p < .01). All
relations between affect and the Dark Triad traits were, how-
ever, weak (see Ferguson, 2009, who recommends r = .20 as
minimum effect size representing a practically significant
effect for social science data). Table 2 shows the correlations,
means and standard deviations (SD), and Cronbach's  for all
variables in the present study.
A multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) was cal-
culated with affective profiles and sex as the independent
variables and the Dark Triad traits as the dependent variables.
Table 3 shows the means and standard deviations (±) for the
different profiles and across sex. There was a significant main
effect of the affective profiles on the Dark Triad traits,
F(9, 2409.55) = 6.45, p = .001, Wilks's  = .94, 2 = .02. The
profiles differed in psychopathy, F(3, 992) = 5.78, p = .001,
2 = .02. A post hoc test using Bonferroni correction to the
alpha level showed that individuals with a self-destructive
(M = 2.86, SD = 1.25) and a high affective (M = 2.90, SD =
1.37) profile scored higher on psychopathy compared with
individuals with a self-fulfilling profile (M = 2.49, SD = 1.20).
The affective profiles differed in Machiavellianism as well,
F(3, 992) = 10.18, p = .001, 2 = .03. A post hoc test using
Bonferroni correction to the alpha level showed that individu-
als with a high affective profile (M = 3.68, SD = 1.35) and
individuals with a self-destructive profile (M = 3.54, SD =
1.30) scored higher on Machiavellianism compared with indi-
viduals with a low affective profile (M = 3.14, SD = 0.97) and
individuals with a self-fulfilling profile (M = 3.15, SD = 1.34).
Furthermore, the profiles also differed in narcissism,
F(3, 992) = 12.26, p = .001, 2 = .04. A post hoc test using
Bonferroni correction to the alpha level showed that individu-
als with a high affective profile (M = 4.25, SD = 1.27) scored
higher on narcissism compared with individuals with a self-
destructive profile (M = 3.88, SD = 1.26) and individuals with
a self-fulfilling profile (M = 3.77, SD = 1.38). Individuals
with a low affective profile scored lower on narcissism (M =
3.43, SD = 1.29) compared with all profiles but the self-ful-
filling. For a summary of the differences, see also Figure 1.
There was a main effect of sex on Dark Triad traits,
F(3, 990) = 14.11, p = .001, Wilks's  = .96, 2 = .04. Males
(M = 2.91, SD = 1.31) scored higher in psychopathy,
F(1, 992) = 41.12, p = .001, 2 = .04, compared with women
(M = 2.39, SD = 1.15). Males (M = 3.44, SD = 1.36) scored
also slightly higher in Machiavellianism, F(1, 992) = 6.19,
p = .013 2 = .006, compared with females (M = 3.24, SD =
1.32). There were no significant mean differences between
the sexes with regard to narcissism (men: M = 3.88, SD =
1.33; women: M = 3.71, SD = 1.32). There were no signifi-
cant interaction effects between affective profiles and sex.
Discussion
The research on affective profiles has a 10-year long history,
while the number of studies on the Dark Triad has increased
fast during the last years. To expand earlier findings that show
differences in personality traits between individuals with dif-
ferent affective profiles, were we interested in differences
between profiles in the Dark Triad traits. The Dark Triad traits
show, for instance, significant phenotypic, genetic, and envi-
ronmental correlations to measures of personality traits that
are distinct to those measured in the Big Five model (Veselka
et al., 2012), thus, making these dark traits non-explored ter-
ritory in the context of the affective profiles model. Moreover,
if individuals with different affective profiles varied in their
Dark Triad traits, this was expected to shed some light into the
debate of unification versus uniqueness of these malevolent
traits. After all, individuals with different affective profiles
have shown variance in personality traits commonly (i.e., the
Big Five model) and non-earlier (i.e., Cloninger's psychobio-
logical model) used to investigate associations to the dark
trait. The most important findings were that (a) individuals
with a high affective profile reported higher degree of narcis-
sism than individuals with any of the other profiles, and they
also reported higher levels of Machiavellianism and psychop-
athy than individuals with a low affective or a self-fulfilling

profile and that (b) individuals with a self-destructive profile
also were higher on Machiavellianism and psychopathy com-
pared with individuals with a low affective or a self-fulfilling
profile. For a summary of the differences in the present study,
see Figure 1.
Earlier findings show that individuals with a self-fulfilling
or a high affective profile share high levels of agentic traits,
such as self-directedness (i.e., goal-directedness, self-accep-
tance, etcetera) and persistence (i.e., a personality trait
describing an individual who is perfectionist and hard work-
ing; see among others Garcia, 2012; Garcia et al., 2012). The
present results, however, show that despite the fact that indi-
viduals with any of these two profiles might be defined as
high in agentic traits, individuals with a self-fulfilling profile
scored lower in the Dark Triad traits, while individuals with a
high affective profile scored high in these malevolent traits.
That is, high levels in the malevolent triad are associated with
positive affect when negative affect is high (see Figure 1). In
this context, earlier results show that, compared with the other
profiles, including the high affective, the self-fulfilling scores
the highest in communal traits (i.e., cooperativeness); traits
that comprise tolerance toward others and empathic and help-
ful behavior (Garcia, 2012; see Figure 2). Accordingly, indi-
viduals who score high in levels of each of the Dark Triad
traits share also high levels of agency and low levels of com-
munion (Jones & Paulhus, 2011; Paulhus & Abild, 2011).
Nevertheless, others have suggested that it is not correct
to dismiss the Dark Triad as simply low in communal traits
(e.g., agreeableness, cooperativeness)--a person high in the
Dark Triad traits is predominantly disagreeable, but also an
extravert (Furnham et al., 2014). Indeed, individuals with a
high affective profile, compared with those with a low posi-
tive affect profile (i.e., low affective and self-destructive),
are high in extraversion (Garcia, 2012; see Figure 2).
Nevertheless, individuals with a high affective profile have
been found to be high in neuroticism, as those with a self-
destructive profile, but low in harm avoidance, as those indi-
viduals with a self-fulfilling profile. In other words, all these
three profiles (i.e., high affective, low affective, and self-
destructive; see Figure 2) are rather emotionally unstable
compared with the self-fulfilling profile (Garcia, 2012).
However, individuals with a high affective profile show, at
the same time, a tendency to be fearless, carefree, coura-
geous, energetic, outgoing, and optimistic even in situations
that worry most people (i.e., low harm avoidance).
Psychopathy is, indeed, negatively associated with harm
avoidance (Fowles & Dindo, 2006). In other words, individ-
uals with a high affective profile seem to be high in agentic
traits (i.e., self-directedness, persistence, extraversion), low
in communal traits (i.e., cooperativeness, agreeableness),
high in the dark traits (i.e., psychopathy, Machiavellianism,
narcissism), and low in harm avoidance, but high in neuroti-
cism. In contrast, individuals with a self-destructive profile
are low in agentic traits, low in communal traits, and high in
dark traits, but high in both harm avoidance and neuroticism
(see Figure 2).
Nevertheless, our finding linking psychopathy to the self-
destructive profile, a profile in turn linked to high neurotic

and high in harm avoidant behavior, is at first sight counter-
intuitive. Psychopathy has after all been found to correlate
negatively to neuroticism (e.g., Paulhus & Williams, 2002)
and negative affect (Love & Holder, 2014), which is almost
synonymous with neuroticism (e.g., Tellegen, 1993; Watson
et al., 1988). Nevertheless, some studies have not replicated
the link high psychopathy-low neuroticism (Veselka et al.,
2012). The findings presented here, however, suggest that
both high and low neuroticism (emotional stability being the
opposite end of neuroticism) might be found in individuals
high in psychopathy, hence suggesting the probability of
both a emotionally stable (tentatively high in affectivity:
high affective) and a emotionally instable psychopath (tenta-
tively low in positive affect and high in negative affect: self-
destructive). Importantly, psychopathy was only higher when
profiles at one extreme end of the model where compared
(i.e., self-destructive vs. self-fulfilling, see Figure 1) or
within profiles high in positive affect that vary in negative
affect (high affective vs. self-fulfilling, see Figure 1). Hence,
psychopathy does not seem to be higher within profiles low
in positive affect that vary in their negative affect levels
(self-destructive vs. low affective, see Figure 1), within pro-
files with high negative affect that vary in their positive
affect levels (self-destructive vs. high affective, Figure 1), or
within profiles with low negative affect that vary in their
positive affect levels (low affective vs. self-fulfilling, Figure
1). Furthermore, Machiavellianism differed between profiles
at both extreme ends of the model (high affective vs. low
affective and self-destructive vs. self-fulfilling, Figure 1),
but also within profiles low in positive affect that vary in
their levels of negative affect (self-destructive vs. low affec-
tive, see Figure 1) and within profiles high in positive affect
that vary in their levels of negative affect (high affective vs.
self-fulfilling, see Figure 1).
Moreover, individuals with a high affective profile scored
higher in narcissism compared with all profiles, even com-
pared with individuals with a self-destructive profile. This
was expected because individuals with a high affective pro-
file score higher in extraversion compared with individuals
with a self-destructive profile--extraversion is after all posi-
tively related to narcissism (e.g., Paulhus & Williams, 2002;
Vernon et al., 2008). The matched comparisons, however,

(low-high positive affect, high-low negative affect) and low affective versus high affective (low-high positive affect, low-high negative
affect). Differences found when individuals were matched in one affective dimension, and differed in the other (i.e., within differences):
self-destructive versus high affective (matching: high-high negative affect, differing: low-high positive affect), self-destructive versus low
affective (matching: low-low positive affect, differing: high-low negative affect), high affective versus self-fulfilling (matching: high-high
positive affect, differing: high-low negative affect), and low affective versus self-fulfilling (matching: low-low negative affect, differing: low-
high positive affect).

suggest a complex picture for narcissism. This dark trait dif-
fered between individuals at one extreme end of the affective
profile model (low affective vs. high affective), but also
within profiles that were high in negative affect and varied in
their levels of positive affect (self-destructive vs. high affec-
tive, see Figure 1), within profiles that were low in positive
affect and varied in their levels of negative affect (self-
destructive vs. low affective, see Figure 1), and within pro-
files that were high in positive affect and varied in their
levels of negative affect (high affective vs. self-fulfilling, see
Figure 1). Moreover, in relation to earlier research, individu-
als high in narcissism stand apart by being high in self-
enhancement (Furnham et al., 2013; Jones & Paulhus, 2011),
which is in turn associated with extrinsic spiritual behavior
(Sedikides & Gebauer, 2010). Extrinsic spiritual behavior is
adopted as a means to an end (Allport & Ross, 1967). In this
context, individuals with a high affective profile score high
in spiritual traits (i.e., self-transcendence) compared with
individuals with a low affective and self-destructive profile
(Garcia, 2012; see Figure 2). Nevertheless, only individuals
with a self-fulfilling profile report seeking support in faith
(Schütz, Sailer, et al., 2013). We argue that this suggests that
individuals with a high affective profile have a more means
to an end approach to their spirituality/self-transcendence.
The high affective profile is for instance depicted using
Cloninger's model of personality, as high in self-directed-
ness, low in cooperativeness, and high in self-transcendence
(Garcia, 2012; Garcia et al., 2012). Cloninger labels this spe-
cific character combination as "fanatical" (e.g., Cloninger &
Zohar, 2011). Individuals with this character combination
are prone to depression but also paranoid (Cloninger, 2004;
Josefsson, Merjonen, Jokela, Pulkki-Råback, & Keltikangas-
Järvinen, 2011). That is, our findings suggest that narcissism
should be associated with these types of disorders.
Nevertheless, this is a question for future research that should
include measures of character and the Dark Triad traits along
the affective profile model.
Finally, we found that men scored higher in psychopathy
and slightly higher in Machiavellianism compared with
women. This is accordingly to earlier research showing that
men score higher than women in all three Dark Triad traits
(Jonason et al., 2010; Jonason et al., 2009; Jonason &
Figure 2. Summary of the personality trait differences between affective profiles in the present and other studies (e.g., Garcia, 2012;
Garcia, Kerekes, Andersson-Arntén, & Archer, 2012).

Webster, 2010). However, narcissism did not differed
between men and women in the present study and the differ-
ences in Machiavellianism were rather small. This is, none-
theless, also in line with other studies (Jones & Paulhus,
2014; Paulhus & Williams, 2002). Our results also replicated
those findings suggesting positive correlations between
Machiavellianism and psychopathy (Paulhus & Williams,
2002) and correlations between Machiavellianism and nar-
cissism (Jakobwitz & Egan, 2006). This last finding is, how-
ever, contradictory to that from other studies (e.g., Paulhus &
Williams, 2002).
Limitations and Strengths of the Present Study
It is plausible to point out some potential issues with the
choice of using MTurk to gather the data: for example, work-
ers' attention levels, cross-talk between participants, and the
fact that participants get remuneration for their answers
(Buhrmester et al., 2011). Nevertheless, a large quantity of
studies show that data on personality scales collected through
MTurk meet academic standards and it is demographically
diverse (Buhrmester et al., 2011; Horton, Rand, &
Zeckhauser, 2011; Paolacci, Chandler, & Ipeirotis, 2010).
Moreover, data on health measures collected through MTurk
show satisfactory internal as well as test­retest reliability
(Shapiro, Chandler, & Mueller, 2013). In addition, the
amount of payment does not seem to affect data quality,
remuneration is usually small, and workers report being
intrinsically motivated (e.g., for enjoyment) to take part in
surveys (Buhrmester et al., 2011).
With regard to the Dark Triad measure used here (i.e.,
Dark Triad Dirty Dozen; Jonason & Webster, 2010), it is
important to point out that while some researchers find it as
an appropriate measure of these malevolent traits, others
have criticized its validity (e.g., Lee et al., 2012; Miller &
Lynam, 2012; Paulhus & Jones, 2014). For sake of brevity
Jonason and Webster's (2010) Dirty Dozen only comprises
12 items (four for each trait), while other measures, such as,
Jones and Paulhus'(2014) the Short Dark Triad comprises 27
items (seven for each trait). For instance, the Dark Triad
Dirty Dozen has demonstrated less predictive power (e.g.,
Jones & Paulhus, 2014; Lee et al., 2012) compared with the
measure developed by Jones and Paulhus (2014; the Short
Dark Triad). In addition, although we opted to use a 7-point
Likert-type scale, as in Jonason and Luévano's (2013) study,
some studies have used a 5-point Likert-type scale (e.g.,
Jonason, Li, & Czarna, 2013; Jonason, Slomski, & Partyka,
2012) or a 9-point Likert-type scale (e.g., Jonason & Webster,
2010). Hence, it is difficult to compare samples and our find-
ings need to be replicated using more reliable measures of
the Dark Triad.
Finally, the allocation of the participants to different pro-
files using median splits has some methodological problems
(Garcia, MacDonald, & Archer, 2015). For instance, median
splits distort the meaning of high and low because scores
just-above and just-below the median become high and low
by fiat, not by reality (Garcia, MacDonald, & Archer, 2015;
Schütz, Archer, & Garcia, 2013). To avoid this problem,
some studies have used larger samples as reference to create
the profiles of smaller samples (e.g., Rapp Ricciardi et al.,
2014), others have opted to use the cutoff points found in the
original study (i.e., Norlander et al., 2002), and yet others
have used aged-based cutoff points (e.g., Garcia, 2011).
Nevertheless, using more sophisticated approaches (e.g.,
k-means cluster analysis) to allocate individuals in profiles,
based on self-reported affect, also arrives to a four profiles
solution as theorized by Archer (e.g., Garcia, MacDonald, &
Archer, 2015; MacDonald & Kormi-Nouri, 2013). This was
also the case for the sample used here. To the best of our
knowledge, no study has established which of the methods
(median split vs. cluster analysis) construe the profiles more
statistically accurate or has analyzed whether there are dif-
ferences in the results depending on the approach being used.
Importantly, the categorization is based on the theoretical
framework of the affective system as being composed of
independent dimensions. Hence, the affective profiles model
goes beyond the view of affect as two separate systems and
takes into account the interaction of both dispositions and
also observations of two-system theories suggesting that,
when using dichotomous features, combinations must be
ruled out (for a point of view on two-system theories, see
Garcia, 2011; Keren & Schul, 2009). In other words, while
there are differences between individuals in positive and/or
negative affect, these two components of the affective sys-
tem exist within each individual. On the basis of this inde-
pendent coexistence of self-regulation (i.e., approach
behavior vs. avoidance behavior), it is plausible to assume
that there exist differences within the individual as well--
some experiencing high positive affect but low negative
affect or any combination in-between.
Our findings using the affective profile model suggest
that the description of an individual high in the Dark Triad
traits is complex and that, as suggested by Furnham and col-
leagues (2013), studies comparing the dark traits with other
personality traits might need to investigate differences at the
subscale level. For instance, individuals with a high affective
profile have scored lower than individuals with a self-fulfill-
ing profile in the agentic trait of autonomy (Garcia et al.,
2014). In other words, although both the self-fulfilling and
the high affective are high in agentic traits, such as, self-
directedness they might differ in aspects of self-directedness
describing self-discipline and self-control, which are nega-
tively associated with the Dark Triad traits (Jonason & Tost,
2010).
Conclusion and Final Remarks
In sum, the affective profiles model allows the comparison
between individuals taking into account the different combi-
nations of individuals' affective experience. The strength of
Garcia et al. 11
the model is that comparisons take into consideration that
individuals can be diametrically different (low affective vs.
high affective and self-destructive vs. self-fulfilling) or equal
in one aspect of their affective experience and at the same
time different in the other (i.e., high affective vs. self-fulfill-
ing, low affective vs. self-fulfilling, self-destructive vs. low
affective, and self-destructive vs. high affective; see Figure
1). In light of the results presented here, some suggestions
and predictions are warranted in regard to the unification
versus uniqueness Dark Triad traits'debate. First, we suggest
that narcissism is uniquely different from the other three dark
traits because it is the only dark trait to be associated with
high positive affect when negative affectivity is high (self-
destructive vs. high affective). A direct translation of the
findings to other models of personality could be that, while
narcissism shares low levels of agreeable and cooperative
behavior with the other dark traits, narcissism is positively
related to extrovert behavior (e.g., high positive affect,
socializing) only when the individual is also high in neurotic
behavior (e.g., high negative affect, emotionally unstable).
This is accordingly to the description of a narcissistic person-
ality as involving a grandiose yet fragile sense of the self
(Ames et al., 2006).
At a first look, psychopathy and Machiavellianism seem to
mostly be associated with negative affect, both the high affec-
tive and self-destructed profiles scored high in these malevo-
lent traits. However, Machiavellianism was associated with
high levels of negative affect when positive affect was high
(high affective vs. self-fulfilling, Figure 1) and low (self-
destructive vs. low affective, Figure 1) or when profiles at
both extreme ends of the model were compared. Psychopathy
on the other hand was associated with high negative affect
only in two instances: when profiles at one extreme end of the
model were compared (self-destructive vs. self-fulfilling) and
when positive affect was high (high affective vs. self-fulfill-
ing, Figure 1). In other words, while Machiavellianism is gen-
erally associated with high levels of negative affect,
psychopathy has a unique association with high negative
affect only when positive affect is high at the same time. This
also suggests that psychopathy should be positively related to
extrovert behavior (e.g., high positive affect, socializing) only
when the individual is high in neurotic behavior (e.g., high
negative affect, emotional stable). But psychopathy should
also be positively related to the opposite of extrovert behav-
ior, that is, introvert behavior (e.g., low positive affect, being
reserved and a loner), under the same premises (i.e., high in
neurotic behavior). At the end, however, psychopathy and
Machiavellianism seem to have more similarities than differ-
ences, at least when it comes to affectivity (see Figure 1).
Thus, our study suggests that there are two unique traits in the
triad, narcissism being one of them, because it is uniquely
associated with positive affect when negative affect is high.
The other is probably a global antisocial trait composed of
psychopathy and Machiavellianism that is related to negative
affect in general.
Our results suggest that individuals who score high in
the Dark Triad traits might have lesser of the attributes
linked to the self-fulfilling profile: agency (i.e., self-accep-
tance, autonomy, goal-directedness), communion (i.e.,
cooperation, helpfulness, empathy), and intrinsic spiritual-
ity (i.e., seeking support from faith). These attributes
together form a creative character and are all necessary for
well-being or what Cloninger (2004, 2006, 2013) defines as
feeling good (i.e., happiness), doing good (i.e., mature and
actively virtuous living), physical health (i.e., absence of
disease or infirmity), and prosperity (i.e., success, good for-
tune, and flourishing) (see also Falhgren, Nima, Archer, &
Garcia, 2015). In contrast to individuals with a high affec-
tive profile and who are also high in some agentic and some
spiritual traits, individuals with a self-fulfilling profile are
not self-centered, manipulative, or malevolent. For instance,
self-fulfilling individuals with a creative character, such as,
Mahatma Gandhi and Martin Luther King (Cloninger,
2004), have imposed important changes for humanity
using, for example, civil disobedience (Thoreau, 2009).
This behavior has led their oppressors to see them as vil-
lains. The difference between a hero and a villain might be
that the hero pursue communal values in an agentic and
spiritual manner, while the villain is all about agency and
manipulation of communal and spiritual values (for recent
research on the difference between agentic/communal val-
ues and agentic/communal traits showing important effects
on happiness, see Abele, 2014).
In the end, my kingdom was united not by a hero or a villain, as
legend had predicted, but by one who was both hero and villain.
