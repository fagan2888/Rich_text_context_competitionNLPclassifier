The sexual harassment of women is extremely widespread
and has been found to negatively impact women's workplace
productivity, emotionality, and relations with family (Celik
& Celik, 2007; Pryor, 1995). Present-day statistics from the
Indian subcontinent depict a deeply disturbing picture of
women's lives. A report on crimes against women in India by
the National Crimes Records Bureau shows that 8,233 cases
of dowry deaths, 38,262 cases of kidnapping and abduction,
and 24,923 cases of rape were reported in the year 2012
alone(National Crime Records Bureau Ministry of Home
Affairs,2012). It must be kept in mind that the actual number
of criminal offenses committed against women is far higher
than these statistics reveal. Many crimes, in particular those
that involve sexual violence remain vastly underreported due
to a variety of reasons including shame, stigma, the fear of
retaliation, insensitivity of the police, long and complicated
legal procedures, low conviction rates and an overarching
culture of impunity. Even a cursory assessment of Indian
laws on sexual and other forms of violence against women
shows that these laws were for decades wholly inadequate
both in their framing and implementation. It was only after
the brutal gang rape and eventual death of a young female
medical student in Delhi on December 16, 2012, that nation-
wide protests compelled the government to enact a stricter
antirape law. Similarly, laws to deal with the sexual harass-
ment of women at the workplace were lacking at least till 17
years ago when, in 1997, the Supreme Court of India gave
the basic definition of sexual harassment at the workplace
and provided guidelines to deal with it. These came to be
called the Vishaka Guidelines. Although several attempts
were made to enact a law on this subject, the Sexual
Harassment of Women at Workplace Bill eventually came
into effect as late as 2013. While these changes, though
belated, are significant, it remains to be seen whether the
new laws will be implemented in the manner required to
reduce gender-based violence.
Another form of sexual harassment rampant in this part of
the world but seldom discussed is street harassment, also
known as "eve-teasing." This specifically refers to harass-
ment that is faced mostly by women from men who are
strangers, in public spaces like streets, parks, modes of pub-
lic transport, and bus-stops. "Eve-teasing" was defined in
1984 by the government of New Delhi as
When a man by words either spoken or by signs and/or by
visible representation or by gesture does any act in public space,
or signs, recites or utters any indecent words or song or ballad in
any public place to the annoyance of any women.

Street Harassment: A Qualitative Study
of the Experiences of Young Women in
Delhi
Megha Dhillon1 and Suparna Bakaya1
Abstract
This study attempted to understand street harassment as experienced by young women in Delhi. Interviews were conducted
with 20 women between the ages of 18 and 30 years to understand the nature of harassment they faced, its perceived
consequences, their ways of coping with it, and the changes they felt were needed for them to feel safer. Findings revealed that
harassment occurred most often in crowded spots and in broad daylight. High levels of harassment were attributed to factors
like prevalent attitudes toward women and weak implementation of laws. Participants saw their lives as being restricted in
several ways by the harassment. The police was seen as apathetic, and women took on themselves the responsibility for
staying safe. Sometimes, women chose to defend themselves by moving away from harassers rather than confronting them
due to fear of escalation. However, several participants felt that staying quiet allowed the perpetuation of harassment. The
major change that women sought was more effective police functioning.

Some behaviors considered to be forms of "eve-teasing"
include making passes, obscene gestures, whistling, staring,
pinching, fondling, and rubbing against women. Fairchild
and Rudman (2008) have noted that street harassment shares
many common themes with the sexual harassment that hap-
pens in other contexts, most specifically the component of
unwanted sexual attention. However, street harassment is
unique in that it is perpetrated by strangers (as opposed to
familiar people such as bosses, teachers, or medical profes-
sionals) and that it takes place in public domains. In this
study, we attempted to extend previous work by understand-
ing street harassment as it is perceived and understood by
young women residing in Delhi. Based on the work that has
already happened in this area and the recent spate of sexual
crimes against women across India in public spaces, we
hypothesized that street harassment would be a key factor in
determining how women negotiated their lives in the city,
how safe they felt, and the amount of freedom they had in
accessing public spaces, particularly at certain times.
The city of Delhi, although considered to be relatively
cosmopolitan, modern, and one of the "best to live in India,"
also faces problems such as overcrowding, tremendous pres-
sure on its infrastructure, and rising crime rates. In the last
few years, the city has garnered the reputation of being
extremely unsafe for women (Roy Chowdhury, 2011). A
1996 study found that 91.7% of women hostelers of Delhi
University reported facing harassment on campus roads
everyday (Gender Study Group, cited in Mirsky, 2003). A
more recent report submitted by the Delhi police to the
Supreme Court of India revealed that complaints about
harassment in public spaces registered a fivefold increase
from 154 in 2012 to 793 in 2013 (Mahapatra, 2013). The
findings of a survey conducted by "Jagori" (2011), a nongov-
ernmental organization working on women's safety, throw
light on important facts about the harassment of women in
Delhi's public places. The report indicated that most inci-
dents of violence took place in broad daylight. Roads and
public transport emerged to be most unsafe. School and col-
lege students said that they hesitated to confront perpetrators
due to lack of confidence, or even report incidents at home,
for fear of being stopped from pursuing education. Although
70% of the women surveyed by Jagori nevertheless did
report confronting harassers, Mitra-Sarkar and Partheeban
(2011) found only 12% of women to do so in a study con-
ducted in Chennai. Women may choose not to retaliate in the
face of harassment due to the high risks involved. There have
been several reports from all over the world of women being
attacked on confronting their harassers. These attacks take
various forms including threats, beatings, and being run over
by vehicles. In 2013, a young girl in Florida was brutally
attacked on the street by a man she refused to have sex with.
The man unknown to her first dragged her into his car and
choked her. Then he dropped her on the ground and ran over
her multiple times, only stopping when witnesses intervened
(Kearl, 2013). In another incident that occurred in an
upmarket Delhi restaurant on International Women's Day
last year, a group of five men smashed a bottle on the head of
a woman who protested against lewd comments being passed
by them (Shekhar, 2013). Forms of retaliation from harassers
also include throwing acid on the woman they target.
Although no governmental statistics on acid attacks are
available, several media reports indicate that acid attacks on
women in India have been on the rise in recent years and
many of them have resulted in the death of the victims (Dhar,
2013; Kumar, 2014). These attacks have continued in the
face of recommendations of stricter regulation of acid sales
by the Supreme Court of India and an amendment in existing
laws to punish perpetrators of acid attacks with a 10-year
imprisonment.
Despite the challenges that it creates for women, the issue
of street harassment has been treated frivolously in the past.
"Eve-teasing" is the most common form of sexual violence
depicted in Hindi films (Ramasubramanian & Oliver, 2003),
typically shown as an act of romantic love rather than as a
crime. Baxi (2001) states that the term "eve-teasing" itself is
highly problematic as it constitutes women as "eves," tempt-
resses who provoke men, whereas "teasing" denotes that
harassment is viewed as playful. Contrary to what is depicted
in Indian movies, street harassment causes women to restrict
their time in public places alone, be perpetually alert, and
change neighborhoods and jobs (Kearl, 2010). Macmillan,
Nierobisz, and Welsh (2000) found that the more experiences
a woman had being harassed in public, the less safe she felt
in public. Harassment from strangers was associated with
increased fears about safety when walking alone at night,
using public transport, and walking alone in a parking garage.
In the study by the Gender Study Group in Delhi (cited in
Mirsky, 2003), 45% of women said that sexual harassment
on campus affected their personal or academic development
in some way such as avoiding library facilities, not joining
various institutions, and avoiding particular courses.
Given the seriousness of the issue and the limited docu-
mented information available, the purpose of this study was
to highlight the lived experiences of women in Delhi as they
attempt to resist the harassment they face while going about
their daily lives like commuting to work, walking to the mar-
ket, going for a movie, and so on. Many reasons have been
presented for why the issue of street harassment has been
relatively neglected, even in research in other parts of the
world. Bowman (1993) proposes that it has been overlooked
perhaps because there is no legal recourse as it is almost
impossible to catch strangers for harassment if they disap-
pear instantly. Furthermore, Lenton, Smith, Fox, and Morra
(1999) suggest that unless it rises to the level of assault, pub-
lic harassment is not illegal; some men and women construe
it as trivial or even flattering. Moreover, Gardner (1995)
writes that stranger harassment is so pervasive that it is a part
of the social fabric of public life and thus women experience
the harassment believing that no one will think anything of
significance has happened. We feel that it is the very
Dhillon and Bakaya 3
pervasiveness of street harassment and the recognition of it
being so by women that makes it extremely important to
study. With respect to Bowman's point, although it may be
true that sometimes it is difficult to catch strangers in public
places, it must be pointed out that in several cases, women
can identify the men who are harassing them. For example, a
man constantly touching a woman throughout the course of
her bus journey can easily be identified and nabbed provided
the woman believes she has someone to report the incident
to. Also, regarding the idea that some men as well as women
treat the issue trivially, we did not find this to be the case for
the women who participated in our study. There are therefore
several reasons for paying due attention to street harassment.
It needs to be acknowledged that street harassment is on the
rise, women's lives are deeply affected by it, and most
women in our experience do not trivialize it.
It is striking that while more urban Indian women than
ever before are taking up higher studies and careers, are dat-
ing and pursuing social lives, and thus stepping into public
spaces, these spaces are becoming increasingly dangerous
for women. The positive strides being made by women are
not translating into increased access to public spaces (Phadke,
2010). Several intersecting causes may explain the increased
dangers posed by public spaces to women, particularly the
threat of street harassment. Sociologists attribute the rise in
street harassment to urban migration, destruction of mohalla
culture, sudden upward mobility of certain caste groups, and
new wealth. Feminists identify street harassment as a source
of women's disempowerment and as a part of their system-
atic oppression. Patriarchal societies are seen to share a dis-
course that discourages women from leaving the private
sphere, which is the supposed site of patriarchal protection,
whereas public space is imagined as inherently dangerous
(Fregoso, 2003). When men are asked why they harass
women, some of the reasons given include reliving boredom,
entertaining their male friends, and because it is fun (Benard
& Schlaffer, 1996). The explanations provided by men con-
nect clearly to the tendency to objectify women. Although
harassment may be a conjunct of the objectification of
women, the outcome for women of being viewed by others in
sexually objectifying ways may produce a tendency of inter-
nalizing the harasser's perspective, resulting in increased
self-objectification (Fredrickson & Roberts, 1997). This con-
nection was partly supported in a study by Lord (2009),
which found that the more harassing behaviors young women
experienced, the more likely they were to report experienc-
ing fear and anger. Also, the more negatively the women felt
about being harassed, the more likely they were to report
lower self-esteem, unhappiness with their appearance, and
preoccupation with their weight. In addition, it seems that
women have come to be seen as "open persons." Goffman
(cited in Gardner, 1995) described "civil inattention" as the
way strangers behave toward each other in public, which
essentially means ignoring each other, except for briefly
meeting each other's eyes. An open person is someone who
falls into a category that allows civil inattention to lapse,
such as someone who is accompanied by a child. Individuals
who do not meet society's standards for what is ideal may
also fall into this category. It appears that men have for some
reason learned to treat women as open persons. The conse-
quence is that civil inattention becomes an important defense
for women to develop if they are to avoid the intrusive atten-
tion of men.
Considering the mounting reports of sexual harassment,
some agencies have taken steps to make Delhi's public
spaces more tolerable for women. In 2010, the Delhi Metro
Rail Corporation decided to reserve the first coach in every
train for women, although the segregation of men and women
does not address the reasons that lie behind harassment. In
2011, a "slutwalk" protest was organized in Delhi to high-
light the daily violence that women experience. Moreover
several demonstrations and discussions have taken place in
the media and other public forums after the heinous gang
rape of 2012. Although these attempts create awareness
about women's discontent, there is a continuing need to
understand how women in Delhi interpret their experiences
of street harassment, particularly in the face of the contradic-
tions of modernity and tradition that shape the lives of
women in Indian cities and transformations being witnessed
by India's urban hubs. In this study, we looked not only at
women's views on the pervasiveness of the phenomenon and
the reasons behind it but also attempted to identify the overt
and covert reactions and coping mechanisms adopted by the
women against the harassment. We also looked at the con-
cerns expressed by the women's families. In addition, we
sought to understand what women found most dissatisfac-
tory about the present state of affairs and the changes they
desired to feel safer in the city.
Participants
The participants were 20 women between the ages of 18 and
30 years residing in Delhi. The women either belonged to the
city or had been living here for a considerable period of time
and came from middle- and upper-middle-class families.
Twelve participants were students and were pursuing bache-
lor's or master's degrees in subjects like elementary educa-
tion and literature. The remaining participants were working
and engaged in professions such as journalism, medicine,
and business. Fifteen participants were unmarried whereas
the remaining were married. Nearly all the participants were
Hindu by religion. One participant mentioned that her mother
was Hindu and father was a Muslim, whereas her own reli-
gious orientation was "spiritual."
The sample was recruited through convenience and snow-
ball sampling and data was collected through face-to-face
semistructured interviews. As all the participants and inter-
viewers were bilingual, the interviews were conducted in
Hindi and English. These ranged in length from 32 to 90 min.
Each interview was audiotaped and subsequently transcribed.
4 SAGE Open
The interviews were analyzed using the interpretative phe-
nomenological approach (Smith & Eatough, 2007). First, the
interviews were read to comprehend the essence of each
interview. Thereafter, similarities and differences across all
interviews were noted. Then initial themes were identified,
organized into clusters, and checked against the data. The
final themes and subthemes that emerged were then put
together as a narrative account of the interplay between par-
ticipants' perspectives and researchers' interpretations of
same.
Results and Discussion
The themes that emerged from the analysis have been pre-
sented below with illustrative passages from the interviews.
Omnipresence of Street Harassment
The women we spoke to perceived street harassment to be
extremely prevalent. Frequencies mentioned by the women
ranged from being harassed on 50% of visits to public places
to being harassed on all such occasions. Prevalence rates
reported here are similar to those reported by other samples
from Delhi (Gender Study group, cited in Mirsky, 2003) and
samples from foreign countries such as the United States
(Nielsen, 2000). Harassment took place in various forms
such as men staring, passing lewd comments, and rubbing
against women's bodies. Once again participants' responses
indicate that street harassment occurs in similar ways across
geographically distant places. Women in countries like
Britain (Kearl, 2010) and Egypt have reported similar forms
of harassment (Ilahi, 2009). With respect to the kinds of pub-
lic spaces in which such harassment occurred most often,
rather than isolated places where a woman may find herself
alone with the harasser, harassment was reported to occur in
crowded spaces.Although the perception may be that women
are safer in places where they are among other people, this
does not appear to be true with respect to street harassment.
Mediums of public transport such as buses and the metro
emerged to be spaces mentioned with the greatest frequency.
At any given time of day, modes of public transport are
extremely crowded in Delhi. This kind of crowding brings
men and women in close proximity creating the possibilities
of unwanted touches. It also makes it difficult for the woman
to judge whether the behavior was intentional or uninten-
tional and therefore to question the aggressor. The partici-
pants reported the harassment in modes of public transport to
be so rampant that some had stopped traveling in buses alto-
gether and traveled only in the ladies' compartment of the
metro. With respect to time of day, the participants faced
harassment during broad daylight. These findings support
those of the Jagori report. Women believed that harassment
occurred after dark as well but said that because they avoided
being in public places on their own after sundown due to
safety concerns, they did not have to face the harassment.
Ruhi, a 28-year-old freelance writer, said,
It happens the most during rush hours, when you are coming
from office or going to office or school or college. There's a lot
of rush at that time. It's very easy for people to (harass). At
night, I wouldn't know because I don't travel alone. When I was
using public transport, I would use it during the day. In the night
I am sure that (the harassment) is worse.
There was no clear-cut consensus on the characteristics of
men whom they were harassed by. Whereas some women
considered younger men from lower socioeconomic back-
grounds to harass them most often, others said that they had
been harassed by men of all ages, backgrounds, and educa-
tional levels. For instance, Sushmita, a 21-year-old student
of chartered accountancy, said,
I don't think I can pin-point a particular type because I have
experienced being eve-teased by people of my grandfather's age
and people wearing proper shirts and ties and going to office.
People like them and people who are absolutely useless, whiling
away time on the streets. I don't think there is any type.
The fact that no specific demographic characteristics
emerged to be significant is not surprising. Past research has
indicated that the sexual harassment of women is not usually
related to a man's age, marital status, physical attractiveness,
or occupation (Gutek, 1985; Paludi & Barickman, 1998).
Male harassers are more distinguishable by their psychologi-
cal characteristics (Paludi & Barickman, 1998; Pryor, Giedd,
& William, 1995) rather than by demographic
characteristics.
Perceived Reasons
On being asked why they felt harassment was omnipresent in
Delhi, the women provided several possible reasons. By and
large, Delhi was perceived to be more unsafe, crime-infested,
and prone to instances of street harassment than the other big
cities of India. Some women connected increasing rates of
street harassment to the presence of male immigrants who
came from what were perceived to more oppressive pockets
of the country. The participants believed that men who came
from parts of the country in which women were expected to
remain only within the domestic sphere, used harassment as
a way to demean the women in Delhi who stepped into pub-
lic spaces. For instance, Ruhi said, "Small town men in awe
of Delhi women, very male ego thing. That why are women
so strong, why are women traveling, why are they doing all
of that stuff. So they try to put you down." Delhi being the
capital of the nation witnesses a large amount of in-migra-
tion. According to a report by the Indian Institute of Human
Settlement (IIHS), the two largest streams of migration into
the city are from Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. Better job pros-
pects is one of the main reasons for migration into the city,
with a majority of workers finding employment in the unor-
ganized service sector (Delhi Human Development Report,
2006). To our knowledge, there is no past research that links
increasing immigration into the city with rising rates of street
Dhillon and Bakaya 5
harassment. Neither is there any data to indicate that most
harassers are men who do not belong to the city. Considering
that studies have indicated men of all demographic profiles
to engage in harassment, the views expressed by the partici-
pants need to be understood within the context of commonly
held perceptions regarding immigrants. First, for example,
there are widespread negative stereotypes especially about
Bihari people such as being rural, poor laborers, and unedu-
cated (Lynnebakke, 2007). Second, and linked to the first
point, there have been instances of people in high adminis-
trative positions publicly blaming immigrants for the prob-
lems of the city. In 2012, the then chief minister of Delhi
identified the "unbridled influx" of migrants into Delhi as a
major challenge and blamed the burgeoning population for
the city's problems. Given the notions that exist about immi-
grant populations, women may perceive them to be a threat
to their safety although the reality of these beliefs remain to
be objectively tested. However, many participants saw the
patriarchal culture within Delhi as perpetuating harassment.
Komal, a 29-year-old woman working in a multinational
company, said, "It's purely got to do with the ethos of the
men here. One, they feel that (harassment) is their right.
Second, they feel that it's right. They don't feel it's morally
wrong." Participants also felt that taboos around sex, the
extremely lopsided sex ratio of Delhi (868 females per 1,000
males, which is lower than the national average), and the
lack of close community ties contributed to the harassment
of women. Other given reasons included weak and poorly
implemented laws and lack of awareness about the laws.
Most participants reported that they themselves knew little
about the laws on street harassment. There is no law in the
Indian penal code (IPC) that exists specifically for street
harassment. However, certain sections of the IPC that pertain
to men indulging in obscene gestures, remarks, or songs,
showing pornographic material to women, making sexually
colored remarks, and so on, can evoke imprisonments and
fines. The findings point to the need to create awareness
about the laws as well as their effective implementation.
Reactions to Street Harassment
Women reported a variety of reactions to the harassers rang-
ing from nonconfrontational to highly confrontational.
Sometimes women just ignored the harassment. At other
times, they reacted, for example, by staring back at the
harasser, hitting him, or shouting at him. For each woman,
the decision to confront the harasser was based on certain
considerations such as whether she was in a familiar place,
whether she was with an elder person, or whether the harasser
had crossed a certain line. At times, women chose to move
away from harassers due to fears that the situation might
escalate further. Although several reasons have been identi-
fied in Western studies for why women will not react in these
situations, including societal pressure; concern about being
called a feminist; fear of retaliation; or fear of being
perceived as impolite, aggressive, or nonfeminine (Swim &
Hyers, 1999), the main reason given by participants in this
study was fear of escalation. This is not surprising in light of
the attacks on women we discussed earlier on. Some women
also said that they did not want to "create a scene."Appearing
impolite, aggressive, or unfeminine were not mentioned at
all. Most women believed that bystanders would be unsup-
portive in such situations because they were busy or because
harassment did not impact their lives. This thought also com-
pelled the women to abstain from confrontations. Despite
behaving nonconfrontationally at times, many women felt
that it was actually better to confront harassers and wished
that they did so more often. Most participants felt that when
women remained quiet, they sent out the message that they
were submitting to harassment. Meenakshi, a 22-year-old
student pursuing a bachelor's degree in elementary educa-
tion considered it important to "shame" the harassers. She
said, "(When I lash out) people are taken aback. You can see
shame on their faces that a girl said this to them and they
walk off." Yet, women also felt that while by confronting
they were trying to tell that harasser to stop, he himself could
misinterpret the confrontation as an invitation. Like Asmita,
a 25-year-old journalist, said, "(Harassers) think this girl
abuses, she must be really feisty. So it becomes (that) she is
trying to encourage it, let's come back."
Being harassed was also associated with negative emo-
tions such as feeling embarrassed, unsafe, disgusted, objecti-
fied, and frustrated. In line with the findings of Swim, Hyers,
Cohen, and Ferguson (2001), we also found anger to be com-
mon among the participants. Women felt angry over the idea
that harassment was ubiquitous, passed off as inconsequen-
tial, and faced by participants simply because they were
women. Contrary to men's reports that they intend to compli-
ment women by passing comments or touching them, none
of the women said that they found such experiences flatter-
ing. Gardner (1995) has pointed out that even when the con-
tent of street remarks is complimentary, other features of the
remarks might preclude them from being understood as com-
pliments as they occur in a public place, are passed among
unacquainted members of the opposite sex, the expected
compliment response--thank you--is unacceptable and
often produces escalating hostility and the remarks often
refer to parts of the body not available for public examina-
tion. Hence, they do not serve the same function as compli-
ments. Not only were acts of harassment completely
unwelcome, each woman believed that street harassment
incidents could take uglier turns such as being raped, being
attacked with acid, getting kidnapped, and so on. A mounting
body of evidence suggests that street harassment causes
women to be more aware of their sexual vulnerability, one of
the greatest fears being that of rape (MacMillan et al., 2000).
Whereas some women reported suppressing these feelings,
others said that they shared them with friends and parents.
Means of coping also included crying to vent feelings or tell-
ing one's self that it was a usual part of life in Delhi.
6 SAGE Open
Ironically, although this thought provided a superficial sense
of consolation, the idea that harassment was embedded in the
city's functioning was also what deeply angered the
participants.
Family Reactions
While street harassment clearly affects the women who face
it, their families are bound to be effected as well. However,
concerns and worries of family members with respect to the
harassment of women in public places have largely gone
unstudied. Many participants reported that their mothers and
fathers remained worried about their safety. To keep their
daughters safe, parents were reported to use two kinds of
measures. The first was imposing restrictions on where their
daughters could go and what time they needed to come back.
This inhibited some of the participants in talking to their par-
ents about the issue because they were wary of the restric-
tions. For example, Komal said,
So my parents would tell me don't go out. If I discuss with them
then my freedom is curtailed. So I don't want to discuss it. They
know they can't make the world a safer place so they just want
to reduce the chances of anything happening to me.
The second response from parents was advising their
daughters on how to handle unpleasant situations. Some par-
ents advised their daughters to take action against the aggres-
sor. For instance, Meenakshi said, "My dad is like, even if
you have to hit someone below the belt do that . . . and if you
feel overpowered, then and there call police." Her father also
advised her on other more nonconfrontational ways of
remaining safe. She said,
His reaction is that be safe no matter what it takes, whether it is
conservativeclothing.Ifyouhavetowearsomethingflamboyant,
suit your behavior and your transport accordingly . . . don't be
too loud, don't attract too much attention towards yourself.
However, some parents advised their daughters to simply
get away from the harasser. For example, Sushmita said,
Whenever I have started fighting (with the harasser), my mom
gets scared and she tells me to stay away from it which is also I
think one huge problem because that also somewhere tells you
that you cannot do anything.
This indicates that though the participants understood
their parents' concerns, they were not willing to adopt every-
thing their parents suggested and desired to use their own
judgments in determining how a particular situation should
be handled.
Apathy
The participants believed that there was general apathy
toward women's concerns about street harassment, which
was seen to extend from politicians and police to the general
public. They felt that harassment was seen as a "normal and
regular affair" and thus ignored. Politicians were seen as
extremely insensitive for blaming women for the harassment
they faced. Devika, a 19-year-old student of literature, said,
I remember there was this news correspondent who was
returning after her work, late at night, and she was killed or
harassed, something happened to her. And the chief minister
simply said that why are women traveling so late at night when
they know that it is not safe!
According to Ilahi (2009), street harassment may be partly
ignored by authorities because women do not usually report
cases of harassment to the police. This may happen for two
reasons. One reason that has already been identified in previ-
ous literature is the difficultly involved in identifying the
harasser. Like Asmita said, "It's not that you can provide
much information. (Police) will say `Who was it?' I don't
know. What was the car number (of the harasser)? I don't
know." The other reason may be the sense of mistrust women
have toward the police. Some women reported that they had
been stared at and whistled at by police personnel. Ruhi talked
about how the police, like politicians, could pose a danger to
women by blaming them. In line with this, Meenakshi dis-
cussed how when she and her friend decided to report an
instance of molestation at the local police station, they were
toldbyawomanconstablethatthekindofclothesMeenakshi's
friend was wearing was bound to result in harassment. Thus,
the belief that the police could be extremely insensitive
extended to female police personnel as well. Some women
expressed dissatisfaction with police efforts. Sushmita said,
"If you go to (police) they might do something. I myself have
gone to police and police have shouted at (harassers). But if
you are just standing there, I haven't seen a single policeman
come up." Meenakshi said that attitudes of the police differed
from one police station to another. Police personnel stationed
near her college were responsive because they knew the col-
lege principal, but police stations further off were not.
Perceptions of the police as apathetic seem widespread.
Mitra-Sarkar and Partheeban (2011) found that 11% of the
women surveyed by them sought assistance from the police
and only a few found them helpful. Indian women's move-
ments have said that women's complaints of sexual harass-
ment are routinely disbelieved. Moreover Baxi (2001) asserts
that assault reports are open to interpretation by the police. It
is clear that what women believe about the attitudes of law-
enforcing agencies has profound implications for how they
approach incidents of harassment. When women believe the
state machinery to be either unwilling or unable to redress
their problems, as expressed here, it often functions to silence
women around the issue.
Strategies for Self-Protection
When within public spaces, women anticipated facing
harassment and actively adopted strategies to prevent it from
Dhillon and Bakaya 7
occurring. The strategies chosen by the women were directed
at keeping attention away from themselves and marking their
personal boundaries within the public spaces that they occu-
pied. Phadke (2010) asserts that safety for women does not
automatically come from institutional factors like infrastruc-
ture or policing but has to be actively produced by women on
an everyday basis. The production of safety takes place with
the implicit understanding that the responsibility of negotiat-
ing "danger" rests with women. Not surprisingly, as public
transport was seen as one of the most common sites for
harassment, some participants who were able to afford per-
sonal cars chose to travel by their own vehicles. However,
even traveling in a car would not always be safe particularly
after dark. Harshita, a 27-year-old information technology
(IT) professional, spoke of how she ensured that every door
and window of her car remained locked when she was driv-
ing alone because she had been followed and harassed even
in her own car. While using public transport, women tended
to protect their bodies from unwelcome touches and stares in
various ways. For example, Meenakshi said,
When I am traveling in public transport I try to cover my breasts.
I would just wrap my arms around (myself) or I will hug the pole
in the bus . . . I make it a point to carry stole . . . When I am in a
crowded place I try to wedge everyone with my elbows and I
push people.
Hence, the women used certain nonsexual parts of their
bodies and scarves to protect more sexualized parts such as
breasts. Nupur, a 20-year-old student pursuing a graduate
degree in psychology, said that in buses women would put
their bags between themselves and copassengers to avoid
being touched. Women have also been found to modify their
public behaviors in order not to draw unwanted male atten-
tion (Guano, 2007). This was also found to hold true for the
participants in the present study. Some women adopted
"dead-pan" facial expressions and avoided eye-contact with
strangers so as not to attract attention. Women also chose
their clothing according to where they were going and
avoided staying out till late. Harshita said,
As a girl you have to be conscious 24×7 in this city. You have to
be conscious of where you are going what you are wearing, what
time you are going to be there. You leave at a certain time, you
be back at a certain time. When you are stepping out, then you
anyways have to be careful about what you are wearing . . . You
would not wear very tight t-shirts, skirts and all of that.
Because what women wear has been used to legitimize
harassment, many women alter their dressing styles in the
public sphere. They attempt to draw less attention to them-
selves by clothes that hide their bodies to attain more public
freedom although they may not actually achieve this free-
dom. Despite the importance given by the women to dressing
in a certain way, most said that women's clothing was not
responsible for harassment. Whereas some said that reveal-
ing clothes attracted unwanted attention, all the participants
reported that they had been harassed while wearing loose
clothing that covered their bodies. Nupur explained that
despite knowing clothing could not provide protection from
harassment and believing that clothes were not responsible
for harassment, she continued to wear clothes that covered
her body so that no one would get a chance to blame her for
the harassment. In line with this belief, Phadke (2007) states
that women who dress in a way that is socially defined as
provocative are seen as "asking for trouble" and unlikely to
receive public sympathy if they are harassed publicly.
Another strategy for preventing harassment was to avoid
going out alone at night. Interestingly, street harassment
occurs mostly in crowded places, and at night, the crowds
may be expected to be less. Despite this, women felt vulner-
able going out at night especially on their own. It is apparent
here that harassment had forced women out of public spaces
at least at certain times and increased their dependence on
men. Bowman (1993) has theorized that street harassment
substantially limits the liberty of women in the most funda-
mental sense of freedom from restraint. It reduces the physi-
cal and geographical mobility of women, preventing them
from appearing alone in public space and in the process
accomplishing an "informal ghettoization" of women to the
private space of the home. Feminists note that the reasons for
keeping women away from public spaces may be rooted in
the patriarchal demands for closely monitoring and control-
ling the sexuality and thus the mobility of women, particu-
larly those who are young. Sen (1984) discusses the different
ways in which patriarchal setups control and channelize
young women's sexuality. One of these ways is to dominate
and control public spaces and for men to claim that public
spaces are male-only dominions. When women do enter
these spaces, they are tolerated only within very strict limits
of movement, action, and dress and "transgressions" are
often met with harsh retribution in the form of sexual and
physical assaults. Anwary (2003) for instance discusses how
the increase in acid violence against women in Bangladesh
since the late 1980s may partly be a result of a reassertion of
patriarchy in the face of perceived threats of female employ-
ment and independence. Similarly, it has been suggested that
the postrevolution spate of sexual attacks on women in Egypt
may be the result of a large-scale campaign from Egypt's
security forces to undermine the political opposition. By tar-
nishing political demonstrations with sexual violence, it is
thought that elements of the security forces hostile to the
revolution might discredit its moral standing and discourage
female protesters from taking part (Holman, 2012). Here one
senses not the state's apathy but complicity in the
pandemic.
Although most women believed that many strategies they
adopted were effective in reducing the amount of harassment
they faced, the possibility of getting harassed always
remained. Thus, the strategies did not guarantee protection.
Only one strategy was seen by every participant as an almost
foolproof way of avoiding harassment, which was to go into
public spaces with a male. Devika said,
8 SAGE Open
When I am accompanied by a male . . . I don't know why but I
feel more secure. Because probably when accompanied by a
male . . . the person who is the harasser doesn't have that much
of confidence to initiate an assault.
The word almost is imperative here as in both cases of the
gang rape that occurred in 2012 and the incident in the mar-
ketplace that happened a few months later, the women were
assaulted despite being accompanied by men. Men who
attempt to intervene and stop the harassment may also be
attacked as is what happened in 2011 when two young men
were beaten and killed for defending their female friends
from harassment outside a restaurant in Mumbai
(McGivering, 2011).
Required Changes
Some participants felt that for harassment to reduce, a com-
plete social change and "social upliftment" was required. For
instance, Devika said, "you know I think there is a dire need
for a change, a revolution wherein women are given the
respect they need and they deserve. The disparities between
men and women should really decrease." Ruhi felt a certain
amount of responsibility lay with women. She said, "It is not
going to help unless it's a collective consciousness, where
women are actively taking a stand and going out and hitting
(harassers) out and police is there to support you." Also,
women had to stop feeling embarrassed by the harassment,
and sensitivity and awareness had to be created around the
graveness of the issue as opposed to glamorizing it. Sushmita
said,
If it is taught that, not only to the girls but also to the boys that it
is wrong, it is not funny, it is not cool, it does not give you a right
to raise your collar and walk around with your friends by eve-
teasing a girl, that's not really showing your manliness. From a
woman's perspective at a very personal level I think we need to
stop getting embarrassed by such situations.
The participants also felt that the police needed to be more
proactive. Sakshi, a 25-year-old entrepreneur, said, "There
should be more awareness in police as well. They should
make sure women can travel. There should be more police
booths, more numbers where women can just call up. There
is hardly any awareness about such numbers." Stricter pun-
ishments for the harassers and a more supportive attitude
from police personnel were also seen to be important.
Participants also expressed that apart from being too busy or
uninterested in helping, bystanders did not get involved
thinking that they themselves would get extremely entangled
in the complex legal process. Ruhi said,
It's such a big issue that you need your police, you need
governance in the city to help you do that. Our government
should take strict action. They need to really start punishing
these guys. I am sure there are a certain category of people who
want to go out and help others but they can't do it because they
know it's not going to leave them anywhere . . . If I am being
harassed and your brother is on the road and trying to help me
and he helps me and it becomes a police case, your brother is
going to get pulled into it. He doesn't even know me. He's just
going to get stuck. But if your brother knows that even if he
makes a police complaint, or confronts this (harasser) his family
life is not going to get effected in any which way, he will step out
and do it.
Many women referred to the media as a source of infor-
mation through which they learnt the frequency and types of
crime that were being committed against women in the city.
A majority of participants believed that the media could play
a role in creating awareness against street harassment. For
instance, Devika said,
I think media can play a very vital role because they can actually
bring about a change by propagating the right kind of messages
. . . they must encourage women to stand up for themselves, and
stand up for their security and safety. They must encourage
women to actually report to the authorities, to actually adopt
certain measures for security probably like carrying pepper
spray, indulging in martial arts, taekwondo, etc.
However certain others felt that the media was also prone
to blowing issues out of proportion and portraying women as
damsels in distress needing good men to protect them from
bad men. Ruhi felt that although the media could bring atten-
tion to such issues, real changes would only occur if the judi-
cial system took the issue more seriously. The combined
responses of the participants thus indicate the need for simul-
taneous changes at multiple levels so that women can access
the city in the ways that they want to.
In line with our expectations, we found that street harass-
ment by male strangers was extremely influential in deter-
mining how women approached life in the city. The views
presented by the participants enabled us to identify a number
of factors and processes through which street harassment
persists in being an impediment to women's freedom and
security. These appear to operate in a cyclical manner and
have been presented in Figure 1.
Harassment within public places appears to occur in mul-
tiple forms with high frequency, most often in broad daylight
and in crowded spaces. It is an outcome of a number of vari-
ables that appear to be interrelated. Within patriarchal societ-
ies, women are often treated as objects. This objectification
is considered natural and justified. Women are also often
blamed for the violence they face. In a society that largely
operates on these premises, apathy from the police, poor
implementation of laws, as well as indifference from bystand-
ers toward women's problems are excepted outcomes. Given
the very nature of street harassment, the fact that it carries
dangers of further harm, such as rape and acid attacks and the
sheer dismissal of the issue at various fronts, women report
feeling a variety of negative emotions in response to it
Dhillon and Bakaya 9
including anger and fear. Anxiety is also experienced by the
women's families who have little control over what the
women have to deal with in public places. Because women
anticipate harassment and believe that help will not be forth-
coming from other quarters, they actively adopt self-protec-
tive strategies to prevent it from occurring in the first place
although no strategies guarantee safety. When confronted
with instances of harassment, women's overt reactions that
may range from moving away to confronting the harasser are
mediated by a variety of considerations. Although women
would rather confront the harassers than ignore them, it is
most strongly the fear of retaliation and the concern that their
reaction may be misinterpreted as an invitation that inhibits
women from taking action. In such circumstances, confron-
tation may lead to further harassment. However, the choice
to remain silent and ignore harassers is also a difficult one for
women, as silence is also seen to perpetuate the culture of
harassment.
Conclusion
The constant possibility of being harassed in public places
controlled several aspects of the participants'lives, including
their timings of travel, choice of clothing, and behavior in the
public sphere. However, there were two positive findings in
the study. First, though self-blame has been found to occur

among women who experience harassment (Kearl, 2010),
none of the women we spoke to attributed the harassment
they faced to anything they did, said, or wore. The responsi-
bility for harassment was placed squarely on the shoulders of
the harasser. Second, although previous research has estab-
lished linkages between street harassment and women's ten-
dency for self-objectification, we did not find this to be the
case, for example, in the form of lowered self-esteem or
greater preoccupation with weight or appearance. However,
studying the relationship between levels of street harassment
and self-objectification in Indian samples appears to be a rel-
evant area for future research.
The detailed perspectives and instances shared by the par-
ticipants point to the need to treat street harassment as a
deeply serious matter. Of all the changes that the participants
wished to see, the most significant was a change in the way
the police responded to instances of harassment. The ineffec-
tive manner in which the police operated was perceived to
further deter already apathetic bystanders from helping
women being harassed. Moreover, police personnel were
seen as potential harassers. Unless women believe that the
police force of the city shall cooperate with them, they are
unlikely to report such incidents. Crimes that go unreported
foreclose the possibility of perpetrators being punished and
allow offenses to occur repeatedly. It is thus imperative to
create better redressal mechanisms and also for the police
force of the city to proactively reach out to women to estab-
lish trust. The findings also indicate that contrary to common
perception, police patrolling and the creation of safety are
required not only at night and at isolated spots but also dur-
ing the day and in crowded places. Modes of public transport
need to be closely monitored, considering that they are seen
to be extremely unsafe, so much so that some women had
stopped using them altogether. In addition, creating aware-
ness about laws is important in which the outspoken Indian
media and once again the police can play an important role.
Organizations like Jagori are already involved in such initia-
tives. Over a year ago, the Supreme Court has ordered that in
the event of a complaint of harassment, the driver must take
the vehicle to the nearest police station. If the driver does not,
then the authorities must cancel his permit to ply. This was
part of directions issued by the court to fight street harass-
ment including the installation of closed-circuit televisions
(CCTVs) and deputation of plainclothed female police per-
sonnel in public places. Effective implementation of these
and other measures like adequately functioning toilets for
women and men, proper street lighting, and gender sensitiza-
tion programs based on feminist values, particularly in
schools and colleges to enable young people to challenge
misogynistic notions, shall be critical to reducing instances
of harassment.
Like any research, this study has certain limitations.
First, the study is intended to elucidate women's experi-
ences; however, it does not endeavor generalizations. The
sample of the study was small and participants in this study
were urban, young, north Indian, and moderately affluent.
Women's experiences of street harassment vary in accor-
dance with race, age, and class. For example, women from
lower socioeconomic backgrounds would be even more vul-
nerable to harassment in public spaces considering that they
are likely to spend more time in these spaces than women
from more affluent backgrounds. Women who belong to dif-
ferent parts of the country, particular the north-east, may
experience harassment in unique ways. Future research
within this area needs to understand experiences of women
from various castes, classes, and regions to understand how
these categories interact with and shape women's experi-
ences in public spaces. Second, we cannot ignore the possi-
bility that there may have been more to the experiences of
the participants than the present interviews captured. The
nature of any person's experience is always in part inacces-
sible to others. Finally, the possibility of researcher's bias
cannot be ignored in a qualitative study. However, the
researchers attempted to maintain reflexivity throughout the
research process.
