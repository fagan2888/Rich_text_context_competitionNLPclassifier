Abstract
By using short-term direct finance firms of the highest credit quality expose
themselves to rollover risk in the public debt markets. Firms insure themselves
against this risk by securing backup lines of credit from banks that they may
use should market liquidity dry up. In a first step, this paper explains why
high quality firms introduce a maturity mismatch into their balance sheets
and do not simply use long-term direct finance. It also highlights why banks
may be willing to roll over a firm's debt while direct investors may not. In a
second step, I extend the model to allow for different levels of firm's publicly
observable credit quality. Under plausible assumptions about the cost of bank
borrowing the model generates a maturity structure choice broadly consistent
with observed financing patterns: Low quality firms issue short-term direct
debt, medium quality firms issue long-term direct debt, and high quality firms
use short-term direct debt in normal times and bank debt in adverse times. The
paper suggests that better publicly available information about firm quality and
the moderation of the business cycle over the past decade help to explain the
decrease in nonfinancial commercial paper outstanding since the beginning of
the decade.

Non-technical summary
A unique feature of the market for nonfinancial commercial paper is that it usu-
ally accepts only very high-quality paper that bears virtually no risk of default.
Nonetheless, firms are sometimes unable to roll over their commercial paper and
have to draw down backup lines of credit which they pre-arranged with banks. This
paper lays out a simple model that aims to answer two important questions about
the commercial paper market and firms' choice of financing arrangements. First,
why are firms of the highest credit quality sometimes denied short-term credit in
public markets though their default risk is minuscule? Second, why do they pre-
fer a financing arrangement whereby they use short-term direct finance in "good"
times and short-term bank debt in "bad" times instead of simply issuing long-term
direct debt and getting rid of the maturity mismatch? The model proposes that
while high-quality firms have no default risk during good times, some of these firms'
prospects deteriorate during bad times. Direct investors who do not know which
firms' prospects worsen in case of recession are better off denying credit to all firms
during bad times. Asymmetric information between investors and the firm hence
matters during recessions. However, in good times direct investors refinance all firms
and asymmetric information does not play a role.
By contrast, banks by screening borrowers who they committed to lend on a
contingent basis are able to differentiate between good and bad firms. However, as
screening is costly it is only used when needed (i.e. during recessions). Borrowing
short-term and making the choice between direct and intermediated finance depen-
dent on the aggregate state of the economy may in the end be a cheaper option for
firms than simply issuing long-term direct debt. In the latter case direct investors
need to be compensated for the risk of making a loss as a result of being unable to
identify and liquidate bad firms during a recession.
Extending the model to allow for differences in firms' publicly observable risk
characteristics (i.e. credit rating) it is possible to derive firms' debt maturity choice
as a function of their ratings. Firms with the highest ratings are able and willing to
issue commercial paper and secure a backup line of credit. Firms with slightly lower
ratings issue long-term direct debt and firms with still lower ratings are restricted to
borrow short-term. These latter firms will always be liquidated during bad times.
Finally, the paper examines the comparative statics with respect to changes in
the degree of asymmetric information and the probability of the economy entering
a recession. Information between investors and the firm becoming more symmetric
(e.g. as a result of the 'IT revolution') and/or recessions becoming less likely ('Great
Moderation') lead to an increase in direct lending and fewer firms issuing commercial
paper and securing a backup line of credit. These structural reasons may help explain
the large decline in nonfinancial commercial paper issuance since the beginning of
the decade.

Kapitalmarktf¨
ahige Unternehmen k¨
onnen sich nur dann durch die Ausgabe von
kurzfristigen Geldmarktpapieren (Commercial Paper - CP) refinanzieren, wenn sie
eine vernachl¨
assigbare Ausfallwahrscheinlichkeit aufweisen. Gleichwohl ist es diesen
Firmen bisweilen nicht m¨
oglich, eine Anschlussfinanzierung vorzunehmen. In solchen
Situationen k¨
onnen CP-Emittenten auf Kreditlinien ausweichen, sofern sie diese
zuvor mit Banken vereinbart haben und sich ihre Kreditqualit¨
at bei Inanspruch-
nahme der Kreditlinie nicht verschlechtert hat. In dem vorliegenden Papier wer-
den zun¨
achst zwei Fragenkomplexe n¨
aher untersucht. Erstens, warum bekommen
Firmen von h¨
ochster Kreditqualit¨
at zu bestimmten Zeiten keinen Kredit, obwohl
ihre tats¨
achliche Ausfallwahrscheinlichkeit nahe null liegt? Zweitens, warum w¨
ahlen
diese Firmen eine Finanzierungsform, bei der sie sich in guten Zeiten ¨
uber die Aus-
gabe von Geldmarktpapieren finanzieren und in schlechten Zeiten einen Bankkredit
in Anspruch nehmen? Warum nehmen sie eine Inkongruenz der Laufzeiten zwischen
Aktiv- und Passivseite in Kauf, anstatt lang laufende Anleihen zu emittieren und
sich somit keinem Refinanzierungsrisiko auszusetzen?
In dem vorgestellten Modell haben s¨
amtliche Firmen im normalen Zustand der
¨
Okonomie zun¨
achst kein Ausfallrisiko. Bei einer Rezession verschlechtern sich die
Aussichten eines Teils dieser Firmen allerdings betr¨
achtlich. Direkte Investoren
k¨
onnen zwischen solchen Firmen, deren Ausblick unabh¨
angig vom Zustand der
¨
Okonomie ist, und solchen, deren Ausblick sich bei Rezessionen deutlich verschlech-
tert, nicht unterscheiden und verweigern deshalb im Falle eines wirtschaftlichen Ab-
schwungs allen Firmen einen Kredit. Asymmetrische Information zwischen Fir-
men und direkten Investoren spielt folglich nur in Rezessionsphasen eine Rolle. In
guten Zeiten werden hingegen alle Firmen refinanziert. Im Unterschied zu direk-
ten Investoren k¨
onnen Banken private Informationen ¨
uber potentielle Kreditnehmer
gewinnen, vorausgesetzt, sie unterhalten bereits eine Gesch¨
aftsbeziehung zu der
Firma. Diese Informationen versetzen sie in die Lage, zwischen guten und schlechten
Kreditnehmern zu unterscheiden und in einer Abschwungphase nur gute zu refi-
nanzieren. Da das Screening durch Banken allerdings teuer ist, werden Bankkre-
dite nur dann in Anspruch genommen, wenn eine andere Finanzierungsform nicht
verf¨
ugbar ist (d.h. in Rezessionen). Die kurzfristige Finanzierung erm¨
oglicht eine
flexible Anpassung an ver¨
anderte Zust¨
ande der Gesamtwirtschaft und kann dabei
g¨
unstiger sein als die Ausgabe von l¨
angerfristigen Bonds. Insbesondere muss eine
l¨
angerfristige Finanzierung nicht-informierte Investoren f¨
ur das Risiko kompensieren,
in Rezessionen schlechte Firmen nicht erkennen und liquidieren zu k¨
onnen.
Bei einer Erweiterung des Modells um Firmen mit in normalen Zeiten posi-
tiven und ¨
offentlich bekannten Ausfallwahrscheinlichkeiten (Ratings), l¨
asst sich die
Wahl der F¨

ochsten Kreditqualit¨

finanzierung durch eine Kreditlinie bei Banken ab. Firmen mit etwas geringerem
Rating emittieren langfristige Anleihen. Firmen, deren Rating gerade noch eine Di-
rektfinanzierung erlaubt, k¨
onnen nur kurzfristige Anleihen emittieren und m¨
ussen
auf eine Liquidit¨

nisse sind weitestgehend konsistent mit empirischen Untersuchungen zur Wahl der
Laufzeiten von Unternehmensverbindlichkeiten.
In einem letzten Schritt wird der Einfluss einer ¨
Anderung des Grades an asym-

zeigt sich, dass mit zunehmend symmetrischer Information - etwa infolge besserer
Verbreitung von Information durch das Internet - und mit abnehmender Rezessions-
wahrscheinlichkeit ("Great Moderation") sich mehr Firmen direkt am Kapitalmarkt
refinanzieren und weniger ¨
uber die Ausgabe von CP in Verbindung mit einer Kredit-

Rollover Risk in Commercial Paper Markets
and Firms' Debt Maturity Choice1
1 Introduction
The subprime crisis of 2007 put an often overlooked segment of the financial mar-
kets into the limelight: the market for commercial paper (CP). As uncertainty about
credit losses related to the US subprime housing market surged in the summer of
2007, investors began to shun any security for which such losses were deemed pos-
sible. In particular, this included asset-backed commercial papers (ABCPs), which
are collateralized short-term debt instruments that are continuously rolled over to
provide financing to an issuing programme. With major banks providing backup
liquidity to ABCP programmes, resulting rollover problems quickly translated into
high demands for liquidity from banks. This appears to have taken some CP issuers
and banks by surprise during this episode.
By contrast, in the market for nonfinancial CP rollover problems and resulting
demands for liquidity from banks have been well-known phenomena ever since the
Penn Central bankruptcy episode in 1970. In the aftermath of the recession of
1969/1970 and a sharp increase in spreads on commercial paper and bonds, Penn
Central Transportation Company failed in June 1970 and defaulted on its USD 82m
outstanding CP. As described by Davis (1999) investors, uncertain over credit risk,
were driven away from the CP market. Companies in turn proved unable to roll
over their CP and without alternative funding sources fears of a wave of corporate
bankruptcies spread. Intervention was deemed necessary by the Federal Reserve and
took the form of suspension of interest rate ceilings on banks' certificate of deposits

and notification that the discount window was available for banks needing reserves to
extend loans to companies. No other commercial paper issuer defaulted thereafter.
After the Penn Central crisis, companies routinely arranged back-up lines of credit
at banks, which they could rely on during times when the commercial paper market
turned unreceptive. This greatly enhanced funding stability. For example, during
the Russian/LTCM crisis in 1998 and the Enron/Worldcom crisis in 2002 there were
again rollover problems in the market for nonfinancial CP. However, during these
episodes US non-financial firms were able to switch between markets and backup
lines of credit with banks. Moreover, banks experienced larger inflows of funds -
possibly from investors fleeing financial markets - just when firms unable to access
capital markets drew down backup lines of credit (see Gatev and Strahan (2006)).
Thus, banks helped intermediate liquidity back into the system.
In this paper I focus on the market for nonfinancial commercial paper and on
firms' debt maturity choice. Interestingly, despite rollover risk CP (in combination
with backstop liquidity facilities) has remained an important funding source for top-
rated corporate borrowers. Given the episodes described, two important questions
appear to be particularly important. First, given that only firms with virtually
no default risk have access to the nonfinancial CP market why are they sometimes
denied credit? Second, why are banks willing to supply funding to (at least some)
firms when direct investors deny credit? It is important to note that backup lines of
credit usually contain 'material adverse change' clauses which allow banks to cancel
credit lines if the financial condition of a the would-be borrowing firm significantly
changes. This implies that banks do not extend credit in adverse times because
they are willing to hold higher credit risk. For backup lines to be of any use to the
borrower it must hence be the case that banks at times come to different conclusions
about a firms' credit risk than direct investors do. Furthermore, it is important to
note that - unlike deposit insurance in the case of banks - backup lines of credit
have not prevented the CP market from drying up at times.2 This may suggest
2For simplicity, nonfinancial commercial paper is henceforth referred to only as 'commercial
2

that rollover crises in the CP market are not the result of a coordination problem
(i.e. a 'panic' equilibrium) among dispersed investors but instead are driven by
fundamentals.
In contrast to today's observed borrowing arrangements by top quality firms most
models that explain the choice of firms between bank loans and publicly traded debt
ignore contingent bank lending. Instead, these models claim that firms either choose
bank loans or issue bonds (e.g. Bolton and Freixas (2000), Holmstr¨
om and Tirole
(1997), Chemmanur and Fulghieri (1994)). Though banks are seen to be particularly
good at helping borrowers through times of financial difficulties, banking finance is
assumed more costly than direct finance. Hence, according to these models firms
with a low probability of financial distress prefer to tap the bond markets and refrain
from bank borrowing at all times. Why then do we observe contingent bank lending
in the form of backup liquidity facilities that nowadays almost always accompany
CP programs? The higher costs of using banking finance should be reflected in any
fee banks charge for providing backup liquidity facilities and hence should ultimately
be borne by firms. Does this not counteract the advantage of using short-term direct
finance? Why does the firm not get rid of these costs and the maturity mismatch
that gives rise to rollover risk by simply issuing a long-term bond?3
This paper presents a model in which asymmetric information between investors
and the firm only matters in some states of the business cycle. More specifically, I
assume that in normal times information about firm quality is broadly symmetric.
Having a relationship with a bank is not particularly important for high quality firms
in these times as direct lenders will be willing to provide funding. However, during a
recession only some firms are hit by a shock that makes their prospects deteriorate.
Information about the impact of a shock is however asymmetric. Whereas the firm
paper.'
3Indeed, as Calomiris, Himmelberg, and Wachtel (1995) point out, though CP has a short-term
maturity, it is not only used to finance short-term needs. Nonfinancial firms indeed often use CP
as financing for capital expenditures and roll it over continuously or until alternative financing is
found.

knows whether it has been hit, direct investors do not. Direct investors are hence
unable to sort out firms whose prospects have deteriorated substantially from those
that have not. As a consequence, they are unwilling to renew lending even to high
quality firms. By contrast, a bank is assumed to gain private information about
borrowers when it commits to lend to the firm on a contingent basis. This enables
the bank to sort out high quality firms during times of recession and renew lending
to these firms.
However, because of screening costs banking finance is more expensive than di-
rect finance. It thus never makes sense for high quality firms to use intermediated
finance during normal times when asymmetric information does not affect outcomes.
By setting up a financing arrangement whereby the firm borrows from short-term
direct investors during normal times and switches to banking finance in case of reces-
sion the firm minimizes intermediation costs while still enjoying the benefit of being
refinanced in bad times. Provided there is a sufficient degree of asymmetric infor-
mation between direct investors and the firm and intermediation costs are not too
high the firm may actually prefer this financing arrangement over issuing long-term
direct debt. This is so because the firm has to compensate LT direct investors for
the potential agency problem at the intermediate stage which might be more costly
than using short-term finance together with a backup line of credit. Furthermore,
if the cost of using banking finance falls with a higher credit rating it is possible
to derive theoretical results about firms' debt maturity choice which are broadly
consistent with observed practice. Top quality firms are able and willing to issue
commercial paper and secure a backup line of credit. Firms with a slightly lower
rating issue long-term direct debt and firms with a still lower rating are restricted to
borrow short-term. These latter firms will always be liquidated during bad times.
There is empirical evidence that maturity mismatch and liquidity risk are real
concerns for firms and that it affects their choice of debt maturity. In a survey among
financial executives Graham and Harvey (2001) report that the two most important
factors affecting firms' debt maturity choice were "matching the maturity of debt
4
4
with the life of assets" and "the cost of refinancing in bad times" - much in line with
the proposed model.
The paper adds to the theoretical literature concerned with the coexistence of
bank lending and direct lending, most notably, Bolton and Freixas (2000), Boot and
Thakor (1997), Chemmanur and Fulghieri (1994), Holmstr¨
om and Tirole (1997), and
Repullo and Suarez (1998). The main contribution to this literature is to view the
choice of top quality firms between direct and intermediated debt as dependent on
the aggregate state of the economy rather than a static, one-off choice. Empirically,
the fact that banks often experience an increase in asset growth due to a drawdown
of credit lines by firms unable to tap CP markets has recently been documented by
some authors (e.g. Gatev and Strahan (2006)).
Finally, there are some papers concerned with firms' debt maturity choice. Most
notably, in Diamond (1991) firms with a higher credit rating use more short-term
debt than firms with lower credit ratings. The reason is that a firm's insiders have
information about the firm's default risk that is superior to that of its creditors.
This is a problem for a firm that is truly more creditworthy than other firms. Unless
it can find some way to signal its private information, it will end up borrowing at
too high a rate. Diamond argues that one possible way for the low-risk firm to lower
its borrowing costs is to shorten its debt maturity since private information will
gradually become more public in the course of time. My model also stresses a firm's
concern about being pooled with lower quality borrowers. However, the reason for
the firm being concerned is that it fears not being refinanced in case of recession.
The paper is organized as follows: Section II outlines the model. Section III
derives the optimal mode of financing for firms without (publicly observable) credit
risk. Section IV introduces publicly observable credit risk and derives a firm's debt
maturity choice as a function of its rating. Section V discusses comparative static
results. Finally, Section VI offers some conclusions.

2 The Model
Consider an economy with three types of risk-neutral agents: firms, banks and
direct investors. All agents are protected by limited liability. Firms are run by
entrepreneurs who do not have any initial wealth and therefore need to raise outside
funds for investment by selling bonds to direct investors or by obtaining bank loans.
All contracts are thus restricted to be debt contracts.
2.1 Firms' Projects
There are three dates (t = 0, 1, 2) in the economy and a continuum of firms. Each
firm (entrepreneur) has the opportunity of undertaking a project that requires an
investment of 1 at t = 0 and pays off a return at t = 2. Firms differ in the way their
projects are affected by the state of the economy which is revealed at t = 1 after the
initial investment has been made, but before any short-term loans are rolled over.
With probability  the economy is in a good state and the return of each project in
the economy is H. With probability 1 -  a recession occurs which affects some
firms in the economy in such a way that their projects return only L (L
< H)
at t = 2 subject to continuation. All other projects are unaffected by the recession
and still return H.
If instead of being continued a project is liquidated at t = 1 it yields a liquidation
value of AH if it is a firm with a high cash flow realization in a recession or AL if it
is a firm with a low cash flow realization in a recession. Firms are labelled according
to their return in recessions (alternatively, their liquidation value at t = 1): 'Good'
firms return H (and have a liquidation value of AH), whereas 'bad' firms only return
L (and have a liquidation value of AL). Regardless of their project's observable
return firms (entrepreneurs) receive a non-transferable private benefit B > 0 at date
t = 2 provided the firm is not liquidated. I assume that H
> AH
> 1 > AL
>
L +B > 0 which implies - inter alia - that neither from a lender's nor from a social
point of view does it make sense to finance a bad firm, i.e. (H +B)+(1-)AL
< 1.
6
6
However, the presence of the non-transferable private benefit makes bad firms want
to get financing since they are able to gain B in the good state while they cannot
lose anything in the bad state (limited liability). This is similar to Holmstr¨
om and
Tirole (1997).
As in Bolton and Freixas (2000) firms differ in the probability pR of having a
high cash flow realization at date t = 2 in case of recession (or, if abandoned, a
high liquidation value at date t = 1). The range of possible values for pR is simply
{0, 1}. Agents are assumed to have different information about the value of pR. More
specifically, I assume that pR is information private to the firm at date t = 0 and may
be revealed to a bank at date t = 1 but only if the bank engaged in a relationship
with the firm at date t = 0. A relationship here involves regular visits with the firm
to learn about its business and possibly to get access to private information. A bank
and a firm only engage in a relationship at t = 0 if the bank either provides outright
funding at t = 0 or commits to provide funding on a contingent basis at t = 1. For
direct investors or banks that did not engage in a relationship, pR is revealed at
date t = 1 only if the firm is liquidated. By contrast, in case of continuation these
investors learn firms' type not before t = 2 . At date t = 0 lenders' prior belief about
the value of pR is pR = 1 with probability  and pR = 0 with probability 1 -  so
that E[pR] = .
[Figure 1 about here.]
To make matters interesting, I further make the following assumption:
H + (1 - )L
< 1  AH + (1 - )AL (1)
i.e. the continuation value of a firm of unknown type is less than 1 which in turn
is less than the firm's liquidation value. This assumption is equivalent to lenders'
prior belief about a given firm's type, , lying within the range (, ¯
) defined by
 = 1-AL
AH
-AL
and ¯
 = 1-L
H
-L
. It implies that given a recession a short-term investor
not knowing a firm's type will always liquidate the firm instead of rolling over its
7
7
debt and waiting until t = 2 for project returns to realize.4 If the continuation
value of the firm was greater or equal to 1, there would always be an investor willing
to extend a loan of size 1 at date 1 to a firm of unknown type. Hence maturing
short-term debt would always be refinanced. Lending between dates 0 and 1 would
then be riskless and the interest rate in this period would equal the direct investor's
opportunity cost of capital, which is 1. If the continuation value was greater than
its liquidation value the firm's debt would be rolled over in a recession since initial
investors in the firm would fare better than if they liquidated the firm. However,
the liquidation decision under direct (uninformed) finance is not socially optimal ex
post. Instead, it would be optimal to liquidate bad projects (as L + B < AL) but
to continue good projects (as H + B > AH).
It is important to note that the presence of (non-discriminable) good firms en-
ables bad firms to receive funding at all. A bad firm therefore never wants to signal
its type to an investor and always wants to mimic a good firm, for otherwise it would
not be able to carry out its project and receive the private benefit B.
2.2 Financing Options
Firms have the possibility of financing a project either by using direct finance or by
using intermediated (banking) finance or a combination of the two. These financing
options differ in the costs/benefits they offer to firms.
Under direct finance firms simply have to offer the opportunity cost of capital
(in expected value terms), i.e. the gross market rate of return, which is normalized
to 1. Direct investors never screen firms because they do not have the expertise
to generate valuable information. By contrast, banks, engage in costly screening
activity whenever they extend a loan which enables them to determine a given
4Note that the above assumption is somewhat stronger than necessary to guarantee liquidation
during a recession. In fact, for short-term debt not to be rolled it is sufficient that H

<
1 and H
+ (1 - )L
< AH
+ (1 - )AL
. However, to facilitate the ongoing analysis I will stick
to the stronger assumption.

firm's type. Banks may actually determine the firm's type before extending the
loan.5 However, to be able to do so they need to have some prior relationship
with the firm. For simplicity, the bank's one-off screening cost c  0 is taken to
be exogenous. Extending a bank loan of amount 1 at date t = i thus leads to a
minimum repayment of 1 + c at date t = i + 1.
2.3 State-Contingent Contracts
As in Bolton and Freixas (2000) I first consider, as a benchmark, the financing choice
of a firm that is able to offer state-contingent returns to investors, i.e. returns that
depend on the aggregate state of the economy and the firm's type. I will just con-
sider the contracting problem of a good firm that knows that every contract it offers
will be mimicked by a bad firm. Any deviation by the bad firm would reveal its type
and would make borrowing impossible. There is hence no possibility in the model
for the good firm to escape this pooling equilibrium.
Direct lending. The contracting problem of a good firm that is able to obtain
financing from uninformed investors only is to offer state-contingent returns {RN

RR
1H
, RR

, RR

} so as to maximize its total surplus, where RN

is the date 2
return in normal times and RR
1H
, RR
1L
and RR
2H
, RR
2L
are the date 1 and 2 returns in
a recession dependent on the firm being good or bad, respectively. Quite crucially,
the firm also has to decide whether it wants its project to be liquidated in case of
recession or not. Let x  {0, 1} be the firm's decision variable which is equal to 1 if
it wants to continue its project during a recession and 0 otherwise. The good firm
then sets state-contingent returns and x to solve

 AH, RR
1L
 AL, RR

 H, RR
2L
 L. It is quite obvious
that the good firm will set RR
1L
= AL, RR
2L
= L, and RN
2
= H. The good firm
will pledge the highest amounts possible in case of being revealed a bad firm during
a recession, as it will never have to pay these amounts anyway. Moreover, the firm
prefers repayment in normal times as it has to compensate investors for asymmetric
information only during recessionary episodes. Hence, it will set RN
2
equal to the
maximum amount possible, H.6 The good firm's repayment in a recession now
depends on its decision whether or not to continue its project. In each case it will
set the amount, RR
1H
or RR
2H
, equal to the lowest value satisfying the constraint
(equation 3). Therefore, for x = 1 the good firm's repayment in case of recession is
given by
RR
2H
=
1 - H
- (1 - )(1 - )L
(1 - )
. (4)
By contrast, if the firm chooses not to continue its project during a recession (i.e.
x = 0) its repayment is given by
RR
1H
=
1 - H
- (1 - )(1 - )AL
(1 - )
. (5)
As AL
> L the amount the firm has to pay in a recession is lower if the project is
liquidated. However, in this case the firm loses its private benefit B. Quite clearly,
whether or not the firm wants its project to be completed in bad times, i.e. whether
x = 1 or x = 0, depends on the magnitude of B. If B is 'small' the firm may actually

Assume that B is sufficiently high so that continuation in a recession is actually
preferred. It is then possible to determine the extra cost the firm has to pay in a

state does not matter to the firm. However, pledging 1 unit less in the good state while pledging
/[(1 - )] in the bad state with 0 <  < 1, which would not matter to the investor, is clearly less
favorable to the firm. Hence, the firm will choose maximum repayment in normal times.

and bad firms (henceforth denoted 'asymmetric information cost'). Let RR

be the return the good firm has to pledge in the full information case. Then the
asymmetric information cost under direct lending is given by

Note that H + (1 - )L is the return that each firm (independent of its type
and the state of the economy) is able to pay with certainty, i.e. this is the portion
of the cash flow on which there is no asymmetric information. For a firm to finance
its project, however, it must raise additional capital of 1 - (H + (1 - )L) > 0
at date t = 0. In the full information case the good firm would simply promise to
repay 1

[1 - (H + (1 - )L)] in the recessionary state to ensure financing. By
contrast, under asymmetric information the good firm has to incur an additional
cost of 1-

per unit pledged in the recessionary state.8
Banking finance. In contrast to direct investors, a bank that extends a loan at
date t = 0 and thereby engages in screening activity is able to distinguish between
good and bad firms at date t = 1. Of course, screening is only valuable if a reces-
sion occurs with some positive probability. Given the assumptions about screening
costs the maximization problem the firm faces when it only relies on bank lending
is to offer 1) state-contingent returns {RN

Note that the asymmetric information cost under bank lending may actually be
lower than under direct lending provided the extra cost of banking finance is lower
than its expected benefit, i.e. c < (1 - )[AL
- L].
However, if the firm's private benefit B is low and the firm actually prefers being
liquidated in a recession under direct finance, the asymmetric information cost under
bank lending will be indisputably higher as c > 0. Nonetheless, as the good firm's
project has a higher continuation than liquidation value (i.e. H + B > AH) the
firm may still decide to use banking finance. More specifically, the firm will borrow
from banks whenever9
1

c < (1 - )(H + B - AH). (12)
The right-hand side of the inequality is the expected benefit of using banking finance.
Quite intuitively, this is the difference between the continuation value and the liqui-
dation value of the good project (in expected value terms). The left-hand side is the
expected extra cost of bank lending. Note that this is more than the bank's screen-
ing cost as  < 1. More specifically, it also encompasses the difference in expected

In practice, the state-contingent contracts discussed do not exist. One reason might
be that the recessionary state of the economy is difficult to verify by judges. In fact,
standard debt contracts do not make repayments dependent on the aggregate state
of the economy nor let they firms generate observable profits only during recessions.
Nonetheless, note that the theoretical results developed here are somewhat in line
with responses to the survey by Graham and Harvey (2001). In particular, in the
survey financial executives cited the 'cost of refinancing in bad times' as the second
most important factor affecting their debt maturity choice. Refinancing in bad times
should be more expensive (or even not possible) because a good firm would have to
compensate investors for being unable to distinguish it from bad firms. Similarly, in
the previous discussion good firms wanted to avoid repayment in bad times as they
would have to compensate investors for information being asymmetric.
3 Firms' Choice among Standard Debt Instruments
In this section I focus on standard debt instruments where the firm's repayment
does not depend on the state of the economy. More specifically, the firm can now
choose between issuing long-term bonds or short-term bonds, using banking finance
or issuing commercial paper together with securing a backup line of credit.
Long-term bonds. For the firm to issue long-term bonds it has to ensure that
direct investors' expected return is at least equal to their opportunity cost of pro-
viding finance, i.e.
RLT + (1 - )[RLT
H
+ (1 - )L] = 1 (14)
10This is (1 - ) 1-

1
1-
c .
13
13
or
RLT =
1 - (1 - )(1 - )L
 + (1 - )
(15)
where RLT is the long-term (gross) interest rate. Note that RLT > 1 as long as
 < 1, i.e. as long as there is asymmetric information present (otherwise, very intu-
itively, RLT = 1). In addition, for RLT > 1 there must be a positive probability of
a recession occurring for otherwise the return of all firms would be H with certainty.
Short-term bonds. With short-term bonds investors are given the opportunity to
rethink their investment decision at t = 1 upon the arrival of new information, i.e.
they are effectively given an option to liquidate the firm at this date. Due to the
underlying assumptions11 short-term debt will never be rolled over at t = 1 since in
the presence of asymmetric information the investor is always better off liquidating
the firm. In order to determine the short-term interest rates first note that the
interest rate between dates 1 and 2 in the good state, RST
2
, must be 1 as there is
no credit risk in this period. Hence the interest rate between dates 0 and 1, RST
1
, is
given by

< RLT , provided there is asymmetric
information ( < 1). There is thus a very simple explanation for the long-term
interest rate being higher than the short-term interest rate. The long-term investor
has to be compensated for a lower profit outcome at date t = 2 in case of continuation
during a recession. Note that the difference between the long-term and the short-
term interest rate increases with  falling (i.e. (RLT - RST )/ < 0). This means

12For RST

14
14
that the higher the degree of asymmetric information, the wider the interest rate
spread.
For ST finance to be actually preferred by a good firm it is necessary that the
cost of using LT debt outweighs its benefit, i.e. RLT -RST > (1-)[H +B -AH].
Plugging the derived values for RST , RLT into this inequality we get13
 <  =
AL
- L
- (H + B - AH)
AL
- L + (1 - )(H + B - AH)
< 1. (18)
Banking. A bank that extended a loan at t = 0 and engaged in screening ac-
tivity is assumed to know a given firm's type at date t = 1. A bank is therefore
able to make the right continuation versus liquidation decision, i.e. it liquidates bad
firms and continues good firms. The interest rate on bank lending is therefore given
by
RB =
1 + c - (1 - )(1 - )AL
 + (1 - )
(19)
For pure banking finance to have a potential role, it must be that RB < RLT .
Otherwise the good firm would always be able to complete its project at lower cost.
This is equivalent to
c < (1 - )(1 - )(AL
- L) (20)
which means that the extra cost of bank lending (i.e. the screening cost) has to be
lower than the extra benefit of using it.
However, given that direct investors are always willing to extent credit between
dates 0 and 1, bank borrowing (and screening) is actually not needed during this
period. Banking finance may be needed at t = 1 in case of recession when direct
investors are unwilling to roll over short-term loans. As a prerequisite for lending
at this stage, however, the bank needs to verify in a timely manner that the firm is
of good type. As has been pointed out, this is only possible if the bank engaged in

).
15
15
a relationship at t = 0 with the firm, such as a commitment to lend on a contingent
basis in return for a fee. For firms, lending on a contingent basis may be an attrac-
tive option as they only need to compensate banks for screening in the recessionary
state and not for screening in the good state when it is actually not needed.
Mixed finance: Commercial Paper and Backup Line of Credit. If banking
is not too costly and the firm is given the option it might use direct finance in nor-
mal, i.e. non-recessionary, states of the economy and banking finance in recessionary
states. However, for banking finance to actually play a superior role in recessionary
states banks in the model have to commit to lend on a contingent basis, thereby
engaging in a relationship with the firm at t = 0.
In practice, most commercial paper issuers maintain backup liquidity through
bank lines of credit. These are often being structured as multi-year revolver agree-
ments in which a bank commits to loan funds to a firm on demand at a floating base
rate that is tied to the prime rate, LIBOR rate, or certificate of deposit rate. As com-
pensation, the bank receives various fees from the firm. In particular, banks often
receive a commitment fee that is a percentage of the unused credit line.14 In what
follows I will look at this financing arrangement in the context of the stated model.
For simplicity, I assume that the firm either uses the total amount of the funds
committed by the bank or nothing at all. Furthermore, the (gross) rate charged in
case of recession is assumed to equal the rate charged under direct finance (which
was normalized to 1).
The commitment fee F that the bank requires the firm to pay is then given by
F + (1 - )[ + (1 - )AL
- (1 + c)] = 0 (21)
or
F =
(1 - )[1 + c - (1 - )AL
- ]

. (22)
14Alternatively, the firm pays a facility fee that is a percentage of the credit line and is paid
whether or not the line is activated.
16
16
The expected total cost for the firm to finance its project now becomes (1 - )[1 +
c - (1 - )AL
- ] + 1. Note that the good firm's project will now be refinanced at
t = 1 with certainty.
Proposition 1: Faced with different financing options, a good firm that wants
to continue its project in case of recession will prefer using mixed finance to issuing
long-term bonds whenever the degree of asymmetric information is sufficiently high.
Proof: See the appendix.
Note that if there was no asymmetric information in the economy, the good
firm would always prefer to issue long-term debt as long as using banking finance is
more costly, i.e. as long as c > 0. Interestingly, the good firm's payment in normal
times, i.e. 1 + F, is higher than its payment in bad times which simply equals 1.
With this form of financing the firm therefore comes closer to the optimal financing
arrangement in the state contingent contract case.
4 Publicly observable Credit Risk
The preceding section focused on firms with projects that are riskless in normal
times. In this section I broaden the analysis to include firms that differ in the
observable riskiness of their projects.15 More specifically, projects now generate a
verifiable return H at t = 2 with probability p (and L with probability 1 - p)
subject to continuation at t = 1.16 The success probability p is publicly observable
and can be thought of as a credit rating. Projects again generate a private benefit
B > 0, which entrepreneurs obtain at t = 2 if the firm is not liquidated.
Firms within a given risk class (defined by p) differ in the way their projects are

16Obviously, the previous section can be considered a special case with p = 1 in this more general
setting.
17
17
affected by a recession. Some projects are unaffected and still return pH +(1-p)L
in expected value terms whereas others return only L at t = 2 with certainty. The
probability pR
{0, 1} of the firm's project being affected by a recession is again
information private to the firm at t = 0 and revealed to a bank at t = 1 only if the
bank set up a relationship with the firm at t = 0. Direct investors or banks without
a relationship learn about the firm's type at t = 1 only if the firm is liquidated.
Quite intuitively, the liquidation value of a good firm - like the expected return at
date 2 - now depends on the firm's credit rating and is given by A(p) = pAH. By
contrast, the liquidation value of a bad firm, AL, is for simplicity assumed to be
independent of the firm's credit rating.17
As in the previous section, lenders believe that a given firm is of type pR = 1
with probability  and pR = 0 with probability 1- so that E[pR] = .18 To simplify
the ongoing analysis I will further set L = 0.
[Figure 2 about here.]
4.1 Financing Options
Long-term direct finance. When buying long-term debt investors have to wait
until date 2 to realize returns and hence do not have the opportunity to react to
new information being revealed at date 1. Direct investors are therefore willing to
provide long-term finance as long as
pRLT (p) + (1 - )pRLT (p) = 1 (23)
17A(p) = pAH
also ensures that good firms with a low success probability do not get funding just
because they will be liquidated at t = 1. Making the liquidation value of bad firms also dependent
on the credit rating unnecessarily burdens the analysis.
18For simplicity I assume that lenders' prior belief about the value of pR
is independent of the
firm's credit rating. Firms with a lower credit rating may well have a higher proportion of firms
affected by a recession, in which case  would be a decreasing function of p. However, this unnec-
essarily burdens the analysis.
18
18
or
RLT (p) =
1
p[ + (1 - )]
(24)
where RLT (p) < H is the long-term interest rate. The required repayment in
case of success is thus determined by the firm's credit rating p and, as before, the
degree of asymmetric information  and the probability of the economy being in
a good state . A higher credit rating, less asymmetric information, and a higher
probability of a good state all lead to a lower individual interest rate.
The expected repayment of a good firm (i.e. one whose project return will be
unaffected by a recession) is then given by
pRLT (p) =
1
 + (1 - )
(25)
which is greater than 1 whenever information is asymmetric ( < 1) and equal to 1
whenever information is symmetric ( = 1). Good firms' expected repayment under
asymmetric information surpasses investors' investment contribution because they
have to cross-subsidize bad firms whose expected repayment is less than 1. Bad
firms always imitate good firms because otherwise they would not receive funding
and would thus be unable to receive the private benefit B.
Short-term direct finance. By lending short-term the investor is given the oppor-
tunity to rethink his investment decision at t = 1 upon the arrival of new information,
i.e. he is given the option to liquidate a firm's project. Under certain assumptions
about the degree of asymmetric information being present the investor will exercise
his liquidation option whenever the economy is in a recession and abstain from doing
so whenever it is in a good state.
Proposition 2: An uninformed investor who provided short-term funding to a
firm at t = 0 will always roll over the firm's debt at t = 1 when the economy
is in a good state. He will not roll over the firm's debt when the economy is in

Proof: See the appendix.
In what follows I assume that asymmetric information is sufficiently high so that
uninformed short-term investors will not roll over the firm's debt in a recession. In
the context of the model the short-term interest rate between dates 1 and 2, RST
2
(p),
is then simply 1/p as lending in this period only takes place in the good state of
the economy and the firm's interest rate is determined by its individual success
probability. The short-term interest rate between dates 0 and 1, RST
1
(p), is then
implicitly defined by
pRST

2
(p) + (1 - )[ min{RST

(p) as long as this is less or equal to the firm's liquidation value pAH.
For RST
1
(p) > pAH the firm just pays back its liquidation value. The interest rate
therefore displays a kink at the critical probability level pk defined by RST
1
(p) =
pkAH. More specifically, the short-term interest rate between dates 0 and 1 for
different values of the firm's credit rating p is given by

is the probability value at which the short-term interest
rate displays a kink and pST = 1-(1-)(1-)AL
H +(1-)AH
is the critical value below which
investors are unwilling to lend short-term.19 It is obvious that pST < pk as H

19The maximum repayment a firm is able to offer over the two periods is H
so that the minimum

(pST ).
Note that the good firm actually has two short-term interest options to choose from as long as
20
20
so that the short-term interest rate will always exhibit a kink for the relevant range
of p.
Provided an investor receives a higher return during a recession by liquidating a
firm's project, the long-term interest rate lies above the cumulative short-term rate
over two periods. Quite intuitively, the firm has to compensate investors for a lower
profit outcome in case of continuation in the bad state by pledging a higher return
in the good state.
Lemma 1: As long as it is optimal for a short-term investor to liquidate a firm
during a recession, the cumulative short-term interest rate over two periods lies be-
low the long-term rate for all firms with credit rating p > pLT .
Proof: See the appendix.
Note that for the short-term rate to lie below the long-term rate it is crucial that
there is a sufficiently high degree of asymmetric information. If information were
symmetric (or marginally asymmetric) an investor would always roll over a firm's
debt in a recession. Hence, in this case the short-term rate would equal the long-
term rate. From the discussion above it should also be clear that there are some
firms with credit rating p < pLT for which short-term borrowing is the only available
financing option. Since at pLT the short-term interest rate is strictly less than the
maximum pledgeable income in the good state (which is H) by continuity there
are some firms with credit rating p < pLT (and p > pST ) that can pledge enough
income to secure short-term financing. Quite crucially, these firms are restricted to
borrow short-term and cannot borrow long-term. By contrast, firms with success
probability p > pLT can choose between long-term and short-term borrowing.
RST

(p) < pAH
: It may pay the same return in the good and the bad state of the economy or it
may pledge its full liquidation value in the bad state and pay a lower return in the good state. It
is easy to verify that the firm always prefers the first option and pays the same return in the good
and the bad state whenever this is possible.
21
21
In what follows I assume that all firms that have the option to choose between
the two financing modes prefer long-term financing. In effect, this means that the
utility of using LT finance outweighs the utility of using ST finance for all firms with
credit rating p > pLT or
p[H
- RLT (p)] + B > [pH
- RST
1
(p) + B] (28)

p[H
- RLT (p)] + B > [p(H
- RST (p)) + B] + (1 - )[pAH
- RST
1
(p)] (29)
for all p > pk.20 This basically means that the private benefit B that firms receive
at t = 2 in case of project continuation is large enough to make them choose the
long-term financing option whenever this is possible. By inspection, it is obvious
that there always exists such a B so that all firms prefer the long-term option.
CP + Backup line of credit. Instead of long-term finance the firm may use
short-term direct finance together with a backup line of credit. The important
thing to keep in mind is that backup lines of credit are not credit enhancements.
If a company goes bankrupt, the bank will not pay off its maturing CP. They are
therefore not an insurance against a deterioration in the firm's credit quality but
an insurance against a rollover crisis in the CP market. If the CP market dries up,
a backup line allows an issuer whose credit quality has not changed to substitute
bank borrowing for CP borrowing. For backup lines to play any role it must there-
fore be that information becomes symmetric between banks and firms at t = 2 but
remains asymmetric between direct investors and firms (otherwise direct investors
would always refinance good firms). However, note that information between banks
and firms cannot already be symmetric at t = 1. Otherwise by offering credit only
to good firms on slightly more attractive terms than direct investors banks would

equation is higher than the RHS of the first equation for all p < pk.

capture all good firms while bad firms would turn to direct finance. Under these
circumstances, the market for direct debt would break down.
Whenever there is a recession a bank that has committed to a backup line thus
pays direct investors the firm's promised short-term rate RST
1
(p) at t = 1 if the firm
has been identified as good. Whenever the firm is revealed as bad banks invoke the
'material adverse change clause'. The investor is then left with the firm's liquidation
value AL. Implicitly, I assume that enforceability of contracts is not an issue. The
bank always refinances a good firm in a recession even if it will make a loss. In the
context of the model this is quite plausible as every firm can be perfectly identified
after either liquidation or continuation and thus every breach of contract is publicly
observable.
The uninformed short-term investor's required return is then given by:
RST
1
+ (1 - )[RST
1
+ (1 - )AL] = 1 (30)
or
RST
1
=
1 - (1 - )(1 - )AL
 + (1 - ).
(31)
By comparison, this is simply the short-term interest rate between dates 0 and 1
that applies to all firms with credit rating p > pk. However, in the present case this
interest rate may even apply to firms with a credit rating below pk as good firms'
projects will always be continued and their maximum repayment in a recession will
therefore be higher than their liquidation value pAH. The maximum interest rate
(or lowest credit rating for which short-term finance together with a backup line is
still available) is now determined by what the firm can pay in the good state taking
into account the fee it has to pay for the backup line of credit. In the context of the
model the firm always prefers a commitment fee that is a percentage of the unused
credit line to a facility fee that is a percentage of the credit line and is paid whether
or not the line is activated.21 This is so because the firm wants to avoid asymmetric
information costs that it has to pay during a recession. For simplicity, I assume that
21Of course, a firm that is unable to pay the full commitment fee (plus the short-term interest rate
23
23
the firm either uses the total amount of the funds committed by the bank or nothing
at all.
Quite crucially, banks' screening costs are now assumed to be decreasing in the
firm's probability of success p, i.e. c(p) = c + 1 - p.22 Screening costs may actually
be lower for higher rated companies as these firms are often active in more mature
industries and often have more transparent business models. Banks therefore may
find it less costly to determine whether or not these firms' prospects have been
severely impacted by an impending recession.
Given that bank borrowing costs are decreasing in p, the commitment fee that
the bank charges in the good state is defined by
F(p) + (1 - )  RST

.
In the good state the bank receives the commitment fee F(p) at t = 1 from all
firms whose projects have been successful, independent of whether the particular
firm is good or bad.23 In a recession the bank receives the cumulative short-term
interest rate at t = 2 only from good firms with successful projects. In this state of
the economy, the bank pays direct investors who invested in a good firm the short-
term interest rate at t = 1 for which it incurs total costs of 1 + c(p) per unit at
t = 2.
between dates 0 and 1 and both multiplied by 1/p) may, in principle, prefer paying some fee also in
the bad state to issuing long-term direct debt. However, for a sufficiently high cost of using banking
finance firms with a credit rating that would permit both sorts of finance nonetheless prefer direct
debt. Hence the assumption that firms may only pay a commitment fee is not overly restrictive in
the context of the model.
22Obviously, for p = 1 the screening cost is simply c, as in the previous section when there was
no publicly observable credit risk on the part of the firm.
23One may think of a firm taking up another short-term loan at t = 1 of size F(p) and promising
to repay 1/p · F(p) at t = 2.
24
24
Firms are able to issue commercial paper and secure a backup line of credit as
long as their required repayment at t = 2 is less or equal to the maximum amount
they can pledge, i.e. H. The lowest credit rating for which this financing option is

It is obvious that banking must not be too costly for otherwise no firm would be able
to finance itself by issuing CP and securing a backup line of credit.24 Furthermore,
firms that are able to choose this financing form are also able to choose long-term
direct finance.
Lemma 2: Provided that H is large enough, firms with a credit rating that allows
for CP + CL financing are also able to use long-term direct finance, i.e. pCP > pLT .
Proof: See the appendix.
From this it is obvious that there may be some firms who would actually prefer
issuing CP together with securing a backup line but are, in fact, restricted to issue
long-term debt. However, it may also be the case that all firms prefer LT debt, even
those with virtually no default risk who are able to issue CP.
4.2 Firms' Choice between Long-term Direct Debt and CP with
Backup Line of Credit
Obviously, if bank lending did not entail extra costs, i.e. c(p) = 0, and information
was asymmetric, all firms with p > pCP would choose to issue commercial paper
24The upper limit for c so that only firms with the highest credit rating (i.e. p = 1) will choose
CP + CL can be derived by setting pCP = 1 in (35) and solving for c.

and secure a backup line of credit at t = 0 and switch to bank borrowing in case
of recession at t = 1.25 Their expected total cost would then be RST
1
(p) which is
strictly less than the expected total cost of issuing long-term direct debt, pRLT (p).
In fact, there would not even be a role for commercial paper as investors would be
equally well off borrowing from banks between dates 0 and 1.
By contrast, if bank borrowing did entail extra costs but information was sym-
metric, a good firm would never choose to issue CP and secure a backup line of
credit as it would be a costlier option without any extra benefit. However, the firm
would be indifferent between long-term and short-term direct finance (as short-term
finance would always be rolled over). By the same reasoning, if bank borrowing was
costless and information was symmetric, firms would be indifferent between all three
financing options.
As a consequence, for firms to prefer different long-term financing arrangements
information needs to be asymmetric and bank borrowing must entail extra costs.
Quite intuitively, when considering the two long-term options firms face a trade-off:
By using direct finance they incur asymmetric information costs but not bank bor-
rowing costs. By issuing CP plus a backup line of credit they incur bank borrowing
costs but possibly lower asymmetric information costs. As bank borrowing costs are
lower when a firm's success probability is higher, there is a critical credit rating above
which all firms prefer to issue CP together with securing a backup line of credit. To
determine this critical level note that firms prefer issuing CP together with securing
a backup line whenever their expected cost is lower than issuing long-term debt or
RST

+ F(p)  pRLT (36)
25If bank lending does not entail extra costs the commitment fee that the bank charges, F(p), is
zero, independent of the firm's credit rating. The lowest credit rating at which this financing option
is still possible is then less or equal to the lowest credit rating at which long-term direct finance is
possible, i.e. pCP = 1-(1-)(1-)AL

For some firms to actually choose this financing arrangement it is necessary that
these firms are both able and willing to issue CP and secure backup liquidity.
Proposition 3: For some c  0 there are some firms with credit rating p < 1
that choose to be financed by issuing CP together with securing a backup line of
credit.
Proof: See the appendix.
Given Lemma 2 and Proposition 3 the firm's theoretically derived debt maturity
choice - which is broadly consistent with observed practice - is illustrated in figure
3.
[Figure 3 about here.]
Firms of the highest credit quality choose to issue CP together with a backup line
of credit. Firms of slightly lower credit quality prefer (or are restricted) to issue
long-term bonds. Finally, firms of even lower credit quality are restricted to issue
short-term bonds.26 Note that the focus of the analysis has been firms with a credit
26One might wonder why bad firms with a high credit rating do not use short-term finance only
(without a backup line of credit). They would thereby be able to obtain the same effective financing
arrangement, i.e. short term finance in the first period and short term finance in the second period
if the economy is in a good state and no finance in the second period if the economy is in a bad
state. However, they would not have to pay the commitment fee for the provision of the backup
line of credit and would therefore be better off.
This is so because firms have to have a (publicly observable) credit rating to be able to tap public
debt markets. If a firm with a high rating wants to issue a short-term bond without securing a
backup line of credit it signals that it is a bad firm. But then it does not receive any financing at
all. It hence prefers to secure a backup line and to pool with good firms of the same high rating
category.

rating high enough to issue direct debt. In the context of the model, banks just have
a screening role. To explain bank lending for lower rated companies (below pST )
banks would also need to improve profitability somehow to make lending worthwhile.
5 Comparative Statics
The total volume of US nonfinancial firms' outstanding CP peaked at USD 351 bn
in November 2000 and declined by more than 70 percent until it reached a nadir
in December 2003. Since then the market has recovered strongly. However, as of
November 2007 outstanding CP remains about 50 percent below its peak in the fall of
2000. Relative to historical patterns, the decline has been unusually pronounced. As
documented by Shen (2003) in the previous five episodes of recession-related market
shrinkage, the largest reduction in volume outstanding was about 27 percent.
How may the model help to explain these developments? In general, the model
predicts that if the economy enters a recession short-term finance will not be rolled
over by direct investors. Firms with a low credit rating and bad firms with a high
credit rating will thus be liquidated during bad times. However, good firms with
a high rating are able to replace short-term direct finance with short-term bank
lending if they secured a backup line of credit ex ante. Overall, we should therefore
observe a decrease in short-term direct finance during recessions and an increase in
short-term bank lending ceteris paribus. However, besides cyclical factors structural
factors may also influence the amount of direct finance outstanding and may alter
the critical credit ratings at which firms choose different financing options. In what
follows I consider an increase in the probability that the economy is in the good
state (which for obvious reasons I call 'Great Moderation'). Furthermore, I will look
at how an increase in computing power and wider availability of information ('IT
Revolution') alters firms' debt maturity choice in the context of the model.
An increase in the probability of the economy being in the good state, , means
that the economy is less likely to enter a recession where some firms generate a
28
28
return of zero with certainty. Hence at any given credit rating a firm of unknown
type has a higher overall success probability. The interest rate for any given credit
rating should therefore be lower. However, it is then obvious that at the lowest
credit rating at which short-term direct finance was previously possible, the firm's
maximum pledgeable income, H, lies above the total interest the firm is expected
to pay over the two periods. Hence, a firm with a slightly lower credit rating will
still have enough pledgeable income to be financed via short-term direct debt. As
a consequence, a higher  will lead to an increase in direct lending to higher risk
firms (or equivalently to a lower pST ). What happens to the amount of CP issued
together with a backup line of credit? Certainly, the expected cost of this financ-
ing arrangement, RST
1
+ F(p), falls when  rises. But so does the expected cost
of long-term direct finance, pRLT . In fact, it turns out that the expected cost of
long-term direct finance falls even more strongly so that issuing CP together with a
credit line becomes less attractive and pCP

increases.
Proposition 4: If the economy becomes less likely to experience a recession, inter-
est rates and the bank's commitment fee for any given credit rating decline. More
firms are able to use direct finance, i.e. pST decreases, and fewer firms issue CP
together with securing a credit line ex ante, i.e. pCP

increases.
Proof: See the appendix.
I next turn to the impact of information becoming more easily available. This,
in particular, may be associated with lower costs of computing power, improved
software, and, above all, the better accessibility of information via the Internet. In
the context of the model, the 'IT revolution' may have affected two important pa-
rameters with different consequences for the total amount of direct finance being
issued and firms' choice of financing arrangements.
On the one hand, it may have lowered banks' screening costs, resulting in a
lower c, which, in turn, would have led to a lower cost of providing backup lines of
29
29
credit, F(p). More firms would then be able and willing to issue CP and secure a
backup line of credit. CP issuance should therefore have gone up over the last two
decades ceteris paribus. On the other hand, better accessibility of information at
lower cost should have made it easier for direct investors to identify bad firms. As
a consequence, the share of bad firms obtaining finance should have declined, or,
equivalently, information should have become more symmetric, i.e.  should have
increased. Ceteris paribus, an increase in  leads to more firms being able to obtain
direct finance and to more long-term direct finance being issued (partly at the ex-
pense of CP being issued together with a backup line of credit).
Proposition 5: If information becomes more symmetric, i.e.  increases, some
firms of lower credit quality that were previously denied credit are now able use di-
rect finance. Furthermore, more long-term direct finance and less CP will be issued.
Proof: See the appendix.
In sum, the model suggests that while there will always be a decrease in CP is-
suance during bad times, structural factors (e.g. a lower probability of a recession
and/or more symmetric information) may lead firms of the highest credit quality to
issue fewer CP even in good times. The reason is that the total cost for this long-
term financing arrangement (i.e. also taking into account the cost of the backup
line of credit) may not decrease as much as the cost of just issuing long-term direct
debt. These structural changes may therefore help to explain why the market for
nonfinancial CP has remained far below its former peak level despite a strong in-
crease in risk tolerance and a marked upturn in credit quality up until the summer
of 2007.

6 Discussion and Conclusion
The simple model developed here generates qualitative predictions about the equi-
librium in debt markets that appear broadly consistent with some stylized facts.
Firms of the highest credit quality issue commercial paper and secure backup lines
of credit ex ante. During periods when public credit markets prove unreceptive,
banks often experience an increase in asset growth due to a drawdown of credit lines
by firms as documented in Gatev and Strahan (2006). The model stresses that this is
part of intended financing arrangement whereby high quality firms use direct finance
during 'normal' times when asymmetric information between lenders and the firm
does not matter and use intermediated finance when asymmetric information does
matter. Short-term finance then provides the necessary flexibility to adjust to chang-
ing economic circumstances. In this sense, financial systems naturally become more
'bank-based' during recessionary episodes and more 'market-based' during normal
times.27
In practice, only firms of the highest credit quality opt for this financing ar-
rangement. Firms of slightly lower quality choose long-term direct finance instead.
The model claims that good firms of less than top quality prefer long-term direct
debt not because of the longer maturity since by issuing CP (and securing a backup
line) they are not at risk of refinancing either. Rather, for these firms contingent
bank lending becomes too expensive and therefore unattractive. Finally, firms of
still lower credit quality are restricted to borrow short-term since they do not have
enough pledgeable income to borrow long-term. Studies of large firms with access
to public securities markets support the view that a firm's debt maturity increases
as its credit rating falls, at least until its credit rating becomes speculative. They
also find that firms without a credit rating typically use more short-term debt.28
The model identifies structural factors that may explain why the nonfinancial
27This in a way differs from the widely held view that financial systems are either bank- or market
based.

commercial paper has shrunk since the start of the decade. In particular, better
accessibility of information ('IT revolution') may have led to information between
direct investors and the firm having become more symmetric. Furthermore, the
probability of recessions may have decreased ('Great Moderation'). Both factors
should have contributed to CP being a less attractive financing option today.
It should be noted that the model just focuses on firms on the lower end of
the credit risk spectrum, i.e. firms that have a credit rating and are able to tap
bond markets. More risky firms, by contrast, typically borrow from banks or from
finance companies rather than by selling bonds to the public. Banks may play quite
a different role for these borrowers. In particular, they may not just screen firms but
may also engage in close monitoring and may thereby lower individual credit risk.
Furthermore, the applicability of the model to other parts of the commercial
paper market appears somewhat limited. In particular, the rollover crisis in the
market for asset-backed commercial paper in the second half of 2007 appears difficult
to reconcile with the notion of an intended financing arrangement. Instead, banks
may have been overly optimistic about liquidity in this part of the commercial paper
in general. Or they may have used this financing arrangement to extend lending
without incurring a capital charge29 ('regulatory arbitrage') and relying on central
bank liquidity if liquidity demands prove too high ('moral hazard'). Further research
about this part of the CP market is certainly needed.
29Under Basel I banks do not have to hold capital against backup lines of credits.

7 Appendix
Proof of Proposition 1
For a good firm to issue CP along with securing a backup line of credit instead of
issuing long-term bonds it must be that the cost of long-term finance is higher than
the cost of mixed finance, i.e.
1 - (1 - )(1 - )L
 + (1 - )
= L +
1 - L
 + (1 - )
> (1-)[1+c-(1-)AL
-]+1 (38)
Solving for  we obtain:

(39)
or 2
< -
z
y

(40)
with x = 1 - L + (AL
- 1) + (1 - )(1 + c - AL), y = (1 - )(AL
- 1), and
z = 1 - L
- (1 + c - AL).
Note that for a solution we also require that either 1 or 2 lie in the interval
between 0 and 1. Since -x/2y > 1 the only possible solution to the inequality is
2. Define the critical level of asymmetric information by c = - z
y
+ x
2y

- x
2y
.
Then as long as  < c good firms will prefer to issue CP along with securing a
backup line of credit instead of issuing long-term bonds. Q.E.D.
Proof of Proposition 2
The first part follows straight from the firm's liquidation value function. Given that
the continuation value of a firm in the good state is pH, the sufficient condition
for an investor to roll over a firm's debt is30: pH
> pAH + (1 - )AL which is
equivalent to
p >
(1 - )AL
H
- AH
(41)
30It is not a necessary condition as a firm's project might be continued even if its continuation
value is below its liquidation value as long as the continuation value is  1.
33
33
Since the RHS of this inequality is a decreasing function of  we simply have to
prove that for  = 0 or p = AL
/H the firm is unable to get short-term funding.
We thereby insure that for all relevant values of p (i.e. those at which financing
takes place) the firm's continuation value is higher than its liquidation value. To
see this simply note that for p = AL
/H the continuation value of a firm in nor-
mal times is AL
H
H = AL
< 1 and the liquidation value of an unknown firm is
 AL
H
AH + (1 - )AL
< 1. Hence no matter whether he refinances or liquidates
the firm at the interim stage the investor is unable to recoup his initial investment.
He thus refrains from financing the firm at t = 0. Q.E.D.
To prove the second part it is necessary to show that in a recession the contin-
uation value of a firm of unknown type is 1) less than the initial investment re-
quired31, i.e. pH
< 1, and also 2) less than the firm's liquidation value, i.e.
pH
< pAH + (1 - )AL. It is easy to see that as long as   1/H condition
1) is fulfilled, regardless of the firm's credit rating p. Furthermore condition 2) is
fulfilled as long as
p <
(1 - )AL
(H
- AH)
. (42)
Hence, whenever   AL
H
-AH +AL
< 1 the firm's liquidation value is higher than its
continuation value, regardless of its credit rating. As a result, in a recession a firm of
unknown type will be liquidated whenever   min 1
H
, AL
H
-AH +AL
< 1. Q.E.D.
Proof of Lemma 1
For firms with credit ratings p > pk the cumulative short-term rate over two periods
lies below the long-term rate whenever
RST =
1 - (1 - )(1 - )AL
p[ + (1 - )]
<
1
p[ + (1 - )]
= RLT (43)
which is obviously true for all p.
31Otherwise the investor would always be able to recoup his initial investment contribution and
thus would never liquidate the project.
34
34
For firms with credit rating p, pLT < p < pk, the short-term interest rate is given
by RST = 1-(1-)(pAH +(1-)AL)
p
. Rewrite the investor's participation constraint for
providing long-term finance to get
RLT =
1 - (1 - )pRLT
p
. (44)
As pAH +(1-)AL
> pH
 pRLT for all   min 1
H
, AL
H
-AH +AL
the short
term interest rate lies below the long-term rate for all p with pLT < p < pk . Q.E.D.
Proof of Lemma 2
To see that issuing long-term direct finance is always possible for a firm able to issue
CP together with securing a backup line of credit provided that H is large enough
first note that if pCP > pLT for c = 0 then it also holds for c > 0. For c = 0 rewrite
pCP > pLT to get
H
-
1
 + (1 - )
>
(1 - )AL
[1 - (1 - )(1 - )AL]
. (45)
Now, assume that the above statement was not true. Then even for the largest pos-
sible value of H the inequality would not hold true. H is bounded above by the
'no rollover' condition, i.e. H
< 1. Setting H = 1

the above inequality simplifies
to AL
< 1 which is true by assumption. Hence, for H large enough pCP > pLT .
Q.E.D.
Proof of Proposition 3
To prove that under the given assumptions some firms will actually choose to be
financed via CP + CL, it is necessary to show that for some c > 0 1) some firms
with credit rating p < 1 are able to use CP + CL and 2) some firms with credit
rating p < 1 prefer using CP + CL to issuing long-term direct debt.
To prove the first part it is necessary to show that p
CP
< 1 for some c > 0 or
RST
1
+ 1-

(1 + c)RST
1
H + 1-

RST
1
< 1. (46)
35
35
For c = 0, it is obvious that this inequality holds true as RST
1
< H. However, then,
by continuity, it must also hold true for c slightly above 0. Q.E.D.
The second part is true as long as p
CP
< 1 or
1 + c -
(1 - )AL
[1 - (1 - )(1 - )AL]
< 1. (47)
Again, for c = 0, it is obvious that this inequality holds as long as AL
> 0. But
then, again, by continuity, it must also hold for c slightly above 0. Q.E.D.
Proof of Proposition 4
It is straightforward to show that RLT (p), RST
1
(p) for p  pk, and F(p) all fall in .
In addition, RST
1
(p) for pST  p < pk also falls in  as long as pAH +(1-)AL
< 1
which is the case for p = pk and hence also for all p < pk.
Turning to the critical credit ratings, it is straightforward to show that pCP

increases in . Furthermore, the lowest credit rating at which short-term direct
finance is still available, pST , falls with  increasing as long as
 <
H
- ALH
AH
- ALH
(48)
It is obvious that the RHS is larger than 1 as H
> AH by assumption and the
restriction is therefore not binding. Hence, pST also falls in . Q.E.D.
Proof of Proposition 5
It is straightforward to show that pLT falls and pCP

rises in . In addition, pST falls
in  as long as
 <
AH
- AL
AH
ALH
- AL
AH
(49)
However, we know that bad firms are not worth financing, i.e. H +(1-)AL+B <
1, which is equivalent to
 <
1 - AL
- B
H
- AL
. (50)
36
36
No matter what value B assumes  cannot exceed 1-AL
H
-AL
. However, this is less than
the restriction required for pST to fall in . Hence, pST always falls in . Q.E.D.
