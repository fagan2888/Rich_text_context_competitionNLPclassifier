"Access to safe, quality, affordable housing--and the supports
necessary to maintain that housing--constitute one of the
most basic and powerful social determinants of health"
(Corporation for Supportive Housing, 2014, p. 2). Social
determinants of health are the economic, social, and political
conditions that affect health outcomes and are the underlying,
contributing factors of health inequities (World Health
Organization [WHO], 2008). Populations in need of subsi-
dized housing are considered vulnerable as a consequence of
poverty. Low-income preseniors, defined as those between 55
and 64 years of age, represent a vulnerable and often over-
looked subpopulation at the interface between adult and older
adult populations. Risk factors for low-income preseniors
include multiple challenges related to finding and sustaining
employment, limited financial resources, mental and physical
health challenges, mobility issues, and ineligibility for pen-
sions and benefits for those aged 65 and older (McDonald,
Donahue, Janes, & Cleghorn, 2006; Onolemhemhen, 2009;
Ploeg, Hayward, Woodward, & Johnston, 2008). These issues
make finding suitable, affordable housing particularly chal-
lenging when compounded with limited affordable housing
stock. The presence of individual complex risk factors com-
bined with structural factors such as the lack of affordable
housing leave many in this age group vulnerable to housing
insecurity or homelessness (McDonald, Dergal, & Cleghorn,
2007). Research from other subpopulations experiencing
homelessness (e.g., families) suggests subsidized housing as a
protective factor against future episodes of homelessness
(Bassuk et al., 1997; Shinn, 1997; Shinn, Gottlieb, Wett, &
Bahl.,2007;Smith,Flores,Lin,&Markovic,2005;Stojanovic,
Weitzman, Shinn, Labay, & Williams, 1999). These factors
create a strong impetus for exploring subsidized housing as a
suitable community housing option for this age group.
As a consequence of population aging, the Center for
Housing Policy in the United States predicts an increase in
those most vulnerable, including people with a disability,
women living alone, and minorities (Lipman, Lubell, &
Salomon, 2012). They propose that a greater number of

Falling Through the Cracks: Exploring the
Subsidized Housing Needs of Low-Income
Preseniors From the Perspectives of
Housing Providers

Abstract
Low-income preseniors represent a vulnerable, often overlooked population facing multiple challenges related to finding
and sustaining employment, limited financial resources, mental and physical health challenges, mobility issues, and ineligibility
for pensions and benefits for seniors. These issues make finding suitable, affordable housing particularly challenging when
compounded with limited affordable housing stock, thus increasing this population's risk for housing insecurity/homelessness.
This qualitative, exploratory study examined subsidized housing issues for low-income preseniors from the perspective of
subsidized housing providers (n = 16). Barriers for this population occurred within individual (limited financial resources;
complex health, mental health, and disability issues; current unsafe/inadequate housing; and new immigrant status) and
structural (strict age cutoffs, inadequate safe/affordable housing supply, lack of information about the housing and service
needs of the population, and ineffective collaboration within the sector) domains. Policy changes at the provincial and federal
levels related to income support, availability of affordable housing supports, and immigration are recommended.

housing options for the aging population will prevent unnec-
essary and early nursing home admissions, particularly for
those most vulnerable. The Canada Mortgage and Housing
Corporation (2000) noted that the demand for community
housing options rather than institutional care will increase as
a consequence of the aging population. The desire of many
older people to remain housed in independent living arrange-
ments in residential areas as long as they are able also high-
lights the importance of community housing options.
Subsidized housing with supports holds potential to prevent
homelessness, early nursing home admissions, or unneces-
sary residential care for those aged 55 to 64.
There is a limited body of Canadian literature examining this
issue; we identified five Canadian studies that focus on the
housing experiences of those aged 55 to 64 (Furlotte, Schwartz,
Koornstra, & Naster, 2012; McDonald et al., 2007; McDonald
et al., 2006; McLeod & Walsh, 2014; Ploeg et al., 2008). The
definition of older adults in the literature is inconsistent and may
refer to adults aged 50, 55, 60, or 65, presenting policy and prac-
tice challenges for examining the risk factors and needs of this
population. This population, referred to as "the gap," experi-
ences a unique form of ageism given their positioning between
services for adults and seniors (McDonald et al., 2006).
Complex Risk Factors
Preseniors experience multiple challenges in terms of hous-
ing. McDonald et al. (2006) conducted a study of adults 50
years of age and older in Calgary and Toronto, collecting
data from a nonrandom survey of older adults in supportive
housing (n = 237), in-depth qualitative interviews with for-
merly homeless older adults (n = 53), and focus groups with
service providers formerly homeless older adults living in
supportive housing (n = 69). Participants reported that secur-
ing housing was critical in supporting health and wellness,
but more than housing was required to enhance health, well-
being, and social inclusion. Identified barriers included lim-
ited housing options, ageism specific to the "gap" (age
50-64), and insufficient financial/employment supports.
Informants noted a need for integrated service delivery and a
range of support options. The study recommended increased
access to age appropriate, affordable housing options with
the necessary social and health supports, as an important fac-
tor in improving health and well-being outcomes.
In a large urban city located in Southwestern Ontario, Ploeg
et al. (2008) evaluated a Homeless Intervention Program
(HIP) that targeted persons of low-income, homeless individu-
als or those vulnerable to housing instability aged 54 and older.
They examined HIP records of clients (n = 129); conducted
three focus groups with service users (n = 5), housing provid-
ers (n = 8), and program providers and administrators (n = 4);
and completed individual interviews with funders (n = 3), pro-
gram providers and administrators (n = 6), and service admin-
istrators (n = 4). Forty-seven percent of participants aged 54 to
64 noted a lack of employment, ineligibility for old age
benefits, and inability to work or participate in "employment
related welfare initiatives" due to substance use or poor health
(Ploeg et al., 2008, p. 598). The study found high levels of
needs related to health, mental health, and housing among
older adults with histories of homelessness or housing
insecurity.
Lack of Affordable Housing
Insufficient availability of affordable and subsidized housing
has been identified as a core policy issue (Calgary Homeless
Foundation Community Action Committee, 2010). The dire
shortage of affordable and supportive housing is recognized as a
structural factor in homelessness for older adults (Aubry,
Klodawsky, & Coloumbe, 2012; McDonald et al., 2007; Ploeg
et al., 2008). In addition, as those younger than age 65 are at the
interface of two subsidized housing groups, they face the lim-
ited subsidized housing available across the adult age spectrum.
Ploeg and colleagues (2008) noted that community housing for
older adults is in short supply and only a minority of older adults
who need housing are eligible. With limited housing options
available, they reported that older adults end up on lengthy wait-
ing lists where priority is given to certain subgroups of older
adults (e.g., those living on the street or with histories of abuse).
Furthermore, researchers emphasized the need for increased
affordable housing that is age appropriate (Furlotte et al., 2012;
McDonald et al., 2006; McLeod & Walsh, 2014).
Furlotte et al. (2012) examined the experiences of 11
older adults (aged 52-67) with HIV/AIDS seeking housing in
Ottawa. Participants identified significant concerns related
to food and housing insecurity, medical costs, stigma and
acceptance within retirement homes or nursing homes related
to sexual orientation, or use of alternative therapies (use of
marijuana for pain control) and the heightened risk to health
as a consequence of being exposed to germs and illnesses
within homeless shelters.
Drawn from a national Canadian sample, McLeod and
Walsh (2014) examined the shelter experiences of women
(n = 8) who became homeless for the first time after age 50
living in shelters in Vancouver, Calgary, Montreal, and
Halifax. Widowhood, family breakdown, substance use,
rapid deterioration of health, interpersonal conflict, and
financial issues were among the causes of homelessness
identified by older women in the study. The authors highlight
the importance of gender-specific preventive measures to
keep older women housed, as more women become home-
less in later life than men and their trajectories into home-
lessness differ from their male counterparts.
Vulnerable to Housing Instability or
Homelessness
The definition of "homeless" varies among studies and may
differ from participants' perspectives on what it means to be
homeless. In Calgary, those aged 45 to 64 comprised a
Walsh et al. 3
significant proportion (35%) of the homeless population,
42% of whom resided in emergency shelters, 27% in short-
term supportive housing, 10% system homeless, and 38%
rough sleepers (Calgary Homeless Foundation [CHF], 2012).
Different levels of support are required to maintain inde-
pendent living for older adults based on a number of factors
including their history of homelessness or housing insecurity
(McDonald et al., 2007; McLeod & Walsh, 2014). Further
attention to older persons experiencing homelessness is nec-
essary due to their susceptibility to abuse, greater rates of
mental and physical illness, and ineligibility for seniors' pro-
grams or benefits. Gonyea, Mills-Dick, and Bachman (2010)
suggested that older adults with histories of homelessness
may be functionally older than their chronological age.
While attention to older adult homelessness is increasing,
little research on outreach or supportive housing programs
for this population exists (Gonyea et al., 2010). Due to the
complex risk factors, lack of affordable housing, and the
effects of homelessness on this age group, knowledge about
the accessibility of subsidized housing for preseniors is
necessary.
Concern about adequate subsidized housing for the popu-
lation of preseniors was initially identified by frontline staff
of a housing office of a large center for adults aged older
than 50 in Calgary. Over a 2-year period, frontline staff doc-
umented a high number of inquiries from low-income adults
between 50 and 64 years of age. Anecdotally, they reported
that callers identified substantial difficulty finding afford-
able or subsidized housing and often expressed great
desperation in seeking support and resources. Although pre-
liminary tracking data from the housing office suggested a
relatively high proportion of preseniors were experiencing
difficulty finding subsidized housing in Calgary, little infor-
mation was available to ascertain their specific housing and
associated service needs, and the practice of the subsidized
housing sector related to servicing this population was not
well understood.
As a first step in addressing this issue, the center for older
adults hosted a meeting for managers from the subsidized
housing sector to explore issues related to older adults during
which concern about the subsidized housing situation for
preseniors in Calgary was identified. In addition, the extent
to which existing housing practices and policies were able to
address the specific, multiple, and complex needs of this
group and the resultant potential for heightened risk of hous-
ing insecurity and homelessness among this population were
noted as problematic. Participants identified the need for fur-
ther research to explore the specific needs of low-income
preseniors who they viewed as at heightened risk for "falling
through the cracks" in terms of access to subsidized housing
and related supportive services.
Understanding subsidized housing experiences for this age
group is a challenging undertaking requiring insights from a
variety of stakeholders, including housing managers; front-
line staff handling requests, intake, and referrals; decision
makers; and importantly older adults seeking housing. In this
study, we sought to explore subsidized housing issues for
low-income preseniors from the perspective of subsidized
housing providers to provide a foundation for subsequent
research that would include perspectives of other relevant
stakeholders. The objectives of the study were to obtain per-
spectives of subsidized housing representatives related to
housing issues, current policies and practices, challenges and
gaps in accessibility, recommendations for change, and col-
laboration opportunities.
The following research questions were developed based
on knowledge gaps identified at the housing sector meeting:
Research Question 1: What are the demographic charac-
teristics of people requesting housing but not placed?
Research Question 2: What is policy with regard to
accepting those aged 55 to 64 in seniors' subsidized
housing?
Research Question 2a: How many management compa-
nies accept requests for housing from preseniors?
Research Question 2b: Which management companies
accept preseniors on the waitlist? If so, how many are on
waitlists and for what length of time?
Research Question 3: What are the challenges and gaps
management companies are facing in addressing the
needs of this population and what are recommendations
for practice and policy change?
Research Question 4: To what extent is this sector col-
laborating to address subsidized housing for this
population?
It was anticipated that by exploring the context of prese-
niors housing issues and engaging the sector in discussions
about these issues, the unique housing challenges faced by
this group could be identified, and policy and practice rec-
ommendations made toward mitigating the risk of homeless-
ness for this vulnerable population.
Method
The study used a multiple-method qualitative, exploratory
approach to investigate the subsidized housing issues for
low-income preseniors from the perspective of subsidized
housing providers. The institutional research ethics board
approved the study research protocol and all participants
were volunteers who provided written informed consent.
Data Collection
Three data collection methods were used: qualitative inter-
views, tracking of housing requests, and a focus group.
Interviews.The purpose of the qualitative interviews was to
investigate the process of macro practice and policy issues
related to housing low-income preseniors in their specific
4 SAGE Open
organizational context. A directory of subsidized housing for
seniors (aged 60 and older) and other resources identifying
subsidized housing sites were used to develop the sampling
frame that ultimately comprised 21 managers representing 14
subsidized housing providers, 62 sites, and three individuals
from the subsidized housing sector. All identified representa-
tives were invited to an information session hosted by the
Kerby Center in January 2012 to introduce the project and
solicit participation; 16 representatives from the sector attended
the session. Subsequently, all representatives identified in the
sampling frame were contacted by telephone and/or email to
invite them to participate in the study. Twelve managers and
four intake workers agreed to participate in the study represent-
ing 12 of the 14 identified subsidized housing providers.
An 11-item semistructured field guide that included ques-
tions related to the nature of requests received for placement,
formal and informal organizational policies and procedures
regarding placing this population, challenges and gaps expe-
rienced in addressing the subsidized housing needs of low-
income preseniors, and recommendations for practice and
policy change was used for the interview.
Interviews, lasting between 30 and 60 min, were con-
ducted in subsidized housing providers' offices between
January and April 2012. Interviews were audio recorded and
transcribed verbatim, with the electronic responses of one
participant who preferred to respond to the questions elec-
tronically, added to the data set.
Tracking.Interview participants were asked to provide a
summary of housing requests from low-income preseniors
over a 2-month time frame to provide statistical estimates of
the housing need. Information was requested about the type
of contact (e.g., telephone or walk-in), demographic profiles
of those requesting housing (e.g., marital status, age, and
income), type of accommodation required, reason for seek-
ing housing, outcome of the contact (e.g., placement or refer-
ral details), and comments. As only five summaries were
received, these data were not included in the analysis.
Focus group. In June 2012, once the preliminary analysis was
completed, all participants were invited to a focus group the
purpose of which was to (a) review and discuss the prelimi-
nary study findings, highlight priority areas, and identify any
missing details; (b) explore implications of the findings for
practice and policy related to subsidized housing for low-
income preseniors; and (c) codevelop practice and policy
recommendations with a focus on collaborative actionable
items. Prior to the session, participants were provided with
an electronic copy of the preliminary results of the study.
Four participants representing four different housing provid-
ers attended the focus group.
Data Analysis
Qualitative data analysis and grounded theory techniques were
used to analyze the interview and focus group transcripts
(Strauss & Corbin, 1990). The analyzed process consisted of
(a) open coding--breaking down, examining, comparing,
conceptualizing, and categorizing data; (b) axial coding--
assembling data in new ways by making connections between
categories; and (c) selective coding--selecting the core cate-
gory in relation to other categories according to the objectives
of the study (Bryman & Burgess, 1993). We used investigator
triangulation, with several members of the research team
involved in the analysis process independently to check for
accuracy in coding and consistency and in identifying themes,
and methodological triangulation, through reviewing prelimi-
nary interview findings during the focus group (Patton, 2002)
to ensure study rigor (Denzin, 1978).
Findings
Study findings produced one overarching theme--barriers
for low-income preseniors in accessing suitable housing.
This occurred within individual and structural domains. The
individual- and structural-level factors were each comprised
of several subthemes. The following section describes each
theme and subtheme with illustrative quotes drawn from the
transcripts. While these barriers are presented as unique,
independent contributors to housing insecurity for low-
income preseniors on either the micro- or macro-spheres,
they are inextricably interrelated, often exacerbating the vul-
nerability of this population to housing insecurity and other
adversity. For example, the individual factor describing the
complex needs of this population in terms of health, mental
health, and disability is entwined within limited housing
options available to meet these specific needs.
Individual-Level Barriers
In terms of individual- or micro-level barriers, this popula-
tion had limited financial resources, with often complex
health, mental health, and disability issues, heightened vul-
nerability related to their current unsafe and inadequate
housing, and new immigrant populations were noted at
greater risk.
The most commonly identified barrier for this population
in accessing suitable housing was their extremely limited
financial resources. The impoverishment of this population
directly affected the housing that preseniors can obtain and
maintain, according to study respondents. "They are paying
way more than they can afford to. For example, they might
be onAISH [Assured Income for the Severely Handicapped],
and they are paying Can$800 a month for rent," noted one
informant. Income is a requirement for subsidized housing
and as one participant shared, "people would say things like,
it is hard for me because of my age, I am not on OAS [Old
Age Security] yet, so I don't have stable money, and nobody
wants me." While identified as an individual factor, the role
of the government in providing adequate financial resources
for this age group was also noted among all study respon-
dents. As one participant articulated, "more financial support
Walsh et al. 5
from the government and/or different programs that can help
these seniors gain some financial support."
Preseniors' low-income status was often complicated by
other adverse circumstances related to mental and physical
health issues and addictions. This, in turn, affected their abil-
ity to find suitable and affordable housing. As one respon-
dent explained,
A lot of them seem to have medical issues, they have got mental
health issues; they have got substance abuse issues. Not all of
them, but obviously sometimes when you have those problems
that prevent you from being able to work it . . . limits your
income.
Smoking also disqualified this population from accessing
subsidized housing; "we don't have any smoking on our
property as of July this year; so we have to do that just for the
safety of everyone."
Furthermore, the multiple and complex support needs of
preseniors necessary to sustain a successful housing place-
ment was typically beyond the mandate of housing manag-
ers. As one participant identified, "they are coming to us
older, more frail, needing more health care supports . . . too
many complex issues without support systems."
As a consequence of their complex needs and the lack of
appropriate housing to meet these needs, low-income prese-
niors were frequently living in unsafe housing. Study partici-
pants noted that housing for this population presented
physical barriers, as one respondent described, "Some of
them are downstairs and they can't do stairs . . . they are
trapped. I even had a guy in a wheelchair . . . in the base-
ment." Other informants described preseniors living in situa-
tions where they felt unsafe or vulnerable: "I don't like living
with lots people and that's the only way we can afford it and
that is a safety factor for me." Living in situations within
which preseniors experienced physical, verbal, emotional, or
financial abuse was described by participants as becoming
increasingly common.
Immigrant preseniors were noted to be at particular risk
for housing insecurity if they do not meet Canadian resi-
dency requirements of 10 years to be eligible for subsidized
housing or income support and are thus largely dependent on
sponsors for support (Canadian Council for Refugees, 2013).
This dependency heightened older immigrants' vulnerabil-
ity: "they feel they are mistreated, they feel they are not
respected, they have to ask for everything, they have to ask
money for medications, they have to ask money and permis-
sion for everything." In rare cases, exceptions are made to
the residency requirement when, for example, sponsorship
breakdown occurs.
Structural-Level Barriers
Structural- or macro-level factors played a critical role in the
housing insecurity low-income preseniors faced. Structural
barriers included strict age cutoffs, inadequate safe and
affordable housing supply, dearth of information about this
population and specifically regarding their housing and sup-
port needs, and a lack of effective collaboration within the
sector.
The primary structural barrier low-income preseniors
faced in accessing subsidized housing was the application of
strict age cutoffs to determine housing eligibility for seniors'
housing. Respondents noted that this resulted in this popula-
tion being assigned a low priority in being accepted or wait-
listed for housing. In particular, age restrictions in seniors'
subsidized housing limited the ability of low-income prese-
niors to secure housing in this setting. Preseniors are typi-
cally turned away because of their age, as one participant
elaborated, "We do get a lot of calls from the late 50 age
range, and we just have to tell them, `unfortunately, no.'"
Another concurred, "We are pretty rigid. They need to be 65
in order to qualify."
Participants identified some rare instances where individ-
uals aged younger than 65 were placed in housing, primarily
as a result of availability. As one participant explained,
Preference [for subsidized housing] of course is given to 65
plus. There are some other companies out there that will make
an exception if they don't have a wait list. But that is not the case
here. We are pretty much always full. It doesn't take us long to
turn over our suites when they come up . . . because we have a
wait list, we do abide by that 65 plus.
Similar to this respondent, the majority of the subsidized
housing providers in the study identified that they typically
had waitlists comprised of seniors, which effectively elimi-
nated preseniors from being considered. Subsidized housing
providers use a point system based on an assessment of need
to determine waitlist and placement priority, with the major
contributor to the points being age--aged older than 60 or
65. Respondents also noted that low-income preseniors were
eligible to apply for other subsidized housing not specifically
designated for seniors; however, as this population is typi-
cally without dependents, they are assigned a low priority on
these waitlists, as well.
Others noted that approval from the government was nec-
essary before making any changes to existing policies, such
as a change to the eligibility criteria. "We wouldn't have the
authority to implement these changes. The changes have to
come from the government level." Another concurred, stat-
ing, "if our management board wanted to go down to as low
as [age] 50, I guarantee you we would have to provide some
written information on how that is necessary with Alberta
Housing before we got the go ahead."
Lack of appropriate and affordable housing was a major
factor implicated in the ability of low-income preseniors to
access and maintain housing. Furthermore, the relationship
between income and availability of housing for preseniors
was identified as a major gap in service provision. As one
respondent commented, "There is just no housing for them.
There is just nothing."
6 SAGE Open
Funding for additional housing was noted by informants
as falling outside their mandate and within the auspices of
the provincial government. As one participant explained,
They need a tax base for the Province, so there we go with our
Catch-22. As a mayor, I could come up with all sorts of practices
that are acceptable for 55 to 64, but if I am not given money
from the Province, what am I going to do?
Together with the overall lack of housing for this popula-
tion, participants recognized that even the limited options for
subsidized housing do not afford applicants personal choice
about what area of the city they would like to live. As an
exemplar, an informant offered, "There is not much subsi-
dized housing in the South area. Many seniors would like to
stay close to their kids and not many options are given."
Study participants identified a general lack of knowledge
regarding the housing and associated service needs of this
population. Although some participants noted that there
appeared to be an emerging awareness of the issues faced by
preseniors, it was recommended that more research was nec-
essary to understand the specific housing needs of low-
income preseniors. As one housing representative described,
People are waking up to the problem, being aware. This is
something we need to deal with. It's getting out of control. The
need, the spark, the desire--it's all there. So, it's starting to
come together. I think there is still a lot more work to be done
but I think people are in a good place to do the work. Like right
now we are researching ideas to find out exactly what this
population is experiencing.
The final structural barrier identified by the housing sec-
tor managers was the lack of effective collaboration within
the sector. Study participants identified an overall lack of
collaboration within the housing sector. When asked about
the degree of collaboration, for example, one respondent
stated, "the housing sector? They are not" and another simi-
larly advised, "they're not . . . I just don't see any. This has
been a problem for years and I just don't see any work being
made to bridge that gap." Another participant elaborated,
"We don't have contact with the other management groups.
We are all independent now. We meet informally, so I really
don't know what the policies and procedures are of the other
management groups."
Others expressed a lack of knowledge of any collabora-
tive efforts, making comments such as, "I don't really know
much about what the sector is doing to collaborate," "I don't
know. I really don't know," and "I am not familiar with much
that is being done."
Respondents articulated the need for collaboration within
the sector to, for example, "come up with some kind of solu-
tion." Similarly, another key informant suggested,
As a sector, there needs to be more planning together as a
network; more ways that we can find to connect the web. There
needs to be some discussion around the policies about what is
funded and what is not funded and re-visit all of that.
It was recommended that collaborative efforts should not
be limited solely to the housing sector and that the sector
responsible for seniors should be involved.
Participants identified that collaboration required "fund-
ing for collaboration, funding for staff, more opportunity to
interface, more infrastructures that don't put the pressure on
the front and instead put it on the system for us to be able to
work more cohesively." Another impediment to collabora-
tion related to the staff who were described as already over-
worked and that collaboration "takes time and nurturing and
an allowance of space within their day to day."
A few participants provided examples of existing collabo-
rations, including "front line really does a superb job given
the time and the limited resources and the limited [number
of] people." Another participant noted,
People are trying to come together. It's not fully integrated yet--
it's not far. But people are waking up to the problem, being
aware. I think there is still a lot more work to be done but I think
people are in a good place to do the work.
Finally, one participant suggested that, although limited,
some service providers and housing organizations were mobi-
lizing to address the housing needs of preseniors in general,
and specifically immigrant preseniors.
Discussion
Participants in the study portrayed how low-income prese-
niors are falling through the cracks in accessing affordable,
safe, subsidized housing as a consequence of individual- and
structural-level barriers. In this study, the social determinants
of health approach revealed how structural factors including
economic, social, and political conditions (WHO, 2008) of
low-income preseniors influence and interact with individual-
level factors, such as mental health, physical health, substance
use, disability, and ethnicity, to shape individuals' needs and
experiences. These findings are consistent with those from
similar studies in other Canadian cities (Furlotte et al., 2012;
McDonald et al., 2007; McDonald et al., 2006; McLeod &
Walsh,2014;Ploegetal.,2008).Thestructural-andindividual-
level barriers this subpopulation encounters enhance their
vulnerabilities and intensify their risk for adversity in terms of
poverty and homelessness. Study findings suggest individual
and systemic barriers must be addressed to increase access to
subsidized housing for those in this age group as an important
social determinant of health.
In this study, low income and impoverishment had severe
ramifications for preseniors. It made them ineligible for subsi-
dized housing based on policies. In their study, Ploeg et al.
(2008) also found the low-income levels of clients created a
barrier to securing the identified housing. Similarly, McDonald
Walsh et al. 7
et al. (2006) described how the lack of affordable housing,
limited income levels, minimal employment supports, and the
influence of homelessness and aging combined to create sig-
nificant barriers for this population to successfully transition
into housing.
Mentalhealth,physicalhealth,substanceuse,ordisability-
related needs of those requesting housing from this age group
often exceeded the capacity of the supports available in their
subsidized housing units. The high level of needs combined
with the lack of existing support made it difficult for the
managers to accept them into housing. McDonald et al.
(2007) also noted that the health and social needs of this age
group experiencing homelessness often exceed existing
services.
Findings from this study support literature identifying
the multiple and complex health and social service needs of
this population in the context of considerable social
vulnerability.
The Calgary Homeless Foundation Community Action
Committee's (2010) Seniors and Special Needs in Calgary
report identifies vulnerability within this population introduced
by factors such as cultural diversity, physical and mental health,
and disability. In a review of literature,Areán et al. (2010) con-
cluded that targeting interventions toward broader forms of
social adversity such as poverty and homelessness was neces-
sary to treat depression in older low-income adults. Crane and
Warnes (2010) described the influence of inadequate nutrition,
age, lack of health care, social isolation, and living environ-
ment on older adults'physical and mental health.
This study identifies new immigrants as at particular risk
for housing insecurity. While this relationship has been iden-
tified in recent studies (see, for example, Walsh, Hanley, Ives,
& Hordyl, 2015), the housing and service needs among older
immigrant adults have not been established. The Canadian
requirements of 10-year residency was also noted as com-
plicit in the relationship between family sponsorship require-
ments of family-class immigrants and low income and
housing insecurity faced by older immigrants (Kaida & Boyd,
2011). In addition, policy changes enacted at the provincial
and federal levels related to income support, availability of
affordable housing and supports, and immigration policies
affecting low-income preseniors are warranted.
Increased communication and collaboration among the
housing and senior sector, and the necessary supports, is also
indicated. In addition, facilitating access to appropriate hous-
ing for this population will require increased and effective
collaboration between general subsidized housing providers
and seniors' subsidized housing providers with the end goal
of streamlining services and application processes (e.g.,
shared waitlist or central database) and establishing consis-
tent and transparent evaluation strategies for prioritizing
applicants.
Housing older adults is more complex than housing
younger adults (Crane & Warnes, 2010; Gonyea et al.,
2010) as older adults frequently require additional supports
related to their high rates of mental and physical health
problems, substance dependence, or permanent disability.
Supportive living environments are thus recommended
(Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation, 2000;
McDonald et al., 2007; Ploeg et al., 2008). Furthermore,
Ploeg et al. (2008) identified the importance of continuity
of service when working with older adults, meaning the
same service provider works to address housing and sup-
port needs. In this study and others (e.g., McDonald et al.,
2006), service providers emphasized the potential for con-
flict in housing environments where diverse ages, needs,
and rental arrangements exist, specifically residents who
receive services may be in conflict with residents who do
not receive services. In addition, other studies have articu-
lated the specific housing requirements for populations
with HIV/AIDS (Furlotte et al., 2012). To this end, in the
short term, the seniors' subsidized housing sector should
explore options for providing or strengthening existing sup-
ports in existing subsidized housing units through commu-
nity partnerships (e.g., social work, health or mental health
outreach teams, community partnerships) to better support
the needs of this age group.
Given the limited body of literature on the housing and
supportive needs of this vulnerable subpopulation, low-
income preseniors, this study makes an important contribu-
tion to knowledge building on this topic. Study findings and
recommendations may help to engage practitioners, decision
makers, policy makers, preseniors, and other stakeholders in
connecting, conversing, and collaborating about strategies
related to addressing the subsidized housing needs of low-
income preseniors. Finally, the study directs us to further
research and specifically research that examines the housing
and supportive needs of low-income preseniors from their
own perspective.
Limitations
This study is limited to the opinions of a relatively small
sample of housing service providers in one city in Western
Canada, which precludes generalization to other settings. In
addition, we were unable to gather a statistical profile of low-
income preseniors requesting access to subsidized housing,
thus limiting our understanding of the characteristics of this
population to the perspectives of the subsidized housing pro-
viders. Nevertheless, we were able to interview at least one
representative from the majority of subsidized housing pro-
viders in the city (12/14) and to verify the preliminary find-
ings and preliminary recommendations among a small group
of subsidized seniors' housing service providers.
While this study focused on the perspectives of subsidized
housing managers, it was limited to housing companies that
primarily housed seniors. As such, the perspectives of hous-
ing managers serving the general adult population were not
included. Furthermore, the perspective of low-income prese-
niors is of critical importance to understand this issue more
8 SAGE Open
fully. In the next phase of this research, we engage this popu-
lation, thus providing a more comprehensive understanding
of subsidized housing challenges and opportunities for this
group of vulnerable adults.
The findings of this study can contribute to informing
policy development, supporting sector plans to end home-
lessness, increasing awareness of the unique needs and chal-
lenges faced by low-income preseniors, and potentially
playing a role in creating greater access to subsidized hous-
ing for this vulnerable population.
