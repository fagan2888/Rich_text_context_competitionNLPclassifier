OBJECTIVE -- To examine trends in the prevalence of diagnosed and undiagnosed diabetes
and the proportion of total cases previously diagnosed, according to obesity status in the U.S.
over the past 40 years.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS -- We assembled data from five consecutive
cross-sectional national surveys: National Health Examination Survey I (1960­1962), National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) I (1971­1974), NHANES II (1976­
1980), NHANES III (1988­1994), and NHANES 1999­2000. Diagnosed diabetes was ascer-
tained, and height and weight were measured in adults aged 20­74 years in all surveys. In
NHANES II, NHANES III, and NHANES 1999­2000, a fasting glucose level 126 mg/dl was
used to identify cases among individuals not reporting diabetes. Design-based analyses and
Bayesian models estimate the probability that prevalence of diabetes increased within four BMI
groups (25, 25­29, 30­34, and 35 kg/m2).
RESULTS -- In the U.S. population aged 20­74 years between 1976­1980 and 1999­2000,
significant increases in the prevalence of diagnosed diabetes (3.3­5.8%, probability 99.9%)
were accompanied by nonsignificant increases in undiagnosed diabetes (2.0­2.4%, 66.6%).
This resulted in an increase in total diabetes (5.3­8.2%, 99.9%) and a modest nonsignificant
increase in the proportion of cases that were diagnosed (62­70%, 62.4%). However, these trends
varied considerably by BMI level. In individuals with BMI 35 kg/m2, diagnosed diabetes
increased markedly (from 4.9% in 1960, to 8.6% during 1976­1980, to 15.1% in 1999­2000;
probability 99.9%), whereas undiagnosed diabetes declined considerably (12.5% during
1976­1980 to 3.2% in 1999­2000, probability of increase 4.5%) Therefore, the proportion of
total diabetes cases that were diagnosed increased from 41 to 83% (probability 99.9%) among
individuals with BMI 35 kg/m2. By comparison, changes in prevalence within BMI strata 35
kg/m2 were modest and there was no increase in the percent of total cases that were diagnosed.
CONCLUSIONS -- National surveys over the last several decades have found large increases
in diagnosed diabetes, particularly in overweight and obese individuals, but this has been
accompanied by large decreases in undiagnosed diabetes only among individuals with BMI 35
kg/m2. This suggests that improvements in diabetes awareness and detection are most prominent
among this subgroup.
Diabetes Care 27:2806­2812, 2004
The prevalence of diagnosed diabetes
increased dramatically during the
past 40 years in the U.S. and many
other countries around the world (1­5).
Increases in prevalence have been primar-
ily attributed to increases in type 2 diabe-
tes and have been observed among both
men and women and across ethnic groups
and age-groups (2,3,6). The type 2 diabe-
tes epidemic is believed to be largely a
by-product of a concomitant increase in
obesity levels (7), because population in-
creases in diabetes have coincided with
increases in obesity and because weight
gain is a key determinant of insulin resis-
tance and diabetes (5,7­9).
Although there is little debate that
obesity is a key factor driving the diabetes
epidemic, other factors may play an inde-
pendent role, including reductions in
physical activity, changes in diet compo-
sition, environmental factors, or an in-
crease in survival (5,10­12). In addition,
because many diabetes surveillance data
depend on self-reports (1,3,8,13­15), the
estimated prevalence of diabetes may be
affected by an increase in the proportion
that is diagnosed.
Despite the recent attention to the di-
abetes epidemic, previous studies have
not examined whether diabetes preva-
lence has increased similarly among lean,
overweight, and obese persons. For ex-
ample, a higher diabetes prevalence in
2000 than in 1980 among persons in the
same weight categories (as measured by
BMI) would suggest that some environ-
mental, cohort, or detection-related fac-
tor above and beyond BMI is playing an
important role in the growth of the diabe-
tes epidemic. Similarly, variation in the
ratio of diagnosed to undiagnosed diabe-
tes according to level of obesity could in-
dicate that detection efforts are working
differently in certain subgroups and po-
tentially influencing estimates of diabetes
prevalence.
To assess whether the association of
obesity and diabetes has changed over
time, and whether increases in diabetes
have occurred similarly among obese as
among lean individuals, we assembled

data from five consecutive nationally rep-
resentative surveys. We present 40-year
trends in the prevalence of diabetes and
the proportion of total diabetes cases that
are diagnosed according to levels of BMI.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND
METHODS -- The National Health
Examination Survey (NHES) and Na-
tional Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey (NHANES) are a series of health
surveys designed to be representative of
the noninstitutionalized U.S. population,
conducted from 1960 to 1962 (NHES),
1971 to 1975 (NHANES I), 1976 to 1980
(NHANES II), 1988 to 1994 (NHANES
III), and 1999 to 2000 (NHANES 1999­
2000) (16­20). Each of the surveys fol-
lowed a stratified multistage probability
design in which a sample of the U.S. ci-
vilian, noninstitutionalized population
was selected (16­20).
To maximize comparability across
the five surveys, we restricted analyses to
nonpregnant adults aged 20­74 years
who provided height and weight as part of
a standardized examination and informa-
tion about diabetes history as part of an
interview. In the five surveys, there were
6,240, 12,900, 11,761, 14,301, and
3,598 participants, respectively. Overall
response rates among adults in these sur-
veys were 87, 70, 69, 77, and 76%, re-
spectively (16­20).
BMI and demographic measures
Each NHANES consists of a detailed stan-
dardized medical examination in a mobile
examination unit and an interview to ob-
tain information on sociodemographic
characteristics and cardiovascular risk
factors (16­20). Weight and height were
measured using a standard protocol and
were used to calculate BMI (weight in ki-
lograms divided by the square of the
height in meters). Race and ethnicity were
assessed differently in the latter two sur-
veys than in the first three surveys. There-
fore, we categorized participants as white
or black for NHANES I and NHANES II
and as non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic
black, Mexican American, or other for
NHANES III and NHANES 1999­2000.
We excluded individuals older than 74
years because patients in that age-group
were not sampled in the first three surveys.
Definition of diabetes
Diagnosed diabetes was defined as indi-
viduals' positive response to the question
of whether they had ever been told by a
doctor or other health professional that
they had diabetes. In the NHANES III and
NHANES 1999­2000, women who re-
ported being diagnosed only during preg-
nancy were not considered to have
diabetes. This information was not avail-
able for the earlier three surveys.
For the latter three surveys, undiag-
nosed diabetes was assessed in a sub-
sample (n  3,786, 5,800, and 1,441 in
NHANES II, III, and 1999­2000, respec-
tively) of nondiabetic persons who were
randomly assigned to a morning fasting
examination (2,4,21). Procedures for
blood collection and processing have
been described previously (2,4,20,21).
We used American Diabetes Association
(ADA) diagnostic criteria for undiagnosed
diabetes (fasting blood glucose level
126 mg/dl after 9 and 24 h fasting).
Fasting glucose values were not assessed
in the first two surveys (NHES and
NHANES I).
Data analysis
Statistical analyses were conducted using
SAS for Windows software (SAS Institute,
Cary, NC) (22) for data management,
SUDAAN software (Research Triangle In-
stitute, Research Triangle Park, NC) (23)
to obtain point estimates and standard er-
rors, and WinBUGS (Institute of Public
Health, Cambridge, U.K.; Imperial Col-
lege School of Medicine, London, U.K.)
(24) to fit models. Survey weights were
used that indicate the inverse of the prob-
ability of being sampled and adjust for
noncoverage and nonresponse. Taylor se-
ries linearization was used to calculate SEs
for NHES, NHANES I, NHANES II, and
NHANES III, and the jackknife method
was used for NHANES 1999­2000. For
comparisons across surveys, data were
age adjusted by the direct method to the
U.S. Census 2000 population using the
following age ranges: 20­34, 35­44, 45­
54, 55­64, and 65­74 years.
Prevalence of diagnosed diabetes was
calculated based on responses from indi-
viduals who attended the medical exami-
nation. Prevalence of undiagnosed
diabetes was determined based on labora-
tory findings from those who were in the
fasting morning subsample. The preva-
lence was adjusted to account for the fact
that individuals with diagnosed diabetes
were not part of the fasting morning sam-
ple denominator (2,25). Calculation of
SEs assumed independence between the
morning and examination samples. Prev-
alence of total diabetes was determined by
adding the prevalences of diagnosed and
adjusted undiagnosed diabetes. Our anal-
yses examined trends in prevalence of di-
abetes (diagnosed, undiagnosed, and
total) and the proportion of total cases
that were diagnosed across survey years,
by four BMI strata (25, 25­29.9, 30­
34.9, or 35 kg/m2). These categories
correspond to normal, overweight, obese
class I, and obese class II as suggested by
the National Heart Lung and Blood Insti-
tute Expert Panel on Overweight and
Obesity (26).
Trends in the age-adjusted estimates
of diabetes prevalence were assessed by
fitting a normal hierarchical Bayesian
model using noninformative prior distri-
butions (27). Using results of the Bayesian
models, we report the probability that the
prevalence has increased across the se-
lected time frame for the overall popula-
tion and according to BMI groups.
Probability 50% indicates that preva-
lence is more likely to have increased
rather than decreased, whereas a proba-
bility 50% suggests the prevalence is
more likely to have decreased. Probability
cut points of 97.5 and 2.5% may be used
to assess significant increases or de-
creases. In other words, probability
97.5% may be interpreted as a signifi-
cantly high probability that the prevalence
increased, whereas probability 2.5% in-
dicates a significantly high probability
that the prevalence decreased. A more de-
tailed description of the statistical ap-
proaches used is provided in the
STATISTICAL APPENDIX.
RESULTS -- Table 1 describes the
general characteristics of the sample pop-
ulations across the five surveys. There
were only slight changes in the age distri-
butions; the tendency in recent surveys
was toward a larger proportion of
younger people (20­44 years) relative to
middle-aged people (45­64 years) and a
slightly smaller proportion of women. A
change in the survey questionnaires
makes it impossible to directly compare
changes in the racial and ethnic profile
across all surveys, but an increase in the
proportion of Mexican Americans and in-
dividuals of other races or ethnicities is
evident in the most recent survey. The
proportion of participants with less than a
high school education decreased over
time. As has been previously published,

there were notable increases in mean
weight and BMI (from 25.4 kg/m2 during
1960­1962 to 28.0 kg/m2 during 1999­
2000) and prevalence of obesity (from
14.5% during 1960­1962 to 26.7% dur-
ing 1999­2000) (7).
Trends in diagnosed and
undiagnosed diabetes prevalence
Between 1960­1962 and 1999­2000,
the prevalence of diagnosed diabetes in
the U.S. population increased from 1.8 to
5.8%, an average increase of one percent-
age point per decade (Table 2). The prob-
ability that prevalence increased was
99.9%. The rate of increase was greatest
for those with BMI 35 kg/m2, among
whom the prevalence tripled (e.g., from
4.9 to 15.1%, probability 99.9%) and
whose per-decade increase was almost
twice that of the population overall. Prev-
alence more than doubled among persons
in the middle two BMI groups (25 to 30;
30 to 35), although the absolute mag-
nitude of change was less in these groups
(probability 99.5 for each). The preva-
lence of diagnosed diabetes doubled
among individuals with normal BMI
(25) (from 1.5 to 3%), although the sta-
tistical probability of this change was
weaker (probability 87.6%). We found
similar trends when we limited our anal-
ysis to the latter three surveys (from
1976­1980 to 1999­2000); again, the
increase in the prevalence of diagnosed
diabetes was greatest among those who
were the most obese (from 8.6 to 15.1%,
probability 88.7%).
There were modest, nonsignificant
increases in the prevalence of undiag-
nosed diabetes in the overall population
and across all BMI strata, with the excep-
tion of individuals with BMI 35 kg/m2
(Table 2). Among those individuals, the
prevalence of undiagnosed diabetes de-
creased from 12.5 to 3.2%. The probabil-
ity of an increase was only 4.5%, meaning
that the probability of a decrease was
95.5%. During the same time frame, the
prevalence of total diabetes (diagnosed
and undiagnosed combined) increased
from 5.3 to 8.2% in the overall population
(probability 99.9%) and remained rela-
tively stable within BMI groups. This
prevalence increased slightly among
those with BMI 35 kg/m2 (for example,
from 4.3 to 6.5% among those with BMI
25.0­29.9 kg/m2) and decreased slightly
among those with BMI 35 kg/m2 (from
21.1 to 18.3%), but the probabilities as-
sociated with these changes were modest.
Trends in the ratio of diagnosed to
total diabetes
Between 1976 and 2000, the proportion
of total diabetes cases that were diagnosed
(versus undiagnosed) (Fig. 1) increased
slightly in the overall population (from
62.3 to 70.7%), but this change was also
of modest statistical significance (proba-
bility of increase 62.4%). However, this
increase seemed to be concentrated

Diabetes prevalence by obesity level

among individuals with BMI 35 kg/m2,
in whom the proportion of cases that were
diagnosed increased from 40.8 to 82.5%
(probability 99.8%). Therefore, persons
with BMI 35 kg/m2 went from having
the lowest ratio of diagnosed to total dia-
betes cases in 1976­1980 to the highest
ratio during 1999­2000. Within other
BMI strata, this proportion was either sta-
ble or decreased slightly.
CONCLUSIONS -- In this examina-
tion of five consecutive national surveys
from 1960 to 2000, we found increasing
levels of total and diagnosed diabetes in
the U.S., consistent with previous analy-
ses of national data (1­3,14). However,
previous studies have not examined the
relationship of obesity status to trends in
diagnosed or undiagnosed diabetes or to
the proportion of total diabetes cases that
were diagnosed. We found that the trends
in these outcomes varied by level of obe-
sity. The prevalence of diagnosed diabetes
increased in all groups, but the most dra-
matic change was seen among the most
obese individuals (BMI 35 kg/m2),
prevalence was three times as high in
2000 as 1960. Underlying these findings
in the most obese group was a dramatic
increase in the proportion of diabetes
cases that are diagnosed, from 41% of to-
tal cases diagnosed during 1976­1980 to
83% of cases in 1999­2000.
Our study has several implications for
interpreting the diabetes epidemic in the
U.S. First, our finding of a large increase
in the proportion of diagnosed cases of
diabetes in individuals with BMI 35
kg/m2 suggests that detection of diabetes
has increased in this subgroup. Whereas
25 years ago this group had the highest
percentage of diabetes cases that went un-
diagnosed, it now has the highest percent-
age of diagnosed cases. We speculate that
better overall awareness among patients
and providers about diabetes and its po-
tential to be asymptomatic may have led
to increased opportunistic screening of
obese individuals in health care settings.
More specifically, increasing attention to
obesity and diabetes in both the lay and
professional media may have conditioned
health care providers to associate extreme
obesity with a high risk of undiagnosed
diabetes, making them more likely to
question obese patients about symptoms
and then to perform more testing. Despite
this increase in the proportion of diag-
nosed cases among the most obese group,
there was no increase in the proportion
diagnosed in other subgroups. Roughly
30% of the overall diabetic population is
estimated to be undiagnosed, indicating a
continuing need to improve detection of
undiagnosed diabetes and to increase
awareness of key diabetes risk factors.
Second, our finding that the preva-
lence rates for total diabetes (i.e., diag-
nosed and undiagnosed cases combined)
have remained relatively stable within
BMI strata, even as the BMI levels of
Americans have increased, is consistent
with prior arguments that obesity is the
predominant factor driving the growth of
the diabetes epidemic. This is reflected in
observational studies showing that the as-
sociation of obesity and weight gain with
diabetes is nonlinear, with disproportion-
ate increases in diabetes incidence among
individuals with BMI 35 kg/m2 and
weight gain (9,28). Similarly, in the
NHANES 1999­2000 sample, individu-
als with BMI 35 kg/m2 account for only
13.5% of the overall population but for
36% of the diabetic population. Other
factors, such as levels of physical activity,

Data are percent  SE or percent. *Denominator for diagnosed diabetes and total diabetes is based on the interview sample (all participants with BMI and
self-reported diabetes) (n  6,240, 12,900, 11,761, 14,301, and 3,598 for the five consecutive surveys, respectively). Denominators for undiagnosed diabetes are
based on the subsample who had attended the fasting morning examinations (n  3,786, 5,800, and 1,441 for the three surveys, respectively). Probabilities since
1960 are based on the slope of a fitted regression line, whereas probabilities since 1976 are based on comparison of 1976­1980 and 1999­2000 data points. Total
diabetes may differ from the sum of diagnosed and undiagnosed diabetes due to rounding error. All results are age adjusted to the U.S. 2000 census population.

diet (e.g., variations in whole grain and
fiber, dairy, saturated fat, and caffeine in-
take), or other unknown environmental
factors may also be important (11,29­
35). However, if changes in these factors
were playing an important role in the di-
abetes epidemic above and beyond their
effects on obesity, we would expect to see
changes in total diabetes prevalence in
groups with similar BMI.
A third implication of our findings is
that because much diabetes surveillance
is based on self-report of diabetes, a si-
multaneous increase in obesity preva-
lence and the detection of diabetes among
the most obese could complicate our in-
terpretation of historical trend data
(1,3,8,13,14). In light of these observa-
tions, it is possible that the observed in-
creases in self-reported diagnosed
diabetes have slightly overestimated the
true increase in total diabetes prevalence
(1). We are also reminded that, although
several studies have reported higher rates
of diagnosed diabetes in recent decades,
the NHANES data are the only national
data examining changes in total diabetes
prevalence (2).
A final implication of our findings is
that greater detection of diabetes among
the most obese will result in a higher prev-
alence of obesity among the population
with diagnosed diabetes. This is reflected
in an average increase in BMI among in-
dividuals with diagnosed diabetes from
27.3 kg/m2 in NHANES I to 33.0 kg/m2 in
NHANES 1999­2000 (36). Therefore,
controlling obesity may become an even
greater focus in diabetes management and
perhaps have implications for reducing
the incidence of obesity-related complica-
tions, including hypertension, cardiovas-
cular disease, and physical disability in
the population with diabetes.
An important caveat to our study is
that our analyses of total diabetes and the
ratio of diagnosed to undiagnosed take
the perspective of the current ADA diag-
nostic criteria (fasting glucose level 126
mg/dl) and assume these criteria were in
use throughout the surveys. In reality, di-
agnostic standards changed considerably
over this time, with no universal defini-
tions before 1979 and encouragement of
oral glucose tolerance tests in the 1980s
and 1990s, followed by reliance on fasting
glucose values and a lowering of the diag-
nostic threshold in 1997 (37). We applied
the ADA criteria retrospectively in these
analyses so that we could compare preva-
lences of undiagnosed and total diabetes
across the latter three surveys. (Oral glu-
cose tolerance test data were only avail-
able for two surveys on subsamples of
persons aged 40­74 years.) Unfortu-
nately, we lack medical record validation
of diabetes care to examine how cases
were truly diagnosed in the clinical setting
or how this could have influenced our
findings. However, the DECODE study
has shown that using the ADA criteria is
more likely to detect obese persons than
World Health Organization criteria (38).
Thus, it is conceivable that part of the
greater increase in proportion diagnosed
among the obese reflects clinicians shift-
ing to the use of fasting glucose for diag-
nostic purposes. However, we are un-
aware of data to either support or deny
this speculation.
Our study has other limitations. First,
the analysis of trends is based on estimates
of point prevalence. Estimates based on in-
cidence would be an ideal way to assess
shifts in diagnosed versus undiagnosed
diabetes because there is likely to be less
variation or confounding by differences in
disease duration at onset or by improved
survival in recent decades. A second lim-
itation is that we only had data on undi-
agnosed diabetes in the most recent
surveys. Therefore, although we observed
consistent trends in diagnosed diabetes
dating all the way back to 1960, we can
generalize only about effects on undiag-
nosed diabetes and detection since 1976.
Third, our analysis did not adjust for the
effects of shifts in race and ethnicity over
the survey years because of changes in the
way race and ethnicity were assessed. We
also lacked power to stratify our analysis
by race and ethnicity to determine, for
example, whether the growth in the Mex-
ican-American population affected our
findings. However, when we excluded
Mexican Americans from our analyses, we
found essentially no difference in our
overall findings. Finally, although our es-
timates come from large, nationally rep-
resentative surveys, our estimates of
undiagnosed diabetes, particularly in the
most recent survey, are based on relative-
ly small samples. More data to evaluate
undiagnosed diabetes will be forthcom-

ing from the National Center for Health
Statistics to allow further evaluation of
undiagnosed diabetes, but other inves-
tigators should explore these questions
using other currently available data, es-
pecially where glucose measurements ex-
tend over several decades.
In summary, we demonstrate an in-
creasing prevalence of diagnosed diabetes
that is most prominent in overweight and
obese persons and apparent increases in
diabetes detection among the most obese.
Our findings of continued high preva-
lence of undiagnosed cases indicates a
need to increase detection of diabetes
across the full spectrum of body weight.
Given the dynamic nature of the diabetes
epidemic, along with the potential to in-
crease both prevention and detection of
the disease, continuing to track trends in
both diagnosed and undiagnosed diabe-
tes will be increasingly important.
STATISTICAL APPENDIX
Use of Bayesian hierarchical models
Analyses for this study were conducted us-
ing normal hierarchical Bayesian model
with noninformative prior distributions on
model hyperparameters. A Bayesian ap-
proach was preferred because inferences do
not depend on asymptotic assumptions.
Bayesian approaches make use of prior in-
formation (or prior distributions) and syn-
thesizes this information with the data
through the use of Bayes theorem to pro-
duce an updated distribution (or posterior
distribution). Bayesian probabilities have a
direct interpretation as the probability that
the hypotheses is true.
Our Bayesian models have two levels.
At the first level, we specify a probability
distribution for the observed data. Letting
y
i denote the estimate for diabetes preva-
lence determined from survey i and 
i
2
denote the variance for y
i estimated from
SUDAAN software (Research Triangle In-
stitute, Research Triangle Park, NC), we
assume
yi  N(
i
,
i
2)
The survey means, 
i
, are assumed to
come from a linear model

i
   (ti
 t1
)  Zi
where ti
represents the midpoint year of
survey i,  represents the mean value of
the risk factor from the first survey (inter-
cept), and  represents the annual change
in the risk factor overtime. The random-
effect Zi
represents the variability in 
i
re-
maining after accounting for the linear
trend. Zi
is assumed to be distributed
N(0,2).
At the second level of our model, we
assign probability distributions to each
hyperparameter (, , and ). Normal
priors with variance of 10,000 are as-
signed to  and , whereas 1 is approx-
imated with (0.001,0.001). Combining
the prior probabilities specified at the sec-
ond level with the probability distribution
for the observed data specified at the first
level, we express knowledge about model
parameters through the posterior distri-
bution, derived using Bayes theorem.
Random draws from this posterior distri-
bution are generated through an iterative
Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulation
known as the Gibbs sampler.
We simultaneously ran three Gibbs
samplers and saved 50,000 of the 60,000
iterations from each. Model convergence
was assessed visually by inspecting trace
plots of sampled values versus iteration
number and inspecting the Gelman-
Rubin statistic for each iteration. We used
the mean of the posterior distribution of
 as our point estimate and estimated the
probability that  is negative. Significant
decreases in diabetes prevalence were de-
fined by probabilities 97.5%.
