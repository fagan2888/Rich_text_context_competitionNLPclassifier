BACKGROUND. In an effort to decrease cancer risk among the population, national
health objectives for the year 2000 included recommendations to decrease intake
of dietary fat and alcohol and increase intake of fruits, vegetables, and grains. The
purpose of this article is to assess trends in the intake of these dietary components
relative to the national health objectives.
METHODS. National food supply data and food consumption survey data were
reviewed for their appropriateness for monitoring intake trends. Recent data from
both sources are described and interpreted.
RESULTS. Americans have made modest but important improvements in their diets
in recent years and may meet the "Healthy People 2000" dietary objectives aimed
at decreasing cancer risk. Intake of fruits, vegetables, and grains are higher, and
those of fat and alcohol are lower than they were at the beginning of the decade.
These trends are consistent with recent improvements in mortality rates for those
cancer sites with the strongest associations with diet: the colon/rectum, prostate,
and breast.
CONCLUSIONS. Although the average intake of fruits, vegetables, and grain products
is higher, it should be noted that the objective represents the minimum recom-
mendations. Within each of these major food groups, further improvements can be
made. In addition, special efforts should be made to guide children toward im-
provements in their diets and to monitor the diets of children and other subgroups.

KEYWORDS: diet surveys, fruit, vegetables, grains, dietary fat, alcohol, dietary
trends, cancer.
The association between dietary factors and cancer risk has been
established for many years. In a landmark review, Doll and Peto
estimated that 35% of all cancer deaths are attributable to diet1,2 and
more recent analyses have further substantiated their claim.3­5 Fruits,
vegetables, and grains appear to be protective, whereas fat and alco-
hol appear to increase the risk for developing a number of cancers. In
light of this and other evidence supporting healthy changes in the
American diet, national health objectives for the year 2000 ("Healthy
People 2000")6­7 were developed to:
"Increase complex carbohydrate and fiber-containing foods in
the diets of people aged 2 and older to an average of 5 or more
daily servings for vegetables (including legumes) and fruits, and
to an average of 6 or more daily servings for grain products."
"Reduce dietary fat intake to an average of 30 % of calories or
less . . . among people aged 2 and older."
"Reduce alcohol consumption by people aged 14 and older to an
annual average of no more than 2 gallons of ethanol per person."

In 1992, Byers reviewed the trends in fruit, vege-
table, grain, and fat intakes leading up to the late
1980s, and discussed the relevance of these trends to
cancer prevention.8 The purpose of this article is to
extend those trend lines, using more recently available
data, and include data regarding alcohol consump-
tion.
METHODS
Data Sources
The U. S. diet is monitored through a variety of data
sources, collectively referred to as the National Nutri-
tion Monitoring and Related Research Program
(NNMRRP). These data sources include measures of
food use and nutrient availability at the retail level and
of food consumption and nutrient intake at the indi-
vidual level. Each measure has its own purposes, ad-
vantages, and disadvantages, and when examined to-
gether they begin to form a picture of dietary intakes
in this country. The logo used on all NNMRRP mate-
rials--an abstract mosaic with many pieces filled in,
yet some of them missing--conveys our current un-
derstanding of that picture.
Food Supply Data
Food supply data are aptly called "food use" or "dis-
appearance" data because they represent the quanti-
ties of foods and nutrients that disappear into the
retail distribution channels each year.9 The data are
derived by first summing together the total quantities
of foods produced in this country, inventories remain-
ing from the past year, and all imported food. Sub-
tracted from this are current year-end inventories,
exported food, and food used for nonfood purposes.
The resulting quantities of foods, reported in terms of
pounds per person per year, are assumed to be used
for human consumption. Nutrients available from the
food supply then are determined by multiplying the
nutrient value per pound times the quantity of each
food and summing each nutrient across all foods.
The word "consumption" commonly is used in
conjunction with food supply data, although it can be
misleading because the data represent consumption
in an economic sense only, not a dietary one. "Con-
sumption" in a dietary sense infers that the food is
ingested, yet food supply measurements are made
well before the point of ingestion. Estimates of food
use are made at the point of purchase and therefore
include inedible refuse such as bones, trimmable fat,
and peelings. Nutrient estimates for the food supply
represent only the edible components of foods, but
they still include nutrients that subsequently may be
lost in cooking and parts of the food that may be
thrown away or fed to pets. Thus, food supply data
represent an upper bound on the amount of foods and
nutrients ingested. They can be used to indicate
trends in consumption, but only if changes in food
production or consumer behavior over time "do not
alter the relative disparity between food disappear-
ance and food actually eaten."10 As long as these char-
acteristics of food supply data are recognized, they can
be a useful adjunct to survey data in monitoring the
nation's collective diet. In this article, they have been
examined as a source of data on trends in the con-
sumption of fruits, vegetables, and grain products.
Survey Data
Food consumption, in a dietary sense, is monitored via
surveys of individuals. Twenty-four hour dietary recalls,
in which respondents are asked to recount the foods
they ate on the previous day, are the primary method of
gathering such information in the NNMRRP. Although
representing a more direct measure of food consump-
tion than food supply data, recalls are exceedingly more
complex, and comparisons across different surveys
(even those conducted at the same point in time) can be
problematic due to methodologic and database differ-
ences.
Although the major surveys in the NNMRRP all
were designed to be nationally representative, differ-
ences in the number of days of data collection, the
sampling frames, the days of the week included, the
interviewing and coding methods, and the nutrient
databases used can all affect the results obtained dra-
matically.11 For example, when trends in nutrient lev-
els are being assessed, it is critical that the nutrient
databases used for different points in time are com-
parable, except when there were real differences in the
nutrient values of foods.12 That is, updated values
based on improved analytic methods should be sub-
stituted for outdated values in the older database, but
real differences in the food between the two time
periods, such as the level of trimmable fat on cuts of
meat, should be maintained. In addition, when food
group intakes are being monitored over time, the way
foods are quantified and grouped must be comparable
to ascertain trends. In spite of these caveats, surveys
still provide some of the most revealing data available
for piecing together a picture of the U. S. diet over
time. Furthermore, the Agriculture Research Service of
the U. S. Department of Agriculture is developing a
food composition database for trend analyses that,
according to the Expert Panel on Nutrition Monitoring
and Related Research, will address these concerns and
"provide a sound framework for comparisons of data
collected at different time points from 1985 on-
ward."13

the amount sales data would suggest.14 Because of the
social stigma associated with overconsumption of al-
coholic beverages, survey respondents may tend to
underreport their intakes. For this reason, it generally
is accepted that sales data should be used to monitor
apparent alcohol consumption.15 These data are col-
lected by the Alcohol Epidemiologic Data System. To
compare data across years with differing proportions
of beer, wine, and spirits, intakes of all these various
beverages are converted to gallons of ethanol,16 and
rates per capita are based on the population age  14
years. Although these data cannot be examined in
relation to demographic variables because they refer
to the population as a whole, they relate directly to the
health objective and are useful in monitoring trends.
RESULTS
Dietary Fat
Assessment of long term trends in fat intakes in the
U. S. has been hampered by the fact that the two
surveys conducted during the late 1970s (the NFCS
and the NHANES II) provided conflicting estimates of
fat intake as a percent of kilocalories.17 NHANES II
estimates were approximately 36% for the total popu-
lation, whereas NFCS estimates were approximately
40%. There are numerous methodologic differences
between the two surveys that could account for the
difference in estimated fat intakes.11 Since then, there
has been a concerted effort to make the data from the
two major food consumptions survey series (the
NHANES and the NFCS and related surveys) more
comparable, and recent data are more analogous.
However, the result of the earlier discrepancy is that
the two series show slightly different trends in the
percentage of kilocalories from fat. Both show a de-
cline,18­23 although the linear trend for the NHANES
series is not as significant (P  0.15 vs. P  0.01) and
appears more gradual (Fig. 1).
In contrast, food supply data imply a slight in-
crease in fat intakes in recent decades. However, over
the years, there has been an increased use of fats and
oils for frying, and much of those fats and oils
(amounts not absorbed by the food during prepara-
tion) are discarded.10 Because of this, time trends in
food supply levels of fats and other macronutrients do
not reflect survey estimates of intake, especially when
macronutrients are measured as a percentage of en-
ergy.24
Fruits, Vegetables, and Grains
Food supply data are optimal for examining long term
trends in fruit, vegetable, and grain consumption be-
cause, unlike fat, the proportion of these foodstuffs
that is discarded has not changed much over the
years, and because the basic methodology of the food
supply data has remained constant over time. Figure 2
shows these trends for 1970­1994, a period during
which all 3 groups showed statistically significant in-
creases in per capita consumption: fruits by 22%, veg-
etables by 19%, and grain products by 47% (P 
0.0001).9
Although food supply data give an indication of
long term trends in consumption of these foods, they
cannot be used to infer how close the population is to
meeting the health objective because they are not
reported in comparable terms (i.e., servings of food

objective. The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES)
series and the Nationwide Food Consumption Survey (NFCS) and related
surveys both show a decline in the percentage of kilocalories from fat, although
the NHANES trend appears more gradual. 1 One-day data from individuals ages

ingested). Only recently have estimates of fruit, vege-
table, and grain servings been based on all intakes of
these foods, including the quantities contained in food
mixtures and on food specific gram weights per serv-
ing.25­28 Average intakes by adults are shown in Figure
3 for 1989­1991 and 1994, compared with the health
objective for the year 2000. The data suggest that for
fruits, vegetables, and grains, intakes have risen sig-
nificantly (P  0.0005) since the objective was written
and that achievement of the objective appears likely.
The health objective aimed at fruits and vegeta-
bles ( 5 servings) and grain products ( 6 servings) is
derived from more specific recommendations con-
tained in the Dietary Guidelines for Americans,29
which suggest 2­4 servings of fruits, 3­5 servings of
vegetables, and 6­11 servings of grains, depending on
energy needs. That is, it generally is regarded that
there are certain optimum proportions that these ba-
sic food groups should comprise in the diet, and that
the number of servings should increase accordingly
with increasing energy needs.30 Also shown in Figure 3
are comparisons with the recommendations in cur-
rent dietary guidance (extension of bars). It appears
that intakes of fruits, vegetables, and grains will need
to continue to rise to meet even the midpoint of these
energy-based recommendations.
The proportional increases observed in these data
are not directly comparable to those observed in food
supply data because the latter are measured in
pounds, the former are measured in servings, and the
broad groups of fruits, vegetables, and grains encom-
pass a wide array of foods with varying weights per
serving. Nonetheless, the two data sources are consis-
tent in suggesting a gradual increase in the consump-
tion of fruits and vegetables in recent years.
Alcohol
Figure 4 presents national consumption trends for all
alcoholic beverages combined from 1970­1993, and
the changes needed to meet the health objective of 
2 gallons per person per year by the year 2000.16 The
1980s ushered in a period of decreased alcohol con-
sumption, the first sustained decline since Prohibition
ended. Other than a single year (1990) in which sales
rose in reaction to tax law changes, and another year
(1992) with no change, this downward trend has con-
tinued unabated (statistical significance of test for lin-
ear trend: P  0.001). The 1993 level of 2.25 gallons per
person per year was the lowest since 1964.
DISCUSSION
These data suggest Americans have made modest but
important improvements in their diets in recent years
and that, if current trends continue, they may meet
the "Healthy People 2000" dietary objectives aimed at
decreasing cancer risk. These trends are consistent
with recent improvements in mortality rates for the
cancer sites for which the strongest associations with
diet have been demonstrated: the colon/rectum, pros-
tate, and breast,31­33 although other factors such as
FIGURE 3. Servings of fruits, vegetables, and grains,1 1989­1991 and 1994,
the "Healthy People 2000" objective, and the range of recommendations in
dietary guidance. The mean number of servings of all three groups have
increased significantly since the health objective was written, and achievement
of the "Healthy People 2000" objective appears likely. However, current dietary
guidance suggests average intakes should be even higher. 1Mean daily serv-
ings for all persons age  2 years. Servings of fruits and vegetables for
1989­1991 exclude miscellaneous uses in candies, condiments, and potato
chips27; servings for 1994 were adjusted assuming a comparable proportion of
miscellaneous uses. 2Based on 3-day data from the Continuing Survey of Food
Intakes by Individuals.7 3Based on 2-day data from the Continuing Survey of
Food Intakes by Individuals.30 1994 levels are significantly greater than 1989­
1991 levels for both fruits and vegetables (P  0.0005) and grains (P 
0.0005). 4The goal of the health objective is  5 servings of fruits and
vegetables and  6 servings of grains.6 Extension of bars shows range of
recommended intakes in current dietary guidance: 2­4 servings of fruits, 3­5
servings of vegetables, and 6­11 servings of grains.31

screening and treatment also may have contributed to
the decline in mortality.
The downward trend in fat intakes described in
this article is supported by a collective analysis of data
from 171 independent studies conducted by Stephan
and Wald34 that was undertaken to examine the role of
diet in the decline in coronary heart disease mortality.
All studies of healthy individuals conducted in the
U. S. between 1920­1984, in which fat intakes were
assessed from food records, were included, except
studies including only vegetarians. The values from
each study (for fat intake as a percentage of kilocalo-
ries) were weighted by the number of persons in each
study and plotted along with a regression line. The
authors reported that fat intakes rose from approxi-
mately 34% of kilocalories in the 1930s to a high of
approximately 42% of kilocalories in the late 1950s and
then fell to approximately 36% of kilocalories in the
early 1980s. Similar trends were observed when these
analyses were repeated for separate age and gender
groups. These meta-analyses were not restricted to
studies using representative samples of the U. S., a fact
that casts some uncertainty on the generalizability of
the results. The authors included studies of very nar-
rowly defined groups, such as athletes, pregnant and
lactating women, and specific income and racial
groups. However, as the authors state, there is "no
convincing evidence that any of these conditions in-
fluences the balance of intake of the three major nu-
trients."
Because fruits, vegetables, and grains are the ma-
jor sources of dietary fiber, trends in intakes of that
dietary component further substantiate the trends in
intakes of these food groups. Data regarding intakes
by adults show an increase of 11 g to 16 g of fiber from
1989­199121 to 199422; this is an improvement but still
is below the National Cancer Institute recommenda-
tion of 20­30 g per day.35
These improvements in diet in part may be a
function of several governmental initiatives designed
to enhance the diet in these areas. In the late 1980s,
regulations concerning food advertisements were
eased to allow food producers to make more explicit
diet/health claims. A drop in the consumption of fats
and oils across the population followed this change in
the regulatory environment.36 The Nutrition Labeling
and Education Act of 199037 further promoted the
production of fat free, low fat, and reduced fat prod-
ucts.
The National Cancer Institute's partnership with
the Produce for Better Health Foundation, designed to
increase fruit and vegetable intake through the 5 A
Day for Better Health Program, has helped to encour-
age individuals to consume more fruits and vegetables
through its 1000 industry participants in the fruit
and vegetable industry, including  35,000 grocery
stores across the nation.38 In addition, there are  55
state and territorial health agencies licensed with the 5
A Day for Better Health Program. The national part-
nership works at the community level through state-
wide coalitions involving both industry and state lic-
ensees.
Although data suggest that average intakes of fruit,
vegetable, and grain products now may be sufficient
to meet the health objective, it should be remembered
that the objective represents the minimum dietary
guidance recommendations. Mean intakes should be
closer to the middle of the range, concomitant with
the range of energy intakes in the population. Further-
more, outside the realm of measuring the health ob-
jective, there is wide variation in what is considered a
fruit or vegetable. A recent report by the American
Institute for Cancer Research suggested that potatoes
prepared in any way should not be considered vege-
tables and bananas and plantains should not be con-
sidered fruits.39 Excluding potatoes, fruit and vegeta-
ble intakes averaged 3.2 servings per person per day in
1989­1991; assuming a similar proportion of vegeta-
bles were potatoes in 1994 as in the earlier years,
comparable figures for 1994 would be 3.6 servings.
Certainly, further improvements could be made
within the major food groups that were considered in
assessing progress toward meeting the health objec-
tive. Vegetable use is dominated by potato use:  50%
of the potatoes marketed in this country eventually are
eaten as french fries.9,25 Nutrient dense vegetables
such as broccoli, other dark green vegetables, and
carrots represent only a small fraction of vegetable
consumption.9
Fruit intakes, which were approximately one and
one-half servings per day in 1994,28 will need to rise to
meet even the minimum dietary guidance recommen-
dations of 2 servings per day. Not only is fruit a rich
source of fiber and nutrients, it appears to be an
important, if not indispensable, part of diets that de-
rive  30% of their energy from fat.40 It may be sim-
pler, and certainly would be more positive, to promote
increasing intakes of fruit than decreasing intakes of
fat as a percentage of energy; if the latter can be
accomplished (at least in part) with the former, that
would appear to be beneficial.
The declines observed in ethanol consumption
appear to be due largely to a sharp decrease in the use
of spirits. Per capita consumption of beer and wine
were approximately the same in 1993 compared with
the late 1970s.16
Finally, although the population on average ap-
pears primed to meet these objectives if current trends
1430 CANCER October 1, 1998 / Volume 83 / Number 7
continue, there most certainly are subgroups for
which more intensive intervention is needed. The di-
ets of children in particular warrant attention; a recent
study found that 11% of U. S. children ages 2­19 years
did not meet any of their daily food group recommen-
dations over a 3-day period and that 50% of the energy
in children and adolescents diets came from fat and
added sugars.27,41 Because diet in childhood may be
an important factor in adult dietary habits,42 efforts
should be made to guide children toward improve-
ments in their diets and to monitor the diets of chil-
dren and other subgroups.
