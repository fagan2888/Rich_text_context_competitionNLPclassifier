Why is disorganized attachment associated with punitive-controlling behavior in some,
but caregiving-controlling in others? Hygen et al. (2014) proposed that variation in
the Catechol-O-methyl transferase(COMT) Val158Met genotype explains this variation,
providing preliminary data to this effect. We offer a conceptual replication, analyzing
data on 560 children (males: 275) drawn from the NICHD Study of Early Child
Care and Youth Development. As predicted, competitive model-fitting indicated that
disorganized infants carrying Met alleles engage in more positive behavior and less
negative behavior than other children at age 5 and 11, with the reverse true of Val/Val
homozygotes, seemingly consistent with caregiving-controlling and punitive-controlling
styles, respectively, but only in the case of maternal and not teacher reports, thereby
confirmating a relationship-specific hypothesis.

INTRODUCTION
In contrast to a secure-attachment history, one of insecure attachment early in life is associated with
more problematic functioning later in development, including externalizing problems (e.g., Fearon
et al., 2010; Groh et al., 2012) and internalizing ones (e.g., Shaw et al., 1997; Brumariu and Kerns,
2010; Colonnesi et al., 2011). Among children lacking a secure attachment, the most problematic
development is usually manifested by those classified as disorganized (e.g., Carlson and Sroufe,
1995; Lyons-Ruth, 1996; Lyons-Ruth et al., 1997; Carlson, 1998; Van Ijzendoorn et al., 1999; Moss
and St-Laurent, 2001; Fearon et al., 2010).
Of note, however, is the distinctive variation in how disorganization manifests itself as children
develop beyond the infancy years. Thus, investigators have distinguished a controlling-caregiving
style from a more controlling-punitive style (see detailed description of the two disorganization
styles in Section Types of Preschool Disorganized Attachment). Such distinct patterns are thought
to be the result of differential experience with the parent and characteristics of the children
themselves, including severity of their disorganization (George and Solomon, 1998; Moss et al.,
2004; Solomon and George, 2006; Bureau et al., 2009). In the current inquiry, we consider an
alternative explanation of variation in the way children with disorganized attachment histories
Li et al. Disorganized Attachment and COMT Interaction
develop, one recently advanced by a team of mostly Norwegian
investigators--which we refer to as the "Norwegian hypothesis"
(Hygen et al., 2014). It stipulates that the genetic make-
up of the child affects how disorganization manifests itself,
highlighting in particular the Catechol-O-methyl transferase
(COMT) val158Met genotype. We thus conduct a conceptual
replication of the gene -X-disorganization interaction central
to the Norwegian hypothesis as delineated below, drawing on
data from the NICHD Study of Early Child Care and Youth
Development (NICHD Early Child Care Research Network,
2005). We regard this effort as especially important in light of
concern for the replicability of scientific findings (Jasny et al.,
2011; Ryan, 2011). Because we ourselves were skeptical about the
predictions to be tested, we planned a restricted set of analyses,
100% of which are presented here, allowing "the empirical chips
to fall wherever they may."
Types of Preschool Disorganized
Attachment
The social behavior of children develops substantially in the
period between the end of infancy and the start of school (as
well as thereafter). Whereas prosocial behavior increases notably
over this time period (Eisenberg and Fabes, 1998; Benenson
et al., 2003), physical aggression declines after peaking sometime
between 2 and 4 years of age (Tremblay et al., 2004; Côté
et al., 2006). Children with disorganized histories deviate from
typical developmental trajectories, at least with regard to behavior
directed toward their mothers, but seem to do so in two
contrasting ways (Main and Cassidy, 1988; Wartner et al., 1994;
Moss et al., 2005, 2011; O'connor et al., 2011). Those who
display the controlling-punitive style of disorganization behave
in ways that are physically threatening (e.g., aggression) and
verbally harsh and commanding. It is no wonder, then, that their
parents characterize them as aggressive, irritable, hyperactive,
unadaptive, confrontational, moody, and hard to control (George
and Solomon, 1996). One might expect them, therefore, to
manifest especially elevated levels of aggression and lower levels
of social skills (e.g., cooperation) on standard measures of social
functioning, at least when parents themselves are characterizing
child behavior.
Disorganized children judged to be controlling-caregiving
exhibit a rather different behavioral profile. They direct the
parent's activity and conversational exchanges by structuring
interactions in a helpful and/or emotionally positive manner
(Main and Cassidy, 1988; Cassidy and Marvin, unpublished
manuscript). By being exceptionally cheerful, polite, or
supportive, such children seem especially attentive to the moods
and needs of parents and motivated to protect them (Solomon
and George, 2011). Once again it is not surprising that the parents
of these disorganized children perceive them to be especially
close, adaptable, and responsible, even socially precocious, taking
responsibility for the emotional well-being of their parents. It is
also not surprising that parents as well as naïve observers might
mistakenly regard the controlling-caregiving behavior of these
children as a sign of social competence, cooperation, and positive
development. Theory and research suggest, however, that this
is a defensive posture, representing a strategy of inflating or
maximizing prosocial behavior directed toward the parent in an
effort to avoid displeasing the parent and, thereby, engendering
conflict. This latter perspective implies that the elevated levels
of positive social behavior and low levels of aggressive behavior
that one might expect to document when relying on parental
reports of these attributes reflect less social competence than
overcompensation and a means of self-protection which results
from fear of the frightening or frightened parent. There is also
the view that the family processes of parentification and role
reversal--which involve the child assuming practical and/or
emotional responsibility for the parent, including care of siblings
and managing the household--are driven by children's need to
protect the attachment system from the frequent disruptions in
the child-caregiver relationships, disruptions which themselves
derive form frightening caregiver behavior and are often
associated with impaired child psychological health (e.g., suicidal
ideation, self-harm) (Bifulco et al., 2014).
The core issue we address in the research reported herein
concerns which kindergarten-age children with disorganized
attachments in infancy manifest what would appear to be these
divergent styles of behavior, as reflected in standard measures
of social functioning. Because our focus is not on the specific
parenting that others have used to account for these two
different legacies of disorganized attachment, but rather on the
child's genotype, we next consider research on the genetics of
attachment.
The Genetics of Attachment
Behavior-genetic studies of attachment early in life have
indicated, repeatedly, that unlike so many other psychological-
behavioral characteristics, attachment security is not (apparently)
heritable (Bokhorst et al., 2003; Roisman and Fraley, 2008).
Notable as well is that molecular-genetic efforts to link candidate
genes with measures of attachment early in life have failed to
chronicle reliable associations. (Luijk et al., 2011; Mesquita et al.,
2013; Roisman et al., 2013). Despite such seemingly consistent
evidence, one can still wonder whether genetics plays a role
in how the developmental legacy of early attachment--that is,
its sequelae--is expressed. Recent research addressed this issue
of gene -X-attachment interaction in predicting later social
functioning, with four studies indicating that children carrying
short alleles in the 5-HTTLPR promoter region with histories
of insecure, but not secure attachment, underperform other
insecure children carrying long alleles on measures of autonomy
(Zimmermann et al., 2009), stress response (Gilissen et al., 2008;
Frigerio et al., 2009); and regulatory control (Kochanska et al.,
2009). Insecurely attached children also have been observed to
respond in more stressful ways than secure infants when carrying
the CC allele of the GABRA6 genotype or the Val/Val variant of
the COMT gene (Frigerio et al., 2009). A fifth study detected a
significant interaction between FKBP5 rs1360780 and insecure-
resistant attachment in predicting stress reactivity, such that
infants with this attachment history carrying one or two T-alleles
showed elevated levels of cortisol (relative to baseline) in the
Strange Situation in comparison to those lacking T alleles (Luijk
et al., 2011).

Li et al. Disorganized Attachment and COMT Interaction
More recently--and especially important to the current
inquiry--Hygen et al. (2014) predicted and documented a
significant interaction between disorganization at age 4 years--as
measured using a doll-play procedure (i.e., MCAST, Green et al.,
2000)--and COMT, on change in social behavior from age 4­6
years. It is thus a COMT-X-disorganization interaction that we
seek to conceptually replicate herein. The Norwegian team chose
to focus on the COMT polymorphism because of suggestive
evidence linking it to both disorganization and aggression (Baud
et al., 2007; Kulikova et al., 2008; Albaugh et al., 2010), the latter
being one of their core outcomes.
Notable as well is that that variation in COMT activity
influences variation in dopamine levels, particularly in the
PFC. In fact, the COMT enzyme accounts for more than 60%
of dopamine degradation in the PFC (Karoum et al., 1994).
Thus, individuals homozygous for the Val allele of COMT
Met158Val have four times as much COMT activity as Met
homozygotes, resulting in lower dopamine level in the PFC
(Lachman et al., 1996; Weinshilboum et al., 1999). It was also
as a result of these observations that the Norwegian team
assumed that children homozygous for the Val allele would
have lower levels of dopamine than Met-carrying children. This
expectation was central to their specific prediction as to how
COMT would moderate the effects of disorganization on social
functioning reflective of controlling-caregiving and controlling-
punitive behavioral styles. Also influencing their predictions was
evidence that childhood sexual abuse (Perroud et al., 2010),
or existing behavior problems, such as ADHD (Caspi et al.,
2008), forecast elevated levels of aggression and that COMT in
combination with ADHD has been linked to impaired social
understanding (Langley et al., 2010). Indeed, it was for these
reasons that they focused, as we do, too, on aggression and social
competence.
What Hygen et al. (2014) predicted--and found--was that
whereas 4-year olds who scored high on the doll-play measure of
disorganization and were homozygous for Val alleles increased in
their levels of aggression and decreased in social skills across the
transition to school, those carrying Met alleles changed in exactly
the opposite direction (i.e., decreased aggression, increased
social skills). Surprisingly, as already implied, the COMT
X disorganization interaction did not predict, as originally
anticipated by the Norwegian investigators, level of functioning
at either ages four or six, but predicted only change over time.
The latter result did prove relationship specific, as anticipated,
however, in that the gene-X-attachment interaction predicted
child behavior reported only by mothers, not by teachers.
Current Study
We sought to extend Hygen et al. (2014) research by testing
"the Norwegian hypothesis" regarding the differential and
genetically moderated developmental legacies of attachment
disorganization. Thus, consistent with the Norwegian
investigators' original hypothesis, we anticipated that the
COMT genotype would predict similarly divergent patterns of
social functioning in the case of kindergarteners classified as
disorganized in their attachments to their mothers at age 15
months, but only when maternal rather than teacher reports
of child behavior were subject to analysis; and that the just
delineated genetic moderation would not be evident in the
case of children with non-disorganized attachment histories.
We chose to focus on level of functioning at kindergarten age
rather than change in behavior over time (as the Norwegian
investigators did), because this is where the Norwegian
investigators initially expected to chronicle COMT-moderated
effects of disorganized attachment. Notably, instead of relying
on a doll-play measure of disorganization at age 4 years,
we examine disorganization assessed in the gold-standard
Strange Situation at age 15 months. And instead of focusing
upon change in behavior from age 4 to 6 years, we focus
on behavioral functioning in kindergarten, some 3.5 years
following assessment of early attachment. Furthermore, in
secondary analyses, we evaluate the COMT-X- disorganization
interactions on the same (mother- and teacher-reported) child
behavior measures in grade six to determine whether any
interaction detected at an earlier age proves evident years
later. Because of these method and design distinctions, we
regard the current inquiry as a conceptual rather than exact
replication.
In contrast to "exact replications," one can adopt less stringent
criteria and still speak of replication. A "conceptual replication,"
like the one being reported herein, may prove somewhat different
from what was done in prior work, but is yet conceptually
parallel to and informed by the work for which "replication"
is sought. The essential question becomes not whether specific
findings tied to specific measurements evaluated in a seemingly
identical sample can be repeated, but whether the more general
finding can be detected again using related, even if not exactly
the same, measurements or research design. Indeed, this is
more or less why meta-analyses are undertaken--to determine
whether, across often diverse studies using different methods and
samples, some finding emerges with some degree of reliability,
as well as what investigatory factors might affect whether or
not a finding emerges. In the research reported herein, we were
motivated to conduct what should be regarded as a conceptual
replication.
Importantly, instead of conducting a traditional--and
exploratory--analysis to determine whether the statistical
interaction of disorganization and COMT predicts parent-
and/or teacher-reported measures of aggression and social
competence in kindergarten, we employ a confirmatory and
competitive model-fitting strategy. We adopted this statistical
approach because the current work attempts to replicate
conceptually the findings of the Norway group, being based
as it is on explicit, a-priori predictions about how the data
will be patterned (see next paragraph). Thus, model fitting
depends on clearly formulated propositions as to how the data
will be organized, with the overall fit of the model being most
important, rather than one or another particular component
of the model. This approach contrasts markedly, then, to
an exploratory regression where one may even anticipate a
significant interaction but makes no commitment to what exact
form it will take, thereby requiring follow-up or decomposition
tests to illuminate the form of the interaction (Belsky et al.,
2013).

FIGURE 1 | Hypothesized COMT X disorganization interaction pattern for mother-reported positive and negative child behavior ("0" = organized;
"1" = disorganized).
Based on the original Norwegian hypothesis, this conceptual
replication specifically, directly and collectively tests the following
multiple propositions graphically depicted in Figure 1: (a)
kindergarteners with a history of disorganized attachment who
are homozygous for the Val allele will score higher on aggression
and lower on social competence, reflecting a punitive-controlling
behavioral style, than will non-disorganized/organized children;
(b) kindergarteners with a history of disorganized attachment
carrying the Met allele, will score lower on aggression and
higher on social competence, reflecting a caregiving-controlling
behavioral style than will non-disorganized/organized children;
and (c) because disorganization, by definition, refers to the nature
of a relationship that a child has with his or her caregiver, and
that children's punitive and caregiving behavior are only activated
by, and within the (parent-child) attachment system, these
differential developmental legacies of disorganized attachment
will be evident only in maternal, not teacher reports; finally (d)
children who do not have a history of disorganized attachment
will not exhibit differential aggression or social competence
outcomes as a function of their COMT gene allelic status.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Participants
Participants were recruited during the first 11 months of 1991
in 24 hospitals from 10 data- collection locations in the United
States (Charlottesville, VA; Irvine, CA; Lawrence, KS; Little
Rock, AR; Madison, WI; Morganton, NC; Philadelphia, PA;
Pittsburgh, PA; Seattle, WA; and Wellesley, MA). A total of
8986 women who gave birth in selected 24-h intervals were
screened for eligibility, and 1364 families with healthy newborns
completed a home interview when the infant was 1 month
and ultimately became participants. The study was reviewed
and approved by University of Wisconsin Internal Review

Board. More details about recruitment and selection procedure
can be found in NICHD Early Child Care Research Network
(2005).
In the current study, only children of Caucasian ethnicity
were included to avoid confounding ethnicity and gene
frequency. Among the 693 children whose genetic information
was available, 579 were Caucasian, and 19 of these children
were excluded from the analysis sample due to the missing
information on attachment security. The final sample for the
model-fitting analyses consists of 560 children (Boys: 275;
Girls: 285).
Measurements
Attachment Disorganization at 15 Months
Attachment security was measured at 15 months using the
Ainsworth and Wittig (1969) Strange Situation Procedure (SSP).
Infant attachment was classified, based on careful review of
videotapes, into one of four major categories: secure (B), avoidant
(A), resistant (C) or disorganized (D). Disorganized (D) infants
do not display a coherent strategy in the SSP. For example, they
may exhibit a mixture of avoidant and resistant behavior or
seem very confused or apprehensive upon reunion with mother.
Cases that cannot be categorized are designated as unclassifiable
(U) or missing. All SSP videotaped were later shipped to a
central location for coding. 80 children were categorized as
avoidant (A, 14.3%); 336 were assigned to the secure category
(B, 60%); 49 children were coded as resistant (C, 8.75%); 72
children were classified as disorganized (D, 12.9%), and 23
children proved unclassifiable or were missing attachment data
(21 U, 3.75% and 2 with missing code, 0.4%). In this effort to
conceptually replicate the findings of the Norwegian study, all
non-disorganized classifications were combined to create a non-
D group (N = 488)--to be compared with those classified
disorganized (N = 72)--in the primary analyses; in secondary,
sensitivity analyses, the continuous D rating was used. Each SSP
tape was coded by two coders working independently. Across
all coder pairs, agreement with the five-category classification
system was 83% (kappa = 0.69) [NICHD (Early Child Care
Research Network), 1997].
COMT
Buccal mucosa cells were collected with cotton swabs by the
subjects at 15 years of age. DNA extraction and genotyping for
the NICHD Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development
(SECCYD) were performed at the Genome Core Facility in
the Huck Institutes for Life Sciences at Penn State University
under the direction of Deborah S. Grove, Director for Genetic
Analysis. Taqman SNP Genotyping Assays were performed
using an Allelic Discrimination Assay (Applied Biosystems,
Foster City, CA) protocol. Forty nanograms of DNA were
combined in a volume of 5 microliters with 2X Universal
PCR Mix (Applied Biosystems) and 1/20 the volume of the
Taqman SNP assay in a 384 well plate. A Pre-Read was
performed and then PCR as follows: a 10 min hold at 95C,
followed by 40 to 45 cycles of 15 s at 92C and then 1 min
at 60C in a 7900HT PCR System. After amplification, a
Post-Read was performed, and automatic and manual calls
were made. The genotypes of the participants were categorized
as Val/Val (GG, N = 158, 27.3%), Val/Met (AG, N =
272, 47.0%) and Met/Met (AA, N = 149, 25.7%). The
distribution of the genotypes did not deviate from Hardy-
Weinberg equilibrium (2 = 2.10, p > 0.05). Following the
Norwegian study we are attempting to conceptually replicate, all
Met carriers (N = 421), whether Val/Met (AG) heterozygotes
or Met/Met (AA) homozygotes formed one genotypic subgroup
initially--in the primary analyses (see Data Analysis Plan
below)--to be compared with the group of Val/Val (GG)
homozygotes (N = 158). In secondary, sensitivity analyses,
subgroup scoring was modified. Collectively, then, there were
(a) 353 organized Met carriers, (b) 135 organized Val/Val
homozygotes, (c) 55 disorganized Met carriers and (d) 17
disorganized Val/Val homozygotes. Chi-square tests indicated
no association between the COMT genotype (Met carriers vs.
Val/Val) and children's disorganization classification (D vs. Not-
D) [2 (1) = 0.52, p = 0.47]. The independence between COMT
genotype and children's attachment classification--regarded as a
proxy for the environment-- indirectly ruled out the possibility
of passive gene-and-environment associations(rGE). Thus, the
Disorganization-X-COMT interaction revealed in this study
could not be attributed to the possibility that disorganized
children inherited the COMT gene from their parents who then,
in response, treated their children problematically, thus resulting
in attachment disorganization.
Aggressive Behavior: Mother-Report and
Teacher-Report
Aggressive behavior was measured using the Child Behavior
Checklist (CBCL) and the Teacher Report Form (TRF)
completed by mothers and teachers, respectively, when children
were in kindergarten. A list of 118 (CBCL)/120 (TRF) items
that includes a broad range of children's behavioral or emotional
problems was presented. For each item, the respondent was
asked to determine how well that item described the target child
currently or within the last 2 months: 0 = Not True (as far as I
know), 1 = Somewhat or Sometimes True, and 2 = Very True
or Often True. The aggressive behavior subscale score is the sum
of 20 mother-report and 25 teacher-report items, resulting in a
range of scores of 0­40 for mothers and 0­50 for teachers. A
higher score indicates greater aggressive behaviors. (Descriptive
information was presented in Table 1).
Social Competence: Mother-Report and
Teacher-Report
Social competence was assessed by 38-item mother-report and
30-item teacher-report form of the Social Skills Rating System
(SSRS) (Gresham and Elliott, 1990). Three subscale scores
derived from both of these (maternal- and teacher-report)
instruments are Cooperation (coefficients  = 0.76 (mother)/0.92
(teacher); e.g., "volunteer to help family members"), Assertion
(s = 0.69 (mother)/0.86 (teacher); e.g., "make friends easily"),
and Self-control (s = 0.80(mother)/0.87(teacher); e.g., "control
temper when arguing with other"). The longer, mother-report
instrument also includes a subscale for Responsibility ( =

Data Analysis Plan
Data analyses proceeded in three major phases: preliminary,
primary, and secondary. Preliminary analyses involved multiple
imputation of missing data (which ranged from 5.0 to 9.1%
across dependent variables) (Rubin, 1987; Schafer, 1997; Schafer
and Graham, 2002) using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo
(MCMC) imputation method to generate 100 imputed data
sets for all cases on whom COMT and disorganization data
were available. Primary analyses testing the core hypothesis
central to this inquiry were thus run 100 times, once using each
imputed data set, with results composited across these multiple
analyses. More specifically, using SAS PROC MIANALYZE,
parameter estimates were averaged across imputed datasets, with
the corresponding standard errors of the parameter estimates
calculated after accounting for the variances from sampling and
multiple imputation, according to Rubin's (1987) rule.
The second step of preliminary analysis, the results of
which are reported now, focused on data reduction. More
specifically, exploratory factor analyses were used to determine
whether the measures of child functioning could be composited
based on empirical grounds, thereby reducing the number
of statistical tests conducted and the likelihood of generating
chance results. Two rather clear factors emerged which afforded
creation of two composite measures, one of positive and one
of negative behavior. Eigenvalue of both factors were greater
than one. The first (positive-behavior) factor explained 76%
and the second (negative-behavior) factor explained 24% of
variance. Factor loadings of variables from the first factor
used to create the positive-behavior composite ranged from
0.46 to 0.91 and those from the second factor used to create
the negative-behavior composite ranged from 0.58 to 0.95.
There were no cross-loaded items within these ranges on
either factor. Thus, a Positive Behavior score was created
for mothers by summing standardized scores for cooperation,
assertion, and responsibility, though in the case of teachers,
only the first two subscales were composited (as there was
no score for responsibility). A Negative Behavior score was
created by summing standardized scores for aggression and
self­control for both maternal and teacher reports of child
behavior, with the latter variable reversed to reflect lack of self-
control.
The primary analyses tested hypotheses central to this inquiry
using a confirmatory, model-testing approach with genetic
subgroups scored as in the original Norwegian research and
with respect to the kindergarten outcome measures. This model-
fitting approach allows for direct evaluation of the overall
pattern of the data and whether it proves consistent with the
multiple hypotheses outlined at the end of the Introduction.
Specifically, the approach assumes that the difference on
outcome variables between the Met carrier and Val homozygote
groups will be significant only for children with disorganized
attachment, only in the case of parent reports and, based on
prior work, this difference should take a specific form. That is,
the difference between Met carriers and Val homozygotes on
mother-reported outcomes will be significant only for children
Frontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 6 July 2016 | Volume 7 | Article 1013
Li et al. Disorganized Attachment and COMT Interaction
with disorganized attachment, with Val homozygotes exhibiting
lower mother-reported positive-behavior and higher negative-
behavior scores than Met carriers. In contrast, children with
non-disorganized attachment (i.e., the secure, insecure-avoidant,
and insecure-resistant attachment groups) should not exhibit
different outcomes as a function of their genetic status in the case
of either mother- or teacher-reported outcomes (see Figure 1).
To instantiate these predictions, the statistical model
stipulates that:
group = 1: Y = A1 + B1X + E
group = 2: Y = A2 + B2X + E
(1)
In this model all parameters were freely estimated: A1 and A2
are the intercept for each genetic subgroup (group = 1: Met
Carrier (i.e., Val/Met and Met/Met); group = 2: Val/Val); B1 and
B2 represent the differential slope for each genetic subgroup;
and E refers to the error term. A1 should not differ from A2,
but B1 should differ--and in the hypothesized direction--from
B2. The difference between A1 and A2 is, essentially, the simple
main effect of genetic subgroup (Met vs. Val) for children with
non-disorganized attachment, and we predict that the Met and
Val subgroups will not differ for children with non-disorganized
attachment. Furthermore, the test of the difference between
B1 and B2 is a test of the genetic subgroup (Met carriers vs.
Val homozygotes) X attachment group (nondisorganized vs.
disorganized), and we predict that children with disorganized
attachment will differ significantly from their counterparts with
nondisorganized attachment as a function of their genetic make-
up--and in the hypothesized direction. Notably, the most crucial
tests of our theoretical predictions are the tests of difference
between B1 and B2, reflecting the differences of disorganized Met
carriers and Val/Val individuals from their genetic counterparts
with nondisorganized attachment. This test, together with
the model comparison described below, allowed us to assess
the overall patterning of the data. Importantly, although our
theoretical approach specified the direction of the differences
(e.g., differences between B1 and B2), the significance of the
simple slopes (e.g., B1) was not the primary prediction and thus
is not the focus of the current analyses.
Based on the equation shown above, the test of difference
between B1 and B2 is a test of the gene-X-disorganization
interaction, because statistical significance of this test is an
indicator that the regression lines differ as a function of genetic
subgroup, hence the presence of an interaction. The equation
shown above is a four-parameter equation, with parameters
of A1 and A2 and B1 and B2; we termed this model the full
model. To evaluate whether the difference between A1 and
A2 was negligible, we formulated a nested three-parameter
equation constraining A1 = A2, which we term our hypothesized
model, because the difference between non-disorganized Met
carriers and Val homozygotes is nil, but the difference between
disorganized Met carriers and Val homozygotes, reflected in the
B1 and B2 parameters, remains in the model. We also fit another
three-parameter model, termed the comparison model, in which
we constrained B1 = B2, but allowing A1 and A2 to be separately
estimated. Thus, the hypothesized model posits that the genetic
subgroups will not differ for children with non-disorganized
attachment, but they will differ for those with disorganized
attachment. Conversely, the comparison model assumes that the
genetic subgroups may differ for children with non-disorganized
attachment, but will not differ at all for those with disorganized
attachment.
We competitively evaluated the relative fit of these three
models with the Bayesian information criterion (BIC), which
can be used to evaluate the fit of non-nested models, such
as the hypothesized and comparison three-parameter models.
Lower values of the BIC indicate better fit of a model to
data. We predicted that the hypothesized model would yield
better fit to data than both the full model and the comparison
model for mother-report outcomes, but not for teacher-report
outcomes. The primary analyses also evaluated the effect sizes
of the COMT-X-disorganization interactions on kindergarten
mother-reported positive and negative behavior by magnitude
of differences (i.e., Cohen's d. http://www.campbellcollaboration.
org/resources/effect_size_input.php).
The secondary analyses involved evaluating the sensitivity of
the results which emerge from the primary analyses using (1)
outcomes measured at Grade 6 and (2) scoring genetic subgroups
and disorganization differently than in the primary analyses
when again predicting kindergarten and Grade-6 outcomes. In
the latter analyses, we left the COMT coding in its original form,
where groups 1, 2, and 3 represented persons with 0, 1, or 2 Val
alleles, respectively, and we left the disorganization rating in its
full 9-point format, coded 0 = no evidence of disorganization to
8 = highly disorganized. We then fit the following model:



group = 1: Y = A1 + B1X + E
group = 2: Y = A2 + B2X + E
group = 3: Y = A3 + B3X + E
(2)
The preceding equation is similar to Equation 1, but has slope
and intercept estimates for each of the COMT allele groups. The
model above has 6 parameter estimates--three intercepts (A1
through A3) and three slopes (B1 through B3). We also fit a linear
COMT X linear disorganization model as a 4-parameter model,
in which we constrained the intercept for group 2 to fall exactly
between the intercepts for groups 1 and 3, and a similar constraint
was places on the slope values. Because the 4-parameter linear X
linear model always had a lower BIC value, and therefore better
model fit, relative to the 6-parameter full model, we report only
results for the linear X linear model below.

Primary Analyses
Detailed results of the primary data analyses are displayed in
Table 2, but before highlighting them, it is important to consider
BIC values and thus the overall fit of the multiple models tested,
as these most directly address the overall patterning of the
data. Comparisons of the full, hypothesized, and comparison
models using the BIC statistic in the case of mother-reported
child behavior showed that the hypothesized model fit the data
best. For each of the 100 imputed data sets, the hypothesized

model had a lower (i.e., better) BIC value than the full model
on the mother-rated positive composite (BIC difference: M =
-5.57, SD = 0.36) and negative composite (BIC difference: M
= -4.51, SD = 0.46). In addition, for each imputed data set,
the hypothesized model had a lower, better BIC value than
the comparison model (positive behavior BIC difference: M =
-6.20, SD = 0.65; negative behavior BIC difference: M = -2.73,
SD = 0.52). More specifically and as graphically displayed in
Figure 2, disorganized Met carriers(Met-carriers = 0.85, p =
0.02) scored significantly higher on mother-reported positive
behavior than disorganized Val/Val homozygotes(Val/Val =
-1.01, p = 0.10) (d = 0.722; 95% CI: [0.165, 1.278]), but lower,
even if not to a significant extent, in the case of negative behavior
(i.e., Val/Val > Met carriers; d= -0.448; 95% CI: [-0.997, 0.101];
Met-carriers = -0.39, p = 0.11; Val/Val = 0.74, p = 0.11).
In contrast to the mother-reported data, although both the
hypothesized and comparison models had smaller BIC values
than the full model on the teacher-rated positive- and negative-
behavior composites, the hypothesized and comparison models
had BIC values that differed very little on these teacher-rated
composites (BIC difference positive composite: M = -0.10, SD
= 0.15; BIC difference negative composite: M = -0.24, SD =
0.30). This indicated that neither model was superior to the other
for these teacher-rated composites. As predicted, then, only in the
case of maternal-reported child behavior, did the hypothesized
model fit the data best.
The statistical foundations of the overall model-fit results just
reported are displayed in Table 2 and will now be considered.
Note first that the B1 = B2 test achieved statistical significance,
reflecting the fact that in the case of both mother-reported
positive and negative composites the genetic groups differed in
the expected direction for those with histories of disorganized
attachment. The fact that the A1=A2 test was not significant
indicates that the same difference between genetic subgroups
did not emerge for mother-reported positive and negative
composites in the case of children with organized attachment
histories. (i.e., comparing organized Met-carrier with Val/Val
individuals, for mother-rated positive composite: Cohen's d =
-0.082, 95% CI: [-0.282, 0.115]; and for Negative composite:
d = 0.135; 95% CI: [-0.063, 0.334]. Finally, no differences
in either A or in B parameters emerged in the case of teacher
reports.
In sum, even though not every anticipated difference proved
statistically significant in its own right, the patterning of the
entire corpus of data was exactly as predicted, with differences--
in the expected direction--between genetic subgroups emerging
only in the case of maternally reported data, not teacher-reported
data, and only in the case of children with a history

of disorganization, not children with organized attachment
histories. Considered together, then, the gene -X-attachment
patterns evaluated on an a-priori basis in the model-fitting
analyses appear in line with the proposition that disorganized
attachment predicts controlling-caregiving--that is overly nice--
behavior in the case of Met carriers, but controlling-punitive--
that is, overly hostile--behavior in the case of Val homozygotes.
The fact that these differential patterns of behavior were not
discerned in the case of teacher-reported outcomes suggests
that the discerned results reflect relationship-specific patterns of
functioning.
Secondary Analyses
The final set of analyses sought to evaluate the robustness of the
findings just reported by means of a series of sensitivity analyses.
Thus, to determine whether the COMT-X-disorganization
findings already reported endured over time the model-fitting
analyses just reported were rerun using the same parent- and
teacher-reported outcomes measured in 6th grade. We also
analyzed parent- and teacher-reported kindergarten and grade 6
positive and negative behavior composites when (a) COMT was
parameterized as a 3-level variable (0 = Met/Met, 1 = Met/Val,
2 = Val/Val) rather than the original 2-level variable as in the
Frontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 9 July 2016 | Volume 7 | Article 1013
Li et al. Disorganized Attachment and COMT Interaction
original Norwegian research (i.e., 0 = Met/Met and Met/Val vs. 1
= Val/Val) and (b) using the continuous D (or disorganization)
rating from the Strange Situation (N = 558) rather than the
categorical D classification when testing the predictions central
to this inquiry. Because of the three-level coding of COMT in
multiple robustness checks (i.e., kindergarten, 6th grade), we
fitted two sub-models in line with the previous model; the first of
these restrained the Met/Val subgroup parameter estimates to fall
exactly in between those for the Val/Val and Met/Met subgroups
so the gene effect would be constrained to linearity, and the
second afforded non-linear genetic effects by freely estimating the
slope of Met/Val group.
Results of these sensitivity analyses, which are presented in
Table 3 (i.e., primary analysis re-run at Grade 6) and in Table 4
(i.e., primary analysis re-run using 3-level COMT and continuous
D at both kindergarten and grade 6), proved generally in line
with those reported already (see Figures 3­5). Before reporting
these results in more detail, it should be noted that, as with the
original analyses of mother-reported kindergarten outcomes, BIC
values proved consistently smaller in the case of the hypothesized
model, with the data once again being patterned in a manner
in line with the Norwegian hypothesis. For example, in the
grade 6 models reported in Table 3, the hypothesized model
fit better than the full model in all cases, with BIC values
ranging from -4.94 (SD = 0.97) to -5.86 (SD = 0.16). For
kindergarten and grade 6 analyses in Table 4, the linear model
fit better than the full model in all cases, with BIC values
ranging from -10.74 (SD = 0.43) to -12.50 (SD = 0.08). Thus,
BIC values always supported retention of our hypothesized,
constrained models in comparison to more highly parameterized
full models.
In contrast to mother-reported data, it was never the case,
no matter (a) how the COMT and disorganization predictors
were parameterized (i.e., 2 or 3 levels) or (b) when the outcomes
were measured (i.e., kindergarten or 6th grade), that teacher
reports proved consistent with the anticipated effects for mother-
reported child functioning.
Inspection of Figure 3 indicates that disorganized Met carriers
(Met/Met, Val/Met) scored higher than disorganized Val/Val
homozygotes on mother-reported positive behavior, even if not
to a significant extent (Cohen's d = 0.439, 95% CI: [-0.109,
0.988]), with the reverse being true for mother-reported negative
composites (Met carriers < Val/Val, d = -0.526, 95% CI: [-
1.076, 0.025]). These results show the same patterns of difference
in grade 6 ratings as shown in kindergarten ratings in Figure 2.
When COMT was coded in 3-levels (i.e., Met/Met, Met/Val
and Val/Val), the best-fitting linear gene model constrained
intercept and slope estimates for the Met/Val heterozygotes to
fall exactly midway between corresponding estimates for the
homozygous groups, with results shown for mother ratings of
positive and negative composites in kindergarten and grade
6 in Figures 4, 5, respectively. This model suggests that the
gene effect may be linear, rather than nonlinear as in the
original results by Hygen et al. (2014). That is, Hygen et al.
and our analyses in Tables 2, 3 implicitly had a recessive
gene effect specified, presuming that the presence of two Val
alleles would lead to different outcomes than for the Met/Met
and Val/Met groups, the latter of which would have identical
outcomes.
The statistical foundation of the overall model fit for our
sensitivity analyses are displayed in Tables 3, 4. In Table 3,
statistical results are shown for grade 6 ratings by mothers and
teachers using the same statistical models as for kindergarten
ratings in Table 2. Inspection of results in Table 3 show that
the grade 6 results are quite similar to the kindergarten results.
The only exception is that the important test of B1 = B2 was
significant at only a trend level (p < 0.10) on the mother-
rated positive composite, although it remained significant (p <
0.05) for the mother-rated negative composite. As with the
kindergarten ratings, all parameter estimates in Table 3 for the
mother ratings were in the hypothesized direction, and none of
the results for teacher ratings approached significance.
Turning to the results of the linear COMT X continuous
disorganization analyses displayed in Table 4, findings for the
best fit linear COMT X linear disorganization model are shown.
Here, we reported parameter estimates (A1 and B1) for the
Met/Met group and corresponding estimates (A3 and B3) for
the Val/Val group; parameter estimates (A2 and B2) for the
heterozygous Val/Met group were constrained to fall directly
between corresponding values for the homozygous groups. None
of the A1=A3 tests were statistically significant for mother-
reported positive and negative behavior, revealing no differences
between allelic groups for organized children. Results for the
crucial B parameters were similar to, although not quite as strong,
as for prior analyses. Specifically, the test of equality of B values
was statistically significant for mother-rated positive composite
in kindergarten (p < 0.05, R-square explained by the interaction
term from the standard regression: mean = 0.008, SD = 0.002),
but not in grade 6 (p = 0.28; R-square for the interaction
term: mean= 0.002, SD = 0.0004). For the mother-rated negative
composite, the difference in B values was significant at trend level
in both kindergarten (p = 0.052; R-square for the interaction:
mean = 0.007, SD = 0.002) and grade 6 (p = 0.08; R-square
for the interaction: mean = 0.006, SD = 0.001). Still, all of the B
values were in the hypothesized direction. Finally, no differences
in either A or B parameters turned out significant in the case of
teacher reports.
DISCUSSION
The purpose of the current investigation was to test the
Norwegian hypothesis that the COMT genotype moderates the
developmental legacy of disorganization vis-a-vis aggression and
social competence during childhood in specific ways. Recall that
Hygen et al. (2014) hypothesized that Val/Val homozygotes with
histories of disorganization would exhibit more negative behavior
as well as less positive behavior compared with their organized
counterparts, seemingly reflecting a controlling-punitive style,
whereas Met carriers would evince just the opposite pattern,
such that those who were classified as disorganized would
exhibit less negative and more positive behavior than non-
disorganized/organized children, seemingly consistent with a
controlling-caregiving style. Moreover, they predicted that such

genetic moderation of attachment effects would not hold for
children with organized attachment histories and would only
prove evident when mothers characterized child behavior, not
teachers. Recall, too, that the Norwegian investigators found
support for their predictions only when looking at change over
time in child functioning across the transition to school rather
than at level of functioning prior to and following the school
transition.
Here we sought to carry out a conceptual rather than exact
replication of the original Norwegian hypothesis, focusing on
the prediction from attachment at age 15 months to children's
future functioning, first at the start of school and then 6 years
later. In contrast to the Norwegians' reliance on a doll-play
procedure administered at age four to measure disorganization,
we employed the gold standard, Strange Situation at 15 months,
relying on both the categorical and continuous measurement of
disorganization. And, drawing on data from the NICHD Study
of Early Child Care and Youth Development, we employed
a confirmatory and competitive model-fitting approach that
directly tested the anticipated and complex patterning of data
predicted by the Norwegian hypothesis, while contrasting the
hypothesized model with alternative ones (i.e., full and the
comparison models). Of most importance, then, was not whether
one or another component of the complex model was itself
statistically significant, but whether the overall patterning of
the data collectively proved consistent with predictions derived
from the Norwegian hypothesis--and whether it did so when
alternative parameterizations of disorganization and COMT were
used.
Model-fit statistics, including those derived from robustness
checks, like inspection of the graphs presented in the
figures, indicated that Val/Val homozygotes with histories
of disorganization in infancy exhibited--or tended to exhibit--
more negative behavior as well as less positive behavior in
kindergarten (as reported by mother) compared with their
organized counterparts, seemingly reflecting a controlling-
punitive style. In contrast, Met-carriers displayed--or tended
to display--just the opposite pattern, such that those who
were classified as disorganized in infancy exhibited less
mother-rated negative and more positive behavior than non-
disorganized/organized children, seemingly consistent with a
controlling-caregiving style. Just as importantly, genetic-group
differences did not emerge in the case of children with organized
attachment histories, nor did any genetic-group differences
emerge in the case of teacher reports of child behavior for
either non-disorganized or disorganized children. Notably,
this complex patterning of results emerged quite similarly
regardless of whether COMT was coded as a 2-level variable

be right in the middle between the corresponding values for the homozygous (i.e., Met/Met and Val/Val) groups. Tabled values are as follows: Estimate (SE) = point estimate of the

(Met carrier vs. Val/Val) or 3-level variable (Met/Met vs. Met/Val
vs. Val/Val), whether disorganization was coded categorically (D
vs. not D) or continuously (using the D rating), and whether
child behavior was predicted at kindergarten or Grade 6. To
be noted, however, is that even with the large sample available
for analysis, there were only a limited number of children with
disorganized attachment histories. This resulted in even smaller
subgroups of disorganized children when genotype was taken
into consideration. In light of this limitation of small cell sizes,
it seems notable that results proved strikingly similar when
the continuous measure of disorganization was used in the
secondary analyses.
The data from the both the primary and sensitivity analyses
fit the Hygen et al. (2014) hypothesis that COMT would
moderate the effect of attachment disorganization in a manner
that could account for the divergent ways in which children
manifesting disorganized attachments have been found to behave
toward their mothers (controlling-caregiving vs. controlling-
punitive). Having said that, it should be appreciated that the
actual effect size of the COMT-X-disorganization interaction
was small in magnitude at both kindergarten and 6th grade.
Given that the interaction was anticipated and that GXE
findings have proven challenging to replicate, even conceptually,
we regard the results as meaningful. Nevertheless, what
remains difficult to understand is why the targeted COMT-
X-disorganization interaction only predicted change over time
in the original Norwegian research and not levels of child
behavior at either 4 or 6 years. Here, though, we found
in our primary analyses that when disorganization was (a)
measured categorically rather than continuously, (b) using
the gold-standard Strange Situation rather than a story-stem
completion task, and (c) at 15 months rather than at 4 years
of age, that levels of kindergarten social behavior reported
(only) by mothers could be accounted for by considering the
moderation by COMT of attachment disorganization. Quite
conceivably, these measurement and design differences across
studies are responsible for the differences in findings across the
two studies.
In any event, reasonably consistent support for the Norwegian
hypothesis emerged in both inquiries as to why some children
with disorganized attachment histories behave in seemingly
controlling-caregiving and others in controlling-punitive ways.
Especially notable, perhaps, is that in both studies the genetically-
related divergent patterns of functioning are restricted to

maternal reports of child behavior, thereby underscoring the
relationship-specificity of disorganized attachment, at least when
examined from the perspective of a gene -X-disorganization
interaction. This could reflect the frightening experiences
that children with disorganized attachment histories have
had with their parents, but not with their teachers (e.g.,
Van Ijzendoorn et al., 1999; David and Lyons-Ruth, 2005).
Alternative explanation of these relationship-specific findings)
is that the detected gene -X-disorganization interaction might
actually reflect passive gene -X-environment association. Recall,
however, that this rGE possibility was discounted in the
current study in that we (a) ruled out the association
between Disorganization category (D vs. Not-D) and COMT
genotype (Met carriers vs. Val/Val) and (b) detected no
association between parent behavior (i.e., maternal sensitivity
at both 6 and 15 months) and child COMT genotype
(two levels and three levels) (see Supplemental Material,
Table 1).
It is important to appreciate that our focus on COMT
should not be read to imply that only this polymorphism may
play a moderating role vis-à-vis the effects of disorganization.
Rather, we focused exclusively on this candidate gene because
we conceptualized this inquiry from its inception as an attempt
to test an intriguing and most original hypothesis and, thereby,

conceptually replicate and extend the work of Hygen et al.
(2014). Moreover, it would be a mistake to presume that it is
the action of COMT per se that accounts for the moderation
detected, because COMT could function--statistically--as a
moderator in this inquiry due to its association with some other
gene that plays a truly functional role. Nevertheless, the fact
that the COMT Val158Met gene regulates the degradation of
dopamine in the PFC (Karoum et al., 1994; Lachman et al.,
1996; Weinshilboum et al., 1999), thereby affecting dynamic
dopamine metabolism in this brain region, provides biological
plausibility as to why variation in COMT appears to account
for variation in the functioning of children with histories of
disorganized attachment, at least from the perspective of their
mothers.

CONCLUSION
Recent years have witnessed an outpouring of concern regarding
the replicability of scientific findings (Jasny et al., 2011; Ryan,
2011). Perhaps nowhere has this issue emerged so forcefully
in the human behavioral sciences as in research involving
measured genes. Our current inquiry was motivated precisely
by this concern for replication, which includes "conceptual
replications" like that carried out here. That is, our replication
of Hygen et al. (2014) did not involve repeating exactly what
was done in their prior work; instead, it was directly informed
by the Hygen et al. (2014) study in terms of structuring a
research question, hypotheses, and analyses, albeit with certain
variables that differed operationally, but not conceptually, from
the Norwegian research. Indeed, we jumped at the opportunity
to test the Norwegian hypothesis involving the interaction of
one candidate gene, COMT, and disorganization once the initial
test of it received some support. We regarded conceptual--as
opposed to exact--replication as important because the real issue
is not simply--or only--whether specific findings tied to specific
measurements evaluated in a seemingly identical sample can be
repeated, but whether the more general finding can be detected
again using related, even if not exactly the same, measurements
or design. Indeed, it is exactly this reasoning that undergirds
virtually all meta-analyses.
It would, of course, be mistaken to claim that our conceptual
replication of the Hygen et al. (2014) inquiry entirely resolves
the issue of why some disorganized children develop in one
way--or at least develop certain kinds of relationships with their
mothers which take one form--rather than another. Indeed, the

fact that variation in COMT accounts for some variation in how
disorganized infants develop should not be read to imply that
other factors, including perhaps especially, parental behavior,
are not important. We would strongly encourage investigators
to adopt, as we have endeavored to, statistical techniques that
directly fit the statistical glove to the theoretical/conceptual hand
rather than opting for more traditional exploratory approaches.
