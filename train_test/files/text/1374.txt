OBJECTIVE -- Increasing rates of type 2 diabetes worldwide suggest that diabetes may be
caused by environmental toxins. Cadmium is a widespread environmental pollutant that accu-
mulates in the pancreas and exerts diabetogenic effects in animals. To test the hypothesis that
exposure to cadmium is associated with impaired fasting glucose and type 2 diabetes, we
examined the associations between urinary cadmium and the prevalence of impaired fasting
glucose (prediabetes) and diabetes in the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey (NHANES III).
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS -- We analyzed data on 8,722 adults 40 years
of age from the NHANES III (1988­1994), a cross-sectional health survey of a nationally
representative sample of the noninstitutionalized civilian U.S. population. We studied urinary
levels of cadmium (adjusted for urine creatinine) in relation to the prevalence of impaired fasting
glucose and diabetes, using the criteria of the American Diabetes Association.
RESULTS -- After adjustment for age, ethnicity, sex, and BMI, the odds of impaired fasting
glucose and diabetes increased dose-dependently with elevations in urinary cadmium from
0­0.99 to 1.00­1.99 and 2 g/g creatinine (impaired fasting glucose, odds ratio [OR] 1.48,
95% CI 1.21­1.82 and OR 2.05, 95% CI 1.42­2.95; diabetes, OR 1.24, 95% CI 1.06­1.45 and
OR 1.45, 95% CI 1.07­1.97).
CONCLUSIONS -- In this large cross-sectional study, urinary cadmium levels are signifi-
cantly and dose-dependently associated with both impaired fasting glucose and diabetes. These
findings, which require confirmation in prospective studies, suggest that cadmium may cause
prediabetes and diabetes in humans.

Increasing rates of type 2 diabetes in the
U.S. and worldwide suggest that diabe-
tes may be caused by environmental
factors (1). For example, epidemiologic
studies have implicated arsenic as a pos-
sible cause of type 2 diabetes, and a role
for other environmental toxins is strongly
suspected (2). Recently, we reviewed ev-
idence indicating that exposure to the
heavy metal cadmium is a cause of pan-
creatic cancer (3). Because pancreatic
cancer and type 2 diabetes are known to
be associated (4), we wondered if type 2
diabetes is also associated with cadmium.
Cadmium is an environmental pollut-
ant with a biological half-life in the whole
body exceeding 10 years. Cadmium levels
in the body accumulate with age, as only a
minute part of the body burden (0.01­
0.02%) is excreted per day. The urinary
excretion of cadmium is proportional to
the body burden and is widely used as a
dosimeter of lifetime exposure (5,6). We
used the publicly available data collected
in the Third National Health and Nutri-
tion Examination Survey (NHANES III)
to examine the associations between uri-
nary cadmium and impaired fasting glu-
cose and diabetes.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND
METHODS -- The National Center
for Health Statistics of the Centers for Dis-
ease Control and Prevention conducted
the NHANES III in 1988­1994 in a na-
tionwide probability sample of 39,000
noninstitutionalized U.S. civilians aged 2
months and older (7,8). Information on
demographic characteristics, ethnicity,
and medical history of diabetes was ob-
tained in a household interview. Informa-
tion on history of diabetes included
questions about prior diagnoses of diabe-
tes by a physician and current use of in-
sulin and oral hypoglycemic agents. In
addition, women were asked whether the
diagnosis had been made during preg-
nancy and whether they had been diag-
nosed with diabetes at some time other
than pregnancy. Blood and urine speci-
mens were obtained during physical ex-
amination. Urine was collected as a "spot"
or untimed sample. Studies of timed urine
specimens indicate that urinary cadmium
levels do not show significant diurnal
variation (9) and that urinary cadmium in
spot specimens is well correlated with uri-
nary cadmium detected in 12-h and 24-h
specimens (10).
Plasma glucose, measured using a
modified hexokinase enzymatic method
(8), was used to classify participants un-
der the headings "normal," "impaired
fasting glucose," and "diabetes." Subjects
with serum cotinine 10 ng/ml and who
reported smoking fewer than 100 ciga-
rettes in their lifetimes were classified as
nonsmokers; otherwise, subjects were
classified as ever-smokers. Serum cotin-
ine was measured using high-perfor-
mance liquid chromatography coupled
with an atmospheric pressure chemical
ionization tandem mass spectrometer
(11). Urine cadmium was measured by
Zeeman effect graphite furnace atomic ab-
sorption (12), and urine microalbumin

was measured using a solid-phase fluores-
cence immunoassay (13). To adjust for
variation in the diluteness of urine, uri-
nary cadmium levels were expressed as
urine cadmium/urine creatinine (g/g).
Details regarding the laboratory proce-
dures for these tests are published else-
where (8).
Subjects were categorized as having
impaired fasting glucose (IFG) and diabe-
tes based on fasting (8- to 24-h) plasma
glucose (FPG) levels in accordance with
the criteria of the American Diabetes As-
sociation (14). IFG was defined as 110 
FPG  126 mg/dl; diabetes was defined
as FPG 126 mg/dl and/or current use of
insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents.
We restricted the analysis to adults 40
years of age and older to exclude cases of
type 1 diabetes, which is etiologically dis-
tinct from type 2 diabetes. After excluding
those with missing values, we analyzed
data for the 8,722 subjects for whom
there were complete records. We quanti-
fied the associations between urinary cad-
mium and IFG, diabetes, and the
combined outcomes (IFG  diabetes) by
estimating odds ratios (ORs) and calculat-
ing 95% CIs by logistic regression. The
cadmium concentration in urine was cat-
egorized in three levels: 0­0.99 (refer-
ence), 1­1.99 (exposure level I), and 2
g/g creatinine (exposure level II). Expo-
sure levels I and II were modeled as two
indicator variables. The ORs were ad-
justed for age, race, sex, and BMI. The
relationship between urinary cadmium
(g/g creatinine) and smoking (ever-
smokers versus nonsmokers) was exam-
ined using the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney
test.
RESULTS -- The prevalence of IFG,
diabetes, and the combined outcomes
(IFG  diabetes) were positively associ-
ated with urinary cadmium in a dose-
dependent manner (Table 1). The odds of
the combined outcomes increased by
30% at each level of urinary cadmium.
The magnitudes of these associations
were slightly higher for IFG than for dia-
betes. Similar effects were observed when
urinary cadmium was modeled as a con-
tinuous variable; the ORs associated with
an increase of 1 g/g creatinine were 1.19
(95% CI 1.08­1.31) and 1.11 (95% CI
1.03­1.20) for IFG and diabetes,
respectively.
Because cadmium is known to exac-
erbate renal damage in diabetes (15), re-
nal damage could cause cadmium to leak
into urine, leading to a (noncausal) asso-
ciation between cadmium and diabetes.
We therefore restricted the analysis to
persons without laboratory evidence of
renal damage, using a standard cut-point
of urine albumin, 30 g/ml, as de-
scribed by Paschal et al. (6). This restric-
tion did not appreciably affect our
findings (Table 2). Thus, the higher levels
of cadmium in the urine of persons with
IFG and diabetes do not appear to be the
result of renal impairment.
Apart from occupational exposure to
cadmium (which should be rare in this
cohort), the major source of cadmium ex-
posure among nonsmokers is the diet
(16). Among smokers, the major source
of cadmium exposure is cigarettes. As has
been observed repeatedly (6,16), urinary
cadmium levels were significantly higher
among ever-smokers: the mean levels of
urinary cadmium were 0.92 and 0.63
g/g creatinine (ever-smokers versus
nonsmokers; P  0.0001). We examined
the prevalence of the combined outcomes
(IFG  diabetes) in ever-smokers and
nonsmokers. Despite small variations in
effect size at the different levels of expo-
sure, the associations were apparent in
both groups (Table 3). Thus, regardless of
the source of exposure, diet or cigarettes,
higher levels of cadmium in urine were
associated with increases in the odds of
IFG and diabetes. Finally, we tested the
association between smoking and the
combined outcomes: the OR adjusted for
age, race, sex, and BMI was 1.12 (95% CI
1.00­1.25).
CONCLUSIONS -- To our knowl-
edge, this is the first report of an associa-
tion between cadmium exposure and
both IFG and type 2 diabetes. Because this

Exposure levels I and II were modeled as two indicator variables. Odds ratios were adjusted for age (continuous), sex, ethnicity (non-Hispanic blacks, Mexican
Americans, and others vs. non-Hispanic white), and BMI (continuous). Normal fasting glucose, IFG, and diabetes were defined according to the criteria of the
American Diabetes Association: FPG  110 mg/dl, 110  FPG  126 mg/dl, and FPG  126 mg/dl or current use of insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents,
respectively. The P value for trend was obtained from logistic model with ordinal variable for the levels of urinary cadmium: reference level, exposure level I, and
exposure level II.

association is observed among persons
without evidence of renal damage and
among persons with IFG (i.e., prediabe-
tes), these data suggest that exposure to
cadmium precedes the development of
diabetes. In addition, we observed a small
association between smoking, as mea-
sured by serum cotinine, and the com-
bined outcomes (IFG  diabetes). This
finding is consistent with several (but not
all) prospective studies of smoking and
type 2 diabetes (17) and with the results
of a large cross-sectional study that found
a significant association between smoking
and glycosylated hemoglobin (18).
In rats and mice, cadmium damages
pancreatic -cells, reduces glucose toler-
ance, and is diabetogenic (19­22). Our
analyses suggest that cadmium may have
similar effects in humans. However, it is
important to emphasize that these results
were obtained in a cross-sectional study
in which exposure and disease were mea-
sured at the same time. A prospective
study, in which cadmium levels are deter-
mined before the development of disease,
will be required to establish a causal basis
for these associations.
