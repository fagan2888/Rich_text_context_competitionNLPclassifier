Abstract
Recent studies have found mixed results regarding the association between leukocyte telomere
length (LTL)--thought to be a marker of cellular aging--and all-cause mortality. Some studies have
reported a significant inverse relationship, but others have not, perhaps in part owing to insufficient
power. We examine the relationship using data from a nationally representative sample of older
Taiwanese (54+ in 2000), which is larger (n = 942) than most previous studies, and which includes
comprehensive information on potential confounders including white blood cell distribution and
inflammatory markers. Results from a Cox hazards model demonstrate a small, but significant,
association between LTL and mortality that is independent of age, sex, and lifestyle factors. White
blood cell distribution, especially the proportion of neutrophils, is an important predictor of LTL;
however, the association between LTL and mortality changes little controlling for white blood cell
distribution. In contrast, the association between LTL and mortality weakens considerably (by
48%) after adjustment for inflammatory markers and homocysteine. Our results suggest that the
relationship between short telomeres and mortality is tied to inflammation and homocysteine.
Longitudinal studies are needed to explore bidirectional influences resulting from the fact that
inflammation leads to shorter leukocyte telomeres, which in turn results in senescence, which
exacerbates inflammation.
Key Words: Mortality--Telomeres--Biological aging--Taiwan--Inflammation
Telomeresthe repetitive deoxyribonucleic acid sequences at
the end of chromosomes that protect them from fusion and deg-
radation (1)shorten with cell replication and oxidative damage.
Eventually, telomeric deoxyribonucleic acid reaches a critical mini-
mum length and fails to cap the end of the chromosomes, triggering
the cell to stop dividing (ie, replicative senescence) (2). Cell senes-
cence is believed to contribute to aging (3), which has led to the
hypothesis that telomere shortening has a causal effect on mortal-
ity. Alternatively, shorter telomeres might be simply an indicator of
other processes that affect aging and mortality. Scientists generally
agree that shorter leukocyte telomere length (LTL) is associated with
older age, male sex, Caucasian race, and possibly atherosclerosis
(4,5). However, there is controversy regarding the association of LTL
with other diseases of aging and with mortality, and the crucial ques-
tion of whether shortening of the telomeres is a cause or a symptom
of aging remains unanswered.
We have identified 13 studies that investigated the relation-
ship between LTL and all-cause mortality in population-based
samples: five found a significant inverse relationship (longer LTL
was associated with lower mortality) (6­10); the other eight did
not (11­18). Among three other studies based on twin samples,
only one found a significant inverse association (19­21). Given
the substantial variation in LTL between individuals of similar age
and health status, a large sample is required to draw meaningful
conclusions (22). Only 5 of these 16 studies comprised at least
1,000 respondents with 250 or more deaths (7,9,10,14); three of
these five reported a significant inverse association between LTL
and mortality.
The extent of adjustment for potential confounders also varied
considerably across the 16 studies. Many factors can influence both
LTL and mortality (Figure 1), confounding the association between
LTL and mortality and contributing to misleading results. The most
consistent predictors of LTL are age, sex, and race (5). Other fac-
tors that have been shown, albeit inconsistently, to influence LTL
include lifestyle factors such as smoking, physical activity, alcohol
consumption, psychological stress, and socioeconomic status, as
well as biological factors (eg, obesity, hypertension, cholesterol) and
inflammatory markers (eg, interleukin-6 [IL-6] and C-reactive pro-
tein [CRP]) (5). The mechanisms that link these factors with LTL
are complex and not completely understood. As shown in Figure 1,
telomeres shorten because of cell replication and oxidative stress,
two biological processes that are direct consequences of chronic
inflammation (23). Thus, factors that lead to chronic inflammation,
such as obesity and smoking, could indirectly cause telomere short-
ening. Importantly, however, telomere shortening can also cause
inflammation via the induction of senescence. Cells with critically
short telomeres enter senescence, a state of permanent replication
arrest in which cells secrete numerous proinflammatory cytokines,
chemokines, growth factors, and proteases known as the senescence-
associated secretory phenotype (3). Thus, the relationship between
inflammation and LTL is likely to be bidirectional: telomere short-
ening leads to inflammation via the senescence-associated secretory
phenotype, and chronic inflammation contributes to further tel-
omere shortening via oxidative damage and faster turnover of leu-
kocytes and hematopoietic stem cells. Lifestyle and biological health
risk factors could contribute to this deleterious cycle at different lev-
els (eg, producing chronic inflammation or oxidative stress) that are
directly or indirectly linked to telomere shortening. However, these
factors may also affect aging and mortality via alternative pathways
independent of telomere shortening. For example, lifestyle factors
can lead to chronic systemic low-grade inflammation and, in turn,
oxidative stress, both of which can­independently of their effects
on telomeres­produce metabolic syndrome, deoxyribonucleic acid
damage, and endothelial dysfunction that contribute to cardiovascu-
lar disease and other diseases of aging (24­26).
Thus, adjusting for confounders is fundamental to understanding
the true association between LTL and mortality. Only 5 of the prior 16
studies adjusted for smoking (7,9,16,18,21); even fewer controlled for
physical activity, obesity, alcohol use, socioeconomic status, inflamma-
tion, glucose, or high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Because inflam-
mation may be a consequence of telomere shortening, controlling for
inflammation may lead to an underestimate of the overall effect of
LTL on mortality. On the other hand, failure to control for inflam-
mation may result in an overestimate of the effect of LTL because of
confounding.
The distribution of leukocyte (white blood cell [WBC]) subtypes
may affect LTL because LTL measurement is essentially a weighted
average across a mix of different cell types. Although highly corre-
lated, different WBC subsets have different telomere lengths (27­29).
The distribution of WBC subsets varies with age and other factors
such as the presence of acute infection or underlying disease. Thus,
differences in the distribution of WBC subtypes could confound the
results. For example, someone who is ill is likely to have a very high
proportion of neutrophils. Because neutrophils tend to have longer

Chronic inflammation could be a confounder but also a mediator, since shorter telomeres lead to chronic inflammation through the induction of the SASP

HSC = hematopoietic stem cells; IGF-1 = insulin-like growth factor-1; SASP = senescence-associated secretory phenotype; SES = socioeconomic status. *In
this study, we include the following inflammatory markers: leukocyte count and distribution, interleukin-6, C-reactive protein, soluble intercellular adhesion
molecule 1, and soluble E-selectin.

telomere lengths than lymphocytes (28), such a person may have
longer average LTL simply because of the WBC distribution. Yet,
despite longer LTL, s/he may have a higher risk of mortality owing
to underlying illness that increases the risk of death even while it
inflates LTL (via its effect on the WBC distribution). None of the
prior population-based studies adjusted for the distribution of WBC
subtypes as a potential confounder.
In this study, we use data from a nationally representative sam-
ple of older Taiwanese to investigate the association between LTL
and all-cause mortality. This dataset offers a large sample with a
long follow-up periodnearly 1,000 respondents, more than 300
of whom died over 11 years. We control for the distribution of WBC
subtypes (ie, lymphocytes, monocytes, neutrophils, eosinophils,
basophils) as well as other potential confounders including demo-
graphic characteristics, lifestyle and biological health risk factors,
and inflammatory markers. We have made a comprehensive effort
to identify the possible biological associations between these factors,
telomere length, and mortality, as represented in Figure 1. This inte-
grative approach coupled with rigorous modeling has allowed us to
determine the main predictors of LTL and to analyze and interpret
their confounding influences on the association between LTL and
mortality.
Methods
Data
The 2000 Social Environment and Biomarkers of Aging Study com-
prises a nationally representative sample of persons 54 and older in
Taiwan, selected randomly using a multistage sampling design with
oversampling of older persons (71+) and urban residents (30). In
2000, in-home interviews were completed with 1,497 respondents,
1,023 of whom also completed a physical examination. Exam par-
ticipants did not differ significantly from nonparticipants in ways
likely to introduce serious bias (31). Details regarding response rates
are provided elsewhere (30). The study protocol was approved by
human subjects committees in Taiwan and at Georgetown University
and Princeton University.
On a scheduled day several weeks after a household interview,
participants collected a 12-hour overnight urine sample (7 pm to 7
am), fasted overnight, and visited a nearby hospital the following
morning where medical personnel drew a blood specimen and took
blood pressure and anthropometric measurements. Compliance was
extremely high: 96% fasted overnight and provided a urine speci-
men deemed suitable for analysis.
Survival status was ascertained by linkage to the Death
Certificate file maintained by the Taiwan Department of Health and
to the Household Registration file maintained by the Ministry of the
Interior. After excluding 47 respondents who were missing LTL and
another 34 individuals with missing data for a covariate, the analysis
sample comprised 942 respondents (322 of whom died by December
31, 2011).
Measures
Average LTL
Leukocyte deoxyribonucleic acid was extracted by Union Clinical
Laboratories (in Taiwan) using trimethyl ammonium bromide salts
(dodecyl trimethyl ammonium bromide and cetyl-trimethyl-ammo-
nium bromide). LTL, represented by the telomere-to-single copy gene
(T/S) ratio, was measured at the University of Washington, using
quantitative polymerase chain reaction with a few modifications
from the method originally developed by Cawthon (32,33) (see
Supplementary Material for details).
Potential confounders
We adjusted for a range of potential confounders that prior stud-
ies suggest affect LTL and are likely to affect mortality. These con-
founders (shown in bold italics in Figure 1) can be divided into four
categories: demographic characteristics, lifestyle factors, inflam-
matory markers, and other biological parameters. Demographic
characteristics included age and sex. Lifestyle factors comprised
smoking history, physical activity, alcohol consumption, and educa-
tional attainment. Inflammatory markers included WBC count and
distribution, IL-6, CRP, soluble intercellular adhesion molecule 1
(sICAM-1), and soluble E-selectin. We adjusted for the distribution
of WBC subtypes using the percentages of monocytes, neutrophils,
basophils, and eosinophils; % lymphocytes served as the reference
group. IL-6 had an extremely skewed distribution; log-transformed
values improved model fit. The remaining biological parameters
included obesity, pulse pressure, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol,
glucose metabolism, homocysteine, and insulin-like growth factor
1 (IGF-1). Obesity was measured by body mass index and a quad-
ratic term was included to allow for the well-established nonlinear
association with mortality (34). Pulse pressure was measured as the
difference between systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and glucose
metabolism as the level of glycosylated hemoglobin. Homocysteine
is a nonprotein -amino acid found in blood that is an indicator
of cardiovascular disease (35). IGF-1 promotes proliferation, cell
growth, and survival. Low levels of IGF-1 are associated with short
telomeres and with age-related diseases (36,37).
Analytical Strategy
In the initial stage of analysis, we examined the predictors of LTL
with four nested linear regression models. First, we adjusted for sex,
age, and, in order to compensate for the sampling design, urban resi-
dence. Next, we added the distribution of WBC subtypes. Third, we
added education and smoking history, which we consider to be exog-
enous predictors (ie, unlikely to be a consequence of LTL). Finally,
we added the remaining behavioral and biological measures, which
may be endogenous (eg, both a cause or consequence of LTL owing
to the fact that short telomeres lead to inflammation and illness that,
in turn, affect behavior and biomarker levels). Although lifestyle fac-
tors are likely to influence LTL via their effects on inflammation and
other biological processes (as shown in Figure 1), it is impossible to
establish the causal direction in a cross-sectional study. For example,
sick people are less likely to exercise and may abstain from alco-
hol consumption because of their illness. These effects can inflate
the apparent association between behavior and mortality. Thus, we
add potentially endogenous confounders to the model last because
the inclusion of endogenous variables would bias the coefficients
(including the one for LTL).
In the second stage, we examined survival as a function of LTL.
First, we calculated survival curves by long versus short LTL, split
at the median. Next, we estimated a Cox hazards model with age
as the "clock" to predict age-specific death rates adjusted for poten-
tial confounders. This modeling approach allows the underlying
baseline hazard over age to assume whatever functional form best
fits the data (ie, the log hazard is not constrained to be linear over
age). Because age is likely to be a stronger predictor of mortality
than duration of study, this model is superior to the conventional
approach, which includes a control for age and uses duration of

study as the time metric. Initial tests (data not shown) showed no
significant evidence that the age slope of mortality varied by sex.
However, because there was evidence of nonproportional hazards
for education (ie, the association with mortality was attenuated at
older ages), we modeled education as a linear function of age. The
models were fit in five stages: the first four models follow the same
strategy described above for models predicting LTL; a fifth model
demonstrates that changes in the coefficient for LTL are attribut-
able primarily to selected covariates. That is, because we observed
an attenuation in the coefficient for LTL in model 4, we estimated
model 5 to demonstrate the minimal set of confounders that account
for the attenuation.
The analyses were performed using Stata 12.1 (38). In all models,
we used the robust estimator of variance to correct standard errors
for clustering by primary sampling unit. In order to compare effect
size across predictors, we standardized (mean = 0 and SD = 1) each
of the continuous measures prior to fitting the models.
Results
Descriptive statistics are shown in Supplementary Table S1.
About 30% of the sample died by the end of 2011 (average
follow-up = 10.7 years).
As expected, LTL declines with age (correlation coefficient r = -.20,
p < .001, two sided, Supplementary Figure S1a). The distribution of
WBC subtypes also varies by age: % neutrophils increases with age
(r = .19, p < .001, two sided, Supplementary Figure S1b), whereas
% lymphocytes declines with age (r = -.20, p < .001, two sided,
Supplementary Figure S1c). Granulocytes (ie, neutrophils, basophils,
and eosinophils) have longer telomeres than lymphocytes, particularly
at older ages (28). Therefore, the shift to a higher proportion of neu-
trophils at older ages could attenuate the age-related decline in LTL.
Table 1 shows the results from models predicting LTL. As
expected, LTL declines with age ( = -0.19, 95% confidence interval
[CI]: -0.28, -0.11) and is greater for women than men ( = 0.20,
95% CI: 0.03, 0.37) (Model 1). With adjustment for WBC distri-
bution (Model 2), the age-related decline becomes slightly stronger
( = -0.21, 95% CI: -0.30, -0.12). Higher % neutrophils is associ-
ated with longer LTL, whereas higher % eosinophils is associated
with shorter LTL. After adjustment for all covariates (Model 4), the
significant predictors of LTL are age, neutrophils, and levels of IL-6.
The survival curves for the top versus bottom half of the LTL
distribution are presented in Supplementary Figure S2. Individuals
with longer LTL show a survival advantage relative to those with
shorter LTL (p ~ .004).
Table 2 shows hazard ratios (HRs) from models predicting age-
specific death rates. In the model that adjusts only for age, sex, and
urban residence (Model 1),we find an inverse association between LTL
and mortality (HR = 0.89 per SD, 95% CI: 0.81, 0.98). With adjust-
ment for WBC distribution (Model 2), the HR for LTL barely changes.
Inclusion of education and smoking history has no discernable influ-
ence on the coefficient for LTL (Model 3).Yet, with the addition of the
remaining covariates (Model 4), the HR for LTL weakens (HR = 0.93,
95% CI: 0.87, 1.00), representing a 48% reduction in the effect size
compared with Model 2 (ie, the coefficient--which is the log of the
HR--changes from -0.133 in Model 2 to -0.069 in Model 4). This
attenuation is almost entirely attributable to the addition of inflam-
matory markers (particularly IL-6 and sICAM-1) and homocysteine:
A comparison of Model 5 with Model 2 reveals that the addition of
only four variables (WBC count, IL-6, sICAM-1, and homocysteine)
yields the same HR for LTL as in Model 4, which includes all the
covariates. Furthermore, by comparing Model 4 with Model 5, we can
deduce that adding the remaining variables has no effect on the HR
for LTL, even though some of those covariates (eg, body mass index,
glycosylated hemoglobin) significantly predict mortality.
We find no evidence that the results are sensitive to the exclu-
sion of outliers on the biomarker measures or to the specification for
WBC distribution (see Supplementary Material). Furthermore, the
association between LTL and mortality does not vary significantly
by sex, age, or duration of study.
Discussion
Our goal was to evaluate the strength of association between tel-
omere length and mortality in a large cohort with long follow-up
after controlling for potential confounders including WBC distribu-
tion and inflammatory markers. We found that shorter telomeres
were associated with mortality independent of age, sex, education,
and smoking history, although the magnitude of the effect was
small (ie, 12% reduction in the mortality hazard per SD of LTL).
The fact that we are able to detect such a small effect demonstrates
that the study has sufficient statistical power. While WBC distribu-
tion, especially the proportion of neutrophils, was associated with
LTL, the association between LTL and mortality changed little with
adjustment for WBC distribution. Similarly, the relationship between
shorter telomeres and mortality was independent of other factors
including exercise, alcohol consumption, body mass index, high-
density lipoprotein, glycosylated hemoglobin, pulse pressure, and
IGF-1. However, the association weakened considerably (by 48%)
after controlling for inflammatory markers (particularly IL-6 and
sICAM-1) and homocysteine.
The potential of LTL as a biomarker of aging has been the focus
of heated debate (4,5). Discrepancies between studies are typically
attributed to differences in techniques for measuring telomere length
and lack of statistical power. Another fundamental reason for dis-
crepancy is the issue of confounding. LTL is the result of multiple
environmental and biological factors that affect the individual (23).
Two prominent biological factors that influence average LTL are the
distribution of WBC subsets and the levels of inflammatory mark-
ers. While the association of LTL with inflammatory markers has
been previously explored (39), the role of WBC distribution has been
ignored until recently (40).
The WBC distribution is a potential confounder of the asso-
ciations between LTL and aging outcomes because different WBC
types have different telomere lengths and their distribution varies
with age, disease, and other factors. Granulocytes, which comprise
mostly neutrophils, have longer telomeres than lymphocytes and a
slower rate of telomere shortening (28). Moreover, their percentage
increases with age, as observed here, most likely due to a decrease
of lymphopoiesis in the elderly (41). We find that higher % neutro-
phils--and to some extent lower % eosinophils--are associated with
longer telomeres and, in the presence of controls for these factors,
the association between age and LTL increases slightly. Nevertheless,
controlling for WBC distribution has little effect on the association
between LTL and mortality, indicating that the association of shorter
telomeres with mortality is independent of the aging-related changes
in WBC distribution. This result is consistent with a recent study of
telomere length in centenarians and their offspring (40).
In contrast, the relationship between LTL and mortality was
attenuated after adjustment for inflammatory markers (eg, IL-6
and slCAM-1) and homocysteine. Only 2 of the 16 population-
based studies that analyzed the association between LTL and

mortality included inflammatory markers as covariates; none
of them included homocysteine. Fitzpatrick and colleagues (9)
controlled for IL-6 and CRP; Weischer and colleagues (7) con-
trolled for CRP only. Both studies found a significant association
between LTL and mortality even after adjusting for inflamma-
tion. The study of LTL in centenarians and their offspring also
reported a relationship between LTL and survival after adjustment
for inflammatory and immune markers (IL-6, CRP, molar ratio of
IGF-1 to IGF-binding protein 3, and cytomegalovirus serostatus),
in addition to % lymphocytes (40). Attenuation of the association
of LTL with mortality in our study but not in others may stem
from our inclusion of several biomarkers (homocysteine, sICAM-
1, and WBC count) that were not included in previous research.
Our study highlights the importance of controlling for a compre-
hensive set of confounders, especially markers of inflammation,
and shows limited utility of LTL as a biomarker of aging, given
the small effect of shorter telomeres on mortality and its further
attenuation with inflammation.
There are two possible explanations for the role of inflamma-
tion and homocysteine in attenuating the relationship of LTL to
mortality. On one hand, inflammation and homocysteine may be
confounders that influence both LTL and mortality (ie, the apparent
effect of LTL on mortality may be partly spurious). On the other
hand, they may mediate the link between LTL and mortality. The
prevalent view in the literature supports the first scenario because
chronic inflammation, which is a well-known feature of aging and
a predictor of early mortality (42), causes telomere shortening via
an increase in leukocyte turnover and the production of oxida-
tive stress, which directly accelerates telomere attrition (23). The
alternative view, however, is also plausible because critically short
telomeres lead to replicative senescence, which induces chronic
inflammation through the senescence-associated secretory pheno-
type (43). In the context of the immune system, senescent T cells,
which accumulate in the elderly, have been well characterized. These
cells have short telomeres, produce proinflammatory cytokines, and
may contribute to many age-related pathologies (44).
This problem of bidirectionality has largely been ignored in the
literature. Cross-sectional studies, such as this one, cannot distin-
guish between the two potential effects. Thus, longitudinal studies
should be conducted to test whether inflammation predicts subse-
quent changes in LTL over time and whether LTL predicts subse-
quent changes in inflammation. However, if both prove true, then it
will be difficult to separate the two pathways.
The main strengths of this study are the large, nationally rep-
resentative sample with long follow-up; the comprehensive set of
covariates; the rigorous measurement of LTL by quantitative poly-
merase chain reaction using appropriate controls and periodical
reproducibility experiments; and the detailed statistical analysis,
which used a hazard model that treats age rather than duration
of study as the "clock," tested sensitivity to the exclusion of outli-
ers and to specification of neutrophils, and reflected an integrative
interpretation of the processes depicted in Figure 1. The main weak-
nesses include one-time biomarker measurements; limited number
of deaths for cause-specific analyses; and lack of telomere measure-
ments by WBC type.
In conclusion, we have demonstrated that shorter telomeres pre-
dict mortality independently of the distribution of WBC, but this
association is tied to inflammation. The complex pathways linking
short telomeres, senescence, and inflammation may underlie current
controversies regarding the role of LTL as a biomarker of aging. The
conceptual framework presented here could help to design and inter-
pret future studies that assess the role of LTL in aging and mortality.

This variable was standardized (M = 0, SD = 1) prior to fitting the model; so, the hazard ratio represents the relative hazard per SD.
One of the leukocyte categories must be omitted because they sum to 100%.
§Time was measured in terms of years after age 54. Thus, the main effect for education represents the relative hazard at age 54.
