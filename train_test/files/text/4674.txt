Abstract
This study uses kernel k-means cluster analysis to identify medical staffs with high burnout. The data collected in October to
November 2014 are from the emotional exhaustion dimension of the Chinese version of Safety Attitudes Questionnaire in
a regional teaching hospital in Taiwan. The number of effective questionnaires including the entire staffs such as physicians,
nurses, technicians, pharmacists, medical administrators, and respiratory therapists is 680. The results show that 8 clusters
are generated by kernel k-means method. Employees in clusters 1, 4, and 5 are relatively in good conditions, whereas
employees in clusters 2, 3, 6, 7, and 8 need to be closely monitored from time to time because they have relatively higher
degree of burnout. When employees with higher degree of burnout are identified, the hospital management can take actions
to improve the resilience, reduce the potential medical errors, and, eventually, enhance the patient safety. This study also
suggests that the hospital management needs to keep track of medical staffs' fatigue conditions and provide timely assistance
for burnout recovery through employee assistance programs, mindfulness-based stress reduction programs, positivity
currency buildup, and forming appreciative inquiry groups.

Introduction
Shanafelt1 stated that burnout, defined as losing enthusiasm
for work, treating people as if they were objects, and having
sense that the work is no longer meaningful, is a pervasive
problem for physicians. Physicians' overwork, stress, and
fatigue are contributing factors to medical errors. That is,
medical errors are highly related to physicians' degree of
burnout and mental quality of life.2 Cimiotti et al3 described
that nurse burnout is highly linked to job satisfaction and
patient safety. An increase in nurses' workload would result
in higher infections. Bria et al4 further concluded that burn-
out is a response to the prolonged exposure to occupational
stress that influences the individuals, organizations, and
health care service recipient negatively. Most importantly,
the patients might suffer serious medical errors from burnout
medical staffs.
Because medical staffs with burnout would result in poor
patient safety, it is essentially important for hospital manage-
ment to observe and understand the attitudes from medical
staffs toward burnout.5 Maslach Burnout Inventory­Human
Services Survey (MBI-HSS) with 3 dimensions along with
22 questions has been widely used in practice to assess the
degree of burnout for medical staffs.6 These 3 dimensions are
emotional exhaustion with 9 questions, depersonalization
with 8 questions, and low personal accomplishment with 5
questions.1,7

Lee et al7 used a Chinese version of MBI-HSS to assess
nurses' burnout in Taiwan. Loera et al6 uses MBI-HSS to
evaluate Italian nurses' burnout. Furthermore, Lee et al5
pointed out that the Chinese version of Safety Attitudes
Questionnaire (SAQ) originally developed by Sexton et al8
has incorporated 9 questions from the emotional exhaustion
dimension of MBI-HSS to form a new Chinese version of
SAQ since 2014.5,8 These 9 questions are provided in Table 1.
The purpose of this modified Chinese SAQ is to assess the
patient safety culture as well as the degree of burnout (emo-
tional exhaustion) from all of the staffs' perceptions for each
health care organization in Taiwan on a yearly basis.
Assessing the patient safety culture in a particular health
care organization is critically important. Through the Chinese
SAQ survey from staffs' perceptions, staffing deficits of the
patient safety culture can be identified such that the hospital
management can improve health care quality and patient
safety.9 Wagner et al10 also pointed out that health care orga-
nizations with a more positive culture and reflective attitude
toward errors and patient safety would result in reducing the
number of accidents and failures. That is, a positive patient
safety culture implies that the health care organization places
patient safety in one of the highest priorities.9
By considering the needs of health care organizations in
assessing the patient safety culture in Taiwan from medical
staffs' viewpoints, the Taiwan Joint Commission on Hospital
Accreditation adopted emotional exhaustion dimension from
MBI-HSS to evaluate the degree of burnout with 9 questions.5
That is, emotional exhaustion dimension might be the better
dimension to characterize and assess the degree of burnout for
medical staffs in health care organizations in Taiwan. When
medical staffs are in high degree of burnout from occupational
stress, the patients might suffer medical errors from burnout
medical staffs. Therefore, regularly assessing the patient safety
culture through the Chinese SAQ survey to evaluate employees'
degree of burnout is essentially important. Moreover, when
employees in health care organizations have higher degree of
burnout, the hospital management needs to take actions to keep
track of medical staffs' fatigue conditions and then provide
timely assistance for burnout recovery to enhance patient safety.
Lee et al5 used 9 questions of emotional exhaustion
dimension from the Chinese version of SAQ and found that
medical staffs with different demographic variables perceive
burnout differently by analysis of variance. On the contrary,
cluster analysis which is one of the data mining techniques
can be applied to divide the entire medical staffs into an
appropriate number of groups based on their similarities.11 In
marketing applications, the values of different customer
groups after cluster analysis can be calculated and evaluated
to provide the management useful decisional information for
resources allocation.11-15 The purpose of this study is to iden-
tify medical staffs with high burnout by cluster analysis such
that the hospital management can take actions to improve the
resilience, further reduce the potential medical errors, and,
eventually, enhance the patient safety.
Methods
The data collected in October to November 2014 are from
the emotional exhaustion dimension of the Chinese version
of SAQ survey results conducted by a regional teaching hos-
pital in central Taiwan. By removing incomplete question-
naires, the number of effective questionnaires including the
entire staffs such as physicians, nurses, technicians, pharma-
cists, medical administrators, and respiratory therapists is
680. The demographic variables included in the Chinese ver-
sion of SAQ survey are gender, age, supervisor/manager,
respondents reporting events in the past 12 months, job posi-
tion, job status, experience in organization, experience in
position, education, and direct patient contact.
Each question in emotional exhaustion dimension uses a
5-point Likert scale that ranges from strongly agree to
strongly disagree with the respective values of 5 to 1. In
addition, all questions in emotional exhaustion dimension
are reversed questions such that each respondent's answer is
adjusted. That is, a higher (lower) value for each question
represents a lower (higher) degree of fatigue or burnout. On
the contrary, each demographic variable uses a numerical
value from 2 to 7 to represent the selections of that particular
variable.

Kernel k-means method by R language with package
"Kernlab" along with the kernel function of the radial basis
(Gaussian kernel) is chosen to perform cluster analysis.
Kernel k-means method, which is a more generalized
k-means method for cluster analysis, is very suitable for both
linear and nonlinear separable inputs because the type of the
data is usually unknown.16,17 Similar to k-means method,
kernel k-means method cannot determine the number of
clusters itself. In this case study, we employ variance ratio
criterion introduced by Calinski and Harabasz to determine
the number of clusters.18,19 Table 2 summarizes the values of
variance ratio criterion, where a higher value indicates the
better cluster quality. In this study, the number of clusters is
set to 8 with the highest value based on variance ratio
criterion.
Results
Nine questions from emotional exhaustion dimension and 10
demographic variables are the input variables. In addition,
the number of the clusters by kernel k-means method is set to
8. Six hundred eighty employees are classified into 8 groups,
where Table 3 summarizes the average values of 9 questions
from emotional exhaustion dimension for each cluster and
the grand average values of 9 questions from the entire
employees. The notations denoted by Q1 to Q9 represent 9
questions of emotional exhaustion dimension, and an aster-
isk sign indicates that the average value of a particular ques-
tion from a cluster is greater than the grand average.
From the numerical values of 9 questions depicted in
Table 3, Q1, Q3, Q8, and Q9 are above the average value of
3 based on a 5-point Likert scale, showing that employees
feel less in emotional exhaustion. In contrast, Q2, Q4, Q5,
Q6, and Q7 are below the average value of 3, indicating that
employees are in relatively high emotional exhaustion.
Specifically, Q6 has the lowest value among 9 questions
showing that employees agree that they feel used up at the
end of the workday followed by Q4 which has the second
lowest value, stating that employees also agree that they are
working too hard on their jobs. On the contrary, Q9 has the
highest value among 9 questions. That is, employees agree
that working with people directly does not put too much
stress on themselves. In addition, Q8 has the second highest
score which shows that working with people all day is not
really a strain for employees.
In contrast to the numerical values of 9 questions from
emotional exhaustion, the performance for each cluster can
be assessed by these 9 questions in terms of asterisks.
Specifically, all of the average values in cluster 4 are greater
than the grand average values, indicating that employees in
this cluster are in low degree of fatigue or burnout. Employees
in cluster 1 are also in lower degree of fatigue or burnout
except for Q9 (Working with people directly puts too much
stress on me) that has a slightly lower average value than the
grand average value. Moreover, employees in cluster 5 are in
lower degree of fatigue or burnout except for Q3 (I feel frus-
trated by my job) and Q9 that both questions have slightly
lower average values than the grand average values.
Clusters 2, 3, 6, and 7 having all of the average values less
than the grand average values show that these employees are
in high degree of burnout or fatigue. In addition, cluster 8 has
8 out of 9 questions having the average values smaller than
the grand average values except for Q4 (I feel I'm working
too hard on my job) which has a larger average value than the
grand average value. From the viewpoints of the hospital
management, employees in clusters 1, 4, and 5 are relatively
in good conditions, whereas employees in clusters 2, 3, 6, 7,
and 8 need to be closely monitored from time to time because
they have relatively higher degree of fatigue or burnout.
In general, employees in 8 clusters can be further catego-
rized into 2 types of groups, that is, lower degree of fatigue
(clusters 1, 4, and 5) with the sample size of 396 and higher
degree of fatigue (clusters 2, 3, 6, 7, and 8) with the sample
size of 284. The hospital management needs to pay much
attention to those who are in higher degree of fatigue. The
frequencies of these 2 groups in demographic variables are
quite similar. Table 4 provides the more specific information
for each cluster in terms of demographic variables. The
majority of employees are characterized as follows: female,
21 to 50 years old, not in charge of supervisors/managers,
reporting less than 6 events in the past 12 months, nurses,
full-time, with the experience of 5 to 20 years in organization,
with the experience of 5 to 20 years in position, college/uni-
versity degree, and very often to direct patient contact. From
the cluster analysis results, the hospital management might
not be able to identify those employees who are in higher
degree of burnout. However, with the link of further demo-
graphic variables such as the department a particular employee
works along with the individual demographic variables,
employees who are in higher degree of burnout can be found.
This study suggests that the hospital management needs
to keep track of medical staffs' fatigue conditions and then
provide timely assistance. The recommendations are as fol-
lows. First, unit heads can use team resource management
(TRM) on a daily basis for improvement. The coverage of
TRM includes leadership, situation monitoring, mutual
support, and communication. That is, unit heads can group
all of the members before the work every day and then use
an I'M SAFE (Illness, Medication/Menstruation, Stress/
Sleep, Alcohol/Drugs, Fatigue, and Emotion/Eating and
Elimination) checklist to know whether each employee is
in a good condition physically or psychologically. If not,
adjust the employees' daily work to ensure members and
patient safety.

health management personnel, human resources manage-
ment personnel (including directors), medical and nursing
unit supervisors, and occupational medicine specialists. The
committee should establish fatigue management plan, inves-
tigate the staff's level of fatigue, and then provide preven-
tion and elimination programs for recovery. The specific
contents are depicted below. The labor safety and health
management or human resource management personnel can
set up a high secrecy instant notification system. The hospi-
tal can provide each staff a "self-fatigue prevention" booklet
issued by Institute of Labor, Occupational Safety and
Health, Ministry of Labor, Executive Yuan in Taiwan since
2007. If an employee is found to have the symptoms listed
in the booklet, the committee should provide timely inter-
vention for necessary assistance to avoid further fatigue
phenomenon. In addition, the committee should regularly
conduct hospital-wide fatigue surveys by using the fatigue
scales with both reliability and validity such as MBI-HSS or
Copenhagen Burnout Inventory. The committee can develop
and then implement fatigue prevention, recovery, and elimi-
nation for each medical staff based on survey results.
Moreover, the fatigue surveys and analyses should be con-
ducted annually such that the fatigue management plan and
the employee assistance programs (EAPs) can be performed
to relentlessly reduce the staffs' levels of fatigue.
Discussion
This study has 4 major recommendations for burnout recov-
ery. First, the hospital (human resource management depart-
ment) should establish EAPs to set up a long-term service
system plan to prevent and resolve the possible causes from
either the organization or individuals that might lead to the
decrease of employee productivity. In doing so, employees
can work in good conditions physically and psychologically
to reduce medical accidents that might strengthen the hospi-
tal competitiveness and establish a good relationship between
the hospital management and the staff. EAP covers 3 indi-
vidual levels, that is, job including the work adaptation,
adjustment of organizational change, work-life balance,
career (retirement) planning, and so forth; life including
legal advice (such as legal issues containing the public ser-
vice, car accidents, debt, inheritance, marriage, conflict, etc)
and financial advisory (such as tax treatment, debt manage-
ment, insurance planning, etc), and health including mental
health (such as stress adaptation, anger management, work-
place interpersonal communication, the major crisis response
and management during the various stages of the career, etc)
and health care (such as providing the health care measures
and health care resources information in civil societies).
Second, the hospital can provide mindfulness-based stress
reduction (MBSR) programs to its staff. MBSR, created by
Dr Jon Kabat-Zinn in 1979 at the University of Massachusetts
Medical School, combines western medicine/psychology
and traditional eastern meditation to assist participants in the
mindfulness view of dealing with stress, pain, and illness. In
the past 3 decades, MBSR has been proven to be an effective
group training courses.20-22
Third, cultivate and help employees to build up their "posi-
tivity currency." Resilience cannot be printed just the way coun-
ties print money. In contrast, when individuals focus on positive
attitudes toward interactions, life events, and memories and
express his or her gratitude, then the "positivity currency" can
be printed and stored as assets. In addition, maintaining a posi-
tive outlook and expressing gratitude regularly are the real val-
ues for employees to build resilience. Kopans23 pointed out that
creating "positivity currency" can decrease anxiety, reduce ill-
ness symptoms, improve the quality of sleep, and, ultimately,
lead to greater personal resilience. By being more positive our-
selves, we encourage others to do the same. This in turn creates
a positive feedback loop that our own resilience is increased and
strengthened by the actions of others.
Fourth, set up "appreciative inquiry" groups.Appreciative
inquiry is a model that can be used to cultivate employees in
self-determined changes. Cooperrider and Whitney24 stated
that appreciative inquiry is the coevolutionary search for the
best in people, their organizations, and the relevant world
around them. By attempting to praise the employees who
have been achieved over the past, the reasons behind the
results to the past successful experience can be found and be
the beginning to encourage medical staffs enthusiastically to
enhance resilience and positive psychology, which will
become the driving force for the organizational develop-
ment. That is, appreciative inquiry seeks to enlarge the traits
of the past behaviors to achieve the organizational progress
and enhance the cohesion of purpose. Therefore, this study
suggests that the hospital can form appreciative inquiry
groups to focus on those employees with high burnout to
improve their resilience.
