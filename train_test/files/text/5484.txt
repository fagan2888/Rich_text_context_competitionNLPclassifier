A man angered after a dispute with his wife confessed to tossing
his four young children off a bridge, authorities said Wednesday
as they searched the murky waters for the bodies. Lam Luong,
37, who is charged with four counts of capital murder, told
authorities Tuesday night that he drove to the Dauphin Island
Bridge and dropped the children from a span that reaches 80 feet
in places, said Detective Scott Rivera.

Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a significant social and
public health issue because of its pervasiveness (Tjaden &
Thoennes, 2000) and deleterious outcomes (Bargai, Ben-
Shakhar, & Shalev, 2007; Campbell, 2002; Carbone-Lopez,
Kruttschnitt, & Macmillan, 2006; Golding, 1999; Scott-
Tilley, Tilton, & Sandel, 2010). Intimate partner homicide
(IPH) is regarded as the most severe outcome of IPV (Garcia,
Soria, & Hurwitz, 2007); however, there is a paucity of
research exploring cases of IPH in which persons other than
the primary intimate partner, or focal victim, are killed.
For the purposes of this study, collateral intimate partner
homicide (CIPH) is defined as the killing of individuals
exogenous to an intimate dyad--including one's children,
parents, siblings, friends, or new intimate partner. Previous
research has indicated the risk of death for child witnesses of
IPV (Jaffe & Juodis, 2006), but CIPH is broader in nature.
Collateral victims may include individuals not biologically
related to the focal victim or perpetrator.
To better understand this phenomenon, we extracted a
subset of CIPH news reports from a larger database of IPHs
and conducted an analysis of characteristics associated with
the crime. The goals of this study are twofold: (a) to identify
common perpetrator and victim characteristics and (b) to
situate journalistic explanations for CIPH in extant violence
against women (VAW) theory, namely, feminist and family
violence theoretical frameworks. Next we review the litera-
ture on the utility of newspaper stories for social research,
explain the concept of news frames, and highlight deficien-
cies in news media coverage of IPV and IPH.
Literature Review:
News Media Framing
News frames provide a structure for crime reporting and
serve as a consistent social construction template for audi-
ences (Surette, 2010). Frames "organize the world for both
journalists who report it and, in some important degree, for
us who rely on their reports" (Gitlin, 1980, p. 7). Framing is
often described as the way in which media content is shaped
and contextualized according to some familiar point of refer-
ence or latent structure of meaning, which in turn simplifies
the world by organizing experiences according to categories
and labels (Surette, 2010). It is the typical manner in which
journalists shape news content, and subsequently, how the
audience adopts these frames and sees the world in a way
similar to journalists and their informants (McQuail, 2005;
Tuchman, 1978). According to Tuchman (1978), "the news
frame organizes everyday reality, and the news frame is a
parcel of everyday reality . . . [it] is an essential feature of
news" (p. 193). Media frames encompass the working rou-
tines of journalists, allowing them to quickly identify and

Collateral Intimate Partner Homicide
Emily M. Meyer1,2 and Lori Post1
Abstract
Collateral intimate partner homicide (CIPH) is an underinvestigated genre of intimate partner violence (IPV) where an
individual(s) connected to the IPV victim is murdered. We conducted a content analysis of a statewide database of CIPH
newspaper articles (1990-2007). Out of 111 collateral murder victims, there were 84 IPV female focal victims and 84 male
perpetrators. The most frequently reported CIPH decedent was the focal victim's new partner (30%); 45% of focal victims
were themselves killed. News reports framed CIPH as the unexpected result of interpersonal conflict, despite evidence of a
systematic pattern of coercion and violence that capitulated in murder.

classify information and package it "for efficient relay to
their audiences" (Gitlin, 1980, p. 7).
Entman (1993), a scholar widely believed to lay the
groundwork for most modern framing research (McQuail,
2005), has referred to it as a "fractured paradigm." He noted
that to frame is "to select some aspects of a perceived reality
and make them more salient in a communicating text, in such
a way to promote a particular problem definition, causal
interpretation, moral evaluation, and/or treatment recom-
mendation in the item described" (p. 52). Therefore, framing
consists of selection and salience in that frames "define prob-
lems," "diagnose causes," "make moral judgments," and
"suggest remedies." This particular conceptualization is
especially useful in assessing the reporting of crimes as it
overlaps with the phases involved in the criminal justice pro-
cess (i.e., arrest, judicial proceedings, and sentencing).
Frames can take on an episodic or a thematic format.
Episodic frames treat a story as a discrete event--a crime is
described and a case is followed. These frames typically
encourage the audience to place responsibility for a social
problem on individuals and ignore possible societal contribu-
tions. Thematic frames are less frequently used; however, they
illuminate trends, chronic problems, or other systemic consid-
erations of an entire criminal justice issue or specific crime
that is explored in detail (Surette, 2010). Specific factors that
influence journalistic framing include (a) social norms and
values, (b) organizational pressures and constraints, (c) influ-
ence of interest groups, (d) journalistic routines, and (e) ideo-
logical or political orientations of journalists (Shoemaker &
Reese, 1996; Tuchman, 1978). However, there may be addi-
tional factors, including ignorance, pressure from the editor, or
word space limitations (Shoemaker & Reese, 1996).
Literature Review: News Media Frames
of IPV
News media reports of homicide are produced daily in the
United States. While murder is not the most frequently occur-
ring violent crime, it receives the most regular news coverage
(Graber, 1980). Crime reporting relies heavily on official
sources (Ferrand-Bullock, 2008) and is a durable news com-
modity (e.g., Garofalo, 1981). As a result, newspaper articles
serve as an excellent data source for researchers interested in
investigating the trends and characteristics associated with
IPV and IPH (e.g., Ferrand-Bullock & Cubert, 2002; Taylor &
Sorenson, 2002). To date, police records, death certificates,
and surveys have been the primary sources used to capture
homicide data. But newspaper articles may be more useful in
providing additional information about the phenomenon, as
news coverage "provides a map of the world of criminal events
that differs in many ways from the one provided by official
crime statistics" (Sacco, 1995, p. 143), specifically the cul-
tural, social, geographical, and temporal contexts of the act.
Studies on the framing of IPV indicate that journalists
provide a distorted view of the crime (Berns, 1999; Consalvo,
1998; Meyers, 1994). Meyers (1994) found that news cover-
age of domestic violence is typically framed to support the
status quo--coverage blames the victim while relieving soci-
ety of any obligation to the incident. Similarly, Maxwell,
Huxford, Borum, and Hornik (2000) determined that articles
cover specific incidents only and tend to place blame or solu-
tions with individual victims and perpetrators. Berns (2004)
reported that newspaper stories primarily focus on victims,
either celebrating their courage for leaving a violent relation-
ship or blaming them for letting the abuse continue. Frames
frequently utilize accusations by holding the victim respon-
sible for instigating his or her own abuse, and then failing to
exit given the opportunity. Berns (2004) warned that as a
result of these episodic frames, IPV is not seen as a social
problem originating within a context of male violence; con-
sequently the violence perpetrated by abusers is lost.
Deficiencies have also been noted regarding news media
coverage of IPH. Ferrand-Bullock and Cubert (2002) analyzed
newspaper coverage of domestic violence fatalities in a
Washington state sample, focusing on the accuracy of victim
portrayals and attention to the broader social issue of IPV.
They determined that coverage was often inaccurate and sup-
ported common stereotypes/misconceptions of IPV. Likewise,
Taylor and Sorenson (2002) completed a content analysis of
homicides reported in the Los Angeles Times from 1990-1994.
Results suggested that coverage of homicide was episodic. By
investigating gender issues in the reporting patterns of IPH,
Wozniak (2007) supported Best's (1995) hypothesis that the
media attempt to sensationalize the news by highlighting the
worthiness (or lack thereof) of the victim. Wozniak found that
the broader issue of IPV was not mentioned in 99% of the
sampled articles, further confirming the episodic, noncontex-
tual reporting assumption found in other studies.
With little prior knowledge of news media framing of
CIPH, however, it leads to a rationale for doing the present
study. To situate victim and perpetrator characteristics as
well as types of media frames within established social sci-
ence theory, we turn to a long-standing debate as to whether
IPV is gender symmetric or asymmetric. Next we review two
competing points of view that informed our research, namely,
the family violence and feminist perspectives.
Theoretical Rationale
Family violence and feminist theories represent two mark-
edly different perspectives on the causes and consequences
of IPV. Of specific interest is the concept of gender symme-
try in IPV (e.g., Anderson, 1997, 2005; R. P. Dobash &
Dobash, 2004; Kimmel, 2002; Post, Mezey, Maxwell, &
Rhodes, 2011; Renzetti, 2006; Saunders, 2002; Schwartz,
1987). There is a well-established literature on this debate,
with feminist formulations indicating that it is disproportion-
ately a problem of men assaulting women (R. E. Dobash &
Dobash, 1979; R. P. Dobash & Dobash, 2004; Stark, 2007;
Stark & Flitcraft, 1991; Yllo, 1993), whereas family violence
Meyer and Post 3
theorists contend that men and women are equally likely to
perpetrate IPV. While each theory agrees that both sexes
have the potential to be violent (e.g., Johnson, 2006; Straus,
1999), the fundamental differences come down to the context
in which the violence occurs (Bouffard, Wright, Muftic, &
Bouffard, 2008; DeKeseredy & Dragiewicz, 2007; R. P.
Dobash & Dobash, 2004; Johnson, 1995, 2005, 2006); spe-
cifically, how IPV is defined (e.g., DeKeseredy, 2000) and
how the data are captured (e.g., DeKeseredy, 2000; Kimmel,
2002; Schwartz, 1987).
Family Violence Perspective
How the research community defines IPV plays an important
role in how data are captured and the resultant prevalence
and incidence rates. The use of broad versus narrow defini-
tions of IPV impacts the perceived causes and motivations
for this crime and frequently leads to conflicting reports of
perpetrator/victim sex ratios. For example, general crime
surveys that use narrow, legal definitions of physical and
sexual violence frequently find low incidence rates of IPV
(DeKeseredy, 2000; Kimmel, 2002). Studies such as the
National Family Violence Survey (NFVS) define violence as
the frequency with which cohabiting partners use various
conflict tactics during an argument. The Conflict Tactics
Scales (CTS) are often used by family violence theorists
(Straus, 1979) and routinely identify high rates of IPV, low
rates of injury, stable levels of severity, and gender symmetry
in perpetration (Kimmel, 2002; Schwartz, 1987).
Studies that identify gender symmetry in IPV frequently
conceptualize the phenomenon as "common couple violence"
or "situational couple violence," both of which occur when
partners use physical violence against each other within the
context of an argument (Bouffard et al., 2008; Johnson, 2006).
Other conceptualizations that lend support to sex-symmetric
IPV include "situational couple violence" and "mutual vio-
lent control." Situational couple violence occurs when violent
acts are perpetrated by either intimate partner but are not
rooted in the desire to control the other. Mutual violent con-
trol, however, occurs when both partners are violent and con-
trolling toward the other person (Johnson, 2006).
Feminist Perspective
Feminist researchers, however, use broader definitions of
IPV that include psychological, verbal, economic, and emo-
tional violence (DeKeseredy, 2000). The National Violence
Against Women Survey (NVAWS; Tjaden & Thoennes,
2000) utilized this broader definition and included measures
of physical violence, sexual assault, stalking, and emotion-
ally abusive and controlling behaviors. Not only was there a
larger proportion of female victims, but study results also
indicated that 81% of female victims were stalked by a for-
mer or current partner, and of those women, 31% were sexu-
ally assaulted as well (Tjaden & Thoennes, 2000). These are
much higher rates than those detected in family violence
surveys.
Feminist scholars contend that narrow definitions of IPV
ignore "the context, meanings, and motives of both men's
and women's violence" (DeKeseredy & Dragiewicz, 2007,
p. 875). Such scholars argue that lethal and nonlethal vio-
lence is overwhelmingly perpetrated by men against women
(R. P. Dobash & Dobash, 2004) and the abuse is situated
within an environment of coercion and control (Stark, 2007).
Johnson (2006) termed this type of violence "intimate terror-
ism," as it encompasses nonphysical forms of abuse that are
rooted in the desire to control another. Tactics associated
with intimate terrorism include threats, economic control,
the use of privilege and punishment, using children, isola-
tion, emotional abuse, and sexual control.
Extending the pioneering work of DeKeseredy and
MacLeod (1997), Stark's (2007) coercive control theory
builds upon the feminist perspective of IPV by more clearly
defining coercion in intimate relationships. Coercion is
defined as the use of force or threats to either compel or dispel
a certain response in another human being. This theory
implies the systematic subjugation and methodical action per-
petrated by an abuser, and is among the first to place the con-
cept at the forefront of theoretical development. Stark noted
that if men want to maintain their structural-hierarchical
superiority they "must do so directly and personally in each
relationship" (pp. 199-200). The killing of a current or former
intimate partner's children or other loved one, as is the case
with CIPH, is reflective of the most extreme form of coercive
control as in the aforementioned case study. A man was mad
at his wife, so he murdered their four children as a means to
punish and control his wife. Is it possible that taking the life
of a collateral individual is a more extreme form of coercion
than killing the victim herself?
Method
This study used newspapers to describe the occurrence of
CIPH in Michigan by demographic and other variables dur-
ing 1990-2007. Given the paucity of information included in
homicide archives maintained by law enforcement agencies,
surveillance that includes newspaper reports of murders has
proven to be an innovative and efficient way to monitor
statewide intimate partner-related homicides. This particular
data collection approach was also used by Michigan's health
department for IPH surveillance due to incomplete records
maintained by prosecutors, police, medical examiners, and
registrars (Biroscak, Smith, & Post, 2006).
We conducted a quantitative content analysis of articles
extracted from a larger database assembled by the Michigan
Reading Press Service (MRPS), a clipping service that
reviews all daily and weekly newspapers. Articles that cov-
ered IPH as well as CIPH were collected by MRPS and
archived at the Michigan Domestic Violence Prevention
Board. We reviewed all newspaper articles about violent
4 SAGE Open
deaths occurring within domestic relationships (murder or
homicide of men or women involved in an intimate relation-
ship). Articles were also reviewed if a death occurred during
a sexual assault by an intimate partner.
The full database contained approximately 1,200 stories.
This study included homicides that occurred within the context
of a current or former intimate partner relationship--that is,
there was a clearly identified intimate partner "focal victim"
identified by the journalist as having a past or present romantic
relationship with the homicide perpetrator. A collateral victim
was any individual outside that primary intimate relationship.
This study excluded stories where the homicide victim did not
have a familial, romantic, or social connection with either the
focal victim or perpetrator (e.g., strangers/bystanders).
Analysis of Key Story Characteristics
We had two units of analysis in this study: (a) the individual
CIPH incident and (b) individual news reports. Incidents
were identified according to perpetrator and/or focal victim
name, and news reports consisted of individual articles col-
lected by MRPS. In addition to recording characteristics of
CIPH perpetrators, focal victims, and CIPH victims, trained
coders documented the following: (a) the phases of crime
covered in each news report and (b) specific homicide char-
acteristics. Coders documented how frequently the homi-
cides were framed as accidental, the result of a mutual fight
between focal victim and perpetrator, or premeditated with
malice aforethought. Last, homicide portrayal (i.e., whether
it was shocking or expected) was captured.
In addition to documenting victim and perpetrator charac-
teristics of CIPH, a major goal of this study was to assess how
the media portray and explain the crime. For the purposes of
the present analysis, "homicide portrayal" is defined as the
journalistic framework for presenting the CIPH. This variable
assessed the frequency with which shock or expectation was
used to portray the killings. Shock occurred when the journal-
ist discussed the unexpected nature of the crime, while expec-
tation occurred when the journalist discussed how the crime
was a logical outcome of escalating violence or psychological
deficiencies. Explanation for the CIPH is defined as the pri-
mary reason for committing the killing(s). Homicide expla-
nations were categorized as incident-specific/episodic or
thematic. Incident-specific explanations focus on a single
triggering event; a thematic explanation focuses on back-
ground factors or contexts prior to the CIPH that may have
contributed to the killings.
Intercoder Reliability Analysis
A reliability analysis was conducted prior to study initiation.
Two independent coders were trained in data collection and
underwent three rounds of testing that included all potential
study variables on which they could disagree. Stories were
randomly selected from all available articles, as stratification
was not a viable option due to small number of cases. The
variables were tested using simple percentage of agreement
and Scott's pi () to correct for chance agreement. Scott's pi
is the standard measurement of interrater reliability for nom-
inal variables in the communication sciences (Schiff &
Reiter, 2004; Zwick, 1986).
All variables that obtained 100% agreement were excluded
from further reliability analysis. The remaining study vari-
ables were expected to obtain high levels of agreement, spe-
cifically 0.85 and above. If they failed to meet this threshold,
they were retested in subsequent analyses. The sample size
for Rounds 2 and 3 was n = 15, so there were instances in
which coders disagreed only once but failed to reach 0.85.
Instead of throwing the variables out, we met with coders to
review them and only moved forward when percentage of
agreement was deemed acceptable.
Results
Victim and Perpetrator Characteristics
During 1990-2007, a total of 202 CIPH news reports were
recorded in the MRPS database, representing 84 CIPH inci-
dents. Table 1 details all of the individual incidents, includ-
ing total number of focal victims, perpetrators, and collateral
victims.
All CIPH perpetrators were male in this study (Table 2).
More than half were between the ages of 18 and 34 years.
About 4 out of 10 perpetrators (44.1%) were either married
or dating the focal victim, while approximately the same per-
centage (45.2%) were separated, divorced, or estranged.
Firearms were the weapon of choice (68.7%). CIPH perpe-
trators killed 45.2% of the focal victims in addition to col-
lateral killings and CIPH perpetrators killed themselves in
28.6% of the cases.
Just as all CIPH perpetrators were male, all focal victims
were female (Table 2) even though this study did not exclude
male on male or female on female violence. A majority of
victims were between the ages of 18 and 34 years (59.7%).
As reported above, most victims were either current/ex-
wives or girlfriends of CIPH perpetrators.
The 84 CIPH incidents resulted in 110 homicide victims
(Table 3). Nearly 30% of CIPH victims were the new intimate
partners of the focal victim, encompassing current boyfriends
or husbands, perceived romantic interests, and those engaging
in a sexual relationship with the focal victim. Children of the
focal victim only (no biological ties to the perpetrator; 16.5%)
and those shared by the focal victim and perpetrator (biologi-
cal connection was established; 12.1%) were prevalent. The
focal victim's parent was killed in 18.7% of the cases.

framework (Table 4). Still, 31% portrayed the killings as
shocking whereas 9% portrayed the expected nature of the
crime. For instance, after Andrew Marcello Osura killed a
pregnant woman and her toddler in a "domestic disturbance"
and led authorities on a high-speed chase, the journalist
noted, "word of the slayings shocked the neighborhood,
though some said they had called police on previous occa-
sions to complain about loud arguments from the woman's
apartment" (Associated Press, 2004).
In an article about the shooting of a 9-day-old infant, the
journalist portrayed expectation by reporting evidence of pre-
vious violence and several warning signs leading up to the
homicide. Space was dedicated to local domestic violence
resources and explored risks associated with escalating vio-
lence. Thus, a pattern of abuse and coercion was established:
Dean had kicked her in the stomach and blackened her eye when
she was 7 ½ months pregnant, and that Omar Dean Jr. was born
with a broken collarbone . . . she [Morlethia Bellman, the focal
victim] described a series of other incidents, and said she made
several reports to police at the 9th (Gratiot) Precinct. (Wilson,
1992, pp. 3A, 11A)
Homicide Explanations. CIPH coverage in 83% of the articles
was incident-specific, covering only the present homicide(s),
while 17% mentioned past relationship problems or abuse
(i.e., thematic; Table 5). Two types of explanations were
present: (a) the homicide(s) was perpetrated with malice
aforethought and (b) the homicide(s) was the result of an
interpersonal conflict in which the focal victim played an
instigating role. More than half of the articles (52%) stated

that a recent familial/interpersonal conflict or fight within
the primary dyad triggered the CIPH. Only 5% said that the
CIPH was a willful act based on previous violence or abuse
in the focal dyad, and 43% offered no explanation.
To illustrate an example of focal victim and perpetrator
conflict as a contributing factor, infidelity was the reason
given for why Leo Carmona killed his girlfriend's 2-year-old
son, Jonathon Matson:
A man accused of throwing his girlfriend's 2-year old son to the
floor and killing him out of jealousy over her going out with
another man has been convicted of second-degree murder . . .
Carmona was home alone with Jonathon while Matson was out
with another man and got upset because the toddler was

Discussion
CIPH occurs when an individual exogenous to an intimate
dyad is killed because of his or her affiliation to a focal vic-
tim. In our study, all CIPH perpetrators were male, with
nearly half identified as ex-/estranged husbands or ex-boy-
friends of the focal victims. Perpetrators primarily targeted
focal victims'new intimate partners and their children. While
81% of CIPH cases reported one collateral victim, the maxi-
mum number killed in a single event was four. These data
paint an interesting picture of a male-dominated crime in
which collateral victims are limited to female partners'
friends or family members. The only cases in which the per-
petrator injured his children occurred when they were bio-
logically related to the female partner/ex-partner. Focal
victims, who were all female, were also injured in about a
quarter of reported cases and nearly half were killed.
Our content analysis revealed that CIPH is primarily
framed as incident-specific or episodic (83%), with no men-
tion of contextual issues beyond the immediate homicide
event. This finding is in line with previous IPH research. The
crime is overwhelmingly depicted as shocking and unex-
pected, with less than 10% of news reports making note of a
history of abuse or violence in the primary intimate dyad.
However, when journalistic explanations were offered, more
than half attributed the CIPH to an interpersonal conflict
between the focal victim and perpetrator. Based on the homi-
cide explanation definitions used in this study, when conflict
was used as a reason for CIPH, both the focal victim and
perpetrator were framed as contributing to the death(s). As a
result, it appears as though a social breakdown frame
dominates--that is, CIPH is the result of a family problem
(Surette, 2010).
However, when considering the theoretical implications
of the aforementioned findings, we must turn to the drastic
gender differences in perpetration and victimization. In no
prior study on IPV-related crimes has such a gendered pat-
tern emerged. Previous studies of IPH have reported both
male and female perpetrators/victims (Biroscak et al., 2006;
Biroscak & Smith, 2005; Craven, 1996; Garcia et al., 2007;
Rennison, 2003), albeit disproportionately leaning toward
male perpetrators and female victims. Still, this finding lends
support to the feminist perspective of IPV in that power and
control over the woman is a likely goal of the violence. Many
CIPH perpetrators were no longer in a relationship with the
focal victim, but their actions appear to be driven by a desire
to hurt their estranged/ex-partner. Taking away a child or a
new intimate partner in her life is a powerful control tactic
that lends credence to the coercive control perspective of
Stark (2007) and other feminist scholars. Despite this con-
trast in sex ratios and relationship status of the perpetrators/
victims, the news media framed the crime in an episodic
fashion, using a family violence perspective to describe the
crime. This framework has the potential to sway audiences to
believe that severe outcomes of IPV, including CIPH, are the
result of a triggering incident rooted in the intimate dyad.
Potential Limitations
A major limitation of this study is that collateral victims who
survived an altercation were not included because the inclusion
criterion was restricted to homicides. The exclusion of those
who were not killed allowed us to focus on CIPH specifically;
however, generalizations cannot be made about the nature and
characteristics of the crime in cases where collateral victims
survive an attack. It is possible that a different reporting pattern
could emerge in this particular context. Moreover, while we
took steps to ensure interrater reliability of collected data, we
did not assess measurement validity. However, given the
extreme nature of homicide events, it seems unlikely that many
false positives would occupy our database.
It is also important to note the challenges associated with
using the news to study crime. The news media are more
likely to report newsworthy crimes and provide filtered,
molded pieces of information to the public. News producers
largely determine a crime's newsworthiness by choosing
which stories to report out of all known events, leaving those
that are not bizarre, spectacular, or extreme on the desk
(Surette, 2010). In addition, journalists and other news media
personnel are under tremendous organizational constraints,
which may impede their ability to produce an objective
image of reality (Cohen & Young, 1981). Unfortunately, this
coupled with the economic landscape of traditional media
leads to decreased support for gathering additional informa-
tion. Journalists are likely processing news releases, official
records, or press conferences instead of conducting their own
investigations (Mason, 2007). This lack of investigation and
journalistic specialization has negative ramifications on the
reporting of complex situations such as CIPH.
Finally, although newspaper articles are a good data source
and we have an exhaustive collection of CIPH coverage, all

deaths may not be reported by each newspaper (Biroscak
et al., 2006). What is considered newsworthy in Detroit is
going to be different from rural newsrooms in northern
Michigan. Crimes are more likely to be deemed newsworthy
if they are unusual, different, out of the ordinary, or affect
individuals of higher social status or celebrity (Chermak,
1995; Meyers, 1997; Oliver & Meyer, 1999; Surette, 2010;
Tuchman, 1978). Although CIPH is a unique, relatively rare
crime, murders are perceived as less newsworthy by journal-
ists in urban areas and when murder victims are dispropor-
tionately African American (Lundman, 2003; Meyers, 1997).
As a result, not all homicides are going to make the news.
Notwithstanding limitations such as these, our findings are
novel and help further our understanding of IPV.
Conclusion
This study has several implications, the most immediate of
which are its contributions to the IPH literature. Through an
intensive content analysis of reported incidents of CIPH, we
now have a better understanding of the dynamics and nature
of CIPH. Our findings suggest that members of focal vic-
tims' social and familial networks are also at risk for injury
or death. As such, court systems, law enforcement officials,
and Child Protective Services (CPS) professionals should
broaden their definitions of IPV victims and IPH to include
persons outside of the immediate dyad.
The next step in this particular line of research is to con-
duct a qualitative analysis of CIPH news reports. This will
produce a more detailed understanding of the crime and sup-
plement the quantitative findings presented in this article. As
we have assessed newspaper articles in Michigan, we recom-
mend examining CIPH across the United States. We also
suggest primary data collection with members of the media
industry, including both journalists and editors. The more we
learn about this phenomenon, the better we can train journal-
ists to consider CIPH through a more critical lens and within
the broader context of IPV. In addition, this information sup-
port tailoring prevention and intervention efforts for indi-
viduals outside of, yet still connected to, the intimate dyad.
In conclusion, this is the first study to investigate media
reporting of CIPH. Our analysis of all reported cases suggests
that a feminist theoretical model of IPV better explains the
crime, despite a preponderance of family-conflict-oriented
news frames. While CIPH is frequently presented as the result
of interpersonal conflict, the striking gender asymmetry in
perpetration and victimization positions it as a gender-based
crime. This study pushes the literature one step closer to
understanding the complex relational issues involved in
CIPH.
