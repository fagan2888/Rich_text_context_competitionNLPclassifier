The effectiveness of different instrument approach
charts to deliver minimum visibility and altitude informa-
tion during airport equipment outages was investigated.
Eighteen pilots flew simulated instrument approaches in
three conditions: (a) normal operations using a standard
approach chart (standard-normal), (b) equipment outage
conditions using a standard approach chart (standard-
outage), and (c) equipment outage conditions using a
prototype decluttered approach chart (prototype-outage).
Errors and retrieval times in identifying minimum alti-
tudes and visibilities were measured.The standard-outage
condition produced significantly more errors and longer
retrieval times versus the standard-normal condition.The
prototype-outage condition had significantly fewer errors
and shorter retrieval times than did the standard-outage
condition.The prototype-outage condition produced sig-
nificantly fewer errors but similar retrieval times when
compared with the standard-normal condition. Thus,
changing the presentation of minima may reduce risk and
increase safety in instrument approaches, specifically with
airport equipment outages.

Instrument approach procedures (IAPs) are pre-
cise flight paths that guide aircraft to land. Visual
cues from the outside environment are normally
required only for landing and rollout. As the air-
craft progresses through the procedure, its bound-
aries narrow and funnel it to a position for the
pilot to acquire the airport environment visually.
Respecting the boundaries of the IAP are essential
for safety because they guarantee obstacle clear-
ance and navigational system performance.
In terms of error tolerance, the margins are
tightest at the end of the IAP. Here, the lowest
altitude is reached, and the pilot must either see
the runway or climb away. Pilots need two things
at this point: the correct altitude and enough vis-
ibility to land. These two values are called min-
ima and are depicted on charts. Altitude minima
are referred to either as a minimum descent alti-
tude (MDA) or a decision altitude (DA). Mini-
mum visibility is the lowest reported visibility
authorized to execute the approach. If respected,
it gives the pilot a good chance of seeing ground
cues to land. Pilots must compare current visi-
bility reported with the charted minimum value
to determine the acceptability of the IAP. Visi-
bility and altitude minima vary depending on
many factors, including lighting systems, ter-
rain, and navigation precision (Federal Aviation
Administration [FAA], 1976).
Previous Research
Due to the criticality of the information, charts
must convey these minima effectively and effi-
ciently. Charting has evolved over time mostly
as a result of accident investigation reports from
the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB)
and surveys of pilots (Hansman & Mykityshyn,
1990). The majority of changes have involved
required content. That is, charting evolution has
been in terms of the presence or absence of
information, rather than how the information is
delivered from a human performance standpoint
(Hansman & Mykityshyn, 1990).
The two main producers of charts are the
FAA's Aeronautical Navigation Products (Aero-
Nav) and Jeppesen Sanderson (Mykityshyn,

1991). IAPs are depicted on approach "plates"
(charts), which are typically 5 3/8 by 8 1/2
inches, usually printed on paper or presented
with an electronic interface (see Figure 1).
The combination of small physical size and
high information content was identified as oper-
ationally problematic in earlier research (Hans-
man & Mykityshyn, 1990). Legibility of small
text and symbols, as well as information density,
creates an unreadable interface in low light and
turbulent conditions (Mykityshyn, 1991). These
general design deficiencies are thought to be the
result of litigation and the necessity for charts to
limit cockpit instrument occlusion when
mounted on a control yoke (Hansman & Myki-
tyshyn, 1990).
Apart from legibility limitations, other defi-
ciencies have been identified: Pilot surveys, acci-
dent reports, and empirical research have
revealed that identification of altitudes, naviga-
tional frequencies, approach minima, notes,
missed approach instructions, and information

density are also areas of possible error in infor-
mation retrieval (Butchibabu & Hansman, 2012;
Hansman & Mykityshyn, 1990; NTSB, 1975;
Osborne, Huntley, Turner, & Donovan, 1995).
With respect to navigational frequencies, the use
of Morse code identifiers and the symbolic depic-
tion of a given frequency can be very similar to
the identifier and symbol of another frequency
(Hansman & Mykityshyn, 1990). IAPs often use
one frequency for primary navigation and another
for identifying waypoints, missed approach
courses, and/or distance-measuring equipment.
Some identifiers may be identical except for a
preceding "I" that denotes a frequency's status as
a localizer. This similarity has led pilots to mis-
takenly choose one frequency in place of the
other, effectively compromising the navigational
capability of the aircraft, which has caused acci-
dents (Hansman & Mykityshyn, 1990).
As an example of the problems that approach
charts may cause in flight, consider the crash of
TWA514 in 1974.Altitude depiction was consid-
ered one of three contributing factors in the acci-
dent (NTSB, 1975). Specifically, the aircraft
descended to an incorrect altitude for the portion
of the approach being flown. This resulted in a
collision with Mount Weather, Virginia.Although
the pilots retrieved the correct type of information
from the chart, that information was incorrect for
their current location. In fact, the pilots had a dis-
cussion regarding the altitude to fly during the
descent (NTSB, 1975). Although incorrect train-
ing and air traffic control procedures were also
involved in this accident, the chart's method of
information delivery was a contributing factor.
This type of error indicates a more complex prob-
lem than legibility. In survey research, 25% of
pilot respondents stated that they had confusion
with approach minima while using FAA charts
(Hansman & Mykityshyn, 1990). Information
density from including all user groups' informa-
tion on a single chart creates the possibility of
selecting incorrect values. In addition, notes that
give exceptions to theses minima are often missed
due to pilot perception of lesser importance
(Hansman & Mykityshyn, 1990).
Butchibabu and Hansman (2012) investi-
gated the effects of clutter, or information den-
sity, on pilot performance with respect to infor-
mation retrieval. Pilots were given a chart on a
computer and retrieved pieces of information
from it (e.g., altitudes, distances). They investi-
gated arrival, departure, and approach charts
with multiple transition paths depicted together.
In the decluttered condition, depictions of non-
applicable paths were removed. In the baseline
condition, charts were presented in their original
form. Because an aircraft can fly only one path,
these researchers examined the effects of depict-
ing one versus multiple paths on retrieval time
and errors. The decluttered format significantly
reduced information retrieval times. In some
cases, a nearly 50% reduction was observed.
Instrument approaches, over departures, yielded
the largest reduction in retrieval times. Specifi-
cally, distances between waypoints and altitudes
produced the largest time differences. This sup-
ports the idea that the depiction method of infor-
mation has a direct impact on the user. However,
there was no significant difference in errors
between the two depictions due to a ceiling
effect. One possible explanation of the lack of
error could be the context of the experiment
because it was performed without concurrent
tasks. As one pilot noted in a study by Myki-
tyshyn (1991), "there is an unquestionable dif-
ference between reading a chart at a well-lit desk
versus using one in flight during bad weather at
night." Simply put, the context of use makes a
difference.
To address context and ecological validity,
Osborne et al. (1995) investigated pictorial missed
approach (rejected landing) icons and a briefing
strip of pertinent approach information against
textual descriptions of the procedure. Missed
approach instructions require fast identification of
information because of the proximity to terrain
and immediate required climbs and turns. Also,
accurate and timely retrieval of frequencies,
courses, airport elevations, and so on were the
motivation for the organized briefing strip
(Osborne et al., 1995). The study required pilots to
fly a real aircraft and perform several instrument
approaches ending with missed approaches. Pilots
answered information retrieval questions while
flying; their accuracy and retrieval times were
measured. Retrieval times were significantly
reduced for both conditions when using the iconic
missed approach depiction and the briefing strip.
However, no differences were found in accuracy
Simplified Approach Charts 169
between the conditions. This may have been due
to the training that the participants received before
data collection and possibly the simplistic nature
of the information. The briefing strip and the
iconic missed approach depiction are both found
in today's approach charts.
Complexity of Approach Minima
Approach procedures must accommodate all
possible users, so they are one-size-fits-all prod-
ucts. User-specific minima are embedded in
the chart with other users' minima. As a result,
approach charts contain information not pertain-
ing to the specific operational situation. Current
methods for deriving approach minima are
dependent on airport equipment status, aircraft
navigational capability, aircraft speed, weather,
and, occasionally, pilot training (FAA, 2007a,
2013a, 2013b). Deriving minima includes not
only sifting through unnecessary information
but also referencing notes within the chart itself
or noncollocated notices to airman (NOTAMs).
Theses noncollocated notes are sometimes a
factor in determining the value of a minimum
altitude and/or visibility. For the purposes of
this discussion, conditions of inoperative air-
port equipment are referred to as outages. For
example, if the local altimeter setting was not
available, there may be a note that states a value
to add to the minima to compensate for the
likely increase in altimeter error.
To illustrate this point, we use a fictitious
example including weather, aircraft type, capabil-
ity, and approach speed (see Figures 2­4). First,
we determine the category of aircraft, which is
decided by aircraft speed. For this example, we are
dealing with a Category C aircraft (121­140 kts).
Next, we narrow the field by ruling out approach
minima for which our aircraft is not equipped.
This sample aircraft has only lateral navigation,
which rules out any minima including a DA, as
this is a nonprecision capability. At this point, the
first two rows and theA, B, and D columns are not
applicable. Next, we determine if the wind at the
airport allows a straight-in landing (i.e., without
circling). In this example, the wind permits a
straight-in landing. What these three steps have
given us is the triangulated number on the bottom
of the approach plate in Figure 3. Even though a
number is located, it is not complete. Because the
local altimeter setting is not available, the notes at
the top of the page dictate the additional amount to
add to our minimum to make it correct and legal
(see Figure 4). In this case, that amount is 100 ft
and 1/4 mi of visibility. Finally, the minimum alti-
tude and visibility for our example are 1100 ft and
1 1/4 mi, respectively. Although this example is
not routine, it demonstrates where steps become
more complex requiring arithmetic and careful
reading of text.
Relevance of Visibility
Requirements to Pilots
There are two main types of visibility
reported to pilots: runway visual range (RVR)
and statute miles (SM). RVR is the most accu-
rate measurement and is reported in hundreds
of feet (e.g., 1200 RVR). Statute miles and frac-
tions thereof are reported by automated sensors
or trained observers (FAA, 2007a). What this
means to pilots is the amount of expected visual
range they will experience when near the lowest
altitude in the IAP. If the visibility is low and
the minimum altitude is high, it can lead to a
Figure 2. Sample scenario for determining minima.
170 June 2017 - Journal of Cognitive Engineering and Decision Making
situation where the airplane is too high to safely
land if visual cues are received late. Visibility
requirements are established according to sev-
eral variables, such as airport lighting systems,
height of minimum altitudes, and runway align-
ment angles (FAA, 1976). For commercial oper-
ators (FAR Parts 121 and 135), these minimum
visibilities are legally controlling. Operators are
not permitted to initiate an IAP without at least
the minimum visibility for the procedure being
flown (FAA, 2007a).
Approach lighting systems have been devel-
oped to aid pilots in the visual acquisition of the
runway and its relative alignment angle from the
instrument portion of the flight (not requiring
any outside reference; FAA, 2013a). This means
that the visibility requirement for a specific
approach utilizing an approach lighting system
is contingent on that system's operation. If it is
inoperative, the visibility requirement must be
increased to compensate for the loss of guidance
(FAA, 1976). For the purpose of this study,
approach lighting system malfunctions were pri-
marily used to test visibility adjustments.
Trends in Charting
Recently, charting has been migrating to elec-
tronic interfaces, which are free of printing costs.
The popularity of this format has been made
apparent by the FAA's creation of formal guid-
ance to handle the use of electronic charting inter-
faces by pilots (FAA, 2007b). Popularity of the

Simplified Approach Charts 171
electronic format is also noted by its application
in the air carrier world. Many U.S. carriers are in
the process of transitioning to all electronic charts
and manuals (Alaska Air Group, 2014; American
Airlines, 2013; Delta Airlines, 2013). In addition,
electronic charts have migrated into the consumer
world as mobile applications that are download-
able to a tablet. ForeFlight is an example of an
electronic charting application, and it accounts for
25% of general aviation chart use (Silva, Jensen,
Emig, & Hansman, 2014).Adriving factor for the
present study was the idea that changes in avia-
tion charting are necessary and currently possible
with electronic interfaces. Future electronic charts
should be free of unnecessary problems because
the system affords plasticity. Rather than merely
evolving the current medium of charting, there
is a need to provide new content and structure to
enhance safety and usability.
Time and Attention
Constraints in Approach
Preparation
Ideally, IAPs are reviewed prior to the descent
phase of flight for effective retrieval of the infor-
mation necessary to perform the approach (Ricks,
Jonsson, & Barry, 1996). However, there are
situations that require preparation to occur after
that ideal portion of the flight has passed. This
happens when the planned approach changes,
for many reasons: wind shift, equipment outage,
aircraft performance, traffic flow rates, and so on
(Lohr, 2011). Timing of the reassignment may
play a large factor in how detrimental the effect
is. In addition, time-constrained approaches can
result from diverting from an intended airport of
landing to a secondary choice for unforeseen cir-
cumstances (e.g., weather or airport closure). This
can result in a pilot having less time and more
concurrent tasks while preparing for the approach.
Flying often requires a pilot to attend to mul-
tiple pieces of information and perform several
tasks in close temporal proximity (e.g., monitor-
ing the aircraft and reading a checklist). Concur-
rent task management has been explored in the
context of aviation and many other domains. If
concurrent tasks are not expected and interfere
with the primary task, they become a distraction.
Severity of the distraction involves its modality
(e.g., visual or auditory), complexity, and dura-
tion, as well as the complexity of the previous
task (Gillie & Broadbent, 1989). Complicated
primary tasks are affected more by distractions
than are simple tasks.Also, distractions based on
the same modality as the primary task are more
detrimental than distractions through another
modality. Chart reading is a complex visual task,
and complicated visual distractions are detri-
mental to many aspects of flying. Pilots are not
trained on how to manage distractions: When

172 June 2017 - Journal of Cognitive Engineering and Decision Making
faced with competing tasks, they often neglect
one in favor of the other, and the hierarchy of
tasks is not always consistent (Dismukes, 2006;
Loukopoulos, Dismukes, & Barshi, 2003). We
exploited these issues to show the limitations of
current charting.
Error Categories in
Retrieving Minima
After analyzing the context of use and design
structure, we identified four broad categories
and named them as possible causes for using
incorrect minima: arithmetic error, omitted pro-
cedure error, incorrect procedure error, and
selection error. Each error category has many
possible examples within its scope. Addition-
ally, the categories are not mutually exclusive,
and descriptions of each are given.
Arithmetic Error
Adjustments to minima typically require
adding a penalty. This presents the possibil-
ity for error due to incorrect calculation of the
arithmetic problem. In our previous example
(see Figure 4), we needed to add 100 ft to the
MDA. This illustrates the potential to arrive at
the incorrect minimum altitude. However, the
magnitude and directionality of the possible
error are difficult to determine.
Omitted Procedure Error
Adjusting minima is a procedure. Therefore,
pilots must be aware of the need to apply the
appropriate procedure if the situation requires
it. If a pilot is unaware or mistakenly omits the
procedure, the penalty will not be respected.
Incorrect Procedure Error
Minima adjustment procedures vary. If a
nonstandard penalty replaces the inoperative
components table but the pilot applies the
inoperative components table, which would be
standard, he or she would be performing an
incorrect procedure (see Figure 5).
Selection Error
Because the approach chart is a tool designed
for all user groups, its information content is
high, and its interface real estate is low. This
density creates a situation in which more than
one possibility is presented, thereby increasing
the possibility of making an incorrect selection.
Number, spacing, units, and typography may
all play a factor in the likelihood of a selection
error.
Prototype Approach
Plate Design
The primary goal of the prototype approach
plate used in this study was to design out as
much possibility for error as feasible and then
mitigate the remaining amount (see Figure 6).
Nonapplicable aircraft approach categories and
minima were eliminated. This lowered the pos-
sibility of choosing the incorrect minimum as
the result of a selection error. Next, because the
present chart design does not label any of the
numbers in the minima section, unit-type dif-
ferentiation and proper selection are the product
of declarative knowledge. Therefore, we added
labels to denote units for minima (e.g., RVR,
SM, and AGL), to reduce the memorization
requirements, and to increase selection accuracy
of visibility values and minimum altitudes.
Minimum altitudes and visibilities were set in
bold, underlined font to increase salience and
perceived importance. This was motivated by
research investigating methods of directing
attention to specific information in maps (Wick-
ens,Ambinder, &Alexander, 2004). To differen-
tiate height-above-ground-level from altitude,
we added parentheses and in regular nonbold
font a unit labeled "AGL" next to it. A dark
magenta label was added to the top of the min-
ima box to denote the category and type of
approach in use (e.g., Category A ILS). Color
was used to be unique and associated with a spe-
cific piece of information. In addition, color was
used to connect associated information. For
example, NOTAMs that affected the minimum
altitude were boxed in red dashes, as was the
modified minimum altitude. This was a way to
show that the two were connected and the reason
for the amended minimum. Blue solid boxes
were used for visibility. The use of color to guide
the user was indirectly motivated by the salience
methods of Wickens et al. (2004). Because the
procedure designer preconceives visibility and
altitude penalties, all arithmetic was automatically
Simplified Approach Charts 173
applied when necessary. The purpose of this
was to eliminate the possibility of making arith-
metic errors and to delete the notes section of
the plate. Although the main purpose of this
study was not to reinvent the approach plate, it
was necessary to eliminate the issues thought to
be problematic with the current design for a rea-
sonable comparison. It is also well understood
that implementing a system for reliable dynamic
charts would require extensive research and
effort.
Purpose
The purpose of the present study was to
investigate whether approach plate minima pre-
sentation can be improved to reduce or remove
Figure 5. Inoperative components or visual aids table.
174 June 2017 - Journal of Cognitive Engineering and Decision Making
errors and decrease time when used during time-
compressed instrument approaches. Specifi-
cally, this study compared a prototype method
of prederived minima designed to relieve the
pilot of workload during any use case. Because
charting is migrating to an electronic format
(Alaska Air Group, 2014; Delta Airlines, 2013;
FAA, 2007b), the feasibility of creating a more
dynamic and tailored approach plate is high.
Approaches with outages added to the min-
ima pose a complex visual distraction. Charts
must be robust to all use cases and aid the pilot
as an effective work tool. Current approach plate
design may be problematic if used concurrently
with other tasks requiring attention. Late
approach preparation was explored to identify
how the chart works as a real-time tool with dis-
tractions. Furthermore, using a flight simulator,
we duplicated flight tasks associated with the
descent-and-approach phase of flight, making
the demands on the pilot as realistic as possible
without endangering people by testing in a real
Figure 6. Prototype approach plate design example.
Simplified Approach Charts 175
aircraft. The simulator requires many similar
visual scanning requirements as compared with
an airplane, increasing validity.
Hypotheses
The process of identifying approach minima
can range from retrieving one number from a
small group of numbers to a multistep process
involving other information sources and mental
calculation. We hypothesized that the number
of errors in identifying the correct visibility
and minimum altitude from the chart would
increase as NOTAM outages were added to the
charted minima (e.g., approach lights out of
service). When no noted outages were added
to the minima, we expected that the number of
errors would be very low. Error rates from the
prototype chart were expected to be comparable
to the standard chart without noted outages.
Retrieval times were expected to increase due
to the addition of procedural steps as outages
to the minima were applied. When no out-
ages were added to the minima, retrieval times
were expected to be the shortest due to the task
requiring the fewest steps. Outages from the
prototype chart were expected to yield similar
retrieval times as the standard chart without any
outages.
Method
Participants
We recruited 18 pilot participants: 2 women
and 16 men, aged 21 to 84 years (M = 38, Mdn =
29, SD = 19.01) from the NASAAmes Research
Center pilot participant pool. Recruitment con-
sisted of fliers and emails sent to potential
recruits. Participants were required to hold at
least a private pilot's certificate with instrument-
airplane rating. We did not control for age,
gender, education, or ethnicity. Participant flight
experience ranged from 198 hours to 10,000
hours (M = 1,292, Mdn = 775, SD = 2,223). The
sample included a diverse set of pilot qualifica-
tions, including seven private instrument pilots,
seven commercial pilots, one flight instruc-
tor, one instrument instructor, and two airline
transport pilots also certified as instrument
instructors. Compensation for participating was
US$20 per hour. Data from questionnaires were
kept secure by de-identifying the participant's
name and replacing it with a number. One par-
ticipant's data were excluded from analysis due
to a communication between the participant and
a previous participant, and that participant was
replaced.
Materials and Apparatus
All sessions took place in a simulator room.
The certified desktop simulator used was a per-
sonal computer­aided training device with radio
navigation and a color monitor. Precision Flight
Controls, Inc., of Rancho Cordova, California,
manufactured the Cirrus II model flight controls
and the Digital Avionics Standard radio stack.
Checklists were custom made for the simulation
and supported only the descent-and-approach
portion of flight.
Computerized surveys were used for both the
pre- and poststudy surveys. Excel spreadsheet
software was utilized for recording participant
retrievaltimesmeasuredbyastopwatch.Approach
plates were printed with a high-quality color
printer to remain faithful to the original design.
Prototype charts were AeroNav charts modified
with PowerPoint to create the revised depiction of
the notes and minima sections (see Figure 6). All
plates used were current and downloaded from the
FAA's terminal procedures publication service:
http://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/flight_info/aero
nav/digital_products/dtpp/.
Procedure
Participants read and signed the informed
consent form, then were given the prestudy
demographic questionnaire on a laptop com-
puter. Next, they received a verbal briefing of
the experiment (e.g., how many approaches
they would fly, what was expected). Participants
were instructed how to operate the simulator;
autopilot and flight director use was demon-
strated prior to the beginning of the practice
session. Participants were then given one prac-
tice approach and coached on operational issues
with the simulator. Autopilot or flight director
use was required during the final approach por-
tion of the flight. This was required so that all
pilots could utilize the "RVR 1800 authorized
with use of (autopilot; flight director; head-up
176 June 2017 - Journal of Cognitive Engineering and Decision Making
display; decision altitude) AP, FD or HUD to
DA" note for some approaches. Each partici-
pant flew 15 approaches under three conditions
(five approaches each). The standard-outage
condition involved five approaches using stan-
dard FAA charts with outages affecting the
charted minima (i.e., airport equipment out-
ages). The standard-normal condition required
five approaches using standard FAA charts
without outages. The prototype-outage condi-
tion involved five approaches using the pro-
totype charts with analogous outages to the
standard-outage condition. Each equipment out-
age condition was replicated between the stan-
dard plate and the prototype plate, but no spe-
cific approaches were repeated to avoid memo-
rizing the criteria. Charts were categorized into
three conditions: A = prototype-outage, B =
standard-outage, and C = standard-normal. The
order of conditions was counterbalanced so
that each chart condition could be tested first.
The condition sequence was ABC, CBA, BAC,
with participants randomly assigned to each
condition group. Participants started in the air
before the initial descent had begun and were
radar vectored to the approach by the researcher,
based on a predetermined route, with scripted
air traffic control instructions (see Figures 7 and
8). Participants were asked to write down the
visibility requirement, primary navigation aid
frequency, missed approach altitude, and the DA
or MDA as applicable. The responses written
down were compared with the correct answers
after data collection. Feedback was not given
to the participants on answer accuracy. Errors
were analyzed and placed into their appropriate
category or categories. Omitted procedure error
was identified when a participant would select
the appropriate minimum but not add a penalty.
Incorrect procedure error was identified when
a participant would add a penalty that was not
appropriate for the condition. Selection error
was identified when a participant chose a value
listed on the chart that was not appropriate for
the condition. The participant's notes revealed
arithmetic error when an addition error on the
scratch paper was obvious. When errors were
not identifiable, they were designated as other.
Design
This study was based on a repeated measures
experimental design that compared the three
Figure 7. Lateral flight path flown by participants with air traffic control communications, speeds, and context
notes.
Simplified Approach Charts 177
conditions (standard-outage, standard-normal,
and prototype-outage). Dependent variables were
consistent among all conditions: correct or incor-
rect minimum altitude and minimum visibility
identification (i.e., errors) and retrieval times
for identifying minima. Mean error rates and
retrieval times were analyzed through a repeated
measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) to deter-
mine if differences existed among conditions.
Mauchly's test of sphericity was performed to
test the assumption of uniform levels of variance.
A Huynh-Feldt correction was applied when this
assumption was violated. Degrees of freedom
were rounded down to the nearest whole number
and reported in the event that a Huynh-Feldt cor-
rection was applied. Post hoc pairwise compari-
sons were made with the Fisher-Hayter test for
repeated measures data (Huitema, 2011). For pair-
wise comparisons, effect size was measured with
Cohen's d. Pearson correlation coefficients were
calculated to identify correlations between the
number of errors and numerical participant demo-
graphic data. Due to outliers in age (84 years)
and flight time (10,000 hours), correlational tests
were performed with and without the outliers to
gauge their influence. Participants were randomly
assigned to three groups, which dictated the order
of approaches they received. This measured if the
preceding chart type led the participant into a dif-
ferent level of performance. A one-way ANOVA
was performed to test for differences among the
counterbalanced groups' error rates and retrieval
times. All tests were performed at a .05 level of
significance.
Results
Effects of Counterbalancing
Order on Errors and Retrieval Times
To assess the effect of chart presentation
order on errors, a one-way ANOVA was per-
formed. This compared each of the three chart
orders (ABC, BAC, CBA) against the errors
in each chart type: A, B, and C. There was no
significant difference in mean errors across
presentation order. Because retrieval time was
also a dependent variable and therefore sub-
jected to the same counterbalancing system, a
second one-way ANOVA was performed. This
assessed the counterbalancing system's effect
on retrieval times. No significant mean differ-
ences were found to exist across presentation
order. Because no effects of the counterbal-
ancing order were found, all of the data were
grouped for subsequent analyses.

greater due to outages affecting the minima, as
well as relatively low when used during normal

notes.

operations, were both confirmed. When outages
were added to the standard chart's minima, mean
errors were 7.28 (SD = 2.14). When the standard
chart was used in normal conditions, mean
errors were 1.39 (SD = 2.09). Furthermore, the
hypothesis that an alternative prototype depic-
tion of the minima would reduce errors when
outages were added was also confirmed. Mean
errors were 0.28 (SD = 0.57; see Figure 9).
These mean differences were statistically signif-
icant, F(2, 34) = 116.23, p < .001. Three Fisher-
Hayter tests were performed to test all pairwise
comparisons. All three tests revealed significant
mean differences. The standard chart with out-
ages produced significantly more errors than did
the prototype chart, qF-H(34) = 20.06, p < .001,
d = 4.73. Surprising, the prototype chart with
outages had a significantly lower mean number
of errors than did the standard chart used during
normal conditions, qF-H(34) = 3.19, p = .031,
d = 0.75. Finally, the standard chart during normal
conditions produced significantly fewer mean
errors than did the standard with outages, qF-
H(34) = 5.89, p < .001, d = 3.98.
Because participants made such a large num-
ber of errors when outages were added to the
standard charts, Pearson correlations were per-
formed between error rates and participant
demographic data in an attempt to explain some
of this effect. Total flight time, flight time in the
last 3 months, number of instrument approaches
in an airplane in the last 3 months, number of
instrument approaches in a simulator in the last
3 months, and age were compared with error
rates (see Table 1). The only significant correla-
tion with errors was with the number of instru-
ment approaches flown in an airplane in the last
three months, r(16) = ­.576, p = .012, two-
tailed, r2 = .332. Interestingly, instrument
approaches in a simulator revealed nonsignifi-
cant results with another very low r value. Tests
performed without the two outliers revealed
similar results.
Errors were identified and categorized by
type, then graphed to illustrate their respective
proportion of the total errors (see Figure 10).
Omitted procedure error and selection error
were the two most common and constituted 44%
and 34% of the total errors, respectively. Unex-
plainable errors that did not have an identifiable
cause accounted for 6% of the total errors.
Retrieval Times
The hypotheses that outages affecting the min-
ima would increase retrieval times and that the
prototype would reduce retrieval times given the
same conditions were confirmed. Mean retrieval
times (in seconds) increased when outages
were added to the standard chart (M = 57.19,
SD = 27.82) versus the standard chart in normal
operations (M = 34.90, SD = 12.30). In addition,
the prototype chart with outages yielded shorter
Figure 9. Mean error rates for each chart condition.
Simplified Approach Charts 179
mean retrieval times than the standard chart with
outages (M = 42.04, SD = 12.00; see Figure 11).
These mean differences (based on Huynh-Feldt
correction) were significantly different, F(1, 18)
= 11.75, p = .002. Three Fisher-Hayter tests
were performed to test all pairwise comparisons.
Results comparing the standard chart with out-
ages against the standard chart during normal
operations were significant, qF-H(2, 34) = 5.00,
p = .002, d = 1.18. Results comparing the pro-
totype chart with outages against the standard
chart with outages were also significant, qF-H(2,
34) = 3.39, p = .028, d = 0.80. Retrieval time
differences between the prototype with outages
and the standard chart during normal operations
were similar and nonsignificant. Three Pearson
correlations were also performed to determine if
there was a relationship between number of errors
in each condition and length of time to retrieve
the answers. None of the results were significant.
Visual analyses of the scatterplots revealed no
noticeable relationships. With the prototype chart
and the standard chart during normal operations,
there were simply too few data points to see any
systematic relationship. Pearson r values were as
follows: r(16) = ­.043, p = .865, two-tailed, and
r(16) = .185, p = .463, two-tailed, respectively.
The standard chart with outages had many data
points but was completely unsystematic, r(16) =
­.103, p = .684, two-tailed.
Subjective Survey Responses
Responses to the poststudy survey revealed
that 12 of 18 (66%) participants reported that a
part or parts of the standard approach plates are
confusing. Of those 12, 50% (n = 6) said that
the minima section was confusing; another 50%
(n = 6) said that the briefing and notes section
was confusing. Approximately 16% (n = 3) of
participants believed that there was information
on the charts that was unnecessary. Forty-four

percent (n = 8) believed there was information
missing from the chart that would have been
beneficial. In addition to simple yes/no ques-
tions, participants were asked to explain the
specific issues that they thought were confusing.
Several participant quotes explain the issues:
·
· "Minimums increase are specified separately for
ceiling and visibility, so you have to compute both
separately. A unified minimum would be clearer."
·
· "Text often very dense especially when explain-
ing many nonstandard variations (effects of inop
components or missing equipment)."
·
· "I don't like NOAA plates where you have to go
to a separate place (the INOP table) to figure out
alternate minimums when approach equipment is
INOP. I like Jeppesen plates where all the info is
on the plate you are using."
·
· "If I haven't flown for awhile I often forget what
is what in the minima area until I review it, and the
same goes for the profile and plan views as well.
There's a lot of information and often repeating
information in parenthesis does not always help to
simplify things."
·
· "The LDA approach minima were confusing as to
which minima I had to use."
Discussion
Expected and Unexpected
Performance
We investigated the effects of minima depic-
tion and airport equipment outages on errors
and retrieval times. Our goal was to identify
and assess different problems with charted
minima as they pertain to human performance
limitations. In addition, we analyzed a possible
mitigation strategy by comparing a prototype
approach chart to the current approach charts.
Lower error rates were observed with the pro-
totype chart versus the standard chart when
outages affected the minima. In fact, mean
errors were approximately 26 times less with the
prototype chart. Error rates were also approxi-
mately 5 times less with the standard chart
during normal operations as compared with the
standard chart with outages affecting the min-
ima. These results were generally in line with
our hypotheses. In contrast, the prototype chart
with outages yielded approximately 5 times
fewer errors than the standard chart in normal
operations. This finding was unexpected, as the
two chart types were hypothesized to be compa-
rable in all performance aspects.
The errors observed during normal opera-
tions with the standard chart may be attributed to
several factors, but one explanation could be the
inconsistent spacing of rows and columns
between different approach configurations. For
example, the ILS 01R in Washington Dulles and
the ILS Z 16R at Paine Field are north/south
runways, using more longitudinal space of the
chart and compression of other parts. In this
case, the result is an instrument landing system
(ILS) minima row that is half the height of the
others. Several participants chose second-row
minima when they should have selected from
Row 1. Numbers are also centered in the column
they occupy. If the minima are applicable to all
categories of aircraft (e.g., ABCD), the informa-
tion will not be aligned with the row below it
and will have a large blank area to the left, which
is generally where people start reading. Further-
more, the presence of noncivilian information,
distinguished by parentheses, caused errors for
participants using the standard chart in normal
conditions. Participants would choose the wrong
(military) number as their visibility minimum.
These issues might be the result of a learned
habit as they quickly retrieve information.
Jeppesen uses parentheses to depict height above
ground level, which is applicable to the civilian
user. If users are exposed to both government
and Jeppesen formats, there is a possibility of
negative transfer with respect to the meaning of
parentheses. This unexpected result may indi-
cate that the lack of unit labeling and selection
error possibilities are problematic.
Time Pressure
Every trial was intentionally time constrained
to simulate an approach change near the airport
and to add realism. This forced the participants
to use the chart as a real-time work tool, which
required its use to be mixed with primary flight
tasks, such as monitoring aircraft parameters,
navigating, and communicating with air traffic
control. When the chart was used simply as a data
extraction interface (i.e., search and identify),
flight interference was relatively low, as was chart
use interference. Pilots were able to make quick
Simplified Approach Charts 181
transitions between monitoring the aircraft and
extracting pieces of information from the chart.
In contrast, when the chart required multiple steps
(i.e., when outages were added), the primary task
of flying the airplane was sometimes neglected.
Speed, checklists, and navigation frequency iden-
tification were common tasks that were discarded
when the chart required abnormal amounts of
attention. One participant wrote in the poststudy
survey, "Most charts are simple, but some charts
have an impenetrable wall of text that can require
a great deal of decision making."
Conversely, there were times when the flying
tasks would take priority over the intricate steps of
the chart.This caused the chart to be revisited mul-
tiple times, eventually leading to some very com-
plicated retrieval errors. For example, one partici-
pant knew about a required procedure but was
simply unable to concentrate on it long enough to
arrive at the correct answer. This resulted in an
arithmetic error, a selection error, and an incorrect
procedure error in a single case. Throughout the
entire study, no participants asked for a delay to
prepare for the approach. At no time was it said
that delays were not allowed. This was a fascinat-
ing occurrence, as there were many approaches
that were not set up completely, yet the pilot
elected to continue. It is unclear if this phenome-
non was an artifact of flying in a simulator or if
pilots felt compelled to continue for some other
reason.
Errors and Retrieval Times
Our data showed no relationship between
correct answers and retrieval times for any of
the three chart types. This has different mean-
ing depending on which chart type is discussed.
Omitted procedure error, incorrect procedure
error, and arithmetic error differed in the amount
of time that it took to get to the wrong answer.
Incorrect procedure errors and arithmetic errors
exhibited longer retrieval times and incorrect
answers, whereas omitted procedure errors were
shorter. Therefore, the retrieval times could be fast
and inaccurate or slow and inaccurate. In addition,
omitted procedure errors as a result of not using
the inoperative components or visual aids table
were particularly interesting. Several participants
did not use the table even though it was attached
to a clipboard in front of then. In reality, it would
be more difficult to access and not co-located
with the charts in use. This may indicate that
pilots are not familiar with its purpose or usage.
Furthermore, if pilots do not use this table when
it is given to them, it is unlikely that they use it in
reality. Last, the prototype-outage chart's lack of
correlation with time and errors is not meaningful
due to the lack of data points.
Error rates were most likely high in the stan-
dard chart, with outages due to the complexity of
the procedural steps in combination with the
complexity of the task of flying. Additionally,
pilot knowledge and training of how to handle
these issues appeared to be highly variable, as
indicated by the observed differences in errors
and retrieval times. This combination was
enough to render the information presentation
ineffective in certain cases. Overall retrieval
times were in line with the hypothesis, as well as
similar to Butchibabu and Hansman's (2012)
decluttering results with information retrieval
from approach procedures. When unnecessary
information is removed, it reduces complexity
and allows for faster identification of important
information. Average retrieval times were
reduced by approximately 28% with the proto-
type chart as compared with the standard chart
with outages affecting the minima. Furthermore,
this increase in speed did not come at the cost of
increased error. During high-workload phases of
flight, reducing retrieval times is undoubtedly a
positive outcome. Limiting the duration of cock-
pit distractions allows for more resources to be
applied to understanding the current situation.
Implications
This study provided empirical support for
identifying the limitations of standard approach
minima depiction in delivering information to
pilots in time-compressed situations with equip-
ment outages. These findings in and of them-
selves should not be mistaken for an overall
evaluation of the standard approach plate but
rather a small subset of unusual use cases. Mostly,
these findings, along with others preceding them,
should be taken as a cue that aviation charting
could be improved. Prior limiting factors, such
as printing costs, color ink, and paper thickness,
are no longer issues. High-resolution screens
and automatic dependent surveillance­broadcast
182 June 2017 - Journal of Cognitive Engineering and Decision Making
connectivity could allow the user to update data
in real time and display them on an electronic
interface. Initial charting design for any procedure
should incorporate known human perceptual and
cognitive limitations, with special consideration
for the context of use, environmental as well as
situational.
Limitations
Generalizability of this study may be limited
to AeroNav charts because Jeppesen utilizes
an alternative method of depicting approach
minima. However, certain notes and NOTAM
changes would be similar in the Jeppesen for-
mat. Utilizing a simulator may have produced
different behavior than that seen in actual flight.
This study focused on realism but undoubtedly
fell short in several areas. Because this study
was performed as a single-pilot operation, there
may be differences in the way that two-crew
operators handle situations with instrument
approaches. It was beyond the scope of this
project to address these issues.
Future Research
This research required long data collection
sessions; therefore, it was limited in scope.
Many separate yet closely associated areas are
still in need of exploration. First, comparing
Jeppesen approach plates with the same proce-
dures and study design is a logical next step in
fully understanding performance limitations in
approach minima depiction. Second, exploring
two-crew operations would address areas that
this study could not. Effects of crew coordi-
nation, crosschecking, and briefing would be
further areas to examine. Third, NOTAM depic-
tion as it pertains to other aspects of charting
will need to be explored. Because NOTAMs
can affect other parts of the chart besides the
minima section, a comprehensive investigation
is required to gauge their impact on operational
safety. Finally, the impact of time pressure as an
independent variable during abnormal and nor-
mal operations would be useful in determining
exactly how detrimental it is to performance.
Conclusions
This study provides support for the pre-
vious studies on approach plate decluttering
and information depiction. In comparison with
Butchibabu and Hansman (2012) and Osborne
et al. (1995), we also noticed a significant
reduction in time spent extracting information
from approach charts. However, unlike previous
studies, we believe that flying tasks, abnormal
conditions, and time pressure created by our
simulated scenarios were able to exploit further
issues. In high-workload situations complicated
by airport equipment outages, we noticed a large
increase in errors identifying correct approach
minima. In addition, our prototype method
of depiction appeared to be very effective at
mitigating errors in all use cases and should be
explored further for possible use. By automating
many of the charting procedures and changing
the depiction of information, we believe that
aviation safety could be improved.
