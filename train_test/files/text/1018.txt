Public Support For Policies
That Would Help People With
Chronic Conditions
Americans overwhelmingly support policies related to chronic
care--until they are asked to pay for them.
by Mae Thamer, Wenke Hwang, and Gerard F. Anderson
ABSTRACT: According to a national public opinion survey, Americans strongly support gov-
ernment solutions to help people with chronic conditions and their caregivers. Such solu-
tions include a Medicare prescription drug benefit, a tax credit for caregivers, a tax break
for people who purchase private long-term care insurance, and public long-term care insur-
ance. A majority is willing to support several of these initiatives by paying higher taxes, but
our survey suggests that other initiatives may not have sufficient support to offset their in-
cremental costs. In addition, support for these proposals varies systematically by individual
characteristics, which suggests that there are different constituencies for each proposal.
Anumber of proposed health care reforms would have a major
impact on millions of Americans with chronic conditions and their care-
givers. In this paper we compare public support for four initiatives that
have received considerable policy attention in recent years: a Medicare prescrip-
tion drug benefit, creation of public long-term care insurance, a tax break for un-
paid caregivers, and a tax break for persons who purchase private long-term care
insurance.
To assess the level of support for each of these policies, we conducted a nation-
ally representative survey of Americans regarding their knowledge, attitudes, and
perceptions of chronic conditions. One survey component asked respondents
about their level of support for each policy and their willingness to pay higher
taxes to enact it. We then compared willingness to pay with cost estimates of en-
acting each initiative. The objectives of this paper are to (1) examine the overall level
of support for each policy; (2) compare the public's willingness to pay higher taxes
to enact each policy; and (3) compare the public's willingness to pay with the esti-
mated cost of each program. We also attempt to determine the sociodemographic

characteristics of persons who are more likely to support each policy.
n Survey methods. A telephone survey consisting of fifty-one questions, requir-
ing approximately fifteen minutes to answer, was administered to a national ran-
dom sample of 1,663 adults between March and November 2000.1 Results were
weighted according to age, sex, race, and level of education and income so that the
sample would be representative of the U.S. public. All reported survey results have a
sampling error of ±3 percent. Respondents were asked a series of questions in the
following three areas: (1) support for four specific policy initiatives; (2) willingness
to pay $250 for each supported initiative; and (3) willingness to pay $500 for each.2
n Demographic characteristics. The demographic characteristics of the survey
respondents are as follows: 53.3 percent were female; 43 percent were ages 18­44;
35.2 percent, ages 45­64; and 21.8 percent, age 65 or older; 78.6 percent were white;
62.8 percent had some college education; and 33.2 percent had annual incomes
above $50,000. One-third (33.6 percent) had a chronic condition themselves, 11.4
percent were caring for someone with a chronic condition, 14.1 percent both had a
chronic condition and were caregivers, and 40.9 percent neither had a chronic con-
dition nor were caregivers.
Current Legislative Status And Cost Estimates
n A new Medicare prescription drug benefit. Under current law, the Medicare
program does not cover prescription drugs provided outside of the hospital. To esti-
mate the costs of developing a Medicare prescription drug benefit, the Congressio-
nal Budget Office (CBO) assumed a base case for a benefit that would provide cover-
age for all outpatient drug costs of Medicare enrollees, whereby the federal
government would pay 50 percent of premiums, beneficiaries would pay 50 percent
coinsurance, and stop-loss protection would be provided after $4,000 in out-of-
pocket spending.3 This base case would cost the federal government an estimated
$31.6 billion in 2004. Using various options that change beneficiaries' cost sharing,
the stop-loss amount, the cap, and combinations of these, the CBO estimated a range
of $21.4 billion­$42.0 billion in annual costs to cover the costs of a Medicare drug
benefit.
n Government-funded long-term care insurance. Long-term care--which in-
cludes skilled nursing facility (SNF) and other facility-based care, home health care,
home and community-based waiver services, and personal care--is now financed
through a wide mix of public and private sources. Public financing, which funds 62
percent of all services, comes from Medicaid, Medicare, state programs, the Depart-
ment of Veterans Affairs (VA), and the Administration on Aging. Private financing
includes private insurance, philanthropy, and out-of-pocket payments. The CBO es-
timated that more than $120 billion was spent on long-term care for the elderly
alone in 1999.4 In our analysis we assume that all $120 billion would be paid by pub-
lic sources or an increment of $46 billion in public spending ($120 billion ´ 0.38).
n Tax break for unpaid caregivers. An initiative put forth by the Clinton ad-

ministration in 1998 would support families with long-term care needs through a
$1,000 tax credit.5 This initiative would compensate families for a wide range of for-
mal and informal care for people of all ages who have three or more limitations in ac-
tivities of daily living (ADLs) or a comparable cognitive impairment. This means-
tested tax credit was estimated to cost $5.5 billion over five years by President
Clinton's 1998 Long-Term Care Initiative.
n Tax break for purchasers of long-term care insurance. The Health Care In-
surance Act of 2001 (S.B. 24) seeks to provide a tax credit for qualified long-term
care premiums. Although there are no current estimates for the cost of a tax break
for persons who purchase long-term care insurance, given the approximately 6 per-
cent of the adult population who purchase such insurance (twelve million persons)
and assuming a tax credit of $1,000­$3,000, such an initiative would cost $12­$36
billion a year.6 This is without assuming any increase in the number of subscribers
because of the tax credit.
Support For Policy Initiatives And Willingness To Pay
According to our survey results, Americans overwhelmingly support policy ini-
tiatives that would help persons with chronic conditions (Exhibit 1). Between
one-half and three-quarters of survey respondents "strongly" supported each of
these four initiatives. These are the data that are usually reported in the media and
used to influence public policy. However, when issues of financing these initia-
tives are introduced, the results and relative rankings can change.
Willingness to pay has been widely used as a way to measure the demand for
benefits in health and health care.7 It has also been used in other public policy ar-
eas such as clean air and water, less congestion on roads, and other services for
which a private market does not exist.8
Once the possibility of higher taxes was introduced in our survey, the level of
support for all four options declined (Exhibit 2).9 Of respondents who had re-
ported strong support for a specific policy, 9­13 percent were unwilling to pay a
minimum of $250 in additional taxes for that policy. Still, a majority of respon-

dents were willing to pay an additional $250 in taxes for prescription drugs, gov-
ernment-funded long-term care insurance, and a caregivers' tax credit. On the
other hand, while half of respondents strongly supported a tax break for the pur-
chase of private long-term care insurance, only 37 percent were willing to pay an
additional $250 or more in taxes to finance this policy. None of the four proposals
obtained a majority of supporters if it involved an additional $500 in taxes.
Cost Versus Level Of Support
n Medicare drug benefit. Almost two-thirds of respondents were willing to
pay $250 or more to support a new Medicare prescription drug benefit, the equiva-
lent of $25 billion annually. According to the CBO, the estimated cost to taxpayers
of adding this benefit to Medicare, using different cost-sharing mechanisms, is in
the range of $21 billion to $42 billion annually.10
n Long-term care insurance. Almost 60 percent of respondents expressed the
willingness to pay $250 or more to support government-funded long-term care in-
surance. Given this level of support, approximately $25 billion could be available for
this benefit expansion. However, according to the CBO estimates, government costs
for providing long-term care insurance for the elderly alone in 1999 were more than
$120 billion. Because the public sector now supports 62 percent of the cost for the
elderly, the incremental cost of providing long-term care insurance for the elderly
would be at least $46 billion, and even greater if demand for long-term care services
increases. Given this estimate, the public does not appear to be willing to fully fund
the incremental cost of public long-term care insurance.
n Caregiver tax break. More than half of respondents said that they would be
willing to pay at least $250 to support a tax break for persons who provide unpaid
care to family members or friends. Assuming a tax base of 100 million U.S. taxpayers

each paying $250, $25 billion would be available to support such a tax break. The
proposal introduced in 1998 estimated spending $5.5 billion over five years for such
an initiative.11 The public, therefore, appears to be willing to pay a far greater amount
to support caregivers than what this initiative would cost.
n Tax break for long-term care insurance purchasers. Finally, only 37 percent
of respondents would be willing to pay $250 in additional taxes to support a tax
break for persons who purchase long-term care insurance. As stated before, this pro-
posal would cost an estimated $12 billion­$36 billion.12 Our survey suggests that
only a scant majority of Americans strongly support this option, before any higher
taxes to support this option are discussed. Once the possibility of higher taxes is in-
troduced, support erodes considerably.
Characteristics Of Supporters For Each Policy Initiative
To determine the characteristics of the U.S. population that support each spe-
cific health policy, we conducted logistic regressions for each policy using three
models. The three models differed in the dependent variable selected: Model 1 ex-
amined the likelihood of supporting versus not supporting each policy; Model 2
examined the likelihood of supporting each policy by indicating willingness to
pay a minimum of $250 versus not supporting each policy by paying extra taxes;
and Model 3 examined the likelihood of being willing to pay $500 to support each
policy versus not supporting that policy at all. Model 1 identifies general public
support, Model 2 identifies the public's willingness to pay, and Model 3 shows the
greatest support for the policy. In all three models the independent variables were
sex, age, race, educational status, and association with chronic conditions.13
n Strongest supporters. In general, women, blacks, and caregivers were the
strongest supporters of each of the four policies. Educational level did not appear to
be correlated with support of any policy. Age as a predictor depended on the specific
policy. Persons ages 45­64 were the strongest supporters of a tax break for purchas-
ers of private long-term care insurance and for caregivers.
n Least likely to support. Surprisingly, persons age sixty-five and older were
least likely to support government-funded long-term care insurance and a new
Medicare drug benefit. Although this result may appear to be counterintuitive, a
1998 survey reported the following similar findings: Only 58 percent of persons age
sixty-five and older favored a proposal to improve Medicare by covering prescrip-
tion drugs, compared with 71 percent of persons under age sixty-five; and only 64
percent of elderly respondents supported Medicare coverage of long-term nursing
home care, compared with 70 percent of persons under age sixty-five.14
n Possible explanations. There are several possible explanations for the

counterintuitive result found in both surveys. First, 73 percent of Medicare benefi-
ciaries already have prescription drug coverage.15 Second, according to the 1998 sur-
vey, the elderly were somewhat more likely than their younger counterparts were to
rate keeping taxes down as a "very important" issue (70 percent versus 66 percent)
and therefore may be less amenable to any changes in Medicare that might require
additional taxes. Third, the elderly were much more likely than their younger coun-
terparts were to report that Medicare is doing a "good job" in serving health care
consumers (74 percent versus 44 percent), and therefore the elderly may be less
likely to desire major changes in the program. Similarly, persons under age sixty-five
were more likely to report that Medicare's benefits are "less generous" than are those
of most private health insurance plans (35 percent versus 21 percent of elderly re-
spondents). Some or all of these factors could explain this unexpected finding.
Since the time of the survey (March­November 2000), the economy and the
government's budgetary situation have deteriorated, and the policy agenda has
been radically revised. Public support for specific alternatives may have shifted
during this period. We also recognize that public opinion is only one factor that
influences public policy. Finally, we note that public opinion can change rapidly,
as demonstrated by the Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act passage and its re-
peal only a year later.
Although numerous surveys have asked Americans about their sup-
port for a number of health-related policies, this is the first survey to focus
on the public's willingness to pay for specific proposals related to caring for
people with chronic conditions. There appears to be support for prescription drug
coverage at the level now being discussed in Congress, a willingness to fund tax
credits for persons who provide unpaid care at a higher level than the proposed
cost, and an unwillingness to pay for an expansion of government-funded or pri-
vate long-term care insurance at the proposed cost.

NOTES
1. The survey was conducted by Harris Interactive. Participating households were identified using
random-digit-dialing procedures for U.S. telephone numbers. Efforts were made to increase the response
rate and to encourage participation. Specially trained interviewers called back people who had initially re-
fused to participate and offered them a financial incentive ($15) for their participation. The adult with the
most recent birthday in the household was identified and asked to participate. Eligibility was limited to
English and Spanish speakers. A total of 2,970 persons were contacted, and 1,663 completed the survey.
The response rate of 56 percent was calculated as the percentage of eligible households for which an inter-
view was completed.
2. Each respondent was read the following: "I'm going to read you a list of proposed health reforms that
might be passed by Congress. For each, please indicate if you would strongly support it, somewhat sup-
port it, somewhat oppose it, or strongly oppose it." Only those respondents who reported strong support
for each initiative were further queried, "How willing are you to support [each specific initiative] if it
meant a $250 increase in your taxes? Would you be very willing, somewhat willing, or not at all willing?"

8. Willingness to pay is a survey-based method to determine monetary valuation of interventions that can-
not be examined in the marketplace. Formal methodological analysis and validity testing of willingness to
pay has not been fully established. The limited published literature has shown some evidence that an
open-ended form of monetary valuation and dichotomous choice survey questions may overestimate ac-
tual willingness to pay. See B. Liljas and K. Blumenschein, "On Hypothetical Bias and Calibration in
Cost-Benefit Studies," Health Policy 52, no. 1 (2000): 53­70; and K. Blumenschein et al., "Hypothetical ver-
sus Real Willingness to Pay in the Health Care Sector: Results from a Field Experiment," Health Economics
20, no. 3 (2001): 441­457. To reduce such potential bias, we used stated values for each policy option and
asked respondents the level of their support. The survey questions were asked in a hierarchical fash-
ion-that is, only the respondents who said that they supported the policy option were asked the $250
willingness-to-pay question, and so forth. This approach may reduce the impact of willingness-to-pay re-
sponses that clearly are not possible.
9. Given the recent focus on a tax cut, respondents might have felt differently and reported higher levels of fi-
nancial support if the survey had discussed a reduced tax cut in return for benefits versus a tax increase in
return for benefits. Willingness-to-pay questionnaires have been shown to be sensitive to how the ques-
tions are worded and whether a reduction or an increase is proposed.

13. In the survey, a special screener was developed to identify respondents with a chronic condition or who
were caregivers for someone with a chronic condition, or both. Respondents were asked if they had a con-
dition that has lasted or was expected to last twelve months or more and if it placed limitations on any one
of the following: (1) age-appropriate task performance, including school attendance for children and work
for adults; (2) basic self-care; or (3) independent-living skills necessary for community residence; or if the
condition required ongoing medical intervention. If a respondent answered yes to any of these questions,
they were deemed to have a chronic condition. The respondent was also queried as to whether he or she
currently or in the past year acted as a caregiver. This was defined as anyone who provides unpaid help or
arranges for paid or unpaid help for a relative or friend because they have a chronic illness or because they
are getting older. For complete regression results, contact the authors at ganderso@jhsph.edu.
