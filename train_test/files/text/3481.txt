Abstract
Objectives: To quantify microRNA-9 (miR-9) concentrations in the serum of patients with
osteosarcoma; to explore its relationship with clinicopathological characteristics and prognosis of
osteosarcoma.
Method: Serum miR-9 was quantified via real-time reverse transcription­polymerase chain
reaction in patients with osteosarcoma and healthy control subjects. Overall survival was evaluated
using the Kaplan­Meier method.
Results: Serum miR-9 was significantly upregulated in patients with osteosarcoma (n ¼ 118)
compared with healthy control subjects (n ¼ 60); its upregulation was significantly associated with
advanced tumour­node­metastasis stage, larger tumour size and presence of distant metastasis.
Overall survival duration was significantly shorter in patients with relatively high miR-9
concentrations compared with those with relatively low miR-9 concentrations.
Conclusions: Serum miR-9 concentrations are significantly increased in patients with osteosar-
coma compared with healthy controls. Upregulation of miR-9 is associated with tumour stage, size
and metastasis. Serum miR-9 quantification may represent a useful diagnostic and prognostic
marker of osteosarcoma.

Introduction
Osteosarcoma is the most common primary
malignancy in children and young adoles-
cents, accounting for $60% of malignant
bone tumours in the first two decades of
life.1 Despite of treatment combining
chemotherapy, surgery and/or radiother-
apy, the prognosis of patients with recurrent
or metastatic osteosarcoma remains poor,

Developments in molecular biology have
provided insight into the pathogenesis of
osteosarcoma, but the fundamental molecu-
lar mechanisms underlying the histological
heterogeneity, drug resistance and develop-
ment of metastasis remain largely unclear.
Thus, the identification of novel drug targets
is very important for improving the clinical
outcome of these patients.
Micro RNAs (miRNAs) are short, highly
conserved, small (22­25 nucleotides), non-
coding RNA molecules that regulate gene
expression via repression of translation and
cleavage of mRNA by base pairing to the 30
untranslated region of target genes.4­6
Abnormal miRNA expression is found in
various human tumours including osteosar-
coma,7 and is associated with proliferation,
differentiation, apoptosis and invasion of
tumour cells.8­10 MiRNAs are present in a
stable form in human serum and plasma,
suggesting the potential use of circulating
miRNAs as stable blood-based markers for
the detection of cancer or other human
diseases.11­13
MicroRNA-9 is upregulated in many
tumour types including colorectal,14
breast15 and non-small cell lung cancer,16
but its role in the progression of osteosar-
coma remains unknown. The aim of this
study, therefore, was to analyse the associ-
ation between serum miR-9 concentrations
and clinicopathological features and prog-
nosis, in patients with osteosarcoma.
Patients and methods
Study population
The study retrospectively enrolled patients
with primary osteosarcoma who were surgi-
cally treated in the Department of Ortho-
paedics, China­Japan Union Hospital of
Jilin University, Changchun, China,
between January 2007 and September 2012.
Tumours were classified according to the 6th
edition of the tumour­node­metastasis
(TNM) classification of the International
Union Against Cancer (UICC).17 Clinico-
pathological features were recorded at the
time of serum sampling. Inclusion criteria
were no metastasis at presentation and no
history of previous treatment. Patients were
excluded if they had a previous or secondary
malignancy.
Healthy control subjects were recruited
from individuals with no previous cancer
diagnosis who were undergoing routine
health checks at the Physical Health
Examination Centre, China­Japan Union
Hospital of Jilin University.
The study was approved by the Research
Ethics Committee of China­Japan Union
Hospital of Jilin University and all partici-
pants provided written informed consent
prior to enrolment.
Quantitative RT­PCR
Peripheral venous blood (10 ml) was taken
from all study participants using standard
methods, after an overnight fast. Blood was
kept at room temperature for 60 min then
centrifuged at 1000 g for 10 min at 4C.
Serum was immediately separated, frozen
and stored at À80C until analysis.
Total RNA was extracted from 400 ml
serum (miRNeasy Mini Kit; QIAGEN,
Hilden, Germany) according to the manu-
facturer's instructions, and miR-9 was quan-
tified by real-time quantitative reverse
transcription­polymerase chain reaction
(RT­PCR) using the TaqManÕ miRNA
assay system (Applied Biosystems, Foster
City, CA, USA). RNA was reverse tran-
scribed using the Universal cDNA synthesis
kit (Exiqon; Woburn, MA, USA) according
to the manufacturer's instructions. Primer
sequences were 50-UCUUUGGUUAUCU
AGCUGUAUGA-30 (for miR-9) and
50-CGTTCACGAATTTGCGTGTCAT-30
(for RNA U6, internal control; both
Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). The PCR
reaction mix comprised 4 ml cDNA, 10 ml
Fei et al. 933
LightCyclerÕ 480 ProbesMaster (Roche
Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany), 4 ml
water and 2 ml gene-specific TaqManÕ
primer/probe mix, in a final volume of
20 ml. Cycling conditions were an initial
denaturation step at 95C for 5 min, fol-
lowed by 40 cycles of 95C for 10 s and 60C
for 1 min, then a final elongation step
at 72C for 5 min. PCR was performed
on a LightCyclerÕ 480 System II (Roche
Diagnostics). The concentration of miR-9
relative to RNA U6 was calculated accord-
ing to the equation 2ÀÁÁCT, where
ÁÁCT ¼ (CTmiR-21
ÀCTU6
).18 All samples
were examined in triplicate.
Follow-up
For analysis of survival time, the date of
surgery was used as the beginning of the
follow-up period. Patients who died from
other disease or from unexpected events
were excluded from the study. Follow-up
continued until July 2013.
Statistical analyses
Data were expressed as mean Æ SD.
Between-group comparisons were made
using Student's t-test or Pearson's 2-test,
as appropriate. Patients were stratified into
high or low miR-9 groups relative to the
median miR-9 concentration. The associ-
ation between miR-9 serum concentrations
and overall survival was evaluated using
Kaplan­Meier analysis. Statistical analyses
were performed using GraphPad Prism ver-
sion 5.01 (GraphPad Software, San Diego,
CA, USA) and SPSSÕ version 19.0 (SPSS
Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) for WindowsÕ. All
tests were two-tailed, and P-values < 0.05
were considered statistically significant.
Results
The study included 118 patients with osteo-
sarcoma (50 male/68 female; mean age
22.2 Æ 2.2 years, range 8­68 years) and 60
control subjects (28 male/32 female; mean
age 23.5 Æ 2.1 years, range 7­59 years).
There were no significant between-group
differences in age or sex. Clinicopathological
features of the patient group are summar-
ized in Table 1. The median duration of
follow-up was 48 months (range 10­81
months). During the follow-up period, 38
patients (32.2%) died of disease. The 5-year
survival rate was 41.5% (49/118).
Serum miR-9 concentrations were signifi-
cantly higher in patients than healthy con-
trol subjects (4.45 Æ 0.74 and 2.53 Æ 0.62,
respectively; P < 0.01).
Data regarding the association between
miR-9 concentration and clinicopathologi-
cal features are shown in Table 1. MiR-9
was significantly upregulated in patients
with advanced clinical stage (IIB­III vs I­
IIA), large tumour diameter (!8 cm
vs < 8 cm) and distant metastasis (vs no
distant metastasis) (P < 0.01 for each com-
parison). There was no significant associ-
ation between miR-9 concentration and age,
sex or tumour location.
Kaplan­Meier analysis (Figure 1) found
that patients with relatively high miR-9
concentrations (expression) had signifi-
cantly shorter survival times than those
with relatively low miR-9 concentrations
(P ¼ 0.002).
Discussion
Serum miR-9 concentrations were increased
in patients with osteosarcoma compared
with healthy control subjects in the present
study. In addition, miR-9 concentrations
were significantly associated with TNM
stage, tumour diameter and metastasis, and
patients with relatively high serum miR-9
concentrations had a significantly poorer
outcome than those with relatively low
concentrations. Taken together, these data
suggest that miR-9 could be a valuable
prognostic indicator for osteosarcoma.

To our knowledge, this is the first study to
investigate the clinical significance of miR-9
in a large number of patients with
osteosarcoma.
MicroRNA-9 was identified as a crucial
regulator of nervous-system development,
physiology and pathology in organisms
including zebra fish, Drosophila and mam-
mals.19­21 Altered miR-9 expression is
associated with the development and pro-
gression of cancers,22­25 but the expression
patterns and role of miR-9 are diverse. In
some tumours (including neuroblastoma,26
medulloblastoma27 and ovarian cancer28)
miR-9 is downregulated and functions
as a tumour suppressor; in other can-
cers (including colorectal,14 breast15 and

miR-9 promotes cancer-cell growth and/or
metastasis. MiR-9 concentrations were
higher in patients with osteosarcoma than
normal controls in the present study, and
upregulation of miR-9 was associated with
tumour aggressiveness and metastasis. Our
data support the notion that miR-9 plays
different roles in different tumours.
The current finding that miR-9 was upre-
gulated in patients with osteosarcoma com-
pared with healthy controls is consistent with
others who found that miR-9 was highly
expressed in osteosarcoma clinical samples
and inversely correlated with the predicted
target gene, transforming growth factor b
receptor II (TGFBR2).29 The molecular
mechanisms underlying miR-9 and the regu-
lation of osteosarcoma carcinogenesis
remain unclear and require further study.
In conclusion, the present study found
that serum miR-9 levels are significantly
increased in patients with osteosarcoma
compared with healthy controls, and that
the upregulation of miR-9 is associated with
tumour stage, size and metastasis. Serum
miR-9 may represent a useful diagnostic and
prognostic marker of osteosarcoma.
