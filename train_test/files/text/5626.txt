Abstract
This paper explores the changing roles of families in children's developing literacy in the
UK in the last century. It discusses how, during this time, understandings of reading and
writing have evolved into the more nuanced notion of literacy. Further, in acknowledging
changes in written communication practices, and shifting attitudes to reading and writ-
ing, the paper sketches out how families have always played some part in the literacy of
younger generations; though reading was frequently integral to the lives of many families
throughout the past century, we consider in particular the more recent enhancement of
children's literacy through targeted family programmes. The paper considers policy
implications for promoting young children's literacy through work with families.

Introduction: From reading and writing to literacy
Working with families to promote children's early literacy development in the
UK is a relatively recent practice, having evolved over the last two decades (see
Hannon (1995) for a discussion of this). Only in the last decade has policy
acknowledged the home learning environment as important to developing
young readers (DfE, 2012; Sylva et al., 2004). However, it is also important to
understand the historical roots of reading in families that have brought us to a
point where family literacy is, at the least, not unusual.

Of course, in the hundred years that this paper spans, `literacy' itself is a
relatively recent term, and we adopt as a starting point the UNESCO definition
of it as the:
. . . ability to identify, understand, interpret, create, communicate and compute,
using printed and written materials associated with varying contexts [which]
involve a continuum of learning in enabling individuals to achieve their goals,
to develop their knowledge and potential, and to participate fully in their
community and wider society. (UNESCO, 2005: 27)
To this we add Hannon's earlier recognition of literacy practices as part of
the socio cultural tools of the community:
Literacy is the ability to use written language to derive and convey meaning.
In the teaching of literacy one generation equips the next with a powerful
cultural tool. Written language enables members of a culture to communicate
without meeting: to express and explore their experience; to store information,
ideas and knowledge; to extend their memory and thinking. (Hannon, op.
cit.: 27)
These fairly simple definitions show most policy definitions to be merely
functional, and anticipate the idea of literacy as a social practice (Barton and
Hamilton, 1998).
The emergence of literacy
`Literacy' is a relatively recent term which first took on some shared currency in
the UK as an umbrella term for reading and writing in the late 20th century
(however, interestingly, the first documented instance was in the United
States in 1880). While referred to as `English' in the UK Education Reform
Act 1988, which heralded the National Curriculum in English schools, `English'
became known in primary schools as `literacy' with the advent of the National
Literacy Strategy from 1997 (DfE, 2011; Jolliffe, 2004; Machin and McNally,
2008). For most UK national and local policies, literacy is broadly identifiable
with a traditional notion of reading and writing skills (with more recent
acknowledgment of oral expression as an important co-function). Other cur-
rent uses, such as in the terms `visual literacy', `emotional literacy' and `e-literacy',
indicate a heterogeneity which enhances a broadly politicised conception of
`competence' or `aptitude' as functions of enhanced identity.

It would be naive to proceed with the assumption that literacy can be
viewed as simply `the reading and writing of written language'. Although
functional definitions of literacy may be useful, they have in recent years
become overwritten with ideology, often politically saturated. Perspectives
on literacy include the complexity of the abilities to understand and use
persuasively the dominant symbol systems of cultures. These abilities include,
to varying degrees, the manipulation of media and electronic text, in addition
to alphabetic and numerical systems, and they vary in different social and
cultural contexts according to politicised needs, demands and forms of edu-
cation (Lankshear and Knobel 2003; Merchant 2007).
Literacy practices, the way we use text to interact with others, are inter-
woven with individual and group identities and practices. Fast-developing
digital technologies have prompted particular emphasis on new multimodal
practices, such as the use of graphic, spatial and pictorial elements, and
evolving typographical conventions (Finnegan, 2002); in addition, literacy
is now part of wider multimodal communication practices. While `literacy has
always developed hand in hand with the technologies' (Bazerman, 2004), today's tech-
nological explosion is effectively redefining literacy and its practice in homes,
schools and communities.
There is an academic argument about the extent to which consideration of
oral expression should contribute towards a definition of literacy. In a close
examination of the historical development of literacy, Graff argues for the `vital
role of socio-historical context' and a belief that literacy is `profoundly misunderstood' (Graff,
1987: 17). Havelock (1976) makes a strong argument that because human
beings have used speech for far longer than the graphics of alphabetic literacy,
oracy should take precedence within any definition. Galbraith (1997) similarly
argues that as recently as in late 19th century Britain, `there was no clean break between
orality and literacy, but instead a mix of the two within individual life cycles and in families and
communities' (Galbraith, 1997: 3). In some families and cultures, oracy remains
the dominant form of communication, and in others writing is more strongly
related to the visual than the oral mode (Yamada-Rice, 2015); and awareness that
systems of reading and writing vary between cultures has implications for under-
standing home literacies in the multicultural context of the UK, and indeed in
cultures across the world. Thus, we need to remain mindful of the complexities
of definitions and of their relation to multiple lived realities. Though not easily
captured in convenient conceptualisation, any exploration of the evolution of
literacy highlights the need to recognise from the outset that terms such as
`literacy', `orality', `reading' and `writing' must be viewed from the perspective
of the social, political and economic context across time and space.
Nutbrown et al. 553
Two related assumptions impact on the ways in which literacy has been
perceived and defined: first, that concepts of literacy acquisition are often regarded as
synonymous with concepts of education and schooling. Etymologically, there is a link
between literacy in the sense of being `lettered'/able to read and write, and
having access to education through `literature', and hence being `literate' in
the broader sense of `learned'. This illustrates the cultural capital long asso-
ciated with written text. Olsen (1975: 149) argues that the `currency of schools is
words' and that schools are themselves `shaped up for the requirements of literacy'.
Olsen goes on to state that literate people, such as educators, tend to place an
unrealistic value on the role of literacy in society, stating that literacy `is over-
valued because of the very structure of formal schooling' (Olsen, 1975: 149). Olsen is
suggesting here that it is a mistake to assume that the `values and pleasure' of
literacy are so great that all individuals will want to seek at least a high level of
literacy through the medium of education. This misconception is further
recognised by Elasser and John-Steiner (1977: 361) who question the
widely held belief that `education in and of itself can transform both people's sense of
power and the existing social and economic hierarchies', and they go on to claim that this
view is naive because `educational intervention without social change is, in fact, ineffective'.
A second assumption is that the literacy skills acquired through education
are in themselves agents of change. Graff (1987: 18) cautions against the
temptation to assign `consequences', `implications' or `concomitants' to the
acquisition of literacy, arguing that literacy in itself is simply `a learned or
acquired skill' and must therefore be viewed as a `basis or foundation' rather
than `an end or conclusion' in its own right (Graff, 1987: 19). Graff recog-
nises that what follows from a foundation is possibly of greater concern,
while Nutbrown argues that understanding the literacy capabilities of
young children should be the basis for their future literacy development in
the social context of the home: `literacy processes and outcomes cannot be
divorced from the range of social contexts in which they occur' (Nutbrown,
1997: 27).
Literacy practices provide children with values, attitudes, motivations, ways
of interacting and perspectives, which together construct the primary iden-
tities that children acquire through early socialisation (Gee, 2004) in their
families and communities. So, a child becomes `a person like us' (Gee, 2004:
23), a member of a particular family belonging to a particular socio cultural
group. For Gee, `people like us' do and value `things like this' that involve specific
types of language. This notion that `people like us' do and value `things like this'
can mean that, for some children, the `things they do' are extensive and wide-
ranging; for others, they are restricted by poverty, ill-health and limited

social and cultural capital. The challenge for education, then, is to discover
and widely replicate those literacy experiences which enhance children's
capital.
Research questions and methodological approach
Research questions
This paper is focused around the broad question: What part did families play
in the development of children's literacy in the UK throughout the 20th
century? And more specifically we ask, first, how has reading been part of
family life in the UK throughout the past century? By understanding how
reading has been rooted in the home, the longevity, everydayness and perhaps
futures of home literacy practices can be appreciated and better understood.
Secondly, we ask, what part have family literacy programmes played in sup-
porting young children's early literacy development? With early intervention
being an espoused policy of the UK government (Chowdry and Oppenheim,
2015; Cunha and Heckman, 2007; Heckman, 2006), it is crucial to have a
critical understanding of the contribution of programmes to enhanced family
literacy.
The focus in this paper on literacy learning in families called for a histori-
ography of literacy, for while current meanings and practices of literacy are
often contested, they are also readily understood in the `everyday'. The meth-
odologies which have been used to define literacy practices Â­ and the peda-
gogies which have thus been generated Â­ have changed radically since the
emergence of `Enlightenment' values.
Methodological approach
The period of time studied. We have drawn on select scholarship, policy and
legislative literatures in a systematic search of the academic and `grey' dissem-
inations on reading, writing and literacy in families throughout the 20th
century, and focused fairly exclusively on reports and studies from 1900 to
2000. At the margins of this period, we reached further back in the case of UK
education legislation so as better to understand the educational context at the
start of the given period, and we have drawn on studies published in the early
part of the 21st century which shed light on our focus period. The salient
features of this period include two World Wars, extensive expansion in state
education, varying economic conditions and significant demographic changes
in the UK.
Nutbrown et al. 555
Databases and search criteria. To find research and grey literature pertinent to our
study, systematic searches were carried out through the Education Resource
Information Centre (ERIC) and British Education Index (BEI) education data-
bases, and through key journals in the field of early and family literacy for the
period under study. As relevant research articles were identified, their citations
were followed up to identify further sources. Key search terms included:
reading, writing, literacy, family literacy, early literacy, parents, home literacy,
family literacy programmes and family literacy practices.
We also identified major educational legislation in England to seek to
understand the values and priorities which lay behind the particular formu-
lation of a policy within a specific socio political context and more or less
embedded conceptions of literacy. Examples include the 1944 Education Act
(McCulloch, 1997), or the serial raising of the school-leaving age during the
20th and 21st centuries from 13 in 1880 to 18 by 2015.
Analytical processes. Our analysis was governed by our research questions and
sought to uncover understandings of family literacy practices over the last hun-
dred years or so, a period spanning two World Wars, extensive expansion in of
state education, varying economic conditions and significant changes to the
population of England. We were also seeking to understand the part that
family literacy programmes played in the later part of the period under study.
We categorised the literature identified in our search according to three main
themes: (i) reading, writing and `literacy', (ii) family literacy practices, (iii)
family literacy programmes. There was, of course some overlap with some
sources referring to one, two or all three main themes. Other secondary
themes, such as gender, social class, age, language, digital literacies and learn-
ing difficulties, also emerged in our analysis but, while important, these are
not the primary focus of this paper.
Having described our methodological approach, the next section will iden-
tify and discuss the emergence, throughout a century, of written communi-
cation practices from reading and writing to literacy.
What part did families play in the development of
children's literacy in the UK throughout the last century?
Learning to read and write has long been a key part of the UK education
system. From the end of the 19th century onwards,1 we can see that major
educational legislation in England variously supported the development of
reading and later `literacy'. Subsequent education legislation2 had at its core
556 Journal of Early Childhood Literacy 17(4)
a desire that children should learn to read (and later write). Such legislation
discloses both the values and socio-economic priorities of their times and thus
point to the quotidian circumstances (of schooling, for example) which
informed an attitude towards reading and writing ability in the UK by the
beginning of the 20th century. Most significantly, however, education legis-
lation in the past mostly failed to acknowledge the part that many families
played in the development of young readers. Neither does it seem that the
literacy difficulties of parents were paid sufficient attention, as Moser (1999:
23) argues, `when parents have trouble with reading, writing, or numeracy, it
is more likely that their children will start with a similar disadvantage at
school'. Vincent (2000: 348) demonstrates the disconnect between education
policy and the home lives of many children: . . . recent research has demonstrated that
the likelihood of a child benefiting from contemporary literacy campaigns is strongly influenced by
the level of attainment in its family background.
The role of the family in children's learning was highlighted in the 1980s
when parents' roles in their children's learning began to receive official policy
recognition. The Rumbold Report (DfE, 1989), for example, identified par-
ents as the `first educators' of their children, arguing that what children learn
at home, with their families, before they attend any form of group and well
before school, was a crucial part of a child's learning experience. From this
point on, subsequent policies have made explicit mention of parents' involve-
ment, and schools and other early years settings today are required positively
to involve parents (DfE, 2014), many running specific programmes for them
focusing on literacy.
How has reading been part of family life in the UK throughout
the past century?
If we look across the decades, we can see how reading has long been part of
many families' lives and the responsibility for teaching children to read has
passed variously between home and school throughout the last century and
across the social classes, for different reasons. Most European countries made
mass literacy a goal over the course of the 20th century, moving from homes
and communities being the places where reading (and writing) was often
learned and used, to establishing schools as the locus of control (Vincent,
2000). This move established the school as the place where reading was taught,
and the home as the place where children practised their learning.
Despite some sporadic initiatives going as far back as the late 1800s to pro-
mote home reading, it remained the case during the 1950s that parents in
Nutbrown et al. 557
England were still largely excluded from the mysteries of teaching reading Â­ it
being the clearly marked territory of the school. Yet the pendulum swings, and
in June 2014, the Chief Inspector of schools in England stated that parents who
did not read to their children should be fined. While, over the years, the home
has played a part in supporting the development of children's reading
(Auerbach, 1989; Baghban, 1984; Hannon, 1995; Neumann and Roskos,
1997; Petellier and Brent 2002; Taylor and Dorsey-Gaines, 1988), in the
main it has been mothers who have been the main supporters of their children's
home reading activity (Mace, 1998). Hartas (2011) identified that literacy
development in young children at age five is more directly related to the
mother's level of education than it is to family income, also a finding of a
study by Nutbrown et al. (2005), who also identified considerable involvement
of fathers in their young children's literacy at home (Morgan et al., 2009).
The literature on home reading in the UK following Second World War is
sparse, yet something of the `therapeutic' potential of books was seen to be
important (Moore, 1943). Frank Smith offered an important justification for
supporting parents to help their children learn to read and to enjoy reading at
home through a range of media, arguing that: until education . . . became systemat-
ically organised in the middle of the 19th century, the prevailing point of view had for centuries
been that you learn from the company you keep (Smith, 2011: 14).
Between the 1950s and the 1980s, a number of studies shifted the empha-
sis towards schools working with parents, explicitly to encourage them to
teach their children to read. Reading at home was becoming an activity that
was no longer left to chance but actively facilitated (Gomberg, 1970; Hannon
and Jackson, 1987; Larrick, 1959; Niedermeyer, 1970). Hansen (1969) iden-
tified significant links between the home environment and later reading
habits, and encouraged schools to work with parents to address reading
difficulties. In the US, Taylor and Strickland (1986) followed families who
regularly shared storybooks with their children, and provided advice for other
families, explaining why sharing books is `good', how it helps with writing,
and which books to read. The influence of parental attitude on reading and its
resulting motivational influence on children was also explored by Baker et al.
(1997), who found that only 6 per cent of young children in the study did
not enjoy being read to, and that parents made conscious efforts in their
reading to foster motivation. While access to books is crucial, the role of a
mediator, a parent or other close adult, who spends time with the child and
makes reading `exciting', is also important (Cullinan, 2000). Nutbrown and
Hannon (2003) found that despite the fact that children in their first term of
full-time school are required to read with their teacher every day, they
558 Journal of Early Childhood Literacy 17(4)
identified the home as the place for reading, which is echoed by Collins and
Svensson's (2008) finding that rich home-literacy environments where par-
ents discuss books with their children are a factor contributing to the devel-
opment of confident young readers. This built on earlier work which
highlighted how positive enhancement of rich home-literacy environments
by a book-gifting scheme or library membership contributed to the accessi-
bility of books and improved parents' and carers' attitudes towards reading
with their children (Hines and Brooks 2009; Treasury, 2004; Wells 1986).
The international literature acknowledges the importance of reading at
home (Brown et al., 2013; Corter and Petellier, 2005; Harper et al., 2011;
Swain et al 2014); however, this was not always the case and, in England, two
important national initiatives in the latter part of the 19th century changed
access to books for all Â­ opening the way for the changes seen in the 20th
century. The establishment of public libraries3 made books freely available to
all, and the National Home Reading Union, 1889Â­1930, positively promoted
reading for pleasure (Baker et al., 1997; Buckingham et al., 2013; Collins
1890; Snape, 2002). In England in the 1980s, Gibbs (1983) argued for spe-
cial training for children's librarians so as to take their important role in child
development into account. The role of libraries has evolved, from a source of
freely available books to the provision of digital devices, magazines, e-books,
music, films and electronic games. Where they have survived savage cuts in
public spending, more recently, libraries have become community spaces
where children experience literacy in a multitude of forms (Pahl and Allen,
2011). In 1948, Banton Smith argued that reading materials tended to be
chosen on the basis of presuppositions, political leanings and so on, with the
majority of readers looking to read material which reinforced their opinions.
In essence, what Banton Smith (1948) and her contemporaries describe is
what Bourdieu (1986) and Bourdieu et al. (1994) would later refer to as
`cultural capital'. Today, reading still functions as a vital access point to society
and can lead to increased social engagement, and `even the benefits of dem-
ocracy, and the capacity to govern ourselves successfully, depend on reading'
(Cullinan, 2000); thus reading as part of an individual's social identity and/or
cultural capital is reinforced.
As reading choices and modes have expanded with the advancement of
technology, increasing numbers of children now have access to smartphones
and tablets, using these to communicate across various social media (Ofcom,
2012), with much of this including literacy practices (Marsh et al., 2005;
Merchant, 2007). Rapid developments in digital technologies have opened
access to global communications inconceivable a century, or even a decade,
Nutbrown et al. 559
ago. These developments have prompted new understandings of what reading
and writing are and how literacy is shaped (Prensky, 2001); and as words,
images, sounds, colours, animations, videos and styles of print can now be
quickly combined, this highlights the importance of context, purpose and
practices around print, including family literacy practices (Marsh et al.,
2015). A key message is that while literacy has changed, fundamental practices
within families have not. For, regardless of changing modes or practices of lit-
eracy, for some in every generation, literacy has been a part of family life.
However, for others, this has not been the case, and so in order to try to
ensure that all have the benefits of reading at home, family literacy programmes
have been introduced in various parts of the world as an intergenerational
response to reduce the perpetuation of low levels of literacy.
What part have family literacy programmes played in supporting young
children's early literacy development?
Hannon et al. (2005) stress the importance of family literacy that acknowledges
and makes use of learners' family relationships and engagement in family literacy practices.
Wasik and Van Horn (2012) suggest that:
The intergenerational transfer of literacy has intrigued educators, researchers
and policy makers and served as a fundamental rationale for family literacy
programmes. . . . Not only does the family determine the child's early language,
but a family's culture, beliefs, and traditions also influence the way children use
words for discourse (Heath, 1983). Their family's literacy levels also influence
whether children develop strong language skills and literacy at home, having
many print materials available and modelling the use of reading, writing and
math in daily life. (Wasik and Van Horn, 2012: 3)
Family literacy has, for the past three decades, been seen as a way of
minimising some of the inequalities in children's literacy development
when they begin school (Brown et al., 2013; Corter and Petellier 2005;
Harper et al., 2011; Swain et al., 2014). Family literacy practices embrace the
ordinary and everyday literacy events that take place (often with little or no con-
scious planning) in families, while family literacy programmes are planned sys-
tematically and specifically to encourage and maximise the potential for
children's engagement in those practices. There is clear evidence that family
literacy can positively enhance children's engagement in literacy (Brooks
et al., 2012; Nutbrown et al., 2005; Swain et al., 2014).
560 Journal of Early Childhood Literacy 17(4)
While family literacy programmes recognise the family dimension in individ-
uals' learning, literacy practices within families play a crucial part in developing
children's literacy. The term `family literacy' was first attributed to Taylor
(1983), in the United States, who showed how young children's early literacy
practices were influenced by parents' and other family members' uses of writ-
ten language. Many studies have illuminated existing family literacy practices
(Weinberger, 1996) in a range of social classes and ethnicity groupings, result-
ing in a strong international research base depicting a variety of language and
literacy practices in families: on reading (Baker et al., 1997; Brown et al., 2013;
Harper et al., 2011; Heath, 1982); on bilingualism (Gregory, 1996; Harper
et al., 2011; Hirst, 1998; Moss, 1994); the impact of home background
(Purcell-Gates, 1995; Teale, 1986; Taylor and Dorsey-Gaines, 1988); differing
views of parents and teachers (Hannon and James, 1990); on the role of
communities (Barton and Hamilton, 1998; Cairney and Ruge, 1998; Corter
and Petellier 2005); on the benefits of family literacy programmes (Swain et al.,
2014) and on digital technologies in family literacy (Marsh et al., 2015).
Shared experiences of intergenerational family literacy and family involve-
ment and encouragement of young children's literacy have ranged, for exam-
ple, from the whole family gathering together to read the Bible (in the earliest
part of the period under study) to shared Internet searching for information
and online gaming. Educational initiatives with parents since the 1950s have
aimed at encouraging parents to become involved in their children's learning,
and work since the 1980s has focused on parents being actively engaged in
supporting early literacy development (Hannon, 1995). We now know much
more about family literacy practices (Auerbach, 1989; Brown et al., 2013;
Wasik & Van Horn, 2012; Weinberger, 1996; Wolfendale and Topping,
1996), and programmes to help parents support their children's developing
literacy are well established in many parts of the world (Brooks et al., 2012;
Edwards, 1994; Nutbrown et al., 2005; Swain et al., 2014). Such pro-
grammes to encourage home reading highlight the importance of owning
and reading a wide repertoire of books through book-loan or book-gifting
schemes (Jerrim, 2013).
In England in the 1980s, initiatives were introduced to connect school and
home reading, and so the concept of `parents as educators' (Topping, 1986)
emerged. The Haringey Reading Project (Tizard et al., 1982) persuaded
schools to send children's reading books home regularly. Later, the Belfield
Project (Hannon and Jackson, 1987) encouraged children to take books home
daily and offered support to parents in reading with their children. Nowadays,
this is basic practice, but in the 1980s this was innovative and extended
Nutbrown et al. 561
children's opportunities to practise reading at home. That school and home
shared responsibility for children's learning and development (Glynn, 1996)
prompted the development of partnership models specifically to promote
literacy development. Amongst these was the home reading model PACT Â­
`Parents and Children and Teachers' (Hewison and Tizard, 1980), whereby
children took books home from school on a regular basis to read with their
parents and similar schemes grew around the UK (Branston, 1996; Glynn,
1996). Awareness that literacy practices differ between families led to a model
of `family literacy' from the Basic Skills Agency in 1994 (Brooks et al., 1997,
1999) which focused on adults' and children's literacy. It also sought to
reduce the achievement gap at school-start age by encouraging parental
involvement in the pre-school years (Hannon, 1996).
Around the late 20th and early 21st centuries, concerns from schools and
politicians about a lack of reading surfaced Â­ particularly in the US and the UK
Â­ and researchers looked for ways to persuade parents about the positive
impact of home reading. Here again, the notion of cultural capital comes to
the fore, with reading at home being connected to Bourdieu's notion of
habitus Â­ a way of being which is multiply influenced by notions of family,
culture, society, history, language and so on. Reay (1998) argued that while
white middle-class mothers were comfortable in becoming involved in their
child's education, mothers from minority backgrounds and `working-class'
mothers found themselves in a position where they were expected to trans-
form their habitus, a prospect with which they often engaged unsuccessfully.
Of course, combining all mothers from several different minority back-
grounds into one single grouping of `minority groups' raises its own diffi-
culties because `minorities' represent many different social backgrounds, and
this illustrates the difficulty of `reading off' such research to identify single
pertinent issues to be resolved. In the US, Edwards (1994) argued strongly
that black working-class and unemployed mothers should be taught the skills
that white middle-class mothers already had, so that they too could support
their own children's literacy development. Hartas (2011) also suggested that
mothers who are `educated' are more likely to be able to identify and access
activities for their children, and argued for educating parents so that they
might be better equipped to help their children. In Hartas's view, parental
involvement, while strongly effective, should not be seen as a `panacea for making
up for the effects of socio-economic inequality' (2011: 909), but part of a coherent
policy designed to address social-justice issues. Researchers seem to agree that,
whatever their social class or family heritage, parents are in the main keen to
support their children's literacy learning and see reading as important
562 Journal of Early Childhood Literacy 17(4)
(Auerbach, 1989; Blackledge, 2001). Our analysis indicates that, in recent
years, family literacy programmes have become better adapted to the range
of needs, interests and backgrounds of the diversity of families who
participate.
Conclusion
As we have seen, what is understood by literacy now is very different from the
more simply defined acts of reading and writing at the beginning of the 20th
century. The types of `capital' associated with literacy and the extent to which
oral expression in the development of communication practices have become
inseparable from the `literate' mean that what one reads and how one speaks
hold different `capital' in different strata of society. It is clear that reading and
writing are now part of wider `literacy' practices incorporating digital tech-
nologies non-existent in the early 1900s.
Definitions and constructions of literacy are highly context-dependent and
we must acknowledge the vital role of socio-historical context. This means
that, as we move further into the 21st century, we are obliged not only to
recognise the impact of digital technology, but also the need to strive actively
to understand how advancement in media and electronic text is changing
constructions and practices of literacy in families and how these practices
connect to other communicative modes and change the very nature of text
(Cook-Gumperz, 2006). This in turn challenges modern notions of what it
means to be literate, and what it will mean in the future.
This paper has highlighted the importance of the home in children
developing reading along with the need for children to engage with home
literacy practices from their earliest years. Families can and do support their
children at home, and while literacy has changed throughout the 20th century
and beyond, fundamental practices in families have not. In recent years, family
literacy programmes have become better adapted to the range of needs, interests
and backgrounds of the diversity of families who participate, and this needs to
become further embedded in educational practice so that more parents can
confidently support their children's literacy development and enhance their
socio cultural capital.
We have highlighted the powerful role that families play in developing the
literacy of younger generations. We have also seen that this role can be posi-
tively extended and supported by planned work with families. However, we
should be cautious about the ways in which current policies ignore hard-won
insights into the crucial role of the family. For while literacy has become
Nutbrown et al. 563
broadly defined, English policy Â­ particularly in the early years Â­ has effect-
ively re-narrowed this definition and seems somehow to have reverted to an
earlier conception of reading and writing which was a defining characteristic
of educational practice in the early part of the 20th century. Further, while
family literacy practices are now invigorated by the realm of the digital, edu-
cation policy in general, and again most particularly in the early years, has yet
fully to embed the technologies that are inexorably part of the character and
terrain of quite what it is to be literate; and of course, this drives a wedge
between home and school literacy practices. In a manner reminiscent of the
early 20th century, we are hearing again a distinct echo of the failure to realise
the vital continuity of the homeÂ­school partnership that is worthy of the
name.

An earlier review of literature commissioned by Booktrust into reading, writing and
social mobility whetted our appetite to focus on a historical perspective of literacy in
families.
