Abstract
In order to shed light on the "black box" of institutional equity investing in a systematic
manner, I conducted a broadly based questionnaire which received a large response from
German mutual fund companies. The survey asked fund managers for their basic views and
practices and for insights into their company's performance-measurement and compensa-
tion incentives. It was possible to identify three core types of investors, labelled
fundamentalists, tacticians and methodologists, in the data on investment behaviour.
Common to all types is the primary aim of achieving above-average returns on investment
with due allowance being made for sluggishness in the reaction of market prices to new in-
formation. Another universal feature of institutional equity investing turns out to be a
heavy reliance on information sources which offer a means of confirmation and through
which the contagions of fear and exuberance may be transmitted. In general fund managers
exhibit a pronounced preference for "winner-type" and "spotlight" stocks as well. All in-
vestor groups recognise, in the first instance, underlying economic information as a source
of superior value. However, a potential for exaggerated market dynamics is suggested by
the fact that the mere arrival of news from corporations or analysts' earnings revisions is
generally thought to impart as strong a market impulse as the perceived mispricing of
stocks relative to the market or sector as such. Furthermore, those who appear to be best
suited to conduct fundamental arbitrage are nevertheless likely to be constrained, to a sig-
nificant extent, by time horizons and the fear of market movements. Besides investment
focus and basic attitudes towards market efficiency, agency problems are shown to have a
bearing on equity fund managers' investment behaviour.

Zusammenfassung
Dieser Studie liegt eine breit angelegte Umfrage zugrunde, an der sich die Mehrheit der
Aktienfondsmanager aus nahezu allen Investmentgesellschaften mit Sitz in Deutschland
beteiligten. Die Fondsmanager sind zu ihren grundlegenden Ansichten sowie ihren Praktiken
befragt worden, um auf systematische Weise Investmentprozesse institutioneller Anleger zu
ergründen. In diesem Rahmen wurde auch um Angaben über die Leistungsbewertung der
Fondsmanager seitens ihrer Unternehmungsleitung und über die angewandten
Leistungsanreize gebeten. Aus den gewonnenen Daten über das Investitionsverhalten konnten
drei Hauptgruppen von Anlegern festgestellt werden, die sogenannten Fundamentalisten,
Taktiker und Methodiker. Allen Gruppen gemeinsam ist das vorrangige Ziel,
überdurchschnittliche Anlagerenditen zu erzielen. Dabei dominiert zugleich eindeutig die
Vorstellung, daß Marktpreise auf neue Informationen nur träge reagieren. Ihren eigenen
Angaben zufolge greifen Fondsmanager auch sehr auf solche Informationsquellen zurück, die
letztlich für ihre Anlageentscheidungen bestätigend wirken und auf diese Weise
Ansteckungseffekte wie Befürchtungen und Euphorien übertragen können. Im allgemeinen
besitzen sie außerdem eine ausgeprägte Vorliebe für "Erfolgs"-Aktien und Aktien, denen die
Aufmerksamkeit im Markte gilt. Alle Anlegergruppen erkennen zwar in erster Linie den
Schlüssel für überdurchschnittliche Anlageresultate in der Analyse grundlegender
Wirtschaftsinformationen; allerdings gibt es ebenso Hinweise auf ein Zustandekommen
übertriebener Marktdynamiken. Allein der bloße Eingang von Nachrichten aus dem
Unternehmenssektor oder Revisionen von Analystenschätzungen werden schon durchweg als
ebenso starke Handelsimpulse betrachtet wie die Wahrnehmung grundlegend fehl bewerteter
Aktienkurse selbst. Darüber hinaus zeigt sich, daß sogar die Fundamentalisten - die für eine
den Markt stabilisierende Arbitrage am ehesten in Frage kommen -. in erheblichem Maße
durch begrenzte Zeithorizonte und die Furcht vor Kursschwankungen eingeengt sind. Eine
weitere Analyse ergibt, daß neben dem Anlageschwerpunkt und der grundsätzlichen
Einstellung zur Markteffizienz auch "Agency"-Probleme das Anlageverhalten von
Aktienfondsmanager nennenswert beeinflussen.

Investment Behaviour of German Equity Fund Managers ­
An Exploratory Analysis of Survey Data *
1 Introduction
Critical observers of recent financial developments claim that equity markets are becoming
more unstable. They argue that share prices frequently lose touch with economic funda-
mentals. To the extent that technological progress facilitates equity trading and the flow of
information, so the argument runs, capital movements on the international markets - unbri-
dled since deregulation - tend to jack up prices and drive them down again in an
exaggerated manner. Market uncertainty increases, as does the fragility of financial sys-
tems. Powerful institutional investors are regularly seen as the "culprits" inasmuch as they
are said to huddle together and cheer each other on, driving markets into states of irrational
exuberance, and, then again, to collectively frighten each other into a panic. Be that as it
may, such concerns definitely coincide with the rapid rise of institutional investors to the
rank of dominant players on securities markets. The institutionalisation of asset manage-
ment represents a major trend in Germany as it does in many other OECD countries,
certainly in the last decade, if not longer (Friedman, 1995; Davis, 1997). Stability concerns
such as those expressed above also manifest a new awareness in this country as to the
sharply increased importance of the equity market for the domestic economy.
For investors, stock-market stability remains as interesting a topic as ever since it includes
the issue of share-price efficiency, in the well known meaning established by
Fama (1970) - or, in non-technical terms, the opportunities and pitfalls surrounding the
quest for extraordinary returns. Volatility is important on its own terms to the rational in-
vestor as it effectively worsens expected returns adjusted for the investment risks to be
assumed. The question whether stock market prices are informationally efficient or not has
inspired numerous studies beginning with Kendall's first statistical analysis (1953).
De Bondt and Thaler (1985, 1987) present evidence on the short-term underreaction and
long-term overreaction of market participants to fundamental news, a behavioural pattern
compatible with evidence found in psychological research (Kahneman and Tversky, 1982).
Since the seminal papers by Sharpe (1966) and Jensen (1968), a great deal of performance
studies related to market efficiency but dealing more specifically with equity funds have

tried to determine whether active management is capable of persistently outperforming
markets (Carhart, 1997; Grünbichler and Pleschiutschnig, 1999; Grinblatt and Titman,
1992; Trzcinka and Shukla, 1992; Wermers, 1995; Wittrock 1995). Most of them agree
with Jensen's conclusion that, when risk is adjusted for, no evidence exists that mutual
funds achieve above-average returns.
Inefficiency and volatility of equity prices are important from a central banking standpoint
as well. They could be an indication, or even the cause, of fragility in the financial sector.
In fact, price level or dynamic effects, e.g. a market crash or overvalued share prices, might
harm the entire economy. This is the reason for the widespread consensus that central
banks also have a mandate to maintain financial stability at large.
For a long time, institutional investing played a merely subordinate role in Germany, in
particular, when compared with the UK and US, a chief reason being the pay-as-you-go
based state pension scheme (Nürk, 1998). This, though, appears to be changing. By the end
of 1999, German banks, insurance companies and mutual funds already owned 36% of all
national assets held in equity (including direct corporate investments) - up from 23% at the
beginning of the last decade. During this period, the share which investment fund compa-
nies have in the equity held by all domestic financial institutions rose from a fifth to
roughly 38%. The ongoing intermediation of portfolio equity investments is mainly driven
by two factors: First, private households progressively purchase certificates of share-based
mutual funds instead of direct holdings in the stock markets, and secondly, banks and in-
surance companies themselves increasingly favour portfolio investments in specialised
funds reserved for institutional investors.
Such institutionalisation involves opportunities for enhancing, and risks to, the smooth
functioning of stock markets. In principle, the concentration of assets in the hands of in-
vestment professionals bodes well for an improved, i.e. faster, more comprehensive and
thorough investment process, ranging from more efficient information-gathering and analy-
sis to more consistent decision-making. Professionalism is, in essence, about well-reasoned
decisions. Moreover, mutual funds can be expected to enjoy economies of scale in securi-
ties research and transactions which can be passed on to clients in the form of lower costs.
Taken as a whole, institutionalisation may enhance trading liquidity on stock markets as
much as it enhances the efficiency of equity pricing.
Paradoxically, trading liquidity appears on the risk side of institutionalisation as well. An
excessive clustering of assets could, at least in some market segments, reduce the number
of trading partners, effectively jeopardising market depth. Institutional investors may also
prefer large-cap "blue chips", for instance, or else direct more attention to shares with par-
- 3 -
ticular features (Falkenstein, 1996; Friedman, 1995). As a consequence there could be un-
welcome side-effects on local small-cap companies or high-risk start-ups stuck without
adequate access to equity financing. An additional risk inherent in institutionalisation
would be the higher probability of extreme volatility, volatility increasing as investor be-
haviour becomes more interdependent (Bouchaud and Cont, 2000), e.g. due to index-
tracking or intentional herding. Another point bearing on market efficiency is that practi-
tioners often confirm that their decisions are at times significantly influenced by other
investors. Indeed, there are good theoretical reasons for rational investors to base their be-
haviour on what others do (Devenow and Welch, 1996). This will be discussed in more
detail below. Finally, a major concern is short-termism which institutional investors are
blamed for encouraging. Although one would like to see fund managers act swiftly on rele-
vant new information, ideally one expects them to maintain a long-term view while doing
so. By contrast, so-called "buy-and-hold" strategies are often associated with private in-
vestors. To be fair, it needs to be said that failure to trade for a long period after buying is
not in itself indicative of a long-term view.
Institutional investors have become too important to allow our knowledge to rest on anec-
dotal or partial evidence ­ whatever their merits. That is why I chose to conduct a
comprehensive questionnaire survey based on voluntary and anonymous participation. In
keeping with the notion of the typical investment process as occurring within a level play-
ing field, the study focuses on the "parvenus" in German institutional investing, the
managers of share-based mutual funds. In the summer of 2000, I contacted all the German
mutual funds which invest in equities and asked them to entrust all their equity fund man-
agers with possibilities for personal participation. I solicited fund managers' basic views
and information on their usual evaluation methods, data sources, time horizons, and deci-
sion-making as well as insights into their company's performance-measuring and
compensation incentives. The results of this broad-based survey open new paths for the
analysis of institutional investor behaviour.
The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. In section 2 the use of survey data in
capital market research is explained briefly. Section 3 provides information on survey de-
sign and participation. Many of the results of the survey are discussed in section 4. Some
correlation analyses, presented in section 5, help to probe for a basic consistency in re-
sponse patterns. Section 6 investigates the heterogeneity of response patterns identifying
three core groups of investors, labelled fundamentalists, tacticians and methodologists. Re-
ponses are tested to determine whether certain styles are group-specific or universal in
equity-fund investing. Section 7 takes a closer look at fundamentalists to gauge the poten-
tial for fundamental arbitrage as well as to explore conditions in the working environment
- 4 -
that may influence fund managers to be more fundamentalistic. Section 8 concludes the
paper.
2 The use of survey data in capital market research
In most cases, financial market research relies on observable market quotes and volumes.
This approach makes sense given that such data may be obtained rather easily at compara-
tively low costs for various times, frequencies and securities. However, the preference for
market data does have another, more deeply rooted reason. Economic thinking is charac-
terised by a consequentialistic understanding according to which all data that can be
observed and measured objectively cannot "lie" and thus best reveal underlying behaviour,
in this case, that of investors. There are at least two drawbacks involved in restricting
analysis to market data. First, investors' behaviour may be the result of a multitude of fac-
tors which might not be properly identifiable and isolatable by means of market data alone.
Secondly, we are often interested in the risks of instability stemming from investors' be-
havioural patterns. But we have great difficulty in assessing the soundness of markets
where no instabilities are observable in the market data. Here, survey data can be more
telling. The main advantage of carefully designed questionnaire research is that it system-
atically sheds light on key aspects of institutional investing, otherwise seen as something of
a black box (Davis, 1997). Likewise, there is no need to adhere to the paradigm of the rep-
resentative agent, as it is possible to explore directly the nature and degree of heterogeneity
for this type of investor. Of course, besides the well-known difficulties involved in survey
research such as selectitivity bias (Maddala, 1983), the possibility of participants giving
idealised, distorted responses, or even untrue ones remain a fundamental concern. Such dif-
ficulties and concerns need to be addressed. But they do not argue against the use of
surveys as a valid instrument in capital market research, so long as they are used not to re-
place, but to complement, conventional empirical analysis (Cheung and Chinn, 1999).1
3 Questionnaire design and survey participation
After consulting several senior fund managers, I designed a questionnaire with two main
parts (the complete questionnaire, translated from the German, is reprinted in this paper's
appendix). In the first part, fund managers are asked to discuss their background, experi-
1 Friedman and Savage (1948) draw an analogy between capital market participants and billiard players on
the basis of the fact that the latter are able to play well without understanding the physics of the game.
Such a view can be seen to underlie the sceptical attitude toward surveys in capital market research
(Cheung and Wong, 1999). In applied market research, however, e.g. on consumer behaviour, surveys are
a widely used instrument (Meffert, 1986).
- 5 -
ence and company-related circumstances. All of these questions can be answered objec-
tively, the only exception being the characterisation of the typical equity fund managed. In
the second part, participants are asked to assess the relevance of various behavioural op-
tions that, in reverse sequence, mirror a stylised investment process. The framework for
such a process is illustrated in Figure 9 (in the Appendix). For the questionnaire, the se-
quence has been reversed in order to avoid "channelling" participants' answers, starting
with the monitoring and compensation scheme and ending with basic views and objectives.
All questions are closed ones, a necessity given the length of the questionnaire. Some an-
swer categories are left to be specified by respondents so as not to exclude factors which
had not been considered beforehand. Importantly, participants are given space at the end of
the questionnaire for voluntary comments if they felt something critical had been left
unmentioned.2
At the end of July 2000, I sent out a total of 540 questionnaires to executive directors of 62
German mutual fund companies. They had all been identified as managing equities in
mixed or share-based funds that were either open to the public or for institutional clients or
were available to both types of customer. Also, all companies had been requested to specify
the number of fund managers engaged in equity investing, resulting in a total of 540. In the
absence of any official statistic, this is the best estimate of how many equity fund managers
were working in Germany at that time. Executive directors were asked to forward all ques-
tionnaires received to every equity fund manager in the company. Each equity fund
manager thus had an equal opportunity to participate, with the result that the survey may
be deemed representative. To guarantee anonymity, I proceeded in a "mail-ballot" manner.
Participants were asked to send the questionnaire back under separate, prepaid cover. Inde-
pendently of that, they were able to confirm their participation by returning a prepaid
postcard with their addresses and company names. 89% of participants opted to do so.
Hence in most cases I know who participated and where they work but I cannot associate
questionnaires with any of them.
By the beginning of September 2000 I had received 278 completed questionnaires from 60
different companies, or 52% of all questionnaires sent out, from 97% of all mutual fund
companies contacted. Only three questionnaires had to be cast aside because of gross in-
completeness or obvious improprieties and doubts about the sincerity of answers.3 This can
be deemed an excellent result in itself but also when compared with a number of other sur-
2 Only very few participants added further comments, the vast majority of these providing extra information
and some further thoughts. Almost none, however, expressed discomfort about or a failure to understand the
reasons for particular questions.
3 The maximum sampling error, calculated on the basis of these 275 valid questionnaires, is +/- 4%.
- 6 -
veys carried out in recent years among stock market investors or foreign exchange traders
(Shiller and Pound, 1987, 1989; Shiller, 2000; Taylor and Allen, 1992; Menkhoff, 1998;
Cheung and Wong, 2000; Cheung and Chinn, 1999; Freeman and Bartels, 2000). The par-
ticipation rate may even be estimated to lie above 54% as some companies later reported
having initially submitted too high a number of equity fund managers owing to a failure to
separate investing adequately from distributional tasks. Total assets under management by
the survey's respondents amount to some - 400 billion or 70% of all assets held in share-
based and mixed mutual funds. One clear, if unavoidable, disadvantage of the survey set-
up was the need for cooperation on the part of both executive directors and fund managers
(Shiller and Pound, 1989). Indeed, some directors may have felt that a fair number of
filled-out questionnaires from their company would have served perfectly well. Valuable
support was given by the Bundesverband Deutscher Investment-Gesellschaften (Associa-
tion of German Investment Companies) who appealed to its members to participate. This
certainly helps to explain why coverage of German mutual fund companies with equity
business was almost complete.
This type of coverage is very important if problems of selectivity among respondents are to
be ruled out. The survey results show that almost 71% of fund managers make decisions on
their own responsibility, albeit in keeping with the investment strategy prescribed by the
mutual fund company or group; another 14% make joint decisions with their colleagues.
Only 15% typically decide on their own without such a constraint. Here, what is most im-
portant are fair rates of response from a pool which, ideally, would have included all
companies, a condition which appears to have been proximately fulfilled. That selectivity
is not so much of a problem manifests itself in another way as well. Managers were asked
to rank their companies according to size. The corresponding shares of assets managed in
each of the resulting three categories very much resemble those that can be calculated on
the basis of the Bundesbank's capital market statistics (see Table 17 in the Appendix).
4 Survey results
Information on the background, experience and company-related circumstances of equity
fund managers are interesting in themselves, although not falling within the actual scope of
this paper. Some key results are presented in Table 18 and Figures 6 to 8 (in the Appendix).
Most notably, the typical German equity fund manager has, at age 35, spent a bit more than
five years on the job and manages equities valued at some - 850 million. 59% of fund
managers had earned a graduate university degree in economics or business administration,
54% had undergone two to three-years of professional training in banking, most probably
as part of the dual-based German apprenticeship system, and 27% had received the profes-
sional degree of certified financial analyst. The typical fund managing mandate exhibits a
- 7 -
distinct preference for blue chips. Fund managers describe their strategies to be, on aggre-
gate, relatively growth-oriented and their analytical approach to be more bottom-up than
top-down. Index-tracking is seen to play a role. Next, the survey results are discussed in
more detail, starting with managers' basic views and objectives, insofar applicable to the
stylised investment process.
Market efficiency and investment philosophy
Whether fund managers pursue a more-or-less active or passive investment style is likely to
depend on their philosophy. Passive investment strategies such as index-linked or index-
related investments4 imply acceptance of the assumption that markets are largely informa-
tion-efficient. On this assumption, the type of primary value creation which passive funds
offer their investors represents a deliberate adaptation of a profit-risk profile through the
diversification of risk. By contrast, active fund management attempts to achieve above-
average returns, i.e. to "beat the market". Thus the type of primary value creation which
active funds try to offer their investors rests on the deliberate exploitation of suspected
comparative advantages in the access to, and analysis of, information. It is only reasonable
to assume this, if the distortions in market prices are sufficiently large to make the analysis
of information worthwhile.
Whether active fund management can actually be expected to deliver extraordinary returns
is another story altogether. Even so, the fundamental convictions of institutional investors
concerning their own capacity for value creation continue to influence their decisions. The
survey responses underscore the fact that German equity fund managers, in general, actu-
ally perceive their primary role to consist in the pursuit of above-average market-price
increases (see Table 1 below). Value creation through the implementation of diversification
strategies - and implicitly through the replication of indices - evidently plays a significant,
if subordinate, role. Dividends or other strategic considerations such as tax or balance-sheet
advantages tend, as a rule, to be unimportant.
With respect to the nature of markets, virtually all fund managers assume a lack of infor-
mational efficiency, an assumption which is consistent with the objective of identifying the
4 In Germany, owing to legal portfolio share ceilings for individual securities it only became possible to in-
troduce index funds which completely replicate such market indices as the DAX after the Third Financial
Market Promotion Act took effect in September 1998. At the present time, index funds are subject to the
provisions of the statutory ordinance as set down in the Act on Investment Companies. The Federal
Banking Supervisory Authority confirms that as of the end of 2000 permission had so far been granted to
only three specialised funds for the specific replication of market indices, but more than 30 funds are ex-
pected to request such a permission in 2001.

potential for above-average price increases. The view clearly prevails that faulty evalua-
tions will also persist over the longer-term because new trends and developments are not
recognised until they are well under way and new information is not fully reflected in mar-
ket prices at once but, instead, only gradually (see Table 2 below). The notion that short-
term distortions in market price might be introduced through initially inappropriate re-
sponses to new information on the part of investors is treated, for the most part, as a
secondary consideration. Only a select few ascribe a relatively high degree of efficiency to
the equity market in the sense that shares, on the whole, are thought to be fairly valued.
German fund managers obviously see great potential for an active management approach.

Means of acquiring information
If active fund management presupposes distortions in market prices, a consistent invest-
ment policy requires a corresponding use of resources to analyse the relevant information.
Active fund management may also endeavour, through its own researches, to secure an in-
formational advantage. Thus the strategy adopted in pursuit of information is not chosen
arbitrarily. The survey results make evident where the vast majority of fund managers lo-
cate the key to successful fund management, namely in the consistent analysis of existing
information and, to a slightly lesser extent, in their own active pursuit of information (see
Table 3 below). However, it is difficult to identify a clear favourite between these two op-
tions. The reason for this may be that the active pursuit of information is expensive and

therefore also dependent on the fund manager's institutional environment. I shall be de-
voting more attention to this point later.

Rational investment decisions presuppose that information is an input variable. Evidence
that the potential for epidemic contagion exists among institutional investors may be found
by establishing preferences among information sources. Only three of the possible re-
sponses in the questionnaire may be interpreted as primary information sources, these
being conversations with management and industry experts and the investment group's
economic and company forecasts. All other information sources are second-hand and thus
represent a means of transmitting informational contagion among investors or investor
groups (Shiller and Pound, 1989). They should, by contrast, be regarded to some extent as
accidental and unsystematic. Given the fact that these types of information are prepared in
order to be solicited, they also are, at least in part and from the very outset, the product of
group dynamics. Informational diffusion poses a risk to financial market stability since it
may elicit exaggerated and unbalanced market reactions, which cannot be counteracted, or
only partially, by fundamental arbitrage (Shleifer and Vishny, 1997).

The survey indicates that fund managers consider their own conversations with manage-
ment and with industry experts to be the most important source of information for their
work (see Table 4 above). This finding supports the view that institutional investors would
be capable of exercising a special function in corporate governance. Given the increasing
integration of equity markets worldwide, it is worth noting that an integral part of the in-
vestment strategies pursued by domestic fund managers is apparently local in orientation;
this suggests the existence of specialisation effects.5 Alternatively, the survey results also
indicate that "second-hand" reports, namely from professional colleagues and the media
are, with second- and third-place rankings, of relatively great importance. One reason for
the importance attached to these channels might be that they implicitly provide fund man-
agers, when ranking information, with external confirmation at the same time. Earnings
projections for public limited companies generally play a greater role than do economic
forecasts, a circumstance which is hardly surprising because investment decisions on the
stock market are taken primarily on the basis of bottom-up analyses. Still, it is the "second-
hand" forecasts ­ notably, those by analysts from other investment firms, rather than those
by analysts in the same company ­ which are most consulted. On the whole, observed
portfolio investments by other market players are considered less significant but not ir-
relevant. Thus, in the fund managers' own estimation, a prerequisite for intentionally
aligned investment strategies applies.
Methods of stock analysis
Investment decisions can be considered well-founded only if they are taken on the basis of
relevant information. If active portfolio managers proceed with their analysis of stocks in a
consistent manner, they should naturally gravitate towards those methods of analysis which
are in keeping with their basic conception of how the equity market functions, i.e. of how
price-efficient the equity market is. Technical analysis may be regarded as valuable when
applied to markets where there is reason to believe that the adjustments of price to funda-
mental supply and demand factors are relatively inelastic or where overreactions exist. This
method of analysis attempts to identify recurring - and hence predictable - trends in market
prices exclusively on the basis of past prices and trade volumes. By contrast, other analysis
procedures used to select stocks are usually thought to be more rigorous on account of their
underlying economic models. However, they continue to belong, in essence, to the realm of
so-called quantitative methods insofar as they, too, are heavily dependent on past data.
5 Indeed, informational advantages due to corporate headquarter nearness have increasingly been considered
in the literature to explain pronounced home equity biases in institutional portfolios. Likewise, for equity
traders on the German exchange Xetra, Hau (1999) finds evidence in high frequency data that profits are
positively correlated with traders' geographic proximity to assets.
- 12 -
These procedures include not only the construction of efficiently diversified portfolios but
also single- and multi-factor models. Although the latter, when explaining price formation,
have explicit recourse to forecast values by use of fundamental estimates, econometric es-
timates of the model structures themselves are, by the very nature of the case, possible only
on the basis of historical data. By contrast, fundamental analysis is, in its very conception,
completely directed towards the future. This is because an attempt is being made to deter-
mine the intrinsic value of an equity investment by forecasting trends in the determinants,
corporate profits, dividends and interest rates, without first having to arrive at a structural
estimate of the corresponding equation of condition for this intrinsic value.6 However, if
expectations are formed by extrapolation or on the basis of estimated structures, past data
implicitly become relevant as well.7 Users of fundamental analyses are entitled to assume
additional returns only if their evaluation schemes indicate that market prices do not fully
reflect generally accessible, relevant information.

6 In fundamental analysis, the usual valuation formulae such as the price-earnings ratio or the price-cash
flow ratio mostly refer to the expected corporate earnings or operating result for the following fiscal year.
Defined in the above terms, a value-oriented investment approach favours shares with low valuation while
a growth-oriented approach favours stocks with significant potential for earnings growth. This is more of a
practical distinction and indicates, in each case, a basic preference for certain risk categories since the ac-
tual purpose of fundamental analysis is to value all expected future earnings.
7 For company and macroeconomic analyses it is, of course, conceivable that estimates for underlying fac-
tors, upon which intrinsic values are calculated, are themselves based on econometric models. However,
as to the typical work of a fund manager, estimating single or multiple factor models serves to predict
equity returns, not underlying factors themselves.
- 13 -
In practice, portfolio managers tend to employ different evaluation strategies at the same
time; quantitative instruments may be used, for example, to preselect securities out of an
investment universe while individual choices are ultimately made in accordance with the
results of fundamental analysis (Bruns and Meyer-Bullerdiek, 1996). Perhaps fundamental
analyses are especially well-suited to identifying the returns potential over the longer term
whereas quantitative methods find their primary use in the analysis of short-term fluctua-
tions. This would explain why the overwhelming majority of foreign exchange market
players, when questioned by Taylor and Allen (1992), indicated using instruments of tech-
nical analysis in conjunction with fundamental forecast methods. Technical analysis
predominates in the preparation of short-term forecasts; fundamental criteria were more
important for longer-term estimates. The results of the present survey confirm that methods
of technical and fundamental analysis are not applied in a mutually exclusive manner but
differ rather in terms of the time horizon for the forecasts produced (see Table 5 above).
That having been said, fundamental analysis plays the more important role by far in every-
day practice; the choice of a medium-term time horizon of roughly a year suggests that
fund managers concentrate on corporate earnings estimates for the financial year to come.
Pro-cyclical, trend-reinforcing behaviour
Do fund managers tend to act pro-cyclically and, in doing so, accelerate market momentum
or do they act anti-cyclically and thus dampen market fluctuations? Great importance has
been attached to this question in the debate on financial market stability (Jegadeesh and
Titman, 1993; Grinblatt, Titman, and Wermers, 1995). One thesis is that private investors
generally tend to act pro-cyclically and, collectively, may therefore trigger exaggerated
market price movements; by contrast, institutional investors would, through deliberate anti-
cyclical behaviour, exercise a compensatory function which would serve to stabilise the
capital market.8
Some explanations of procyclical behaviour invoke the possibility that investors undertake
revaluations only gradually.9 Momentum strategies, i.e. shifts into those stocks for which

9 Barberis, Shleifer and Vishny (1998) summarise a whole series of more recent empirical studies which
support the hypothesis that full market price adjustments may require a period of up to 12 months and
overreactions a period of between three and five years. Their explanatory scheme incorporates psycho-
logical concepts having to do with conservatism and representative heuristics, which imply quasi-rational
reactions on the part of financial market players. For more on this see also Menkhoff (1995). According to
this theory, the rationality of investors is not only subject to cognitive constraints - as the expected utility
theory in economics has traditionally taught - but is also prey to emotions (e.g. greed and fear) which col-
our their responses. What is meant by conservatism in this case is that human beings, when confronted
- 14 -
positive fundamental news are trickling in, might then bring the notations closer to the
"fundamentally justified" value. Clearly, such considerations bear directly on the phe-
nomenon under study. According to the data supplied by the fund managers, their
investment decisions are strongly influenced by precisely such factors as higher profit ex-
pectations on the part of analysts for a certain public limited company and corporate
announcements which are judged to be positive (see Table 6 below). By contrast, their
strategies take almost no account of dividend expectations: a simple listing of their invest-
ment goals makes it clear that dividends are of no great concern anyway.10

with new information, tend to change their convictions only slowly, thus attaching less weight to informa-
tion on, say, the latest earnings estimate than they do to the sum of the past data known to them. Human
beings, who subscribe to a representative heuristic, tie their experiences to their hypotheses and base their
estimate of the probability of a specific event occurring on a combination of the two. As a result, they may
infer a pattern from a series of coincidences and so, for example, extrapolate from continuous past growth
in a public holding company's earnings.
10 It is not a trivial observation that fund managers deem expected dividends unimportant while placing a
high value on earnings estimates. Certainly, all dividends and payouts eventually have to be financed by a
company's income. For asset pricing, however, dividends may have an information content on their own.
Modigliani and Miller (1959) proposed that earnings themselves might be a quite noisy, imperfect meas-
ure of a company's income potential. Yet dividends might be more correlated with permanent earnings
than with current earnings, and thus could be a better proxy for the earnings potential upon which funda-
mentally oriented investors, with foresight, base their valuation. Recent empirical work by Brief and
Zarowin (1999) supports the view that dividends can have information value for stock prices.
- 15 -
An above-average rise in market price, accompanied by increasing turnover, is generally
regarded as a clear buy signal from a chart-analytical standpoint. By contrast, a notation
that has stabilised at a level markedly lower than its peak values represents an anti-cyclical
buying opportunity since a reversal of the trend is expected on the basis of support levels
hitherto sustained (Pring, 1998). As a rule, fund managers attach significantly less impor-
tance to these two technical buy signals than to fundamental criteria as such, which is not
altogether surprising, given that the fund managers interviewed thought fundamental analy-
sis much more relevant (see Table 5 on page 12).
The response option where fund managers regard a fundamentally low valuation in cross-
market or cross-sectoral comparison as a buy signal is the only option which does not as-
sume some form of momentum. Instead it implicitly depends on the crossing of a certain
minimum threshold. Strictly speaking, only this type of response is likely to be adopted by
investors who are exclusively acting in a fundamental and anti-cyclical style. In point of
fact, this criterion does, on average, have a narrow lead over the others when the fund man-
agers are deciding on stocks.
Further valuation criteria governing stock choices
If institutional investors have other investment preferences than do private investors, the
ongoing intermediation with regard to stock investments will also have a corresponding ef-
fect on relative market prices (Friedman, 1995). Several studies on institutional investment
behaviour, especially by US investment funds, suggest that fund managers make a deliber-
ate effort to meet certain secondary criteria. There is, for example, a well-documented
preference for large, liquid assets (Falkenstein, 1996; Gompers and Metrick, 1998). One
type of criteria relevant to the choice of portfolio holdings includes all stock characteristics
which, in the eyes of the fund manager, influence indirectly the expected profit-risk profile
of a portfolio. Thus high liquidity in securities trading lowers the transaction costs while
derivatives may enable risk transformation and offer, in principle, additional information
on market expectations and uncertainty. Such key stock characteristics probably only begin
to come into their own when the large volumes and the more complex trading and hedging
strategies of institutional investors have been reached. Even so, the fund managers sur-
veyed assigned trading costs, as measured by the bid/offer spread, as well as the availability
of tradable derivatives only a far secondary status (see Table 7 below). Although the
bid/offer spread is regarded as an indirect measure of secondary market liquidity, adverse
trading effects arising from a lack of market depth might perhaps, with even more justifi-
cation, have been subsumed under the criterion of market capitalisation, which is deemed
very relevant.
- 16 -
Moreover, investment decisions may be taken so as to appear comprehensible and reason-
able to other market observers. Fund managers, unlike private investors, have to offer an
immediate justification for their decisions as part of the internal control and evaluation
process; at the same time the law prescribes that they "administer the trust for the joint ac-
counts of the shareholders (i.e. holders of certificates) with the caution of a responsible
business man".11 At all events, institutional investors have particular reason to exercise
caution. More conservative evaluation criteria for choosing stocks are market capitalisation
as proxy for the size and reputation of a public holding company; the frequency of news re-
porting and the availability of independent analysts' valuations as an indicator of the
amount of attention surrounding, and flow of information concerning, a particular stock.
Finally, although past corporate trends and market performance have no predictive value
per se, general market acceptance can be treated as a quality category whenever a choice
has to be made. According to the survey, fund managers typically regard all three criteria as
being of equal and considerable importance.

Methodology of decision-making
When formulating strategies, information is processed for the purpose of reaching deci-
sions. But it is not only of interest to know which information sources and methods of
analysis have been used in the process but also the manner in which the manager actually
arrives at his valuations and acts on them. The choice of a valuation procedure already ap-
pears to commit the decision-maker to a specific selection process since he primarily
processes information that is directly relevant to the decision itself. Nevertheless informa-
tion-processing and the methodology of decision-making are two components within a
process which may, in principle, be distinguished from one another.
This becomes evident in the case of a fund manager confronted with an investment deci-
sion. Fund managers are intensely competitive in responding to markets. They are under
pressure to take investment decisions quickly, even in the face of great uncertainty. Simul-
taneously, they have access to a veritable wealth of potentially relevant information.
Competition at the workplace further increases the pressure to perform. The findings of be-
havioural science indicate that human beings under such working conditions tend to
simplify the decision task in line with their experiences and means.
Indeed, every person has cognitive limits, i.e. a constraint to absorb and process informa-
tion only up to a certain point. Such limits bind utility-maximising rationality, as
conventionally conceived in economics. What is more, the investment-making process in-
cludes quasi-rational motives, which satisfy psychological needs (Menkhoff, 1995). In the
latter case, the paramount need is likely to be the desire to continue being able to decide at
all, followed by the desire to control actions and to minimise cognitive dissonance, for ex-
ample, with regard to previous decisions (Shefrin and Statman, 1985).
This being the case, one means of facilitating decision-making is to rely on proven organ-
isational patterns to structure the surfeit of information (which, in any case, for a fund is
already restricted to the investment universe). Beyond that, the decision-making process
may itself be structured. In this way, prior commitment to a specific form of information
analysis may offer an efficient means of simplifying complex choice processes. As a con-
sequence, valuation procedures need not be devoted exclusively to the purpose of
validating suspected above-average earnings potential; they may also serve to organise new
information into pre-determined patterns and, in doing so, greatly streamline the decision-
making process. Moreover, trading strategies that are based on fixed valuation procedures,
i.e. strictly rule-based investment decisions, are equally well-suited to reduce the psycho-
logical costs associated with complex decisions. Not only are investors most likely subject
to cognitive restraints but they are also presumably prey to emotions such as euphoria and
- 18 -
defeatism, greed and fear. Thus a binding pre-commitment to definite decision-making
procedures may also help to reduce the influence of emotional factors during periods of
great uncertainty.
Consistent with this train of thought, it is, in fact, a major management responsibility in in-
stitutional asset investing to position the decision-making process between a rules-bound
and a purely discretionary policy. Further evidence in support of this view may be found in
the fact that investment consulting firms, which are increasingly being commissioned by
banks and insurance companies to choose suitable asset managers, evidently place great
emphasis on consistent and rigorously implemented investment strategies (Dietz and Leser,
1998). The corresponding advantage ascribed to the rule-based decision procedure, which
in ordinary practice is referred to as structured portfolio management, is that it enables the
establishment of a systematic, comprehensible and relatively emotion-free investment pro-
cess. Here quantitative analyses are mainly used (Marquardt and Sauer, 1999). Possible
drawbacks arising from its reliance on past data, which means that it is inevitably tied to
empirical circumstances, are rated lower accordingly. However, reduced flexibility in deci-
sion-making, or discretionary latitude, incurs a cost of its own. It may result in non-optimal
decisions whenever unexpected factors and structural discontinuities originating in the firm
or in the overall economy intervene.

The survey results show that almost one-half of the fund managers reserve for themselves
the greatest possible degree of flexibility when taking an investment decision (see Figure 1
above). They tend to analyse stocks in a manner dependent on the current situation, coming
to a general judgement only after a personal appraisal. Almost one-third of the managers
surveyed made such discretionary judgements, albeit only after systematic analysis. Ac-
cording to the data collected, only slightly more than one-fifth of the fund managers engage
in systematic analysis and then apply a fixed decision rule.
Hedging and risk management strategies
Further investment decision rules may be inferred from strategies designed to limit market
risks. Only funds which gear their investment strategies consistently to changes in the indi-
ces can be said to have no conscious interest in shifting market price risks. This does not
apply, however, to passive investors in general. Their task might precisely consist in
achieving a certain risk-profit profile through the adoption of strategic measures. Index op-
tions, for example, are suitable instruments for managing market portfolio risks since they
are usually relatively liquid and ­ on account of the lower volatility of indices ­ relatively
cost-effective (Bruns and Steiner, 1995). By contrast, active fund management attempts to
achieve above-average earnings from stock market investments by intentionally deviating
from the market portfolio.12 In so doing, portfolio managers may be seeking to neutralise
systematic risk in order to profit, independently of the general market trend, from suspected
errors in the valuation of specific stocks. Fund managers typically employ futures contracts
to this end (Bodie, Kane and Marcus, 1996). The survey results indicate that derivatives are
used more for hedging purposes and less as a means of flexibly building or dismantling a
portfolio position. Even so, German equity fund managers do not attach great importance
to hedging strategies based on options and futures in their everyday dealings (see Table 8
below).
Dynamic hedging strategies are intended to limit losses in the portfolio's value in the event
of a general market downturn while simultaneously allowing the portfolio to profit from
market-price changes. The share held in stocks is adjusted in accordance with the trend in
market prices to ensure that the portfolio does not fall below a specific minimum value. If
stock market prices rise, the cost of hedging will drop, it being less likely that the floor will
12 This assumption is justified by the fact that betting against the market, i.e. the attempt to exploit fluctua-
tions affecting the entire market gainfully, entail a very much higher risk since, by definition,
opportunities for diversification are lacking. Institutional investors find it very difficult to time such deci-
sions properly.
- 20 -
be reached. A greater proportion of the funds will then be invested in stocks. Conversely, if
stock market prices fall, larger collateral provisions will be accumulated and the share of
stocks in the portfolio will be correspondingly reduced (Bruns and Steiner, 1995). On ac-
count of the implied pro-cyclical investment behaviour, such dynamic portfolio hedging
strategies have been accused of exerting a destabilising effect on stock market price trends,
especially since the stock market crash of 1987.13 To judge from the data supplied by the
fund managers surveyed, such rules do not play a significant role here to date; instead, fund
managers freely adjust the ratio of stocks to cash in their portfolios, depending on their
reading of the general market situation.
Finally, stop-loss rules are a very simple heuristic for decision-making. They are used to
protect value of individual stocks, where a drop in market price to or below the pre-
determined level leads to the abandonment of the corresponding position. Stop-loss strate-
gies are thus static and path-bound and, as such, compatible with technical stock analyses.
It is not the gathering of new and fundamental information which prompts the decision but
rather the market development itself. Generally speaking, the fund managers surveyed also
considered this rule to be of minor relevance.

Appreciation of risk
One of the criticisms that has been directed against the Capital Asset Pricing Model is re-
lated to the symmetric character of the concept of risk underlying it (Eakins, Stansell and
Below, 1996).14 However, the results of surveys where corporate finance executives were
asked about their appreciation of capital investment risk suggest that the perception of
downwards risk, i.e. the danger of failing to attain certain target variables, is more pro-
nounced (Brocket, Cooper, Kwon and Ruefli, 1997). The assumption that the asymmetric
perception of risk plays a not inconsiderable role in the formulation of investment strate-
gies applies to fund managers. Unlike private investors, they take their decisions as
members of organisations with routine performance controls. Thus one of their investment
aims is not to lag behind other fund managers with comparable investments. However, in-
dices or other comparative criteria do not suffice if the investments shall also guarantee a
certain minimum return.15 Given the statistically abnormal distribution of stock market
returns, which is well-confirmed empirically, it is safe to assume that the perception of risk
when valuing stocks leads, in each case, to their being assigned different rankings.16
Only on one point do the survey results send an unequivocal message: risks arising from
foregone opportunities, conceivable in the light of fears that the distribution of information
in the market is asymmetric, play a subordinate role. As for the rest, the primary risk was
most often perceived by fund managers as being one of underperformance, followed by
price volatility and market price losses. Still, for each of the three types of risk, a majority
of the fund managers did not agree with the ranking most often chosen (see Table 9 below).
14 In modern portfolio theory, the predicted dispersion of returns (standard deviation) from stock market in-
vestments represents a valid measure of their total risk while the estimated contributions of individual
securities to a market portfolio return variance (betas) are a relevant measure of security-specific risks.
15 The fund owner might have instigated this agreement in the expectation that he would be able to redeem
liabilities. This is sometimes a relevant consideration for institutional clients such as banks and insurance
companies.
16 Babak, Pedersen and Satchell (2000) propose as relevant capital market measures for earnings risk the
variance, the semi-variance and the lower partial moment. While the variance construes the entire standard
deviation of the expected return as earnings risk, above-average results are not included in the case of
semi-variance. Semi-variance is thus an asymmetric measure of "downwards risk". The lower partial mo-
ment is defined in the same manner as semi-variance, with the risk-relevant area under consideration
beginning below a fixed parameter.

Institutional aspects of incentives and performance control
Basically, every time the responsible party delegates authority for certain actions ­ in this
case equity investments ­ there is a corresponding need on his part not only to offer his
subordinates incentives conducive to the attainment of the desired goal but, in the end, to
control their actions as well. Depending on how stringent they are, incentive-building and
control measures may be expected to influence investment decisions (Baker, 1998). In the
theoretical literature on capital markets, principal-agent approaches, which show that coor-
dinated group behaviour among institutional investors can be optimal, are based on
remuneration incentives and signal effects relating to excellence in fund management
(Roll, 1992; Brennan, 1993; Maug and Haig, 1995).
Effectively, a mutual fund investment company with a graduated commission business
finds itself in a twofold principal-agent situation. On the one hand the company as such is
agent for the investing client. Rational clients prefer, for their part, fund certificates from
which they expect opportune return-risk ratios. Their interest often centres on funds which
have previously achieved above-average gains in value.17 On the other hand the company
acts as a principal in organising its own internal affairs, designing a remuneration structure
17 An empirical observation from the United States (Sirri and Tufano, 1992): The flow of capital into funds

which is to encourage fund managers to take portfolio decisions aggressive enough to make
above-average returns possible; in so doing, however, fund managers should not incur un-
due risk, i.e. they should not, as a matter of policy, pursue potentially higher returns by
taking greater risks. Thus, from the standpoint of a mutual fund company, effective risk
management leads to a desired, optimal degree of risk within each product segment.18
The portfolio manager's incentive to deliver an above-average performance may be defined
in terms of the expected value of the advantages which accrue to him thereby. These in-
clude increased job security, possibly a bonus and/or other positive prospects (promotion).
By contrast, a performance that is significantly under par would rule out the possibility of
additional income and quite possibly jeopardise the portfolio manager's position and pro-
fessional advancement as well.
A simple reflection based on a model extending over two time-periods will illustrate the ef-
fect which the incentive system may have on investing. On accepting an asset management
assignment, a fund manager receives a basic salary G. He cannot lose this money as long as
he opts for a passive strategy that replicates the index. Only if he pursues an active strategy,
however, can he hope to earn the bonus B ­ and even then only if he tops a previously
agreed benchmark (index). If it is assumed that stock markets are price-efficient in a strong
sense, then the likelihood of this outcome obtaining, p, is exactly ½. Thus the expected
payment flow for an active strategy is G+ ½ B. If the assignment is limited in advance to a
single time-period, a fund manager will always choose the active strategy since G+ ½ B >
G. The reason for the latter is that the portfolio manager incurs no costs for missing his tar-
get, i.e. for underperforming the index. If, however, by mutual agreement, the assignment
will be renewed for a second period only if the goal for the first period has been met, then
the total expected payment flow for both assignment periods will be result by adding
½ (G+ ½ B). Thus the probability is ½ that the fund manager will no longer have the as-
signment in the subsequent period. That being the case, will he once again decide in favour
of an active strategy? That depends entirely on the size of the bonus. In the example cited,
the bonus would have to amount to more than 2/3 of the basic salary. Recursion over a
larger period number t yields [1+p(B/G)]/(1-p)>t as the universally valid condition for ac-
tive investment strategies. The willingness to pursue an active strategy is critically
dependent on two (three, depending on how t is counted) factors, i.e. the bonus in % of the
18 Orphanides (1996) examines risk management and compensation factors indirectly. He interprets the
presence of seasonal effects in the changes in value of US investment funds as a sign that compensation
incentives influence the risk tolerance of professional investors. Chevalier and Ellison (1995) present evi-
dence that mutual fund companies react to implicit incentives given by the relationship between fund
performance and subsequent investment flows by changing risk toward the end of year.
- 24 -
basic salary and the portfolio manager's own judgement as to whether he can surpass a pre-
determined benchmark.
How relevant are these considerations to German equity fund management, as usually
practised? The survey results indicate that, within the investment company, the perform-
ance of fund managers is reviewed every three months on average to ascertain changes in
the value of the investible funds entrusted to them. However, the average value is mis-
leading in that it masks considerable differences (see Figure 10 in the Appendix).
Benchmark indices are clearly the preferred means of identifying individual contributions
to fund performance (see Table 10 below). Risk-adjusted measurements of performance
rarely use formal measures such as Jensen's alpha, or Information-, Sharpe- and Treynor-
ratios. Instead, it is apparently much more common to take comparable funds as a measure.
Absolute fund performance does play a role, albeit a subordinate one. The salaries of al-
most all fund managers include performance-based components, and for the vast majority
of these managers, the performance-based components are in the order of up to 60 % of
their gross basic annual salary, with 30% being the median (see Figure 2 below). Normally
the primary criterion for bonus awards is relative performance (see Table 11 below). But,
notably, a subjective evaluative criterion, namely in-house appraisals by colleagues and su-
periors, is also quite important. On average, criteria which are more closely tied to the
marketing success of the investment company's product, such as corporate profit, influx of
fund monies, customer satisfaction, or the acquisition of new customers (in the specialised
fund business), are used less often as a basis for assessment. Yet, these criteria were the
only ones among all the six-tier Likert-scaled categories in the questionnaire to show a bi-
modal frequency distribution. This means that a comparatively large number of fund
managers considered these criteria to be either irrelevant or significantly relevant. I shall be
returning to this point later.

5 In search of some fundamental consistency among fund managers
The next step of analysis involves the use of bivariate correlations to determine whether
fund managers, as a whole, exhibit some fundamental consistency in investment policies
implemented, objectives chosen and notion of market efficiency assumed. The rationale
behind the search for internal consistencies in the behavioural patterns of fund managers is
twofold. First, the search allows the authenticity of responses to be checked with regard to
their economic plausibility. One major concern with survey data analysis is that respon-
dents might give one answer but do or mean something else entirely. If this were, on
aggregate, the case, then, given the multitude and complex nature of the questions in this
survey, one might expect to detect gross inconsistencies. Second, consistent behaviour on
the part of fund managers appears to be a key to group efficiency and thus to their possibly
stabilising role on the markets. To see this point, one might conceive of a situation in
which fund managers with ample research resources assume efficient stock market prices
and discard presumably superior first-hand-information to track indices or otherwise mimic
market participants. By the same token, managers with scarce resources and second-hand-
information might do just the opposite. This scenario would clearly run counter to the pic-
- 27 -
ture of investment professionals' effectively contributing to the market's information con-
tent.

Certainly, consistency implies that active fund managers noticeably pursue price inefficien-
cies the exploitation of which is, in essence, their task. More passive managers, by contrast,
are expected to consider markets less inefficient. The survey data reveal that such an asso-
ciation does indeed exist (see Table 12 above). As a proxy for the passivity versus activity
of fund management, I use the perceived degree of index tracking, as derived from the de-
scription of the managers' typical fund, and, alternatively, the rating on index replication as
an investment goal. The two measures are themselves highly correlated, which makes
sense. High ratings for the notion of fairly efficient equity market prices accompany a more
passive investment approach, whereas the approach becomes more active the greater the
belief in price inertia. These correlations are all highly significant, albeit not very pro-
nounced, indicating that a straight-line relationship cannot be assumed to hold.
Consistency further implies that fund managers who typically seek to outperform the mar-
ket through their own investigative efforts also rate information obtained first-hand as more
important and, consequently, analyse it in a fundamental manner. The existence of such a
behavioural pattern cannot be rejected on the basis of correlation analysis, even if technical
analysis and portfolio investments of other market participants are taken into account (see
Table 19 in the Appendix).

As information is costly, efficiency implies a positive association between the resources
committed to market and stock analyses and asset management by mutual fund companies
and the portfolio managers' investment approaches. This is consistent with the existence of
several arbitrage equilibria in a stock market where prices are never completely informa-
tionally efficient, with the result that exploitation of the remaining inefficiencies produces
enough profits to just cover the expense involved in discovering them (Grossman and Sti-
glitz, 1980). Do fund managers in large investment companies with ample research
resources then behave consistently, using available informational input in an appropriate
manner? Indeed, the larger the research resources within an investment group are, when
proxied by the number of equity analysts and fund managers, the more relevant fund man-
agers find their groups` own economic forecasts and, in particular, company estimates.
Although the size of mutual fund companies is positively correlated with these research ca-
pacities to a slight degree, these two categories certainly need to be regarded separately. In
Germany, a small subsidiary of a fairly large foreign financial institute may, for example,
have broad access to very proficient capital market research. However, there is a positive
relationship between mutual fund company size on a national scale and the propensity to
interview corporate executives and sector experts, while research resources seem unrelated
to the latter (see Table 13 above). Fund managers working in an investment company with
a rather large share in the local market are not necessarily better informed, but their role
- 29 -
seems to change a bit as they are more likely to inform themselves directly while invoking
some form of discretion under corporate governance. It is for this reason, perhaps, that pas-
sivity in equity investing appears to be negatively correlated with both research resources
and size (see Table 20 in the Appendix). Furthermore, fund managers in companies with
less local market share and less research and investment are less inclined to pursue re-
search-intensive bottom-up investment approaches but rather assemble portfolios according
to top-down criteria, suggesting that fund managers in the aggregate do behave in a quite
consistent manner.
In the next section the focus shifts to response variations among fund managers. I identify
three core groups and summarise the main aspects of their investment behaviour, thus de-
tecting universal versus group-specific factors in equity fund investing.
6 A clustering of investors according to their behavioural patterns
At the two extremes, an exploratory analysis of the survey data would reveal either that all
equity fund managers follow a quite similar investment approach, or that they all behave
very differently. Presumably, however, it should be possible to establish core groupings
among fund managers according to their behavioural patterns. A longstanding concern in
the finance literature on market stability centres on the limits and existence of fundamental
arbitrage (Shleifer and Vishny, 1997). Given their resources and know-how together with
their apparent belief in exploitable market inefficiencies, as evidenced by our survey data,
professional fund managers ought to be more apt than any other market player to help en-
sure that the prices on equity markets remain anchored to values calculated on the basis of
a balanced assessment of fundamental information. For this reason, we are interested in
whether the survey data enables a subgroup to be identified which resembles fundamental
arbitrageurs or, at least, demonstrates a certain potential which would enable them to be
qualified as such. There is also a second rationale behind the search for core groups of fund
managers. Institutional investors are often said to have specific preferences and investment
styles (Badrinath, Gay and Kale, 1989; Falkenstein, 1996). If so, which of them appear to
be universal for professional equity investors and which of them specific to certain sub-
groups?
Given the existence of comprehensive survey data, it is possible to investigate equity in-
vestors' behaviour using market research instruments which are conventionally applied to
other groups of buyers, e.g. households in product markets. Where information on group
membership or on the number and size of groups is unavailable, cluster analysis is the pri-
mary tool for grouping cases on the basis of measured distances - in this case, between
- 30 -
selected response variables. Clusters are formed such that grouped cases are more homoge-
nous relative to one another and more distinct from other groups (Hartung and Elpelt,
1992). Rather than classifying fund managers according to some arbitrarily chosen criteria,
it would seem more appropriate to take advantage of the rich information contained in the
survey data by using cluster analysis to provide a segmentation. However, this analysis
comes at a cost as clustering is exploratory and does not yield a unique solution. Thus, to
avoid misinterpretations, it should be pointed out that clustering, by itself, does not serve to
test hypotheses of a given underlying model.
A two-stage procedure has proven useful for our purposes. First, cluster means are obtained
by applying Ward's method, which begins with a completely partitioned set and groups
cases stepwise to ensure that group variances are kept minimal.19 A best possible number
of clusters can be identified by analysing the sum of mean square errors prior and subse-
quent to each merger of cases. Also, the desired number of clusters shall be restricted to a
very few in order to allow further reasonable analysis. On this basis an appropriate seg-
mentation into three core groups may be deduced from the survey data. Three out of the
275 valid questionnaires were set aside prior to clustering in order to avoid unnecessary in-
homogeneity of clusters. They came from respondents who declared themselves to be
purely passive (index-) fund managers and who could also be consistently recognised as
such. All remaining cases may thus be assumed to correspond, in effect, to managers with
predominantly active mandates.
In a second step, the variable means obtained for each of these three clusters are inputted as
initial cluster centres in a K-means clustering process.20 In the clustering that yielded my
results, convergence was achieved after just four iterations. Robustness of the results is
further supported by mostly high F-ratios calculated from the variances between and within
groups. Obviously, more homogeneous subsets result from clustering the selected vari-
ables. These variables are the responses given to questions regarding the use of information
sources, time horizons, methods of analysis and decision making, buying signals, secon-
dary criteria for stock selection, portfolio management with hedging rules and investment
19 This technique is said to be conservative, i.e. it does not tend towards dilatation or contraction (Backhaus,
Erichson, Plinke and Weiber, 1990) and has been found to partition very well relative to alternative meth-
ods in Monte Carlo simulation studies (Milligan and Cooper, 1985).
20 Hierarchical agglomerations like Ward's method are rigid because cases, once joined, always remain to-
gether. To overcome this disadvantage, one may consider K-means clustering as a partitioning method for
a specified number of clusters. Each case is then grouped into its nearest cluster, nearness being measured
in terms of the squared Euclidean distance to the cluster means. In an iterative process, means are updated
and cases regrouped until no further changes occur in cluster centres.
- 31 -
objectives.21 Since we are interested in identifying groups of fund managers who exhibit
certain behavioural patterns, they may all be deemed relevant cluster variables.
Importantly, the clusters obtained appear not to depend too strongly on the approach taken.
Ward's method, applied by itself with or without casewise standardised variables, and K-
means-clustering with or without initial cluster centres all point to one and the same un-
derlying kind of cluster profile. Nevertheless, the chosen solution seems best because the
three identified clusters are most equidistant. Ultimately, and most importantly, the validity
of any suggested cluster solution depends on whether the results can be interpreted in a
theoretically intelligible manner. This is the case.
Fundamentalists, tacticians and methodologists
The first group is estimated to have 83 members representing about 30% of all equity fund
managers or almost 40% of assets under their management (see Figure 11 in the Appen-
dix). Within the classical typification of investors according to use of analytical methods,
these fund managers distinguish themselves through their supreme emphasis on funda-
mental evaluations. Technical or chartist analyses play only a minor role for them, whereas
forecasting based on econometric or portfolio optimisation models is rated as virtually ir-
relevant (see Table 21 in the Appendix). Further, the vast majority of them exercise
discretion in decision-making, although they are evenly split as to whether, in so doing,
they follow a systematic analytical procedure or one based on the underlying market situa-
tion (see Table 14 below). The second group is the largest with 125 instances, or 46% of all
fund managers (42 % of assets under management). The main difference between it and the
first group is the somewhat lesser reliance on fundamental analysis and the markedly
higher rating for technical analysis. These managers are very likely to be influenced in their
analysis by the market situation and hence appeal to their discretion in making decisions.
The smallest cluster is made up of 64 fund managers, or 23% (17%) of all fund managers
(assets under management). They stand out because only they classify forecasting on the
basis of both econometric and portfolio optimisation models as quite relevant. It should
come as no surprise that a broad majority of them follow clear and standing decision rules
after systematically analysing the market.22 For simplicity, the first group shall henceforth
21 The variables entered are standardised to neutralise effects from different scales. For the Ward's method
response variables are further standardised across cases to ensure that differences in response patterns are
accounted for effectively. Eventually, time horizons other than those for fundamental predictions are
dropped in order to prevent their influence from being inflated through high positive correlations. Also,
six response items have again been omitted to avoid unnecessary inhomogeneity of clusters, after
ANOVA showed them to be too similar across all survey participants.
22 Such practices are often called "quantitative management" or "structured investment" approaches.
- 32 -
be labelled fundamentalists, the second tacticians and the last one methodologists.23 This
represents a simplification because the results clearly show that, in a general sense, behav-
ioural differences among investment fund managers are not so much a matter of choosing
among various options; rather, fund managers differ by degrees, depending on how much
weight they attach to different types of alternatives.

The cluster results also seem relevant as they support the prior finding of a fundamental
consistency with respect to specialisation among fund managers. For example, Table 22
(see Appendix) presents the group means for the appraisal of various possible buy signals.
Unlike both tacticians and methodologists, fundamentalists attribute much less importance
to technical factors such as an above-average increase in share price accompanied by rising
volume or a bottomed-out share price sharply lower than historic values. But they consis-
tently give a top rating to a low fundamental valuation relative to the market or sector, one
that is significantly higher than other groups.
Group means for all behavioural characteristics are listed in Tables 21 to 26 (in the Appen-
dix). As the data are ordinal by nature, the nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis-H-statistic is
calculated along with the ANOVA-F-ratio to test for overall differences in distribution
between clusters. The Levene-statistic serves to test for homogeneity of group variances. If
23 Statistically, fundamentalists differ from methodologists to a slightly greater degree than from tacticians,
the latter two groups being, however, most akin. Further, not only the variance but also the mean of dis-
tances between cases and its cluster centre is greatest for methodologists, indicating that this group is,
independent of its smaller group size, the least homogenous cluster. In this respect, the other two groups
are roughly alike.
- 33 -
these are significantly different, the Games-Howell-procedure is used to test for differences
in mean between groups; otherwise, the Scheffé test is applied. On this basis some behav-
ioural patterns can be identified as group-specific which are apt to induce or exacerbate
procyclical tendencies in the stock market.
Procyclical investment behaviour
Much recent research has focused on establishing a theoretical and empirical basis for ra-
tional herding on the part of investors in financial markets (Devenow and Welch, 1996;
Wermers, 1999). As a matter of fact, the relevant question does not appear to be whether
institutional investors herd but rather, given the fact that they do, to what extent. Herding,
in a general sense, can be conceived of as correlated investment patterns between investors
independent of fundamentals. Equity fund managers do widely, though to varying degrees,
follow indexation in the form of a benchmark, which effectively serves as mechanism for
synchronising investment behaviour. The survey results confirm that indices are relevant
for all types of managers. Still, fundamentalists feel under significantly less pressure to
track an index than do the other two groups (see Figure 3 below). Further, diversification
and index replication are seen as more important investment objectives by tacticians and
methodologists, although the primary goal remains overperformance in all three groups
(see Table 23 in the Appendix). Consequently, fundamentalists turn out to be the most
willing to pursue active strategies.

Conventional empirical investigations using market data have, to date, failed to distinguish
adequately between spurious forms of herding and intentional ones among institutional in-
vestors. Herding clearly leads to correlated trading but the reverse need not be true. Given
the multitude of factors that might affect an investment decision, it may be impossible to
determine the sources of correlated, procyclical investment behaviour, even if such could
be found in the market data (Bikchandani and Sharma, 2000). However, reliable survey
data, conceived as yielding supplementary information, may be of help.

With a view to information-based herding, survey participants have been asked to appraise
observed institutional purchasing activity as a signal to buy (specific) stocks. Such signals
play a much larger role in the investment decisions of methodologists and tacticians ­ and
for the latter more than for the former - than they do for fundamentalists. This is also con-
sistent with the significantly higher rating given to technical buying signals, as indicated
above. On balance, investors in these groups are much more inclined to derive information
from the behaviour of other market participants (see Figure 4 above). Intentional herding
- 35 -
therefore appears to be a group-specific form of behaviour. This, in turn, speaks in favour
of fundamentalists being able to assume a stabilising role in markets.24
Arguments for reputation-based herding among institutional investors have been voiced
alongside arguments for information-based herding. Fund managers may simply prefer to
move with the crowd as they are risk-averse when it comes to "lone" decisions which
might eventually turn out to be bad ones (Scharfstein and Stein, 1990). Procyclical behav-
iour may result from investor preferences for stock criteria which, insofar as they suggest
superior stock quality, implicitly offer some protection for fund managers' own reputation
(Badrinath, Gay and Kale, 1989). In the questionnaire I have therefore asked respondents to
rate the importance of a corporation's past performance as well as that of its stock price as
an additional criterion for portfolio selection. Indeed, the fairly high average scores for all
groups indicate that such considerations are deemed very relevant by fund managers in
general, although tacticians exhibit the most pronounced preference for "winner-type"
shares (see Table 24 in the Appendix).
Investment decision rules and portfolio techniques, such as stop-loss-orders, margin pur-
chases or dynamic hedging, may - unintentionally but effectively - contribute to procyclical
price tendencies (Davis, 1997). Here, tacticians, in line with their greater reliance on tech-
nical factors, are the only ones to assign a role to stop-loss-techniques in their investment
approach. Together with methodologists they attest to the use of options and futures at a
substantial level, albeit primarily for hedging purposes and not for position-taking on mar-
gin. Group differences also exist with regard to dynamic hedging strategies. Such strategies
appear to be adopted by methodologists, albeit only to a minor extent. On balance, these re-
sults suggest that the risk management techniques employed by equity fund managers have
quite a limited potential to induce procyclical tendencies (see Table 25 in the Appendix).
Procyclical tendencies need not be contrary to fundamentals. Rather, they can be triggered
by independent, yet similar, responses to the arrival of new information. A common con-
cern regarding the ongoing institutionalisation of portfolio investment decisions
presupposes an implicit trend towards standardised behavioural patterns or strategies. If
that were the case, price adjustment processes would at least be sped up, manifesting them-
selves in an increase in short-term volatility. These processes may move prices towards,
24
Positive feedback strategies, which represent procyclical trading based on price signals, may be regarded
as optimal by participants, provided they assume that investors better informed on fundamentals move
market prices (Banerjee, 1992; Bikhchandani, Hirshleifer and Welch, 1992; Diamond and Verrechia,
1981). Speculative bubbles are conceivable if uncertainty exists in the market as to the proportion of cor-
rectly informed trading, and investors, as a consequence, are not able to recognise whether trading reflects
new information or herding (Avery and Zemsky, 1998).

rather than away from, equilibrium values (Nofsinger and Sias, 1999). If, however, infor-
mation arrival as such provides the basis for momentum strategies which come to
supersede a fundamental assessment independent of market dynamics, then worries over
possible overreactions are warranted. Consequently, I have asked fund managers to rate
upbeat fundamental news as a buying signal (see Table 22 in the Appendix). In all three
groups, positive company announcements are rated equally high. An upgrade in analysts'
corporate earning forecasts presents virtually the same picture. Interestingly, only funda-
mentalists have a clear preference for a third category of buy signals which has nothing to
do with the arrival of news as such but which reflects the relative share price level insofar
as it is based on fundamentals. Seen from this angle, tacticians and methodologists appear
to act as much on positive news alone as on its implications for relative pricing.
Informational input and sources of contagion
Do fundamentalists differ from the other groups in relying on relevant information ob-
tained through their own or through their companies' research? The answer is a qualified
yes. Fundamentalists clearly value first-hand information derived from interviews with
company management or sector experts most (see Table 26 in the Appendix). Further, they
regard in-house company analyses and forecasts as quite relevant. Methodologists share
this assessment with fundamentalists but tacticians' ratings drop off significantly. How-
ever, both tacticians and methodologists rate macroeconomic predictions as more
important for their decision-making than fundamentalists. This observation is again con-
sistent with fund managers' descriptions of their typical mandates. Unlike fundamentalists,
managers in both these groups grant a significantly greater role to top-down analyses. Thus,
these types of investors seem more likely to "trade markets", or sectors, and not stocks. In-
deed, it is market-wide and cross-market herding which has increasingly been observed in
recent years and which has been cited as the main cause of concern (Davis, 1997).
It is also interesting to note where fund managers' assessments do not differ. Exchanges of
views with professional colleagues, media coverage and company forecasts by external
analysts are rated equally high and relevant in all three investor groups. This tallies with the
observation that all groups assign the same importance to frequent reports and availability
of independent analysts' forecasts (see Table 24 in the Appendix). Apparently, the possi-
bility to be influenced in an implicit, indirect and hence unintended manner remains quite
pertinent to all fund managers, also to fundamentalists.

7 On the limits of fundamental arbitrage
To summarise, I was able, using cluster analysis, to identify three core groups of investors
in the behavioural survey data, which I dubbed fundamentalists, tacticians and methodolo-
gists. In general, these groups are not completely different from one another but differ, in
part, in their priorities or, in most cases, in the emphasis they place on various behavioural
options. On balance, responses from tacticians and methodologists reveal a more pro-
nounced inclination to follow market dynamics, in particular on non-fundamental grounds.
Judging from the assessed relevance of informational resources and analysis methods, fun-
damentalists seem most apt to assume the role of stabilising arbitrageurs. Such investors
buy when prices are below fundamentals and sell when they are above, seeking and using
all relevant information (Friedman, 1953). However, some styles and preferences, which
are ill-suited to this role, turn out to be common to professional equity management in gen-
eral. These include, most notably, a heavy reliance on sources of information which offer
some type of confirmation and through which the contagions of fear and exuberance might
be transmitted, and a pronounced preference for "winner-type" or "spotlight" stocks.
With regard to the price efficiency of a stock market investor's contribution is often ap-
praised in terms of the method of financial analysis used. This has nothing to do with the
potential merits of one method vis-à-vis another as a source of predictions. For instance,
the greater the number of non-fundamental factors driving equity prices, the more appro-
priate it apparently is to apply technical instruments (Menkhoff, 1998). However, the use of
non-fundamental techniques cannot be expected to result in a systematic correction of mar-
ket mispricings. Moreover, the existence of a substantial number of predominantly
fundamental investors is, in itself, neither a sufficient nor necessary condition for financial
market stability. Rather, such investors must have the freedom to implement strategies ac-
cording to their assessments if they are to exert an influence significant enough to
counteract non-fundamental tendencies. Even so, there are good theoretical reasons for
considering the fundamental arbitrage of mutual fund managers ineffective. Fundamental-
ists may shy away from arbitrage because they perceive a risk of further mispricing due to a
dominance of endogenous market forces triggered by non-fundamentalists, which can be
called "noise trader risk" (Shleifer and Summers, 1990). For this fear to become actual it is
only necessary that professional investors be unable to afford unlimited time horizons. As a
matter of fact, evaluation and compensation schemes may place effective constraints on
fund managers' time horizons. Further, fund managers run the risk of forced liquidations
when clients start to withdraw funds. If fundamentalists try arbitrage and fail to succeed in
due time, voluntary or involuntary liquidations make mispricing in the markets, or financial
crises, even worse.
- 38 -
But, then, what is to be considered "due" time? Fundamentalists face a dilemma. On the
one hand, for them to be active in the markets and undertake arbitrage they must believe in
price inefficiencies. On the other hand, each of them must also believe that price ineffi-
ciencies are arbitraged away in "due" time. The survey results help us to gauge the
potential for fundamental arbitrage. More than 85% of fundamentalists - a share signifi-
cantly greater than in other groups (see Table 27 in the Appendix) - favour the view that
investors dither in recognising new trends and developments and, hence, only gradually
adapt prices to new information sets. Thus, one necessary condition for fundamental arbi-
trage is obviously satisfied.

Also, the analyses of fundamentalists typically have the longest time horizons; for funda-
mental predictions these extend to little over one year (see Table 21 in the Appendix).
Broadly speaking, it seems as if they benchmark equities on the basis of expected company
results up to the end of the following financial year.
25 But when asked how long they
25 Freeman and Bartels (2000) present some recent survey results which, on the whole, point to a special
preference on the part of equity managers for practicable benchmarking tools like ratios of price to earn-
ings, price to book value, and return to equity, in the given order and before all other indicators.
- 39 -
would hold on to a portfolio strategy if the markets turned against them and underperfor-
mance became significant, the average response was just over three months. Less than a
quarter of fundamentalists indicated they would keep it up for half a year, and only less
than  for a year or more (see Figure 5 above). Since internal monitoring and evaluations
may play a pivotal role here, it should be added that a thin majority of fundamentalists are
evaluated once a year at most, the remainder are evaluated more often. As a consequence,
for the bulk of fundamentalists sheer endurance seems enough to weather a storm. But is it
enough for them to get through the winter?

The survey results on sentiment cast more doubt on whether fundamentalists can stand the
tide. All survey participants were asked to rank different scenarios in terms of their poten-
tial for generating particular tension during professional decision making. Almost all fund
managers cited market dynamics, especially when they are on the downside, but even, to a
considerable extent, when they are on the upside, as the most likely source of nervousness.
Fundamentalists were the only ones to have "voted" with a slight majority for economic
and company-related news as the second-ranked source of nervousness (see Table 15
above). On this score there can be little doubt: market movements must be on virtually eve-
ryone's mind, including those who expressly adhere to fundamentals when investing. On
balance, much evidence therefore exists to validate arguments in support of limited arbi-
trage, as suggested by the behavioural finance literature on noise trading (Shleifer, 2000).
Finally, the survey results imply that, as far as financing constraints on arbitrage are con-
cerned, discretion in the maintenance of cash reserves is considered the most important
- 40 -
way to protect the portfolio, regardless of investor type. Nevertheless, tacticians allow
themselves a much higher degree of discretion in this regard than, for instance, fundamen-
talists (see Table 25 in the Appendix). In turn, fundamentalists are relatively more
dependent on the reaction of clients to asset-price variations, and thus have a greater effec-
tive exposure to liquidation risk. One possible reason for this kind of behaviour can be
found in the type of funds managed by fundamentalists, which will be discussed briefly
below.
Which conditions favour fundamentalism?
As efficient fundamental arbitrage is a desirable feature of capital markets from a macro-
economic point of view, special interest attaches to the question of what may influence
investors, in the first place, to behave in a fundamental manner. The survey data on poten-
tially influential factors like compensation and monitoring arrangements have been
presented above, likewise the styles of the typical fund under management as well as the
basic views and beliefs of equity fund managers. Subsequently, I have found that funda-
mental behaviour is most likely to occur in a cluster of 83 fund managers, who I have
consequently been dubbed fundamentalists. In the absence of a completely specified be-
havioural model, it seems appropriate to identify factors that favour the managing of funds
associated with this type of investor using a probit estimation on group membership as a
binary dependent variable. The results of the regression are presented in Table 16 below.26
McFadden's R2, at 0.34, looks promising, indicating a reasonable degree of explanatory
power in the regression. Likewise, analysing the classification of predicted cases reveals a
sensitivity of 64% and a specificity of 91%, with 82% of all cases being correctly classi-
fied. In comparison with constant probabilities, a total gain in predictive power of 15
percentage points is achieved. Methodologically, there is good reason to take the results as
robust.27
26 The variables are the evaluation criteria from Q4.b. (EVALU) and the award criteria from Q4.c. (BONUS)
with bonus size and evaluation frequencies (EVALUTIME) also being included. Further explanatory vari-
ables are criteria, derived from Q3.d., which specify the investment focus and style of the typical fund
managed (STYLE). Fund managers' views on how to achieve an above-average performance (OVERP)
constitute rankings according to which the last category from Q7.b. is redundant and hence is not in-
cluded. Likewise, only the second answer option from Q8.a., the price-inertia-view (EFFIC2), is entered
as the first option corresponds implicitly to the third one in Q7.b.
27 Since the regression includes a good number of cases, a robust estimate of covariances and thus of stan-
dard errors can be obtained using the quasi-maximum likelihood (Huber-White) model. Also, individual
application of the Newton-Raphson, Goldfeld-Quandt and Berndt-Hall-Hall-Hausman algorithms for non-
linear optimisation results in only very minimal, insubstantial changes. Finally, as regards goodness-of-fit,
the Hosmer-Lemeshow test statistics, calculated for both quartiles and quintiles, fails to indicate signifi-
cant misspecification (see Eviews User's Guide, 1997, pp. 415-466).

Annotations: EVALUTIME (time period between fund managers' performance
evaluations) and BONUSSIZE are on a logarithmic basis. EVAL1 to EVAL5
represent the evaluation criteria for fund managers' performance (contribution)
arranged in the same order as in Q4.b. of the questionnaire. The same applies to
the categories BONUS1 to BONUS5 which constitute the criteria for bonus
awards. They have been valued at 0 (irrelevant) if no bonus is awarded at all.
Likewise, STYLE1 to STYLE5 are derived from Q3.d., the first three variables
describing the investment focus, and the other two indicating the importance of
a growth or value investment style, respectively. As for basic attitudes,
OVERP1 to OVERP3 correspond to the first three answer categories in Q7.d.
and EFIC2 to the second category in Q8.a. FUNDAMENT is the dependent
variable with 1 for fundamentalists.
- 42 -
Economically, the results are in accord with basic expectations about fundamental atti-
tudes. A strong price-inertia view of the market makes it more likely that fund managers
will be fundamentalists (EFIC2).28 A fervent belief in the ability to overperform by sub-
jecting already known data and information to in-depth analysis (OVERP2) is an equally
good indicator. Conversely, the stronger the investment focus on blue chips (STLYE1), the
less likely it is that fundamentalism has been embraced. Either fund managers assume blue
chips to be more efficiently priced than other stocks, thus offering fewer opportunities for
fundamental arbitrage. Or they regard the nonfundamental market dynamics of blue chips
as being, at least at times, more pronounced and thus more likely to thwart attempts at suc-
cessful fundamental arbitrage. Indeed, as blue chips effectively make up a large chunk of
the most widely used indices, concerns about nonfundamental dynamics arising from
benchmarking may be particularly warranted.
Bonus size can play a role, as I have argued above, in inducing the active management style
typical of a fundamentalist. Although the sign of the corresponding coefficient (BONUS-
SIZE) is positive, the significance level falls short of the 5% level by a small margin.
However, the greater the dependence of bonuses on marketing aspects like customer satis-
faction or the acquisition of new clients (BONUS4) the less likely fundamental investment
behaviour becomes. Rationally, such marketing-related bonus awards are paid only when
fund management also involves client-relationship tasks. While this is certainly not practi-
cable for funds open to the public, bonuses are more habitual in the specialised fund
business for institutional clients. In fact, when membership in the fundamentalists' group
and the categories of age, professional experience, education, company size and principal
type of fund managed respectively are examined on associations, only the last category
proves to be important.
29 Thus an overproportionate fraction of fundamentalists are en-
gaged in managing funds open to the public, whereas non-fundamentalists are more highly
concentrated in the specialised fund business.
What could account for the difference? Lakonishok, Shleifer and Vishny (1992) postulate
"an extra layer of agency problems" in the U.S. pension fund industry ­ the one most com-
parable to the German specialised fund business ­ that is lacking in the mutual fund
industry, which offers services to private customers. Individuals invest their own wealth.
But corporate treasurers who are in charge of selecting fund services may want to shift re-
sponsibility for the investment outcome to fund managers. It is possible to outsource most
28 Given the ordinal nature and diversity of the data, the only matters that will concern us here are the mean-
ing of the coefficients and the direction of their influence, and not their size as such.
29 Pearson's 2 equals 10.1 at an asymptotic significance level of 0.1%.
- 43 -
of the responsibility by choosing active, mixed funds, thus assigning fund management a
role in the allocation of assets as well. As a matter of fact, 84% of total assets in specialised
German equity-related funds are mixed funds.30 What is more, this tallies with the survey's
finding that non-fundamentalists are leaning more towards top-down approaches in securi-
ties analysis.
It goes without saying that institutional clients can exert a much greater and more direct in-
fluence on fund managers. Investing on behalf of institutional clients is clearly different in
cases that the job no longer involves simply investing monies but also entails promoting in-
flows, advising clients and explaining the investment strategy to them (Perry, 1992). At any
rate, these additional tasks occupy time and resources. Although I do not know whether the
effect thereof on the investment outcome for German funds has ever been examined, I have
found evidence in the survey data that it does, in fact, impact on investment behaviour as
such. Burdened by more responsibility and working under greater pressure, fund managers
obviously shift risk, too. They do so by tracking the market movements themselves more
closely, either by using a benchmark or technical analysis or directly, by copying other
market participants. Their time horizons become shorter and they are less willing to engage
in fundamental arbitrage. I am far from suggesting that this way of investing is worse, or
even wrong. Still, it certainly is more liable to generate non-fundamental dynamics in stock
markets. It is apparent that agency problems, as have been discussed previously in the fi-
nance literature, play into this.
8 Concluding remarks
With the ongoing institutionalisation of portfolio investment, professional managers have
moved to centre stage on equity markets. At the same time, high volatility market phases
seem to have become more frequent, although there is no clear evidence of such higher
volatility over the longer term (Blommestein, 1998). At any rate, the debate over how such
institutions impact on financial market stability is gaining ground, attracting not least the
attention of central banks. Yet, institutional investing is often looked upon as a black box,
and excessive attention has been paid to the analysis of investment outcomes. Under that
approach, however, behavioural styles may remain concealed which are apt to have impli-
cations for market stability. Thus, the primary objective of this paper has been to shed light,
in a systematic manner, on key aspects of institutional investment processes. To this end, I
have conducted a broad-based survey directed towards all German equity fund managers,
30 The corresponding figure for retail mutual funds is a mere 14% (Deutsche Bundesbank, capital market
statitics, July 2000, own calculations).
- 44 -
in which an estimated 54% of fund managers of 97% of the investment companies con-
tacted participated. A careful review of the data, including the examination of subgroups,
reveal associations and patterns that are economically plausible and coherent. Since the
fund managers surveyed were granted anonymity, there is no reason to assume that they did
not respond to the best of their knowledge, offering, to a large extent, their own subjective
assessments as well. Also, there are no indications that selectivity in response has tainted
the survey data obtained. For these reasons, I regard the results as providing a reliable
source of information on equity fund managers' beliefs and practices.
Some key findings with implications for market efficiency and stability may be briefly
summarised as follows: First, fund managers generally identify longer-term price inefficen-
cies on stock markets and pursue predominantly active strategies with the principal aim of
achieving above-average returns for their clients. Second, in analysing investment patterns,
I have identified three core types of managers, which I have dubbed fundamentalists, tacti-
cians and methodologists. With the help of these categories, some investment styles and
approaches can be shown to be group-specific whereas others turn out to be common to all
forms of professional equity investing. For instance, information-based herding, i.e. the
intentional mimicking of other market players, or the practice of following non-
fundamental market signals is more pronounced among tacticians and methodologists.
Third, of all the groups, fundamentalists, in keeping with their name, seem best suited to
assume the role of arbitrageurs, returning equity prices to, and stabilising them at, fair and
sound levels. However, doubts concerning the effectiveness of such fundamental arbitrage,
as voiced in the recent literature on behavioural finance, are reinforced by this survey's
data. For the great majority of fundamentalists, investment time horizons are quite re-
stricted and, in the intervening period, the fear of becoming caught up in a negative market
environment seems to prevail. Fourth, the survey results nevertheless endorse the view that
institutional investors can generally contribute to more efficient stock market pricing.
Managers from all groups demonstrate a clear preference for stock analyses based on un-
derlying economic factors. Fifth, this assertion is corroborated by the priorities fund
managers generally assign to fundamental buy signals. By the same token, the level of
stock valuations, i.e. their intrinsic values, does not appear to be the only criterion which
matters. In addition, fund managers indicated that they commonly react as much to the
market dynamic itself, which is set in motion by the arrival of corporate news or earnings
revisions. Then, if enough fundamental momentum is triggered, stock price overreactions
become possible. Sixth, there are still other practices and preferences which the survey data
show to be common to all forms of professional equity management and which carry some
risk to market stability. In particular, fund managers clearly rely to a great extent on infor-
mation from external analysts, the media, and professional colleagues. While all these
sources involve some type of confirmation, they are also channels for contagions of fear
- 45 -
and exuberance. Likewise, there is evidence that fund managers tend to favour stocks
which receive ample attention from analysts or in the form of reports; they also prefer
stocks with a proven record of outstanding corporate and stock price performances. That
having been said, and provided institutional equity investors' behaviour is taken as the sole
criterion, there is much evidence to indicate that market dynamics can persist well beyond
economically justified equilibrium levels. Finally, the survey results reveal that agency
problems due to the intermediate nature of the equity fund business are likely to have a
bearing on managers' investment behaviour.
