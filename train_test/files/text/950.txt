Older Workers: An Opportunity to Expand the
Long-Term Care/Direct Care Labor Force
Melanie Hwalek, PhD,1 Victoria Straub, MA,1 and
Karen Kosniewski, MBA2
Purpose: This study examined issues related to using
older workers in frontline jobs in long-term care from
employers' and prospective employees' perspec-
tives. Design and Methods: Telephone surveys were
conducted with employers representing 615 nursing
homes and 410 home health agencies, and 1,091
low-income participants aged 40þ in Operation ABLE
employment and training organizations. A total of
696 of these participants were 55 years or older.
Results: Low-income older workers were interested in
paraprofessional careers in long-term care. More were
interested in home health care jobs than working in
nursing homes. Job titles that most interested these
workers were infrequent in nursing homes. Many
workers perceived their health status as sufficient for
frontline work. The majority was interested in career
advancement opportunities and went to senior centers
and places of worship to seek employment. Industry
employers had many positive perceptions of older
direct care workers, but there were real and perceived
deterrents to hiring older workers. The most prominent
deterrents were employers' perceptions that older
workers have higher health care costs and are less
willing to use technology. Implications: Policy makers
should target Title V funds toward training low-income
older workers for long-term care jobs, particularly in
using mechanical devices and long-term care technol-
ogies. Employment and training organizations should
add coursework in long-term care technologies, learn
about legal issues in targeting advertising to low-
income older workers, and educate employers about
ways to reach these prospective employees. Older
workers can use information about employers' percep-
tions when seeking employment.
Key Words: Workforce, Low income, Title V,

U.S. Census data reveal the sobering fact that the
25- to 44-year-old population is not growing suffi-
ciently to replace workers who will soon be retiring.
According to U.S. Census data, the population of
those 45 to 64 years of age grew by 34% from 1990 to
2000. In contrast, the population between 25 and 44
years of age grew by only 2%. Economic projections
indicate that a workforce at least the same size as the
current workforce or larger will be needed over the
next decade (U.S. General Accounting Office, 2001). It
will be critical that older workers remain engaged in
the workforce to help offset the low replacement
number. Employers must rethink their hiring policies
and strategies for recruiting and retaining workers,
as they have to increasingly turn to older Americans
to fill the gap in the labor supply (U.S. General
Accounting Office, 2003).
While the number of older Americans grows, their
economic problems grow as well. In 2000, the mean
income for persons 65 years and older who reported
having an income was $16,088 (U.S. Census Bureau,
2000). For the 43 million elders who reported their
incomes in 1999, 34% reported less than $10,000, and
only 23% reported an income of $25,000 or more
(U.S. Census Bureau, 2000). For many adults, staying
employed or returning to employment is increasingly
becoming a necessity rather than a choice.
AARP conducted a national study of 2,518
workers aged 45 to 72 that revealed that 69% of
this workforce intends to work after they retire from
their current jobs (Montenegro, Fisher, & Remez,
2002). The study also revealed a variety of motiva-
tions for working after the age of 45, including to
earn income, to maintain or obtain health care

coverage, to contribute to society, to help people,
and to continue to have a sense of belonging and
community (Montenegro et al., 2002).
At the same time that there is an expanding group
of older workers willing or needing to work, the
need for paraprofessional workers in the long-term
care industry is reaching a crisis level. In a review of
the research on long-term care workers, Harris-
Kojetin, Lipson, Fielding, Kiefer, and Stone (2004)
concluded that there are ``unprecedented vacancies''
(p. 1) among direct care workers in most states.
Employee turnover has long plagued this industry,
but now employee availability is increasingly be-
coming the first concern (Robert Wood Johnson
Foundation and Atlantic Philanthropies, 2003).
There is a clear need to find available and
qualified persons willing to take frontline jobs
offered by nursing homes and home health agencies.
What research has not addressed is whether the older
workforce represents a viable pool of candidates for
these usually low-wage direct care jobs. In fact,
Harris-Kojetin and colleagues' (2004) review noted
that the typical direct care worker is younger than
age 54, the mean age of home care aides declined
between the 1980s and 1990s, and median wages of
home care and nursing home aides are not much
more than minimum wage.
Operation ABLE organizations could be pipelines
for filling direct care jobs in the long-term care
industry if low-income older workers are interested,
able to perform in these jobs, and are placed into the
most appropriate frontline jobs to match their
interests and abilities. Operation ABLEs are employ-
ment and training organizations specializing in the
recruitment, training, and redeployment of older
workers (those aged 40þ) into the workforce. Many
Operation ABLEs began in the 1960s when Title V of
the Older Americans Act was passed. Title V
provides assistance to low-income older workers
interested in being trained in 21st-century workplace
skills. To be eligible to receive training and
employment-related support under Title V, an in-
dividual must be aged 55þ and have an income no
more than 125% of the poverty guidelines established
by the Office of Management and Budget (``Public
Law 106-501, 2000''). Thus, many Operation ABLE
job seekers are low-income older people actively
seeking to be retrained and redeployed into the
workforce. Given this participant pool, Operation
ABLEs were a logical context for studying the
alignment of low-income older workers' employment
needs with the needs and requirements of lower
paying jobs in the long-term care industry. Although
Operation ABLE participants may be just the right
workforce to fill some of the need for long-term care
workers, little, if any, research has examined the
interest of this population in this type of work.
Recent research has addressed employers' percep-
tions of older workers. Although some research found
generally positive attitudes from employers about
their older workforce (e.g., Munnell, Sass, & Soto,
2006), other studies, such as Barth, McNaught, and
Rizzi (1996), indicated that employers have concerns
about hiring or retaining older workers, including
fears of lost productivity, higher employee health
insurance costs, and greater absenteeism (Barth et al.,
1996). These concerns may be even greater among
long-term care employers because frontline work is
physically demanding. We found no published studies
specifically on long-term care employers' interest in
hiring older workers for direct care work.
This study aimed to develop a deeper understand-
ing of the needs, wants, and concerns of low-income
older workers regarding their choices about working
within the context of long-term care. It also looked
at the perceptions that long-term care employers
have about older workers. This study contributes
significantly not only to recruitment strategies and
workforce designs to attract and retain low-income
older workers, but also to policy and program
development that affects training and subsidized
employment dollars.
Study Questions
The data presented here are part of a larger study
of the perceptions of Operation ABLE participants
and long-term care employers about the use of older
workers in frontline jobs in nursing homes and home
health agencies. The study answered the following
subset of questions, and we present the results here:
1. What aspects of direct care work in long-term
care appeal to low-income older workers and
why?
2. What unique attributes can older workers bring
to long-term care jobs?
3. What recruitment strategies work best in attract-
ing low-income older workers to long-term care?
4. What are the training issues and physical
challenges unique to hiring older workers?
5. What do employment and training providers
need to do to meet the training requirements of
the long-term care industry?
Methods
Study Design
There were multiple components to this study
involving both focus group and survey research
methods. Seven states were included in the study:
California, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Mich-
igan, Nebraska, and Vermont. These states were
selected because the executive directors of Operation
ABLEs in these states had a history of networking
together to address older worker issues, and they
were very interested in jointly contributing to
a national study. Although these seven states were
Vol. 48, Special Issue I, 2008 91
a convenience sample, they represent diversity in
terms of geographic location. The sample included
both urban and rural locations, as well as the
eastern, western, and middle United States.
Preliminary Focus Groups
The study began with nine preliminary focus
group interviews involving long-term care employers
and low-income older workers in three of the study
states: Michigan, Nebraska, and California. Three
focus groups were conducted in each state, one with
each of three study groups: nursing home employers,
home health agency employers, and low-income
older workers participating in Operation ABLE. In
total, 9 employers from nursing homes, 17 employers
from home health agencies, and 40 low-income older
workers engaged in the focus groups. Employer focus
group participants were randomly selected from the
publicly available lists of certified nursing homes and
home health agencies available from the Centers for
Medicare & Medicaid Services. In light of the
distance they would have to travel to get to the focus
groups, only facilities within a 2 hr driving distance
from the focus group site were invited to participate.
The 40 low-income older workers were all aged 40þ
and were recruited by staff of the Operation ABLE
agencies. They represented a convenience sample of
participants who would be eligible to participate in
the large-scale telephone survey (according to the
requirements described in ``Low-Income Older
Worker Survey''). Employers were given an incentive
to participate. Employers were paid different
amounts in different states, between $50 and $125,
based on the distance they would be expected to
travel. Older workers were given $40 for their
participation plus parking expenses if needed. Some
of the employers donated their compensation to
tenant/resident council funds at their agencies.
The purpose of the preliminary focus groups was
to identify issues related to the research questions
that would need to be addressed in the telephone
surveys with workers and employers. Prior to the
focus groups, the research team reviewed several
survey questionnaires and publications related to
frontline workers in long-term care. (Documents
reviewed during the design of the survey instruments
included Bell, 2001; Hams, Herold, Lee, & Worters,
2002; Health Care Association of Michigan, 2000;
Knowledge Systems and Research, n.d.; Livingston,
2001; Mathematica Policy Research, 2003; Medical
Expenditure Panel Survey, 1998; Paraprofessional
Healthcare Institute, 2000, 2002a, 2002b, 2003a,
2003b, 2003c; State of Wyoming, Department of
Health, 2003; Straker & Atchley, 1999.) Information
from this review was presented as background
information during the focus groups. Focus group
participants were then asked to discuss each of the
research questions. Responses from the focus groups
were used to develop closed-ended responses to
similar questions created for the telephone surveys.
Low-Income Older Worker Survey
Workers eligible for the telephone survey were
those aged 40 or older, who were at or below 125% of
the income associated with the federal government's
definition of poverty, who were or had been enrolled
in an Operation ABLE retraining and redeployment
program, and who consented to be interviewed
between March 2004 and May 2005. Staff from
Operation ABLEs invited eligible workers to partic-
ipate in the study. At each Operation ABLE, staff
used a standard set of recruitment materials and
consent forms that had been approved by an
institutional review board for the protection of
human research participants. Interested workers
completed and signed a consent form that was faxed
to SPEC Associates, the research firm responsible for
data collection and analysis. A total of 1,291 workers
consented to be interviewed. The exact percentage of
older workers that these consenting respondents
represented is unknown. Each Operation ABLE had
agreed to target the number of eligible older workers
that they expected to serve during the study period.
(Executives of Operation ABLEs met at the beginning
and end of the study and maintained communication
through e-mail so they could provide input in the
development of procedures and questionnaires [mostly
for the worker survey]. They also contributed their
interpretations of the data.) However, budget cuts
and other factors resulted in some Operation ABLEs
looking to their past participants to meet their quota.
A total of 1,091 interviews were completed.
Of the 1,091 Operation ABLE survey respondents,
696 (64%) were aged 55þ and are the focus of the
analyses reported here. Although the 40þ population
is the official government designation for the class of
workers protected under the Age Discrimination in
Employment Act, the interest of consumer organi-
zations such as AARP is on the 50þ population, and
Title V targets workers aged 55þ. Therefore, the
seven Operation ABLEs believed that the results
would be more informative to policy makers if the
55þ population was the first focus of analysis. Future
analyses will compare the survey responses of those
aged 55þ with those aged 40 to 54 who completed
the survey.
Table 1 shows the demographic characteristics of
the 55þ low-income older workers sampled.
As shown in Table 1, the survey sample was
diverse in terms of gender and ethnicity. Notable is
that 61% of the survey participants reported attain-
ing more than a high school diploma. Only 7% re-
ported not completing either high school or a general
equivalency diploma.
Professional interviewers trained in the use of this
study's particular survey instruments conducted
92 The Gerontologist
interviews over the telephone. Respondents were
paid $25 for participating in the survey. The survey
questionnaire for low-income older workers covered
the following topics:
 Where respondents are likely to go or what they read
when looking for a job;
 If there is a greater likelihood that respondents would
apply for a job if the notice uses phrases such as
retirees welcomed, mature worker, or senior
citizen, or if the job offers various characteristics or
benefits;
 Whether respondents have health insurance coverage
for themselves, including Medicaid or Medicare, and
if the coverage is through their spouse or partner's
job;
 Past experience in regular care of an infant/small
child, or someone physically disabled, mentally
impaired, or seriously ill;
 If respondents rely on public transportation to get to
and from a job;
 Health conditions, such as diabetes, heart problems,
or back problems, that limit the kind of work
respondents can do;
 Respondents' perceptions of their functional abilities,
such as walking a mile, standing for 1 hr, stooping,
reaching, and using their fingers to pick up things;
 Current work status and pay;
 Preferences of work hours and minimum expected
starting pay for a job involving the care of
a physically disabled or mentally impaired person;
 Days of work missed at current or previous job
because of health problems, transportation, caring
for someone who was sick, or lack of child care;
 Interest in several types of caregiving jobs differen-
tiated by type of task (hands on, supervisory,
emotional support) and by job title (direct care
worker, feeding assistant, medication assistant,
activity aide, rehab aide, bathing assistant);
 Work setting preferences (e.g., client's own home,
nursing home, or other institutional setting); and
 Willingness to attend a 75-hr training program to
become certified to work as a direct care worker and
expectation for financial compensation to attend the
training.
Nursing Home Survey
Nursing homes eligible for the survey were all
facilities listed on the Centers for Medicare &
Medicaid Services publicly available list of certified
nursing homes. A total sample of 891 nursing homes
was randomly selected by state. Random numbers
were created and assigned sequentially to each home
on each state's list. The list was then sorted, and the
first 891 nursing homes listed were chosen to be
contacted. Letters were sent to the human resources
managers of the selected facilities explaining the
study and inviting them to participate. Nursing
homes that were listed and chosen for the sample,
but in actuality no longer existed, were replaced with
other nursing homes listed.
Most respondents were administrators or direc-
tors of human resources at their respective agencies.
A total of 615 respondents participated in the survey.
Because some respondents owned several nursing
homes, each was asked to respond with respect to
the one facility that was listed in the invitation letter
that they received.
Table 2 shows how the nursing home employers
described their organizational structure and
workforce.
Nursing homes were diverse in structure, as
47% of the nursing home employers reported that
their organization was part of a chain, 40% reported
that theirs was independently owned and operated,
and 13% reported theirs as being part of a larger
system of health care services. The majority (57%)
reported their organization as being for profit.
Virtually all of the nursing homes (99%) employed
direct care workers on an hourly basis. Very few
had salaried (5%) or contractual (6%) direct care
workers. Finally, 19% of the nursing home employ-
ers said that their direct care workers were
represented by a union.
Nursing home employers were not asked about
the certification of their direct care workers because
in all of the sampled states, direct care workers in
nursing homes were required to be certified. This
means that they have completed at least 75 hours of
training and have passed a certification test mandated
by the state.
The same trained professional interviewers who
conducted the interviews with other study samples
conducted telephone interviews with nursing home
employers. The survey questionnaire covered the
following topics:
 Description of the agency (profit status, organiza-
tional structure);
 Description of the agency's direct care workforce
(total, number 55 or older, tenure of older workers);
 How often and where direct care workers are
recruited;
 Agency's targeting of recruitment toward workers
aged 55þ and the success of these efforts;

 Agency's consideration of creating or using advertis-
ing that explicitly uses terms such as retirees, senior
citizens, or mature workers;
 Health insurance, financial benefits, other fringes,
work structure, and management practices related to
direct care workers at the agency; willingness to
improve any of these in order to retain direct care
workers;
 Experiences with mentor programs at the agency;
 Agency's differentially assigning clients based on
physical strength or other characteristics of the direct
care worker;
 Perceptions of direct care workers who are aged 55þ
compared with younger workers in terms of personal
characteristics, work on the job, relationships with
others, cost to the organization, reliability, ease of
hiring, and turnover;
 Union representation for direct care workers;
 Hourly starting pay for a full-time, certified/non-
certified direct care worker;
 Frontline job positions at the agency other than nurse's
aide (e.g., feeding assistant, rehab aide, activity aide);
 Perceptions of training issues, training quality, and/
or physical challenges unique to direct care workers
who are aged 55þ; and
 Experiences with receipt of public money to support
recruiting, training, or retaining of direct care workers.
The questions asking employers to compare older
and younger workers did not specify ``low-income''
older worker. This was because employers were
asked, specifically, to compare older and younger
direct care workers. Because direct care work is
typically a lower paying position, the research team
felt it would unnecessarily complicate the interview
to ask employers to focus only on the low-income
direct care workforce that was 55 years or older.
Home Health Agency Survey
Home health agencies eligible for the survey were
all organizations on the Centers for Medicare &
Medicaid Services publicly available list of certified
home health agencies. The sample of 642 home health
agencies was randomly selected using the same
strategy as for the nursing home sampling described
in the previous section. Letters were sent to the
human resources managers of the selected agencies
explaining the study and inviting them to participate.
A total of 410 respondents participated in the survey.
Typically they were the owners or directors of human
resources at their respective agencies.
As shown in Table 2, few (8%) of the home health
agency employers described their organizations as
being part of a chain. Agencies were almost equally
divided between being independently owned and
operated (43%) and being a part of a larger system of
health care services (45%). More were nonprofit
(53%) than for profit (40%).
Because certification of home health agency direct
care workers is not mandatory, these survey respon-
dents were asked about the certification of their
frontline workforce.A total of 81% of the respondents
reported that their direct care workforce consisted
predominantly of certified workers (see Table 2).
The survey questionnaire for the home health
agencies was essentially the same as the question-
naire used to interview nursing home employers.
However, the research team realized during the pilot
testing of the questionnaire that many home health
agencies employ both certified and noncertified
direct care workers. Because there could be differ-
ences between certified and noncertified direct care
workers in terms of wage scales and other character-
istics, it was important to be clear about which type
of worker the employer should be referring to as they
answered the survey questions. So as not to over-
complicate the interview by asking the same ques-
tions twice (once in relation to certified workers
and again in relation to noncertified workers), the
research team decided to ask home health agencies
how many certified and noncertified direct care
workers they employed. The interviewer was in-
structed to ask the survey questions relative to the
predominant type of direct care worker employed by
the home health agency. If the number of certified

and noncertified direct care workers was equal, the
interviewer was instructed to ask the questions
relative to noncertified workers. This was to ensure
that there would be enough home health agencies in
the noncertified group to compare wage rates
between certified and noncertified direct care work-
ers. Certain questions (e.g., about certification
training) were asked specifically about certified direct
care workers regardless of the predominance of these
workers at the agency.
Table 3 shows the number of survey respondents
from each group from each state. The variation in the
number of nursing homes and home health agencies
from each state largely reflected the populations of
nursing homes and home health agencies in each
state. The variation in the number of low-income
older workers from each state resulted from a number
of factors. Some Operation ABLEs were more
rigorous than others in recruiting potential study
participants. Additionally, some Operation ABLEs
had more funding for their low-income older worker
training programs and therefore had more potential
study participants than others.
Interpretive Focus Groups
After completion of the surveys, focus group
interviews were conducted with a sample of low-
income older workers who participated in Operation
ABLE and with employers from nursing homes and
home health agencies in Vermont, Illinois, Massa-
chusetts, and Maryland. One focus group with each
respondent type was conducted in each state. The
sampling frames for the focus groups with nursing
home and home health agency employers were
employers located within approximately 100 miles
from the focus group sites who responded to the
telephone surveys. Eligible telephone survey re-
spondents were sent letters inviting them to partic-
ipate in the focus groups. Those employers who
attended the focus groups from these agencies were
not necessarily the same individuals who completed
the telephone surveys.
Because the Operation ABLE staff were to recruit
workersforthefocusgroups,andthetelephonesurveys
were confidential (i.e., staff could not be told who did
or did not respond), the sampling frame for the focus
groups with low-income older workers was current
Operation ABLE clients aged 40 to 70 who had an
income within 125% of the federal guidelines defining
poverty level, who could speak and understand
English, and who represented, to the extent possible,
as diverse a group as possible in ethnicity, physical
ability, and gender. Each Operation ABLE was asked
to recruit no more than 12 low-income older workers
for the focus groups. The research team prepared
a recruitment script approved by an institutional
review board and gave it to Operation ABLE staff.
As with the preliminary focus groups, both
employer and older worker participants were given
financial compensation for their participation. Em-
ployers were paid between $100 and $150, depending
on the distance they had to travel. Workers were
paid $40 as well as parking expenses if needed.
In total, there were 12 employers of nursing
homes, 12 employers of home health agencies, and
48 Operation ABLE participants in the focus groups.
The purpose of the focus groups was to obtain
insights about the interpretation of the survey results.
Participants were shown charts and graphs of the key
study findings. Operation ABLE participants were
asked to discuss what the older worker survey results
told them about (a) how to find a job, (b) where or
how to get themselves trained for this job, and (c)
what agencies need to do to keep them happy in the
job. These three questions were posted on large paper
to be easily viewed by the group members.
During the focus groups with employers of
nursing homes and home health agencies, partic-
ipants were shown the results from their respective
surveys and asked to discuss the results in response
to four key questions: (a) Should (nursing homes/
home health agencies) recruit mature workers as
direct care workers? (If yes, why? What is the best
way to recruit mature workers?) (b) What is the best
way to train mature workers as direct care workers?
(c) What could (nursing homes/home health agen-
cies) do to retain mature workers in direct care
positions? (d) Should public money be spent on
recruiting, training, or retaining mature workers for

Data Analysis
For all three telephone surveys, descriptive statis-
tics were the predominant analyses used. When
comparisons were made between nursing homes
and home health agencies, ``meaningfulness'' was
the criteria used to identify major differences, rather
than inferential statistics. The research team decided
that a difference between groups of 10% or greater
would constitute a meaningful difference. Differences
that were 10% or greater were also tested using chi-
square and t tests and did, in fact, achieve statistical
significance. The reason for the focus on meaning-
fulness is that, given the large sample sizes in each
group, even small differences of a few percentage
points would likely be statistically significant. The
research team believed that it was more important to
set a concrete standard for representing differences
that were meaningful to the reader rather than to
beset the study with numerous reports of statistical
significance.
Results
Eight key findings were supported by the data and
are organized here according to the study questions.
What Aspects of Direct Care Work in
Long-Term Care Appeal to Low-Income
Older Workers and Why?
Finding 1: Older Workers Are Interested in
Paraprofessional Health Careers.--In all, 43% of
the low-income older workers expressed an interest
in direct care work. A total of 60% indicated that
they would like to work 30 hours or more per week,
and 55% said that they would attend a 75-hr
certification training to become a direct care worker.
More (69%) said they would like to work in
someone's own home as compared a nursing home
or other institutional setting (57%). Particularly
interesting is the finding that 86% of these low-
income older workers reported an interest in career
advancement opportunities.
Finding 2: Frontline Jobs in Home Health
Agencies Are More Appealing to Older Workers
Than Are Direct Care Jobs in Nursing Homes.--As
mentioned earlier, the majority of older workers
reported that they were interested in working in
someone's own home (69%). A lesser number
reported an interest in working in a nursing home
or other institution (57%). When respondents were
asked about specific job tasks, most popular jobs
were those more likely to be found in home health
agencies. For example, 76% of older workers said
they were interested in supervisory tasks such as
teaching someone how to dress themselves, guiding
someone to walk somewhere, or reminding someone
to take medication. The majority (69%) also said
they were interested in emotional support tasks, such
as sitting by someone's side, calming down an upset
patient, or giving someone a hug or touch for
support. Notably fewer workers (28%) said that they
were interested in hands-on tasks, such as bathing,
dressing, helping someone eat, clipping toenails, or
transferring someone from a bed to a wheelchair.
Home health agencies were more likely than
nursing homes to match worker interests and
abilities with clients. In the employer surveys, 48%
of home health agencies compared with 19% of
nursing homes reported differentially assigning
clients to workers based on the physical strength of
employees. Similarly, 50% of home health agencies
compared with 25% of nursing homes reported
differentially assigning clients to workers based on
other characteristics of the workers.
When asked about their 55þ certified nursing aide
(CNA) workforce, nursing home employers re-
ported, on average, that 18% of their certified
workers were aged 55þ. This compared with an
average 55þ population of 27% among the home
health agency employers.
A comment from a home health agency employer
corroborated the survey data suggesting that home
health agency settings are more amenable to older
workers than nursing homes. This person remarked,
``I get a lot of people coming from the nursing home
saying that they just can't do it anymore. The lifting,
that it's too demanding, and they go into home care
because it's less demanding.''
Finding 3: Frontline Jobs in Nursing Homes That
Interest Older Workers Are Infrequent Job Positions
in Nursing Homes.--Low-income older workers
tended to be more interested in the job positions of
activity aide, medication assistant, or rehab aide
than in the position of direct care worker. Survey
results revealed that 74% of low-income older
workers reported that they would be interested in
a job as an activity aide, described in the question-
naire as someone who plays games, does crafts with
people, and helps the activity director prepare and
conduct special events. Similarly, 67% reported that
they would be interested in a job as a medication
assistant, described as someone who helps people
only with their medicine, giving it to them or helping
them take it. Also, 58% of workers reported that
they would be interested in a job as a rehab aide,
described as someone who helps people only with
physical therapy, such as practicing walking or
exercising. Moreover, 52% reported that they would
be interested in a job as a feeding assistant, described
as someone who works in a nursing home or other
96 The Gerontologist
institutional setting only helping people to eat or
feeding people who are unable to feed themselves. In
contrast, only 27% of workers reported that they
would be interested in a job as a bathing assistant,
described as someone who helps people only with
bathing when they cannot bathe themselves.
According to the nursing home employers, very
few nursing homes had job positions of medication
assistant (26%), bathing assistant (14%), or feeding
assistant (8%). Although the majority of nursing
homes had job positions for activity aide (81%) and
rehab aide (63%), according to employers in the
interpretive focus groups, typically there are only
one or a few of those positions in a nursing home.
One employer explained, ``[The job] is at the nursing
home, but there's maybe only like one person that's
a paid position.''
Employers in focus groups also reported that these
job positions are often given as perks to frontline
workers who have seniority.
What Unique Attributes Can Older Workers
Bring to Long-Term Care Jobs?
Finding 4: Nursing Homes and Home Health
Agencies Have Very Positive Perceptions of Older
Workers.--Except for their perceived willingness to
use new technology, the majority of employers
reported positive differences between their direct
care workers who are aged 55þ and younger
workers. Figure 1 shows the list of characteristics
that 50% or more of the employers reported workers
aged 55þ are more likely to have, in comparison
with younger workers. As Figure 1 shows, with
regard to work behaviors, employers reported their
55þ workers to be more loyal, independent, knowl-
edgeable, motivated, and more likely to act as team
players and be independent problem solvers. With
regard to clients, employers reported their 55þ
workers to be more understanding and patient,
have greater desire to care for the sick and disabled,
and be better able to communicate and gain the trust
of clients.
Similarly, most of the characteristics that employ-
ers reported their 55þ workers are less likely to have
reflect positively on their older workforce. As shown
in Figure 2, 50% or more of employers reported that
their 55þ workers were less likely than younger
workers to leave within 10 days of training, leave
within 90 days of hire, have background check
problems, have caregiving responsibilities that in-
terfere with work, be absent from work, or leave to
take a job with higher pay or benefits. The only
negative characteristic that employers perceived
more often in their 55þ workers is that older
workers are less likely to be willing to use technol-
ogy, such as computers or palm pilots.

What Recruitment Strategies Work Best in
Attracting Low-Income Older Workers to
Long-Term Care?
Finding 5: Employers Wanting to Hire Older
Workers Should Consider New Avenues for
Recruiting.--Both employers and workers were
read a list of 29 places where they might recruit or
look for a job. Figure 3 shows the top two places
where employers recruit and low-income workers
look for jobs (newspapers and friends of employees).
Figure 3 also reveals the largest differences between
where employers recruit and where low-income
older workers find jobs. Only 8% of nursing home
employers and only 14% of home health agency
employers reported that they were likely to recruit at
senior centers. However, 80% of the low-income
older workers reported being likely to look for jobs
at senior centers. Similarly, only 16% of nursing
home employers and 23% of home health agency
employers reported being likely to recruit in bulletins
from churches, synagogues, mosques, or other places
of worship. In contrast, 66% of low-income older
workers said they were likely to look for employ-
ment at these places of worship.
What Are the Training Issues and Physical
Challenges Unique to Hiring Older Workers?
Finding 6: There Are Real and Perceived
Deterrents to Hiring Older Workers.--The deter-
rents to hiring older workers that emerged from both
the survey and interpretive focus groups were the
following: (a) perceptions that health care costs
would increase, (b) perceptions that age discrimina-
tion laws restrict targeted recruiting, (c) low-income
workers' reliance on public transportation, (d)
workers' worries about the availability or cost of
CNA certification training, (e) employers' perceptions
of technological illiteracy among older workers, and
(f) workers' relatively high wage expectations.
Although 70% of nursing home employers and
74% of home health agency employers said that they
are willing to use terms such as older worker and
senior citizen in advertising for older workers, only
3% of nursing home employers and only 6% of
home health agency employers targeted recruiting to
55þ workers. When this inconsistency was discussed
during the interpretive focus groups, employers
pointed to health care costs and laws barring age
discrimination.
Regarding health care costs, during the interpre-
tive focus groups some employers commented that
older workers utilize health care to a greater extent
than younger workers. Some reported having
corporate pressure to hire younger workers because
of the increased health insurance costs associated
with hiring older workers. The validity of the claim
of increased health care costs for older workers was
questioned by one nursing home employer, who
commented as follows:
I don't know if you can believe what insurance
companies tell you [regarding] how they are under-
writing.. . . They supposedly say you are community
rated based on the age and sex of your workers.
That is supposedly the only thing they offset for. I
can't believe that in the age of computers . . . they
don't have programs that are writing down all the
claims they have come in on all the workers in the
previous, last year, 2 years. But you know, one of
the detriments I think is more general [other than
age] . . . when you have women of childbearing age.
That is a costly workforce to afford from a health
insurance standpoint, and [women of childbearing
age] makes up a large part of our workforce.
In the low-income older worker survey, 66% of
workers reported having health care coverage,
including Medicare or Medicaid, and typically this
coverage was not through their spouses' jobs. The
survey did not differentiate whether older workers'
coverage was through Medicaid, Medicare, personal
pay, or an employer.
Figure 3. Common places for employers to recruit direct care
workers and for older workers to look for jobs.
98 The Gerontologist
Regarding laws barring age discrimination, em-
ployers in both the surveys and the focus groups
noted that they had been told by their human
resources or legal departments that a phrase such as
older workers welcomed would violate Equal
Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) reg-
ulations. Therefore, although they were willing to
use these terms, their perception was that it would be
illegal to do so.
An objective deterrent to hiring low-income older
workers was their reliance on and the limited
availability of public transportation. In the low-
income older worker survey, 34% of the workers
said that they rely on public transportation. This
compared with only 5% of the 50þ population in
a recent AARP research report (Ritter, Straight, &
Evans, 2002). In a similar vein, a nursing home
administrator lamented during a focus group that
public transportation was the biggest cause for
employee turnover, regardless of age:
Transportation is a huge thing, because at my
center, we are not on a reliable bus transportation
system, we have [name of bus route], and it's not
reliable, because the last bus that leaves our center is
at like around 7:00. A lot of the shifts are 3 to 11,
and then the bus comes like maybe right at 7:00. So,
it's very difficult to retain employees, because the
only means of transportation is either [to] rely on
another aide or someone else or to catch a cab,
and the amount of money it costs them to catch
a cab is not even conducive to what we pay them
an hour. . . . Now, they are contemplating removing
our bus line entirely, so that is going to reduce a lot
more employees.
CNA training requirements was another possible
deterrent to hiring older workers. Regarding CNA
training, 56% of nursing home employers and 78%
of home health agency employers said that all of
their direct care workers were already certified when
they applied for work. As specified earlier, 55% of
older workers indicated a willingness to attend a
75-hr training program to become a CNA. However,
some workers in the focus groups commented that
they were concerned about the costs of training, and
some worried that they could not keep up with
intensive educational coursework. They made com-
ments such as ``I think it's scary for some people to
have to think . . . `Here I am, at my older age, and . . .
I have to get training.' Now that would be scary.''
As indicated previously, in the employer surveys,
59% of nursing home employers and 57% of home
health agency employers believed that older workers
were less likely than younger workers to be willing to
use a computer, palm pilot, or other technological
device to record information. This conformed with
recent research by AARP (2000) that senior-level
human resource executives perceive older workers as
resistant to learning new technologies.
Finally, the average hourly wage for direct care
workers may dissuade older workers from seeking
employment in long-term care. In the older worker
survey, wage expectations for direct care work
averaged $10/hr. This is more than the $8/hr average
wage of personal care aides reported in research by
Wright (2005) and the $6/hr average wage of home
care aides and $7/hr for nursing home aides reported
in Harris-Kojetin and colleagues' (2004) review.
Finding 7: Stereotypes About Physical Capacity
Should Not Dissuade Long-Term Care Employers
From Looking at Older Workers for Frontline
Work.--Employers in the interpretive focus groups
indicated that age is not the major criteria that they
use when assessing the functional abilities of potential
direct care workers. Rather, they look at charac-
teristics regardless of age. For instance, one com-
ment made by a nursing home employer suggested
that obesity can be a barrier for workers of any age:
You see a lot of the older folks that are doing these
jobs . . . are overweight [which] contributes to the
concerns about their day-to-day function. And if we
were to go about employing older workers, especially
for that kind of work . . . I would pay attention to
whether the individual was overweight. . . . If
someone is overweight the demands that are placed
upon them tend to be of a greater concern.
Some employers indicated during the interpretive
focus groups that they do a functional assessment of
potential employees prior to making the hiring
decision. There were variations among focus group
employers in the extent of their functional assess-
ment or whether the assessments were validated.
The majority of workers reported being able to do
all of the physical functions needed in direct care
work (see Figure 4). However, one employer noted
during the interpretive focus group that the survey
data appeared to be liberal estimates of the capacities
of older workers. The ``real'' question was whether
a worker could do these functions for extended
periods of time, day after day.
Employers in the interpretive focus groups also
said that many functional limitations could be
minimized with the appropriate use of mechanical
devices. They noted that training and/or retraining,
as well as enforcing the use of mechanical devices,
are all very important. Although they noted that
mechanical devices are expensive, the cost might be
offset by the savings related to fewer work injuries.
Employers also talked about the importance of
mechanical devices for the safety of the employee.
Comments from nursing home employers in two
different focus groups were illustrative of this:
The mechanical devices that are available for use in
a given facility and the facility's enforcement of [the
Vol. 48, Special Issue I, 2008 99
use of] those . . . if those devices are available, and
the individuals are required or forced to use them
through some reasonable protocols . . . that in itself
should play into the lessening of concerns about
how those individuals create wear and tear in their
bodies, and I think [it] reduces concerns about age
in some respects.
If older workers are to be retained, public policy
might suggest that public money should be spent on
better approaches to ergonomics and other tools
that will let them do their jobs more safely.
What Do Employment and Training Providers
Need to Do to Meet the Training Requirements
of the Long-Term Care Industry?
Finding 8: Employment and Training
Organizations Can Reduce Technological Barriers
to Employing Older Workers in Nursing Homes
and Home Health Agencies.--Survey results in-
dicated that employers believe older workers are less
willing to learn to use new technologies. Survey
results also found that very few employers know
about the technology training provided by Operation
ABLEs or access federal monies available to support
employment training for older workers.
As mentioned previously, the majority of employ-
ers, both from nursing homes (59%) and home
health agencies (57%), said that their 55þ direct care
workers are less willing to use a computer, palm
pilot, or other device to record information. About
one third of the employers, both from nursing homes
(28%) and home health agencies (36%), said that
their 55þdirect care workers are less likely to be able
to learn new technologies. Fewer than half of the
employers, both from nursing homes (46%) and
home health agencies (33%), said that in the past 5
years they recruited direct care workers for perma-
nent employment from employment and training
organizations. Only 10% of nursing home employers
and 13% of home health agency employers were
aware of the Operation ABLEs in their localities.
Only 7% of nursing home employers and 4% of
home health agency employers reported having
received public money in the past 5 years to support
the recruiting, training, or retaining of direct care
workers, regardless of age. When employers did
access money, most often funds came from their
respective state governments (72% of nursing home
employers and 67% of home health agency employ-
ers who received public funds).
Discussion
Low-Income Older Workers Are a Promising
Pool of Potential Frontline Workers
Study results suggest that there is some promise in
looking to low-income older workers to fill the need
for direct care workers in long-term care. As
Montenegro and associates (2002) found in their
AARP national study, this study also discovered that
there is motivation among the older population to
continue working into their older years. These older
workers may be particularly suited for jobs in home
and community care settings where employers match
clients to the needs and interests of workers.
However, many of the low-income older workers
sampled in this study also indicated interest in
institutional work settings.
Study results revealed that low-income older
workers are more interested in supervising someone
doing tasks of daily living and in providing
emotional support to clients, rather than doing
hands-on tasks. They are also interested in more
highly skilled jobs, such as activity aide, medication
assistant, and rehab aide.
A significant number of Operation ABLE partic-
ipants surveyed have post-high-school education and
therefore may be able to perform well in these types
of jobs. Similarly, the vast majority of low-income
older workers surveyed in this study are interested
Figure 4. Percentage of workers aged 55þ reporting no
difficulty.
100 The Gerontologist
in career advancement opportunities. Taken to-
gether, the study results support the idea of targeting
low-income older workers for frontline work in
nursing homes and home health agencies.
Operation ABLEs Provide Essential Services in
Preparing Low-Income Older Workers for
Frontline Work in the Long-Term Care Industry
This study supported findings from the studies of
Munnell and colleagues (2006), Barth and associates
(1996), and AARP (2000) that revealed both positive
and negative perceptions of employers about older
workers. According to the employers surveyed, many
positive attributes make older workers attractive as
employees. The one negative attribute employers
ascribed to older workers was their lack of
willingness to learn new technologies. Yet technol-
ogy training is exactly the area in which Operation
ABLEs excel. These results suggest that Operation
ABLEs can provide a valuable service, specifically for
the long-term care industry, by making desirable
employees even more desirable by reducing their
technological limitations.
Older Workers Bring Many Positive
Characteristics to Long-Term Care Employers
One positive attribute of the low-income older
workers included in this study is their interest in
career advancement opportunities. Nursing homes
and home health agencies that offer career ladders
might use this feature of their workplace to attract
low-income older workers. Harris-Kojetin and
colleagues (2004) also found career ladders to be
beneficial in long-term care, particularly in staff
retention. Advancement in career is very feasible in
the study population, as 61% have education beyond
their high school diplomas. This level of education is
well above that of typical direct care workers as
reported both by Wright (2005) and Yamada (2002).
Both of these studies found fewer than 40% of direct
care workers in nursing homes and home care aides
had completed at least some college.
Another positive attribute of the low-income
workers in this study is that the majority reported
having health care coverage, including Medicare or
Medicaid. This suggests that employers' fears about
having higher health care costs if they hire more
older workers may be unfounded. More information
is needed about insurance regulations related to
higher health care premiums for older workers to
draw further conclusions on this issue. Consider-
ation of how insurance companies use age as a factor
in calculating insurance premiums and the savings
that accrue from smaller turnover and fewer
personal days that employers attribute as character-
istics of older workers would be useful information
to gather, but this was beyond the scope of this
study. It may be that increased insurance premiums
are more than offset by recruitment and training
costs saved when older workers are employed.
Concerns Exist Regarding the Recruitment of
Low-Income Older Workers for Frontline
Work in the Long-Term Care Industry
Study findings suggest that low-income older
workers look for jobs in many of the same places
where long-term care employers advertise. More
noticeable among older workers, as opposed to
employers, is the seeking of job opportunities at
senior centers and places of worship. A wider and
more diverse recruitment net may need to be cast to
find older workers interested in long-term care jobs.
This study found that employers were willing to
advertise specifically for older workers, and older
workers would respond favorably to such adver-
tising. However, very few employers indicated that
they target their recruiting efforts to the 55þ
workforce. Some employers fear that they would be
liable under EEOC laws if they targeted recruitment to
older workers in their advertisements. Increased
targeting of older workers in recruitment efforts
requires further investigation of the conflicting focus
of the EEOC and the Age Discrimination in Employ-
ment Act. Because workers aged 40 and older are
protected by the Age Discrimination in Employment
Act, it is not clear whether advertising specifically
for older workers would violate EEOC regulations.
Given this age discrimination concern of employ-
ers, whether warranted or not, Operation ABLEs
might advise potential employers about ways to be
welcoming to older workers without using exclu-
sionary terms in their recruitment materials. Alter-
natively, if employers post job announcements at
senior citizen centers, there would be no need to use
terms that might violate EEOC regulations. By
simply building relationships with Operation ABLEs
that are funded by Title V, employers could easily
tap into the low-income older population for
potential employees. It may require some effort on
the part of Operation ABLE public relations staff to
educate employers about the existence and mission
of these organizations, as very few of the employers
in this study were aware of their local Operation
ABLEs.
Training Needs to Be Tailored to Adequately
Prepare Older Workers for Long-Term Care
Work and Address Their Particular Needs
In addition to the technology training described
previously, older workers wanting to pursue work in
nursing homes need to complete their state's re-
quired CNA training program. Study results found
that the majority of low-income older workers
Vol. 48, Special Issue I, 2008 101
sampled are willing to complete this intensive
training. Another training issue not necessarily
unique to older workers but relevant to any worker
with physical limitations is the proper use of assistive
devices, such as mechanical lifts.
One advantage of studying the low-income older
workers who participate in Operation ABLE pro-
grams is that this population is self-contained and
easy to access through the network of Operation
ABLEs. These workers may also be easily identifiable
at other employment and training organizations that
have age and/or income eligibility requirements.
Publicly funded workforce programs could capitalize
on this easy-to-access older workforce, coupled with
the technology training provided by Operation
ABLEs, to fill the need for direct care workers.
In order to do technology training, however, one
must identify the specific technology needs of nursing
homes and home health agencies. Operation ABLEs
may need to enhance the technology in their
classrooms to include more portable devices, such
as laptop computers and personal digital assistants,
as well as software commonly used in the long-term
care industry. This would require an investment of
dollars in new technologies and processes. What
needs further investigation is whether these upgrades
in technology, assessment, and training would be
allowable expenditures under the Workforce In-
vestment Act and/or Title V dollars.
Operation ABLEs can help to employ older
workers in long-term care in other ways that also
fit their mission. They can develop or identify
a functional assessment tool based on employer
needs and screen participants for the ability to do
frontline work in nursing homes and home health
agencies. They can partner with health care training
providers to provide low-cost certification training
tailored to the learning styles of older workers. They
can focus job search activities on long-term care jobs
and educate their program participants about the
positive perceptions that employers have about older
workers. Indeed, study results found that most of the
long-term care employers hire older workers who are
already trained rather than providing their own
certification training. Offering a pool of older
workers already trained, not only in direct care
hands-on work but also in leading-edge technologies,
could reduce employers' perceptions that older
workers are less willing to learn new technologies.
The Sample of Low-Income Older Workers in
This Study May Not Be Representative of the
Population
One limitation of this study is that it is unknown
how representative the low-income older workers
who completed the survey are of the broader
community of low-income individuals who are
aged 55 or older. It is still unknown whether other
low-income senior citizens have as high a level of
interest in long-term care jobs as those Operation
ABLE participants included in this study. Operation
ABLEs serve only a fraction of the 55þ population,
and only those who have taken action to become
retrained and redeployed in the workforce. There-
fore, Operation ABLEs are a very small pipeline for
preparing low-income older workers for frontline
work in long-term care. If the study population is
representative of all low-income senior citizens,
a much larger system of recruitment, assessment,
and training could be established in order to realize
the potential of low-income older workers in
meeting the needs for frontline workers. If the study
population is unique in its interest in long-term care
jobs, older workers may not provide as big an
opportunity for shrinking the gap in frontline
workers as this study suggests.
Recommendations for Policy Makers
Study findings point to several ways that policy
makers can increase the use of older workers in
filling the need for frontline workers in long-term
care. One concrete way is to target Title V funds
toward specialized training of older workers for jobs
in long-term care. This study found that most
employers in long-term care hire workers who are
already certified. Low-income older workers' com-
ments during the focus groups indicated that some
fear they cannot afford the costs of the 75-hr
certification training, and some lack confidence in
their ability to complete a rigorous training program.
Title V specialized training funds can be targeted to
increase the pool of direct care workers who are aged
55 and older by paying for the tuition costs of
certification training and the development of certi-
fication programs that are tailored to the learning
styles of older workers and that will build workers'
confidence in learning new skills.
Another way policy makers can help fill the gap in
frontline workers is by targeting federal faith-based
initiative dollars toward recruitment efforts at places
of worship. The majority of workers in this study
said that they would look for job openings in
bulletins at their churches, synagogues, mosques, or
other places of worship. Thus, it seems that this
population of older workers would be of interest to
federal faith-based employment placement initia-
tives. It seems appropriate for faith-based job
training initiatives to focus some effort on educating
long-term care employers about the employment
needs and wants of their low-income older congre-
gation members. It also seems appropriate for faith-
based initiative dollars to be targeted toward
recruitment and training of congregations specifically
for long-term care industry jobs.
Policy makers can develop or strengthen policies
requiring employees to use mechanical devices and to
102 The Gerontologist
be adequately trained in the proper use of these
devices. A clear message from this study is that age
itself is not the main deciding factor in employers'
decisions to hire direct care workers. It is also clear
that mechanical devices can be used both in nursing
homes and in the community to greatly reduce
incidents of workplace injuries and allow older
workers with less physical strength to effectively
perform frontline work. Employers voiced that
although these devices are expensive, the expense
may be offset by the reduction in injury-related costs.
This study did not investigate current policies
requiring the use of mechanical devices, but it seems
that a good use of public money would be to help
employers purchase mechanical devices. Alternatively,
tax incentives could be created to encourage
employers to use such devices. Good policy would
require that employees be trained in the use of these
devices and be required to use them in an appro-
priate and caring manner.
Policy makers can investigate how state workforce
development funds can support direct care worker
initiatives. Results clearly show that very few long-
term care employers have accessed any public money
to recruit, train, or retain direct care workers. When
employers did access public money, most often the
funding came from the state. This study did not
investigate whether the state funds originated from
federal money. In any case, it appears that direct care
worker initiatives may be more successful in
advocating for support locally rather than federally.
Workforce investment boards, for example, might be
one mechanism for obtaining resources to develop
a system to screen for the physical capacity of older
long-term care job candidates and for giving grants
to agencies to cover the cost of certification training.
Much can be done to further the development of
the low-income older workforce in a way that helps
to fill the shortage of frontline workers in long-term
care. This study offers many insights into directions
policy makers, employers, and employment and
training organizations can take to expand the long-
term-direct care labor force using low-income older
workers.
