END-STAGE RENAL DISEASE (ESRD)
in adults with type 2 diabetes
mellitus (DM) represents a
medical problem with world-
wide dimensions.1 Currently, approxi-
mately 40% of all prevalent ESRD cases
and almost half of all new cases in the
United States are attributed to type 2
DM.2 Due to the increasing incidence
of type 2 DM and the increased sur-
vival of these individuals due to im-
proved medical treatment,3 the num-
ber of patients with ESRD is expected
to double over the next decade, with
costs escalating to $28 billion.4
Most of our knowledge concerning
the nature of kidney disease in adults
with type 2 DM is derived from studies
of patients with type 1 DM.5-7 The clas-
sic clinical course of type 1 diabetic
nephropathy (glomerulosclerosis) is de-
scribed as the development of microal-
buminuria, which eventually leads to
macroalbuminuria and then to progres-
sive loss of glomerular filtration rate
(GFR).8 Among adults with type 1 DM
and nephropathy, more than 95% will
have diabetic retinopathy.9
The extent to which renal disease in
adults with type 2 DM is a conse-
quence of classic diabetic glomerulo-
sclerosis remains controversial.10,11
Biopsy series among those with mac-
roalbuminuria (or some other clinical
indication for a biopsy, such as active
urine sediment or a rapidly rising cre-
atinine level) has been a major source
of knowledge concerning the distribu-
tion of renal pathology in persons with
type 2 DM. Autopsy series and clinical
examination of patients presenting for
renal replacement therapy have also
provided valuable information.10 How-
ever, by their nature, these studies may

Context Kidney disease in type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) is more heterogeneous than
in type 1 DM. Reduced glomerular filtration rate (GFR) among individuals with type 2
DM may not always be due to classic diabetic glomerulosclerosis, which is associated
with albuminuria and retinopathy.
Objective To determine the prevalence of chronic renal insufficiency (CRI), defined
as a GFR less than 60 mL/min per 1.73 m2 body surface area (BSA) in the absence of
microalbuminuria or macroalbuminuria and diabetic retinopathy among adults with
type 2 DM.
Design, Setting, and Participants Cross-sectional analysis of adults aged 40 years
or older with type 2 DM in the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Sur-
vey, a probability sample of the total civilian US noninstitutionalized population con-
ducted from 1988-1994.
Main Outcome Measures The GFR per 1.73 m2 BSA, calculated with serum cre-
atinine, urea nitrogen, and serum albumin levels using the Modification of Diet in Re-
nal Disease Study prediction equation; albuminuria, assessed using spot urine albumin/
creatinine ratio; and presence of retinopathy, determined with fundus photography.
Results Overall, 13% (sampled n=171) of adults with type 2 DM (n=1197) had CRI
with a population estimate of 1.1 million. Among these adults with CRI, diabetic reti-
nopathy was noted in 28% (n=58), while the frequencies of microalbuminuria and mac-
roalbuminuria were 45% (n=64) and 19% (n=47), respectively. Retinopathy and albu-
minuria (microalbuminuria or macroalbuminuria) were both absent in 30% (n=51) of
adults with type 2 DM and CRI. The population estimate of adults with type 2 DM and
CRI in the absence of diabetic retinopathy or albuminuria was approximately 0.3 million.
Conclusions A substantial burden of CRI among persons with type 2 DM in the United
States is likely due to renal parenchymal disease other than classic diabetic glomeru-
losclerosis. Approaches to screening renal disease in the type 2 DM population should
incorporate assessment of GFR in addition to monitoring urine albumin excretion and
funduscopic changes to ensure that individuals with type 2 DM and CRI not due to
diabetic glomerulosclerosis will receive appropriate intervention.

Anunbiasedestimateofthelikelihood
ofdiabeticglomerulosclerosis(vsother

renalinsufficiencyamongpatientswith
type 2 DM has important implications.
For example, the current strategies for
screeningandtreatmentofrenaldisease
inpatientswithtype2DMimplicitlyas-
sume the underlying disease process is
uniformlydiabeticglomerulosclerosis.12
While this is true for many individuals,
our clinical experience leads us to hy-
pothesize that a substantial number of
adults with type 2 DM and decreased
GFR may not have diabetic glomerulo-
sclerosis, as inferred from the absence
of albuminuria and retinopathy.
In this study, we used data from a na-
tionally representative sample of the US
population to determine the frequency
of chronic renal insufficiency (CRI), de-
fined as a GFR less than 60 mL/min per
1.73 m2 body surface area (BSA) in the
absence of albuminuria or diabetic reti-
nopathy in adults with type 2 DM.
METHODS
Study Population
The Third National Health and Nutri-
tion Examination Survey (NHANES III)
was designed as a probability sample of
the total US civilian noninstitutional-
ized population 2 months of age or older
and collected healthand nutritionaldata
on 33994 men, women, and children
from 1988-1994. Certain subgroups,
such as young children, older persons,
non-Hispanic blacks, and Mexican
Americans,wereoversampled.Detailsof
the survey design may be found in the
NHANES III operations manual.13
Definition of Type 2 DM
There were 9737 NHANES III adults
who were 40 years of age or older and
completed a standardized interview and
a detailed physical examination. Diabe-
tes was self-reported as being previ-
ously diagnosed by a physician (except
during pregnancy) or as current or past
use of insulin or oral agents. Overall,
1187 reported a previous diagnosis of
DM. The NHANES III did not collect in-
formation on type of DM. Thus, we ex-
cluded7adultswithlikelytype1DM(di-
agnosedwithDMpriorto30yearsofage
or continuous use of insulin), leaving a
total of 1180 adults with previously di-
agnosed type 2 DM.
Adults who completed the examina-
tion in the morning were instructed to
fast for at least 9 hours, while those who
completed the examination in the after-
noon were instructed to fast for at least
4 hours. Among the 8550 adults with-
out previously diagnosed DM, we ex-
cluded 318 (4%) who did not have fast-
ing serum glucose levels measured and
an additional 624 (7%) who did not fast
as instructed. Among individuals who
fasted appropriately and had serum glu-
cose levels measured, 356 were classi-
fied as having type 2 DM according to
the American Diabetes Association
(ADA).14 We repeated the analyses us-
ing the World Health Organization
(WHO) criteria to define newly diag-
nosed type 2 DM. A 75-g oral glucose
challenge test was administered to 5776
(76%) of adults who fasted appropri-
ately and had fasting serum glucose lev-
els measured. Overall, 575 adults with
a fasting glucose level less than 126
mg/dL (6.9 mmol/L) had serum glu-
cose values of at least 200 mg/dL (11.1
mmol/L) 2 hours (±15 minutes) after an
oralglucosechallenge,leaving931adults
classifiedashavingnewlydiagnosedtype
2 DM according to the WHO criteria.15
Definition of Retinopathy
In the NHANES III, photographs of the
ocular fundus of one eye were taken in
all examined adults who were 40 years
ofageorolder,regardlessofdiabetessta-
tus. These photographs were taken with
a nonmydriatic fundus camera (Canon
CR4-45NM, Canon, Kanagawa, Japan),
which incorporated the use of an infra-
red video camera to allow photographs
to be taken in a darkened examination
room without the use of dilating drops.
A nonstereoscopic, color, 45° photo-
graph, centered between the optic nerve
and the macula, was taken of one ran-
domly selected eye, and the fundus im-
ages were then reviewed at the Univer-
sity of Wisconsin­Madison Department
of Ophthalmology.16 The grading sys-
tem for classifying diabetic retinopathy
was based on a modification of the Air-
lieHouseClassificationScheme.17 Adults
with any evidence of current retinopa-
thy (nonproliferative [mild, moderate,
or severe] or proliferative) or previous
treatment for proliferative diabetic reti-
nopathy were classified as having dia-
betic retinopathy. A gradeable photo-
graph of the ocular fundus of one eye
was obtained in 939 (80%) of the adults
with previously diagnosed type 2 DM,
288 (81%) with newly diagnosed type
2 DM using the ADA criteria, and 804
(86%) with newly diagnosed type 2 DM
using the WHO criteria. Adults with-
out gradeable funduscopic examina-
tions were excluded.
Quantification of Albuminuria
Solid-phase fluorescent immunoassay
wasusedtomeasureurinaryalbuminlev-
els,andurinecreatininelevelsweremea-
sured with the Jaffe rate reaction.16 Spot
urine albumin (µg/mL)/creatinine (mg/
mL)ratios(ACR)werecalculatedforall
adults,andthosewithmissingurinedata
were excluded (27 previously diag-
nosed and 3 newly diagnosed using the
ADA criteria, and 8 newly diagnosed
using the WHO criteria). To define
microalbuminuria in random urine
specimens, we used sex-specific ACR
cut points (17 and 25 µg/mg for
men and women, respectively).18,19
Macroalbuminuria was defined as an
ACR of at least 250 µg/mg in men and at
least 355 µg/mg in women. Albumin-
uriawasdefinedasthepresenceofmicro-
albuminuria or macroalbuminuria.18,19
Estimation of GFR
The GFR per 1.73 m2 BSA was calcu-
lated with serum creatinine, urea ni-
trogen, and albumin levels using an
equation developed from the Modifi-
cation of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD)
Study,20 as follows:
GFR=170  [serum creatinine]-0.999 
[age]-0.176  [0.762 if female] 
[1.180 if non-Hispanic black]

We subtracted 0.23 mg/dL from the
measured serum creatinine level to ad-
just for differences in the calibration of
serumcreatininelevelbetweenNHANES
III and the MDRD study.21 We defined
CRI as a GFR less than 60 mL/min per
1.73 m2 BSA. This corresponds to the
newly proposed National Kidney Foun-
dation Kidney Dialysis Outcomes Qual-
ity Initiative guidelines for defining
chronic kidney disease stages 3 to 5.22
Assessment of Covariates
Age was defined as the age at the time
of the interview, and race or ethnicity
were self-reported as non-Hispanic
white, non-Hispanic black, and Mexi-
can American. Other races or ethnici-
ties were grouped into "other." Blood
pressure was determined by the mean
of 6 readings. Body mass index was cal-
culatedfromtheweightandheightmea-
sured during the physical examination.
We also analyzed information regard-
ing use of angiotensin-converting
enzyme (ACE) inhibitors.

2 groups. Among the adults with previ-
ously diagnosed type 2 DM, the mean
reported duration of DM was 9.1 years,
and 25% and 51% reported the use of
insulin and diabetes pills, respectively.
The use of ACE inhibitors was noted in
13%ofthetype2diabeticpopulationand
5% of the nondiabetic population.
The percentage and population es-

or older with CRI are shown in TABLE 2.
Chronic renal insufficiency was noted
in 13% (sampled n=171) of adults with
type 2 DM (population estimate, 1.1
million), which was significantly higher
than the 7% (n=636) prevalence noted
in the nondiabetic population aged 40
years or older (P.001). No substan-
tial change in the prevalence of CRI was
noted after excluding diabetic adults
who were using ACE inhibitors (12%
[n=132]). Compared with adults with
type 2 DM and no CRI, adults with type
2 DM and CRI were more likely to have
macroalbuminuria (19% vs 5%), mi-
croalbuminuria (45% vs 32%), and dia-
betic retinopathy (28% vs 15%).
Amongalladultswithtype2DM(pre-

COMMENT
In this nationally representative sample
of adults with type 2 DM in the United
States, we noted the absence of dia-
betic retinopathy and albuminuria (mi-
croalbuminuria or macroalbuminuria)
in 30% of individuals with a GFR less
than 60 mL/min per 1.73 m2 BSA when
weusedtheADAcriteriatodefinenewly
diagnosed type 2 DM. Use of the WHO
criteria to define newly diagnosed type
2 DM showed similar results.
Currently, almost half of all ESRD in
individuals initiating renal replace-
ment therapy in the United States is at-
tributed to type 2 DM,2 and the num-
ber of individuals with type 2 DM and
ESRD is projected to almost double over
the next 10 years.4 Therefore, im-
proved understanding of the etiology
of CRI among adults with type 2 DM
will be paramount in controlling this
epidemic of kidney failure.
The renal pathology of classic dia-
betic glomerulosclerosis (in both type 1
and 2 adults) is characterized by in-
creased basement membrane thick-
ness, diffuse mesangial sclerosis with
nodular formation, hyalinosis, micro-
aneurysm, and hyaline arteriolosclero-
sis.25 These pathological lesions lead to
albuminuria and are accompanied by
other systemic manifestations of micro-
vascular disease, such as proliferative
retinopathy.8 Among individuals with
type 1 DM, diabetic retinopathy is pre-
sent in virtually all patients with dia-
betic nephropathy.25 However, among
patients with type 2 DM, the concor-
dance rate between diabetic retinopa-
thy and nephropathy is lower.25 Never-
theless, the presence of retinopathy does
support a diagnosis of diabetic ne-
phropathy. Indeed, Parving et al9 stated
that the absence of retinopathy greatly
reduced the likelihood that albumin-
uria was due to diabetic glomeruloscle-
rosis in type 1 or type 2 DM. In the ab-
sence of retinopathy or albuminuria in
30% of adults with a GFR less than 60
mL/min per 1.73 m2 BSA, classic dia-
beticglomerulosclerosisisunlikelytobe
the underlying renal pathology.
What could be the reason for de-
creased GFR in adults with type 2 DM
who do not have retinopathy or albu-
minuria? A number of factors may con-
tribute to nephron loss, including "age-
associated" renal senescence, interstitial
fibrosis, and ischemic vascular dis-
ease, such as atherosclerotic involve-
ment of the renal artery (and smaller-
caliber arteries). Moreover, we agree
with Rychlik et al10 that cholesterol em-
boli are likely an underappreciated con-
tributor to the burden of CRI among pa-
tients with type 2 DM.
Becauseasubstantialnumberofadults
with type 2 DM with reduced GFR do
nothaveretinopathyoralbuminuria,the
current strategy of screening for micro-
albuminuria and retinopathy alone
among type 2 diabetic adults may not be
sufficient for the early detection of re-
nal disease. In addition, the serum cre-
atinine level is an insensitive measure of
GFR loss. The National Kidney Foun-
dation now recommends that physi-
cians should monitor GFR22 using pre-
diction equations such as the MDRD
formula20 or the Cockcroft-Gault for-
mula26 in addition to assessing blood
pressure,funduscopicchanges,andurine
albumin excretion in adults with type 2
DM.12 Thefindingsofthisstudyalsosug-

cations and other atherosclerosis-
targeted therapy and the development
and progression of CRI among patients
with type 2 DM. In addition, clinicians
should be conscious of potential long-
term renal detrimental effects from cho-
lesterol emboli when weighing the risks
and benefits of endovascular proce-
dures such as cardiac catheterization.
The limitations of this study include
the fact that only one eye was photo-
graphed. However, diabetic retinopa-
thy is usually bilateral and symmetri-
cal. In the Wisconsin Epidemiologic
Study of Diabetic Retinopathy, only 9%
of the 991 adults had diabetic retinopa-
thy in one eye, while 63% had bilateral
disease and the remaining adults had no
retinopathy (oral communication, Ron-
ald Klein, MD, MPH, Department of
Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences,
UniversityofWisconsinMedicalSchool,
Madison, November 4, 2002). In addi-
tion, the definition of diabetic retinopa-
thy in this study included any evidence
of previous photocoagulation for dia-
betic retinopathy, which would have in-
creased the sensitivity for detecting dia-
betic retinopathy. Albuminuria was
assessed using a single specimen. The
NHANES III repeated spot urine collec-
tions in a subsample of 1241 partici-
pants (including diabetic patients).
Among those with microalbuminuria,
only63%hadmicroalbuminuriaormac-
roalbuminuriainthesecondurinespeci-
men.However,allindividualswithmac-
roalbuminuria in the first urine sample
had either macroalbuminuria or micro-
albuminuria in the second urine
sample.21 If approximately one third of
theadultswithmicroalbuminuriawould
not have increased urine albumin excre-
tiononrepeatassessment,thisstudymay
have underestimated the number of
adultswithtype2DMwithreducedGFR
in the absence of (persistent) albumin-
uria and retinopathy. In addition,
NHANES III was conducted between
1988-1994,andsubsequentresearchhas
shown that the prevalence of diabetes in
the United States has significantly in-
creased during the past decade.27 Fi-
nally, as there were no protocol renal bi-
opsies in NHANES III, we can only infer
that reduced GFR among adults with
type 2 DM without retinopathy or albu-
minuria was not due to classic diabetic
glomerulosclerosis.
In conclusion, more than 1 million
adults 40 years of age or older with type
2DMintheUnitedStateshaveCRI(GFR
 60 mL/min per 1.73 m2 BSA), and
about one third of them have no albu-
minuria or diabetic retinopathy. There-
fore, classic diabetic glomerulosclerosis
does not appear to be the underlying re-
nal lesion in a substantial number of dia-
betic adults with CRI. Our results sug-
