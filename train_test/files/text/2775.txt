Abstract
Objective: To compare the performance of waist-to-height ratio as a screening tool
for cardiometabolic conditions ­ hypertension, prediabetes/diabetes, dyslipidemia,
and subclinical inflammation ­ in 5 race/ethnic groups of mid-life women.
Methods: Waist-to-height ratio and 4 cardiometabolic conditions were assessed in
3033 premenopausal midlife women (249 Hispanic, 226 Chinese, 262 Japanese,
1435 European-American, and 861 African American). The areas under the receiver
operating characteristic curve (AUROC) were compared across the five race/ethnic
groups using waist-to-height ratio to determine the likelihood of the four cardiometa-
bolic conditions.
Results: The performance of waist-to-height ratio to detect one or more cardiometa-
bolic conditions was comparable among all race/ethnic groups (AUROC> 0.60,
p 5 0.252), and was good/fair (AUROC > 0.60) when hypertension, prediabetes/dia-
betes, dyslipidemia, or subclinical inflammation were analyzed separately. The
performance of waist-to-height ratio of 0.50 was skewed towards higher specificity
among groups with low prevalence of cardiometabolic conditions and lower median
waist-to-height ratio, and towards higher sensitivity among groups with high preva-
lence of cardiometabolic conditions and higher median waist-to-height ratio.
Conclusions: Waist-to-height ratio can be used for community-based screening of
mid-life women who may need secondary prevention for cardiometabolic conditions.
A simple public health message: "Keep your waist to less than half of your height"
applies to midlife women.

1 | INTRODUCTION
Indices of abdominal obesity, especially waist-to-height ratio
(WHtR), appear to be superior to body mass index (BMI) to
screen individuals for cardiometabolic conditions (hyperten-
sion, dyslipidemia, prediabetes/diabetes, and subclinical
inflammation), cardiovascular disease, and years of life lost
(Ashwell, Gunn, & Gibson, 2012; Ashwell, Mayhew,
Richardson, & Rickayzen, 2014; Kodama et al., 2012).
Moreover, WHtR has been advocated as a practical

screening tool for cardiometabolic complications irrespective
of age and sex (Ashwell et al., 2014). A universal boundary
value aiming at WHtR < 0.5 has been proposed to simplify
public health messages for prevention of obesity-related mor-
bidity (Browning, Hsieh, & Ashwell, 2010).
Although the studies supporting WHtR use have included
ethnically diverse populations globally, most data are avail-
able from cohorts of Asian-Pacific, African, and European
descent (Evans et al., 2011). More research is needed to
explore the associations of WHtR with the range of cardiome-
tabolic conditions in American women of diverse race/ethnic
backgrounds (Harris, Stevens, Thomas, Schreiner, & Folsom,
2000; Kotchen et al., 2008).
Our objective was to compare the WHtR as a screening
tool for hypertension, dyslipidemia, prediabetes/diabetes,
subclinical inflammation among Hispanic, Chinese, Japa-
nese, European-American, and African American mid-life
women. Our secondary objective was to explore the perform-
ance of a screening-relevant WHtR > 0.5 boundary value to
screen for cardiometabolic outcomes across these 5 race/eth-
nic groups.
2 | METHODS
Participants were enrolled in Study of Woman's Health
Across the Nation (SWAN), a longitudinal, multiethnic/
racial, seven-site cohort study of the health determinants
across the menopausal transition. SWAN's recruitment meth-
ods, eligibility criteria, and design have been published (Mat-
thews et al., 2005; Sowers et al., 2000). Briefly, women were
42­52 years old, non-pregnant, not-lactating; reported a men-
strual period and no use of hormone therapy during the 3
months preceding enrollment, and self-identified as one of
the five race/ethnic groups: African American (from Boston,
Chicago, Pittsburgh, and the Detroit area), Chinese (from
Oakland, CA), Hispanic (from Newark, NJ), Japanese (from
Los Angeles, CA), and European-American (all sites). Each
site recruited community-based cohorts of European-
American women and women from one pre-specified minor-
ity group. This report includes study baseline data (1996­
1997) from 3033 participants (92%) with a complete set of
variables to define WHtR and cardiometabolic conditions
(hypertension, dyslipidemia, prediabetes/diabetes, and sub-
clinical inflammation).
A standardized SWAN protocol was used to measure
anthropometric indicators (waist circumference and height),
medication use, diabetes history, and cardiometabolic risk
indicators (blood pressure, fasting serum glucose and lipids),
as previously described (Matthews et al., 2005; Sowers et al.,
2000). Specifically, waist circumference was measured to the
nearest 0.1 cm with a measuring tape placed horizontally
around the narrowest part of the torso over undergarments or
light clothing at the end of a normal exhalation. WHtR was
calculated as waist circumference (cm)/height(cm). Three
blood pressure measurements were taken with the participant
seated after a minimum of 5 min of rest, and the last 2 values
were averaged. The technicians were certified for their per-
formance and compliance with the standard SWAN protocol
before collecting physical measures. The venous blood sam-
ples collected after an 8-hour fast were used for analysis of
fasting glucose, triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein cho-
lesterol (HDL), and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein
(hsCRP). If the participant admitted eating within 8 hours of
blood collection, the non-fasting state was indicated (<5% of
samples across all race/ethnic groups). Medical history and
prescription medication use was assessed using standard
SWAN questionnaires.
Using the data collected in the SWAN study at baseline,
high cardiometabolic risk was defined as having at least one
of the FOUR cardiometabolic conditions:
1 Prediabetes/diabetes, defined as a fasting blood glucose
5.56 mmol/L (or non-fasting of 7.78 mmol/L), self-
reported diagnosis of diabetes, or use of glucose-
lowering medications (American Diabetes Association,
2015).
2 Hypertension, defined as a blood pressure 140/90 mm
Hg, or use of prescription antihypertensive medications
(Go et al., 2014).
3 Dyslipidemia, defined as fasting triglyceride level 1.70
mmol/L (or non-fasting 2.26 mmol/L), HDL-
cholesterol< 1.29 mmol/L, or use of prescription lipid-
lowering medications (Stone et al., 2014).
4 Subclinical inflammation, defined as high-sensitivity C-
reactive protein (hsCRP) level 2 mg/L (Blaha et al.,
2011).
Three methods were used to compare the performance of
the WHtR as a screening marker for cardiometabolic condi-
tions among race/ethnic groups. First, the Area Under the
Receiver Operating Characteristic Curves (AUROC) was cal-
culated with WHtR as a classification variable and each of
the cardiometabolic conditions as a reference variable.
AUROCs for each race/ethnicity were compared using the
method of DeLong (DeLong, DeLong, & Clarke-Pearson,
1988). The discriminative performance was considered good
if AUROC was >0.70, fair if AUROC was 0.60­0.70, and
poor if AUROC was <0.60 (Xia, Wilson, & Wishart, 2013).
Second, we calculated the optimal WHtR boundary values
for each cardiometabolic condition in each race/ethnic group
using the maximum of the Youden index (J) based on the
observed data (Bantis, Nakas, & Reiser, 2014). Third,
the summary ROC curve were derived using the STATA
midas module (Dwamena, Sylvester, & Calrlos, 2010) for

WHtR 5 0.50 in each condition and within each race/ethnic
group. All analyses were performed using STATA®, version
14.1 (StataCorp, College Station, TX).
3 | RESULTS
By design, almost half of the cohort was non-Hispanic Euro-
pean-American, a quarter was African American, whereas
Hispanic, Chinese, and Japanese women represented 8.2,
7.5, and 8.6%, respectively (Supporting Information Table
S1). Age at baseline was 45.9 6 2.7 years, similar across
race/ethnic groups. Of note, African American and
European-American women were >6 cm taller on average
than Hispanic, Chinese, and Japanese women. More than
57% of African American and Hispanic women had
WHtR > 0.5, compared to less than one fifth of Chinese and
Japanese women (Figure 1). The prevalence of high car-
diometabolic risk (1 cardiometabolic condition) ranged
50-85% across race/ethnicities, with lowest prevalence in
Chinese and Japanese women (Supporting Information
Table S2).
The association of WHtR with cardiometabolic condi-
tions was good/fair in all 5 race/ethnic groups (Table 1).
Although the discriminative performance was significantly
different among race/ethnic groups in models for individual
cardiometabolic conditions (except for hypertension model),
the performance of WHtR was similar in high cardiometa-
bolic risk (1 condition) models. This suggests a good/fair
performance of WHtR as a screening marker for cardiometa-
bolic health in women of all 5 races/ethnicities.
The determination of optimal WHtR boundary value
using the maximum of the Youden index (J) suggests hetero-
geneity across race/ethnic groups (Figure 1). The heterogene-
ity of the optimal WHtR boundary values to predict each
cardiometabolic condition was lower within the race/ethnic-
ity, perhaps due to overlap of cardiometabolic conditions
within the groups.
The previously proposed "WHtR global boundary value
of 0.50" (Browning, Hsieh, & Ashwell, 2010) was tested
across the 4 individual cardiometabolic conditions in 5 race/
ethnic groups (condition 3 group data points n 5 20) by
constructing a summary ROC curve (Figure 2). Significant
heterogeneity (v2 likelihood ratio test Q 5 582.7, dF 5 2.0,
p < 0.001) was observed among the 20 data points (Dwa-
mena et al., 2010). The performance of WHtR global bound-
ary value of 0.50 was skewed towards higher specificity in
Chinese and Japanese women (with lower prevalence of car-
diometabolic conditions and lower median WHtR); skewed
towards higher sensitivity in African American and Hispanic
women (with high prevalence of cardiometabolic conditions
and high median WHtR); and clustered around the summary
operating point (with sensitivity of 0.75, 95% CI 0.69­0.79,
and specificity of 0.59, 95% CI 0.49­0.68) in European­
American women. The performance characteristics of WHtR
were similar within each racial/ethnic group, perhaps due to
overlap of cardiometabolic conditions. Yet, the analysis indi-
cates residual variability in adiposity thresholds among race/
ethnic groups, possibly related to the spectrum of WHtR dis-
tribution (Figure 1) and prevalence of cardiometabolic condi-
tions (Supporting Information Table S2), both higher in

ples were non-fasting), or HDL-cholesterol< 1.29 mmol/L or
use of any prescription lipid-lowering medications (Stone
et al., 2014). Prediabetes/diabetes was defined as fasting blood
glucose 5.56 mmol/L (or non-fasting 7.78 mmol/L), self-
reported diagnosis of diabetes, or use of glucose-lowering med-
ications (American Diabetes Association, 2015)

4 | DISCUSSION
This is the first study directly comparing the performance of
WHtR as a screening marker for cardiometabolic conditions
among mid-life women from 5 race/ethnic backgrounds
residing in the United States. The overall discriminative per-
formance of WHtR was good to fair across all five race/
ethnic groups to screen for hypertension, dyslipidemia, pre-
diabetes/diabetes, or subclinical inflammation. In general,
our study supports the previously advocated public health
message "Keep your waist less than half of your height" for
adiposity-related primary prevention of non-communicable
diseases (Ashwell et al., 2012; Ware et al., 2014). However,
the "global WHtR boundary value of 0.50" (Browning et al.,
2010) has higher specificity in Chinese and Japanese women,
and higher sensitivity in African American and Hispanic
women. It is worth noting that our primary objective is to
evaluate the WHtR as a screening test in the community-
based settings to identify whether one may need further diag-
nostic testing for cardiometabolic conditions in a health care
setting. WHtR does not replace the standard testing to diag-
nose individual cardiometabolic conditions. Abdominal obe-
sity (with high WHtR) is one of the several related
conditions contributing to cardiometabolic risk, and the other
conditions (such as hypertension, dyslipidemia, prediabetes,
and subclinical inflammation) require more specific diagnos-
tic testing.
Adjustment for height intends to normalize WHtR for
body build, related to race/ethnicity (Katzmarzyk et al.,
2011). However, residual race/ethnic variation in WHtR
boundary values persists after adjustment for height, and cor-
relates with race/ethnicity-specific prevalence of cardiometa-
bolic outcomes (Supporting Information Table S2) and the
spectrum of WHtR (Figure 1), suggesting the influence of
adipose tissue distribution, plasticity, expandability or other
biological processes in the common pathogenesis of cardio-
metabolic conditions (Wells, 2012).
The principal strength of our study is the large and diverse
sample of mid-life women which allows a 5-race/ethnic com-
parison of WHtR in screening for 4 common cardiometabolic
conditions. For the purpose of race/ethnic comparisons in our
analyses, the age homogeneity in our cohort offered an
advantage, as cardiometabolic conditions are also related to
aging.
The principal limitation of our study was the inability to
assess the longitudinal relationship of WHtR with incident
mortality and cardiovascular outcomes in this racially/ethni-
cally diverse cohort. However, hypertension, dyslipidemia,
prediabetes/diabetes, and subclinical inflammation are known
to predict global cardiovascular risk regardless of race/eth-
nicity. The narrow age range and only women participants
limit the generalizability of our findings to the other age
groups and to men.
