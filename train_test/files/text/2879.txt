Abstract
This paper describes the rst thorough analysis of the interest risk of German banks on an
individual bank level. We develop a new method that is based on time series of accounting-
based data to quantify the interest risk of banks and apply it to analyze the German banking
system. We nd evidence that our model yields a signicantly better t of banks' internally
quantied interest rate risk than a standard approach that relies on one-point-in-time data, and
that the interest rate risk diers between banks of dierent size and banking group. Additionally,
we nd structural dierences between trading book and non-trading book institutions.

Non technical Summary
While over the past few years both banking supervisors and researchers have nearly exclusively
focussed their attention on banks' credit and operational risk, the spotlight is now being turned
again on interest rate risk. One reason for this is its threat to the stability of the nancial
system as a kind of systematic risk. So far, there is still little evidence on the interest rate
risk of most German banks. Within this paper, we examine for the rst time the interest rate
risk of all German universal banks on an individual bank level and analyze its determinants
with respect to banks' attributes. For this purpose, we develop a new model that allows the
quantication of banks' interest rate risk using accounting-based data like balance sheets or
regulatory information.
Interest rate risk refers to the exposure of a bank's nancial condition to adverse move-
ments in interest rates. Principally, it arises from the maturity mismatch of a bank's assets and
liabilities as well as from its o-balance positions. Since, for most banks, there are no bank
internal information or market values available, we use accounting-based data for our estima-
tion. Accounting-based information on the maturity of a bank's assets and liabilities is typically
given in a form with little detail, in so-called `time bands'. The Basel Committee on Banking
Supervision suggested a standardized framework to quantify the interest rate risk of banks using
this information under general assumptions. Similar models are applied by supervisors of other
countries. To obtain better estimates of the maturity of a bank's assets and liabilities, we develop
a new model (Time Series Accounting-Based Model, TAM), that allows the integration of time
series information and dierent data sources. We estimate this model for the German banking
system on individual bank level.
Comparing the results to the bank internally quantied interest rate risk that is available for a
subsample of banks, we show that our model is indeed able to explain the cross-sectional variation
of banks' interest rate risk better than a standard approach that relies on assumptions similar
to the models proposed in the literature. We nd evidence that savings banks and cooperative
banks have a signicantly higher interest rate risk. In addition, the interest rate risk increases
with the bank's size, and the interest rate risk of trading book institutions is larger than that of
non-trading book institutions.
Nicht-technische Zusammenfassung
Während in den vergangenen Jahren das Interesse von Bankenaufsicht und Forschung fast auss-
chlieÿlich Kreditrisiken und operationellen Risiken gegolten hat, rückt zunehmend auch das Zin-
srisiko aufgrund seiner Eigenschaft als systematisches Risiko in den Blickpunkt. Bis dato gibt es
jedoch keine verlässlichen Informationen zum Zinsänderungsrisiko der meisten deutschen Banken.
In dieser Arbeit analysieren wir erstmalig das Zinsrisiko aller deutschen Universalbanken auf
Einzelbankebene und analysieren dessen Einussfaktoren. Zu diesem Zweck entwickeln wir ein
Modell, anhand dessen das Zinsrisiko von Banken über buchhalterische Gröÿen, wie beispiels-
weise den Jahresabschluss oder regulatorische Meldungen, quantiziert werden kann.
Das Zinsrisiko bezeichnet die Gefahr, dass sich Zinsänderungen negativ auf die Finanzlage
einer Bank auswirken. Es wird im Wesentlichen durch die Fristeninkongruenz von Forderungen
und Verbindlichkeiten der Bank sowie durch auÿerbilanzielle Geschäfte bestimmt. Da für die
meisten deutschen Banken weder bankinterne Informationen zum Zinsrisiko noch Marktwerte
verfügbar sind, verwenden wir für unsere Schätzungen buchhalterische Gröÿen. Buchhalterische
Informationen zur Fristigkeit der Forderungen und Verbindlichkeiten von Banken liegen im All-
gemeinen wenig detailliert nach Zeitbändern vor. Der Baseler Ausschuss für Bankenaufsicht hat
einen Modellrahmen vorgeschlagen, um anhand dieser Gröÿen unter pauschalen Annahmen auf
das Zinsrisiko von Banken zu schlieÿen. Ähnliche Modelle werden auch von Aufsichtsbehörden in
anderen Ländern verwendet. Um genauere Schätzungen für die Fristigkeit der Aktiva und Passiva
einer Bank zu erhalten, entwickeln wir ein neues Modell (Time Series Accounting-Based Model,
TAM), das Zeitreiheninformationen und Informationen aus verschiedenen Datenquellen integri-
eren kann. Dieses Modell schätzen wir für das deutsche Bankensystem auf Einzelbankebene.
Über einen Vergleich mit bankinternen Daten zum Zinsrisiko, die uns für einen Teil der
Banken vorliegen, können wir zeigen, dass das hier vorgeschlagene Modell tatsächlich besser
zwischen den Zinsrisiken der Banken dierenzieren kann als ein Ansatz, wie er in der Literatur
vorgeschlagen wird. Wir nden Hinweise darauf, dass Sparkassen und Kreditgenossenschaften
ein deutlich höheres Zinsrisiko aufweisen als Kreditbanken. Zudem steigt das Zinsrisiko mit der
Gröÿe der Bank an, und Handelsbuchinstitute haben ein höheres Zinsrisiko als Nichthandels-
buchinstitute.

1 Introduction
While over the past few years both banking supervisors and researchers have nearly exclusively
focused their attention on banks' credit and operational risk, the spotlight is now being turned
again on interest rate risk. One reason for this is its threat to the stability of the nancial
system as a kind of systematic risk. In 2004, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision
(2004b) suggested `Principles for the Management and Supervision of Interest Rate Risk' that
go far beyond current practice. Within these principles the Committee states that this [interest
rate] risk is a normal part of banking and can be an important source of protability but stresses
that it is essential to the safety and soundness of banks that interest rate risk is maintained
within prudent levels. A historical example of a banking crisis where interest rate risk played an
integral role is the `Savings and Loan Crisis' which occurred in the US during the 1980s. Between
1980 and 1988, 563 of the approximately 4,000 then existing savings and loan institutions failed,
while further failures were prevented by 333 supervisory mergers. The total costs of the crisis
are estimated at USD 160 bn.

The German banking system has some features that make an investigation of interest rate
risk in this market especially interesting. First, German banks still typically act as qualitative
asset transformers which makes the German banking system quite particular in comparison to
other banking systems like in the US or UK (Schmidt et al., 1999; Allen and Santomero, 2001).
Interest rate risk hence still arises from the basic banking business. So far, there is no reliable

analysis of the interest rate risk of most German banks and its determinants, but there are
indications that the level of interest rate risk might be comparatively high: in 2006 the Deutsche
Bundesbank conducted a stress test among a sample of 25 banks. For 10 medium-sized and
smaller banks a 150 basis point interest rate shock caused an average loss of 15% of liable capital
(Deutsche Bundesbank, 2006a). Via scaling, this is close to the Basel Committee's denition of
`outlier banks' in case the supervisor sets the standardized interest rate shock to 200 basis point.
3
Second, the German universal banking system has a special structure: in addition to private
commercial banks (`Kreditbanken'), there are the state-owned savings banks (`Sparkassen') and
the member-owned cooperative banks (`Genossenschaftsbanken'). The banking groups dier
in their business model (Schmidt and Tyrell, 2004) and the relevance of their interest bearing
business (Deutsche Bundesbank, 2006b). Third, there is a large number of German universal
banks, approximately 2,000 in 2005. This fact facilitates empirical statements.
Because there is still no standardized access to banks' internally quantied interest rate risk,
most models proposed in the literature and applied by banking supervisors rely on accounting-
based data.
4
These include Bennett et al. (1986), Planta (1989), Patnaik and Shah (2004), and
the Federal Reserve's Economic Value Model (EVM) presented by Houpt and Embersit (1991)
and analyzed by Wright and Houpt (1996), Sierra (2004), and Sierra and Yeager (2004), as
well as the `standardized framework' suggested by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision
(2004b). The Net Portfolio Value Model applied by the Oce of Thrift Supervision (OTS) is
similar to these models but requires far more detailed information on the assets and liabilities of
banks that is exclusively available to the OTS (Oce of Thrift Supervision, 2000).
Accounting-based data typically shows the amount of positions within certain time bands:
3The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (2004a,b) recommends the supervisors to be particularly at-
tentive to those banks (= outlier banks) whose interest rate risk in the banking book leads to an economic value
decline of more than 20% of the sum of Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital (= liable capital) following a standardized
interest rate shock. This standardized interest rate shock can be set to ±200 basis point or to the 1% and 99%
percentiles of the yearly interest rate change.
4There is an extensive literature on the interest rate sensitivity of stock returns of exchange-traded banks.
See Staikouras (2003, 2006) for recent surveys. However, as most German banks are not listed, this approach for
analyzing the interest rate risk is not applicable for the vast majority of German banks.
2
the total outstanding amount of a given position is distributed among a number of time bands
according to remaining time to maturity (e.g. in the US) and/or initial maturity (e.g. in
Germany). Given this information, the cash ow structure of a bank's on-balance positions and
its interest rate sensitivity can be estimated, but the results depend on the assumed distribution
of maturities within these time bands. For example, the Federal Reserve's EVM assumes a
concentration in the middle of the time bands to estimate the interest rate risk of US commercial
banks, which is also suggested by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (2004b). Bennett
et al. (1986) assume a uniform distribution.
In this context, our contribution to the literature is threefold: rst, we present a new method
to derive a bank's interest rate risk using time series of accounting-based data. This allows us
to estimate the distribution of maturities within the time bands. By doing so, we get greater
precision with our estimates of the interest rate risk. The framework is a generalization of the
aforementioned models such as the EVM and the proposal of the Basel Committee on Banking
Supervision (2004b) and is exible enough to capture dierent actual reporting practices, for
example in the US and Germany, as well as the `reporting framework' suggested by the Basel
Committee on Banking Supervision (2004b). Additionally, it allows the integration of several
data sources that are available to regulators and/or external analysts.
Second, using unique data on the bank internally quantied interest rate risk in the banking
book that is available exclusively to the German supervisory authorities, we evaluate our model
on a subsample of German banks. Wright and Houpt (1996) in turn evaluate the Federal Re-
serve's EVM on regulatory data, Sierra (2004) on stock returns, and Sierra and Yeager (2004)
on accounting performance measures.
Third, we examine for the rst time the interest rate risk of the German universal banking
system on an individual bank level and analyze its determinants with respect to banks' at-
tributes. So far, the interest rate risk has only been analyzed for small samples of German banks
using market values of equity (e.g. Oertmann et al., 2000) or bank internal data (e.g. Deutsche
Bundesbank, 2006a).
The empirical evidence in this paper can be summarized as follows: rst, our model is able
to explain the cross-sectional variation of the interest rate risk of banks more accurately than a
3
standard approach that relies on one-point-in-time data. Second, bigger banks have a higher level
of interest rate risk than smaller banks and third, the interest rate risk of German banks diers
between the banking groups. Savings banks and cooperative banks tend to have a higher level
of interest rate risk than private commercial banks. Additionally, there are structural dierences
in the interest rate risk of trading book and non-trading book institutions.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 outlines our hypotheses. The
method is presented in Section 3. Section 4 contains the description of the data sources, the
model evaluation and the analysis of the interest rate risk of German banks. Section 5 concludes.
2 Hypotheses
The aforementioned models that aim to quantify the interest rate risk of banks using accounting-
based information rely on one-point-in-time data. To derive the cash ow structure of a bank
and its interest rate risk, these models use information on time bands of the maturities of the
bank's assets and liabilities and assume a certain distribution of maturities within the time bands.
Wright and Houpt (1996) argue that the Federal Reserve's EVM, acting as a representative of
these simple models, yields results similar to the more complex Net Portfolio Value Model of the
OTS. We in turn expect that the integration of time series information and dierent data sources
 such as the breakdown by initial maturity  signicantly improves our ability to explain the
cross-sectional variation of banks' interest rate risk even though our model relies on data that
basically has the same simple structure as the input data of the EVM.
Hypothesis 1 (Model Quality) Our model is able to explain the cross-sectional variation of
banks' interest rate risk better than a standard approach that relies on one-point-in-time data.
Maturity transformation is often seen as a specic function of banks (e.g. Niehans, 1978):
customers tend to borrow long-term capital and to lend short-term capital. Additionally, banks
may have an incentive to lend out for the long term and renance for the short term since
the slope of the term structure is usually positive (e.g. Bhattacharya and Thakor, 1993): on
average, long-term interest rates (for assets) exceed the short-term interest rates (for liabilities).
Thus, on average, the bank achieves a premium from maturity transformation. On the other
4
hand, the resulting maturity mismatch between the assets and liabilities causes interest rate
risk. While there is the incentive to bear interest rate risk due to the expected yield, there
are several economic reasons why rms should manage and limit their risks (e.g. Allen and
Santomero, 1998). These include, among others, costs of nancial distress (Warner, 1977) and
capital market imperfections (Froot et al., 1993; Froot and Stein, 1998). The literature expects
that smaller banks have a higher incentive to keep their exposure to interest rate risk low than
bigger banks for several reasons: rst, bigger banks may be assumed to be too big to fail by
their investors and other stakeholders and hence face lower nancial distress costs (e.g. Saunders
et al., 1990). Second, bigger banks are more diversied than smaller banks and hence have a
lower level of idiosyncratic risk. To obtain a certain level of total risk, these banks may bear
more systematic (interest rate) risk (e.g. Demsetz and Strahan, 1997). Third, the information
risk may be lower for investors of bigger banks and hence may be substituted by interest rate
risk (e.g. Banz, 1981). Fourth, bigger banks may have more opportunities to trade their risk on
the capital market and hence to alter their exposure to interest rate risk via o-balance activities
quickly, once a stress situation occurs. Hence, we hypothesize for the German banking system:
Hypothesis 2 (Bank Size) Bigger banks have a higher level of interest rate risk than smaller
banks.
We expect that the interest rate risk does not only depend on a bank's size but also on its banking
group. An explanation is that the business model of savings banks and cooperative banks is prone
to term transformation. Therefore, we hypothesize for the German banking system:
Hypothesis 3 (Banking Group) The interest rate risk diers between banking groups. Sav-
ings banks and cooperative banks have a higher level of interest rate risk than private commercial
banks.

3 Model
3.1 Denition of Interest Rate Risk
In order to apply a comparable and widely accepted measure for the interest rate risk of banks,
we follow the `standardized interest rate shock' approach also proposed within the new Basel
Capital Accord (Basel II) and the `Principles for the Management and Supervision of Interest
Rate Risk' that are published by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (2004a,b):
Denition 1 (Interest Rate Risk) The interest rate risk (IRR) of a bank is given by the
maximum absolute decline of its economic value caused by an upward and downward 200 basis
point parallel interest rate shock in relation to its regulatory capital.
Approximating the interest rate sensitivity by the duration, the interest rate risk of a bank in
tref (`reference date') is measured by:
5
IRR(tref ) = 0.02
tCF >tref
(tCF - tref )
P
posP OSA
CF(pos,tref ,tCF )- P
posP OSL
CF(pos,tref ,tCF )
(1+Rac(tref ,tCF ))(tCF -tref +1)
RC(tref )
. (1)
RC(tref ) denotes the regulatory capital in tref . POSA is the set of all interest rate-sensitive
asset positions, POSL the set of all interest rate-sensitive liability positions and {tCF } the set of
all points in time when cash ows are due. CF(pos, tref , tCF ) denotes the cash ow of position
pos in tCF > tref from the perspective of tref .
6
The set of all CF(pos, tref , tCF ) will be referred
to as `cash ow structure'. Finally, Rac(tref , tCF ) represents the annually compounded spot rate
in tref for the date tCF . In line with the earlier accounting-based models (See Section 1) we only
capture here the interest rate risk of the net portfolio value, excluding other components such as
the exposure of the going concern value (See Samuelson, 1945).
5It is well known that the duration of a defaultable cash ow usually diers from the duration of a corresponding
default-free cash ow. Jacoby and Roberts (2003) provide a recent literature overview. In line with the approaches
proposed in the literature (See Section 1) we assume default-free cash ows and apply the eective duration (See
Ho, 1990).
6The cash ow due in tCF
= tref
does not inuence the bank's interest rate risk and is hence omitted.
6
The key to the analysis is determining the detailed cash ow structure in (1) that is usually
unknown to regulators, external analysts and a bank's stake holders. In the following, we present
a new method to derive this cash ow structure using accounting-based data. Since the distinctive
feature of our model is the ability to integrate time series information, we refer to the model as
`Time Series Accounting-Based Model' (TAM). To highlight the underlying idea, we start with
a simplied example before we present the general framework.
3.2 Introductory Example
The bank is assumed to contract only one type of interest rate-sensitive, default-free business in
each year with initial maturities of 1, 2, 3, 4, and/or 5 years. To keep the example as simple
as possible, we omit here payments other than those due to the face value at maturity. Thus,
the cash ow structure is completely determined by the face values of contracted business and
the corresponding maturity dates. For the reference date tref = 0, the bank structure, i.e. the
composition of the portfolio the bank holds, is shown in the top of Figure 1, where
Xtbeg,tend  0  tbeg, tend (2)
denotes the face value of business that has been contracted in tbeg and that matures in tend.
The cash ow in tCF > tref is the sum of all business with maturity date tCF that has been
contracted until tref :
CF(tref , tCF ) =
itref
Xi,tCF . (3)
If each Xtbeg,tend in (3) or each cash ow CF(tref , tCF ) were known to the regulators or
external analysts, they could easily calculate the interest rate risk in tref via (1). However,
banks do not usually report the Xtbeg,tend nor the detailed cash ows. But they regularly report
the outstanding amount of the business within certain time bands according to the remaining
time to maturity and/or the initial maturity.
Assume that the bank's annual report in t gives the outstanding amount of the business with
a remaining time to maturity of up to 1 year, denoted by RTM0,1
t , and of more than 1 year and
up to 3 years, denoted by RTM1,3
t . If regulators only take RTM0,1
0 and RTM1,3
0 into account,
they know in t = 0 the cash ow that is due in one year but cannot distinguish between the cash
7
ows in 2 and 3 years, because only its sum RTM1,3
0 is reported. However, they can gain further
information if they incorporate past reports: since the remaining time to maturity of a certain
business decreases from date to date, the business migrates between the time bands over time.
This eect can be used to restrict the estimates of future cash ows.
For illustration, we restrict our example to two reporting dates: t = 0 and t = -1. As
RTM0,1
0 denotes the business in t = 0 that has a remaining time to maturity of 1 year it consists
of business that had a remaining time to maturity of 2 years in the previous date t = -1
and new business that is contracted in t = 0 and that matures in 1 year. Hence, we know
that CF(-1, 1)  RTM0,1
0 . This relation also provides information on CF(-1, 2), as the sum
of both cash ows equals the report item RTM1,3
-1
= CF(-1, 1) + CF(-1, 2). Some minor
rearrangements yield CF(-1, 2)  RTM1,3
-1
- RTM0,1
0 . Additionally, CF(-1, 2) cannot exceed
CF(0, 2), since the latter consists of the former plus the business contracted in t = 0 that matures
in t = 2. Hence, we can conclude that
CF(0, 2)  RTM1,3
-1
- RTM0,1
0
. (4)
This relationship restricts possible values of CF(0, 3), too, as the sum of both equals the amount
reported in the time band RTM1,3
0 :
CF(0, 3)  RTM1,3
0
- (RTM1,3
-1
- RTM0,1
0
). (5)
This simple example shows that former reports can indeed add information on today's cash
ow structure by restricting the possible estimates and, hence, can improve the estimation of
a bank's interest rate risk. When we model a realistic bank with a lot of dierent positions,
time bands and reporting dates, the system of equations becomes rather complex and unhandy.
However, the representation can be conceptually simplied by using the above-dened variables
Xtbeg,tend to express each single report item as a function of these variables.
For instance, Figure 1 shows the bank structure in t = 0 (top) and t = -1 (bottom). The
outstanding amounts with a remaining time to maturity of up to 1 year and those of more than
1 year and up to 3 years, respectively, are marked on the left-hand side. Since the reported
amounts equal the sum of the business within the respective time bands, the following equations

This formulation additionally allows us to easily integrate further sources of relevant infor-

The approaches proposed in the literature only use the information of (6a) and (6c) and omit
the remaining information. Equations (6a) to (7d) ((6a) to (6d) if reports on the initial maturity
are not available) and the non-negativity restriction (2) form a system of linear equations that
restricts the possible bank structure, and hence via (3) and (1) the bank's interest rate risk.
However, in general the system of equations is not uniquely determined. Instead, there exists
a space of solutions of bank structures that are all consistent with the reported data.

To identify
an economically sensible solution, further assumptions are necessary. For illustration, we here
assume that the cash ow structure of the bank is as constant as possible over the two dates
t = 0 and t = -1. This can be expressed by optimizing a function F on the space of solutions:
we select that solution that minimizes the sum of the quadratic deviations between t = 0 and

above in a general framework.
3.3 General Framework
Analogous to the previous example, we start by describing the bank structure. We choose a
discrete setting that allows us to capture the bank structure by a nite number of variables. Due
to the discrete granularity of the available data, no information is omitted.
Model Component 1 (Bank Structure) The bank contracts interest rate-sensitive default-
free business in certain time points with a xed time to maturity and a xed, periodically paid
coupon. Once contracted, the business is on-balance with a constant amount until its maturity.
The cash ow implied by each business consists of the repayment of the face value and coupon
payments.
The assumption of a xed, periodically paid coupon as well as the omission of amortization pay-
ments and default of assets can be relaxed easily. However, calculations on a subsample of banks
have shown that these assumptions do not aect our later results but yield a reduction of cal-
culation burden. A possible bias implied by these or the remaining assumptions is compensated
as shown in Section 4. We go on formalizing Model Component 1.
The set of points in time when business is contracted and/or cash ows are due is given by
T = {ti}iZ where we set t0 = 0 for simplicity. In each tbeg  T the bank contracts certain
11
amounts of business of a position pos  POS (such as customer loans on the asset side or
interbank liabilities on the liability side) that mature in tend > tbeg.
8
The amount is denoted
Xpos,tbeg,tend and assumed to be non-negative:
Xpos,tbeg,tend  0  pos, tbeg, tend. (8)
We will refer to these variables as `business items'. The set of all business items is referred to as
`bank structure'. The corresponding coupons are denoted cpos,tbeg,tend .
Under these assumptions, the cash ow in tCF > tref related to position pos is given by:
CF(pos, tref , tCF ) =
titref
Xpos,ti,tCF +
ti<tref , tjtCF
Xpos,ti,tj cpos,ti,tj . (9)
The rst part of the right-hand side of (9) denotes the payments due for the repayment of the
face values of all business items that are on-balance in tref and that mature tCF . The second
part represents the corresponding coupon payments.
Model Component 2 (Reports on the Bank Structure) At certain points in time the bank
reveals information on its structure by reporting time bands of the outstanding amount for each
position broken down by remaining time to maturity and/or initial maturity, respectively.
This assumption captures current reporting practice. In each reporting date t  Tobs  T the
bank reports the sum of all business (classied by position) within specied ranges of remaining
time to maturity and/or initial maturity, respectively. We assume that for each pos  POS in
each t  Trtm
obs
 Tobs there are |Npos| report items characterized by the business' remaining time
to maturity: RTMpos,n
t with n  Npos denotes the amount of pos in t with a remaining time to
maturity tend - t within the time band (hpos,n
lower
; hpos,n
upper].
9
Analogously, in each t  Titm
obs
 Tobs
there are |Mpos| items characterized by the business' initial maturity: ITMpos,m
t with m 
Mpos denotes the amount of pos in t with an initial maturity tend - tbeg within the time band
(hpos,m
lower
; hpos,m
upper ].
8Daily maturing business is not included, since  applied for the German banking system  the model cannot
distinguish between daily and monthly maturing business due to the monthly granularity of the reports.
9According to German reporting practice, we model left open intervals.
12
Since the amount within a certain time band equals the sum of the relevant business items,
the former can be expressed as a linear function of the latter. Thus we obtain one function
(restriction) for each reported time band and each reporting date, leading to a system of linear
equations:
hpos,n

, m  Mpos, (11)
where (10) captures the restrictions due to reports on the remaining time to maturity and (11)
those on the initial maturity.
Model Component 3 (Objective Function) An economically sensible solution is obtained
by the optimization of a function on the space of solutions.
The system of equations given by (10), (11) and (8) restricts the values of the business items
Xpos,tbeg,tend and hence via (9) and (1) the bank's interest rate risk. However, it is clear that the
system is in general not uniquely determined, i.e. it is not possible to infer the bank structure
and the bank's interest rate risk unambiguously using accounting-based data. Thus, analogously
to the example, further assumptions on the bank structure are necessary in order to identify an
economically sensible solution. These can again be formulated in terms of the optimization of a
function F (`objective function'
10
) on the space of solutions, and the optimization problem can
be expressed as follows:
optimize F(X)
subject to (10), (11), (8),
where X denotes the set of all business items Xpos,tbeg,tend .
10Note that we present a description model here, thus `objective function' does not refer to the bank's objective.

4 Empirical Analysis
4.1 Data
The analysis is based on German universal banks as of 31 December 2005. Table 1 shows the
composition of our sample. Banks for which data are incomplete are excluded from our analysis,
which results in a total of 1,785 banks, accounting for 92.4% of all German universal banks.
We make use of the following major regulatory data sources: the data schedule pursuant to the
auditor's report (`Sonderdatenkatalog') and the monthly balance sheet statistics (`Monatliche
Bilanzstatistik') for estimating the bank structure, and an interest rate risk survey for evaluating
our model. Due to structural breaks within the data sources at the end of 1998, we restrict our
sample to the period from January 1999 to December 2005. All data is provided by the Deutsche
Bundesbank.
The data schedule pursuant to the auditor's report contains asset and liability positions
broken down by remaining time to maturity for all banks on a yearly basis.
11
In contrast,
the monthly balance sheet statistics contain on a monthly basis a respective breakdown by

mation.
14
initial maturity.
12
We consider 3 interest rate-sensitive asset and 4 interest rate-sensitive liability
positions. The former include `interbank loans', `customer loans', and `debt securities held'. The
latter consist of `interbank liabilities', `customer liabilities', `debt securities issued', and `non-
maturing deposits'. The positions and the reported time bands are shown in Table 2.
Additionally, we use the Bundesbank's survey of lending and deposit rates (`Erhebung über
Soll- und Habenzinsen') and the MFI interest rate statistics, which replaced the former in 2003.
13
Both statistics contain monthly information on the coupons charged and paid by banks on new
business classied by time bands. For mid- and long-term default-free interest rates, we use
the term structure estimated by the Deutsche Bundesbank from German governmental bonds
according to Svensson (1994), and for the short-term rates we use the money market rates
reported by Frankfurt banks (`Geldmarktsätze am Frankfurter Bankplatz'). Regulatory capital
(own funds) is taken from the reports of Principle I.
14
To evaluate our model results for the German banking system we use a non-published interest
rate risk survey (IRRS) that was carried out by the Deutsche Bundesbank and the German
Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin). All German banks were asked to report the
losses in their banking book (in relation to regulatory capital) as a consequence of, among others,
a 200 basis point shift in the term structure according to their internal risk-management system.
The participation rate was nearly 60%. For these banks we have bank internal interest rate risk
reports for the reference date of 30 September 2005 that are consistent with our denition of
interest rate risk.
4.2 Model Specication
In order to test our hypotheses we estimate the interest rate risk of the German banking system
for the reference date of 31 December 2005 on the basis of the TAM using the data from January
1999 to December 2005. We have to specify the system of equations (10) and (11) and the coupons
of the respective business items to calculate the cashow structure via (9). In this context, we

The amounts in the data schedule according to the auditor's report do not t the corresponding data in the monthly balance sheet statistics for a
small number of banks. To obtain consistent data, we scale the former to t the latter for these banks.

need to decide how to deal with non-maturing deposits as there is no reliable information available
on the economic maturity structure or time bands of non-maturing deposits. Additionally, we
have to dene an objective function F to select an economically sensible solution from the space
of solutions.
The
system of equations is based on the positions and the time bands that are reported
within the data schedule pursuant to the auditor's report and the monthly balance sheet statistics
(See Table 2). Within our sample period, 7 yearly observations of the former and 84 monthly
observations of the latter report are available. Identifying the reference date December 2005
with tref = t0 = 0, we obtain Trtm
obs
= {-6, -5, ..., 0} and Titm
obs
= {-83/12, -82/12, ..., 0}. To
reduce calculation burden the initial maturity of business Xpos,tbeg,tend is restricted to tend -
tbeg  {1/12, ..., 6/12, 9/12, ..., 24/12, 30/12, ..., 60/12, 72/12, ..., 120/12}. This results in 21,864
variables and 1,750 linear equations plus the non-negativity restriction for each variable.
15
We assume that
coupons of positions that are contracted with banks or the capital market
equal the default-free market interest rate. For the remaining positions we take the coupons from
the statistics presented in Section 4.1 and assume that they refer to the middle of the reported
time bands. The coupons for the remaining maturities are obtained by interpolating the spreads
to the default-free capital market rates linearly between the coupons that are given.
To
select an economically sensible solution we assume a stable bank structure over the time
period 1999 to 2005.
16
`Stability' of the asset positions means here that the fraction of the
15The system of equations turned out to be not solvable for a small number of smaller banks. For these banks
our assumptions were not consistent with the reported data. To obtain a solution we selected that bank structure
that best tted the system of equations.
16Deshmukh et al. (1983) show in a simple framework that banks may have an incentive to alter their exposure
to interest rate risk depending on the magnitude and volatility of interest rates. Since the term structure of
interest rates was quite stable during the sample period, we maintain the assumption of a stable bank structure.
The actual specication of the objective function was selected in a simulation-based analysis. We modeled several
synthetic banks with reasonable business strategies such as constant or varying maturity transformation strategies.
We then created reports that the respective banks would have had submitted to the Deutsche Bundesbank and
applied several specications of the objective function to compare the respective model results with the theoretical
ones. Based on several measures of t like the sum of the absolute or quadratic deviations between the model
implied and the real cash ow structure at the reference date, we identied the actual specication as superior.
17
outstanding amount of all asset positions with a certain initial and/or remaining time to maturity
in relation to the complete outstanding amount of all asset positions of the respective date remains
as constant as possible over time. `Stability' of the liability positions is interpreted analogously.
We implement this by minimizing the sum of the quadratic deviations of the relative outstanding
amount with a certain remaining time to maturity and initial maturity, respectively, over all
possible maturities and all observation dates. See Appendix A for details.
Non-maturing deposits can be interpreted as short-term liabilities. However, it is well known
that they can exhibit a high level of interest rate risk (e.g. Hutchison and Pennacchi, 1996,
Jarrow and van Deventer, 1998, and O'Brien, 2000). This can to a large extent be explained by
the fact that the development of their volume and deposit rates turns out to be sticky, yielding
a duration or, equivalently, an economic maturity that is higher than that of other short-term
products. For estimating the most `reasonable' economic maturity of non-maturing deposits,
we make use of the IRRS above. For dierent assumptions about the economic maturity, we
calculate the TAM and estimate the following linear regression on the IRRS-subsample of banks
(IRRS-banks):
RMIRRS
i
=  +  RMTAM
i
+ i, (12)
where RMIRRS
i and RMTAM
i denote the interest rate risk for bank i derived from the IRRS and
the TAM, respectively. We choose the economic maturity which yields the highest R2. The best
t is obtained when we assume that the economic maturity of non-maturing deposits equals the
legal maturity of 3 months.
Interestingly, when we apply the bank-individual assumption to the economic maturity of
non-maturing deposits that is also reported in the IRRS, we obtain a rather poor t. This
suggests that a number of banks did not include their internally assumed exposure of non-
maturing deposits when reporting the interest rate risk, which implies that the evaluation of our
model in the following is quite conservative (i.e. we underestimate the model quality using the
IRRS), since we cannot distinguish between the respective banks.

4.3 Model Evaluation
To benchmark our model to standard approaches and hence to test Hypothesis 1, we addition-
ally estimate a `Benchmark Model' (BM) that relies on one-point-in-time data. We consider
the same asset and liability positions as for the TAM, assume also an economic maturity of 3
months for the deposits and use the breakdown by initial maturity on 31 December 2005 for the
remaining positions,
17
assuming that the business is concentrated in the middle of the reported
time bands.
18
Based on this, we assume that the business has been contracted continuously over
time and has a coupon of 5%. This allows us to derive a (continuous) cash ow structure for
each position and to estimate the interest rate risk analogously to (1).
For the evaluation we run regression (12) for the TAM and the analogue regression for the BM
on the subsample of IRRS-banks. The part of the cross-sectional variation of interest rate risk
explained by the respective models is measured by the coecients of determination R2, 27.33%
for the TAM and 19.15% for the BM, respectively (See Table 3). In Appendix B we develop
a procedure similar to Morgan (1939) that can tell whether the R2 dier signicantly. Table 3
shows the results. We nd strong evidence that the R2 of the TAM exceeds that of the BM and
17We rst estimated a model based on the remaining time to maturity in line with the standardized framework
proposed by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (2004b) which, however, yielded a rather poor t for
the IRRS. We therefore specify the BM based on the initial time to maturity, whereas all other assumptions are
in line with the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (2004b).
18For the time bands (2; ) and (5; ), we assume a concentration at 4 and 6, respectively.
19
conclude:
Result 1 There is strong evidence that the Time Series Accounting-Based Model is able to ex-
plain the cross-sectional variation of banks' interest rate risk better than the Benchmark Model.
Table 4 shows the R2 for some subsamples of IRRS-banks. We stress two distinctive features
here: rst, the TAM better ts the internal data of those banks that have not merged during
the sample period. Mergers are dealt with by creating an articial bank before the date of the
merger, aggregating the balance sheet positions. As the assumption of a stable structure over
time is quite strong for merged banks, our model provides better quality for banks that did not
merge during the sample period. However, in both samples, the TAM ts the banks' internal
data on the interest rate risk better than the BM.
Second, as reported in Section 4.2, we nd indications that a number of banks did not include
their internally assumed exposure of non-maturing deposits when reporting the interest rate risk
in the IRRS. If some banks include this exposure, we underestimate the model quality using the
IRRS as a benchmark. However, this problem should be less severe for banks that assume a low
economic maturity for non-maturing deposits. In fact, Table 4 shows that we obtain much better
results for these banks. In the rst quintile of the reported bank internal assumption about the
economic maturity of non-maturing deposits, the coecient of determination yields more than
50%, and for non-merged banks even more than 66%.
A detailed analysis (not reported here) shows that both the TAM and the BM overestimate
the true interest rate risk on average  assuming that the results of the IRRS represent the banks'
true interest rate risk. This is also reected in the regression results in Table 3. If the models
produce unbiased estimates of the true interest rate risk then the respective constants  should
be zero and the slopes  should be one. A positive (negative)  and a  bigger (smaller) than one
means that the respective model tends to underestimate (overestimate) the interest rate risk. The
slope for both models is positive but clearly smaller than one. As the constants are comparatively
small, this corresponds to the fact that both the TAM and the BM overestimate the interest
rate risk of banks. This bias was to be expected as it can be explained by our assumptions: we
exclude provisions and premature redemptions on the asset side and prolongation options on the

liability side and assume a very small economic maturity of non-maturing deposits, i.e. we tend
to overestimate the interest rate sensitivity of the asset side and underestimate the interest rate
sensitivity of the liability side. As banks usually have a positive duration gap (e.g. Deutsche
Bundesbank, 2003b), these assumptions hence cause higher estimates of the level of interest rate
risk. Additionally, we do not consider o-balance positions, such as interest derivatives, that
on average can be expected to be used to reduce interest rate risk by the banks (e.g. Schrand,
1997). Similar biases are also reported by Wright and Houpt (1996), Sierra (2004) and Sierra
and Yeager (2004) when evaluating the EVM. Since the coecient of determination is invariant
to any linear transformation our analysis of the model quality is not aected by the bias.
4.4 The Interest Rate Risk of German Banks
The next step is testing the Hypotheses 2 and 3. The previous Section 4.3 showed that our
estimates of the interest rate risk of banks are biased. Since the bias could depend on the banks'
characteristics, we unbias our estimates for size and banking group. In addition, we include a
control dummy variable for trading book institutions.
We estimate the following regression for the banks that took part in the IRRS:
RMIRRS
i
=  + 1 RMTAM
i
+ 2 Log(Assetsi) + SB DSB
i
+ CB DCB
i
+ TB DTB
i
+ i, (13)
where Assetsi denotes the sum of assets of bank i and DSB
i (DCB
i , DTB
i ) is a dummy for savings
banks (cooperative banks, trading book institutions). Table 5 shows the results.
The coecients imply that the bias is independent of the bank size but depends on the
banking group and whether the bank has a trading book. The positive sign of the dummies for
the banking group suggests that  as we overestimate the interest rate risk for all investigated
subgroups on average (not reported here)  the overestimation is less severe for savings banks
and cooperative banks than for private commercial banks. This implies that the eect of the
simplifying assumptions, discussed in Section 4.3, is more severe for the latter banks. One specic
reason could be o-balance activities. The more a bank uses derivatives to decrease (increase)
the interest rate risk, the more (less) we overestimate the risk as the TAM does not consider
derivatives. So our results could indicate that private commercial banks use interest derivatives

for hedging purposes to a higher extent than the other banks. Analogously, the positive sign
of the trading book dummy implies that the overestimation is less pronounced for trading book
institutions. However, we would have expected a negative sign of the dummy, as our approach
includes the on-balance positions of the banking and the trading book, whereas the IRRS only
captures the banking book (including o-balance positions). On the other hand, trading book
institutions may assume a higher level of interest rate risk via derivatives, because once a stress
situation occurs they can more quickly alter their exposure to interest rate risk via capital market
transactions. When doing so, there are regulatory incentives to take the interest rate risk rather
in the banking book than in the trading book (e.g. Jones, 2000). This could be done by `hedging'
the on-balance positions on the liability side of the banking book via derivatives. The resulting
eect would be captured by the IRRS but not by the TAM which would reduce the overestimation
and hence would explain the sign of the dummy.

size turns out to be signicantly positive, i.e. we nd evidence that there is a positive correlation
between size and interest rate risk which supports Hypothesis 2.
Result 2 There is strong evidence that bigger banks have a higher level of interest rate risk than
smaller banks.
Interestingly, the trading book dummy is also positive. This is consistent with the consid-
eration from above and from Section 2 that banks that can alter their exposure more quickly
through capital market transactions tend to assume a higher level of interest rate risk.
Result 2 seems to contradict the results of the stress test among German banks, where 
based on a sample of 25 banks  medium-sized and smaller banks turn out to have a higher level
of interest rate risk than commercial banks and central institutions (See Deutsche Bundesbank,
2006a). However, we nd evidence that the dierence of interest rate risk quantied within the
stress test is rather attributable to the banking group than to size as the analyzed subgroup
`medium-sized and smaller banks' mainly consists of savings banks and cooperative banks. The
coecients of the respective dummies in our empirical analysis are both highly signicantly
positive and they are economically relevant: More precisely, the interest rate risk of savings
banks and cooperative banks is higher than that of the remaining banks and the dierence is
about 0.12 and 0.15, respectively. These dierences are more important than the eect due to
size: A doubling of a bank's total assets increases the interest rate risk by 0.004 on average. This
24
nding is in line with the Hypothesis 3.
Result 3 There is strong evidence that the interest rate risk diers between banks of dierent
banking groups and that the interest rate risk of savings banks and cooperative banks is higher
than that of the remaining banks.
5 Conclusion
In this paper we developed a model to quantify the interest rate risk of banks using time series
of accounting-based data. The framework is exible enough to include dierent data sources and
to capture the standardized reporting framework suggested by the Basel Committee on Banking
Supervision (2004b) and dierent actual reporting practices like in the US and in Germany.
Further, we examined  for the rst time  the interest rate risk of the German universal banking
system on an individual bank level and analyzed its determinants.
Based on a subsample of German banks to whose internally quantied interest rate risk we
have access via a unique interest rate risk survey conducted by the Deutsche Bundesbank and
BaFin, we could evaluate our model results. In line with earlier models and studies we found
that our accounting-based approach produces biased estimates of the interest rate risk of banks,
which is attributed to some simplifying assumptions. However, we found convincing evidence
that our model is able to explain the cross-sectional variation of banks' interest rate risk better
than a benchmark model that relies on assumptions similar to models proposed in the literature
and applied by banking supervisors. We controlled for the bias and analyzed factors that aect
the level of interest rate risk of German banks. We found strong evidence that bigger banks have
a higher level of interest rate risk than smaller banks. Further, we found good evidence that the
interest rate risk diers among banks of dierent banking groups. Savings banks and cooperative
banks have a higher level of interest rate risk than private commercial banks. Lastly, there are
structural dierences between trading book and non-trading book institutions.
Banks may also have incentives to alter their exposure depending on the magnitude and
volatility of interest rates. Within our sample period, the term structure of interest rates was
quite stable in Germany. As a structural break in the data at the end of 1998 bars us from
25
going further back in time, an analysis of the time variability of interest rate risk in the German
banking system must be left for future research.

Appendix A Specication of the Objective Function
The objective function that is to be minimized F() = FA()+FL() consists of two functions FA()
and FL() that are related to the asset and the liability side, respectively. Since the asset and the
liability sides are treated analogously, we only present the denition of FA() here:

The deviational variables dassets,t,rtm and dassets,t,itm correspond to the remaining time to ma-
turity and the initial maturity, respectively. The rst part of dassets,t,rtm (dassets,t,itm) denotes
the outstanding amount with a remaining time to maturity rtm (initial maturity itm) at the
reference date 0 in relation to the complete outstanding amount. The second part denotes
the respective fraction at the observation dates t  Tobs = {-83/12, -82/12, ..., 0}. As de-
scribed in Section 4.2, the initial maturity tend - tbeg of business Xpos,tbeg,tend is restricted to
27
ITM = {1/12, ..., 6/12, 9/12, ..., 24/12, 30/12, ..., 60/12, 72/12, ..., 120/12}. To improve numeri-
cal eciency of the optimization procedure, we additionally reduce the number of deviational
variables: we do not include the deviational variable dassets,t,rtm for any possible remaining time
to maturity rtm, but only consider rtm  RTM = {1/12, 2/12, ..., 6/12, 18/12, ..., 120/12} in
the objective function.

19Several robustness checks showed that this simplication does not aect our results.

Appendix B Comparison of the Models' Accuracy
Let 1 and 2 with E(j) = 0, j = 1, 2, be the error terms of two regressions with the same
dependent variable y. Let R2
j denote the respective coecient of determination and j the
standard deviation of the respective error term. Since we have by denition R2
j
= 1 - 2
j
var(y) ,
testing the equality of the R2
j is equivalent to testing the equality of the j.
The error terms can, but need not be, uncorrelated. The covariance between the two errors is
given by 12. Note the following regression:
1 = w(1 - 2) + . (B.1)
As the j have an expectation of zero, there is no intercept in the regression. The regression
coecient w is calculated as
w =
cov(1, 1 - 2)
var(1 - 2)
=
2
1
- 12
2
1
+ 2
2
- 212
.
Minor manipulation shows that the following relation holds:
w 1
2
 1 2.
Therefore, testing the equality of the coecients of determination is equivalent to running the
OLS regression (B.1) and then carrying out the t-test if w equals
1
2 .
