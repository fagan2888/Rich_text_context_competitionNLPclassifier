Introduction
Often collaborative remembering in everyday environments
(e.g., around the dinner table) is supported by the social and
material environment in which the specific activity unfolds
(Sutton, Harris, Keil, & Barnier, 2010). Conversations are
one way in which social groups develop shared memories of
the past (Harris, Keil, Sutton, Barnier, & McIlwain, 2011).
From a multimodal and ecological perspective, analyzing
activities of conversational remembering in real-world con-
texts involves paying particular attention to the central role
that linguistic, embodied, and material resources have in
shaping those activities (Bietti, 2012b; Bietti & Galiana
Castelló, 2013). However, so far, little attention has been
paid to the influence that the interplay of multiple behavioral
channels have in collaborative remembering in small groups.
Several studies in cognitive psychology (e.g., Harris
et al., 2011) and discourse analysis (e.g., Bietti 2010, 2012a)
have examined the central role that certain types of linguistic
expressions (e.g., disagreements and corrections) have in
facilitating the construction of shared memories in small
groups in experimental and natural settings. Nevertheless,
little attention has been paid to ways in which questions
structure the joint activities of collaborative remembering. In
conversations about past experiences, often questions are lin-
guistic expressions used to make requests for information
about the events being jointly recalled. Levinson (2012)
argues that "one of the most prominent differences between
questions and assertions is the obligation to respond" (p. 16).
Hence, in activities of collaborative remembering, questions
tend to act as reminders that provide dynamicity and struc-
ture to the group interaction.
The aim of this exploratory study is to show the central
role that questions have as embodied and interactive tools for
collaborative remembering in two small group multimodal
interactions in natural settings.
Socially Situated and Distributed
Remembering
In collaborative activities in everyday life settings (e.g. din-
ner table, classrooms and workplace), the material environ-
ments for reasoning, problem solving, and creativity are
highly organized, and thus, they also enhance remembering
and more general cognitive performances. These material
environments have a high level of physical cues and this fos-
ters the successful resolution of cognitive tasks. In those

Reminders as Interactive and Embodied
Tools for Socially Distributed and Situated
Remembering
Lucas M Bietti1
Abstract
Current approaches to socially distributed remembering maintain that remembering is a fluid action coordinating minds,
bodies, and the physical and the social world to accomplish particular goals. That is, the act of remembering is always an
active reconstruction of the past in the present. How this act of remembering unfolds is highly dynamic and malleable and is
contingent on the means by which the recollection is communicated and the social and material environments in which these
processes unfold. These communicative acts of remembering are always embodied, multimodal, and interactive. However,
so far, little attention has been paid to the influence that the interplay of multiple behavioral channels have in collaborative
remembering in small groups. The aim of this exploratory study is to demonstrate the central role that questions have as
embodied and interactive tools for collaborative remembering in two small group multimodal interactions in natural settings.
This study suggests that questions acting as a reminder in multimodal activities of collaborative remembering foster the
formation of specific types of interactional sequences with their own temporal dynamics.

activities in which collaboration in social and material envi-
ronments facilitates the successful realization of cognitive
tasks, cognitive processes should no longer be simply char-
acterized purely at an abstract, brain-bound, information-
processing level, but as interacting networks, which integrate
and synchronize the brain, the body, and the world in a func-
tional and goal-oriented manner (e.g., Hutchins, 1995, 2010;
Malafouris, 2008). Cognitive processes such as remembering
in these environments do just occur in the brains of individ-
ual, rather in distributed cognitive systems formed by multi-
ple processing units (Hutchins, 1995; Sutton et al., 2010).
Donald (2010) uses the distinction between "engrams"
(Ogden & Richards, 1956) and "exograms" (Donald, 1991)
to explain how the storage capacity of biological memory
systems became enhanced throughout human cultural evolu-
tion. "Engrams" are mental impressions caused by memory
traces in the human mind, which are the residual trace of an
adaptation made by the organism in response to a stimulus
(Ogden & Richards, 1956, p. 53). "Exograms" are defined as
external symbolic devices linked to the present context of
remembering that allow us to extend and enhance our bio-
memory systems. Donald argues that "exograms" enable
human beings to manipulate complex representations by sig-
nificantly augmenting the capacity of working memory. In
this way, non-biological memory storage (e.g., photographs)
together with the bio-memory systems create the conditions
for the emergence of distributed hybrid networks formed by
the interwoven neural capacities and external memory
devices (Sutton et al., 2010).
Experimental studies in cognitive psychology (Hirst &
Echterhoff, 2012) sustain the view that examining conversa-
tions about past experiences is one of the most useful mecha-
nisms for exploring how memory spreads across different
groups. Hirst & Echterhoff (2008) argued the unreliability
and malleability of human memory (unlike computer mem-
ory) "creates the opportunity for speakers to reshape both
listeners' memories and their own" (Hirst & Echterhoff,
2008, p. 209).As collective memories are commonly formed,
shared, consolidated, and transformed in conversations, sev-
eral studies (Echterhoff, 2010; Echterhoff, Higgins, Kopietz,
& Groll, 2008) have investigated how different cognitive,
linguistic, and interactive phenomena influence processes of
collective memory making.
Experimental research in socially distributed remember-
ing in cognitive psychology (Harris et al., 2011) supports the
view that collaboration between members of dyads may
facilitate recall. These studies have been largely based on an
important research program in transactive memory in cogni-
tive psychology (Wegner, Erber, & Raymond, 1991), philo-
sophical psychology (Theiner, 2013), organizational and
communication sciences (e.g., Hollingshead, 1998) as well
as the learning sciences (Jackson & Moreland, 2009). These
studies suggest that the constitution of transactive memory
systems relies on the fact that some groups have the ability to
develop an implicit distribution of cognitive labor whereby
each member assumes responsibility for learning informa-
tion within his or her own domain of expertise. Each group
member also expects others to learn information about other
relevant domains and assume accountability for that.
However, understanding the communication and dynam-
ics is only part of the story in understanding how and when
individuals and groups remember the past. For example,
naturalistic studies from cognitive and ethnographic perspec-
tives in cognitive science (Bietti & Galiana Castelló, 2013;
Bietti, Kok, & Cienki, 2013; Dahlbäck, Kristiansson, &
Stjernberg, 2013) and computer science (Wu, Birnholtz,
Richards, Baecker, & Massimi, 2008) have demonstrated
how the actual context in which the remembering occurs is
crucial in understanding the ways in which people construct
and communicate their memories.
Questions as Reminders
Reminders are extremely important in sharing memories
within social groups when their knowledge of the past is dis-
tributed among group members. In conversations, reminders
are often realized by questions aimed at seeking information
from someone who is assumed to know about events that
occurred in the past. The use of questions as reminders, such
as "Do you remember when. . .?" to bring a shared past into
the present for the sake of a specific goal (e.g., to create a
feeling of connection between parents and children) makes
evident that we are dealing with joint past experience.
Moreover, reminders function to facilitate the recon-
struction of shared past experiences among members of
groups by means of collaborative facilitation mechanisms
(Harris et al., 2011). They may also act as interactive com-
municative devices that trigger the generation of "new"
memories. These new memories can be strategically con-
structed in accordance with interactional goals, such as to
reach consensus among group members (Bietti, 2012a).
Thus, using questions as reminders has been shown to act as
an important scaffold in joint and collaborative remember-
ing activities. The results of several studies on collaborative
storytelling among couples in which one spouse had been
diagnosed with Alzheimer Disease (AD; Hydén, 2011;
Hydén & Örulv, 2009) have shown that reminders allow the
person with AD "to continue as an active participant and
storyteller by making further contributions to the ongoing
storytelling" (Hydén, 2011, p. 342).
The Current Study
In this study, the role that questions had in activities of
socially distributed and situated remembering were exam-
ined in two small groups where collaborative recall was also
supported by external resources (e.g., pictures) the partici-
pants had brought along to the group interactions. One group
consisted of family members and the other of close friends.
The particular pragmatic function (Heritage, 2002; Stivers,
Bietti 3
2010) of each question acting as a reminder in the collabora-
tive recalling activity among friends and family members
will be explored. Participants were all native speakers of
Spanish.
The selection of questions acting as reminders will be
based on the coding scheme for question-response sequences
in conversation that was developed by Stivers and Enfield
(2010). Their coding scheme is empirically grounded in a
comparative project on question-response sequences in ordi-
nary conversation in 10 languages (Stivers, Enfield, &
Levinson, 2010). Despite the fact that data of this study are
in Spanish, which was not 1 of 10 languages covered by this
project on questions-response in ordinary conversation, their
basic differentiation between Polar Questions, Content (Q-)
Questions, and Alternative Questions is in line with what has
been proposed for Spanish from semantic and pragmatic per-
spectives (e.g., Escandell-Vidal, 1999).
From this coding scheme (Stivers & Enfield, 2010), the
basic differentiation was taken between Content (Q-word)
Questions (e.g., What did you eat for breakfast?), Polar
Questions (e.g., Did you go to the movies yesterday?), and
Alternative Questions (e.g., Are we going for a walk or do
you prefer to stay at home?).
Particular attention will be paid to the central role that
reminders play in the formation of adjacency pairs (e.g.,
Sacks, Schegloff, & Jefferson, 1974; Schegloff, 2007) that
are triggered by the obligation to response put forward by
questions. An adjacency pair is composed of two turns, and
each turn has to come from a different speaker and be of a
different type of utterance. Adjacency pairs lead to the con-
struction of interactional spaces (Mondada, 2009).According
to Mondada (2009), interactional spaces are actively and
constantly shaped and sustained by the participants' bodies,
glances, and gestures during the interaction. Hence, these co-
constructed interactional spaces play a central role in guiding
mutual attention and reciprocity.
The jointly and dynamic construction of interactional
spaces creates the conditions for the emergence of alignment
mechanisms (Pickering & Garrod, 2004) among group mem-
bers. Alignment mechanisms are guided by cases of dialogic
syntax given by structural similarities between immediately
co-present linguistic segments in a broader conversational
context (Du Bois, 2010).
In relation to cases of dialogic syntax, several studies on
naturally occurring interaction in conversation analysis
(Ford, Fox, & Thompson, 2002; Lerner, 1991, 2004; Sacks
et al., 1974) as well as in experimental settings in psycholin-
guistics and cognitive psychology (Allen, Haywood,
Rajendran, & Branigan, 2011; Fusaroli et al., 2012) have
shown the ways in which interlocutors collaboratively and
cooperatively co-construct utterances in conversations. This
phenomenon may occur by simply repeating and reusing
each others' lexical items and syntactic structures and/or
latching onto the other person's turn and completing it with-
out pausing. The collaborative turn sequences are cases in
which "not only a collaboration of two speakers produces a
single syntactic unit [. . .] but also in which the first speaker
ratifies its completion after its occurrence" (Lerner, 2004,
pp. 229-230).
In addition, the analysis will determine to what extent
these reminders interplay with co-verbal resources such as
manual gestures (e.g., pointing and metaphorical gesture),
laughter, and changes in gaze direction. As the participants of
this study were not only interacting with each other but also
with pictures related to the events that they were collabora-
tively remembering, significant occurrences of pointing ges-
tures were considered as directing-to actions (Clark, 2003)
toward the pictures being discussed. By directing-to, we refer
to an action in which "speakers try to move the addressees'
attention to the object" (Clark, 2003, p. 248). Metaphorical
gestures refer to the type of manual gesture that has the
potential to engage an active cross-domain mapping--that is,
the cognitive process of understanding something in terms of
something else (Cienki & Müller, 2008).
Changes in the direction of gaze toward the recipients of
questions acting as reminders will also played an important
role in the analyses. This type of behavior is considered as
embodied resource for mobilizing response reinforcing the
accountability of recipient to respond to the reminders
(Rossano, Brown, & Levinson, 2009; Stivers et al., 2010;
Stivers & Rossano, 2012). Several scholars (Goodwin, 1987,
1994; Kendon, 1990) have documented the regulatory func-
tion of the speakers' gazes in social interactions. Moreover,
in experimental settings, it has been shown that "the listener
tended to respond when the speakers looked at him or her"
(Bavelas, Coates, & Johnson, 2002, p. 576) providing com-
pelling evidence that collaborative activities in face-to-face
interaction are not only driven by verbal resources.
These are succinct definitions of the type of questions
used in this study.
Content (Q-word) Questions
Content (Q-word) questions include interrogative pronouns
such as: qué/what; cuál/which; quién/who; dónde/where;
cómo/how; cuánto/how much. They can be followed by noun
phrases, which form a syntactic constituent. These types of
questions are used to request information that has not been
previously mentioned in a communicative interaction.
Polar Questions
Polar questions imply an affirmative or negative reply and
therefore they are also called absolute yes/no questions. They
can be accompanied by a finite verb, a negative adverb,
adverb of frequency, a clitic, or a subject.
Alternative Questions
Alternative questions offer a choice between at least two
alternative answers. Each of the alternatives in the question
is stressed. In Spanish, any positive polar question can be

turned into an alternative question by adding "o"/or and the
negative tag "no"/not.
As the analysis will be focused on the key role that direct
questions play in triggering processes of conversational and
collaborative remembering in Spanish, it is important to
point out the distinction that Spanish grammar makes
between direct and indirect interrogatives. Spanish grammar
(among many others) makes a distinction between direct and
indirect speech. On one hand, by direct speech we refer to
instances in which "the writer or the speaker textually repro-
duces what the speaker has directly expressed in their own
words" (RAE, 1973, p. 516). On the other hand, instances of
indirect speech are cases in which "the narrator refers to what
the speaker, or the other person, has said" (RAE, 1973, p.
516). This distinction also applies to the interrogatives, and
therefore we speak about direct and indirect questions. In
other words, in direct speech the verbal communication is
reproduced exactly. Verbs have the same subject, "I" and
"you," as when spoken by the speaker (Milner, 1973, p. 38).
In contrast, indirect questions are cases in which verbs of
saying and understanding (to say, ask, warn, tell, etc.) play a
central role (e.g., el me preguntó si sabía quién había sido el
responsable/he asked me if I knew who was responsible).
Moreover, in indirect questions the interrogative tone disap-
pears, as does the question mark in writing (Gili Gaya, 1961).
Method
Participants
Two groups of four participants were recruited for this study
via the researcher's social networks in Argentina. One con-
sisted of close friends (aged 21-23), the other of family mem-
bers (parents aged 57 and 63, and children aged 30 and 32).
Both groups had gone through a shared event together (e.g.,
a vacation) and had carried along a set of pictures related to
that event. All were native Spanish speakers.
Procedure and Data Collection
The data were collected betweenAugust and October 2011 in
Buenos Aires. Two group conversations were recorded in the
homes of one of the participants of each group. Participants
were asked to recollect memories based on the pictures they
had brought along. The conversation among family members
was about a trip to Maui, Hawaii, that they had made together
to attend the wedding of the parents'daughter. The conversa-
tion among the friends was about a 2-week summer vacation
that they had spent together in a summer resort by the sea-
side. The interventions of the research assistant were mini-
mal, merely functioning to invoke continuation of the
conversation. The conversations were recorded with two
digital video cameras placed in different corners of the room
(Canon LEGRIA HF M46 and Sony Mobile HD Snap
Camera MHS-TS20).
Coding
The audio and video recordings were transcribed in detail
using two specialized software programs (Inqscribe and
ChronoviZ). The overall length of the recordings was 14.54
min for the family, and 22.08 min for the friends. Video and
audio recordings of both focus groups were coded for a wide
range of co-verbal behaviors, divided into three categories:
(a) manual gestures, (b) non-manual gestures, and (c) pos-
tural behaviors. The minimum unit of time used for coding of
the video and audio recording was 500 ms. For all time
points, a binary value was assigned to each behavior for each
participant, indicating whether he or she performed that
behavior at that particular moment in time. Audio recordings
were transcribed following the Jefferson Transcription
System (Jefferson, 2004).
Analysis
A total number of 104 direct questions were found in the
data, 57 questions in the group consisting of close friends
and 47 in the group formed by family members. The larger
number of questions found in the friends data may be related
to the fact that that group session was 7.14 min longer than
the family one. For both groups, the following charts show:
(a) the percentage of questions acting as reminders, (b) the
distribution of questions acting as reminders among the four
participants of the group and the interviewer, and (c) how
these reminders are distributed across the different types of
questions described above (Content (Q-) Questions; Polar
Questions and Alternative Questions).
As Figure 1, 84% (friends) and 74% (family) of the ques-
tions were cases of questions acting as reminders. Within
16% (friends) and 26% (family) under the category "other,"
we included uses of questions related to the organization of
the specific task (e.g., clarification questions to the inter-
viewer) but not to the activity of collaborative remembering.
This finding demonstrates the importance of reminders in
this group interaction and provides analytical validity to the
focus of inquiry. Figure 2 illustrates the distribution of
Bietti 5
questions acting as reminders among friends and family
members. It also shows to what extent the interviewer was
involved in the dynamics of the group interactions.
Figure 3 provides information regarding the type of ques-
tions found in the two groups interactions, based on Stivers
and Enfield's coding scheme (Stivers & Enfield, 2010). The
questions acting as reminders made by the interviewer were
excluded from this chart.
For the qualitative and multimodal analysis we selected
an interactional sequence initiated by each of the question
types acting as a reminder listed in Figure 3. There were
not instances of alternative questions in the family data.
Hence, the section focused on the qualitative and multi-
modal analysis of the family interaction only includes two
examples instead of three. Within 11 percent (friends) and
19 percent (family) under the category "other" we included
cases of Elliptical Content Q-word and Elliptical Polar
Questions (e.g., ¿y ésta?/and this?, and ¿no?/right?) that
were related to the activity of collaborative remembering.
However, as the identification of these cases of elliptical
questions can be quite arbitrary without a proper phono-
logical analysis, which is beyond the scope of this study, it
was decided not to select them for the qualitative and mul-
timodal analysis.
The order for presenting the examples was determined by
the time of the interaction itself. Multimodal annotations on
the transcripts and still images were made using the follow-
ing coding scheme: (a) yellow circles in the transcripts and
on the still images to indicate pointing, metaphorical ges-
tures, facial expressions and touching the pictures; (b) red
circles in the transcript to indicate when a change in the
direction of eye-gaze occurs; (c) red arrows on the still
images to approximately show where the participants are
gazing; and (d) blue circles in the transcript to indicate
instances of phrasal repetition across speakers.
A chart for each of the interactional sequences analyzed
was included next to the still images to show the temporal
dynamics of relevant co-verbal behaviors.
Case 1: Friends
Content (Q-word) questions.In this interactional sequence
(Figure 4), the group of friends is trying to jointly identify
who was missing. Augusto asked the question and he asks
who took the picture that they are talking about.
From Line 1 we note how Augusto's Content (Q-word)
Question operates as a reminder within the interaction and
establishes a shared goal, that is, to remember who was
missing in the picture being used to remember what they
were doing in that specific situation. However, to find out
which of the friends were missing in the photograph also
entails jogging their memories as to who the author of the
picture was. It is important to point out that Augusto refor-
mulates the reminder in Line 1, a few lines below (L. 5), and
thus, he makes clear that his goal is not only to remember
who was missing, but rather to recall who had taken the pic-
ture. Augusto's question in Line 1 makes the four partici-
pants lean forward. While leaning forward, Tommy also
takes the picture in question to take a closer look (pic. a).
Interestingly, Augusto's questions acting as reminders (L. 1
and 5) do not only provoke the participants to lean forward
and focus their visual attention on the picture but also seem
to trigger the formation of similar postural behaviors as they
all try to answer the question (chin-rest, b, and Figure 5
[3,500-10,500ms]).
Subsequently, in Line 8 when Santi answers the question
regarding who took the picture, Augusto changes the direc-
tion he is looking toward him (L. 8, red circle, pic. b). At that
point, it is when Augusto, Tommy, and Santi lean back and
they all laugh simultaneously (pic. c, L. 9, Figure 5 [11,500-
18,500 ms]). What is so funny about the situation is that it
was Augusto who had actually taken that picture.
Throughout the entire interactional sequence initiated by
Augusto's reminders (L.1 and 5), it is possible to observe the
ways in which instances of dialogic syntax based on the rep-
etition of syntactic structures and lexical items constitute the
basis for the emergence of spiral effects that linguistically

6 SAGE Open
shape processes of socially situated and distributed remem-
bering (e.g., "era de día"/it was daylight, L. 2-3; and ¿quién
sacó la foto?/who took the picture, L. 5-6).
Polar questions. The theme of the next interactional sequence
(Figure 6) is related to the identities and descriptions of
the people who attended one of the parties that they had

organized at the house where they were staying during the
summer vacations.
In the first Line 1, Tommy uses a Polar Question to ask
whether the events depicted in the picture they are looking at,
and jointly remembering through it, took place at the house
where they were staying during the summer vacations. While
Tommy formulates the question pragmatically acting as a
reminder, he also leans forward to take hold of the specific
picture (pic. d). Tommy's leaning forward and attempt to the
take the picture are temporally coordinated with Augusto's
pointing at the photograph (pic. d, pic. e, and pic. f). This
temporal synchronization is reflected in the temporal dynam-
ics of co-verbal behaviors that is shown in Figure 7 (1,000
ms onward).
Figure 6. Polar Question (Friends).

8 SAGE Open
Although Tommy's question does not seem to trigger the
formation of an adjacency pair, it does lead to the initiation
of interactional sequence in which the four participants are
engaged in remembering who attended the party that they are
describing. In Lines 3 and 5, Augusto introduces a new
character in the reconstruction of the events. After Nacho's
agreement in the next line, we observe how a process of lexi-
cal alignment between Augusto and Santi ("Mitch," blue
circles, L. 4, 6-7) operates to interactionally and linguisti-
cally ground the shared activity of remembering together
who else was there with them. Interestingly, the process of
lexical alignment between Augusto and Santi is also
embodily manifested in a change in the direction of Santi's
gaze (pic. e, Figure 7 [8,500 ms]).
In Line 8, Santi continues with the description of
"Mitch" and introduces a new character in the events
while he still looks at Augusto. It is at this point when
Tommy changes his gaze toward Santi (red circle, L. 9).
While they are looking at each other (pic. e), we can notice
the formation of a collaborative turn sequence. Santi's
ratification of Tommy's collaborative completion appears
in Line 12 "Flor/Flor." Moreover during the time they are
looking at each other (pic. f), collaborative remembering
between Santi and Tommy is behaviorally grounded in
instances of lexical alignment (e.g., "Flor"/Flor, and "la
gorda"/the fatty).
Alternative questions. In the following interactional sequence
(Figure 8), one of the participants tries to find out if other

Figure 9. Temporal dynamics: Alternative Question (Friends).
Bietti 9
members of the group had made an attempt to get off with a
girl that was with them at a party.
Tommy's Alternative Question in Line 1 initiates the
interactional sequence and triggers the formation of an
adjacency pair between Santi and himself (L. 1-2). Tommy's
change in gaze direction toward Santi operates as an
embodied resource aimed at mobilizing response from the
person who is asked the question. At the time when Santi
responds to Tommy's question, Augusto and Nacho change
the focus of their visual attention from the picture that it is
being discussed to him (red circle, L.2, Figure 9 [1,500
ms]). However, Augusto and Nacho are not the only partici-
pants who reorient their behavior while Santi respond to
Tommy's Alternative Q. As we can notice, almost at the
time when Santi is finalizing his utterance "no estaba"/she
wasn't there (red circle, L. 2), Tommy changes his focus of
visual attention again to the picture in which the girl who
they are talking about is depicted, as in an attempt to check
if the girl was as pretty as Santi describes her. Such multi-
ple reorientations of behaviors are also reflected in (h), and
in the temporal dynamics of co-verbal behaviors that it is
described in Figure 9 (2,000-4,000 ms).
In Line 5, Augusto also changes his gaze direction toward
Tommy when he explains to him that he did not make an
attempt to get off with that girl either (red circle, pic. i).
Augusto's intervention makes Tommy and himself laugh
about the situation (Figure 9 [4,500-5,500 ms]).
The interactional sequence triggered by Tommy's
reminder in Line 1 is linguistically structured by the repeti-
tion and reuse of lexical items ("estaba"/was there; and
"agarraste"­"no agarré"/you had her--I didn't have her) that
serve to linguistically ground the shared activity of collab-
orative remembering.
Case 2: Family
Content (Q-word) questions.In this interactional sequence
(Figure 10), Dolores and Diego are collaboratively remem-
bering how they were feeling on their arrival in Maui from
Buenos Aires. A picture of their arrival externally supports
this joint activity.
In the first line, Marta asks a question (pic. a) to the inter-
viewer regarding whether they (family members) should
expect to answer questions made by the interviewer or
Figure 10. Content (Q-word) Question (Family).
10 SAGE Open
simply engaged in conversation among themselves. The
answer to this clarification question comes in Line 4.
Nonetheless, Marta's embodied request for clarification (yel-
low circle, L. 1), which integrates multimodal resources
(speech, pointing, and gaze), concerning the nature of the
activity does not interfere with the interaction between
Dolores and Diegui. The adjacency pair opened by Dolores
by means of the Content (Q-word) Question (L.2), acting as
a reminder, initiates a sequence of laughter between her and
Diegui, her husband. In this case, laugher is an embodied
action (Vöge & Wagner, 2010; Zayts & Schnurr, 2011)
locally produced by Dolores (L.2) to foster an affiliation and
alliance with Diegui who returns the laughter, and in doing
so, behaviorally aligns with his wife (blue circles, L 2-10,
Figure 11 [500-13,500 ms]).
Dolores' and Diegui's alignment generated and mediated
by simultaneous and sequential laughing is further supported
by instances of linguistic alignment that are illustrated in the
repetition and reuse of lexical items and syntactic structures
(blue circles, L. 2, 9, 11-13). Moreover, Dolores'gaze toward
Diegui while formulating both questions (L.2 pic. a) operates
as a resource for mobilizing response. Thus, Dolores makes
more pressure to Diego to respond to her question acting as a
reminder regarding how he was feeling on arrival in Maui.
In the second element of the adjacency pair initiated by
Dolores (L.2), Diegui uses a pointing gesture (pic. b) to
refer to the picture that they are talking about (yellow circle,
L.9, Figure 11 [8,500-9,500 ms]). In doing so, he creates a
common ground (Clark, 1996) between him and Dolores, as
well as, among the four participants who change the direc-
tion of eye-gaze toward the specific picture. Diegui's point-
ing gesture is a directing-to action by moving not only
Dolores but also Marta and Diego's visual attention to the
particular photograph (pic. b). This photograph works as an
external resource for grounding collaborative remembering
between Dolores and Diegui until the long pause (2.8) in the
penultimate turn of the interactional sequence (L. 12).
During that long pause, Diegui makes a facial expression
(eyebrow-flash) showing hesitation regarding Dolores'
account of how they were feeling on arrival (yellow circle,
L.12, pic. d, Figure 11 [17,500 ms]). That is precisely when
Dolores gazes Diegui (red circle, L. 12, pic. d), and thereby,
the picture no longer acts as an external resource for ground-
ing the remembering activity. Interestingly, after Diegui's
facial expression, Dolores reformulates her account. Finally,
Diegui agrees with such reformulation (L.13).
Polar questions. In the following interactional sequence (Fig-
ure 12), Diegui and Marta are trying to locate in chronologi-
cal time one of the pictures that they brought in for the focus
group session.
The interactional sequence begins with Diegui's Polar
Question in Line 1. In the element of the following question-
response adjacency pair (L.5-6), Marta uses a circular meta-
phorical gesture (yellow circle, L. 6, pic. h, Figure 13
[6,000-6,500 ms]) by moving her right hand wrist to repre-
sent the passage of time while suggesting the possibility that
the events that the particular photograph are depicting
occurred the third day after arrival, not the second as she
previously claimed (yellow circle, L. 4, pic. f, Figure 13
[4,500 ms]). The last question-response adjacency pair is
completed by another manual gesture made by Marta (yel-
low circle, L. 8, pic. I, Figure 13 [7,000-7,500 ms]). Marta
uses a pointing gesture to refer to another picture in the photo
album that seems to be thematically related to the one that
they were using for grounding the collaborative activity of
shared remembering. Thus, she makes an attempt to exter-
nally ground her arguments concerning the order of the pic-
tures (and events) in time.
Diegui's and Marta's collaborative behavior is also sup-
ported by instances of lexical alignment: "foto"/picture, "esa
foto"/that picture (blue circles, L.1-2, 8), and "otro día"/
another day (blue circles, L.4-6). As the interactional
sequence shows, there is a clear coordination between these
cases of lexical alignment and the manual gestures described
above (pointing and metaphorical gesture).

Discussion
The quantitative analysis has indicated that a significant per-
centage of the total number of questions formulated in both
sessions made a pragmatic contribution: They played the role
of reminders in the multimodal interactions between friends
and family members. This finding shows the central role that
questions acting as reminders had for socially situated and
distributed remembering in the two groups'naturalistic inter-
actions by providing the interactional and linguistic architec-
ture for the entire activity.
The aim of selecting only three types of questions (Content
(Q-Word) Questions, Polar Questions, and Alternative
Questions) from the data for the subsequent qualitative anal-
yses was to provide an in-depth view of the ways in which
these reminders actually work in multimodal and interac-
tional settings. At a linguistic and conversational level,
reminders tend to open question-response adjacency pairs
(Stivers et al., 2010). These question-response pairs along
with the multiple cases syntactic and lexical alignment oper-
ated as mechanisms providing structure for the activity of
shared remembering, as well as key elements in the jointly
and dynamically creation of common ground among group
members. However, the collaborative creation of a common
ground, on which the shared activity of conversational
remembering was built, could not be fully understood if we
only considered the behavioral level. Several examples have
demonstrated how participants do not only mechanically
mirror each others'behaviors. It goes further: There are cases
in which the collaborative co-construction of utterances

(Ford et al., 2002; Lerner, 1991, 2004) reflects situations in
which they seemed to be actually sharing individual memo-
ries of the events experienced together as groups. This find-
ing seems to be in accordance with the fact that instances of
lexical and syntactic alignment in conversations seem to
facilitate the construction of shared situation models about
the events that participants in conversation are talking about
(Pickering & Garrod, 2004). On the other hand, with the kind
of qualitative methodology presented in this exploratory
study, it is quite unlikely to demonstrate whether there are
causal relations between the formation of adjacency pairs
together with cases of syntactic and lexical alignment and the
sharing of representations about the events experienced
together. This is a methodological limitation that future stud-
ies from experimental perspectives should strive to
overcome.
At the co-linguistic and multimodal level, reminders
served to reorient group behavior and establish shared focus
of visual attention. Such reorientations of behaviors and new
focuses of visual attention indicate the joint and dynamic
configurations of shared goals (e.g., Tomasello, Carpenter,
Call, Behne, & Moll, 2005). Those shared goals included
cases where participants were trying to remember who the
author of the picture that they were talking about was
(friends, Content (Q-word) Question) to collaborative recall
as to how they were feeling on their arrival in Maui from
Buenos Aires (family, Content (Q-word) Question). At this
point, it is important to highlight the fact that in both groups,
friends and family members were not only interacting with
each other, but also with the pictures they themselves had
taken of the events they were remembering together.
Regarding the interanimations of individual memories
and the external representations supported by material envi-
ronments (e.g., to use tools to solve a specific task), several
studies (Zhang, 1997; Zhang & Wang, 2009) have demon-
strated that the successful coordination of information from
internal representations (e.g., in working memory) and exter-
nal representations plays a critical role by improving prob-
lem-solving performance in activities in which interaction
with external resources called for. The qualitative analyses
have reliably shown that the pictures did operate as artifacts
externally grounding the entire group dynamics. However,
because of the methodological limitations of the study
design, it would not be possible to claim whether the partici-
pants would have remembered less if the pictures were not
there.
The temporal dynamics of the sequential alignment of co-
verbal behaviors among participants (Figures 5, 7, 9, 11, and
13) in each of the interactional sequences initiated by the
reminders suggest that behavioral and cognitive processes in
the group activities were not only distributed across the room
or space but also across a time (Hutchins, 2010, 2011).
When combined and integrated, the examination of the
interplay of conversational with co-verbal resources in the
interactional sequences triggered by the reminders shows
how socially situated and distributed remembering in the two
groups, that unfolded in a macro-time scale, influence inter-
actional behavior over much shorter time-scales (the time
needed to formulate a question). This was reflected in the
significant percentage of total questions that acted as remind-
ers. However, this is not a top-down relationship as the
events occurring in micro-time scales (e.g., formulating
questions) are precisely those kinds of actions that give shape
to the overall high-level cognitive activity of collaborative
remembering within the groups. Thus, and based on the qual-
itative evidence provided, this exploratory study has demon-
strated that socially situated and distributed remembering in
natural environments has to be considered as a bi-directional
collaborative activity, jointly determined by high-level cog-
nitive processes (e.g., collaboratively remembering specific
shared experiences) as well as by more procedural and auto-
matic behaviors (e.g., formation of question­answer adja-
cency pairs, simultaneous and sequential alignment of
co-verbal behaviors).
It is hoped that future studies on collaborative remember-
ing in experimental settings could empirically test the central
role that questions acting as reminders may have on benefit-
ing shared and distributed remembering in small groups.
Thus, it would be possible to unravel the web of multiple
interanimations among a wide range of multimodal behav-
iors unfolding on interdependent time-scales in this kind of
everyday but complex social activities.
