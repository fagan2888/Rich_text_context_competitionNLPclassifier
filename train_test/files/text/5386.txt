Perceiving that dangerous groups of people lurk in your
midst can strain intergroup interactions and relations. When
predominantly White participants in Western countries are
asked to shoot individuals who may carry weapons in com-
puter games, they show a greater bias to shoot at people who
are Black than White (Correll, Park, Judd, & Wittenbrink,
2002), Middle Eastern than White (Unkelbach, Forgas, &
Denson, 2008), wearing Muslim headgear than those not
wearing Muslim headgear (Unkelbach et al., 2008,
Unkelbach, Goldenberg, Müller, Sobbe, & Spannaus, 2009),
and male than female (Plant, Goplen, & Kunstman, 2011).
Thus, when presented with targets from distinct social cate-
gories, people display the greatest shooter bias toward out-
group members and members of the categories stereotyped
as relatively more dangerous. The aim of the present research
was to quantify the extent to which ethnic group membership
and culturally appropriate or inappropriate headgear would
influence perceptions of dangerousness by people living in
the Middle East.
Past research on the shooter bias has exclusively exam-
ined Western cultures (i.e., North America, Western Europe,
and Australia). Consistent with the strong stereotypes that
Black men are dangerous (Devine, 1989), the original shooter
bias research found that both Black and White Americans
displayed a bias to shoot Black targets over White targets
(Correll et al., 2002). Prior research has reliably shown that
perceived danger (in addition to ingroup bias) plays a critical
role in biases to shoot (Correll, Urland, & Ito, 2006; Correll,
Wittenbrink,Park,Judd,&Goyle,2011;Miller,Zielaskowski,
& Plant, 2012). For instance, participants show a greater bias
to shoot targets superimposed on dangerous compared with
safe backgrounds (Correll et al., 2011). Western participants
also show a stronger neural marker of threat (P200) to Black
than White faces in the shooter task (Correll et al., 2006).
Individuals who believe that the world is a dangerous place
even shoot at outgroup members not stereotyped as danger-
ous more than ingroup members (Miller et al., 2012).
Moreover, the shooter bias is not solely attributable to simple
outgroup bias because Black Americans shoot more at Black
than White targets, and men shoot more at male than female
targets (Correll et al., 2002; Kahn & Davies, 2010; Plant
et al., 2011).

Brief Report: Evidence of Ingroup Bias on
the Shooter Task in a Saudi Sample

Abstract
When predominantly White participants in Western countries are asked to shoot individuals in a computer game who may
carry weapons, they show a greater bias to shoot at outgroup members and people stereotyped as dangerous. The goal
was to determine the extent to which shooter biases in the Middle East would vary as a function of target ethnicity and
culturally appropriate or inappropriate headgear. Within a sample of 37 male Saudi Arabian residents, we examined shooter
biases outside of Western nations for the first time. Targets in this task were either White or Middle Eastern in appearance,
and wore either American style baseball caps or a Saudi Arabian style shemagh and igal. Our results replicated the bias to
shoot racial outgroup members observed in Western samples; we found a bias to shoot White over Middle Eastern targets.
Unexpectedly, we also found a bias for Saudi participants to shoot at people wearing culturally appropriate traditional Saudi
headgear over Western style baseball caps. To explain this latter finding, we cautiously speculate that relative perceptions of
dangerousness in the Middle East may be influenced by media exposure and changing social conditions in the region.

Outgroups are often perceived as dangerous (Stephan &
Stephan, 2000). The little attitudinal data from within the
Middle Eastern, Arabic, and Islamic world shows that
Western outgroups are perceived as dangerous. Muslims, and
particularly those Muslims living in non-Western countries,
view people in Western countries as violent (Pew Global
Attitudes Project, 2006). In fact, Muslims are more likely to
view Westerners as violent than Westerners are to view
Muslims as violent (Pew Global Attitudes Project, 2011). In
line with the previously discussed work showing the danger-
ousness basis of shooter biases, we expected that Middle
Eastern participants would show biases to shoot at targets
containing markers of a Western outgroup. In the present
research, two distinct markers were used: race and clothing
(specifically headgear).
We hypothesized that the race bias (Unkelbach et al.,
2008) and headgear bias (Unkelbach et al., 2008; Unkelbach
et al., 2009) typically observed in Western nations toward
Middle Eastern targets would be reversed in a Saudi Arabian
sample. This reversal would be consistent with the percep-
tions of Westerners as dangerous among Muslims in non-
Western countries. More specifically, we hypothesized that
Saudi men would display
1. A relatively greater bias for shooting White targets
over Middle Eastern targets and
2. A relatively greater bias for shooting those wearing
American style baseball caps over those wearing the
culturally appropriate shemagh and igaal.
No interaction was hypothesized. Prediction of an interac-
tion would mean that we believed that the meaning of head-
gear varies by target race (or race by target headgear): While
possible, we saw no reason to make this prediction. Both
race and headgear should exert independent, additive effects
on shooter biases. White race and baseball caps should both
be indicative of the outgroup for Saudi participants and
therefore induce greater shooter biases.
Method
Participants and Design
Forty-four non-White male residents of the Kingdom of
Saudi Arabia participated in the experiment (M
age
= 22.8
years, SD = 1.4) after giving written informed consent. The
study protocols were approved by the department chairman,
who was independent from this research project. Participants
were reimbursed the equivalent of AU$10 for their participa-
tion. An a priori power analysis suggested that 34 partici-
pants were required to provide a target power of .80 to detect
a medium effect (d = .50) with  set at .05 (Faul, Erdfelder,
Lang, & Buchner, 2007). Although power of .80 is conven-
tion, given the rarity of this sample, it was important not to
have a Type 2 error, and as such, it was deemed important to
recruit as many students as possible in the semester: A sam-
ple of 44 participants gives power of .90. Moreover, this
sample size assured power of at least .80 after filtering par-
ticipants. Most of the participants were Middle Eastern
(79.5%), some were Asian (typically Pakistani; 9.1%), one
reported being of more than one race (2.3%), and some did
not report their race (9.1%). Prior large-scale surveys have
shown that 97.0% of the Saudi population is Muslim and that
82.2% view cultural invasion by the West as a serious or very
serious issue (World Values Survey Association, 2005).
Materials and Procedure
Shooter task.The shooter task was based on the computer
game described in Unkelbach et al. (2008) and is similar to
the shooter tasks used in other experiments (Correll et al.,
2002; Kahn & Davies, 2010; Miller et al., 2012; Plant et al.,
2011; Unkelbach et al., 2009). In the shooter task, partici-
pants are asked to shoot if an armed person appears but not if
an unarmed person appears. In the present task, targets
appeared superimposed on one of six randomly selected
locations along the balconies of a three-floor apartment
building. Three target properties were manipulated within-
participants: the presence of a weapon (gun vs. object), target
race (White vs. Middle Eastern), and target headgear (Saudi
Arabian shemagh and igal vs. American baseball cap).
As per Unkelbach et al. (2008), pictures of prison inmates,
sourced from the Florida Department of Correction website
(http://www.dc.state.fl.us), were used to manipulate target
race. The pictures contained the head and neck only (see
Figure 1). Stimuli were 10 men, half of whom were Caucasian
and half of whom were non-Caucasian with darker skin.
There is no Middle Eastern option in the classification sys-
tem used by the Florida Department of Corrections.
Consistent with Middle Eastern origins, the non-Caucasian
targets had been classified as "non-Black" and "non-Asian"
by the website. A sample of 38 participants recruited through
Amazon's mTurk service confirmed each Middle Eastern
and White target was perceived as such. For each Middle
Eastern face, the majority of participants classified them as
of "Arab/Middle Eastern" origin rather than "East Asian/
South Asian," "Indian," "Black/African," or "European/
Caucasian/White" (lowest: 52.63%, highest: 81.58%). Each
White face was classified by the majority of participants as
"European/Caucasian/White" (lowest: 94.74%, highest:
100%). Chi-square goodness of fit tests against chance levels
(i.e., 20% correct, 80% incorrect) indicated that all faces
were recognized as being of the correct race at significantly
above chance levels, 2s (1, N = 38)  25.29, ps < .001.
Superimposed on each face was either a Saudi Arabian
shemagh and igal or anAmerican style baseball cap (depicted
in Figure 1). The shemagh is a traditional Arab headdress
fashioned from a square scarf. The shemagh is held in place
by the igal, which is a black chord that sits atop the head.
Superimposed next to each face was a hand holding either a
Schofield et al. 3
gun (black gun, or silver gun) or a harmless object (black
soft-drink bottle, silver thermos; see Unkelbach et al., 2008).
Participants commenced each trial by pressing the space
bar. After a 300-ms delay, the background of the three-floor
apartment block appeared alone for 600 ms. The target then
appeared, and participants had up to 800 ms to decide
whether to "shoot" or "not shoot." The correct decision was
to shoot suspects carrying guns but not to shoot those carry-
ing objects. Correct decisions scored points, whereas errors
subtracted them. The points were weighted such that shoot-
ing was favorable over not shooting (Correll et al., 2002).
Specifically, correctly shooting an armed target earned 10
points, correctly not shooting an unarmed target earned 5
points, incorrectly shooting an unarmed target deducted 20
points, incorrectly not shooting an armed target deducted 40
points, and being too slow to make a decision deducted 10
points. At the end of each trial, participants were displayed
their current points total.
Participants completed eight practice trials with novel tar-
gets, before completing 20 trials of each Race × Headgear ×
Object type combination.
Statistical Analyses
Signal detection theory has been crucial to understanding the
decision to shoot (Correll, Hudson, Guillermo, & Ma, 2014), as
it allows differences in the respondent's sensitivity to the pres-
ence of a gun and their bias to shoot to be modeled separately.
Without signal detection procedures, it is impossible to tell
whether an individual who successfully shoots at all armed
targets was able to readily discriminate between guns and
objects or simply held a bias to make the decision to shoot.
Individuals who can readily tell apart the guns and objects
are said to be highly sensitive to the presence of a weapon.
High sensitivity emerges when participants readily hit armed
targets and correctly reject the opportunity to shoot unarmed
targets. Sensitivity here is reported as d', with higher scores
indicating a better ability to discriminate guns from objects.
Individuals who do not require a lot of evidence to shoot are
said to have set a low criterion for shooting, that is, they are
biased to shoot. We report bias to shoot via the  parameter,
with lower scores indicating a bias toward shooting and that
less evidence is required for a shoot response.
Measures of d' and  were calculated separately for each
Race × Headgear combination in line with the formulas pub-
lished by Stanislaw and Todorov (1999). Summaries of the
raw hit rates and false alarm rates used to calculate d' and 
are presented in Table 1. Because raw hit rates of 1 and false
alarm rates of 0 need to be adjusted before signal detection
analyses, hit rates of 1 became 1 - (1 / 2n), and false alarm
rates of 0 became 1 / 2n, where n is the number of on-time
responses for that trial type.
For at least one target type, three participants could not
discriminate between guns and objects (i.e., d'  0), sug-
gesting that these participants were unlikely to be respond-
ing based on what the target was carrying. As it is most
likely that these participants were responding indiscrimi-
nately, these three participants were removed from the
analyses. A further four participants scored greater than ±3
SDs from a sample  mean, and hence were outliers. Their
data were removed from the analyses to prevent the undue
influence. None of the reported results change if outlying
scores on  means were winsorized to prevent their undue
influence instead. Final analyses were conducted using 2
(race: White vs. Middle Eastern) × 2 (headgear: shemagh
and igal vs. baseball cap) repeated measures ANOVAs.
The weapon factor was not explicitly included in the
analysis as it is used to calculate the measures of
discrimination and bias.

Results
Shooter Bias
Consistent with Hypothesis 1, participants showed a greater
bias to shoot at White targets than Middle Eastern targets,
F(1, 36) = 4.43, p = .042, p
2 11
= . (Figure 1). Contrary to
Hypothesis 2, participants were also more biased to shoot at
targets wearing the shemagh and igal than targets wearing a
baseball cap, F(1, 36) = 4.48, p = .041, p
2 11
= . . The Target
Race × Headgear interaction was not significant, F(1, 36) =
1.18, p = .284, p
2 03
= . .
Supplementary analyses.The patterns reported above were
internally replicated using (a) a different set of participant
inclusion criteria and (b) reaction times. Overall, the supple-
mentary analyses demonstrate internal consistency across
cut-offs and methods of analysis in the observed response
biases.
A different set of participant inclusion criteria. Rather than
filter outliers and those who could not discriminate guns
from objects, Unkelbach et al. (2008) excluded participants
who failed to respond within the response window more than
20% of the time. Two participants in the present sample met
this exclusion criteria; neither of these individuals was fil-
tered in the original analyses. Under these conditions, there
was a bias to shoot White targets over Middle Eastern tar-
gets, F(1, 41) = 3.26, p = .078, p
2 07
= . , and participants
were more biased to shoot at targets wearing the shemagh
and igal than targets wearing a baseball cap, F(1, 41) = 6.06,
p = .018, p
2 13
= . . There was no interaction, F(1, 41) =
2.03, p = .161, p
2 05
= . .
Reaction times.Faster reaction times indicate a more
accessible decision than longer reaction times (see Correll
et al., 2014). Latency results consistent with the observed
response biases would be either (1) faster hit latencies or (2)
slower correct rejection latencies for (a) White targets than
Middle Eastern targets and (b) the shemagh and igal rather
than baseball caps. All responses made within the response
window were used to calculate participants' mean latencies:
These latencies are reported in Table 2. Given the relative
infrequency of incorrect latencies (i.e., misses and false
alarms), these were not analyzed. Faster hit latencies were
observed for White targets than Middle Eastern targets, F(1,
36) = 3.25, p = .080, p
2 08
= . , but there was no effect of
headgear, F(1, 36) = 2.06, p = .164, p
2 05
= . , and no inter-
action, F(1, 36) = 1.89, p = .171, p
2 05
= . . Slower correct
rejection latencies were observed for targets wearing the
shemagh and igal than baseball caps, F(1, 36) = 4.14, p =
.049, p
2 10
= . , but there was no effect of race, F(1, 36) =
1.46, p = .235, p
2 04
= . , and no interaction, F(1, 36) = 0.45,
p = .833, p
2 00
= . . Thus, the reaction time data is consistent
with the observed response biases.
Weapon Discrimination
The ability to discern the presence of a weapon was not
affected by target race, F(1, 36) = 1.27, p = .268, p
2 03
= . ,
but was marginally higher when the target wore the shemagh
and igal rather than a baseball cap, F(1, 36) = 3.79, p = .059,
p
2 10
= . . This was qualified by a significant interaction
between target race and headgear, F(1, 36) = 7.57, p = .009,
p
2 17
= . . Follow-up comparisons revealed that participants
were significantly more sensitive to the presence of guns
when the target was White and wearing a baseball cap (M =
2.92, SD = 0.88) than each other Race × Headgear combina-
tion, Fs(1, 36)  5.41, ps  .026, p
2 13
 . . There were no
significant differences in discrimination between the other
Race × Headgear combinations (White with shemagh and
igal, M = 2.59, SD = 0.95; Middle Eastern with shemagh and
igal, M = 2.71, SD = 0.81; Middle Eastern with baseball cap,
M = 2.61, SD = 1.00), Fs(1, 36)  0.77, ps  .386, p
2 02
 . .
Discussion
We found support for Hypothesis 1 (race bias) in that Saudi
Arabian men were more likely to shoot at their racial out-
group than ingroup. This pattern of behavior is identical to
that observed in racial majorities in Western samples (Correll
et al., 2002; Miller et al., 2012; Unkelbach et al., 2008).
Contradicting Hypothesis 2 (headgear bias), Saudis unex-
pectedly displayed greater bias toward shooting targets wear-
ing the shemagh and igal over those wearing baseball caps.
This result replicates prior research in which Western partici-
pants displayed greater shooter bias toward people wearing
Arab headgear (Unkelbach et al., 2008) but failed to support
our hypothesised reversal of the effect in Saudi Arabia. The
results were internally consistent. Participant inclusion crite-
ria did not alter the conclusions of the study, and reaction-
time-based analyses supported the conclusions drawn from
the signal detection analyses.
In the present SaudiArabian sample, we found the hypoth-
esized link between being a member of the racial ingroup
and increased likelihood of shooting the racial outgroup
member. Although these results may appear intuitive, it must
be emphasized that racial biases in non-Western populations
have not been the subject of much quantitative investigation.
Shooter biases are relative effects and do not necessarily

indicate that White people and the shemagh and igal are per-
ceived as dangerous in absolute terms. Rather, we cautiously
speculate that the present findings may indicate that White
targets may have been perceived as relatively more danger-
ous (or less safe) than Middle Eastern targets. Moreover, tar-
gets wearing the shemagh and igal may have also been
perceived as relatively more dangerous (or less safe) than
targets wearing American style baseball caps.
It is important to consider why we may have found the
predicted ingroup­outgroup pattern for race but not cultural
markers. One possibility for this surprising finding is that it
was a Type 1 error: Future research should try to replicate
this effect in both Saudi Arabia and the Middle East more
broadly. However, given the same pattern emerged in the
analyses of response times, it is worth considering non-sta-
tistical explanations. The bias toward shooting targets wear-
ing the shemagh and igal more than baseball caps may be a
result of favorable shifts toward the Western world or nega-
tive shifts away from traditional-conservative values. Young
Saudis are increasingly technologically engaged, and
Westernized (Samin, 2012) especially in their clothing
choices (Assad, 2008). Due to the immutability of race, these
social changes should not shift danger and safety perceptions
of White targets relative to Middle Eastern targets: however,
increasing globalization may have changed perceptions of
Western cultural markers relative to traditional Saudi cultural
markers of the shemagh and igal.
The alternate possibility is that Saudi clothing is becom-
ing more negatively perceived for the traditional-conserva-
tive values it represents. Such a shift could be a result of
Saudi Arabian participants internalizing Western media ste-
reotypes aboutArabs, Muslims, and/or those from the Middle
East. These stereotypes are resoundingly negative, with only
5% of Hollywood films presenting Arabs in normal roles
(Shaheen, 2003). Exposure to this type of stereotyped media
is known to increase anti-Arab bias in Western samples
(Saleem & Anderson, 2013). Consequently, exposure to
these Western stereotypes may have resulted in their inter-
nalization, and development of an anti-Arab bias among
Saudi youth. This process may be similar to Black partici-
pants' internalized stereotypes about Blacks explaining their
bias to shoot at Black targets (Maddox & Gray, 2002; Plant
et al., 2011). Contrary to this explanation, however, are
observations of relatively minimal mass demonstrations in
Saudi Arabia during Arab spring (Samin, 2012) and the
defense of traditional-conservative values on Saudi Internet
message boards (Samin, 2008).
In an increasingly globalized society, it is important to
know how one's race and culture may be perceived not only
at home but also abroad. Due to the Western bias in experi-
mental research on racial hostility, this information had not
been previously available. The present findings may be help-
ful for White people traveling or interacting with people in
Middle Eastern countries like Saudi Arabia. For instance,
rather than conforming to a culturally normative dress-code,
it may be better to dress in a stereotypically Western manner.
Furthermore, the present findings provide unique insight into
social perception processes that may be affected by the rap-
idly changing cultural milieu in the Arab world. However,
because our study consisted of only male University stu-
dents, caution must be practiced when generalizing to the
broader Saudi population.
Conclusion
Consistent with research in the West, our participants showed
a greater bias to shoot at a social outgroup: in this case, White
targets. This mirrors the effect shown in Western countries in
which participants show a greater bias to shoot Middle
Eastern targets (Unkelbach et al., 2008). However, when
examining clothing, we found that people wearing culturally
appropriate Saudi attire may have been perceived as more
dangerous. Our findings highlight the necessity of consider-
ing cultural variation in social perceptions of social
categories.
