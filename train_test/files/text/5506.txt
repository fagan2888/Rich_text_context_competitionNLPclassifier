Introduction
One area in second language acquisition that has always
attracted practitioners is Corrective Feedback (CF). Scholars
and practitioners have studied different aspects of error cor-
rection such as the type that best fits certain groups of learn-
ers, the time that errors should be taken care of, the type of
error that should be addressed, and many more areas. CF has
been studied from different perspectives: role of anxiety
(see, for example, DeKeyser, 1993), efficiency (see, for
example, Lightbown & Spada, 2006; Mohammadi, 2009;
Swain, 1985), obtrusiveness (see, for example, C. J. Doughty,
2003; C. Doughty & Varela, 1998; Long, Inagaki, & Ortega,
1998), learners' preferences (Elwood & Bode, 2014), and
proficiency (see, for example, Mackey & Philp, 1998) just to
name a few. What is ostensibly missing from the bulk of
research in this realm is an all-inclusive study whereby the
effect of all these CF strategies is studied. R. Ellis (2009)
also pointed out that no research has been carried out that
encompasses all the different types of CF:
There is an obvious need for carefully designed experimental
studies to further investigate the effects of written CF in general
and of different types of CF. [This] typology . . . [is based on] the
type of CF . . . [making systematic research possible to examine]
the effect of distinct types and combinations of CF. (p. 106)
The researchers, therefore, aimed at finding out which of
the CF strategies best serves Iranian English as a Foreign
Language (EFL) learners at an intermediate level with their
writing proficiency in the second task of a high-stakes test,
namely, International English Language Testing System
(IELTS). This research, therefore, could pave the way for
English language teachers to find out the best CF type espe-
cially for the second task of the IELTS exam for intermediate
EFL learners. It can also be conducive to better language per-
formance for the learners should they know what CF strategy
best works for them.
Literature Review
There are different classifications for CF strategies proposed
by different researchers (Burke & Pieterick, 2010; R. Ellis,
2009; Lyster & Ranta, 1997). However, these classifications
differ in essence. Lyster and Ranta's (1997) classification
that encompasses six different categories, namely, clarifica-
tion request, explicit feedback, recasts, metalinguistic feed-
back, elicitation, and repetition is mainly used for learners'
oral productions, although with a little modification, it could
also be used for learners' writing activities. A
little modification should be exerted because a technique like

The Effect of Six Different Corrective
Feedback Strategies on Iranian English
Language Learners' IELTS Writing Task 2
Reza Vahdani Sanavi1 and Majid Nemati1
Abstract
Scholars have long studied the effect of corrective feedback strategies on the writing ability of language learners, but few
have formed designs in which more than three feedback strategies have been used. In this research, the ultimate goal was
to discover how International English Language Testing System (IELTS-) candidates could be helped to perform better in
the writing component of the test with the feedback they get. To this end, 186 learners attending IELTS preparation classes
in three different English language institutes participated in this quasi-experimental study. A one-way ANOVA was run to
discover the significant difference among the six groups. The findings proposed that Iranian English as a Foreign Language
(EFL) students' writing ability improved as a result of the employment of writing feedback strategies but that reformulation
strategy was the most effective one. Teachers can, thus, benefit from the finding of this research by studying the way they
should tackle the learners' inaccurate productions as far as different writing score band descriptors are concerned.

elicitation in which the teacher might pause and suggest an
erroneous part in the speaker's performance is not possible in
written form. The teacher should, thus, resort to an offline
way of correcting rather than an online one, when the learn-
ers immediately get feedback.
Unlike that of Lyster and Ranta (1997), Burke and
Pieterick's (2010) classification focuses on the quality of
feedback. Their evaluative and advisory types of feedback
look at the writing performance of the learners with the aim
of assigning a score on their past performance or with the
aim of improving the quality of the learners' written piece
respectively.
Among all, the classification put forward by R. Ellis
(2009) best serves the purpose of this research in that the
focus in this research was writing and how and whether it
could be improved via the different CF strategies. Ellis's
classification encompasses six major categories, namely,
direct, indirect, metalinguistic, focused/unfocused, elec-
tronic, and reformulation. In the direct kind of feedback, the
correct form of the inaccurate form is provided. According to
Ferris (2006), this could be done by adding or omitting some
words to form the correct form. This type of feedback could
best work with elementary learners. However, teachers will
have to spend a lot of time correcting the learners' papers
(Ferris & Roberts, 2001).
Conversely, in the indirect CF, the teacher indicates where
the error exists by underlining or specifying the location of
the error. Ferris and Roberts (2001) held that this kind of
feedback is advantageous to the direct form in that the learn-
ers spend more time trying to figure out what is wrong,
hence, more processing time. In other words, this will allow
more reflection on the kind of error the learner has; thus,
there will more cognitive processing.
Metalinguistic feedback could take one of two forms: use
of error coding or a brief grammatical description. In the for-
mer type, the teacher writes some codes in the margin to sug-
gest what problems learners have (e.g., wo for word order).
Of course, the learners will have a list of the codes to avoid
confusion. However, in the second type of metalinguistic
feedback, the teacher numbers the errors and briefly provides
a brief explanation for the error at the end of the text.
The next type of feedback according to R. Ellis (2009)
depends on the focus of the feedback. As the name suggests
in unfocused feedback, the scope of correction is unre-
strained and the teacher could correct all extant errors, be it
grammatical, lexical, sociolinguistic, or the like, but in
focused CF, the teacher only focuses on what he or she has
taught and ignores the rest of the errors. The processing time
of errors in unfocused CF strategy might be overwhelming
for the learners because the teacher pinpoints all errors.
The last two types of CF strategies are electronic feed-
back and reformulation, which are not as common as the
ones mentioned earlier. In electronic feedback, learners use
an electronic software. Use of an electronic corpus like con-
cordancing can give learners the feedback they need.
Reformulation as the last CF type in Ellis's classification is a
kind of feedback in which the teacher reconstructs the inac-
curate part to make it more natural. In reformulation, the
whole idea is to retain the original meaning but to reshape the
form to make it more native-like.
All in all, many scholars suggest that CF strategies are
fruitful and in some cases, some scholars favor direct over
indirect (Ferris & Roberts, 2001). Conversely, several others
discovered that indirect feedback results in either greater or
similar levels of accuracy over time (Lalande, 1982; Robb,
Ross, & Shortreed, 1986). Yet, some (Truscott, 1996, 1999,
2007) do not think highly of feedback not at least in the long
run and claim that there is a gap in research findings regard-
ing the long-time effect of feedback in Second Language
Acquistion (SLA). What these scholars neglect is the imme-
diacy of need. A lot of those who take part in a high-stakes
test such as IELTS or Test of English as a Foreign Language
(TOEFL) are not thinking of their improvement as a long-
term goal but rather an immediate one. The claims made
against CF by Truscott might be true when it comes to long-
term goals. However, there are some people who will have to
sit for some high-stakes tests and they might be after some
immediate remedies to help improve their inaccurate perfor-
mance and eventually get a higher score instantly, so they are
more worried about their immediate needs rather than their
long-term goals. This study could help find out whether any
of the feedback types included in the study could have a sta-
tistically significant effect on the stakeholders' writing
performance.
Research Question and Hypothesis
To study the effectiveness of the different CF strategies, the
researchers posed the following question:
Research Question 1: Does the employment of different
CF strategies affect the writing ability of Iranian IELTS
candidates' writing performance in Task 2?
The following null hypothesis was proposed for the afore-
mentioned question:
Null Hypothesis: The employment of different CF strate-
gies does not affect the writing performance of the Iranian
IELTS candidates' writing performance in Task 2.
Method
Participants
The participants in this quasi-experimental research included
186 BA/BS and MA/MS students studying at different uni-
versities across the country, and they were preparing them-
selves to sit for the IELTS exam to attend universities abroad,
where the medium of instruction is English. The participants,
Nemati and Sanavi 3
chosen from the three different institutes where preparation
courses were held, ranged between 21 and 35 years of age.
Design
The experimental phase of the present research was based on
a pretest­posttest, quasi-experimental design, which
involved six experimental groups, as presented in Table 1.
The design used here lacked a control group for several
reasons. First, depriving the learners from a treatment would
be a design defect, for which a lot of researchers have reser-
vations. Furthermore, it is unethical. Although some partici-
pants receive some kind of treatment, others in the control
group are deprived of any form of CF. In addition, according
to Ary, Jacobs, and Razavieh (1996) and Mackey and Gass
(2005), when participants are randomly assigned to one of
the experimental groups, the comparison of groups receiving
different treatment provides the same control over alterna-
tive explanations as does the comparisons of treated and
untreated groups. They argued that more common than com-
paring a treatment group with a group receiving no treatment
is the situation where we compare groups receiving different
treatments.
Procedures
R. Ellis (2009) proposed that there are six major feedback
strategies. With the exclusion of one, that is, electronic feed-
back, and the inclusion of peer feedback, six different groups
were required to start the research experimentally. The rea-
son why electronic feedback was removed from the study
was the fact that access to the electronic material was not
easy at the institutes where the research was run, and because
the participants had never been exposed to concordancing
before, it would be considered too time-consuming for them
to use. Accordingly, six groups were used, each of which was
exposed to one kind of feedback strategies. Below, an expla-
nation of how the participants were selected and how the
study was carried out is discussed.
The participants were all bachelors or masters students or
graduates who were planning to sit for the IELTS exam at
three different language institutes in Tehran. On referring to
the institutes to sign up for IELTS classes, they were given an
IELTS exam to see whether they were qualified to attend
IELTS classes or whether they needed some remedial work.
If they were within an overall band score of 5 to 6, they could
take part in the IELTS preparation classes; otherwise, they
would be introduced to some other preparatory classes.
Because the number of students in the classes did not exceed
15, for each of the six treatment groups, two IELTS classes
were used. This would also account for the participant attri-
tion that is a threat to the internal validity of the research. The
homogeneity of the subjects to control the subject variability
could also be controlled through the placement procedure.
Overall, in all the six experimental groups, the number of
students ranged from 25 to 28.
A one-way ANOVA was run to compare the mean scores
of the six CF groups on the pretest of writing to prove that
they were homogeneous in terms of their writing ability prior
to the administration of the treatments. However, the two
assumptions of normality and homogeneity of variances
were probed before reporting the results of the one-way
ANOVA. The students were then exposed to some writing
strategies and required to write. The only thing that differed
in the six groups was the CF strategy used to correct their
writing.
In the final session of the course, the students were given
the final writing task. This task served as the posttest to
gauge the participants' writing ability improvement. The
writing samples were corrected 3 times by two different rat-
ers based on the criteria proposed by the Cambridge English
for Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL) Center, which are
grammatical range and accuracy, lexical resources, coher-
ence and cohesion, and task achievement. Three ratings, two
by one and a third one by another rater, could guarantee
intra- and interrater reliability. As displayed later, signifi-
cantly high reliability suggested that the scoring could be
used as good source for deciding about the participants'writ-
ing skill improvement.
Another one-way ANOVA was run to compare the mean
scores of the six CF groups on the writing posttest to find out
which error correction method had the most significant effect
on the improvement of the students' writing ability on the
posttest. The two assumptions of normality and homogeneity
of variances were probed before reporting the results of the
one-way ANOVA. The ratios of skewedness and kurtosis
over their respective standard errors were within the ranges
of ±1.96, that is to say, the students' scores on the posttest of
writing enjoyed normal distribution.
When the F value indicated significant differences among
the mean scores of the six CF groups on the posttest of writ-
ing, the researcher had to exercise a follow-up post hoc
Scheffe's test to compare the mean scores in pairs to see
where the significant difference lay.
To test the null hypotheses, the researchers first had to
make sure that there were inter- and intrarater reliabilities
when the learners' writings are rated. Therefore, analyses of
these two measures follow.

Intra- and interrater reliability indexes.The students' writings
were rated 3 times by two raters. The first rater rated them
twice with a time interval of 2 weeks. As displayed in Table
2, the intrarater reliability for the first rater's two ratings is
.78 (.000 < .05). Based on these results, it can be concluded
that the two ratings of the first rater enjoy statistically signifi-
cant intrarater reliability.
The interrater reliability between the ratings of the second
rater with the mean ratings of the first one is .94 (p = .000 <
.05). Based on these results, it can be concluded that the two
ratings enjoy statistically significant interrater reliability
(Table 3).
4.2.11.2 pretest of writing.A one-way ANOVA was run to
compare the mean scores of the six groups on the pretest of
writing to prove that they were homogeneous in terms of
their writing ability prior to the administration of the treat-
ments. The two assumptions of normality and homogeneity
of variances should be probed before reporting the results of
the one-way ANOVA.
As displayed in Table 4, the ratios of skewedness and kur-
tosis over their respective standard errors are within the
ranges of ±1.96. That is to say, the students' scores on the
pretest of writing enjoy normal distributions.
Levene's statistic tests the assumption of homogeneity of
variances. Levene's F value of 1.51 is not significant (p =
.191 > .05). Thus, the second assumption as homogeneity of
variances is also met (Table 5).
The SPSS output in Table 6 displays the means, standard
deviations, and number of participants in all conditions of
the experiment on the pretest of writing.
The results of the one-way ANOVA (Table 7) indicate
that there were not any significant differences between the
mean scores of the six error correction methods on the pre-
test of writing (F = 1.67, p = .146 > .05, 2 = .017). Based
on these results, it can be concluded that the six groups
were homogeneous in terms of their writing ability prior to
the administration of the different error correction
methods.
4.2.11.3 posttest of writing. A one-way ANOVA was also run
to compare the mean scores of the six error correction meth-
ods on the posttest of writing to find out which error correc-
tion method has the most significant effect on the
improvement of the students' writing ability on the posttest.
The SPSS output in Table 8 displays the means, standard
deviations, and number of participants in all conditions of
the experiment on the posttest of writing.

The two assumptions of normality and homogeneity of
variances should be probed before reporting the results of the
one-way ANOVA. As displayed in Table 9, the ratios of
skewedness and kurtosis over their respective standard errors
are within the ranges of ±1.96. That is to say, the students'
scores on the posttest of writing enjoy normal distributions.
Levene's statistic tests the assumption of homogeneity of
variances. Levene's F value of 2.10 is not significant (p =
.069 > .05). Thus, the second assumption as homogeneity of
variances is also met (Table 10).
The results of the one-way ANOVA reveal that there are
significant differences between the mean scores of the six
error correction methods on the posttest of writing (F = 9.36,
p = .000 < .05, 2 = .49). Thus, the null hypothesis is rejected,
and we can say that there are significant differences between
the mean scores of the six error correction method groups on
the posttest of writing. Table 11 displays the mean scores of
the six groups on the posttest of writing.
Figure 1 displays the mean scores of the groups on the
posttest of writing. Reformulation was the most useful
method used when correcting the writing performance of
the students. Surprisingly, direct form as well as the indi-
rect mode of correction, according to the graph, were the
least fruitful techniques when compared with the rest of the

CF strategies. These two CF strategies were then followed
by metalinguistic, peer correction, and error-coding
strategies.
Although the F value (F = 9.36) indicates significant dif-
ferences between the mean scores of the six error correction
methods on the posttest of writing, the post hoc Scheffe's
tests should be run to compare the mean scores in pairs.
Based on the information displayed in Figure 1, it can be
concluded that there are significant differences between the
following pairs of means.
A: The reformulation group (M = 6.93) outperformed the
direct form group (M = 5.68) on the posttest of writing.
B: The reformulation group (M = 6.93) outperformed the
indirect form group (M = 5.68) on the posttest of writing.
C: The reformulation group (M = 6.93) outperformed the
metalinguistic group (M = 5.86) on the posttest of writing
(Table 12).
Discussion
Like most other studies so far (e.g., Chandler, 2003; Ferris,
2006; Sheen, 2007), this study investigated CF strategies.
The investigation of the effect CF strategies on the writing
performance of the six different groups suggests that the
reformulation group enjoys a more statistically significant
score. The learners in reformulation group outperformed all
those in other groups. The written CF in this study could help
learners with their explicit knowledge of L2 for the interface
between the explicit and implicit knowledge does not occur
immediately (N. C. Ellis, 2005), and this study was not a
longitudinal one to find out whether the learners' implicit
knowledge is also affected. Reformulation proved to work
with the students because the students in the group outper-
formed all the other students as statistically shown (see
Table 7).
The findings in this research are in line with what
Bitchener (2008), Bitchener and Knoch (2008), Gass (2003),
and Lee (2008) claimed in that the performance of the learn-
ers in all the different groups improved. However, the find-
ings go against the claim by Kepner (1991), Semke (1984),
and Sheppard (1992) who reported no significant difference
in the writing accuracy of the students, for in all the groups,
there were significant changes in the pretest and posttest of
the participants (see Tables 7 and 11). It should be mentioned
that the design such as those of Polio, Fleck, and Leder
(1998), or Sheppard (1992), did not include a nonfeedback
control group. One big difference between this study and

those of R. Ellis, Sheen, Murakami, and Takashima, (2008),
Farrokhi and Sattarpour (2012) is that they focused on one
aspect of grammar like articles. However, this study focused
on a global change to grammatical accuracy.
Research findings of this study comport with those of
Carroll and Swain (1993) in terms of the efficacy of negative
feedback. However, as opposed to what they claimed, that is,
the better performance of learners in the implicit groups, this
study purported an enhancement of performance as a result
of an explicit form of feedback, that is, reformulation in
comparison with other forms of feedback. The study also
corresponded to that carried out by Lightbown and Spada
(1990) who suggested an overall improvement in the partici-
pants' writing skill as a result of the incorporation of form-
focused activities in instruction. The significant improvement
in the learners' scores especially in reformulation bears wit-
ness to this view. It can thus be claimed that error correction
can lead to more accurate written forms and eventually better
writing scores (Shintani & Ellis, 2013).
Although the findings in this research lent support to the
view that explicit feedback, namely, reformulation, is more
fruitful than other forms of CF, a few additional issues should
be taken into account. The participants in the reformulation
group outperformed (M = 6.93) all the learners in the rest of
the groups. However, reformulation was the only feedback
strategy that proved significant difference. All the other
groups' mean scores did not differ significantly whether the
CF strategy used was explicit of one kind or another. In addi-
tion, the period between the two tests, the time frame, was
only 10 weeks. The learners in implicit groups apparently
needed more time to reflect, so a lengthier time interval
might be inversely reported as being more fruitful.
Nevertheless, the issue of time is one major problem in mat-
ters of high-stakes test. In other words, it should be empha-
sized that the luxury of time is an overburden over the
shoulders of the stakeholders, be it the learners or their
teachers.
Theoretical and Pedagogical
Implications
Like many of the studies, the findings of this study adds to
the bulk of knowledge regarding CF strategies. The main
theoretical implication of the study is that it dealt with a par-
ticular domain of the language and revolved around a phe-
nomenon, writing, under a "parent" category,
socioculturalism. In this respect, the researcher studied writ-
ing without recourse to other territories or perspectives.
Sociocultural theory is profoundly rooted in the Vygotskyan
social constructivist views. The present research aimed at the
feedback aspect of language learning and, in this sense, only
dealt with one area of language learning. Therefore, it has
much in common with what is claimed by Vygotskyan
approach to learning through intervention and mediation.
Another significant contribution of the study is that the
benefits of reformulation extend beyond form and grammati-
cal structure and encompass other band descriptors in the
IELTS writing scoring rubric, namely, task achievement,
coherence and cohesion, and lexical resources because the
feedback provider dealt with those things at the same time,
for the definition of reformulation sanctioned feedback on
other areas as well.
Using the findings of the research, from a pedagogical
perspective, some implications can be drawn which could

benefit stakeholders in high-stakes tests. Although, as Miller
Cleary (1991) suggested, responses to language problems are
beneficial as long as they are subsidiary to responses on con-
tent and ideas, the posttest results (see Table 9) suggest that
learners preparing themselves for a high-stakes test benefit
significantly from all kinds of feedback, but reformulation
has a more significant role. Miller Cleary (1991) stated, ". . .
demand for absolute correctness, rightness, or neatness
distract[s] the writer's concentration from other important
aspects of the writing process" (p. 498). However, it is a very
strong claim that anyone claims "absolute correctness."
Likewise, Leki's (1999) claim that refraining from focus
on form could lower the learner writers' anxiety was funda-
mentally questioned for almost all of the participants of this
research who wished to sit for a high-stakes test claimed they
needed feedback, and depriving them of any feedback could
aggravate their anxiety rather than allay it. What Leki said
might be true in some cases but most probably not in such
contexts as that of this research.
The results of this study show that reformulation resulted
in better performance while learning to write for IELTS Task
2 writing section. The participants in the other five groups
improved as well, but the improvement they had was not sta-
tistically significant enough. One of the strange things about
the findings of the study was the mismatch between how the
learners felt toward the direct and indirect feedback and how
they affected the learners' performance on the test. It is
imperative, therefore, that teachers pay attention to the fact
that what learners think is more beneficial might not be so in
effect. This could pave the way for another research in which
researchers look for match and mismatch between what
learners and even teachers think and what best works for the
learners. It should also be borne in mind that the results of the
study cannot prove whether the improvement in the scores
might mean an enhancement in explicit or implicit knowl-
edge as Shintani and Ellis (2013) also put forward.
