Haemoglobin A1c, fasting glucose, serum C-peptide and insulin
resistance in relation to serum uric acid levels--the Third
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
H. K. Choi1 and E. S. Ford2
Objective. To evaluate haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), fasting glucose, serum C-peptide and insulin resistance in relation to serum uric acid
levels in a nationally representative sample of men and women.
Methods. Using data from 14 664 participants aged 20 yrs and older in The US Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(1988­1994), we examined the relation between the levels of HbA1c, other biomarkers and serum uric acid levels using multivariate linear
regressions stratified by gender.
Results. The serum uric acid levels increased with increasing serum HbA1c levels up to the category of 6­6.9%, and thereafter decreased
with further increasing HbA1c levels (a bell-shaped relation). Compared with a HbA1c level of <5%, the multivariate differences among
women were 26.8 mol/l for HbA1c of 6­6.9% and À25.6 mol/l (95% CI À42.8, À8.3) for HbA1c !9%. The corresponding multivariate
differences among men were 8.3 mol/l (95% CI À3.0, 19.6) and À64.8 mol/l (95% CI À46.0, À84.5), which were both significantly different
from those among women (P-values for interaction by sex <0.001). Fasting glucose levels also showed a bell-shaped relation with serum uric
acid levels. Individuals with diabetes showed lower serum uric acid levels and the association was larger among men (P-value for interaction,
0.007). Serum uric acid levels increased linearly with increasing fasting serum C-peptide levels, serum insulin levels or insulin resistance
(multivariate P-values for trend, <0.001).
Conclusions. Individuals with moderately elevated HbA1c levels (i.e. pre-diabetes) may be at a higher risk of hyperuricaemia and gout,
particularly in women, whereas individuals with diabetes or highly elevated HbA1c levels may be at a lower risk of these conditions,
particularly in men.
KEY WORDS: Uric acid, Gout, Haemoglobin A1c, C-peptide, Insulin, Insulin resistance, NHANES III.
Introduction
Hyperuricaemia is considered the precursor of gout, which is the
most common inflammatory arthritis in adult men [1]. Several
studies have shown that a moderate degree of hyperglycaemia is
associated with higher serum uric acid levels, while a higher degree
of hyperglycaemia (>10 mmol/l [180 mg/dl]) is associated with
lower serum uric acid levels [2­5]. This bell-shaped relationship
raises an interesting implication of the diverging risk of hyper-
uricaemia or gout among pre-diabetic vs diabetic individuals.
While the spot blood glucose test reflects glucose levels at the
moment of the test, glycated haemoglobin or haemoglobin A1c
(HbA1c) reflects an average blood glucose level over the past 3
months. Thus, HbA1c levels provide a longer-term picture of blood
glucose status as an exposure variable. To date, no study has
investigated the relation between HbA1c and serum uric acid levels.
Furthermore, although several previous studies have described rela-
tions between insulin levels, insulin resistance and serum uric acid
levels [6­10], we are not aware of any study that investigated the link
with C-peptide (a measure of endogenous insulin levels [11]).
To examine these issues, we analysed a nationally representa-
tive sample of men and women (the US Third National Health
and Nutritional Examination Survey, NHANES III) [12, 13].
Materials and methods
Study population
Conducted between 1988 and 1994, the NHANES III included a
representative sample of the non-institutionalized civilian US
population, which was selected by using a multistage, stratified
sampling design [12]. After a home interview, participants were
invited to attend examination sessions where blood and urine
specimens were obtained. For participants unable to attend the
examination for health reasons, a blood sample was obtained
during the home interview. We limited our analysis for HbA1c
levels to participants 20 yrs or older who attended the medical
examination and included the 14 664 participants (6861 men and
7803 women) with complete information in our analyses. We
repeated our analyses among 14 223 participants after excluding
those who self-reported gout or were taking allopurinol or
uricosuric agents (n ¼ 441). For the blood tests that required
fasting (i.e. fasting C-peptide, blood glucose, insulin levels), we
limited our analyses to the 9023 participants (4255 men and 4768
women) who had fasted at least 8 h prior to the blood collection.
The NHANES III study underwent institutional review board
approval, and written informed consent was obtained from
participants prior to starting the study.
Measurements
Glycosylated haemoglobin concentration was measured by ion-
exchange HPLC with a glycosylated haemoglobin analyser
system (DIAMAT; Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA),
C-peptide levels by use of a RIA (Bio-Rad Laboratories), plasma
glucose levels by a hexokinase enzymatic reference method
(COBAS MIRA; Roche Diagnostics Corporation, Laboratory
Systems, Montclair, New Jersey, USA) and serum insulin levels
by means of an RIA (Pharmacia Diagnostics, Uppsala, Sweden)
[12, 13]. Analytical protocols for other serum analytes and

laboratory quality-assurance procedures were described elsewhere
[13, 14]. A Homeostasis Model Assessment (HOMA) was used to
evaluate insulin resistance [15, 16]. Assuming that normal subjects
aged 35 with normal weight have an insulin resistance of 1, the
values for a patient can be calculated from the fasting concentra-
tions of insulin and glucose using the following formula: fasting
serum insulin (U/ml) Â fasting plasma glucose (mmol/l)/22.5
[15, 16].
Serum uric acid was measured by oxidization with the specific
enzyme uricase to form allantoin and H2
O2
(Hitachi Model 737
Multichannel Analyzer, Boehringer Mannheim Diagnostics,
Indianapolis, IN, USA). Details about quality-control procedures
have been published elsewhere [13]. Values are reported in
micromoles per litre; to convert to milligrams per decilitre,
divide by 59.48.
Assessment of co-variates
The average daily intakes of total meat, seafood and dairy foods
were derived from responses to a food frequency questionnaire.
Food frequency questionnaire assessment of dietary intake has
been shown to be a valid and reliable method for assessing average
dietary consumption [17, 18]. The NHANES III collected
information on body measurements (including height and
weight), medication use (including diuretics, anti-hypertensives,
allopurinol and uricosuric agents), medical conditions (including
self-reported physician-diagnosed diabetes, hypertension and
gout) and serum creatinine. Glomerular filtration rate (GFR)
was estimated by using the simplified Modification of Diet
in Renal Disease study equation: GFR (ml/min/1.73 m2) ¼
186 Â (serum creatinine level [mg/dl])À1.154 Â (age)À0.203 Â [0.742,
if female] Â [1.212, if black] [19­21]. BMI was calculated by
dividing the weight in kilograms by the square of the height in
metres.
Statistical analysis
All statistical analyses were computed using survey commands
of STATA (e.g. SVYMEAN and SVYREG) to incorporate
sample weights and adjust for clusters and strata of the complex
sample design (Version 8.2, STATA Corporation, College Station,
TX, USA).
We used linear regression modelling to evaluate the relation
between HbA1c levels, other glucose­insulin markers and uric
acid levels. Percentage of HbA1c was categorized into six groups:
<5, 5­5.9, 6­6.9, 7­7.9, 8­8.9 and !9. Serum C-peptide levels
were categorized into five groups: <0.5, 0.5­0.9, 1­1.4, 1.5­1.9
and !2 nmol/l. Because previous reports suggested significant
differences between sexes in the relation between glucose­insulin
markers and serum uric acid levels [10], our analyses were
stratified by sex. We evaluated the significance of the potential
interaction by sex by testing the significance of interaction
terms added to our final multivariate models. These models
were adjusted for age, smoking status, BMI, use of diuretics,
-blockers, allopurinol and uricosuric agents, self-reported
hypertension, GFR, and intake of total energy, total meats,
seafood, dairy foods, sugar-sweetened soft drinks and coffee.
When categorical analyses suggested linear trends across cate-
gories, statistical significance of trends were assessed in the final
multivariate linear regression models by using the median values
of each category to minimize the influence of outliers. We also
performed logistic regression with a dichotomous outcome of
hyperuricaemia (i.e. serum uric acid >416 mol/l [7 mg/dl] among
men and serum uric acid >339 mol/l among women [5.7 mg/dl]
[13]), adjusting for the same covariates. We examined the potential
impact of an alternative definition of hyperuricaemia (serum
uric acid >357 mol/l [6 mg/dl] regardless of sex) in these
regression models. To graphically display the relation between
HbA1c levels, fasting blood glucose levels, and serum uric acid
levels, we plotted the predicted values of quadratic models
(using continuous values) and CIs, reflecting the relation
suggested by the categorical analyses. For serum C-peptide,
insulin and insulin resistance levels, we plotted the predicted
values of linear regression models with CIs. For all difference
estimates and odds ratios (ORs), we calculated 95% CIs. All
P-values are two-sided.
Results
The population's mean age was 45 yrs. The mean serum uric acid
was 316.4 mol/l (361.0 mol/l among men and 276.6 mol/l
among women) and 18% were hyperuricaemic (19% with serum
uric acid >416 mol/l among men and 17% with serum uric acid
>339 mol/l among women [13]). The characteristics of the
study population according to HbA1c levels are shown in
Table 1. With increasing HbA1c levels, age, BMI and frequency
of hypertension, diuretic use and uric acid lowering medication
use tended to increase, particularly up to the HbA1c level 7­7.9%,
but alcohol consumption tended to decrease.
The serum uric acid level increased with increasing serum
HbA1c levels up to the category of 6­6.9%, and thereafter
decreased with further increasing HbA1c levels (a bell-shaped
relation) (Table 2 and Fig. 1). Compared with an HbA1c level of
<5%, the multivariate differences among women were 26.8 mol/l
(95% CI 16.7, 37.5) for HbA1c 6­6.9% and À25.6 mol/l (95%
CI À42.8, À8.3) for HbA1c !9%. The corresponding multivariate
differences among men were 8.3 mol/l (95% CI À3.0, 19.6) and
À64.8 mol/l (95% CI À45.8, À84.5) (Table 2), both of which
were significantly different from those among women (P-values
for interaction by sex <0.001).
The multivariate ORs for hyperuricaemia for an HbA1c level
of !9%, as compared with HbA1c <5%, were 0.51 (95% CI 0.25,
1.03) among women and 0.24 (95%CI 0.09, 0.67) among men.
Corresponding ORs using an alternative definition of hyper-
uricaemia (serum uric acid level >357 mol/l [6 mg/dl] regardless
of sex) were 0.61 (95% CI 0.28, 1.32) among women and 0.14
(95% CI 0.07, 0.28) among men.
When we repeated our analyses after excluding participants
who self-reported gout or were taking allopurinol or uricosuric
agents (n ¼ 441), compared with an HbA1c level of <5%, the
multivariate differences among women were 25.6 mol/l (95% CI

À8.9) for HbA1c !9%. The corresponding multivariate differ-
ences among men were 5.9 mol/l (95% CI À5.9, 17.8) and
À70.2 mol/l (95% CI À87.4, À52.3), both of which were signi-
ficantly different from those among women (P-values for
interaction by sex <0.001).
Fasting glucose levels showed a similar, bell-curved relation
with serum uric acid levels (Fig. 1). History of physician-
diagnosed diabetes was associated with a lower serum uric acid
level by 13.1 mol/l (95% CI 0.1, 16.7) among women and by
20.8 mol/l (95% CI 4.8, 37.5) among men in our multivariate
analyses (P-values for interaction by sex ¼ 0.007). These differ-
ences increased and remained significant after additional adjust-
ment for serum C-peptide levels (21.4 and 26.2 mol/l,
respectively), but became insignificant after additional adjustment
of HbA1c levels (P > 0.2).
Serum uric acid levels increased linearly with increasing fasting
serum C-peptide levels (Table 2 and Fig. 2) (P-values for trend,
<0.001) in both sexes, although the association was significantly
stronger among women (P-values for interaction by sex <0.001).
After adjusting for age, serum uric acid levels associated with
the largest category of serum C-peptide levels (!2 nmol/l) were
higher than in the lowest by 130.3 mol/l (95% CI 107.7, 152.9)
among women and 110.6 (95% CI 75.5, 145.7) among men
(P-values for trend, <0.001) (Table 3). After adjusting for other
co-variates, the difference was attenuated but remained significant
(P-values for trend, <0.001) (Table 3). When hyperuricaemia
was examined as a dichotomous outcome, the results were similar.
The multivariate ORs for hyperuricaemia according to
the categories of fasting serum C-peptide levels (<0.5, 0.5­0.9,
1­1.4, 1.5­1.9 and !2 nmol/l) were 1.00, 2.04, 5.47, 9.33 and 19.34
(95% CI 7.20, 52.00; P-values for trend <0.001) among women,
respectively. The corresponding ORs among men were 1.00, 1.75,
3.05, 3.84 and 5.12 (95% CI 1.79, 14.69; P-values for trend
<0.001). Similarly, serum insulin levels and insulin resistance by
HOMA showed a linearly increasing association both with serum
uric acid levels and odds of hyperuricaemia (both multivariate
P-values for trend <0.001) (Fig. 2)
Discussion
In this nationally representative sample of US men and women,
we found that the serum uric acid levels and the frequency
of hyperuricaemia increased with moderately increasing levels
of HbA1c (6­6.9%) and then decreased with further increasing
levels of HbA1c (a bell-shaped relation). Serum uric acid
levels showed a similar bell-curved relation with fasting glu-
cose levels. In comparison, serum uric acid levels and frequency of
hyperuricaemia monotonically increased with increasing fasting
C-peptide levels, as with increasing serum insulin levels and
insulin resistance. These associations were independent of other
risk factors for hyperuricaemia such as age, sex, BMI, dietary
factors, alcohol intake, renal function, hypertension and
diuretic use.
A biological mechanism underlying the bell-shaped relation
between blood glucose levels and serum uric acid levels is thought
to be due to the uricosuric effect of glycosuria, which occurs when
the blood glucose level is greater than $10 mmol/l (180 mg/dl) [2].
This level of blood glucose was consistent with that of HbA1c that
corresponded to the peak of serum uric acid in our data, further

supporting this notion. Correspondingly, history of diabetes was
significantly associated with lower levels of serum uric acid in this
study as well as in previous studies [2­5]. Our extended
multivariate analyses showed that this inverse association
became larger and stronger after adjusting for C-peptide, but
became smaller and insignificant after adjusting for HbA1c,
suggesting that the inverse link was due to average blood glucose
levels. Collectively, these results indicate that individuals with pre-
diabetes may be at a higher risk of developing gout, but once they
develop diabetes their risk may drop to a lower level than that of
normal individuals. This potential impact on the eventual risk
of gout was also supported by our results with hyperuricaemia as
a dichotomous outcome using various definitions.
The strong, linear and independent association between fasting
serum C-peptide levels and serum uric acid levels in this nationally
representative sample further adds to the close link between
insulin levels, insulin resistance and serum uric acid levels found
in previous studies [6­10] as well as in this study. Higher insulin
levels are known to reduce renal excretion of urate [7­9, 22].
For example, exogenous insulin can reduce the renal excretion
of urate in both healthy and hypertensive subjects [7, 8, 23].
Insulin may enhance renal urate reabsorption via stimulation of

the urate-anion exchanger URAT1 [24] and/or the Naþ-depen-
dent anion co-transporter in brush border membranes of the renal
proximal tubule [25]. Collectively, these data provide a strong
mechanism underlying the close link between the metabolic
syndrome, hyperuricaemia and gout [26­29]. The increased insulin
levels in individuals with insulin resistance syndrome could
conceivably contribute to their elevated serum uric acid levels to
the point where the effect is offset by subsequent development of
diabetes, leading to glycosuria, uricosuria and lower uric acid
levels.
We found that the positive associations between HbA1c (levels
<7%), serum C-peptide levels, and serum uric acid levels were
larger among women than men. These data closely agree with a
population study of non-diabetic adults [10]. This Chinese
community-based study reported a stronger association between
fasting plasma glucose, serum insulin levels and serum uric acid
levels among women than among men [10]. Furthermore, our
results revealed that the inverse association between diabetes (or a
level of HbA1c !7%) and serum uric acid levels was significantly
stronger among men than among women. The mechanism behind
these apparent gender differences remains unclear, although the
role of female sex hormones has been suspected [10]. It also
remains to be studied whether these differences could translate
into a differential risk of gout between sexes.
Strengths and limitations of our study deserve comment. This
study was performed in a nationally representative sample of US
women and men; thus, the findings are likely to be generalizable
to US men and women. Although previous reports and biological
plausibility consistently suggest that blood glucose and insulin
levels would affect the serum uric acid levels as observed [2­10],
a cross-sectional study design tends to leave uncertainty regarding
the temporal sequence of exposure­outcome relations. Thus,
confirming the relation with prospective longitudinal data (e.g.
relation between prior HbA1c, diabetes and incident hyperur-
icaemia or gout) would be valuable. Furthermore, it would be
interesting to study whether controlling diabetes by reducing
glycosuria would raise serum urate levels and increase the risk of
gout in this high-risk group.
In conclusion, individuals with moderately elevated HbA1c
levels (i.e. pre-diabetes) may be at a higher risk of hyperuricaemia
and gout, particularly in women, whereas individuals with highly
elevated HbA1c levels or diabetes may be at a lower risk of these
conditions, particularly in men.

 Individuals with moderately elevated HbA1c levels (i.e. pre-
diabetes) may be at a higher risk of hyperuricaemia and gout.
 However, individuals with highly elevated HbA1c levels or diabetes
may be at a lower risk of these conditions.
