Background
I think our society gives too much importance to what is
considered normal. Normal as in, if someone is physically fit or
is married . . . whatever their thinking may be, they will be
considered normal and they will be given importance. But, if
there is disability . . . then this is considered wrong and there is
no acceptance from society . . . (D01, 30 years, visual
impairment)
Social norms in India are influenced by values such as pro-
ductivity, the right to private property, and patriarchy
(Ahmed-Ghosh, 2004). Much is made of the rule of law, the
institution of marriage (Goel, 2005), the family as a social
unit, and the importance of religion. The family--able-bodied,
heterosexual, and engaged in socially acceptable liveli-
hoods--is the fundamental social unit. The history of the
Indian women's movement has been one of focus on poverty,
caste, and employment, issues such as dowry and sati, popu-
lation control and female feticide, sexuality, and domestic
violence. Its agenda has not, generally, included disability.
Critical feminist analysis of disability in India was initiated
by, among others, Renu Addlakha (Addlakha, 1998, 1999,
2001, 2005, 2006; Addlakha & Das, 2001; Davar, 1999;
Dhanda, 2000; Ghai, 2002a, 2002b; Hans, 2003). These fem-
inist scholars challenged the disability movement and the
women's movement.
An idea common in India is that disability represents a
personal flaw. Able-bodied people are the "corporeal stan-
dard" (Kumari, 2009), and--from a moral perspective--
disability arises as a consequence of karmic misdeeds:
Impairments are deserved and intrinsically punitive. Two
other perspectives on disability are also common. From a
charity or welfare perspective, disability speaks to an idea of
victimhood with which campaigners against violence against
women are familiar. The individual with disability deserves
sympathy and is dependent on the assistance of others. From
a biomedical or rehabilitative perspective, disability encom-
passes defects that require clinical intervention. Pervasive as
they are, these models are outmoded in disability discourse.
The United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons
With Disabilities (UN CRPD) recognizes that disability can
be seen as a collection of hindrances to participation in soci-
ety, a product of the interaction between people with impair-
ments, attitudinal, and environmental barriers. This model
locates disability in relation to structures rather than with
the individual. A rights-based model broadens this position
by promoting acceptance of diversity through nondiscrimi-
nating environments and inclusive social processes, to level
the playing field by tackling the visible privileges of the
able-bodied. Finally, in a cultural model, disability repre-
sents a pervasive system that, through stigmatization of
impairment, informs our notions of self, family, society, and
sexuality. Garland-Thomson argues that the system defines

Abstract
We conducted open-ended interviews with 15 women with disability who had reported violence in a preceding survey.
Emergent themes included a lack of acceptance by families, the systematic formation of a dependent self-image, and an
expectation of limited achievement. Emotional violence was particularly emphasized, as was perceived structural violence
stemming from social norms, which led to exclusion and vulnerability. Violence in the natal home was an issue that had been
relatively uninvestigated.

the relationship between bodies and their environments and
prescribes a set of practices that produce both the able-
bodied and the disabled (Reproductive and Sexual Health
Issues, 2010).
If women with disability do not physically measure up to
able-bodied standards, neither does society expect them to
do so. In many cases, they are not expected to adopt the roles
of wife and mother. Women with disability do not, however,
quietly acquiesce to this. They may struggle against negative
stereotyping in an attempt to develop a positive sense of self
within bodily and societal limitations, a struggle that does
not often leave space for celebration of difference and pride
in one's individuality (Addlakha, 2006). In a series of narra-
tive interviews with young people with disability, gender
was a defining element of the disability experience, but
meshed with elements such as class and caste, family com-
positionanddynamics,andgeographicallocation.Experience
of segregation and inclusion influenced informants'opinions
on marriage and family life and their social behavior, and,
although the charity model of disability was slowly giving
way to a human rights model, the transition was far from
complete (Addlakha, 2007). This study presents the findings
of a series of follow-up interviews with women with visual
or locomotor impairment.
Method
Setting
The study was carried out in Mumbai by the Society for
Nutrition, Education and Health Action (SNEHA), a non-
governmental organization. It was one of the three--in India,
Bangladesh, and Nepal--that formed a project on under-
standing violence against marginalized women in south Asia
(Dutta, Weston, Bhattacharji, Mukherji, & Joseph, 2012).
Design and Procedures
During an initial survey interview, we asked women who
reported an experience of violence if they would be interested
in participating in a later in-depth interview. We were able to
generate a subsample within the strata used for the survey.
Two pilot interviews were carried out to develop a better
understanding of the process, and subsequent interviews were
conducted by four senior researchers. Beginning with a topic
guide to key areas of interest, respondents were asked to
recount instances of violence and locate them within their
wider experience. The guide included open-ended questions
about the respondent's self-perception (e.g., her body image
and personality), family environment and social networks,
sources of psychological and social support, perspectives on
life as a woman in India, the idea of violence, experiences of
violence, and responses and coping strategies. Interviewers
used spontaneous probes to clarify information and to explore
in more detail other aspects of respondents' narratives.
Data Management and Analysis
Each woman was interviewed once, at a location of her
choice, typically in her home or accommodation, an office,
or--less frequently--a public space. We took written con-
sent. Interviews lasted an average 70 min, were digitally
recorded and transferred to secure files on a password-pro-
tected computer. Original audio recordings were deleted
after transfer and access was restricted to the study coordina-
tor and data analysts. Interviews were transcribed verbatim
and translated into English (Easton, Fry, & Greenberg, 2000;
McLellan, MacQueen, & Neidig, 2003), following a pre-
defined protocol to ensure consistency of transcription.
Transcripts also included the researcher's observations of the
interview setting, the reactions and behavior of the respon-
dent, reflections on the interview process, and additional
information not captured digitally. Respondents' names and
other identifying information were removed or replaced with
pseudonyms. Transcribed, anonymized interviews were
imported into NVivo version 7 qualitative data analysis soft-
ware (QSR International), on a secure computer. The master
list was prepared with anonymous codes and was stored in a
locked cupboard.
The analysis was carried out through a series of meetings
and online discussions that emphasized the extraction of
themes from the data. We followed an iterative process, using
findings from initial interviews to inform subsequent lines of
inquiry. We examined the qualitative data using a framework
approach, incorporating some principles of grounded theory
for initial coding (Green & Thorogood, 2004; Lacey & Luff,
2007). From the outset, members of the research team read
and reviewed the transcripts of all the interviews to familiar-
ize themselves with the data. We kept analytical notes on our
reflections on them, to include in the analysis and to inform
further data collection. We developed an initial thematic
framework from both a priori and emerging issues and used
open coding to identify, examine, compare, and categorize
individual pieces of data. We followed this with axial coding,
whereby the codes and categories were rearranged to look for
connections and associations between them (Strauss &
Corbin, 1990). The involvement of multiple researchers
helped us question our coding framework, propose new
codes, and offer alternative interpretations (Barbour, 2001).
As a result, we were able to refine our framework as further
data were collected, discussed, and analyzed. These data, in
the form of summaries and interview extracts, were copied
into a table to compare and contrast themes and categories
across cases. We then used this information to write a series
of more detailed descriptions, interpretations, and explana-
tions of our main findings. We used an ecological framework
to conceptualize women's experiences of violence (Heise,
1998; Krug, Mercy, Dahlberg, & Zwi, 2002). Designed to
understand the origins of gender-based violence, the frame-
work emphasizes the reciprocity between people and their
environment, recognizing the complex interplay between
Daruwalla et al. 3
personal, situational, and sociocultural factors. It considers
individual development and personality, interactions between
individuals and the subjective meanings they assign to them,
the formal and informal social structures that influence an
individual's environment, and the broader cultural values and
beliefs that permeate and inform the other levels.
Research Governance and Ethical Issues
The study was overseen by a steering group and approved by
the joint Institutional Ethics Committee of the Anusandhan
Trust and the University College London Research Ethics
Committee. We prespecified in the study protocol that partici-
pants should freely choose to be involved, at a time and place
oftheirselection,andcouldwithdrawatanytime.Interviewers
were trained in discussing sensitive issues and mechanisms
put in place for referral for support. The research team identi-
fied organizations that would be accessible to participants and
could provide timely and appropriate services. Investigators
were equipped with the contact details of organizations across
Mumbai who had consented in writing to accept referrals. All
such referrals were documented and followed up to meet the
requests made by respondents. A protocol was followed for
action in cases of violence, abuse, or distress. Clarity on the
responsibility of the researcher for inadvertently provoking
any action by respondents was also established.
Results
We interviewed 15 women with disability. Twelve had visual
impairment, 2, locomotor impairment, and 1 had both. Eight
were between the ages of 18 and 30, four were in their thir-
ties and three were older. Five were married. Ten women
were Hindu, 4 Muslim, and 1 was Christian. Five came from
poorer socioeconomic strata, 4 lived in hostels, and others
lived with their natal or marital families. Two had not had
any formal schooling, 3 had attended up to the 10th standard,
and 10 beyond. Nine did not have a job, although 1 of them
ran a small home-based business, and 2 others were learning
vocational skills.
Childhood and the Self
Many of the respondents had grown up around able-bodied
siblings and friends and described their childhoods as "sta-
ble." Some reported not being particularly aware of their
impairment in childhood, and interacting with their siblings
on an equal footing. As they grew older and were influenced
by other people, however, they began to feel different.
We [brother and I] used to play with friends' children around us.
I never thought I was blind. But only when my father used to say
when I passed from one room to the other, when his friends used
to come he used to say, "She can't see." I did not know English
much, but there was some association. Because whenever I
passed my father used to say this. But what is that "she can't
see" I could not understand, but there was some association with
that. But I didn't know what it was. (D03, 50 years, visual
impairment)
Most of the women with visual impairment had attended
"sighted" schools with teachers who were supportive of their
needs. In contrast, women with locomotor impairment
reported feeling more isolated and had their schooling dis-
rupted because of the need for medical treatment and time in
hospital. Institutional discrimination in the form of unequal
access to education was reported by a few respondents who
struggled to gain admission to regular schools or to take
exams. This was usually due to an inability to accommodate
the girl's needs, a fear that she might have an accident, or
concerns that "she won't be able to keep up with the normal
students." In the family environment, women described early
experiences of feeling "not accepted," first, because of gen-
der, and then because of disability: "When I was born there
was no acceptance. First of all she is a girl, and then she is
blind." They described how their parents' disappointment at
having a daughter was compounded by the discovery that she
also had a physical impairment:
I was born normal but [even] from then only I was not accepted.
Before me [were] three daughters, so there was no happiness, no
enthusiasm when I was born. Then, when I was two or one-and-
a-half years, I got polio. After getting polio I was completely
unacceptable. Completely unacceptable. They did not accept me
and then they sent me away to my maternal grandmother's
house. (D08, 43 years, locomotor impairment)
Few of the respondents reported severe physical violence
during childhood.Although being hit on the legs by a teacher,
smacked by a mother for disobedience, or being yelled at by
a father were events that "put a lot of fear into us," they were
considered "very, very minor incidents of violence." More
common were neglect and verbal abuse, at home and at
school, largely driven by attitudes to disability.
My mother and father did not pay me much attention. Sometimes
my aunt would look after me. When I fell ill, she admitted me to
the hospital but no one from my family came to look after me.
(D14, 20 years, locomotor and visual impairment)
The impact of such events on women's self-perception
meant that some "began to believe it." While some parents
took measures to protect their daughters from accidents, oth-
ers denied them the opportunities enjoyed by other siblings
because they "did not see the need for me to go out or have
things." Derogatory comments from peers and family
reflected a belief that disabled children were incapable and
unemployable:
In my childhood, there were comments I faced from my family.
It was verbal. I remember [my father's sister] used to call me
4 SAGE Open
"phutki" [damaged] . . . In school also we had to listen to
comments like, "Blind people are going to become beggars
only--that is your future." So that used to make us feel like,
really we are not capable of anything . . . " (D01, 30 years, visual
impairment)
Parents who felt that a daughter with locomotor impair-
ment was of little use seldom offered encouragement or con-
sidered ways in which they could help her overcome the
challenges of living with her impairment. In extreme cases,
parents thought that disabled daughters were better off dead:
[My father] felt what should he do with me, she is very nice,
but what to do with her? They never thought about me in a way
that I could do anything on my own and that we can help her to
do that. They could not understand that responsibility. They
never wondered what I want to do; they did not think that I
would be able to do anything. He used to feel that dying was
the best possible option for me. (D08, 43 years, locomotor
impairment)
Less extreme measures for dealing with the stigmatizing
effect of having a disabled child in the family included keep-
ing her out of sight:
I remember my father's sister . . . she was very bad. When guests
would come she would not let me come out, I could not meet
them. She would make me sit in one corner. She would not let
me go in front of the guests so that they would not come to know
that there is a blind child in the house. (D01, 30 years, visual
impairment)
Sexual "misbehavior," usually by members of the
extended family, was not unknown and ranged from "gaz-
ing" to inappropriate touching. Episodes of sexual violence
often went unreported, either because parents disregarded
them or because they held their daughters responsible. In
situations where the abuse was likely to continue, some
women had felt that their only option was to leave home:
I don't go home now. My Mama's [maternal uncle's] gaze was
not good. I tried to inform my mother but she just wouldn't listen
to me. I also told my grandparents in Bombay about my Mama.
They told me to stay away [from him]. I haven't gone home now
since eighth standard. (D12, 24 years, visual impairment)
Importantly, in the context of childhood, sexual violence
was constructed not only as the act itself, but also in terms of
the unwillingness of parents to acknowledge it:
By seventh or eighth standard . . . there were instances of
[sexual] misbehavior with me [at home] around that time, but I
could never share. When it first happened I told my mother
about it, but she said that it must be my fault that it happened. So
after that I never told her anything . . . when someone misbehaves
with you and you tell your family and they don't believe you,
that is also violence. Both are violence: the misbehavior and the
not believing. (D10, 20 years, visual impairment)
Many of the experiences in childhood continued into
adulthood. Accounts of physical abuse and mistreatment in
adulthood were less common, though, than other forms of
violence. In light of a widespread popular belief about physi-
cal violence that "such things happen in all families," the
focus on articulating other forms of abuse suggested that
women found them equally distressing. The anticipation of
possible physical violence, especially within the marital
home, the temporal nature of injuries caused by it, and the
incomprehensibility of inflicting psychological, emotional,
and economic violence on a wife might explain why respon-
dents emphasized them in their narrative accounts. When
physical violence did occur, it was usually in a milieu of
emotional, psychological, and economic violence.
Respondents' constructions of their identities were influ-
enced by social constructions of disability, their own experi-
ences of living with a physical impairment, and the attitudes
and behavior of those they interacted with. Emotional, psy-
chological, and physical self-violence could not be under-
stood as isolated acts; they were as much impacts as they
were behaviors. Self-defeating beliefs and negative con-
structions of the self were common, particularly among
women who had endured persistent physical or psychologi-
cal violence. Being constantly spoken down to or treated as
disabled tended to lead to an internalized stigmatization of
one's own disability. Feelings about the impact of their phys-
ical impairment on their family, and being made to feel a
burden, led some women to self-blame and a sense that "I am
the problem." Within marriage, strategies to deal with the
pressure of bearing children, together with fears about them
inheriting an impairment, included anticipating separation
from the husband to bring up a child alone.
At least three respondents reported contemplating or
attempting suicide. One was motivated by the fact that her
family had considered her disability so undesirable (beside
her gender) that her father had wanted her to die, and another
explained that
. . . if I was a burden on everyone, if I was causing all my loved
ones so many problems I should just go away from the scene.
Then I attempted to kill myself but it was my misfortune that I
survived. (D08, 43 years, locomotor impairment)
Intimate partner violence
Women's experiences of domestic violence included emo-
tional and verbal insults, withholding money, threats of aban-
donment or physical violence, and actual physical violence.
They were rarely one-off occurrences and typically involved
a combination of several types of violence over a period.
Spousal alcohol use, forced marriage, disputes with in-laws
and the tendency for husbands to take their mothers' side,
and suspicions of infidelity were described as key factors.
Although the respondents themselves did not perceive their
disability as a causal factor, it was an additional dimension to
their experiences of violence:
Daruwalla et al. 5
My husband drinks. He never paid the rent of the house we were
living in. For 1 year he did not give rent and all the things in my
house were taken away. I lost everything I had brought from my
maternal home. Is this the way to manage a married life? . . .You tell
me, does he have no responsibility? I have been married to him for 9
years. I was 17 years of age. I was blind and my parents were in a
hurry to get me married off. He is a sighted man. When he married
me he knew I was blind. Then why did he marry me if he can't
behave properly towards me? (D11, 28 years, visual impairment)
The most vulnerable women seemed to be those who
were married off at an early age by parents who no longer
wanted to take responsibility for them or were concerned
about their ineligibility as wives: the families of able-bodied
men often had strong reservations, such as a belief that the
marriage would fail, "a fear of the unknown," or the percep-
tion that a disabled person's home is a "sad house." These
stigmatized attitudes sometimes continued after marriage:
Right from the beginning, she [my mother-in-law] and her
family were against their son marrying a blind girl. There was no
acceptance . . . My mother-in-law told them [her family], "She is
not married to my son." (D11, 28 years, visual impairment)
The husband's authoritative role in the household was a
commonly described feature of marital relations, and even a
supportive husband "keeps control of everything."
My husband keeps control of everything. Sometimes he will ask
me to spend. My daughter got married. I wanted to give
something to her. She wanted a pair of bangles. I said we will
give her. When there is a need and there is a happy occasion we
should give her. If we can't give at this time then what is the
point of having that money? I felt very bad. At that time I
couldn't give her anything. She spent her money. Having my
own income I couldn't give. I felt very bad. It's a feeling of
complete helplessness . . . (D03, 50 years, visual impairment)
Minor marital conflicts, quarrels, and attempts to hurt each
other emotionally were not usually considered violent, although
physical violence was more likely if a wife's behavior trans-
gressed acceptable gender norms or caused suspicion:
. . . He beat me up till I was bruised. He had never beaten me
like that before. We used to have verbal quarrels but this was
very bad . . . When he got suspicious of my friend he beat me up
very badly . . . He had never beaten me like this before. He
dragged me out of the house and beat me. I was in a state of
panic and shock. (D11, 28 years, visual impairment)
Violence in the natal family
Respondents were vulnerable to violence from natal families
in a variety of ways. Women who had defied their family's
wishes--for example, by marrying across religions--
described suffering psychological and physical violence,
typically from a father or brother. Although it was difficult to
know the degree to which disability might have been related
to the violence, it was evident that gender and physical
impairment were used to make violent threats:
They started hitting me. At that time I was sitting on this slab
with wheels and I fell down. When I got up, they hit it again and
it went towards the steps, but I stopped it. I would have got hurt
. . . My youngest brother said that they could harm me more than
this, they would harm my child also, and told me not to complain
to the police, they also told me that they had more strength than
me. (D08, 43 years, locomotor impairment)
Other forms of family violence included abandonment
and exclusion. Women perceived the stigma associated with
their impairments and the resulting social exclusion as acts
and impacts of violence, as they caused them to be and feel
excluded. Similarly, women who were deprived of agency
experienced a reinforced sense of "being" disabled and feel-
ings of isolation and helplessness:
When [my brother and his wife] go out they don't take me. They
leave me back, alone [starts crying]. They just leave me and go
away. When I tell them they say, "We will not take you. What
will you do?" There is nothing I can do. They do go away
leaving me here . . . [They say], "I don't like to take you out with
me. I won't take you." I am alone. I don't have a choice. If I had
a choice I wouldn't live in this house. But I don't have a choice.
And they make sure that I realize that. [They say] "Aye, you are
handicapped. Do as I tell you. Eat what we tell you to. Live like
we tell you to." Kabool [I accept]. There is nothing I can do,
right? When my father was alive, all of us brothers and sisters
did everything together. I never felt I was handicapped [crying].
I never felt like that. But now every moment they make me feel
that I am handicapped. Now I have begun to feel that, yes I am
handicapped. (D07, 57 years, locomotor impairment)
Stigma was typically related to being ashamed of having
a disabled person in the family or being "worried about what
people will say." Discrimination often originated from the
common belief that disabled people "don't have the capac-
ity" to do things, or the view that, "she is blind so she is use-
less." The notion that disabled people are more prone to
accidents led some parents--albeit with genuine concern
to protect their daughters--to deny them the opportunity to
learn mobility techniques or travel by train, even if they
expressed a desire for independence. Exclusion from family
affairs often continued into adulthood. Besides a feeling of
neglect, this was interpreted as ostracism:
[My younger brother and his family] never say, "She is a
member of our family. And this is a family function so she must
be taken along." The fact that you [younger brother and his
family] don't take me along means that you don't consider me
a part of your family. You neglect me . . . My brother's son came
from the US. Everyone went to the hotel to eat. They did not
take me. Why? Because his wife told them, "I feel ashamed of
her." So everyone left me and went to the hotel.And I understood
that they do not consider me family. (D06, 57 years, locomotor
impairment)
6 SAGE Open
Experiences of violence from family members did not
depend on physical acts or overtly abusive behavior, and
were often more subtle:
[My family] would never say a word, an abusive word, but they
made you feel like that . . . You can make out in the way someone
welcomes you and even if someone does not welcome you but
just negates you. Negating you is just terrible. And then on my
birthday, to come and wish me happy birthday when they
negated me at every other time. When no one has even spoken to
me before my birthday for 4 days, especially when my heart is
dying to talk to you, to be loved by you, then how would I feel?
(D08, 43 years, locomotor impairment)
Violence in public spaces
Physical challenges and perceptions of women with disability
as defenseless made them easy targets. Verbal and physical
sexual harassment by strangers occurred in public spaces,
trains, and buses. Women were vulnerable to exploitation
because of their dependence on others for support and, possi-
bly, as a result of men perceiving them as sexually available:
Harassment happens in public. People have behaved badly [with
me] while traveling in public transport. Or under the excuse of
helping me people have done weird things. Even in private
transport there is harassment. Recently an incident happened
and so I remember. I took an auto to reach college and just at the
gate of the college he [rickshaw driver] touched me here [points
to her breasts]. (D10, 20 years, visual impairment)
Behavior that would usually be unacceptable in public
might be spuriously legitimized by the need to "help":
. . . In most cases, the men, they hold our hand, they run their
fingers over us. When we tell them to hold the stick, they say
directly, "Why don't you let us hold your hand?" . . . Then
sometimes they touch us, put their hands around our shoulders
while passing us or crossing us. They sometimes make dirty
comments. (D01, 30 years, visual impairment)
Violence from society
Discrimination targeted specifically at disability was inherent
in many of the respondents' narratives. Structural forms of
violence included inequalities in access to work opportunities
in private or public institutions, and some respondents had
been denied jobs and social support. General discriminatory
attitudes of potential employers toward women with impair-
ments were often explained as concerns that they would not
be able to "keep up" with colleagues, would be less produc-
tive, or would be incapable of completing the work.
The government departments that I have had to work with
initially were resistant and didn't want to take me on . . . I would
always be confronted with questions, "What can you do? Why
are you here?" (D05, 35 years, visual impairment)
In the absence of accommodating environments and facil-
ities for people with disability, women were usually expected
to manage on their own. They often felt that requests and
complaints were met with indifference or were not taken as
seriously as they would have been if they had not had an
impairment.
I was searching for a job as well as pursuing some courses I
thought would be useful. However, the response I heard from
people made me feel that there is no use to all my education. I
began to feel that blind people have no option but to keep
studying all their life. Despite having education nobody wants to
give a job to blind people. (D01, 30 years, visual impairment)
Some women perceived that institutional discrimination
was directed at their disability more than their gender:
Usually the police are very rude and indifferent to the blind
person. Suppose something happens, then the police will say to
the blind person, "How will you recognize a person? How can
we catch the person?" (D03, 50 years, visual impairment)
Disability was an additional layer of violence on top of
widespreadgenderbias,adouble-discrimination.Respondents
felt that people often assumed them to be incapable of doing
everyday activities, fulfilling expected gender roles and par-
ticipating in education or work life. This perception included
the belief that they were "dumb" and not to be taken seriously.
Some people also considered women with disability to be a
burden, or as individuals deserving pity or sympathy:
I think people feel that if you are a girl and you are blind, you
have no brains and you cannot understand anything. I mean, I
don't know, how do they think like this? There is no respect.
And the opinion about girls is also not great to start with. Then
they wonder how will a girl accomplish anything? So in the
context of a blind girl this factor of what will she achieve in life
is very high. Then they say, "Arre arre, bichari [oh, poor thing]
. . . She looks beautiful but she is blind." And I feel, what is the
connection between looking beautiful and being blind? (D10, 20
years, visual impairment)
The impact of violence
Naturally, physical violence led to a fear of further beatings
and a sense of vulnerability. Social exclusion and isolation
from the family, neglect, and being made to feel a "burden"--
"I am the problem"--led to psychological and physical dis-
tress, and more than one respondent had attempted suicide:
I become hysterical. The thought stays in my head--it doesn't
go away. I keep thinking, they are neglecting me, they are
neglecting me. My blood pressure rises. I try very hard but the
thought doesn't leave my head. My nature is like this. I cannot
change it. I feel really very bad. I cannot control myself. Life is
miserable. Nobody is fighting for me. (D07, 57 years, locomotor
impairment)
Daruwalla et al. 7
Notions of disability that reduced women to deficiencies
related to their physical impairment ran the risk that, "one
then doesn't want to try, and becomes quiet and loses inter-
est." These attitudes played an important role in influencing
how respondents viewed themselves and what they felt they
were and were not able to do. Although many felt that they
were capable of cooking and traveling alone, any negative
self-perceptions they held were likely to be further reinforced
by a lack of encouragement and autonomy:
I can do everything. I can even cook. I clean. I manage myself.
So how can I be handicapped? Let me give you an example:
breakfast and tea is made in the house for everyone. The same
breakfast and tea is made for me. So food is made for everyone.
They are not handicapped but food is made for them right? Then
why do they say to me that food and tea is being made for me
because I am handicapped? Then it takes on a different
implication: that we have to do it for you because you cannot do
it for yourself. (D07, 57 years, locomotor impairment)
Another effect was a reinforcement of beliefs such as "I
must be disabled." The cumulative impact of attitudes and
behaviors was experienced in at least two dimensions. It was
detrimental to the woman's self-confidence and was likely to
result in a deprivation of opportunities:
. . . Even a handicapped person has ability, and people treat
them in this way then a handicapped person will not want to
even use that much ability that she has. (D08, 43 years, locomotor
impairment)
Responses and Coping
While some women strove to prove themselves capable, or
to "be like normal women," others restricted their mobility
and life choices.
It's definitely restricting, it's limiting. There are also certain
restrictions and limitations that I have also imposed on myself.
For instance, I have not . . . even though I have gone through
mobility training, I have not chosen to travel on my own, and so
I still have somebody who travels with me. So it is sometimes a
lot . . . anxiety-provoking, since I am dependent on somebody
for help. (D05, 35 years, visual impairment)
The pressure of proving oneself to be accepted and treated
with some degree of normality fell on the women themselves:
In experiences with education I decided that I have to prove
myself and my capabilities. Since I have a disability, I am left
with no option but to prove myself and I did that. So all the hard
work that I could do, I did, without complaining. So I coped
fairly well with my studies. (D01, 30 years, visual impairment)
Some women used problem-focused coping strategies to
carry out tasks that would usually be done by sighted people,
partly to prove themselves. Others worked to limit their
distress by accepting, for example, family requests to restrict
their mobility.
My sister-in-law says you are not supposed to take any unwanted
risks. That is the reason I don't go out of the house. She also says
to avoid the risk. Till the moment it is possible to avoid the risk.
(D02, 38 years, visual impairment)
Discussion
In qualitative interviews with women with disability, the
common motifs were an idea of not being accepted by their
families, childhood formation of a dependent self-image, and
an expectation of limited achievement. Respondents' con-
structions of their identities were influenced by social con-
structions of disability, their own experiences of living with
impairment, and the attitudes and behavior of those they
interacted with. Violence was rarely one-off, and usually a
combination of emotional and physical abuse over time.
Structural violence was a pervasive concern. Women's narra-
tives were characterized by difficulties in resolving their
identities against concerted disapproval and internalized
guilt.
One of the central findings was the complexity of the idea
of violence. First, women who did not report physical vio-
lence nevertheless articulated many of their experiences as
violence, the most obvious examples being their descriptions
of the structural violence inherent in social norms. There is a
taxonomic challenge here: Is the concern of a woman with
visual impairment that she will not be able to complete a
PhD--because of logistic and social challenges--a violent
experience? At what point does the lived experience of ineq-
uity become violence, and is there a danger of the debate
becoming a competition for what counts? Second, we formed
the--somewhat provocative--impression that for some
women, the psychological effects of nonphysical violence
were more pervasive. Perhaps this reflects the general tolera-
tion for domestic violence in Indian homes (Special Cell for
Women and Children, 1997, n.d.). Women with disability
who had been physically abused nevertheless dwelt more on
the cognitive and emotional effects of marginalization and
on the ambiguities in their loved-ones' attitudes: physical
assault is a nonambiguous form of communication.
By extension, the interconnectedness of forms of violence
causes problems in framing our idea of it. The ecological
model had the benefit of being simple to understand, but we
struggled to fit women's accounts neatly within it. For exam-
ple, a suicide attempt is a clear example of self-directed vio-
lence, but it arises from negative ideation linked with low
self-worth, emotional violence and marginalization, and
broader social mores. To fail to acknowledge each of these
levels of violence would be to miss important contributors to
a woman's well-being. It also has implications for recom-
mendations. Clearly, social change is necessary if we are to
validate the experiences of marginalized women and prevent
8 SAGE Open
violence against them: change at the level of policy, culture,
community, and familial behavior. What is more challenging
is to decide where to put the emphasis.
Women with disability often felt excluded from main-
stream activities. Growing up with impairment, many had
been left out of family functions, religious festivals, sports,
and extracurricular school activities. They had also been
teased and had limited numbers of friends. One of the out-
comes of a marginalized existence was invisibility, silence
being an epistemic form of violence. Women with disability
described experiences in which family members had negated
their identity or existence. This negation extends to all levels,
up to the Government, which responded only after nation-
wide protests from disability groups that they should be
included in a census and counted as citizens of India (Ghai,
2000a).
Most of the campaigns against violence have focused on
its occurrence in the marital home. Our findings suggest that
the supposedly protected environment of the natal home has
often been a site of violence. While women in general may
be prone to higher incidence of violence in natal homes than
their male siblings, women who are seen by their families as
different from the norm have faced particular violence in an
effort to minimize their perceived deviance. Our study shows
that women with disability faced violence in the form of
neglect, control, restricted mobility, forced marriages, and
lack of autonomy.
Conclusion
Women faced pressure from their natal families to conform,
and described experiences of having to "prove themselves
capable." Gender roles frame women's stay in their natal
homes as a precursor to their being given away to marital
homes. For women in general, and particularly for women
from marginalized communities, sustained efforts to pro-
mote independent living would go a long way in resisting
family violence. Campaigns around violence and laws pro-
tecting women from it, education and career guidance, sexu-
ality education, and housing schemes all need to be geared
toward equipping women to make life choices that protect
them from violence, live without fear of exclusion and dis-
crimination, and resist oppressive norms.
