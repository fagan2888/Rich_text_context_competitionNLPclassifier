ABSTRACT
Objective: Many recent policies focus on
socioeconomic inequities in availability of healthy food
stores and restaurants. Yet understanding of how
socioeconomic inequities vary across neighbourhood
racial composition and across the range from rural to
urban settings is limited, largely due to lack of large,
geographically and socio-demographically diverse
study populations. Using a national sample, the
authors examined differences in neighbourhood food
resource availability according to neighbourhood-level
poverty and racial/ethnic population in non-urban,
low-density urban and high-density urban areas.
Design: Cross-sectional data from an observational
cohort study representative of the US middle and high
school-aged population in 1994 followed into young
adulthood.
Participants: Using neighbourhood characteristics of
participants in the National Longitudinal Study of
Adolescent Health (Wave III, 2001e2002; n¼13 995
young adults aged 18e28 years representing 7588 US
block groups), the authors examined associations
between neighbourhood poverty and race/ethnicity
with neighbourhood food resource availability in
urbanicity-stratified multivariable linear regression.
Primary and secondary outcome
measures: Neighbourhood availability of grocery/
supermarkets, convenience stores and fast-food
restaurants (measured as number of outlets per
100 km roadway).
Results: Neighbourhood race and income disparities
were most pronounced in low-density urban areas,
where high-poverty/high-minority areas had lower
availability of grocery/supermarkets (b coefficient
(b)¼e1.91, 95% CI e2.73 to e1.09) and convenience
stores (b¼e2.38, 95% CI e3.62 to e1.14) and
greater availability of fast-food restaurants (b¼4.87,
95% CI 2.26 to 7.48) than low-poverty/low-minority
areas. However, in high-density urban areas, high-
poverty/low-minority neighbourhoods had
comparatively greater availability of grocery/
supermarkets (b¼8.05, 95% CI 2.52 to 13.57),
convenience stores (b¼2.89, 95% CI 0.64 to 5.14) and
fast-food restaurants (b¼4.03, 95% CI 1.97 to 6.09),
relative to low-poverty/low-minority areas.
Conclusions: In addition to targeting disproportionate
fast-food availability in disadvantaged dense urban
areas, our findings suggest that policies should also
target disparities in grocery/supermarket and fast-food
restaurant availability in low-density areas.
INTRODUCTION
National, state and local policies increasingly
focus on improving availability of healthy
foods in disadvantaged neighbourhoods.
Expectations that such policies will improve
diets in low-income and race/ethnic minority
populations stem from evidence that inequi-
table access to healthy foods may underlie
differentials in diet quality,1e4 obesity5 and

ARTICLE SUMMARY
Article focus
- Using national data, we examined whether
neighbourhood food resource availability exhibits
joint race and socioeconomic inequities across
levels of urbanicity.
Key messages
- Socio-demographic inequities in neighbourhood
food resource availability were most pronounced
in low-density urban (largely suburban) areas.
- In high-density urban areas, higher neighbour-
hood poverty was associated with greater
availability of all food resources.
- Whereas policy has focused on dense urban
settings, less urban areas might also benefit
from policies addressing food access.
Strengths and limitations of this study
- While business records provide comparable data
across the USA, these data may contain error
and do not indicate availability of specific foods.
- National coverage enabled examination of the
joint role of neighbourhood race and socioeco-
nomic status across urban strata within a single
study.

related diseases by income and race/ethnicity (see
reviews6e11). However, understanding the extent to
which inequities in different types of food resources exist
in different types of the US communities is limited by
several factors.
First, research has focused on `food deserts', generally
defined as areas with limited access to affordable fresh
foods from supermarkets (see reviews8e11). Subse-
quently, `food swamps',12 13 characterised as neigh-
bourhoods with disproportionate access to convenient,
energy-dense nutrient-poor foods sold by convenience
stores and fast-food restaurants, emerged as important
dimensions of the food environment. Thus, attention to
a variety of food resources, such as supermarkets,
convenience stores and fast-food restaurants, may be
a more useful approach to examining neighbourhood
food access.11 14 15
Second, most existing food access initiatives target low-
income dense urban areas, yet inequities in access to
healthy foods may be even more pronounced in
suburban and rural areas due to greater dispersion of
resources and car-dependent infrastructure.14 In addi-
tion, geographic distribution of food outlets relative to
homes, transportation infrastructure and other
resources differs across urbanicity,16 17 perhaps due to
differences in travel times to community resources18 and
population density. Yet few studies examine how ineq-
uities in availability of food resources might vary by
urbanicity,9 19e21 and limited understanding relies on
comparisons across small geographically specific study
populations (eg, New Orleans compared with Texas
colonias). Generalisable understanding requires large
national study populations.
Third, allocation of food resources according to
income has received the most focus, with some exami-
nation of race/ethnic differences. Consideration of
neighbourhood socioeconomic status alone has not
yielded consistent results,15 22e24 which suggest that
other neighbourhood characteristics underlie food
resource allocation. Patterning by race/ethnicity may
further compound patterning according to income and
would underscore the importance of culturally sensitive
policies. However, the joint role of neighbourhood race/
ethnic composition and neighbourhood income has
received little attention.25
Using Geographic Information Systems-derived
neighbourhood characteristics from a national sample of
13 995 young adults across the USA provides variation
and sufficient sample size to examine disparities in
neighbourhood food resource availability according to
income, race/ethnicity and urbanicity. We examined the
joint role of neighbourhood race/ethnic composition
and neighbourhood poverty across non-urban, low-
density urban and high-density urban areas. Specifically,
we tested whether individuals living in neighbourhoods
composed of populations with high proportions of
impoverished and minority residents had lower avail-
ability of grocery/supermarkets and greater availability of
fast-food restaurants and convenience stores (compared
with lower poverty areas with high proportion of non-
Hispanic white populations), and whether this distribu-
tion varied across less urban and more urban areas.
METHODS
Study population and data sources
Our study sample is derived from respondents aged
18e24 years who participated in Wave III (2001e2002)
of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health
(Add Health), a nationally representative prospective
cohort study of adolescents of the US school-based
population in grades 7e12 (11e22 years of age) in
1994e1995 who are followed into adulthood (Wave III).
Subjects eligible for inclusion in the analytic sample
included 14 322 Wave III young adults with sample
weights. The Add Health sample was collected under
protocols approved by the Institutional Review Board at
the University of North Carolina. The survey design and
sampling frame have been discussed elsewhere.26 27
We used the Add Health Obesity and Neighbourhood
Environment database (ONEdata), a Geographic
Information System that includes time-varying commu-
nity-level data geographically linked to respondent resi-
dential addresses geocoded with street-segment matches
(n¼13 039), global positioning system measurements
(n¼1204) and ZIP/ZIP+4/ZIP+2 centroid match
(n¼685). Attributes of areas within 1, 3, 5 and 8.05 km of
each respondent location (neighbourhood buffers) and
block group, tract and county attributes from time-
matched US Census and other federal sources were
merged with individual-level Add Health interview
responses.28 The number of census block groups
(n¼7588) represents 3.6% of 2000 US Census block
groups.
Of 14 322 Wave III respondents with sample weights,
327 (2.3%) with missing food environment or the US
census data were excluded, leaving an analytic sample of
13 995.
Study variables
Geographic Information Systems-derived neighbourhood data
For our central analysis, we used residential locations
linked to attributes of areas within 3 km straight-line
distance (Euclidean buffer) and along the street network
(street network buffer) surrounding each respondent's
residential location in Wave III (2001). The 3 km buffer
was designed to capture distances readily accessible by
walking and driving to neighbourhood diet- and activity-
related resources.2 3 29 30 Comparative analyses were
conducted with 1 and 8 km buffers. Neighbourhood
food environment, socio-demographic and urban indi-
cator data were merged with individual-level Add Health
interview data.
Food environment
Food resource data were obtained from Dun and Brad-
street, a commercial data set of the US businesses. Food

resources were classified according to 4- and 8-digit
Standard Industrial Classification codes. Three cate-
gories of food resources were used: (1) fast-food restau-
rants, defined as fast-food chain and non-chain
restaurants, excluding food stands and cafeterias; (2)
grocery stores and supermarkets, defined as indepen-
dent and chain grocery stores and supermarkets and (3)
convenience stores, defined as variety and convenience
stores and food stores attached to gasoline filling
stations. Full details are described in online appendix A.
We characterised neighbourhood food resource avail-
ability as the count of each type of resource per roadway
distance within a 3 km street network buffer, which
represents availability to resources relative to the street
network and potentially reflects routes of travel.31 While
others have used measures such as the modified retail
food environment index,32 which measures the avail-
ability of healthy relative to unhealthy food stores, ratio
measures may obscure differential variation across food
outlet types. Since this is a major focus of the current
study, we use absolute measures of fast food, conve-
nience stores and supermarkets and examine each
resource type separately. In addition, by controlling for
population density, we capture resources relative to what
might be expected with respect to population distribu-
tion. Given the variation in classification of the food
environment in the literature (see review33), we present
findings across several different food environment
measures (eg, count per population, distance to nearest
outlet).
Given the importance of scaling resources by general
urban development, we created measures of resources
per 100 km of secondary/connecting and local neigh-
bourhood and rural roads using street data obtained
from StreetMap Pro (July 2003, V.5.2) data from Envi-
ronmental Systems Research Institute (http://www.esri.
com) in Redlands, California, USA. We selected the 3 km
street network buffer after evaluating associations with
resource availability and sensitivity of buffer size. We thus
defined neighbourhood food resource availability as the
number of outlets per 100 km of roadway within a 3 km
network buffer to account for differences in food
resource counts according to the amount of commercial
activity in an area.
Neighbourhood socio-demographics
Census block groups were used to define neighbour-
hoods because smaller units are more likely to adhere to
individually perceived neighbourhood boundaries34 and
are more socio-demographically homogeneous. Using
the federal definition of `poverty area',35 36 we dicho-
tomised neighbourhood poverty into >20% or #20% of
population below the federal poverty level. We defined
neighbourhood minority population as percentage of
population of non-Hispanic white race/ethnicity and
neighbourhood-level education as percentage of popu-
lation $25 years with college or greater education. While
other studies have used a neighbourhood deprivation
index to provide an `empirical summary of total area-
level variance explained by the census variables',37 we
investigated neighbourhood race/ethnicity and income
as separate constructs. We focus on these two specific
characteristics to address the theoretical processes of
resource placement in areas with greater purchasing
power (income) and political leverage associated with
the majority race. To evaluate potential interaction of
neighbourhood poverty status with minority population,
we created a categorical variable: (1) low poverty/low
minority, (2) high poverty/low minority, (3) low
poverty/medium minority, (4) high poverty/medium
minority, (5) low poverty/high minority and (6) high
poverty/high minority.
Neighbourhood urbanicity
Most studies characterise urbanicity based on population
density.19 We improve on such traditional definitions by
using the US Census-defined urbanised areas (UAs) that
were used to classify residential locations as non-urban
(outside UA) or urban (inside UA). Within urban areas,
we used Fragstats38 software with the US Geologic Survey
National Landcover Data to distinguish: (1) low-density
(#95% (75th percentile) developed land cover) and (2)
high-density (>95% developed land cover) urban areas
based on the area of developed land as a proportion of
total area within 3 km after excluding water and ice. Our
measure of developed land cover provides an indicator
of urban development that is independent of population
density and correctly classifies areas as within or outside
the UA (receiver operating characteristic curve
area¼0.937).
Statistical analysis
Descriptive analysis
Availability of food resources and socio-demographic
characteristics were compared across non-urban,
low-density urban and high-density urban strata. We
examined urbanicity-specific tertiles of neighbourhood
minority population (table 2) to address non-linear
associations with food resource availability measures. All
statistical analyses were weighted for national represen-
tation and corrected for complex survey design using
Stata V.11.1 (Stata Corp).
Multivariable regression analysis
We fit multivariable linear regression models to predict
food resource availability as a function of neighbour-
hood poverty and minority population where our
constructed variable combining neighbourhood poverty
(high and low) with levels of minority population (low,
medium, high) explicitly estimates interactions relative
to the theoretically most advantaged neighbourhoods
(low poverty/low minority). Given that food resources
and neighbourhood socio-demographics varied dramat-
ically across urbanicity, comparability across socio-
demographic and geographic subpopulations was
difficult, even with our large sample size. Nonetheless,
we have large samples of individuals and block groups

across urbanicity strata, with adequate variation across
neighbourhood socio-demographics (table 1). All
models were weighted for national representation,
corrected for clustering on our primary sampling unit
(schools) and controlled for continuous neighbour-
hood-level education and population density dichotom-
ised into urbanicity-specific quantiles. Given that schools
and census block groups are not geographically nested,
we did not use multilevel analysis. Furthermore, multi-
level analysis of unbalanced sparse data within census
block groups can result in biased estimates.39
To aid interpretation of the model results, we used the
estimated model coefficients to predict food resource
availability across levels of neighbourhood-level poverty
and minority population within the low-density urban
stratum, where the strongest disparities were observed.
Comparative analyses
In order to assess whether different neighbourhood
buffer sizes were needed in urban versus non-urban
areas, we compared and found similar patterns for the
1 km buffer in urban areas and the 8 km buffer in non-
urban areas. In addition, we assessed alternate measures
of food resource availability to compare our main
measure findings with commonly used though concep-
tually different metrics: count per population2 and
distance to nearest outlet.4 14 40 Specifically, we
contrasted our roadway-scaled measure with: (1) density
of food resources per 10 000 population within 3 km
Euclidean buffer and (2) minimum distance to the
single nearest food resource within 8 km Euclidean
buffer. We repeated identical multivariable regression
models with alternate measures, except models with
population-scaled measures did not control for popula-
tion density. Results for food resources per 100 km of
roadway within a 3 km network buffer are presented in
text, while results for all other measures are shown in
online appendices B and C.
RESULTS
Neighbourhood availability of grocery/supermarkets,
convenience stores and fast-food restaurants varied
dramatically across non-urban, low-density urban and
high-density urban areas, with greater availability in
high-density urban areas (table 2).
In multivariable analysis, availability of grocery/
supermarkets and convenience stores for low-density
urban residents did not differ according to neighbour-
hood poverty; rather, lower availability of food stores was
observed with greater minority populations (table 3).
Food stores were more equitably allocated in non-urban
neighbourhoods. Interestingly, greater availability of
food stores was often found in high-density urban areas
with high proportions of low-income residents, but this
relationship with neighbourhood income did not hold
in neighbourhoods with high proportion of minority
residents.
Fast-food availability was greater for residents in high-
poverty neighbourhoods, with strongest associations in
low- and high-density urban areas (table 3). Among
those living in neighbourhoods with high poverty,
greater minority population incurred additional
inequities in food resource availability, particularly in
low-density urban areas. In a notable exception, in high-
density urban, high-minority areas, fast food was less
available in high-poverty neighbourhoods.
Figure 1 presents predicted food resource availability
(based on the table 3 models) and more clearly illus-
trates the differential associations with poverty versus
race/ethnicity in non-urban, low-density urban and
high-density urban areas.
In general, estimated patterns of disparities were very
similar between roadway-scaled, population density and
distance measures (online appendices B and C).
DISCUSSION
We assessed inequities in grocery/supermarket, conve-
nience store and fast-food restaurant availability by
neighbourhood poverty and minority population in
a large diverse national sample of residential neigh-
bourhoods of young adults, representing 7588 census
block groups (3.6% of 2000 US Census block groups).
Our findings suggest that inequities in neighbourhood
food resource availability do exist, but not always where
prior research suggests. In particular, racial and income
disparities in availability of grocery/supermarkets were

far more apparent in low-density urban areas than in
high-density urban areas, where food deserts have been
shown to exist.23 41e43 In an unexpected finding, areas
with high-poverty and high-minority population also
have lower availability of convenience stores, which
typically provide largely energy-dense nutrient-poor
foods.44 45 Greater availability of fast food in areas with
high-poverty rates and high-minority population was
more consistent across non-urban, low-density urban
and high-density urban areas.
Differences in availability of grocery/supermarkets,
convenience stores and fast-food restaurants were most
consistent in low-density urban areas, which include the
largest proportion of our sample and theoretically
captures suburban America. In the USA, we also note
that the distribution of poverty has shifted away from the
dense inner cities. Data from the 2010 census suggest
that counter to the assumption of `White Flight' out of
inner cities, racial minorities, foreign-born and low-
income people were more likely to live in metropolitan
suburbs in 2010 than the cities they lived in during
2008.46 Thus, the income and race/ethnic disparities in
neighbourhood food resource availability observed in
low-density urban areas in our 2001 data may become
much more important as poor and minority populations
increasingly reside in suburban neighbourhoods. Our
findings suggest that in addition to increasing grocery
store availability and limiting fast-food availability in
disadvantaged dense urban areas, rural and suburban
areas should be targeted for food environment
improvements. While this idea has been suggested by
a series of studies in rural Texas,20 our national study
further supports more focus on rural and suburban food
environments.
Relationships between food resource availability,
neighbourhood poverty and minority population were
notably distinct in high-density urban areas. It is possible
that fewer significant findings in high-density urban
areas might reflect lower statistical power due to smaller
sample size (1935 high-density urban vs 4132 low-density
urban block groups) or greater variability in high-density
urban relative to other areas. Yet, the pattern of findings
suggests variation across the spectrum of urbanicity.
First, our finding of greater availability of grocery stores

and convenience stores in high- versus low-poverty areas,
but only in areas with predominately white populations,
suggests the presence of complex economic and social
drivers in where food stores choose to locate. Second,
fast-food availability was generally greater in high-
poverty, high-minority areas, but this was not true in
high-minority, high-density urban areas. This finding is
consistent with prior evidence11 47 that perceived or real
racial tensions or safety concerns may also influence
opening and closure of food establishments.
Findings using our main roadway-scaled measures and
population density measures were nearly identical as they
likely capture resources scaled by commercialisation and
development indicated by population and roadways.
Slight inconsistencies in results for the minimum distance
measures may reflect greater variation that results from
using a single data point (nearest outlet) to characterise
availability compared with incorporating data from
multiple food resources within an area. Minimum
distance measures also do not account for differential
distribution of food resources according to the popula-
tion and development density.
Strengths and limitations
This study did not look at extreme poverty nor consider
a large array of other factors linked with urbanicity. It is
possible that disparities in food resources in dense urban
areas may be evident only under extreme neighbour-
hood poverty that we did not examine in our analysis.
More refined analyses of dynamic effects among social
and economic environments and food resources are
beyond the scope of the present analysis, though they
certainly warrant further attention. Moreover, other
factors such as crime,47 aesthetics,47 travel time48 or
proximity to other resources47 could also relate to actual
or perceived access to food resources.
The benefit of business record data, which provides
comparative national food resource data, must be
balanced with their limitations. Business record
data contain error, which can bias results either towards
the null if misclassification is non-differential or away
from the null in the case of differential misclassification.
It is also possible that the accuracy of business records
varies by area socio-demographics and/or urban-
icity.49e53 Neighbourhood audits (street-by-street data
collection by researchers) better capture broader
dimensions of food access, such as food prices or
cultural preferences, but they are not feasible for large
national samples across thousands of census blocks
groups. These intense audits are generally performed in
smaller geographic areas and thus preclude broad
comparisons across neighbourhood type and socio-
demographics. We were unable to ascertain food sold at
each establishment and relied on generalisations
regarding healthy (grocery/supermarket) versus
unhealthy (convenience store, fast-food restaurant)
types of establishments.
Although supercentres have recently gained a signifi-
cant share of the food retailing market, during the
contemporaneous study period, supercentres held only

a minority proportion of the household purchases
compared with grocery stores and supermarkets.54
Furthermore, access to supercentres often requires
driving outside the residential neighbourhoods, given
their size and placement. For these reasons, supercentres
were not addressed.
Furthermore, due to lower participation of illegal
immigrants in the census, the US census data may
underestimate neighbourhood minority population and
poverty. Our 3 km network residential neighbourhood
buffer may not accurately reflect food purchasing areas
for different urban settings and socio-demographic
subgroups; this is a topic worthy for future study. In
addition, this is a cross-sectional study and thus does not
capture changes in food environments over time.
Despite these limitations, our study is an essential step
in understanding the allocation of theoretically healthy
and less healthy food resources across social and
geographic space over the entire USA, and our findings
can inform measurement and design in future individual-
level and longitudinal studies. Our study benefits from
the variation in neighbourhoods of a large population
that enables comparisons across multiple socio-demo-
graphic and urban strata within a single study. Further-
more, our study capitalises upon national data with
roadway-scaled measures of neighbourhood food
resource availability within 3 km residential network
buffers for each observation. In addition, we used detailed
measures of urbanicity derived both from the US census
and land cover data allowing a more refined urban/rural
classification than the traditional urban/rural dichotomy.
In sum, our study benefits from several innovations and
depth of coverage that has been heretofore unaddressed
in a large geographically diverse study.
Policy implications
Many state and national efforts focus on providing
healthy eating options for poor inner-city neighbour-
hoods, many with high-minority populations. Strategies
include providing produce carts in low-income neigh-
bourhoods in New York City,55 directly or indirectly
subsidising supermarkets,56e59 banning fast-food restau-
rant construction in selected urban areas,60 as well as
legislation considered at the national level.61 Our results
suggest that less urban areas might benefit from similar
policies.
Conclusions
Our findings suggest that common assumptions
regarding income and race/ethnic subpopulation
disparities in food resources may not be universally true
across the spectrum of urbanicity. We observed an asso-
ciation between greater neighbourhood poverty and
minority population with greater availability of fast-food
restaurants in urban areas. Conversely, disparities
in grocery/supermarkets were primarily observed in
low-density urban areas. Our findings suggest that
poverty and race may play distinct roles in how food
resources are allocated and that underlying social
complexities should be further explored in dense urban,
suburban and rural areas.
