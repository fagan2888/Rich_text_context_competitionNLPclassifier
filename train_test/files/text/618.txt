Children Exposed to Abuse in Youth-Serving Organizations
Results From National Sample Surveys
Anne Shattuck, PhD; David Finkelhor, PhD; Heather Turner, PhD; Sherry Hamby, PhD
Child abuse in youth-serving organizations (YSOs) has
received considerable attention in the wake of exten-
sive news coverage of cases involving teachers,
coaches, day care staff, clergy, and scout leaders.1-3 Lawsuits
have sometimes painted a picture of YSO environments as
posing a particular risk for abuse because they have inad-
equate supervision and may serve as magnets for those with
abusive inclinations.4 Although efforts have been made to
quantify the rate of abuse in some specific environments,
such as the Catholic Church5-7 and schools,8,9 most of these
studies apply to earlier generations. Counts in the United
States within the last 10 years are hampered by the fact that
in key data sources, such as the National Child Abuse and
Neglect Data System and the Federal Bureau of Investiga-
tion's National Incidence-Based Reporting System, perpetra-
tors who are youth-serving workers are not specifically cat-
egorized as such, leaving a vacuum of information about this
problem.
Population surveys offer another way to develop informa-
tion on the epidemiology of abuse in YSOs; however, because
theseoffensesmaybelesscommonthanabusebyfamilymem-
bers, large samples may be required to estimate their inci-
dence. This study uses combined population surveys to cal-
culate prevalence rates for YSO abuse and compare them with
family and other nonfamily, non-YSO abuse.
Methods
The data for this analysis came from the aggregation of 3
representative samples of US children: the National Surveys
of Children's Exposure to Violence, carried out in 2008,
2011, and 2014. All 3 were telephone surveys conducted
about the abuse, crime, and violence experiences of children
and youths aged 1 month to 17 years. Youths aged 10 to 17
years were interviewed directly about their experiences,
while information about the experiences of children aged 0
to 9 years was obtained through interviews with a caregiver.
Details of the methodology are provided elsewhere.10-12 All
procedures were authorized by the institutional review
board of the University of New Hampshire. Oral consent was
obtained from caregivers and youths aged 10 to 17 years. The
3 samples were combined into a single sample, totaling
13 052 children and youths.
In each survey, information on children's exposure to
violence was collected using the Juvenile Victimization
Questionnaire,13-15 which contains questions on more than 40
forms of offenses against youth, covering 6 general areas: con-
ventional crime, child maltreatment, peer and sibling abuse,
sexual assault, witnessing and indirect violence, and internet
abuse. For each type of abuse that a respondent reported ex-
IMPORTANCE Protecting children in youth-serving organizations is a national concern.
OBJECTIVE To provide clinicians, policymakers, and parents with estimates of children's
exposure to abuse in youth-serving organizations.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Telephone survey data from the 3 National Surveys of
Children's Exposure to Violence (2008, 2011, and 2014) were combined to create a sample
of 13 052 children and youths aged 0 to 17 years. The survey participants included youths
aged 10 to 17 years and caregivers of children aged 0 to 9 years.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Items from the Juvenile Victimization Questionnaire.
RESULTS In the combined sample of 13 052 children and youths aged 0 to 17 years, the rate of
abuse by persons in youth-serving organizations was 0.4% (95% CI, 0.2-0.7) for the past year
and 0.8% (95% CI, 0.5-1.1) over the lifetime. Most of the maltreatment (63.2%) was verbal
abuse and only 6.4% was any form of sexual violence or assault.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Abuse in youth-serving organizations was a relatively rare
form of abuse, dwarfed by abuse by family members and other adults.

periencing in his or her lifetime, a series of follow-up ques-
tions gathered additional information about the most recent
exposure, including whether it occurred in the past year, who
the perpetrator was, and where the abuse occurred. The ques-
tionnaire items used in this analysis were identical across all
3 survey administrations except for 2 items that were not pres-
ent in 2008 because they were added to the survey in 2011.
For this analysis, only items representing physical
assault, sexual abuse, verbal aggression, and neglect were
included and only if they were committed by an adult from a
YSO. Twenty Juvenile Victimization Questionnaire items
were used to assess these abuse types (eAppendix in the
Supplement). Although cases of YSO abuse could come to
attention in response to any of the 20 questions, the main
questions eliciting these cases asked: "At any time in your
life, did a grown-up you know touch your private parts when
they shouldn't have or make you touch their private parts?"
and "Did a grown-up you know force you to have sex?"
(sexual abuse); "did a grown-up in your life hit, beat, kick, or
physically hurt you in any way?" (physical abuse); or "did
you get scared or feel really bad because grown-ups in your
life called you names, said mean things to you, or said they
didn't want you?" (verbal abuse). Follow-up questions asked
who the perpetrator was. The survey definition of YSO
worker was "a grown-up (your child/you) know(s) from
some organization, such as a teacher, coach, or youth group
leader." The adult's role was not broken down into any more
specific categories.
Results
The proportion of children and youths with exposure to any
type of YSO maltreatment was 0.8% (95% CI, 0.5-1.1) over their
lifetime and 0.4% (95% CI, 0.2-0.7) in the past year (Table).
This compares with rates of abuse by any family adult of 11.4%
(95% CI, 10.4-12.4) over the lifetime and 5.9% (95% CI, 5.2-
6.6) in the past year. The total rate for nonfamily adult, ex-
cluding YSO adults, was 5.9% (95% CI, 5.2-6.6) for lifetime and
3.3% (95% CI, 2.8-3.9) for past year.
Breaking down the lifetime exposures into categories,
sexual abuse was one of the least frequent categories, occur-
ring in 6.4% of YSO survivors. Verbal abuse was most fre-
quent, experienced by more than half (63.2%) of YSO survi-
vors. Physical abuse was reported by 34.6% of survivors.
Most episodes (67%) occurred at school or daycare. They
were spread across the developmental spectrum, occurring
even among preschool children. Rates were somewhat higher
among older than younger children. The experience of a YSO
abuse in general was not disproportionate by sex, racial group,
or family type, but children who had experienced such abuse
had also experienced a higher mean number of adverse events
in their lifetime (3.3 for YSO survivors compared with 2.0 for
non-YSO survivors) (Table). Lifetime adversity was assessed
using 15 questions that asked about major adverse events
(eg, serious unintentional injuries or illnesses involving the
child or a family member, parent imprisonment, family drug
or alcohol problem, and/or parent unemployment).
Discussion
This analysis of national survey data on maltreatment expo-
sure suggests that the overall rate of YSO maltreatment is
modest; YSO maltreatment is dwarfed by family maltreat-
ment and other categories of nonfamily adult abuse, which
are comparatively much more common; and sexual abuse in
YSOs is a small proportion of all YSO abuse and also of all
sexual abuse. These conclusions are not that surprising
given that most interactions in YSOs occur in the presence of
multiple children and often the proximity of other adults. In
addition, many YSOs have made efforts in recent years to
improve training, staff selection, and implement abuse-
prevention programs.
However,lowcomparativeratesofexposurestoYSOsexual
abuse in this survey should not be interpreted to mean that
such events are rare in absolute numbers. The rate found in
this analysis could translate to a population estimate of 36 000
(95% CI, 10 000-125 000) cases among the population of chil-
dren and youths younger than 18 years, certainly worthy of ad-
ditional prevention efforts. Levels of exposure of this magni-
tude are difficult to measure precisely, even with large samples
like the one aggregated for this analysis. More targeted stud-
ies using cases coming to professional attention, such as the
National Incidence Study of Child Abuse and Neglect, may be
needed to assess change over time.
Another important finding from the study was the de-
gree to which verbal abuse predominated in reports about YSO
abuse. The fact that most abuse in YSOs was categorized as
verbal abuse in this survey is a reminder that this kind of
maltreatment can occur in contexts other than the home and
school. Much of the current prevention training and screen-
ing within YSOs is oriented toward sexual abuse,16 but YSOs
mayalsobenefitfromtrainingstaffabouthowtorecognizeand
prevent verbal abuse. This should include outbursts of anger,
shaming, and rejecting that can cause psychological harm.
In many of the cases of YSO abuse coming to public atten-
tion, disclosure of abuse has been delayed by dozens of years,
possibly suggesting that those experiencing abuse are not yet
willing to reveal abuse to interviewers or parents who would
pass it on to interviewers. However, it is noteworthy that the
rates of abuse by family members, another difficult to dis-
close form of exposure, were substantially more numerous in
this survey.
Key Points
Question: How many children and youths are abused by staff
associated with youth-serving organizations such as schools and
religious/recreational groups?
Findings: The rate of abuse by persons in youth-serving
organizations was 0.4% for the past year and 0.8% over the
lifetime. Most of the maltreatment (63.2%) was verbal abuse, and
only 6.4% was any form of sexual violence or assault.
Meaning: Additional attention should be put on psychological
maltreatment of children in youth-serving organizations.

One other limitation of this survey was that it did not have
any screening questions that specifically asked about abuse by
YSO staff. Instead, YSO abuse was were identified using more
general abuse questions, including some on abuse by adults
and caregivers, and a follow-up question asking for more spe-
cifics on perpetrator identity. A more targeted YSO question
mayhaveelicitedmoreepisodes.Narrativedescriptionsofepi-
sodes might have also identified more offenders who could
have been classified as YSO connected. In addition, perpetra-
tor identity in our protocol only asked about the most recent
experience for children who had more than 1 of that type of
episode. This could also mean that some YSO experiences were
not counted. This would be less true, however, for the less fre-
quent kinds of episodes, such as sexual abuse, that tended not
to have happened with multiple perpetrators.
Conclusions
This analysis suggests that maltreatment of children and youth
in YSOs is a problem, but not nearly as much as maltreatment
in the family. It is important that publicity about cases that
