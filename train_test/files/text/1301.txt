Editorial Introduction
Criminology's third war
Special issue on terrorism and responses to terrorism
Gary LaFree, Special Issue Editor
U n i v e r s i t y o f M a r y l a n d
Politicians in the United States have invoked the term "war" to develop national support
for an all-out attack on criminal behavior on at least three separate occasions sinceWorld
War II: the wars on crime, drugs, and terrorism. In each case, the word has been used
as a metaphor to underscore the conviction that society is involved in a pitched battle and that
there is no room for acquiescence or compromise. The implications of the war metaphor or a
detailed examination of criminology's role in these three campaigns is beyond the scope of this
short introduction. However, I argue that several important similarities can be found across
the three major crime-related political wars of the past century and that there is at least one
important difference: Academic criminology was far more engaged in the wars on crime and
drugs than it has been in the war on terrorism.
Wars on Crime, Drugs, and Terrorism
Each of the three wars can be linked directly to presidential politics. Given the United States
president's constitutional responsibility to serve as "commander in chief," the president is the
elected official who is most likely to invoke the war metaphor and be taken seriously.The phrase
"war on crime" was actually already in U.S. politics by the early 1930s when Federal Bureau
of Investigation Director J. Edgar Hoover sponsored a comic strip of the same name that was
syndicated in newspapers across the country (Ruth and Reitz, 2003). But it was Arizona Sena-
tor and Presidential Nominee Barry Goldwater who elevated the war-on-crime metaphor to
national prominence by making it a key issue in the 1964 presidential election. Goldwater lost
the election but forced President-Elect Lyndon Johnson to take the issue seriously. In the fall of
1964, Johnson tried to counter Goldwater's focus on the microlevel dynamics of crime fighting
by arguing that crime was rooted in broad, macrolevel social problems and that warring on
poverty really constituted warring on crime (Flamm, 2005). But a year later, Johnson dropped
the indirect link to poverty and instead declared a new and direct concern with the victims of
crime: "I will not be satisfied until every woman and child in this Nation can walk any street,

enjoy any park, drive on any highway, and live in any community at any time of the day or
night without fear of being harmed" (Flamm, 2005: 51). When Richard Nixon campaigned
during the run-up to the election of 1968, he moved the war on crime even more directly to
center stage in presidential politics. At the time of his State of the Union Address in 1970,
Nixon declared that "If there is one area where the word `war' is appropriate, it is in the fight
against crime" (Huq and Muller, 2008: 218).
Although the U.S. war on drugs can be traced as far back as the 1880s when the United
States pressed for a treaty with China that included an absolute prohibition on the shipment
of opium between the two countries (Eddy, 2003), the modern war on drugs is usually traced
to 1971 when President Richard Nixon declared an all-out offensive on drugs--which he re-
ferred to as "America's public enemy number one" (2003: 1). In 1973, the Drug Enforcement
Assistance Administration (DEA) was created and charged with enforcing federal drug laws.
In 1978, the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act was amended to allow
for asset forfeiture--which has since been widely used in the war on drugs.
The war on drugs received a major boost with the election of Ronald Reagan in 1980. He
responded to perceived drug-related problems by declaring: "The American people want their
government to get tough and go on the offensive" (Walker, 1992: 26) and promising that police
would attack the drug problem "with more ferocity than ever before" (Donziger, 1996: 115).
In 1983, the Drug Abuse Resistance Education Program (DARE) was founded in Los Angeles
and spread quickly to schools across the country. In 1985, First Lady Nancy Reagan launched
the widely publicized Just Say No (to drugs) campaign, promoting it through television and
radio, popular magazines, bumper stickers, and t-shirts. The Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988
created the Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) to lead the war on drugs, and
William Bennett was appointed as its first director.
In 1994, President Bill Clinton signed into law the Violent Crime Control and Law En-
forcement Act, which called for mandatory prison sentences of 20 years to life for some drug
offenders and the death penalty for those who committed murder in pursuit of illegal drug
sales. Since the early 1970s, the United States has spent vast sums of money combating drug
use and abuse and has created a far-flung bureaucracy to administer these programs. In addi-
tion to agencies like the DEA and ONDCP that were created directly to combat drugs, a host
of other agencies--including the departments of Health and Human Services (HHS), Justice,
Homeland Security (DHS), State, Defense, Veterans Affairs, and Education--received major
budget increases for programs tasked with the control of drugs and the treatment or punish-
ment of drug offenders. Robinson and Scherlen (2007: 42) estimated that in FY 2005, total
federal spending on the drug war amounted to $12.2 billion, with the largest amounts going
to HHS, the Department of Justice, and DHS.
Fewer than 10 days after the attacks on theWorldTrade Center and the Pentagon, President
George W. Bush declared war on "terrorism with a global reach" and promised that the war
would end only with the eradication of evil (Andreani, 2004: 31). In October 2001, the United
States passed the USA Patriot Act, which provides a variety of legal tools to fight terrorism at

home and abroad. The war on terrorism rapidly took concrete policy form in the campaign to
topple the Taliban in Afghanistan. The invasion was preceded by an ultimatum to the Taliban
to hand over terrorists and was at least implicitly sanctioned by the United Nations Security
Council. After early successes in the Afghan campaign, the Bush administration introduced the
doctrine of "preventive war," which suggests that the United States had the right to resort to
force to fight terrorists and their supporters at home and abroad, and strongly pushed the idea
that Iraq was the next step in the global war on terrorism (Andreani, 2004). President Bush
clearly identified his presidency with the war on terrorism and emphasized this connection in
his ultimately successful election over Democratic opponent John Kerry.
Despite obvious differences, there are several important similarities between all three of
these declared wars on different types of criminal behavior (Caulkins, Kleiman, and Reuter,
2003; LaFree and Dugan, 2004). First, in all three cases, law enforcement is a necessary but
not a sufficient solution. Although this argument has probably been the most controversial
for the war on terrorism (LaFree and Hendrickson, 2007), it seems fair to conclude that most
commentators now imagine at least some role for law enforcement in preventing terrorism and
responding to terrorist attacks. Second, in all three cases, much evidence suggests that taking
a tough stand and attacking the problem aggressively does not always produce desired results.
Third, in the case of terrorism and drugs and to some extent crime, the problem has domestic
and transnational aspects. Fourth, in the case of terrorism and drugs and to some extent crime,
the problem cuts across various levels of government, agencies, disciplines, and the public and
private sectors in complex ways. And finally, in all three areas, the war metaphor has produced
substantial and to some extent unanticipated policy difficulties. Thus, Flamm (2005) claimed
that, because President Johnson promoted the war-model idea of total victory against crime, he
set himself up for certain failure. As former Attorney General Nicholas Katzenbach explained,
"You are meant to win wars, and the War on Crime was in a sense an unwinnable war." Similar
arguments have been voiced in terms of the war metaphor applied to drugs (Robinson and
Scherlen, 2007) and terrorism (LaFree and Hendrickson, 2007).
However, ordinary street crime, drug distribution and use, and terrorism are also distinct
in important ways, including the scope of violations (crimes and drug violations are com-
mon, but terrorism is relatively rare); the motivations of participants (terrorists often perceive
themselves as altruists; common criminals and drug distributors rarely do); and organizational
structure (most common crimes are committed with little organized structure, whereas drug
distribution networks and terrorist groups vary greatly in organizational complexity). From a
research standpoint, a major difference between these three types of crime is the differential
involvement of academic criminology.
Although criminology has been involved front and center in the war on crime and drugs,
thus far, its connection to the war on terrorism has been modest. It is true that criminologists
have been making important contributions to the research literature on terrorism and responses to
terrorism for many years.Two past presidents of the American Society of Criminology, Nicholas
Kittrie (1978) and Austin Turk (1982, 1984), explicitly built terrorism into their research on

Criminology & Public Policy

political crime in the 1970s and 1980s. Nevertheless, it is clear that the criminological study of
terrorism has lagged far behind many other specialized branches of criminology. For example,
in a review for this introduction, I identified only four articles dealing directly with terrorism,
responses to terrorism, and homeland security in Criminology from 1963 to the present (Dugan,
LaFree, and Piquero, 2005; LaFree, Dugan, and Korte, 2009; Smith and Damphousse, 1996,
1998) and only one article in Law & Society Review from 1966 to the present (Thatcher, 2005).
Note that all four of the Criminology articles are by authors that have contributed to this issue
of Criminology & Public Policy.
However, the relatively small number of criminologists active in terrorism research has
begun to change in recent years. After the Oklahoma City bombing in 1995 and especially
after the September 11, 2001 attacks, major federal funding became available for criminologists
to embark on large-scale empirical work on the study of terrorism. After these events, funding
through the National Memorial Institute for the Prevention of Terrorism, terrorism research
solicitations by the National Institute of Justice and the Bureau of Justice Administration, and
eventually the creation of the DHS opened the door for an expanded portfolio of criminological
research on terrorism. More recently, terrorism research solicitations by the National Science
Foundation, the National Institute of Justice, and the Bureau of Justice Administration along
with the creation of the DHS Centers of Excellence Program have strengthened support for
social science studies of terrorism and responses to terrorism. The Minerva program (Wash-
ington Post, 2008), which is funded by the Department of Defense, promises to increase levels
of support. Moreover, spurred by brutal attacks such as the Madrid and London bombings,
funding of social science research on terrorism and responses to terrorism has also expanded
greatly in Europe (Eder and Senn, 2008). To underscore the growing effect of these develop-
ments, note that all five articles on terrorism published in Criminology and the Law & Society
Review identified above have publication dates after 1995.
It is of course the hope of the editors and contributors to this issue that the research reported
here will increase attention paid to terrorism and responses to terrorism by the criminological
research community.The five articles included can be divided into the two traditional subdivisions
of criminology, with three articles on the etiology of terrorism (LaFree, Yang, and Crenshaw;
Kelly and Damphousse; Freilich, Chermak, and Caspi) and two articles on the criminal justice
processing of terrorism (Legault and Hendrickson; Useem and Clayton). All of the articles are
grounded in empirical data and rely extensively on criminological theories and methods to
make their arguments.
Current Contributions
The Etiology of Terrorism
LaFree, Yang, and Crenshaw (2009, this issue) examine the attack patterns of 53 foreign ter-
rorist groups that have been identified by the U.S. State Department and other government
sources as posing a special threat to the United States. Using newly available data on nearly
17,000 terrorist attacks from the Global Terrorism Database from 1970 to 2004, the authors
Editorial IntroductionLaFree
435
Volume 8 · Issue 3
find that slightly more than 3% of attacks by these designated anti-U.S. groups were actually
directed at the United States. Moreover, more than 99% of attacks targeting the United States
did not occur on U.S. soil but were aimed at U.S. targets in other countries (e.g., embassies and
multinational corporations). LaFree et al. also find that more than 90% of non-U.S. attacks
were domestic (i.e., nationals from one country attacking targets of the same nationality in
the same country). The researchers apply group-based trajectory methods for the analysis--a
methodology which, up to this point, has been used mostly in criminology.
The LaFree et al. (2009) results underscore the importance of proximity for terrorist target-
ing by these foreign groups.These terrorists, like more ordinary criminals, mainly chose targets
close to their operational base. Given that most attacks by groups identified as threats by the
U.S. government are in fact aimed at non-U.S. domestic targets, the authors conclude that the
United States should pursue efforts to strengthen the capacity of local governments to combat
terrorism and to communicate to other governments the understanding that groups that are
anti-United States are primarily a threat to the countries in which they are located.
Smith and Damphousse (2009, this issue) use open-source data on 173 terrorist perpe-
trated or planned incidents (55 international and 118 environmental) to contrast the lifespan
and strategies of a U.S. eco-terrorist group with other types of terrorist groups operating in
the United States. Like the article by LaFree et al. (2009), Smith and Damphousse introduce a
methodology to the study of terrorism that has not been widely used in the past; they focus on
examining the lifespan of terrorist groups by measuring all major terrorist attacks attributed to
the group and they analyze the criminal and noncriminal precursor behavior associated with
each known attack. Their findings suggest that there are important differences in the temporal
patterns of terrorist groups operating in the United States. Most notably, environmental terrorist
groups engage in a relatively short planning cycle compared with right-wing and international
terrorists. These conclusions suggest caution in interpreting the article by LaFree et al., which
is limited to foreign terrorist organizations.
Smith and Damphousse (2009) provide a detailed examination of the Family, a unique
environmentally oriented terrorist group operating during a relatively long period of time.
This group provides an interesting contrast to other environmental groups that have been
charged with terrorism-related crimes in the United States. Despite important organizational
differences between the Family and other environmental groups using terrorist tactics, Smith
and Damphousse find that the underlying patterns of preparatory conduct for environmental
groups are strikingly similar.The authors conclude that law-enforcement agencies investigating
environmental groups have relatively little time to observe and infiltrate the individual cells and
that, compared with other terrorist groups, environmental extremists thus far have engaged in
attacks that are less deadly.
Like LaFree et al. (2009) and Smith and Damphousse (2009), Freilich, Caspi, and Chermak
(2009, this issue) rely on unclassified, open-source data. The authors examine the evolution
of four domestic far-right racist groups: the Aryan Nations, National Alliance, Public Enemy
Number 1 (PEN1), and the Oklahoma Constitutional Militia (OCM). The authors compare

the changes that occurred in these groups and find that they were influenced by contextual
and organizational variables. The first three groups experienced growth and longevity because
they (1) had able leadership that set forth a clear ideological message and goals, (2) undertook
concrete actions to further their ideology and goals and had the finances necessary for this,
(3) took advantage of political opportunities, and (4) were internally cohesive. Conversely,
OCM's leader displayed poor judgment and the group did not set forth a coherent message,
conduct successful actions, or take advantage of opportunities. Three groups declined because
of organizational instability and responses by law-enforcement and non-state actors (e.g., watch
groups). PEN1, on the other hand, has thus far avoided organizational instability and continues
to grow despite periodic internal debates about its mission.
The article by Freilich et al. (2009) suggests that law-enforcement policymakers should
consider how critical incidents affect a group and account for organizational variables that
denote the group's strength. Moreover, policymakers must engage in dynamic analyses of ter-
rorist groups because contextual and organizational features of groups are constantly changing.
Although law-enforcement (and watch-group) responses can reduce or even eliminate violent
groups, authorities must be conscious of possible backlash effects. By focusing on all criminal
activities--not just those that can be classified as terrorist--researchers and policymakers can
provide more sophisticated theoretical explanations for group differences and help law enforce-
ment establish priorities for responding to and preventing future terrorist activities.
Terrorism and Criminal Justice Issues
The final two articles in the volume deal more directly with responses of the legal system to
terrorism. Legault and Hendrickson (2009, this issue) provide one of the first individual-level
studies of terrorists and more common criminals by comparing firearm offending characteristics
for 336 offenders convicted of terrorism-related charges from the American Terrorism Study
with 923 federal felons convicted by the United States Sentencing Commission. The authors
point out that, although previous research describes firearm use by terrorists in the United
States as relatively common, there have been few systematic studies of how firearm use varies
between terrorists and ordinary criminals. Legault and Hendrickson find that, compared with
other felons, offenders charged with terrorism-related offenses were more likely to participate
in firearm crimes.The authors recommend that official efforts to monitor weapon sales--such
as the Brady Act--continue to include those named on the terrorist watch list and that those
named on the list should be subject to additional law-enforcement scrutiny when attempting
to purchase firearms. These efforts should be coordinated by federal law-enforcement agencies
and should effectively use existing antiterrorism mechanisms to either block purchases or garner
intelligence on terrorists attempting to obtain firearms.
Useem and Clayton (2009, this issue) examine 27 medium- and high-security prisons for
men in 10 state departments of corrections and 1 municipal jail system during the 2006 to
2009 calendar years. The authors interviewed a total of 210 prison officials in central offices
of correctional systems or in separate prison facilities and 270 inmates in prison facilities. In

437

two cases--the municipal jail system and a state prison system--interviews were limited to
prison officials.
Useem and Clayton (2009) focus on jihadi-based radicalization within prisons.Their central
finding is that the occurrence of radicalization in U.S. prisons has been low and the probabil-
ity for radicalization in the future is modest. The reasons for predicting a modest probability
of this type of prison radicalization are fourfold: (1) order and stability in U.S. prisons have
been achieved during the prison buildup period throughout the past four decades; (2) prison
officials have successfully implemented efforts to counter the importation of radicalism; (3)
correctional leadership has infused antiradicalization into their agencies; and (4) inmates' low
levels of education decrease the appeals of jihad-style terrorism.The prison environment permits
a great deal of information to be collected on the actual and planned activities of inmates after
they are released. This requires attentive observation of staff, collection of information from
inmates, and efforts at different levels of correctional agencies to assemble, collate, and assess
information--much of it likely to be false but some of which will be vital.
Policy Essays
In response to the five articles in this issue, we include eight policy essays. These essays are
extremely diverse and provide thoughtful arguments about the complexity of the challenges
that face policymakers in this arena. Although Banks (2009, this issue) endorses the chief con-
clusion of the LaFree et al. (2009) article that greater international cooperation might be the
best counterterrorist strategy, he points out barriers to successful implementation of this policy
and stresses that it should not occur at the expense of less domestic vigilance. Major barriers to
international cooperation on counterterrorism include the absence of internationally recognized
definitions of terrorism, the problem of terrorist threats faced by each country being mostly
idiosyncratic, the enormous variation in counterterrorist resources of individual nations, and the
wariness other countries have regarding real or perceived threats to their sovereignty implied by
bilateral or international counterterrorist strategies. Banks' essay underscores the fundamental
policy dilemma posed by attacks with a small likelihood of occurrence but with the potential
for a catastrophic effect.
Weinberg and Eubank (2009, this issue) address similar themes by raising the question
of whether the relatively limited number of terrorist attacks on the U.S. homeland justifies the
government's enormous outpouring of human and material resources and restrictions on civil
liberties. These authors highlight a fundamental problem in evaluating terrorism policies that
also applies to crime policy more generally: Effective policies tend to undercut their rationale
for existing. The use of metal detectors in response to aerial hijackings in the United States
provides an example. Research (e.g., Dugan et al., 2005) generally supports the conclusion that
metal detectors greatly reduced aerial hijackings in the United States. However, an observer
assessing the small number of aerial hijackings after the implementation of the extremely costly
metal detector program might ask why we would engage in such a costly program to stop a
behavior that is so uncommon. In other words, to address the concerns raised by Banks and by
Special Issue Homeland Security and Terrorism
Criminology & Public Policy
438
Weinberg and Eubank, we must not only ask how common attacks by foreign terrorist groups
have been, but also how common they would have been had governments not taken action
to counter them.
Wigle (2009, this issue) provides an extremely thoughtful examination of an operations-
research approach to countering crime and terrorism. Wigle, chief of the Worldwide Incidents
Team at the National Counterterrorism Center (NCTC), notes that Smith and Damphousse's
(2009) research demonstrates that empirical studies using open-source data and relatively few
cases can nonetheless provide extremely useful information for policymakers. Wigle points out
that such research could be strengthened by providing researchers with greater access to larger,
higher quality databases and by increasingly using automated empirical data-collection and
analytic methods.Wigle also provides a more general warning about the validity of open-source
data that applies to several articles in this issue: Journalists looking for stories will often bypass
frequently occurring crimes to concentrate on atypical but newsworthy events.
Wigle (2009) offers the most detailed suggestions for systematically improving the quality
of terrorism data. For example, he provides specific suggestions for studying groups that fre-
quently change names, sometimes align with other groups, and sometimes disperse altogether
only to emerge again with different personnel. Like several other policy essay authors, Wigle
raises the issue of how to protect civil liberties and privacy while collecting useful data on ter-
rorists and terrorist groups. Here, he suggests that having policies formulated in advance and
making sure analysts are fully informed of these policies and their implications are the most
effective strategies.
Wigle argues that law-enforcement and counterterrorism policymakers must recognize the
value of social science terrorism data and do more to make data collection a requirement. He
sees operations research as a viable way to increase capabilities and to optimize the detection
and prevention of terrorism, and he encourages academics to work within the existing domestic
intelligence network and especially to partner with public safety agencies, joint terrorism task
forces, state fusion centers, and regional intelligence centers.
Policy essays by Berlet (2009, this issue) and Blazak (2009, this issue) deal with radicaliza-
tion and extremism in the United States, but from very different perspectives. Berlet's central
concern is that law enforcement and policymakers in the United States often fail to distinguish
radical ideas from behaviors, and he notes that little empirical evidence exists of a strong link
between radical thoughts and violent acts. But Berlet sees hope in the fact that the Homegrown
Terrorism and Violent Radicalization Prevention Act of 2007 (H.R.1955 and S.1959) was
blocked by a coalition of civil liberties groups spanning the political spectrum.
Compared with Berlet (2009), Blazak (2009) concentrates more directly on the danger of
hate crimes and particularly on the role that U.S. prisons play in generating right-wing extrem-
ism. Although the research article by Useem and Clayton (2009) does not find strong evidence
for jihad-style radicalization in U.S. prisons, Blazak argues that there is much more cause for
Editorial IntroductionLaFree

439
Volume 8 · Issue 3
alarm in terms of racist prison gangs, especially from individuals incarcerated under state hate-
crime laws and federal civil rights laws. Berlet and Blazak--like nearly all the contributors to this
issue--point out that thus far there is little empirical data and analysis on terrorism, including
radicalization and political extremism in the United States.
Austin, (2009, this issue), Greene (2009, this issue), and Forst (2009, this issue) provide
thoughtful, and in many ways complementary, appraisals of the connections between domestic
terrorism in the United States, prisons, and firearms. Similar to Blazak (2009), Austin considers
the prevalence and threat of prisoner radicalization.After reading the Useem and Clayton (2009)
research findings and policy discussion, however, Austin questions the need for and success of
continued or increased law-enforcement efforts to prevent terrorist threats. He asks whether
the more logical policy issue posed by Useem and Clayton's research is why there has not been
another attack since 9/11. He encourages us not to assume that radicalization in prisons is a
serious problem when the reported evidence contradicts such a notion; rather, Austin proposes
that we ask ourselves why terrorists have attacked the United States with such low frequency.
The final two essays (Greene, 2009; Forst, 2009) directly discuss Legault and Hendrickson
(2009). For Greene, the strength of the Legault and Hendrickson article is that it emphasizes
important differences between criminal and terrorist motivations and the implications of these
differences for access to and use of handguns. Greene reminds us that critical differences exist
between distinct types of terrorism and some of these differences may have serious implications
for firearm policies and their effectiveness. For example, compared with international terrorists,
homegrown terrorists likely respond much more directly to gun control laws and domestic
police intelligence. But Greene cautions that gun control laws by themselves are not likely to
be effective in stopping terrorism without more complete communication and information
sharing between local and state government officials and those at the federal level.
This emphasis on the need for better communication among local, state, and federal officials
echoes the earlier discussion by Wigle (2009). Throughout the past decade, Joint Terrorism
Task Forces (JTTFs) have been organized as major vehicles for improving communication
linkages across the various levels of government. But as Greene (2009) points out, the JTTFs
have thus far struggled with conflicting missions and organizational cultures and a general lack
of trust among federal, state, and local law-enforcement agencies. Greene also warns against
an overreliance on rational choice models for explaining terrorism, concluding that behavioral
and values-based ideas about crime might ultimately be more useful for both prevention and
interdiction.
Compared with Greene (2009), Forst (2009) provides a much more critical view of the
utility of comparing firearm use by terrorists and common criminals and, more generally,
for the contribution of criminological research to terrorism policies. Forst claims that federal
sentencing data are unrepresentative of firearm cases because they include many white-collar
offenses, such as mail fraud, embezzlement, and drug trafficking. Forst points out that the
heterogeneity of terrorism, the sometimes idiosyncratic behavior of terrorists, and the lack of
reliable data create major barriers to researchers. That said, Forst is somewhat more optimistic
Special Issue Homeland Security and Terrorism
Criminology & Public Policy
440
about adapting crime-prevention models to terrorism. Compared with Greene, Forst sees more
promise for routine activities theory and mentions game theory as potentially useful. Whereas
Austin (2009) focuses on the financial costs of terrorism and the United States' responses to
terrorism, Forst argues that criminologists could play a useful role in developing models of the
social costs associated with terrorism.
Following the policy essays, we conclude this issue with a thoughtful essay by Jessica Stern
(2009, this issue), an international expert on terrorism. In particular, Stern provides useful sug-
gestions for building on the research of LaFree,Yang, and Crenshaw (2009), Useem and Clayton
(2009), and Legault and Hendrickson (2009). More generally, Stern emphasizes the need for
better empirical data in the study of terrorism and for developing more robust partnerships
between law enforcement, intelligence personnel, and academic researchers. She also stresses
the need to remain flexible and open in an ever-changing threat environment and suggests that
academic specialists could play an important role here.
Conclusions
The wars on crime and drugs have been around long enough to justify asking ourselves whether
academic criminology has had any significant effect on policy in these two areas. When we
think of policy with regard to crime, we most often think of the ability of research to reduce the
behavior in question. And in this sense, the track record of academic research in criminology
has not been encouraging. Certainly, the explosive growth in violent crime that plagued the
United States through the early 1990s--especially its poorer central-city areas--has consider-
ably abated. Murder rates in the United States in the early 21st century are now similar to rates
in the mid-1960s--before the crime boom began (Federal Bureau of Investigation, 2008).
However, many might suggest that giving academic criminology credit for these declines is
reminiscent of the Mark Twain (1889) character who claimed credit for a solar eclipse. The
success of academic criminology in reducing drug use in the United States is likely to be an
even tougher argument to make. In fact, it is difficult these days to find any researcher who
seriously claims that the war on drugs has been a success from a crime-prevention standpoint
(inter alia, see MacCoun and Reuter, 2001).
However, another way of judging the effect of academic criminology on the wars on crime
and drugs is to evaluate its success in providing objective data, evaluation, and assessment in
areas that are often highly contentious. And here the past achievements of criminology are
more easily recognized. For example, criminological research in the United States has played
a major role by identifying and describing the nature of crime and drug use and evaluating
policies and programs aimed at combating them. Much of the most important criminologi-
cal research in this arena has produced negative findings. Thus, despite much common sense
to the contrary, criminological research has not supported strong and consistent connections
between unemployment and crime (Blumstein and Wallman, 2006). Similarly, despite the
immense popularity of the DARE anti-drug program with police, school administrators, and
the general public, research (e.g., Robinson and Scherlen, 2007) demonstrated that it was not

441
Volume 8 · Issue 3
only ineffective but sometimes counterproductive. In fact, an underappreciated yet extremely
important role of criminological research is to provide hard evidence that few magic bullets
exist in the realm of crime-control policy.
There is a troubling irony in the relative lack of empirically based criminological research
on terrorism, because compared with crime and drug use, terrorism represents a type of criminal
behavior for which effective policy is especially dependent on hard data and objective analysis.
As a result of the lack of systematic empirical research, an area that is in need of clear-eyed,
dispassionate facts is especially susceptible to half truths and myths. Policymakers have long
recognized the value to democratic institutions of a free press to serve as an informed critic
for observing public policy and objectively reporting on its causes and consequences to an
informed public. As "slow journalists," the role of criminologists in promoting sound policies
for the nation's efforts to respond to terrorism may be no less critical. To some extent at least,
criminology has served this watch-dog function during the wars on crime and drugs. The role
that criminological research will play in understanding terrorism and responses to terrorism
remains to be seen. But certainly the type of systematic, empirically driven research represented
by the articles in this volume is an important move in this direction.
And finally, we must be careful not to overstate the similarities between the three types of
crime. Ordinary criminals have victims; drug dealers have willing customers; and terrorists have
not only victims but also audiences of supporters and would-be supporters. Compared with
ordinary crime and drug crime, terrorism is far less common and is affected by much more than
single extraordinary events like the September 11 attacks. Ordinary crime is to a large extent
local; drug trafficking and terrorism are more likely to cross national borders. But while drug
trafficking and terrorism can involve crossing national borders, the scope of border crossing
is far greater for drug crimes than terrorism. And given the poor record of border security in
stopping drug trafficking, the probability of success of border control for stopping the much
less common problem of terrorism is correspondingly diminished. Ordinary crime needs little
financing to flourish; drug crimes and terrorism rely on financing. But the direction of money
flows for drug dealing and terrorism run in opposite directions: Drug king pins need to laun-
der money produced by their retail operations; terrorism organizations need to raise money
and safely transfer it to their operatives. Given these underlying differences, there is clearly no
single set of lessons learned from the wars on crime and drugs that can universally be applied
to the war on terrorism.
