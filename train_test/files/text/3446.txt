The Ravens Progressive Matrices Test, developed by Raven
(1941) as a measure of general intelligence (g), has under-
gone many revisions, ranging from colored versions for chil-
dren to the standard and advanced matrices for adults of
different cognitive levels. The most recent published version
is the Ravens Advanced Progressive Matrices (APM; Raven,
Raven, & Court, 1993), which was developed for higher
ability adult populations (i.e., college-level and above). This
test is constructed of 36 items of increasing difficulty broken
into three 12-item sets; in each item, the examinee is asked to
complete a visual pattern by choosing one of eight possible
solutions.
Due to its nonverbal format, the APM is purported to be a
culturally fair, unbiased measure of fluid intelligence (Cattell,
1963), educative ability (J. Raven et al., 1993), or, as we will
refer to it, general intelligence (g; Spearman, 1927), and has
shown itself to be especially useful in situations where English
is not an individual's primary language. As such, the Standard
and Advanced Progressive Matrices have been used exten-
sively in many applied settings in the United States (e.g.,
Ackerman, 1992) and across many cultures (Owen, 1992; J. C.
Raven, 2000; Rushton, Cvorovic, & Bons, 2007). However,
the positive aspects of this test are marred by its lengthy
administration time (40-60 min), making it difficult to use in
time-constrained multivariate research or classroom settings.
In answer to these various limitations, Arthur and Day
(1994) developed a 12-item short form of the APM (which
we call APM-12), with an administration time of 15 min.
Several studies have shown that this 12-item form shows
acceptable psychometric properties (e.g., Cronbach's alpha,
test­retest reliability, convergent validity; see Arthur, Tubre,
Paul, & Sanchez-Ku, 1999, for review). However, this short
form shows relatively low and variable internal consistency
(IC). For example, Cronbach's alphas range from .58 to .66
for short form itself to and .72 to .73 for the 12 short-form
items extracted from the full 36-item version (Arthur & Day,
1994).
More recently, Hamel and Schmittmann (2006) have
argued that the complete 36-item APM can be administered
as a 20-min speed test. Scores on this speeded form of the
APM show strong correlations with scores on slower timed
(40 min, r = .74) and untimed versions (r = .75) of the APM.
However, these authors failed to report the IC of the Speed
Test Scale. We also suspect that giving typical adults only 20
min to complete 36 very challenging abstract reasoning
problems might impose undue stress.
The purpose of the current study was to develop a medium-
form version of the APM that resulted in higher IC than the
12-item version (APM-12), but shorter administration time
than the full 36-item APM (APM-36)--a combination of

Development and Validation of an
18-Item Medium Form of the Ravens
Advanced Progressive Matrices
Jon A. Sefcek1, Geoffrey F. Miller2, and Aurelio José Figueredo3
Abstract
The Ravens Advanced Progressive Matrices (APM) is a widely used measure of general intelligence (g), both across settings
and cultures. Due to its lengthy 40-min administration time, several researchers have developed short-form scales, yet these
forms typically yield a significantly lower reliability. This article describes the creation of an 18-item short form (APM-18)
and its validation in three samples of Southwestern U.S. university students (total N = 633). The APM-18 shows similar
psychometric properties to both the previously published 36-item long form and 12-item short form, but retains a reliability
estimate closer to the original APM. This, plus the shorter administration time (25 min) relative to the complete APM (40-60
min), makes it useful for time-constrained or mass-testing situations.

features that might be useful for time-constrained and mass-
testing situations. Here, we report the development and con-
struct validity of this 18-item scale.
Study 1: Scale Construction and
Construct Validity
Method
Participants. A total of 633 students (198 male, 435 female)
from three southwestern universities participated in this
study as a partial requirement for experimental course credit.
The mean age for participants was 20.92, SD = 4.07 (Mmale
=
20.85, SDmale
= 3.90; Mfemale
= 20.96, SDfemale
= 4.15). Ages
ranged from 17 to 58 years old (male = 18-41, female =
17-58).
Measures
The Ravens Advanced Progressive Matrices 18-Item Short
Form (APM-18).This 18-item short-form version of the
APM is printed in a booklet format on 8½ by 11 white
paper, with each test item printed on a separate page. The
first four pages of the test booklet contain three example
items (Practice Items 1, 5, and 9 from APM-36) to explain
the task.
The 18 actual test items were derived by adding six items
from the longer 36-item version (J. Raven et al., 1993) to
Arthur and Day's (1994) published 12-item version. Arthur
and Day used Items 1, 4, 8, 11, 15, 18, 21, 23, 25, 30, 31, and
35 from the 36-item APM based on a set of three decision
rules, which can be summed up as (a) dividing the APM into
12, three-item sections based on difficulty; (b) taking the
item with the highest item-total correlation for each section;
and (c) in the case of a tie, including the item that resulted in
the largest drop in IC if it was excluded from the full test.
Following these same rules, we added six more items of
increasing difficulty--two that were easy (96% and 75% of
examinees from the normative sample answered correctly),
two that were moderate (50% and 48% of examinees from
the normative sample answered correctly), and two that were
difficult (37% and 32% of examinees from the normative
sample answered correctly). These items (2, 20, 22, 24, 34,
and 32) were integrated of difficulty to mimic their presenta-
tion order in the original APM.
Procedure. The new APM-18 test was given in classroom set-
tings with several examinees at a time. This was done
because this test was developed as a measure of g that could
be used in environments such as classrooms, where there are
time limits on research sessions. In one subsample (n = 175),
tests were given with no time constraints, but with comple-
tion times recorded, to determine the average time needed
for completion. The other two subsamples (n = 232 and n =
226) were constrained to finish the test within 25 min, with
no individual completion times recorded.
Analyses.All statistical analyses were conducted using SAS
Version 8.2 (SAS Institute, 1999). Cronbach's alphas and
bivariate correlations were computed using the PROC CORR
procedure. Tests for mean differences between sexes were
calculated through t test (PROC TTEST) procedures. Hierar-
chical general linear models (GLMs) were tested using
PROC GLM.
Results
IC estimates were computed by using Cronbach's alpha. The
IC of the APM-18 scale yielded moderate reliability ( =
.79). This alpha is lower than normative IC reports for the
APM-36 ( = .84; Forbes, 1964), but higher than those for
the APM-12 (ranging from  = .58-.66; see Arthur et al.,
1999). Furthermore, the alpha of theAPM-18 was larger than
that of the embedded APM-12 ( = .73). Table 1 shows the
results for each of the APM-18 items, with respect to their
item-total correlations, item difficulties, and scale  of the
overall scale if the item is deleted. As seen, deleting any item
reduces the overall reliability of the scale, suggesting that all
items should be retained.
The mean APM-18 score was 9.73, SD = 3.59 (Mmale
=
10.43, SDmale
= 3.52; Mfemale
= 9.41, SDfemale
= 3.59), with a
range of 18. For the subsample in which completion times
were recorded (n = 175), the mean test completion time was
17.5 min (SD = 4.67), with a range of 7 to 25 min; 21% of the
participants took longer than 20 min, but no one took longer
than 25 min. In this subsample, there was a significant posi-
tive relationship between the amount of time it took for par-
ticipants to take the test and their APM-18 score (r = .41, p <
.001), but there was no relationship between age and APM-
18 score, or age and time required to complete the test (for
each r  .03, p  .71). However, for the complete sample (N
= 633), younger participants scored a little higher (age and
APM-18 scores correlated r = -.15, p < .001), and males
scored a little higher--sex (female = 0, male = 1) and APM-
18 scores correlated r = .13, p < .001.
Hierarchical GLMs were tested to explore whether the
apparent differences in male and female APM-18 scores
might have been indirectly attributable to the relationship
between age and APM-18 scores. This model defined the
APM-18 score as the criterion variable, with the ordered pre-
dictor variables being age and then sex. The hierarchical
model was designed to allow age to absorb as much variance
as possible, with sex entered into the model only afterward.
Using this model, both GLMs indicated a significant effect
for age (F = 15.39, p < .001) and then also for sex after age
had been statistically controlled (F = 10.66, p = .001).
Discussion
The results presented here suggest that the APM-18 may
serve as a useful compromise between the lower reliability
APM-12 and the much longer APM-36. The hierarchical
Sefcek et al. 3
GLMs identify both age and sex to be significant predictors
of APM-18 scores, with younger individuals and males gen-
erally scoring higher. These results are consistent with many
previous studies looking at general intelligence (e.g., Jackson
& Rushton, 2006). Results of Study 1, however, do not test
the convergent validity of this scale relative to other mea-
sures of intelligence. Study 2 was designed to do this.
Study 2: Convergent Validity
Study 2 was conducted to assess the convergent validity of
the APM-18 with other measures of intelligence, academic
achievement, and personality. To do so, we tested two sepa-
rate subsamples (n = 193 and 229) taken from the Study 1,
each of which used different criterion measures. In Sample 1,
two widely used measures of adult intelligence were used:
the Mill­Hill Vocabulary Scale­Multiple Choice Sets A & B
(MHV-MC; J. Raven, Raven, & Court, 1997), developed to
be used in conjunction with the APM-36 as a measure of
reproductive ability, that is, the ability to store and retrieve
information (J. C. Raven, 1989); and the Shipley Institute of
Living Scale (SILS; Zachary, 1986), which is a stand-alone
intelligence test comprised of two subscales--Vocabulary,
which tests crystallized intelligence, and Abstraction, which
tests fluid intelligence. Also, we examined academic perfor-
mance via self-reported grade point average (GPA) and scho-
lastic aptitude test (SAT) scores. In Sample 2, we examined
correlations between APM-18 scores and Big Five personal-
ity dimensions assessed with the NEO Five-Factor Inventory
(NEO-FFI) Scale (Costa & McCrae, 1992), and verbal and
drawing creativity (Miller & Tal, 2007). In addition, ACT
scores were collected in this second sample.
Method
Participants. Sample 1 was comprised of 193 students (94 male,
99 female) from an introductory psychology course at the Uni-
versity of Arizona. Mean age of participants was 19.11, SD =
1.62 (Mmale
= 19.23, SDmale
= 1.07; Mfemale
= 19.01, SDfemale
=
2.00). Due to the length of time required to administer the APM-
18, the Shipley, and the Mill­Hill, 10 participants did not com-
plete the Mill­Hill Test. We urged participants to record their
SAT, ACT, and GPA scores only if they were certain of them;
due to this constraint, many of these scores were also missing.
Sample 2 was comprised of 229 students (65 male, 164
female) from various undergraduate courses at the University
of New Mexico. Mean age of participants was 20.19, SD =
3.43 (Mmale
= 21.05, SDmale
= 5.01; Mfemale
= 19.85, SDfemale
=
2.48). Again, we urged participants to record their ACT
scores only if they were certain of them, leaving us withACT
scores for only 129 participants.
Measures
APM-18. The APM-18 consisted of the same items identi-
fied in Study 1. In Sample 1, the form was presented first in
a series of measures examining adult intelligence. In Sample
2, it was presented in the middle of a questionnaire packet
concerning personality, creativity, sexual behavior, and intel-
ligence.
The SILS. The SILS (Zachary, 1986) is a timed (10 min
per subscale), 60-item self-report measure that examines
both verbal intelligence (40 items) and abstract intelligence
(20 items). The test is considered appropriate for average
English-speaking individuals from 14 to adult ages, who
are motivated test takers. Validities and norms published in
the manual were taken from a sample of 322 army recruits.
Split-half reliabilities for each subscale are reported as .87
for Vocabulary, .89 for Abstraction, and .92 for the total
score.
The MHV-MC.The MHV-MC (J. Raven et al., 1997) is a
68-item self-administered multiple-choice vocabulary test
designed to complement the APM-36. Whereas the APM
aimed to measure an individual's ability to solve novel prob-
lems and think in novel ways (i.e., fluid intelligence), the Mill­
Hill aimed to measure an individual's ability to recall learned
information (i.e., crystallized intelligence). To this extent, it
indicates educational attainments, cultural background, and
familiarity with the test's language. The Mill­Hill typically
shows split-half reliabilities more than .90 and test­retest reli-
abilities ranging between .87 and .95 (Raven et al., 1997).
Academic performance.Academic performance was mea-
sured by self-reported GPAs and SAT scores in Sample 1.

aIndicates mean differences as a function of sex.
Sample 2 participants were asked for SAT and ACT scores.
A variety of studies have identified moderate to strong cor-
relations between these academic achievement and aptitude
measures, and a variety of other traits, including intelligence,
personality, and psychopathology (Barton, Dielman, & Cat-
tell, 1971; Brown, 1994; Dyer, 1987; Mouw & Khanna,
1993).
NEO-FFI.The NEO-FFI (Costa & McCrae, 1992) is the
most widely used measure in research on the Five-Factor
model of personality. It is a shortened version of the 240-
item Revised NEO Personality Inventory (NEO-PI-R; Costa
& McCrae, 1992), comprised of 60 items that measure five
global personality factors (12 items per factor): Openness
to Experience, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeable-
ness, and Neuroticism. In our version, participants rated
degree of agreement with statements about their personali-
ties and behavioral propensities on a 5-point scale ranging
from -2 (strongly disagree) to 0 (neutral) to +2 (strongly
agree). This scale has shown strong IC, with Cronbach's
alphas ranging between .74 to .89, for each factor, and con-
sistent cross-cultural validity (McCrae & Costa, 1997).
Verbal and drawing creativity tasks. Participants completed
six 2-min verbal creativity tasks and eight 1-min drawing
creativity tasks (Miller & Tal, 2007). Because a mating-ori-
ented mind-set promotes creativity (Griskevicius, Cialdini,
& Kenrick, 2006), participants were asked to complete these
tasks as creatively as possible with the intention of attracting
a romantic partner. Examples of verbal tasks included writ-
ing answers to thought-provoking questions, such as "How
would you keep a marriage exciting after the first couple of
years?" "What do you hope the world will be like in a 100
years?" and "Imagine that all clouds had really long strings
hanging from them--strings hundreds of feet long. What
would be the implications of that fact for nature and soci-
ety?" There were two types of drawing tasks, four abstract
(e.g., "Please draw an abstract symbol, pattern, or composi-
tion that represents your happiness as a child doing a favorite
activity") and four representational (e.g., "In the space below,
please draw an animal that you admire for its strength, grace,
speed, or beauty"). Each participant's responses to each of
the 14 creativity tasks were scored independently by four rat-
ers on a 1- to 5-point creativity scale. The resulting compos-
ite verbal creativity and drawing creativity measures showed
high interrater reliability and IC (Cronbach's alphas = .91
and .90, respectively; Miller & Tal, 2007).
Results
Sample 1
IC estimates were computed using Cronbach's alpha. The
APM-18 showed moderate IC ( = .71), with the embedded
APM-12 yielding a slightly lower value ( = .63). Although
these internal consistencies are lower than those reported in
Study 1, they are still moderate in strength.
The mean APM-18 score was 10.68, SD = 3.25 (Mmale
=
11.07, SDmale
= 3.13; Mfemale
= 10.31, SDfemale
= 3.34), with a
range of 13 (four to 17). There was no relationship between
APM-18 score and age (r = .03, p = .71), or sex (r = .11, p =
.10). Mean scores for each of the measures of intelligence
can be seen in Table 2. Due to the significant sex difference
between APM-18 scores in Study 1, mean sex differences on
all measures in this study were checked via t tests. There
were no significant sex differences for any of the intelligence
measures in this sample, except for a moderate male advan-
tage on self-reported SAT scores (t = -3.00, p = .003).
Therefore, the remaining analyses were conducted on the full
sample rather than by sex.
As seen in Table 3, both the APM-18 and embedded
APM-12 correlated significantly with most of the other mea-
sures of intelligence and academic achievement and aptitude
used in this sample. Specifically, both the APM scales cor-
related positively and significantly most strongly with the
Shipley Abstraction scale and self-report SAT scores. This is
not surprising as the APM is designed to be a measure of g,
which may be most easily identified in relation to abstract,
analytical measures, of which the Shipley abstraction is one,
and the SAT contains an analytical subscale.
Sefcek et al. 5
Sample 2
IC estimates were again computed using Cronbach's alpha.
As in Study 1 and Sample 1 of this study, the APM-18
showed moderate reliability ( = .79), whereas the embedded
APM-12 again shows slightly lower reliability ( = .74). The
mean APM-18 score was 9.53, SD = 3.57 (Mmale
= 10.29,
SDmale
= 3.98; Mfemale
= 9.23, SDfemale
= 3.36), with a range of
1 to 18. There was no relationship between APM-18 score
and age (r = -.03, p = .61), but there was between APM-18
score and sex (r = .13, p = .04), with males again scoring
slightly higher (t = -2.04, p < .05). There were no other sex
differences on the other intelligence measures (for all ts 
-1.20, p > .05). Table 4 shows mean scores for the intelli-
gence measures and NEO-FFI factors.
As seen in Table 5, both the APM-18 and embedded
APM-12 scores were significantly positively related to ver-
bal creativity (rs = .36 and .32, p < .001, respectively), draw-
ing creativity (rs = .34 and .29, p < .001, respectively), and
self-reported ACT score (rs = .44 and .45, p < .001, respec-
tively). In addition, theAPM scales were positively related to
Openness (rs = .26 and .25, p < .01, respectively) and nega-
tively to Conscientiousness (for each, r = -.16, p < .05), a
finding consistent with previous research (Ackerman &
Heggestad, 1997; Moutafi, Furnham, & Crump, 2003).

relationships between the APM-18 and other standard mea-
sures of intelligence and academic achievement (e.g., verbal
intelligence tests, self-reported GPA, and SAT scores);
whereas Sample 2 examined the relationship between the
APM-18, creativity, self-reported ACT scores, and Big Five
personality traits. Both studies confirmed that the APM-18 is
related to these measures in a predictable manner. Generally
speaking, both the APM-18 and the embedded APM-12
showed the same pattern of correlations with the other mea-
sures used in these studies. However, the higher IC of the
APM-18 suggests that it may be better at detecting individual
variation in g.
Conclusion
Each of the 18 items used in this new APM-18 test was cho-
sen to maintain the progressive difficulty of both the long
form(APM-36)andtheshortform(APM-12).Unsurprisingly,
although the APM-18's reliability was lower than that of the
APM-36, it was higher than that of the APM-12 developed
by Arthur and Day (1994). Furthermore, the patterns of cor-
relation with other measures of intelligence are virtually
identical to theAPM-12, which has, in previous studies, been
shown to mimic the APM-36 results (Arthur & Day, 1994;
Arthur et al., 1999). Combined with an average administra-
tion time of 17.53 min (25 min maximum), these findings
suggest that the APM-18 may work well as a compromise for
researchers who want a quite accurate measure of general
intelligence in a quite short amount of time. The cross-vali-
dation in the three samples reported here is an initial attempt
to collect normative data for the APM-18. Our results may
generalize only to other college students. However, the
APM-18's short administration time, high IC, reasonable
validity, and ease of administration by paper and pencil in
large college classroom settings make it ideal for behavioral
science studies where researchers want a reasonably fast,
accurate intelligence score as part of a larger questionnaire
battery.
