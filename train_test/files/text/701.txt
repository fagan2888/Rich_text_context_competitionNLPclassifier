Baldness and Ischemic Heart Disease in a National Sample of Men
Earl S. Ford, David S. Freedman, and Tim Byers
A weak positive association between male pattern baldness and ischemic heart disease has been sug-
gested previously. The authors examined this issue by using data from the Epidemiologic Follow-up Study of
the First National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. As part of the baseline medical examination
between 1971 and 1975, the presence and degree of male alopecia (none, minimal, moderate, and severe)
were recorded for a subset of participants. Among 3,932 men aged 25-76 years who had complete data, 378
deaths and 939 incident events from ischemic heart disease occurred during an average follow-up period of
14 years. Among 2,019 men who were younger than age 55 years at baseline (61 deaths and 239 incident
events of ischemic heart disease), severe baldness was positively associated with ischemic heart disease
mortality (rate ratio = 2.51, 95% confidence interval 1.01-6.24) and somewhat less associated with ischemic
heart disease incidence (rate ratio = 1.72,95% confidence interval 0.96-3.08). No dose-response relation with
degree of baldness was seen. Although these findings are tempered by the absence of information concerning
the type of baldness (frontal or vertex), they provide support for earlier studies that indicate male pattern
baldness that occurs before age 55 years may be by some mechanism related to ischemic heart disease. Am

age factors; alopecia; coronary disease; cohort studies; men; risk factors
Several case-control and cohort studies have re-
ported a positive association between baldness and
coronary heart disease among men. A review, pub-
lished in 1990, summarized the results from two cross-
sectional studies (1, 2), four case-control studies (3-
6), and two prospective studies (7, 8) and concluded
that a weak positive association between male pattern
baldness and coronary artery disease was supported by
the available data (9). The review listed several short-

comings of the studies such as failure to control ade-
quately for other cardiovascular risk factors including
age; misclassification arising from inadequate mea-
sures of baldness; the temporal nature of the associa-
tion of baldness with ischemic heart disease, espe-
cially for case-control studies; and inadequate
evaluation of baldness subgroups.
Subsequently, a large case-control study of men
younger than age 55 years with myocardial infarction
found an association between heart disease and male
pattern baldness involving the vertex scalp, but not the
frontal scalp (10). Although the odds ratio for any
vertex baldness compared with no hair loss was 1.4
(95 percent confidence interval (Cl) 1.2-1.9), the odds
ratio increased with increasing degrees of vertex bald-
ness, reaching 2.8 (95 percent Cl 1.6-4.8) for severe
baldness. Another recently published study of a sam-
ple of Italian men examined the relation between car-
diovascular disease risk factors and baldness, finding
651
652 Ford et al.
that men with fronto-occipital baldness had higher
cholesterol levels and systolic blood pressure levels
than did men with no baldness or only frontal baldness
(11).
Because few data are available on this topic, espe-
cially from prospective studies, we examined the re-
lation between baldness and ischemic heart disease in
the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
I (NHANES I) Epidemiologic Follow-up Study.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Between 1971 and 1975, 18,836 persons aged
12-74 years participated in NHANES I, of whom
14,407 persons aged 25 years or older at the baseline
examination were subsequently followed. The meth-
ods of the original NHANES I survey and the
NHANES I Epidemiologic Follow-up Study have
been presented in detail elsewhere (12-16). Cohort
members have been followed through 1987.
Only participants from the first 65 sampling loca-
tions received the dermatologic examination. This
sample with proper weighting is representative of the
United States population. Analysis in this study was
limited to the 4,479 male participants who had a
dermatologic examination. A summary description of
the dermatologic examination, which was performed
by third-year dermatology residents, has been pub-
lished previously (17). Four levels of alopecia were
coded: none, minimum, moderate, and severe. Mini-
mum baldness corresponded to no obvious baldness
when the participant walked into the examination
room, but baldness was detected during the examina-
tion. Moderate baldness corresponded to observable
baldness upon the first encounter with the participant.
Severe baldness corresponded to obvious baldness at
first encounter, and if the participant had any hair, it
was confined to the fringes (M. T. Johnson, personal
communication, High Falls, New York, 1995). The
examiners recorded their evaluation of the level of
baldness for each participant, but made no distinction
between frontal or vertex baldness.
Potential confounders in the analysis were age, race,
education, cigarette smoking, systolic pressure, anti-
hypertensive medication, cholesterol, body mass in-
dex, and self-reported diabetes. For smoking, we used
a variable that was constructed in part from responses
obtained during the baseline interview and in part from
the first follow-up interview, conducted from 1982
through 1984. The validity of this approach has been
demonstrated (18, 19).
A single blood pressure measurement was obtained
in the sitting position for some participants, and two
blood pressures were obtained for a subgroup of par-
ticipants. Only the first blood pressure was used. A
single cholesterol measurement was obtained by using
a modification of the Abell-Kendall method (16). Di-
abetes status was defined from affirmative answers to
the question, "Has a doctor ever told you that you have
diabetes, and if so, do you still have it?" or to the
questions. "Do you have any reason to think that you
may have diabetes, sometimes called sugar diabetes or
sugar disease?" and "Did a doctor tell you that you had
it?"
Deaths were classified as being due to ischemic
heart disease if the underlying code listed one of the
International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revi-
sion, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) codes 410-
414. Ischemic heart disease incidence was defined as
the earlier occurrence of a death based on the under-
lying code or a hospitalization with the ICD-9-CM
codes 410-414 listed among any of the 10 possible
diagnoses. Participants who reported at baseline that
they had had a previous heart attack were excluded
from the analysis.
Deaths were identified through searches of the Na-
tional Death Index, through the Health Care Financing
Administration enrollee files, and by other tracing
mechanisms. A participant was considered deceased
only if a death certificate was received or a proxy
interview was completed to verify the death. Death
certificates have been obtained for 96.8 percent of
deceased participants. Participants were asked about
hospitalizations during the study period. If any were
reported, permission was asked to abstract certain data
such as admission and discharge dates and diagnoses.
Medical records were recorded by trained medical
coders using ICD-9-CM codes.
With the direct method, means for continuous vari-
ables, proportions of categorical variables, and rates of
ischemic heart disease mortality and incidence were
age-adjusted using five age groups for all men and
three age groups for men younger than 55 years de-
rived to the 1980 US population. We tested for linear
trend of various ischemic heart disease risk factors
across levels of baldness by conducting linear regres-
sion analyses for continuous dependent variables and
logistic regression analyses for categorical dependent
variables. We also tested for linear trends of mortality
and incidence rates across levels of baldness. In these
trend analyses, we assigned a value of one to four to
the levels of baldness. To examine the independent
predictive power of male pattern baldness, we used
proportional hazards regressions that included age, age
squared, race, education, smoking status, systolic pres-
sure, antihypertensive medication, cholesterol, diabe-
tes, and body mass index. All analyses presented in
this paper were performed with the software
SUDAAN (20), which accounts for the complex sam-

pling design of the study. Proportionality assumptions
were checked using the SAS procedure Proc PHREG
by creating time-dependent covariates for the indepen-
dent variables (21). The effect on the regression coef-
ficients of stratifying on variables that did not meet the
proportionality assumptions was tested using Proc
PHREG and was found to be minimal.
RESULTS
Of the 4,479 men who participated in the dermato-
logic examination, 3,994 men had data on baldness,
age, and cause of death after those who were lost to
follow-up and prevalent cases of myocardial infarction
at baseline were eliminated. A total of 3,932 men who
had complete data for all variables were included in
the proportional hazards regression analyses. Among
these men, there were 378 deaths from ischemic heart
disease and 939 incident events of ischemic heart
disease. Among men younger than age 55 years, 2,019
men had complete data. Among these men, 61 deaths
and 239 incident events of ischemic heart disease were
recorded.
Participants who were lost to follow-up were
younger, had less education, had a lower mean body
mass index, and were more likely to be current smok-
ers than were participants who were included in the
analyses. The two groups did not differ significantly in

age-adjusted mean cholesterol, systolic pressure, and
prevalence of diabetes.
Overall, 47.5 percent of the 3,994 men had some
degree of male pattern baldness: 17.5 percent had
minimum baldness, 23.1 percent had moderate bald-
ness, and 6.9 percent had severe baldness. Among all
men, a significant increasing linear trend across cate-
gories of baldness was present only for age (table 1).
The mean body mass index level among participants
with severe baldness was higher than that among par-
ticipants with lesser degrees of baldness. Among men
younger than age 55 years, a significant increasing
linear trend for the percentage of current smokers was
also noted. In addition, men with severe baldness had
higher levels of cholesterol than men did with no
baldness, had a higher mean body mass index than did
men with lesser degrees of baldness, and had the
highest prevalence of smoking. Among men aged 55
years and older, significant linear trends were ob-
served for age and body mass index. The difference in
cholesterol levels between moderate and severe bald-
ness was significant.
In general, ischemic heart disease mortality and
incidence rates were the highest among men with
severe baldness (table 2). However, none of the linear
trends were statistically significant.
Male pattern baldness was not associated with an
increased rate of mortality from or incidence of isch-
emic heart disease among all men in this study (table
3). Neither in a reduced proportional hazards model
with age, race, and education nor in the full model did
male pattern baldness significantly predict mortality
from ischemic heart disease.
Because the literature suggested that baldness was a
risk factor for younger men, we examined an age-
baldness interaction by dichotomizing age into
younger than 55 years and 55 years and older. For the
incidence analysis but not for the mortality analysis,
the model containing the interaction terms was signif-
icantly different from the model without the interac-
tion terms.
Among men younger than age 55 years, the rate
ratios for severe male pattern baldness were 2.51 (95
percent CI 1.01-6.24) for ischemic heart disease mor-
tality and 1.72 for incidence (95 percent CI 0.96-3.08)
(table 3). A significantly elevated rate ratio for mini-
mal baldness was also found among younger men for
ischemic heart disease incidence. However, no consis-
tent dose-response effect according to degree of bald-
ness was present.

A determination was made during the examination
about whether or not the baldness was familial. The
models containing this variable as a main effect as
well as an interaction with baldness showed no evi-
dence that this familial baldness was a significant
predictor over and above baldness alone.
DISCUSSION
In this study of a nationally representative sample of
men in the United States, we found evidence that
severe male pattern baldness among men younger than
55 years predicted mortality from and incidence of
ischemic heart disease. The association between se-
vere baldness among younger men and ischemic heart
disease agrees with the results from previous studies
(10). In addition, some significant differences in isch-
emic heart disease risk factors according to degree of
baldness were present, particularly among the younger
men.
This is only the third prospective study to examine
the association between baldness and ischemic heart
disease. Persson and Johansson (7) followed 464 men
for 17 years. Of bald men, 25.5 percent developed
coronary artery disease compared with 19.7 percent of
men who were not bald. However, baldness was not
specifically defined in the study, and no adjustments
were made for other cardiovascular risk factors. In the
Chicago Peoples Gas Company Study, 1,594 men
aged 40-59 years were followed from 1958 through
1983 (8). Only among men who were age 40-49 years
did baldness predict the development of coronary ar-
tery disease. In that study, men with advanced bald-
ness had higher cholesterol levels than did men with
less baldness.
The possible association between male pattern bald-
ness and ischemic heart disease has not been well
explained. Male pattern baldness is clearly not a direct
risk factor for ischemic heart disease, but rather a
marker for some other underlying risk factor (9). A
hormonal hypothesis related to excess androgens is
usually proposed as a factor common to both alopecia
and ischemic heart disease (9, 10, 22). Although an
excess of androgens is thought to be associated with
baldness, available evidence does not strongly support
a role for an elevated level of androgens as a risk
factor for ischemic heart disease. Several case-control
Am J Epidemiol Vol. 143, No. 7, 1996
656 Ford et al.
studies have found either lower levels of dihydrotest-
osterone and testosterone (23-28) or similar levels
(29-31) among myocardial survivors and patients
with severe atherosclerosis compared with controls.
Baldness may be related to ischemic heart disease
through its association with other unmeasured risk
factors.
Advantages of our study include its prospective
nature and representativeness and the inclusion of
various other ischemic heart disease risk factors. How-
ever, as in other studies, we were unable to distinguish
between frontal and vertex baldness because the loca-
tion of baldness was not collected at the baseline
examination. This distinction may be important be-
cause vertex baldness has been associated with cardio-
vascular disease, whereas frontal baldness has not (2,
10). However, it is likely that severely bald men would
have a significant component of vertex baldness. In
addition, baldness can be caused by various condi-
tions. Insofar as baldness from other causes mimics
male pattern baldness, some misclassification is also
conceivable. Little is known about the reliability or
validity of the baseline examinations. However,
trained third-year dermatology residents conducted the
dermatologic portion of the examination. It seems
likely that misclassification of baldness was most pro-
nounced between minimum and moderate baldness.
This may account for the lack of a graded dose re-
sponse according to level of baldness. Endpoints were
determined principally from death certificates, hospi-
tal records, and interviews with survivors or proxies.
Therefore, some degree of misclassification of out-
come undoubtedly occurred. If this misclassification
were random, then the likely effect would have been
an underestimation of the associations.
In summary, we found a positive association be-
tween severe male pattern baldness and ischemic heart
disease among men younger than age 55 years. This
association is consistent with other published reports.
Although the underlying mechanism for this associa-
tion is unclear, the presence of severe male pattern
baldness may help to identify individuals with an
increased risk of ischemic heart disease. Because no
underlying mechanism has been identified, no direct
intervention is currently available, and therefore, the
question arises about how to counsel a severely bald
patient. Cardiovascular risk factors should be re-
viewed carefully in such patients, who should be en-
couraged to improve their cardiovascular risk profiles.
