Introduction
There is an extensive and growing literature in the associa-
tions between psychological factors and general health out-
comes (Atherton et
al., 2014; Chapman et
al., 2011;
Matthews etal., 2009). Many different health issues have
been considered such as hypertension and asthma, yet few
studies have looked at the specific associations between
psychological factors and eye conditions. This study set out
to explore the psychological, biomedical and socio-demo-
graphic factors in childhood and adulthood associated with
self-reported eye conditions in adulthood using a large birth
cohort in the United Kingdom.
Personality factors are related to health beliefs and
behaviours which have long-term consequences, yet com-
paratively few studies have examined personality corre-
lates of eye problems. It is possible that personality
variables lead to behaviours that may influence the cause of
eye problems, but also that eye problems could have a
direct effect on personality. Thus, for instance, those who
are prone to adventurousness and risk-taking may be more
likely to incur eye (and other) injuries which may in turn
reduce their risk-taking behaviours. In order to explore
these relationships, it is therefore necessary to conduct lon-
gitudinal studies, not just cross-sectional research.
However, most of the results have been limited in terms of
sample and personality measures.
Perhaps the first study in the area of personality and
perception done almost 70
years ago was by Hibbeler
(1947) who was interested in helping glaucoma patients
deal with their affliction. He compared the personality of
27 glaucoma patients with a control group on a

Abstract
This study set out to examine the associations between psychological, biomedical and socio-demographic factors in
childhood and adulthood associated with the occurrence of self-reported eye conditions in adulthood. In total, 5706
participants with complete data on parental social class at birth, cognitive ability accessed at age 11
years, abnormal
eye conditions by the age of 16
years diagnosed by medical professionals, educational qualifications obtained at age
33
years, the Big Five Factor personality traits measured at age 50
years, current occupational levels and self-reported
eye conditions at age 54years were included in the study. Logistic regression analysis showed that among all the factors
examined early abnormal eye conditions, traits neuroticism and openness as well as sex were the significant predictors
of self-reported eye conditions in adulthood.

well-known questionnaire of that period (Minnesota
Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI)) (Schiele
etal., 1943). He found evidence that the male patients
tended to be high on depression and hysteria and the
women on paranoia. Later Warrian etal. (2009) looked at
personality factors in 148 patients with glaucoma or ocu-
lar hypertension using a new validated personality test
(NEO PI-R) (Costa and McCrae, 1992). They found that
the visual function questionnaire score of these patients
was related to their Neuroticism, Extraversion and
Conscientiousness. They argued that personality factors
determine both how patients attach value to the treat-
ments they receive and how they report the effects of
treatment.
Cooke etal. (2003) compared keratoconic and myopic
patients in terms of their personality, finding that myopes
scored higher than keratoconics only on the Psychoticism
scale, measuring tough-mindedness. However, the effect
was small and became non-significant when corrected with
Bonferroni procedure. In the same year, Spahn etal. (2003)
looked at the personality profile of 24 patients with central
serous chorioretinopathy. They found that the patients had
elevated scores with regard to emotional instability (i.e.
neuroticism) and insecure but also spontaneous and flexible
compared to population norms. They recommended a lon-
gitudinal study with a bigger sample to understand the role
of personality in this condition.
Giedd etal. (2005) aimed to define the personality pro-
file of keratoconus patients with the Millon Behavioural
Health Inventory (MBHI) (Sweet etal., 1985). Keratoconus
is a corneal disease that manifests itself in young adult-
hood and decreases vision. The findings show that kerato-
conus patients scored lower than the normative population
on the respectful coping style scale, suggesting that they
could be less respectful towards practitioners, uncoopera-
tive and noncompliant with treatment plans. However,
their scores were not associated with a history of penetrat-
ing keratoplasty or their rating of the effect of keratoconus
on their lives.
Woods etal. (2008) assessed whether tolerance to diop-
tric spherical defocus is related to measures of personality
using NEO PI-R and the CaliforniaAdult Q-sort, finding that
two perfectionism scales were significantly correlated with
blur tolerance. Two clusters, `low self confidence' and `dis-
organisation', were positively related to blur tolerance. The
findings show that people who lack self-confidence may
need stronger evidence of blur before they have visual symp-
toms, while disorganised people may have better tolerance to
blur because it is simply another manifestation of their untidy
personal environments. This finding was replicated by the
same authors and they argue that psychologically high-func-
tioning (adjusted) people do not tolerate blur well, whereas
low-functioning people may tolerate blur to their detriment
because they lack the psychological resources to positively
change their environments (Woods etal., 2010).
Na etal. (2015) looked at correlates of women suffer-
ing with dry eye disease. Controlling for age, lifestyle and
medical factors, they found patients were much more
likely to have experienced severe psychological distress,
depressive moods, anxiety problems and a history of psy-
chological counselling though the study was unable to
examine whether these were causes or consequences of
the problems.
In a recent cross-sectional study, Ichinohe etal. (2016)
examined the associations between symptoms of dry eye
disease and personality traits in a clinical sample (n=56)
using a Japanese version of the Big Five Personality
Inventory based on the NEO Personality Inventory (Costa
and McCrae, 1985). They found that among the Big Five
personality factors, only neuroticism showed a significant
correlation to the Dry Eye­Related Quality-of-Life Score
(r=-0.35, p<
0.01) and Ocular Surface Disease Index
(r=-0.28, p<0.05).
Conscientiousness has been found to be associated with
various health outcomes. In a meta-analysis, Bogg and
Roberts (2004) quantitatively synthesised 194 studies and
found that conscientiousness-related traits were negatively
related to all risky health-related behaviours and positively
related to all beneficial health-related behaviours. Similar
findings were reviewed in Friedman and Kern (2014) study.
Some studies demonstrated the negative associations
between intelligence and a number of health outcomes,
for example, between childhood cognitive function and
Type 2 Diabetes (Olsson etal., 2008) and between child-
hood intelligence and mortality (Batty et
al., 2009).
However, intelligence has also been found to be positively
associated with excessive alcohol intake (Kanazawa and
Hellberg, 2010). Previous studies have also established
the link between socioeconomic conditions and health
(Marmot, 2007; Wilkinson and Pickett, 2006). There seem
far fewer studies on the relationship between intelligence
and demography on eye problems.
Hypotheses
This study has two strengths compared with many previ-
ous studies in the area. First, it used a large prospective
birth cohort. Second, it looked at two main aspects of
individual difference (personality and intelligence) and
their associations with the health outcome in question.
Based on the previous findings, it is hypothesised that
(H1) abnormal eye conditions before puberty diagnosed
by medical professionals would be significantly associ-
ated with self-reported eye conditions in adulthood; (H2)
emotional stability would be significantly associated with
the eye disorders in adulthood; (H3) conscientiousness
would be significantly associated with the outcome vari-
able; (H4) early eye impairment, traits emotional stability
and conscientiousness would be independent predictors of
the occurrence of eye conditions in adulthood.

Method
Sample
The National Child Development Study 1958 is a large-
scale longitudinal study of the 17,415 individuals who were
born in Great Britain in a week of March 1958 (Ferri etal.,
2003). The following analysis is based on data collected
when the study participants were at birth and at ages 11, 16,
33, 50 and 54years.At birth, available information includes
parental social class, gestational age and birth weight. At
age 11years, children completed cognitive ability tests. At
age 16
years, mothers provided information on whether
cohort members ever had eye conditions by the age of 16
years. At age 33years, cohort members provided informa-
tion on educational qualifications obtained. At age 50years,
participants completed a questionnaire on personality traits.
Participants also provided information on their current
occupation and whether they were having eye conditions at
age 54
years. The analytic sample comprises 5706 cohort
members (50.3% females) with complete data. Analysis of
response bias in the cohort data showed that the achieved
adult samples did not differ from their target sample across
a number of critical variables (social class, parental educa-
tion and gender), despite a slight under-representation of
the most disadvantaged groups (Plewis etal., 2004).
Measures
Childhood measures: parental social class at birth was meas-
ured by the Registrar General's measure of social class
(RGSC). RGSC is defined according to occupational status
and the associated education, prestige or lifestyle (Marsh,
1986) and is assessed by the current or last held job. When the
father was absent, the social class (RGSC) of the mother was
used. RGSC was coded on a six-point scale from unskilled to
professional occupations (Leete and Fox, 1977). At birth,
mothers were interviewed and provided information on gesta-
tional age and birth weight. Childhood cognitive ability tests
(Douglas, 1964) were accessed when cohort members were at
age 11
years consisting of 40 verbal and 40 non-verbal items
and were administered at school. At age 16
years, mothers
were interviewed and provided information on whether cohort
members ever suffered from abnormal eye conditions diag-
nosed by medical professionals. Adulthood measures: at age
33, participants were asked about their highest academic or
vocational qualifications. Responses are coded to the six-point
scale of National Vocational Qualifications levels (NVQ)
which ranges from `none'to `university degree/higher'/equiv-
alent NVQ 5 or 6. Personality traits were assessed by the 50
questions from the International Personality Item Pool (IPIP)
(Goldberg, 1999). Responses (five-point, from `Strongly
Agree' to `Strongly Disagree') are summed to provide scores
onthe`BigFive'personalitytraits:Extraversion,Emotionality/
Neuroticism, Conscientiousness, Agreeableness and Intellect/
Openness. At age 54
years, participants provided information
on their current or last occupation levels coded according to
the Registrar General's Classification of social class (RGSC),
described above, using a six-point classification described
above. At age 54
years, participants provided information on
whether they were having eye conditions (other than wearing
glasses or contacts such as age-related macular degeneration/
visual disturbances/glaucoma/cataracts) since previous inter-
view five years ago with Yes/No response. In addition, 7.4per
cent of the total cohort members who had eye conditions also
answered a question on eight specific eye problems: that they
had diabetes-associated eye disease (6.4%); glaucoma (9.8%);
cataracts (13.3%); age-related macular degeneration (3.5%);
visual disturbances (1.4%); permanent loss of vision due to
trauma (1.6%); blindness or loss of vision (3.8%); and another
eye problem (58.7%). The response of general (non-specific)
eye conditions was used as the outcome variable.
Statistical analyses
To investigate the set of psychological, biomedical and
socio-demographic factors associated with the occurrence
of self-reported eye conditions in adulthood, first, the char-
acteristics of the study population were examined; second,
correlation analysis was conducted and all the variables
used in the study were examined; third, logistic regression
analysis was conducted using STATA version 14, and the
response of self-reported eye conditions in adulthood was
the dependent variable.
Results
Descriptive analysis
Table 1 shows the characteristics of the study population
according to the occurrence of eye conditions at 54
years.
The rate of eye conditions appears to be slightly higher
among managerial of professionals than other groups in
parental social class but current professional occupation
tended to report less such health outcome. There were also
gender differences: females reported more than males on
eye conditions. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) showed
that the differences were statistically significant (F(1,
5705)=11.47, p<0.001).
Correlational analysis
The correlation matrix is shown in Table 2, which shows
that eye impairment by the age of 16years and emotional
stability were significantly associated with eye condi-
tions in adulthood in the expected direction. Parental
social class, childhood intelligence, agreeableness and
openness as well as sex were also significantly associated
with the outcome variable. Thus, hypotheses 1 and 2
were supported and hypothesis 3 was refuted, that there
was no significant association between conscientiousness
and the outcome variable.
4 Health Psychology Open 
Regression analysis
Table 3 shows the results of logistic regression. The model
shows that abnormal eye conditions before puberty and
traits emotional stability and openness as well as sex were
significant and independent predictors of adult eye condi-
tions. Thus, hypothesis 4 was partially supported, that early
eye impairment and trait emotional stability were inde-
pendent predictors of the occurrence of eye conditions in
adulthood, but conscientiousness was not a significant pre-
dictor of the outcome variable.
Discussion
This study looked at a set of psychological, biomedical and
socio-demographic factors associated with self-reported eye
conditions in adulthood using a large birth cohort in the
United Kingdom. The correlational results showed seven
modest correlates of eye conditions in adulthood: emotion-
ally less stable, being females, with higher scores on parental
social class and intelligence and higher scores on agreeable-
ness and openness with eye impairment before puberty were
more likely to report eye problems at age 54years.
The results of the regression highlighted five factors: eye
impairment 38years earlier, gender, social class, emotional
stability and openness. The fact that eye conditions at age
16
years were predictive of those 38
years later indicates
possible genetic factors as well as issues with treatment. It is
known that many eye conditions are chronic, slowly deterio-
rating over time even with treatment.
The association with social class may be due to various
possible factors. Compared with unskilled manuals, cohort
members who came from non-manual professional family
tended to report more eye conditions in adulthood. It could
be that middle-class people are more health conscious,
more likely to have eye and other health check-ups and
consequently more aware of, and likely to report, their eye
conditions. Equally it may be that middle-class jobs involv-
ing considerable reading and detailed visual processing tax
the eyes more and lead to more eye strains and problems.
The significant effects for sex and neuroticism on the out-
come variable may have different possible explanations. The
sex differences in self-reported eye conditions might be, in
part, explained by the positive associations between females
and depression (Beck, 1979) and between neuroticism and
symptoms of anxiety and depression (Cheng and Furnham,
2003; Furnham, 2008). The well-established relationship
between neuroticism and physical illness has been explained
in terms of two factors. First is that neurotics over-report ill-
ness and are more prone to hypochondriasis. That is, while
neurotics may have similar acute and chronic conditions com-
pared to non-neurotics, the former are significantly more

likely to report the condition than the latter. Second, the anxi-
ety and depression which are at the heart of neuroticism lead to
a set of social and self-medication behaviours that are less
adaptive and exacerbates the illness. Certainly, these confirm
many of the studies mentioned above which, though they used
different personality tests and were concerned with different
eye conditions, all showed that anxiety/depression/distress are
associated with eye conditions (Cooke etal., 2003; Hibbeler,
1947; Na etal., 2015; Spahn etal., 2003; Warrian etal., 2009).
The hypothesised association between conscientiousness
and eye conditions, however, was not confirmed, either from
the correlation analysis or regression analysis, which is not in
line with previous findings which demonstrated the associa-
tion between conscientiousness and a number of health out-
comes (Bogg and Roberts, 2004; Friedman and Kern, 2014).
Furthermore, it is not clear why openness marked by curiosity
and imagination should be related to eye problems though it
does confirm the findings of Spahn etal. (2003) study.
Limitations
This study is based on available variables in the data set
rather than being based on the study designed for the
purpose; thus, variables included in the study do not
have a wide scope in investigating correlates of the
outcome variable. For example, the outcome variable
is vague without specific medically defined terms,
though it is not uncommon to use lay terms rather than
professional ones in large population-based surveys.
Furthermore, the outcome variable is self-report rather
than examined by medical professionals. However,
research in self-reported heath has found to be linked to
mortality (Heistaro etal., 2001; Kaplan and Camacho,
1983). Also, personality traits were measured only once.
Only with repetitive measures accessed periodically
can the mechanisms and processes of these associations
be better understood. Therefore, future studies should
be conducted to confirm or refute the findings in
this study. Nevertheless, this study did highlight the
importance of studying personality factors in eye
disorders.
