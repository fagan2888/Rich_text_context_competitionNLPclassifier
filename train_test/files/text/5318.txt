Having pioneered the use of social network analysis in
British sociology, I was asked to present some reflections at
a Methodological Innovations conference on my encounters
with this innovative methodology. In reflecting on this, I
came to appreciate all-too clearly that I had no intention ever
to become a methodologist. I found echoes of this feeling in
two other works that inspired my own title.
Peter Berger (2011) recounts in his autobiography that,
as a new immigrant to New York from Eastern Europe, and
speaking little English, he reasoned that the best way to find
out about the society that he had entered was to enrol for a
course of study in sociology. He found, in fact, that his soci-
ology course told him nothing at all about American society.
Instead, he encountered expansive theoretical reflection
from a strongly philosophical basis. To his surprise, he
found the study of abstract theory enjoyable and rapidly
decided to pursue these sociological interests. By accident
he had discovered something that was to take up a signifi-
cant part of his career.
Garry Runciman's (1989) reflections on sociological the-
ory, on the other hand, led him to describe himself as a
`reluctant theorist'. His view was that theorising was neither
enjoyable nor especially valuable in its own right but was
simply a necessary means to an end. In order to understand
the world, he reluctantly concluded, it was necessary to
engage in theoretical debate about it.
I share something of each of these views, though in relation
to methodology rather than to theory. I found myself engaged
in methodological debates by accident, having tried to under-
stand real world problems. My involvement in methodology
was also a reluctant one, as I could see methodology as being
important ­ to me at any rate ­ because it was a means to an
end.
Despite this serendipity and reluctance, I have come to be
seen by some as a methodologist. This has shaped the invita-
tions that I have received to write and speak on sociological
matters and it has helped to determine the direction in which
my empirical work has moved. Any sociologist knows that
labels are important means of social control and can lead to
shifts in identity. This labelling has not shaped my self-per-
ception and so I have never identified myself as a method-
ologist. I have achieved this through what Peter Berger
called role distance, a mechanism through which people are
able to avoid the implications of the labels that are attached
to them by virtue of their roles. The example given by
Berger is the obsequious waiter in a restaurant who manages
to convey the impression ­ at least to himself ­ that he is not
really the servile character that he appears on the surface to
be. My ultimate act of role distancing is, perhaps, the deliv-
ery of this lecture and its subsequent publication in a meth-
odology journal.
Adventures of an accidental methodologist
John Scott1,2,3
Abstract
This article reflects on the attempt to introduce and extend two innovative methodological considerations: social network
analysis and documentary research. Documentary research is widely used but little discussed in methodological literature and
I show how my own methodological reflections arose from practical concerns with the use of documents. Social network
analysis as a formal technique has been little used and I show how my attempts to popularise it as a methodology also grew
out of practical research concerns. These are the adventures of an accidental methodologist.

2 Methodological Innovations
The beginnings of my methodological
interests
I have been heavily involved in two areas of methodological
discussion: documentary research and social network analy-
sis. Each of these was a relatively underdeveloped area when
I became involved and so much of the work that I did was
pioneering and innovative. It is difficult not to be an innova-
tor when there are few competitors about. Because of the
lack of competition in these areas my own work was particu-
larly visible to others, and this would not have been the case
if I had written on, say, ethnography or survey methods. As a
result of my high visibility, I became closely identified with
both documentary research and social network analysis as
interest in them grew.
Both methodological interests arose during my earliest
research. My first academic job was in Scotland during the
early 1970s. This was a time when the oil and gas fields of
the North Sea were being explored and developed, igniting
political debates over devolution and independence with
estimates of the wealth generated from the North Sea and the
question of whether control over these resources would lie
with Scottish interests or English ones.
My own research interests were in social stratification and
this interest fused with these political debates for purely con-
tingent reasons. First, I was asked by a colleague to contribute
a theoretical chapter to a book that he was editing on social
class in Scottish society. This got me thinking about stratifica-
tion in a Scottish context and I decided to undertake a small
study of the economic power of the Scottish upper class.
Second, and as a result of this, I was approached by the radi-
cal student Rector of Edinburgh University to contribute a
chapter on economic power to a book that he was editing and
to be called The Red Paper on Scotland. The Rector ­ one
Gordon Brown, later to be a long-serving Labour Chancellor
of the Exchequer and a short-serving Prime Minister ­
brought together a number of then-radicals, including a later
Business Secretary Vince Cable, to discuss aspects of Scottish
economic and political autonomy (Brown, 1975).
I began a project, working jointly with Mike Hughes, that
aimed to investigate the structure of economic power in
Scotland through a study of ownership and control in its larg-
est companies. This eventually appeared in a number of
papers and a book (Scott and Hughes, 1980). In my later
research, I extended this into a study of British society that
was undertaken as part of a comparative investigation
(Stokman et al., 1985) and that I reported in a book that went
through three editions (Scott, 1979, 1997).
The Scottish project investigated the board-level posi-
tions of company directors and the patterns of shareholding
in these companies. The theoretical context was the debate
on the so-called managerial revolution through which share-
holding owners were supposed to be replaced by salaried
career managers as companies grew in size. Large corpora-
tions, it was held, are no longer controlled by capitalists but
by professional managers. To examine whether this was the
case, and to see whether the controllers had a Scottish or an
English background, we took up the theoretical and empiri-
cal approach followed by C. Wright Mills and Paul Sweezy.
From Mills, we took the idea of investigating the social back-
ground and recruitment patterns of company directors, their
board-level connections in so-called interlocking director-
ships, and the kinship links through which they might be
connected. From Sweezy, we took the idea of investigating
the identity and formation of groups and clusters of compa-
nies subject to a common focus of control.
Documentary sources
In order to investigate these issues, we had to collect some
data and the obvious sources were the paper records of direc-
torships, families and companies that were published as
yearbooks and stored in archives. The key archive was
Companies House in Edinburgh, where annual lists of share-
holders are deposited and that can be examined for the names
of large shareholders. The principal directories and year-
books that were used were The Stock Exchange Yearbook
and the Directory of Directors, the annual volumes of the
biographical reference book Who's Who, and the genealogi-
cal directories Burke's Peerage and Burke's Landed Gentry.
In addition to these, we consulted the financial press and the
gossip columns: at that time, the columns gave more atten-
tion to aristocrats and businessmen than they did to TV
`celebrities'.
Our first step was to collect lists of names of directors and
shareholders in the companies that were being studied. We
had little idea of what the problems might be and discovered
these problems only through doing the research. The major
problem was to identify lists of unique names of company
directors. It was necessary, for example, to know whether the
J. Smith named as a director of Company A was the same
person as the John Smith named as a director of Company B.
We then had to discern whether either or both of these people
were the same as the John B. Smith named as a director of
Company C. Beyond this, it was important to recognise that
directories collect data relating to each company's reporting
period and so companies might list their directors on a vari-
ety of dates. As people may be awarded titles during the
course of a year, it was necessary to see whether any of the J.
Smiths we found were to be identified as the Sir John Smith
who sat on the board of Company D or the Lord Smith sitting
on Company E. Furthermore, any of these, or any of a num-
ber of other names, might be identical to the Lord Muck sit-
ting on Company F.
Having compiled a clean list of unique names, we went on
to collect biographical information on family, education, and
career background. It was immediately apparent that not all
of the people that we listed were included in the biographical
directories: the directories did not carry a complete census
and they may not contain a representative sample. We had to
Scott 3
estimate the extent of any bias among those selected by the
editors of the directories. In using the Burke volumes, we had
to face the problem that these were not then indexed and so it
was a time-consuming matter to trawl through the lengthy
entries to see if particular names were included.
The collection of lists of shareholders raised similar
problems of identification but also involved further prob-
lems because of the practice of using anonymous entries.
Although many individuals and families listed shares in
their own names, others held their shares through a bank
trust company and might appear as one of a number of
anonymous bank accounts. Many banks used so-called
nominee companies and miscellaneous bank accounts to
register the holding of large numbers of individuals. We
aimed to identify those accounts that related to particular
individuals or companies and to separate them from those
that were simply aggregations of small shareholders. This
involved a great deal of correspondence with banks and
company registrars and a number of visits to the Edinburgh
and London financial districts to examine brass plates on
company offices.
From the lists that we eventually produced, we were able
to generate statistical summaries and trend data. These were
produced from manual record cards that were sorted and
resorted into piles on the floor carpet. The task became some-
what easier in 1975 when I managed to invest in a first-gen-
eration `pocket' calculator. We also produced family trees of
prominent families, drawn out on rolls of wallpaper because
of the extensive lateral `cousinhood' relations that tied the
various families together. Because of limitations on space,
we could only ever use sub-sections of these diagrams in our
publications.
The problems of collecting and recording the data led me
to reflect on the methods that I was using. There was very
little in the way of methodological accounts that I could draw
on in working through the problems. Apart from some very
early work on letters and diaries such as the study by Thomas
and Znaniecki, there were just three that seemed directly rel-
evant. Colin Bell had written on the use of Who's Who as a
sampling frame, while Ken Plummer had written on
Documents of Life, which he rightly insists is not about `doc-
uments' but about all ways of expressing and accounting for
life experiences. Most relevant was Jennifer Platt's two-part
summary of approaches to documents, but even this gave
only partial coverage of the issues that I had discovered in
building my data set.
I decided that I needed to work through the problems
myself and in writing down these reflections I produced a
book that I hoped others would find useful. In A Matter of
Record (Scott, 1991), I compiled a four-element appraisal
grid for the assessment of documents on paper, stone, metal,
film, audio or digital mediums. This grid identified four sets
of questions that must be asked about any piece of documen-
tary data before it can be used in a sociological, or historical,
analysis:
1. Authenticity. Is the evidence genuine and of unques-
tionable origin?
2. Credibility. Is the evidence free from error and
distortion?
3. Representativeness. Is the evidence typical of its kind
and, if not, is the extent of its untypicality known?
4. Meaning. Is the evidence clear and comprehensible?
The lack of competitors ensured that this particular meth-
odological innovation found a ready audience. As a result of
the book's success, I started to become identified as an expert
on documentary research methods and was invited to present
my ideas at a number of lectures and workshops in Britain
and overseas. I was also invited to contribute entries to an
Encyclopaedia of Social Research Methods and a Dictionary
of Social and Cultural Research, which further reinforced
my `expert' status. In 2006, 33
years after the research had
begun, I was invited to prepare a landmark reference set of
articles running to four volumes that brought together source
materials and applications on handling documents in social
research (Scott, 2006).
Social network analysis
Meanwhile, back in 1974, I was trying to find ways of ana-
lysing the data that had been collected. Initial analyses could
report statistical figures on the distribution of directorships
and company shareholdings. We were able to show, for
example, that most directors held just one directorship, a sig-
nificant number held two, and declining numbers held three,
four or more. The distribution of the numbers of director-
ships held, in each year that we studied, was an exponential
distribution. However, we wanted to go beyond such statisti-
cal data to report directly on the structures of the relations
among companies. I was aware of a number of attempts to
construct diagrams of company connections. Many of these
were what I thought of as `spot the capitalist' diagrams pro-
duced by radical publications that gave little indication of the
methods they had used to depict the data. Some work that
took a more systematic approach had begun to appear in
studies by Stanworth and Giddens, Whiteley, and Thomas,
but these were limited to very small subsets of companies
and while they used the term `network analysis' to refer to
their visualisations, they made little use of any formal tech-
niques beyond simple measures of network `density'.
My school background in geography and my love of maps
convinced me that there must be ways of `mapping' large
data sets of 250 companies. I had also become involved with
Bob Blackburn and colleagues in a study of occupational
stratification that used techniques of multidimensional scal-
ing and this, too, suggested ways of looking at company data.
Although I could begin to draw diagrams on my trusty rolls
of wallpaper, I was aware that this involved an arbitrary
placement of companies and rapidly dissolved into a thicket
of intersecting lines that were impossible to inspect and
4 Methodological Innovations
analyse. I began to experiment with other ways of presenting
the data.
In the Red Paper and the early articles and book, I used
three kinds of diagrams. First, I used simple network dia-
grams similar to those produced by Stanworth and Giddens.
These did, at least, bring out multiple links between compa-
nies (shown by multiple lines) and allowed me to position
those with multiple links close to each other. This was no
innovation on existing methods.
The second kind of diagram I constructed was a circle dia-
gram. In this, companies are placed around the circumference
of a circle and the order is rearranged until the number of cross-
ing lines is minimised. This allows the identification of separate
clusters and company groupings, but the position of the group-
ings around the circumference remained arbitrary.
The third kind of diagram was an artificial `artist's impres-
sion' of the network in the form of a bubble diagram. In this
kind of diagram, I relied on my assessment of the ways in
which companies were grouped together and then used inter-
secting circles to try to show how these groups overlapped to
produce a structure of power in which regional and func-
tional differences in structure could be visualised. While this
method gave a clear picture of global network structure for a
large data set, it relied on the researcher's assessment of sim-
ilarities and differences in patterns of connection.
A step forward could be made only by using radically
novel methods. I realised that I had to enquire widely for a
solution to my problem. I wrote a short article subtitled `A
Cry For Help' that was published in the newsletter of the
British Sociological Association (BSA) Quantitative
Sociology Group. The response to this, which I summarised
in a short report, brought me into contact with other practi-
tioners and real methodologists who had and were using
computer software to address structural issues. I had availa-
ble to me a number of techniques that claimed to identify the
important structural properties of networks: how was I now
to choose among them?
I knew that if I were to use a technique, I had to under-
stand what it was doing and whether it was a sensible proce-
dure to use for my data. I could not simply take a method for
granted and use it just because it produced results: any
method might produce results and we need to know whether
the results are meaningful. I decided that I had to learn
FORTRAN programming so that I could follow through the
logic of the algorithms and discover exactly what manipula-
tions were being performed on the data. Poring over lengthy
computer printouts and decoding punched cards, I was able
to piece together a workable set of solutions for my data and
began the analysis.
This part of the research was undertaken in the early 1980s
when microcomputing was barely beginning. The software
available to me all worked on large mainframe computers.
Using some techniques in the GRADAP program that came
to be used for a comparative study in which I participated, I
prepared my data on punched card, transferred it to large reels
of tape, and sent the tape to the Netherlands where Frans
Stokman oversaw the analysis of the data on the CDC Cyber
computer for which the program had been written. Data runs
were long drawn-out processes and it took 2 or 3weeks before
the analyses were returned. The scope for re-analysis and the
correcting of mistakes was rather limited. Nevertheless, I had,
at last, real structural analyses of my data.
Further analysis, using a technique called blockmodel-
ling, relied on a program written by Clyde Mitchell to imple-
ment an algorithm called CONCOR. I had my own copy of
this program on a large set of punched cards. It was written
in FORTRAN and was far more easily transportable from
one computer to another than was the machine-specific
GRADAP. However, it was so demanding of computer
power that there was just one computer in the United
Kingdom capable of running it with the large data set that I
had. This was the Cray Supercomputer at Manchester on
which my own University at Leicester rented time each
week. Whenever I ran the CONCOR program, it used the
whole of the Leicester computer allocation for a week. Any
small mistake in the data meant that I had to reinput the pro-
gram the following week and this thoroughly hacked-off the
physicists who felt that a sociologist had no right to use a
computer.
These techniques, eventually transferred to microcomput-
ers and working far more rapidly in the late 1990s, provided
me with a set of concepts: density, centrality, cohesion,
cliques and so on, and allowed me to represent the data visu-
ally. Having visualised the concepts in simple diagrams,
however, it became possible to use the numbers output from
the program as shorthand descriptions of social structure.
The numbers allowed the researcher to imaginatively visual-
ise the structure of large networks.
Having arrived at a satisfactory way of analysing my data,
I decided to write up the results of my methodological inves-
tigations so that others could better understand their uses. I
produced some early reports and then a short handbook that
has now successfully gone through three editions. (Scott,
1992) This success again led me into presenting at numerous
lectures and workshops, to contributions to the Social Science
Encyclopaedia and the Encyclopedia of the Social and
Behavioural Sciences, and to the commissioning of specialist
pieces by real experts as Section Editor of the Encyclopedia
of Complexity Science. I was also asked to produce a multi-
volume edited collection on methods and their applications
(Scott, 2002). In cooperation with Peter Carrington and Stan
Wasserman, I edited a text on advanced methods of network
analysis (Carrington et al., 2005), and with Peter Carrington
edited The Sage Handbook of Social Network Analysis (Scott
and Carrington, 2011). One particular venture was the invita-
tion to present on network analysis in Graham Crow's `What
Is ...?'sessions at the Economic and Social Research Council
(ESRC) Festival of Social Science on three occasions, and
this led to the production of a primer called What is Social
Network Analysis? (Scott, 2012).

Reinventing the wheel
As a methodological innovator in uncharted methodological
areas, I have been identified as an expert methodologist. This
seems to be the fate of all who are seen as methodological
innovators. Recently, there has been much interest in the work
of physicists who have claimed to have produced revolution-
ary innovations in social network analysis. What surprises
those of us who have even dabbled in network methodology
is that their innovations have a rather familiar feel to them.
Alberto-Lazlo Barabási wrote in 2002 that physicists have
been able to highlight phenomena that are `unprecedented
and unexpected' in that they have discovered `a new and
unsuspected order within networks'and have `lifted complex
networks out of the jungle of randomness' (Barabási, 2002).
He held that `For the first time in history scientists are begin-
ning to learn how to talk meaningfully about the architecture
of networks'. Bold methodological innovation indeed! The
object of their innovation is the power law: the great discov-
ery that the distribution of connections in a network tends to
follow an exponential pattern.
This might sound familiar to readers of this article. I
showed that one of my earliest empirical findings was exactly
this: 30years before the great discovery made by the physi-
cists. I plotted my data for a number of years and found
exactly the same pattern of the power law. I also examined
the findings of a number of other studies in various countries
published since 1972, and these all showed the same expo-
nential `power law' distribution.
Physicists would have received a more enthusiastic wel-
come from social network analysts if instead of ignoring eve-
rything that we have done and reinventing the wheel in the
name of an innovation they had recognised that they were
building on the bedrock of sociological achievements in net-
work analysis. This would have allowed a more rapid, and
less begrudging, recognition of their real innovation, which
is to try to explain why it is that the exponential distribution
occurs in so many networks and to propose dynamic models
of network evolution that can show the limits within which
`six degrees of connection' and the power law hold.
Future identities?
It is for all of these reasons that I have emphasised that I am
not a methodologist. I am not an expert in methodology but
simply an enthusiastic amateur who has accidentally and
reluctantly got involved in methodology because it helps me
to understand the real world. Although I have exercised this
role distance, the identification is difficult to escape. I
recently received an invitation from a major publisher to edit
an eight volume Encyclopaedia of Research Methods.
Although the advance was attractive, I decided that I simply
did not have the all-round methodological expertise to carry
off the task. I can blag my way in social network analysis and
documentary research methods but pretending to cover the
whole area of social research methods is another matter.
Nevertheless, I did subsequently agree to produce a fourth
edition of my text on Social Network Analysis, so my acci-
dental adventures continue.
