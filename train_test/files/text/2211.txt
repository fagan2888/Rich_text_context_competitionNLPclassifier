Multidrug use is well documented among nonmedical users of prescription stimulants. We
sought to provide insight into the drug use patterns of those reporting nonmedical use of
prescription attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) stimulants in an attempt to dis-
cern whether such use is a first step in a pattern of drug-abusing behavior or, conversely, is
a later development accompanied or preceded by a history of drug abuse. A cross-sectional,
population-based survey of the U.S. civilian, non-institutionalized population aged 12 years
and older was analyzed for lifetime nonmedical use of prescription ADHD stimulants, life-
time nonmedical use of another prescription drug, illicit drug use, and drug use initiation
patterns. This included 443,041 respondents from the 2002­2009 National Survey on Drug
Use and Health. Lifetime nonmedical use of prescription ADHD stimulants was reported
by 3.4% of those aged 12 years and older. Of these, 95.3% also reported use of an illicit
drug (i.e., marijuana, cocaine/crack, heroin, hallucinogens, inhalants) or nonmedical use of
another prescription drug (i.e., tranquilizers, pain relievers, or sedatives), and such use pre-
ceded nonmedical use of prescription ADHD stimulants in 77.6% of cases. On average, 2.40
drugs were used prior to the first nonmedical use of prescription ADHD stimulants. These
data suggest that nonmedical use of prescription ADHD stimulants is not commonly an initi-
ating factor leading to the nonmedical use of other prescription medications or abuse of illicit
drugs. Rather, nonmedical use of prescription ADHD stimulants appears to be adopted by
individuals already engaged in broader patterns of drug abuse and misuse.

the pharmacologic treatment of ADHD and
have been demonstrated to be effective in the
treatment of ADHD.4,5 However, as with other
drugs affecting the central nervous system, they
have the potential to be misused, abused, and
diverted for nonmedical purposes.6
Nonmedical usei of prescription ADHD
stimulants has been documented among young
adults in general and college students in par-
ticular, with rates of past-year nonmedical use
ranging from 5% to 35% in various studies of
college-age individuals.7 Kroutil et al.8 found
the past-year prevalence of nonmedical use of
ADHD stimulants to be higher among young
adults aged 18 to 25 years (1.3%) than among
individuals aged 12 to 17 years (0.9%) or those
aged 26 years or older (0.1%).8
Several studies have examined the corre-
lates of nonmedical use of prescription stimu-
lants, finding that those who engaged in non-
medical use of prescription stimulants may also
have engaged in nonmedical use and abuse
of other drugs.9­13 For example, in a study of
college students, McCabe et al.10 reported that
students who engaged in nonmedical use (de-
fined as "use not under a doctor's orders") of at
least one of three prescription stimulant brands
(Ritalin, Dexedrine, and Adderall) were more
likely to report illicit drug use, including use
of marijuana, ecstasy, cocaine, and nonmedi-
cal use of prescription opioids.10
This association has also been demon-
strated among young adults outside of the col-
lege setting. For example, Herman-Stahl et al.11
analyzed young adult's responses (age range,
18­25 years) to the 2002 National Survey on
Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) and found
that using marijuana and other illegal drugs in-
creased the odds of both methamphetamine
and nonmedical prescription stimulant use.
Similarly, Wu et al.14 found that 16 to 25
year olds reporting prescription stimulant mis-
use (defined as nonmedical use, use that was
not prescribed, or use only for the experience
or feeling it caused) were likely to report using
three or more illicit drugs at least once in their
lifetime.14
Although multi-drug use is well docu-
mented among nonmedical users of prescrip-
tion stimulants, research to date has typically
been limited to young adults or college stu-
dents. Furthermore, limited analyses have been
performed of drug use initiation patterns (i.e.,
whether the other drug use occurred before,
during, or after the same time period as the non-
medical prescription stimulant use). Using data
from the 2002­2004 NSDUH, Colliver et al.15
examined the order of first nonmedical use of
prescription stimulants and other prescription
drugs and illicit drugs among lifetime users and
found that the age at initial nonmedical use of
stimulants was more often earlier than initial use
of several other drugs, including crack cocaine,
heroin, ecstasy, cocaine, prescription tranquil-
izers, PCP, and prescription pain relievers. Ini-
tial use of alcohol, cigarettes, marijuana, and
inhalants preceded initial misuse of stimulants
for most users of stimulants and other drugs.
However, the broad category of stimulant med-
ications, as measured in the NSDUH and re-
ported by Colliver et al.,15 is composed of not
only ADHD medications, but also prescription
diet pills and methamphetamine. We sought to
provide insight into the drug use histories of
those specifically reporting nonmedical use of
prescription ADHD stimulants in an attempt to
discern whether nonmedical use of prescription
ADHD stimulants was the first step in a pattern
of abusing behavior or, conversely, whether it
is a later development following a preexisting
history of drug abuse. We also sought to ex-
amine and compare the demographic charac-
teristics of those reporting nonmedical use of
prescription ADHD stimulants, those reporting
other drug use, and those reporting no drug
use. This study examined the drug use patterns
and correlates of those reporting nonmedical
use of prescription ADHD stimulants in a gen-
eral population sample, based on data from
the 2002­2009 NSDUH. Unlike prior datasets,
which were largely restricted to young adults,
the NSDUH affords an opportunity to exam-
ine nonmedical use in a broad U.S. population,
including adolescents, young adults, and adults.
METHODS
We conducted an analysis of the public use data
from the NSDUH, an annual household-based
NONMEDICAL USE OF PRESCRIPTION ADHD STIMULANTS 3
survey sponsored by the U.S. Substance Abuse
and Mental Health Services Administration. The
NSDUH collects information on the preva-
lence, patterns, and consequences of drug and
alcohol use and abuse via in-person, computer-
assisted interviews from a representative sample
of the civilian, noninstitutionalized U.S. pop-
ulation aged 12 years and older. Specifically,
NSDUH collects information from residents of
households and noninstitutional group quarters
(e.g., shelters, rooming houses, dormitories) and
from civilians living on military bases. The sur-
vey excludes homeless individuals who do not
use shelters, military personnel on active duty,
and residents of institutional group quarters,
such as jails and hospitals. The data used in
this analysis are based on information obtained
from a total of 443,041 respondents to the 2002
through 2009 surveys. Analysis weights were
created so that estimates would be representa-
tive of the target population.
The NSDUH solicits information about the
nonmedical use of four broad categories of pre-
scription medications: stimulants, pain reliev-
ers, tranquilizers, and sedatives. Nonmedical
use is defined in the NSDUH as use of these
medications without a prescription of the re-
spondent's own or use simply for the expe-
rience or feeling the drug caused. The sur-
vey includes questions that allow for estimation
of nonmedical use of these broad categories
of prescription drugs in the participant's life-
time, the past year, and the past month. The
NSDUH also contains detailed questions about
the nonmedical use of a large set of specific
medications. However, this information is gen-
erally limited to use at any time in the indi-
vidual's life (i.e., lifetime use). Additional infor-
mation (e.g., age of first use) is generally only
obtained for the broad drug categories, not for
specific medications.
For questions regarding nonmedical use of
prescription stimulants, respondents are pre-
sented with a single placard containing pictures
of the common dosage forms of several dif-
ferent prescription stimulants and a listing of
only the names of some others. The stimulant
category includes prescription-type metham-
phetamine (e.g., Desoxyn), prescription diet
pills, and ADHD medications. Our focus was
on assessing the nonmedical use of stimulants
with specific indications for the treatment of
ADHD (Table 1).
Several ADHD medications are pre-
sented in one of three groups (Ritalin
and Methylphenidate constitute one such
group). The remaining medications (including
Dexedrine and dextroamphetamine) are pre-
sented individually on the placard. Respon-
dents are instructed to review the stimulant

aTwo recently approved stimulants for the treatment of ADHD (Daytrana, approved in 2006, and Vyvanse, approved in 2007) were
not included in this analysis because they were not available throughout the entire time period of study. However, an examination
of NSDUH data revealed no reports of nonmedical use of Daytrana in response to open-ended questions in 2006­2009; <0.01% of
respondents reported nonmedical use of Vyvanse in both 2009 and 2008 in response to open-ended questions, although there were no
reports of nonmedical use in 2007.

placard and are asked the following for each
group:
Have you ever, even once, used [Ritalin or
Methylphenidate] that was not prescribed
for you or that you took only for the expe-
rience or feeling it caused?
For the medications presented individually on
the card (including Dexedrine and dextroam-
phetamine), respondents are told to look at all
of the pictured or listed medications and are
asked:
Which of the stimulants shown below the
red line on Card C have you used when
they were not prescribed for you or that
you took only for the experience or feeling
they caused?
Nonmedical use for the remaining ADHD stim-
ulants (e.g., Biphetamine, DextroStat, Con-
certa, Dexamyl, dexmethylphenidate/Focalin,
Metadate, Methylin) was captured via the fol-
lowing open-ended question:
Have you ever, even once, used any other
prescription stimulant, besides the ones
shown on Card C when it was not pre-
scribed for you or that you took only for
the experience or feeling it caused?
If the respondent answers "yes" to this question,
then he or she is asked to state which other pre-
scription stimulant they used. The medications
in the previously described questions could also
be captured in this open-ended question. Thus,
information on the nonmedical use of prescrip-
tion ADHD stimulants is captured via responses
to both close-ended questions that directly ask
about nonmedical use of specific ADHD med-
ications and open-ended questions that ask
broadly about any other prescription stimulant
use.
Prior to 2006, information on nonmedical
use of Adderall (any formulation) was captured
via the open-ended question about some other
stimulant. However, in 2006 a series of ques-
tions specifically about Adderall were added
to a section of the survey entitled "Special
Drugs" in which respondents are asked the
following:
Adderall is a prescription stimulant that
comes in tablet or capsule form. Adderall
tablets and capsules are shown below. Have
you ever, even once, used Adderall that was
not prescribed for you or that you took only
for the experience or feeling it caused?
Those who reported any nonmedical use
of Adderall were further asked when they had
last used Adderall nonmedically (i.e., within the
past 30 days, more than 30 days ago but within
the past 12 months, or more than 12 months
ago). For our purposes, a person was considered
to have engaged in nonmedical use of prescrip-
tion ADHD stimulants if they reported any non-
medical use of a prescription stimulant specifi-
cally indicated for the treatment of ADHD (i.e.,
any of the medications listed in Table 1) during
their lifetime, whether based on a drug-specific,
closed-ended question (including the Adderall-
specific questions added in 2006) or an open-
ended question.
Questions regarding nonmedical use of
other prescription medications (i.e., prescrip-
tion pain relievers, tranquilizers, and sedatives)
are asked in a similar manner. Specifically, re-
spondents are shown visual examples of brand
name pills and asked:
Have you ever, even once, used [any of the
following medications when they were] not
prescribed for you or that you took only for
the experience or feeling they caused?
Respondents are also asked a follow-up
question to assess nonmedical use of other pre-
scription medications:
Have you ever, even once, used any other
[prescription medication], besides the ones
shown . . . when it was not prescribed for
you or that you took only for the experience
or feeling it caused?
Respondents who answer this question af-
firmatively are then asked to provide the names
of other prescription medications used non-
medically. The names of up to five other pre-
scription drugs may be provided for each cat-
egory (pain relievers, tranquilizers, stimulants,
and sedatives).
The NSDUH also collects information on
age at first nonmedical use for the four broad
NONMEDICAL USE OF PRESCRIPTION ADHD STIMULANTS 5
categories of prescription drug type (How old
were you the first time you used any pre-
scription [pain reliever/tranquilizer/stimulant/
sedative] that was not prescribed for you or that
you took only for the experience or feeling it
caused?). This information is only collected at
the category level, and not for specific medica-
tions within the broader class. Age at first use of
illicit street drugs (e.g., cocaine/crack, inhalants,
marijuana/hashish, heroin, and hallucinogens)
is also collected.
ANALYSIS
We calculated the percentage of those who
reported ever having engaged in nonmedical
use of a prescription ADHD stimulant in the
NSDUH surveys of 2002­2009. Sample sizes
reported are unweighted; all percentages and
mean ages that are reported are weighted.
Table 1 includes the list of specific ADHD stim-
ulants that were incorporated in this measure.
Among those who reported ever having en-
gaged in nonmedical use of prescription ADHD
stimulants, we calculated the age at first non-
medical use for the broad category of prescrip-
tion stimulants (because information on age at
first use for specific stimulant medications, in-
cluding ADHD medications, was not available).
Thus, for those who engaged in nonmedical
use of prescription ADHD stimulants only (and
did not report nonmedical use of any other
prescription stimulant medication) the reported
age at first use specifically represents the age at
first nonmedical use for an ADHD medication.
For those who reported engaging in nonmedical
use of other stimulants, as well as nonmedical
use of prescription ADHD stimulants, it is not
possible to determine whether the reported age
at first use refers to nonmedical use of an ADHD
medication or another type of stimulant medi-
cation. In this case, the reported age at first use
is only a proxy for age at first nonmedical use
of prescription ADHD stimulants.
Among those who reported ever having en-
gaged in nonmedical use of prescription ADHD
stimulants, the reported age at first nonmed-
ical use of any other prescription drug class
(i.e., tranquilizers, pain relievers, and sedatives)
and age at first use of any illicit drug use were
also calculated. The reported average age for
first nonmedical stimulant use was compared
with the average age for first use of other
drugs to determine the proportion of those
engaged in nonmedical use of prescription
ADHD stimulants for whom initial use of other
drugs (marijuana, cocaine/crack, heroin, hallu-
cinogens, and nonmedical use of tranquilizers,
pain relievers, and sedatives) occurred prior
to their initial nonmedical use of prescription
stimulants.
We also examined the following poten-
tial correlates of nonmedical use of prescrip-
tion ADHD stimulants: age, sex, race/ethnicity,
marital status, education, employment status,
and population density. Chi-square statistics
and corresponding P values were calculated
to compare the demographic characteristics of
those reporting nonmedical use of prescrip-
tion ADHD stimulants with the following two
groups: those reporting other nonmedical use
or illicit drug use (but no nonmedical use of pre-
scription ADHD stimulants) and those report-
ing no drug use (meaning no nonmedical use
of prescription ADHD stimulants and no non-
medical use of other pharmaceuticals or use of
illicit drugs). These statistics were calculated us-
ing SUDDAAN version 10.0.1, which accounts
for the complex weighting scheme used by the
NSDUH.
RESULTS
Over the study, 3.4% of Americans aged
12 years and older reported ever having en-
gaged in nonmedical use of prescription ADHD
stimulants. Among those, 16.8% reported non-
medical use of ADHD stimulants exclusively,
whereas the remaining 83.2% reported non-
medical use of other stimulants in addition to
ADHD stimulants (e.g., prescription diet pills
and methamphetamine). Table 2 compares the
demographic characteristics of (1) those re-
porting any lifetime nonmedical use of pre-
scription ADHD stimulants; (2) those report-
ing other nonmedical use or illicit drug use
(including nonmedical use of non-ADHD pre-
scription stimulants for those not reporting any

nonmedical use of prescription ADHD stimu-
lants); and (3) those reporting no drug use (i.e.,
no nonmedical use of prescription ADHD stim-
ulants, no nonmedical use of other pharmaceu-
ticals and no use of illicit drugs).
Overall, compared with those reporting
other nonmedical use or illicit drug use and
those reporting no drug use, those reporting
lifetime nonmedical use of prescription ADHD
stimulants tended to be younger, male, Cau-
casian, and unmarried; 57.7% of those re-
porting lifetime nonmedical use of prescription
ADHD stimulants were 26 years and older com-
pared with 78.3% for those reporting other drug
use and 76.2% for those reporting no drug use.
Compared with the other two groups, a sig-
nificantly larger percentage of those reporting
nonmedical use of prescription ADHD stimu-
lants were men (57.4% vs. 53.1% for other drug
users and 44.2% for those reporting no drug
use). Of those reporting nonmedical use of pre-
scription ADHD stimulants, 87.0% were Cau-
casian, Non-Hispanic, versus 72.8% for those
reporting other drug use and 64.5% for those
reporting no drug use. Among those reporting
nonmedical use of prescription ADHD stimu-
lants, 69.0% were unmarried versus 49.3% for
those reporting other drug use and 44.1% for
those reporting no drug use.
The majority (95.3%) of those reporting
nonmedical use of prescription ADHD stimu-
lants also reported use of at least one illicit drug
(i.e., marijuana, cocaine/crack, heroin, hallu-
cinogens, inhalants) or nonmedical use of at
least one other prescription drug (i.e., tranquil-
izers, pain relievers, sedatives, or non-ADHD
stimulants). Such use preceded nonmedical use
of prescription ADHD stimulants in 77.6% of
cases; on average, 2.40 (95% CI = 2.35­2.45)
drugs were used prior to nonmedical use of
prescription ADHD stimulants. Among those re-
porting nonmedical use of prescription ADHD
stimulants who also reported use of an illicit
drug or nonmedical use of another prescrip-
tion drug, the most commonly reported other
drugs were marijuana (90.6%), hallucinogens
(68.2%), and prescription pain relievers (66.1%)
(Table 3). These users also frequently reported

use of cocaine (61.4%) and nonmedical use of
prescription tranquilizers (52.2%).
Among those reporting any nonmedical use
of prescription ADHD stimulants, the average
age at first nonmedical use of a prescription
stimulant was 19.45 years (Table 3) compared
with an average age of 15.69 years for the initi-
ation of other drug use. Considering those who
only reported nonmedical use of prescription
ADHD stimulants (i.e., those who did not re-
port nonmedical use of any other stimulant
type aside from ADHD stimulants), the reported
mean age at first nonmedical use of a pre-
scription stimulant was 21.06 years. Consider-
ing those who reported nonmedical use of other
prescription stimulants, in addition to nonmedi-
cal use of ADHD stimulants, the reported mean
age at first nonmedical use of a prescription
stimulant was 19.38 years. Reported first use
of marijuana (average age = 15.92 years), in-
halants (average age = 17.48 years), hallucino-
gens (average age = 17.95 years), and nonmed-
ical use of prescription pain relievers (average
age = 19.37 years) occurred at a younger age
compared with the first reported nonmedical
use of a prescription stimulant.
DISCUSSION
Our findings suggest that nonmedical use of
prescription ADHD stimulants is not commonly
the initiating factor leading to the abuse of other
drugs. Rather, nonmedical use of prescription
ADHD stimulants appears to be adopted by in-
dividuals already engaged in broader patterns
of drug abuse and nonmedical use.
Extending previous research on the corre-
lates of nonmedical use of prescription stim-
ulants among young adults and college stu-
dents, we found in a general population sam-
ple that those who reported having engaged
in nonmedical use of prescription ADHD stim-
ulants also reported having engaged in other
drug use. Among those reporting lifetime non-
medical use of prescription ADHD stimulants
in our study, 95.3% also reported use of an
illicit drug or nonmedical use of another pre-
scription drug class, with such use typically (in
77.6% of cases) preceding nonmedical use of
prescription ADHD stimulants. This suggests a
broad trend of individuals already engaged in
drug abuse and misuse who seek out new drugs
as they become available. It does not suggest
that prescription stimulants indicated for the
8 C. T. SWEENEY ET AL.
treatment of ADHD have any particular appeal
for first-time or na¨
ive nonmedical users of drugs.
In fact, available research suggests that individu-
als who are treated for ADHD are at a lower risk
for developing a subsequent substance abuse
disorder than those with untreated ADHD.16
Our study also extends prior research by
providing some insight into the patterns of
drug use over a user's career. For those re-
porting both nonmedical use of prescription
ADHD stimulants and other drug use, the other
drug use preceded nonmedical use of pre-
scription ADHD stimulants in 77.6% of cases,
with an average of 2.40 drugs reportedly used
prior to the first nonmedical use of prescrip-
tion ADHD stimulants. Because the NSDUH
question about age of first use pertains to all
prescription stimulants (not ADHD stimulants
specifically), this indicates that nonmedical use
of prescription ADHD stimulants first occurred
after at least 2.40 other drugs were used non-
medically or illicitly. It was not possible to
tell how often nonmedical use of prescription
ADHD stimulants occurred only after nonmed-
ical use of other prescription stimulants had al-
ready been initiated because the NSDUH only
characterizes initiation of nonmedical use of the
prescription stimulant class, without regard to
brand. This likely results in under-counting of
drug use preceding nonmedical use of prescrip-
tion ADHD stimulants. For example, someone
who engaged in nonmedical use of prescription
diet pills prior to nonmedical use of prescrip-
tion ADHD stimulants would not be counted as
having engaged in nonmedical use prior to non-
medical use of prescription ADHD stimulants.
Consequently, the data underestimate the ex-
tent that drug use preceded nonmedical use of
prescription ADHD stimulants.
It is unknown how many of those reporting
nonmedical use of prescription ADHD stimu-
lants in our study had also been prescribed the
drug legitimately; that is, the data are not able to
distinguish between the misuse of ADHD med-
ications by those for whom it is prescribed and
nonmedical use by those without a prescrip-
tion. However, prior research has found misuse
among both groups to be associated with mul-
tidrug use. For example, in a college sample,
similar proportions of those with and without a
prescription for stimulants (16%­18%) reported
nonmedical use of stimulants (defined as use of
any form of prescription stimulants that were
not prescribed for you or that you took only
for the experience or feeling they caused or
overuse of a medically prescribed stimulant),
and lifetime nonmedical use was independently
and significantly associated with past year use
of marijuana, inhalants, cocaine, hallucinogens,
heroin, amphetamines or methamphetamine,
ecstasy, prescription analgesics, and prescrip-
tion tranquilizers.9
This study has several limitations. First, re-
sults cannot be generalized to those population
groups excluded from the NSDUH sampling
frame, including homeless individuals who do
not use shelters, active military personnel, and
residents of institutional group quarters, such
as jails and hospitals. The NSDUH only obtains
information on lifetime nonmedical use of spe-
cific brands of prescription stimulants; it is not
designed to estimate current use at the brand-
specific level. Because the NSDUH question
about age of first use pertains to all prescription
stimulants (not ADHD stimulants specifically),
it was not possible to tell how often nonmed-
ical use of prescription ADHD stimulants oc-
curred only after nonmedical use of other pre-
scription stimulants had already been initiated.
Furthermore, the information on age at first use
is based on retrospective self-report, and there-
fore is subject to recall bias. In addition, the cal-
culated percentage of other drug use preceding
nonmedical use of prescription ADHD stimu-
lants could be affected by older adults who may
have used other substances in adolescence or
early adulthood before the prescribing of stimu-
lants for the treatment of ADHD became more
prevalent.
The specific survey question on which es-
timates of lifetime nonmedical use are based
does not allow for differentiation between what
might typically be considered abuse of prescrip-
tion stimulants (e.g., for psychotropic effect)
and situations involving use by an individual
for whom the medication was not prescribed,
even if it was taken only once and for a purpose
consistent with the therapeutic effect (e.g., an
NONMEDICAL USE OF PRESCRIPTION ADHD STIMULANTS 9
adult with suspected ADHD who took the med-
ication prescribed for their child, experienced
the medication benefits, and then went on to
receive a legitimate prescription after consult-
ing a physician). Finally, the NSDUH does not
collect information on motives for nonmedical
use, which would provide better understanding
of the behavior.
Nonmedical use of prescription ADHD
stimulants does not appear to be an initiat-
ing factor leading to the nonmedical use of
other prescription medications or abuse of il-
licit drugs. Rather, nonmedical use of prescrip-
tion ADHD stimulants appears to be adopted
by individuals already engaged in broader pat-
terns of drug abuse and misuse.
Note
i. The definition of nonmedical use can vary by study
but is defined by the SAMHSA and in this article as
"use that was not prescribed or that you took only
for the experience or feeling it caused."17 In cases where
the term is used in other published article, we specify
the exact definition of the term as used by the study
authors.
