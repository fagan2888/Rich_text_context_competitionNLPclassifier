The creation of meaning to cope with trauma is seemingly
universal. In her influential piece on cognitive adaptation,
Shelley Taylor (1983) outlines steps commonly taken in
the wake of trauma: the generation of meaning, the bolster-
ing of perceived control, and self-enhancement. The first
step in this cognitive process, the creation of meaning, is
often accomplished through the generation of a causal
attribution. Empirical evidence supports the process of
meaning creation via causal attributions among patients
diagnosed with various forms of cardiovascular disease
(CVD). For example, Cameron etal. (2005) found that the
most common causal attributions endorsed by myocardial
infarction (MI) patients via a checklist method were stress,
high cholesterol, heredity, and eating fatty foods, and that
these attributions remained stable over a 6-month follow-
up period. Another study found not only similar types of
attributions generated by MI patients at baseline (i.e.
smoking, heredity, and stress) but also some volatility in
endorsement over time (Reges etal., 2011). Specifically, at
2-year post-hospitalization, more patients endorsed high
cholesterol, lack of physical activity, and problems at work
as causes than at baseline. Day etal. (2005) found that
the most commonly endorsed attributions among CVD
patients via a checklist were heredity, hypertension, high
cholesterol, physical inactivity, and poor food habits.
Furthermore, nearly one-third of the sample endorsed
stress/negative emotions as a causal factor in their diagno-
ses. A more recent study among coronary artery bypass
graft (CABG) patients that used an attribution checklist
found the most common causes to be stress and genes for
both men and women (Dunkel etal., 2011). Results also
pointed to a gender difference: whereas men were more
likely than women to make an attribution to past behavior,
women were more likely than men to attribute their diag-
nosis to destiny.
The above-mentioned studies examined attributions
generated via a checklist, but other researchers have col-
lected patients' open-ended causal explanations. For exam-
ple, Martin etal. (2005) qualitatively analyzed MI patients'
attributions, collapsing them into the following commonly
Causal attributions following a cardiac
event: Short- and long-term differences
in health appraisals and outcomes

Abstract
This study examined attributions generated by cardiac rehabilitation patients shortly after experiencing a cardiovascular
event, exploring whether attribution type was associated with health appraisals and outcomes concurrently and 21months
later. Attributions fell into three categories: controllable behavioral ones, uncontrollable biological ones, and stress-
related causes. Linking attribution type to appraisals and outcomes showed that creating a behavioral attribution was
beneficial in the short-term for control appraisals, but was associated with increased anxiety symptoms 21months later.
Thus, cardiac rehabilitation providers should encourage patients to maintain a future-focus that promotes perceived
control over health promotion behaviors that reduce risk for recurrence.

cited categories: stress, comorbidities, diet, smoking,
heredity, and physical inactivity. Comparisons by gender
showed that men were significantly more likely to generate
controllable behavioral attributions compared to women.
This gender difference translated to behavioral disparities
3
months later, as men were more likely to self-report
improvements in diet and exercise habits compared to
women. Astin and Jones (2004) qualitatively examined
CVD patients' causal attributions, collapsing them into
three main categories: biological causes, behavioral causes,
and stress. Results revealed gender differences, such that
women were more likely than men to generate biological
and stress attributions, but men were more likely than
women to create behavioral attributions. The same three
attributional themes were found by Bennett and Marte
(2013) among cardiac rehabilitation (CR) patients, but
these authors reported no gender differences in biological
or stress attributions and only a trend for men to create
more behavioral attributions than women. Therefore, ample
evidence exists than CVD patients engage in a causal
search following a cardiac event, and that these attributions
typically fall into three categories: controllable behavioral
causes, uncontrollable biological causes, and stress (e.g.
Stafford etal., 2008).
Researchers have begun to more deeply investigate how
these three types of attributions affect physical and psycho-
logical recovery. Two studies suggest adaptive effects on
recovery from the creation of behavioral or modifiable/con-
trollable causal attributions. Blair et
al. (2014) studied
patients' attributions for their cardiac events, using them to
predict attendance at CR. Results showed that patients who
created attributions to causes that were controllable (e.g. diet
and physical inactivity) were more likely to attend CR than
patients who generated uncontrollable attributions, even after
controlling for sociodemographic variables such as sex and
distance to the nearest CR site. An intervention study by
Broadbent et
al. (2009) aimed to strengthen controllable
behavioral attributions among patients post-MI. Results
showed that the intervention group endorsed high cholesterol
and physical inactivity to greater degrees post-intervention
compared to the control group. Furthermore, these authors
suggest that their attributional retraining was adaptive because
the intervention group was more likely to return to work at the
3-month follow-up compared to the control group.
Whereas support has been found for behavioral attribu-
tions assisting in recovery, the effects of stress attributions on
adjustment are mixed. On one hand, Dunkel et
al. (2011)
found that CABG patients who endorsed stress and personal-
ity causal attributions at baseline had a worsening of depres-
sive symptoms over a 1-year period, after controlling for a
host of sociodemographic and clinical factors. On the other
hand, Bennett and Marte (2013) reported that baseline stress
attributions were associated with improvements in a measure
of energy expenditure over the course of CR, and that self-
reported engagement in healthy behaviors mediated the
relation. Furthermore, little work has investigated the effect
of biological attributions on adjustment and recovery. One
study was located that examined a sample of older adults with
chronic health conditions, the most common of which was
heart disease (42%; Stewart etal., 2012). Results showed that
endorsing an "old age" attribution (i.e. a biological one that is
uncontrollable) for one's chronic health condition was associ-
ated with poor self-reported health, poor engagement in
health behaviors (e.g. eating a nutritious diet), and a greater
likelihood of death at the 2-year follow-up (36% vs 14%).
Hypothesis and research questions
This study was conducted to examine whether (a) attribu-
tions generated by a sample of CR patients align with pre-
vious research, (b) gender differences exist in the creation
of these attributions, and (c) these attributions have effects
on health appraisals and outcomes. Prior studies suggest
that patients' attributions fall into three main categories:
behavioral causes that are largely controllable (e.g. lack of
exercise and poor diet), biological causes that are largely
uncontrollable (e.g. heredity), and interpersonal stressors.
These categories have emerged across studies that use
open-ended questions and checklist formats, hence
Hypothesis 1. Participants' attributions will fall into
three main categories: behavioral ones that are control-
lable, biological ones that are uncontrollable, and stress-
related causes.
Given gender differences documented in the literature,
we also hypothesized
Hypothesis 2. Men will be more likely to create behav-
ioral attributions than women, whereas women will be
more likely than men to create biological and stress
attributions.
Because evidence is mixed on the adjustment/recovery
effects of creating behavioral, biological, and stress attribu-
tions, we did not test specific hypotheses. Rather, we
explored whether these types of attributions result in differ-
ences in concurrent and prospective health appraisals and
outcomes through two research questions, specifically
Research Question 1. Are there concurrent differences
in health behaviors, perceptions of control, and psycho-
logical and physical health status as a function of the
type of attribution created at the beginning of CR?
and

in health behaviors, perceptions of control, and

Method
Participants
Baseline (i.e. Time 1) data were collected from 209 patients
(65.6% male) enrolled in a CR in a Midwestern state. Ages
ranged from 25 to 85
years, with an average age of
62.5
years (standard deviation (SD)=11.1years). A vast
majority of the sample reported their ethnic background to
be European American (91.8%). Other ethnicities repre-
sented in the sample include African American (5.3%) and
Native American (1.9%). Although most participants were
married or living with a partner (73.2%), 12.4
percent
reported being divorced, 9.1
percent were widowed,
3.8percent were single and had never married, and 1.4per-
cent was separated from their partners at the time of the
study. Most participants had completed high school or
attended a college or trade school (47.9%), whereas
11.6percent held a 2-year college degree, 22.2percent held
a 4-year college degree, and 15.9
percent completed a
graduate degree. A majority of participants reported not
working outside the home (58.7%), and the average house-
hold income range for the previous year was between
US$50,000 and US$59,999.
Participants in this study varied widely in the diagnosis
for which they were referred to CR. The most common
diagnosis, for which 39.0
percent were referred, was the
placement of a stent. The other most common diagnoses
were CABG (17.6%), MI with the placement of a stent
(13.8%), and valve replacement or repair (9.0%). All par-
ticipants were stratified by risk for disease progression on
the basis of the American Association of Cardiovascular
and Pulmonary Rehabilitation (2004) guidelines. Risk
stratification assignments of low (59.4%), moderate
(36.1%), or high (4.4%) were made by CR staff and based
on participants' diagnoses, prior cardiac events if appro-
priate, and current risk factors (e.g. smoking, concurrent
ailments, and diet). Participants attended an average of
16.1 exercise sessions (SD=7.1) during their 12-week CR
programs.
Follow-up data were collected from 112 participants
(53.6%) 21
months later. The follow-up sample was
67.0
percent male with an average age of 63.7
years
(SD=10.2years), 91.9percent were European American,
76.8
percent were married or living with a partner,
43.8percent had completed high school or attended a col-
lege or trade school, most (i.e. 58.6%) did not work out-
side the home, and the average household income range
for the previous year was between US$60,000 and
US$69,999. A series of chi-squares and independent sam-
ple t-tests were conducted to determine whether the fol-
low-up sample differed from the baseline sample on any
demographic or study variable. Results showed that the
follow-up sample was older (M=63.68), better educated
(M
=
5.00), and had lower risk stratifications for disease
progression (M
=
1.36) than the full baseline sample
(Ms
=
60.59, 4.45, and 1.56, respectively). Therefore,
some caution is warranted in generalizing prospective
findings to the full sample.
Procedure
Participants were recruited through a Phase II CR program
in a Midwestern city. Phase II CR programs typically run
for 12weeks and are primarily comprised of monitored
exercise classes. Recruitment for the study occurred in
two phases. First, CR staff members summarized the
study's objectives and procedures during introductory,
intake interviews with new patients. If patients provided
preliminary written consent, their contact information
was forwarded to our research team. The second phase
of recruitment occurred when our research team mem-
bers called these interested patients within 1
week of
their intake interviews. During these phone calls, more
detailed information about the study was provided to
patients, and if they expressed interest, a study packet
with a consent form, Time 1 questionnaire, and postage-
paid return envelope was mailed to them. Research team
members communicated to prospective participants that
they were not obligated to participate if they received a
study packet by mail. If, after reading through the mate-
rials, a patient consented to being in the study, he/she
was asked to sign the consent form and return it, along
with the completed questionnaire, in the enclosed enve-
lope. Follow-up questionnaires (i.e. Time 2) were mailed
to participants 21months later, approximately 18months
following completion of CR. Participants returned their
completed Time 2 questionnaires to us in postage-paid
envelopes. All study procedures were approved by the
appropriate hospital and university institutional review
boards.
Measures
Questionnaires comprising several standardized measures,
as well as items specifically designed for this study, were
used at Time 1 and Time 2.
Cardiac attributions. At Time 1, using an open-ended ques-
tion, participants were asked what they believed to be the
main cause of their cardiac events: "If you had to pick one
major cause for your heart condition, in your own words,
what would that cause be?" Participants were provided a
space in which to write their answers. The use of a single,
open-ended question to assess causal attributions for car-
diac events is supported by results of French etal. (2005),
who found that although MI patients can identify multiple
4 Health Psychology Open 
possible causes, most focused on a single cause for their
cardiac events.
Cardiac symptom experiences. Patients' experiences of car-
diac-related symptoms were assessed with three questions
adapted from Rose (1962) at Time 1 and Time 2. Partici-
pants were asked how many times during the preceding
2
weeks they suffered from three common CVD-related
symptoms: (a) pain in chest, (b) pressure or heaviness in
chest, and (c) shortness of breath. Responses were made on
a 5-point scale (1
=never and 5=
more than 15 times) and
summed, with high scores indicating frequent experience
of symptoms.
Engagement in health-promoting behaviors.Participants'
engagement in healthy behaviors was assessed with six
items adapted from Naslund and Fredrikson (1993) at Time
1 and Time 2. Items measured how often during the past
month participants engaged in a variety of healthy and
unhealthy behaviors (e.g. eating red meat, fruits, and vege-
tables and engaging in light or moderate intensity work-
outs) on a 7-point scale (1=never and 7=more than once a
day). Responses were summed so that higher values reflect
engagement in more healthy behaviors.
Control appraisals.Perceptions of control were measured
with two items adapted from Bennett et
al. (2005) that
focus on CVD-related recovery and prevention: "In gen-
eral, how much personal control do you think you have in
recovering from your cardiac event?" and "How much per-
sonal control do you think you have in preventing another
cardiac event?" Responses to these two questions were
made on a 4-point scale (1=very little and 4=total) at Time
1 and Time 2.
Symptoms of anxiety. Participants completed the Beck Anx-
iety Inventory (BAI; Beck and Steer, 1990) to measure the
degree to which they experienced symptoms of anxiety at
Time 1 and Time 2. The BAI presents 21 common symp-
toms of anxiety such as difficulty breathing and hands
trembling. Respondents were asked to report the frequency
they experienced these symptoms along a 4-point scale
(0=not at all and 3=severely). Scores can range from 0 to
63, with high scores reflecting high symptoms of anxiety.
Symptoms of depression. Depressive symptoms were meas-
ured with the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II; Beck
etal., 1996) at Time 1 and Time 2. The BDI-II asks partici-
pants to rate their degree of agreement with 21 items tap-
ping symptoms of depression such as sadness, loss of
pleasure, and fatigue. Respondents rated their degree of
agreement with these items along a 4-point scale (0=I do
not feel sad and 3
=
I am so sad or unhappy that I can't
stand it). Possible scores range from 0 to 63, with high
scores reflecting high depressive symptoms.
Results
Table 1 provides descriptive statistics, coefficient alphas
(where appropriate), and correlations for all study
variables.
Hypothesis 1: content analyses of attributions
The sample of 209 participants generated 244 different
attributions for their cardiac events. Seven participants left
the attribution question blank and were excluded from the
analyses presented below. Of the remaining 202 partici-
pants, most (168; 83%) generated only one attribution for
their cardiac events; however, 26 participants generated
two attributions (13%) and eight participants generated
three attributions (4%). In order to test Hypothesis 1 (i.e.
that attributions will fall into behavioral, biological, and
stress themes), content analyses of these attributions fol-
lowed a multi-step process. First, four coders reviewed a
random sample of 25percent of the attributions, devoid of
any identifiers, in order to develop a set of common themes
(or coding categories). Individually, coders generated a list
of themes into which the random sample of attributions fell.
Second, a group meeting was held wherein themes were
compared, discussed, and amended, resulting in a set of 13
agreed-upon coding categories. Third, the four coders inde-
pendently assigned another random sample of 25percent of
the attributions into these 13 coding categories. Fourth, a
meeting was held to discuss the codings, resolve any dis-
crepancies, and revise the coding categories if needed.
Consensus was reached on the assignment of attributions to
the coding categories, and no revision to those coding cat-
egories was necessary. Fifth, the four coders individually
reviewed and assigned the remaining 75percent of the attri-
butions into the coding categories. Sixth, a group meeting
was held wherein the coders discussed and resolved all dis-
crepancies.Across all attributions, coders agreed 91percent
of the time, yielding a free marginal kappa of .90.
Table 2 provides the 13 coding categories, the number of
attributions assigned to each category, and examples from
each coding category. Results showed that the most com-
mon type of attribution generated by participants was hered-
itary (25.8%), followed by poor diet (18.0%), stress (10.2%),
and poor self-care (9.8%). Consistent with Hypothesis 1,
these 13 categories can be further collapsed into three broad
causal themes found in the literature: (a) behavioral (con-
trollable) causes (poor diet, poor general self-care, lack of
exercise, smoking, and obesity); (b) biological (uncontrol-
lable) causes (heredity, non-cardiac-related conditions, car-
diac-related conditions, and age); and (c) stress. The
personality and miscellaneous categories (n=15) were
dropped from subsequent analyses. For the current sample,
92 participants (45.5%) generated a behavioral cause,
whereas 90 participants (44.6%) created a biological cause,
and 24 participants (11.9%) believed stress to be a cause. A
Bennett et al. 5
total of 11 participants (5.4%) created both behavioral and
biological attributions.
Hypothesis 2: gender differences
Chi-square analyses were conducted to test whether men cre-
ated more behavioral attributions than women, and whether
women created more biological attributions than men. Because
very few participants created stress attributions, gender com-
parisonswerenottested.Resultsrevealednogenderdifferences.
Men were just as likely as women to make behavioral attribu-
tions (2(1, n=202)=2.49, p
=
.11), while women were just as
likelyasmentomakebiologicalattributions(2(1,n=202)=0.16,
p=.68). Thus, Hypothesis 2 was not supported.

Research Questions 1 and 2: differences in
outcomes by attribution category
The two research questions tested in this study examined
possible concurrent and long-term differences in health
behaviors, control appraisals, and physical and psychologi-
cal health status as a function of attribution category gener-
ated at the beginning of CR. Because very few participants
created stress attributions, this category was dropped in
subsequent analyses. Table 3 provides results of mean com-
parisons on these different outcomes by whether partici-
pants endorsed a behavioral/controllable cause (yes/no)
and a biological/uncontrollable cause (yes/no). The top half
of Table 3 provides comparisons on outcomes at Time 1 by
attribution category, whereas the bottom half of the Table
provides comparisons on outcomes at Time 2.
Concurrently, independent sample t-tests showed that
participants who made a behavioral attribution at the
beginning of CR engaged in fewer healthy behaviors
(t(198)=-3.54, p<.001; d=.50), but had higher recovery
control (t(199)=2.95, p<.01; d=.42) and prevention
control appraisals (t(199)=3.52, p<.01; d=.50), than
their counterparts who did not make a behavioral attribu-
tion. Additionally, participants who made a biological
attribution at the beginning of CR engaged in more
healthy behaviors (t(198)=2.46, p<.05; d=.35) and
trended toward experiencing fewer anxiety symptoms
(t(192)=-1.92, p=.06; d=.28), but had lower prevention
control appraisals (t(199)=-2.65, p<.01; d=.38), than
their counterparts who did not make a biological
attribution.
The longitudinal comparisons in the lower half of Table
3 were done with analyses of covariance (ANCOVAs),
controlling for baseline levels of the outcomes. Results
showed that participants who made a behavioral attribu-
tion at Time 1 experienced more cardiac symptom experi-
ences at Time 2 than their counterparts who did not create
a behavioral attribution (F(2, 110)=30.90, p<.001;
2=.04). The reverse occurred for those who created a bio-
logical attribution: they experienced fewer cardiac symp-
toms than participants who did not create a biological
attribution (F(2, 110)=31.42, p<.001; 2=.05). Significant
differences were also found for symptoms of anxiety.
Participants who created a behavioral attribution at Time 1
experienced significantly more anxiety symptoms at Time
2 than participants who did not create a behavioral attribu-
tion (F(2, 106)=33.68, p<.001; 2=.12). The same pat-
tern as above emerged for participants who created
biological attributions: they reported significantly fewer
anxiety symptoms than participants who did not create a
biological attribution (F(2, 106)=28.02, p<.001; 2=.05).
Discussion
This study was conducted to examine whether (a) attribu-
tions generated by a sample of CR patients would align with
previous research showing that the most common causes of
CVD are behavioral, biological, and stress-related; (b) gen-
der differences exist in the creation of these attributions; and
(c) these attributions have effects on health appraisals and
outcomes. Consistent with Hypothesis 1, patients' explana-
tions fell into three main categories: biologically based ones

that were uncontrollable, behaviorally based ones that were
controllable, and stress-related causes. Biological and
behavioral attributions were created by almost equal propor-
tions of participants, whereas stress was mentioned by
fewer. Within the biological theme, the most commonly
mentioned attribution involved heredity, whereas within the
behavioral theme, the most commonly cited cause was poor
diet. These results suggest that controllable and uncontrol-
lable causes are equally salient to patients as they engage in
a causal search to understand their diagnoses. Our results
depart from past studies in the relatively low number of
patients who endorsed stress as a cause. It is possible this is
an artifact of our relatively affluent and educated sample, a
majority of which no longer worked outside the home. By
extension, it may be that these participants were subjected to
fewer stressors than participants in other studies who were
younger or lower in socioeconomic status (e.g. Cameron
et
al., 2005; Reges et
al., 2011). Given that these stress-
related findings differ from other studies, caution is war-
ranted in generalizing beyond this sample.
Based on prior studies, Hypothesis 2 predicted gender
differences in the types of attributions created: whereas
men were predicted to make more behavioral attributions
than women, women were predicted to generate more bio-
logical and stress attributions than men. Results did not
support this hypothesis, however, as no gender differences
emerged for behavioral or biological attributions (and too
few stress attributions were generated to test for gender dif-
ferences). Results imply that men and women are equally
likely to draw on controllable and uncontrollable causes
when creating meaning following a cardiac event. This may
reflect a change in gender norms surrounding the role of
behavior (i.e. exercise) in the promotion of physical health.
Whereas older generations of women may have avoided
physical exertion, women of all ages now endorse attitudes
that embrace the central role of physical activity in health
promotion (e.g. Ransford and Palisi, 1996; Rydwik etal.,
2012). Our results also likely reflect a more accurate view
of CVD risk factors by both men and women, recognizing
that biological and behavioral risk factors often co-occur
and interact to shape one's risk for CVD.
This study also sought to explore (through Research
Questions 1 and 2) whether attributions made at the begin-
ning of CR would differentiate between patients in their
self-reported health appraisals and outcomes concurrently,
and whether any longitudinal differences would be sus-
tained 21
months later. At the beginning of CR, results
showed that participants who created a behavioral attribu-
tion reported engaging in fewer health-promoting behav-
iors in the preceding month compared to those who did not
generate a behavioral attribution. The opposite was true for
those who created a biological attribution. Together, these
differences suggest that patients had insight into the ori-
gins of their disease. For example, people who cited "poor
diet" or "lack of exercise" as causes self-reported fewer of
those corresponding behaviors than participants who did
not generate behavioral attributions. Significant differ-
ences also emerged for appraisals of control over recovery
from CVD and control over prevention of recurrence.
Participants who generated a behavioral cause reported
significantly more perceived control over recovery and
prevention compared to participants who did not create a
behavioral attribution. Conversely, participants who gen-
erated a biological attribution felt significantly less per-
ceived control over prevention than those who did not
generate a biological attribution. Again, this pattern of
results suggests insight into the origins and course of treat-
ment for patients following a CVD event.
Although the cross-sectional results are encouraging on
account of participants' seemingly accurate views of the
origins and trajectories of CVD, the benefits associated
with making behavioral attributions seem to disappear lon-
gitudinally. Patients who created behavioral attributions at
baseline reported significantly more cardiac symptom
experiences 21months later compared to those who did not
create a behavioral attribution. The same difference can be
seen in symptoms of anxiety: patients who created a behav-
ioral attribution at baseline experienced significantly more
anxiety symptoms 21months later than those who did not
create a behavioral attribution. The direction is opposite for
those who created biological attributions at baseline: they
experienced significantly fewer cardiac and anxiety symp-
toms 21months later compared to participants who did not
generate biological attributions. This pattern suggests that
believing one's behavior caused CVD is associated with
psychological distress that can manifest as anxiety symp-
toms, or may translate to slower physical recovery opera-
tionalized as the experience of cardiac symptoms.
These findings are surprising, and depart from several
prominent attribution theorists. For example, Janoff-
Bulman (1979) suggests that behavioral self-blame attribu-
tions should aid psychological adjustment because behavior
is malleable. Character, on the other hand, is predicted to be
distressing because one's disposition is presumed to be
immutable. To the extent that heredity and biological fac-
tors are uncontrollable, Janoff-Bulman's ideas would sug-
gest behavioral attributions, but not biological attributions,
aid in recovery and adjustment. However, these results
strongly challenge the notion that creating a behavioral
attribution is adaptive through enhancements in control
appraisals; although differences in recovery and prevention
control were seen cross-sectionally, no differences remained
21months later. Rather, our findings imply that an attribu-
tion that absolves someone of control (e.g. heredity) can
have a positive impact, and that rehabilitation efforts should
use a forward orientation coupled with enhancements in
control over future behaviors (Bennett etal., 2013).
These findings may have implications for CR providers.
First, results suggest patients should not be encouraged to
ruminate about past behaviors in an attempt to identify one
8 Health Psychology Open 
or more that caused their cardiac event. In fact, avoiding a
behavioral attribution may protect patients from distress,
which in turn could negatively affect their motivation or
self-efficacy for sustained physical activity. Within the con-
text of CR, the creation of a behavioral attribution may cre-
ate anxiety about needing to change that behavior, which
could interfere with the confidence being formed through
continued participation in CR. Therefore, maintaining a
future orientation, with a focus on building confidence to
control future behaviors, seems warranted. Second, CR's
strong focus on building exercise capacity seems to affect
all patients regardless of the type of attribution created at
baseline. That is, there were no differences found by attri-
bution category in engagement in healthy behaviors. In
fact, paired sample t-tests among participants who com-
pleted questionnaires at both times showed that regardless
of whether behavioral or biological attributions were cre-
ated, they made significant improvements in healthy behav-
iors from Time 1 to Time 2 (ts ranged from -4.13 to -5.17).
Thus, as an intervention, CR seems quite effective in
increasing health promotion behaviors.
Limitations and future directions
These data are the first of which we are aware to link open-
ended cardiac attributions to self-rated health appraisals
and outcomes nearly 2
years after a cardiovascular event.
However, several study limitations are noteworthy. First,
results are based on an ethnically homogenous, relatively
affluent sample of CVD patients participating in a CR pro-
gram. Research shows that referral rates to CR are low
(approximately 56%; Brown etal., 2009), with rates of par-
ticipation in CR among eligible patients even lower
(approximately 19%; Suaya etal., 2007). Therefore, this
sample likely represents a motivated group of patients that
may differ from others not participating in CR. In order to
increase generalizability of findings, future research should
recruit a more heterogeneous sample of CVD patients,
including ones who are not enrolled in CR. Second, all data
in this study were self-reported; thus, they are subject to
shared method variance, social desirability, and other
response biases. Future research would benefit from clini-
cal assessments of distress, cross-informant ratings of
social-cognitive constructs, and observations of exercise-
related behaviors. Third, attrition occurred between the
assessments, resulting in a loss of approximately one-half
the sample at Time 2. Although attrition over time points is
normal, especially with follow-ups over many months (as
was the case in this study), some caution is warranted when
interpreting the longitudinal findings. Comparisons
revealed that the sample used for the longitudinal analyses
differed from the full sample in age, education, and risk
stratification. Therefore, future research should attempt to
reduce attrition at follow-up. Finally, these data cannot
speak to the stability of cardiac attributions made. Future
research should measure patient-generated attributions
over time to determine whether these causal searches yield
stable meanings about the origins of one's CVD.
Conclusion
This study examined types of causal attributions generated
by CR patients shortly after experiencing a cardiac event,
with results showing that biological and behavioral ones
were generated in equal proportions. Despite predictions,
no gender differences emerged. Thus, men and women
were equally likely to create biological (uncontrollable)
and behavioral (controllable) attributions for their cardiac
events. Linking attribution type to outcomes showed that
creating a behavioral attribution seemed to be beneficial in
the short-term for control appraisals, and that participants
displayed insight into the origins of their diagnoses by
making either behavioral or biological attributions.
However, over time, any benefit to making a behavioral
attribution disappeared, as it was associated with increased
anxiety symptoms 21months later. These findings suggest
that CR providers should discourage patients from looking
backward when creating meaning, but rather should encour-
age patients to maintain a future-focus that promotes per-
ceived control over health promotion behaviors.
