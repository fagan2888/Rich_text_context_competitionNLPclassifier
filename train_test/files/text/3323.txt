Introduction
It has been estimated that the under-five (U5) mortality rate
worldwide declined by 30% between 1990 and 2007 with
children's survival chances increasing in 95% of countries
(Overseas Development Institute, 2010; World Health
Organization [WHO], 2012). However, early childhood mor-
tality varies among world regions and over time, and the dif-
ferences are large and increasing. In the highly developed
economies, with advanced medical technologies, sufficient
diets, and adequate public sanitation, the U5 mortality rates
tend to be quite low (below 5 per 1,000). In contrast, within
the less developed countries, with the disadvantages of poor
diet, limited access to medical technology, and other prob-
lems of poverty and public sanitation, the rates tend to be as
high as over 100 per 1,000. Among major world regions, the
rate is highest in Africa and Asia, while the lowest rates are
in North America and Western and Northern European coun-
tries (Garry & Larkin, 1989; United Nations, 1998; United
Nations Development Programme [UNDP], 2005; WHO,
2010). In addition to this spatial pattern, the differences
between regional mortality figures are not only large but also
increasing over time (Cleland & Kaufmann, 1993). In 1990,
for instance, there were 180 per 1,000 live births in sub-
Saharan Africa and only 9 per 1,000 in the industrialized
countries--a 20-fold difference. In 2006, this gap had
increased to 31-fold with mortality rates of 186 and 6 per
1,000 children in sub-Saharan Africa and industrialized
countries, respectively (United Nations Children's Fund
[UNICEF], 2001, 2008).
Progress in child survival remains unacceptable in most
developing countries in sub-Saharan Africa where infant and
child mortality continues to be higher than in other develop-
ing countries of the world (Legrand & Mbacke, 1995;
Odubanjo & Olumide, 2007; Salau, Galpin, & Odimegwu,
2006). While sub-Saharan Africa constitutes about 10% of
the world population and 23% of the world's births, the
region accounts for more than 40% of the world infant and

The Prevalence and Determinants of
Under-Five Mortality in Benue State,
Nigeria

Abstract
This study examines the prevalence, and the socioeconomic and demographic determinants of under-five mortality in Benue
State, Nigeria. Using a purposive random sampling technique, a total of 1,500 questionnaires were administered to women
aged 15 to 49 years and who have ever given birth in 30 communities from 10 sampled local government areas in the state.
In addition, focus group discussions and key informant interviews formed sources of data for this research. The analysis
of data was carried out using descriptive statistics, child survival analysis, and probit regression model. The pattern of the
prevalence of infant and child mortality showed that there are three major child killers in the study area: malaria (38.2%),
complications at birth (29.5%), and measles (16.9%). The survival probability results show that children born to parents
living in an urban area have more chances (72.6%) of survival, as against 71.4% for children born to parents living in a rural
area. The probit regression analysis showed that the pregnancies ever had by the mothers has a greater marginal effect on
child survival (6.7%) than the current age of mothers at birth (3.7%) and the age of mother at marriage (0.9%). Based on the
findings, recommendations such as empowerment and education of mothers are suggested.

child mortality, 70% of the world's people with HIV/AIDS,
80% of AIDS deaths, and 90% of AIDS orphans (Annan,
2001; UNICEF, 2001; WHO, 2005). Of 20 countries in the
world identified as having high U5 mortality, 19 are in sub-
Saharan Africa. Similarly, of the world's 20 countries with
the highest risk of neonatal deaths, 15 are in Africa (World
Bank, 1987; WHO, 2008), and of about 60 countries that are
currently off the tract from achieving the Millennium
Development Goal­4 (MDG-4; the reduction of child mor-
tality by two thirds by 2015), 40 are African countries
(UNICEF, 2008).
Data from the Countdown to 2015, 2011 Report indi-
cated that of the 7.6 million U5 child deaths in 2010, 82%
of them occurred in sub-Saharan Africa and South East
Asia. In addition, 50% of the U5 deaths in that year occurred
in five countries: India, Nigeria, Democratic Republic of
the Congo, Pakistan, and China, with India (22%) and
Nigeria (11%) together accounting for a third of the total
number of U5 deaths worldwide (WHO/UNICEF, 2012).
The high risk for U5 deaths in Nigeria is further demon-
strated by the fact that in 2010, Nigeria's U5 deaths to total
live births ratio stood at 13.6% (annual number of births
and deaths of U5 in thousands were 6,332 and 861, respec-
tively, as in 2010) as against the global and Indian figures
of 5.6% and 6.2%, respectively. Indeed, Nigeria, which
accounts for about 2.3% of the global population, bore a
proportionally higher U5 death burden than even India,
which houses 17.9% of the world population (Nte, 2012).
Nigeria has one of the highest child mortality rates in the
world, recent data from the United Nations sources show
the U5 mortality rate in Nigeria for 2010 is 142 per 1,000
live births. Infant mortality rate is 88 per 1,000 live births,
and neonatal mortality rate, 40 per 1,000 live births, with a
concurrent increase in the number of live births. The low
rate of decline is a major cause for concern. With this cur-
rent rate, Nigeria is not on track in meeting UN MDG's
expected rate of 4.5% annual decline, to reach a target of 64
per 1,000 live births in 2015, which is a few months away.
These are aggregate values, but most importantly, infant
and child mortality rates in Nigeria vary spatially among
the geopolitical zones of the country and between rural and
urban residence. The values include Northeast (222 per
1,000 live births), which recorded the highest U5 mortality
rate; the Northwest (217 per 1,000 live births) ; and the
Southwest (89 per 1,000 live births), which has the lowest
rate among the geopolitical zones. U5 mortality was higher
in the rural areas with a rate of 191 per 1,000 live births as
against the 121 deaths per 1,000 live births in the urban
areas. One of the striking features of the mortality pattern
is the consistently high mortality rates in the northern part
of Nigeria (Aigbe & Zamu, 2012; National Population
Commission [NPC], 2009). Most of such studies on the
patterns and determinants of early childhood mortality in
Nigeria have been at aggregate levels geopolitical zones
while neglecting the critical influence of community-level
variables and small area variations (Salau et al., 2006). In
Nigeria, for instance, studies on mortality among children
were conducted in eastern and south western parts of the
country using secondary data, but the results were used to
make generalizations in respect of childhood mortality for
the nation as a whole. Such studies, among others, include
Lawoyin (2001); Antai, Ghilagaber, Wedren, Macassa, and
Moradi (2009); Folake, Abiodun, and Wilna (2008); Ogbe
(2008); Uthman (2008); Ojikutu (2008, 2010); and Mesike
and Mojekwu (2012). Such generalizations, according to
Premananda et al. (2004) and Overseas Development
Institute (2010), can be misleading as there is ample evi-
dence that infant and child mortality tends to follow con-
tours of social and economic progress across and within
communities in the country.
It becomes imperative, therefore, for researches on the
prevalence and determinants of early childhood mortality to
be conducted using community-level and small area varia-
tion data (Salau et al., 2006). Such research will help in the
design and implementation of policies and interventions to
lower disparities and achieve mortality decline nationwide. It
is on this premise that such a community-level study is
important in Benue State where dearth of studies on preva-
lence and determinants of U5 mortality exist.
Materials and Method
The Study Area
The study area, Benue State, lies between latitudes 6°30 and
8°10N of the Equator and between longitudes 7°50 and
10°E of the Greenwich Meridian. It is surrounded by six
states, namely, Nassarawa to the north, Taraba to the north-
east, Cross River and Ebonyi to the south, Enugu to the
southwest, and Kogi to the west. There is also a short inter-
national boundary between the state and the Republic of
Cameroun along Nigeria's southeast border. Benue State is
made up of 23 local government areas (LGAs); 14 and 9 of
these LGAs correspond with the ethnic territory of the Tiv
and Idoma people, respectively. Figure 1 shows the 23 LGAs
that make up the state.
With a population figure of more than four million inhab-
itants (4,253,641), the state is the ninth most populous state
in Nigeria. Made up of 2,144,043 males and 2,109,598
females, the state has a sex ratio of 1.02, a literacy rate of
44.7% among the population aged 6 years and above, and a
population density of about 130 persons per square kilometer
(Federal Republic of Nigeria, 2009; NPC, 2009). There are
three major ethnic groups inhabiting the state. The Tiv form
about two thirds of the population and are found in 14 of the
23 LGAs. The Idomas and the Igedes occupy the remaining
9 LGAs. Other ethnic groups include the Etulo, who are
mainly found in Katsina Ala and Buruku LGAs, the Afia in
Ado, the Nyifon in Buruku, and the Jukuns in Makurdi and
Guma LGAs.

Theoretical Framework
This study is based on the model of the factors of infant and
child mortality developed by Mosley and Chen (1984)
and modified by Casterline, Cooksey, and Ismail (1989) and
Bryman and Cramer (1990). This model assumes that death
is the final biological expression of a process that is deter-
mined basically by the economic, demographic, and social
structure of any area. These determinants of infant and child
mortality, which this study examined according to the model
categories by Mosley and Chen, are as follows: (a) the socio-
economic characteristics such as mother's education, occu-
pation, residence, resources of the household, income of the
mother, and medical care; (b) the intervening or housing con-
ditions or environmental variables such as source of water,
toilet facilities, and distance from home to the nearest health
facility; and (c) the demographic variables such as age of
mother at childbirth, birth order, previous birth interval,
breastfeeding, and sex of the child. This study therefore uses
the model by Mosley and Chen to appraise how these socio-
economic and demographic factors influence childhood mor-
tality in Benue State, Nigeria.
The Selection of Sample Population
In the selection of the sample population, the following steps
were adopted. First, Makurdi LGA, the LGA that houses the
seat of administration and power in the state, was purpo-
sively selected. Thereafter, using simple random sampling,
three LGAs were selected from each of the three geopolitical
zones in the state, thereby giving each of the LGAs in each of
the geopolitical zones in the state an equal opportunity of
being selected for the study. From the 10 LGAs so selected,
three communities were randomly selected for the study, giv-
ing a total of 30 communities. Finally, from each of the 30
communities selected for the study, 50 women aged 15 to 49
(the prime reproductive cohort of the population) who had
ever married and who had given birth at least once in the past
5 years preceding the survey, irrespective of place and out-
come of delivery, and who are residents (at least 1 year) of
such communities were, also, randomly selected, ensuring a
fair spread of the respondents across the communities. This
gave the study population of 1,500 respondents. Of the 10
study LGAs, 3 of them are better disposed in terms of health
facilities, educational institutions, government offices, daily
marketing, and transportation systems, and they are regarded
as urban LGAs, while the others are rural LGAs. The three
urban LGAs are Makurdi, Otukpo, and Katsina Ala. The
sampled LGAs and the list of the sampled communities for
the study are presented in Table 1.
Data Collection
The data for this study were generated using primary and
secondary sources. The primary source of data was through
questionnaire administration while the secondary sources
were books, journals, official documents, conferences, and
seminal papers. Copies of the questionnaire were adminis-
tered to the 1,500 women aged 15 to 49. The distribution and
retrieval rate of the questionnaire is shown in Table 2.

4 SAGE Open
Based on the sensitivity and peculiarities of the items in
the questionnaire and the need to give the respondents a
level of confidentiality during the interview, trained female
research assistants (known within the communities), com-
prising teachers in the primary schools and female health
workers within the communities, were used as research
assistants in data collection. The health officers were
assigned to supervise the data collection process in each of
the sampled LGAs and a coordinator oversees the process
in each of the senatorial districts. The need for the research
assistants to understand the local dialects of the communi-
ties was stressed as interpreters were not only likely to
increase the bill of data collection but also more likely to
cause the loss of vital information due to wrong interpreta-
tion and due to the respondents' unwillingness to release
vital personal information to a crowd. The issue of under-
standing the local dialects of the communities becomes
important as adjoining communities in the same LGA in the
state may not understand each other (a peculiarity of the
Middle Belt Region that houses about 75% of the ethnic
groups in Nigeria).
Data Analyses
Descriptive statistics as means, percentages, maps, and
charts were used to describe the incidence and pattern of
childhood mortality in the study area. In addition to these
statistical tools, the Child Survival Probability Model was
used to calculate the chances of child survival and dying.
These probabilities were calculated using the following
equations as outlined by Rajaratnam (2003):
Mean CEB CEB FP
= i i
/ , (1)
where CEB represents the number of children ever born by
women in group i, and FPi
is the female population in group i;
and
D CD CEB
i i i
= / , (2)
where Di
is the proportion dead among children ever born to
women in group i, and CDi
represents the total number of
children dead to women in group i.

In addition, the probit regression model was also used not
only to bring out the strength of each of the independent vari-
ables (regression coefficient) on the dependent variable
(infant and child mortality) but also to highlight the impact
on the dependent variable (marginal probability effect) of the
slightest change in any of the independent variables. The
probit regression model, though similar to the multiple
regression, has an advantage over the latter because of its
inbuilt mechanism to bring out the marginal probability
effect of each of the independent variables over the depen-
dent variable.

Results and Discussion
Age Differentials of Infant and Child Mortality
The results show that the age at which a child dies in the
study area varies from one LGA to the other (inter-LGA vari-
ation). The inter-LGA variations presented in Table 3 show
the proportionate contribution of each LGA to the overall
child death in the study area with Otukpo, Ado, and Katsina
Ala (in that order) leading the other LGAs in terms of perina-
tal deaths; Vandeikya, Otukpo, Agatu, and Ado recorded
higher statistics of neonatal mortality. The postneonatal mor-
tality figures are higher in such LGAs as Agatu, Otukpo, and
Gwer East while Makurdi, Guma, and Agatu recorded the
worst child death statistics in the study area. The explanation
for this observed pattern hinges on the availability and acces-
sibility as well as the readiness on the part of the caregivers
to patronize the facilities. Furthermore, the referral role
played by such LGAs as Makurdi, Otukpo, and Katsina Ala
in their respective zones may partly explain the observed pat-
tern as the process of death, which might have originated in
the rural LGAs and might have ended up in these urban
LGAs.
Pattern of Infant and Child Mortality by Causes
of Death
The chances of child survival depend, among others, on the
prevailing health challenges in the study area. The major
causes of child death in the study area include birth compli-
cations, malaria, diarrhea, measles, HIV/AIDS (through
mother to child transmission), tetanus, and tuberculosis. The
prevalence of these challenges varies not only across the
study area but also across the childhood ages as shown on
Table 4.

The prevalence of birth complications is outstanding in
such rural LGAs as Ado, Gwer East, Logo, and Vandeikya
and in the urban LGA of Katsina Ala. Lack of health care
services for mothers during pregnancy and birth or the low
utilization of such services even when available, poor
hygiene, and little understanding of newborn care are the
likely issues responsible for this challenge in the study area.
Malaria, an infectious disease transmitted by female mosqui-
toes, remains a major health problem in the study area as it
runs through the study area with Otukpo and Agatu LGAs
having the highest prevalence rate. The antimalarial initia-
tive of the government needs to be given more serious atten-
tion in the study area. Also, measles, usually spread by
contact with nasal or throat secretions of those infected, is
also present in all the LGAs with its effects more intense in
such LGAs as Guma, Tarka, and Agatu. Diarrhea is caused
by the presence of parasites in food and water. Children suc-
cumb to such parasites more quickly than adults because of
their weak responsive immune system. Diarrhea thrives in
conditions of poor diet, poor hygiene, and contaminated
water. This child killer is seen in all the LGAs with very seri-
ous cases noted in Ado, Guma, Vandeikya, Makurdi, and
Tarka LGAs. In the study area also, HIV/AIDS is usually
contacted by babies from their mothers during pregnancy,
birth, or breastfeeding, while some were exposed to contami-
nated needles or blood. Subsequently, Benue State has the
highest HIV/AIDS prevalence in the country, which stands at
12.5% and 13.3% in the urban and rural areas, respectively
(Federal Ministry of Health [FMOH], 2005). Among the
LGAs in the study area where the HIV/AIDS prevalence is
notable are Tarka, Otukpo, Vandeikya, Ado, and Agatu. The
prevalence of tuberculosis and tetanus in the study area,
compared with killer diseases in the study area, is minimal
because of the antenatal and child immunization services.
However, substantial cases of tuberculosis are noted in Logo,
Ado, Katsina Ala, and Gwer East, while tetanus featured
more in Ado, Otukpo, and Vandeikya LGAs.
Apart from the variation in the prevalence of these causes
of early childhood death across the study area, the age of the
child at death also varies with the causes of death because of
the age-specific nature of the causes. For instance, as shown
in Table 5, birth complications and pediatric HIV/AIDS are
prominent with the perinatal age; tetanus is noted at the neo-
natal and perinatal stages, while diarrhea, malaria, and

measles are challenges faced at the postneonatal and child
stages. On the whole, malaria, measles, complications at
birth, and diarrhea (in that order) are the leading causes of
U5 deaths in the study area. The knowledge of the pattern of
prevalence of these childhood health challenges in the study
area is of great importance to health policy formulators.
The impact of these death causes on the different LGAs in
the study area as reported by our respondents is shown in
Table 4. The influence of these causes varies among the
LGAs depending on the level of health infrastructural devel-
opment. The table shows greater infant deaths through birth
complications, HIV/AIDS (through mother­child transmis-
sion), and tetanus. However, the older children die more than
the infants through diarrhea, malaria, measles, and tubercu-
losis. Invariably, the infants are greater victims of these
causes of death (because of the lower immune system) than
the older children across the LGAs except in Guma and
Makurdi LGAs, with Guma LGA recording the sharpest dif-
ference between the two categories of childhood deaths
while the urban LGAs recorded lower childhood deaths than
the rural communities across the study area.
Pattern of Child Survival Probability Status in the
Study Area
From the discussions on the spatial patterns of infant and child
mortality in the study area, it is evident that the survival prob-
ability status of the child varies from one LGA to the other,
depending, among others, on the age dispensation of the child
and that of the mothers, the rural­urban residence status, the
prevalence of the causes of childhood death, and the availabil-
ity or otherwise of facilities to address the health challenges of
both the child and that of their mothers. The child survival
probability across the LGAs is shown in Table 6.
The table shows that Agatu, Makurdi, and Ado (in that
order) recorded the highest childbirths among the LGAs in
the study area. This may not be unconnected with the fact
that these three LGAs are part of the senatorial district noted
in the past for the highest HIV/AIDS prevalence not only in
the state but also nationwide. Furthermore, the prevalence of
malaria and measles among the three LGAs may also con-
tribute to their position in terms of child deaths among the
LGAs.
The probability of a child dying is highest inAdo, Otukpo,
and Agatu LGAs. These LGAs, by implication, experience
the lowest probability of child survival in the study area. Two
of the LGAs (Otukpo and Agatu), for instance, top all the
others in malaria prevalence. Makurdi LGA recorded the
highest probability of child survival among the LGAs of
study for obvious reasons of being the LGA that houses the
seat of state administration as well as the LGA with the best
network of health and other social amenities. On the whole,
the female child has a higher probability of survival than her
male counterpart. The results also show that a child born to
parents living in the urban LGAs, on the average, has a
higher survival probability (72.6%) than his or her counter-
parts whose parents reside in the rural LGAs (71.4%). This is
because of the preponderance of child survival programs in
the urban rather than in the rural LGAs. Quite a number of
child deaths in the urban LGAs were actually from the rural
LGAs in attempts by rural parents taking advantage of the
referral health facilities in the urban areas.
Probit Regression Analysis of the Determinants of
Infant and Child Mortality in the Study Area
In an attempt to bring out the list of the most influential
determinants of early childhood mortality, their strength and
marginal effect on the incidence of infant and child mortality
in the study area, all the independent variables (maternal
reproductive-related variables, socioeconomic, and the
health seeking behavior of the parents) were subjected to the
probit regression analysis. The result of the analysis, pre-
sented in Table 7, showed the list of independent variables

considered to be of greater relevance to the incidence of
child survival in the study area. This result has an adjusted R2
value of .433 implying that 43.3% of the variance in infant
and child mortality in the study area is explained by the
model. Among the maternal reproductive-related variables,
the age of the mothers, the age at marriage, and the number
of pregnancies ever had were considered more relevant by
the model than the other considerations within the group as
the other factors, more or less, depend on these three. The
level of education of the mothers, the paternal employment
status, the size of the households, the type of living houses,
and the locality of residence of parents featured so promi-
nently among the socioeconomic factors while the variables
from the health seeking behavior of the parents include visit
to the antenatal clinic, ownership of the facilities patronized
during pregnancy as antenatal clinic, the length of breast-
feeding by the mothers, and the immunization status of the
child. The values of the probit regression coefficients suggest
that infant immunization (.991), pregnancies ever had by the
mothers (.520), and their locality of residence (.332) are
more critical to predicting the incidence of infant and child
mortality in the study area than the other variables.
However, the marginal probability effect of the indepen-
dent variables on the incidence of early childhood mortality
is greater for such variables as living houses (46.9%) and
maternal educational groups (30.1%) than that for the other
variables. This implies that aggressive policies on housing
and female child education will go a long way to enhancing
the child survival status in the study area.
The regression results in Table 6 also shows that with ref-
erence to mothers aged 15 to 19, a unit increase in the age of
the mothers, all things being equal, results in a corresponding
decrease of the probability of a child dying by about 3.7%.
Conversely, a unit reduction in the age of the mothers, all
things being equal, amounts to a corresponding reduction of
the probability of a child surviving by the same percentage.

The negative implication of teenage pregnancy and child-
birth is thus so highlighted. The number of pregnancies ever
had by a mother is a factor of child survival as every addi-
tional pregnancy increases the child's nonsurvival probabil-
ity by about 6.9%. This has to do with the continual weakness
of the womb of the mother with increasing number of
pregnancies.
The importance of maternal education to the survival of
the child is also demonstrated by the table. With reference to
illiterate mothers, a unit of additional educational attainment
of nursery, all things being equal, yields a 12.7% decrease in
the probability of a child dying. Similarly, an attainment of
senior secondary school or teacher training college (SSS/
TTC) from junior secondary school (JSS) yields an even
greater decrease by 14.7% of the probability of a child dying.
The occupation of the father, rather than that of the mother,
is considered significant by the model. The likely explana-
tion for this scenario in the study area is the unwillingness of
mothers to spend on the child without resorting to the hus-
bands. Babies born to employed fathers experienced an
enhanced survival of 4.08% over their counterparts born to
the unemployed fathers.
The locality of residence of the parents showed that the
incidence of infant and child mortality is 6.3% higher in
the rural communities than in the urban LGAs. In terms of
the health seeking behavior of the parents, particularly that
of the mothers, the importance of antenatal visit and its fre-
quency during the gestational period is obvious. The inverse
relationship between such visits and the survival of the preg-
nancy outcome indicates that the more consistent and regular
are the visits to the clinic for check-up during pregnancy, the
better the likelihood of a healthy outcome. The consistent
and regular visits to the antenatal clinics by the pregnant
mothers reduce the probability of child dying by 10%. The
ownership of such antenatal clinics is considered to be of
relevance to a successful pregnancy outcome. With reference
to the government-owned clinics, the mothers who made use
of private clinics, mission hospitals, and "other" health cen-
ters recorded, respectively, higher probabilities of 8.6%,
9.6%, and 4.9% of child dying than the probability recorded
by mothers who attended government clinics. The quality of
services rendered by the government-owned facilities is
much better than that provided by these profit- (or
philanthropic)-oriented clinics in the study area.
The protection offered the child by immunization is also
acknowledged by the model as children who received no
immunization compared with those who received full dosage
of immunization have 21.9% higher probability of dying.
The importance of breastfeeding as the most nutritious diet
of the baby during the formative age is stressed by the model.
Babies who are fed with breast milk exclusively for the first
6 months of life and extended to a period of 18 months and
above are likely to thrive more than those put on breast milk
for a period shorter than 6 months for whatever reasons
advanced by the mothers. Such babies in the latter category
experience 2.4% higher probability of dying compared with
counterparts who are on breast milk for more than a year and
half.
Summary of Findings and
Recommendation
The incidence of early childhood mortality in the study area
showed variations from one LGAto another. The proportional
contribution of the U5 deaths among the LGAs indicated that
the LGAs in the Benue South senatorial district are worse off
than the cases in Benue North and Benue Central senatorial
districts. The pattern of the prevalence of the causes of infant
and child mortality showed that there are three major child
killers in the study area: malaria (38.2%), complications at
birth (29.5%), and measles (16.9%). A focus on these three
health challenges that account for over three quarters of early
childhood deaths in the study area should be the parental cry
of the moment in the state. The survival probability results
show that children born to parents living in an urban area
have more chances of survival, 72.6% as against 71.4% for
children born to parents living in a rural area. Furthermore,
the probit regression analysis of these maternal variables
showed that the pregnancies ever had by the mothers has a
greater marginal effect on child survival (6.7%) than the cur-
rent age of mothers at birth (3.7%) and the age of mother at
marriage (0.9%). In the light of the findings of the study, it is
recommended that measures should be taken to promote the
fulfillment of girls' and mothers' potentials not only through
education but also through skills development and the eradi-
cation of illiteracy for all girls and women without discrimi-
nation of any kind. Mothers should also be educated on the
need to engage in exclusive breastfeeding of their babies to
help make the immune systems of these babies stronger.
Governments and parents should also ensure that the children
receive full and appropriate immunization for child killer dis-
eases. Finally, the parents should be educated on the need to
stop marrying of their daughters at very young ages as such
young women may be susceptible to delivery complications
that can adversely affect health of the child.
