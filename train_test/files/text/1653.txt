Objectives: To analyze the trend of dextrometh-
orphan abuse in California and to compare these find-
ings with national trends.
Design: A 6-year retrospective review.
Setting: California Poison Control System (CPCS),
American Association of Poison Control Centers
(AAPCC), and Drug Abuse Warning Network (DAWN)
databases from January 1, 1999, to December 31, 2004.
Participants: All dextromethorphan abuse cases re-
ported to the CPCS, AAPCC, and DAWN. The main ex-
posures of dextromethorphan abuse cases included date
of exposure, age, acute vs long-term use, coingestants,
product formulation, and clinical outcome.
Main Outcome Measure: The annual proportion of
dextromethorphan abuse cases among all exposures re-
ported to the CPCS, AAPCC, and DAWN databases.
Results: A total of 1382 CPCS cases were included in
the study. A 10-fold increase in CPCS dextrometh-
orphan abuse cases from 1999 (0.23 cases per 1000 calls)
to 2004 (2.15 cases per 1000 calls) (odds ratio, 1.48; 95%
confidence interval, 1.43-1.54) was identified. Of all CPCS
dextromethorphan abuse cases, 74.5% were aged 9 to 17
years; the frequency of cases among this age group in-
creased more than 15-fold during the study (from 0.11
to 1.68 cases per 1000 calls). Similar trends were seen
in the AAPCC and DAWN databases. The highest fre-
quency of dextromethorphan abuse occurred among ado-
lescents aged 15 and 16 years. The most commonly abused
product was Coricidin HBP Cough & Cold Tablets.
Conclusions: Our study revealed an increasing trend of
dextromethorphan abuse cases reported to the CPCS that
is paralleled nationally as reported to the AAPCC and
DAWN. This increase was most evident in the adoles-
cent population.

DEXTROMETHORPHAN HAS
been used safely for years
as a cough suppressant
and is available in many
over-the-counter (OTC)
cough and cold preparations. Whereas
therapeutic doses of dextromethorphan act
at the sigma receptor to produce its anti-
tussive effects, high doses are metabolized
todextrorphan,anactivemetabolitethatan-
tagonizesN-methyl-D-aspartatereceptors.1
Becauseofitssimilarpharmacologytophen-
cyclidine and ketamine, dextrorphan and,
to a lesser degree, dextromethorphan may
produce dissociative hallucinations at high
doses.2,3 In addition, tachycardia, hyperten-
sion, agitation, ataxia, and psychosis also
havebeenreportedfollowinghigh-dosedex-
tromethorphan.4-7
Dextromethorphan abuse was recog-
nized as early as the 1960s when it was
marketed as the sole active ingredient in
Romilar, an OTC product that was vol-
untarily removed from the market be-
cause of abuse.8 Since the late 1990s, ado-
lescents have been increasingly abusing
OTC dextromethorphan products be-
cause of their easy accessibility and false
perception of safety. Several states, such
as California, North Dakota, Texas, and
New York, have even proposed legisla-
tion to control the sale of dextrometh-
orphan-containing products to minors.
There are numerous slang names for dex-
tromethorphan, such as CCC, Triple C,
DXM, Dex, Poor Man's PCP, Skittles, and
Robo.9 Many of these slang terms refer to
particular brand name products contain-
ing dextromethorphan. Two previously re-
ported studies, one in California6 and an-
other in Texas,10 identified Coricidin
products (Schering-Plough HealthCare
Products Inc, Kenilworth, NJ) as agents of
abuse with a high prevalence in the ado-

lescent population. The Texas Poison Center study iden-
tified a possible increasing trend of Coricidin abuse from
1998 to 1999.
The goals of this retrospective review were to ana-
lyze the trend of dextromethorphan abuse in California
and to compare the findings with national trends. We also
hoped to gain insight into the particular products in-
volved and the most common age groups abusing dex-
tromethorphan, and the effect on health care facilities.
Evaluating patterns of dextromethorphan abuse may help
health care practitioners target interventions, such as pre-
vention and treatment.
METHODS
We conducted a retrospective case record review analyzing all
suspected dextromethorphan abuse cases reported to the Cali-
fornia Poison Control System (CPCS) from January 1, 1999,
through December 31, 2004. The CPCS is a 24-hour emer-
gency telephone consultation service that offers treatment ad-
vice to the public and health care professionals regarding poi-
sonings and overdoses. The CPCS database consists of case
records documenting all consultations. All data in the case rec-
ords are collected by the CPCS staff in accordance with Ameri-
can Association of Poison Control Centers (AAPCC) guide-
lines.11 This study was approved by the Committee on Human
Research, University of California, San Francisco. Subject con-
sent was not required because the study involved a retrospec-
tive review of case records, in which all patient identifiers were
removed before evaluation.
Case records were identified for evaluation by electroni-
cally searching the CPCS database for all cases coded as abuse
and containing any of the AAPCC dextromethorphan-
containing generic or product codes. Cases were excluded if
they involved any of the following: (1) drug information, (2)
unintentional misuse, (3) duplicate cases, (4) product mis-
coded as dextromethorphan abuse, and (5) symptoms unre-
lated to dextromethorphan ingestion. Cases were reviewed by
1 of 4 data reviewers (J.K.B., U.K.W., J.W.H., or M.B.), with
183 (13.2%) of the 1382 cases undergoing a second review to
ensure consistency. All major outcome cases underwent a sec-
ond review. Data collected included age, sex, caller site, dis-
position, product ingested, dose form, coingestants, clinical
symptoms, short- vs long-term use, ethanol level, and acetamin-
ophen level. Outcomes were coded according to the AAPCC
definitions.11 Examples of each category include the follow-
ing: (1) no effect; (2) minor effect (self-limiting minimal symp-
toms that generally resolve rapidly, including drowsiness, gas-
trointestinal symptoms, and/or sinus tachycardia); (3) moderate
effect (more pronounced, prolonged, or systemic symptoms that
are not life threatening, including agitation, disorientation, hal-
lucinations, brief hypotension, and/or a single brief seizure);
and (4) major effect (life-threatening symptoms or symptoms
that resulted in significant residual disability, including car-
diovascular and respiratory compromise and/or prolonged or
multiple seizures).
The primary outcome measured was the proportion of dex-
tromethorphan abuse cases among all cases reported to the CPCS
yearly from 1999 to 2004. Secondary outcomes analyzed in-
cluded the proportion of dextromethorphan abuse cases in pa-
tients aged 9 to 17 years, the proportion of users classified as
long-term abusers, the proportion of solid vs other dose forms,
the frequency of individual product exposures, and the fre-
quency of clinical outcomes (classified as no effect, minor, mod-
erate, or major). Changes in primary and secondary outcomes
over the study years were analyzed using logistic regression. A
multivariate logistic regression model was constructed to de-
termine the effect of age, sex, year, presence of coingestants,
and product on clinical outcome.
Data were analyzed from 2 additional sources reporting na-
tionwide drug abuse. The first was composed of dextrometh-
orphan abuse cases reported to the AAPCC from January 1, 1999,
through December 31, 2004. The AAPCC data were derived
from a written report generated from the Toxic Exposure Sur-
veillance System involving human exposures to dextrometh-
orphan reported as intentional abuse to US Poison Control Cen-
ters from 1999 to 2004 (AAPCC, Washington, DC, Report 27,
unpublished data, December 16, 2005).11 The second was com-
posed of dextromethorphan abuse cases reported to the Sub-
stance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration pro-
gram, Drug Abuse Warning Network (DAWN), from January
1, 1999, through December 31, 2002.12 Dextromethorphan-
related exposures reported to DAWN are not currently avail-
able after 2002. The following data from CPCS were com-
pared with data from the DAWN and AAPCC databases: (1)
age distribution (for AAPCC only, not available through DAWN)
and (2) total number of dextromethorphan abuse cases re-
ported annually. Only the AAPCC cases for which the exact
age was known and the age was at least 9 years were included
in the analysis. The AAPCC and DAWN databases were ana-
lyzed for temporal trends in dextromethorphan reporting by
logistic regression, and the proportion of dextromethorphan
cases reported in adolescents was investigated in the AAPCC
database. The general approach we used in this study of com-
bining detailed analysis of CPCS data juxtaposed with general
surveillance data from other sources parallels the methods pre-
viously used to study -hydroxybutyrate, another drug of
abuse.13
RESULTS
During the 6-year study period, the CPCS had 1411 re-
ports coded as dextromethorphan abuse and all under-
went manual case record review. Ultimately, 1382 dex-
tromethorphan abuse cases were included in the final
analysis. On review, 29 cases were excluded because of
the following reasons: drug information cases (n=10), du-
plicate cases (n=2), product reported did not contain dex-
tromethorphan (n=1), misclassified as abuse (n=14), and
reported symptoms were unrelated to dextrometh-
orphan ingestion (n=2). During the study, the CPCS re-
ceived 1 336 475 human exposure calls.
From 1999 through 2004, the frequency of all dex-
tromethorphan abuse cases reported to the CPCS in-
creased 10-fold (Table). The average effect was an al-
most 50% increase in the frequency of reported cases each
year compared with the previous year (odds ratio, 1.48;
95% confidence interval, 1.43-1.54). This increase in the
number of dextromethorphan abuse cases (Figure 1)
and the proportion of dextromethorphan cases among
all exposures reported (Figure 2) was also seen in the
data collected by the AAPCC (odds ratio, 1.31; 95% con-
fidence interval, 1.29-1.33) and DAWN (through 2002)
(odds ratio, 1.15; 95% confidence interval, 1.13-1.18).
The CPCS dextromethorphan abuse reports are in-
cluded in the cases reported to the AAPCC, but these alone
would not account for the national AAPCC trend.
The overall increase in the frequency of dextrometh-
orphan abuse cases was paralleled by an increase in the
frequency of dextromethorphan abuse cases reported in

adolescents (defined as those aged 9-17 years). During
the 6-year study period, 74.5% of all reported CPCS dex-
tromethorphan abuse cases involved adolescents. The
overall median age was 16 years. The proportion of all
dextromethorphan abuse cases that occurred in adoles-
cents increased over the duration of the study according
to the CPCS (odds ratio, 1.25; 95% confidence interval,
1.15-1.36) and AAPCC (odds ratio, 1.03; 95% confi-
dence interval, 1.01-1.05) databases. The largest propor-
tional increase in adolescent abuse was seen from 1999
to 2000 (Table). The highest frequency of dextrometh-
orphan abuse in the CPCS and AAPCC databases was
among adolescents aged 15 and 16 years (Figure 3). The
younger adolescent age distribution is further under-
scored by the observation that in CPCS reporting the com-
bined frequency among 12- to 13-year-old subjects ex-
ceeded that of 18-year-old subjects.
Of the 1382 cases of dextromethorphan abuse in-
cluded in our study, the most commonly abused prod-
uct was Coricidin HBP Cough & Cold Tablets. This was
followed by dextromethorphan-containing Robitussin
products (Wyeth, Madison, NJ) (Table). The propor-
tion of abused dextromethorphan products represented
by Coricidin HBP Cough & Cold Tablets increased over
the study period (odds ratio, 1.23; 95% confidence in-
terval, 1.13-1.26). This increasing trend in abuse of Cori-
cidin HBP Cough & Cold Tablets corresponded to an in-
crease in the number of exposures that involved a solid
dose form of dextromethorphan (odds ratio, 1.43; 95%
confidence interval, 1.31-1.56). In contrast to the in-
crease in acute cases of dextromethorphan abuse, long-
term abuse reports to the CPCS were uncommon (n=32)
and declined over the study period (odds ratio, 0.51; 95%
confidence interval, 0.40-0.64).
Most dextromethorphan cases resulted in minor (636
cases [46.0%]) or moderate (578 cases [41.8%]) out-
comes. Seven cases (0.5%) had major outcomes. For the
remaining cases, either no symptoms were reported (94
cases [6.8%]) or the outcome was unknown (67 cases
[4.8%]) (Table). There were no fatalities reported. All 7
major outcome cases involved serious pulmonary com-
plications, such as respiratory depression or aspiration
requiring intubation. Five of the major outcome cases in-
volved coingestants, 3 of which involved ethanol. Among

the major outcome cases, only 2 involved minors. There
was an increase in combined moderate and major out-
comes during the study (odds ratio, 1.09; 95% confi-
dence interval, 1.01-1.17). A multivariate model incor-
porating study year, age, sex, presence of coingestants,
and exposure to Coricidin HBP Cough & Cold Tablets
showed an increased incidence of moderate and major
outcomes among patients in later years (odds ratio, 1.09;
95% confidence interval, 1.01-1.18) and among male ado-
lescents (odds ratio, 1.22; 95% confidence interval, 1.09-
1.37).
Polysubstance use was reported by history in 278
(20.1%) of all subjects. The most common agents re-
ported were ethanol (n=93), marijuana (n=40), opiates
(n=23), acetaminophen (n=17), amphetamines (n=14),
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (n=10), pseudo-
ephedrine (n=10), and benzodiazepines (n=9). Self-
reported ethanol coingestion was documented among 93
(6.7%) subjects; however, only 23 cases had laboratory
confirmation. Three cases were coded as having major
outcomes (levels ranged from 230-373 mg/dL), and 11
were coded as having moderate outcomes. Only 17 pa-
tients reported ingesting acetaminophen by history; how-
ever, there were 26 patients with confirmed laboratory
acetaminophen levels (range, 9.1-111.0 µg/mL). More im-
portant, 8 patients had a delayed presentation to the hos-
pital (range, 8 hours­4 days), and in 4 additional pa-
tients the time of ingestion was unknown. Sixteen patients
received N-acetylcysteine therapy, of whom 7 experi-
enced elevated transaminase levels. Of these 7 patients,
1 was a long-term alcohol user. Of the 26 subjects with
acetaminophen involvement, 14 were coded as having a
moderate outcome and 0 were coded as having a major
outcome. There was no significant difference in the oc-
currence of the combined major and moderate out-
comes between patients who did or did not have any
coingestant (odds ratio, 0.96; 95% confidence interval,
0.83-1.14).
The most common adverse effects reported were tachy-
cardia (n=593), lethargy (n=481), hypertension (n=289),
confusion or altered mental status (n=277), mydriasis
(n=251), agitation (n=171), gastrointestinal effects
(n=159), dizziness (n=94), ataxia (n=83), hallucina-
tions (n=80), slurred speech (n=77), nystagmus (n=75),
fever (n=54), loss of consciousness (n=26), tachypnea
(n=20), seizure (n=12), and hypotension (n=12).
COMMENT
Our study reveals a 10-fold increase in all dextrometh-
orphan abuse cases reported to the CPCS from 1999
through 2004. This increasing trend of dextrometh-
orphan abuse is consistent with the national trend docu-
mented by the AAPCC, whose data revealed a 7-fold in-
crease during the same time frame. In addition, DAWN
also reported an overall increase in dextromethorphan
abuse from 1999 to 2002, although the increase was not
as pronounced. The highest frequency of abuse was in

adolescents aged 15 and 16 years, as reported to the CPCS
and the AAPCC. Abuse of solid dose forms increased more
dramatically during the study, compared with the liq-
uid formulations. According to CPCS reports, Coricidin
HBP Cough & Cold Tablets was the most commonly re-
ported dextromethorphan-containing product abused, fol-
lowed by dextromethorphan-containing Robitussin for-
mulations (Table). There may be multiple explanations
for the apparent preference of Coricidin HBP Cough &
Cold Tablets abuse, including widespread OTC avail-
ability, high dextromethorphan content, palatability of
the tablet formulation, and, most important, its fre-
quent promotion as a product of abuse on many Inter-
net Web sites. An increase in combined moderate and
major outcomes was also identified during the study. The
explanation for this trend is likely multifactorial; how-
ever, it may be because of the increased abuse of Cori-
cidin HBP Cough & Cold Tablets and the contribution
of chlorpheniramine in the formulation following high
doses. However, a detailed examination of the actual cause
of this particular trend is beyond the scope of this study.
The increasing trend of teenage dextromethorphan
abuse is multifactorial. Dextromethorphan is available in
multiple OTC cough and cold products legally sold at
pharmacies and most grocery stores. As little as 1 pack-
age may contain enough dextromethorphan to produce
euphoric and hallucinatory effects.14 Adolescents are in-
creasingly abusing OTC medications because they are eas-
ily available and relatively inexpensive, and many have
a false perception that even high doses of dextrometh-
orphan are not dangerous. In contrast, other drugs of
abuse, such as -hydroxybutyrate, methylenedioxymeth-
amphetamine (Ecstasy), and lysergic acid diethylamide,
which are not as easily accessible to minors, have shown
an annual decline in use among adolescents and all age
groups over the past few years.13,15 Considering ease of
availability as a reason for teenage abuse, it is not sur-
prising that abuse of a readily available OTC medication
like dextromethorphan, with its euphoric effects, is in-
creasing. Another factor is that it is easy to fool parents
because these OTC products are commonly kept in the
household. Because dextromethorphan is an OTC medi-
cation, it lacks the stigma of a drug of abuse and there
are numerous Web sites promoting dextromethorphan
abuse and even providing instructions on how to abuse
and manufacture the drug.16,17 More and more children
younger than 18 years have unsupervised access to the
World Wide Web, including dextromethorphan abuse
Web sites. The peer pressure that commonly plagues ado-
lescents could certainly play an important role in the in-
creasing abuse.
Another serious concern with taking large amounts
of OTC cough and cold products for the dextrometh-
orphan content involves toxicity from the hidden ingre-
dients, such as pseudoephedrine, acetaminophen, and an-
tihistamines. For example, high doses of acetaminophen
may result in delayed liver failure.18 Typically, the in-
toxication from the dextromethorphan resolves within
6 to 8 hours; however, acetaminophen may not even start
to show signs of toxicity for 10 hours and, even then, the
first signs may be gastrointestinal upset only. Unless these
patients seek medical care, acetaminophen-induced hepa-
totoxicity may ensue. Our study revealed that of the 26
patients who had elevated serum acetaminophen levels,
only 17 reported acetaminophen use by history. It is highly
likely that some of these patients were unaware of their
acetaminophen exposure because it is a common "hid-
den" ingredient in many OTC cough and cold products.
Sixteen patients received the antidote, N-acetylcysteine,
and 7 had elevated transaminase levels.
The major limitation of our study was the retrospec-
tive design, primarily because of incomplete documen-
tation of clinical data on some of the poison center charts.
Because the poison center reporting is a passive report-
ing system, calls to the poison center regarding drugs of
abuse are usually secondary to an adverse reaction. To
our knowledge, there is no study that correlates the true
incidence of abuse in the general population to the in-
cidence of poison center reports. Therefore, dextrometh-
orphan abuse may be far higher than the cases reported
in our study. Another limitation of our study is that labo-
ratory testing of dextromethorphan is not routinely avail-
able at hospital laboratories. Consequently, our pa-
tients' dextromethorphan exposure was based on history
rather than urine or blood test confirmation. In addi-
tion, dextromethorphan may trigger a false positive on
the phencyclidine laboratory drug screen, resulting in
some patients being falsely diagnosed as having phen-
cyclidine intoxication when in actuality dextrometh-
orphan was the agent responsible for the intoxication,
further lowering the dextromethorphan incidence re-
ported.6 Moreover, dextromethorphan abuse is likely un-
derreported to DAWN for 2 reasons. First, dextrometh-
orphan was not a drug that was specifically listed on the
DAWN data collection form during the early years of this
study, but rather would only be documented in the "other"
category. Second, dextromethorphan is a hidden ingre-
dient in OTC cough and cold preparations and, there-
fore, may have been missed by the DAWN hospital medi-
cal record evaluator during the medical record review
process. Last, another limitation of our study is our in-
ability to attribute case-specific symptoms to dextrometh-
orphan as opposed to other ingredients found in com-
bination products. For example, in some cases,
tachycardia, a common finding, could have been due, at
least in part, to the antihistamine (eg, chlorpheni-
ramine) or the decongestant (eg, pseudoephedrine) com-
ponents in the OTC cough and cold products.
In conclusion, this study showed an increasing trend
of dextromethorphan abuse over a 6-year period, par-
ticularly in adolescents younger than 18 years. The data
from the CPCS showed a 10-fold increase in dextro-
methorphan abuse in all ages and a 15-fold increase in
adolescents from 1999 through 2004. This increase in
dextromethorphan abuse in adolescents is most likely due
to the hallucinogenic effects of these easily accessible in-
expensive OTC products and the false perception that
high-dose dextromethorphan is safe. It is important for
health care practitioners, manufacturers, and retail es-
tablishments selling dextromethorphan-containing prod-
ucts to be aware of increasing dextromethorphan abuse
to educate and hopefully prevent dextromethorphan abuse
and the ensuing toxicity from occurring. Preventive mea-
