ABSTRACT
Distal symmetrical sensory neuropathy in diabetes involves
the dying back of axons, and the pathology equates with
axonal dystrophy generated under conditions of aberrant
Ca2+ signalling. Previous work has described abnormalities
in Ca2+ homoeostasis in sensory and dorsal horn neurons
acutely isolated from diabetic rodents. We extended this
work by testing the hypothesis that sensory neurons exposed
to long-term Type 1 diabetes in vivo would exhibit abnormal
axonal Ca2+ homoeostasis and focused on the role of SERCA
(sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase). DRG
(dorsal root ganglia) sensory neurons from age-matched
normal and 3­5-month-old STZ (streptozotocin)-diabetic
rats (an experimental model of Type 1 diabetes) were cul-
tured. At 1­2 days in vitro an array of parameters were
measured to investigate Ca2+ homoeostasis including (i)
axonal levels of intracellular Ca2+, (ii) Ca2+ uptake by the ER
(endoplasmic reticulum), (iii) assessment of Ca2+ signalling
following a long-term thapsigargin-induced blockade of
SERCA and (iv) determination of expression of ER mass and
stress markers using immunocytochemistry and Western
blotting. KCl- and caffeine-induced Ca2+ transients in axons
were 2-fold lower in cultures of diabetic neurons compared
with normal neurons indicative of reduced ER calcium
loading. The rate of uptake of Ca2+ into the ER was reduced
by 2-fold (P,0.05) in diabetic neurons, while markers for ER
mass and ER stress were unchanged. Abnormalities in Ca2+
homoeostasis in diabetic neurons could be mimicked via
long-term inhibition of SERCA in normal neurons. In
summary, axons of neurons from diabetic rats exhibited
aberrant Ca2+ homoeostasis possibly triggered by sub-
optimal SERCA activity that could contribute to the distal
axonopathy observed in diabetes.
Key words: axon plasticity, diabetic neuropathy, dorsal root
ganglia (DRG), neurodegeneration, sarco/endoplasmic
reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA).
INTRODUCTION
Intracellular Ca2+ homoeostasis is, in part, regulated through
activity of ER (endoplasmic reticulum) Ca2+ channels and Ca2+
binding proteins (Petersen et al., 2001; Verkhratsky and
Petersen, 2002; Verkhratsky, 2005). Dynamic changes in free
Ca2+ concentration within the ER and alterations in ER Ca2+
homoeostasis are critical regulators of cell function and survi-
val (Mattson et al., 2001; Paschen and Frandsen, 2001; Glazner
and Fernyhough, 2002, 2008; Verkhratsky and Petersen, 2002).
The ER acts as a dynamic Ca2+ buffer as well as a primary store
for intracellular Ca2+ signals, and ER Ca2+ release regulates
neurotransmitter and hormone secretion, mitochondrial func-
tion, synaptic plasticity, expression of multiple genes and
conveys Ca2+ signals from the cell periphery towards the
nucleus (Verkhratsky and Toescu, 1998; Llano et al., 2000;
Hardingham et al., 2001; Rose and Konnerth, 2001; Verkhratsky

and Petersen, 2002; Verkhratsky, 2005). The ER Ca2+ homoeo-
stasis and Ca2+ release are regulated by Ca2+ levels in the ER
lumen (Burdakov et al., 2005), and therefore intra-ER Ca2+
levels represent a critical regulatory pathway for both
cytoplasmic Ca2+ homoeostasis and mitochondrial function.
The handling of free Ca2+ within the cytosol and ER lumen is
fundamentally different. Free [Ca2+] in the ER lumen ([Ca2+]ER
is ER calcium concentration) is three to four orders of
magnitude greater than the cytosolic Ca2+ concentration
([Ca2+]i
is intracellular calcium concentration). This results in a
steep concentration gradient and constant leakage of Ca2+
ions from the ER into the cytoplasm, which is counteracted by
ER Ca2+ uptake driven by SERCA (sarco/endoplasmic reticulum
calcium ATPase) pumps on the ER membrane. The ability of the
ER to release Ca2+ in response to physiological stimulation is
determined by three major types of channels: RyR (ryano-
dine receptor) and InsP3
R (inositol triphosphate receptor) and
receptors activated by NAADP (nicotinic acid­adenine dinu-
cleotide phosphate) (Sitsapesan et al., 1995; Sutko and Airey,
1996; Patel et al., 2001; Thrower et al., 2001). Optimal [Ca2+]i
is
maintained at ,100 nM by plasma membrane Ca2+-ATPases
and the SERCA pumps of the ER. Inhibition of ER Ca2+ uptake
by blockade of SERCA or excessive Ca2+ release from ER by
activation of ER-resident Ca2+ channels would alter this
balance of Ca2+ such that [Ca2+]ER
would decrease and [Ca2+]i
would be elevated. Under high [Ca2+]i
the mitochondrion will
increase Ca2+ uptake, leading to elevated [Ca2+]m
eventually
resulting in organelle dysfunction. Depletion of [Ca2+]ER
is toxic
to cells (Paschen and Frandsen, 2001; Patil and Walter, 2001)
and may be more pathogenic even than elevated [Ca2+]i
(Verkhratsky, 2005).
Diabetic sensory neuropathy in humans is associated with
structural changes in peripheral nerves, including segmental
degeneration, microangiopathy, paranodal demyelination and
loss of myelinated and unmyelinated fibres ­ the latter due to a
dying-back of distal axons and characterized as reduced IENF
(intra-epidermal nerve fibres) (Kennedy et al., 1996; Yagihashi,
1996; Malik et al., 2005; Quattrini et al., 2007; Ebenezer et al.,
2011). Animal models of diabetic neuropathy reveal similar
pathology and, in common with humans, exhibit sensory
hypoalgesia and tactile allodynia (Christianson et al., 2003,
2007; Mizisin et al., 2007; Beiswenger et al., 2008; Jolivalt
et al., 2008; Francis et al., 2009). The degenerative distal
axonopathy observed in diabetes is also seen in cultured
neurons isolated from diabetic rats (Zherebitskaya et al., 2009;
Akude et al., 2010). We and others have demonstrated that
experimental diabetes induces significant changes in Ca2+
homoeostasis in DRG (dorsal root ganglia) sensory neurons
(Hall et al., 1995, 2001; Kostyuk et al., 1995, 2001; Voitenko
et al., 1999, 2000; Huang et al., 2002, 2003; Kruglikov et al.,
2004). This includes a steady-state increase in [Ca2+]i
, increased
high threshold Ca2+ currents and a decrease in the amplitude
of depolarization-induced [Ca2+]i
signals. Most importantly,
diabetes also leads to a significant decrease of caffeine-
induced Ca2+ release from intracellular stores (Kostyuk et al.,
2001; Huang et al., 2002; Kruglikov et al., 2004), suggesting
altered ER Ca2+ homoeostasis. Therapy with low-dose insulin or
NT-3 (neurotrophin-3) restored resting Ca2+ levels and
depolarization- and caffeine-induced Ca2+ transients (Huang
et al., 2002, 2003). Thus neurotrophic factor treatments which
reverse diabetic neuropathic changes in vivo in STZ (strepto-
zotocin)-diabetic rats may do so by restoring Ca2+ homoeostasis
and/or mitochondrial function (Fernyhough et al., 2003; Huang
et al., 2003, 2005a, 2005b). The purpose of the present study
was to determine if axons, the primary site of neurodegenera-
tion in diabetes, exhibit Ca2+ dyshomoeostasis and to focus on
the role of a putative impairment in SERCA function as a key
aetiological factor.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Induction, treatment and confirmation of type 1
diabetes
Male Sprague­Dawley rats were made diabetic with a single
intraperitoneal injection of 75 mg/kg STZ (Sigma). Starting
body weights ranged from 275 to 325 g. At study end, body
weights of age-matched controls were 717.8¡71.0 g and
for STZ-induced diabetic rats weights were 428.1¡48.9 g
(means¡S.D., n520). All diabetic rats exhibited blood
[glucose].25 mM. At 3 months all animals were assessed for
hind-paw thermal sensitivity using the Hargreaves apparatus,
and diabetic cohorts exhibited significant signs of neuropathy,
e.g. hypoalgesia (results not shown). Age-matched control or
STZ-induced diabetic rats were maintained for 3­5 months,
then were killed and DRG tissue collected for tissue culture.
Animal procedures followed guidelines of University of
Manitoba Animal Care Committee using Canadian Council
of Animal Care rules.
Sensory neuron cultures and treatments
DRG from adult male Sprague­Dawley rats, age-matched
control or STZ-induced diabetic (300­500 g), were disso-
ciated using a previously described method (Huang et al.,
2005b; Zherebitskaya et al., 2009). Neurons were cultured
on to poly-DL-ornithine and laminin-coated 25 mm glass-
bottomed dishes (Willco) in defined Hams F12 medium in the
presence of modified Bottensteins N2 supplement without
insulin (0.1 mg/ml transferrin, 20 nM progesterone, 100 mM
putrescine, 30 nM sodium selenite and 1 mg/ml BSA; all
additives were from Sigma; culture medium was from Life
Technologies). The medium was also supplemented with a
cocktail of sub-saturating neurotrophic factors [0.3 ng/ml
NGF (nerve growth factor), 5 ng/ml GDNF (glial-derived
neurotrophic factor) and 1 ng/ml NT-3]. In all studies, normal
neurons were cultured in the presence of 10 mM glucose and
10 nM insulin. In all studies, diabetic neurons were exposed
to 25 mM glucose and no insulin to attempt to mimic hyper-
glycaemic conditions found in STZ-diabetic rats, as previously
described (Zherebitskaya et al., 2009).

Culture inserts
Neurons were plated on six-well plate inserts, which have PET
[poly (ethylene terephthalate)] membrane with translucent
optical properties and 8 mm pores with a density of 26105
pores/cm2. This insert makes culturing suitable for growing
the cell body and axon compartments of neurons on different
sites of the membrane and to then separately collect these
compartments in lysates for Western blotting (Zheng et al.,
2001). Neurons were cultured on inserts for 2 days in defined
Hams F12 medium in the presence of modified Bottensteins
N2 supplement without insulin as described above. The purity
of axonal versus cell body samples was checked by immuno-
staining or Western blotting for the neuronal-specific nuclear
protein ATF3 [activating transcription factor 3; antibody:
ATF3 (C-19), 1:100, Santa Cruz]. Hanging cell culture inserts
were purchased from Millipore.
Fluo-4/AM (acetoxymethyl ester)-based relative
intracellular Ca2+ level analysis
Lumbar DRG neurons from age-matched control or 3­5 month
STZ-induced diabetic rats were cultured for 1 day and then were
loaded for 45 min at 37°C with 1 mM Fluo-4/AM (Invitrogen) to
estimate relative intracellular Ca2+ levels in the axons. KCl
(30 mM) and caffeine (20 mM) were added to the medium by
perfusion for 10 s following baseline fluorescence measure-
ments. Real-time imaging was done with a Carl Zeiss LSM510
confocal inverted microscope. Fluorescence was excited in
single-track mode with the 488 nm band of the argon laser
and emission detected with an LP 530 filter. High-resolution
scanning was performed with a C-Aprochromat 636/1.2 w
objective lens. The amplifier gain was kept constant throughout.
All axons in each field were assessed as average of fluorescence
pixel intensity per axon at each time point using the Carl Zeiss
software package. The fluorescence intensity levels are presented
relative to baseline and shown as DF/F. Data were transferred
into MS-Excel program for further statistical analysis.
Plasma membrane potential imaging
Plasma membrane potential was measured in cultured
neurons using a PMPI (plasma membrane potential indicator;
a proprietary component of the kit) from the Molecular
Devices membrane potential assay kit. Dye was reconstituted
in 1 ml of distilled water (PMPI stock) and was used at 1:3000
dilution. Cultured lumber DRG neurons were incubated with
PMPI at 37°C for 1 h. KCl was added into the medium by
perfusion for 10 s to a final concentration of 30 mM
following baseline fluorescence measurements. Changes in
fluorescence in axons were assessed with a Carl Zeiss LSM510
confocal inverted microscope as described above.
Mag-Fura patch-clamp
The intraluminal ER Ca2+ concentration was measured in
neuronal cell bodies as described previously (Solovyova and
Verkhratsky, 2002; Solovyova et al., 2002). Briefly, for ER
([Ca2+]ER
) measurements cells were loaded with AM deriva-
tives of Mag-Fura 2. The AM form of the indicator can
passively diffuse across cell membranes. Once inside the cell,
cytosolic and organelle esterases cleave the ester group off
the probe, restoring the active Ca2+-binding form of the
indicator, and confining the indicator within different
intracellular compartments. Loading at 37°C is favoured due
to entrapment into intracellular organelles. In the patch-
clamp configuration, the cytosolic dye was washed out into
the pipette allowing selective imaging of the fluorescence
of the dye trapped within the ER lumen. The Mag-Fura 2
was calibrated in situ using an ionomycin technique (see
Solovyova et al., 2002). Fluorescence images were captured
using an Olympus IX70 inverted microscope (640 UV
objective) equipped with a CCD (charge-coupled device)
cooled intensified camera (Pentamax Gene IV; Roper
Scientific). The specimen was alternately illuminated at 340,
380 and 488 nm by a monochromator (Polychrom IV; TILL
Photonics) at a cycle frequency 3­5 Hz. Control over the
experiment, image storage and off-line analysis was per-
formed by use of MetaFluor/MetaMorph software (Universal
Imaging Corporation) running on a Windows 98 workstation.
Fura 2/AM (fura 2 acetoxymethyl ester)
ratiometric [Ca2+]i
determination and R123
(rhodamine 123) fluorescence imaging
DRG neurons were isolated from Sprague­Dawley rats and
cultured on 35 mm glass-bottomed dishes. After 24 h in cul-
ture, neurons were treated with different doses of TG
(thapsigargin; Sigma) for an additional 24 h prior to calcium
imaging. Medium was then removed and cells were incubated
in loading buffer (140 mM NaCl, 3 mM KCl, 2 mM CaCl2
,
2 mM MgCl2
, 10 mM glucose and 20 mM Hepes/NaOH, pH
7.4) with 5 mM Fura 2/AM for 30 min. Fura 2/AM was
removed and cells washed three times in buffer, before
adding fresh buffer containing 5 mM R123. After an
additional 30 min, dishes were imaged on an Olympus IX70
Microscope connected to a CCD camera and perfusion sys-
tem. Buffer was perfused over the cells at 2 ml/min to
establish a baseline, prior to perfusing drugs over the cells for
30 s at the aforementioned flow rate. After calcium imaging,
the perfusion system was deactivated and FCCP (carbonyl
cyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone; 10 mM) was
added at the end of the experiment to assess mitochondrial
inner membrane potential as previously described (Huang et
al., 2002, 2005b). The R123 fluorescence intensity levels are
presented relative to baseline and shown as DF/F.
Immunocytochemistry for detection of calnexin
and GRP78 (glucose-regulated protein of 78 kDa)
Cultures were fixed with 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde in PBS
(pH 7.4) for 15 min at room temperature (22°C) then
permeabilized with 0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min.

Cells were then incubated in blocking buffer (Roche) diluted
with FBS and 1.0 mM PBS (1:1:3, by vol.) for 1 h then rinsed
three times with PBS. Primary antibodies against calnexin
(1:200; AbCam) and GRP78 BiP (1:400; AbCam) were used as
ER stress markers and antibody to b-tubulin III (1:500; Sigma)
was applied as a neuron marker and incubated at 4°C over-
night. CY3- and FITC-conjugated secondary antibodies
(1:250; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) were applied
for 1 h at room temperature. All axons in each field were
assessed as average of fluorescence pixel intensity for
calnexin or GRP78 per axon at each time point. Axon length
was derived from the b-tubulin III signal and expressed as
mean pixel area. Cell body signals were deleted, and the
fluorescence intensity signals for calnexin or GRP78 were
expressed relative to the mean pixel area (b-tubulin III signal).
Western blotting for protein expression
Cultured DRG neurons were harvested after 48 h by scraping
and lysates prepared in ice-cold stabilization buffer contain-
ing: 0.1 M Pipes, 5 mM MgCl2
, 5 mM EGTA, 0.5% Triton X-100,
20% glycerol, 10 mM NaF, 1 mM PMSF, and protease inhibitor
cocktail (Fernyhough et al., 1999). Proteins were assayed using
DC protein assay (Bio-Rad) and Western-blot analysis per-
formed as previously described (Zherebitskaya et al., 2009). The
samples (5 mg of total protein/lane) were resolved on an SDS/
PAGE (10% gel) and electroblotted (100 V, 1 h) on to a
nitrocellulose membrane. Blots were then blocked in 5% (w/v)
non-fat dried skimmed milk powder containing 0.05% Tween
overnight at 4°C, rinsed in PBS-T (PBS with 0.05% Tween 20)
and then incubated with the primary antibody for calnexin
(1:800; AbCam), GRP78 Bip (1:500; AbCam) and ATF3 (1:300;
Santa Cruz). Total ERK (extracellular-signal-regulated kinase;
1: 2000; Santa Cruz Biotechnologies) was used as a loading
control (previously demonstrated not to change under diabetic
conditions). After four washes of 10 min in PBS-T, secondary
antibody was applied for 1 h at room temperature. The blots
were rinsed, incubated in Western Blotting Luminol Reagent
(Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and imaged using the Bio-Rad
Fluor-S image analyser.
Statistical analysis
Where appropriate, data were subjected to one-way ANOVA
with post-hoc comparison using Dunnett's or Tukey's tests or
regression analysis with a one-phase exponential decay
parametric test with Fisher's parameter (GraphPad Prism 4,
GraphPad Software Inc.). In all other cases two-tailed
Student's t tests were performed.
RESULTS
Axons of sensory neurons derived from diabetic
rats exhibit Ca2+ dyshomoeostasis
Lumbar DRG sensory neurons were isolated from age-matched
control or 3­5-month-old STZ-induced diabetic rats and
cultured simultaneously under defined conditions for 1­2 days.
Neurons were loaded with Fluo-4/AM and then axonal fluore-
scence signals collected using a confocal microscope. Neurons
were perfused for 10 s with either 30 mM KCl (Figure 1) or
20 mM caffeine (Figure 2) and relative alterations in [Ca2+]i
assessed in real time in axons. The KCl-induced depolarization-
dependent rise in [Ca2+]i

treatment and regressed towards baseline by approximately
60 s (Figure 1E). The values for AUC (area under the curve) and
peak amplitude were significantly lower in axons from diabetic
neurons (Figure 1F). In Figures 1(G)­1(I), the PMPI signals are
shown confirming that 30 mM KCl caused a significant
depolarization of the neurons and that the degree of KCl-
induced depolarization was similar for control and diabetic
neurons. Caffeine-induced ER Ca2+ release was also quantified
(Figure 2) and again in the axons of diabetic neurons the
values for the AUC and peak amplitude for the rise in relative
[Ca2+]i
were significantly lower. It is of note that, in response to
KCl or caffeine, the transient change in [Ca2+]i
was not fol-
lowed by a complete return to resting levels in axons of normal
or diabetic neurons and may reflect impaired buffering
capacity of Ca2+ in axons versus cell bodies.
Immunocytochemistry reveals reduced
expression of calnexin in axons but no evidence
of ER stress
The impaired Fluo-4/AM-based [Ca2+]i
responses in response
to KCl and caffeine in axons could have been the result of
loss of ER mass and/or induction of ER stress; therefore,
neurons were stained for the ER marker, calnexin, and the ER
stress indicator, GRP78. Neurons from control or diabetic
rats were cultured for 1 day and exhibited specific and
uniform antibody staining for calnexin across the cell body
and axons of control and diabetic neurons (Figures 3A and
3B). The fluorescence intensity per axon for calnexin staining
was determined and showed that, in diabetic neurons, there
was a significant decrease in calnexin expression of 25%
(Figure 3C). The antibody to GRP78 also gave specific and
uniform staining and there was no difference in axonal
staining intensity between control and diabetic cultures
(Figures 3D­3F).

Western blotting for expression of calnexin and
GRP78 in axon versus cell body shows no effect
of diabetes
We attempted to confirm the immunocytochemistry experi-
ments using a Western blotting approach coupled with a
culture system permitting separation of axon from cell body.
Neurons were grown for 2 days on inserts with a mesh size
allowing axons to grow through the mesh to the underside.
Figures 4(A)­4(D) show immunostaining for neuron-specific
b-tubulin III and the nuclear-specific ATF3 on the top versus
underside of the culture inserts. The immunostaining
demonstrates the underside of the membrane exhibited a
purely axonal component. In Figure 4(E), Western blotting
confirmed that ATF3 expression was restricted to the top
surface corresponding with neuronal cell bodies. Neurons
from age-matched control and STZ-induced diabetic rats
were then grown on inserts for 2 days and the cell body

Western blotting (Figure 4F). Three independent experiments
clearly demonstrated that expression of calnexin and GRP78
were similar between control and diabetic neurons in the cell
body or axon compartments (Figure 4G).
Ca2+ uptake into the ER is impaired in diabetic
neurons
To test whether the deficiencies in [Ca2+]i
homoeostasis in
diabetic neurons were due to reduced [Ca2+]ER
, we compared
intra-ER Ca2+ dynamics in normal and in diabetic neurons
using direct recordings of [Ca2+]ER
. Resting [Ca2+]ER
level was
substantially reduced in cells from diabetic neurons (average
values 244¡19 mM, n517 for control neurons and 97¡21
mM, n57 for diabetic neurons). To assess the rates of Ca2+
release, leakage and accumulation, we first stimulated the
cells with caffeine (which induced RyRs opening and Ca2+
release from the ER; Figure 5A). After caffeine washout the
[Ca2+]ER
returned to the pre-stimulated level because of SERCA-
dependent Ca2+ uptake. Then the cells were stimulated with
TG, which inhibited SERCA pumps and unmasked Ca2+
leakage from the ER that eventually led to the store depletion
(Figure 5A). By plotting the rate of Ca2+ uptake/Ca2+ leakage

Sensory neurons were acutely isolated from control and 14-week-old STZ-
diabetic rats, cultured for 2 h and then patched and ER Ca2+ was monitored
using Mag-Fura 2 low affinity Ca2+-sensitive fluorescent probes, as described
previously (Solovyova et al., 2002). Values for resting [Ca2+]ER

versus actual [Ca2+]ER
(see Solovyova et al., 2002 for details),
we found that both the maximal rate of Ca2+ reuptake and
Ca2+ leakage were severely depressed in diabetic neurons
(Figure 5B). On average the maximal Ca2+ re-uptake rate was
6¡0.85 mM/s, n56 in control cells versus 2.7¡0.3 mM/s in
diabetic neurons; the rates for maximal Ca2+ leakage were
1.5¡0.17 mM/s, n56 and 0.37¡0.1 mM/s, n55 for control
and diabetic neurons respectively.
Long-term TG treatment of normal neurons
induces Ca2+ dyshomoeostasis that mimics the
diabetic state
Compromised Ca2+ accumulation into the ER could underlie
aberrant Ca2+ homoeostasis in diabetes. This could be due to
impaired activity and/or expression of SERCA and therefore,
to further strengthen evidence for a role of SERCA in diabetes-
induced abnormalities in sensory neuron phenotype, we
exposed normal neurons for 1 day to different concentrations
of TG, a specific and irreversible inhibitor of the SERCA pump,
in order to artificially compromise SERCA function. Normal
neurons were cultured for 1 day under defined conditions and
in the presence of TG (3, 30 or 300 nM) and then loaded with
Fura 2/AM to assess Ca2+ homoeostasis using ratiometric
fluorescence imaging. Increasing TG from 3 to 300 nM caused
a significant rise in the resting [Ca2+]i
in normal neurons
(Figure 6B). Neurons were perfused for 30 s with 20 mM
caffeine (Figure 6C) or 30 mM KCl (Figure 6D) and the
maximum change in [Ca2+]i
is presented. Thapsigargin at 30
and 300 nM caused a significant decrease in the caffeine and
KCl-induced rise in [Ca2+]i
. In a separate study, normal neurons
were treated for 1 day with 30 nM TG and then loaded
simultaneously with Fura 2/AM and R123 for assessment of
resting [Ca2+]i
and mitochondrial inner membrane potential.
The resting [Ca2+]i
was again significantly raised from 148 to
320 nM in TG-treated cells and was paralleled with a depo-
larization of the mitochondrial inner membrane potential
(Figure 6E).

DISCUSSION
We have previously demonstrated that neurons derived from 3-
to 5-month-old STZ-induced diabetic rats (an experimental
model of Type 1 diabetes) undergo axonal dystrophy following
2­4 days in cell culture with evidence for distal loss of func-
tional mitochondria, reduced plasticity and formation of axonal
swellings (Zherebitskaya et al., 2009; Akude et al., 2010). This
pathology is homologous with axonopathy seen in animal
models and humans with diabetic neuropathy (Schmidt et al.,
1997; Christianson et al., 2003; Quattrini et al., 2007). In the
present study, analysis of Ca2+ homoeostasis in axons of
neurons derived from diabetic rats and cultured for 1­2 days
shows a decrease in resting ER Ca2+ content. Quantification of
calnexin expression in axons, a marker of ER mass, revealed no
major difference between control and diabetic cultures,
indicating no changes in overall ER presence in the cells.
Axonal expression of ER stress protein GRP78 also was not
altered by a history of diabetes. Patch-clamp and pharmaco-
logical studies on cell bodies of sensory neurons showed that
the function of SERCA pumps was depressed in diabetic cul-
tures, as was expression of SERCA2a protein (confirmed in a
previous in vivo study with intact lumbar DRG; Verkhratsky and
Fernyhough, 2008), and could be responsible for impaired
loading of Ca2+ into the ER. The results support previous work
on acutely isolated neurons from diabetic rodents (Voitenko
et al., 1999; Kostyuk et al., 2001; Huang et al., 2002; Kruglikov
et al., 2004) and enforce the notion that early abnormalities in
Ca2+ homoeostasis mediated by impaired SERCA functioning
may trigger axonal degeneration seen in diabetes.
The [Ca2+]ER
imaging studies presented in Figure 5 reveal
that Ca2+ uptake into the ER lumen was suppressed by at
least 2-fold in diabetic cultures. Figure 6 shows that specific
inhibition of SERCA activity using TG was able to closely
mimic abnormalities in Ca2+ homoeostasis seen in diabetes,
e.g. raised resting [Ca2+]i
and impaired ER Ca2+ release. The
immunocytochemistry results in Figure 3 suggested a general
loss of ER mass in axons in diabetic culture; however, this
finding was not supported by the Western blotting approach
using culture inserts (Figure 4). The Western blot data were
generated relative to total protein and in diabetes a general
down-regulation of protein occurs and so specific changes in
calnexin may have been under-estimated. There is previous
evidence of reduced expression of SERCA2a, and these data
support the hypothesis that diabetes-induced SERCA deac-
tivation underlies reduced Ca2+ loading in the ER. Diminished
activity of SERCA could be solely due to loss of expression,
and there is evidence that insulin can regulate SERCA activity
in non-neuronal cells (Borge and Wolf, 2003; Abdallah et al.,
2006). However, it is also feasible that impaired cellular
bioenergetics may result in suboptimal ATP delivery for
SERCA function since the respiratory chain activity and
expression in DRG neurons is down-regulated in STZ-induced
diabetic rats (Chowdhury et al., 2010; Akude et al., 2011). The
cause of the latter feature of diabetes-induced impairment in
neuronal function is complex and could also be the result of
dysfunctional Ca2+ homoeostasis. Figure 6 demonstrates that
TG-induced decrease in resting [Ca2+]ER
and a subsequent rise
in resting [Ca2+]i
, as seen in sensory neurons acutely isolated
from diabetic rats and mice (Voitenko et al., 2000; Kostyuk
et al., 2001; Huang et al., 2002; Kruglikov et al., 2004), was
accompanied by mitochondrial inner membrane depolariza-
tion. Impaired Ca2+ homoeostasis leading to a rise in resting
[Ca2+]i
may result in Ca2+ entry into the mitochondrion,
primarily through the mitochondrial Ca2+ uniporter, raised
intramitochondrial calcium concentration ([Ca2+]m
) and
mitochondrial membrane depolarization and altered bioener-
getics (Verkhratsky and Toescu, 1998; Verkhratsky and
Fernyhough, 2008).
Our observations show that ER membrane dysfunction in
the form of aberrant SERCA activity was present, but in the
absence of overt ER stress. The marker of ER stress, GRP78, did
not undergo an elevation in expression in cell body or axons
of cultured diabetic neurons. This confirmed preliminary
work from our laboratory showing a lack of effect of diabetes
on GRP78 expression in lumbar DRG or sciatic nerve of 2­3
month-old STZ-induced diabetic rats. While the loss of Ca2+
loading in the ER was not significant enough to trigger a
measurable ER stress response in our system the possibility of
induction of SOCE [SOC (store-operated calcium) entry]
cannot be dismissed. Neurons have recently been demon-
strated to exhibit SOCE and express the ER proteins STIM1
(stromal interaction molecule 1) and STIM2 that detect Ca2+
loading in the ER and link to SOC channel activity in the plasma
membrane (Gruszczynska-Biegala et al., 2011). The permanent
depletion of ER Ca2+ in diabetic neurons could be sensed by
the STIM proteins and lead to an activation of SOCE and
contribute to the rise in resting [Ca2+]i
. In fact, in an HIV-
induced model of sensory neuron degeneration blockade of
SOCE was protective (Hoke et al., 2009).
The impact of a long-term rise in resting [Ca2+]i
on axonal
function and association with axon degeneration has been
discussed in detail elsewhere (Coleman, 2005; Stys, 2005;
Verkhratsky and Fernyhough, 2008). Examples of Ca2+-induced
aberrant axon behaviour include fragmentation of micro-
tubules due to activation of proteases of the proteasome or
calpain and have been associated with the expression of the
autophagy marker LC3 (Knoferle et al., 2010). In the optic
nerve preparation, lesion-dependent LC3 expression has been
linked to an initial axotomy-induced increase of [Ca2+]i
and to
a secondary elevation in autophagy (Knoferle et al., 2010). This
is of importance, since in lumbar DRG in STZ-induced diabetic
rats there is preliminary evidence for markers of autophagy
being enhanced (Towns et al., 2005). The Ca2+-dependent
activation of calpain in the axoplasm is also of particular
interest, since this event has been directly linked to mito-
chondrial biology in axons and generation of axonal swellings
(Kilinc et al., 2009). Other consequences of Ca2+ influx are of
note: there is a general alteration in the phosphorylation
balance, mediated for example by Ca2+/CaM (calmodulin)
binding to the phosphatase calcineurin or to CaM kinases

which signal to other kinases and thus may affect an array of
proteins, including MAPs (microtubule-associated proteins)
and motor proteins (Zempel et al., 2010). This array of
Ca2+-induced events could lead to cytoskeletal dissolution,
mitochondrial dysfunction and eventually axonal degeneration.
In conclusion, axons of diabetic neurons exhibit impaired
calcium homoeostasis with dysfunction primarily the result of
sub-optimal SERCA activity and/or expression. The diminished
ability of the ER to accumulate Ca2+ could lead to the rise in
resting [Ca2+]i
observed in neurons from diabetic rats. The sub-
optimal levels of Ca2+ within the ER lumen could also initiate
SOCE that could contribute to a rise in resting [Ca2+]i
. The two
major consequences of the rise in resting [Ca2+]i
could be
mitochondrial dysfunction, mediated though enhanced Ca2+
uptake and inner membrane depolarization, and a general
effect of raised Ca2+ on an array of enzymes important for
homoeostatic control of protein function in the axoplasm. The
outcome is axonal degeneration through dissolution of
the cytoarchitecture and/or loss of cellular bioenergetics.
