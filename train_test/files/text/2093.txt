ABSTRACT
Background: To date, there is no consensus regarding adult cutoffs
of percentage of body fat or estimated cutoffs on the basis of na-
tionally representative samples with rigorous body-composition
measurements.
Objective: We developed cutoffs of percentage of body fat on the
basis of the relation between dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry­
measured fat mass and BMI (in kg/m2) stratified by sex, age, and
race-ethnicity by using 1999­2004 NHANES data.
Design: A simple regression (percentage of body fat = b0
+ b1
·
1 4 BMI) was fit for each combination of sex (men and women), 3
age groups (18­29, 30­49, and 50­84 y of age), and 3 race-ethnicity
groups (non-Hispanic whites, non-Hispanic blacks, and Mexican
Americans). Model fitting included a consideration of complex sur-
vey design and multiple imputations. Cutoffs of percentage of body
fat were computed that corresponded to BMI cutoffs of 18.5, 25, 30,
35, and 40 on the basis of estimated prediction equations.
Results: R2 ranged from 0.54 to 0.72 for men (n = 6544) and 0.58 to
0.79 for women (n = 6362). In men, the percentage of body fat that
corresponded to a BMI of 18.5, 25, 30, 35, and 40 across age and
racial-ethnic groups ranged from 12.2% to 19.0%, 22.6% to 28.0%,
27.5% to 32.3%, 31.0% to 35.3%, and 33.6% to 37.6%, respec-
tively; the corresponding ranges in women were from 24.6% to
32.3%, 35.0% to 40.2%, 39.9% to 44.1%, 43.4% to 47.1%, and
46.1% to 49.4%, respectively. The oldest age group had the highest
cutoffs of percentage of body fat. Non-Hispanic blacks had the
lowest cutoffs of percentage of body fat. Cutoffs of percentage of
body fat were higher in women than in men.
Conclusions: Cutoffs of percentage of body fat that correspond
to the current US BMI cutoffs are a function of sex, age, and
race-ethnicity. These factors should be taken into account when
considering the appropriateness of levels of percentage of body
fat. Am J Clin Nutr 2012;95:594­602.
INTRODUCTION
Excess fatness is a major global public health concern (1) that
is associated with both mortality (2, 3) and medical comorbidities
such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease (4, 5). Excess fatness
in most epidemiologic studies has been defined on the basis of
overweight or obese BMI (in kg/m2) criteria developed by the
National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (6, 7). However, it has
often been debated whether BMI represents body fat adequately
(8­11). For example, although the relation of mortality and
comorbidities with BMI is well recognized as J-shaped (3), risk
of mortality could monotonically increase with fat mass (12­14).
Therefore, it remains an open question as to whether the defi-
nition of human obesity should be based on BMI or body fat.
There have been considerable efforts aimed at linking BMI
with the percentage of body fat on relatively small sample sizes
with varied body-composition measurements (15­21). However,
among these efforts, Gallagher et al (21) used the percentage
of body fat measured by DXA5, which has been accepted as
a reference method of body-composition measurement for large-
scale studies and proposed an approach for the development of
guidelines that predict the percentage of body fat on the basis of
BMI from a relatively large, if convenient, sample size. For this
reason, estimates of percentage of body fat of Gallagher et al
(21) have served as percentage of body fat ranges for research
purpose (see, eg, reference 22). Nevertheless, there exists no
consensus of percentage of body fat criteria to define obesity or
excess percentage of body fat (23) despite that the American
Association of Clinical Endocrinology/American College of En-
docrinology suggested 25% and 35% of body fat as cutoffs for
obesity in men and women, respectively (24).
The NHANES had begun to use DXA scanners to measure
total body fat and, thus, the percentage of body fat since 1999
when it became a biannual regular survey. This introduction of
a reference measurement method in the NHANES offers an
important opportunity to further develop and update predic-
tions of the percentage of body fat on the basis of BMI with in
vivo body fat measured by using DXA from an unprecedented
nationally representative large-size sample. In this article, as

percentage of body fat , we present updated prediction equations
for the percentage of body fat on the basis of BMI and develop
cutoffs of percentage of body fat in reference to BMI cutoffs of
18.5, 25, 30, 35, and 40. These cutoffs define underweight,
normal, overweight, and obesity class I, II, and III status ranges
(6, 7). These developed cutoffs of percentage of body fat were
stratified by sex, age, and race-ethnicity by using the NHANES
data survey from 1999 to 2004.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS
We used adult subjects aged 18 y from the US NHANES
1999­2004 data set, which is a combined data set of 3 biannual
cross-sectional waves from 1999­2000, 2001­2002, and 2003­
2004. Subjects were measured in vivo for regional body fat dis-
tributions by using DXA scanners in mobile examination centers.
A Hologic QDR-4500A fan-beam densitometer (Hologic Inc)
was used throughout the NHANES 1999­2004 with Hologic
software version 8.26:a3* (Hologic Inc). Because the algorithm of
the QDR-4500A densitometer (Hologic Inc) overestimated lean
mass by 5 6 1% (25), the NHANES DXA lean mass was de-
creased by 5%, and an equivalent kilogram weight was added to
the fat mass without affecting the total mass (26). However, self-
reported pregnant women (even those women with negative
pregnancy test results), and subjects heavier than 300 lb (136 kg)
or taller than 6 ft 5 in (195 cm) were excluded from the DXA
measurement on the basis of NHANES criteria (27). Anthropo-
metric measures were also available including measured height
and weight with BMI calculated as weight (in kg) divided by
height (in m2), which was used for the current study.
With respect to missing data, ;22% of subjects in the
NHANES 1999­2004 had at least one missing regional body
fat measurement that was due to invalid DXA scanning (28).
Reasons for missing data included, but were not limited to,
meeting aforementioned exclusion criteria, the presence of certain
nonremovable objects (eg, prostheses), excess X-ray noise, and
positional problems (28). For this reason, the NHANES 1999­
2004 generated 5 imputed data sets for missing DXA regional
body-composition measurements; imputation for missing DXA
data in later NHANES surveys are currently ongoing (28). Nev-
ertheless, imputation was not applied to pregnant women or to
subjects with amputated body parts and, thus, these subjects were
excluded from the current study. Also excluded were subjects
who had incomplete anthropometric BMI measurements and
highly variable imputed DXA measurements. All of these ex-
clusions resulted in a total sample of n = 12,906 subjects (6544
men and 6362 women) who had complete information, observed
or imputed, on all variables used for this study.

For the development of the percentage of body fat and total
body fat in reference to BMI status, we stratified the sample by
sex, race-ethnicity, and 3 age groups. The percentage body fat
differs between men and women (21) and is also associated
with ethnicity (29). In this study, we considered the following
NHANES race-ethnicity classifications (with the NHANES
variable name RIDRETH1) categorized by the NHANES: NHW,
NHB, and MEX who are Hispanic and of Mexican origin. Other
Hispanics and other racial-ethnic and multi-racial groups were
excluded because of very small sample sizes.
Age was categorized into the following 3 groups: 18­29,
30­49, and 50­84 y. This age categorization was based on the
following considerations: 1) total potassium declines after ;30 y
of age in both men and women (30); 2) age of 50 y is approx-
imately when women progress into menopause, which affects
body fat mass (31); and 3) unweighted sample sizes are ap-
proximately equal across the 3 age groups for both men and
women in all ethnic groups except NHW who include more
older subjects than other groups. However, weighted sample
sizes and percentages at the US adult population level were not

Statistical analysis
The NHANES implemented a multistage, complex survey
design to increase the representativeness of the US adult pop-
ulation. Therefore, by adhering to the analytic guidelines sug-
gested by the NHANES (32), we took into account sampling
strata, the primary sampling unit, and individual sampling
weights for descriptive and inferential statistical analyses by
using SAS PROC SURVEYFREQ, SURVEYMEANS, and
SURVEYREG with SAS v9.1.3 (SAS Institute Inc). Statistical
analyses were applied to each of 5 imputed data sets, which
yielded 5 sets of results from which final results were obtained on
the basis of a pooling method proposed by Rubin (33) by applying
SAS PROC MIANALYZE (SAS Institute Inc). For descriptive
statistics, we reported the mean and SEM. For inferential sta-
tistics, we reported estimated regression coefficients and SEs.
Graphical presentations and a lowess fit (34) were performed by
using S-plus v8.1.1 (TIBCO Software Inc).
Determinations of ranges of percentage of body fat
First, we inspected a scatter plot of percentage of body fat
compared with BMI for men and women and showed that the
relation between them was apparently nonlinear as shown by the
lowess fit (Figure 1). The nonlinear pattern of the relation was
consistent across the 9 combinations of age and ethnicity strata
in both men and women. To linearize the relation, we trans-
formed BMI into the inverse BMI (ie, 1 4 BMI). The linearity
of 1 4 BMI was apparent on the basis of the lowess fits (Figure
2). Of note, Figures 1 and 2 were based on n = 1000 randomly
selected subjects for each sex from the first imputed data set.
However, the lowess fits were based on entire subjects for each
sex. Again, the linear pattern was consistent across the combi-
nations of the strata. Therefore, we fit the simple linear model

with SAS PROC SURVEYREG (SAS Institute Inc). Goodness
of fit was quantified by R2, which was a square of the correlation
r between percentage of body fat and 1 4 BMI. We determined
cutoffs of percentage of body fat by replacing BMI with cor-
responding BMI cutoffs in the prediction equations:

Finally, on the basis of estimated cutoffs, we estimated the
sex-age-race-ethnicity­specific population-level prevalence of
subjects who were conditionally BMI­percentage of body fat
discordant. Specifically, we estimated the prevalence of subjects
whose percentage of body fat was greater than or equal to the sex-
age-race-ethnicity­specific cutoffs that corresponding to a BMI
of 25and 30 in subjects those who had a BMI 25 and 30,
respectively.
RESULTS
Descriptive statistics
Subject characteristics are described in Table 2. NHW and
MEX subjects were the oldest and youngest, respectively, in
both sexes. In men, the percentage of body fat was the lowest in
the NHB group despite that BMI was comparable across the 3
racial-ethnic groups, and NHB subjects were older than MEX
subjects. In women, however, the difference in percentage of
body fat was not biologically meaningful, if significant, across
the 3 groups despite that the NHB group had the greatest BMI,
and MEX subjects were the youngest.

and ethnicity are show in Table 3. The predicted relation be-
tween the percentage of body fat and BMI is depicted in Figure
3, which shows that the relation depended on age and race-
ethnicity in both men and women. Intercept estimates and slope
estimates differed across the strata. However, the estimated re-
gression coefficient b1
was significantly ,0 across all strata
defined by sex, age, and race-ethnicity, which supported that the
percentage of body fat is an increasing function of BMI with an
upper limit. All of the estimated coefficients were significant at
a 2-sided P , 0.0001, and the goodness of fit R2 ranged from
0.54 to 0.72 for men and 0.58 to 0.79 for women across sex, age,
and race-ethnicity. Although R2 was slightly higher in women,
negative changes in the percentage of body fat per unit change
in 1 4 BMI (and, thus, positive changes per BMI) were greater
in men in MEX subjects regardless of age and in 18­29- and
50­84-y-old NHW subjects (Table 3). In contrast, the changes
were smaller in men in NHB subjects regardless of age.
Predicted percentage of body fat and its cutoffs
Cutoffs of percentage of body fat predicted on the basis of the
estimated equation presented in Table 3 are shown in Table 4.
Across age and racial-ethnic groups, cutoffs of percentage of
body fat in men that corresponded to a BMI of 18.5, 25, 30, 35,
and 40 ranged from 12.2% to 19.0%, 22.6% to 28.0%, 27.5% to
32.3%, 31.0% to 35.3%, and 33.6% to 37.6%, respectively. In
women, cutoffs for these same BMI values ranged from 24.6%
to 32.3%, 35.0% to 40.2%, 39.9% to 44.1%, 43.4% to 47.1%,
and 46.1% to 49.4%, respectively (Table 4). For example, in
men, fat cutoffs of percentage of body fat that corresponded to
a BMI of 30 ranged from 27.5% (18­29-y-old NHBs) to 32.3%
(50­84-y-old NHWs), whereas for women, cutoffs ranged from
39.9% (18­29-y-old NHBs) to 44.1% (50­84-y-old MEXs).
Additional inspection of Table 4 and Figure 3 revealed the
following patterns. First, cutoffs of percentage of body fat were
highest in the oldest age group regardless of sex and race-ethnicity.
Cutoffs of percentage of body fat monotonically increased with age
in NHWand NHB subjects, except for in NHW men with a BMI of
40. However, in MEX subjects the mid 30­49-y-old group had the
lowest cutoffs of percentage of body fat for BMI 30 for both men
and women (Table 4). Furthermore, in MEX men, the youngest
group (ie, age 18­29 y) had the highest predicted percentage of
body fat for BMI .45 (Figure 3). Second, with respect to racial-
ethnic differences in percentage of body fat, NHB subjects had
a lower percentage of body fat for the same BMI compared with
that of NHW and MEX subjects regardless of age and sex. Third,
cutoffs of percentage of body fat were higher in women than
in men for any given BMI regardless of age and race-ethnicity
(Figure 3).
Finally, with regard to the predicted percentage of body fat­
BMI association, changes in the predicted percentage of body fat
per BMI unit change were relatively smaller for larger BMIs. This
result was due to the slopes of the tangent lines of the estimates
curves that declined with increasing BMI. This relation was also
reflected on the lowess curves, which showed that the percentage
of body fat bent downward after a BMI of ;30 for both men and
women (Figure 1). As could be inferred from Table 4 or from

fat per BMI unit between a BMI of 25 and 30 were much
smaller than those between a BMI of 18.5 and 25 for any
combination of the 3 demographic factors. Furthermore, for
every BMI interval, percentage of body fat changes per BMI
unit decreased with increasing age within each race-ethnicity for
both men and women.
Prevalence of subjects who were conditionally
BMI­percentage of body fat discordant
The population level­weighted prevalence estimates of sub-
jects who were conditionally BMI­percentage of body fat dis-
cordant is presented in Table 5. In general, prevalence estimates
were associated with the 3 demographic factors. The prevalence
ranged from 10.0% to 31.7% in subjects who had BMI 25 and
from 7.0% to 22.8% in subjects who had BMI 30. The prev-
alence was higher in older subjects regardless of sex and BMI.
The prevalence was the lowest in the NHW group for women
regardless of age and BMI levels. For the lower BMI of 25, the
prevalence was the lowest in NHB group for men. Overall, the
prevalence depended on the 3 demographic factors considered in
this study.
DISCUSSION
The principal finding of this study was that cutoffs of per-
centage of body fat that corresponded to BMI cutoffs sub-
stantially varied depending on age, sex, and race-ethnicity, which
are perhaps the most representative demographic factors. Spe-
cifically, the cutoff of percentage of body fat was the highest for
the same BMI in the oldest age group, was the lowest in NHB
subjects, and was higher in women (Tables 3 and 4). The relation
between BMI and the predicted percentage of body fat was
associated with different racial-ethnic backgrounds (Figure 3).
These findings were consistent with those from numerous pre-
vious studies. For example, ethnic differences in DXA-measured
percentage of body fat for BMI in young men and women were
also noted by Jackson et al (35) in a recent study. Therefore, these
factors should be taken into consideration in clinical settings
when body-composition measurements are evaluated. At the
same time, unlike BMI, anticipated clinical guidelines con-
cerning body fat should be flexible on the basis of those factors.
To this end, we believe that the developed prediction equations
(Table 3) with high R2 may have primary clinical usefulness
because they are very simple to apply and useful to predict
percentage of body fat for any given BMI. Furthermore, more
careful clinical attention and/or an additional medical exami-
nation may be warranted for subjects who are conditionally
BMI­percentage of body fat discordant whose BMI is lower but
with a higher percentage of body fat as presented in Table 5.
The finding that the percentage of body fat is a nonlinear
function of BMI does not necessarily imply that allocations of
weight gain to body composition are not necessarily proportional
as far as fat increases are concerned. Strong linear relations
between BMI and both fat mass and fat-free mass were observed

in the NHANES 1999­2004 data (data not shown). This finding
suggested that weight gain may proportionally be distributed to
fat mass and fat-free mass although the proportionality likely
depends much on age. Nevertheless, the percentage of body fat
appears to change at a BMI of ;30 kg/m2, after which the
percentage of body fat tends to plateau in men and women
(Figures 1 and 3). Furthermore, the percentage of body fat ap-
pears to be 50% and 60% in men and women, respectively
(Figure 1). Indeed, the estimated intercepts (Table 3) serve as
upper bounds, or asymptotes, for the percentage of body fat at
very large BMI values. Therefore, the percentage of body fat is
limited by ;55% and ;65%, which were the greatest intercept
estimates, in men and women, respectively, regardless of eth-
nicity, age, and BMI. Of note, the addition of the 14 BMI2 term
to the simple Equation 1 models did not substantially, although
significant in some cases, increase R2 in either men or women.
Increases ranged from 0.003 to 0.038 in men and 0.0001 to
0.018 in women.
However, the majority of previous prediction equations had
been based on an assumed linear relation between the percentage
of body fat and BMI (16­20), although studies tried to fit non-
linear equations. For example, Jackson et al (15) used the log
BMI with percentage of body fat on the basis of underwater
weighing, and Gallagher et al (21) used 1 4 BMI with the DXA-
measured percentage of body fat. The approach of Gallagher
et al (21) is the same as that applied in the current study and,
thus, makes comparison feasible. Compared with the cutoffs
reported in Gallagher et al (21), the current cutoffs of percentage
of body fat tend to be higher, especially in younger groups,
regardless of age, sex, and ethnicity. For example, the percent-
age of body fat that corresponded to a BMI of 25 for subjects
aged 20­60 y was estimated at ;33% and ;35% in White and
African American women, respectively, in Gallagher et al (21)
[Table 3 in Gallagher et al (21)], whereas our newly developed
cutoffs of percentage of body fat are ;35% and ;37% in
NHWs and NHBs, respectively, for people aged 18­50 y (Table
4). The underlying reasons for the overall increase in percentage
of body fat for the same BMI are unknown even if the samples
were different between our study and the study of Gallagher et al
(21). Potential causes include variation in DXA system cali-
bration (given that the NHANES 1999­2004 DXA-measured fat
mass was increased by 5% as previously mentioned), sample-
characteristic differences, and ecologic factors such as secular
trends in diet and activity levels and their translation into body-
composition effects.
Flegal et al (36) also reported the relation between the per-
centage of body fat and BMI by using the NHANES 1999­2004
for subjects aged 20 y. However, Flegal et al (36) applied an
empirical approach on the basis of descriptive statistics, which
was not model based and, therefore, differs from other ap-
proaches in the literature including ours used in the current
study. Specifically, Flegal et al (36) matched weighted percen-
tiles of the percentage of body fat with those of BMI in an age-
and sex-specific fashion by using percentiles of the percentage
of body fat as the reference (in contrast, we used BMI cutoffs as
references). Although the approach of Flegal et al (36) could
provide more accurate BMI values that correspond to given
intervals of percentage of body fat and age, it does not provide

a prediction equation for a given BMI value. Despite these
different approaches, both approaches agree on a similar con-
clusion that the BMI­percentage of body fat relation varies by
age, sex, and race-ethnicity.
The DXA method is not available in most primary care clinical
settings, although it is primarily used in research settings. An-
thropometric indicators such as BMI and skinfold thickness
measurements are frequently used to derive estimates of per-
centage of body fat, perhaps primarily because of the little cost
and ease of measurement (37). For this reason, these methods and
others, such as bioimpedance analysis, are used for screening
purposes followed by more precise and sophisticated, and
yet costly, methods that include DXA, computed tomography,
and MRI (38). Although DXA systems often provide slightly
different values for the percentage of body fat, as do all cross-
evaluated body-composition methods, the NHANES DXA-
measurement and -calibration approaches are extremely well
documented in publications and on the Web and, thus, are
comparable and reliable. Nevertheless, because the ranges of
percentage of body fat in the current report were developed with
a specific DXA system and related calibration (39), it is important
that the estimates of percentage of body fat provided by other
available clinical and research methods, including other DXA
systems, are calibrated to the values acquired in NHANES.
Otherwise, the ranges of NHANES percentage of body fat will
not be reliable when applied in these settings. Therefore, although
correlations among DXA systems for values of percentage of
body fat are significant (40), an important need exists for stan-
dardization of the percentage of body fat, which we believe
remains as an important issue in the field.
The current study had limitations. First, the developed ranges
of percentage of body fat were not developed on the basis of
comorbidity and mortality outcomes. Therefore, risk ratios across
cutoffs of percentage of body fat are not known, and it is also
unknown if the developed cutoffs are optimal for maximizing
sensitivity and specificity in diagnosing comorbidities. Once
developed on the basis of comorbidity and mortality outcomes,
such cutoffs of percentage of body fat will undoubtedly have
greater clinical use. Nevertheless, the choice of comorbid health
outcomes is both important and complicated; it will require long-
term follow-up of NHANES subjects for reliable assessments of
mortality and morbidity. Second, although NHANES 1999­2004
data included pediatric sample with subjects ,18 y old, we did
not attempt to develop prediction equations because the de-
velopment of weight status criteria on the basis of cutoffs of
percentage of body fat in the pediatric population should be
based on population percentiles of percentage of body fat (41) as
was adopted for the development of weight-status criteria on the
basis of BMI percentiles. Because the pediatric population,
unfortunately, does not have well-established cutoffs of per-
centage of body fat that define normal weight and obesity (42),
a future study should address this issue. Third, the percentage of
body fat­BMI relation may depend on the age within each age
stratum; especially in older participants within the 50­84-y-old
age stratum as noted by Flegal et al (36).
In conclusion, NHANES cutoffs of percentage of body fat as
developed in the current report can serve as a useful research and
clinical tool. Future studies are appropriate for continually
updating the DXA database on nationally representative samples
and to further explore topics such as the development of body-
composition ranges in relation to morbidity and mortality in both
adult and pediatric populations.
