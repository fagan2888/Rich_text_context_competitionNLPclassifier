Abstract
Objective: This study aimed to define the correlation between microRNA-122 (miR-122)
expression and hepatectomy-induced liver injury in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
Methods: Plasma miR-122 expression in patients with HCC and healthy age-matched controls
was determined, and correlated with plasma alanine transaminase activity (ALT) and bilirubin levels
preoperatively and on days 1 and 7 postoperation. Correlations between plasma miR-122 and
clinicopathological characteristics at 1 day postoperation were also determined.
Results: This study included 80 patients with HCC and 80 controls. Baseline expression of miR-
122 mRNA and ALT in patients with HCC was significantly higher than in controls. MiR-122
expression correlated with ALT and bilirubin levels preoperatively and on days 1 and
7 postoperatively. In patients with HCC who received a block of the first hepatic portal during
surgery and those with excised tumour size >5 cm, plasma miR-122 expression was significantly
increased on day 1 postoperatively, compared with expression levels in those who did not receive a
block and those with smaller tumours.
Conclusions: Plasma miR-122 expression is correlated with hepatectomy-induced liver injury in
patients with HCC. Increase in miR-122 expression could be used as an index of such injury before
and after hepatectomy in these patients.

To reduce bleeding during hepatectomy,
portal triad clamping techniques are usually
adopted but can inevitably cause liver
injury.3 It is therefore necessary to find a
serological marker that helps evaluate the
extent of any liver injury induced by
hepatectomy.
MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of
post-transcriptional regulators comprised
of short ($22 nucleotide) RNA sequences
that bind to complementary sequences in
the 30 UTR of multiple target mRNAs,
usually resulting in their silencing.4
MiRNAs have been used as a new class of
biomarkers,5,6 and the fast-growing number
of known miRNAs has allowed researchers
to link certain groups of miRNAs to spe-
cific cellular activities. The evaluation of
biomarker sets results in more specific and
meaningful information than the identifica-
tion of a single miRNA as a biomarker,
thereby enabling researchers to diagnose
diseases, monitor their course and tailor
therapies accordingly.7,8 MiRNA 122 (miR-
122) was one of the first examples of a
tissue-specific miRNA; it is highly expressed
in liver, where it constitutes 70% of the
total miRNA pool.9 A plethora of studies
using in vivo gene silencing, in vitro experi-
mentation and transcriptome profiling dem-
onstrate how miR-122 regulates the
networks of genes that control lipid metab-
olism,10 cell differentiation,11 hepatic circa-
dian regulation,12 hepatitis C virus
replication13 and systemic iron homeosta-
sis.14 Plasma miR-122 expression has been
used to evaluate drug-induced liver injury
and liver infection in patients with chronic
hepatitis B infection,15,16 and miR-122
expression could be a more accurate indi-
cator of liver injury than alanine amino-
transferase (ALT).17
The present study investigated whether
miR-122 expression in the plasma of
patients with HCC could be a novel sero-
logical marker for the evaluation of liver
injury induced by hepatectomy.
Patients and methods
Patients
Patients with HCC who were hospitalized to
undergo scheduled hepatectomy in the
Department of Hepatobiliary Surgery,
Third Xiangya Hospital, Central South
University, Hunan, China, between
January 2010 and December 2011, were
randomly selected for inclusion in the
study, using a computer-based randomiza-
tion system. All patients were infected with
hepatitis B and had not received any treat-
ment before the operation. HCC was patho-
logically confirmed after the hepatectomy.
Healthy age-matched volunteers (who did
not present with a medical history of hepa-
titis B or any tumourtypes) were used as
negative controls; suitable individuals were
recruited from those who attended a health
check-up at the Physical Health
Examination Centre of Central South
University, Hunan, China.
Study protocols were approved by the
Institutional Review Board at Central
South University, Changsha, China, and
all participants provided written
informed consent prior to participation.
Participant examinations were conducted
in the Department of Hepatobiliary
Surgery, Third Xiangya Hospital,
Changsha, China.
Hepatectomy procedure
All patients underwent hepatectomy accord-
ing to standard practice; block of the first
hepatic portal vein was performed as neces-
sary during the procedure.18 Tumour size
was measured by computed tomography
(Aquilon; Toshiba Medical Systems,
Tokyo, Japan) before the hepatectomy.
Blood loss during surgery was measured by
the attending anaesthesiologist and con-
sisted of a combination of blood accumula-
tion in the suction device and that weighed
from surgical sponges.

Blood samples and RNA extraction
Venous blood samples from patients with
HCC were collected preoperatively during a
clinic visit, and on day s1 and 7 postopera-
tion, when patients were still hospitalized.
Samples were taken after overnight fasting
(>12 h) and analysed 3 h after the sam-
pling. Two ml of venous blood was with-
drawn from each participant, using 1%
heparin as the anticoagulant, and stored at
4C before use. Samples were centrifuged for
5 min at 800 g at 4C. The upper fraction of
the plasma was obtained and total RNA was
extracted from 100 ml of plasma using
TRIzolÕ Reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad,
CA, USA); isopropanol was used as precipi-
tate and finally the RNA was dissolved in
20 ml of distilled water.
Quantitative RT and PCR
TaqManÕ MicroRNA Assays (ABI
PRISM, Carlsbad, CA, USA) were used to
evaluate mature miR-122 expression levels.
For the reverse transcription (RT) reactions,
10 ng of total RNA was used in each reac-
tion and mixed with the RT primer as
previously described.19 RT reactions were
performed at 16C for 30 min, 42C for
30 min, 85C for 5 min and then maintained
at 4C. Following the RT reactions, 1.5 ml of
cDNA was used for a polymerase chain
reaction (PCR) using 2 ml of the TaqMan
primers. The quantitative RT­PCR cycling
programme involved preliminary denatur-
ation at 94C for 2 min followed by 1 cycle
of denaturation at 94C for 20 s, 60C for
30 s and 35 cycles of annealing at 72C for
30 s, followed by a final elongation step at
72C for 10 min, in an ABI 7500 real-time
PCR system (ABI PRISM). The real-time
PCR results were analysed and expressed as
the relative miRNA level using U6 snRNA
for normalization purposes. The RT and
PCR primers for miR-122 were purchased
from ABI PRISM. Furthermore, U6
snRNA was used as the internal control,
and the miRNA-122 expression was
obtained using the 2ÀÁÁCT assay, as previ-
ously described.20
Laboratory measurements
For the miR-122 evaluation, laboratory
measurements were conducted on the
blood samples that were collected from
patients preoperatively, and from controls.
Total bilirubin in the blood samples was
measured by an enzymatic assay using an
ADVIA 1650 analyser (Bayer Diagnostics,
Tarrytown, NY, USA). For determination
of ALT activity, the reference method
defined by the International Federation of
Clinical Chemistry with pyridoxal phos-
phate was used and calibrated, as previously
described.21,22
Statistical analyses
Data were expressed as mean Æ SD (all SDs
were <5%) of three experiments. All statis-
tical analyses were performed using the
SPSSÕ statistical package, version 18.0
(SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) for
WindowsÕ. Statistical comparisons between
the groups were undertaken using Student's
t-test; Pearson's correlation coefficient was
used to calculate the correlation between
groups. A P-value <0.05 was considered to
be statistically significant.
Results
Eighty patients with HCC and 80 control
subjects were included in the study. The
mean (ÆSD) age of patients was 51.2 Æ 13.7
years and 68 (85.0%) were male. At baseline,
expression of miR-122 and ALT in patients
with HCC was significantly higher than in
the control group (P < 0.05) (Table 1). The
correlation coefficient (R) of miR-122 and
ALT in patients with HCC was 0.842
(P < 0.01)l the R for miR-122 and ALT in
the control group was 0.949 (P < 0.01).

Expression of ALT and bilirubin
increased in patients with HCC on day 1
postoperation, when the highest miR-122
expression was also observed. These three
indices returned to preoperative levels
$7 days postoperation (Table 2). The R
for miR-122 and ALT in patients with HCC
on days 1 and 7 postoperation were 0.793
(P < 0.001) and 0.869 (P < 0.001), respect-
ively. The R for miR-122 and bilirubin in
patients with HCC before surgery and on
days 1 and 7 postoperation were 0.742
(P < 0.01), 0.873 (P < 0.001) and 0.903
(P < 0.05), respectively.
In the subgroup of patients with HCC
who received a block of the first hepatic
portal during hepatectomy, plasma miR-122
expression on day 1 postoperation was
significantly increased, compared with in
patients who did not have this block
(P < 0.02). Patients with excised tumours
>5 cm in diameter also had significantly
increased plasma miR-122 expression, com-
pared with those with smaller excised
tumours (P < 0.003) on Day 1 postopera-
tion. However, plasma miR-122 expression
was not related to clinicopathological char-
acteristics including age, sex or level of
intraoperative haemorrhage (Table 3).
Discussion
The MiRNAs are extensively involved in
multiple pathological and physiological pro-
cesses,23,24 and their up-regulation and
down-regulation influence the progression
of disease development. Four miRNAs were
found to be significantly up-regulated and
three miRNAs were significantly down-
regulated in tissue samples from patients
with early recurrent HCC.25,26 MiR-122 is
highly expressed in liver, and accounts for
>70% of total miRNAs. Additionally, miR-
122 expression in liver is at least 1 000 times
greater than in other tissues: miR-122
expression in other tissues is so low that it
cannot be detected. MiR-122 is character-
ized by high tissue specificity, and it is an
important regulatory factor in the liver.27
At present, ALT is used as a serological
marker that correlates with clinical liver
injury. However, numerous extrahepatic
conditions can increase ALT levels

(including burns, myositis, hypothyroidism
and myopathy). Hence, increases in ALT
levels are not specific to liver injury and it is
therefore not a suitable marker of such
injury.28 It has been reported that miRNA
in tumour cells is released into blood using a
specific mechanism.29 Previously, it was
believed that RNA was not stable in per-
ipheral blood and that RNA was easily
degraded by RNase,30 therefore, it was
difficult to detect the RNA in blood.31
However, miRNA has now been found to
maintain its stability well in peripheral
blood32­34 and hence, peripheral miRNA
has been used for the diagnosis and prog-
nosis of tumours.35 MiRNA is specifically
expressed in liver cells; therefore, cellular
miR-122 may be released into the blood
after liver injury. Additionally, peripheral
miR-122 expression may reflect the degree of
liver injury. Zhang et al.17 showed that ALT
and miR-122 levels in the plasma of patients
with chronic hepatitis B were higher than
such levels in healthy volunteers. Hence,
they deemed that miR-122 was a useful
biomarker for the evaluation of hepatitis B
virus-induced liver injury. However, the
mechanism involved in the transportation
and release of miR-122 is still not clear. In
the present study, we found that preopera-
tive miR-122 and ALT levels in the plasma
of patients with HCC before were signifi-
cantly higher than those in healthy controls,
and that miR-122 expression was positively
correlated with ALT levels.
Data from the present study are consist-
ent with the results of Zhang et al.,17 and this
may be because HCC is commonly accom-
panied by chronic hepatitis B-induced liver
injury. Additionally, miR-122 in the cyto-
plasm of HCC cells may be released into the
blood, and a synergistic action may occur.36
Hence, detection of plasma miR-122 expres-
sion preoperatively could be used to com-
plement the ALT assay for the evaluation of
liver injury. Furthermore, the present study

showed that ALT and bilirubin expression
increased in patients with HCC on day 1
postoperation, when the highest miR-122
expression was also observed. These three
indices returned to normal levels 7 days
postoperation. The change in plasma miR-
122 was similar to ALT and bilirubin. In
addition, miR-122 expression was positively
correlated with ALT and bilirubin expres-
sion (R > 0.7). Hence, these data primarily
showed that plasma miR-122 may be a novel
biomarker for liver injury induced by
hepatectomy.
The present study also analysed the rela-
tionship between plasma miR-122 and clin-
icopathological indices of patients 1 day
postoperation, and suggested that plasma
miR-122 expression was not associated with
age, sex or extent of intraoperative haemor-
rhage. However, its expression was asso-
ciated with first hepatic portal control and
excised tumour size: receiving first hepatic
portal control and having a large excised
tumour (>5 cm) induced an increase in
plasma miR-122 expression. This may be
due to liver cells being injured due to hypoxia
after occlusion of hepatic blood flow, and a
large excised tumour size means that a large
liver section had to be removed, causing
more extensive liver injury than would be
seen with smaller excisions. However, a
larger sample quantity than that studied in
the present analysis is needed to further
study the mechanisms involved.
The approach presented in our paper has
been already proposed for monitoring drug-
and viral-induced liver damage, but it
should be considered with some caution.
Specifically, the 2ÀÁÁCT assay method is
widely used to compare control and treated
samples, but it is reliable only if the house-
keeping RNA levels (in this case U6) are
constant and are not modified by the treat-
ment. Future research could involve a
standard-curve method, in addition to the
2ÀÁÁCT method, although this is a more
technically challenging approach.
The present study findings indicate the
potential value of miR-122 expression in
patients with HCC, but it should be noted
that this test method is currently more
expensive compared with other techniques.
It is feasible, therefore, that where only
standard serological testing is available,
severity of liver damage and post-surgery
prognosis could be indicated by raised ALT
and bilirubin levels, particularly in those
with occluded hepatic blood flow and larger
excised tumours. However, miR-122 expres-
sion is of value because of its good repeat-
ability, sensitivity and specificity.
To conclude, the present study primarily
suggested that plasma miR-122 expression
in patients with HCC was related to ALT
and bilirubin levels, and that hepatic blood
flow occlusion and large excised tumour size
increased miR-122 expression. MiR-122
may be used as a novel serological marker
to evaluate liver injury induced by
hepatectomy.
