Abstract
Team-based care is a foundation of health care redesign models like the patient-centered medical home (PCMH). Yet few
practices rigorously examine how the implementation of PCMH relates to teamwork. We identified factors associated with
the perception of a practice operating as a real team. An online workforce survey was conducted with all staff of 12 primary
care sites of Cambridge Health Alliance at different stages of PCMH transformation. Bivariate and multivariate analyses
of factors associated with teamwork perceptions were conducted. In multivariate models, having effective leadership was
the main factor associated with practice teamwork perceptions (odds ratio [OR], 10.49; 95% confidence interval [CI],
5.39-20.43); in addition, practicing at a site in an intermediate stage of PCMH transformation was also associated with
enhanced team perceptions (OR, 2.44; 95% CI, 1.28-4.64). In a model excluding effective leadership, respondents at sites in
an intermediate stage of PCMH transformation (OR, 1.95; 95% CI, 1.1-3.4) and who had higher care team behaviors (such
as huddles and weekly meetings; OR, 3.41; 95% CI, 1.30-8.92), higher care team perceptions (OR, 2.65; 95% CI, 1.15-6.11),
and higher job satisfaction (OR, 2.00; 95% CI, 1.02-3.92) had higher practice teamwork perceptions. This study highlights the
strong association between effective leadership, care team behaviors and perceptions, and job satisfaction with perceptions
that practices operate as real teams. Although we cannot infer causality with these cross-sectional data, this study raises the
possibility that providing attention to these factors may be important in augmenting practice teamwork perceptions.

Introduction
Fueled by the recognition that managing health care costs
and population health requires redistribution of primary care
clinicians' work among teams of individuals, thousands of
primary care sites are transforming to patient-centered medi-
cal homes (PCMHs). To provide the recommended acute,
chronic, and preventive care for panels of 2500 patients, pri-
mary care physicians would need to spend 21.7 hours daily,
which they cannot.1-4 It is estimated that half of the tasks that
primary care physicians currently do can be completed by
other team members.5 Thus, central to PCMH transformation
is the development of high-functioning practice-based teams.
Understanding primary care teams is essential given evi-
dence that high-functioning teams and PCMHs support
achievement of the quadruple aim6 of enhanced patient
experience,7,8 improved population health,9 reduced costs,7,10,11
and improved joy in work. Yet, most practices do not mea-
sure associations with high-functioning teams.7,12,13 Of
concern is that teams, poorly implemented, can potentially

decrease work satisfaction. Indeed, PCMH implementation
is associated with increased physician burnout in some
cases.14 It is imperative, therefore, to identify factors associ-
ated with primary care teams.
Studies of health care teams have identified factors asso-
ciated with high-functioning teams, including care team
behaviors (such as huddles)15 and effective leadership.16
However, these factors were identified through qualitative
methods and do not allow examination of the association
between these factors and perceptions of practices operating
as real teams. As primary care sites transform to team-based
care, they will benefit from understanding elements associ-
ated with perceptions of practices operating as real teams.
The objective of this study was to identify factors associ-
ated with the perception of a practice operating as a real team
in a health care setting. We examined the relationship
between the perception that practice operates as a real team
and other key factors identified in literature as being associ-
ated with teams, including effective leadership, care team
supportive structures, care team behaviors, and job satisfac-
tion and burnout.15,16
Methods
Setting
Cambridge Health Alliance (CHA), an integrated delivery
and public health system, cares for 140
000 people in
Eastern Massachusetts. CHA serves low-income, racially,
ethnically, and linguistically diverse populations; 82% of
its revenues come from public funding sources, its patients
are 65% nonwhite, and 30% primarily speak a non-English
language. In 2009, CHA began transforming its 12 primary
care practices to PCMHs. In groups of 2 to 3, these prac-
tices entered into national and state learning PCMH col-
laboratives. The central administration at CHA selected
which sites and when they should join these collaboratives,
and provided central support to sites to help them through
the process of transformation. Throughout the process, the
central administration at CHA placed a strong emphasis on
teams and team-based care. At the time of this study, 2 sites
were considered advanced PCMHs based on years spent in
transformation (>2 years, received National Committee for
Quality Assurance [NCQA] level 3 PCMH recognition in
2010), 4 were intermediate (0-2 years), and 4 were early
(had yet to begin).
Survey Development
We developed an online 55-item survey with questions
drawn from validated instruments, including the Dartmouth
Teamwork Survey17 and the Safety Net Medical Home
Initiative Workforce Survey,14 as well as questions modified
from other surveys (such as the National Health Service
Innovation Survey18). Domains included (1) practice
teamwork perceptions, (2) care team behaviors (eg, huddle
frequency) and care team perceptions (eg, care team operates
as real team), (3) perception of job satisfaction and burnout,
and (4) perceptions of effective leadership (please see appen-
dix for source of items). Practice teamwork perceptions
inquired about perceptions of the practice operating as a real
team; practices are commonly understood to be particular
clinical site. Within practices, participants worked on inter-
disciplinary care teams with a subset of providers, medical
assistant, nurses, and patient access representatives. Thus,
care team behavior and perceptions questions addressed the
frequency of particular behaviors and participants' percep-
tions of those care teams. Perceptions of effective leadership
were assessed by agreement with the statement "Leadership
creates an environment where things can be accomplished,"
a question used in the Safety Net Medical Home Initiative
Workforce Survey.14 Responses generally included Likert
scales ranging from "strongly agree" to "strongly disagree."
We pilot tested the survey with 2 sites. The study was
approved by the CHA institutional review board.
Data Collection
We sent the anonymous and voluntary online survey to all
609 staff members at 12 primary care sites 3 times via e-mail
between January and April 2012.
Variables
Practice teamwork perceptions. The primary outcome, team-
work perception, was derived from agreement to the state-
ment "People in the practice operate as a real team."
Responses were dichotomized into high (agree or strongly
agree) and low practice teamwork perceptions (strongly dis-
agree, disagree, neither disagree nor agree).
Care team behavior and care team perception scale scores.We
constructed a care team behavior scale score from 4 ques-
tions assessing the frequency of care team behaviors in a
given month including the number of times a team talked
about high-risk patients, planned care patients, and how to
improve the practice, as well as huddling. We assigned the
following number of points per response: 1: less than once
per month, 2: once per month, 3: several times per month, 4:
once a week, 5: several times a week, and 6: daily or more
often. We calculated average responses and dichotomized
responses into higher (4 points, representing the upper 15%
of respondents) and lower (<4 points, representing the lower
85% of respondents) care team behavior categories.
We constructed a care team perception scale score from
5 questions asking respondents how much they agreed with
the following statements: "People in my care team operate
as a real team"; "When we experience a problem in my care
team, we make a serious effort to figure out what's really
going on"; "Candid and open communication exists
Stout et al 3
between physicians and other practice staff on my care
team"; "I know what the priority goals are in my team"; and
"Employees in my care team report a strong sense of con-
nection to their work." We assigned the following number
of points per response: 1: strongly disagree, 2: disagree, 3:
neither agree nor disagree, 4: agree, and 5: strongly agree.
We calculated average response across the items and
dichotomized responses into higher (4.75 points, repre-
senting the upper 15% of respondents) and lower (<4.75
points, representing the lower 85% of respondents) care
team perception categories.
For both scales, we dichotomized the responses for ease
of interpretation, and to ensure sufficient sample sizes in
each group. We selected the particular cutoffs to ensure
meaningful high groups. For example, because most of the
care team behaviors are more appropriately completed more
than several times per month, we set the cutoff at this point
to create a meaningful high category. Internal consistency of
scale scores was high (Cronbach alpha values of 0.79 for
care team behaviors and 0.90 for care team perception).
Other variables.Other independent variables included job
satisfaction, length of employment at CHA, symptoms of job
burnout, and effective leadership. Those agreeing or strongly
agreeing with the statement "Overall, I am satisfied with my
current job" were considered to have high job satisfaction.
Respondents agreeing or strongly agreeing with the state-
ment "Leadership in the practice creates an environment
where things can be accomplished" were considered to have
effective leadership. Respondents were categorized as hav-
ing no symptoms of burnout, mild burnout (1 symptom), or
severe burnout (symptoms that would not go away or feeling
completely burned out). Respondents' primary roles were
collapsed into the following categories: provider (primary
care MD/NP/PA, OB/Gyn, mental health LICSW/MD/PhD/
other, specialist, resident), administrator, clinical RN, front
desk/reception, medical assistant, and other patient care
(navigator, nutritionist, etc).
Site-specific measures included stage of PCMH transfor-
mation (advanced, intermediate, or early), total primary care
panel size, and proportion of patients >65 years old.
Data Analysis
We conducted bivariate analyses comparing respondents'
practice teamwork perception (high vs low) using chi-
square or independent samples t tests. Because we sought
to understand the relationship of care team behaviors and
perceptions with practice teamwork perceptions, we lim-
ited our analysis to those participants who reported they
were on a care team. To better understand the independent
relationship between practice teamwork perception and
other variables, we conducted multivariable logistic regres-
sion analyses. We excluded respondents due to missing data
on 1 or more variables in both models (N = 12). We also
conducted secondary analyses excluding effective leader-
ship to better understand other factors associated with team
perception. All analyses were conducted using SAS 9.4
(SAS Institute, Cary, North Carolina). P values <.05 were
considered to be statistically significant.
Results
Surveys were completed by 428 employees (70% response
rate). We excluded participants reporting they were not on a
care team (n = 72), who did not answer the question on care
team (n = 26), or who did not answer the primary outcome
question (n = 33), yielding a final sample size of 297 (see
Table 1). Nonresponders and responders who were excluded
because they reported they were not on a care team were
found across all stages of PCMH transition. Participants not
answering the primary outcome question did not differ from
participants answering the question on the basis of role, ten-
ure, site-specific measures, satisfaction, burnout, and care
team perceptions but were more likely to have higher care
team behaviors (12% vs 2%, P = .003)
Respondents held various roles with 41% providers, 16%
clinical RNs, 20% medical assistants, and 22% other (front
desk/reception, administrators, and other). In all, 44% were
from sites at an early stage of PCMH transformation, whereas
39% were at an intermediate and 18% were at an advanced

stage of PCMH transformation. The majority (61%) had
worked at CHA for >5 years. In all, 71% reported high job
satisfaction and 59% indicated no symptoms of burnout. In
all, 62% reported having effective leadership.
Factors Associated With Practice Teamwork
Perception
Overall, 56% of respondents reported high and 46% reported
low practice teamwork perceptions (Table 2). In bivariate
analyses (Table 3), stage of PCMH transformation, job satis-
faction, symptoms of burnout, care team behaviors, care
team perception, and effective leadership were associated
with practice teamwork perceptions. Among those practicing
at early PCMH transformation stage sites, 46% had high
practice teamwork perceptions, as compared with 54%
among those practicing advanced PCMH transformation
stage sites (P = .004). Among those with high job satisfac-
tion, 63% had high practice teamwork perceptions as com-
pared with 37% of those with low job satisfaction (P =
.0002).
The distribution of practice teamwork perception differed
by level of burnout (P = .039); high practice teamwork per-
ceptions were reported by 59% of those with no symptoms of
burnout and 33% of those with severe symptoms of burnout.
In all, 77% of those with effective leadership had higher
practice teamwork perceptions, whereas only 24% of those
without effective leadership had higher practice teamwork
perceptions (P < .0001). Respondents with higher care team
behaviors were more likely (82%) to report high practice
teamwork perceptions as compared with those with low care
team behaviors (53%; P = .0008). Similarly, those with
higher care team perceptions (78%) were more likely to
report high practice teamwork perceptions as compared with
those with low care team perceptions (52%, P = .002).
In multivariate analyses (Table 4), effective leadership
was the main factor associated with high practice teamwork
perception (model 1). Those reporting effective leadership
were 10 times as likely to have high practice teamwork per-
ception compared with those without effective leadership
(odds ratio [OR], 10.49; 95% confidence interval [CI], 5.39-
20.43). Working intermediate PCMH transformation stage
sites (as compared with early stage; OR, 2.44; 95% CI, 1.28-
4.64) was the only other factor associated high practice
teamwork perception. While no other variables achieved sta-
tistical significance, the ORs for higher care team behaviors
and higher care team perception were greater than 2.0, sug-
gesting that these factors contributed to practice teamwork
perceptions.
Given the strength of effective leadership, we conducted
secondary analyses excluding leadership to identify other
factors influencing team-based perceptions (model 2). In
model 2, respondents with higher care team behaviors (OR,
3.41; 95% CI, 1.30-8.92), higher care team perceptions (OR,
2.65; 95% CI, 1.15-6.11), and high job satisfaction (OR,
2.00; 95% CI, 1.02-3.92) were more likely to report higher
practice teamwork perceptions. In addition, respondents
intermediate PCMH transformation stage sites (OR, 1.95;
95% CI, 1.1-3.4) had higher practice teamwork perceptions;
although participants at advanced PCMH transformation
stage sites were more likely to have higher practice team-
work perceptions than early sites, this did not reach statisti-
cal significance (OR, 1.73; 95% CI, 0.75-3.97).
Discussion
In our sample of primary care staff on care teams at 12 prac-
tices of a public safety net institution, effective leadership
was the key factor associated with high practice teamwork
perceptions; respondents who reported having effective lead-
ership were 10 times as likely to have high practice team-
work perceptions. Another key factor was stage of PCMH
transformation; respondents at intermediate PCMH transfor-
mation stage sites were more than twice as likely to report
high practice teamwork perceptions than those in early
stages. In models excluding effective leadership, working at
intermediate PCMH transformation stage sites, having high
care team behaviors, high care team perceptions, and high
job satisfaction were associated with high practice teamwork
perceptions; for each of these, respondents were 2 to 3 times
as likely to have high practice teamwork perceptions.
While the importance of leadership engagement in PCMH
transformation has previously been examined qualitatively,16
this is the first time that the strong association between effec-
tive leadership and practice teamwork perceptions has been
demonstrated in a health care setting. This finding may pro-
vide further evidence for the concept that coaching leaders

on how to support teams is a critical strategy for the emer-
gence of a team-based model of care. Alternatively, it may
suggest that when practice teamwork exists, leaders may
then be able to facilitate operations more effectively.
At the same time, our finding that staff who reported
high care team behaviors (such as huddles) and care team
perceptions had higher practice teamwork perceptions
points to these factors as potential enabling factors of team
development. While the cross-sectional nature of this study
does not allow assessment of whether care team behaviors
and perceptions lead to practice teamwork perception or
vice versa, the association nonetheless provides insight
into areas of focus for team building. That is, fostering care
team behaviors, encouraging care teams operating as a real
team, and fostering practice teamwork perceptions are
interrelated; processes to encourage one aspect (eg, care
team behaviors) may support others (eg, practice team-
work perceptions).
Our finding that PCMH transformation stage was associ-
ated with practice teamwork perceptions adds to the PCMH
development literature. A key goal of PCMHs is to develop
team-based care. While substantial efforts have centered on
the impact of PCMHs on quality, costs, and patient experi-
ence,7-12 fewer resources are dedicated to examining and

monitoring team functioning in PCMHs, a key intermediary
step. In our study, intermediate PCMH transformation stage
was significantly associated with higher practice teamwork
perceptions; while participants at advanced PCMH transfor-
mation stage sites had higher practice teamwork perceptions,
the lack of significance for this factor may be due to the
smaller number (n = 52). Thus, our finding may suggest that
the current wave toward PCMH transformation may lead to
higher practice teamwork perceptions.Alternatively, because
team formation is an early step of PCMH transformation, it
may be that practices at the intermediate and advanced stages
were at equivalent levels of team formation.
The significant association between higher practice team-
work perceptions and higher job satisfaction needs to be
underscored in the context of the current primary care work-
force crisis. The creation of PCMH teams in health care has
been associated with greater job satisfaction in some but not
all settings.19,20 However, the elements of PCMHs that are
associated with increased job satisfaction have not yet been
elucidated. This study adds to the literature by raising the
possibility that structures enabling high practice teamwork
perceptions may help foster increased job satisfaction. An
alternative interpretation is that higher job satisfaction may
be a prerequisite for practices to then operate as real teams.

Creating and maintaining effective practice teams
requires resources. This study adds to the growing litera-
ture21-23 highlighting the need for primary care redesign
models and payment methods to account for enabling team
activities, such as huddles and team meetings, to achieve
effective practice teamwork. While other enabling struc-
tures such as collocation and coscheduling may also pro-
mote team effectiveness, further evaluation of the
relationship between these elements and team effectiveness
is required. In fact, rigorous measurement and monitoring
of team effectiveness and enabling structures, as well as
rigorous application of improvement frameworks, may be a
core metric of primary care transformation.
The current political climate, with the uncertainly about
the future of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), raises concerns
for safety net hospitals. While further research is needed, this
study raises the possibility that focusing on effective leader-
ship and PCMH transformation may lead to high practice
teamwork perceptions. Because team-based care has been
associated with improved patient experience,7,8 improved
population health,9 and reduced costs,7,10,11 focus on these
factors may help improve these outcomes, many of which
safety net hospitals strive to achieve.
This study should be interpreted in the context of several
limitations. It was conducted at 12 primary care practices of
a single institution, and therefore, findings may not be gener-
alizable to other settings. In addition, the primary care sites
were not randomly assigned to PCMH development; thus,
the "early sites" likely have nonmeasured variables that the
organization thought would increase the odds of success at
PCMH. The associations are derived from cross-sectional
data, and causality cannot be inferred. Due to the complexity
of objectively measuring team performance,24,25 as other
studies of team functioning have done,26,27 we examined the
subjective measure of practice teamwork perception. While
our measures of care team behaviors and perceptions had
good internal consistency, we lack other measures of validity
and reliability of these measures (such as test-retest).
Similarly, due to the anonymous nature of the survey and our
resulting lack of information on team membership, we were
unable to assess interrater agreement on the care team mea-
sures. For some respondents, the substitution principle and
halo effects may have led to high levels of correlations
among items. That is, if a respondent encountered a question
that was hard to answer quickly, they may have replaced that
question with one that was easier to answer (substitution
principle).28 At the same time, the strong emphasis placed by
the central administration on teams and team-based care
raises the possibility of a halo effect. The halo effect suggests
that when we rate individuals, and likely teams and institu-
tions, we often do this globally and generally with the halo of
some overall feeling about the object of the questions.29 Our
examination of practice teamwork perceptions and effective
leadership were single questions, which may limit their reli-
ability and validity.
Concluding Comments
This study highlights the strong association between effec-
tive leadership, PCMH transformation, care team behaviors
and perceptions, and job satisfaction with perceptions that
practices operate as real teams. It may therefore suggest that
attention to supporting and monitoring these structures may
be critical for team development, or that facilitating practices
operating as real teams may lead to some of these elements.
For example, as primary care systems transform to team-
based models of care, providing resources for and focusing
on the development of effective leadership and enabling
team structures may augment practice teamwork perception,
a critical element of high-functioning team development.
