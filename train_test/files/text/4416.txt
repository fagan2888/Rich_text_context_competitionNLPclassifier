Abstract
Objectives: To examine the association between glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) and fatty
liver markers.
Methods: This cross-sectional analysis stratified subjects into quintiles based on HbA1c. Fatty
liver using ultrasonography scores (FLUS) were assigned as follows: 2 points, moderate or severe
fatty liver; 1 point, mild fatty liver; and 0 points, normal liver. Subjects with viral hepatitis, alcohol
intake >175 g/week or receiving hypoglycaemic treatment were excluded.
Results: The study included 5384 subjects. Serum cholinesterase (ChE) and FLUS showed a
significant graded increase with increasing HbA1c. In linear regression analysis stratified by body
mass index (BMI) and age, ChE and FLUS were significantly associated with lower (1 þ 2) and
higher (3 þ 4 þ 5) HbA1c quintiles, respectively, independent of BMI and age.
Conclusions: The findings show that both ChE and FLUS are significantly correlated with HbA1c,
independent of BMI and age.

Introduction
The metabolic syndrome is known to cause
atherosclerosis, and is defined as central
obesity (indicated by waist circumference)
plus any two of the following factors:
elevated triglycerides, reduced high-
density-lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C),
elevated blood pressure and elevated fasting
plasma glucose.1 The metabolic syndrome is
associated with non-alcoholic fatty liver
disease (NAFLD)2 and is correlated with
serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) con-
centration in a dose-dependent manner
(within the reference range),3 suggesting
that NAFLD and ALT concentration can
be used in tandem to identify at-risk sub-
jects.4 Elevated aminotransferases are also
independently associated with the metabolic
syndrome in patients with diabetes who have
no ultrasonographic evidence of fatty liver.5
Since insulin resistance is a key mechanism
of NAFLD, the metabolic syndrome and
glycaemic disorder,6 NAFLD is also inde-
pendently associated with HbA1c concen-
tration in non-diabetic individuals.7 The
FIN-D2D survey reported in 2010 that the
prevalence of the metabolic syndrome and
type 2 diabetes are significantly increased in
subjects with NAFLD compared with those
with normal liver function tests.8
It is likely that NAFLD is associated with
both the metabolic syndrome and glycaemic
disorder (as indicated by HbA1c), but ultra-
sonographic findings and ALT concentra-
tions may not be definitive markers of fatty
liver in all individuals. Serum cholinesterase
(ChE) concentration is increased in patients
with fatty liver, but few studies have inves-
tigated the direct association between gly-
caemic disorder and ChE and other markers
of fatty liver. A single, small-scale study
found that ChE concentrations were higher
in patients with non-alcoholic steatohepati-
tis (NASH), which was also associated with
diabetes.9
The aim of this preliminary study, there-
fore, was to examine the hypothesis that
fatty liver (diagnosed via ultrasonography)
and ChE are associated with HbA1c.
Subject and methods
Study population
This cross-sectional retrospective analysis
included workers or retirees aged between
19 and 90 years who were undergoing an
annual medical check-up as part of the
healthcare system at Jikei University
Hospital Health Care Centre, Tokyo,
Japan between January 2006 and
December 2006. Exclusion criteria were:
(i) treatment with hypoglycaemic agents;
(ii) hepatitis B surface antigen positive; (iii)
hepatitis C antibody positive; and (iv) etha-
nol intake >175 g/week.
All participants provided written
informed consent prior to enrolment in the
study. The study was approved by the
Institutional Review Board of Jikei
University School of Medicine and carried
out in accordance with the Declaration of
Helsinki.
Ultrasonography
Experienced technicians, who were unaware
of the aims of the study and blinded to
laboratory findings, evaluated fatty liver via
abdominal ultrasonography. All medical
sonographers were registered with the
Japan Society of Ultrasonics in Medicine
and had been trained at Jikei University
Hospital. Study-specific fatty liver using
Katoh et al. 543
ultrasonography scores (FLUS) were
assigned as follows: 2 points, moderate or
severe fatty liver (deep attenuation, vascular
blurring, a fatty bandless sign and/or a
brighter liver compared with the
spleen10­12); 1 point, mild fatty liver (bright
liver, focal fatty sparing10 and/or high
hepato­renal echo contrast11,13); and 0
points, normal liver.
Data collection
Medical history and lifestyle information
including alcohol consumption and smoking
were documented by a professional nurse.
Subject height and weight were recorded
with subjects dressed in lightweight indoor
clothes, and body mass index (BMI) calcu-
lated as weight/height2 (kg/m2). Waist cir-
cumference while undressed and standing
was measured (to the nearest cm) using a
nonelastic soft tape at the umbilical level
when the navel was between the lowest rib
and the level of the iliac crest, or midway
between the lowest rib and the level of the
iliac crest. Blood pressure (BP) was mea-
sured using a standard mercury manometer
after 5 min rest in a sitting position.
Following the blood pressure measurement,
venous blood specimens (12 ml for serum
and 1.8 ml for plasma) were drawn between
09:00 and 10:30 hours, after an overnight
fast. Plasma and serum were stored at 10­
15C prior to analysis within 4 h.
Laboratory analyses
Fasting plasma glucose (FPG) concentra-
tions were determined using the glucose
oxidase immobilized oxygen electrode
method (GA08III; A&T Corporation,
Kanagawa, Japan).14 HbA1c (NGSP
equivalent value)15 was determined with
high-performance liquid chromatography
(HLC-723G9; Tosoh Corporation, Tokyo,
Japan). Enzymatic methods were used to
analyse serum high-density-lipoprotein
cholesterol (HDL-C) (MetaboLead HDL-
C; Kyowa Medex, Tokyo, Japan), low-
density-lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C)
and triglyceride (TG) (Cholestest LDL and
Cholestest TG, respectively; Sekisui
Medical, Tokyo, Japan), and aspartate ami-
notransferase (AST) and alanine amino-
transferase (ALT) (AST-J2 and ALT-J2,
respectively; Wako Pure Chemical
Industries, Osaka, Japan). Serum ChE and
g-glutamyltransferase (GGT) levels were
determined using a butyrylthiocholine
iodide method and g-glutamyl-3-carboxy-4-
nitroanilide method (both Wako Pure
Chemical Industries, Ltd, Osaka, Japan),
respectively. Serum hepatitis B virus surface
antigen and hepatitis C virus antibody (3rd
generation) were quantified by chemilumin-
escent enzyme immunoassay (CLEIA)
(Architect i2000SR; Abbott Japan, Tokyo,
Japan). Serum C-reactive protein (CRP)
and uric acid were quantified by latex agglu-
tination immunoassay (Iatro CRP-EX,
Mitsubishi Chemical Medicine
Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) and uricase
peroxidase method (Wako Pure Chemical
Industries), respectively. All samples were
analysed in the same laboratory at Jikei
University Hospital.
Statistical analyses
Subjects were stratified into sex-specific
quintile groups by HbA1c concentration
(groups 1/5 to 5/5). The same HbA1c cut-
off points are applied to both men and
women in clinical practice, but subjects were
stratified by sex in the present study in order
to permit analyses of possible sex-specific
differences. Participant characteristics were
presented as mean Æ SD for continuous
variables and proportions (%) for dichot-
omous variables. The association between
HbA1c and all other variables was evaluated
as a trend-test with linear regression models
for continuous variables and logistic regres-
sion models for dichotomous variables.

In addition, the numbers of individuals
evaluated for ChE and FLUS were tested
with the Jonckheere­Terpstra test. Multiple
regression models stratified by BMI and age
were further used to evaluate determinants
of HbA1c. Subjects were stratified according
to median BMI and age for the linear
regression analysis. The analysis was also
performed with stratifications for HbA1c
quintiles in order to test for differences in
associations between those with lower and
those with higher quintiles.
Stata statistical package version 10.1
(StataCorp LP, College Station, Texas,
USA) was used for statistical analysis.
P-values < 0.05 were considered statistically
significant.
Results
The study recruited 7984 subjects (5437
male/2547 female; mean age, 48.8 years;
age range, 19­90 years). A total of 2600
subjects were excluded (receiving hypogly-
caemic agents n ¼ 248; alcohol consumption
>175 g/week n ¼ 2216; hepatitis B positive
n ¼ 51; hepatitis C positive n ¼ 29; missing
HbA1c data n ¼ 56). The final analysis
included 5384 subjects (3173 male/2211
female; mean age, 48.0 years; age range,
19­90 years). A total of 5167 subjects
underwent ultrasonography and were
assigned FLUS scores. Serum ChE levels
were determined in 3973 subjects.
Demographic and clinical characteristics of
the subjects stratified by sex and HbA1c
quintile are given in Tables 1a and 1b.
In both men and women, there was a
significant graded increase in BMI, mean
age and FPG from quintile 1 to quintile 5
(P < 0.001 for each trend; Tables 1a and 1b).
Data regarding the metabolic syndrome
and hepatic function markers are shown in
Tables 1a and 1b. Waist circumference, TG,
and systolic and diastolic BP showed a
significant graded increase, and HDL-C
was significantly decreased from quintile 1
to quintile 5 in both men and women
(P < 0.001 for each trend). In addition,
there were significant graded increases in
AST and ALT from quintile 1 to quintile 5
in both men and women (P < 0.001 for each
trend).
Linear regression analysis of subjects
stratified according to median BMI
(22.3 kg/m2) indicated that FLUS score was
significantly associated with HbA1c inde-
pendent of BMI in the total study popula-
tion (P < 0.001 for each association;
Tables 2a and 2b). The association in
quintiles 3 þ 4 þ 5 combined ( ¼ 0.138,
P < 0.001 and  ¼ 0.144, P < 0.001 for
BMI 22.3 kg/m2 and >22.3 kg/m2, respect-
ively; Tables 2a and 2b) contributed to these
findings. In addition, ChE was also signifi-
cantly associated with HbA1c independent
of BMI in the total study population
(P < 0.001 for each association; Tables 2a
and 2b). In subgroup analysis, the associ-
ation in quintiles 1 þ 2 combined ( ¼ 0.126,
P < 0.001; Table 2a) contributed to the
findings in the total study population, as
well as in subjects with BMI >22.3 kg/m2
(Table 2b).
Results of linear regression analysis of
subjects stratified according to median age
(46 years) are given in Tables 3a and 3b.
HbA1c was significantly associated with
FLUS in all subjects (P < 0.001 for each
association; Tables 3a and 3b). The associ-
ation in quintiles 3 þ 4 þ 5 combined ( ¼
0.258, P < 0.001 and  ¼ 0.114, P ¼ 0.001
for age 46 and >46 years, respectively;
Tables 3a and 3b) contributed to these
findings. HbA1c was also significantly asso-
ciated with ChE in all subjects (P < 0.05;
Tables 3a and 3b). The association in quin-
tiles 1 þ 2 combined ( ¼ 0.107, P ¼ 0.003
and  ¼ 0.149, P ¼ 0.001 for age 46 and
>46 years, respectively; Tables 3a and 3b)
contributed to these findings.
Sequential changes in the value of 
suggested that ChE was correlated more
strongly with HbA1c than FLUS in lower

Discussion
Since the establishment of the concept of
NAFLD and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis
(NASH), the role of fatty liver in metabolic
disease has become of interest. Fatty liver
markers within or slightly above the upper
limit of the normal range have been shown to
be pathogenic, and fatty metamorphosis of
hepatocytes leads to insulin resistance,16­18
with optimum levels of metabolic markers
being below mean values in healthy subjects
in modern developed countries.7,19­22 Fatty
liver markers are not included among the
criteria of the metabolic syndrome, however.
We therefore compared the criteria of
the metabolic syndrome with fatty liver
markers in terms of glycaemic status.
There is a lack of consensus regarding the
ideal marker for glycaemic status, particu-
larly in the postprandial state. Although
elevated FPG increases medical care costs in
patients with impaired fasting glucose,23
post-challenge hyperglycaemia is associated
with death and macrovascular complica-
tions even before the development of overt
diabetes.24 Slightly elevated HbA1c is useful
as it suggests a history of slightly raised
plasma glucose, especially in the postpran-
dial state,25 and this has been found to be
significantly associated with increased mor-
tality even in people without diabetes.26­28
Although HbA1c is an internationally
recognised marker of glycaemic status,29 it
is not included among the criteria for the
metabolic syndrome.
Plasma ChE is a pseudocholinesterase
found primarily in the liver, and it is
increased in patients with fatty liver, neph-
rotic syndrome, Grave's disease and hepa-
tocellular carcinoma.30­33 In the present
study, only two individuals had nephrotic
syndrome and their exclusion did not
influence the results. Patients with overt
and untreated Grave's disease and hepato-
cellular carcinoma were not included in the
annual health check-up, and were therefore
not enrolled in the study cohort. ChE is
known to decrease in patients with hypothy-
roidism, liver cirrhosis, fulminant hepatitis
or sepsis, and those undergoing kidney dia-
lysis or who are pregnant.32,34 Patients with
these conditions were also not included in
the annual health check-up programme.
Elevated ChE was associated with HbA1c
in subjects in quintiles 1 þ 2 in the present
study. This may lead to worsening of HbA1c
status, as indicated by the association
between HbA1c and FLUS points in quin-
tiles 3 þ 4 þ 5.
It has been suggested that biochemical
fatty liver markers be included among the
criteria of the metabolic syndrome,35 but
previous fatty liver indices did not include
ChE.7,36 Elevated ChE was significantly
associated with raised HbA1c in the present
study.
Data from the present study indicate an
increase in ALT from quintile 1 to quintile 5.
ALT is used in the scoring system during
selection of patients for liver biopsy,37 and
for scoring NASH and the risk of incident
diabetes.36,38 Elevated ALT can be used to
predict the onset of type 2 diabetes and the
metabolic syndrome even within the upper
limit of the normal range,19,20 and increased
ALT within the normal range is associated
with cardiovascular risk factors independent
of obesity.21 A Korean study found a direct
association between aminotransferase con-
centration (even within the normal range)
and mortality from liver disease.22
Nevertheless, ChE and FLUS were shown
to be better markers of fatty liver than ALT
in our present study.
Overt NAFLD has been identified as a
risk factor for type 2 diabetes in Japanese
subjects.39 Magnetic resonance imaging is
the most reliable noninvasive imaging
method for assessing intrahepatic
550 Journal of International Medical Research 42(2)
content,40,41 but ultrasonography is the
most commonly available resource and
gives a high degree of certainty during
diagnosis of fatty liver in large cohort
studies.13,42 Quantitative techniques aimed
at evaluation of fatty liver by ultrasonog-
raphy have yet to be established.
Ultrasonography has been used to assess
the presence or absence of fatty liver and to
determine the proportion of subjects with
NAFLD.7 There is a positive correlation
between the degree of fatty changes and an
increase in echogenicity,11 however, and we
therefore attempted to evaluate fatty liver
quantitatively via FLUS. A bright liver,
focal fatty sparing or high hepato­renal
echo contrast indicates mild fatty liver, as
described.10,11,13 Since fatty changes <10­
20% cannot be reliably detected by ultra-
sonography,11 ChE may be a useful marker
in these subjects. Fatty liver diagnosed with
ultrasonography (FLUS) was significantly
associated with raised HbA1c in higher
quintiles in the present study.
A slight elevation in ChE level was
associated with glycaemic status as indicated
by lower HbA1c in the current study (quin-
tiles 1 þ 2), whereas FLUS scores were
important in higher quintiles (3 þ 4 þ 5
combined). This result is in line with the
findings of others,5 and may explain why
there is no study reporting that fatty liver
detected by ultrasonography is generally
associated with the full spectrum of HbA1c.
The present study is limited by the fact
that the data were not sufficient to provide
cause­effect analysis due to its cross-sec-
tional nature. It is not possible to determine
whether higher HbA1c leads to more severe
fatty liver/ChE or whether higher fatty liver
scores/ChE result in higher HbA1c.
Longitudinal studies are required to clarify
this issue. The present study did not include
specific details of antihypertensive drug
treatment. In addition, patients with undiag-
nosed or untreated diabetes may have been
included in our analysis as we did not
perform oral glucose tolerance testing.
Although smoking is a known risk factor
for diabetes,43 smoking (self-reported infor-
mation) was not significantly associated
with HbA1c in the present study. In add-
ition, FLUS and ChE data were not avail-
able for all participants. It is not possible,
therefore, to exclude the possibility that
these issues might impact on our findings.
In conclusion, our study shows that a
slight elevation in plasma ChE is correlated
with lower HbA1c quintile, while FLUS is
important thereafter (independent of BMI
and age). A change in marker from ChE to
FLUS was observed with increasing HbA1c.
Both ChE and FLUS are significantly
correlated with HbA1c level and are there-
fore useful markers, although their contri-
bution may be at different ends of the
HbA1c distribution. These markers may
enable early intervention, which is known
to have a beneficial effect on the improve-
ment of fatty liver.44
