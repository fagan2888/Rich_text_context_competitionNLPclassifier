Background. There is little epidemiologic data on the development of disability overtime in older persons. This study
uses prospective data from cohorts followed annually for 6 to 7 years to identify persons who developed severe disability
and to characterize the time course of their disabling process and subsequent mortality.
Methods. Incidence rates of severe disability, defined as need for help in three or more activities of daily living
(ADLs), were estimated for 6,640 persons who had not reported severe disability at baseline and at the first four annual
follow-up visits. Among persons developing severe disability, those who reported no need for help in ADLs in previous
interviews were defined as cases of catastrophic disability, and those who had previously reported some disability in
ADLs were defined as cases of progressive disability.
Results. Overall. 212 subjects developed progressive and 227 developed catastrophic disability. The rates of progressive
disability and catastrophic disability were 11.3 and 12.1 cases per 1,000 person-years, respectively. For both types of
disability, incidence rates increased exponentially with age, but the increase was steeper for progressive disability. At ages
70-74, less than 25% of severe disability was progressive, while over age 85 progressive disability represented more than
half of severe disability. Incidence rates of total and both types of severe disability were similar in men and women.
Mortality after severe disability onset was extremely high. Survival time was unrelated to age at disability onset and type of
disability but was significantly longer in women than in men (median 3.44 vs 2.12 years; p < .0001).
Conclusion. Tracking the development of disability provides new and important insights into the disability experience
in older men and women that are potentially relevant in planning preventive, intervention, and long-term care strategies.
ALARGE portion of the geriatric literature is dedicated to
studies of disability in the older population. Prevalence
(1,2) and incidence (3-5) rates of disability have been
reported for large samples representative of the general
population. Many predictors of disability have been iden-
tified, including demographic characteristics, specific
chronic conditions, and health behaviors. In most cases,
disability has been considered as a simple, static condition,
whereas the development of disability as an ongoing, dy-
namic process has received little attention (6). For example,
little information is available on gender and age differences
in the course of disability over time. This is an important
issue, since length of the disabling process and survival time
after developing disability are critical elements in assessing
the impact of disability and the need for health and social
services in selected subgroups of the population.
The most important causes of disability in young to
middle-aged persons are congenital or perinatal conditions,
trauma, and acute or rapidly progressive diseases (7). For
almost all of these conditions the typical time course of the
disabling process is rapid, and is assumed to be a sequela of
the underlying cause. Conversely, disability in older age is
often portrayed as the end stage of a progressive breakdown
of the homeostatic equilibrium (8,9) that takes place in
persons affected by multiple diseases (10), although it may
be accelerated by acute medical conditions (8,9,11). The
term "frailty," which has recently been defined in several
ways (12,13), is an attempt to summarize this complex
causal chain in a unique notion (14). However, it is also well
known that some older persons become disabled suddenly,
as a consequence of a catastrophic medical event such as a
stroke, without showing any previous sign of functional
decline. Thus, the time required for severe disability to
develop is quite variable; it likely covers a wide range of
times in the older population, but its distribution is com-
pletely unknown.
Certain aspects of the time course of disability can be
inferred from the results of a limited number of studies
(4,15,16), but the dynamics of the process in itself is not
well understood (6); no research has used data on incident
disability and change in disability status detected longitudi-
nally over multiple evaluations to track the entire process.
This prospective study uses data from a large, population-
based sample of older persons who were assessed annually to
describe the temporal characteristics of the process leading
to severe disability and to understand how these characteris-
tics are related to age, gender, and subsequent mortality. We
hypothesized that rapid disability onset would be more
common in the younger segment of the elderly population
and would be followed by higher mortality rates than disabil-
ity of the same magnitude but with gradual onset.
METHODS
Study Population
This study uses data from three communities of the Estab-

lished Populations for Epidemiologic Studies of the Elderly
(EPESE), a longitudinal study of persons age 65 years and
older, funded by the Epidemiology, Demography, and Bi-
ometry Program of the National Institute on Aging. The
EPESE design and data collection methods have been de-
scribed in detail elsewhere (2,17). Between 1981 and 1983,
a survey was conducted on the entire elderly population
living in East Boston (Massachusetts) and in two Iowa
counties, and on a stratified random sample of the New
Haven (Connecticut) population. More than 10,000 partici-
pants, representing more than 80% of the eligible popula-
tion, were interviewed. Follow-up data from these cohorts
were collected annually by telephone or in-person inter-
views. Seven follow-up interviews were conducted in Iowa
and New Haven. In East Boston the data collection ended
with the sixth follow-up interview.
Information on level of functional disability was collected
by self-report in all interviews. Participants were asked if
they needed help from another person or were unable to
perform each of the following activities of daily living
(ADLs): walking across a small room, bathing, dressing,
eating, transferring from bed to chair, and using the toilet.
Outcome Measures
The first part of the analyses described here focuses on
incidence of severe disability, and the second part on subse-
quent mortality. Subjects were defined as severely disabled
if they reported need for help with or inability to perform
three or more ADLs.
Persons known to be free of severe disability for a period
of four years were followed for two to three additional years
to detect incident cases of severe disability. In total, 7,771
subjects were found alive and reinterviewed at the fourth
annual follow-up, the starting point for identifying incident
cases of severe disability in this study. To define a popula-
tion at risk for developing severe disability, 513 persons who
had reported need for help in three or more ADLs on any
interview between baseline and the fourth follow-up were
excluded from the analysis. Also excluded were 594 subjects
in whom, in any interview, the sum of missing responses to
ADL questions plus the number of items for which the
subjects reported need for help was three or more. These
participants were not included in the study because severe
disability could not be ruled out. Incident cases of severe
disability were identified over the next two (East Boston) or
three (Iowa and New Haven) follow-up interviews. The first
occurrence of severe disability was considered in these
analyses.
Persons developing severe disability anytime after the
fourth follow-up were classified into two groups, according
to their patterns of responses to ADL questions over time. If
a participant reported no need for help in ADLs in the two
interviews prior to the development of severe disability, the
event was defined as catastrophic disability. If a participant
reported any need for help in ADLs in the interview prior to
the development of severe disability, the participant was
classified as having progressive disability. Twenty-four sub-
jects who had reported disability in one ADL two years
before but no need for help in the interview immediately
before the development of severe disability were excluded
from the analysis. Thus, the population considered in this
analysis consists of 6,640 persons.
Subjects who developed severe disability were followed
for mortality through obituaries, interviews with proxies,
and the National Death Index, for up to 5.5 years after the
onset of severe disability.
Data Analysis
Crude incidence rates of total severe disability, progres-
sive severe disability, and catastrophic severe disability are
reported as number of events per 1,000 person-years. In
computing these rates, person-years were calculated as time
between the fourth follow-up interview and the onset of
severe disability, death, loss to follow-up, or the end of the
study period, whichever came first. Cox proportional haz-
ards regression models were used to estimate relative risks
(RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the association
of age and gender with the two different types of severe
disability. When the event considered was progressive dis-
ability, subjects developing catastrophic disability were cen-
sored at disability onset. Likewise, in the analysis of cata-
strophic disability, subjects with progressive disability were
censored. In these analyses, persons were classified in five
age groups (69-74, 75-79, 80-84, 85-89, 90 + ), accord-
ing to their age at the time of the fourth follow-up interview.
A polychotomous logistic regression model with a three-
level outcome was used to compare the relative risks associ-
ated with age and gender of developing progressive disabil-
ity and catastrophic disability versus no disability.
In the survival analysis, which was limited to subjects
who had developed severe disability, person-years were
calculated as time between the onset of severe disability and
death or the end of 1992, whichever came first. Survivorship
was analyzed by the Kaplan-Meier product limit method and
Cox proportional hazard regression models. In these analy-
ses, type of severe disability (progressive and catastrophic),
age at the onset of severe disability (<85 vs 2=85), and
gender were considered as covariates. Time of severe dis-
ability onset was considered as the midpoint between the last
follow-up interview free of severe disability and the inter-
view in which severe disability was first detected. Median
survival time post severe disability onset was estimated
using the Kaplan-Meier product limit method.
All proportional hazard regression models were
community-stratified.
RESULTS
Of the 6,640 persons who were alive and free of severe
disability at the beginning of the observation period, 181,
137, and 121 persons developed severe disability one, two,
and three years later, respectively. Crude incidence rates of
severe disability for the total population, according to age and
gender, and by community, are reported in Table 1. The risk
of developing severe disability during the three-year observa-
tion period was similar in both men and women, and progres-
sively higher in the older age groups. Across the entire age
range, each five-year increase in age was associated with
approximately a doubling of the incidence rate of severe
disability. In the three communities, age-specific incidence
rates of severe disability, stratified by gender, were remark-
PROGRESSIVE AND CATASTROPHIC DISABILITY M125
ably similar (Figure 1). After adjusting for age, gender and
community were not significant predictors of incident severe
disability (women vs men, RR: 1.1 -- 95% CI: 0.8-1.4;
Iowa vs East Boston, RR: 0.7 -- 95% CI: 0.6-1.1; New
Haven vs East Boston, RR: 1.1 -- 95% CI: 0.8-1.6).
In Table 2, progressive and catastrophic severe disability
are considered separately as two mutually exclusive out-
comes. Over the observation period, 212 subjects developed
severe disability after they had reported a lesser degree of
disability in the previous years (progressive disability), and
227 developed severe disability with no previous report of
any need for help with ADLs (catastrophic disability).
Overall incidence rates of progressive and catastrophic
disability were virtually the same (11.3 vs 12.1 per 1,000
person-years, respectively; Table 2). An exponential in-
crease in these two types of disability was seen with increas-
ing age, with the rate of increase steeper for the progressive
disability group. Age-adjusted incidence rates were similar
in men and women.
Table 2 shows the results of two proportional hazard
models which assess the relative risk associated with age and
gender of developing progressive disability vs no disability,
and catastrophic disability vs no disability. Compared with
the reference group (69 to 74 years old), subjects between 75
and 79 years of age were 1.8 times more likely to develop
both progressive and catastrophic disability. After age 80,
relative risks for both types of disability increased with
increasing age, but the increment in the magnitude of the
relative risk at each higher age was larger for progressive
than for catastrophic disability. Compared with the reference
group (69-74 years), those aged 90 years or more had a

relative risk of developing progressive disability three times
higher than the relative risk of developing catastrophic
disability. Women were no more likely than men to develop
either progressive or catastrophic disability.
Among those who developed severe disability, the pro-
portions with progressive and catastrophic disability are
shown for age- and sex-specific subgroups in Figure 2. With
increasing age, progressive disability comprises a larger
proportion of the total disability for both men and women.
To obtain age-specific relative risks of progressive and
catastrophic disability that are directly comparable, we fitted
the same data with a single polychotomous logistic regres-
sion model. The results of this analysis are shown in Figure
3. The age-associated increases in the relative risks for
progressive and catastrophic disability begin to diverge after
80 years of age. In the age groups 85-89 and 90+, the
difference between the two coefficients reached statistical
significance.
To examine the relationship between disability type (pro-
gressive vs catastrophic) and the risk of mortality, we per-
formed subsequent analyses limited to the 439 participants
who developed severe disability. Survivorship of this group
from time of severe disability onset to the end of 1992 was
analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier product limit method and
plotting stepped survival curves stratified by type of disabil-
ity, gender, and two age groups (<85 vs 5=85).
Overall, mortality in this population was extremely high.
For example, more than 80% of those who became severely
disabled between the fourth and the fifth follow-up interview
died within 5 years. This value is likely an underestimate of
the true mortality rate, as persons who both developed severe
disability and died before the next interview could not be
detected and are not included in these analyses.

Figure 2. Proportion of persons with catastrophic and progressive disabil-
ity among those who developed severe disability during the follow-up
period, according to age group and gender (M = Men, W - Women).
The median survival time was unrelated to age at disabil-
ity onset (age <85 vs 85 +: 2.73 and 2.95 years) and was
significantly longer in women than in men (women vs men:
3.44 and 2.12 years; p < .0001) in all those who developed
severe disability.
These relationships are evident through the 5-year follow-
up (Figure 4), with the exception of the 83 younger women
who had developed catastrophic disability. In the first two
years, mortality in this group of women was higher than
mortality in the older women with the same type of disabil-
ity, and closely followed the survival curve for younger
men. However, after the first two years, the mortality rate
declined and the survival curve became similar to that of the
older women.
The independent effects of type of disability, age at onset
of severe disability, and gender on mortality among the
severely disabled were tested using a single Cox propor-
tional hazard regression model. Female gender was signifi-
cantly associated with lower mortality (RR for women vs
men: 0.6; 95% CI: 0.4-0.7). There were no statistically sig-
nificant associations with mortality for age, or for disability
type (RR for progressive vs catastrophic: 1.1; 95% CI: 0.9-
1.4). Figure 5 shows the age-adjusted survival function
obtained from this model stratified by gender and type of
disability. Both the strong gender effect and the lack of a
"type of disability" effect are clearly evident.
DISCUSSION
Most of the literature has approached disability in the
elderly as a static condition rather than as a dynamic process.
This view ignores the fact that, depending on the basic
underlying causes and on other personal and environmental
cofactors, disability may begin abruptly, progress slowly,
remain stable, and may even diminish over time. The aver-
age survival time after disability onset is highly variable, and

it is not clear which factors determine length of survival (18-
21). The onset and progression of disability, and survivor-
ship with disability, delineate the lifetime course of disabil-
ity. Complex and heterogeneous patterns are encountered in
the older population, and treating disability as a simple
outcome may be misleading.
In this study, the time course of disability was constructed
using prospective data, and two main periods in the process of
disablement were distinguished: development of severe dis-
ability, and survival with severe disability. The time at which
an older person reported severe disability above a specific
threshold was used to identify the point of intersection be-
tween these two periods. Finally, we made a distinction
between subjects who developed severe disability in less than
one year and subjects who had developed severe disability
over a longer period, defining their process of disablement as
catastrophic and progressive disability, respectively.
The percent of subjects who developed severe disability as
a catastrophic event was similar to the percent of subjects
who developed severe disability more progressively. Over-
all, older age was associated with increased risk of both
types of disability. However, confirming our hypothesis, the
characteristics of the disabling process were different at
different ages. Among persons who developed severe dis-
ability, onset at later ages was more likely to be associated
with a longer disabling process, and onset at a younger age
was more likely to be associated with freedom from disabil-
ity in ADLs during the previous years. In about 60% of the
cases aged 85 years and older, development of severe dis-
ability was the final stage of a process of functional decline
that had started more than one year before, while in the age
group 69-75 years, less than 25% of those who developed
severe disability reported any disability in ADLs during the
previous year. These results suggest that the development of
severe disability follows different pathways in different age
groups. A plausible interpretation is that younger persons are
less likely to show progressive disability because the effect
of minor pathologic events on functional status is counter-
balanced by compensatory strategies which may be physio-
logical, behavioral, or social (8). In these persons severe
disability is more often the "catastrophic" result of a major
event (i.e., a stroke), or of an event which causes the
breakdown of critical compensatory mechanisms (9). The
same sequence of pathologic events that a younger person
can compensate for may not be "counteracted" by compen-
satory mechanisms in very old persons, due to underlying
frailty (12-14). Consequently, each event is followed by a
significant change in functional status, and disability de-
velops "progressively," step by step. In these subjects the
decline in physical function may be very slow, and signs of
M128 FERRUCCI ET AL.
functional deterioration may be objectively detectable long
before the development of disability in ADLs (22).
The differential characteristics of the developmental
course of disability associated with age may be extremely
relevant in designing and targeting effective preventive strat-
egies in different age groups. In vulnerable older people with
moderate impairments and disabilities, interventions aimed
at slowing down the impending decline in function may be
more effective than primary prevention, in which traditional
risk factors are modified. Indeed, inconsistencies between
studies assessing traditional risk factors in the elderly may be
explained by the presence in the study population of these
subjects (23). In this subset of the older population, decline
in physical function may act as a strong competing risk
factor for multiple outcomes.
This study also found that the time course of the disabling
process was remarkably similar in men and women. There
were no substantial differences between genders in both the
age-specific incidence rates of overall severe disability and
the proportion of persons who developed progressive and
catastrophic disability. This result contrasts with previous
suggestions that decline in health status associated with age
is attributable to different chronic conditions in men and
women. According to this view, progressive and non-life-
threatening chronic conditions more frequently affect
women, while men are more likely to develop atheroscler-
otic cardiovascular disease that manifests clinically as acute
events such as strokes and myocardial infarctions (24).
However, while morbidity may be different in men and
women, Ettinger and colleagues (25) have recently reported
that causes of disability are almost the same in older men and
women.
Overall, after severe disability onset, mortality rates were
very high. More than 80% of those who were followed for at
least five years died during this period. Women with severe
disability had longer survival than men but, surprisingly, age
and characteristics of the disablement process were not
associated with survivorship. Therefore, this study did not
confirm our original hypothesis that the rapid onset of
disability would lead to higher mortality than progressive
onset disability. The findings of similar incidence of severe
disability but longer survival of women with severe disabil-
ity are compatible with a large body of evidence showing
higher prevalence of disability in women compared to men at
ages over 75 years (5,26-28). However, this study adds an
additional perspective to the interpretation of this phenome-
non because it shows very clearly that older women do not
spend more years living with disability because it develops
more slowly and progressively than in men, but that they
survive longer after the onset of severe disability. This
hypothesis has been suggested by other investigators (4,28).
However, there were limitations in their ability to assess this
issue, since they could not estimate time at disability onset
with reasonable precision.
The observed differences in survival between men and
women with severe disability remain to be explained. It is
likely that the underlying causes of disability and the rela-
tionship between disease severity and disability severity may
be different in men and in women. Further research using
these cohorts will assess diseases predicting severe disabil-
ity, and disease occurrence and cause of death after the onset
of severe disability. Further research is also needed to
evaluate whether men systematically underreport disability
as compared to women, so that men reporting disability are
in fact more frail and at higher risk of death.
The lack of an effect of age and type of disability on the
risk of dying in this group of severely disabled older persons
is also of scientific interest. It is important to consider that
the population at risk in this study included subjects aged 69
years and older and that the operational definition of disabil-
ity used here identifies a rather severe state. At this end stage
of the functional spectrum and in this age group, it is quite
possible that differences in age and the path by which
individuals reached their disability state became relatively
inconsequential. The prognosis quoad vitam is probably
more strongly affected by the direct consequences of the
disability itself, such as immobilization, malnutrition, social
isolation, and others. Considering the lack of an age gradient
in mortality risk, it is surprising that a differential mortality
according to gender is still evident in this group.
The high mortality rate in those with disabilities confirms
the results of many other studies (18-21). Mortality rates in
persons with disability in three or more ADLs were compa-
rable or higher than mortality rates reported for patients with
severe medical conditions, such as myocardial infarction,
stroke, hip fracture, and severe septicemia (29-32). How-
ever, it should be pointed out that, even for subjects with
catastrophic disability, the comparison of our results with
data from the literature may be problematic because of age
differences and because those with severe disability repre-
sent the most severe of these clinical events.
The disappearance of the prognostic effect of age for
mortality at this severity of disability is a relatively new
finding. Other reports have found an association between
age and mortality even in disabled subjects (18-21,33).
However, most of these studies used a less severe definition
for disability.
An important strength of this study is that it used annually
collected data from a prospective study on large representa-
tive populations of elderly persons followed for up to seven
years. It thus avoids recall bias that would be present if the
onset of disability were assessed retrospectively. The study
design permitted the characterization of functional status for
four years prior to its baseline, which allowed for the
identification of a large population at risk of incident disabil-
ity. Using subsequent follow-up information on this popula-
tion, we could identify sufficient cases of incident severe
disability to do a meaningful analysis. Furthermore, mortal-
ity data on those persons who developed severe disability
were available for up to 5.5 years. We are not aware of any
other cohort in which these analyses would be possible.
Specific limitations directly related to the design of this
analysis must be considered. Among those at risk of devel-
oping severe disability, we could not identify persons who
developed severe disability and died before the next follow-
up visit. Therefore, both incidence rates of severe disability
and mortality rates of subjects developing severe disability
are likely to be underestimated in this study. Since we did
not have any information on these subjects, we assumed that
they were randomly distributed between those with some
PROGRESSIVE AND CATASTROPHIC DISABILITY M129
previous disability (progressive), and those with no previous
disability (catastrophic). Whether and how much this as-
sumption influenced our results is unknown.
There were 543 subjects who were excluded from the
population at risk because the number of missing values in
the items assessing disability would not allow severe disabil-
ity to be ruled out. Distribution according to age and gender,
disability in ADLs (considering only non-missing items), as
well as survivorship after the fourth follow-up were similar
in this group compared to those in the eligible study popula-
tion. Thus, we have no specific reason to believe that the
results of our study would be different if we included this
group in the study population.
Results of this study are generalizable only to subjects
aged 69 years or older who develop disability in three or
more ADLs over their lifetime. From a public health per-
spective, this is a very important group of the older popula-
tion (34-38). In fact, persons with these characteristics
usually need substantial medical care (35), formal and infor-
mal care in the community (36,39), and are among the most
likely candidates for nursing home admission (40,41).
In conclusion, this research offers a new concept by which
to approach the study of disability. Our understanding of
disability in the older population may be substantially en-
hanced by considering the time course of disability develop-
ment and distinguishing between catastrophic and progres-
sive disability. Approaches to prevention, therapeutic
options, and decisions on the use of long-term care may all
be illuminated by considering the dynamic aspects of the
development of disability, especially as further research
determines the role that modifiable risk factors play in the
disablement process. In this study the analysis was restricted
to the effect of age and gender, basic demographic indica-
tors. However, the difference by age in the time characteris-
tics of the disablement process, and the differential mortality
by gender in those severely disabled, suggest that we have
more to learn about this issue and help us to begin formulat-
ing hypotheses about the processes underlying the develop-
ment of severe disability. Further research is needed to
understand how other demographic and psychosocial char-
acteristics, specific diseases, and other risk factors influence
the course of disability onset.
