Epidemiology of menthol cigarette use in the
United States
Ralph S Caraballo1*, Katherine Asman2
Abstract
Background: Approximately one-fourth of all cigarettes sold in the United States have the descriptor "menthol" on
the cigarette pack. It is important to determine what socio-demographic factors are associated with smoking
menthol cigarettes if indeed these types of cigarettes are related to smoking initiation, higher exposure to smoke
constituents, nicotine dependence, or reduced smoking cessation.
Methods: The National Cancer Institute (NCI) conducted a review of the scientific literature on this topic which we
completed by adding more recently published articles via PubMed. We also conducted further data analyses using
the National Survey on Drug Use and Health, the National Youth Tobacco Survey, the Monitoring the Future
Survey, and the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey to provide up-to-date information on this topic.
Results: Menthol cigarettes are disproportionately smoked by adolescents, blacks/African Americans, adult females,
those living in the Northeast of the United States and those with family incomes lower than $50,000. Based on
self-reports of menthol cigarette use, menthol cigarette use among smokers have increased from 2004 to 2008.
However, no increase was observed during these years for predominantly menthol brands like NewportTM, Kool,TM
and SalemTM, however, this lack of significant trend may be due, at least in part, due to smaller numbers of
smokers of specific brands or sub-brands, which provide estimates which are less precise.
Conclusion: Menthol cigarettes are disproportionately smoked by groups of U.S. cigarette smokers. It is likely that
other disparities in menthol cigarette use exist that we have not covered or have not been studied yet.
Background
There are over a thousand cigarette brands and sub-
brands that are sold in the United States [1]. Cigarette
brands are advertised or described by some specific
characteristics such as been filter or non-filter, by the
length of the cigarette, by its Federal Trade Commission
machine-measured levels of tar, nicotine yield, and car-
bon monoxide, and some brands of cigarettes have the
descriptor "menthol" in the pack [2].
It has been proposed that the anesthetic and cooling
sensation properties of menthol allow smokers of
menthol cigarettes (by menthol cigarettes we mean a
cigarette from a pack with the descriptor "menthol" in
it) to inhale more smoke from each cigarette than smo-
kers of nonmenthol cigarettes (no "menthol" descriptor
in the cigarette pack) [3,4]. It has also been proposed
that smokers of menthol are more nicotine dependent,
and as a consequence, are less likely to quit [5]. It has
been hypothesized that the resulting higher smoke expo-
sure over time may result in higher smoking-related dis-
eases among smokers of menthol cigarettes [5,6]. In the
U.S., menthol brands tend to have higher yields of tar,
nicotine, and CO, however, menthol is present at
reduced levels in many nonmenthol brands [7]. Finally,
it has been proposed that menthol levels in cigarettes
may play an important role in smoking initiation espe-
cially among adolescents, most of whom are underage
[8].
In this article, we used a recent literature review by
The National Cancer Institute (NCI) to determine what
socio-demographic factors are associated with smoking
(e.g., initiation, cessation, exposure to smoke constitu-
ents, nicotine dependence) menthol cigarettes and we
completed it by adding more recently published articles
we identified via PubMed. We also conducted data

analyses with several national data sets to provide up-to-
date information on this topic.
Methods
Because type of cigarettes smoked, including brand pre-
ference, varies by age group [9,10], data on socio-demo-
graphic factors associated with smoking menthol
cigarettes will be presented separately for youth and
adults. A review of the scientific literature on socio-
demographic factors related to smoking menthol cigar-
ettes was provided by the Department of Health and
Human Services' National Cancer Institute (NCI) [11].
For youth, there were nine articles listed in the biblio-
graphy, of which one was conducted in Japan [12]. Of
the eight studies conducted in the U.S., five [13-17] col-
lected data using national samples, two were conducted
in specific communities [18,19], and one study [20] was
qualitative (focus groups) in study design. Four of these
8 U.S. articles presented data from cross-sectional stu-
dies [13,14,17,18], two from a longitudinal study [15,16],
and two from a convenience sample [19,20]. Because
more recent information has been published or available
since the NCI bibliography was provided, additional stu-
dies or reports [8,10,21] are included in the youth sec-
tion in this article. When appropriate, we report results
from these studies in this review article.
For adults, there were 15 articles listed and one letter
to the editor on the bibliography provided by NCI. Ele-
ven of these 15 articles presented data from cross-sec-
tional studies, four presented data from case-control
studies or data were collected using convenience sam-
ples. The most recent study listed [22] reported data
collected in 2002 from a specific U.S. population group
(heroin users) in a specific location. Because of lack of
recent data in the NCI bibliography, other studies and
reports [8,10,23,24] were included in the adult section
to provide more recent information on this topic. Also
when appropriate, we report results from these studies
in this review article.
To provide up-to-date information on this topic, data
analyses were performed using specific data sets such
as the National Survey on Drug Use & Health[25],
hence referred as NSDUH; the National Youth
Tobacco Survey[26], hence referred as NYTS; the Mon-
itoring the Future Survey[27], hence referred as MTFS;
and the National Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey[28], hence referred as NHANES. It is important
to note that the consistent collection of national data
on menthol cigarette use started fairly recently, in the
late 1990's (MTFS) or in the early 2000's (NSDUH,
NYTS, and NHANES). Two-sided t tests were used to
assess differences between population group percen-
tages. For all tests, p<0.05 was considered statistically
significant.
NSDUH
The National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH)
is a nationwide household survey that collects data on
drug use and drug abuse, including tobacco use, from a
representative sample of the U.S. civilian, noninstitutio-
nalized population aged 12 years or older. Specifically,
the NSDUH collects data on overall tobacco use, cigar-
ette smoking, and other behavioral information related
to cigarette smoking and brand preference. NSDUH
data are collected through a computerized questionnaire
administered in the privacy of participants' homes by a
professional field interviewer who visits each selected
household. Most responses are answered in private by
the participant, although the interviewer reads and
enters the responses to some questions in the presence
of the participant. Questions about tobacco use were
administered through audio, computer-assisted, self-
interview methods to maximize privacy and improve
reporting of sensitive behaviors. For our analysis using
these data, we used information for adolescents aged
12-17 years old who smoked in the past month
(N=9,595) and adult smokers (aged 18 years or older)
who smoked in the past month (N=62,010) from the 5
surveys conducted in 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, and 2008
in order to determine prevalence of menthol cigarette
use in the overall population of smokers as well as for
specific subgroups of smokers and to assess trends in
smoking menthol cigarette use among smokers.
NYTS
The NYTS is a nationally representative sample of stu-
dents enrolled in grades 6 through 12. The sampling
universe consists of public and private school students
in the 50 states and the District of Columbia. The sam-
pling frame stratified the 50 states and the District of
Columbia by region and urbanicity. Primary sampling
units (PSUs), are selected with probability proportional
to the student enrollment in the PSU but giving dispro-
portionate weight to Black, Asian, and Hispanic
students.
Schools are grouped by size as either large or small,
depending on whether they have at least 125 students
combined in eligible grades. All students present in a
selected classroom on the day of the interview are
selected for the study. Schools or students who refused
to participate in the study are not replaced in the
sample.
Our analysis included 1,978 middle school students
and 6,163 high school students from year 2004, 2006,
and 2009 combined who had valid information on the
school year, past 30 day smoking, brand use, and
menthol questions. Those who were excluded included:
those who did not specify a grade in school or didn't
answer the question (n=397); those who were not a

current smoker or didn't answer the question
(n=67,809); those who said they didn't smoke cigarettes
during the past 30 days, that they did not have a usual
brand when asked about brand use, or did not answer
the question (n=66,719); and those who said they do not
smoke cigarettes when asked about menthol cigarettes
or did not answer the question (n=59,965).
We analyzed data from 2,580 adolescent smokers
selected throughout 35 states (not all states are repre-
sented because the survey design did not control for
this) and from 267 large and small private and public
schools.
MTFS
The Monitoring the Future Survey (MTFS) main data
collection involves a series of large, annual surveys of
nationally representative samples of public and private
secondary school students in grades 8th, 10th, and 12th
throughout the coterminous United States. Staff mem-
bers administer the questionnaires to students, usually
in their classrooms during a regular class period. Partici-
pation is voluntary. Parents are notified well in advance
of the survey administration and are provided the
opportunity to decline their child's participation. Ques-
tionnaires are self-completed. For the combined years of
1998 to 2008, there were 20,863 8th grade current smo-
kers, 30,722 10th grade current smokers, and 40,914 12th
grade current smokers in our data analysis. We assessed
trends in smoking menthol cigarettes among adolescent
smokers.
NHANES
The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES) consists of a number of questionnaires
administered in the household followed by standardized
physical examinations and additional tobacco use ques-
tions administered in specially equipped mobile exami-
nation centers (MECs). The NHANES target population
is the civilian, noninstitutionalized U.S. population. This
nationally representative sample permits calculation of
national estimates. NHANES over-samples low-income
persons, adolescents 12Â­19 years, persons 60+ years of
age, blacks, and Mexican Americans. We used NHANES
data collected between January 2001 and December
2006. The overall response rate to NHANES for 2003Â­
2008 was 78%. The analytic sample for this study
included smokers aged 20 years and older who had
smoked, who were recoded by NHANES as non-Hispa-
nic white, non-Hispanic black/African American, or
Mexican American. Of the 14,272 white, black, or Mexi-
can American adults aged 20 years and older who com-
pleted the NHANES home interview. The final analytic
sample included 2,319 individuals, of which 1,581
showed the 8 or 12 digit Universal Product Code (UPC)
information on the side of the cigarette pack.
Results
Youth
In the combined years 2004 to 2008, almost half of ado-
lescent smokers aged 12 Â­ 17 years reported smoking
menthol cigarettes [10], an estimated 1 million adoles-
cents (Table 1). Self-reports of types of cigarettes
smoked are subject to bias. This important topic will be
discussed in more detail later. Younger smokers are
more likely to smoke menthol cigarettes than older
smokers [10,16]. Figure 1 shows that a higher propor-
tion of cigarette smokers smoked menthol cigarettes
among adolescents (44.8%) than among young adults
aged 18-25 years (36.5%) or older adults (30.1%). Con-
sistent with this result specifically for adolescent current
smokers, data for years 2004, 2006, and 2009 in the
NYTS survey shows that 49.4% of middle school current
smokers and 44.9% of high school current smokers
reported smoking menthol cigarettes (Table 2). Finally,
Aplleyard and colleagues found in a school-based survey
using 2000 NYTS data that 42.0% of high school smo-
kers who smoked in the past 30 days reported to have
smoked a menthol brand [11].
The proportion of menthol smokers among all cigar-
ette smokers is higher among adolescents than among
adults in most, but not all, racial or ethnic groups (Fig-
ure 2). Among white, multi-racial, Asian, and Hispanic
youth, the proportions of adolescent cigarette smokers
reporting smoking menthol cigarettes are significantly
higher than among adults. However, the proportion of
African American adolescent cigarette smokers (71.9%)
reporting smoking menthol cigarettes is significantly
lower than the corresponding proportion for African
American adult smokers (82.7%). This observed differ-
ence requires additional study to determine if it is a real
difference or an artifact of misreporting.
Racial/ethnic group
Big racial/ethnic differences exist in menthol cigarette
use. Very high proportions of black/African American
adolescent smokers smoke menthol cigarettes
[13,25-27]. Recent national data shows that about seven
of ten African American smokers in this age group
reported smoking menthol cigarettes, followed by about
more than half of multi-race and Asian adolescent smo-
kers (Figure 2). Data from the NSDUH survey shows
that among adolescent smokers aged 12-17 years, 51.5%
of Asians, 47.0% of Hispanics, and 41.4% of Native
Hawaiians/Pacific Islanders reported smoking a menthol
brand in the past 30 days. Similarly, a study conducted
by Appleyard [13] and colleagues using 2000 NYTS data
showed that 58.0% of Asians reported using a menthol

cigarette brand. However, in another study conducted
by Moolchan [19] in Baltimore, MD he found no differ-
ence in menthol cigarette use between blacks/African
Americans (99.3% and 97.6% for males and females,
respectively) and whites (92.3% and 87.5%, respectively).
This study, however, used a convenience sample.
Appleyard and colleagues also found that high school
black/African American, Asian, and Native Hawaiian
and Pacific Islander smokers were more likely to report
smoking menthol cigarettes than their counterparts in
middle school; while white and Hispanic high school
smokers were less likely to report smoking menthol
cigarettes than their counterparts in middle school [13].
A similar finding for whites and Hispanics (less smoking
of menthol cigarettes among high school students) was
found by Hersey and colleagues [14].
Gender
No consistent gender difference in menthol cigarette use
is observed among adolescents. The scientific literature
provided found no gender difference in menthol cigar-
ette use between male and female adolescent smokers.
Giovino [9], Hersey [14], Kaufman [15], Cummings [18],
Johnston [21] found no gender difference between males
and females who smoked the menthol brand Newpor-
tTM*or reported smoking menthol cigarettes in general.

from the NSDUH, NYTS, and MTFS. NSDUH data
showed that girls aged 12-17 years were more likely to
smoke menthol cigarettes than boys the same age in
years 2004, 2005, and 2006, but no gender difference
was observed in 2007 and 2008 (Table 1). When gender
difference for this age group was assessed looking at the
youth menthol leading cigarette brand NewportTM, no
differences were observed in any of these years (data not
shown). Using NYTS data for years 2004, 2006, and
2009 combined, no gender difference in menthol cigar-
ette use was observed in middle school (47.9% for
females, 50.9% for males), however, a gender difference
was observed in high school students, with females
more likely to smoke menthol cigarettes than males

(p-value= 0.0001) (Table 2). When data for all 3 years
were combined, 49.2% of high school girls reported
smoking menthol cigarettes compared to 41.0% of high
school boys (results not shown). However, no differ-
ences were observed in using NewportTM between males
and females when using 2004, 2006, and 2009 combined
NYTS data (results not shown). MTFS for years 2004-
2009 found no gender difference in smoking NewportTM
among 8th, 10th, or 12th graders (data not shown).
Brand preferences
Research has shown that cigarette brand use varies by age,
gender, and race/ethnicity [23,24,29,30]. Since efforts were
initiated in specific studies in the late 1980's [15,16] and
the early 1990's [18] to assess cigarette brand preference
among adolescent smokers, MarlboroTM, NewportTM, and
CamelTM were the top three cigarette brands smoked by
adolescent smokers. Kaufman and colleagues [15] stated
that even though market shares for the cigarette brands
MarlboroTM and Camel TMchanged little between 1989 and
1996, the prevalence of smoking NewportTM cigarettes
doubled among white and Hispanic adolescents who
usually bought their cigarettes during that period. Barker
and colleagues [16] also found that the prevalence of
smoking NewportTM cigarettes increased among adoles-
cents from 1989 to 1993, and also for CamelTM, while the
prevalence of smoking MarlboroTM cigarettes decreased
during this period. Consistent with results from earlier
years, the 1999 MTFS report [21] showed that MarlboroTM
was the predominant brand for 8th, 10th, and 12th graders,
ranging from 53.7%, 61.1%, to 65.2%; followed by the
menthol brand NewportTM (22.5%, 17.7%, and 13.3%,
respectively). The third-ranked brand was CamelTM (5.4%,
7.3%, and 9.6%, respectively). Also consistent with earlier
studies [15,18] big racial/ethnic differences were found.
While the great majority of white (61-70%) and Hispanic
(57-65%) smokers smoked MarlboroTM, the vast majority
of blacks/African Americans smoked NewportTM (71-
82%). Similar results were observed by Appleyard and
colleagues [13] using 2000 NYTS data for middle and high
school students. Appleyard found that the vast majority of
white, Hispanic, Asian, and Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islan-
der adolescent smokers smoked MarlboroTM, and the vast
majority of black/African American adolescent smokers
smoked NewportTM. The predominance of these three
cigarette brands still persist [24]. Figures 3 to 5 using 1998
to 2008 MTFS surveys show that the three leading cigar-
ette brands smoked by adolescents are MarlboroTM, New-
portTM, and CamelTM, in that order. A 2005 NSDUH
report on cigarette brand preference showed that 81.3% of
smokers aged 12-17 years and 82.4% of smokers aged 18
to 25 years smoked one of the top 3 brands [24]. Those 26
years or older reported to smoke a somewhat more diver-
sified selection of cigarette brands, only 54.1% of smokers
smoked one of the top 3 brands.
Geographic Differences in Cigarette Brand Use Preferences
Data on use of menthol cigarettes by region they live in
the U.S. is scarce. Compared to the East region of the
United States, Kaufman and colleagues [15] found in the
1990's that adolescents living in the Midwest, South,
and West were less likely to smoke NewportTM and
more likely to smoke MarlboroTM.
Smoking initiation
It has been hypothesized that menthol cigarette brands
play an important role in smoking initiation. When
looking at three age groups (12-17 years, 18-25 years, 26
years or older), the younger the age group, the more
likely it is to report smoking menthol cigarettes [10].
Unfortunately, data on this topic is scarce and data from
cohort studies are lacking. It is important to clarify that
the age of a smoker and smoking initiation is not
equivalent. A person that is younger may have been
smoking longer than an older person. For example, an
adolescent aged 14 years may have been smoking for 3
years, while a young adult aged 19 years may have
started smoking less than 1 year ago. Thus, age or age
group (12-17 years, 18-25 years, 26 years or older) of
the smoker is not equivalent to smoking initiation. The

best study design to assess if adolescents and young
adults are starting to smoke with a menthol cigarette
brand is a prospective/cohort study. However, no cohort
study we are aware of collects this type of information
for persons younger than age 18 years, when most
smoking initiation happens.
Due to lack of information on smoking initiation with
menthol cigarettes from prospective studies, and in an
attempt to determine if smoking initiation is correlated
with menthol cigarette use, we conducted an analysis
using cross-sectional data to determine the prevalence
of self-reported menthol cigarette use at different
"stages" or trajectories of cigarette smoking among ado-
lescents in grades 6th Â­ 12.th This type of analysis has
been used to determine the prevalence of nicotine
dependence at different stages/trajectories of cigarette
smoking among adolescents [31]. Although this
approach is inferior to collecting data from prospective
studies, it is also true that patterns of cigarette smoking
develop over months or years within individuals. In fact,
most new smokers take an average of 2-3 years from
the time they smoked their first cigarette to the time
they become daily smokers [32]. Thus, the analysis pre-
sented here for respondents who started smoking less
than 2 years ago may give us an insight on the relation
of smoking initiation (earliest stages/trajectories of
smoking) and the use of menthol cigarettes. We com-
bined data from the 2004, 2006, and 2009 National
Youth Tobacco Survey (NYTS). When looking at poten-
tial "stages" or trajectories of cigarette smoking and the
use of menthol cigarettes, no significant differences were
observed between "stages" or trajectories and the preva-
lence of smoking menthol cigarettes (Table 3). Among
adolescents who smoked <1 cigarette per day (CPD) on
1-5 days of the past 30 days, 39.9 percent reported
smoking menthol cigarettes. For those who smoked 1-5
CPD on 1-5 days, 6-9 days, 10-19 days, 20-29 days, and
all 30 days, the self-reported prevalence of smoking
menthol cigarettes among all smokers was 45.3%, 47.5%,
44.2%, 49.7%, and 46.6%, respectively. Among those
smoking all 30 days, 42.7% of those who smoked 6-10
CPD, 43.3% of those who reported smoking 11-20 CPD,
and 64.9% of those who smoked 20 or more CPD said
they smoked a menthol brand. Thus, if smoking a
menthol cigarette is a factor associated with smoking
initiation, it would be expected to see a higher propor-
tion of menthol cigarette smokers at the earlier stages/
trajectories of cigarette smoking. In fact, we found the
prevalence of menthol use to be lower among those
who smoked <1 CPD on 1-5 days than those who
smoked 1-5 CPD on 1-5 days or 1-5 CPD on 20-29 days
and to be similar to those in other stages/trajectories of
cigarette smoking. Also, those at the highest level of
cigarette smoking (20+ CPD on all 30 days) were more
likely to report smoking menthol cigarettes than all
other smoking stages/trajectories. Thus, we found no
indication that adolescent smokers are more likely to
initiate smoking by smoking menthol cigarettes.
Trends in menthol cigarette use
In general, the prevalence of cigarette smoking in the U.
S. has been declining for adolescents over the past 10
years. The Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) shows
that cigarette smoking among 9th-12th grade students
fell by 44% from 1997 to 2007, from 36.4% to 20.0%, a
percentage point decline in smoking prevalence of 16%
[32], while the proportion of adolescent cigarette smo-
kers reporting to smoke menthol cigarettes has
increased significantly from 2004 to 2008 (Figure 6).
Among all past-month smokers aged 12-17 years, the
proportion of smokers reporting smoking menthol
cigarettes increased significantly from 43.4% in 2004 to
48.3% in 2008, for an 11% increase over 4 years. This
increase in the proportion of adolescent cigarette smo-
kers who smoked menthol cigarettes reflects an increase
in menthol cigarette use among white adolescents
(40.3% to 46.0%), who were the only racial/ethnic group
to show a significant increase over this period (results
not shown). Looking at trends of some specific cigarette

brands using MTFS data from 1998 to 2008, no consis-
tent or significant change was observed during this per-
iod for NewportTM, a predominantly menthol brand,
among 8th, 10th, and 12th graders, however, a significant
increase was observed for KoolTM, another menthol
brand, for 10th and 12th graders (Figures 3, 4, 5).
Similarly, using data from the 2004, 2006, and 2009
NYTS survey, a slight nonsignificant decrease in smok-
ing NewportTM was observed among middle school smo-
kers and no change among high school smokers (Figures
7 and 8). The lack of significant changes for specific
cigarette brands over time may be due, at least in part,
to less precision of the estimates due to smaller sample
size numbers.

CamelTM and MarlboroTM cigarette brands come both
in menthol and nonmenthol. The MTFS survey does
not distinguish however between these two types of
cigarettes. The MTFS data from 1998 to 2008 showed a
significant increase in CamelTM use for boys and girls in
10th and 12th grade and declines in MarlboroTM use
among smokers in 8th, 10th, and 12th grade (Figures 3 to
5). A decline in MarlboroTM use was also observed
among middle and high school boys and girls in the
2009 NYTS compared to previous years (data not
shown). However, because most of the cigarette market
share is driven by adult smokers, this decline may not
be reflected in the overall MarlboroTM market share.
Finally, Kreslake and colleagues reported that expendi-
tures in advertising for nonmenthol brands declined
from $309.3 million in 1998 to $39.8 million in 2005
while expenditures in advertising for menthol brands
increased from $36.5 million to $43.8 million during
that period [8]. It is known that adolescents are highly
susceptible to advertising influences. Tobacco advertis-
ing, marketing, and promotion play an important role in
increasing smoking initiation and tobacco use among
youth [34]. Youth have been purposely targeted through
advertising, marketing, and promotion [34]. The total
weight of evidence presented by the 2008 NCI's Mono-
graph #19, which was assessed from multiple study
types including experimental, cross-sectional, and longi-
tudinal studies, and conducted by investigators from dif-
ferent disciplines using data from several countries,
demonstrated a causal relationship between tobacco
advertising, marketing, and promotion that ultimately
increased smoking initiation and tobacco use [34]. It is
possible that increases in expenditures in advertising for
menthol brands resulted in increases in youth exposure
to such advertising, which then resulted in increase pre-
valence of use of menthol cigarette brands.
Adults
About three out of ten adult cigarette smokers reported
smoking a menthol cigarette brand (Figure 1). Young
adult smokers aged 18-25 years are more likely to
smoke menthol cigarettes than older adult smokers
(aged 26 years or older). Figure 1 shows that a higher
proportion of cigarette smokers aged 18-25 years
smoked menthol cigarettes (36.5%) than older adults
(30.1%).
Racial/ethnic group
Among adult smokers, the vast majority of black/African
American adults reported smoking a menthol cigarette
brand [18,22,35-39]. Other ethnic groups that may have
a high proportion of menthol cigarette smokers are
Puerto Ricans [37], Asians [39], and Native Hawaiians/
Other Pacific Islanders (Figure 2). More recent informa-
tion using data from the NSDUH survey shows that
about eight of ten black/African American adult smo-
kers reported smoking menthol cigarettes, followed by
about half of Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Island
adult smokers (Figure 2). In fact, almost half of adult
menthol cigarette smokers are from minority racial/eth-
nic groups. Analyses with this NHANES data confirm
the NSDUH result that most black/African American
smokers smoke a menthol brand (results not shown).
Thus, one consistent finding is that black/African Amer-
ican smokers are far more likely to smoke a menthol
cigarette brand than smokers of other U.S. racial/ethnic
groups, however, some other racial/ethnic groups of
smokers such as Hawaiians and Other Pacific Islanders
and probably Puerto Ricans also smoke menthol cigar-
ettes in high proportion [37,39].
Gender
Several studies [18,22,35-39] and further data analyses
performed using recent NSDUH (2004-2008) and
NHANES (2003-2008) data confirm that female adult
smokers are more likely to smoke menthol cigarettes
than male adult smokers (Table 4). The scientific litera-
ture is consistent in this finding for adult smokers but
not for adolescent smokers. NSDUH (2004-2008) data
shows that a higher proportion of adult female smokers
than adult male smokers reported smoking menthol
cigarettes. This was observed for both 18-25 years and
26 years or older. The gender difference was also
observed among African Americans, whites, and Hispa-
nics (Figure 9). The lack of a significant gender differ-
ence for the other racial/ethnic groups probably resulted
from the lack of precision of the estimates for these
populations due to small sample size. However, no gen-
der difference was observed for the menthol brand New-
portTM when using 2004-2008 NSDUH data (data not
shown). Further analysis using NHANES 2003-2008
data in which smokers showed their pack of cigarettes
to the interviewer also showed a gender difference
where female adult smokers aged 26 years or older were
more likely to smoke a menthol brand than their male
counterpart, but not so among the age group 20-25

years old, probably due to smaller sample size number
of smokers in the survey in this age group (results not
shown). No gender difference in NewportTM use was
observed between males and females in the age groups
20-25 years or 26 years or older in NHANES (results

Brand preferences
We mentioned earlier that cigarette brand use varies by
age and that cigarette brands selection is more diversi-
fied for adults aged 26 years or older than those aged
12-17 years and 18-25 years old. The 2005 NSDUH
report showed that 54.1% of smokers' aged 26 years or
older smoked one of the top 3 brands (MarlboroTM,
NewportTM, CamelTM) compared to 81.3% of smokers
aged 12-17 years and 82.4% of smokers aged 18 to 25
years (24). Table 5 and Figure 10 show the distribution
of specific menthol and nonmenthol brand use by smo-
kers aged 20 years or older verified by the UPC code.
The percent of menthol smokers among all smokers for
2003-2008 was 27.4%. This is similar to reported market
share data for years 2003-2005 [1], where menthol
brands represented about 26% to 27% of the market
share of cigarettes; except for 2006, when it was
reported to be 20%. Both Table 5 and Figure show that
among specific menthol brands, NewportTM is the lead-
ing menthol brand smoked by adult smokers (7.8% -
11.6%), followed by Marlboro MentholTM (3.9% - 5.9%),
Kool TM (2.4% - 3.2%), and SalemTM (1.2% - 3.2%).
When menthol brands other than the ones mentioned
above were combined, they represented about 7.0% -
8.7% of the brands smoked by all adult smokers. Marl-
boroTM nonmenthol brands (33.3% - 39.8%) and non-
menthol brands (27.2% - 33.0%) other than CamelTM
represented the vast majority of brands smoked by adult
smokers.
Geographic differences in cigarette brand use
Data on use of menthol cigarettes by region they live in
the U.S. is also scarce for adults. A table using 2000
NSDUH data showed that smokers living in the North-
east of the United States were more likely to report
smoking menthol cigarettes [9] than those living in the
South, North Central, and West of the United States.
Similarly, a 2005 NSDUH report on brand preferences
confirmed that 18.2% of smokers aged 12 years or older,
the vast majority of them adult smokers, and living in
the Northeast reported smoking NewportTM compared
to 10.7%, 12.4%, and 3.3% in the Midwest, South, and
West of the United States, respectively [24].
Income
Data on income and the use of menthol cigarettes is
almost nonexistent in the scientific literature. A data
analysis using 2004-2008 NSDUH showed that adult
smokers with family incomes of less than $50,000 were
more likely to smoke menthol cigarettes than adult
smokers with higher family incomes (Figure 11).
Trends in menthol cigarette use
From 2004 to 2008, the proportion of menthol cigarette
smokers among all cigarette smokers increased among
adults aged 18-25 years and 26 years or older (Figure 6).
The proportion of cigarette smokers who reported
smoking menthol cigarettes increased significantly from
2004 to 2008 among white and Hispanic men (Figure
12). No changes were observed for white, black/African
American, and Hispanic women (results not shown).

American men and women may be explained, at least in
part, to a ceiling effect, where about 80% of men and
90% of women who smoked already smoked a menthol
brand. Looking at trends in cigarette brand use from
2002 to 2008 using NSDUH data, no significant changes
of MarlboroTM, NewportTM, or CamelTM use were
observed for young adults aged 18-25 years (Figure 13),
nor for smokers aged 26 years or older (Figure 14). The
lack of significant changes for specific cigarette brands
over time may be due, at least in part, to less precision
of the estimates due to smaller sample size numbers.
Kreslake and colleagues reported an increase for Marl-
boro MentholTM sales data [8]. They found that although
cigarette sales in the U.S. declined 22% from 2000 to
2005, that the sales of menthol cigarettes remained
stable and that Marlboro MentholTM had a consistent
market share growth that started in the early 1990's up
to 2006, most recent data available when they published
their article. In 2006, the authors reported, NewportTM
was the leading menthol brand, followed by Marlboro
MentholTM, which they stated was particularly popular
among young adult smokers. Using 2004-2008 NSDUH
data, we found that for adult smokers, even though the
prevalence of cigarette smoking remained the same in
2008 (20.6%) compared to 2004 (20.9%), the self-
reported use of menthol cigarettes increased during
those years for adults, more so for those aged 18-25
years than those aged 26 years or older.
Menthol cigarette use self-report bias
As previously stated, self-reports of types of cigarettes
smoked are subject to bias. For example, Hersey [14],
Giovino and colleagues [9] as well as Kreslake and col-
leagues [8] found that menthol cigarette use self-reports
are subject to misclassification, probably more so on
certain subgroups such as adolescents. Kreslake and col-
leagues found that 83% of adolescents aged 12-17 years
who smoked NewportTM, a menthol brand, also reported
they were smokers of menthol cigarettes when asked in
a separate question, thus 17% of them reported to be
smokers of nonmenthol cigarettes which is inconsistent
with the menthol brand Newport. When a similar
assessment was made for participants aged 35 years or
older, they found that only 5% of NewportTM smokers
reported in a separate question to be smokers of a non-
menthol brand [8].
Compared to most adult smokers, most adolescent
smokers can be considered to be novice smokers. The
fact that a substantial proportion of current (smoking at
least 1 day of past 30 days, even a puff) adolescent smo-
kers (e.g., first triers, experimenters, <weekly smokers)
will not be considered to be an established adult smoker
(100 cigarettes smoked or more in lifetime) is likely
related to the differential misreporting of the use of
menthol cigarettes between the two age groups. For
example, a paper published recently by Caraballo and
colleagues [31] shows that 26.8% of current adolescent
smokers aged 12-18 years started smoking <1 year prior
to the time of the interview. In contrast, the vast major-
ity of adult smokers are established smokers, smoke
every day (80%), buy their own cigarettes, and most of
them smoke at least half-a-pack a day. Learning specific
brand characteristics (e.g., full flavor, light or ultra-light;
Marlboro MildTM, Marlboro MentholTM, Newport; TM
menthol or nonmenthol) develops over time. It is likely
that many adolescent smokers are less knowledgeable
than adult smokers of the specific characteristics of the
cigarettes they smoke, especially those who are early in

do not (usually) buy their cigarettes. Thus, adolescent
smokers are probably more prone to misreport the type
of cigarettes they smoke, including a menthol brand,
than adult smokers do.
As previously mentioned, collecting information on
the type of cigarettes smoked using the 8 or 12 digit
UPC bar code information on the side of the cigarette
pack may be seen as a solution to the problem of
obtaining accurate information on whether the brand
smoked by an adolescent is menthol or non-menthol.
However, most of the national youth surveys (MTFS,
NYTS, YRBS) that collect this type of information are
conducted in a school-setting, a place where adolescents
who smoke may not bring their cigarettes and where
most schools will not allow it. In household surveys (e.
g., NSDUH), some of the novice or even experienced
smokers may not want their parents/caregivers to know

they smoke. Also, they may be less likely than an adult
smoker to have a pack of cigarettes with them. There is
ample evidence that a degree of self-report bias exists in
reporting the use of mentholated cigarettes, especially
among adolescents. Assuming that this type of bias is
fairly constant over time, the increase over time in
menthol cigarette use among adolescents and adults is a
real one.
Conclusion
There is evidence that menthol cigarettes are dispropor-
tionately smoked by U.S. adolescents, blacks/African
Americans, adult females, those living in the Northeast
of the United States, and those with lower family
incomes than their counterparts. It is likely that other
disparities in menthol cigarette use exist that we have
not covered or have not been studied. Based on self-
reports of menthol cigarette use, the use of menthol
cigarettes among smokers have increased in recent years
among adolescents aged 12-17 years, young adults aged
18-25 years, adults aged 26 years or older, white and
Hispanic men. No upward trend was observed for pre-
dominantly menthol brands such as NewportTM, Kool,TM
or SalemTM, although this may be due, at least in part,
due to smaller numbers of smokers who smoked these
specific brands or sub-brands of cigarettes, which
resulted in less precise estimates.
