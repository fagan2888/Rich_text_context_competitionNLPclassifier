Objectives. This study identified different types of caregivers who provide care to older African Americans, the types of
caregiving structures created to provide care, and the factors that help predict caregiving structures.
Methods. A community sample of 330 caregivers caring for 202 elderly African Americans was used. Multinomial logistic
regression predicted what type of caregiving structure was created by families to provide care to older relatives.
Results. Three types of caregivers were identified: 187 primary caregivers, who were connected to 79 secondary caregivers
and 49 tertiary caregivers. Fifteen tertiary-only caregivers who were not connected to other caregivers were identified. Five
caregiving structures were found: (i) primary, secondary, and tertiary, (ii) primary and secondary, (iii) primary and tertiary, (iv)
primary only, and (v) tertiary-only. Characteristics of care recipients were predictive of caregiving structures.
Discussion. Different types of caregivers with distinct roles and responsibilities provided care within defined caregiving
structures to olderAfrican American family members. Caregiving structures may be individualistic (only one caregiver) or col-
lectivist (two or more caregivers). Caregiving structure is predicted by the care recipients' conditions and situations, but not
those of the primary caregiver.
TN the reviews on caregiving to elderly people, limited find-
X ings are available on caregiving in ethnic minority groups
(Kramer, 1997; Schultz, O'Brien, Bookwala, & Fleissner, 1995;
Schultz, Visintainer, & Williamson, 1990). In addition, few
findings are available on caregiving issues beyond those of the
primary caregiver (Barer & Johnson, 1990; Horowitz, 1992;
Keith, 1995; Matthews & Rosner, 1988). Therefore, little is
known about how families make use of multiple caregivers who
create distinct structures of care for elderly relatives. We be-
lieve, as Keith (1995) suggested, that caregiving to older people
can be understood more clearly by changing the approach; that
is, by expanding the focus of caregiving studies from just the
primary caregiver to examining how families organize the struc-
ture of care when caring for dependent members. Therefore,
rather than continuing to study the caregiving dyad (care recipi-
ent and primary caregiver), we examine the multiple types of
caregivers and the various ways in which care is given to older
people. As Pyke and Bengtson (1996) suggest, this approach
can show whether families create individualistic or collectivist
systems of care to address older relatives' needs.
Findings show that the incidence of severe functional limita-
tions among olderAfrican Americans (40%) is higher than among
Whites (27%; U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1995), that the rate of
institutionalization for African Americans is less than hah0 the rate
for Whites (Belgrave, Wykle, & Choi, 1993), and that African
American families make limited use of formal services to assist
with caregiving (Caserta, Lund, Wright, & Redburn, 1987; Logan
& Spitze, 1994). In light of these findings, there is a need to study
how African American families provide care to older relatives be-
yond a single caregiver. Accordingly, in this study we address
three major questions: (a) Do older African Americans receive
care from different types of caregivers who have different levels of
responsibility and who provide different amounts of care? (b) Are
the different types of caregivers in African American families or-
ganized to form distinct structures through which care is pro-
vided? (c) Which factors best predict what structures of care are
used by caregivers to provide care to olderAfrican Americans?
Types ofCaregivers
In this study we distinguished the different types of caregivers
by their level of responsibility and caregiving tasks. Primary
caregivers were identified by care recipients or their proxies and
were verified by the caregivers. They had the highest level of re-
sponsibility regarding care and performed the largest number of
caregiving tasks. Primary caregivers provided care alone or in
conjunction with other helpers. Secondary caregivers were iden-
tified by the primary caregiver as persons who performed tasks
at a level similar to that of the primary caregiver, but without the
same level of responsibility. Therefore, secondary caregivers
were not in charge of making decisions about the care recipi-
ent's support and care and only provided care in conjunction
with primary caregivers. Tertiary caregivers were usually identi-
fied by the primary caregiver and provided care with the pri-
mary caregiver. These caregivers had little or no responsibility
for making decisions regarding the care recipient; they per-
formed specialized tasks such as grocery shopping, yard work,
or paying bills. Some tertiary caregivers, however, provided care
in the absence of other caregivers, typically to high-functioning
older people. Similar to primary caregivers, these tertiary care-
givers were identified by the care recipients or their proxies.
Caregiving Structures
We proposed that caregivers would create various structures of
care, which would differ according to the type and combination
S237
S238 DILWORTH-ANDERSONETAL.
of caregivers, that provide varying degrees of care and support to
older relatives. Although it would have been ideal to include all
possible combinations of caregiving structures that included vari-
ous numbers and configurations of caregivers in this article, we
were only interested in examining whether a primary caregiver
had at least one secondary and/or tertiary caregiver who provided
them with the most assistance among all other caregivers in their
support network. We believed this approach would provide an
available sample of caregiving structures for analysis. Therefore,
primary caregivers could work either alone (primary-only) or in
combination with others (primary and secondary; primary and
tertiary; or primary, secondary, and tertiary). Secondary care-
givers worked only in combination with others (primary and sec-
ondary; or primary, secondary, and tertiary). Tertiary caregivers
could work either with others (primary and tertiary; or primary,
secondary, and tertiary) or alone (referred to as tertiary-only).
Hypotheses about caregiver structures.--Based on previous
literature, we have five hypotheses about caregiving structures.
First, care recipients with the highest levels of dependency, as
evidenced by their need for assistance with activities of daily
living (ADLs), would receive care in larger structures (e.g., pri-
mary, secondary, and tertiary vs primary-only, primary and ter-
tiary, primary and secondary, or tertiary-only; Litwak, 1985;
Stoller & Pugliesi, 1991). Second, care recipients with limited
financial resources, as evidenced by their inability to meet their
financial obligations, would receive care in smaller structures
(Benin & Keith, 1995; Chatters, Taylor, & Neighbors, 1989;
Murrell & Norris, 1991). Third, the greater the care recipients'
use of formal support services--situations that most often indi-
cate greater frailty and dependency--the more likely that care
would be provided in larger as opposed to smaller structures
(e.g., primary, secondary, and tertiary vs primary-only). Fourth,
care recipients with the greatest number of children living
within one hour's drive would have larger caregiving structures
(Himes, Jordan, & Farkas, 1996). Finally, caregivers coresiding
with the care recipient (Soldo, Wolf, & Agree, 1990; Ward,
Logan, & Spitze, 1992), working full-time (Starrels, Ingersoll-
Dayton, Dowler, & Neal, 1997), experiencing distress in their
role as a caregiver, or suffering physical health problems would
give care in larger structures (e.g., primary, secondary, and ter-
tiary) than the caregivers without these characteristics.
METHODS
Sampling Procedures
This study included olderAfrican Americans who were mem-
bers of the Duke Established Populations for Epidemiological
Studies of the Elderly (EPESE; Cornoni-Huntley, Blazer,
Service, & Farmer, 1990). Two criteria were used to select older
participants based on data from Wave 3 (1992-1993). These cri-
teria included an inability to perform two or more basic activities
of daily living (Branch, Katz, Kniepmann, & Papsidero, 1984)
and/or a score of 3 or more (indicating mild to severe cognitive
impairment) on the Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire
(SPMSQ; Pfeiffer, 1975). Four hundred ninety-seven African
American elders met these criteria, but only 234 were available
when this study began. Most of the attrition resulted from deaths.
All 234 elderly participants or their proxy respondents were
first contacted between 1995 and 1997 by a letter describing
our study and how we obtained their names, addresses, and
phone numbers. A follow-up screening telephone interview
with the elderly participants or proxy respondents was con-
ducted to determine whether there was a main caregiver who
provided them with the most support and care. If identified, that
person was contacted by phone to verify his or her caregiving
roles and responsibilities, and an in-person interview was
scheduled. If there were any discrepancies in identifying and
verifying the main caregiver, the care recipient was contacted
again. In the few cases in which this occurred, we were able to
identify the appropriate main caregiver. Ten percent of the 234
main caregivers refused to participate, 2% could not be con-
tacted, and 2% of the care recipients had died or were institu-
tionalized. As a result, 202 main caregivers were interviewed
(187 primary and 15 tertiary-only caregivers). We asked the pri-
mary caregivers whether there was one secondary and/or tertiary
caregiver who provided the greatest amount of help in assisting
them in their caregiving role. From this group, 79 secondary and
49 tertiary caregivers were interviewed. Thus, our total sample
included 330 caregivers.
Measures
The measure of caregiving structure consisted of five categories
reflecting combinations of types of caregivers identified in the
study: (i) primary, secondary, and tertiary, (ii) primary and sec-
ondary; (iii) primary and tertiary; (iv) primary-only; and (v) ter-
tiary-only. To assess the level of dependency among care recipi-
ents, we used the Duke OARS 6-item physical ADL subscale,
which had a Cronbach's alpha of .77 (Fillenbaum, 1988). Degree
of assistance with support on this scale ranged from 2 (unable to
perform tasks) to 0 (able to perform tasks without help). We as-
sessed financial status by care recipients' reports on whether the
amount of money they possess meets their needs poorly, fairly
well, or very well. The number of children living within a one-hour
drive of the care recipient was measured as a continuous variable.
To measure care recipients' use of formal support services (e.g., de-
livered meals, physical therapy, or homemaker service), we asked
primary caregivers to indicate whether the care recipients used any
of 16 different formal support services within the past month.
These were summed to indicate the total number of services used.
Coresidence was defined as living with the care recipient (coded 1)
or not living with care recipient (coded 0). Employment was mea-
sured as employed (coded 1) or not employed (coded 0). We mea-
sured caregivers' functional health using a 10-item subscale from
the Rand Health Survey. Scores were converted to percentiles rang-
ing from 0 to 100, with higher percentiles indicating better health
(McHorney, Ware, Lu, & Sherbourne, 1994). Cronbach's alpha
was .91. We measured caregiver distress by dichotomizing the
Global Severity Index (GSI) of the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI;
Derogatis & Spencer, 1982). The BSI subscales had Cronbach's
alphas ranging from .71 to .90. Caregivers were classified as dis-
tressed if they had a T score of 63 or greater on two or more of the
nine subscales.
RESULTS
Care Recipients
There were 42 male and 160 female African American care re-
cipients. The average age was 74. More than 75% were unmar-
ried, with the majority being widowed. The average number of
CAREGIVER TYPESAND STRUCTURES S239
ADL limitations, as reported by the main caregivers, was 2.4.
Forty-three percent of the care recipients were cognitively im-
paired. More than half (58%) of the care recipients lived with their
primary caregiver and only 2% lived more than 30 minutes away.
None of the tertiary-only caregivers lived with the care recipients.
Caregivers
As shown in Table 1, we found four different types of care-
givers. These were 187 primary caregivers, 79 secondary care-
givers, 49 tertiary caregivers, and 15 tertiary-only caregivers.
Tertiary caregivers had provided care for a longer time (10.6
years) man either primary, secondary, or tertiary-only caregivers
(8.7 years, 7.1 years, and 3.2 years, respectively). Most of the
caregivers had moderate functional health with mean scores
ranging from 64 to 67.
The majority of the caregivers were middle-aged adult (55
years old) daughters of the care recipients. Almost four times as

many daughters as sons were primary caregivers (49% and 13%,
respectively). Wives were more likely than husbands to be
providers of care to a spouse. Unlike primary caregivers, the sec-
ondary, tertiary, and tertiary-only caregivers included paid helpers
(22%, 8%, and 40%, respectively). Caregivers were more likely to
be unmarried (57% were divorced, widowed, or never married)
than married. The majority (more than 55%) of the caregivers had
at least a high school education. Seventy-four percent of the pri-
mary caregivers had an annual personal income of $15,000 or
less. Although personal incomes were somewhat higher for all
other caregivers, approximately one third had annual incomes of
$15,000 or less. At least 35% of the primary caregivers were
working more than 30 hours per week, as were 44% to 60% of
the secondary, tertiary, and tertiary-only caregivers.
Predicting Caregiving Structures
Five caregiving structures were identified: primary and sec-
ondary (33%); primary, secondary, and tertiary (25%); primary-
only (19%); primary and tertiary (16%); and tertiary-only (7%).
For the multivariable analyses, the tertiary-only structures
(N=15) were dropped because of their small number. Further-
more, we combined the primary-only and primary and tertiary
structures because the frequency of each was small (31 and 39,
respectively); the only difference between them was the pres-
ence of a tertiary caregiver who performed specialized tasks to
support the primary caregiver in the primary and tertiary struc-
ture. Given the limited amount of assistance a tertiary caregiver
may provide, we believed that the coefficients on the variables
used to predict these structures would not differ significantly.
Guided by our hypotheses, we considered eight predictors
reflecting the needs and conditions of care recipients and care-
givers. The four predictors for care recipients included ADL
status, level of formal support, doing well versus doing poorly
in meeting theirfinancialneeds, and the number of children liv-
ing within one hour's drive of the care recipient. The four care-
giver predictors included living versus not living with the care
recipient, distressed versus not distressed, employed versus not
employed, and the level of functional health. We tested for multi-
collinearity by examining correlations among the predictor vari-
ables. None were found to be significantly related.
To assess the effect of the predictor variables, we estimated
models using multinomial logistic regression. This procedure
simultaneously estimates the effects of the predictors on the
probability of belonging to the reference category (primary,
secondary, and tertiary) as compared with each of the other cat-
egories of the dependent variable (primary-only/primary and
tertiary, and primary and secondary). However, according to
Concato, Feinstein, and Holford (1993), the results of logistic
regression models possessing fewer than 10 outcome events per
independent variable may be questionable as to accuracy, and
the tests of significance may be invalid. Therefore, because of
our small sample size in the primary, secondary, and tertiary
structure, we performed the analyses in two steps. First, we
used bivariate analyses to determine the relationship between
caregiving structure and each of the eight variables. Second, we
performed multinomial logistic regression using only the sig-
nificant predictors from the bivariate analyses.
In the bivariate analyses, we found that all four of the vari-
ables on the care recipients were significant, but none of the
caregiver variables were significant. Therefore, our multivari-

able model shown in Table 2 included only four care recipient
variables. The model shows that as a care recipient's ADL level
increases, the caregiving structure is less likely to be primary-
only/primary and tertiary, or a primary and secondary, than a
primary, secondary, and tertiary structure. As the care recipi-
ent's use of formal support increases, care is less likely to be
provided in a primary-only/primary and tertiary, or primary and
secondary structure, than a primary, secondary, and tertiary
structure. If the care recipient does poorly in meeting financial
needs (vs not doing poorly), the caregiving structure is more
likely to be primary-only/primary and tertiary, or primary and
secondary, than primary, secondary, and tertiary. As the number
of children living within one hour's drive of the care recipient
increases, care is less likely to be provided in a primary-
only/primary and tertiary structure, than a primary, secondary,
and tertiary structure. However, there was no difference in
whether care was provided in a primary and secondary versus a
primary, secondary, and tertiary structure based on the number
of children living within one hour's drive.
DISCUSSION
We found, as others have reported (Burton & Dilworth-
Anderson, 1991; Chatters et al., 1989; Dilworth-Anderson &
Anderson, 1994; Taylor & Chatters, 1986), that caring for older
dependent family members in African American families in-
volves different types of caregivers. In this study, we identified
and labeled these various caregivers as primary, secondary, and
tertiary based on their roles and responsibilities. The main care-
givers were organized into five caregiving structures (primary,
secondary, and tertiary; primary and secondary; primary and
tertiary; primary-only; and tertiary-only), which are similar to
those described by Keith (1995) and by Pyke and Bengston
(1996). Like those researchers, we found both individualistic
(involving one caregiver) and collectivist (involving two or
more caregivers) caregiving structures. However, almost three
fourths (74%) of the structures were collectivist in that they
were formed by two or more caregivers.
As expected, care recipients with greater dependency were
more likely cared for in larger structures. Care recipients in poor
financial condition were less likely to be cared for in larger struc-
tures. This is consistent with previous reports which show that
when family members' financial resources are limited, they
often have smaller levels of support available than do those with
morefinancialmeans (Benin & Keith, 1995; Murrell & Norris,
1991). In agreement with yet other findings (Dwyer & Miller,
1990; Himes, et al., 1996; Lawton, Rajagopal, Brody, & Kleban,
1992; Pruchno, Peters, & Burant, 1995), proximity of children
was important. The greater the number of children living within
one hour's drive, the more likely caregivers tended to use struc-
tures with larger levels of support.
We found no support for our hypothesis that the caregivers'
characteristics would help to predict caregiving structure. We
believe that these characteristics were not significant predictors,
in contrast to those reported in the caregiving literature on pre-
dominantly White samples, because they may not represent the
issues that are best suited for predicting caregiving structures
among African Americans. For example, historical evidence on
African American families helps to clarify why coresidence did
not predict caregiving structure in this study. Historians such as
Franklin and Moss (1994), Gutman (1976), and Jones (1985)
report that African Americans share households not only for
economic reasons, but also for cultural reasons, such as shared
values and beliefs about closeness and connectedness. We be-
lieve that these values and beliefs may create norms regarding
household sharing in the African American culture and thus
may reduce the stress and strain found in other groups residing
together. Nevertheless, we agree with other researchers
(Aquillo, 1990; Peek, Coward, & Peek, in press) that further re-
search is needed to explain why coresidence is more prevalent
among older African Americans than in other groups and to ac-
count for the effect of coresidence on caregivers' outcomes. In
fact, further studies with larger samples are needed for examin-
ing the full range of caregiving structures and testing our beliefs
that the effects of the independent variables in predicting care-
giving structure are not statistically different for primary-only
and primary and tertiary structures. A larger sample would also
provide the opportunity to examine the predictors of the ter-
tiary-only caregiving structure.
The major strengths of this study are that we identified the
different types of caregivers providing care to older dependent
African Americans according to their roles and responsibilities
and the amount of care they provided. We also identified care-
giving structures (individualistic and collectivist) that caregivers
use when providing care. Although we cannot make any con-
clusions about how different the types of caregivers and care-
giving structures identified in this study are from those that may
exist among other racial and ethnic groups, our findings can
provide information that can be used in future comparative
studies. Further, we make no claim that all African American
families with dependent elders use multiple caregivers and that
families organize themselves through defined caregiving struc-
tures when providing care. We do, however, purport that the
i
CAREGIVER TYPESAND STRUCTURES S241
findings reported in this study reflect and support the cultural
legacy of extended family caregiving to dependent family
members in African American families. In this instance, elderly
dependent members are most often cared for by two or more
people whose roles and responsibilities address their needs.
