Abstract
In this paper we theoretically and empirically examine how the interaction between
the formal court system and the informal loan network affects a household's decision
to start a business. We find that when the formal court system is weak, expansion of
informal credit network leads to the proliferation of business. However, with a
sufficiently strong court system, expansion of the credit network has a negative effect
on business prospects. This result is explained by the contradictions between formal
laws and norms used by informal networks.

1 Introduction
Effective contract enforcement is the key to the process of economic development. A
contract can be enforced by the formal legal court or by informal community courts, for
instance panchayats in South Asia. In less developed societies both types of institutions
co-exist, often coming in each others way. These conflicts are well documented in the
context of the marriage market and common property management (Chowdhry 2004;
Keremane et al. 2006; Madsen 1991; Nagraj 2010; Yadav 2009). However, till date there has
not been any study that analyzes and estimates the effect of such interactions on economic
decision making. In this paper we look at the effect of the interaction between the infor-
mal loan network and formal court system on the decision to run a business using both
analytical and quantitative methods. We find that the informal network helps in busi-
ness proliferation when the formal court system is weak. However, when the formal court
system improves sufficiently, business might fall in areas with strong informal networks.
Our paper is related to a vast body of literature that studies the effect of institutions
on economic development. There is a consensus among economists that better institu-
tions encourage capital accumulation and subsequent growth (Acemoglu et al. 2001, 2002;
Rajan and Zingales 1998). However, the existing empirical literature on the effectiveness
of formal institutions mostly look at the institutions of property rights which prevent the

elites from expropriating. One exception is Acemoglu and Johnson (2003), who distinguish
between the effects of property rights institutions and contracting institutions on growth.
Using a cross country data set, they find that while good property rights institutions have
a positive effect on growth, the effect of contracting institutions is not robust. This result
is counter intuitive, and one possible reason could be that their data, which only measures
the quality of formal contracting institutions, fails to account for the role of informal net-
work based institutions, ubiquitous in many developing countries. Evidence shows that
in the absence of effective formal courts of law, business often thrives under the infor-
mal institutions (Biggs and Shah 2006; McMillan and Woodruff 1999). In a related paper,
Harriss-White (2010) finds that in absence of effective formal institutions, Indian SMEs
are largely regulated by what she calls "social regulation." This is nothing but informal
institutions working through community networks and reputation mechanisms. The caste
system prevailing in India can also be seen as a grand framework of contract enforcement
using the reputation mechanism (Freitas 2006). The key to the success of such reputation
based mechanisms is information about one's past action (therefore reputation) flowing
in the community network (Ghosh and Ray 1996; Rosenthal and Landau 1979; Kandori
1992). Many credit institutions in less developed countries, such as ROSCA in East Asia
(Besley et al. 1993) and Grameen Bank in Bangladesh (Ghatak 1991), crucially depend on
such information flow within communities. The use of community level information for
enforcing contracts was also ubiquitous in medieval Europe (Greif et al. 1994; Greif 1993;
Slivinski and Sussman 2009).
Besides the general literature on institutions and its impact on economic growth, this
paper is also related to the role of networks in credit provisioning. Network membership,
which is often characterized by caste or ethnicity, may work both in positive and negative
ways. A number of studies found in the African context that community membership can
increase the probabilityof getting a loan if one's own community controls the supply of loans
(Biggs and Srivastava 2002; Fafchamps 2000,2003, Fisman 2003; Gajigo and Foltz 2010).
On the other hand, it may decrease the probability of getting loans if the credit granting
authority has any negative bias towards the credit applicants ethnicity. This result has
been confirmed by various studies in the context of the United States (Blanchflower et al.
2003; Fairlie and Robb 2007).
However, most of the literature on institutions look at formal and informal institutions
as separate phases of development ­ the informal system getting replaced by the formal
ones in due course of development (La Porta and Shleifer 2014). At best, some authors
have adopted a dual sector approach ­ making formal and informal two parallel sets of
rules without interfering with one another (Straub 2005). But in reality, formal and infor-
mal institutions interact and mutually constitute each other. Evidence suggests that social
capital affects formal economic behavior like financial decisions. Luigi et al. (2004) find
that in Italy people are more likely to use formal checks, invest less in cash and more in
stocks, have higher access to institutional credit and make less use of informal credit in
areas of high social capital. The effect of social capital is stronger in areas with weaker legal
enforcements. In a similar line of research, Karlan (2005) uses an experimental approach
to find the effect of social capital on financial decisions. The interaction between formal
institutions and informal norms also plays a role in the management of common prop-
erty resources. For example, Sandner (2003) looked at the interaction between formal
institutions and norms of the Kuna community in Central America for preservation of
Chakraborty et al. IZA Journal of Labor & Development (2015) 4:7 Page 3 of 21
marine resources. He shows that erosion of norms and insufficient development of formal
institutions can lead to over exploitation of marine resources.
The interaction between formal and informal institutions is particularly important in
less developed countries. In these countries de facto practices are quite different from de
jure rules ­ and these differences are often shaped by the interaction between formal and
informal institutions. The only theoretical exposition of such interactions that we have
come across is Dixit (2004) where he argues that the development of the formal may have
a detrimental effect on the informal mechanisms. The informal system relies heavily on
the reputation mechanism, where someone with a reputation of cheating does not get a
job within his/her community. People using formal contracts however do not care about
reputation ­ punishment under formal contracting is direct and enforced by a third party
(fine, imprisonment). Hence one can always cheat someone using the informal contract
and then find their next employment with another employer using a formal contract.
On the empirical front there has been much less research on this issue. One of the
few papers related to relevance of institutions in affecting business decisions is Chemin
(2012). He finds that reforms in the civil court procedureleads to lower breaches of contract,
higher access to capital and building of new capacity in India. However, what Chemin
finds is an average effect of more efficient courts. His research does not answer whether
the effect is different for areas with different initial conditions in terms of informal insti-
tutions (such as the presence of caste panchayat). We claim that the effect of better
legislation on business decisions will critically depend on these initial conditions. Another
closely related paper is Klapper et al. (2006). Their study, based on 34 Eastern and Western
European countries, find that higher requirements to comply with formal bureaucratic
regulation prevents new businesses from entering the industry by increasing entry cost.
The main contention of our paper is that formal and informal institutions might come
in the way of each other, producing undesired results in places where traditional, com-
munity based dispute resolving systems are widespread. We define a business in terms
of a contract where a contractor agrees to supply certain inputs to an entrepreneur. The
quality of the input cannot be verified beforehand or by any third party, creating a pos-
sible moral hazard problem. The only way to punish a cheater contractor is to fire him
and deny him any future employment opportunity. Hence, we have a structure similar to
Shapiro and Stiglitz (1984) and Greif (1993), where the only way to prevent cheating is to
pay the cheater contractor an honesty-inducing price for his input so that he finds that
cheating pays off is less than the honesty pay-off.
The entrepreneurs can come from a traditional producer community or someone com-
ing from outside the community. The latter group can only enter the market if the formal
contracting institutions are of sufficiently good quality. For entrepreneurs belonging to
the traditional community, the community norm requires them to boycott a contractor
who cheated any community member. This makes the cost of cheating someone very high
for the contractor, depressing the honesty inducing price of his input supplies.
We argue that in the presence of an effective formal system, the capacity to pun-
ish declines in the informal system. This is precisely because a strong formal system
allows entrepreneurs from outside the community to enter the market who do not abide
by the community norm of not hiring a past cheater. This makes it easy for a cheater
contractor (who cheated a community member in the past) to find employment with
an entrepreneur who does not belong to the community. This increases the honesty
Chakraborty et al. IZA Journal of Labor & Development (2015) 4:7 Page 4 of 21
inducing price for the input, pushing the entrepreneurs with small capital stock out of
the market.
Our theoretical model suggests that in areas with strong networks, an honesty inducing
input price is low, accommodating small entrepreneurs in the system. But as formal systems
improve (and consequently the input price rises), these areas are the worst hit as facing
the rising input prices, the entrepreneurs are forced to quit the market.
We use the India Human Development Survey (IHDS) 2004-2005 to test our theoretical
predictions. In accordance with the theoretical predictions, our empirical evidence sug-
gests that business is affected by the interplay of formal institutions and informal norms.
Specifically, when formal institutions are strong enough, we find that the probability of
doing businessis lower in the presenceof a large informal network. Given the cross-sectional
nature of the data, we should be careful in interpreting our results as causal.
However, this inference does not suggest the preservation of the informal institutions
by limiting the power of the formal courts. It rather emphasizes the possibility of jeopar-
dizing the expansion of business by imposing a rapid expansion of the formal contracting
system. There is no point in denying that improvement in formal contracting enhances
efficiency and social mobility by allowing contractors without any family/community con-
nection to enter the market. However, the preexistence of a strong informal institutional
framework, captured by large community networks, makes the rapid institutional switch
socially costly as it may exclude people from participating in the market. Most impor-
tantly, the exclusion comes from the high cost of accessing the formal institutions. Given
the efficiency property of formal institutions, the most logical implication of our research
is to reduce the cost of formal contracting.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the analytical model,
Section 3 outlines the empirical framework, Section 4 summarizes the data used to
test the implications of our model, Section 5 reports the empirical findings and, finally,
Section 6 concludes.
2 Model
2.1 Agents: contractors and entrepreneurs
There is a pool of potential entrepreneurs who produce a good G. For producing the
good G, they need an input X, which is supplied by a set of contractors who come from a
traditional X producing community C. The entrepreneurs however may come from both
the traditional community (C) and outside community (NC). The production of the input
requires high skill, but only a fraction of the community C has the skill ­ we call them
High type contractors. The rest of the contractors, who we call Low type, do not have the
necessary skill to supply the input. Therefore, if a low type is chosen, the entrepreneur
makes zero profit. Whether a contractor is High type is common knowledge within the
C community but not outside. So when a contractor from C community asks for work, a
typical NC entrepreneur cannot tell whether the contractor has the appropriate skill. This
however is common knowledge for a C entrepreneur For an NC entrepreneur, the first
problem is that of adverse selection ­ to be able to distinguish between the High and the
Low type.
However, there is a second level problem as well ­ the problem of moral hazard. Even
after a High type contractor is selected, he may supply bad quality input as it saves effort
for the contractor. Note that using a bad quality input for producing G is better than
Chakraborty et al. IZA Journal of Labor & Development (2015) 4:7 Page 5 of 21
hiring a Low type contractor. A Low type contractor is a fraud who does not have the
skill to produce the input even of bad quality. Hence, from an entrepreneur's perspective,
a High type supplying bad quality input yields a better outcome than hiring a Low type
contractor who cannot supply any input. We write the condition as follows:
0 <  < B < G, (1)
where  is the reservation income of the entrepreneur. j is his income by hiring the
high type contractor, where the contractor supplies quality j input (j = B, G). If the
entrepreneur hires the Low type contractor, he gets 0 profit, which is less than his reser-
vation pay-off. Hence, while choosing a contractor faces two types of problems, the first
one is a typical problem of adverse selection, and the second one is of moral hazard.
Before proceeding further let us discuss why both the moral hazard and adverse
selection problems are necessary for the formulation of our model.
The moral hazard and the adverse selection problems bring out the role that two types
of institutions ­ formal and informal ­ play. Let us first take the case of the moral haz-
ard problem where a contractor can shirk. The only punishment for cheating is not
hiring a cheater again. For entrepreneurs belonging to the entrepreneurial caste, if one
entrepreneur is cheated, all entrepreneurs belonging to the caste boycott the cheater con-
tractor. This makes the punishment cost of cheating a caste entrepreneur more than
cheating a non-caste member. The informal institutions in this case take the form of
information flow within the community. This information advantage allows the caste
entrepreneurs to impose the punishment on a cheating contractor. This is not possible
in the case of non-caste entrepreneurs due to the lack of credible information. Instead,
the non-caste members who cannot go to informal institutions solve the moral haz-
ard problem simply by paying a higher honesty-inducing wage than their caste member
counterpart. Note that this analysis does not require modeling of formal institutions.
The adverse selection problem, on the other hand, arises in the model because, ex-ante,
it is not possible to distinguish between the Low and the High type. Here comes the role of
formal institutions. The formal institutions of contract enforcement are essentially third
party enforcement (court, police etc). They solve this problem by punishing a Low type
contractor who poses as the High type contractor. The higher is the quality of the formal
institutions, the higher is the probability of catching and punishing a Low type mimicking
a High type. Therefore, the quality of formal institutions enters our analysis through the
channel of the adverse selection problem, making the adverse selection problem crucial
to our theory. Both the moral hazard and adverse selection problems are important in our
analysis because they are solved by the informal and formal institutions respectively.
The entrepreneurs can be characterized in two dimensions: community identity and
endowment. An entrepreneur i is endowed with business skill, or capital, i, and the
endowment is distributed according to the distribution . An entrepreneur i's output yi
is positively related to his endowment. There is another dimension of any entrepreneur
­ either he belongs to a traditional business community (C) or does not belong to
that community (NC). However, the distributions for  are the same for C and NC
type entrepreneurs. The main difference between C and NC types is in terms of
accessing informal institutions. Only C type entrepreneurs can access the informal net-
work for adjudicating any dispute with the contractors. However, both C and NC type
entrepreneurs can access the formal court. Note that the quality of an input (good or bad)
Chakraborty et al. IZA Journal of Labor & Development (2015) 4:7 Page 6 of 21
cannot be verified by the court. Hence, the court is only useful if a Low type contractor
misrepresented himself as a High type and took money for supplying the input.
The entrepreneur faces two levels of problems. Finding a High type is the first level of
the problem. In the second level, the entrepreneur has to ensure that the High type is not
behaving opportunistically ­ i.e., not supplying bad input after being hired.
2.2 Institutions
Let us now elaborate the role of institutions in solving the problems faced by the
entrepreneurs. There are two types of contracting institutions available in the economy.
One is formal courts characterized by third party enforcement and the second is informal
networks characterized by reputation based mechanisms. In what follows, we discuss the
different roles played by the formal versus informal institutions in solving the problem of
asymmetric information faced by the entrepreneurs.
2.3 Adverse selection problem: the role of court
We have already mentioned that there are two types of problems that an entrepreneur
faces: Low type posing as High type, and after recruitment, high type supplying bad quality
input. From the entrepreneur's point of view, a low type contractor (who can only supply
zero input) is worse than hiring a high type who supplies bad quality. There are two ways
of catching and punishing a Low type.
The informal network of C members possesses the information regarding its member's
skillfulness, i.e., everybody in the community knows which member in the community
does not have the necessary training to produce X. Hence, no Low type contractor is
hired by a C type entrepreneur. In other words, belonging to the community network
solves the problem of adverse selection for a C entrepreneur. But NC entrepreneurs can-
not access this information about the true type of the contractor, ex-ante. Instead, the NC
entrepreneurs can sign a formal contract with a potential contractor, and if he turns out to
be the Low type, they can file a lawsuit against the Low type posing as High and get the Low
type punished with probability , where,  is the quality of the formal court. Hence, with
a sufficiently strong formal court, Low type community members will not pose as a High
type member. In general, mimicking the High type is not worthwhile for the Low type if
(P - M) + (1 - )(P) < 0, (2)
where P is the price that the low type gets by posing as the High type, and M is the penalty
he pays if he gets caught. The reservation pay-off of the Low type is 0. The condition tells
us that there will be no Low type posing as High type if
 >
P
M
=  (3)
For  < the quality of formal institutions is so bad that Low types can mimic High types
and get away with it. This makes the NC type entrepreneurs find that it is not worthwhile
to join the market. For low enough sigma, all Low types mimic as high types, and given
that C type entrepreneurs already know who is Low type, there is a very high probability
that NC type entrepreneurs are matched with Low type. This leads to our first theorem:
Chakraborty et al. IZA Journal of Labor & Development (2015) 4:7 Page 7 of 21
Theorem 2.1. For a sufficiently high quality of formal institutions (), Low types do
not find it worthwhile to mimic the High type, and as a result, NC entrepreneurs enter the
market.
2.4 The moral hazard problem
Unlike adverse selection, the moral hazard problem however cannot be solved by any
third party as the quality of the input is not verifiable by the third party. Only the
entrepreneur can find out the quality of the input, and the punishment she can inflict
is not hiring a cheater contractor for subsequent periods. The monetary value of the
punishment can be measured by a wage that a contractor loses if he is fired. We follow
the efficiency wage theory framework proposed by Shapiro and Stiglitz (1984) and Greif
(1993) for analyzing the solution to the moral hazard problem.
We start with the case where ( < ), and only C type entrepreneurs operate. C
entrepreneurs solve the adverse selection problem of selecting the High type through the
information network. Hence, they face the moral hazard problem only ­ the problem
of ensuring that High type supplies good quality input. The entrepreneur can solve the
problem by offering a payment to the contractor so that the cheating pay-off is less than
the honesty pay-off. This section is modeled after Greif (1993).
The contractor supplies one unit of the input to the entrepreneur and gets a payment
. If he supplies bad quality input, he saves some cost  but at the end of the period gets
fired. However, there is an exogenous probability of terminating the contract given by q.
In that case, if the contractor is honest, he is hired again. For characterizing the honesty
inducing equilibrium, we define the following expressions:
The pay-off for an honest agent is given by
Vh
=  + (1 - q)Vh
+ qVu
h
(4)
This shows that the lifetime payoff of an honest contractor can be divided in to current
and future pay-offs. In the current period an honest agent gets factor payment . In the
next period, however, she might get fired for an exogenous reason with probability q and
continue to get Vu
h
­ the lifetime pay off of an honest unemployed agent. On the other
hand, the agent may stay in the job with probability 1 - q and continue to earn an honest
employed agent's pay-off ­ Vh. The future pay offs are discounted by the discount rate .
By cheating, an agent gets a one time pay-off  in the current period. However, this one
time payment comes at the cost of losing his job at the end of the current period. From
the next period onwards he gets the pay-off of an unemployed cheater. An unemployed
cheater can be rehired with probability pc in the next period and get Vh. With probability
(1 - pc
) a cheater is not re-hired, and he gets reservation wage (). The pay-off for an
unemployed cheater, Vu
c
, is summarized by the following equation:
Vu
c
= pcVh
+  (1 - pc)  + Vu
c
(5)
An honest agent can also lose her job for exogenous reasons. However, she may be rehired
with probability ph in the next period and get Vh. On the other hand, with probability
(1 - ph
) she may remain unemployed and get  + Vu
h
­ reservation pay-off plus life
time utility of an honest unemployed agent.
Vu
h
= phVh
+  (1 - ph
)  + Vu
h
(6)
Chakraborty et al. IZA Journal of Labor & Development (2015) 4:7 Page 8 of 21
The payment to a contractor () that prevents her from cheating must satisfy the
condition
Vh
  + Vu
c
(7)
It is easy to understand that no entrepreneur has any incentive to pay a  more than the
minimum honesty-inducing payment.
Theorem 2.2. A contractor's honesty inducing payment is rising in the probability of
rehiring a cheater agent.
We provide the formal proof in the appendix. But the intuition of this theorem is quite
straight forward. The only punishment an entrepreneur can inflict is firing the agent,
which involves the monetary cost of the forgone payment. If the cheater agents can eas-
ily be rehired, the cost of losing the current job is low. In that case the input price (that
he misses because of getting fired) needs to be big enough to prevent one from cheating.
So we have  = (pc
),  > 0. We assume that community members will not appoint a
contractor who has cheated another community member, i.e., in the environment where
all the entrepreneurs are type C, we get pc
= 0. This is possible due to the flow of infor-
mation within the community of a C type entrepreneur. However, an NC type contractor
cannot access any such information. Hence, she cannot distinguish between an agent who
cheated in the past and the one who did not. For her pc
= ph
> 0, this leads to the next
corollary:
Corollary 2.3. The honesty inducing payment for the contractors hired by NC
entrepreneurs is higher than that for the ones hired by the C entrepreneurs.
2.5 The interaction effect
First we analyze how the improvements in the formal court system affects the C type
entrepreneurs. The improvements in the formal court system do not directly affect C
type entrepreneurs. It affects the C type by facilitating the entry of the NC type. NC type
entrepreneurs can only enter the market if the formal institutions are good enough to
solve the adverse selection problem. Hence, a good court allows the NC entrepreneurs
to enter the market. Once in the market, the NC entrepreneurs solve the moral hazard
problem the same way the C entrepreneurs solve the problem, i.e., paying the honesty-
inducing price. But the entry of NC entrepreneurs will have an indirect impact on the C
entrepreneurs as the equilibrium price for the input will go up, reducing the profit margin
of the existing C entrepreneurs. This determines the number of C entrepreneurs. Who
are the C entrepreneurs running businesses? The entrepreneurs with endowment i will
be in business such that
i
(i
)  , (8)
where  is the equilibrium price for the input. Solving (8) for equality, we get the lowest
endowment entrepreneur that can be in the business  = (), where  is rising in .
From this we get our next proposition
Chakraborty et al. IZA Journal of Labor & Development (2015) 4:7 Page 9 of 21
Theorem 2.4. The cut-off endowment level of the entrepreneurs is a function of the input
price, and the cut-off goes up as the input price goes up
If the equilibrium input price () goes up, only the entrepreneurs with sufficiently high
endowment can stay in the market. As the input price goes up following the entry of
the NC type entrepreneurs, the cut-off endowment level goes up. Let us now look at
the volume of business following the entry of the NC entrepreneurs. Entry of the NC
entrepreneurs increases the number of NC business, but it decreases the number of the C
entrepreneurs as the cut-off endowment level gets revised upwards. Hence, theoretically,
the net effect is ambiguous, making the empirical investigation important.
Suppose the number of possible community entrepreneurs is Mc. In period 0 we do
not have any NC entrepreneur in the market. So the number of businesses is equal to
the probability that a potential C entrepreneur will start a business times MC. Suppose
in period 0 the cut off endowment level was 0. Hence the total number of businesses is
given by
B0
= MC
× (1 - (0
)) (9)
In period 1, NC entrepreneurs enter, and as a result, input price goes up, moving the cut-
off endowment level to 1
> 0 for both C and NC entrepreneurs as they both face the
same input price. Hence, while new entrants (NC entrepreneurs) add to the volume of
business, the quitting community entrepreneurs reduce it, making the net effect ambigu-
ous. Assume that the pool of potential NC entrepreneurs is MN . The volume of NC
businesses is given by
BN
1
= MN
× (1 - (1
)) (10)
The number of community businesses in period 1 is given by
BC
1
= MC
× (1 - (1
)) (11)
Hence, total business in period 1 is given by
B1
= MN
× (1 - (1)) + MC
× (1 - (1)) (12)
The change in business is given by
B1
- B0
= MN (1 - (1)) - MC ( (1) - (0)) (13)
From this we get B0 B1 according to
MN
MC
( (1) - (0)
(1 - (1))
(14)
Theoretically we do not have any clear cut answer as to whether entry of NC
entrepreneurs will lead to an increase or decrease in the number of businesses. This
depends on the relative size of the pool of C and NC entrepreneurs and the shape of
the endowment distribution. The larger is the value of MC compared to MN , the more
likely it is that with the improvement in the formal institutions (and consequently entry
of the NC entrepreneurs), total number of businesses will fall. This will happen when the
new entry will not be sufficient to cover for the exit of the community entrepreneurs.
In other words, the entrants come from the upper tail of the endowment distribution,
while the quitters come from the lower tail. Hence, total business will shrink if the lower
tail is denser than the upper tail. This should be the case for a less developed country
Chakraborty et al. IZA Journal of Labor & Development (2015) 4:7 Page 10 of 21
characterized by inequality, where the number of people belonging to the upper wealth
percentile is less than that in the lower percentile.
Next we review the interaction effect between the formal and the informal institutions
and its effect on the volume of business. In the previous sections we have assumed that
there is one homogeneous community network where the probability of rehiring a cheater
is zero. We now extend this set up by introducing heterogeneity in terms of commu-
nity network. We assume that there are n districts, and each district j is characterized by
network size j. We further assume that the probability of rehiring a cheater is a falling
function of the network size
pj
c
= g(j
), (15)
where g < 0. This assumption implies that in a district characterized by big network, a
large number of people know about one's cheating history, and the cheater finds it difficult
to get a job. Let us now elaborate how the improvements in the formal court system affects
districts with different degrees of networks differently.
In other words, we examine the role of interaction between the existing informal net-
work mechanism and the formal institutions in determining the volume of business. In
period 0, the larger the network, lower is the probability for a cheater contractor to be
rehired, and lower is the input price. Hence, in a district characterized by a larger net-
work, the cutoff endowment level for the C entrepreneurs is lower than that in a district
with a smaller network. This means
0
= (), (16)
where  represents the size of the network and  () < 0. This means that the value of
0 is low in high network districts. Given that 1 is determined by the cut-off level of the
NC entrepreneurs, which has nothing to do with the existing network size, the expression
( (1
) - (0
)) is rising in the network size. Since the size of the quitting businesses is
rising in ( (1
) - (0
), we get the following theorem
Theorem 2.5. If formal institutions improve, sufficiently allowing the NC entrepreneurs
to set up business, the reduction in the community businesses will be higher in high network
districts than that in the low network districts. If the negative impact of the quitting C
entrepreneurs is strong enough, this will lead to greater reduction in the total volume of
business in the districts with higher networks.
We next turn to the empirical section to test the implications of our model using data
from India.
3 Empirical specification
Empirically, a way to test the theoretical predictions would be to estimate a regression
of the probability of doing business on the the interaction between formal and infor-
mal institutions using panel data. A panel setting would enable us to estimate the effect
of introducing formal institutions in an economy with pre-existing informal institutions.
However, in the absence of any longitudinal information, we only provide suggestive
evidence on our theoretical predictions. Specifically, we compare districts with varying
Chakraborty et al. IZA Journal of Labor & Development (2015) 4:7 Page 11 of 21
degrees of informal and formal institutions using cross sectional data. In particular, we
estimate the following specification:
P(SE)id
= 0
+ 1INd
 FCd
+ 2INd
+ 3FCd
+ Xid
+ id, (17)
where P(SE)id reflects the probability with which a household i in district d chooses to
be self-employed over being wage employed. INd is a proxy for the quality of informal
institutions in district d. FCd is a proxy for the quality of formal institutions in district d.
The interaction between INd and FCd is our main variable of interest. According to the-
oretical predictions of our model, a positive 2 would imply that a higher proportion of
households choose to do business when the informal network is large, which thereby helps to
facilitate information flow within the network. Additionally, 1 captures the impact of for-
mal institutions on the relationship between informal institutions and self-employment.
Specifically, a negative 1 would imply that when the quality of formal institutions increasess
businesses would exit from areas with a greater prevalence of informal institutions. Similarly,
3 captures the independent effect of the quality of formal institutions on probability of self
employment. A positive 3 implies that as the quality of formal institution improves,
businesses would flourish as it enables some new entrepreneurs to enter the market.
Note however that informal and formal institutions might evolve endogenously at the
district level. One way to deal with this could be to use historical data to capture the intro-
duction of the formal court system.1 However, we cannot adopt this approach due to the
paucity of such data. Instead, we try to control for a range of household and district level
controls captured in Xid. Specifically, we include religion, caste, education, amount of loan
taken, any caste-group membership at the household level and availability of formal loans
at the district level.
4 Data
We use data from the India Human Development Survey (IHDS) for this study. The IHDS
is a nationally representative survey of 41,554 households interviewed in 2004 and 2005
(Desai et al. 2009). Surveyed households are distributed across 382 of India's 602 districts.
Our study covers households which are either self-employed, wage employed or unem-
ployed. This leads to a sample size of 34,521 households across 373 districts in our study.
For our dependent variable we use the information on employment status of different
members of a household to create a household level variable of self-employment status.
We define a household to be self employed if at least one member in the household owns a
business in the non-agricultural sector. A household is defined to be wage-employed if at
least one member is wage-employed, and no one is self-employed. A household is defined
to be unemployed if no one in the household is employed.2
Our main variables of interest are informal and formal institutional quality. In
equation 17, we proxy informal institutions, INd, by the fraction of households in a dis-
trict d that takes loans from informal sources, viz., friends, relatives and community
credit groups.3 In general, an informal loan network not only captures the extent of loans
available in a district, but it also reflects the close association between members of the
network. A larger size of the informal network facilitates flow of information within the
network and helps in enforcing the reputation mechanism.
The quality of formal institutions is captured by the perceived quality of formal courts
of law. We measure FCd as the fraction of households in a district d which perceives the
Chakraborty et al. IZA Journal of Labor & Development (2015) 4:7 Page 12 of 21
judiciary to be strong.4 Specifically, the survey asks households to rank different institu-
tions on a scale of one to three, where three signifies the least confidence in a particular
institution, and one signifies the highest confidence. We consider the perceived court
quality to be strong when a household's ranking of court efficiency is one.
Table 1 provides the summary of our estimation sample. About 23% of our full sample
is self employed. However, when we disaggregate by sector, we find a much higher preva-
lence of self employment in the urban sector ­ about 29% of the sample is self-employed
in urban as opposed to 19% in the rural sector. This has implications for the importance
of the relationship between self-employment and institutional quality, which we revisit in
Section 5.1. When we look at the prevalence of informal networks, we find that about 12%
of the full sample has borrowed from informal sources. Moreover, the extent of informal-
ity is not very different between urban and rural sectors. With respect to the quality of
formal courts, 53% of our full sample perceive the court to be efficient. Once again, the
difference in perception is small between urban and rural sectors. The availability of for-
mal loans is higher in rural areas, possibly reflecting the higher prevalence of government
rural banks providing agricultural loans. However, as expected, the average size of loans
is much higher in urban regions. Table 1 additionally reports the means for the other
control variables that we use in our empirical specification.

5 Results
Table 2 reports the results from a linear estimation of equation 1. The outcome vari-
able reflects the probability of a household being self-employed compared to being wage
employed. Column 1 includes a measure of informality at the district level (IId), an indi-
cator for strong institutions(SId), and an interaction between the two. Since our variables
of interest vary only at the district level, we report clustered standard errors at the district
level in all specifications.
The results in column 1 indicate a nonlinear relationship between the degree of infor-
mality and self employment. The coefficient on informal networks by itself suggests that a
greater extent of informality in a district predicts a higher probability of self-employment.
However, this relationship depends on the strength of formal institutions. Specifically, the
negative coefficient on the interaction term implies a nonlinear relationship. This can be
seen from the following equation.
Pr(SE)
IId
= -1SId
+ 2 (18)

. This means that greater
informal networks positively affect the probability of starting a business as long as the
quality of the formal court is below a certain threshold. However as the formal institutions
become sufficiently strong, a higher number of business would quit in areas with larger
informal networks.

More specifically the coefficients can be interpreted in the following way. In column 1,
the estimates imply that the threshold level of formal institutions is given by 0.54 (2
/1
).
Hence, districts where more than 54% of the households perceive the judiciary to be
strong are above the threshold level of formal institutions. Now consider two districts
within this group ­ one with a low prevalence of informal networks (DLI
) and another
with a high prevalence of informal networks (DHI
). Then our coefficients imply that the
probability of self employment is lower in DHI compared to DLI.5 Specifically, if 60% of
households perceive the court to be efficient, then a one unit difference in the extent of
informal networks between DHI and DLI leads to a 10 percentage point lower probability
of self employment in DHI compared to DLI districts.
Conversely, now consider the situation where the level of formal institutions is less than
the threshold level of 0.5. Consider the same two districts, DHI and DLI. Here our coeffi-
cients imply that the the probability of self employment is higher in DHI compared to DLI.
Specifically, if only 40% of the households in a district perceive the court to be strong, a
one unit higher level of informal networks leads to a 10 percentage point higher likelihood
of doing business.
Next we add a number of control variables to the above basic specification. It is possible
that districts with greater availability of informal loans also have a higher availability of
any loan so that `IN' simply captures the extent of the total loan availability in the district
instead of the extent of informality. Hence, we control for the availability of formal loans
in the district in column 2. The coefficients indicate similar effects of informality.
Column 3 includes a proxy for the credit worthiness of a household indicated by the
maximum amount of loan taken. Results remain unchanged here as well. The coefficient
on the control variable suggests the obvious that if a household has taken a larger amount
of loan, it is more likely to start a business.
Column 4 controls for other household level characteristics like religion, caste and an
indicator whether a household has any literate member. The results are in the same spirit
as before. The coefficients on High Caste and Education are as expected. More educated
households and traditionally higher castes are more likely to be self employed. Hindu
households, on the contrary, are less likely to self employed compared to households from
other religious backgrounds.
Finally, in column 5 we also control for household participation in a caste network since
that might increase both a household's probability of getting a loan and starting a business.
Results remain the same as before. Moreover, as expected, household participation in a
caste network increases the probability of self-employment.
To further verify that our results are not sensitive to varied specifications, we carry out
the following robustness check. In Table 3 we include unemployment in the reference
category. We now compare the probability of self employment with wage employment
and unemployment. The results remain unaffected by the inclusion of unemployment in
the reference category. The coefficients on the interaction term and informal institutions
show similar nonlinear effects of informal networks on business decision, depending on
the extent of formal institutions.
5.1 Heterogeneity analysis
In Table 1 we observe that the incidence of self-employment is much higher in urban
areas compared to rural areas. Hence, in Table 4, we estimate the relationship separately

for rural and urban regions.6 The results discussed in Table 2 are primarily driven by the
urban region. Informality by itself or its interaction with formal institutions doesn't play
a significant role in predicting self employment for the rural region. It is possible that the
link between informality and self employment is more relevant for the urban region which
is characterized by a higher prevalence of self-employment.
In general, it should be easier to start a new business in the presence of a large infor-
mal network because it facilitates the flow of information and provides easy access to
loans. However, according to our theoretical predictions, the presence of a large informal
network would also lead to a greater exodus of businesses when the quality of formal insti-
tutions crosses a threshold. To re-examine these possibilities we conduct a heterogeneity
analysis by estimating our model separately for the extent of association of households
in various caste organizations. In districts where a large fraction of households partici-
pate in caste networks, there would be a greater flow of information within the network.
Consequently, it would be easier to enforce contracts using the informal system of the
reputation mechanism and facilitate business opportunities. We define a district to have a
strong caste network if a larger share of households in a district participate in caste organi-
zations.7 Table 5 reports the results from this analysis. A one percentage point increase in
the size of informal networks leads to a 0.52 percentage point higher probability of doing
business in districts with large caste networks. In comparison, a one percentage point
increase in the size of informal networks leads to a 0.32 percentage point higher probabil-
ity of doing business in districts with small caste networks. Additionally, the coefficient

on the interaction term shows that the fall in business opportunities is higher in districts
with large caste networks when the quality of the formal court is above a threshold.
Finally, we also investigate how a greater influx of NC entrepreneurs affects our base-
line relationship. Specifically, we look at the extent of migration into and out of a
district as it determines the composition of the pool of entrepreneurs within a dis-
trict. A higher number of out-of-community entrepreneurs is likely to be present in
high-migration compared to low-migration districts.8 Analogously, a higher number of
low-endowment community entrepreneurs will operate in low migration districts. In
this situation when the formal institutions become sufficiently strong, there would be a
greater exit of low-endowment entrepreneurs from the low-migration districts. In other
words, since high-migration districts would have a larger number of high-endowment
out-of-community entrepreneurs to begin with, the interaction between informal net-
work and formal courts will have a much weaker effect than the low-migration districts,
which are populated by low-endowment entrepreneurs. Therefore, we conduct a hetero-
geneity analysis separately for districts with high and low migration in the urban region
as presented in Table 6. We define a district to have high migration if the fraction of
migrants in that district is greater than the median. In accordance with our theoretical
predictions, the informal network and its interaction with the formal court matters for
self-employment in districts with low-migration, possibly due to a greater prevalence of
community entrepreneurs. We do not find any significant relationship for the districts
with high-migration.

6 Conclusion
The relation between the informal and formal institutions of contract enforcement is
usually seen as substitutional ­ the former being replaced by the latter in the course
of economic development. The experiences of developing countries, however, show that
these two type of institutions co-exist. Understanding the nature of their interaction
therefore becomes crucial for designing optimal institutions. In this paper we model the
interaction between these two types of institutions and its effect on the prospect of running
a business. We test the implications of the model using household level data for India.
The informal institutions of contract enforcement, which works on a reputation based
mechanism, are critical for the operations of micro-entrepreneurs who cannot access
costly formal institutions for enforcing the contracts. Unlike the formal institutions which
depend on the legal system for enforcing contracts, the informal institutions punish a
cheater by denying him any future employment. However, such mechanisms are limited to
certain communities where members abide by the community norm of not employing one
who has cheated someone from that community. The system gets weaker if entrepreneurs
start violating this norm. The rise of formal institutions allows non-community members
to enter the market who do not follow such norms. This, in our analysis, significantly
weakens the effectiveness of the informal institutions.
Our theoretical result shows that as long as the quality of formal institutions is below a
threshold level, strong informal networks help in business proliferation. However, when
the formal institutions get sufficiently strong, they come in the way of the informal ones

(following the mechanism we detailed above) and increase the cost of running businesses.
This affects the poorer entrepreneurs more adversely than their more well off coun-
terparts because it is the small capitalists who find running business using the formal
mechanism not profitable enough. We test our theoretical predictions using IHDS data
and find support for our theoretical results. We plan to extend our analysis in the future
by constructing a panel using administrative data on court quality. Additionally, future
waves of IHDS data would allow us to observe the evolution of informal institutions over
time. This will help us to provide more convincing evidence.
The main result of our paper apparently warns against the possible backlash of strength-
ening the formal institutions in a less developed country that is characterized by strong
informal institutions. Our position, however, does not endorse maintenance of informal
mechanisms. Instead, we emphasize that informal institutions, even though inefficient,
are crucial for the micro-entrepreneurs to run their businesses. The implications of our
paper are two fold: first, strong formal and strong informal institutions create a negative
impact on the probability of doing business; more importantly, such negative impacts typ-
ically force the capital poor section of the entrepreneurs to quit the market. Hence, even if
the strengthening of formal institutions may lead to efficient outcomes in the long run, it
increases inequality in the short run. The main contribution of our paper is to emphasiz-
ing this trade off which is often neglected in the institutions-entrepreneurship literature.
The policy implication should lead to a better designing of formal institutions so that the
exclusion of micro-entrepreneurs can be prevented.

1One such study is done by Kranton and Swamy (1999) who conduct a descriptive
analysis of the effect of court systems on agricultural credit markets using historical data
from British India.
2We also define a separate category as agricultural household if at least one member
owns agricultural land or is employed in agriculture and no one is self-employed or
wage-employed. However, we did not include this reference category in our analysis
because they form a very small fraction of the total number of households.
3All our district level estimates are computed as a fraction of the total number of
households in a district.
4Note that the formal court quality measure might suffer from measurement error
problems as it is based on household perception, implying that our estimates form a
lower bound. We plan to collect administrative data related to court quality to construct
a more precise measure.

From equations (11) and (15), we find
T + Tq [T1h
+ T2hw] 

1 - T1c
+
T2c
1 - T1c
w (32)
From this we get
T[ 1 + TqT1h] 

1 - T1c
+
T2c
1 - T1c
w - TqT2hw (33)
This leads to the condition
 
1
T 1 + TqT1h
×

1 - T1c
+
T2c
1 - T1c
w - TqT2hw (34)
Recall that
1
1 - T1c
= 1 +

1 - 
pc (35)
and
T2c
1 - T1c
=
(1 - pc
)
1 - 
(36)
Hence, we find,

pc
=
1
T 1 + TqT1h
× ( - w)

1 - 
(37)
This expression is positive as long as  - w > 0, which tells us that the one time cheating
payoff is more than the reservation payoff. This has to be the case because the industry
payoff is more than the reservation wage, and the one time cheating payoff is more than
the industry payoff.
