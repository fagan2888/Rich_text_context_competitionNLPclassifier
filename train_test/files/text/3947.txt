Article
Brazilian nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) with mis-
sions centered on the sustainable preservation of land, water,
forests, and other environmental factors have garnered much
attention because of rapid deforestation in the Amazon,
global concerns about the ozone layer, water and energy
issues, and effects on indigenous ways of life and knowledge
as well as the Brazilian economy (Correia, 2016). With pub-
licity and events surrounding the 2016 Olympics, reports cel-
ebrated the human and bio-diversity in Brazil but also
displayed the poverty, political instabilities, and crime in
Brazil, as well as consequences of the Brazilian Zika virus
(Cugola et al., 2016). With such broad and deep opportuni-
ties and needs in Brazil, NGOs feel pressures from diverse
sectors and challenges inherent in the meanings and conduct
of sustainability work itself.
Specifically, Brazilian NGO and global professionals
engaging in sustainability efforts, find that they must manage
tensions in their political positions, social practices, and
daily activities (Fátima do Carmo Guerra, dos Santos de
Sousa Teodosio, & Mswaka, 2016; Mackin, 2016; see Mitra
& Buzzanell, 2017). These tensions are symbolic as they
enact work that they perceive to be meaningful but frustrat-
ing, and material as they seek impact through short-term
deliverables but struggle with long-term solutions within
complex interdependent human and material systems (Fátima
do Carmo Guerra et al., 2016; Mitra & Buzzanell, 2017).
Tensions also emerge in their internal and external ethical
responsibilities, including their communicative labor.
According to Mumby (2016; see also Carlone, 2008),
communicative labor refers to processes of mutuality,
authenticity, and affect through which people share experi-
ences. Applied to branding, communicative labor is key to
the creation of value in work, production and consumption,
and erosion of personal life through emphasis on labor
(Mumby, 2016; see also communicative labor affirming
hard work as virtuous, in Dempsey & Sanders, 2010).
Applied to NGOs, Dempsey (2009) explores how grassroots
organizations, particularly environmental justice and sus-
tainability NGOs, engage in communication labor, defined
here as the creation of distinctive organizational identities

NGO Organizing for Environmental
Sustainability in Brazil: Meaningful Work,
Commonality, and Contradiction
Marlene Marchiori1 and Patrice M. Buzzanell2
Abstract
Through our case study of a Brazilian not-for-profit focused on sustainability initiatives, we expand knowledge about
communicative labor in different Brazilian organizational environments, especially in the third (nonprofit/nongovernmental)
sector. Based on a case study for which thematic analyses of in-depth interviews with the entire nongovernmental organization
(NGO), including its board and staff, were conducted, we found three communicative labor processes that displayed how
members entered into, thought about, performed, embodied, and sustained interaction in ways that are considered to
be a hallmark of the particular Brazilian third-sector organization that we studied. The three processes of communicative
labor--depicting NGO work as meaningful labor, producing commonality and difference, and transcending contradictions--
enabled NGO members to withstand difficulties and engage productively in the tensions of doing communicative labor in
Brazilian environmental work. Despite the volatile political-economic and diverse cultural environment in Brazil, the NGO's
communication enabled them to adapt to and proactively shape environmental efforts, thus modeling sustainability and
resilience.

that promote work to which NGOs are ideologically and
practically committed. Through her case study, Dempsey
examines how diverse organizational discourses are under-
stood by varied stakeholders, including organizational
members. Communicative labor praises and blames, rede-
fines problems, establishes the goodness of certain actions
and decisions, and determines who is included within the
purviews of organizing. Communicative labor and associ-
ated discourses are moral and political insofar as the calling
to such work is perceived and enacted as greater than one-
self and the processes through which work is accomplished
are strategic, political, and material as well as discursive
(i.e., "how nonprofits mobilize discourses, and how these
discourses themselves carry their own sets of politics and
forms of power," Dempsey, 2012, p. 149; see also Mitra &
Buzzanell, 2017).
Our goal is to depict and analyze the communicative labor
of Brazilian environmental sustainability work as a tensional
approach (Mitra & Buzzanell, 2017; Putnam, Fairhurst, &
Banghart, 2016; Trethewey & Ashcraft, 2004). We present
the case of a Brazilian nonprofit NGO called "MeioAmbiente
Equilibrado" (MAE), meaning "Balanced Environment"
(see http://www.ongmae.org.br/), for which the first author
secured permission to identify. As noted earlier, Brazil has a
critical role in the global ecological system. Its political-eco-
nomic-cultural complexities and paradoxes provide a forum
to study communicative labor aligned with Putnam's (2012;
see also Putnam & Mumby, 2014; Stohr, 2015) call for com-
munication scholarship that promotes an internationalization
agenda and attends to organization-society problematics. As
Putnam and Mumby (2014) noted, organizational communi-
cation scholars "examine the relationships between organi-
zations and their broader societal structures by exploring
such issues as social justice, corporate social responsibility,
social movements, and corporate identity in a globalized
world" (p. 11). Central questions have to do with identities,
responsibilities, and democratic organizing processes. We
attend to the ways that members of a Brazilian environmen-
tal agency perceive the meanings and meaningfulness of
their work and the tensions that they experience in doing
communicative labor that enables sustainability.
To pursue our goals, we begin by providing an overview
of communicative labor and tensional approaches to lay the
groundwork for our case study about a NGO in Brazil dedi-
cated to environmental sustainability efforts. We detail our
interview and document data and thematic analysis proce-
dures and then discuss three processes of communicative
labor--depicting NGO work as meaningful labor, producing
commonality and difference, and transcending contradic-
tions--that enable NGO members to perform their work
despite disruptions and obstacles and to model strategic
interaction processes. We close with our theoretical and
pragmatic contributions and their implications for communi-
cative labor, sustainability discourses and materialities, and
community resilience.
Literature Review
In this section, we frame communicative labor from a ten-
sional theoretical approach and then we discuss Brazilian
environmental NGOs, focusing on one NGO in particular.
First, communicative labor encourages action "in the name
of doing good" (Dempsey, 2007). In NGOs, communicative
labor can involve generation of locale-specific, paradoxical,
and neocapitalistic appeals (e.g., Stahelin, Accioly, &
Sánchez, 2015; Stohr, 2015). At its heart, communicative
labor is materialist and communicative insofar as labor gener-
ates value through its embodiment of creativity and coopera-
tion (Greene, 2004). Analyses of communicative labor offer
insight into the ways in which doing work can both perpetu-
ate and lessen inequalities through adherence to "parameters
set by others" and disregard of the "wicked problems" cen-
tered in ethical-capitalistic paradoxes (Alvesson & Willmott,
2002, p. 624; Carlone, 2008; Fyke & Buzzanell, 2013; Putnam
& Mumby, 2014).
Taking a tension-centered approach enables a focus on
process, specifically the ongoing sense making and ethical
decision making that enable people to embody values and
ideological beliefs more or less into everyday action (e.g.,
D'Enbeau & Buzzanell, 2011). This approach foregrounds
the ironies and complexities at discursive and material inter-
sections while noting that contexts, identity negotiations,
and knowledge shift. It means that organization members
are constantly in the process of organizing thus enabling
changes when proposed interventions do not seem to be pro-
ductive. As such, a tensional approach destabilizes realities.
It encourages communicative labor, enacts resistance and
complicity, fosters and closes options, and recognizes that
organizing can only be constituted through navigation of
discursive-material tensions (Putnam & Boys, 2006;
Trethewey & Ashcraft, 2004). For Mitra and Buzzanell's
(2017) examination of sustainability work, a tension-cen-
tered approach to sustainability professionals' efforts and
careers illuminates the nuances, complexities, and contesta-
tions in meaningful work.
Specifically, Mitra and Buzzanell (2017) found that the
sustainability professionals (n = 45, from seven different
countries) whom they interviewed found their work to be
meaningful through the ways in which they could enlighten
businesses, engage in direct interactions with stakeholders,
and negotiate political cultures. They reported feeling not
only compelled and gratified to engage in this labor but also
challenged emotionally, intellectually, and physically.
Challenges and opportunities arose from lack of resources,
efforts to frame their efforts in ways that produce desired
results or, at least, open stakeholder interactions to further
conversation. They constantly navigated the need to produce
deliverables with the complexities of long-term solutions
(see also D'Enbeau & Buzzanell, 2011). Finally, they drew
meaningfulness from the internal and external sources of
work valuation, as well as their commitments and abilities to
Marchiori and Buzzanell 3
work somewhat autonomously (admitting that their autono-
mies could also be isolating and detracting). As Dempsey
(2009, 2012) noted, distinct environmental NGO identities
bridge overarching ideological and practical tensions through
communicative labor. This communicative labor frames the
efficacy of action. It also redefines and revalues aspects and
negotiates inclusion in ongoing discursive-material work--
processes that contribute to and detract from perceived
meanings and meaningfulness of work and the very ways in
which sustainability is accomplished.
To contribute to greater understandings of communicative
labor in international organizational communication arenas,
we examine internal NGO discourses and their consequences
through an empirical study of Brazilian third-sector organiz-
ing, specifically of an environmental sustainability group,
located in Londrina, within the state of Paraná. In Brazil,
NGOs (or ONGs, the Brazilian acronym for NGOs) have sig-
nificantly increased in number with estimates reaching
338,000 by ABONG, the Brazilian Non-Governmental
Organization (Mello, 2012) and with 2,242 of not-for-profit
foundations and associations supporting environmental activ-
ities, particularly environmental education (Instituto
Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatística e Instituto de Pesquisa
Econômica Aplicada, 2012, cited in Tristão & Tristão, 2016).
Still, there is no definitive study on the actual number of
NGOs in the country (Campagnac, 2006; Conselho
Empresarial Brasileiro para o desenvolvimento sustentável,
2010). Moreover, environmental management, interest in
indigenous knowledge and material utilization, and educa-
tional initiatives to teach the general population about envi-
ronmental issues in Brazil have increased considerably in
recent years (Stahelin et al., 2015). These initiatives question
policy, program, and practice contradictions, adversarial
stakeholder and class relations, and long-term impacts on the
environment itself as well as understandings of human-envi-
ronmental connections (Stahelin et al., 2015). In Brazil,
efforts have triggered governmental programs, bringing
together public and private organizational partnerships and
situating responsibilities through policies and constitutional
mandates, particularly individual responsibilities for environ-
mental impacts and governmental responsibilities for educa-
tion, with NGOs pivotal in these processes (Tristão & Tristão,
2016). Within this contentious context with adversarial pub-
lic-private sector and regional stakeholder interests, NGO
members need to construct communication processes that not
only enable them to accomplish their goals efficiently and
effectively but also work with the contradictions they face in
process, output, and advocacy (for such paradoxes, see
Putnam et al., 2016).
Method
We analyze data gathered by a Brazilian research group sup-
ported by The National Council for Scientific and
Technological Development (CNPq), of which the first
author was a member. Based primarily on thematic analyses
of deep interviews with members of the entire NGO, or man-
aging Board of MAE (which included staff as well as the
president and professionals) and of NGO documents and
observations of interactions before, during, and after the all-
organization weekly meetings, we discuss how participants
engage in efforts to discursively construct a distinctive orga-
nizational identity that promotes particular ideological and
pragmatic commitments in environmental sustainability and
in participatory organizing. In doing so, we acknowledge
that participants may have overemphasized the productive
nature of their reported interactions, perhaps because of their
(stated) commitments/calling to NGO environmental sus-
tainability work or perhaps because of their desire to tell a
seamless story that shifts attention from the contradictory
origins and toward institutionalization of third-sector inter-
ests in Brazil (Peruzzo, 2009). Even so, how such processes
are embedded in organizing is significant since Brazilian
organizations have only recently begun shifting from exter-
nal organizational foci toward recognizing the value of inter-
pretive approaches (Putnam & Casali, 2009; Management
Communication Quarterly Brazil Forum, 2009). Moreover,
organizations and environmental policy decision makers
typically do not utilize scientific reports, which make per-
sonal connection, translation of expert opinion, and abilities
to speak to and across professional and cultural languages or
expertise of various stakeholders particularly daunting in
Brazil (Carneiro & da-Silva-Rosa, 2011). Communicative
labor to (re)create images of commitment, multidisciplinary
collaboration, and united communicative efforts within the
NGO and to external publics is essential as this particular
NGO is viewed as a model for participatory action in
Brazilian society. Even so, the volatile sociopolitical and
economic context that is Brazil threatens environmental pro-
tections (Tollefson, 2016). As such, the case parallels
Brazilian national movements away from political dictator-
ship and censorship and toward concerns with democratiza-
tion, voice, citizen's rights, empowerment, education, and
transparency with real material consequences for everyday
Brazilian life (Marchiori & Oliveira, 2009; Peruzzo, 2009;
Pinto, 2006; Putnam & Casali, 2009; Reis, 2009). This case
also provides insight into how diverse stakeholders and
experts engage with the ongoing contestation in Brazilian
environmental issues (Tollefson, 2016).
Case Study
In our case study, we utilized the processes of communica-
tive labor to extend tensional approaches about NGO action
and institutionalization in Brazil and offer pragmatic or utili-
tarian value (Yin, 2003). In drawing out our case, we discuss
our participants, procedures, and context.
We conducted in depth, face-to-face interviews with the
entire managing board of the organization as well as other
members including one paid staff member, totaling 14
4 SAGE Open
people. There were nine men (64%), and five women (36%)
ranging in age from the late 20s through 50s. All participants
were Brazilians and had a history of dedication to environ-
mental causes. They came to their volunteer work through
different backgrounds, characterizing themselves as journal-
ists, lawyers, biologists, geologists, social scientists, admin-
istrators, and secretaries. We do not identify their quotes by
gender or by organizational role and expertise. We do not do
so for two reasons: (a) because of the ease with which indi-
viduals could be identified and (b) because members engaged
in consistent communicative labor to depict their environ-
mental work and interactions as strategically designed to
uphold collaboration and portray a united front on behalf of
environmental sustainability . This consistency (in perceived
practices aligned with communicative labor and environ-
mental sustainability work tensions) enabled the authors to
report theoretical saturation.
Our interviews ranged from 1 to 2 hours each and cen-
tered on focal questions about interactions, communication,
and day-to-day practices, such as "how do you do your work
here at MAE?" We used a flexible semistructured approach
guided by very few primary questions and dependent on
probes that emerged from interviewees' comments, as well
as our observations and document analyses (Patton, 2002).
Interviews were conducted in Portuguese and English,
depending on the MAE member's preferences. During trans-
lations by the first author, both authors examined linguistic
choices and context together to determine appropriate
English phrasing and meaning. All interviews were recorded
and transcribed. Transcripts were verified for accuracy
against the original recordings.
In addition to interviews, we also reviewed documents and
websites. We engaged in observations, particularly of team
decision-making meetings that took place every Tuesday dur-
ing the data collection period. During these times, we
observed interactions during meetings and different work-
place encounters that occurred before and after meetings.
During these meetings, members often discussed activities
and recounted everyday decision making that occurred with
all members regardless of position and stated expertise. For
instance, we heard accounts of and observed times when
interns (students) would make suggestions or provide input
that then would be validated by the group as useful. We
observed instances when members disagreed about strategies,
the value of certain information, and the utility and planning
of upcoming environmental events. These observations and
document analyses were used to corroborate findings and
check for contradictions between what was said and what
members did in their communicative labor.
Through inductive thematic analyses, general to more
specific categories centering on our areas of interest were
developed (Patton, 2002). We worked independently then
collectively to discuss and refine the themes or semantic pat-
terns, relying on criteria of recurrence, repetition, and force-
fulness (Owen, 1984). These criteria encourage attention to
exact and similar linguistic choices, phrasing, and argument
structures that are used by participants as well as emphases
and other nonverbal aspects of their expressions. Through
examination of their semantic patterns and language, we
could gauge what in their perceived communicative labor
was important to them as individuals and were reportedly
structured within their organizational culture.
In our data analyses processes, we utilized our strengths
as a bilingual Brazilian scholar who guided the research team
but was not a member of the NGO and as an organizational
communication researcher independent of the data gathering
processes but expert in areas of case interest. Before writing
this article, the first author presented findings to the organi-
zation not only for their use in strategic planning and reflec-
tion about their everyday practices but also as a member
check for the validity of our results.
Because context is important in case studies not simply as
background but more so as a driving force for communica-
tive labor, we briefly describe the NGO MAE in Brazil that
focuses its efforts on sustainability, preservation, and conti-
nuity of social, economic, cultural, and environmental assets
from various levels of current society. The World Business
Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) categorizes
sustainability as progress that meets current needs without
compromising future capabilities. However, sustainability
does not focus only on resource allocation and opportunities
over time but also on egalitarian distribution between current
and future generations (Milne, Kearins, & Walton, 2011).
Correspondingly, MAE is intensely active in the environ-
mental scene of the Brazilian city of Londrina, in the south-
ern state of Parana, since it was founded in 2001 by volunteers
and interns at the Londrina Environmental Public Ministry.
According to its president (biologist Eduardo Panachão),
MAE came about as a response to a disaster that had signifi-
cant environmental impacts in a northern region of the city.
At that time, volunteers were investigating large oil spills in
rivers in a suburb of Londrina called Ribeirão Lindóia, where
warehouses stored fuel.1 The initial worries facing the found-
ers centered on the lack of any legal framework for environ-
mental issues in the city at the time. Instead, environmental
issues fell under the jurisdiction of the Public Ministry. A
lack of whistleblowers and little concern on the part of the
local populace spurred some individuals to establish MAE.
At that time, the clash between neoliberal ideologies, envi-
ronmental concerns, and sustainable community develop-
ment came to the forefront. Using the contradictory spaces
opened by these different discourses and stakeholder inter-
ests, the MAE sought to provide unified but strategically
ambiguous framings of events and of their work (see
Eisenberg, 1984; Fairhurst, 2007, 2011; Fairhurst & Sarr,
1996) to achieve their aims of safeguarding the environment
and educating the general population, offering leadership
and expertise in Brazilian environmental issues. Today, MAE
is credited with environmental quality in Londrina through
partnerships with Public Ministry of Paraná and different
Marchiori and Buzzanell 5
rural and environmental entities of Londrina (Radio CBN
Londrina, 2013).
Over time, as Peruzzo (2009) noted, Brazilian NGOs
shifted tactics to encourage active involvement of citizenry
and promote a more egalitarian Brazilian society. In its two-
fold environmental and societal mission, MAE and citizens
worked on empowerment through discourse, interaction, and
partnerships (see Peruzzo, 2009). MAE interacts with diverse
stakeholders involved in environmental issues: government,
community partners, and private companies. Its history as an
organization and its history for confrontation, especially in
the legal realm, have made MAE a regional and state-level
clearinghouse and advocate for environmental concerns. As
such, MAE's discourse "occupies a political space in devel-
oping the collective cultural and societal hegemony"
(Peruzzo, p. 665). The communicative labor of invested
stakeholders involves the ongoing (re)production of ideal-
ized organizing processes that are homogeneous in outward
display but punctuated by confrontations of interests.
Reported strategic interactions both support the NGO image
and provide a space for internal struggles about Brazilian
environmental and business sector interests.
Tensional Themes of Communicative
Labor
We argue that MAE engages in communicative labor to cre-
ate images of collaboration and dialogue whereby all mem-
bers--from the president to secretaries--forego privileging
disciplinary expertise and status to work on behalf of the
environment and of modeling participatory organizing. Most
report and demonstrate (through our observations and docu-
ments describing meetings and other formalized encounters)
strategic interactions aligned with this communicative labor.
Their interactions also strategically punctuate points of con-
tradiction. Thus, as volunteers (and one paid member, a sec-
retarial staff member), they not only do the work of
environmental sustainability efforts but they also do the
work of sustaining and managing tensions productively.
We organize our findings to describe how members enter
into and discuss interactional processes, and how they engage
in discursive and material processes that they believe can
sustain the NGO's work. These findings display members
engaged in communicative labor (a) depicting NGO work as
meaningful labor, (b) producing commonality and differ-
ence, and (c) transcending contradictions.
Communicative Labor Depicting NGO Work as
Meaningful Labor
All participants framed their focus on environmental sustain-
ability as meaningful labor, with many saying that such work
was a labor of love. In using the phrase labor of love, they
explained that they were saying that they would (and did)
work without a "paycheck" and that the common drive in
"making money" did not characterize their experience.
Indeed, they were volunteers so their phrasing was not only
metaphorical but also literal. They also framed their work as
invoking "caring." They did such work because, they said,
they believed in its importance. They described their work as
a challenge of great importance with which all could identify
and celebrate ("they think it is important"; "an achievement
for the NGO is an achievement for all of us"). As one mem-
ber put it,
It is important to know that no one is here for a paycheck;
everyone believes in the cause, they think the same, and they
want it to work out right. It is not like a company where the boss
and the owner want it to work out because they want profits and
the rest only do their jobs to guarantee their salary, without
caring if they are really doing their best. Here we believe that an
achievement for the NGO is an achievement for all of us.
Like Dempsey and Sanders's (2010; see also Dempsey,
2007) social entrepreneurs and Mitra and Buzzanell's (2017)
sustainability professionals, MAE members framed their
involvement with work as benefitting a greater good than
that afforded by corporate employment. Moreover, the strong
identification with "everyone" who "think[s] the same" and
revels in "achievement[s] for all of us" offers powerful
incentives for membership and for engaging in interactions
that strategically represent this form of idealized community.
As another member stated, "We are here because we really
believe and not just to get a paycheck at the end of the
month," which they believe others do.
All of the MAE members expressed similar statements
affirming strong identification with environmental sustain-
ability causes. They expressed the value of and an availabil-
ity to serve and exchange ideas and opinions with others for
environmental good, a collective pursuit. In this framing of
their work as communally constructed, they perceived inter-
action as strategic in its function to accomplish goals: "Our
function as a NGO is primarily to seek interaction between
all of the elements involved in the areas we work in, which
are environmental issues." They maintained that "There is no
competition here . . . people interact because they want to;
because they think it is important. Not because we are forced
to." Interaction grew out of the desire to do good work; inter-
action required that they "are all open to each other" and
follow "our ideals." This admittedly idealistic depiction
required ongoing communicative effort to uphold. It was
upheld not only for external stakeholders but also as refer-
ence for the meaningfulness of their work and negotiations
of everyday interaction.
Because of the collective adherence to environmental
challenges and opportunities, MAE's organizing processes
were not derived from a formal structure, but rather from the
processes that were constantly (re)constructed through each
person's contributions and the values to which they have
6 SAGE Open
agreed (see value or ideologically focused organizing pro-
cesses, Buzzanell et al., 1997).2 The communicative labor
involved in this identification work was omnipresent and
shifted members' perceptions of relationships from work as
labor for external gratifications to work as expressed through
and in friendship and family imagery. As one member put it,
We end up confusing the professional relationships, as activists,
with friendship. The relationships that we develop here inside
the NGO end up being so close that they can't just be limited to
the professional arena. It is worth stressing that the NGO is a
family. This comes from the trust that we give to each person. In
the moment in which you work with it [trust], you can't then
disconnect it.
Such strong identification can promote decision prem-
ises that encourage similar sense-making processes and
common solutions among members (Tompkins & Cheney,
1985) that shape and are being shaped by locales, identities,
and practices (Kuhn, 2006). Yet, paradoxically, it also can
promote exclusion of those who might profess lower iden-
tification or offer non-normative decision premises, a prob-
lematic issue given great diversity in Brazil. In many ways,
it seemed possible that their communicative labor regulated
and constituted member identities in fairly limited ways
(Alvesson & Willmott, 2002), a sacrifice with which mem-
bers, by logical extension of their comments, seemed to
readily accept.
Communicative Labor Producing Commonality
and Difference
Members' reported high levels of identification and com-
municative labor to perpetuate images that all members
selflessly dedicate themselves to environmental causes and
participatory practices resulted in a paradox of freedom.
The assumed and discursively affirmed commonality
among members about work being a labor of love enabled
them to also take initiative, which meant considering an
individual to be both active and proactive, in concert with
and aligned against the collective, conversant with insider
language and ready to introduce new ideas. In taking initia-
tive or producing productive difference, the notion of how
interaction was accomplished routinely dominated partici-
pants' responses. In speaking about others with MAE as
well as himself, this participant suggested the following
process whereby members constituted their community
through interaction:
I think that the initial interaction is the impulse, that first thing,
the catalyst that got them to get up and come get to know the
NGO. I think that this is the first interaction. When talking about
interaction here inside, it is the contact that they make with the
professionals from the diverse areas. They start to understand
the language that is spoken here inside and starting from this is
the so-called interaction process.
The interaction process with its strategic integration of simi-
larity and difference centered around work projects, as
another participant noted:
I assumed certain roles without really having had any previous
experience with the people with whom I was working here. So,
I had already taken up some responsibilities, and I had already
started to participate more actively in the organization to an
extent that, even before I had officially gone to the last board
meeting, I had already participated in management meetings
about the same things.
NGO participants perceived their work to be interaction--
making contact with other members, meeting with and learn-
ing from people, taking initiative to grow and sustain
relationships with experts, and developing capacities to engage
in dissent productively (Banks, 2008; Garner, 2013; Kassing,
2011), even if it meant "swearing" at each other:
Here we have many relationships, inside and outside of work
. . . The relationships are great; they aren't just something about
work, about the routine. This is a good thing because we talk
about NGO issues in various places, in various situations;
everything is connected to what we do here. This helps a lot, to
have people know each other, to have more contact, to be able to
talk about something later, to call someone, even to swear at
them and them at me when we need to, this is really good.
Freedom, as part of these reported strategic interactions
(see Deetz, 2010), was considered to be a necessary compo-
nent for MAE members to drive interaction. Freedom meant
that different individuals--experienced in their areas of
knowledge--perceived boundarylessness in their abilities to
take initiative to act and interact in sharing insights and to
learn throughout MAE, as well as connection with others and
environmental causes to which they shared dedication. We
observed that their connections manifested themselves inter-
actionally and structurally through active involvement in
meetings, questioning of topics under discussion, and dis-
playing the continuous interest in and movement toward
mutually creative decisions (see Deetz, 2010). These interac-
tions were created throughout the conduct of their work,
making the pattern more identifiable than specific incidents.
Communicative Labor Transcending
Contradictions
Openness, transparency, and harmony resonated in discourse
and the interaction practices of MAE members. However,
these processes were not without struggle at times, just as har-
mony does not mean that everyone is happy and gets along
well continuously. Instead, these qualities operated as values
that underlay everyday interaction and as interaction goals
toward which MAE members worked. Although MAE mem-
bers reported these values and spoke about them in inter-
views, we observed the "swearing" and grappling with issues
Marchiori and Buzzanell 7
that some might perceive as conflict but that MAE members
considered necessary for dialogue and collaboration to hap-
pen. One professional MAE member perceived that
Management meetings are open; they don't have an agenda, so
there are various topics. We try to focus the specific research
groups, but everyone is free. I think that the freedom and
initiative that everyone has, they must have [it] in order to
maintain this rhythm; because nothing here is required, these are
the differences that let interaction happen with everyone.
The communicative labor to produce consistency in strate-
gic interaction, work toward the common good, and collective
action meant that discourse, spatio-temporal considerations,
structure, and embodied practice had to match. The struggle to
maintain interaction as the means of work is evidenced in
attention to the seemingly smallest details through the over-
arching structure of MAE, according to one member:
We avoid changing dates/times, mainly to allow the people who
go to the NGO to organize themselves as much as possible, but
also to allow other people to also come. . . . There are things that
we manage to build internally, from internal interaction, and from
external [interaction], with society, with government. These are
processes that we see as facilitating this type of relationship.
Another member commented that MAE strives to create a
culture and structure that is "friendly and not so formal, . . . .
because from the moment you bureaucratize the work envi-
ronment a lot, at least here, you end up hindering this interac-
tion between the people, the members."
As one member said, "interaction is what makes things
develop." The work required physical presence, putting one-
self out there to interact with different people in spaces that
might not always be personally comfortable but that align
with the NGO mission:
One of the things that people always stress heavily: Don't just
come [to be] in your group. Don't participate just in your group's
activities, because in your group everyone speaks the same
language. Now, as a biologist communicates with a law intern,
as a law intern talks with a volunteer that has never studied
anywhere, the message here is: exchange knowledge, get
together. I say physical presence is very important. People need
to be here with some constancy . . . doing that interaction.
Despite this fairly consistent depiction of discursive-
material linkages to the mission and the communicative
labor needed to (re)enact and embody messages, members
did discuss contradictory opinions about the means, effi-
ciency, and satisfactory fulfillment of goals through commu-
nication. As displayed in previous interview excerpts, most
participants depicted MAE as intensely participative. They
pointed to communication as the process capable of reaching
all groups and members; formally observed (by us) through
channels such as email and meetings and informally through
phone calls, casual encounters, dialogues, and conversa-
tions--often conducted in close proximity. They embodied
the environmental work that they promoted in their physical,
intellectual, emotional, and advocacy labor. MAE members'
varied activities. These included: planting seedlings, engag-
ing in public expositions and debates about the environment,
creating briefs about and reporting environmental crimes
(whistleblowing), protecting and supporting urban cityscapes
and green environmental spaces (such as parks and plazas,
and other green areas), and driving the kinds of research and
conservation projects that could move Brazil to the forefront
of proactive, as well as reactive, environmental work.
On a day-to-day basis, among the other services MAE
offers to the public are books, videos, and references about
the environment. They conduct information sessions about
Londrina and the region, and about area tourist attractions.
The MAE offers excursions, walks, hiking, and adventurous
activities in the areas under their watch, which function daily
between 9 AM and 12 PM. MAE members are also constant
participants in local, regional, national, and international
conferences. They produce and disseminate journalistic arti-
cles, scientific research, and practices that are based on glob-
ally accepted concepts. In short, there are many activities in
which MAE members engage such that they are stretched in
terms of ability to interact in the ways that they want and to
do the work that they find so meaningful.
As a result, some participants stated that there were many
problems within MAE and these were due to lack of com-
munication. These participants perceived the MAE commu-
nication structure to be inefficient and incapable of reaching
all organization members--they assessed such processes as
compromising productive interaction and stifling the consti-
tution of different kinds of knowledge and expertise. Thus,
all MAE participants' statements did not reveal a seamless
utopian view of the NGO's operations that they labored to
communicate but, rather, depicted MAE as a contested site of
diverse meaning-making and information-sharing with dif-
ferent stakeholders internally and externally.
Because of these diverse opinions, we questioned whether
the formal and informal processes, as well as the organiza-
tion's overall official message, could be understood and
agreed upon at all organizational levels and by all stakehold-
ers. Clarity, coherence, and transparency internally and
externally have long been considered fundamental for orga-
nizational success, especially for NGOs, although such char-
acterizations have been challenged (e.g., Scott, 2013).
Indeed, a tension-centered approach would indicate that such
characterizations are not the most productive because they
do not leave openings for contestations that can lead to
change. To ensure that knowledge and recognition of strate-
gic processes were shared, MAE members described the
need for effective and efficient formal communication chan-
nels and "formal spaces." Formal communication processes
could be characterized as inclusionary and proactive but also
as reactive, occurring as means of insuring satisfaction of
8 SAGE Open
day-to-day informational needs to enable overall organizing
processes and organizational accomplishments:
There is always someone who doesn't know something, and this
could end up hindering them because they could get help, or
give an idea. I really want the communication here­that
information I know could reach everyone­to happen in an
efficient manner, but even so I think that everyone here is
integrated.
The NGO MAE members showed consensus concerning
the necessity ("requirement") of individual initiative to pro-
vide and seek out expertise, with proactive interactions often
constituting informal communication practices. As one mem-
ber asserted,
It is more natural, here the individuals are conscious of this, of
the importance for us to interact, in order to acquire more
information, change our way of thinking, and growing as both
professionals and human beings. It is not a question of work; it
is a requirement.
Individuals who took advantage of multiple formal and
informal communication channels managed to stay informed
about diverse questions, or at the very least, those that were
of interest to their area of expertise:
Information is transmitted to all of these groups. And at least if I
don't want it and decide to block this access--the negative part
of my actions--this information still reaches me. Of course
there are a lot of emails that circulate here and I can read them
and discard [irrelevant ones], or an issue can catch my attention
and I can integrate it, and react to it. But it is very efficient and
enables people's actions. I can omit it if I desire, but it reaches
me, even if I am not interested.
In short, when informal communication was insufficient
for work accomplishment internally and externally, for col-
lective knowledge generation, and for structure, then formal
channels enabled reactive strategic interaction:
The idea is to always minimize reactive interaction, leaving this
only for bureaucratic issues concerning NGO management and
coordination. But when you refer to NGO action management, it
is always proactive, in that people always have initiative.
The communicative labor involves image creation of
seamless value, interaction, and embodied performance inte-
gration: "when we get together, independent of whether it is
a group from a specific area or not, we develop the next steps
together, in alignment with the needs." Although not satis-
factory to all members at all times and for all considerations,
MAE's interactional dynamic constituted structure, process,
and relationship to produce deeply embedded practices
whereby members reportedly had access to collective, for-
mal, and informal meetings and encounters. This communi-
cative labor to transcend contradiction and communicate
constantly was intense and all consuming, as one member
recounts:
Conversations are important; they are essential for our work, our
actions. We are always connected, . . . communication keeps
circulating among everyone, from one to another. It is truly a
process. All day long things happen differently . . . you always
have to seek out new ways to solve problems, to communicate to
others what you want, what you need. People have to understand
this, if they don't, they never solve anything, it is impossible.
The relentless burden of doing good work, making connec-
tions, and maintaining relationships is evident in a member's
comment that "If I fail to accomplish my task I will hinder a
friend of mine, ... [namely] the NGO president or vice-presi-
dent, or treasurer, or group director," and in another member's
remark that everything they do in MAE is interconnected:
"The people here want to know each other; they want to be
friends, because they want the things to go right. They want . .
. to make things change." Without strong identification pro-
cesses, communicative labor to (re)create love of labor and
reported strategic interaction for accomplishing environmen-
tal and participatory goals would not be sustainable:
If we didn't have everyone integrated like this, the organization
wouldn't make it. I think it is a differential, and I think this is
why the NGO is still here after [more than] 10 years, because
everyone is cooperating and everyone is helping out.
Discussion
Our study provides an empirical foray into analyzing the ten-
sion-centered communicative labor in a Brazilian NGOfocused
on environmental sustainability. This research extends contem-
porary Brazilian scholars' work in broadening organizational
communication approaches and redressing previously limiting
foci on public relations (Marchiori & Oliveira, 2009).
Specifically, communicative labor depicted NGO work as a
labor of love, producing commonality and difference, and tran-
scending contradictions in communication processes and out-
comes. These processes were not seamlessly enacted without
contestation, ongoing individual and collective efforts, and
heated emotions. However, these processes facilitated goals to
which all were oriented and wanted to model internally and
externally for Brazilian society.As a result MAE members per-
ceived strong desires to report and embody the values guiding
their communicative labor. Although we did not ask MAE
members specifically about the meanings of their work, we
found that their identification with environmental and civic
goals for their local and national communities provided insight
into these areas. They expressed how their communicative
labor was consistent with the overarching meaningfulness they
perceived in environmental sustainability work itself and in the
pressures they experienced when they did not feel as though
they were producing such meaningfulness. Attention to these
individual meanings and the collective meaningfulness of work
Marchiori and Buzzanell 9
as aligned with communicative labor contributes not only to a
tension-centered approach to organizational and environmental
communication but also to understandings of NGO organizing
in general.
We acknowledge that there are limitations to our study.
First, although we utilized documents and observations for
our study, we used interviews as our primary data gathering
method. Use of interviews may have limited the conclusions
we could draw from our study insofar as participants may
have responded in idealistic or utopian ways to our inquiries
(Alvesson, 2003). During the interviews, we were always
aware of this aspect, but even so, further research could
investigate the differences between what members say and
what they do at the NGO MAE, particularly how members
operate within, contest, and resist particular organizational
discourse (Bisel, 2009).
Another limitation refers to not gathering data in the com-
munities where the NGO is active and not gathering data
from various other external stakeholders. We admit that such
additional data gathering would have enriched our findings.
However, our interest centered on how the members of the
NGO as a whole expressed and constructed their interactions
to accomplish their goals and manage tensions in their inter-
nal organizing processes. We encourage further research in
the communities' co-constitution of communicative labor
with MAE and with greater attention to diverse stakeholders
and sites of operation. We note that it would be informative
to do similar research with members of other environmental
sustainability organizations around the globe and in connec-
tion with the adaptive-transformative capacities inherent in
community resilience (e.g., Long et al., 2015).
Furthermore, because of the intensity of environmental
and interactional work that MAE members do, we suggest
that consideration of greater understanding of their everyday
resilience labor might prove productive. Following Agarwal
and Buzzanell's (2015) study on not-for-profit members'
efforts to sustain their identification, involvement, and abili-
ties to assist others and themselves in reintegrating after
disasters, we note that MAE members' remarks during inter-
views and their activities when faced with environmental
wrongdoing and crises seem to align with the familial, ideo-
logical, and destruction-renewal network ties that Agarwal
and Buzzanell found. Understanding MAE members' com-
municative construction of resilience might offer further
insights into their organizing processes, perceived meaning-
fulness of their work, and other aspects.
To close, through our case study of a Brazilian not-for-
profit focused on sustainability initiatives, we expand knowl-
edge about tensions inherent in communicative labor and
organizing paradoxes in different Brazilian organizational
environments, but especially in the third (nonprofit/nongov-
ernmental) sector. Communicative labor processes displayed
how members entered into, thought about, structured, and
sustained interaction strategically to resolve tensions and to
model the interactive processes that are considered to be a
hallmark of the particular Brazilian third-sector organization
that we studied. Our findings not only contribute theoreti-
cally to tensional approaches to organizational communica-
tion but also pragmatically to how sustainability efforts
requiring collaborations for work accomplishment and mem-
ber identifications are perceived to operate. Because we pre-
sented our findings and their implications to the NGO
leadership who wanted to find out how they might engage
with each other and their work more productively, we con-
sider our work to be engaged scholarship that contributes to
the ways members make sense of and navigate NGO's ethi-
cal and political work (Dempsey, 2012; Dempsey & Barge,
2014) in sustainability realms, as well as the ways contradic-
tion and paradox are part of communicative labor (Dempsey,
2009; Putnam et al., 2016).

Notes
1. The city of Londrina, located in the North of the state of Parana,
was founded in 1934. With well over 500,000 inhabitants and
covering 171,500 hectares, Londrina has a large rural area that
has around 600 rivers and streams. The valley floors where the
streams are located are areas of permanent preservation and
constitute "Linear Parks" (following the course of the stream).
These are rare in cities the size of Londrina. These parks help
stabilize the climate, protect water resources, reduce the pres-
sures of urbanization, and are sought out for recreation. The
Tibagi, the largest river in the basin, supplies 60% of the city's
drinking water and has suffered consequences of environmen-
tal degradation.
2. Except for having a president, Meio Ambiente Equilibrado
(MAE) is organized around three study and production
groups: Grupo de DireitoAmbiental (GDA, the Group
for Environmental Law), Grupo Técnico Ambiental
(GTA, the Group of Environmental Experts), and Grupo
Comunicação Ambiental (GCA, the Group for Environmental
Communication). The GDA consists of interns, law students,
volunteers, and lawyers. In partnership with Londrina's
Prosecutor for Environmental Affairs, this specific group
undertakes all stages of civil action, from investigation to fil-
ing suit in court based upon environmental and urban law. This
group's primary areas of action include regions of permanent
preservation, public service contracts, plazas, and the devel-
opment of privately owned subdivisions in environmentally
protected areas (which are often authorized by government
agencies, but still result in environmental degradation and
public health risks). The professionals from the GTA focus on
proving scientific research to be used as reference for any legal
proceedings filed by the GDA. Their research generally tar-
gets environmental recovery, reforestation, and water, wildlife,
10 SAGE Open
flora, and urban zoning. The GCA oversees public and press
relations, and also develops public awareness campaigns.
