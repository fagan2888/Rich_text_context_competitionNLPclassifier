Low serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D (25OHD) predicts a higher
cardiovascular risk in the general population. Because
patients with chronic kidney disease are more likely to have
low serum 25OHD, we determined the relationship between
hypovitaminosis D and death in this group. Analysis was
done using a cohort composed of 3011 patients from the
Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey who
had chronic kidney disease but were not on dialysis and who
had a mean follow-up of 9 years. In analyses adjusted for
demographics, cardiovascular risk factors, serum phosphorus,
albumin, hemoglobin, stage of chronic kidney disease,
albuminuria, and socioeconomic status, individuals with
serum 25OHD levels less than 15ng/ml had an increased risk
for all-cause mortality when compared to those with levels
over 30ng/ml. This significantly higher risk for death with
low serum 25OHD was evident in 15 of the 23 subgroups.
The higher risk for cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular
mortality became statistically nonsignificant on
multivariable adjustment. The trend for higher mortality in
patients with 25OHD levels 15­30ng/ml was not statistically
significant. Our results indicate there is a graded relationship
between serum 25OHD and the risk for death among
subjects with chronic kidney disease who are not undergoing
dialysis. Randomized, controlled trials are needed to
conclusively determine whether vitamin D supplementation
reduces mortality.

The high prevalence of hypovitaminosis D is increasingly
recognized as an important public health problem.1 The
present recommendations for what constitutes optimal
serum levels of 25-hydroxy vitamin D (25OHD) were based
on the prevention of osteomalacia and rickets. A large body
of evidence now supports the notion that serum 25OHD is
not only a predictor of bone health but also associated with
cancer, cardiometabolic disorders, and other chronic medical
conditions.1 Studies in the general population have shown
that low serum 25OHD levels are associated with higher all-
cause and cardiovascular mortality, and non-fatal cardiovas-
cular events.2­5
Over 13% of the adults in the United States are estimated to
have chronic kidney disease (CKD), and they have a
significantly higher prevalence of 25OHD deficiency or
insufficiency.6­8 To our knowledge, only three studies have
examined the association of serum 25OHD levels with the risk
for death in CKD patients ­ one study examined 90-day
mortality in incident maintenance hemodialysis patients, one in
patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis, and one examined the
risk for a composite outcome for either death or progression to
end-stage renal disease in 168 non-dialysis-dependent CKD
subjects.9­11 Furthermore, use of active vitamin D preparations
in incident hemodialysis patients seemed to abrogate the higher
risk for 90-day mortality with hypovitaminosis D.9 Although
several pharmacoepidemiological studies have shown a lower
risk for death in dialysis or pre-dialysis patients treated with
active vitamin D preparations, data on serum 25OHD levels
were not available in any of these studies.12­15
We undertook this study to examine the association of
serum 25OHD levels with the risk for all-cause and cause-
specific mortality in adult subjects with CKD, enrolled
in the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey (NHANES III) ­ a random sampling of community-
dwelling individuals in the United States. This is the largest
study of the relationship of serum 25OHD levels with
mortality in CKD, and the sampling design allows estimates
that can be generalized to the CKD population in the
United States.

RESULTS
Patient characteristics
The characteristics of the entire cohort with CKD and of
those classified by serum 25OHD levels are summarized in
Table 1. There was a graded increase in age and body mass
index with decreasing 25OHD levels. Furthermore, the
subjects with lower 25OHD levels were more likely to be
females, non-Whites, current smokers, and have hyperten-
sion and diabetes.
Serum 25OHD levels and all-cause mortality in CKD
Of the 3011 subjects in the cohort, 1123 died over a mean
follow-up period of 9.0±0.2 years. In unadjusted analyses,
individuals with 25OHD levels o15 ng/ml and 15­30 ng/ml
had a higher risk for all-cause mortality, using those with
serum 25OHD levels 430 ng/ml as reference (hazards ratio
(HR) (95% confidence intervals), 1.48 (1.12,1.97); and 1.30
(1.10,1.54), respectively). The increase in risk for death in
individuals with serum 25OHD levels o15 ng/ml persisted
despite multivariate adjustment. Thus, compared with
individuals with serum 25OHD levels 430 ng/ml, a higher
risk for death persisted despite adjustments for stage of CKD
and for potential confounders of cardiovascular disease
(Table 2). This increased risk persisted despite additional
adjustment for laboratory and socioeconomic variables
(Table 2).
Individuals with serum 25OHD levels o15 ng/ml had a
significantly higher risk for death in 15 of the 23 subgroups
examined compared with those with levels 430 ng/ml; the
HR exceeded 1.0 in seven additional subgroups (Figure 1).

Compared with individuals with serum 25OHD levels
430 ng/ml, those with levels 15­30 ng/ml were associated
with a significantly higher risk for death in 4 of the 23
subgroups examined; the HRs exceeded 1.0 in 15 additional
subgroups (Figure 2).
Cause-specific mortality
Of the 1123 deaths in the study cohort, 588 were secondary
to cardiovascular causes and 535 were secondary to non-
cardiovascular causes. Individuals with 25OHD deficiency
had a significantly higher adjusted risk for cardiovascular and
non-cardiovascular mortality in the models adjusted for
demographics only (Table 3). On further multivariable
adjustment, the same qualitative trend for both cardiovas-
cular and non-cardiovascular mortality was observed but it
did not reach statistical significance (Table 3).

of CKD did not change the fully adjusted HR for all-cause

DISCUSSION
This is the first study, to our knowledge, that shows a
significant association between hypovitaminosis D and
mortality in a nationally representative sample across the
spectrum of CKD before the need for dialysis. Individuals
with serum 25OHD levels o 15 ng/ml had a 1.5-fold higher
adjusted risk for all-cause mortality; the 1.2-fold higher risk
for death in individuals with 25OHD levels between 15 and
30 ng/ml did not reach statistical significance.
The present findings are consistent with the results of
several recent reports linking vitamin D status with
cardiovascular risk in the general population.2­5 At least
three observational studies have analyzed the risk for death
associated with low serum 25OHD levels in CKD patients.
Low serum 25OHD levels were associated with a higher risk
for death in 900 incident maintenance hemodialysis patients
in the first 90 days of starting dialysis therapy; however, no
such association was seen in patients treated with active
vitamin D compounds.9 Similarly, lower serum 25OHD
levels were associated with an increased risk for cardiovas-
cular events in 230 prevalent peritoneal dialysis patients.4 In
the only study of non-dialysis-dependent CKD subjects, low
serum 25OHD levels were associated with a higher risk for
reaching a composite outcome of death or end-stage renal
disease in 168 subjects.11
In addition to extending the previously noted association
of hypovitaminosis D with mortality in dialysis patients to
non-dialysis-dependent CKD patients, the level of serum
25OHD at which a higher risk for all-cause mortality is
evident seems to be similar to that previously reported in
dialysis patients. In the two studies that evaluated association
of serum 25OHD levels with mortality in dialysis patients, a
higher risk for death was seen with levels o10 ng/ml and
45.7 nmol/l (o18.3 ng/ml) in incident hemodialysis and
prevalent peritoneal dialysis patients, respectively.9,10 There
are several strengths of this study that significantly increase
the robustness of our findings. First, the sample size of our
study cohort is larger than previously reported in any study
of either dialysis dependent or pre-dialysis subjects with
CKD. This allowed us to control for a variety of confounders,
such as demographic, comorbid, laboratory, and socio-
economic factors, which could affect the risk for death.
Furthermore, even though subjects with lower serum 25OHD
levels had a higher prevalence and/or greater severity of other
cardiovascular risk factors, the HRs for death with vitamin D
deficiency and insufficiency changed only minimally even
after including all these risk factors in the multivariate
models. This argues against the confounding with regard to
the observed risk with low 25OHD levels; however, in an
observational study of this kind, residual confounding cannot
be completely excluded. Second, but more importantly, the
findings of this study are readily generalizable to the entire
population of CKD in the United States, as NHANES III was
a random sampling of the civilian, non-institutionalized
population of the United States. Finally, the higher risk for
all-cause mortality was confirmed in many of the subgroups
studied. Our inability to show a statistically significant higher
risk for death in each subgroup examined may have resulted
from too few events (and hence limited power) for some of
the subgroup analyses.
25-Hydroxy vitamin D is regarded as the best indicator of
vitamin D status, but it must be converted by 25-hydroxy
vitamin D-1a-hydroxylase (1-aOHase) to the biologically
active form, 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D (1,25(OH)2D). The
ubiquity of the vitamin D receptor and tissue 1-hydroxylase
provides insights into several pathobiological pathways

through which hypovitaminosis D may mediate a variety of
other adverse health outcomes, including possible increased
mortality risk.1 These include immunomodulatory effects,
upregulation of cytokines, pro-fibrotic and pro-inflamma-
tory pathways, and the renin­angiotensin system.16­21
Aschenbrenner et al.22 reported that rats treated with 1,25-
dihydroxy vitamin D had a significant reduction in renal
expression of transforming growth factor-b1; however, this
occurred despite no change in the mRNA expression of either
transforming growth factor-b1 or vitamin D receptor,
suggesting that vitamin D may have important non-genomic
effects. Treatment with paricalcitol, a vitamin D analog, in
rats with salt-sensitive hypertension has been shown to
attenuate the development of left ventricular hypertrophy.23
Consistent with these pleiotropic effects, our analysis shows
similar trend for increase in both cardiovascular and non-
cardiovascular mortality with lower 25OHD levels.
Although the results of this study from analysis of the
NHANES III, a representative sample of the United States
population, could have broad implications, it also has several
limitations. The timing of blood collections for NHANES
participants occurs within communities at different latitudes.
However, to minimize the impact of seasonal variation due to
sunlight exposure on vitamin D levels the timing was
staggered, as northern samples were collected during the
warmer months when sunlight is more abundant.24 This
study design had the potential to bias the results toward the
null hypothesis; the finding of a significant relationship,
despite this method of sampling, strengthens the validity of
our findings. Although the NHANES III survey provides
some of the best available estimates of the prevalence and
treatment of chronic diseases in United States, its cross-
sectional design does not allow for direct causal inference.
Over two-thirds of the subjects had either stage 1 or 2 CKD,
and thus, most of the participants had only mild CKD.
However, subgroup analysis showed that the trends in
subjects with stage 3 and 4 CKD were similar to that seen
in those with stage 1 and 2 CKD. The baseline 25OHD level
was a single measurement and there were no data available
for either serum parathyroid hormone or calcitriol levels;
thus, we cannot determine whether the association between
25OHD status and mortality risk was mediated, in part, by
secondary hyperparathyroidism or low calcitriol levels. An
alternate explanation for the present findings is that vitamin
D deficiency may be a marker of chronic nonspecific illness,
identifying individuals who are more ill, and are less likely to
go outdoors and get adequate exposure to sunlight. However,
the present investigation was restricted to ambulatory
participants, which makes confounding by significant
immobility or chronic illness unlikely. Finally, data on
polymorphisms of the vitamin D receptor were not available;
thus, the effect of these genetic variations on circulating
25OHD levels and the potential effect modification on
mortality were not tested.
In summary, the results of this study suggest that there is a
graded relationship between serum 25OHD levels and
mortality, with a statistically significant risk apparent when
serum 25OHD levels are o15 ng/ml. The broad public health
implications of this finding cannot be overemphasized given
the high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency among individuals
with CKD, and the ease, safety, and low cost of maintaining
replete vitamin D levels. Randomized trials are warranted to
evaluate the role of vitamin D supplementation in reducing
mortality in CKD patients with hypovitaminosis D.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES
III) was a study conducted between 1988 and 1994.25 Study
participants were selected using a complex, multistage, stratified,
and clustered probability sampling of the non-institutionalized
population of the United States. The study included a deliberate
oversampling of Blacks, Mexican Americans, and elderly.25 Of the
19,618 NHANES III study participants of X18 years of age, the
following groups of subjects were excluded ­34 subjects did not have
adequate information on follow-up; 2997 did not have data on serum
25OHD levels; and 767 did not have information on either serum or
urine creatinine or urine albumin, to determine the presence of CKD.
Of the remaining 15,818 subjects, 25 had stage 5 CKD and were
excluded. Of the remaining 15,793 subjects, 3011 had stage 1 through
to 4 CKD and formed the study cohort.
Definition of variables and laboratory measurements
All assessments, including the measurement of 25OHD levels, were
done at a single baseline visit. Estimated glomerular filtration rate,
using the abbreviated Modification in Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD)
equation, and urine albumin/creatinine ratio were used to determine
CKD.26 The creatinine measurements in the NHANES III study were
calibrated to the MDRD equation by subtracting 0.23mg per 100 ml,
as previously described.27 CKD was defined as either estimated
glomerular filtration rate o60ml/min/1.73 m2 or the presence of
microalbuminuria (417mg/g in men and 425mg/g in women).26
Serum 25OHD levels were measured using radioimmunoassay
(DiaSorin, Stillwater, MN, USA). Race/Ethnicity was self-described
by the study participants. Current smokers were subjects who
currently smoked and had consumed at least 100 cigarettes during
their lifetime. Hypertension was defined as present if the subject was
taking anti-hypertensive medications or the measured blood
pressure was 4140/90 mm Hg. A patient was considered to have a
history of cardiovascular disease if they had had heart attack,
congestive heart failure, stroke, or angina. Subjects were asked
whether their doctors had told them that they had had heart attack,
congestive heart failure, or stroke. History of angina was determined
using the Rose questionnaire. Diabetes mellitus was defined as a
history of diabetes, being treated with medications for diabetes, or
a fasting blood glucose 4126 mg per 100 ml. Education was used as
a dichotomous variable (o12 or X12 completed years of school-
ing). Patients were classified as having any health insurance or none.
The effect of income was assessed by determining whether the
participant's household income was o or X200% of the federal
poverty level. Non-HDL cholesterol, C-reactive protein, hemoglo-
bin, calcium, and phosphorus were measured, as previously
described.8,28 Total serum calcium was corrected for serum albumin.
Determination of vital status
Death was determined by linking the baseline data to the National
Center for Health Statistics mortality follow-up file.29 Deaths were

ascertained by matching National Death Index screen or death
certificate or both, from the time of enrollment until 31 December
2000. Cause of death was coded using ninth revision of the
International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Injuries, and
Causes of Death (ICD-9) up until 1998 and ICD-10 for deaths
between 1999 and 2000. All deaths before 1999 were recoded by the
NCHS into comparable ICD-10 codes.29
Selection of cutoffs to define groups based on serum
25OHD levels
To define cutoff thresholds, analyses were performed in the entire
cohort of 15,793 subjects. Compared with the individuals in the
highest decile of serum 25OHD levels (X45 ng/ml), a consistent
increase in risk for death was apparent in all groups of individuals
with levels o28 ng/ml and a further increase in risk was apparent in
individuals with serum 25OHD levels p15 ng/ml. The same
threshold for consistent increase in death was identified when the
data were adjusted for differences in demographics, cardiovascular
risk factors, socioeconomic variables, and laboratory data. Given
the similarity of these thresholds to the categories of deficiency,
insufficiency, and sufficiency, as defined by the National Kidney
Foundation, the latter categories were used for all analyses (serum
25OHD levels- o15 ng/ml, 15­30 ng/ml, and 430 ng/ml).30
Statistical analyses
All analyses were performed using sample weights that account for
unequal probability of selection, non-response, and planned over-
sampling of elderly, Blacks, and Mexican Americans. Estimates were
made using the recommended SAS-callable SUDAAN software
(version 8, Research Triangle Park, NC, USA). Continuous variables
are expressed as mean±standard error of mean (s.e.m.).
All subjects without a probabilistic match were deemed to be
alive on 31 December 2000, the end of the follow-up. Cox
proportional hazards analysis was used to determine the effect of
25OHD levels on survival. All study subjects were categorized
into three groups based on serum 25OHD levels- 430 ng/ml,
15­30 ng/ml, and o15 ng/ml. The relative risk for death in the latter
two groups was estimated, using individuals with serum 25OHD
levels 430 ng/ml as a reference. Three different multivariate models
were specified a priori to test for independent effects of serum
25OHD levels on mortality. The first model adjusted for
demographic variables- age, race, and gender, all subsequent models
were adjusted for month of the year when the sample was drawn.
The second model adjusted for demographic and cardiovascular risk
factors (current smoking, hypertension, history of cardiovascular
disease, body mass index, diabetes mellitus, family history, non-
HDL cholesterol X160 mg per 100 ml, serum C-reactive protein,
stage of CKD, and urine albumin­creatinine ratio); the third
model adjusted for demographic, cardiovascular risk factors,
socioeconomic variables (medical insurance, education, income,
and whether the subject went to a particular place for care)
and laboratory measures (hemoglobin, serum albumin, and
phosphorus).
The relative risk for death of patients with serum 25OHD levels
o15 ng/ml compared with those with levels 430 ng/ml, was tested
in 23 pre-specified subgroups of age, gender, race, diabetes,
hypertension, history of cardiovascular disease, non-HDL
cholesterol levels, CKD, serum C-reactive protein levels, and body
mass index. All subgroup analyses were adjusted for demographic
variables and cardiovascular risk factors, except for the variable used
to stratify the study population.
The relationship of serum 25OHD levels with cardiovascular
and non-cardiovascular mortality was ascertained. For the analysis
of cardiovascular mortality, patients who died from non-cardio-
vascular causes were censored on the date of death. Similarly, in the
analysis for non-cardiovascular mortality, patients who died from
cardiovascular causes were censored on the date of death.
Two different sensitivity analyses for all-cause mortality were
performed, as described in the Results section of the article. In the
first such analysis, instead of using stages of CKD, estimated
glomerular filtration rate was included as a continuous variable and
in the second analysis, serum triglycerides were included as a
variable in place of non-HDL cholesterol.
