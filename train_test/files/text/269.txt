Context: Symptoms of intense bereavement-related sad-
ness may resemble those of major depressive disorder
(MDD) but may not indicate a mental disorder. To avert
false-positive diagnoses, DSM criteria for MDD exclude
uncomplicated bereavement of brief duration and mod-
est severity. However, the DSM does not similarly ex-
empt depressive reactions to other losses, even when they
are uncomplicated in duration and severity.
Objective: To test the validity of the DSM exclusion of
uncomplicated depressive symptoms only in response to
bereavement but not in response to other losses.
Design: Community-based epidemiological study.
Participants: From the National Comorbidity Survey
(NCS) of 8098 persons aged 15 to 54 years representative
of the US population, we identified individuals who met
MDDsymptomcriteriaandwhoseMDDepisodesweretrig-
geredbyeitherbereavement(n=157)orotherloss(n=710).
Intervention: We divided the bereavement and other
loss trigger groups into uncomplicated and complicated
cases by applying the NCS algorithm for uncomplicated
bereavement to the reactions to other losses. We then com-
pared uncomplicated bereavement and uncomplicated re-
actions to other losses on a variety of disorder indica-
tors and symptoms.
Main Outcome Measures: Nine disorder indicators,
as follows: number of symptoms, melancholic depres-
sion, suicide attempt, duration of symptoms, interfer-
ence with life, recurrence, and 3 service use variables.
Results: Episodes of uncomplicated depression trig-
gered by bereavement and by other loss have similar symp-
tom profiles and are not significantly different for 8 of 9
disorder indicators. Moreover, uncomplicated reac-
tions, whether triggered by bereavement or other loss,
are significantly lower than complicated reactions on al-
most all disorder indicators.
Conclusion: The NCS data do not support the validity of

complicatedreactionstootherlossesfromMDDdiagnosis.

ACOMMON CRITICISM OF THE
DSM symptom-based di-
agnostic criteria is that
their failure to consider
stressful contexts results in
false-positive diagnoses, that is, the clas-
sification of psychiatrically normal per-
sons as mentally disordered.1,2 False-
positive diagnoses can potentially lead to
stigmatization, inappropriate care, and in-
flated epidemiological prevalence rates that
undermine the credibility of the diagnos-
tic system.2 Conversely, restricting diag-
nostic criteria to exclude persons with-
out mental disorder but with symptoms
can inadvertently lead to false-negative di-
agnoses, that is, classification of genu-
inely disordered individuals as nondisor-
dered, potentially leading to failure to
obtain needed treatment.
This false-negative/false-positive ten-
sion is nowhere more apparent than in
the DSM-IV bereavement exclusion for
major depressive disorder (MDD). A
diagnosis of MDD requires at least 1
major depressive episode (MDE) not
caused by bipolar or nonaffective psy-
chotic disorders. Criteria for an MDE
require at least 5 of 9 symptoms includ-
ing sadness or lack of interest or plea-
sure, at least 2 weeks' duration, clinically
significant impairment or distress, and
exclusion of substance-induced and gen-
eral medical etiologies. However, some
individuals who meet these symptom
and impairment criteria are not experi-
encing a mood disorder but intense nor-
mal sadness in response to bereavement.3
The DSM criteria for MDE use an exclu-
sion criterion in an attempt to prevent

false-positive diagnoses, requiring that the symptoms
cannot be better explained by bereavement.
Bereavement can sometimes trigger genuine mood dis-
orders. Thus, excluding all cases of bereavement from
MDEs would yield false-negative diagnoses. The DSM ad-
dresses this problem by using unusual duration, impair-
ment, or symptoms to identify exceptions to the bereave-
ment exclusion that likely represent true disorder. The
DSM-IV, for example, classifies bereavement responses
as MDEs if the symptoms last more than 2 months or if
there is marked functional impairment, morbid preoc-
cupation with worthlessness, suicidal ideation, psy-
chotic symptoms, or psychomotor retardation.
The DSM uses the term "complicated bereavement"
for bereavement that triggers MDD. However, this term
has recently become widely used to also denote a non-
depressive mourning-related pathologic condition in-
cluding such symptoms as unremitting yearning and sense
of loss.4-6 To avoid confusion, we refer to bereavement-
triggered depressive disorder as complicated bereavement-
triggered depression.
The DSM criteria for MDD ignore the many other kinds
of serious losses that can cause intense symptoms of nor-
mal sadness. (We use the term "sadness" as a generic la-
bel for normal and abnormal depressive responses to vari-
ous losses.) This asymmetry raises the question of whether
the DSM is justified in singling out bereavement as the
only type of loss that produces normal intense sadness
symptomatically similar to MDE.
Historical precedent, common sense, and research on
loss responses all suggest that many types of losses can trig-
ger intense normal sadness. From early Greek and Ro-
man physicians through Kraepelin and Freud to pre-DSM-
III diagnostic manuals, psychiatric thought generally
differentiated depressive disorder from symptomatically
similar sadness resulting from various losses including not
only bereavement but also romantic betrayal and rejec-
tion, economic misfortune, severe physical illness, loss of
cherishedpossessions,andfailuretoattainimportantgoals,
among others.7-9
As is the case in bereavement,10,11 ample research sug-
gests that many other types of loss, such as marital dis-
solution, unexpected job loss, and natural disasters, can
trigger intense sadness that soon after the loss may sat-
isfy MDD symptom criteria yet often naturally desists with
time or when circumstances improve.12-21 Such intense
sadness responses to major nonbereavement losses are
generally considered normal.7,8,22 Moreover, the evi-
dence suggests that intense sadness is a biologically de-
signed response to a broad range of circumstances, in-
cluding separation from a love object and loss of social
status.23,24 Evolutionary approaches to the distinction be-
tween normal and disordered functioning,25-28 there-
fore, imply that depressive symptoms should not auto-
matically be classified as a disorder, even at levels that
satisfy DSM symptom criteria, without considering the
nature of their trigger. From this perspective, bereave-
ment may be considered a model for other types of loss
responses, which might similarly be grounds for exclu-
sion from a diagnosis of MDD.
Like bereavement, other stressors may also trigger com-
plicated, truly disordered reactions. Consequently, if the
bereavement exclusion were extended to other stress-
ors to avert false-positive diagnoses, the distinction be-
tween complicated vs uncomplicated bereavement would
also have to be applied to other stressors to avoid false-
negative diagnoses.
Our overarching view is that the DSM uncompli-
cated vs complicated bereavement distinction reflects
likely nondisorder vs disorder but that grief is not unique
in this regard and the same approach has comparable va-
lidity for reactions to other types of loss. We tested 2 spe-
cific hypotheses predicted by this view. First, uncompli-
cated bereavement and uncomplicated reactions to other
losses are no different across a range of variables gener-
ally considered indicative of disorder (eg, duration, re-
currence, and service use). Second, uncomplicated re-
sponses to bereavement and to other losses are less severe
on such disorder indicators than are complicated reac-
tions to either type of trigger. In effect, the second hy-
pothesis is a validity check on the uncomplicated-
complicated distinction.
METHODS
SAMPLE
It is difficult to compare complicated and uncomplicated epi-
sodes in clinical samples, which generally exclude individuals
falling under the bereavement exclusion and contain few non-
disordered individuals. Thus, we used publicly available data
from the first-wave National Comorbidity Survey (NCS), a com-
munity-based epidemiological survey administered between Sep-
tember 14, 1990, and February 6, 1992, to 8098 persons aged
15 to 54 years who are representative of the US population.29
The NCS uses DSM-III-R­derived algorithms for diagnos-
ing disorders, including MDD. Note that DSM-III-R criteria for
MDD differ from DSM-IV criteria because they do not require
clinically significant distress or impairment in addition to symp-
toms. The NCS operationalization of DSM-III-R MDD criteria
require that a respondent satisfy 4 criteria. First, during a 2-week
index episode (for individuals with multiple episodes, the in-
dex episode is the episode with the most symptoms), the re-
spondent must report at least 1 symptom from each of 5 symp-
tom groups or more (constructed to reflect DSM MDD symptom
groups), none of which are from organic causes. For example,
1 symptom group includes lost appetite, lost weight, in-
creased appetite, or increased weight; another includes trouble
in concentrating, slow thinking, or inability to make deci-
sions. As in the DSM, 1 of the 5 endorsed symptom groups must
be either the sad-blue-gloomy group or loss of interest. Sec-
ond, the condition is not covered by the bereavement exclu-
sion (see "Uncomplicated vs Complicated Responses"). Third,
the respondent must never have had mania or hypomania.
Fourth, the respondent does not have delusions or hallucina-
tions indicative of nonaffective psychotic disorder, as indi-
cated by either psychotic diagnoses or the occurrence of psy-
chotic ideation for 2 weeks outside of affective episodes.
ANALYTIC SAMPLE
To test our hypotheses, we formed an overall analytic sample
consisting of 4 subsamples: uncomplicated bereavement trig-
gered (n=56; 6.5% of the analytic sample); complicated bereave-
ment triggered (n=101; 11.6%); uncomplicated other loss trig-
gered (n=174; 20.1%); and complicated other loss triggered
(n=536; 61.8%). These groups are derived from the NCS sample

in several steps; they exclude a considerable number of cases in
which the NCS data set does not contain the necessary informa-
tion. The Figure shows the sequence of steps by which the ana-
lytic sample and its subgroups were identified. (The precise al-
gorithms are available from the authors on request.)
To persons meeting lifetime NCS criteria for MDD, we added
those who meet other MDD criteria but are eliminated from
MDD by the bereavement exclusion (n=65), yielding the MDD
pool (n=1308). All subsequent analyses use this expanded MDD
pool to enable comparisons of uncomplicated and compli-
cated bereavement.
We next identified 2 MDD pool subsamples who reported
that either grief or other triggering events caused their epi-
sodes (typical NCS questions were as follows: "Did that pe-
riod of feeling sad/blue occur just after someone close to you
died?" "Was there anything else going on in your life at that
time which caused you to feel sad/blue?"). For analytic pur-
poses, it is essential to identify the trigger of the index episode
because that is the only episode for which the NCS reports de-
tailed symptom information. (The index episode for single-
episode cases is the individual's only episode; for multiple-
episode cases, it is the individual's worst episode in terms of
number of symptoms, or, if no episode is worse than others,
themostrecentepisode.)Toidentifybereavement-triggeredcases
(n=157), we used the NCS algorithm for bereavement to iden-
tify individuals whose index episode of MDD was bereavement-
triggered. The NCS instrument is such that only by identify-
ing those multiple-episode cases with all grief episodes could
we identify cases in which the index episode was bereavement
triggered; thus, even for multiple-episode cases, this is a pure
bereavement sample. Analogously, other loss­triggered cases
(n=710) included those in which the index episode was trig-
gered by other loss, and multiple-episode cases included those
in which no other episodes were bereavement triggered. This
algorithm allows nonindex other loss­triggered episodes to be
untriggered, but the NCS data do not permit us to determine
exactly how often this occurred. However, the overall rate of
untriggered episodes in the sample was so low (5% of single-
episode cases and 4% of index episodes in multiple-episode
cases) that this approximation to a purely other loss­triggered
group seems warranted.
Of single-episode MDD pool cases (n=410), 93% were either
bereavement triggered (n=108) or other loss triggered (n=276)
and are included in the analysis. We excluded 5% (n=20) be-
cause they were untriggered and 1% (n=6) because of missing
data. Among multiple-episode MDD pool cases (n=898), 54%
(n=483) had index episode triggers identifiable as grief or other
loss and were included in the analysis. We excluded cases with
missing data (1%; n=6), those with untriggered index epi-
sodes (4%; n=34), and those in which the type of index epi-
sode trigger (bereavement vs other type of loss) could not be
inferred from the data (42%; n=375). The type of index epi-
sode trigger sometimes cannot be inferred because if an indi-
vidual reports experiencing both types of triggers at various
times, there is no way within the NCS data of establishing which
type specifically applies to the index episode.
Our resulting analytic sample (n=867; 44% single-episode
cases and 56% multiple-episode cases) consists of the 66% of the
MDD pool that can be established to be either bereavement-
triggered (n=157) or other loss­triggered (n=710) cases. Mean
(SD) demographic data for the analytic sample were as follows:
age,33.8(9.8)years;sex,60.9%(2.7)female;educationalachieve-
ment, 13.0 (0.1) years; and race/ethnicity, 80% (3.2) white. These
data did not differ significantly from those for the excluded 34%
of the MDD pool. Table 1 indicates that these demographic char-
acteristics are not significantly different between the bereave-
ment- and other loss­triggered categories.
UNCOMPLICATED VS
COMPLICATED RESPONSES
To divide trigger groups into uncomplicated and complicated
categories, we strictly extended the NCS algorithm for differ-
entiating uncomplicated vs complicated bereavement-
triggered episodes to nonbereavement, other loss­triggered epi-
sodes. The NCS algorithm for complicated bereavement is
derived from DSM-III-R criteria. The DSM-III-R exclusion clause,
which differs slightly from the DSM-IV clause, states that "Mor-
bid preoccupation with worthlessness, suicidal ideation, marked
functional impairment or psychomotor retardation, or pro-
longed duration suggest bereavement complicated by major de-

pression."30(p223) The NCS interprets the term "suggest" to mean
that no one symptom is sufficient by itself to imply MDD. There-
fore, the NCS requires 2 symptoms or more for complicated
bereavement, unlike the later 1-symptom DSM-IV approach.
The NCS adds a sixth symptom, suicide attempt, to the DSM-
III-R list; it operationalizes prolonged duration as longer than
12 weeks, and operationalizes marked impairment by agree-
ment with the item, "Kept you from working or from seeing
friends or relatives." Bereavement and other loss­triggered epi-
sodes are considered uncomplicated unless they are classifi-
able as complicated based on having 2 or more of the 6 NCS
duration, impairment, and other symptom features.
We could not evaluate each episode in multiple-episode cases
for complicatedness because the data only contain index epi-
sode symptoms. We followed the NCS algorithm in classify-
ing multiple-episode bereavement cases as uncomplicated or
complicated based on which category applied to the index epi-
sode. The rationale was that the index episode was the indi-
vidual's worst episode and complicated symptoms indicate se-
verity; thus, an uncomplicated index episode likely implies all
uncomplicated episodes. We applied this same procedure in
other loss­triggered cases to identify uncomplicated vs com-
plicated multiple-episode cases. There were no significant demo-
graphic differences among the 4 uncomplicated and compli-
cated bereavement- and other loss­triggered groups for age, sex,
educational achievement, or race/ethnicity (Table 2).
DISORDER INDICATORS
To evaluate whether the 4 groups (uncomplicated vs compli-
cated bereavement-triggered and uncomplicated vs compli-
cated other loss­triggered episodes) differ in disorder vs non-
disorder status, we compared the groups on descriptive variables
that have face validity and are commonly used to indicate dis-
order. Three indicators concern index episode features: sever-
ity (mean number of the 9 MDD symptoms); melancholic de-
pression (percentage of patients satisfying DSM-IV­type criteria
for melancholic depression); and suicide attempt. Although the
suicide attempt indicator is contaminated because it is also an
NCS complicatedness symptom, we included it because we think
it is pragmatically important to establish whether cases involv-
ing suicide attempts would be classified as disorders.
Six other disorder indicators concern lifetime history; thus,
for multiple-episode cases, these indicators do not necessarily
apply specifically to the index episode but set an upper bound-
ary for that episode. These 6 indicators are as follows: dura-
tion (mean duration of the longest episode); interference with
life (whether episode or episodes interfered with life or activi-
ties "a lot"); ever saw a mental health professional because of
depression; ever took medication for depression; was ever hos-
pitalized because of depression; and recurrence (mean num-
ber of episodes). Note that duration is contaminated to some
extent because duration longer than 12 weeks is a symptom of
complicatedness. To reduce the effect of outliers on recur-
rence and duration means, we coded respondents reporting more
than 20 depressive episodes as having 20 episodes, and respon-
dents reporting their longest episode as lasting more than 104
weeks as having a longest episode of 104 weeks.
Interference with life and service use indicators follow the
clinical significance disorder indicators of Narrow et al.31 Ser-
vice use indicators are based on disorder-specific questions (eg,
seeing a professional because of depression) to minimize con-
founding by service use for comorbid conditions.32 A long tra-
dition considers melancholic depression as indicating disor-
der.7 We constructed criteria that approximate DSM-IV
melancholic depression criteria, requiring inability to enjoy usual
activities plus 3 or more of the following: retardation observed
by others, or agitation; feel bad in the morning; early awaken-
ing (at least 2 hours early); lost weight; and excessive feelings
of guilt.
STATISTICAL ANALYSES
Tests of Significance
All data used in the analyses were weighted and corrected for
sampling design. Statistical analyses were performed using the
surveyestimationproceduresinSTATAsoftware,version9(Stata-
Corp, College Station, Tex), which calculate weighted coeffi-
cients and use Taylor series linearization to calculate SE. Analy-
sis of variance with planned comparisons were used to determine
the mean differences between groups. When doing the planned
comparisons, the nature of our 2 hypotheses dictated different
statistical procedures. We used 2-tailed tests to evaluate the hy-
pothesisthatuncomplicatedbereavement-triggeredvsotherloss­
triggered episodes are not different on disorder indicators. Be-
cause we predicted that uncomplicated categories would be lower
than complicated categories on disorder indicators, we used
1-tailed tests of our second hypothesis.
Statistical Power
Becauseourhypothesesproposenosignificantdifferencesinmean
values of indicator variables between 2 groups (uncomplicated
bereavement-triggeredvsuncomplicatedotherloss­triggeredepi-
sodes), statistical power is an important concern. According to
Cohen,33 small, medium, and large effect sizes would corre-
spond to mean differences of 0.2, 0.5, and 0.8 SD, respectively,
which would require roughly 400, 60, and 25 cases, respec-
tively,toachievegoodstatisticalpower(power=.80)forthe2-tailed
testsandroughly300,50,and20cases,respectively,forthe1-tailed
tests. An example of a small mean difference would be 10 weeks'
duration, 0.3 in interference score, and 6% for proportion of cases
seeing a mental health provider. Medium effect size for the same
analyses would be 26 weeks' duration, 0.75 in interference score,
and 15% for proportion of cases seeing a mental health provider.
Most of the analyses in this study contained sufficient numbers

differences.
RESULTS
Data in Table 3 confirm 8 of 9 predictions stemming
from our first hypothesis that uncomplicated bereave-
ment-triggered and other loss­triggered cases do not dif-
fer on indicators of disorder. The sole exception is that

more individuals in the other loss­triggered group than
the bereavement-triggered group (12.4% vs 4.6%) re-
ported that their condition interferes with life "a lot."
We also compared uncomplicated bereavement-
triggered cases with uncomplicated other loss­
triggered cases on MDE symptom groups because sub-
stantial differences might suggest a difference in disorder
status. (Symptom differences between uncomplicated and
complicated cases are assured by definition.) No signifi-
cant differences were found for 8 of 9 symptom groups
(see Table 4). The only significant difference is that the
uncomplicated bereavement-triggered group endorsed the
suicide and death thought symptom group more fre-
quently (80.6%) than the uncomplicated other loss­
triggered group (42.9%). This difference is entirely at-
tributable to a significant difference between the 2 groups
in "thought about death" (78.6% vs 33.3%; t=6.3), which
is understandable because the bereaved have recently been
exposed to the death of a loved one.
Table 3 also gives the results of tests of our second
hypothesis, that uncomplicated bereavement- and other
loss­triggered cases are lower on disorder indicators than
complicated bereavement- and other loss­triggered cases.
Seven indicators fully confirm this hypothesis: severity,
melancholic depression, suicide attempt, duration, in-
terference, saw a professional, and took medication. The
remaining 2 indicators partially confirm the hypothesis.
Results for hospitalization support 3 of 4 subhypoth-
eses, but, contrary to our prediction, individuals in the
uncomplicated bereavement group are not less likely to
be hospitalized than are those in the complicated other
loss group. Results for recurrence confirm 2 of 4 subhy-
potheses but do not indicate that either uncomplicated
bereavement- or uncomplicated other loss­triggered cases
are significantly less likely than complicated bereave-
ment cases to recur. Examination of significant differ-
ences between complicated and uncomplicated cases in-
dicate that the effect sizes are medium to large.
COMMENT
The DSM bereavement exclusion acknowledges that some
intense episodes of sadness that satisfy symptomatic cri-
teria for MDD are not disorders; however, the exclusion
includes only bereavement and not responses to other

losses. Based on traditional distinctions between depres-
sive disorder and normal intense sadness and on an evo-
lutionary view of sadness and disorder, we hypoth-
esized that the bereavement exclusion represents a valid
attempt to avert false-positive diagnoses that applies
equally to other losses. Using NCS data, we tested our
hypothesis that bereavement and other losses are sym-
metric against the contention, implied by the DSM MDD
criteria, that bereavement is categorically different from
other stressors on the dimensions assessed in this study.
Theresultsoverwhelminglysupportourhypotheses.They
confirm 8 of 9 predicted relationships of no difference be-
tween uncomplicated categories, regardless of the type of
trigger, and 33 of 36 predicted directional differences be-
tween uncomplicated and complicated categories.
The results have substantial implications for MDD di-
agnosis,especiallyinasmuchasbereavementorsomeother
loss reportedly precedes more than 90% of index epi-
sodes in MDD cases in the NCS. The results do not sup-
port the current categorical distinction between uncom-
plicated bereavement-triggered and uncomplicated other
loss­triggered episodes. Rather, they imply that if the cur-
rent criteria correctly label uncomplicated depressive epi-
sodes after death of a loved one as nondisorders, then
uncomplicated episodes that occur after other losses are
also plausibly nondisordered. Moreover, the differences
between uncomplicated and complicated cases suggest
that the bereavement exclusion reflects a valid distinc-
tion. Overall, our results suggest a potentially serious prob-
lem with MDD in the diagnosis of responses to major non-
bereavement losses.
These results also have implications for MDD preva-
lence. The NCS reports a lifetime prevalence of 14.9%
for MDD, a figure that has caused much skepticism.2 Ex-
tending the bereavement exclusion to our other loss­
triggered group, of which 24.5% of cases (2.2% of the total
NCS sample) were uncomplicated, reduces NCS MDD
prevalenceto12.7%.However,ouranalysisexcludesmany
triggered cases because the trigger was unidentifiable. Ex-
cluding from diagnosis all NCS MDD cases with a trig-
ger that were uncomplicated decreases MDD preva-
lence to 11.3%, an overall reduction of almost one fourth
(24.2%). The 1-year NCS MDD rate of 8.6% would be
similarly reduced about one fourth, to 6.5%.
Despite overall strong support for our hypotheses, there
are several exceptions. Contrary to our first hypothesis,
significantly fewer uncomplicated bereavement- than un-
complicated other loss­triggered cases report that de-
pressive episodes interfered with life a lot (4.6% vs 12.4%;
t=2.62). This finding is not repeated with other clinical-
significance measures, and both uncomplicated catego-
ries are substantially lower on interference than either
complicated bereavement-triggered or complicated other
loss­triggered categories (grief, 4.6% vs 46.2%; other loss,
12.4% vs 47.3%). One possible explanation for this find-
ing is that bereavement is a socially acknowledged and
frequently ritualized experience that often legitimates ex-
cuses from normal responsibilities. In contrast, social
norms are less likely to allow withdrawal from normal
role functioning in other loss­triggered cases; thus, greater
interference with expectable levels of social engage-
ment and responsibility might be experienced.
Contrary to our second hypothesis, the 5% of hospi-
talized patients with uncomplicated bereavement-
triggered sadness is not significantly lower than the 8.9%
of hospitalized patients with complicated other loss­
triggered sadness (t=0.87). We speculate that if bereave-
ment is more likely than other triggers to be considered
a health risk, providers may occasionally hospitalize pa-
tients with uncomplicated sadness as a preventive mea-
sure. This is an area worthy of further investigation.
Also contrary to our second hypothesis, neither un-
complicated bereavement-triggered episodes nor uncom-
plicated other loss­triggered episodes are significantly
lower than complicated bereavement in mean recur-
rence. However, these findings have a simple explana-
tion; bereavement episodes, by definition, occur only af-
ter the death of a loved one and, thus, are severely
constrained insofar as recurrence. Thus, the failure of this
prediction seems less a disconfirmation than an anoma-
lous situation.
This study has several limitations. The age range of
the NCS sample (15-54 years) means that the sample does
not include the elderly, a major group affected by be-
reavement and other losses, and a target of much recent
depression research; it remains for future research to dem-
onstrate whether the present results can be generalized
to this important group. Another limitation is that we
eliminated from analysis a substantial number of NCS
multiple-episode MDD cases in which it was reported that
the index episode was triggered, because the nature of
the NCS data does not allow us to identify the type of
trigger (bereavement vs other loss). In addition, we con-
servatively accepted the NCS algorithm for identifying
uncomplicated vs complicated episodes and did not em-
pirically examine alternative formulations. Further-
more, the accuracy of the NCS respondents' self-reports
of triggering events is unknown; respondents may mis-
remember whether there was an event or whether the tim-
ing of an event was before an episode or may misat-
tribute the cause of an episode to an event when they were

coincidental. However, depressive symptoms can be mi-
sattributed to death of a loved one and to other losses,
and the crucial complicated vs uncomplicated distinc-
tion we used is based on symptom reports and not on
causal self-attributions alone.
Another limitation is that we were unable to examine
the qualitative nature of nonbereavement triggers; such
qualitative data were collected but are not publicly avail-
ablebecauseofinstitutionalreviewboardrestrictions.Con-
sequently, we were unable to examine distinctions among
nongrief stressors or to make finer discriminations of pro-
portionality between stressor and symptoms, for ex-
ample, to judge when a reported trigger is not major and
perhaps is so mild as to potentially suggest disorder even
in uncomplicated episodes. Future studies should be de-
signed to identify and evaluate the stressors directly. Un-
complicated bereavement-triggered and uncomplicated
other loss­triggered groups might differ in ways we did
not detect; we can only say that at the level of detection
these data make possible, there is no reason to consider
other loss­triggered conditions as substantially different
from bereavement conditions on disorder indicators and,
thus, no support for the current DSM asymmetry in ap-
plying the complicated vs uncomplicated distinction to be-
reavement but not to other stressors.
CONCLUSIONS
These results, even if replicated, cannot by themselves
fully resolve the issue of when to consider uncompli-
cated depressive episodes as nondisordered. While there
are clear cases of complicated conditions that are disor-
ders and uncomplicated conditions that are nondisor-
ders, there is also growing awareness that depressive symp-
toms occur on a continuum; thus, many clinical patients
might not fall clearly to one side or the other of the dis-
order-nondisorder divide. Moreover, it might be argued
that our results for the disorder indicators are consis-
tent with the position that uncomplicated episodes in re-
sponse to both bereavement and other stressors are merely
mild disorders. For example, Zisook et al,34 also noting
the asymmetry between bereavement and other losses in
DSM MDD criteria, claim that the bereavement exclu-
sion should be eliminated: "No other life event (or pre-
cipitant) negates the diagnosis of depression when the
full syndrome occurs. It is not clear why death of a loved
one should cancel out the diagnosis of major depressive
disorder, either."34(p229)
Our findings, therefore, directly challenge only the cur-
rent asymmetry between bereavement and other loss situ-
ations in the MDD bereavement exclusion. Given the ab-
sence of an objective gold standard for differentiating
clinical depression from normal sadness, further empiri-
cal research should explore the prognostic, treatment, and
policy implications of different classifications of uncom-
plicated nonbereavement episodes, as well as the con-
ceptual underpinnings of MDD.
Traditionally, diagnosis of depressive disorder re-
flected the notion that sadness in response to loss is natu-
ral and normal and that the indication of disorder lies in
the sadness being without sufficient cause in given en-
vironmental contexts or being disproportional to actual
loss.7 The DSM MDD complicated bereavement exclu-
sion can be interpreted to mean that clinical depression
should be diagnosed if the response is symptomatically
out of proportion even to loss of a loved one. In attempt-
ing to extend the bereavement exclusion to reactions other
than grief, further research is required to determine
whether DSM-type symptom severity criteria should also
be adopted for other stressors or, as much research sug-
gests,12,35,36 some more complex measure of proportion-
ality that considers the typical or individual meaning of
the stressor is necessary and clinically feasible. In addi-
tion, some other losses (eg, financial reversal or marital
alienation) may be less clear-cut than death of a loved
one and it may be harder to judge the severity of these
losses, leading to challenges to reliable measurement. The
importance of reliability, however, does not obviate the
need to address substantial failures of validity. Al-
though death is clear-cut, the bereavement exclusion it-
self depends on the complicated-uncomplicated distinc-
tion, which is not clear-cut.
In extending our results to clinical practice, we do not
intend to suggest that treatment after major stressors is
appropriate only for individuals experiencing compli-
cated episodes. So-called uncomplicated episodes can in-
volve substantial suffering and, in vulnerable individu-
als, may evolve into complicated episodes. Treatment,
including psychotherapy or medication,33 may some-
times be appropriate for intense normal sadness. Never-
theless, the current DSM distinction between compli-
cated vs uncomplicated bereavement-triggered depression
has implications for treatment planning, prognosis, and
stigmatization. Our results suggest that the same rea-
sons dictate recognition of intense normal sadness re-
sponses to stressors other than bereavement. If further
research confirms these findings, the DSM MDD bereave-
ment exclusion likely should be reconsidered in DSM-V,
with equal attention to bereavement and nonbereave-
ment triggers of intense sadness.
