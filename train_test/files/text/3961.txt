Abstract. Depth is the feeling of remoteness, or separateness, that accompanies awareness in
human modalities like vision and audition. In specific cases depths can be graded on an ordinal
scale, or even measured quantitatively on an interval scale. In the case of pictorial vision this is
complicated by the fact that human observers often appear to apply mental transformations that
involve depths in distinct visual directions. This implies that a comparison of empirically determined
depths between observers involves pictorial space as an integral entity, whereas comparing pictorial
depths as such is meaningless. We describe the formal structure of pictorial space purely in the
phenomenological domain, without taking recourse to the theories of optics which properly apply to
physical space--a distinct ontological domain. We introduce a number of general ways to design and
implement methods of geodesy in pictorial space, and discuss some basic problems associated with
such measurements. We deal mainly with conceptual issues.
Keywords: depth, range, pictorial depth, depth scales, pictorial vision, pictorial relief, monocular stereopsis, depth

1 Introduction
"Depth", as used in the experimental psychology of visual perception (Gibson 1950; Palmer
1999), is conventionally defined as the subjective correlate of "range", where range is the
distance of a fiducial object to the vantage point.(1) For simplicity we consider only the
monocular observer. Then the vantage point is--for all practical purposes--the center of
rotation of the eyeball (Graham 1965; von Helmholtz 1856). It is conventionally regarded as
the task of vision to coordinate depth with range as well as possible. This is the mainstream
ideal of veridical perception (Marr 1982). Perhaps unfortunately, this turns the bulk of depth-
related vision research into a normative, rather than descriptive, enterprise.
There are conceptual problems with this view. For instance, as Wittgenstein (1921)
observes in Tractatus (our translation):
5.632 The subject is not in the world, but is a boundary of the world.
5.633 Where in the world does one find a metaphysical subject? You say, it is much
like the case of the eye and the visual field. But you don't really see the eye. No
feature of the visual field allows you to conclude that it is seen from an eye.
One arrives at the paradoxical situation that depth is supposed to be a correlate of range,
whereas the eye and the object are not even together in visual awareness. The mainstream
(1)One often uses "distance" instead of range. We refrain from this in order to avoid certain inconsisten-
cies. For instance, distances in three-dimensional Euclidean space are properties of nonoriented line
segments, whereas range is a property of a direction which is obviously oriented. This is a categorical
difference. The literature rarely makes the distinction.
542 J J Koenderink, A J van Doorn, J Wagemans
view is that of an external observer. It fails to apply to the content of visual awareness, which
is necessarily a first-person account.(2)
A truly phenomenological account of depth--from the inside out, as it were--is required
in order to arrive at the beginning of a psychological theory.
For the case of pictorial space this is the only rational starting point, because the notion
of range is irrelevant to visual awareness. Only for the case of vision-in-the-world does one
also require the relation to range. We have studied this extensively in our earlier work (Hecht
et al 1999; Koenderink and van Doorn 1998a; Koenderink et al 2000; 2002a, 2002b; 2003;
2008). The theory of physical range is already in place. It is Euclidean geometry (for Euclid,
see Burton 1945). What are needed in order to handle depth are forms of psychophysical
bridge hypotheses and ways of operationalization of various aspects of depth.
There is a pervasive trend to consider pictorial vision as a limiting case of vision-in-the-
world (Gibson 1950). This involves treating the picture as a window on a physical scene--
so-called "Alberti's window" (Alberti and Grayson 1972; Pirenne 1970). This would indeed
put the eye in pictorial space (eg, at the "perspective center") and thus reduce all problems
of pictorial perception to generic visual perception. Although thus highly attractive to the
mainstream, it is a limiting, artificial case that can be approached only in laboratory settings.
It is too restricted to be of much interest in the study of pictorial vision per se.(3),(4)
In this paper we attempt to construct an account of depth from the inside out, and we
consider bridging hypotheses and aspects of various operational definitions of depth.
2 Depth
2.1 Depth as feeling
Phenomenologically, perhaps the most basic meaning of depth is as a general feeling of
separateness from the self, or remoteness. One is indeed tempted to say "remoteness from the
self", but in immediate visual awareness the self does not necessary figure at all. Immediate
awareness is of the nature of "presentation", something just happening, out of voluntary
control, and prereflective.
In this sense remoteness, or separateness, occurs in all modalities, though perhaps in
some more readily than in others. In humans it most prominently occurs in vision and
audition, to a lesser extent in touch, and to an even lesser extent in gustatory and olfactory
awareness. It is likely to be different in your cat or dog, and so forth. We can only guess with
respect to sonar in bats, electroperception in sharks, and the like (Nagel 1974).
(2) Even this is saying too much because visual awareness does not imply the notion of an ego.
(3) We find repeatedly (Koenderink et al 2009) that human observers treat the "visual directions" as
being lines perpendicular to the picture plane, thus all mutually parallel. Notice that this would place
the eye at "minus infinity"--that is to say, outside pictorial space proper.
(4) A good operational definition of the pictorial mode is to move your head or body. If you move
somewhat in front of a painting, nothing much changes in pictorial space. In contradistinction, if
you move your head when you presume to look into a window, you will notice peculiar, nonrigid
deformations. This is a common experience when viewing baroque ceiling paintings. These are often
of great extent and at considerable distance. If well painted, then they easily beat any "virtual reality"
setup we have ever seen. The famous example (due to Pirenne 1970) is Pozzo's ceiling painting in the
church of Sant'Ignazio at Rome, but Europe (especially Germany, Austria, and Italy) is full of examples
like this. Such deformations signify that your visual awareness is that of a window to which your eye is
attached. On the other hand, the absence of such deformations when viewing a painting shows that
your visual awareness is that of looking at a picture. Your eye is attached to the picture plane, but not
to the pictorial space.
Depth 543
The feeling of separateness is perhaps induced through the feeling of being acted upon.
Action and suffering(5) are common to all life forms, including the most primitive ones
(Schrödinger 1992).
2.2 Ordinal depth
Visual awareness can be more or less articulate. As one looks into a Ganzfeld the awareness
is that of a luminous foggy atmosphere (Metzger 1953). It is indeed "out there" (remote), but
the remoteness has no "value" (in a numerical sense). In perhaps more common cases visual
awareness tends to be more articulate. In such cases the mere feeling of remoteness admits
to degrees and can often be correlated with a scale.
If you articulate the visual field, for instance by presenting a statistically uniform
arrangement of polka dots instead of a uniform field (Ganzfeld), most observers become
aware of a surface (Koenderink et al 2009).(6) The surface is apparently at a particular depth,
because it is "thin" and "located", but it is entirely undetermined what that depth is. The very
notion of "(absolute) location in depth" is alien to the awareness. The surface just is--who
knows where exactly?
From a formal, geometrical point of view one concludes that depth seems to have a single
dimension, no obvious limits, and no origin (anchor) or unit (yardstick). A suitable model
might be the geometrical line without additional properties.
That depth admits of something like a "location" becomes clear when you add various
"cues". By cue we mean any aspect of image structure that happens to influence the depth
experience, not necessarily admitting of a physical or physiological "explanation" (Berkeley
1709). For instance, if we--in the aforementioned example--vary the individual sizes or
colors of the polka dots, one tends to become aware of modulations of depth. The simplest
example is the basic figure­ground distinction. The figure is experienced as "in front of" the
ground. This may lead to arbitrarily long sequences of depths (Figure 1); thus it introduces
an ordinal depth scale.
Figure 1. The picture at left is usually seen as a series of square tiles, stacked in depth. This depth order
is roughly as shown in the volumetric view at center. The red arrow indicates the direction of view. In
the alternative configuration at right one has a stack of rectangular tiles, with the right--instead of the
left--one nearest to the viewer. This is another interpretation of the same picture at left. Both center
and right interpretations of the picture at left are equally "valid" (both yield the projection shown at
left), although the depth orders are mutually reversed.
From a formal, geometrical perspective the depth line becomes near-/far-polarized and
admits of a serial order of points.
(5) Being acted upon, perhaps through the encounter of a resistance to an action, may be denoted
"suffering", because it is not self-initiated.
(6) In our experiment one out of eighty observers became aware of a volume filled with spheres,
whereas all others reported to see a surface.
544 J J Koenderink, A J van Doorn, J Wagemans
Notice that such a depth order is defined only locally. Globally, the depth order (if any) is
only a partial order (Figure 2). Thus it is possible to speak of the depth order (which may or
may not be defined or may be ambiguous) of points in the visual field, though not necessarily
of a depth order of extended objects.
Figure 2. The red ring is neither fully in front nor fully behind the blue beam. Locally, both cases occur.
2.3 Depth scales
In many cases one is aware of a depth order that appears to be more strongly developed than
just ordinal. "Absolute depth" is a meaningless notion in any case, but it is often possible to
mutually compare depth differences, and perhaps there is even a notion of depth difference
magnitude.
From a formal, geometrical point of view this implies that one has an affine scale. This
involves a numerical measure, say a real number, characterizing the depth. Since the depth
domain has no obvious boundary, this number may be taken to range from minus to plus
infinity. For any given point two observers will most likely come up with different numerical
depth values. But this does not mean anything in the absence of a natural origin and unit
measure. One might capture this by saying that the depth is only relevant modulo(7) an
arbitrary offset and unit (see Figure 3). Then the depth values assigned by the two observers
no longer count as distinct.

Figure 3. The notion of "affine line". The red point has coordinate 0.5 in the upper, but 1.666... in
the lower scales. These scales are fully equivalent. They have different origins and units. Every affine
property works equally well in either scale. For instance, the midpoint of the segment defined by two
arbitrary points can be calculated (by taking the average) on either scale. Although the numbers (the
coordinates) will differ, the point (as located on the corresponding scale) will be the same.
At the close of the 19th century the German sculptor Adolf Hildebrand (1901) noticed that
human observers have difficulty discriminating work "in the round" from work "in relief".
(7)Modulo is a standard technical term used in formal discussions. It means "disregarding certain
variations regarded as irrelevant". For instance, a geometrical configuration modulo position, size, and
spatial attitude is "shape".
Depth 545
In his ground-breaking book The Problem of Form he argued that the actual depth relief is
largely irrelevant to human vision, though--of course--not to touch.(8)
From a formal, geometrical point of view this implies that an augmented transformation
that not only adds an arbitrary shift but also scales depth by an arbitrary (but positive)
amount leaves the description invariant. This means that the depth domain is the "affine
line"--that is, the real numbers modulo an arbitrary scaling and offset.
In the 1990s we (empirically, and only by accident!) discovered another basic ambiguity
(Koenderink et al 2001). Human observers largely agree in their depth judgments modulo a
transformation of an even further augmented type than with only scaling and offset--namely,
with additional changes of the apparent frontal plane. In many cases their numerical depth
judgments fail to correlate in a straight regression, whereas a multiple regression including
the picture plane coordinates, perhaps surprisingly, reveals that the correlations are typically
very high! This implies that the depth scales differ systematically for various points in the
picture plane.
Each point of the picture plane carries the full depth dimension. We denote these depth
dimensions "depth threads". Thus pictorial space is a sheaf of depth threads. The structure of
the picture plane serves to parameterize (label) them. Each thread carries its own ordinal
depth scale. The finding mentioned above implies that these depth scales are different
(a straight regression of depths reveals no correlation), though somehow coordinated (a
multiple regression including the label "which thread" yields a high correlation).
Consider a plane in pictorial space that meets every thread just once. Any generic plane
will do. Such a plane implies a depth value at every point of the picture plane. The results
of depth measurements for different observers typically differ by exactly such an "additive
plane". It is as if observers may take different planes to be the (or their) "frontal plane".(9) This
is an unexpected, and from a mainstream perspective surprising, finding.
A geometrical way to put this is to say that observers impose a "gauge" (or "gauge field")
on their pictorial space that can be represented as a pair of mutually parallel planes (see
Figure 4). Such a gauge imposes an origin and unit point on all threads. It serves to mutually
coordinate the depth scales on the various threads. Each observer (or the same observer at
different occasions) applies an idiosyncratic gauge. As a consequence one cannot merely
consider depth as such (that is to say, per visual direction), but one is forced to consider
pictorial space as an integral entity. This has very important consequences for the analysis of
psychophysical results. Perhaps unfortunately, the literature has been slow to take this up.
A naive analysis will use a default gauge that assigns the picture plane as base plane, con-
ventionally denoted frontal plane. Unfortunately, observers often do not comply. Moreover,
different observers make different choices. Failure to pick up on this is an important cause of
trouble with literature results.
A gauge has four degrees of freedom. It can be thought of as composed of a shift in
depth (one parameter), a scaling of depth (another parameter), and an additive plane (an
additional pair of parameters). For zero shift, unit scaling, and a fronto-parallel additive plane
one obtains simply the identity.(10) If you apply two of these transformations in succession (a
concatenation of gauges), you obtain just another gauge. Formally, one says that the gauge
(8)The reason is that Hildebrand (1901) defines "pure vision" (or "artistic vision") as vision based on a
single viewpoint. In contrast, binocular vision and motion parallax are more like touch in the sense of
providing multiple (simultaneous or successive) viewpoints.
(9) This representation of the depth domain is formally identical to the "bas-relief ambiguity",
sometimes called "relief scaling and additive plane", of computer vision (Belhumeur et al 1999).
(10) An identity is a transformation that leaves everything the same. Such transformations are
conventionally designated "identities" in formal discussions.

Figure 4. A "gauge" is a pair of parallel planes, a "base plane" B (in red), and a "unit plane" U (in
blue). The gauge induces a scale in every depth thread (such as aa and bb ), the intersection with
the base plane being the "origin" and the intersection with the unit plane the point at unit distance
from the origin. Notice that the gauge serves to mutually relate the depth scales of all threads. The
gauge induces different origins on the threads and synchronizes their units. In this picture the depth
dimension extends vertically; the top and bottom planes of the box suggest a default gauge, which is
parallel to the picture plane. The points on the thread have unit spacing. They serve to define depth
numerically (as illustrated on aa and bb ), though for each thread individually. Each thread has its
own scale as defined by the gauge.
transformations form a group,(11) which may be called the group of "depth similarities". If
the scaling is constrained to be one, you obtain a subgroup of "depth motions". The group of
depth motions is commutative;(12) it does not matter in what order you apply motions, the
result is always the same.
The gauge imposed by observers was already intuited by Hildebrand (1901), who
suggested that one should conceive of depth as of the relation of an object with respect
to two mutually parallel glass panes. This is just an implementation of a gauge. The insights
of Hildebrand are surprising in view of the fact that modern science (early 21st century), has
still to catch up with him!
2.4 The abacus model
The group of depth motions by definition leaves the structure of pictorial space invariant, by
exactly the same philosophy that underlies the notion of "congruency" in Euclidean space:
if two configurations can be superimposed through a motion, then they are considered to
be geometrically identical. Notice that changes of gauge (the depth similarities) conserve a
depth thread (visual direction) as a whole; they merely shift depth values along the threads
(visual directions).
This gives rise to an intuitive model of pictorial space that we will refer to as the "abacus
model". Remember that an abacus is a frame with a set of parallel wires on which you may
shift beads. In the model we usually consider only a single bead per wire. The wires signify
the depth threads, or visual directions, whereas the beads indicate depth values. Shifting the
beads mimics the process in microgeny(13) that establishes pictorial depth. Thus this part of
microgeny (Brown 2002) appears much like a Glasperlenspiel (Hesse 1943).
(11) It is not hard to work out the nature of multiplication in the group, and one easily constructs the
inverse of a gauge. The inverse always exists, and is unique.
(12)The full group of similarities is not commutative (or Abelian), though.
(13) "Microgenesis" is the term in phenomenological analysis that designates the process that generates
visual awareness. It remains itself unconscious and is known only through its result.
Depth 547
Notice that each location of the visual field(14) carries its own thread (depth direction)
and that all threads are mutually isolated from each other. Thus the wires of the abacus are
mutually unconnected and never merge. If we push all beads to their resting position (thereby
"forgetting" all depth values), we "project" pictorial space on the picture plane. The artist
who--for compositional purposes--views his or her painting as a quilt of colored patches
applies such a projection. This feat takes practice, and most naive observers (nonartists)
never achieve it.(15)
The abacus model is evidently some kind of three-dimensional space. The essential
difference between the abacus model and, for example, the familiar Euclidean three-
dimensional space is that the visual directions are mutually isolated. Thus you cannot
rotate about a line in the picture plane, as this would "mix up visual directions". Such a
rotation would reveal the back of the head of a portrait painted en face, thus such a constraint
certainly makes good sense. But remember that you can apparently (mentally) "rotate"
the apparent frontal plane! It merely takes a change of gauge. Fortunately, this is a non-
Euclidean transformation that does not mix up visual directions, as will be shown below. In
the abacus model the picture plane is "given", whereas the microgenetic process underlying
visual awareness shifts depth values along the visual directions as beads along the strings of
an abacus. In this Glasperlenspiel such shifts are supposedly induced by the various cues
identified by the microgeny (Figure 5).
Figure 5. An impression of the "abacus model" of pictorial space. The yellow "base space" is the picture
plane; the red spheres indicate some fiducial locations in the picture plane. The gray vertical rods are
the "wires" of the model; they stand for the depth threads (visual directions) associated with the points.
The blue spheres indicate the "beads" of the model; they can be shifted to indicate depth values. Each
bead slides only over its own wire. Here microgeny has placed the beads in the position of an additive
plane. This "cross-section" indicates a pictorial relief (which is flat in this case!).
The final presentation, and the cues on which it is based, develop together, in close
synchrony. Thus one cannot say that the presentation is a result of some algorithm applied to
(14)We let the picture plane double for the visual field for the sake of this paper.
(15) Formally, the abacus model is a "fiber bundle" over the Euclidean plane ("base plane", here the
picture plane), the "fibers" (the threads are technically known as "fibers") being the affine line (the
visual directions) and the "bundle projection" the projection mentioned here (Husemöller 1994).
548 J J Koenderink, A J van Doorn, J Wagemans
some set of pre-established cues, which is perhaps closest to the current mainstream notion.
Rather:
there is no presentation without cues, but neither are there cues without the
presentation.
This is an essential point that tends to be ignored in mainstream accounts.
The geometrical entities that make up pictorial space are defined as the invariants of the
transformations (Klein 1893) in the abacus model discussed above. That is to say, they have
an existence that is independent of the actual description in terms of depth per se. They are
defined in terms of what remains untouched after you subject that description to arbitrary
transformations of the group of motions or similarities. Empirically, we have encountered
frequent examples where observers of the same picture did not agree at all in terms of their
depths, but very well in terms of the implied geometrical entities (Koenderink et al 2001).
This should be crucial in any account of pictorial perception. A simulated example is shown
in Figures 6 and 7.
Figure 6. At left a set of depth values, each on their own depth thread. At right the same configuration
has been changed through an "additive plane". The additive plane is indicated with the red line. The
consequences of the additive plane are discussed in the next figure (Figure 7).
2.5 Geometry of pictorial space
Much additional geometrical structure can easily be grafted on the abacus model.
Regard two distinct points of pictorial space. We define their "proper distance" as the
familiar Euclidean distance of their projections on the picture plane. This makes sense,
because it is obviously invariant with respect to the group of depth similarities.
But what if this distance vanishes? Then the points might still be distinct! Such points we
call mutually parallel. In such a case of "parallel points" we define their "special distance" as
the depth difference of these points. (We use quotes to indicate that these are not Euclidean
terms.) Notice that this makes sense only if the proper distance vanishes, for otherwise a
depth motion could change this special distance. Finally, we define "the" distance as either
the proper or the special distance, according to which one applies. This distance is evidently
an invariant of any pair of points, whether parallel or not.

Figure 7. At left the depth values corresponding to the cases illustrated in the previous figure (Figure
6) are shown in a scatter plot. Notice that the additive plane has destroyed the correlation, as the
coefficient of variation is rather low. At right a multiple correlation that includes the position in the
picture plane. This serves to "correct for" the different gauge. It is seen that the two depth distributions
are after all identical. Gauges often suffice to "explain" the differences in depths for different observers.
In such cases we say that the observers are aware of the same depth configuration and differ in only
their "mental perspective" on it. Failure to notice this would lead to the (erroneous!) conclusion that
the observers have fully different geometrical structures in visual awareness.
The shift parameter does not affect the proper distance, and acts the same on all wires
of the abacus. It may thus be interpreted as a depth "translation". However, the additive
planes do act differently on different wires. We will show that they are naturally interpreted
as (non-Euclidean) rotations. Finally, Hildebrand's relief parameter can be interpreted as a
kind of scaling,(16) because it changes all special distances by the same factor. A "change of
gauge" implies both a motion (translation and rotation) and a scaling.
The slant difference of two lines with the same projection in the pictorial plane may be
defined as the special distance of any parallel points on them, divided by the proper distance
of these points to the intersection of the lines (Figure 8). In this definition a rotation adds the
same amount to the slopes of all lines that project on the same direction in the picture plane.
This justifies both the definition of "rotation" and of "slant" (that is, non-Euclidean angle,
Figure 9; Sachs 1990; Strubecker 1941, 1942, 1943, 1945; Yaglom 1968, 1979).
The slant of a plane is defined as the maximum slant of any line contained in it, whereas
the tilt of a plane is defined as the direction in the picture plane of that maximally slanted
line.
A pure rotation leaves a certain line in the picture plane invariant (which may be called
the axis of rotation) and changes the slopes of all lines perpendicular (in the picture plane)
to the axis by the amount of the rotation.
Notice that slants span the range of minus to plus infinity, thus the angle measure is not
periodic as in Euclidean space. As mentioned earlier, this forces pictorial objects always to
show their same side. You can never see their back sides, no matter what rotation you apply.
(16)We say "kind of scaling" because one may also scale the proper distances by changing just the size
of the picture. Thus pictorial space allows of two distinct types of scaling. This is different from the
Euclidean case because Euclidean angles--being periodic--cannot be scaled.

Figure 9. A protractor for the abacus model. The angles run from minus to plus infinity; the angle
measure is not periodic. This figure is the analog of a Euclidean wheel (shown at right). "Turning the
wheel" in the abacus model means translating the vertical scale rigidly along itself; this corresponds
to a rotation. Different from the Euclidean wheel, which repeats its attitude after a full turn, the
non-Euclidean wheel cannot turn around. This geometry is in many respects similar to Euclidean
geometry. However, the differences are crucial.
Patches of the visual field(17) often occur as pictorial relief in visual awareness--that is to
say, as coherent surfaces in pictorial space.(18)
Surfaces often occur in awareness as the boundaries of coherent (volumetric) regions.
For instance, a treetop is such a globular volume. Such surfaces occur as "smooth" on some
level of detail, but typically (like the treetop) will show up additional detail that appears
(17)Notice that we do not differentiate between the visual field and the picture plane in this paper. We
would be more careful in an extensive discussion.
(18)For the geometer such surfaces are technically known as "cross-sections" of the fiber bundle.

as "roughness" in the next finer resolution, and perhaps disperse in a flock of subobjects
(leaves and twigs) on an even finer level of resolution. Such boundaries are two dimensional
and therefore match the dimension of the visual field. They usually act as proxies for the
volumetric regions themselves, since many pictorial objects are opaque.(19)
Technically, a pictorial relief in terms of the abacus model is a surface that meets every
wire only once. If such a surface is not planar, then one may attempt to assign it a "shape".
The shape should be invariant with respect to proper movements--that is, transformations
with unit (that is, no) scaling but arbitrary translation and rotation.
Reliefs are typically patches of limited extent. If the reliefs are boundaries of volumetric
objects, then the relief boundary can be of two categorically different types. One is a "contour",
which is the projection of a "rim". A rim is a locus of points where the tangent planes have
infinite slope. Such tangent planes are degenerate in the abacus model; you cannot even
produce them on a physical abacus. For smoothly bounded volumetric regions the rim is a
smooth, closed, twisted space curve. (See Figure 10, where the rim is planar.)
Figure 10. The simplest example of a contour. The plane at the bottom is the picture plane; depth
runs upwards. For clarity, most of the wires of the abacus model have been omitted. Only half of the
orange surface of a globular volume is visible. The projection of the visible region in the picture plane
is bounded by the yellow curve. This is the contour. It is the projection of the red curve--the boundary
of the visible part of the surface, called the rim. The right figure is simply a rotated version of the left
figure: the rim is different; the contour is identical. In these figures the "invisible part" has been partly
omitted. It is not "optically specified", but is present in awareness, especially near the rim: it becomes
gradually more uncertain the farther it is removed from the rim. "Present in awareness" means that
the observer (prereflectively) entertains certain expectations. This can be demonstrated--in the case
of vision-in-the-world--by rotating the object in physical space, thus revealing previously hidden
parts. When expectations fail to meet, the observer will show surprise, thus revealing the presence of
the expectation.
The contour is a curve that may contain self-intersections and cusps. The contour as
projection of the rim is somewhat of an "ideal" object, in that not all parts of it are necessarily
visible (Koenderink and van Doorn 1982).
The other type of boundary is an "occlusion boundary". It happens where another object
occludes the fiducial one. In a sense the occlusion boundary does not belong to the fiducial
object, and in visual awareness the fiducial object is represented as passing behind the
occluder. These simple cases are slightly complicated through the possible existence of self-
occlusions. Occlusions proper and self-occlusions imply that the visible contour is limited
(19) Such regions may be called "amodal" in the sense that they are somehow "posed" by the microgeny,
but are not represented at all in the optical structure. One is always aware of the backsides of objects
(they are "real" in some sense). This can even be shown experimentally (van Lier and Wagemans 1999).

to only part of the projection of the rim. Visibility toggles at "T-junctions" and cusp points
(Figures 11 and 12).
Figure 11. The simplest example of a T-junction. The plane at bottom is the picture plane, depth
runs upwards. For clarity, the wires of the abacus model have been omitted. Only half of each of the
yellow-green, checkered surfaces is visible. The projections of the visible region in the picture plane
have been colored brownish and greenish. In this case one of the surfaces is partly occluded by the
other. Thus the brown region is bounded by contour alone, whereas the green region is bounded
partly by its contour, partly by the occluding contour, which is the contour of the other surface. The
single depth direction that has been drawn is tangent to both surfaces. Its projection is a so-called
"T-junction".
Figure 12. The "ending" contour. The plane at bottom is the picture plane; depth runs upwards. For
clarity, the wires of the abacus model have been omitted. Only part of the greenish, checkered surface
is visible because it "folds over itself". The rim is a piecewise smooth curve. In this case its projection
in the picture plane has a sharp "cusp". Only one branch of the cusp is visible, the other branch being
occluded by the surface itself. Thus one sees a contour that ends at the red point; the projection of the
point on the surface that marks the end of the pleat.
In the interior of a pictorial relief the depth is defined at any point; thus one has a
continuous depth field. In visual awareness this is the essence of "surfaceness"--smooth
surfaces and smooth depth fields being one and the same. This increases the number of
local, depth-related quantities that may--in principle--be addressed via psychophysical
methods. The most important ones are local depth proper, the spatial attitude of the local
tangent plane, and the local shape.
Depth 553
In the simplest case one studies the shape in the immediate neighborhood of a point--
this is conventionally known as its curvature. The simplest way to do this is to apply a
transformation that rotates the local tangent plane so as to be fronto-parallel. You may also
apply a translation, both in depth and in the picture plane, to move the point to the (arbitrarily
assigned) origin. Near the origin you study the shape of the curves of equal depth (Koenderink
and van Doorn 1998b; Figure 13). Generically, these will be either concentric ellipses or
concentric hyperbolae, corresponding to elliptic (convex or concave) and hyperbolic (saddle
shaped) surface curvature. These quadrics are known as "indicatrices of Dupin" (Koenderink
1990) and geometrically specify the local curvature.(20) The indicatrix of Dupin has the shape
of the "wound" inflicted to a region if you cut its surface with the blade held parallel to
the tangent plane at the fiducial point. For instance, cutting chips off a sphere produces all
circular wounds, illustrating the fact that the spherical surface is curved identically in all
directions (Koenderink 1990).
Figure 13. (a) At left a relief in the abacus model. At center the curves of equal depth in the picture
plane. Suppose the red point is currently of interest: at right we show the level curves of depth in the
immediate neighborhood of the point. Notice that the point is "located on a slope". (b) This continues
the situation illustrated in (a). We applied a depth motion such that the tangent plane of the fiducial
point becomes fronto-parallel. At left the rotated relief in the abacus model. At center the curves of
equal depth in the picture plane. Remember that the red point is currently of interest. At right we
show the level curves of depth in the immediate neighborhood of the point. Notice that the point is
no longer located on a slope. It has turned into an extremum of depth. The level curves have become
more or less concentric ellipses (the "indicatrix of Dupin" at the fiducial point), whose sizes and
shapes represent the local curvature at this point. Generically one obtains either ellipses (like here),
representing convexities or concavities, or hyperbolae (saddle shapes).
3 Geodesy in pictorial space
(20)To be more precise: for a given depth value the numerical curvature is inversely proportional to
the diameter of the indicatrix in the direction of curvature. The directions of principal curvature are
the axes of the indicatrix. From this one easily obtains the "shape index" (Koenderink and van Doorn
1992).

How to practice geodesy in pictorial space? This is obviously an important topic in visual
psychophysics. It is also a very elusive one because pictorial space is a mental entity. You
cannot introduce the familiar tools of the geometer--such as yardsticks, carpenter's squares,
calipers, or what have you--into this space. In fact, you cannot introduce anything physical
into pictorial space, you can introduce only pictorial objects--that are mental entities--into
pictorial space.
Fortunately, it turns out to be quite easy to put pictorial objects into pictorial space. You
simply superimpose the picture of the object over the fiducial picture. If the picture of the
object is much smaller than the fiducial picture, then the object will be sucked into the
pictorial space evoked by the latter until it hits the nearest obstacle, to which it attaches
itself. This is a matter of common observation. For instance, if you draw a black blotch on
the poster of some person, it will attach to the pictorial person. Examples include beauty
spots on cheeks, black teeth, moustaches, and so forth on the pictorial faces of politicians
and movie stars. If you are a city dweller, you will be only too familiar with this. The trick is
simply to put the blotch at roughly the suitable place in the picture plane. A little practice
will soon give you a feel for the basics. The actual structure of the mark is hardly important,
as a little exercise on a portrait of your most-hated politician will soon teach you.
Once you are able to put whatever you fancy into pictorial space, the gate is opened
widely to a variety of geodesic methods. We will discuss a few in this section, though rather
cursorily, since the main thrust of this paper is to discuss the essential differences between
such methods, especially of methods that all purport a single geometrical property--say
depth. This is--or at least it should be--a major issue in psychology because if one depth is
ontologically distinct from the next one, then the difference should not be the cause of mere
controversy but should give rise to attempts at integration and improved understanding.
Perhaps unfortunately, this is still a distant target.
3.1 Varieties of geodesy
What can be measured at all, and what might be viable methods of praxis of geodesy in
pictorial space? In this subsection we take a quick look at both issues.
3.1.1 What can be measured?. One way to arrive at a toolbox is to consider geometrical enti-
ties of various dimension, as well as their interrelations. In pictorial space one distinguishes
points, curves (lines, orbits), surfaces (planes, reliefs), and volumetric regions (solid shapes).
Points are characterized by depth; the simplest geometrically relevant entity is the special
distance. When points are close their depth difference may be of interest. Lines have slants
and curves have changing slants--that is, curvature. Slants may be changed by rotations,
whereas curvatures are invariant. The incidence of a point and a line or curve is nongeneric,
thus remarkable. Planes and reliefs have spatial attitudes that may be changed by rotations;
reliefs have invariant "curvature landscapes". The incidence of reliefs with points or curves is
nongeneric, thus remarkable. Curves generically intersect reliefs in points, and two reliefs
generically intersect in a curve. Volumes of limited size may or may not contain certain
points, and so forth. This yields a rich set of possible relations to explore. Any of these is a
potential target for research. We have been able to sample only a few instances thus far.
An important distinction is between submanifolds, which are smooth curves or surfaces,
and configurations of discrete elements, such as sets of mutually independent points or
planes. In the case of submanifolds one meets with important constraints. For instance, if
you sample local surface attitude (eg, slant and tilt) along some closed curve on the surface,
then you should arrive at the same attitude after traversing the full curve. Such "surface
integrability conditions" play an important role in the formal theories of cues such as shape
from shading. Moreover, the continuity allows such basic operations as smoothing and
interpolation, which are very important in the statistical analysis of empirical data. In the
Depth 555
case of discrete configurations you may also meet constraints, but only if you measure more
parameters than are needed to specify the configuration. The latter condition is common
enough, though. For instance, if you measure the depth relation (closer or more remote?)
for all point pairs in a point configuration, you sample many more responses than there are
depths. Geometrical constraints are very valuable in permitting a check on the consistency
of empirical data; thus they play an important, often crucial, role in the analysis.
How to measure? There are numerous possibilities, although these possibilities have
remained largely unexplored.
Methods may be distinguished in a variety of ways. One is whether the method addresses
local or multilocal properties. Notice that "local" may involve more structured entities than
mere location; think of the spatial attitude of tangent planes or curvature, for instance.
Another, important, distinction is whether the "probes" applied to the picture merely indicate
spatial presence or mimic some geometrical structure, allowing a nontrivial notion of "fit".
In this section we offer some examples of the various possibilities, though by no means
exhaustively so.
One of the simplest methods is based on the pairwise comparison of entities. For instance,
given two points, one may ask which one is closer (van Doorn et al 2011). This technique
may be almost arbitrarily articulated. For instance, one may ask whether a given point lies
in front or behind the plane implied by a triple of other points, and so forth. The simple
comparison judgment is subject to enormous variation. It includes (important) judgments
of incidence. Any of these methods depends on only the identification of points. They can be
implemented by putting simple marks (say colored dots) on the picture plane. These dots
simply serve to indicate a location--there is no notion of "fit".
Another generic method is that of fitting a "gauge figure". The idea is simply that in order
to measure something (anything!), you compare it with a standard. For instance, you measure
the length of a body by putting a yardstick next to it, you measure the weight by comparing
it with a standard weight using scales, you grade grains by means of sieves, and so forth. In
all such cases the observer merely has to judge the fit of a pictorial entity with respect to
some "gauge object".(21) For such methods you need to overlay a picture of the gauge object
over the fiducial picture. In many cases you will need to grant the observer control over the
picture of the gauge figure. A simple example involves an elliptical gauge figure to measure
the spatial attitude of a planar patch of relief (or the tangent plane at a point of a pictorial
relief; Koenderink et al 1995). Here the task is to judge whether the gauge figure appears as a
"circle painted on the pictorial surface in pictorial space" (Figure 14). This samples surface
attitude, usually parameterized by the slant and tilt angles. Notice that this parameterization
is fully irrelevant in the actual perceptual judgment. The observer need not even be familiar
with these parameters. A fit is a fit when it looks like one, and that is all there is to it. When
a fit is established, the result of the measurement is taken to be the current gauge in some
parameterization. This is simply an operational definition. This is how the ancients measured
the weights of things, although they were sorely lacking a reasonable theory of gravitation or
mass. It is not essentially different in psychophysics.
This general technique of judging the fit of some gauge object is capable of almost
boundless variation and can be used to measure a large variety of geometrical properties.
(21)The method of fit is familiar to physicists: It has been the major method of quantification in
classical physics. It is often misunderstood in cognitive science, though. One speculates that the
observer judges both the object to be measured and the gauge figure separately, and subsequently
judges whether these two partial judgments agree. The idea ultimately derives from the (mistaken)
notion that everything mental has to be cognitive. This again leads to attempts to calibrate the gauge
figure by some independent method. From the perspective of the physicist this is nonsensical.
556 J J Koenderink, A J van Doorn, J Wagemans
Figure 14. Portrait of an angel by Albrecht Dürer (completed 1506) with superimposed gauge figure.
This particular gauge figure is made up of the picture (in orthographic projection) of a circle with an
"axle" sticking out at right angles from the plane of the circle. The axle has the same length as the radius
of the circle. The task is to make the picture of the circle, which is elliptical due to foreshortening,
look like a circle "painted" on the surface, in this case the angel's cheek. If the observer is satisfied, the
spatial attitude of the gauge figure is taken as a sample of the tangent plane of the relief (the cheek)
located at the center of the gauge figure.
Yet another method involves multilocal properties (notice that the gauge figure methods
are essentially local). One introduces objects at two or more distinct locations and lets the
observer judge (or adjust) a multilocal fit. A simple example involves pointing from one point
to another, obviously an important operation in practical geodesy. In this case one overlays a
picture of a pointer on one location and a picture of a target on the other (Figure 15). The
observer then adjusts the picture of the pointer so as to "point from one point to the other"
in pictorial space (Wagemans et al 2011). That this should be possible is evident from the
fact that one easily follows visual directions of pictorial persons. For instance, in paintings by
Peter Paul Rubens the pattern of "who looks at whom" in sizable groups of persons tends
to be very well established. It was an important part of the mature baroque style (Andersen
1969).
Another example of a multilocal method deploys "depth cues" such as relative size or
atmospherical perspective. One simply superimposes a circular blob (say) over each location
and lets the observer adjust either relative size or relative color such that the blobs (they tend
to look like "spheres") look "the same" in pictorial space (Figure 16; van Doorn et al 2011).
These methods are also capable of considerable variation and development.

with superimposed target and pointer. (In an actual application these superimposed objects will be
smaller.) The observer controls the spatial attitude of the pointer and is supposed to make it "look as if
it points at the target in pictorial space". When the observer is satisfied, the attitude of the pointer is
taken as the direction in pictorial space from the location of the pointer to that of the target.
4 Some empirical results
4.1 Relation between various differential depth orders
In the case of depth reliefs one has a variety of possible geometrical entities at one's disposal
that might be sampled empirically. For instance, consider
· sampling the depth order for pairs of points on the surface;
· sampling the spatial attitude of the local tangent planes;
· sampling the local curvatures.
In these cases one measures different properties of the same surface;(22) thus the resulting
data are expected to stand in certain relations to each other. Of course, the empirical relations
are likely to be predictable from the formal, geometrical relations.
If the depth of all surface points is known (a "depth field") up to a common offset, then
the surface attitude can be calculated through spatial differentiation. Conversely, if the
spatial attitude is known throughout (a "surface attitude field"), then the depth field can be
calculated by integration. There is a possible hitch, though. An arbitrary field of attitudes
need not be integrable (need not be a "gradient field"). This is up to empirical verification. If
integrability fails, then no consistent pictorial relief can be said to exist.(23)
Similar considerations apply to the relations between depths, attitudes, and curvatures.
It is a priori unclear in what way--if any--surfaces are represented in visual awareness.
This issue can be addressed empirically. For instance, if the depth field can be predicted from
the attitude field, but not vice versa, then this is an indication that not depths per se, but
rather attitudes are represented.
(22)Formally, this involves the various orders of differential description. Depth is the zeroth order,
attitude the first order, curvature the second order, and so forth.
(23)Notice that this would count as a valuable empirical result.

Figure 16. A capriccio (imaginary landscape) by Francesco Guardi (1712­93) with two yellow blobs
superimposed on it (copy by Anne-Sophie Bonno; see http://www.atelier-bonno.fr/galerie-copies-
arts-graphiques.html). Notice that they tend to look like spheres in pictorial space. The task is to adjust
their relative size so as to make them "look the same size in pictorial space". If the observer is satisfied,
we take the logarithm of the size ratio as a measure of the depth difference between the locations
identified by the blobs.
In one study we found that attitudes are represented more precisely than depths and
that the attitude field is a gradient field (Koenderink et al 1992, 1996). We are still uncertain
whether curvatures might take priority over attitudes, which remains certainly a possibility.
If one samples depth priority for nearby locations, one finds results that can be predicted
from attitude samples. When the points are located far from each other, one might expect
their depth priority to be predictable via integration of the attitude field. We find empirically
that such is not the case, though. It works in case the points are located on a single slope, but
it fails if there runs a depth ridge, or rut, inbetween them (Koenderink and van Doorn 1995).
We conclude that observers have no immediate access to the integrated attitude field at all.
Notice that this would be the global depth field. This is the case even though the depth field
was obtained from the observer's own responses, which is perhaps surprising. Such findings
rather immediately address the geometrical structure of visual awareness.
Relations such as these are very intricate, and science is still far removed from a
comprehensive understanding of them. Even so, such an understanding must be considered
to be of paramount importance to our understanding of pictorial vision.
4.2 Comparison of operationally defined depths
The simplest depth scale is ordinal. One distributes a number of points over the pictorial
scene and collects pairwise depth ranking judgments. For a reasonable number of points
(roughly fewer than 50) one may let the observer judge all (orderless) pairs within an hour or
so.(24) For coherent pictures (we tried a classical landscape) one finds that the final ranking
is coherent,(25) and stable over sessions (van Doorn et al 2011). The resulting rank order
typically (over a number of observers) has about 40 distinctly different levels. Thus observers
notice quite an articulate depth structure in such a landscape picture.
(24)The time limit is important because observers tend to apply different transformations (rotations
and scalings) from day to day.
(25)This is not trivial since 50 points implies that 1,225 (50×[50-1]/2) judgments are "explained" by a
mere 49 (50-1) degrees of freedom.
Depth 559
In a method of relative size comparison the observer has a more complicated task.
One again tests on pairs of locations, each trial involving the adjustment of relative size
of probes. We find that a session may comprise about 20 locations, implying 190 adjustments
(van Doorn et al 2011). Again, we find a consistent structure,(26) both within and over sessions.
Finally, in a pointing task the observer has the even more complicated task, involving two
degrees of freedom, of pointing a pointer to a target. In this case one can use only fewer than
10 locations (we used 5, involving 20 trials). In all cases one points once either way, because
it turns out to be the case that the observer "points by arcs" rather than straight lines. The
result is again consistent within (27) and over sessions (Wagemans et al 2011).
The latter two methods yield numerical scales, the former one only an ordinal scale. We
find that the rank correlation between all methods is very high, and the same is found for the
Pearson correlation coefficient between the numerical scales; this is the case for all observers.
We do find high correlations between observers--apparently they all use more or less the
same cues--but very significant differences between the depth ranges obtained with the
latter two methods (van Doorn et al 2011). On first blush this appears surprising, given the
fact that all observers appear to resolve a similar number of distinct depth levels.
Consider the relative size method. What we did was to take the natural logarithm of
the size ratio adjusted by the observer as a measure of the depth difference between the
two fiducial locations. The rationale for this choice is simple enough. When you scale
both probes by the same factor, the depth difference of the corresponding locations is
not supposed to change. Hence the depth difference may depend upon only the ratio of
the sizes. Moreover, the depth differences should combine additively, whereas size ratios
combine multiplicatively. Hence one should consider the logarithm of the ratio. The base of
the logarithm is arbitrary, and thus one obtains the depth up to some unknown factor (the
same for all observers), and an arbitrary offset. The latter is irrelevant--we arbitrarily set the
average of the depths obtained over the session to zero.
Notice that the depth scale obtained in this way is unrelated to the dimensions as
measured in the picture plane. This is fine, because the proper depth motions of pictorial
space conserve the visual directions; thus there is no principled way to compare the
magnitude of distance in the picture plane and depth. What one may do is find the slant
of the line that connects the points in pictorial space. It is the depth difference divided by
the distance of the points in the picture plane. This slant is subject to the relief ambiguity
described by Adolf Hildebrand. All slants are ambiguous because they may be arbitrarily
scaled with a common factor. The total depth range is subject to the same ambiguity. Since
the common factor must be assumed to be essentially idiosyncratic, this is not necessarily at
odds with the fact that all observers resolve similar numbers of depth levels.
The relative size cue has nothing to do with any "ratio of ranges"--after all, the eye is
not even in pictorial space. The observer somehow uses the size cue "smaller is farther
away", even in the absence of a clear "distance from the eye". It seems a priori likely that this
will be highly dependent upon the particular style of the picture. For instance, in Persian
miniatures--where the size­range relation is apparently ignored, and the major depth cues
are height in the picture plane and overlap--things might well be expected to work out quite
differently. There lies a vast field of enquiry open here.
Next consider the pointing method. It differs essentially from the relative size method in
the respect that the measure of distance of the points in the picture plane does matter. In
(26)This is not trivial because one attempts to account for the 190 (20×[20-1]/2) adjustments in terms
of a mere 19 (20-1) degrees of freedom.
(27)This is not trivial. One accounts for twenty (5×[5-1]) settings in terms of four (5-1) degrees of
freedom.
560 J J Koenderink, A J van Doorn, J Wagemans
this case one measures the depth difference between two locations in terms of their mutual
distance in the picture plane. If one abstracts from the fact that the two-way pointings yield
slightly different results, (28) then the depth difference is simply the distance in the picture
plane times the slant adjusted by the observer. (29) This slant is defined as the tangent of the
Euclidean slant angle used in the computer graphics generation of the picture of the pointer.
Notice that this is intuitively reasonable in view of the definition of the non-Euclidean slant
in pictorial space. Whereas the Euclidean slant angle is in the range of minus to plus ninety
degrees (positive meaning away from the observer), its non-Euclidean analog ranges from
minus to plus infinity. The tangent is just a number, whereas one measures distances in
the picture plane in pixels, visual angle, or centimeters--they have units. Then the depth
difference will also be expressed in pixels, visual angle, or centimeters.
Does this mean anything?
Yes and no. In one possible view the result is again subject to Adolf Hildebrand's relief
scalings. Thus one draws similar conclusions as in the case of the relative size probe. The
results of both methods may be normalized by dividing by the total range or depth standard
deviation before comparison. When one does so, the results are almost indistinguishable.
However, another view is possible in which one puts more value on the habitus of the
pointer as a function of its slant.
The picture of the pointer is constructed via standard computer graphics. It is the
orthographic projection of a three-dimensional arrow. The shaft and head of the arrow
have been dimensioned in such a way that small variations in slant are readily apparent in
any spatial attitude of the pointer. When looking at the arrow in various attitudes, one can
roughly estimate its slant angle in degrees. In doing this one of course has to assign a depth
scale. It seems likely that one does this on the basis of the implicit assumption (which is
correct) that the arrow is a rotational symmetric body in Euclidean three-dimensional space,
seen in orthographic projection. When the image of the pointer is superimposed over the
fiducial image, the arrow is perceived as a pictorial object in the pictorial space of the fiducial
picture (a classical landscape). One may still look at the pointer and readily estimate its slant
angle in degrees.
Does this imply that observers setting different slant angles experience different depth
differences? It seems to us that one may take this as an operational definition that this is the
case. Accepting this implies that the experienced depth range is independent of the depth
resolution. One might say, then, that the pictorial depth calibration is a form of mental paint.
5 Depth and range
In this paper we have developed the topic of geodesy in pictorial space without any reference
to the structure of physical space. We believe this to be the proper procedure, because a
picture (in terms of its structural complexity) in no way depends upon any physical space.
Here Maurice Denis's (1890) manifesto (my translation), is very appropriate:
Remember that a painting--before being a battle horse, a nude woman, or
some anecdote--is essentially a planar surface covered with colors in a certain
arrangement.
This is trivially obvious in the case of Mondrian's later paintings, but to many people it
is rather less obvious in the case of "realistic paintings" or even photographs. Visual artists
understand Denis's statement very well, though, especially painters. The painter's craft is to
(28)It can be shown that this problem is easily resolved by using the average slope of the two empirically
determined slants.
(29)The tilts are simply discarded in this calculation as they involve only the picture plane per se.
Depth 561
apply pigments on a planar carrier in such a way as to trick their potential customers to build
certain constrained hallucinations in their visual awareness. The planar arrangement is in
no way superseded by these, though.
The "composition" has an important effect. That is explicit to the artist although it remains
largely implicit to the naive observer. One might say that the observer is being brainwashed
by the artist. We mean this quite literally.(30) This is--in principle--not different from what
happens in musical composition.
In the context of vision-in-the-world the relation between the space in awareness, and
the physical space that contains the observer is of importance, of course. It then makes sense
to look for possible correlations between properties of depth and those of range.
For the restricted setting of the static, monocular observer--only eye movements, no
motion in the environment--the case is not that different from that of pictorial vision, the
main difference being that "ground truth" is overwhelmingly present.
For this restricted case one may deduce the possible structure of visual space from first
principles (Koenderink and van Doorn 2008). One predicts that depth is correlated with
the logarithm of range and that the structure of visual space must admit a certain group of
similarities that is essentially the same as we deduced above on phenomenological grounds.
The exploration of the empirical structure of this visual space is far from completed yet. This
poses a rich field of endeavor in its own right.
6 Conclusions
Pictorial vision is a niche area of vision research that remains relatively unexplored, either
theoretically or empirically. This is the case despite the fact that this apparently limited setting
occurs very frequently in our current society. Just think of the evacuation plans the airlines
are legally forced to bring to your attention at the beginning of their flights. A considerable
part of communication and teaching still depends heavily on material presented as still
pictures. Moreover, much of our historical documents come as either texts or still pictures.
There is no way technology might change this, for in the medieval authors simply had neither
stereoscopes nor video. Thus a thorough understanding of pictorial vision, its dependence
on the pictorial material, and the differences between members of the general population
(perhaps graded with respect to age and gender) should be of considerable interest.
Unfortunately, the understanding of pictorial vision is typically regarded as a rather
immediate derivative of the--immensely more important--understanding of vision-in-
the-world. This is a consequence of the understanding of pictures as being essentially
windows on some physical space. Such a view introduces the observer into the picture,
thus converting the viewing of a picture as a limited instance of vision-in-the-world. For
instance, the experiential quality depth is interpreted as the physical range. That is to say,
one understands "veridical vision" as implying an intimate correlation between depth and
range. In our view this is nonsensical, because of the ontological chasm between these
concepts. Moreover, the normative emphasis is anthropocentric and clashes with a biological
(thus evolutionary) account. However that may be, the fact remains that pictorial vision is a
worthwhile field of scientific endeavor in its own right.
(30)We know this may sound odd, but artists understand it very well. As one of many examples
remember the famous dictions by Edgar Degas:
A picture is something which requires as much knavery, trickery, and deceit as the
perpetration of a crime. Make it untrue and add an accent of truth ... Even working
from nature you have to compose ... Drawing is not what you see but what you must
make others see.
562 J J Koenderink, A J van Doorn, J Wagemans
We have shown how a formal theory of depth can be developed through pure phenomeno-
logical deduction. We have also indicated how one may design and implement methods of
geodesy that can be applied in the empirical investigation of structures in pictorial space.
Such methods have hardly been explored in any detail thus far. There is ample room for
further development.
Perhaps not unexpectedly, it is fair to say that a great many open problems remain,
especially of a conceptual nature. Pictorial vision is quite different from vision-in-the-world
because the conventional perception­action cycle does not apply to it. Thus the definition of
vision as "optically guided behavior", which is quite acceptable to much of the mainstream,
fails to apply too. It has to be changed into "optically constrained awareness", which lifts it
on a different ontological level. The study of pictorial vision has to rely on phenomenological
methods, rather than physiological or "hard-core" psychological ones.(31)

Jan Koenderink (1943) studied physics, mathematics, and astronomy at Utrecht University,
where he graduated in 1972. From the late 1970s he held a chair "The Physics of Man"
at Utrecht University until his retirement in 2008. He is presently Research Fellow at
Delft University of Technology and guest professor at the University of Leuven. He is
a member of the Dutch Royal Society of Arts and Sciences and received a honorific
doctorate in medicine from Leuven University. Current interests include the mathematics
and psychophysics of space and form in vision, including applications in art and design.
Andrea van Doorn (1948) studied physics, mathematics, and chemistry at Utrecht
University, where she did her masters in 1971. She did her PhD (at Utrecht) in 1984.
She is presently at Delft University of Technology in the department of Industrial Design.
Current research interests are various topics in vision, communication by gestures, and
soundscapes.
Johan Wagemans (1963) has a BA in psychology and philosophy and an MA and a PhD
in experimental psychology, all from the University of Leuven, where he is currently a full
professor. Current research interests are mainly in so-called midlevel vision (perceptual
grouping, figure­ground organization, depth, and shape perception) but stretch out
to low-level vision (contrast detection and discrimination) and high-level vision (object
recognition and categorization), including applications in autism, arts, and sports (see
http://www.gestaltrevision.be).
