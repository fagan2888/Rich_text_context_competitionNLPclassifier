Introduction
Immunoglobulin A nephropathy (IgAN) is the most
common primary glomerulonephritis around the world,
especially in the Asia-Pacific area. It accounts for 36.3%
of the primary glomerulopathies in China. In children,
there is almost 17.2% of IgAN found in primary glo-
merulopathies with renal biopsy.1 The progress of IgAN
is repeated and persistent, and the prognosis is often not
good. A study shows that approximately 30% of children
with IgAN have progressed to end stage renal disease
(ESRD) through 20 years follow-up.2 The common
changes of pathological morphology in renal tissues of
ESRD mainly present as glomerular sclerosis and renal
interstitial fibrosis.
It has been confirmed that angiotensin II (Ang II)
plays a key role in the progress of kidney fibrosis in

Abstract
Aim: The purpose of this study was to explore whether mTOR/p70S6K1 signaling is activated in renal fibrosis of
immunoglobulin A nephropathy.
Methods: Seventy-two children with immunoglobulin A nephropathy were divided into three groups according to their
clinical features and pathological grades. Six normal renal specimens were included in the control group. The expression
levels of angiotensin II, mTOR, p70S6K1, E-cadherin, and -smooth muscle actin in renal tissues were determined by
immunohistochemistry method, the potential correlations of these indexes and relationship between these indexes and
the clinicopathological indexes were analyzed.
Results: Compared to the control group, the expression levels of angiotensin II, mTOR, p70S6K1, and -smooth
muscle actin were significantly higher and the expression levels of E-cadherin were lower both in glomeruli and
tubulointerstitium of immunoglobulin A nephropathy children. And the most significant differences were found in
the nephrotic syndrome group and pathological grade IV group. In immunoglobulin A nephropathy renal tissues,
the expression levels of angiotensin II in glomeruli and tubulointerstitium were both positively correlated with the
expression levels of mTOR and - smooth muscle actin, and negatively correlated with the expression levels of
E-cadherin.
Conclusion: The mTOR/p70S6K1 signaling was activated in renal tissues of children with immunoglobulin A nephropathy,
and future studies will need to address the mechanism of mTOR/p70S6K1 signaling in the progress of renal fibrosis in
immunoglobulin A nephropathy.

IgAN, which may be related to the activation of renin-
angiotensin system (RAS) by abnormal glycosylation of
immunoglobulin A1 (IgA1) deposited in kidney, and ini-
tiation of a sequence of inflammation reaction and
injury.3­5 Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is one
of the atypical Ser/Thr protein kinases, which widely
exist in many kinds of biological cells. It can control
cell growth and proliferation by participating in the pro-
cess of transcription, ribosome synthesis, translation,
autophagy, and the structure of actin skeleton.6,7 It has
shown in recent studies that the mTOR/p70S6K1 signal-
ing pathway is widely involved in the renal fibrosis
process in polycystic kidney disease, membranous
nephropathy, unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) renal
fibrosis, acute kidney injury, and diabetic nephropathy,8­15
but whether this signaling pathway has an important
part in the renal fibrosis of IgAN is still unclear.
This study investigates the expression levels of Ang,
mTOR, p70S6K1, E-cadherin, and -smooth muscle actin
(-SMA) in the renal tissues of children with IgAN, ana-
lyzes the potential correlations of these indexes as well as
relationship between these indexes and the clinical pathol-
ogy indexes, and try to explore whether the mTOR/
p70S6K1 signaling pathway is activated in the progress of
renal fibrosis of children with IgAN.
Materials and methods
Clinical data
From April 2007­April 2011, 78 children with primary
IgAN were diagnosed in the Pediatric Nephrology Center
of the Department of Pediatrics in the First Affiliated
Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, China. One child who
coexisted with Crohn's disease and five children who had
received angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI)
and angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) treatments were
excluded. Finally, 72 children were included in the study.
Fifty-six were boys and 16 were girls, male: female ratio
was 3.5:1. The median children age was 10.2, 3.0­14.0
years. The course of illness in the study, defined from the
first time diagnosed with primary IgAN by renal biopsy,
was from four days to nine years, and the median course of
illness was 78 days. Six normal renal specimens were
included in the control group, five of them were the kidney
tissues adjacent to neoplastic lesions and the one sample
was from a health donor who was not successfully matched
before kidney transplant. There were four boys and two
girls in the control group, and the median age was 7.8
years (from 4.2­13.8 years). This study was approved by
the ethics committee of the First Affiliated Hospital of Sun
Yat-sen University, and was performed in accordance with
the ethical standards outlined in the 1964 Declaration of
Helsinki. All of the children's guardians had signed the
consent form before the research.
Inclusion and exclusion criteria
1. Children having renal biopsy for the first time were
included.
2. Children under 14 years old were included.
3. The renal samples of children had to correspond to
the diagnosis standard of primary IgAN, the immu-
noglobulin, mainly IgA, deposited in the glomeru-
larmesangial area and/or capillary loops.
4. Children with secondary IgAN, such as Henoch-
Schönleinpurpura (HSP), systemic lupus erythe-
matosus (SLE), and chronic liver diseases were
excluded.
5. Children who had received glucocorticoids, immu-
nosuppressants, ACEI and ARB treatments were
excluded.
Cases groups
According to the standard developed by the Subspecialty
Group of Nephrology, the Society of Pediatrics, Chinese
Medical Association in 2001, 72 children with IgAN were
divided into three groups based on the clinical features, 24
cases in the isolated hematuria (IH) group, 26 cases in the
hematuria and proteinuria (HP) group and 22 cases in the
nephrotic syndrome (NS) group.16,17 IH means the isolated
microscopic hematuria and the isolated gross hematuria.
HP is characterized by proteinuria and microscopic hema-
turia or gross hematuria, and 24 h urinary protein (Upro)
less than 50 mg/kg. NS is defined as proteinuria, hypoal-
buminemia with or without hypercholesterolemia and
edema.
Based on the World Health Organization (WHO) patho-
logical classification standard in 1982,18 children with
IgAN were divided into three groups, 33 cases in the
pathology II group, 25 cases in the pathology III group and
14 cases in the pathology IV group.
Research methods
The clinical baseline data of all included children in the
study were collected, such as age, gender, course of illness,
height, weight, and mean arterial pressure (MAP).
Fasting peripheral venous bloods (2 ml) were collected
with separation gel tubes, after 30 min at room tempera-
ture environment, isolated serums were centrifuged under
10 min with 3500 r/min. Serum blood urea nitrogen (BUN)
and serum creatinine (Scr) levels were detected by a 7170A
automatic biochemical analyzer. Serum IgA level was
tested by immunoturbidimetry.
Urine specimens (24 h) were collected from all IgAN
children on the day before renal biopsy and the exact urine
volumes were recorded with graduated cylinders. Fifteen
ml of mixed urine samples were used for testing 24 h uri-
nary protein by the sulfosalicylic acid method.
Xu et al. 3
The renal tissues of children with IgAN were scored
according to the Katafuchi semi-quantitative criteria.19
The IgA deposition intensity in glomeruli and tubulointer-
stitium was measured by direct immunofluorescence
assay. The expression levels of Ang II, mTOR, p70S6K1,
E-cadherin, and -SMA in renal tissues were measured by
immunohistochemistry method (two-step PowerVision).
Kidney tissues were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and
embedded in paraffin. Consecutive sections of 4 m were
deparaffinized in xylene, antigen retrieval was performed
with 1 mM EDTA, then incubated with the following anti-
bodies. Primary antibodies included rabbit anti-human
Angantibody (Phoenix, USA), rabbit anti-human mTOR
antibody (Cell Signal Technology, USA), rabbit anti-
human p70S6K1 antibody (Millipor, USA), rabbit anti-
human E-cadherin antibody and rabbit anti-human-SMA
antibody (ABcam, UK). Secondary antibodies were
mouse/rabbit two-step detection kit PV-7000 (Beijing
Zhong Shan Jinqiao Biological Technology Co. Ltd,
China). Sections were analyzed with the ZEISS Axio
Imager Z1 microscope and the Image-Pro Plus 6.0 soft-
ware (Media Cybernetics). The percentages of Ang II,
mTOR, p70S6K1, E-cadherin, and -SMA in the glomer-
uli and tubulointerstitium were calculated by dividing the
positive staining area by the total area of the glomeruli and
tubulointerstitium respectively.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS (version
20.0). Data are shown as mean±standard deviation (SD),
with statistical analyses performed using one-way analysis
of variance. Pearson correlation analysis was used for cor-
relation analysis between two groups. A value of p<0.05
was considered statistically significant.

Discussion
The mTOR/p70S6K1 signaling pathway is
activated in IgAN
Previous studies have shown that many important signal-
ing pathways in the process of kidney injury are usually
found in the process of kidney development, such as the
mTOR/p70S6K1 signaling pathway.9,20 In our study the
expression of Ang II, mTOR, p70S6K1, and -SMA was
also found in the control group, which may mainly be
involved in the control of kidney development. But com-
pared to the control group, the expression levels of these
indexes were markedly higher and the expression levels of
E-cadherin were obvious lower in the children with IgAN,
which may be related to the kidney injury and suggest that
the mTOR/p70S6K1 signaling pathway is activated in the
children with IgAN.
The mTOR signaling plays diverse roles in different types
of renal cells. The mTOR inhibitor can reduce cyst growth in
polycystic kidney disease by significantly decreasing the
proliferation and apoptosis of renal tubular epithelial
cells.21,22 In endotoxemia-induced chronic kidney injury and
subsequent fibrosis in the male C57BL/6 mice model, the
mTOR signaling of kidney macrophages was activated, and
rapamycin can markedly ameliorate kidney pathological
changes.23 It was reported that a low dose of the mTOR
inhibitor rapamycin can inhibit mesangial cell proliferation
and slow the progression of renal fibrosis of IgAN by modu-
lating the cell cycle regulatory proteins and blocking the
G1-to-S transition.24 Tamouza et al. found that the MAPK/
ERK pathway was activated in mesangial areas of IgAN
patients with proteinuria (>1 g/day) and elevated blood pres-
sure, which could alter the cross-talk between mesangial
cells and podocytes and thus generate renal dysfunction in
IgAN. What is more, as IgA1-dependent MAPK/ERK acti-
vation requires RAS activity, using RAS blocker therapy can
more effectively mitigate proteinuria in IgAN patients with a
high mesangial score for MAPK/ERK activation.25

Our study showed that the highest expression levels of
mTOR, p70S6K1, and -SMA were found in the NS
group, and the expression levels of Ang II, mTOR,
p70S6K1, and -SMA were significantly higher in the
renal pathological groups III and IV than that in group II,
while the lowest expression levels of E-cadherin were
found in group IV. It is suggested that the expression levels
of Ang II, mTOR, p70S6K1, -SMA, and E-cadherin were
closely related to the clinical classifications and renal path-
ological grades, the more serious of the clinical features
and pathological changes, the more distinct of the activa-
tion of the mTOR/p70S6K1 signaling pathway and renal
fibrosis.
The activation of mTOR/p70S6K1 signaling
pathway may be related to the renal fibrosis in
IgAN induced by Ang II
Many studies have shown that Ang II can induce renal
fibrosis through different transcellular pathways.26­29
Whaley-Connell et al.30 found that Ang II could be
involved in the process of renal fibrosis through the
mTOR/p70S6K1 signaling pathway in the rat models of
hypertensive nephropathy.30 The possible mechanism is
that the environment of inflammation induced by Ang II
can make mTOR out of control in the kidney, and the acti-
vation of mTOR signaling pathway and the decrease of
cadherin can jointly promote the process of epithelial-mes-
enchymal transition (EMT) in renal proximal tubules. The
overproduction and excessive accumulation of the extra-
cellular matrix (ECM) induced by EMT can expedite the
progress of renal fibrosis. And the significant symbols of
EMT are the low expression level of E-cadherin and the
high expression level of -SMA.31
In our study the correlations between the expression lev-
els of Ang II, mTOR, p70S6K1, E-cadherin, and -SMA in
renal tissues of IgAN further suggested that the renal fibro-
sis induced by Ang II may relate to the mTOR signaling
pathway. The possible reason is that the expression level of
Ang II increases in the kidney tissue of IgAN, which can
activate the mTOR/p70S6K1 signaling pathway, and pro-
mote the process of glomerular sclerosis and renal intersti-
tial fibrosis. Thus, it may become a significant target to
block the renal fibrosis in IgAN induced by Ang II through
the control of mTOR/p70S6K1 signaling pathway.
The results show that, using the Katafuchi scoring, the
glomerular lesion scores were positively correlated with
the expression levels of Ang II, mTOR, and p70S6K1, and
negatively correlated with the expression levels of
E-cadherin in glomeruli. The renal tubulointerstitial lesion
scores were positively correlated with the expression lev-
els of Ang II, mTOR, p70S6K1, and -SMA, and nega-
tively correlated with the expression levels of E-cadherin
in tubulointerstitium. They further suggest that Ang II and
the mTOR/p70S6K1 signaling pathway might play an
important role in glomerular sclerosis, renal tubular injury
and renal interstitial fibrosis.
It was shown in this study that there was no significant
correlation between the expression levels of Ang II,
mTOR, p70S6K1, E-cadherin, -SMA, and the intensity
of IgA deposition in IgAN. The findings indirectly support
the view that once the abnormal glycosylated IgA1 depos-
ited in kidney and initiated the subsequent pathophysio-
logical process, the result seemed have little relationship to
the original cause, and also suggest that the injury process
in the later stage of inflammation played a critical role in
the development of renal fibrosis.32­35
It is thought that proteinuria is one of the independent
risk factors of IgAN.36,37 Our study showed that the 24 h
urinary protein quantitation were positively correlated
with expression levels of Ang II, mTOR, and -SMA, and
negatively correlated with the expression levels of
E-cadherin in glomeruli and tubulointerstitium. It is sug-
gested that the activation of the mTOR/p70S6K1 signal-
ing pathway in IgAN might relate to the level of
proteinuria, and the specific mechanism is worthy of
being further studied.
Conclusion
The expression levels of Ang II, mTOR, p70S6K1, and -
SMA in renal tissues of children with IgAN are signifi-
cantly higher and the expression levels of E-cadherin are
significantly lower, which is closely related to the clinical
classifications, renal pathological grades and lesion scores.
It implies that the activation of mTOR/p70S6K1 signaling
pathway may play an important role in the progress of glo-
merular sclerosis, renal tubular injury, and renal interstitial
fibrosis in children with IgAN, and future studies will need
to address the mechanism of mTOR/p70S6K1 signaling in
the progress of renal fibrosis in IgAN.
