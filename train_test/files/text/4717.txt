Repetition Is the Feature Behind the
Attentional Bias for Recognizing
Threatening Patterns

Abstract
Animals attend to what is relevant in order to behave in an effective manner and succeed in their environments. In several
nonhuman species, there is an evolved bias for attending to patterns indicative of threats in the natural environment such as
dangerous animals. Because skins of many dangerous animals are typically repetitive, we propose that repetition is the key feature
enabling recognition of evolutionarily important threats. The current study consists of two experiments where we measured
participants' reactions to pictures of male and female models wearing clothing of various repeating (leopard skin, snakeskin, and
floral print) and nonrepeating (camouflage, shiny, and plain) patterns. In Experiment 1, when models wearing patterns were
presented side by side with total fixation duration as the measure, the repeating floral pattern was the most provocative, with
total fixation duration significantly longer than all other patterns. Leopard and snakeskin patterns had total fixation durations that
were significantly longer than the plain pattern. In Experiment 2, we employed a visual-search task where participants were
required to find models wearing the various patterns in a setting of a crowded airport terminal. Participants detected leopard skin
pattern and repetitive floral pattern significantly faster than two of the nonpatterned clothing styles. Our experimental findings
support the hypothesis that repetition of specific visual features might facilitate target detection, especially those characterizing
evolutionary important threats. Our findings that intricate, but nonthreatening repeating patterns can have similar attention-
grabbing properties to animal skin patterns have important implications for the fashion industry and wildlife trade.

Attention is defined as the ability to prioritize ecological and
biological items, such as objects in the environment or stored
memories, by relevance and importance (Corbetta, Miezin,
Dobmeyer, Shulman, & Petersen, 1990). In the visual system,
even with a large field of vision, organisms focus attention on
relatively small areas of the scene, which are analyzed in detail
(Frintrop, 2006), providing for higher level processing such as
object recognition. Visual attention is a high-demand process,
being pulled in every direction from the diverse input afforded
by our complex world. Due to the amount of complex percei-
vable sensory data in the environment, organisms are ecologi-
cally adapted to attend to what is relevant in order to behave in
an effective manner and succeed in their environments
(Frintrop, 2006; Wolfe & Horowitz, 2004).
A review by Carrasco (2011) defined visual attention to
consist of three main types: spatial attention, object-based
attention, and feature-based attention (FBA). Spatial attention
refers to selectively processing one location over another and
object-based attention is guided by recognizing the structure of
the object. In human and nonhuman primates, FBA refers to the
process of recognizing specific aspects of objects such as color,
pattern, orientation, or direction of motion (Carrasco, 2011).
Among these three types of attention, one would expect FBA to
be most shaped by natural selection, because while locations

and object structures can vary infinitely, there are often com-
monalities among objects in terms of features.
FBA can be selected for by natural selection to result in an
attentional bias, which facilitate detection of threats, resources,
mates, or other items that impact reproductive fitness. Atten-
tional biases are present for recognizing various features of
objects, which imbue them with higher salience, making them
stand out relative to their surroundings. Pattern orientation is
one such feature. For example, many primates capitalize on
face and eye orientation of their conspecifics to focus their
attention on objects of importance (Emery, 2000). Despite their
poor visual acuity, African elephants have also been shown to
pick up on body orientation and differentially signal to request
food when the experimenter was facing the elephant as opposed
to away from it (Smet & Byrne, 2014).
Another feature for which there is an attentional bias is direc-
tion of movement. Animals across taxa such as flies (Jablonski
& Strausfeld, 2000), crabs (Oliva, Medan, & Tomsic, 2007),
frogs (Yamamoto, Nakata, & Nakagawa, 2003), chickens
(Evans, Macedonia, & Marler, 1993), monkeys (Schiff, Cavi-
ness, & Gibson, 1962), and humans (Vagnoni, Lourenco, &
Longo, 2012) have been shown to recognize and respond to
looming stimuli, where the stimuli are approaching them.
Similarly, there is an attentional bias for responding to
patterns that are indicative of threats and this bias has been
observed across animal taxa as well. Young African jewelfish
instinctively dart away when confronted with horizontal pat-
terns of two facing eyes (Coss, 1979). Lab-born California
ground squirrel pups that have never been exposed to the wild
are attentive when presented a snake-like pattern (Coss,
1991). Congruently in primates, the repetitive scales of snakes
appear especially salient (Etting & Isbell, 2014; Kawai & He,
2016), bonnet macaques in Southern India exhibited greater
alarm calling, greater frequency of flight, and a faster flight
time in response to a spotted leopard model compared to a
dark leopard model without a spotted pattern (Coss & Ramak-
rishnan, 2000).
Similarly, natural selection is thought to shape the evolu-
tion of visual system in humans too (Isbell, 2006). This
evolved attentional bias persists in humans today, even among
those living in a highly modified, often urban environment,
where animal threats are no longer present and patterns sig-
nifying animal threats are no longer relevant. This is because
the present design of animals is determined by historical
sources of selection (Tooby & Cosmides, 1990). As such, the
attentional bias for detecting threats in the environment can
still be automatic triggers of attention (Tooby & Cosmides,
1990). It has been shown that even small portions of snakeskin
and snake scales are sufficient for detection and recognition
by vervet monkeys (Isbell & Etting, 2017). Animals combine
the knowledge of animal patterns with that animal's behavior
to respond appropriately. For example, bonnet macaques in
India spent a greater proportion of time monitoring and obser-
ving when presented with a patterned model of a constricting
python but startled or ran a greater proportion of encounters
when presented with a patterned model of a venomous cobra,
reflecting the various types of threats these two species of
snakes posed (Ramakrishnan, Coss, Schank, Dharawat, &
Kim, 2005).
This automatic orientation of attention toward threat stimuli
could be related to the stimuli's associations with fear. This
automatic activation of a fear response was tested by O
¨ hman,
Flykt, and Esteves (2001) who found that participants were
consistently faster at locating fear relevant stimuli compared
to fear irrelevant stimuli against fear relevant and fear irrele-
vant backgrounds. Penkunas and Coss (2013a) conducted a
study on children and adults' abilities to detect historically
important animal threats. Findings from the study revealed that
American children and adults were better at detecting poten-
tially dangerous target animals in visual matrices of nondan-
gerous animals (e.g., target snakes in arrays of lizards)
compared with nondangerous animals in visual matrices of
dangerous ones (e.g., target antelopes in arrays of lions), where
the dangerous animals "popped out" in the matrix of nonthrea-
tening distractors. These effects were found to be consistent
when tested in urban and rural India where children may be
more likely to encounter threatening animals (Penkunas &
Coss, 2013b). Eye tracking research using similar visual arrays
of snakes and lizards and lions and antelope provided addi-
tional support that dangerous animals can be visually salient
(see Yorzinski, Penkunas, Platt, & Coss, 2014). In a related
context, Vagnoni, Lourenco, and Longo (2012) tested partici-
pants with looming stimuli, measuring perceived time-to-
collision with the stimuli, found similar results. Participants
underestimated the time-to-collision for threatening stimuli,
such as snakes and spiders, as opposed to nonthreatening images
such as butterflies and rabbits.
As mentioned earlier, attentional biases are often based on
commonalities among objects in terms of features. For exam-
ple, natural selection for responding to looming stimuli has
likely acted upon a simple principle of physics: The angular
size of objects that are approaching will extend upon a larger
area in the retina (Nalbach, 1990). We similarly propose that
natural selection has shaped the attentional bias for visual pat-
terns with repetitive features, particularly tessellation. Tessel-
lated patterns are complex geometrical patterns and shapes that
are repetitive and comprise of stripes, spots, crossing-over
lines, and many edges with no gaps in between or overlap. The
features of many threatening animals such as scorpion chitin,
snakeskin, or leopard skin, often feature tessellation. We pro-
pose that these repetitive patterns are visually conspicuous
against the nonrepetitive randomness of the larger environ-
ment, allowing for natural selection to shape the visual system
to respond selectively to these repeating patterns (cf. Coss,
2003; Isbell, 2006) and guide the evolution of appropriate
behavior in response to these threats.
From a historical perspective, these evolutionarily provoca-
tive patterns have also played a role in human clothing. Dec-
orative clothing is thought to reflect and convey information
regarding the wearer's self-image, personality, or social status
(Kaiser, 1997), and thus a desire to stand out and be noticed.
Animal prints are often used for this purpose not just today but

have been used for a large part of human history. Cultures
varying widely temporally and geographically, from cave
dwellers in Southern Africa tens of thousands of years ago
to the Aztecs in Mesoamerica a few hundreds of years ago,
have depicted humans and mythological creatures wearing
various animal skins for ritualistic purposes (Jolly, 2002).
Other innately provocative patterns and features have been
similarly used. Forward facing eye-like patterns have been
used across cultures in an apotropaic manner intended
to divert gaze and protect the wearer from the "evil eye"
(Coldiron, 2005; Su
¨tterlin, 1989). In recent decades, patterns
representing dangerous animals such as leopards, snakes, and
crocodiles, among others, are commonly used in clothing and
accessories. As a result, we considered clothing as a suitable
medium upon which to test the effectiveness of various pat-
terns in capturing attention.
While the evocative properties of evolutionarily important
threats are well established, the premise of whether repetition is
the key feature behind recognition of evolutionarily important
threats has not been empirically tested. The current study aims
to empirically test this premise by examining how human
respondents react to pictures of models wearing clothing that
bears different repeating and nonrepeating patterns including
animal skin patterns. Based on the literature, animal skin pat-
terns should be the most provocative, which is to say that they
should capture attention faster and hold attention longer in
comparison with other nonanimal skin patterns. However,
because we hypothesize that the driver of this evolutionary bias
is pattern repetition, we broaden our hypothesis to predict that
repeating nonanimal print patterns on clothing should be
equally as provocative as repeating animal print patterns on
clothing. We hypothesize that both the animal skin patterns
and the repeating nonanimal skin patterns should engender a
shorter time to fixation and elicit longer fixation duration than
the nonrepeating nonanimal skin patterns.
We present below two experimental studies to test this pre-
mise. In Experiment 1, we aimed to investigate attention bias
toward the various categories of test stimuli. We anticipated
that ecologically relevant patterns would lead to a longer fixa-
tion duration compared to ecologically irrelevant patterns. In
Experiment 2, we aimed to investigate the idea that potentially
threatening patterns "pop out" of the environment and into
attentional focus relative to nonthreatening patterns. To exam-
ine pattern salience, we anticipated that participants engaged in
the visual-search task would locate repetitive clothing patterns
faster than nonrepetitive clothing patterns.
Experiment 1
Experiment 1 was a free observation task where participants
observed two pictures of the same model side by side on the
screen wearing different patterns on clothing. The purpose of
Experiment 1 was to evaluate whether certain patterns were
more evocative than others, as evidenced by greater total fixa-
tion duration from participants preferentially spending more
time looking at them. It was expected that ecologically relevant
patterns would elicit greater total fixation duration compared to
ecologically irrelevant patterns.
Method
Participants
Fifty-one students from the University of Nottingham Malaysia
Campus took part in this experiment. Participants' ages ranged
between 18 and 31 years (M ¼ 21.35, SD ¼ 2.08 years) com-
prising of 9 males and 42 females. All participants had normal
or corrected to normal vision.
Ethics
The Science and Engineering Research Ethics Committee of the
University of Nottingham Malaysia Campus provided ethics
approval for this research under protocol number AZ220914.
Apparatus and materials
We created stimuli consisting of four male and four female
models in relaxed postures (Appendix A), each wearing six
different clothing patterns; leopard (Panthera pardus)
rosettes print, Southeast Asian reticulated python (Python
reticulatus) snakeskin print, floral design, camouflage shapes,
plain surface, and shiny surface (Appendix B). Each model
was duplicated and the clothing pattern was edited for the six
different designs using GNU Image Manipulation Program
(GIMP) Version 2.8.2. In this experiment, trials composed
of images of the same model in different clothing patterns
placed side by side, in all possible combinations of the pat-
terns. These combinations were randomized and counterba-
lanced. Therefore, for this experiment, participants responded
to 120 trials of model­pattern combinations presented side by
side. For each trial, an area of interest (AOI) was defined over
each of the clothing patterns presented over which the eye
tracker would monitor fixation (Figure 1). Hence, for each
trial consisting of two models wearing different patterns side
by side, two areas of interest were defined. The experiment
was conducted using the Tobii Eye Tracker T120XL and the
Tobii Pro Studio software (version 3.1.6), which were used to
program the task. All stimuli were automatically adjusted to
the eye tracker's 1,280 Â 1,024 pixel resolution display. The
models displayed to the participants on the eye tracker mea-
sured 9.5 cm in height and 2.9 cm in width. Participants'
viewing distance to the screen was approximately 48 cm.
Design
A within-participants design was used. The independent vari-
able was type of pattern, consisting of six levels (leopard,
snake, floral, camouflage, plain, and shiny). Although absent
of surface texture, a shiny clothing feature was included
because shiny objects have been shown to attract attention
aesthetically (Coss, 1990; Coss, Ruff, & Simms, 2003; Meert,
Pandelaere, & Patrick, 2014). The dependent variable was total

fixation duration, measured in milliseconds (ms). Total fixation
duration is the total amount of time that the participant fixates
on an AOI on the image while it appears on the screen.
Procedure
After being presented with and signing an informed consent
form, they were briefed on the task. After a calibration proce-
dure with the Tobii Eye Tracker, the experiment began, which
consisted of one block of 120 randomized and counterbalanced
trials being made up of all combinations of patterns for all
models. Each trial consisted of a duration of 4,000 ms, during
which time a white fixation cross would first appear in the
center of a black background for 1,000 ms followed by a pair
of pattern-wearing models presented side by side for another
3,000 ms. After this, the next trial would begin automatically,
starting with the fixation cross on a black background for 1,000
ms and then a new pair of pattern-wearing models presented
side by side for 3,000 ms. This continued until all 120 trials
were completed. The experiment lasted a total of eight minutes
(120 trials of 4 s each). Participants were instructed to look at
the fixation cross when it was present on screen but otherwise
look at the screen freely wherever they chose. See Figure 2 for
a diagrammatic representation of the experimental procedure.
Results
A repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) was con-
ducted to investigate whether there was a main effect of pattern
(leopard, snake, floral, camouflage, plain, and shiny) on the
total duration of visual fixation. Mauchly's test indicated
the assumption of sphericity had been violated for pattern,
w2(14) ¼ 26.181, p ¼ .025; therefore, degrees of freedom for
pattern were adjusted using Huynh­Feldt estimates of spheri-
city (e ¼ .850). Results from the ANOVA found a significant
main effect of pattern; F(4.7, 234.7) ¼ 12.985, p < .001.
Pairwise comparisons showed that the floral pattern
obtained reliably greater fixation duration than all of the other
clothing designs used, while the leopard skin, snakeskin, shiny,
and camouflage patterns obtained reliably greater fixation
duration than the plain clothing (see Table 1 and Figure 3).
Discussion
In this experiment, the animal skin patterns of leopard rosettes
and snake-scale shapes elicited greater viewing time from par-
ticipants as expected. However, we also found that, among the
entire set of clothing patterns, the floral pattern engendered the
longest visual fixation. We propose that this might be a result of
an attentional bias where participants were evaluating the intri-
cate and complex aspect of the floral print. Finally, as antici-
pated, we found that the plain pattern was the least evocative
among the patterns tested.

was to evaluate whether certain patterns were more evocative than
others, as evidenced by a shorter time to first fixation from parti-
cipants noticing them faster. It was expected that repetitive pat-
terns, particularly ecologically relevant patterns, would elicit a
shorter time to first fixation compared to nonrepetitive patterns.
Method
Participants
Forty-five students from the University of Nottingham Malay-
sia Campus took part in this study. Participants' ages ranged
between 18 and 31 years (M ¼ 21.46, SD ¼ 2.10 years) com-
prising of 8 males and 37 females. All participants had normal
or corrected to normal vision. Participants taking part in this
experiment had also taken part in Experiment 1 and were there-
fore familiar with the appearance of the models and patterns at
the start of the experiment. Both experiments were conducted
during the same session, with a short break provided for parti-
cipants between Experiments 1 and 2.
Apparatus and materials
We created stimuli consisting of six male and six female mod-
els (Appendix A), each wearing six different clothing patterns;
leopard (P. pardus) rosettes print, Southeast Asian reticulated
python (P. reticulatus) snakeskin print, floral print, camouflage
print, plain print, and shiny print (Appendix B). Each model
was duplicated and the clothing pattern was edited for the six
different designs using GIMP Version 2.8.2. In each of the 72
trials, a model wearing a pattern was placed in an image of a
crowded Dubai International Airport terminal (refer to
Appendix C). The target models were placed in one of nine
different locations on the terminal image, from front to back
and left to right. The size of the target varied depending on
whether it appeared in the front, middle, or back of the pic-
ture. The dimensions were 4.2-cm height Â 0.9-cm width for
the front, 3.0-cm height Â 0.8-cm width for the middle, and
2.0-cm height Â 0.5-cm width for the back. Participants'
viewing distance to the screen was approximately 48 cm. The
locations were randomized and counterbalanced for the
experiment, so all of the patterns were observed on multiple
models at each possible location to control for size effects. For
each trial, an AOI was defined using rectangular AOIs (see
Figure 4 for an example of AOIs) over the target model, with a
single AOI being present during each trial.
The experiment was conducted using the Tobii Eye Tracker
T120XL and the Tobii Pro Studio software, which was used to
program the task. All stimuli were automatically adjusted to the
eye tracker's 1,280 Â 1,024 pixel resolution display.
Design
Similar to Experiment 1, a within-participants design was used.
The independent variable was type of pattern, consisting of six
levels (leopard, snake, floral, camouflage, plain, and shiny). The
dependent variable was the time to first fixation (fixation
latency) measured in ms. The time to first fixation was the period
between the appearance of the image on the screen and when the
participant shifted his or her attention by fixating the image AOI.
Procedure
Participants were briefed on the task, and informed consent was
obtained. After a calibration procedure, the experiment began,
which consisted of one block of 72 trials. Each trial consisted of
an image obtained from Google Images of a crowded terminal
building from Dubai International Airport with a model wear-
ing one of the clothing patterns in one of nine locations on the
image (top right, top center, top left, middle right, middle cen-
ter, middle left, bottom right, bottom center, and bottom left).
The same background image was used in all trials with only the
location of the models being varied. The size of the model
wearing the pattern was adjusted to match the size of other
individuals in the image around the target model. The location
of the models on the image was randomized and counterba-
lanced across the 72 trials. Each trial first began with a pre-
paration screen with the text "GET READY" in white color
font in the center of a black background for 1,000 ms. This was
then followed by a white fixation cross appearing in the center
of a black background for another 1,000 ms, after which the
airport terminal image was presented. The participants had
been instructed to examine the scene until they locate one of
the models they had seen previously in Experiment 1. When
they had located the target, they were instructed to provide a
manual response by clicking on the mouse in order to proceed
to the next trial. See Figure 5 for a diagrammatic representation
of the experimental procedure.
Results
A repeated measures ANOVA was conducted, measuring
the fixation latency in the visual-search task, to investigate

whether there was main effect of clothing pattern (leopard,
snake, floral, camouflage, plain, and shiny). Mauchly's test
of sphericity indicated the assumption of sphericity had
been violated, w2(14) ¼ 41.175, p < .001; therefore, degrees
of freedom were adjusted using Greenhouse­Geisser esti-
mates of sphericity (e ¼ .728). Results from the ANOVA
found a significant main effect of pattern; F(3.6, 160.1) ¼
3.068, p ¼ .022.
Pairwise comparisons showed that leopard skin, floral print,
and camouflage patterns were detected reliably faster than the
plain and shiny clothing designs (see Table 2 and Figure 6).
Discussion
In this experiment, both the animal skin pattern of leopard
and the repetitive floral pattern were located significantly
faster than the plain and shiny patterns. However, the snake-
skin pattern did not show the anticipated effect. We propose
that this might be a result of the species of snakeskin used,
which was prone to pattern blending when viewed at a dis-
tance and thus resulted in higher variation in fixation of the
target by participants leading to a nonsignificant compari-
son. Surprisingly, the camouflage pattern was located sig-
nificantly faster than the plain and shiny patterns, and we
propose that this was due to the high contrast of the pattern
that made it stand out in the context of an airplane terminal

could not occur.
General Discussion
Our findings support the hypothesis that repetition of specific
visual features might facilitate target detection, especially
those characterizing evolutionary important threats. In Experi-
ment 1, the animal skin patterns of leopard rosettes and snake-
scale shapes elicited significantly higher total fixation duration
than the plain pattern. This is consistent with previous findings
from literature that animal skin patterns are evocative (Coss,
1991; Coss & Ramakrishnan, 2000; O
¨ hman, Flykt, & Esteves,
2001; Penkunas & Coss, 2013a, 2013b; Tooby & Cosmides,
1990; Yorzinski et al., 2014).
Contrary to prediction, however, we also found that, among
the entire set of clothing patterns, the floral pattern engendered
the longest visual fixation. This result might reflect an atten-
tional bias in which participants were evaluating the intricate
and complex aspects of the floral prints (see Figure 7). This
argument is consistent with the finding that the least decorative
plain pattern sustained the reliably shortest attention among the
set of clothing patterns. Our findings that the leopard and snake
animal patterns were less evocative than the floral pattern do
not support our hypothesis. It may be that the floral pattern was
more evocative as a result of familiarity (Hekkert, Snelders, &
van Wieringen, 2003), but this is unlikely because the floral
pattern that we used was a very intricate and repeating pattern
that is not commonly observed in floral prints. Another expla-
nation is that the floral patterns were preferred because the
animal skin patterns engendered selective avoidance due to
their provocativeness (Bradley, Costa, & Lang, 2015), but this
is also unlikely because the animal skin patterns were selec-
tively preferred compared to the plain pattern. A more likely
explanation of our findings are that the ecologically important
properties of these patterns are not relevant when presented in
the decorative context of clothing, in a situation where there is
no apparent threat that can be evaluated by sustained fixation.
The floral pattern used in our experiment may have had
enhanced visual appeal as a result of it having a combination
of two salient features: aesthetically pleasing flowers and
attention-grabbing repetitiveness.
In Experiment 2, when participants were required to locate
the pattern in a visual-search task, the animal skin pattern of
leopard and the repetitive floral print patterns exhibited nearly
equal mean fixation latency from participants. They both were
located significantly faster than the plain and shiny patterns.
The speed of detection of the floral pattern supports the
hypothesis that the repetitive properties of the floral pattern
enhanced its conspicuousness. A complementary explanation
is that by introducing artificial repetitiveness into a pattern
made up of flowers, the floral pattern evoked a sense of dan-
ger typically associated with snakeskin, or other repetitive
patterns found on animals.
While the snake and camouflage patterns had nearly equal
mean fixation latencies, the camouflage pattern was detected
significantly faster than the plain and shiny patterns, whereas
there was no significant effect toward faster detection of the
snake pattern compared to the plain and shiny patterns (p ¼
.10). We used the Southeast Asian reticulated python for the
snakeskin pattern because it is a commonly used pattern for
snakeskin designs and we expected the repeating diamond
shapes to be very provocative. The Southeast Asian reticulated
python is a known predator of humans (Headland & Greene,
2011), likely dating back to the late-Pleistocene when modern
humans first settled Southeast Asia. However, the fine cross-
hatched snake scales are hard to resolve when viewed at a
distance (see Kawai & He, 2016), leaving only the larger

diamond clusters framing the snake scales visible as the pre-
dominant feature for capturing attention (Figure 7). This is a
consequence of pattern blending where surfaces of black and
white squares or black and white spotted surfaces appear to be
of an even gray tone when viewed from a distance (Mottram,
1915). This may have resulted in the relatively higher variation
in visual fixation of the target image by participants for the
snakeskin pattern and the nonsignificant effect in comparison
with the plain and shiny patterns.
On the other hand, the surprising evocativeness of the
camouflage pattern compared to the plain and shiny patterns
could be attributed to the complexity of the camouflage design
and the high contrast and brightness of the pattern used relative
to the surroundings. While the camouflage pattern may be
random and blend into a natural setting with similar back-
grounds, when used in our experimental scenarios, particularly
in the setting of an airport terminal mall in Experiment 2, it
stood out substantially relative to its surroundings without the
consistency necessary for pattern blending to occur (see Mot-
tram, 1915).
Our findings could have important implications for wildlife
trade. Animal skins and furs are traded to produce clothing,
shoes, bags, decorations, and other items (Broad, Mulliken, &
Roe, 2003). This trade consists of illegally (such as leopard
skins) and legally (such as snakeskins) traded products (Broad
et al., 2003; Zhou & Jiang, 2004). From the late-1990s onward,
there was a surge in the use of animal skins in clothing in
China, with the previously uncommon trade being driven more
by fashion than by tradition (World Bank, 2010). The use of
animal skins being driven by fashion in clothing and decoration
may be to reflect and convey information regarding the wear-
er's self-image, personality, or social status (Kaiser, 1997), and
thus a desire to stand out and be noticed.
However, our findings indicate that animal skin patterns do
not carry their ecologically provocative properties through to
clothing. Our findings suggest that an artificially created
repeating pattern or a high contrast pattern can carry equally
provocative properties through to clothing. For example, the
floral pattern held attention longer than any of the animal skin
patterns; the camouflage pattern showed faster detection
when compared against a plain pattern in a way that the snake-
skin pattern did not. Our results show that in the context of
clothing fashion trends could be driven toward these patterns
as being more effective in reflecting wearers' desire to stand
out and be noticed.
In conclusion, our findings support our broader hypothesis
that pattern repetition in clothing prints is a key visual feature
that captures and maintains attention. Rapid fixation of repeti-
tive clothing patterns is similarly affected by pattern complex-
ity in which higher visual contrast captures attention much
more effectively than less contrasting shiny or plain clothing
patterns. Future research on pattern repetition will address the
unanticipated contextual properties of attentional biases to
intricate but nonthreatening patterns.
