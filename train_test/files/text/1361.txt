ABSTRACT: The prevalence of asthma has been on the increase in the USA and
worldwide. To understand the worsening epidemiological trends of asthma, this study
analysed the data from the third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES III) to determine the prevalence and risk factors for asthma and wheezing
among US adults.
This analysis used data from 18,825 US adults aged o20 yrs who had participated in
the NHANES III project. After excluding subjects with physician-diagnosed emphy-
sema, a total of 18,393 subjects were included in the final analysis.
The prevalence of current asthma (asthma) was 4.5% and the prevalence of wheezing
in the previous 12 months (wheezing) was 16.4%. Mexican-Americans exhibited the
lowest prevalence of asthma when compared with other race/ethnic groups. Multiple
logistic regression analysis showed that Mexican-Americans were less likely to report
asthma when compared to non-Hispanic whites. Low education level, female sex, current
and past smoking status, pet ownership, lifetime diagnosis of physician-diagnosed hay
fever and obesity were all significantly associated with asthma and/or wheezing. No
significant effect of indoor air pollutants, as derived from the use of household heating/
cooking appliances, on asthma and wheezing was observed in this study.
In conclusion, this study observed racial/ethnic differences in the prevalence of
asthma and wheezing and identified several important risk factors that may contribute
to development and/or exacerbation of asthma and wheezing. Contrary to earlier
reports, the proxy measures of indoor air pollution used in this study were not found to
be associated with increased risk of asthma and wheezing.

The incidence, prevalence and severity of asthma have been
increasing in the general population, both worldwide and in
the USA, for the past two decades [1]. There are y14 million
people in the USA suffering from asthma. The prevalence of
self-reported asthma increased by 75% in the USA from
1980­1994 and the states with the highest prevalence of self-
reported asthma were California (7.1%) New York (6.8%)
and Texas (6%) [2]. In the largest asthma prevalence survey
conducted to date, the European Community Respiratory
Health Survey (ECRHS), an overall prevalence of 4.5%
in adults aged 20­44 yrs was found. However, there was
considerable variation among the 22 countries studied [3].
In the absence of any gold standard, and because of
the variable nature of the disease, accurate case findings of
asthma, outside of the clinical setting, is very challenging. A
variety of methods have been used in epidemiological surveys
to define asthma: self reports of physician-diagnosed asthma
[4, 5], presence of asthma symptoms, such as wheezing [5],
combination of asthma symptoms, e.g. discriminate function
predictors [5], or objective measurements like spirometry [6]
or use of methacholine or histamine for testing bronchial
responsiveness [5, 7]. Each approach may lead to selection of
different study groups with asthma, thereby reporting results
that may not be comparable. Although, large-scale epidemio-
logical surveys, such as the ECRHS, have been conducted
using nonspecific bronchial challenge [3], the cost and techni-
cal skills involved remain a limiting factor in their widespread
use. Hence, questionnaire-based self-reports of asthma remain
the most commonly used approach for defining asthma in
epidemiological surveys.
The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES) provided a rich population-based dataset to
identify determinants of asthma and wheezing. This study
analysed the data gathered from the third, and most recent,
round of the NHANES, to estimate the prevalence and
determine the risk factors for adult asthma and wheezing in
this population.
Materials and methods
The National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) con-
ducts several large-scale surveys to assess the general health
status of the USA9s general population. Data from the
NHANES III, which was conducted by NCHS from 1988­
1994, was used. Detailed descriptions of the stratified cluster
sampling strategy have been described elsewhere [8]. This
survey gathered information regarding the health status of
y40,000 American individuals, aged o2 months old with no
preset upper age limit. In order to obtain reliable estimates of
the health status of different population subgroups, younger
children, older persons, Mexican-Americans and African-
Americans were sampled in large numbers. The overall

response rate in the NHANES III was 82% (80% for Whites,
86% for Blacks, and 87% for Mexican-Americans) [9].
Study population and outcome variables
The analyses involved using data from the 18,825 adults
aged o20 yrs and who were interviewed in the NHANES III
project. In this analysis two outcome variables, asthma and
wheezing, were used. Current asthma (asthma) was defined as
an affirmative response to the question "Has a doctor ever
told you that you had asthma?" and "Do you still have
asthma?" Wheezing was defined as an affirmative response to
the question "Have you had wheezing or whistling in your
chest at any time in the past 12 months?" Subjects who
responded in the affirmative to the following question "Has a
doctor ever told you that you had emphysema?" (item
HAC1G in NHANES III, n=432) were excluded from the
analysis.
Independent variable selection
Independent variables included in the analysis were selected
based on risk factors reported in the literature, and classified
into five broad conceptual categories: 1) demographic i.e. age,
sex, race/ethnicity, urban/rural, and census region; 2) socio-
economic i.e. education and poverty income ratio; 3) indoor
air quality based on the response to a limited number of
questions on the use of a space heater, furnace, or oven to
heat the home; 4) allergy, hay fever; and 5) other character-
istics i.e. smoking history, body mass index (BMI), and family
and household size.
Statistical analysis
Since the NHANES III uses a complex survey design, a
statistical package (STATA statistical software; Stata Inc.,
College Station, TX), which allows users to incorporate
sampling weights and compute sampling variances, was used
for the analysis. Simple descriptive statistics were used to
describe the study population, followed by univariate and
multivariate analyses using logistic regression to explore the
association between independent variables and the outcome
variable. Separate univariate and multivariate models were
built using asthma and wheezing as the outcome variable. All
variables significant at pv0.1 were considered for inclusion in
the final model. Multiple logistic regression analysis was used
to simultaneously adjust for the various independent vari-
ables. Estimated crude odds ratios (ORs), and adjusted ORs
with their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI) were
calculated.
Results
Based on the study inclusion and exclusion criteria, a total
of 18,393 study subjects aged o20 yrs were included in the
analysis. Table 1 describes the weighted percentage of the
respondents by selected demographic and housing-related
variables. The prevalence of asthma was 4.5%, while wheezing
was reported as 16.4%. The prevalence of asthma and wheez-
ing did not differ significantly across different age groups
(table 2). When restricted to age group 20­44 yrs (as used in
the ECRHS), the prevalence of asthma was 4.7 % (95% CI
4.0­5.5) and the prevalence of wheezing was 17.5% (95% CI
16.3­18.6).
An estimated 11.4% of the USA population were living
below poverty level and an estimated 24.7% had v12 yrs of
education (table 3). Approximately 28% of adults were
current smokers. The estimated prevalence of obesity (defined
as BMI o30) among adults was 30%. Mexican-Americans
formed the largest ethnic group living below the poverty level.
More than one-half also reported receivingv12 yrs of educa-
tion (table 3).
Mexican-Americans exhibited the lowest prevalence of asthma
(2.9%) when compared with other race/ethnic groups. The
prevalence of wheezing was highest among non-Hispanic

Whites when compared with Mexican-Americans and African-
Americans (table 3). The estimated prevalences of other respira-
tory conditions and symptoms were significantly lower among
non-Hispanic Blacks and Mexican-Americans than non-
Hispanic Whites (table 3).
The prevalence of asthma was significantly higher among
females (5.4%, 95% CI 4.6­6.2) than males (3.6%, 95% CI
2.8­4.4). No differences, however, were observed for wheez-
ing. The prevalence of asthma and wheezing did not vary
significantly by region. However, when the data were stratified
by race/ethnicity, an interesting pattern was observed. Mexican-
Americans living in the south region of the USA had the
lowest prevalence of asthma (1.5%, 95% CI 1.0­2.1) while the
other race/ethnicity group (which included other Hispanics
and Asian populations) had the highest prevalence in the
Northeast (6.5%, 95% CI 1.1­1.9) and Midwest regions (8.8%,
95% CI 3.2­14.4). Mexican-Americans in the Northeast had
the highest prevalence of wheezing (19.0%, 95% CI 9.2­28.8),
and those in the Midwest exhibited the lowest prevalence
(8.6%, 95% CI 4.7­12.4). The other race/ethnic group had the
highest prevalence of wheezing in the Midwest region (21.7%,
95% CI 6.2­37.1) (figs 1 and 2).
The estimated crude and adjusted ORs with 95% CIs for
associations between independent risk factors and asthma and
self-reported wheezing in the previous 12 months are pre-
sented in table 4. Mexican-Americans were 0.61-times less
likely to report asthma when compared with non-Hispanic
Whites. Female sex, living below poverty, low-education level,
living in an older house, pet ownership, lifetime diagnosis
of physician-diagnosed hay fever (hay fever) and obesity were
all significantly associated with asthma. Current and past
smoking history did not show any significant associations
with asthma.
Race/ethnicity was an important risk factor for wheezing.
Mexican-Americans (adjusted OR=0.55) and non-Hispanic
blacks (adjusted OR=0.58) showed a significantly lower risk
for wheezing. Living in the west census region of the USA did
not show a significant association in the univariate analysis.

ANALYSIS OF NHANES III DATA
However, when adjusted for other variables in the model a
statistically significant association was observed (adjusted
OR=1.24). Use of a stove/oven for heating by the residence in
the previous 12 months showed a 45% increased odds of
wheezing in the univariate analysis. This point estimate
decreased when adjusted for other variables in the final
model, but was retained due to its strong univariate effect.
There were no significant differences in the prevalence
of asthma and wheezing for the use of stove/ovens between
male and females. Owning a pet was also significant in the
univariate analysis, however, the effect was diluted and
became nonsignificant when adjusted for other variables in
the model. A moderate association of BMI with wheezing was
observed for both underweight and obese individuals in the
univariate analysis. However, the OR increased significantly
from 1.30 to 1.52 for obese individuals only. When stratified
by sex, no significant differences in the prevalence of asthma
and wheezing for obesity were observed. A strong association
of wheezing with past and current smoking history was
observed in this analysis. Living below the poverty level, and
lifetime history of hay fever were also significantly associated
with wheezing.
Discussion
The major strength of the present analysis is that it is
based on a large representative national sample of the USA
population. Few population-based studies have addressed the
prevalence of asthma among adults in the USA.
The results show that the prevalence of current asthma was
4.5% and the prevalence of wheezing was 16.5%. Previously
reported prevalence rates of asthma in adults have ranged
from below 3% to over 20% [2, 3, 10, 11]. In the NHANES II,
TURKELTAUB and GERGEN [11] reported a prevalence of 6.9%
and 9.2% among Whites and Blacks, respectively, based on
Table 4. ­ Estimated crude and adjusted odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) using current asthma and wheezing

self-reported physician diagnosis of asthma. JANSON et al. [3]
in a recent review of ECRHS data compared geographical
variation in the prevalence of asthma and asthma symptoms
in 22 countries. The median prevalence of current asthma
was 4.5% (range 2.0­11.9) similar to the results found in this
study. In the ECRHS, asthma prevalence was generally
higher in English-speaking countries. The median prevalence
of wheezing was 20.7% (range 4.1­32.0), i.e. slightly higher
than what was found in the present study. However, it is
difficult to directly compare prevalence rates observed in this
study with other reports due to the use of different popula-
tions and case definitions.
There was a significantly higher prevalence of asthma,
but not wheezing, among females in this study. Asthma and
wheeze are generally reported to be higher among male
children, but the trend usually reverses around puberty [3,
12­14]. It has been suggested that the higher prevalence rates
observed among females could partly be due to their smaller
airway calibre size [13]. Alternately, it may also reflect the
tendency among physicians to diagnose a respiratory condi-
tion as asthma in females and chronic obstructive pulmonary
disorder (COPD) in males [10].
Contrary to earlier reports [10, 15] non-Hispanic Blacks did
not have a higher risk of asthma in this study. Moreover, non-
Hispanic Blacks showed less wheezing compared with non-
Hispanic Whites, and Mexican-Americans showed the lowest
risk of asthma and wheezing compared with the other groups.
Previous studies from California, New Mexico and Arizona
have found a lower risk of asthma and other respiratory
diseases among Mexican-American adults [6, 16]. Results
from the Hispanic Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
suggested that Puerto Rican children have the highest preval-
ence of asthma (20.1%) compared with Mexican-Americans
(4.5%), non-Hispanic Whites (6.4%) and non-Hispanic Blacks
(9.1%) [15]. It has been argued that the lower risk among
Mexican-Americans can be explained by differences in socio-
economic status (SES) and access to healthcare. However, in
the present study, rates remained significantly lower among
Mexican-Americans, even after controlling for SES and other
confounding factors.
There were no overall differences in prevalence of asthma
and wheezing across regions, although a variation across
different race/ethnic groups by region was observed. Earlier
reports indicated that the morbidity and mortality of asthma
among Puerto Rican Hispanics is highest in the north-eastern
USA [17]. The 1988 National Health Interview Survey also
found the highest prevalence of asthma among children
younger than 18 yrs of age in the north-eastern region of the
USA [18]. This study found the highest prevalence of asthma
was among the other race/ethnic groups and the highest
prevalence of wheezing among Mexican-Americans to be in
the north-eastern USA. In the NHANES III, Hispanics who
were not self-reported as Mexican-American were included in
the other race/ethnic groups category and these should have
included Puerto Ricans. Therefore, the possibility of mis-
classification of Puerto Ricans as Mexican-Americans is not
likely to explain the high prevalence of wheezing observed in
this region. A variety of factors could explain the decreased
risk of asthma among Mexican-Americans. These include
genetic/biological factors, differences in health beliefs and
behaviours among Hispanic subgroups, protective psycho-
social effects, consumption of a diet rich in fruit and vegetables,
and differences in migration pattern, favouring a "healthy
migrant effect" [17, 19].
The majority of the relatively few studies that have looked
at the relationship between asthma and poverty in adults have
found an association between low SES and asthma, as was the
case in this study. This was also true in the two previous
rounds of the NHANES survey [4, 10, 11]. Persistent wheeze
was also found to be associated with poverty among children,
based on parental social class [20]. In contrast, MIELCK et al.
[21] in a review of 24 studies found either no association or
negative association of SES with asthma. However, in their
own study, the authors found a strong association between
poverty and severe asthma (OR 2.37, 95% CI 1.28­4.41).
Differences in the measurement of SES and definitions
of poverty may be partly responsible for the inconsistent
findings.
In this present study, the prevalence of asthma and/or
wheezing was affected by various environmental factors. Both
current and past smoking, were strong predictors of wheezing,
but not of asthma, compared with never-smokers, this was
most marked in current smokers. These results did not change
when the analysis was restricted to subjects aged 20­44 yrs;
this finding is consistent with that of the ECRHS [3]. The
relationship between smoking and asthma has been a sub-
ject of interest and conflicting findings. Thus, several studies
have reported an association between smoking and asthma
and/or wheezing [3, 22, 23], but others have not [10, 24,
25]. Although the harmful effects of maternal smoking on
the respiratory system of developing foetuses and children
have been well documented [26], no clear cause and effect
relationship between smoking and asthma in adults has been
established. Cigarette smoke is likely to induce increased
permeability of respiratory epithelium, which may result in
increased "trafficking" of allergens and other inflammatory
cells to submucosal cells resulting in allergic inflammation of
the airways [27].
The use of space heaters, furnaces or gas stoves may affect
indoor humidity levels, which might indirectly contribute to
the growth of house dust mite, especially when malfunction-
ing. They can also generate oxides of nitrogen, which are
oxidant gases and indoor air pollutants. Studies performed in
some European countries [28, 29], but not in the USA [30],
have reported increased risk of wheezing among females using
gas cookers. In the ECRHS, although a positive association
was found with gas cooking, this was limited to females and
there was considerable variation among countries [3]. The
results from this study are consistent with those of earlier
USA-based studies; a moderate associations between the use
of a gas stove and wheezing was observed only in the univariate
analysis. No quantitative measurements of indoor pollutants
or allergens were made in NHANES III, and the questions
relating to indoor air were narrow in their scope; these are
important limitations to the study9s findings. The relation-
ship of these findings to housing characteristics and home
heating, ventilation and air conditioning should be further
explored.
Previously, pet ownership has been linked to asthma and
asthma symptoms in children and adults [31] as found in this
study. The magnitude of the association with wheezing, how-
ever, was diluted and became nonsignificant after simulta-
neously adjusting for other confounders in the model. One
possible reason for this diminished effect could be that sub-
jects with wheezing avoided pets and this observed association
has been underestimated. Hay fever is a well-established risk
factor for asthma and wheezing, and the current findings are
consistent with this.
Until recently, few epidemiological studies have looked
at the relationship between obesity and asthma. However,
positive associations have been found in studies of nurses [32],
children [4], and British adults [33], and the results from the
present study are similar. Individuals with asthma tend to be
overweight [4] and obese individuals tend to have lower
pulmonary function tests [34]. Due to the cross-sectional
nature of the study it may be argued that the higher BMI is
a result of asthma, due to weight gain from corticosteroid
use or avoidance of physical activity. Obese individuals are

generally sedentary, which may result in increased time spent
indoors, thereby predisposing them to indoor air allergens,
environmental tobacco smoke, and dust mite antigens.
Obesity also predisposes to gastro-oesophageal reflux disease,
which may induce asthmatic symptoms [35]. Given the current
concern regarding obesity as a public health problem in the
USA, a more detailed evaluation of this association is
definitely warranted.
The major limitation of this analysis is the cross-sectional
nature, which precludes establishing temporal relationships
or inferring causality. Asthma is frequently misdiagnosed,
especially among the elderly and very young. With the
absence of any objective measure to test airway hyperrespon-
siveness (e.g. histamine or methacholine challenge tests) the
possibility of misclassification cannot be ruled out. However,
any such misclassification would likely be nondifferential.
In the present study, all subjects with emphysema in the final
analysis were removed but those who had responded affirma-
tively to the question on ever having been diagnosed as having
chronic bronchitis (item HAC1F in the NHANES III) were
retained. This decision was made because chronic bronchitis
is a symptom-based diagnosis and although the authors
recognise that the main risk factor for "true" chronic bron-
chitis is cigarette smoking, it is also true that asthma may
present with chronic cough as its only symptom (cough-
variant asthma). Consequently, there is a certain degree of
overlap between the two conditions in adults. Interestingly,
when a subgroup analysis was performed on persons who
indicated having a diagnosis of chronic bronchitis (but not
emphysema) and these respondents were stratified by smoking
status, a higher prevalence of current asthma was observed
among nonsmokers (22.3%, 95% CI 15.8­28.8), past smokers
(24.0%, 95% CI 14.8­33.1), and current smokers (24.7%, 95%
CI 17.5­31.8) with chronic bronchitis. This would support the
impression that there is some overlap (possibly misclassifica-
tion) between chronic bronchitis and asthma, but that smok-
ing status does not significantly impact the prevalence of
asthma in these persons. However, when the prevalence of
wheezing in the previous 12 months was examined in the same
subgroup of chronic bronchitis subjects, by smoking status,
the breakdown was as follows: nonsmokers (45.4%, 95% CI
36.8­53.9), past smokers (43.7%, 95% CI 33.4­54.0) and
current smokers (62.9%, 95% CI 55.8­69.9). Given the
disparity between the findings for asthma and wheezing, it is
possible that wheezing in current smokers reflects a condition
other than asthma (e.g. undiagnosed COPD, or chronic
obstructive bronchitis), leading to some misclassification of
asthma status.
In summary, this cross sectional analysis of the National
Health and Nutrition Examination III dataset showed that
race/ethnicity, female sex, socioeconomic status, smoking,
obesity, hay fever and pet ownership are important risk
factors for asthma and wheezing. Differences in prevalence of
asthma and wheeze were observed for USA regions when
stratified by race/ethnicity. Mexican-Americans are less likely
to report asthma and wheeze irrespective of their socio-
economic and health insurance status. No significant associa-
tions were found with a few surrogate measures of indoor air
quality.
