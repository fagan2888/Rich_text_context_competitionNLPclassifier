Bisphenol A (BPA) is a high-volume indus-
trial chemical that is polymerized to form
polycarbonate plastics and epoxy resins, and
is a constituent of some polyvinyl chloride
(PVC) plastics. These materials are used
to line metal food and drink containers, as
dental sealants, and for manufacturing poly-
carbonate drink containers. The ester bonds
that enable the polymerization of BPA can be
broken, particularly under exposure to heat,
releasing free BPA (Kang et al. 2006).
BPA has long been described as a weak
estrogen due to its low affinity for nuclear estro-
gen receptors, but recent studies have shown
that BPA is equipotent with estradiol in its abil-
ity to initiate rapid nongenomic responses from
membrane surface receptors (Quesada et al.
2002; Wozniak et al. 2005). Whether BPA can
cause human health effects is a matter of some
debate; the potential for harm to infants and
the fetus is currently considered more likely
than harm to adults [National Toxicology
Program (NTP) 2008; vom Saal et al. 2007].
The Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC) estimates that 93% of
Americans  6 years of age have detectable
urine levels of BPA (parent BPA and con-
jugated metabolites), based on 2003­2004
data from the National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey (NHANES) (Calafat
et al. 2008b). The median BPA for all ages
was 2.7 ng/mL, with the lowest creatinine-
corrected levels found in males, Mexican
Americans, and subjects with higher income.
Exposure is thought to be almost exclu-
sively from food (NTP 2008). For example,
Wilson et al. (2007) examined exposure to
BPA and other phenols in 275 young chil-
dren 1.5­5 years of age. They concluded that
99% of BPA exposure was dietary based on
measurements of BPA levels from a variety
of sources such as food, air, and house dust.
Because their preliminary survey did not find
BPA in tap water, it was not subsequently
measured in the main study (Wilson N, per-
sonal communication). Miyamoto and Kotake
(2006) modeled Japanese exposures and con-
cluded that 95% of adult male BPA intake
was from food and drink, excluding water.
In human adults, BPA is generally described
as rapidly metabolized, with elimination thought
to be virtually complete within 24 hr of expo-
sure. This conclusion is based primarily on three
human experimental studies of acute exposures,
although animal studies have generally led to
similar conclusions (Vandenberg et al. 2007).
Human pharmacokinetics after single
exposures were first reported by Völkel and
colleagues (2002). In this study, they gave six
volunteers deuterium-labeled BPA (5 mg)
by mouth and followed elimination in both
blood and urine for 42 hr. Urine levels, mea-
sured every 6 hr, peaked 6 hr after administra-
tion (19.1 µmol; 4,360 ng/mL); the authors
reported a urinary elimination half-life of
5.4 hr. Teeguarden et al. (2005) later used these
data in the construction of a physiologically
based pharmacokinetic model.
In their second acute exposure study,
Völkel et al. (2005) gave a much smaller dose
of labeled BPA (25 µg) to six volunteers, and
followed blood and urine levels for 7 hr. Urine
BPA peaked at 1­3 hr (42 nmol; 9.6 ng/mL),
with a reported urinary elimination half-life
of 4 hr.
Tsukioka et al. (2004) gave 100 µg oral
deuterium-labeled BPA to one subject and
measured urine BPA levels for 26.5 hr. Urine
BPA peaked at 30 min (90 ng/mL) and
returned to near baseline (2.2 ng/mL) in this
subject by 5 hr. They subsequently dosed 25
subjects with 50 µg BPA, and found that, on
average, 76% of administered BPA was elimi-
nated in the urine within 5 hr.
If the rapid BPA clearance seen in these
acute exposure studies also occurs in the
chronic exposures experienced by the general
population, and if BPA exposure is almost
entirely through non-water dietary intake,
then BPA levels in the population should be
inversely related to fasting time. Fasting time,
in this context, is analogous to the time after
dosing in an experimental pharmacokinetic
study. At the start of fasting, BPA exposure
should essentially stop and BPA elimination
should follow rapidly. Therefore, participants
with long fasting times before urine collection
should have substantially lower BPA urine
levels than those with shorter fasting times.
In this exploratory study, we present evi-
dence that these NHANES BPA data are not
consistent with the current consensus that
BPA exposures are both rapidly cleared and
almost entirely related to food intake. Instead,
it appears plausible that there is substantial

Background: It is commonly stated in the literature on human exposure to bisphenol A (BPA) that
food is the predominant BPA exposure source, and that BPA is rapidly and completely cleared from the
body. If this is correct, BPA levels in fasting individuals should decrease with increased fasting time.
Objectives: We set out to investigate the relationship between urine BPA concentration and fast-
ing time in a population-based sample.
Methods: We modeled log BPA urine concentration as a function of fasting time, adjusted for
urine creatinine and other confounders, in 1,469 adult participants in the 2003­2004 National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. We estimated the BPA "population-based half-life"
(pop½) for a fasting time of 0­24 hr, < 4.5 hr, 4.5­8.5 hr, and > 8.5 hr.
Results: The overall pop½ for the 0- to 24-hr interval was 43 hr [95% confidence interval (CI),
26­119 hr]. Among those reporting fasting times of 4.5­8.5 hr (n = 441), BPA declined significantly
with fasting time, with a pop½ of 4.1 hr (95% CI, 2.6­10.6 hr). However, within the fasting time
intervals of 0­4.5 hr (n = 129) and 8.5­24 hr (n = 899), we saw no appreciable decline. Fasting time
did not significantly predict highest (> 12 ng/mL) or lowest (below limit of detection) BPA levels.
Conclusions: Overall, BPA levels did not decline rapidly with fasting time in this sample. This
suggests substantial non
food exposure, accumulation in body tissues such as fat, or both. Explaining
these findings may require experimental pharmacokinetic studies of chronic BPA exposure, further
examination of BPA levels and effects in fat, and a search for important non
food sources.

non
food exposure, accumulation in body com-
partments with long elimination times, or both.
Methods
Study population. We used data from the
2003­2004 NHANES for this analysis.
NHANES, conducted by the CDC National
Center for Health Statistics (Hyattsville, MD),
is a multistage, stratified, clustered sample of the
civilian, noninstitutionalized U.S. population.
Data are acquired through standardized
examinations at mobile examination centers
throughout the United States, with 30 counties,
or groups of contiguous counties, surveyed
during each 2-year period. Certain subgroups
are sampled at a higher rate than other
demographic groups, including older adults,
Mexican Americans, non-Hispanic blacks,
and low-income persons. A CDC institutional
review board approved the study protocol, and
informed written consent was obtained from all
subjects. Detailed methods have been published
elsewhere (CDC 2008).
In NHANES 2003­2004, a random one-
third subsample of participants  6 years of
age (n = 2,567) was selected for urinary BPA
measurements. We excluded ages < 18 (34%)
because mean fasting times were substantially
shorter than those of adults, and because
adjustment for body mass index (BMI) is 
com-
plex in children and adolescents. We excluded
those  85 years of age (2%) to reduce 
pharma-
cokinetic variability and effects of comorbidity.
We also excluded participants who reported
fasting times > 24 hr (1%) to reduce regression
leverage of these fasting time outliers. This left
1,469 participants with complete data for the
measures described below.
Fasting time. Except for insulin-dependent
diabetics, all adults were asked to fast, although
failing to fast adequately (refusal or mistake)
did not disqualify participants. Appointment
slips, given to subjects in advance, indicated
that once fasting started, subjects should:
a) "not eat or drink anything except water"
and b) have "no coffee, tea, food, dietary sup-
plements, mints, cough drops, gum, snacks, or
beverages, and no nicotine for at least 3 hours"
(CDC 2004b). Participants who attended the
morning session were asked to fast 9.5 hr (over-
night). Afternoon and evening session subjects
were asked to fast 6 hr (CDC 2004a).
At each mobile examination center, phle-
botomists assessed subject fasting compliance.
Fasting time was calculated by CDC (in hours
and minutes) using the participant's response
at the time of blood and urine collection to
the question "When was the last time you ate
or drank anything other than plain water?"
(CDC 2006).
However, phlebotomists were also instructed
to consider consumption of "diet soda, black
coffee or tea with saccharine or Equal" as
equivalent to plain water, and thus these items
were permitted during "fasting." Subjects were
also asked whether, since fasting began, they
had consumed coffee/tea with cream/sugar,
alcohol, gum, mints, lozenges, cough drops,
antacids, laxatives, antidiarrheals, or dietary
supplements. Consumption of these items was
recorded, but without modifying the overall
fasting time (CDC 2004b).
BPA measurement. One spot urine sample
was collected from each participant and ana-
lyzed by CDC using HPLC and tandem mass
spectroscopy to determine BPA concentration
(sum of BPA parent compound plus conju-
gated metabolites; nanograms per milliliter).
Samples below the limit of detection (LOD;
0.4 ng/mL) were coded as LOD divided by the
square root of 2 (Calafat et al. 2008b).
Detailed BPA analysis methods have been
published, including the quality control sys-
tem that was used to prevent contamination
during collection, handling, and analysis of
samples (CDC 2007b).
We log-transformed BPA in regres-
sion analyses to normalize its distribution.
Differences in urine dilution were corrected
using urine creatinine. In regressions, this cor-
rection was performed by adding to the model
the function of urine creatinine that provided
the best model fit (urine creatinine and creati-
nine square root). For descriptive statistics, cre-
atinine-corrected BPA was calculated as BPA
divided by urine creatinine.
BPA levels by fasting hour. To estimate the
hour-by-hour trajectory of BPA in the popula-
tion, we fit linear regression models in which
fasting time was represented by 23 dummy vari-
ables, each representing a 1-hr interval from 1
to 24 hr with 0­1 hr as the reference group. To
plot these results, we used the regression model
to predict BPA by hour for a "standard person"
having the median of continuous variables and
mode of categorical variables. Because creati-
nine correction in our regressions was achieved
by including urine creatinine as a covariate,
the model predicts BPA rather than creatinine-
corrected BPA. Hence predicted BPA results
are given in nanograms per milli
liter rather than
micrograms per gram creatinine.
BPA population-based half-lives. Plots of
log concentration versus time are commonly
used to assess toxicant elimination in experi-
mental pharmacokinetic studies. Under first-
order kinetics, in which elimination rate is
proportional to internal concentration, the plot
of log concentration vs. time is a straight line
unless the toxicant distributes from a central
compartment (e.g., blood) to a peripheral com-
partment with a slower elimination rate (e.g.,
fat). The elimination half-life is computed as
­ln(2) divided by the slope (Shen 2007).
In our study, we adapted this approach to
a food-based population exposure by regressing
log BPA concentration against fasting time, in
which each data point represents an individual
participant. As in experimental kinetics, we
calculated the half-life as ­ln(2)/slope, except
that in our population-based approach, the
slope was represented by the fasting time coeffi-
cient from adjusted linear regressions described
below. We computed the 95% confidence
interval (CI) of the half-life from the lower and
upper bounds of the regression coefficient CI
in similar fashion (Bryan et al. 1990).
Because we are using pharmacokinetic con-
cepts in a nonstandard epidemiologic manner,
we wish to carefully distinguish between experi-
mentally determined kinetics and population-
based observations from which kinetics must be
inferred. To this end, we use the term "half-life"
in its conventional pharmacokinetic sense and
the term "population-based half-life" (pop½) for
derived kinetics seen in these population data.
In addition to examining the slope over
the entire fasting interval (0­24 hr), we also
subdivided this time period into three sub-
intervals. We selected cut points that would
maximize the slope of the regression line (e.g.,
result in the shortest pop½) during the period
when rapid excretion should be occurring. This
was done by fitting regressions to explore a
range of intervals from fasting time > 2­5 hr
to < 6­10 hr, in half-hour increments (e.g.,
2.5­8.5 hr, 3­8.5 hr, 4.5­9 hr, 4.5­9.5 hr).
The sharpest slope was found from 4.5­8.5
hr. We therefore defined the fasting hour
ranges used in our analyses as 0­4.5 (n = 129),
4.5­8.5 (n = 441), and 8.5­24 hr (n = 899).
Sensitivity analysis. Fasting time is an
important variable in this analysis, but is self-
reported. Intentional exaggeration of fasting
time could be a problem because subjects were
given incentives of $100 for adequate fasting
and $70 otherwise. We used serum glucose as
a means of identifying subjects at greatest risk
of fasting time exaggeration, and repeated our
pop½ analyses with these subjects excluded.
In subjects with normal glucose tolerance,
serum glucose should return to normal fasting
level (< 100 mg/dl) within 4­6 hours of eating
(Galgani et al. 2006), so we classified subjects
as at risk of exaggerated fasting time if they
reported fasting  4.5 hours and had a serum
glucose  100.
Because certain non-water dietary intake
was permitted after the start of fasting, we also
repeated pop½ analyses after identifying and
excluding subjects at risk of important "other-
than-water" consumption. We excluded sub-
jects who either a) reported consuming, after
fasting began, coffee/tea with cream/sugar,
alcohol, gum, mints, lozenges, cough drops,
antacids, laxatives, antidiarrheals, or dietary
supplements, or b) were most likely to have
consumed "diet soda, black coffee or tea with
saccharine or Equal." Group 1 was specifi-
cally recorded in the phlebotomy data and
easily excluded. Group 2, however, was not
recorded; therefore we used the 24-hr dietary

history to identify and exclude subjects who
consumed diet soda, coffee, or tea on the pre-
vious day (with or without sweeteners).
Statistical analysis. We performed mul-
tiple linear regression analyses, adjusted for
fasting time, urine creatinine, sex, age, race,
BMI, income, and examination session. Age
was computed as age in months divided by 12.
Race was categorized as Mexican American,
white, black, and other/mixed. Income was
represented by the poverty income ratio, the
ratio of family income to the poverty line,
adjusted for family size (continuous, minimum
= 0; top-coded at 5). The examination session
attended was coded as morning, afternoon, or
evening, with the exact time of visit omitted
by CDC to help ensure privacy. We also used
logistic regression, with covariates as above,
to identify predictors of low BPA levels (BPA
< LOD; n = 114) as well as the highest BPA
levels (BPA > 12 ng/mL; n = 115).
To assess the effects of hepatic and
renal function, we also repeated these
analyses, adding to the model the liver
enzyme -glutamyl transferase, and glomeru-
lar filtration rate, a measure of renal func-
tion. We estimated the glomerular filtration
rate using the four-variable equation from the
Modification of Diet in Renal Disease study
(Levey et al. 1999).
In complex surveys such as NHANES, sur-
vey design variables are available to enable an
analyst to make estimates consistent with those
that would result from a random sample of the
U.S. population (Lee and Forthofer 2005).
Sample weights adjust for oversampling and
survey imperfections such as nonresponse bias.
Survey cluster variables are used to account for
the multilevel sampling strategy, in which, for
instance, people from a given neighborhood
or county are expected to be more similar to
each other than to people from other parts of
the country.
In this study, we have omitted survey
design variables from our analyses because this
approach is most favorable to the standard view
of BPA as a rapidly cleared exposure. Survey
variables generally have the effect of increasing
standard errors and reducing power--in this
case, reduced power to detect a slope of BPA
concentration versus time that should be decid-
edly different from zero if the standard view is
correct. By choosing not to use the weights and
other design adjustments, we retain the sta-
tistical power found in a convenience sample
analysis, but lose the ability to generalize to the
U.S. population as a whole. Survey statisticians
have extensively debated under what condi-
tions survey design variables are required in
regression analyses (Lee and Forthofer 2005).
R (version 2.7.0) was the principal statisti-
cal system used in this study (R Development
Core Team 2008). Regression diagnostics were
performed with the "car" and "alr3" packages;
graphics were created using "ggplot2" (Fox
2008; Weisberg 2008; Wickham 2008). A
second analyst replicated key statistics inde-
pendently using SAS 9.1 (SAS Institute Inc.,
Cary, NC).
Results
Table 1 shows participant demographics by
fasting time interval for the 1,469 subjects. Of
these, 48 subjects (3.3%) reported consuming,
after fasting began, coffee/tea with cream/sugar,
alcohol, gum, mints, lozenges, cough drops,
antacids, laxatives, antidiarrheals, or dietary
supplements. The 24-hr dietary history identi-
fied 119 subjects (8.1%) who consumed diet
soft drinks the previous day, and 836 (56.9%)
who consumed coffee or tea. Together, there
were 920 (62.6%) potential "other-than-water"
dietary consumers during fasting.

BPA population-based half-life in NHANES
Environmental Health Perspectives · volume 117 | number 5 | May 2009 787
Unadjusted BPA levels vary minimally
by fasting time. Table 2 shows unweighted
median urinary BPA concentrations, by sub-
group, corrected for (i.e., divided by) urine
crea
tinine. Overall, a small decline is seen
between 0­4.5 hr and the later fasting time
periods (analysis of variance on log-transformed
means; p = 0.046). Figure 1 is a scatterplot of
BPA versus fasting time. Wide scatter is evident
without clear trends. The creatinine-corrected
scatterplot is similar (not shown).
BPA kinetics suggested by adjusted models.
Figure 2 shows BPA (ln) versus fasting hour,
as determined by adjusted linear regression.
Individual points were predicted from the
regression model using a "standard person"
having the median of continuous variables and
mode of categorical variables--which for these
data was a 44-year-old white female from the
morning session with poverty income ratio = 2.1,
BMI = 27, and urine creatinine = 122 mg/dL.
Table 3 shows the results of the pop½
regressions, accompanied by an example
calculation. The pop½ over the 0­24 hr
interval was 43 hr (95% CI, 26 to 119, p =
0.002). When regressions were stratified by
fasting time intervals, substantial differences
in pop½ were seen. For individuals who fasted
0­4.5 hr, the slope was essentially zero, yielding
a pop½ of 418 hr (95% CI, 4.7 to ­4.8 hr,
p = 0.98). A nonsignificant trend was also seen
in the interval from 8.5 to 24 hours (pop½
= 38 hr; 95% CI, 17 to ­225 hr; p = 0.09).
However, for those fasting 4.5­8.5 hr there was
a sharp decline in BPA concentration over the
period (pop½ = 4.1 hr; 95% CI, 2.6 to 10.6 hr;
p = 0.001). Adding gamma-glutamyl transferase
and glomerular filtration rate to these models
had minimal, nonsignificant effects (results not
shown). As shown in Table 3, results did not
change substantially after excluding fasting sub-
jects with higher than expected serum glucose,
or subjects at risk of "other-than-water" dietary
consumption during fasting.
When predictions for the "standard per-
son" were made from a regression over the
interval from 4.5 hr (peak) to 24 hr, the BPA
level at 4.5 hr was 4.04 ng/mL and at 24 hr
was 3.05 ng/mL--a decline of 25% over
19.5 hr. When predictions were made using
the peak and trough values taken from Figure
2, the levels declined 46% over 17 hr--from
the peak of 4.59 ng/mL at 4­5 hr (n = 21) to
a trough of 2.48 ng/mL at 21­22 hr (n = 19).
BPA extremes not predicted by fasting
time. "BPA < limit of detection" was not
predicted by fasting time [odds ratio (OR)
= 1.03; 95% CI, 0.98 to 1.09; p = 0.28].
Significant predictors were increasing age
(continuous years; OR = 1.02; 95% CI, 1.01
to 1.03; p = 0.003), race, and urine creatinine.
Whites were less likely to be below the LOD
than Mexican Americans (OR = 0.38; 95%
CI, 0.21­0.69; p = 0.001).
"BPA > 12 ng/mL" was not predicted by
fasting time (OR = 0.97; 95% CI, 0.93 to
1.01; p = 0.15). Significant predictors were
female sex (OR = 1.8; 95% CI, 1.2 to 2.8;
p = 0.005), income (higher income less likely;
OR = 0.86; 95% CI, 0.75 to 0.99; p = 0.03),
and urine creatinine. When only considering
long fasting subjects (8.5­24 hr), and excluding
at risk subjects as previously described, 7.5% of
participants had a BPA level > 12 ng/mL, with
a maximum of 80.1 ng/mL.
Discussion
In these NHANES data, the population-
based half-life is much longer than expected
based on published acute exposure studies.
Regressions demonstrate a strong BPA decline
in the 4.5­8.5 hr interval, possibly represent-
ing an initial elimination phase subsequent to
oral intake. However, from 8.5 to 24 hr, the
slope is essentially flat, so pop½ is very long.
The relationship between fasting time
and the highest BPA levels (12­80 ng/mL)
was weak, and high levels were seen in some
long-fasting subjects. Even when restricted to
participants fasting 8.5­24 hr, and excluding
at risk subjects as previously described, 7.5%
of participants had a BPA level > 12 ng/mL.
These results are substantially greater than the
national median (2.7 ng/mL) determined by
Calafat et al. (2008b), and suggest the possi-
bility of important non
food exposure.

Non
food exposures have been described.
Yamamoto et al. (2000), for example, found
substantial migration of BPA from PVC hoses
into room temperature water. BPA migration
produced substantial BPA levels within 24 hr
(median 329 ng/mL). Because PVC pipe is
approved for use in residential water supply
lines in many cities, BPA exposure from this
source (by ingestion or inhalation) deserves
investigation. A sizable fraction of this BPA
would be chlorinated, however (Yamamoto and
Yasuhara 2002). Chlorinated BPA species were
not measured in NHANES 2003­2004 (CDC
2007a) or in the children´s study by Wilson
et al. (Wilson N, personal 
communication).
BPA has also been measured in recycled
and carbonless copy paper (Ozaki et al. 2004).
Reviews by Kang et al. (2006) and Vandenberg
et al. (2007) describe other potential sources,
such as dental sealants, dust, air, sewage
effluents, and landfill leachates.
Although acute, single-dose human
experiments give compelling evidence that most
BPA is rapidly excreted, frequent exposures
could result in accumulation if BPA distributes
to tissues that release BPA slowly. The log of the
BPA octanol­water partition coefficient (Kow
)
has been estimated at 2.2­3.82 (NTP 2008).
Thus BPA is lipophilic and could potentially
accumulate in fat or other lipid-rich tissues.
BPA levels in fat have been reported. In
chronically exposed rodents, Nunez and col-
leagues (2001) found BPA levels 8­10 times
higher in brown fat than in serum. In women,
Fernandez et al. (2007) measured BPA in adi-
pose tissue and found, for all subjects, a mean
of 3.2 ng BPA/g fat and 8.2 ng chlorinated
BPA/g fat. Olea et al. (2008) found substan-
tially greater levels in children. Their mean levels
for all subjects were 10.7 ng BPA/g fat and 19.4
chlorinated BPA ng/g fat (Olea N, personal
communication). The BPA concentrations
from these human studies are much greater
than those recently shown to reduce the pro-
duction of adiponectin in human adipose tissue
explants (Hugo et al. 2008). Low adiponectin
has been correlated with insulin resistance and
vascular inflammatory states (Hajer et al. 2008),
whereas total urine BPA (BPA and conjugated
metabolites) has been correlated with cardio-
vascular disease and diabetes (Lang et al. 2008).
Thus BPA accumulation in fat, if common,
could have important health implications.
Our analysis has several limitations: exclu-
sion of children and the very elderly, self-
reported fasting time, non-use of complex
survey variables, and the question of BPA
contamination or measurement error.
Because we limited our examination to adults
18­85 years of age, these results do not necessar-
ily apply to children or to those > 85 years of
age. Although neonates have some capacity to
metabolize BPA (Calafat et al. 2008a), neonates
and young infants have immature glucuronida-
tion capacity generally (Alcorn and McNamara
2003), which is the primary means by which
humans metabolize BPA. In the elderly, changes
in body composition and a decline in renal
function may affect volume of distribution and
excretion rates (Turnheim 2003).
The accuracy of self-reported fasting time
appears acceptable. Results did not change
substantially after excluding fasting subjects
with higher than expected serum glucose (i.e.,
risk of fasting time exaggeration), or those at
risk of "other-than-water" dietary BPA expo-
sure during fasting. Although subjects who
reported adequate fasting were compensated
$30 more than those who did not, "adequate"
fasting was defined as 9.5 hr for the morning
examination session and 6 hr for the afternoon
and evening sessions. Because longer fasting
times than these provided no additional com-
pensation, we do not believe intentional exag-
geration is a satisfactory explanation of our
results beyond these fasting time minimums.
Because we did not use complex sur-
vey variables in our primary analyses, these
results cannot be precisely generalized to the
entire U.S. population. However, because we
adjusted for the demographic covariates related
to oversampling, the complex survey analy-
sis method proposed by Korn and Graubard
(1991) would produce regression coefficients
(and thus population-based half-lives) very sim-
ilar to ours. The difference is that their method,
like other such survey methods, increases the
standard errors and would make it more dif-
ficult to detect a BPA decline with slope dif-
ferent from zero. Our smaller standard errors
are thus more similar to those found in typical
cross-sectional studies, except that NHANES

aSample calculation: 0­24 hr fasting interval for all participants. The adjusted regression gave a fasting time beta ("slope") of ­0.0162 (95% CI, ­0.0267 to ­0.0058). The pop½ =
­ln(2)/­0.0162 = 42.7 hrs. Lower bound of the 95% CI, ­ln(2)/ ­0.0267 = 26.0 hr; upper bound of the 95% CI, ­ln(2)/ ­0.0058 = 119.5 hr. As slope goes to zero, pop½ goes to infinity (i.e., BPA
level is constant). A positive slope (increasing BPA with time) translates to "doubling time" and a negative pop½. Minor inconsistencies between slopes and population-based half-lives
are attributable to rounding. bExcludes participants who reported consuming coffee/tea with cream/sugar, alcohol, gum, mints, lozenges, cough drops, antacids, laxatives, antidiarrhe-
als, or dietary supplements after "fasting" began (n = 48) or those who consumed diet soft drinks, coffee, or tea the previous day, and were therefore at higher risk of consuming these
items during "fasting" (n = 920). Some subjects are in both groups. cExcludes participants with glucose  100 mg/dL if fasting time  4.5 hr. dFasting time beta coefficient (estimate) in the

BPA population-based half-life in NHANES

sampling procedures and geographic coverage
are superior.
We do not suspect substantive BPA con-
tamination or measurement error, because CDC
methods include a substantial quality control com-
ponent (CDC 2007b). NHANES 2003­2004
procedures did not include the use of field blanks
(Calafat A, personal communication), but we
believe contamination during collection was
unlikely because a) 6.5% of samples were below
the LOD, which argues against systematic error
across the entire sample, and b) BPA extremes
were associated with sex, race, age, and income,
which argues against substantial random error.
Although we used pharmacokinetic con-
cepts to assess BPA elimination in the popu
lation, continued non
food exposure could
completely obscure rapid clearance kinetics.
Therefore the pop½ values obtained here should
not be taken as true elimination half-lives, but
as a method of quantifying the fact that BPA is,
unexpectedly, still present despite extended fast-
ing by many NHANES participants.
More precisely, the concept of a population-
based half-life may be useful because the decline
in population levels after termination of an
exposure should match, at least grossly, the rate
predicted by current exposure and pharma-
cokinetic assumptions. Population-based half-
life could be inflated by measurement error in
population data, and its variance by differences
in exposure. Nevertheless, a large discordance
between the measured population-based rate
and the rate predicted by current assumptions
may be a clue that the assumptions are either
incomplete or incorrect. Although, in our study,
we used this approach to examine a food-based
exposure, it could also be applicable whenever a
significant population exposure can be abruptly
terminated, such as when a pesticide is banned.
Risk assessments for BPA have been based
in part on evidence that food is the primary,
and almost exclusive, exposure source, and that
rapid and complete BPA elimination occurs after
exposure (European Chemicals Bureau 2003;
European Food Safety Authority 2006; NTP
2008). The persistence of population BPA levels
despite extended fasting appears to contradict
this evidence. Research to resolve this contradic-
tion could include experimental pharmaco
kinetic
studies of chronic BPA exposure, continued
search for important non
food sources, and fur-
ther investigation of BPA in human adipose tis-
sue and its effects on adipokine production. If
such studies confirm that either or both of the
base assumptions are flawed, risk assessments for
BPA will require reevaluation.
