Offenders: Preliminary
Evidence on Group Subtypes
Violet Lai1, Gerald Zeng2, and Chi Meng Chu2
Abstract
Youth violence is a costly social problem. This study compared the risk and needs of nonviolent
youth offenders, with those who had committed violent offenses only (violent only) and those who
had committed violent and nonviolent offenses (violent plus) to determine whether violent youth
were a different ``type'' from nonviolent youth. The case files of 3,744 youth offenders (3,327 males
and 417 females, between 12 and 18 years old) were retrospectively coded, before official recidivism
records were obtained. Multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA), w2, and Cox regressions were
conducted. Violent-plus youth were younger; higher in their total risk and all criminogenic needs;
more likely to have several noncriminogenic needs; and at higher risk of any reoffending, violent
reoffending, and nonviolent reoffending than nonviolent youth. Violent-only youth had the same
total risk and risk of general and violent recidivism as nonviolent offenders but presented different
criminogenic and noncriminogenic needs and risk of nonviolent recidivism. Compared to violent-
only youth, violent-plus youth were younger, had higher total risk and criminogenic needs on five
domains, were more likely to have several noncriminogenic needs, and were at higher risk of all
types of reoffending (except sexual reoffending), suggesting subtypes of violent youth offenders. The
implication is that nonviolent and violent youth offenders require different dosage and types of
intervention.

Introduction
Youth violence is one of the most prominent social problems (Davies & Pearson, 1999; Mercy,
Butchart, Farrington, & Cerda, 2002). Studies in United States and United Kingdom estimated that
the tangible and intangible costs of violent crimes, which include those committed by youth,
amounted to billions per year (Institute for Economics & Peace, 2013; Shapiro & Hassett, 2012).

Notwithstanding the volatility of youth violence trends (Butts & Snyder, 2006; Cook & Laub, 2002),
the substantial costs of each violent act (McCollister, French, & Fang, 2010) confirm that violent
offending by youth requires attention. By virtue of their young age, persistent violent offending
by youth can result in longer term costs and potentially be more damaging when compared to adult
violence. For the above-mentioned reasons, a better understanding of youth violence is critical for
advancing prevention and intervention efforts.
Typological Distinction Between Violent and Nonviolent Youth Offenders
Offender typology involves classifying offenders into theoretically meaningful or practical cate-
gories, on the basis that not all offenders are the same (Clements, 1996; Moffitt, 1993). Although
the development of reliable and valid offender typologies has its challenges (Byrne & Roberts,
2007), offender categories are still useful in understanding offending behavior and in predicting
reoffending (Schmidt, Campbell, & Houlding, 2011). It has also been successfully applied in offen-
der treatment and management, for example, a meta-analysis showed that matching the intensity of
treatment programs to offenders' risk categories was effective in reducing recidivism (Andrews &
Dowden, 2006).
There is a substantial volume of past research on typologies of delinquents (see brief review by
Loeber, Farrington, & Waschbusch, 1998). In particular, Loeber and colleagues examined a group of
young offenders termed as ``serious violent juvenile offenders.'' By identifying their unique risk and
protective factors, developmental trajectories, and criminal careers, from longitudinal studies using
self-reports and official records, their research put forward violent delinquents as a category separate
from general delinquency (Loeber & Farrington, 1998).
Recent research has continued to uncover evidence for a violent group of youth offenders, across
different operationalization of violent behavior, some of which included combinations with other
offense types (e.g., violent substance abuser) and offender characteristics (e.g., violent chronic
offender). Using a large, representative sample of 18,614 adolescents, Vaughn, Salas-Wright,
DeLisi, and Maynard (2014) identified a severe 5% group who not only showed higher levels of vio-
lence but also higher levels of substance abuse, and other delinquency behaviors. Baglivio, Jack-
owski, and Greenwald (2014) used an actuarial risk assessment instrument to characterize serious
violent chronic (SVC) youth offenders and found that their reoffending was predicted by a different
set of risk and protective factors compared to the non-SVC youth offenders. Another study found
that the risk factors that predicted the severity of reoffending were different for serious violent offen-
ders, violent property offenders, property offenders, and sex offenders (Mulder, Vermunt, Brand,
Bullens, & Van Marle, 2012). These studies were conducted in Western countries, with majority
of the samples comprising youth of non-Asian descent.
Although there are overlaps across cultures on their definitions of criminal behavior, the devel-
opment of deviant behaviors can differ due to cultural norms, morals, religion, taboos, and expec-
tations (e.g., Bhugra, Popelyuk, & McMullen, 2010; Lahlah, Van der Knaap, Bogaerts, & Lens,
2013). For example, studies showed that cultural factors are related to the risk and protective factors
of violent offending (e.g., Flanagan et al., 2011; Soriano, Rivera, Williams, Daley, & Reznik, 2004).
Given the lack of research on violent typology among Asian youth offenders, it is useful to examine
the dichotomy of violent and nonviolent offenders along with the risk and needs associated with each
group in this population.
The distinction between violent and nonviolent offenders has important practical implications for
law enforcers and rehabilitation practitioners in Singapore and other Asian contexts. If the previous
finding that violent offenders are a more severe group compared to nonviolent offenders is replicated
(e.g., Baglivio, Jackowski, & Greenwald, 2014; Mulder et al., 2012), it warrants a sharper demarca-
tion in intensity of treatment and amount of resources allocated between these two groups.

Subtypes of Violent Youth Offenders
Loeber and Stouthamer-Loeber (1998) postulated that youth who are on the overt developmental
pathway will show progression specialized in aggression and violence. In addition, some youth can
be on multiple pathways, such as both the overt and the covert pathways (covert pathway involves
concealing behaviors such as burglary and theft) or move between pathways (Loeber & Hay, 1994).
This suggests a subtype specializing in violent offending and a subtype that is versatile, engaging in
both violent and nonviolent offending.
With regard to the specialization/versatility of violent delinquents, the extant criminal career lit-
erature presents a mixed picture. The question of whether there is specialization in particular types of
offending behavior is important because it determines whether specificity is needed in rehabilitation
(e.g., targeted treatment and selective detention). Although many researchers had strongly purported
that youth offending is predominantly versatile (e.g., Brame, Mulvey, Piquero, & Schubert, 2014;
Farrington, Synder, & Finnegan, 1988; Piquero, 2000), there has also been evidence of specializa-
tion in violence (e.g., Besemer, 2012; Osgood & Schrek, 2007; Thomas, 2013). Resolution of the
contrasting literature has been difficult, due to the lack of agreement about the definition of specia-
lization and shortcomings in methods of analyzing for the presence of specialization (e.g., Baker,
Metacalfe, & Jennings, 2013; Osgood & Schrek, 2007; Thomas, 2013). An even more complex pic-
ture has emerged, with research showing that specialization/versatility can vary across individual
characteristics such as peer influence and marriage (McGloin, Sullivan, Piquero, & Pratt, 2007; Tho-
mas, 2015) or situational variables such as alcohol influence (McGloin et al., 2007). Therefore, crim-
inal career research and the closely related field of offender typology have to examine
specialization/versatility further.
The question of specialization can also be addressed by testing for profile differences between
youth offenders categorized as specialized violent offenders and those categorized as versatile vio-
lent offenders. The reasoning is that if different profiles are observed, then there is evidence for a
specialized group and a versatile group. This simple approach may provide a less ambiguous set
of findings on the existence of specialization, to augment criminal career research. Subtypes of vio-
lent offenders have not received much attention in typology studies and have been examined in only
a handful of studies (Colins, Vermeiren, Schuyten, & Broekaert, 2009; Mulder et al., 2012; Smart
et al., 2003; Vaughn, Salas-Wright, DeLisi, & Maynard, 2014). Generally, versatile violent youth
offenders have a greater number of risk factors compared to specialized violent youth offenders
(Smart et al., 2003; Vaughn et al., 2014). Even fewer studies have gone beyond risk factors to exam-
ine recidivism of the groups. For example, Mulder and colleagues found that versatile violent youth
offenders have higher recidivism compared to the violence specialists. None of the studies used
actuarial risk assessment tools to characterize the groups.
Risk and Criminogenic Needs
One practical framework which can be used to examine violent offender typology is the risk, need,
and responsivity (RNR) framework (Andrews, Bonta, & Hoge, 1990) considering its utility in offen-
der rehabilitation (see meta-analyses by Andrews et al., 1990; Hanson, Bourgon, Helmus, & Hodg-
son, 2009). The RNR framework and its actuarial risk assessment tool, Youth Level of Service/Case
Management Inventory (YLS/CMI), have previously been used in studies examining heterogeneity
in other offender types, such as youth sex offenders (Zeng, Chu, Koh, & Teoh, 2015) and gang and
nongang affiliated youth offenders (Chu, Daffern, Thomas, & Lim, 2012).
The RNR framework rests on three core tenets: (i) the intensity of the intervention should match
the level of risk, (ii) criminogenic needs that are malleable should be targeted to reduce the risk of
reoffending, and (iii) intervention delivery should be tailored according to an offender's learning
Lai et al. 315
style and abilities for higher responsivity (Andrews et al., 1990). Identification of risk level and rel-
evant criminogenic needs associated with each offender subtype informs the type and level of inter-
vention needed (Clements, 1996). It is also useful to examine noncriminogenic needs, which have
implications for the tailoring of interventions to ensure responsivity.
Juvenile Justice in Singapore
Singapore is an independent island state in South East Asia with a population of 5.5 million
(Singapore Department of Statistics, 2015). Many statutes are based on the English common law
(e.g., the Criminal Procedure Code, 2012), but there are some statutes that are based on legislation
from other jurisdictions; for example, the Penal Code (2008) is based on the Indian Penal Code,
which was (nonetheless) first formulated by the English. As such, there are similarities in the way
that offenses are defined when compared with the above-mentioned countries. Pertaining to crime
statistics, youth arrests account for about 10% of all arrests in Singapore (Singapore Police Force,
2015).
Not all young offenders who commit offenses are charged in the juvenile court (Ministry of
Social & Family Development, 2014). In line with a graduated approach in juvenile justice, first-
time offenders who have committed minor crimes may be placed on diversionary programs. For
those who are charged and convicted by the court, they may be required to undergo community reha-
bilitation which often includes probation or required to reside in a Juvenile Rehabilitation Centre
(custodial facility for youth offenders) for a period of time.
In the early 2000s, there was a collective move by the youth and adult correctional services
toward using structured and empirically informed approach to assess youth offenders' risk and
needs. The RNR framework was introduced to provide a theoretical and empirical-based approach
to conduct offender assessment and rehabilitation. The YLS/CMI, and subsequently the YLS/CMI
2.0, was chosen as the primary risk assessment measure to assess the risk and needs of youth offen-
ders (J. R. Chua, Chu, Yim, Chong, & Teoh, 2014). Within the Singaporean context, YLS/CMI 2.0's
coding criteria and cutoffs for risk categories were modified and developed, respectively, for asses-
sing the local youth offenders and in accordance with the local legislation and procedures.
Present Study
This study compared nonviolent youth offenders with violent youth offenders who had committed
violent offenses only (violent only) and who had committed both violent and nonviolent offenses
(violent plus) on YLS/CMI total risk scores, criminogenic and noncriminogenic needs, and risk
of recidivism. In addition to overall recidivism, common forms of recidivism, violent, nonviolent,
and sexual were examined. The aim was to determine whether violent youth were a different type
from nonviolent youth based on differences in risk levels, rehabilitation needs, and reoffending pat-
terns. By further differentiating violent youth, this study also explored whether there were subtypes
of violent youth offenders (i.e., a specialized group and a versatile group).
Based on previous findings of a higher risk profile of violent offenders in contrast with nonvio-
lent offenders (e.g., Baglivio et al, 2014; Mulder et al., 2012), it was hypothesized that violent
youth offenders (i.e., violent only and violent plus) would have higher YLS/CMI risk scores and
criminogenic needs, higher frequency of noncriminogenic needs, and higher risk of reoffending as
compared to nonviolent youth offenders. However, the pattern of differences in risk and needs
between violent only and nonviolent youth and between violent plus and nonviolent youth were
expected to differ (Mulder et al., 2012; Vaughn et al., 2014). This study also sought to examine
the hypothesis that violent-only youth offenders would differ from violent-plus youth offenders
on risk and needs.

Method
Participants
The sample comprised of 3,744 youth who were charged with criminal offenses between January
2004 and December 2008 and were referred to the Ministry of Social and Family Development for
either probation within the community or residence at a Juvenile Rehabilitation Centre (custodial
facility for youth offenders). This sample represented 96.9% (3,264 of 3,370) of the youth on proba-
tion and 99.0% (480 of 485) of youth under custodial orders for that period of time; the remaining
cases could not be coded as a result of missing information or file retrieval difficulties. There were
3,327 males (88.9%) and 417 females (11.1%) who were between 12 and 18 years old at the point of
referral (M Â¼ 15.31, SD Â¼ 1.21).
As this study was specifically interested in violent nonsexual offenders (who are typologically
different from sexual offenders; e.g., Craig, Browne, Beech, & Stringer, 2006; Van Wijk et al.,
2006), 2.3% (87 of 3,744) of the sample who had committed sexual offenses were excluded.
In terms of index offenses committed, 67.1% (2,454 of 3,657) had committed nonviolent offenses
only, 19.9% (727 of 3,657) had committed violent offenses only, and 13.0% (476 of 3,657) had com-
mitted both nonviolent and violent offenses. A small proportion, 2.4% (89 of 3,657), had records of
prior offenses, while 10.9% (399 of 3,657) had subsequently breached their probation or custodial
orders.
Procedure
Approval for the study was obtained from the Ministry of Social and Family Development before
commencing with data collection. Two psychologists, one probation officer, and five research
assistants reviewed and coded participants' case files retrospectively, between January 2011 and
September 2012. The case files were obtained from the Ministry of Social and Family Develop-
ment and consisted of (a) psychological reports, (b) presentence reports, (c) charge sheets, (d)
statement of facts, (e) any previous assessment and treatment reports, and (d) school reports. Psy-
chological and presentence reports contained detailed information pertaining to several key areas:
personal, family, psychiatric, and criminal offending histories as well as the current offending
behaviors and risk management issues. Prior to the study, the raters had completed a 3-day training
by accredited trainers on administering YLS/CMI. They were also briefed on the procedures in
reviewing and coding the case files.
Disagreements in coding were resolved through discussions. Interrater reliability for YLS/CMI
ratings was assessed by the raters separately coding a random sample of 31 files. The intraclass cor-
relation coefficient (ICC) for single rater (using absolute agreement definition; ICC) was .63 (good)
for the YLS/CMI total score (see Cicchetti & Sparrow, 1981, for classification of ICCs). The ICCs
for the eight domains were .43 (fair) for prior or current offenses/dispositions, .50 (fair) for family
circumstances/parenting, .60 (good) for education/employment, .50 (fair) for peer relations, .49
(fair) for substance abuse, .45 (fair) for leisure/recreation, .55 (fair) for personality/behavior, and
.48 (fair) for attitudes/orientation.
Measures
Offender group. Our study adopted Farrington's (1998) definition for violent acts, which is behavior
intended to cause, or intended to and actually causes injury. Youth were categorized as nonviolent
offenders if their index offenses comprised only offenses without the intent to cause injury, such as
theft, fraud, and drug use. Those who had committed violent offenses exclusively, such as physical
assault, rioting, and robbery, were categorized as violent-only offenders. Violence against animals or
Lai et al. 317
property was not included (Farrington, 1998). None of the youth were convicted of family violence.
Those who had committed both violent and nonviolent offenses were categorized as violent-plus
offenders.
Risk and criminogenic needs. The localized version of YLS/CMI 2.0 was used to code for YLS/CMI
total risk scores, which is the risk of reoffending and the eight criminogenic needs (prior or current
offenses/dispositions, family circumstances/parenting, education/employment, peer relations, sub-
stance abuse, leisure/recreation, personality/behavior, and attitudes/orientation). A total of 42
items on the domains prior or current offenses/dispositions (e.g., ``three or more prior convictions''),
family circumstances/parenting (e.g., ``inadequate supervision''), education/employment (e.g., ``low
achievement''), peer relations (e.g., ``some delinquent friends''), substance abuse (e.g., ``chronic
drug use''), leisure/recreation (e.g., ``could make better use of time''), personality/behavior (e.g.,
``physically aggressive''), and attitudes/orientation (e.g., ``antisocial/procriminal attitudes'') were
rated as either yes or no. The total number of endorsed items on each domain reflects the level of
domain-specific criminogenic needs. The YLS/CMI total risk scores were computed by summing
up the domain scores. Previous meta-analyses showed that the YLS/CMI assessment ratings had
modest to moderate predictive validity (see Olver, Stockdale, & Wormith, 2009; Schwalbe, 2007,
for reviews). It also had moderate predictive validity for use in the Singaporean context (Chu
et al., 2015). There have been fewer studies on the reliability of YLS/CMI, but there is evidence
of fair to excellent interrater reliability of the domain scores and total score (Rocque & Plummer-
Beale, 2014; Schmidt, Hoge, & Gomes, 2005).
Noncriminogenic needs. The YLS/CMI assessment also has a 51-item section that assesses the presence
of noncriminogenic needs for individualized intervention (Andrews et al., 1990); items are rated as
``yes'' or ``no.'' Only the following items were coded as the required information was consistently col-
lected and recorded in the reports: chronic history of offenses, financial/accommodation problems,
history of bullying, history of running away, history of sexual/physical assault, peers outside age
range, poor problem solving skills, poor social skills, underachievement, and gang membership.
Age at first charge. Age of the youth at first charge was derived using birth date and date of the first
court charge.
Recidivistic outcomes. Recidivism data were obtained only after the completion of coding of all the
other variables. The cutoff date for recidivism was April 20, 2011. The youth was considered to have
general recidivism, if there had been either a conviction of any offense, violent, sexual, nonviolent,
or other types of offenses, following the initial court order, or a breach of court orders. Violent reci-
divism (e.g., physical assault, rioting, and robbery), nonviolent recidivism (e.g., theft, fraud, and drug
use), and sexual recidivism (e.g., indecent exposure, molestation, and peeping) were also measured.
Statistical Analyses
All analyses were conducted using SPSS version 19.0. Comparisons were made between violent-
only and violent-plus groups and the reference group, nonviolent. Comparisons were also made
between violent-only and violent-plus groups. Continuous dependent variables were analyzed using
MANOVA, followed by univariate tests with adjustment of Type I error using Benjamini and Hoch-
berg's procedure (1995). This procedure of adjustment for false discovery rate (FDR) is more pow-
erful than adjustment for familywise error rates. Following significant univariate tests, post hoc
comparisons were conducted using Hochberg's GT2 to control for Type I error (Field, 2013). Cate-
gorical dependent variables were analyzed using w2, likewise with the control of FDR.

To analyze whether group membership predicted differences in general recidivism, and specific
types of recidivism, Cox regressions were conducted, which can account for differences in follow-up
period for recidivism among the youth.
Results
Descriptives
Table 1 details the breakdown of the nonviolent, violent-only, and violent-plus groups by sex, ethni-
city, current offense(s), and recidivism. The nonviolent group committed 2.84 offenses on average,
while the violent-only group committed 1.54 violent offenses on average; the violent-plus group com-
mitted 2.74 nonviolent offenses on average and 1.62 violent offenses on average. The mean follow-up
period for recidivism was 1,425 days (median Â¼ 1,382, SD Â¼ 668, range Â¼ 8Â­2,666).
Group Differences in Risk and Criminogenic Needs
Table 2 displays the means and standard deviations of the nonviolent, violent-only, and violent-plus
groups on the YLS/CMI. An MANOVA was conducted with group as the independent variable, and
scores of the YLS/CMI (total and domain), and age at first charged offense as dependent variables,
to explore for differences between the three groups. There was a main effect of group type on the

Finally, youth in the violent-plus group were rated significantly higher than violent-only youth
for the domains of prior and current offenses/dispositions, family circumstances/parenting, educa-

Additionally, youth in the violent-plus group were younger at the age of first charge than those in

Group Differences in Noncriminogenic Needs
Group comparisons for noncriminogenic needs were also carried out using Pearson's w2 tests. Three
tests were conducted to compare (a) the nonviolent and violent-only groups, (b) the nonviolent and
violent-plus groups, and (c) the violent-only and violent-plus groups.

From Table 3, after FDR adjustments, results indicated that violent-only youth were more likely
than nonviolent youth to have histories of sexual/physical assault (OR Â¼ 2.22, p < .001), poor
problem-solving skills (OR Â¼ 1.50, p < .001), and be a gang member (OR Â¼ 1.87, p < .001).
From Table 4, violent-plus youth were more likely than nonviolent youth to have had histories of
bullying (OR Â¼ 1.65, p < .001) and sexual/physical assault (OR Â¼ 2.28, p < .001). Violent-plus
youth were also more likely to have poor problem-solving skills (OR Â¼ 1.76, p < .001) and be a gang
member (OR Â¼ 2.55, p < .001).
Finally, violent-plus youth were more likely than violent-only youth to have histories of bullying
(OR Â¼ 1.79, p Â¼ .002) and running away (OR Â¼ 1.66, p Â¼ .002; see Table 5). They were also more
likely to have familial financial/accommodation difficulties (OR Â¼ 1.44, p Â¼ .012) and gang mem-
bership (OR Â¼ 1.36, p Â¼ .010).

[1.28, 2.11], p < .001), and nonviolently (HR Â¼ 1.36 times, 95% CI [1.17, 1.58], p < .001). They were
also more likely than violent-only youth to reoffend generally (HR Â¼ 1.59, 95% CI [1.33, 1.90], p <

[1.39, 2.04], p < .001). Violent-only youth were less likely than nonviolent youth to commit nonviolent
(HR Â¼ 0.81, 95% CI [0.69, 0.94], p Â¼ .005) reoffending. There were no significant differences between
violent-only and nonviolent youth in their likelihood of general and violent reoffending.

hypothesis that violent-only youth offenders and violent-plus youth offenders were distinct types.

assault) and poor problem-solving skills. Violent-plus youth were also more likely to be involved in
gangs than their nonviolent counterparts. These findings are in line with literature showing differ-
ences in the risk factors for violent youth vis-a
`-vis nonviolent youth and associations between risk
factors and violence (Baglivio et al., 2014; Mulder et al., 2012; Valois, MacDonald, Bretous,
Fischer, & Drane, 2002; Zhou et al., 2014). The findings on total risk scores and recidivistic out-
comes also parallel findings of higher risk scores and reoffending behavior in previous studies
(Baglivio et al., 2014; Chu et al., 2012; Mulder et al., 2012).
Likewise, violent-only and nonviolent youth had differing risk and needs, and risk of nonviolent
recidivism, though there were fewer number of differences compared to the comparisons of violent-
plus and nonviolent youth. The consistent differences between the nonviolent youth and the two var-
iants of violent youth on a number of profile characteristics suggest that it is valid to distinguish
youth offenders on the basis of whether they offended violently. The findings offer additional evi-
dence for violent offender types (Loeber & Farrington, 1998; Loeber & Stouthamer-Loeber, 1998)
and the premise that offenders are heterogeneous (Clements, 1996; Moffitt, 1993) in a culturally dis-
tinctive, non-Western youth offender sample. Beyond profile differences, the findings also imply
that the level of effective dosage and the appropriate targets of intervention vary between violent
and nonviolent youth offenders. For example, in line with the risk principle of RNR (Andrews
et al., 1990), the intensity of intervention to reduce reoffending among violent-plus youth should
be higher relative to that needed for nonviolent youth. According to the need principle, intervention
to address pertinent criminogenic needs should reduce negative peer influence for violent-only
youth but not for nonviolent youth.
Subtypes of Violent Youth Offenders
There is preliminary evidence for subtypes of violent youth offenders. The pattern of differences in
the comparisons between violent-only and nonviolent youth and between violent-plus and nonvio-
lent youth was largely dissimilar. The only parallels were higher needs on the peer relations and per-
sonality/behavior domains and higher likelihood of being involved in gangs, having poor problem-
solving skills, and history of sexual/physical assault.

More importantly, differences were found in the direct comparisons between the violent-plus and
the violent-only groups. Violent-plus youth had higher total risk scores and criminogenic needs on
five domains and were at higher risk of general, violent, and nonviolent reoffending. No differences
were observed for sexual reoffending (like what was found for comparisons between these two
groups and nonviolent youth), which is not surprising, given the overall low base rate of sexual reof-
fending in this sample. Furthermore, low rates of sexual reoffending have been found among Sin-
gaporean youth offenders, even for youth who have sexually offended (Zeng, Chu, & Lee, 2015).
Violent-plus youth were also more likely to have history of delinquent behavior (i.e., running away),
history of aggression (i.e., bullying), and be involved in gangs. These findings are significant
because (i) it confirms the typology literature on violent subtypes (Loeber & Stouthamer-Loeber,
1998, Mulder et al., 2012; Smart et al., 2003; Vaughn et al., 2014) and (ii) it provides evidence for
specialization in violent offending behavior (Besemer, 2012; Osgood & Schrek, 2007; Thomas,
2013). It is also interesting that profile differences in line with what past studies have found between
groups constructed from delinquent records accumulated over a duration of delinquent careers
(Smart et al., 2003; Vaughn et al., 2014) were observed between groups comprising mostly of
first-time offenders. This raises the possibility that specialized violent offenders and versatile violent
offenders may be identified as early as at the point of their first convictions.
Overall, violent-plus youth, or the criminally versatile, appear to be the most high-risk offender
type among the three groups. In addition, the observation of lowest age at first charge among ver-
satile violent youth suggests that they would be at risk of persistent future offending (Gann, Sullivan,
& Ilchi, 2015), though it is noted that the age differences between them and the other two groups
were very small. Findings imply that rehabilitation for versatile violent youth needs to be adminis-
tered at a high intensity and also incorporate program that break the cycle of continuous offending.
Strengths and Limitations
The present study has a number of strengths and limitations. Strengths include a large, representative
youth offender sample across several cohorts, a non-Western sample, the inclusion of breach during
court orders in the measure of recidivism to minimize underestimation of reoffending among those
who were on custodial orders, and the use of time to recidivism, a more sensitive measure of reci-
divism than other measures (Maltz, 1984).
The use of a large number of coders to conduct coding may have affected the effect sizes and
ICCs. Using Cohen's guidelines (1988), the effect sizes ranged from small to moderate. The size
of offender group differences on risk and criminogenic needs was either small or moderate, with
r ranging from .06 to .36. The strength of associations between offender group and risk factors was
small, with F ranging from .05 to .17. Although it was expedient to have many coders for such a
large sample, it could have introduced more variance to the data. Likewise, the ICCs of YLS/CMI
could have been affected and were mostly fair according to Cicchetti and Sparrow's guidelines
(1981).
Since this was a retrospective study conducted after youth offenders have exited the justice sys-
tem, there was no information on self-reported offending behavior. Therefore, time to recidivism
could not account for instances of reoffending which had gone undetected by authorities. In addition,
without data on self-reported offending prior to the current offense, the frequency of offending could
not be reliably measured among these first-time entrants to the justice system and controlled for
(e.g., Piquero, 2000). Farrington, Snyder, and Finnegan (1988) had cautioned that ``despite problems
of concealment and forgetting, self-reports may be more useful than official records in studies of
specialization based on numbers of different types of offenses committed during offending careers''
(p. 467).
324 Youth Violence and Juvenile Justice 14(3)
Another limitation of the study is that the majority of the sample comprised male youth offenders.
Caution should be exercised in generalizing the findings to female youth offenders, given that there
are gender differences in aggression, the development of aggression (Loeber & Stouthamer-Loeber,
1998), and risk factors for aggression (Penney, Lee, & Moretti, 2010; Stephenson, Woodhams, &
Cooke, 2014; Valois et al., 2002). It would be useful for future studies to examine violent offender
typology among female youth offenders.

Note
1. A note should be made about the risk of reoffending of youth offenders residing in Juvenile Rehabilitation
Centres. Their risk of reoffending during their custodial orders was comparable with youth offenders on pro-
bation, since breaches of orders were included as recidivistic outcomes; 11.9% (55 of 461) had breached
their initial orders, whereas 51.6% (238 of 461) had reoffended during the follow-up period. For youth offen-
ders on probation, 10.8% (344 of 3,196) had breached their initial orders, whereas 37.6% (1,201 of 3,196)
had reoffended during the follow-up period.
