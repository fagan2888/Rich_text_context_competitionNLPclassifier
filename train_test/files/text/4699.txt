Abstract
Objective: Routine fasting (12 h) is always applied before laparoscopic cholecystectomy, but
prolonged preoperative fasting causes thirst, hunger, and irritability as well as dehydration, low
blood glucose, insulin resistance and other adverse reactions. We assessed the safety and efficacy
of a shortened preoperative fasting period in patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy.
Methods: We searched PubMed, Embase and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials up
to 20 November 2015 and selected controlled trials with a shortened fasting time before
laparoscopic cholecystectomy. We assessed the results by performing a meta-analysis using a
variety of outcome measures and investigated the heterogeneity by subgroup analysis.
Results: Eleven trials were included. Forest plots showed that a shortened fasting time reduced
the operative risk and patient discomfort. A shortened fasting time also reduced postoperative
nausea and vomiting as well as operative vomiting. With respect to glucose metabolism, a
shortened fasting time significantly reduced abnormalities in the ratio of insulin sensitivity. The
C-reactive protein concentration was also reduced by a shortened fasting time.
Conclusions: A shortened preoperative fasting time increases patients' postoperative comfort,
improves insulin resistance, and reduces stress responses. This evidence supports the clinical
application of a shortened fasting time before laparoscopic cholecystectomy.

Introduction
Laparoscopic cholecystectomy, which is the
treatment of choice for gallbladder stones
and cholecystitis, is considered a safe pro-
cedure with a low risk of complications
compared with traditional cholecystectomy.
However, the rate of postoperative nausea
and vomiting (PONV) in the first 24 h after
laparoscopic cholecystectomy ranges from
38% to 60% and affects the recovery of
patients, leading to a prolonged hospital
stay.1 Infection, adverse effects of anaesthe-
sia, and carbon dioxide pneumoperitoneum
also affect patients' recovery.2
Routine fasting (12 h) is always applied
before elective surgery to reduce the gastric
volume and acidity, which helps to avoid
acute respiratory tract obstruction, aspir-
ation pneumonia and Mendelson syndrome
during anesthesia.3 Enhanced recovery
after surgery protocols and new guidelines
developed by the American Society of
Anesthesiologists (ASA) recommend a 6-h
preoperative fasting period to reduce opera-
tive-related complications. However, some
studies have indicated that a long preopera-
tive fasting period causes patient discomfort
manifesting as thirst, hunger and irritability
as well as adverse reactions such as dehy-
dration, low blood glucose and insulin
resistance. Oral administration of carbohy-
drates 2 h before anaesthesia for surgery
is safe and reduces both insulin resistance
and patient discomfort.4 Oral carbohydrates
also reduce gluconeogenesis, glycogenolysis,
lipolysis and muscle protein catabolism
and increase glycogen reserves.5 At present,
a shortened preoperative fasting period
and administration of oral carbohydrates
before laparoscopic cholecystectomy remain
controversial. This systematic review was
performed to provide reliable evidence
for the application of this approach in
clinical practice.
Three published meta-analyses included
studies of paediatric, neoplastic and general
surgery, but their results require further
investigation. Recently, numerous trials eval-
uating the impact of preoperative fasting
times in patients undergoing laparoscopic
cholecystectomy have yielded inconsistent
results. Considering the differences in pre-
operative fasting times, we performed the
present meta-analysis of randomized con-
trolled trials to determine the impact of a
shortened preoperative fasting period in
patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystec-
tomy. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first meta-analysis of the effects of a shortened
preoperative fasting time in patients undergo-
ing laparoscopic cholecystectomy.
Materials and methods
Data sources, search strategies and
study selection
We searched the PubMed and Embase
databases and the Cochrane Central
Register of Controlled Trials using the fol-
lowing core terms: ``preoperative fasting,''
``diet restriction,'' ``perioperative period,''
and ``clinical trial.'' We applied no language
restrictions and included all relevant articles
up to 20 November 2015. We also conducted
manual searches from the reference lists of
identified trials. This study conforms to the
PRISMA guidelines for the reporting of
systematic reviews and meta-analyses.
Two reviewers independently identified
eligible reports. Discrepancies were resolved
through group discussion. The eligibility
criteria were as follows: treatment by lap-
aroscopic cholecystectomy, randomized
controlled design, and use of comparison
groups in which one group underwent a
shortened preoperative fasting time and the
other (control group) underwent routine
fasting or water as placebo. The exclusion
criteria were as follows: the study did not
evaluate the impact of the preoperative
fasting time, patients included those who
did not undergo laparoscopic cholecystec-
tomy, and data on some investigated
Xu et al. 23
outcomes were unavailable (e.g. under risk
in operation, gastric volume, pain, PONV,
glucose, insulin, insulin resistance/sensitiv-
ity, cortisol, C-reactive protein [CRP] and
carnitine).
Data extraction and quality assessment
Two authors compiled the data using a
predefined information sheet. The following
items were extracted from the included art-
icles: author, year, number of patients (experi-
mental), diabetes, ASA level, fasting time in
the experimental group, nutrient type, liquid
volume, control type and conclusion. Two
reviewers also independently assessed the risk
of design bias in the included studies using the
Cochrane Collaboration tool.9 The following
outcomes were evaluated in this review: under
risk in operation, gastric volume, pain,
PONV, glucose, insulin, insulin resistance/
sensitivity, cortisol, CRP and carnitine.
These outcome measures were ranked accord-
ing to the Grading of Recommendations
Assessment, Development and Evaluation.10
Statistical analysis
We used the inverse variance method to pool
continuous data and the Mantel­Haenszel
method for dichotomous data; the results
are presented as the standardized mean
difference (SMD) with 95% confidence
interval (CI), risk ratio (RR) with 95% CI
(under risk in operation) and odds ratio
(OR) with 95% CI. The I2 statistic was
calculated to evaluate the extent of variabil-
ity attributable to statistical heterogeneity
between trials. In the absence of statistical
heterogeneity (I2 < 50%), we used a fixed-
effects model; otherwise we used a random-
effects model.11 The median and quartile
data were transformed to mean and SD for
analysis.12 We analysed the following pre-
defined subgroups to identify the sources of
heterogeneity: nutritional types, control
types and intake volume. We investigated
publication bias by visually examining funnel
plots and using the Begg­Mazumdar and
Egger tests. The nonparametric ``trim-
and-fill'' method was used to determine
the stability if publication bias was present.
Generally, a two-sided P-value of< 0.05 was
considered statistically significant. Data
analysis was performed with Review
Manager (Version 5.3) and STATA
(Version 12.0).
Results
Literature search and study
characteristics
Our database search returned 249 articles
after removing duplicates, from which we
collected 11 trials for inclusion in our meta-
analysis (Figure 1). All included patients
underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy.
The ASA class was not described in two
articles, while one article included patients
with an ASA class of 1 to 3. The preopera-
tive fasting time was 2 h in all studies except
one, in which the fasting time was 3 to 4 h.
The intake type was carbohydrates (or
maltodextrin) and carbohydrates plus pro-
tein, glutamine, antioxidants or other nutri-
ents. The intake volume ranged from 200 to
400 ml. The control types were placebo
control (water) and blank control (routine
fasting). Blank control and placebo control
were set parallel in three studies. With
respect to the studies' conclusions, one art-
icle did not recommend a shortened pre-
operative fasting period based on the results
of glucose metabolism. Others considered a
shortened fasting time to be safe, reduce
patient discomfort, improve insulin sensitiv-
ity and reduce postoperative stress reactions
(Table 1). Three studies did not use a
blinding method, and four studies used
inappropriate blinding methods or the asses-
sor was not blinded to the study group.
Overall, the included studies had high-
quality designs (Figure 2).

Meta-analysis
For the operative risk and gastric volume
index, the fixed-effects model showed that a
shortened fasting time reduced the operative
risk (lg(RR), À0.74; 95% CI, À1.36 to
À0.12; P ¼ 0.019). There was no significant
difference in the gastric volume between the
shortened fasting and control groups (SMD,
À0.31; 95% CI, À0.83 to 0.21) (Figure 3).
For the subjective sensation index, pain
assessment using a visual analogue scale
showed that a shortened fasting time signifi-
cantly reduced postsurgical pain (SMD,
À0.89; 95% CI, À1.29 to À0.50; P ¼
0.000). A shortened fasting time also
reduced both PONV (lg(OR), À0.24; 95%
CI, À0.48 to À0.00; P ¼ 0.046) and opera-
tive vomiting (lg(OR), À0.47; 95% CI,
À0.71 to À0.22; P ¼ 0.000). However, there
was no significant difference in operative
nausea between the shortened fasting and
control groups (lg(OR), À0.33; 95% CI,
À0.72 to 0.06) (Figure 4).

For the glucose metabolism index, a
shortened fasting time significantly reduced
abnormalities in the ratio of insulin sensi-
tivity (lg(OR), À0.66; 95% CI, À1.31 to
À0.01; P ¼ 0.046). A shortened fasting time
also significantly reduced the postsurgical
glucose concentration (SMD, À0.84; 95%
CI, À1.67 to À0.00; P ¼ 0.049). There were
no significant differences in either the insulin

shortened fasting and control groups (insu-
lin: SMD, À0.09; 95% CI, À0.94 to 0.75 and
HOMA-IR: SMD, À1.25; 95% CI, À2.62 to
0.12) (Figure 5).
For the stress response index, there was
no significant difference in the cortisol
results between the shortened fasting and
control groups (SMD, À0.61; 95% CI,
À1.24 to 0.03). The results also indicated
that a shortened fasting time reduced the
concentrations of CRP (SMD, À1.42; 95%
CI, À2.33 to À0.51; P ¼ 0.002) and carnitine
(SMD, À0.99; 95% CI, À1.75 to À0.23;
P ¼ 0.011) (Figure 6).
Subgroup analysis
We used subgroup analysis to reduce sig-
nificant heterogeneity among the results.
Measurement of the intake volume before
surgery reduced the heterogeneity among
the gastric volume results, and adjusting for
the control type reduced the heterogeneity of
the nausea results (Table 2).
Publication bias
The Begg and Egger tests provided no
evidence of significant publication bias in
most outcome assessments except the gastric
volume (Egger test, P ¼ 0.000; Begg test,
N.S.), glucose (Egger test, P ¼ 0.001; Begg
test, P ¼ 0.004) and HOMA-IR (Egger test,
P ¼ 0.035; Begg test, N.S.) (Figure 7). The
nonparametric ``trim-and-fill'' method was
used to determine the reliability of our
results; it showed no qualitative alterations
except that a shortened fasting time reduced
the gastric volume (random-effects model:

Discussion
In total, 11 articles and 701 patients were
included in this systematic review of a
variety of outcome measures. The data
demonstrate that there is an overall benefit
associated with a shortened preoperative
fasting time, especially in terms of the sub-
jective sensation index.
In 2009, Brady et al.6 published a study
on the effect of preoperative fasting on
perioperative complications in children.
Their study showed that 120 minutes of
preoperative fasting did not lead to a higher
gastric volume and lower gastric pH, but
reduced perioperative discomfort. In 2015,

associated with low levels of trauma and
is very common in general surgery. This type
of surgical research could lead to promo-
tion of a shortened fasting time in the
clinical setting.
The present meta-analysis indicates that
oral carbohydrates taken 2 hours before
surgery do not affect the gastric volume.
One report even concluded that carbohy-
drates can reduce the gastric volume to a
greater extent than can routine fasting.
Okabe et al.21 indicated that clear fluids,
orange juice, and non-human milk had no
significant effect on gastric emptying,
although the total calories were the main
influencing factor.13 Oral carbohydrates
significantly reduced postoperative pain,
nausea and vomiting; one clinical trial of
adenotonsillectomy had similar findings,
although the results were not statistically
significant.14 Postoperative insulin resistance
refers to the reduction in tissue sensitivity and
reactivity after surgery. HOMA-IR, calcu-
lated according to the formula blood glucose
concentration (mg/dl)Â blood insulin con-
centration (U/ml)/405, can be used to
evaluate the level of insulin resistance.
Abnormal glucose tolerance and insulin
resistance lead to poor recovery after surgery.
Our analysis showed that oral carbohydrates
reduce insulin resistance and enhance sensi-
tivity. One study showed that carbohydrates
also reduce insulin resistance in patients
undergoing maxillofacial surgery.15 A certain

stress response occurs after any type of
surgery. Cortisol, which is regulated by
adrenocorticotrophic hormone and increases
after surgery, plays an important role in the
immune system. CRP is another inflamma-
tory indicator that significantly increases
in the first 24 to 48 hours after surgery.
The results of the present study indicate that
oral carbohydrates lower cortisol concentra-
tions, although the effect is not statistically
significant. Furthermore, oral carbohydrates
significantly reduce the CRP concentration.
A study involving gastrointestinal surgery
showed that oral carbohydrates taken 2
hours before surgery significantly reduced
the postoperative inflammatory response and
CRP/albumin ratio and shortened the hos-
pital stay.16 Volume intake was a source of
heterogeneity. There were no significant dif-
ferences between the 200-ml carbohydrate
intake group and the control group, while the
gastric volume was reduced in the 400-ml
intake group. After the publication bias was
eliminated using the ``trim-and-fill'' method,
a shortened fasting time and carbohydrate
intake were found to reduce the gastric
volume, which is consistent with the
findings of another clinical trial.17 The con-
trol type may be a source of heterogeneity in
postoperative nausea. A shortened fasting

time and carbohydrate intake significantly
reduced nausea when the control type was
placebo (water).
Although the outcome measures of a
shortened preoperative fasting time for lap-
aroscopic cholecystectomy were comprehen-
sively evaluated, this study had several
limitations. First, we did not have specific
individual data for all of the trials; thus, our
statistical analysis could only be performed
at the study level. Second, although sub-
group analysis was performed, there was
heterogeneity in several outcomes. This
indicates that there are still unknown fac-
tors that cause heterogeneity. Third, the
gastric volume, glucose concentration, and
HOMA-IR were likely sources of publica-
tion bias.
Conclusions
The findings of our study suggest that the
preoperative fasting time is associated with
increased postoperative comfort, improved
insulin resistance, and a reduced stress
response in patients undergoing laparo-
scopic cholecystectomy. This evidence sup-
ports the clinical application of a shortened
fasting time in patients undergoing laparo-
scopic cholecystectomy.
