Abstract
Messaging apps and Facebook groups are increasingly significant in everyday life, shaping
not only interpersonal communication but also how people orient themselves to public
life. These "dark social media" are important spaces for "public connection," a means
for bridging people's private worlds and everything beyond. This article analyzes how
people perceive news on such platforms, focusing on the different roles it plays in key
social networks that rely on dark social media for communication. Arguing that the use
of these platforms is foremost a social practice, the study employs focus groups with
local, work, and leisure-related communities to investigate questions of inclusiveness,
engagement, relevance, and constructiveness associated with sharing and discussing
news. We find the perceived value of news on dark social media hinges on the control
and privacy it provides. Community type was less significant than communicative aims
of the group for shaping the uptake of news and journalism.

Introduction
The rise of mobile technology, growing supply of available information, and increased
number of available social media platforms have created a media landscape in which
users can choose to connect to public life however and wherever they prefer. Social
media have become closely embedded in the routines of millions of users, blurring for-
merly distinct boundaries between private and public information and between produc-
ers and consumers (Chadwick, 2017; Ekström and Shehata, 2018). Not only do such
platforms open up possibilities for users to inform themselves about what is happening,
they also provide avenues to engage with such information within their social networks,
for instance through commenting, liking, or sharing. This way, social media can act as
spaces for "public connection," providing users with shared frames of reference that
enable them to engage and participate within their cultural, social, civic, and political
networks in everyday life (Couldry et al., 2010).
This article explores the various ways in which social media, messaging apps, and
Facebook groups, in particular, facilitate people's public connection within groups,
focusing on the significance of news and journalism. Traditionally, news has been con-
sidered one of the primary tools to create shared frames of reference to public life, foster-
ing community between individuals and facilitating social integration within groups
(Berelson, 1949; Couldry et al., 2010; Hess and Gutsche, 2018; Jensen, 1990). The emer-
gence of social media platforms and their connective potentialities give rise to questions
of how this relationship is impacted (Hermida, 2014). Although Facebook remains the
most frequently used social network worldwide and thus attracts most scholarly attention
(Stoycheff et al., 2017), studies such as the 2017 Reuters Digital News Report show that
people are increasingly using messaging apps for news (Newman et al., 2017). Covering
36 countries, it notes that while the uptake of WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger varies
significantly between regions, overall, 23% of respondents indicated they find, share, or
discuss news through messaging platforms; the trend is toward people moving from rela-
tively open (i.e. Twitter, public Facebook timeline) to more closed (i.e. messaging apps)
social media. While undoubtedly informative, the individualized, survey-based limita-
tions of such studies mean we still know very little about the experiences and rationales
underlying people's engagement with news in those spaces. A complicating factor is that
messaging apps are what Madrigal (2012) describes as "dark social media": sites that
handle user traffic without adding referral data when a user clicks a link. This makes it
difficult to track what type of news content is shared on them, much less how it is
discussed.
This study therefore employs focus groups to gain greater insights into how and why
people use news and journalism to connect in such semi-private spaces, which by their
nature oftentimes involve more "active" sociability and communicative participation
than open social media. Moreover, focus groups allow more explicit consideration of the
Swart et al. 3
impact of community type and social norms on such practices. As Heikkilä and Ahva
(2015) note, detailed studies on news practices that take social contexts into account
remain scarce. This study therefore bases its focus groups on three common types of
network in which people know each other both online and offline--geographic (local-
ity), work-related, and leisure-based groups--to uncover the individual and group-based
experiences of news use, the impact of social media, and how these interweave and influ-
ence one another. Capturing the significance of news and journalism for continuing to
foster public connection demands considering not only what issues people connect over
and the practices they engage in to do so, but also how connection is embedded in their
everyday lives and the value that connecting has for them. This article accordingly
focuses on four analytical angles to the concept of public connection (inclusiveness,
engagement, relevance, and constructiveness) to emphasize these lived experiences,
allowing us to capture if and how news becomes meaningful rather than starting from
normative presuppositions on why it should be (see Swart et al., 2016).
Public connection, news, and social media
Traditionally, news has functioned as an important avenue for public connection (Couldry
et al., 2010; Kaun, 2012; McCollough et al., 2017) with news organizations presenting
themselves as almost obligatory points of passage to find out what is happening outside
people's private worlds. Social media are not that different, in that respect. However, on
social network sites, the patterns of news use sustaining public connection are less pre-
dictable. News use in the era of mass media witnessed many people connecting through
the same product, distributed at relatively the same time, raising awareness and sparking
conversation through people's relatively shared patterns of exposure to news content
(Couldry, 2003). On social media, however, people co-create individualized timelines by
following specific accounts and adjusting personal settings, and the distribution of infor-
mation is subject to greater variance. That exposes them to a composition of content
that--at least theoretically--can be unique for every user. Such shifts take on greater
significance when considering how people engage with public affairs. Previous research
suggests that people tend to make sense of public issues within their personal networks
(Barnhurst, 1998; Ekström, 2016). The way people communicate using digital technolo-
gies potentially changes those dynamics of public connection.
The concept of public connection starts from the assumption that people do not navi-
gate through everyday life as atomized individuals, but are part of larger networks. For
example, they may share a language (cultural frameworks), vote for the same party
(political), volunteer at the same organization (civic), or enjoy leisure activities together
(social). Public connection is about the general orientation that individuals share toward
one or multiple of those public frameworks, which oftentimes overlap (Kaun, 2012; Ong
and Cabañes, 2011).1 Previous literature on public connection has highlighted such
shared frames of reference as necessary starting points for public engagement and par-
ticipation (Couldry et al., 2010; Dahlgren, 2000). While the idea of public connection is
employed beyond the field of communication and media studies, a significant body of
work focuses on the role of (news) media as tools to connect individuals to public life
(see Swart et al., 2016 for an overview).2

While such connection through news can happen individually, studies show that many
mediated public connection practices take place within social groups (Barnhurst, 1998;
Heikkilä and Ahva, 2015). A long tradition of scholarly work has addressed those social
contexts in which news is used (Peters, 2012), the connective potentialities it may have
(Couldry et al., 2010), and the dynamics between journalism and the communities it
serves(Reader,2012).EarlyexamplesareBerelson's(1949)WhatMissingtheNewspaper
Means, which concluded that newspapers are not only important to readers because of
their content but also the daily sense of connection to the world they provide, and Katz
and Lazarsfeld's (1955) Personal Influence, which stressed the critical function of inter-
personal communication and social networks for issue awareness. Such considerations
still hold sway in the digital era: recent studies confirm that people continue to make
sense of news within specific social contexts that are essential to their public connection
(e.g. McCollough et al., 2017; Schrøder, 2015). The use of news as a tool for public con-
nection, in other words, dates back far before the launch of MySpace or Twitter.
Likewise, while the rise of social media has highlighted the potentialities of news to
create a sense of community within social groups, the idea that mediated news practices
can facilitate social connections between individuals is far from new (Hess and Gutsche,
2018). For instance, the integrative role that television has traditionally played within
domestic settings, supporting the relational structure of the family, has been widely dis-
cussed (e.g. Jensen, 1990; Lull, 1980; Silverstone, 1994). Similarly, newspapers have
been found to serve as "a catalyst for conversation and human contact" (Bogart, 1989:
169) within social groups, particularly in local communities (see Hoffman and Eveland,
2010 for an overview). However, the digitalization of the news media landscape and the
rise of social media alter these connective potentialities of news.
This article builds upon and applies a conceptual framework we developed to study
recent shifts in mediated public connection (Swart et al., 2016). We specifically consider
four key aspects which transform through the ways digital technologies allow people to
bridge their private and public worlds. The first is the notion of inclusiveness: what
issues do citizens connect over within their communities and who is part of such connec-
tion? Earlier research has found that people frequently discuss and make sense of national
and international news, local affairs and economic issues with others, within a variety of
social settings (Wyatt et al., 2000). Social media allow such discussions to occur continu-
ously, regardless of physical co-presence, and can demarcate spaces for mediated public
connection, for example through closed Facebook and WhatsApp groups. This poten-
tially affects the news'socially integrative function, although it is important to recognize
that participating in news discussions is not always affirmative (Couldry, 2003); discuss-
ing public affairs can serve to challenge social norms within groups or be perceived as
something that potentially precipitates social disharmony (Ekström, 2016; Thorson,
2014).
Second, social media have opened up new forms of engagement with news. People
can choose from a large array of platforms that support following others and exchanging
public information to foster sociability within one's social groups. Those platforms, in
turn, facilitate a myriad of emergent news practices (Costera Meijer and Groot Kormelink,
2014; Picone, 2016), from acts such as creating a neighborhood Facebook group
Swart et al. 5
resembling community journalism (cf. Reader, 2012) to sharing news articles with col-
leagues on WhatsApp as conversation starters (Van Damme et al., 2015).
Third, because social media involve novel patterns of engaging with and consuming
news, it obtains a different place within the flow of daily life, changing the relevance of
connecting publicly. Earlier studies show that people engage in news talk to support vari-
ousrelationalstructures,fromthefamilytogroupsoffriendsandcolleagues(Boczkowski,
2010). Social media facilitate such connection, continuously and anywhere. Also,
through mobile technology groups can use social media to constantly monitor the issues
that may affect those in their community (cf. Schudson, 1998; Zaller, 2003). That may
foster a sense of security, similar to the rituals of daily newspaper reading observed by
Berelson (1949). Moreover, social media allow people to easily share such concerns and
quickly reach everyone within their networks (Hermida, 2014).
Finally, new opportunities for engagement and the increase in publicly available
information may affect the constructiveness of public connection, changing what inter-
ests connecting through news may help people advance within various social groups
(Couldry et al., 2010). For instance, private Facebook groups centered around common
interests or other shared characteristics such as location can serve as tailored news feeds
that automatically filter the news for information that is most useful for people in that
social group (Hess and Gutsche, 2018). Such spaces for "news curation" can help users
to avoid news overload and minimize the user activity required to reach articles of inter-
est (Lavie et al., 2010).
These transformations encourage renewed attention to the ways that people perceive
the efficacy of social media to connect to public life, and the role that news and journal-
ism play in this regard. A vast body of literature discusses how media in general (Deuze,
2012; Hanitzsch and Vos, 2018; Hepp et al., 2015) and social media in particular have
become closely and inextricably embedded in everyday life (e.g. Baym, 2015; Jenkins
et al., 2013; Lu and Hampton, 2017). Of course, news is only part of the information that
is spread on social media. That said, Reuters' Digital News survey found that 54% of
respondents report using social media for news every week (Newman et al., 2017).
Previous work has extensively analyzed the importance of social media relative to other
news sources and the extent to which people use them to find news (Gil de Zúñiga and
Valenzuela, 2011; Nielsen and Schrøder, 2014). Until now, however, limited attention
has been paid to the communicative and social meanings of news within people's every-
day networks and the influence of social media in that respect.
Methodology
Six focus groups were conducted in three different cities across The Netherlands, from
September to November 2016. Focus groups help uncover how people construct and
negotiate meanings collectively within groups about a certain topic by simulating every-
day forms of conversation and generating both points of consensus and difference
(Kitzinger, 1994; Lunt and Livingstone, 1996). In this case, our research interest was in
how news on social media may or may not be valuable for groups as a tool for public
connection. The Netherlands is an interesting context to study mediated public connec-
tion on dark social media platforms, as it is one of the countries where SMS and MMS
6 new media & society 00(0)
were expensive for a long time. Therefore, the use of messaging apps to share informa-
tion quickly became widespread with their emergence as a cheap alternative (Van der
Veer et al., 2016). For accessing news in particular, The Netherlands ranks in the middle
category below countries such as Malaysia, Brazil, and Spain, but far above the United
Kingdom and the United States (Newman et al., 2017).
Every group consisted of participants who knew each other personally and communi-
cated through social media at least twice a week. We selected a variety of groups, includ-
ing both territorial/geographical and relational/interest-based communities (Gusfield,
1975), and incorporating both groups that were formed by members themselves and
groups created in a top-down manner. Two were work-related (high school teachers, IT
customer support department), two were organized around leisure activities (football
[soccer] team, a student association) and two were location-based (local volunteers,
group of neighbors).3 Five groups used WhatsApp as their major social network to com-
municate, the neighbors used Facebook, and some groups relied on other media to com-
plement their communication (i.e. Google Hangouts, Slack, and email).
In total, 40 people participated, equally divided in terms of gender. The youngest
respondent was 18 years old, the oldest was 66. People with higher vocational or univer-
sity-level education were overrepresented in the sample. The first and fourth focus group
consisted of six participants, the second, third, and fifth had eight, and the final had four.
Participants were recruited through snowball sampling (Heckathorn, 2011), focusing on
recruiting individuals who were then asked to encourage their colleagues, friends, neigh-
bors, or acquaintances to participate. The focus groups took place at locations that were
most convenient for the group (e.g. participants' homes, offices, and club house). On
average, the sessions lasted 100 minutes. Snacks and soft drinks were provided. In return
for their participation, each participant received a 20 gift card.
The sessions were moderated by the first author, using semi-structured questions to
guide the discussion. As an ice breaker, participants were all asked to introduce them-
selves and describe how they knew each other and formed the group. Then, four main
themes were addressed: (a) patterns of social media use by the group, (b) the role of
social media in facilitating public connection, (c) the content shared on those platforms
they felt was relevant and important to others in the group, and finally (d) the role of
news and journalism for facilitating public connection on social media. Thus, only in the
second half of the session was the discussion focused on news and journalism, to avoid
presupposing its centrality for people's everyday public connection (Couldry, 2003).
Also, the concept of news was not defined beforehand, to allow participants to construct
and negotiate their own interpretation.
All sessions were audio-recorded, fully transcribed, and then coded line-by-line using
Atlas.ti to identify central themes. Second, focused codes were developed by testing the
most frequent of these initial codes against the entire data set. Finally, rereading the
material, theoretical codes were formed and tested. Multiple themes emerged throughout
the process, for example relating to social media group dynamics, the various affordances
different social media platforms have for users, and the informative uses of social media.
This article specifically focuses on the role of news for facilitating connection within
these groups' social networks. For privacy reasons, the names of the participants have
been replaced by pseudonyms.

Results
Our results show that understandings and practices of public connection vary consider-
ably between different communities, depending on the communicative aims of the group
and associated deployment of social media platform affordances. In turn, how group
members experienced the four dimensions of mediated public connection we distin-
guished--inclusiveness, engagement, relevance, and constructiveness--also differed.
Inclusiveness
The dimension of inclusiveness considers the issues people connect over and who they
connect with. The groups of social media users selected for the focus groups all under-
stood themselves as communities, displaying a sense of personal relatedness, a feeling of
mattering to the group, and a belief that members shared a connection through mutual
experiences, common places, and time spent together (cf. McMillan and Chavis, 1986).
Although social media were only one avenue facilitating that sense of community, they
were vital to the daily communication between members in all focus groups. Moreover,
those digital conversations were closely interwoven with the group's social contact in
non-virtual situations, mediating shared offline experiences by taking pictures and vid-
eos at get-togethers or linking back to discussions on social media in face-to-face
settings.
All groups mentioned how exchanging information on social media fostered sociabil-
ity. However, they showed great variation in the content sustaining that sense of belong-
ing and what was considered "news" within their community. Sometimes, shared content
was based on common interests: news in the Facebook group of the neighbors, for exam-
ple, included upcoming events at the local community center, local crime, and other
issues that in principle could be reported in local news media but were typically too
small-scale to generate media attention. Their Facebook group was a way to stay on top
of local issues and increase community attachment (cf. Hoffman and Eveland, 2010).
Likewise, for the teachers, the topics discussed--for example, refugees, human rights,
and environmental issues--strongly related to the content of their classes. In other
groups, however, type of community and the topics of the conversations were unrelated.
For the IT colleagues, discussing public issues had little to do with their job, but was
simply considered an enjoyable activity part of being a team. Topics therefore could be
very broad, seamlessly flowing from personal conversation to public affairs topics (cf.
Wyatt et al., 2000) and ranging from science to feminism to the US elections. Similarly,
the soccer team rarely discussed sports news. Their social media communities had a dif-
ferent purpose: arranging logistics, organizing team activities, and sharing gossip to fos-
ter sociability. The soccer team considered sharing journalism content irrelevant exactly
because it was news: thus, everyone would already have heard about it.
While Gil de Zúñiga and Valenzuela (2011) suggest that large and heterogenic net-
works tend to generate more civic activity, our results were mixed. For the IT team, their
diverse personal interests and political affiliations were a reason to discuss news in their
WhatsApp group: it was generic enough that all members in the group could talk along.
Moreover, others were likely to have different points-of-view and could thus provide
8 new media & society 00(0)
alternative perspectives. The soccer team, however, thought that in a large group with
diverse interests, news was unlikely to interest everyone. Thus, they would rather forward
stories to specific group members instead of posting it in their WhatsApp community.
The content connected over also varied between social media platforms, depending on
their degree of openness. The privateness of WhatsApp made it suitable for socializing
and discussing interpersonal news and stories about shared personal interests without fear
of embarrassment, fostering togetherness within the group. To connect beyond the group's
boundaries, however, participants employed more open platforms such as Twitter, the
public Facebook timeline, or LinkedIn, both actively by posting information about charity
events (soccer team), promoting their businesses (volunteers) or sharing vacancies (teach-
ers), and more passively, scrolling through their feeds to monitor news (Schudson, 1998;
Zaller, 2003). Regarding the latter, the teachers and IT team discussed how on Facebook
content does not necessarily stem from one's own connections and liked pages, but can
originate from outsiders too. Although they worried Facebook's filter bubble may shield
them from alternative political information, they also noted the platform made them stum-
ble on "surprise content" (Kim et al., 2013) they might not have normally discovered. The
private Facebook group of the neighbors was a compromise, enabling them to limit mem-
bership to people in the area making members feel safe to post, while still creating a
diverse community that would bring in different types of information.
The extent to which news and journalism were included in everyday communications
on social media thus varied per group and platform. Yet, even in communities where
"news" was close to traditional journalistic conceptualizations, only a selection of stories
would be included:
Stephanie:
When I open my NOS [public broadcaster] app now, there
are five things that make me think: it's interesting, but I'd
never post it in the group, because it [...] may be news
within The Netherlands, but it's not news for us. [...]
Charlotte:
Just like these two cops and the chokehold, then I think: I
know about this, but I won't share it, because it's already on
the news, I'd say. I think that's it, because the articles we
share aren't on the news or the news bulletin.
Marloes (approvingly): Uh-huh.
Nicole:
Those don't have news value, because they're too silent.
(Teachers)
Preferably, stories would address long-term developments and allow members to
explore multiple perspectives or aspects of a certain problem. The IT team, for instance,
discussed a news story about the Dutch parliament voting for a bill making all adults
organ and tissue donors unless they explicitly opt out, exploring not only its political, but
also ethical and legal dimensions:
Lisa:
I think it's logical that everyone wants to become a donor. But when
within my own group people already say: I have a different opinion,
that's much more interesting, because I didn't expect that. I understand
that people are against, but-
Swart et al. 9
Niels:
But the fun thing about our group is that you can just say that. Like I
said, there were people who thought their right of self-determination
got compromised, with a whole story behind it. There's a principle
underlying that. They aren't necessarily against people becoming a
donor, or whatever, there's a principle behind it I think everyone of us
can relate to. (IT team)
Rather than considering separate news reports, participants made sense of public affairs
by connecting several news events and weaving them into one coherent story. One-time
incidents that did not invite any further engagement were seen as less appealing. What
news becomes included in communities' shared frames of reference thus depends both on
group considerations--what news it considers to be of collective interest, and norms about
what news should be consumed collectively or individually--and content characteristics.
Engagement
The dimension of engagement pertains to the question of which forms of accessing and
interacting with news people perceive as "engaging" or "disengaging." The group of the
neighbors considered reading and liking each other's contributions in the Facebook
group to be ways of being engaged within their local community. Likewise, the IT staff
used their WhatsApp debates about public issues as a means to become integrated in the
team and get to know each other better through "playful connection" (Kaun, 2012). For
the fraternity and soccer team groups, however, engaging with news or public informa-
tion was perceived as an individual practice completely detached from their groups'
main communicative purpose for using social media. That did not mean they had less
interest in current affairs: most of them were frequent news consumers, just not in that
particular social context. Conversely, many teachers considered the news boring, yet
they would frequently share public issues on social media. Thus, as other studies have
found (Andersen and Kristensen, 2006; Swart et al., 2016), interest in public issues and
news use did not necessarily relate. Moreover, group dynamics evidently shaped the
perceived appropriateness of engaging with news in those contexts.
Beyond context and group dynamics, differences in technological affordances of the
used social media platforms also contributed to distinct patterns of engagement. Most
groups employed specific social platforms for a designated purpose: the teachers, for
instance, used Google Hangouts to ask quick work-related questions, but would discuss
long-term tasks via email. Similarly, Slack helped the IT team to retrace and archive job-
related conversations, and the leisure-oriented groups employed private Facebook groups
for organizing group activities so they could tag members to assign tasks. Interestingly,
groups would sometimes interpret the same technical affordances of platforms differ-
ently. For example, WhatsApp groups present users with a single stream of messages in
which posts easily get buried under the hundreds of other daily messages. For the student
association, this lack of hierarchy made the medium unfitting for discussing public
issues, as they could only reply to all group members instead of tagging specific people.
For the IT team, however, it supported the explorative nature in which they would dis-
cuss news. For them, discussing news events was typically part of a longer-lasting con-
versation: topics of interest, such as the US elections, would come into the dialogue
10 new media & society 00(0)
when relevant news would appear, move out again, to be referred back to during a next
event. WhatsApp supported that form of public connection.
Across all focus groups, the relative publicness of the Facebook timeline made par-
ticipants cautious when engaging with content. Replicating previous studies (Ekström,
2016; Marwick and boyd, 2014), our respondents perceived posting on public Facebook
timelines as expressing one's unconditional opinion, forever retraceable for potentially
anyone:
Kim:
I'm only inclined to share something when I feel really certain about it.
[...] Sometimes people think I'm making a statement, while [I'm not].
Then I'm sort of entering into a debate, and then it seems you're the
one with the statement. And then I think: that's not what I meant. [...]
Michelle:
Sometimes I haven't fully read an article. Then I'd like to discuss it
with someone, but I don't want to come across as--
Kim: A know-it-all.
Michelle: Yes.
Iris: Or someone who doesn't fully understand it. (Soccer team)
Even liking posts was perceived a considerable endorsement, as liked content also
shows up on others timelines and affects one's online image. Tagging, presenting stories
as completely detached from oneself, was more common. Contrary to the definitive
statements on Facebook, discussions on WhatsApp were more explorative in nature.
Sharing a news story here did not automatically equate to approval, but could simply be
a conversation starter:
Jelle:
In our group, when something is shared, it's shared because someone wants
to discuss it.
Lisa: Yes, by someone who holds a strong opinion.
Mark: More to talk about it than to share it, I think.
Niels:
That's what I like: something is shared that practically everyone already
knows in our app group, but the nice thing is that people will discuss it and
you can see what others think. (IT team)
Participants rarely shared news on WhatsApp to be the first to report breaking events;
they were more likely to hear first through Facebook or other platforms. Rather,
WhatsApp provided a safe space to make sense of news (Chambers, 2017), discover the
everyday impact of stories and discuss potential solutions. While being engaged in the IT
team community thus required frequent posting and responding, for the neighbors, read-
ing and liking others' contributions already constituted active engagement.
Relevance
The dimension of relevance addresses how and why news becomes embedded within the
flow of everyday life. In some social media groups, such as the teachers', the relevance
of shared news was closely tied to the group's identity. Not being able to talk along with
Swart et al. 11
other staff, parents, or students made them feel unprofessional. Since they had joined
social network sites, they felt better informed about public issues and more confident and
engaged. This knowledge benefit arose from passive scanning and observing (Schudson,
1998; Zaller, 2003) rather than from active uses that expressly deploy the communicative
capabilities of social media platforms to create informational networks, such as in the
neighbors' community. For them, actively sharing information about local affairs was a
way to be a considerate neighbor (cf. Hoffman and Eveland, 2010; Reader, 2012), a favor
to others that was expected to be returned. For the soccer team and volunteers, conversa-
tions were not so much linked to the group's goals, but instead centered around fostering
a sense of community:
Jacob:
You share experiences more frequently. When you're not here tonight,
you will receive a few messages via your phone that we are there and hav-
ing fun. So when you're not there, you still feel connected to the group.
[...]
Pieter:
We're immediately informing everyone in the entire club. [...]
Albert:
We're getting everyone involved. Everyone becomes part. That's a huge
advantage. (Volunteers)
The soccer team and student association likewise used WhatsApp to mediate shared
experiences and activities, foster friendship, and involve group members.
The platform most closely embedded in everyday life was WhatsApp. The soccer
players and IT team would exchange hundreds of messages per day, nurturing almost
continuous online socialization with colleagues and peers next to frequent offline
encounters. For the teachers and volunteers too, conversations originating on WhatsApp
would regularly extend into offline talk or vice versa, blurring boundaries between online
and offline togetherness (Bakardjieva, 2003). While facilitating sociability, this practice
also sometimes caused feelings of information overload, and a feeling that constant par-
ticipation was expected. Group communication on Facebook, compared to WhatsApp,
was much less frequent and more formal. Finally, the public parts of Facebook were used
to connect individually to people outside participants'communities, by monitoring time-
lines passively. For instance, most teachers checked Facebook daily to stay on top of the
news, but posted a screenshot or link on WhatsApp to share a story.
Consistent across groups was a shift in the relevance of social media platforms for
connecting socially. Participants noticed their friends would rarely update their Facebook
status anymore. Instead, their timeline had become heavily institutionalized:
Stephanie:
I check my Facebook timeline twice a day. Nowadays there are few
people who say something personal. Most often, it's articles, and of
course it depends on which friends share things, but often I find them
interesting.
Marloes: I do that too, but not through Facebook.
Esther:
Yes, I hardly check Facebook anymore. [...] There's so much coming
in within a day. I'm happy that the people I know don't share articles
through [Facebook], that'd be just too much. (Teachers)
12 new media & society 00(0)
While still convenient for some participants' in their daily routines, for others, this
perceived shift diminished Facebook's relevance, driving them away and disconnecting
them from the everyday life connections it formerly helped to afford. Talk on chat apps,
alternatively, having technological boundaries preventing pushed content going viral
were viewed primarily and positively for their sociality. Although users shared links to
news stories, WhatsApp discussions focused on participants' own opinions rather than
third-party content. Although such a shift to closed social media environments may knit
people's interpersonal networks closer together, it simultaneously constrains possibilities
for linking communities to wider spheres. "Dark platforms" might therefore limit the
diversity of news sources and political opinions that users are exposed to, raising ques-
tions about the democratic value of connecting through those spaces (cf. Thorson, 2014).
Constructiveness
Finally, social media serve as additional information sources and offer many new modes of
engagement. The dimension of constructiveness addresses what ends this may help users
achieve. For the teachers and neighbors, connecting through social media had direct ben-
efits in line with the group's raison d'être. The news stories the teachers shared through
WhatsApp would sometimes be used as educational material in class. The neighbors
exchanged upcoming events in the area to encourage local participation, from leisure activ-
ities to more politically oriented meetings. One participant recalled how another neighbor
had informed her of a municipality meeting on new cycling routes through the neighbor-
hood, which she had attended to voice her opinion. For the volunteers, the constructiveness
of social media news was not linked to their identity as charity workers, but to many mem-
bers being entrepreneurs. While news was rarely discussed within their group, individually
they employed Twitter and Facebook to follow niche sources, keep an eye on their compe-
tition, and promote their companies. For other groups, the constructiveness of connecting
through news was less self-evident. The IT department considered discussing public issues
and trying to understand the way news events relate to each other entertaining in itself. For
the soccer players, news--although rarely shared within their group--indirectly helped to
establish common grounds they could link to in conversations (cf. Boczkowski, 2010;
Bogart, 1989; Couldry et al., 2010). Finally, for the student association, using news was an
individual activity separate from their social engagement. They rarely discussed public
affairs online or offline, nor in other social contexts, and found that news had little every-
day value beyond the practicalities of weather and traffic information:
Nick:
When you don't know what has happened, you don't need to spend any
time on it. It's not like [news] makes you do or not do certain activities.
Koen:
Often it doesn't, but for example, we were in Utrecht for the weekend
and the trains weren't running. [...] If I'd read it in advance, I could've
taken it into account. So it's more the small, practical things that you
take away from it. Whether Trump or Clinton won a debate, that
doesn't matter to me. (Fraternity)
A distinction can be made between the constructiveness of platforms for connecting
within one's community and connecting individually transcending the group's
Swart et al. 13
boundaries. The work-related groups mentioned news stories in their WhatsApp chats
only occasionally, as a conversation starter or to illustrate a point. In the neighbors'
Facebook group however, they were central to discussion. On the public Facebook time-
lines, news media were even more dominant, showing up even when participants did not
actively follow or search for them. They felt Facebook had evolved into an information
hub rather than a space for public engagement, making the teachers and IT team move to
WhatsApp for those purposes. The soccer players perceived the increasing presence of
news companies in their timelines as troublesome: Facebook for them primarily fulfilled
a social function. Moreover, they criticized news media for focusing on harvesting clicks
instead of providing valuable information.
At the same time, across focus groups, participants mentioned their difficulty of
defining the trustworthiness of news on social media, as it would frequently originate
from unknown sources (cf. Tandoc Jr. et al., 2017). Moreover, several groups discussed
how the acceleration of the news cycle on digital platforms increased the risk of errors.
Groups like the IT team therefore regarded the presence of journalists and news media
on social media to be essential: without having anyone distinguishing facts from fiction
and protecting people from misinformation, they noted, news would lose its value, as
there was little opportunity for users to define news stories' accuracy. To them, journal-
ists' selection gave news a privileged position relative to other content. That position
made news a common ground, constructive for everyday talk and participation both
inside and outside the groups' communities.
Conclusion
The specific practices of news audiences on dark social media, in terms of topic selec-
tion, story preference, sharing, and so forth, are challenging to measure through conven-
tional analytics software, meaning that research has had trouble generating meaningful
comparisons with other ways that people "get the news." Moreover, our understanding
of the experiential and meaning-making aspects for people encountering news on mes-
saging apps and in Facebook groups is nearly non-existent. What research has revealed
to date tends to analyze the personal, informative uses of social media for news on the
level of the (aggregated) individual through surveys (Newman et al., 2017; Nielsen and
Schrøder, 2014). However, the results above emphasize the continuing importance of
communities and social interaction for the way people encounter and make sense of news
(Barnhurst, 1998; Heikkilä and Ahva, 2015), their public connection practices on dark
social media included. Our results show that some of these communities act as safe
havens or spaces of encouragement to share or discuss news, even though the collective
rationales underlying these practices differ. This article accordingly argues that engage-
ment with current affairs on messaging apps and Facebook groups cannot be reduced to
users' individual behavior, but is foremost a social practice whose meaning needs to be
considered at the level of the group.
Employing WhatsApp and Facebook groups, our participants created their own online
spaces to facilitate continuous connection within their communities through the exchange
of information, each with their own understanding of inclusiveness, engagement, rele-
vance, and constructiveness. Although community type (geographic, work-related, and
leisure) played some role in shaping how members conceived of and engaged with news
14 new media & society 00(0)
within the group, the uptake and the experiences of discussing journalism within these
communities more strongly depended on the groups' communicative aims. For the IT
team, playfully discussing current affairs was a means to social integration. The fleeting
nature of WhatsApp supported their explorative ways of making sense of public issues.
For the neighbors, sharing local affairs was a substitute for community journalism.
Facebook allowed them to connect a large, weak-tied group through neighborhood news
on a platform they all already used actively as individuals. The teachers' WhatsApp
group similarly acted as a news curation service, but with a stronger focus on utility,
forming a highly specialized news channel with potential class content. Dark social
media use by the volunteers or fraternity, however, viewed the sharing of news as a clear
breach of social norms--a means to public disconnection. For those group members,
social media was meant to facilitate relaxed sociability, and news didn't fit these aims.
Likewise, the soccer players' messaging app was primarily a logistical tool, where
debates about news would distract from the pragmatic goal of organizing the team. In
sum, groups specifically employ dark social media for designated purposes, which shape
norms about the value of news and journalism in such communities.
While studies indicate an international trend of users moving to dark social platforms to
get news (e.g. Newman et al., 2017), this study helps to specify and qualify exactly what
this means in terms of experiencing and relating to public issues through such practices.
Dark social media allow users to discuss news with people they trust in a private environ-
ment. Their technological affordances thus may cater to people's identities as colleagues,
friends, or neighbors, but their relative detachment from broader "publics" simultaneously
makes them less suitable for connecting beyond community boundaries, complicating the
notion of public connection itself. Similar to the face-to-face news discussions in private
settings that dark social media communities supplement, classic democratic functions
attached to news media, such as allowing the public to witness oneself and facilitating con-
nection between various communities (Coleman and Ross, 2010), are less self-evident
when engagement with news occurs behind closed doors. The democratic implications of
the increasing popularity of dark social media for news, thus, still remain unclear.

Notes
1. For instance immigrants often manage multiple orientations, circulating between different sen-
timents regarding the homeland and host country (Ong and Cabañes, 2011). Likewise, one's
gender, religion or ethnicity may traverse political, civic, social, and/or cultural boundaries.
2. Although few authors explicitly use the term "public connection," the concept is employed
implicitly in a wide range of scholarly work within media and journalism studies, political
communication and related fields, for instance in work on civic culture, cultural citizenship,
Swart et al. 15
social capital, civic engagement, and participatory democracy. These are discussed at length
in Swart et al. (2016).
3. While the main reasons for the groups'existence, in practice, these were not hard distinctions:
for instance, some colleagues would engage in leisure activities from time to time.
