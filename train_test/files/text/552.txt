Abstract
Purpose of the Study:This study examines how certified nursing assistants (CNAs) balancing family caregiving roles--
child care (double-duty child caregivers), elder care (double-duty elder caregivers), and both child and elder care (triple-duty
caregivers)--utilize health care services relative to nonfamily caregiving counterparts (formal-only caregivers).
Design and Methods: A sample of 884 CNAs from the Work, Family and Health Study was drawn on to assess the number of
acute care (i.e., emergency room or urgent care facility) and other health care (i.e., outpatient treatment or counseling) visits made
during the past 6 months.
Results: Double-duty elder and triple-duty caregivers had higher acute care utilization rates than formal-only caregivers.
CNAs with and without family caregiving roles had similar rates of other health care visits.
Implications: CNAs providing informal care for older adults have higher acute care visit rates. Given the increasing need for
family caregivers and the vital importance of the health of the nursing workforce for the health of others, future research on
how double- and triple-duty caregivers maintain their health amidst constant caregiving should be a priority.

Certified nursing assistants (CNAs) constitute an essential
occupation in the health care sector (Sweet,Pitt-Catsouphes,
Besen, Hovhannisyan, & Pasha, 2010). According to the
Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), these health care employ-
ees are considered primary caregivers and provide basic
care for patients in hospitals and residents of long-term
care facilities, such as nursing homes. Given their engage-
ment in hands-on care and more frequent contact with
patients than other nursing staff, CNAs are generally highly
active, balance heavy workloads, and perform physically
demanding tasks (Bureau of Labor Statistics [BLS], 2014).
Consequently, CNAs are at significant risk of on-the-job
injuries, with nonfatal injury and illness rates in the 98th
and 99th percentile for all occupations in 2007 (Bureau of
Labor Statistics [BLS], 2014; Khatutsky, Wiener, Anderson,
& Porell, 2012; Sweet et al., 2010). Despite such risks,
CNA employment is expected to grow 21% from 2012 to
2022 to keep pace with accelerated population aging and
the need for long-term care (Bureau of Labor Statistics
[BLS], 2014). The health care industry has thus been tasked
with meeting an increasing demand for services, coupled
with retaining and accommodating an aging workforce

susceptible to injury and illness (Harrington & Heidkamp,
2013).
In addition to challenging an under-resourced health
care system, rapid populating aging has led to a concur-
rent, unprecedented need for family caregivers (Harrington
& Heidkamp, 2013; St-Amant et al., 2014). Prior research
suggests that adults who combine paid, formal caregiving
in the health care sector with unpaid, informal caregiving
in their "off" time are increasingly prevalent in the health
care industry (Boumans & Dorant, 2014; DePasquale
et al., 2014; Ward-Griffin et al., 2015). In the literature, the
occupation of informal caregiving roles for dependent chil-
dren (i.e., double-duty child caregiving) or adult relatives
(i.e., double-duty elder caregiving) by practicing health care
professionals is called double-duty caregiving whereas the
occupation of informal caregiving roles for sandwiched
care recipients, or dependent children and adult relatives,
among such professionals is considered triple-duty caregiv-
ing. Double- and triple-duty caregiving are relevant for the
health care industry for complementary reasons. First, dou-
ble- and triple-duty caregiving are associated with a range
of health-related problems, including extreme physical and
emotional exhaustion, physical and mental fatigue, strain,
stress, anxiety, and psychological distress (Boumans &
Dorant, 2014; DePasquale et al., 2014; Scott, Hwang &
Rogers, 2006; Ward-Griffin, Brown, Vandervoort, McNair,
& Dashnay, 2005). Double- and triple-duty caregivers also
have an increased risk of compassion fatigue, a condition
specific to caregiving that negatively affects well-being as a
result of direct, prolonged exposure, and over identification
with care recipients' suffering (Ward-Griffin, St-Amant, &
Brown, 2011). Further, as double-duty elder caregivers pro-
vide more hours of informal care they report a greater need
to recuperate from work-related efforts and are more likely
to exhibit presenteeism, or attend work while ill (Boumans
& Dorant, 2014). Nurses' presenteeism is particularly
troubling given its link to more patient falls, medication
errors, and health care costs as well as lower quality of care
(Letvak, Ruhm, & Gupta, 2012).
Second, double- and triple-duty caregivers' health and
work­life balance affects care recipients' well-being. For
instance, a previous study found that the likelihood of mak-
ing medication-related, charting, or transcription mistakes
at work was more than doubled for hospital staff nurses
occupying an informal elder care role (i.e., double-duty elder
caregivers) compared to nonfamily caregiving counterparts
(Scott et al., 2006). The authors attributed poorer work per-
formance to sleep deprivation, as double-duty elder caregiv-
ers also reported the shortest average sleep duration on work
days. Indeed, prior research indicates that sleep deprivation
among nurses,a significant and prevalent occupational health
issue in the nursing profession, adversely impacts health,
judgment, and performance, leading to errors and accidents
that jeopardize patient safety (Surani, Murphy, & Shah,
2007). Additionally, double- and triple-duty caregivers expe-
rience more work­family conflict than nonfamily caregiving
counterparts (Boumans & Dorant, 2014; DePasquale et al.,
2014). Nurses' work­family conflict is linked to lower job
satisfaction (Cortese, Colombo, & Ghislieri, 2010), greater
job stress (Farhadi, Sharifian, Feili, & Shokrpour, 2013),
emotional exhaustion (Leineweber et al., 2014), poorer psy-
chological health (Rantanen et al., 2013), and physical pain
(Kim et al., 2013). These same outcomes, in turn, are associ-
ated with poorer work performance (Wang & Tsai, 2014)
and occupational mistakes (Pani & Chariker, 2004). Thus,
double- and triple-duty caregivers' work­family conflict may
hinder their ability to provide quality care.
Collectively, findings from prior double- and triple-duty
caregiving research demonstrate a need for health-promoting
behaviors among this population not only for the preserva-
tion of their own health, but for care recipients' health as
well. To date, however, no studies have examined a critical
aspect of double- and triple-duty caregiver health--use of
health care services.Therefore, the objective of this study was
to conduct an exploratory investigation of health care utiliza-
tion among CNAs working in nursing homes in the United
States, the majority of whom occupy double- and triple-duty
caregiving roles, by addressing the following questions:
1. How do double- and triple-caregiving role occupancy,
compared to formal-only caregiving (i.e., CNAs with-
out family caregiving obligations), relate to health care
utilization?
2. What factors are associated with CNAs' health care
utilization?
3. Are double-and triple-duty caregiving role occupancy
uniquely associated with health care utilization beyond
the effects of other factors?
Theoretical Framework
Given our proposed exploration of factors associated with
CNAs' health care utilization, we draw on the Andersen
and Newman (1973) Behavioral Model of Health Services
Use to inform variable selection. The Andersen and
Newman model views health care utilization as an indi-
vidual behavior resulting from three sets of contextual
factors: (a) predisposing; factors that exist prior to illness
onset, (b) enabling; the means by which health care ser-
vices can be accessed when needed, and (c) need; perceived
or clinician-evaluated health status and functioning. The
Andersen and Newman model has previously been tested in
family caregiving research to identify predictors of health
care utilization, but has never been applied to CNAs occu-
pying different family caregiving roles. Our study there-
fore provides the first empirical test of the model with this
population.
Design and Methods
Study Design
This study is part of a multidisciplinary research initiative
by the Work, Family and Health Network (WFHN), an
organization formed by the National Institutes of Health
(NIH) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
The Gerontologist, 2016, Vol. 56, No. 6 1115
(CDC), to enhance understanding of the ways in which
workplace practices and policies affect work, family, and
health outcomes among employees working in different
industries (see Bray et al., 2013; King et al., 2012).
Research Site
The WFHN mailed letters to several large health care
companies to recruit partners for research participation.
Potential partners were asked a standard set of questions
to ensure fulfillment of minimum requirements for study
participation. These requirements included basic informa-
tion about the company (e.g., number of employees work-
ing in the United States), its background (e.g., competing
initiatives), employees (e.g., demographics), and relation-
ship with management (e.g., willingness to participate). The
WFHN ultimately became corporate partners with a long-
term health and specialized care company managing 56
worksites in New England. With guidance from the com-
pany's Vice President of Development, the WFHN selected
30 nursing home facilities for study participation. Inclusion
criteria for consideration included size (< 30 nursing staff),
how recently the site was acquired (if relevant), stable man-
agement structure (i.e., minimal turnover), location in a
nonisolated setting, and no other research participation.
None of the facilities declined participation and one facil-
ity was excluded for participation in competing initiatives.
Sample
Eligible employees worked at least 22.5
hr per week in
direct care on day or evening shifts. Nightshift workers
were excluded given the logistical challenges of schedul-
ing in-person interviews as well as fundamental differences
between day and nightshift workers (e.g.,nightshift employ-
ees work on skeleton crews while residents are sleeping).
Of 1,783 eligible employees, 1,524 (85%) enrolled in the
Work, Family and Health Study (WFHS), 1,025 of whom
were CNAs and comprise the focus of this study.
Procedures
Trained field interviewers administered computer-assisted
personal interviews at a private location in the workplace.
Employees provided information about sociodemograph-
ics, family relationships, work environment, health, and
health behaviors. Interviews averaged 60min and employ-
ees received compensation for their time. Detailed informa-
tion regarding the WFHS protocol is described elsewhere
(Bray et al., 2013; King et al., 2012).
Measures
Outcomes
Health care utilization was operationalized as the number of
acute care and other health care visits CNAs reported mak-
ing for personal reasons/themselves in the past 6 months.
Specifically, acute care pertained to emergency room or
urgent care treatment facility visits for health treatment
(range = 0­15, M = 0.37, SD = 0.93) whereas other health
care visits reflected the receipt of outpatient treatment or
counseling from health care professionals (range = 0­76,
M = 1.49, SD = 5.27).
Predictors
We categorized CNAs into four mutually exclusive groups
based on family caregiving role occupancy (DePasquale
et al., 2014, 2015; Scott et al., 2006; Tement & Korunka,
2015). Double-duty child caregivers had children 18 years
of age or younger living with them for at least 4 days per
week. Double-duty elder caregivers provided care (i.e.,
assistance with shopping, medical care, or financial/budget
planning) for at least 3
hr per week in the past 6 months
to an adult relative, regardless of residential proximity.
Triple-duty caregivers were identified through endorsement
of both child and adult care criteria. Formal-only caregiv-
ers did not indicate any family caregiving obligations and
constituted the reference group.
To test the Andersen and Newman model (1973), we
identified multiple indicators of predisposing, enabling, and
need factors that may affect CNAs' health care utilization.
Classification of contextual factors was guided by the model
and a review of its application in family caregiving stud-
ies (e.g., Bergman, Haley, & Small, 2011; Bookwala et al.,
2004; Cox, 1997; Cox, 1999; Herrera, Lee, Palos, & Torres-
Vigil, 2008; Kosloski & Montgomery, 1994; Robinson,
Buckwalter, & Reed, 2005; Toseland, McCallion, Gerber, &
Banks, 2002). The model components and respective vari-
ables are summarized and presented in Table 1.
Predisposing
We examined the following predisposing factors: age
(in years), gender (0 = male, 1 = female), race/ethnicity
(0 = non-Hispanic White, 1 = White), educational attain-
ment (0 = high school degree or less, 1 = some college or
more), marital status (0 = single, 1 = cohabiting or mar-
ried), and average number of hours worked per week.
Enabling
We included the enabling factors of annual household
income and health insurance status, as both variables are
considered caregiver resources in accessing health care ser-
vices (Hinrichsen & Ramirez, 1992; Toseland et al., 2002).
Annual household income was measured on an ordinal
scale ranging from 1 (less than $4,999) to 13 ($60,000 or
more). For health care insurance status, we created dichot-
omous variables to represent CNAs ineligible for employer
health insurance (reference group), eligible but not enrolled,
or eligible and enrolled.
Need
Given that chronic health condition status is positively
associated with family caregivers' health care utilization
The Gerontologist, 2016, Vol. 56, No. 6
1116
(Baumgarten et al., 1997; Perlick et al., 2005), we included
self-reported clinical diagnoses of high blood pressure, can-
cer, and diabetes under the "ever been told" question stem
(0 = no, 1 = yes). We also examined indicators of psycho-
logical well-being, as previous studies have highlighted their
importance in predicting service utilization (Bergman et al.,
2011; Bookwala et al., 2004; Cox, 1997; Perlick et al.,
2005; Schubert et al., 2008; Son et al., 2007). Specifically, we
assessed nonspecific psychological distress and psychologi-
cal job demands (Williams, 2013). Psychological distress was
measured with the Kessler-6 scale (Kessler et al., 2003) which
includes six items (e.g., "How much of the time did you feel
hopeless?") pertaining to the past 30 days ( = 0.84); response
options ranged from none of the time (1) to all of the time (5).
We summed item responses to compute a composite distress
score; higher scores reflect greater distress. Karasek et al.'s
(1998) Job Content Questionnaire measured psychological
job demands ( = 0.59). CNAs rated their level of agreement
with three items (e.g., "My job requires very fast work") on
a 5-point scale (1 = strongly agree, 5 = strongly disagree). We
reverse-coded all items so that higher scores reflect greater
job demands and averaged responses. Additionally, we incor-
porated work-related injuries in the past 6 months (0 = no,
1 = yes), average sleep duration, body mass index (BMI), and
current smoker status (0 = no, 1 = yes), each of which may
exacerbate or contribute to the development of health prob-
lems. Further, because the severity of child health problems
or disability is positively related to parents' health care uti-
lization (Damiani, Rosenbaum, Swinton, & Russell, 2004),
we accounted for dependent children with developmental
disabilities, physical health problems, or long-term, serious
mental health problems.
Analytic Strategy
To ensure a consistent sample across analyses, we excluded
participants with missing data on any of the aforementioned
measures (n = 141), thereby resulting in a final analytic sample
of 884 CNAs. As commonly found in health care utilization
literature, acute care and other health care visits represented
non-negative integer count variables characterized by non-
normal distributions and overdispersion (i.e., skewed and
clustered at zero). We therefore modeled our outcomes with
negative binomial regressions (Hilbe, 2007).We accounted for
clustering of CNAs within nursing homes by obtaining robust
standard errors via the repeated statement (Huber-White cor-
rection) in the PROC GENMOD procedure in SAS 9.4. We
estimate two separate models per outcome. Model 1 addresses

Results
Descriptive Analyses
Table 1 presents sample characteristics by family caregiv-
ing role occupancy. ANOVA analyses indicate that family
caregiving role occupancy is related to age, gender, marital
status, health insurance status, psychological distress and
job demands, sleep duration, and smoker status. Specifically,
the formal-only caregiving group, on average, was older,
included fewer females and cohabiting or married CNAs,
and reported higher enrollment in employer health insur-
ance than the double-duty child and triple-duty caregiving
groups. Additionally, the formal-only caregiving group, on
average, reported longer sleep duration as well as included
fewer smokers relative to the double-duty child caregiving
group, and had lower psychological distress scores than the
double-duty elder and triple-duty caregiving groups. The for-
mal-only caregiving group also reported lower psychological
job demands, on average, than each double- and triple-duty
caregiving group.
Figure 1 provides a graphical depiction of the preva-
lence of health care utilization among CNAs. Overall, 23%
and 27% of CNAs made at least one acute care and other
health care visit in the past 6 months, respectively. Formal-
only caregivers had the lowest prevalence of acute care
utilization (19%) whereas triple-duty caregivers had the
highest (32%); this difference was statistically significant
(p < .05). Further, the prevalence of other health care visits
was lowest among double-duty child caregivers (24%) and
highest for triple-duty caregivers (37%).
Multivariate Analyses
RQ1: Double- and Triple-Duty Caregiving
In Model 1, double-duty elder and triple-duty caregiv-
ing were associated with higher acute care visit rates than
Formal-only caregiving (Table 2). Specifically, acute care visit
rates were 2.12 and 2.40 times greater for double-duty elder
and triple-duty caregivers, respectively. Double- and triple-
duty caregiving roles did not predict other health care visits.
RQ2: Contextual Factors
Among predisposing factors, only marital status was asso-
ciated with health care utilization, such that cohabiting or
married CNAs had higher rates of other health care visits.
With regard to enabling factors, neither health insurance
status nor income predicted health care utilization. Across
outcomes, however, the need factors of self-reported cancer
diagnosis and psychological job demands predicted higher
visit rates. Further, the need factors of self-reported high
blood pressure, psychological distress, work-related injury,
and living with a disabled child were linked to higher rates
of other health care visits.
RQ3: Unique Relationships
Although attenuated, the associations between double-duty
elder and triple-duty caregiving and acute care visits per-
sisted after adding predisposing, enabling, and need factors
in Model 2. Double-duty elder and triple-duty caregivers
had 91% and 77% higher visit rates, respectively. Double-
and triple-duty caregiving role occupancy remained nonsig-
nificant predictors of other health care visits.
Discussion
Greater understanding of work­family pressures is a key
action step for the health care sector as it reforms workplace
practices to keep pace with population aging (Harrington
& Heidkamp, 2013; Sweet et al., 2010). Double- and tri-
ple-duty caregiving constitute significant, yet overlooked,
work­family pressures experienced by a growing num-
ber of health care workers. Although prior research has
highlighted the adverse effects of double- and triple-duty
caregiving (Boumans & Dorant, 2014; DePasquale et al.
2015; Scott et al., 2006), we are unaware of any studies
that assess health care utilization among this population.
Thus, our study is the first to empirically test the Andersen
and Newman (1973) model as a scientific framework for
understanding the role of contextual factors in acute care
and other health care visit rates among CNAs simultane-
ously occupying family caregiving roles.
In addressing RQ1, we found that double-duty elder and
triple-duty caregivers had higher rates of acute care utiliza-
tion than formal-only caregivers; conversely, double- and

triple-duty caregivers and formal-only caregivers had simi-
lar rates of other health care visits. RQ2 aimed to iden-
tify factors associated with CNAs' health care utilization.
Guided by the Andersen and Newman (1973) model and
its previous applications in family caregiving research, we
organized factors that may affect CNAs' health care utiliza-
tion into predisposing, enabling, and need characteristics.
Overall, predisposing and enabling factors had few effects
on health care utilization. Instead, the need component rep-
resented the only set of determining variables associated
with CNAs' acute care utilization and was most pertinent
for other health care visits. Although it has been suggested
that predisposing and enabling factors may be as impor-
tant as need factors in predicting family caregivers' health
care utilization (Toseland et al., 2002), our findings are
congruent with a number of family caregiving studies that
demonstrate the significance of need variables (Bergman
et al., 2011; Bookwala et al., 2004; Cox, 1997). Further,
need factors may be a more salient contextual factor for
CNAs than family caregivers because of their professional
status. That is, predisposing and enabling factors may not
have the same impact given CNAs' specialized health care
training or expertise, knowledge of available health care
service options, familiarity in navigating the health care
system, and health care connections (Ward-Griffin et al.,
2005). Our results are also consistent with prior literature
in that the significance of variables measuring contextual
factors generally differed depending on the type of health
care service under consideration (Toseland et al., 2002).
With regard to RQ3, double- and triple-duty caregiving
role occupancy were uniquely related to acute care utiliza-
tion beyond the effects of contextual factors. One possible

explanation for our findings is that, despite the negative
health effects of double-duty elder and triple-duty caregiv-
ing (Boumans & Dorant, 2014; DePasquale et al., 2014;
Scott et al., 2006; Ward-Griffin et al., 2005) and likely high
need for health care services among this population, provid-
ing informal care for older adults constitutes a barrier to
more routine health care utilization. A similar notion was
proposed by Baumgarten et al. (1997) after finding that use
of physician services was no greater for dementia caregivers
than noncaregivers even though caregivers had poorer over-
all health. Baumgarten et al. hypothesized that commitment
of time and energy to informal elder care prevented car-
egivers from addressing their own health concerns. Indeed,
qualitative research suggests that health care professionals
informally caring for adult relatives are typically responsible
for a wide range of activities, such as providing hands-on
care, making care-related decisions, delegating tasks, over-
seeing professional care, and advocating for care recipients
(Giles & Hall, 2014; St-Amant et al., 2014; Ward-Griffin
et al., 2005). These responsibilities, all of which are com-
pleted in addition to formal caregiving, detract from time
and energy otherwise allotted to maintaining one's own
health. Further, as care recipient needs grow more complex,
double- and triple-duty caregivers' care provision likely
intensifies. If double- and triple-duty caregivers forgo or
postpone their own health needs to fulfill increasing infor-
mal care demands, they may exacerbate preexisting illnesses
or work-related injuries and amplify stress vulnerability.
Consequently, critical need factors may prompt double-duty
elder and triple-duty caregivers to seek health care services
at a point in which acute care is necessary.
Two other explanations adapted from Baumgarten et al.
(1997), selection bias and self-reliance, facilitate interpre-
tation of results from this study. First, CNAs' health care
utilization patterns may reflect selection forces. For exam-
ple, 27% of CNAs in the WFHS sample made at least
one other health care visit in the past 6 months whereas,
according to the 2012 National Health Interview Survey
(NHIS), approximately 80% of individuals 18 years or
older made at least one visit in the past year (Blackwell,
Lucas, & Clarke, 2014). In addition to being relatively
younger than NHIS participants, CNAs in the WFHS are
all employed. Employment implies that CNAs are capable
of successfully adopting as well as maintaining a physically
and psychologically demanding work role. Individuals
who frequently require health care services or are in poor
health likely do not select into a formal caregiving occupa-
tion; if they do, they may be more likely to exit the role.
Relatedly, selection forces may be particularly applicable to
double- and triple-duty caregivers in that they must be in
good health to balance multiple caregiving role occupancy
and fulfill accompanying role demands. Second, formal
caregiving may enhance self-reliance and reduce perceived
need or desire for health care services. As health profes-
sionals, CNAs may rely on their own training or expertise
to address personal health concerns or engage in self-care
tactics that would otherwise prompt lay persons to make
nonemergency health care visits. The additional respon-
sibilities associated with providing informal care to adult
relatives, however, may motivate double-duty elder and tri-
ple-duty caregiving CNAs to seek health care services when
health problems are serious or exceed their abilities, two
health scenarios that likely require acute care.
Moreover, adult care recipients' unpredictable care needs
(Hessel & Keck, 2009) and familial pressure (Ward-Griffin
et al., 2005) may affect health care utilization patterns. In
anticipation of changes in adult relatives' health, CNAs may
be hesitant to ask for or make work accommodations to
manage their own health needs during the work day. Rather,
they may reserve these options for unexpected care recipi-
ent events to avoid exhausting safeguards and sacrificing
earnings. Although speculative, this explanation implies
that double-duty elder and triple-duty caregivers resort to
acute care for their own health purposes, are strategic in
their use of workplace supports, and exhibit presenteeism.
Additionally, double-duty elder and triple-duty caregivers
may feel that they cannot plan or partake in routine health
care visits for themselves as others are relying on them to pri-
oritize informal care. Indeed, qualitative evidence indicates
that double-duty elder caregivers prioritize care recipients'
needs and place unrealistic expectations upon themselves
to be a model family member (Giles & Hall, 2014; Ward-
Griffin, 2004; Ward-Griffin et al., 2005). Therefore, acute
care may represent a convenient health care service that per-
mits double- and triple-duty caregivers more control amidst
uncertainty arising from family caregiving roles.
Limitations and Future Directions
This study has several limitations. First, the cross-sectional
design precludes causal ordering and exploration of the
dynamic qualities of the constructs examined. Second,
health care utilization measures were based on subjec-
tive, retrospective reports that may be subject to recall
bias. Third, CNAs worked in health care facilities in New
England, thereby limiting generalizability. Finally, we con-
ducted a secondary analysis of existing data not specifically
designed to study caregiving. Though the data lacked ideal
information regarding caregiving intensity, it enabled us to
construct proxy measures of family caregiving role occu-
pancy consistent with prior research (DePasquale et al.,
2014; DePasquale et al., 2015; Scott et al., 2006; Tement
& Korunka, 2015). Still, it should be acknowledged that
this approach operationalizes child and adult care differ-
ently. Specifically, the child care measure does not assess
actual care provision; instead, dependency is implied by
age (i.e., under 18) and cohabitation. However, the aver-
age age of children (6.51 and 7.85 for double-duty child
and triple-duty caregivers, respectively) supports the notion
that child care recipients in the WFHS sample were depend-
ent. Conversely, adult care specifies criteria for care pro-
vision; this criteria is more stringent than the 1
hr time
The Gerontologist, 2016, Vol. 56, No. 6
1120
commitment required in prior double-duty care research
(Gottlieb, Kelloway, & Martin-Matthews, 1996; Ward-
Griffin, 2004). It should also be noted that, although we use
the term double-duty elder care, this measure may encom-
pass care for adult relatives other than aging parents, such
as spouses or siblings in midlife. Nonetheless, a sample
drawn from a working population is advantageous in that
it may be more representative of double- and triple-duty
caregivers than a sample selected for a certain threshold
of care or care recipient illness (DePasquale et al., 2014;
DePasquale et al., 2015). Additionally, although family car-
egiving experiences likely vary within the WFHS sample,
the employment role is constant. Thus, family caregiving
role occupancy distinguishes double- and triple-duty car-
egiving CNAs from formal-only caregivers.
The aforementioned limitations should not outweigh the
contributions and knowledge gained from this study. We
bring attention to and advance understanding of a unique
and understudied population. Traditionally, researchers
have studied formal and informal caregiving separately
instead of considering the implications of their intersection
(Ward-Griffin et al., 2015). Understandably, then, previous
studies on double- and triple-duty caregiving comprise a
small, limited body of research characterized by qualitative
evidence, relatively small samples of registered nurses or
health professionals working outside of the United States,
and a sole focus on double-duty elder care (Boumans
& Dorant, 2014; Giles & Hall, 2014; Ross, Rideout, &
Carson, 1996; Rutman, 1996; Scott et al., 2006; St-Amant
et al., 2014; Ward-Griffin, 2004; Ward-Griffin et al., 2005;
Ward-Griffin et al., 2011; Ward-Griffin et al., 2015). We
contribute to this existing literature by focusing on a large
CNA population working in nursing homes in the United
States, accounting for different informal caregiving roles,
and providing novel empirical evidence regarding health
care utilization, an outcome not previously examined
among double- and triple-duty caregivers. An additional
strength is our extension of the application of the Andersen
and Newman (1973) framework.
Thus, our investigation serves as an essential baseline
and lays the groundwork for prospective explorations
of health care utilization among double- and triple-duty
caregivers. It is important that our findings be viewed
as an initial step toward identifying the prevalence and
predisposing, enabling, and need correlates of health
care utilization among double- and triple-duty caregiv-
ers, and that they be replicated with more representa-
tive samples, longitudinal research designs, and further
expansion of the Andersen and Newman (1973) model.
For instance, only one care recipient characteristic (i.e.,
child disability) was available when applying the model
to WFHS data. Future studies employing the Andersen
and Newman framework should integrate care recipi-
ents' predisposing, enabling, and need characteristics to
examine how each contributes to caregiver health care
utilization. Similarly, integration of other subcomponents
of individual determinants, such as attitudes or beliefs
about health care utilization, and inclusion of societal
determinants (e.g., health system resources) may enhance
the model's explanatory power (Andersen & Newman,
1973). Moreover, whereas this study simultaneously
examined contextual factors, longitudinal studies can
test the causal ordering of relationships hypothesized
within the model (Andersen, 1995). In addition to model
expansions, prospective research assessing health behav-
ior engagement, self-care strategies, and other types of
health care services is warranted. Further, because health
care utilization may be delayed until an urgent health
problem arises, data on the timing of and reasoning for
health care visits will be particularly informative. As
important, studies that acquire information regarding
caregiving intensity as well as health information about
or from care recipients can be used to examine concord-
ance between care recipient events and caregiver health
care utilization. Qualitative studies in which double- and
triple-duty caregivers discuss perceived barriers, facilita-
tors, and life or health events in relation to health care
utilization may complement such efforts. Lastly, the
availability, use, and relevance of workplace practices,
programs, and policies for double- and triple-duty car-
egivers' health care needs represent a pivotal direction
for future research.
Conclusion
Independent of predisposing, enabling, and need factors
specified in the Andersen and Newman (1973) framework,
double-duty elder and triple-duty caregivers had higher
acute care visit rates than formal-only caregivers. Given
that their welfare is critically important for the well-being
of others, additional research on how double- and triple-
duty caregivers maintain their health amidst the challenges
of constant caregiving is necessary.
