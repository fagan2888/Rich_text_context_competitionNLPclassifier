Validity of Maternal Report of Acute Health Care Use
for Children Younger Than 3 Years
Deborah D'Souza-Vazirani, MHSA; Cynthia S. Minkovitz, MD, MPP; Donna M. Strobino, PhD
Background: National household surveys often rely on
parents' recall to assess children's use of health care ser-
vices. However, little is known about the accuracy of pa-
rental reporting of hospitalizations and emergency de-
partment (ED) use.
Objectives: To assess the agreement between maternal
reported and medical record acute health care data for chil-
dren younger than 3 years and to determine if agreement
between the 2 varies by maternal characteristics.
Design and Methods: Data were obtained from the
national evaluation of the Healthy Steps for Young Chil-
dren for 2937 families who completed parent inter-
views at 2 to 4 and 30 to 33 months and whose chil-
dren's medical records were abstracted. Services assessed
included hospitalizations and ED visits since birth (2-4
and 30-33 months) and in the last 12 months (30-33
months). Absolute and beyond chance agreements were
calculated. Results were stratified by maternal age (20,
20-29, or 30 years), parity (first-time, second-time, or
greater mother), income ($20000, $20000-$49999, or
$50000), and the presence or absence of maternal de-
pressive symptoms.
Results: Absolute agreement was high for hospitaliza-
tions (90%) at both time points. It was high for ED use
(90%) only at 2 to 4 months. Beyond chance agree-
ment was higher for hospitalizations than for ED use at
2 to 4 and 30 to 33 months. Beyond chance agreement
declined with increased duration of recall and younger
maternal age. No differences were found by other ma-
ternal characteristics.
Conclusions: Mothers have good recall for acute health
care events during the first 3 years of their children's lives.
This finding suggests that mothers are a good source of
information regarding children's acute health care use.

ACUTE HEALTH CARE USE IS
a common outcome mea-
sure in children's health
services research.1 - 3
Knowledge about inpa-
tient hospitalizations and emergency de-
partment (ED) visits informs researchers
and policy makers about access to health
care, quality of care, and health care use
expenditures.2 Overuse of acute health care
often reflects limited access to primary
care, inefficient use of health care dol-
lars, and, thus, wasted resources.2,3 Spe-
cifically, use of the ED for nonurgent care4,5
and ambulatory-care-sensitive hospital-
izations6,7 are 2 indicators of reduced ac-
cess to primary care. Thus, accurate in-
formation about acute health care use is
important.
Use may be measured through admin-
istrative records, medical record audits, or
surveys. Administrative data sources of-
ten are restricted to single payers or insti-
tutions and may not reflect usage experi-
ence of children with changing insurance
and multiple sites of care.3 Although medi-
cal records are often considered the "gold
standard" for measurement of health care
use,1,8,9 there are several potential prob-
lems. They include the cost and time as-
sociated with abstracting medical rec-
ords, especially in large studies; the use of
multiple service providers by some pa-
tients necessitating access to records from
multiple sources; and the reality that some
visits, especially visits to specialists and to
EDs, may not be reported in the primary
care record.1,10

Questions arise, however, as to whether

ity of this information depends on the abil-

lies, Medical Expenditures Panel Survey, and Community
Tracking Household Survey use parent-reported data to
determine children's use of health care. Because surveys
collecting health information on the child depend on the
ability of a parent to recall and report on a wide range of
medical conditions with which they may have little fa-
miliarity, the quality of those reports is uncertain.8 Many
pediatric studies are solely based on parents' retrospec-
tive reports of the child's health use.8,10-13
Studies of the validity of parental reports of their chil-
dren's use of health care have mixed results. For immu-
nization histories, results suggest that mothers are inad-
equate informants,13-18 while studies on recall of children's
birth weight found good recall.19,20 Good recall was also
found for receipt of mental health services,21 receipt of
chronic care services,8 and occurrence of otitis media.11
Many previous studies of maternal recall, however, ex-
amined only a single event such as birth weight,19,20 vac-
cination,16,17 or otitis media.11 Moreover, to our knowl-
edge, there are no recent studies that have examined
parental reporting of their children's acute health care use.
Most prior literature regarding agreement between self-
report and medical records for health care use has fo-
cused on senior citizens.22,23 However, findings from stud-
ies that have examined recall in elderly populations may
not pertain to children. Children are different because
they are dependent on adults for their health care use,
and adults are the proxy respondents used to collect chil-
dren's health care use data.3 Moreover, children tend to
have fewer acute health care events than adults.3
In general, prior research has shown that reporting ac-
curacy is affected by the characteristics of the child, acu-
ity of the illness, type of health care service, and respon-
dent characteristics.1,18,24,25 There may be systematic
differences (underreporting or overreporting) in recall
based on seriousness of health events, income, ages of
the parent and child, number of siblings, gender, edu-
cational attainment of the parents, duration of recall, type
of service used, and the relation of the respondent to the
index subject. Kosa et al12 found that the younger the age
of the child, the more accurate the health care service re-
port by the parents. Daly et al11 found that the more se-
vere the health condition, the more accurate were pa-
rental reports of the details of health care service
experiences. Research also suggests that the frequency
of child health care service encounters as well as their
recency positively affects reporting accuracy.14,19 Hawe
et al16 found that parents with lower educational levels
and parents with more children in the household tend
to provide less accurate reports of child health care ser-
vice encounters.
Prior studies, however, have not examined whether
maternal mental health influences the accuracy of re-
porting of children's acute health care services use. Ma-
ternal depressive symptoms have been documented to
have negative influences on parenting practices includ-
ing health care seeking for their children.26-31 It is pos-
sible that poor maternal mental health could lead to over-
reporting of a child's receipt of acute health care services,
thus, accounting for the observed findings. A meta analy-
sis by Richters32 determined that depressed mothers re-
liably report on their children's behavior problems; how-
ever, they did not examine the influence of maternal
mental health on reporting on children's acute health care
use. Determining the accuracy of maternal reporting is
needed to understand the previously reported associa-
tions between maternal depressive symptoms and chil-
dren's increased ED visits27-29 and hospitalizations.30,31
The objective of this article is to assess the agreement
between maternal reports and medical records for chil-
dren from birth to 3 years of age for hospitalizations and
ED use. The study also examines whether agreement var-
ies with the type of acute care (hospitalizations vs ED vis-
its), period of recall, or maternal demographic and health
characteristics. We hypothesized that (1) maternal report-
ing for acute health care use is as complete a source of in-
formation as medical record data; (2) maternal recall is
more complete for hospitalizations than it is for ED use;
(3) mothers have greater recall of acute health care events
when their child is 2 to 4 months old than when their child
is 30 to 33 months old; and (4) mothers reporting depres-
sive symptoms overreport acute health care use relative
to mothers without depressive symptoms.
This study relied on data collected for the National
Evaluation of Healthy Steps for Young Children. Healthy
Steps for Young Children is a new model of pediatric prac-
tice that supplements routine pediatric care with child
development specialists and enhanced developmental ser-
vices for families of young children.33-35 In the evalua-
tion of the Healthy Steps for Young Children, a cohort
of 5565 children was followed up from birth to age 3 years
at 15 pediatric practice sites in the United States.35
METHODS
PARTICIPANTS
The study sample included 2937 families whose children
participated in the Healthy Steps for Young Children, whose
parents completed 30- to 33-month interviews, remained at the
practice throughout the interventions, and had their child's medi-
cal records abstracted. Of the Healthy Steps for Young Chil-
dren cohort of 5565 children, 3737 families had completed
30- to 33-month interviews. Of the 3737 families who had com-
pleted 30- to 33-month interviews, 764 were excluded be-
cause they were no longer at the practice at 30 to 33 months,
and 36 had no medical records abstracted. Additionally,
177 did not complete 2- to 4-month interviews.
Institutional review board approval was obtained for this
study from The Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public
Health Committee on Human Research, Baltimore, Md.
Informed consent was obtained at the time of enrollment and
reviewed prior to each interview.
DATA SOURCES
Data for this study were obtained from enrollment question-
naires, parental interviews at 2 to 4 months and 30 to 33 months,
and medical records.32,34 Parents completed a brief standard-
ized questionnaire available in both English and Spanish at the
time of enrollment into the Healthy Steps for Young Chil-
dren.33 This form provided demographic characteristics includ-
ing maternal age and parity. Structured parent telephone in-
terviews were conducted when the children reached 2 to 4
months and 30 to 33 months of age; virtually all the respon-
dents were mothers.34,35 These interviews provided additional

demographic characteristics including household income. Dur-
ing the interviews, respondents reported on children's use of
acute health care services and maternal depressive symptoms.
Data from the interviews and the medical records included
the dates of hospitalizations and ED visits (including urgent
care center use).35 Medical records for each child were ab-
stracted through 32 months of age. Using a standard precoded
form, trained abstractors at each evaluation site audited the medi-
cal records of participating children after the children reached
32 months of age.36 The abstractors participated in 2 to 3 days
of competency-based training in the protocol.36 Abstracted visit
data included the dates of hospitalizations and ED visits or ur-
gent care visits.36 Interrater reliability for child hospitaliza-
tions and ED visits was 0.75 and the percentage of agreement
was 92% for hospitalizations and ED visits.36
STUDY VARIABLES
Dichotomous variables were used to describe hospitalizations
and ED use. Hospitalizations since birth were reported by moth-
ers in the 2- to 4-month and 30- to 33-month surveys. Hospi-
talizations in the last 12 months were identified in the 30- to
33-month survey. Emergency department visits since birth were
assessed at 2 to 4 months, and ED visits in the last 12 months
were identified from the 30- to 33-month interviews.
Maternal age, parity, household income, and depressive
symptoms were characterized to determine whether agree-
ment varied by maternal characteristics. Maternal age in years
was categorized as follows: less than 20, 20 through 29, and
30 and older. Parity indicated if the mother was a first-time par-
ent or second-time or greater parent. Maternal income was cat-
egorized as having an income of $20000 or less, between $20000
and $49999, and $50000 or more.
Maternal depressive symptoms were assessed at both inter-
views using a modified 14-item version35 of the 20-item Cen-
ter for Epidemiologic StudiesÂ­Depression (CES-D) scale.37 The
CES-D has a high internal consistency, with  coefficients of
0.85 for general population samples and 0.90 for patient
samples.37 A 14-item, abbreviated scale was developed for the
Healthy Steps for Young Children evaluation by assessing re-
dundant items using data on 600 parents in an evaluation of
child abuse prevention programs in Pennsylvania.35 The cor-
relation of the reduced version with the full scale exceeded 0.95.
The  coefficient for the 14-item CES-D in the Healthy Steps
for Young Children sample for mothers at 2 to 4 months was
0.85, similar to that for the total scale for general population
samples.34 In the 14-item instrument, response categories re-
mained the same as the 20-item scale and scores of 11 or more
corresponded with the cutoff of 16 for the 20-item scale.
DATA ANALYSES
We first examined the distribution of demographic characteris-
tics and maternal depressive symptoms. We then calculated the
level of agreement between survey data and medical record data
for hospital and ED use, by calculating the proportion of abso-
lute agreement and beyond chance agreement using the Cohen
 statistic. Beyond chance agreement is the extent to which the
observed agreement (absolute agreement) between 2 sources or
informants exceeds that which would be expected by chance
alone.38 In this study the observed agreement and beyond chance
agreement are calculated between maternal report data and medi-
cal record data. Beyond chance agreement is expressed as the pro-
portion of the maximum improvement that could occur be-
yond the agreement expected by chance alone that the sources/
informants achieved.38 The degree of beyond chance agreement
isinterpretedaccordingtoLandisandKoch39:0.00to0.20(poor),
0.21 to 0.40 (fair), 0.41 to 0.60 (moderate), 0.61 to 0.80 (sub-
stantial), and 0.81 to 1.00 (almost perfect). Beyond chance agree-
ment was calculated for both the 2- to 4-month and 30- to 33-
month interview data. Results were stratified by maternal age
(20, 20-29, or 30 years), parity (first-time or second-time or
greater mother), household income ($20000, $20000-
$49999, or $50000), and presence (yes/no) of maternal de-
pressive symptoms at 2 to 4 months and 30 to 33 months. Analy-
ses were conducted using Stata software (version 7.0; Stata
Corporation, College Station, Tex).
RESULTS
About half of the mothers were between 20 and 29 years
of age and first-time parents, while 36% of the study
sample was in the high-income category (Table 1). At
2 to 4 months and again at 30 to 33 months, 15.5% of
the mothers reported depressive symptoms.
A comparison of the survey responses and medical rec-
ord data at both the 2- to 4-month and 30- to 33-month
survey is given in Table 2. Mothers reported higher num-
bers of hospitalizations at the 2- to 4-month survey but
not at the 30- to 33-month survey than the number re-
corded in the medical records. There was higher report-
ing of ED visits in the parent interviews at both the 2- to
4-month and 30-to 33-month surveys than from medi-
cal records. Absolute agreement was high for hospital-
izations (90%) at both time points and high for ED use
(91%) only at 2 to 4 months.
The s calculated for hospitalizations since birth from
the 2- to 4-month and 30- to 33-month interview data
and medical record data showed substantial agreement.
Similarly, substantial agreement was found for ED visits

at 2 to 4 months. Beyond chance agreement for both hos-
pitalizations and ED visits declined with increasing age
of the children (Table 2).
Substantial beyond chance agreement was found for
hospitalizations since birth at the 2- to 4-month survey
regardless of maternal characteristics including age, de-
pressive symptoms, income, or parity (Table 3). For hos-
pitalizations since birth at the 2- to 4-month survey, s
increased with increasing age of the mother and higher
parity. Substantial agreement was also seen for hospital-
izations since birth at the 30- to 33-month survey for all
maternal characteristics, although agreement was lower
than that for hospitalizations since birth, as reported in
the 2- to 4-month survey. Only moderate agreement was
seen for hospitalizations in the last 12 months at the 30-
to 33-month survey regardless of maternal characteris-
tics. Beyond chance agreement between acute health care
use and medical record information was similar for moth-
ers who reported having depressive symptoms at 2 to 4
months or at 30 to 33 months and mothers with no de-
pressive symptoms at these 2 time points.
Moderate to substantial beyond chance agreement was
seen for ED use at the 2- to 4-month survey for all ma-
ternal characteristics, while beyond chance agreement was
only fair to moderate for ED use in the last 12 months at
the 30- to 33-month interviews. For ED use since birth
at the 2- to 4-month survey, s increased from moder-
ate to substantial with increasing household income.
COMMENT
The purpose of this study was to determine the level of
agreement between mothers' reports and medical record
data for children followed up from birth to 3 years old for
hospitalizations and ED use. The study also examined
whether agreement varied with the nature of the acute
health care event (hospitalizations vs ED visits), period of
recall, and maternal demographic characteristics.

ED visits since birth at the 2- to 4-month interviews. The
discrepancies between parental reporting and the medi-
cal records in this study may be attributed to 2 factors--
inaccurate recall and incomplete medical records. Al-
though the medical record is intended to be the complete
source of a child's health care services use history, medi-
cal records may not have complete information for care
provided at all sites. This may be due to children seeking
care at other health care facilities or with other physi-
cians, and the documentation of this care not being sent
to the child's primary care physician to be included in the
medical record.3 Also ED visits may not be included in the
medical record owing to separate information systems that
exist within the same health care institution.
One hypothesis of our study is that maternal recall is
greater for hospitalizations than it is for ED use. Our find-
ings show substantial agreement was found for hospi-
talizations since birth at both the 2- to 4-month and the
30- to 33-month surveys while s calculated for ED vis-
its since birth at the 2- to 4-month survey also showed
substantial agreement but not at the 30- to 33-month sur-
vey. These results suggest that parents have greater re-
call of hospitalizations than ED visits, likely because of
the increased acuity of a hospitalization as well as the
trauma of the child not being at home.21 Based on pre-
vious studies, it is reasonable to assume that recall de-
pends on the seriousness of an event,10 supporting our
hypothesis.
We were interested in examining if mothers had greater
recall of acute health care events when their child was 2
to 4 months old than when their child was 30 to 33
months old. Analyses showed that beyond chance agree-
ment decreased with increasing age of the child. Other
studies suggest that recall depends on the recency of an
event.10,14,19 The more recent the health care event (both
hospitalizations and ED visits), the greater the parental
reporting and recall relative to the medical record. Moth-
ers in our sample seem to be likely to remember the more
acute and recent health care event when the child was
an infant. Other studies on parental recall of hospital-
izations similarly suggest that acute health care events
in an infant are imprinted in the parent's memory while
time may blur the details and events, and they may be
confused with other episodes of health care use.1,19
Older mothers in our study had greater recall of hos-
pitalizations than did younger mothers when their chil-
dren were infants. This finding is contrary to those of Pless
and Pless10 who found that younger mothers rather than
older mothers recalled more accurately. In our study,
mothers with higher incomes and more children also had
greater recall of recent hospitalizations than mothers for
whom this was their first child. This finding is also con-
trary to the findings from Pless and Pless10 who found
that mothers with fewer children had better recall of hos-
pitalizations. No differences in recall were seen by ma-
ternal characteristics for ED use and hospitalizations re-
ported at the 30- to 33-month survey.
We hypothesized that mothers in the study reporting
depressive symptoms overreport acute health care use
more often than mothers without depressive symp-
toms. Recent studies have shown that maternal depres-
sive symptoms are significantly associated with chil-
dren's acute health care use.27-31 Bartlett et al27 reported
that mothers with depressive symptoms were 30% more
likely to report ED use than mothers without depressive
symptoms. Similarly, Minkovitz et al29 demonstrated that
maternal depressive symptoms at 2 to 4 months were as-
sociated with a 1.4 increased odds of ED visits in the pre-
ceding year among toddlers. Guttmann et al31 reported
that maternal depressive symptoms were significantly as-
sociated with the risk of hospitalization in children aged
12 to 24 months. Similarly Flynn et al28 found that el-
evated depressive symptoms in mothers were related to
both missed pediatric outpatient visits and greater use
of pediatric ED services. Chung et al30 found that moth-
ers with persistent depressive symptoms were nearly 3
times as likely to have their child hospitalized in the first
year of life than mothers without depressive symptoms.
Sixteen percent of mothers in our study reported hav-
ing depressive symptoms at 2 to 4 months and at 30 to
33 months. Beyond chance agreement was similar for
mothers with and without depressive symptoms at both
time points. Analysis of the frequency of children's hos-
pitalizations at both surveys indicated no differential re-
porting of acute health care use by depressive symp-
toms. Similar analysis of frequency of ED visits by
depressive symptoms at both surveys suggests more com-
plete reporting by mothers than the medical records. This
is consistent with children likely receiving ED care at mul-
tiple sites and incomplete primary care records.
Despite the large sample size and the availability of re-
peated measurements of health care use from interviews
and medical records, the study has a few limitations that
may not make the results generalizable. Families in this
sample participated in the study for approximately 3 years
and had the same source of primary care for 30 months.
Thus, mothers in this study are more likely to be aware of
health care use, and their children may have more com-
plete medical records than mothers whose children do not
have a consistent source of medical care. Additionally, an
evaluation of the severity of the health conditions for the
hospitalizations and ED visits was not conducted to de-
termine if maternal recall of their children's hospitaliza-
tions and ED visits differed by acuity of the conditions.
Also, we were unable to do a more refined analysis of the
duration of recall as to when specifically hospitalizations
and ED visits occurred.
CONCLUSIONS
The results of our study suggest that maternal reporting
is a complete source of information of event occurrence
from household surveys and that maternal reporting does
not differ substantially from the information available from
the medical records especially for acute health care events
occurring when the child is an infant. Accuracy of infor-
mation on acute health care events may be affected by du-
rationofrecallandmaternalagebutlesssobyparity,house-
hold income, and maternal depressive symptoms.
