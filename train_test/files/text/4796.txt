Ordinary citizens and the
political cultures of planning:
In search of the subject of a
new democratic ethos

Abstract
What is required of the citizen to make planning more democratic? In this article, I argue this
previously overlooked question illuminates key challenges for democratising planning in theory
and practice. Distinguishing between deliberative and agonistic conceptions of communicative
planning, I review the qualities these theories demand of citizens. Through examples from
Scotland, I then contrast this with the roles citizens are currently invited to perform within a
growth-orientated planning culture, drawing attention to techniques that use constructions of
`good' and `bad' citizenship to manage conflict generated by development. I conclude by suggesting
that while `ordinary' citizens' experiences draw attention to the strengths and weaknesses of
deliberative and agonistic accounts, they also highlight hidden costs associated with participation
that present significant challenges for the project of shaping a more democratic form of planning.

Introduction: `ordinary' citizens and the democratisation of
planning
If the `communicative turn' in planning theory has focused attention on the need to
develop more inclusive forms of planning, subsequent developments have been moti-
vated by different normative conceptions of the democratic qualities that should be fos-
tered to ensure that the politics of planning can play out justly and effectively. This has

been most notable in attempts to articulate and then reconcile both deliberative and ago-
nistic conceptions of planning as a democratic communicative practice (e.g. Bond, 2011;
Forester, 2012; Healey, 2012; Hillier, 2002). Both deliberative and agonistic planning
theorists have been motivated by perceived failings in actually existing planning
democracy, mirroring broader concerns that the political cultures of established liberal
democracies are in a state of crisis.
One significant result of the legitimation crisis facing traditional representative
democracy has been the intensification of struggle over the goals of public policy beyond
formal political arenas and into the administrative spaces of the policy process (Brodkin,
1987), requiring policy-makers to search for new ways of legitimising decisions and
managing conflict in the policy process. Hajer (2003) for example argues for recognition
of new patterns of political engagement where citizens are increasingly on `stand by',
waiting for issues that will `ignite'their involvement and that often emerge at the `end of
the pipe' during policy implementation.
A key response to the increasing salience of end-of-the-pipe conflict has been the
proliferation of invitations to citizens to participate in public decision-making. As
Newman (2011) argues, however, a key set of questions raised by participatory initia-
tives concerns the identity of the citizen welcomed into such spaces: if certain forms of
`active citizenship' are openly encouraged by authorities anxious to enrol the legitimis-
ing authority of the `ordinary' citizen, more `activist' orientations are typically consid-
ered problematic. Yet, if communicative planning theory has focused increasing attention
on the need to foster `people-centred' forms of governance as a means of `re-enchanting
democracy' (Healey, 2012), it is perhaps curious that the qualities required of the citizen
have not always been central.1 Indeed, normative theory has arguably paid relatively lit-
tle attention to how the democratic citizen-subject it requires might be summoned.
Moreover, despite long-standing commitments to democratic participation in planning
decisions, in practice, high levels of anxiety attend to the identity of the citizens that turn
up at the `end of the pipe' and their ability to meaningfully and legitimately participate
(e.g. the `NIMBY' problem!).
In this article, I therefore argue that focusing attention on the subjectivities required
of citizens can illuminate key aspects of the challenge of realising a more democratic
form of planning (e.g. a form of planning within which all of those affected are able to
participate in decisions either directly or through representative channels). My concern
is to contribute to understandings of the ambiguous political potential that is opened up
in the fields of power where citizens are called to meet state planning functions, drawing
attention to both the normative construction of the `good citizen' in planning theory and
the often overlooked politics of citizen-subject formation in planning practice. Beyond
this, however, by adopting a `citizens' eye view', I also aim to highlight often hidden
dimensions of citizens' experiences that have significant implications for understanding
the political and democratic possibilities of political participation in contemporary
planning.
The article is structured as follows: I begin by critically reviewing the qualities that
different theoretical conceptions of democratic planning might require of the citizen.
Following this, I use examples from Scotland to contrast these normative constructions
with the limited forms of democratic citizenship currently invited in practice, drawing
406 Planning Theory 14(4)
attention to a repertoire of techniques that use constructions of what constitutes `good'
and `bad' citizenship to manage the conflict generated by development. These examples
highlight perhaps predictable failings of existing planning democracy from the perspec-
tive of citizens `ignited'by a political culture that paradoxically encourages their engage-
ment but also defends against its disruptive effects. Finally, I go on to consider what the
experience of becoming politically active means for theories that seek to promote more
democratic planning practices. I conclude that a focus on the forms and practices of citi-
zenship fostered within the policy process helps to identify important aspects of the
change required to transform the democratic ethos of planning while also raising key
concerns about the demands that planning processes make of citizens in the name of
democracy.
The `good citizen' in planning theory
Deliberative (or collaborative or consensus-seeking) planning theory, influenced by
Habermas' (1996) model of deliberative democracy, is premised on fostering inclusive
debate between all those with a `stake'in a decision in order to shape democratic agreement
about the best course of action. Agonistic planning theory, drawing particularly on the
work of Chantal Mouffe (1993, 2005), has been presented as a critical counter-point to
agreement-seeking versions of communicative planning. For Mouffe, the political cannot
exist without disagreement and any `consensus' can only ever be the stabilisation of an
existing balance of power. Pointing to the prevalence of conflict, strife and dispute in plan-
ning, agonistic planning theorists have argued for an alternative ethos premised on foster-
ing respectful disagreement to avoid the coercive dangers of the search for consensus.
Increasingly well-rehearsed debates between deliberative and agonistic planning the-
orists have focused largely on the extent to which communicative exchanges can or
should be geared towards shaping agreement or allowing the expression of disagree-
ment. However, as noted above, the qualities required of the citizen, and how such a citi-
zenry might emerge and become committed to either a deliberative or agonistic
conception of what constitutes good democratic planning remains underdeveloped (cf.
Norval, 2007). In this section of the article, I therefore sketch (admittedly generalised)
pictures of the citizen that deliberative and agonistic theories of democracy would sum-
mon into being. I then use these sketches to consider what this focus means for accounts
of democratic planning.
`The deliberative citizen'
The deliberative citizen commits to the idea that `that parties to political conflict ought
to deliberate with one another and through reasonable argument try to come to an agree-
ment on policy satisfactory to all' (Young, 2001: 671). This requires her to engage in
rational discussion within which she will forward reasons justifying her preferences and
listen to the arguments forwarded by others. Her aim is to achieve a rational consensus
(or at least some temporarily binding agreement) through deliberative processes that
approximate to Habermas' normative `ideal speech situation', characterised by perfect
communication between actors with equal power.2
Inch 407
Deliberation needs to be conducted sincerely, for example, with a faith in the pro-
cess, respect for other participants and a commitment to acting with a communicative
ethos. This latter condition means that the deliberative citizen will not act strategically
to pursue her own ends, but will earnestly seek to work with others to shape a rational
agreement. While elements of interest-based `bargaining' and `fair compromise forma-
tions' are widely accepted to be the best that can be hoped for in real-world conditions,
in order to ensure that deliberation is free and equal and that only the force of the better
argument is brought to bear on decisions, the deliberative citizen should commit to
bracketing off the distorting influence of power on deliberation. She should therefore
`check her privilege' and seek to ensure that such distortions do not enter into the
deliberative process.
The deliberative citizen is not necessarily required to leave her pre-existing beliefs,
motivations and interests outside of deliberation; however, she is required to enter into a
communicative exchange with a willingness to reflexively reshape them through inter-
subjective dialogue (Chambers, 1996). Ideal forms of deliberation are also therefore a
potentially transformative experience for the democratic subject, leading to new under-
standings of interests, preferences and even of deeply held individual and collective
identities (Warren, 1992).
Given this rather demanding set of requirements, considerable debate in both politi-
cal and planning theory has focused not just on the (un)desirability of the deliberative
ideal, but also on the (im)possibility of achieving something approximating genuine
deliberation in real-world conditions (see, for example, Benhabib, 1996a). Key con-
cerns have centred on the impossibility of truly bracketing power from deliberation
and ensuring that all citizens have full `epistemological authority' in deliberative set-
tings (e.g. Saunders, 1997; Young, 2001). This has led some advocates to question
what commitment to a deliberative ethos means for the political activity of citizens
who would seek to achieve it in real-world settings? Young (2001) and Fung (2005)
both conclude that `deliberative activists' cannot always be expected to act delibera-
tively but might be required to denounce their principles and adopt non-deliberative
forms of political action in order to fight against unjust realities that make fair delib-
eration impossible.
Others, however, have gone further to ask whether and why citizens would choose to
organise their collective affairs deliberatively in the first place (Saunders, 1997), particu-
larly where this presents such a challenging model of legitimate democratic behaviour.
Norval (2007) further suggests that existing accounts of deliberative democracy do not
pay enough attention to the processes involved in becoming a democratic subject com-
mitted to deliberation, for example, how can such a deliberative citizen be summoned
and the requisite qualities fostered?
`The agonistic citizen'
For Mouffe (1993), the agonistic citizen needs to identify with the broad principles of
liberal democracy:
What we share and what makes us fellow citizens in a liberal democratic regime is not a
substantive idea of the good but a set of political principles specific to such a tradition: the
408 Planning Theory 14(4)
principles of freedom and equality for all ... To be a citizen is to recognize the authority of such
principles. (pp. 65­66)
By cultivating identification with these principles, the citizen accepts membership of a
political community but not in a way that determines her identity ­ she remains free to
argue between competing interpretations of freedom and equality. The citizen therefore
develops an agonistic respect for other participants without being obliged in any way to
strive for agreement with them, taming the potentially antagonistic results of disagree-
ment such that `enemies' are redefined as `adversaries'.
For the agonistic citizen, the aim of political action within this community is to secure
the hegemonic position of a particular articulation of `freedom and equality for all'. This
means articulating new demands to unsettle an existing hegemonic settlement that is the
sedimentation of an historical set of power relations. The task of the `radical democratic'
citizen, Mouffe's normatively preferred mode of agonistic citizenship, is to articulate
`chains of equivalence' that link together the demands of all those fighting against rela-
tions of domination, creating new `us' and `them' identities in the process. The radical
democrat is therefore a counter-hegemonic activist.
Mouffe also questions the strict requirements of rational deliberation laid out by
Habermas and his followers, arguing that the effects of power are not a distortion of a
potentially perfect form of communication but an intrinsic element of all communica-
tion, i.e. there can be no ideal speech situation or communicative rationality that is
power-free. Mouffe's agonism therefore encourages citizens to see politics not as rational
deliberation but as a passionate activity which draws on registers of affect, influencing
actors' attachment to particular discourses. This means that the agonistic citizen is not
bound by rules of rational argumentation and allows a wider range of political expression
to be considered legitimate, including recourse to strategic and direct action, and rhetori-
cal and symbolic forms of politics that are often potent symbols of conflict, bringing
power out into the open so that it can be contested.
As Norval (2007) highlights, the agonistic focus on disagreement emphasises important
aspects of democratic practice, but also tends to neglect the necessary institutionalisation of
any democratic ethos, for while democracy can and does act as a valuable disruptive force, it
also needs to `act as the medium in which general purposes become crystallized and enacted'
(p. 55). An account of democracy that focuses only on the opening up of lines of disagree-
ment therefore seems less well equipped to explain how legitimate decisions can be reached
(and what role reason giving and justification might be expected to play in such processes).
By opening democratic practice up to raw political passions, some critics also worry about
the potential dangers of unleashing and legitimising undemocratic forces (Benhabib, 1996b).
Here, Mouffe's focus on the political as the expression of underlying antagonism arguably
militates against the exploration of an ethos within which agreement is possible, where citi-
zens may learn to make decisions together even across lines of difference.3
Understanding the demands of democratic citizenship made by
planning theory
Key agreement-seeking planning theorists like Healey (2006) have long argued that real-
world planning communication is unlikely to come close to the deep level of consensus

implied by Habermas' (1996) much cited `ideal speech situation' and that more limited
forms of agreement are the best solution that can be hoped for. They have also acknowl-
edged the challenges of ensuring equality between participants in communicative
exchanges, and the need to open up deliberation to different types of knowledge. More
recent work has taken account of the agonistic critique and seeks to emphasise the scope
for dealing with disagreement within agreement-seeking deliberations (Forester, 2012;
Innes and Booher, 2010), highlighting key qualities that collaborative governance should
foster (Healey, 2012).
Agonistic planning theory meanwhile, having emerged as a critical, deconstructive
response, has begun to explore the institutional changes required to open up decision-
making spaces to legitimate disagreement (e.g. Bond, 2011; Mäntysalo et al., 2011;
Pløger, 2004). Theorists have also recognised that the distance between their arguments
and agreement-seeking models is not always pronounced. Few, for example, envisage
planning decisions that do not require the deliberative exchange of reasons (Bond, 2011).
Hillier (2002), following Benhabib (1996b), therefore, argues for forms of deliberation
that can do justice to the agonistic qualities of democracy. In this spirit, some recent work
explores how an agonistic ethos might help productively reframe deliberative debates
(e.g. Mouat et al., 2013).
It is also clear from the discussion above, however, that ideal-typical deliberative
and agonistic planning (or any blending of the two) would require the cultivation of
specific civic virtues, including particular conceptions of how the common good
should be understood and what constitutes legitimate political behaviour. This is sum-
marised in Table 1. Following Cruikshank (1999), each ideal-type normatively
expresses a `will to empower' that requires the production of citizen-subjects commit-
ted to what each takes to constitute the rights and responsibilities of good democratic
citizenship.4 However, questions about how such virtues are cultivated and what would
lead people to commit to them as deliberative or agonistic citizens are not always
410 Planning Theory 14(4)
clearly addressed (cf. Norval, 2007). This raises questions about how citizens within
`precariously democratic societies' (Forester, 1989: 3) might acquire the democratic
ethos these theories require of them?
Much of the wider literature in political theory (e.g. Young, 2001), deliberative pol-
icy-making (e.g. Dodge, 2010) and planning theory (e.g. Purcell, 2009) has arguably
tended to focus on already committed and skilful political actors (e.g. activists, social
movements and campaign organisations). Debate has often focused on the kind of demo-
cratic ethos and practices that open opportunities to such actors. Alternatively, the focus
in planning theory on the role of professionals in fostering such qualities has perhaps
tended to implicitly assume the presence of publics able to effectively deliberate pro-
vided the spaces created for them are designed to be suitably inclusive. Hajer's (2003)
notion of `citizens on stand-by' also implies the presence of citizens who are already
technically equipped to engage but simply need to be `ignited'. This is an understandable
bias within bodies of work that make important contributions to understanding political
and policy action. However, the lacuna in accounting for the process of becoming a com-
petent citizen represents a significant gap for understanding the `end-of-the-pipe' mobi-
lisation of `ordinary' (here meaning not previously politically active) citizens in
policy-political spaces. In the next section, I further explore aspects of this gap by con-
sidering the identity of the `good citizen' in contemporary planning practice.
The `good citizen' in planning practice
In this section of the article, my focus shifts from the theoretical to the empirical.
Recognising that both deliberative and agonistic planning theories are rooted in critique
of actually existing democratic practices, my aim is not to develop an empiricist critique
of the potential for emergence of either the agonistic or deliberative citizen. However, by
contrasting these models of democracy against prevailing modes of citizen-subject for-
mation, I argue that it is possible to assess some of their critical potential and limitations.
Moreover, this empirical encounter also reveals often hidden dimensions of the chal-
lenges faced by `ordinary citizens' seeking to influence planning decisions.
The context of this search for the subject of a new democratic ethos is the recently
reformed land-use planning system in Scotland. This section of the article therefore
draws on two related projects. The background analysis is informed by a research project
that investigated the `culture change' agenda that has accompanied a concerted pro-
gramme of reform to the planning system since the reopening of a Scottish Parliament
through devolution within the United Kingdom in 1999 (Inch, 2013). The bulk of the
argument, however, reflects my ongoing involvement with a charity called Planning
Democracy (PD) that campaigns for a fair and inclusive planning system in Scotland.
This campaign has been informed by a project that gathered `citizens' stories' of partici-
pating in the reformed planning system, using these to make the case for change (see
Planning Democracy, 2012).
The idea of collecting `citizens' stories' can be understood as an application of plan-
ning theory's productive engagement with story as a means of learning from and about
planning practices (e.g. Forester, 1999; Sandercock, 2003). All of the stories collected
involved citizens active within community groups who had mobilised against unwanted
Inch 411
development, typically they had formed to fight `end-of-the-pipe' battles against major
development with significant environmental impacts. In total, more than 20 stories were
collected from a wide variety of geographical and socio-economic contexts, including
communities living next to existing and proposed waste facilities, power stations, mines
and quarries in the heavily populated `central belt' between Edinburgh and Glasgow;
major container terminal and bridge developments up the east coast of Scotland; and
controversial, large-scale housing proposals in and around existing settlements (Planning
Democracy, 2012).
Citizens were invited to narrate their experiences chronologically, reflecting on key
moments in their engagement with the planning system. Most stories were collected
through meetings in people's homes where notes were taken that were later written up
and where possible sent to participants to check. In some other cases, citizens provided a
written account of their own experiences. Methods were dictated by available resources,
a desire to make participants feel comfortable talking to us, and the aim of growing
Planning Democracy's network rather than by the imperatives of generating academic
research material. As a result, the stories generated were not recorded or transcribed,
limiting the material available for subsequent writing-up and meaning, unfortunately,
that citizens' `voices' cannot readily be recounted here.
The stories collected were deliberately subjective and do not represent an exhaus-
tively detailed account of participating in Scottish planning. However, those involved
have confirmed that they faithfully reflect their often striking experiences of being
`ignited'as citizens in the planning process in Scotland, and the particular details reported
here have been checked by several of those involved to ensure that they are true to their
experiences. Below, I first discuss the ways in which `good' and `bad' forms of citizen-
ship are defined by the dominant culture of the planning system. I then explore how this
shapes the experiences of citizens seeking to influence development.
Pro-growth planning, depoliticisation and the management of citizens
The land-use planning system in Scotland underwent major reform with the passing of
the Planning Etc. Scotland Act in 2006, the first time the Scottish Government had made
use of new powers to pass primary legislation in relation to planning since devolution.
As in reform initiatives elsewhere a range of diverse goals motivated change. Central to
the rhetoric of reform, however, were two key, potentially contradictory goals: to speed
up decision-making in the interests of economic efficiency and to improve public partici-
pation in the system.
While the government has acknowledged a tension between these goals, the balance
between them has rarely been explicitly debated. However, since the onset of recession and
the election of a Scottish Nationalist Party (SNP) administration `sustainable economic
growth' has been further prioritised as the overarching purpose of the planning system
(Scottish Government, 2010). The hegemonic position of pro-growth planning means that
development is effectively synonymous with the public interest, the primary good that the
planning system should seek to promote. This suggests that participation is subordinate to
the goal of pursuing light touch planning and ensuring that any perceived `costs of delay'
in decision-making are minimised in the interests of development and growth.
412 Planning Theory 14(4)
The commitment to development as a public good effectively elevates a conception of
the good above democratic rights to decide where the public interest lies in the use and
development of land. In this context, continued commitment to the language of participa-
tion, while remaining necessary to legitimize decisions, requires careful management.
This is a familiar feature of attempts to incorporate citizens into decision-making, creat-
ing tendencies towards tokenistic participation that is only able to recognise citizens'
rights to a voice when it does not threaten the fundamental commitment to pro-growth
planning. More recently, this has been characterised as part of a post-political form of
planning, where the hegemony of growth requires the displacement of the political ener-
gies that can be generated when citizens mobilise against development (e.g. Gunder and
Hillier, 2009). The management of this settlement through the participatory and repre-
sentative democratic spaces in the Scottish planning system therefore draws on a range
of what Cruikshank (1999) terms `technologies of citizenship' as it seeks to define the
`good' citizen. Two key examples can illustrate the workings of such technologies: `the
education of the "good" citizen' and `labelling practices'.
Educating the `good citizen'. Professionals have long expressed anxiety about the compe-
tence of non-experts to make planning decisions (cf. Damer and Hague, 1971). In Scot-
land, this has led to a renewed focus on the need to `educate' citizens and elected
representatives not just about the logic of the system but how much they should expect
to influence its decisions. This is apparent in the work of Planning Aid Scotland (PAS),
an organisation that provides an important free planning advice service through a net-
work of professional volunteers. As a body increasingly reliant on government funding
for its operations, however, PAS has become concerned to reconcile the public to the
realities of pro-growth planning:
PAS believes that effective engagement must lie at the heart of the Scotland's planning system
... However, PAS equally recognises that efficiency and effectiveness in supporting sustainable
economic growth is paramount. It is for this reason ... that PAS wishes to put before the
committee its concern that public expectations of the planning system are being insufficiently
managed in terms of opportunities and rights to oppose planning decisions. (PAS, 2012)
The idea of `managing public expectations' makes clear a desire to promote certain
forms of participation. The education of citizens becomes less an effort to empower them
to influence democratic planning decisions and more an exercise in `positioning' such
that they will play the role of the `good citizen'that the system makes up for them: active
citizenship is therefore encouraged as long as it does not become `activist' and threaten
to frustrate development activity (cf. Newman, 2011).
Labelling practices. In the logic of a system that seeks to legitimise development and where
expressions of oppositional citizenship are viewed as problematic, it is common for citi-
zens to find themselves `labelled'or `positioned'in ways that undermine the legitimacy of
their voice (Healey, 2012). The most widely used example of this in planning disputes is
the label `NIMBY', dismissing opposition to development as parochial and self-interested
(Burningham, 2000; McClymont and O'Hare, 2008). In addition, however, professionals
Inch 413
often question the representativeness of citizens' voices by reference to those who do
participate as `the usual suspects', a group of typically well-educated and resourced citi-
zens disproportionately able to pursue their particular interests.
The `usual suspects' are often contrasted against the spectre of the `silent majority'
whose interests professionals make claims to represent, often equating this with the ben-
efits that development may bring. Such labelling practices are widespread within plan-
ning professionals' discussions of citizens who participate in Scotland; however, there is
typically less scrutiny of the `interests' or `representativeness' of other actors, for exam-
ple, developers, professionals themselves or elected politicians.
As with any such label, the element of potential truth within it (there may well be
NIMBY opponents, `silent majorities' and `usual suspects') detracts attention from the
political operation of such categories and the ways in which they serve to marginalise
certain voices, restricting citizens to certain compromised subject positions:5 those who
participate are narrowly self-interested and therefore do not need to be listened to; the
views of those who do not participate can be inferred by professional or political `repre-
sentatives' as the authentic voice of the `ordinary' citizen. As Clarke (2010) suggests,
governmental strategies to enrol the moral authority of `ordinary citizens' into decision-
making therefore produce a politics of claim-making where the power to speak as/for the
`ordinary citizen' is a key stake. In this way, as Pløger (2004) notes, the logic of
the system is involved in constructing its own enemies and/ or refusing to recognise the
legitimacy of adversarial perspectives.
These examples outline two of the ways in which the hegemonic position of sustain-
able economic growth is defended through the use of technologies of citizenship: the
education of citizens and labelling practices are techniques that limit the legitimacy of
political challenges raised by end-of-the-pipe citizen mobilisation by predetermining
both `good' and `bad' subject positions for citizens. Below I consider such practices
against the experiences of citizens who have sought to influence change through the
planning system, highlighting how people seek to resist the always uncertain power of
such technologies of citizenship and questioning the potential consequences of their
deployment, both for those involved and for the democratic legitimacy of planning
decisions.
Becoming a planning citizen
Being `ignited': issues, interests and values
Hajer's (2003) concept of `citizens on stand-by' suggests that the Scottish Government's
key aim of promoting a less adversarial planning culture by promoting earlier engage-
ment of the public does not readily correspond to the ways citizens typically come to be
`ignited' by issues. This was certainly true of the majority of citizens and groups whose
stories PD heard. Most were not `active citizens' aware of their rights and the opportuni-
ties available. They typically had little experience of political engagement or planning,
sharing a broadly negative view of politics and often not understanding their actions as
`political'. Many felt they had not chosen to get involved but had been summoned by the
unexpected news that an application for development had been made close to where they
414 Planning Theory 14(4)
lived. All were therefore part of a series of publics called into being by specific issues
with significant local impacts (Dewey, 1989; Leino and Laine, 2011). As such, their
engagement was inherently adversarial, activated by their concern and typically opposi-
tion to the development in question.
Most of those PD met were homeowners, suggesting that this may be one key factor
in shaping a sense of stake in the local environment; however, the preservation of prop-
erty values was rarely cited as a primary motive for mobilisation in their respective
local campaigns. Instead, a variety of factors seemed to have motivated citizens to react:
this included the disruption of valued place qualities (such as the loss of centuries old
rights of way used by crofting communities in the vicinity of a nuclear power plant in
the Highlands; or of public parks whose protected `Common Good' land status was
threatened in Edinburgh), through to the health concerns that motivated citizens to react
against the proposed development of energy-from-waste facilities (incinerators) in the
central belt.
Many citizens had become acutely aware of how others (including professionals and
developers) sought to label their campaigns in terms of narrow self-interest and were
anxious to refute such a reductive categorisation, feeling that it denied their right to care
for the place they lived in or to articulate concern about issues raised by development.
One citizen who had waged a long-running campaign to have alternative economic
development opportunities included in their local plan, only for a developer to win
approval for an incinerator against community wishes, eloquently argued,
We did everything `by the book', followed all the appropriate procedures and yet we are going
to be worse off than if we had never engaged with the Development Plan process, while the
incinerator developer completely circumvented the process and the planning system supported
approval of the application ... We are not Nimbys in this scenario ...
This highlights both a high degree of frustration with the process but also engagement
with a politics of recognition as she sought to contest the subject-positions she felt the
system positioned her in.
People often spoke of the emotional impacts involved in sustaining protracted cam-
paigns, highlighting how deeply committed they had become to the issues in question.
Such commitments seem to consist of a complex mixture of perceived interests along-
side sometimes deeply held beliefs and previously unacknowledged and emergent under-
standing of their own values. As in many aspects of life, these values sometimes
encompass contradictory hopes, anxieties and concerns for their future, those of their
families and wider locality. The process of being ignited had often led people to under-
stand not just the issues involved, but their local area and themselves in new ways. For
example, citizens ignited by another incinerator proposal in the central belt moved from
very immediate concerns for the health of their children and those of their neighbours to
active engagement with the perceived failings of local politics through to the need for
new national and European policy to make sure that other communities would not face
the same problems. This highlights how a limited focus on participants as rational actors
pursuing their self-interest cannot do justice to the complex realities of being `ignited'
and illustrates the need to understand the identity of citizens who mobilise against
Inch 415
development not as fixed and pre-existing but as at least somewhat fluid and emergent in
relation to the issues involved, drawing from previous life experiences, current life cir-
cumstances and understandings of possible futures.
Knowledge, tactics and resources
For all of those involved, the process of being `ignited', however reluctantly, had led to
a challenging period of learning for which few felt adequately equipped. Most spoke of
this as an ongoing struggle to understand how to influence decisions. In some places, this
was rendered easier by the presence of professional residents with knowledge of plan-
ning and an expectation that they were entitled to participate. In a couple of high-profile
cases, non-governmental organisations (NGOs) provided further support and expertise.
In at least one more working-class community with a long history of living with environ-
mentally intrusive land-uses, people spoke of a strong cultural barrier that needed to be
overcome because protesting `just isn't the kind of thing we do around here'. This illus-
trates how certain citizens and communities (typically professional and middle class) are
likely to be better equipped to represent themselves, or how others may be empowered
to do so if an issue becomes a cause celebre. However, for all, this remained a major
challenge.
All of those PD met sought to engage and influence planning decisions through the
windows of opportunity afforded by the system, making and encouraging written repre-
sentations, and attending relevant committee meetings (though in Scotland it is rare for
the public to be given the right to speak at such meetings). The process of navigating the
system was, however, characterised by considerable confusion and frustration, involving
multiple wrong turns and the investment of large amounts of time and energy into letter
writing and research that could later prove entirely ineffective. All also spoke of an
incredibly steep and energy sapping learning curve as they spent their evenings and
weekends gaining the expertise they needed to frame arguments that would be valid in
`planning terms'. Most felt that they were constantly struggling to keep abreast with
developments that seemed to proceed behind their backs as developers and local plan-
ning authorities met. As one of the anti-incinerator campaigners introduced above sug-
gested, `We felt like we were getting on the train at the last stop, everyone else is more
prepared, decisions seem to be already made'.
Engaging in these official forms of deliberative activity was time consuming and
laborious, and involved community members communicating on the terms set by the
expert driven system. Many, sensing or experiencing real limits to the effectiveness of
this approach, also sought to register their opposition in other ways, organising commu-
nity meetings and protests outside council meetings or on election days, seeking to gain
local press coverage through direct action (e.g. by blocking roads with slow moving traf-
fic or organising mass Christmas card writing campaigns to the Scottish Government).
Citizens often felt that such forms of activism were more successful in generating popu-
lar pressure, politicising issues and challenging elected representatives. However, the
planning system often remained impervious to such pressures. In a third campaign
against an incinerator, the local community generated some 5000 objections influencing
the local authority's decision to refuse the application, only for the applicant to
416 Planning Theory 14(4)
successfully appeal to the Scottish Government (even had the original decision been
upheld, in Scotland this would not have prevented the applicant from simply submitting
a revised scheme for the same site, potentially requiring a rerun of the entire process,
something that many communities lived in real fear of given the time and energy
required).
Campaigns and relationship building
Organising a campaign group often brought people together and created new attach-
ments within local communities. However, the membership and strength of groups was
typically unstable, tending to dwindle over the extended life of many campaigns. Most
campaigns seemed to be sustained by the persistence of a small group of committed
volunteers who sought to mobilise others as and when possible to generate funds or write
representations. The framing of campaigns typically involved the articulation of a claim
to represent a particular place and its qualities. This was not always accepted without
contestation, and in certain cases, disputes did develop between those for and against
certain developments. This was particularly visible in the case of the park in Edinburgh
where `Common Good'land was proposed as the site of a new school ­ splitting the local
community and leading to a long-running and often bitterly contested struggle, including
attempts to publicly `name and shame' opponents of the development.
As noted above, in some cases, NGO support provided links that could reinforce citi-
zens' knowledge and ability to represent themselves. Online and personal communica-
tion with other campaign groups fighting against similar developments were also
common. However, even where citizens developed wider concerns for the issues raised
(e.g. the development of incinerators), for most, the focus of their campaign remained
necessarily local, bound by the specific proposal involved and the logic of a planning
system that is focused on site-specific decision-making (cf. Rootes, 2007).
Relations between campaign groups and local authorities were mixed and often
related to past experiences and the authority's view of the development in question.
While many sought to keep lines of communication open and relations amicable, few
found planning officers sympathetic or willing to act as `guerillas in the bureaucracy' on
their behalf (cf. Gonzalez and Vigar, 2008). Relations with elected representatives were
also often characterised by a general culture (and some specific histories) of mistrust.
Sometimes they were also frustrated by rules that limit elected officials to a quasi-
judicial role in making planning decisions, preventing them from responding to many
community concerns or speaking publicly about issues they will later vote on.
In many cases, there seemed to be a tendency towards seeing officials in oppositional
terms, viewing `them' and `the system' with considerable suspicion and campaigners
regularly complained about the use of delaying tactics and misinformation to frustrate
their activities (including e.g. local authorities `losing' large numbers of objections or
announcing consultation periods during school holidays).
Some groups sought to engage with developers and in return certain developers too
were willing to reciprocate, sending representatives to meet with concerned citizens.
However, it was more typical for relations of mistrust to characterise this relationship, with
neither `side' willing to `reveal their hand' and each apparently withholding information
Inch 417
from the other. Faced with concerted local opposition, moreover, communities often
reported that developers employed a variety of coercive strategies. These ranged from the
employment of public relations specialists to conduct consultation exercises, to an unwill-
ingness to release background data (often by invoking `commercial confidentiality'),
through to the issuing of threats of legal action against named members of community
councils opposing projects. For example, in the case of the community who had cam-
paigned positively for alternatives only for an incinerator application to be approved, a
threat by the developer to pursue legal action against campaigners led them to abandon a
possible Judicial Review of the decision. Practices of this sort clearly sit outside any norms
of democratic planning yet are rarely subjected to scrutiny.
Public participation, private lives
One of the striking aspects of all the stories was the extent to which campaigns became
a key part of people's lives, taking up large amounts of time and energy, often over a
period of years. Citizens' reported not feeling able to go on holiday for several years for
fear that the next stage of a process would be announced and their opportunity to respond
be gone by the time they returned. Some (who could) invested large amounts of money
to fund the expertise required to participate effectively (e.g. planning, technical or legal
advice), for most, this required intensive fundraising efforts. Others, dealing with the
threat of legal action from developers, had to consider the possible consequences of their
involvement. Many found it hard to reconcile the impacts that these battles had on their
jobs, businesses, family lives and even their health. These more private `costs of political
participation' are rarely discussed in considerations of citizen mobilisation, yet here they
were central and often played a critical role in people's capacity to sustain engagement.
The costs of participation also influenced people's subsequent disposition towards politi-
cal activity. The high levels of attrition found among community groups should be
understood in this context ­ many people simply give up making space for such exhaust-
ing activity.
Trajectories of political engagement
For some of those involved, their engagement had led them to remain politically active
in planning matters, becoming proactively engaged in future rounds of local plan-
making. Among the case studies, there were also examples of citizens who had gone on
to studies in higher education for the first time, and others whose local engagement led
to extensive engagement in national level debates. Some, becoming expert in particular
issues, had joined wider activist networks or environmental NGOs to challenge the pol-
icy positions that made certain forms of development acceptable (e.g. in the case
recounted above to question whether incineration is a waste disposal method that should
be acceptable in Scotland).
For many others, however, the experience proved disempowering, provoking feel-
ings of loss and even leading to anxiety states. Some, disabused of an implicit faith that
the system would prove transparent and reasonable, became somewhat cynical or mis-
trustful. Others, sometimes with long-running histories of alienation from officialdom,
418 Planning Theory 14(4)
found their hostility towards the local state reinforced. This was not necessarily directly
related to the result of the process. Some groups were `successful' (at least temporarily,
or were lucky enough that the proposed development did not materialise for e.g. com-
mercial reasons); however, nearly all reported profound frustration and a sense that their
voices were not listened to. Most would have shared the view of one citizen who,
reflecting on a long campaign against a major biomass development on the east coast,
suggested the process had left him `exhausted, disillusioned and frustrated'. Lying
beneath this was a feeling that the process was not transparent or accountable and that
decisions were less the product of democratic processes than of a deeply unjust system
designed to ensure that development was imposed on local communities regardless of
their views.
Discussion: in search of the subject of a new democratic
ethos
Having considered what is required of the citizen as a democratic actor in planning the-
ory and then outlined the reality of some citizens' experiences of becoming politically
engaged in contemporary planning disputes, in this section of the article, I consider what
has been learned from this search for the subject of a new democratic ethos. As I do so, I
consider the implications this has for further research and thinking about the relationship
between citizenship and democratisation of the politics of planning.
Citizens' stories of becoming politically active in Scotland's planning system high-
light that both deliberative and agonistic conceptions of planning citizenship remain nor-
mative ideals, operating at a remove from the rules that govern actually existing planning
practices. These rules seem set up as a series of defences that protect an overarching
commitment to development as a public good. The commitment to development is dem-
ocratically determined by the Scottish Government, yet its legitimacy is limited and pro-
posals often draw out tensions in citizens'willingness to accept this understanding of the
public interest. These tensions emerge as end-of-the-pipe conflict, and drawing out dif-
ferent expectations as to how the development of land should be governed. However, the
cases gathered by PD in Scotland suggest that the ambiguous language of participation
struggles to provide either an effective means of neutralising this conflict or meaningful
opportunities to democratise decision-making.
Citizens `ignited' in response to planning issues in Scotland often draw on elements
of both deliberative and agonistic political practice. As deliberative citizens they produce
written representations and seek opportunities to engage in dialogue with decision-
makers. However, the inequality of arms between citizens and professionals ensures that
deliberation is neither fair nor inclusive. Some groups of citizens also therefore engage
in direct action designed to influence representative decision-makers ­ a more agonistic
form of political practice. However, the planning system is also set up to defend against
such raw political energies. In short, those summoned by the planning system in Scotland
are not currently invited to participate as either deliberative or agonistic citizens.
The hegemonic position of pro-growth planning in Scotland means that there are seem-
ingly very few advocates for more democratic planning at present. The effects of reces-
sion and ongoing reform initiatives have consolidated acceptance of the overarching
Inch 419
imperative of growth. This has led to a focus on improving efficiency in decision-making
and on developing relations between local authorities and the development sector in order
to facilitate development more effectively ­ building cultures within which the politicisa-
tion of plans or proposals through representative or participatory democratic channels
readily comes to be seen as a problem that must be defended against (Inch, 2013).
In contrast to the mobilisation of systemic defences against potentially disruptive
challenges to pro-growth planning, both deliberative and agonistic theories of planning
therefore retain critical potential: each is capable of highlighting failures in the
democratic quality of existing decision-making. Notwithstanding differences in the dem-
ocratic ethos each would seek to cultivate, for advocates of either deliberative or agonis-
tic planning democracy, there is a need to bridge the gap between theory and practice in
order to argue for the further democratisation of planning democracy, challenging the
limited ways in which citizens are currently invited to participate and pushing to
strengthen rights to democratic participation against the hegemonic claims of (neo)lib-
eral private property rights. One key challenge for such advocates is to work through the
limitations of current approaches to participation to highlight the failure of existing dem-
ocratic channels, using this as a basis from which to argue for change. From this perspec-
tive, the agonistic emphasis on contestation and struggle in unsettling existing settlements
and constituting new claims for democratisation seems particularly important.
Indeed, from the experiences recounted above, an agonistic mode of planning citizen-
ship perhaps offers a more promising account of citizens' initial mobilisation in end-of-
the-pipe planning disputes. In such cases, citizens define themselves through the
articulation of lines of difference between `them'(developers and often local authorities)
and `us'(claiming to represent a local community). In establishing such adversarial posi-
tions, there is a confrontation between very different logics of appropriate action: that of
the market-led planning system and that of citizens staking a claim to democratically
influence development that affects their lives. However, too strong an attachment to such
`them' and `us' identities may also militate against effective relationship building and
risk sliding into intransigent, cynical or antagonistic position-taking that can foreclose
other, more deliberative possibilities (Healey, 2012). This suggests a need to further
explore how citizens can harness the agonistic qualities of end-of-the-pipe conflict and
yet shape forms of policy-politics that remain alive to the possibilities of deliberation.
The experiences of citizens and their struggles for recognition within the planning sys-
tem in Scotland also therefore reaffirm a need for normative theories of democratic plan-
ning to further consider the qualities they require of the citizen and how these might be
actively fostered.
Going further, however, these citizens'experiences highlight that the heroic figures of
the agonistic activist and the reasonable deliberator present only a partial picture of the
qualities required by the everyday politics of many planning disputes. As noted above,
existing literature tends to stress how already ignited political actors adopt a mix of tac-
tics to pursue their goals: sometimes participating as good deliberative citizens but at
other times adopting more agonistic forms of political practice. The citizens' stories that
PD collected provide further evidence to endorse such an approach. However, they also
highlight the struggles experienced by ordinary citizens as they mobilise and seek to
understand how they can influence planning decisions. Most were not self-consciously
420 Planning Theory 14(4)
political actors who thought of themselves as activists (indeed, in many cases, this was
definitely not how they understood themselves); their process of `ignition' was far from
automatic. Rather, they were `reactive citizens', struggling to learn and explore a reper-
toire of practices that often sorely tested their knowledge, resources and persistence. If
`ordinary' citizens' experiences represent an increasingly significant form of political
engagement in `precariously democratic societies' (Forester, 1989: 3), then it seems cru-
cial to learn from them to inform campaigns for better democratic planning.
In general, localised, end-of-the-pipe mobilisation has tended to be viewed with some
suspicion. Within planning, it is often casually equated with NIMBYism and related
mistrust of the motivations of those involved, for example, the potentially perverse
effects of intensive local opposition displacing problems onto others less able to repre-
sent their interests (concerns that may sometimes be well placed but should also not be
universally assumed). This has often been part of a justification for attempts to involve
people early on in the production of plans and strategies, i.e. before site-specific conflicts
emerge. Less technocratically, within urban environmental politics and social movement
studies, local mobilisations are often seen as lacking progressive credentials where they
do not readily `jump scale'to provide a broader challenge to economic or state structures
(Rootes, 2007), with radical potential only existing where universal claims emerge from
particular struggles (Griggs and Howarth, 2008).
As Hajer (2003) suggests, the increasingly pervasive nature of end-of-the-pipe mobi-
lisation suggests a need to find ways of working with the intensive political energy that
can emerge at the local level. More than this, however, there is also a need to further
understand the democratic subjects who emerge in such spaces, accepting that the `activ-
ist' figure familiar in much academic writing does not immediately fit with the self-
understanding and behaviour of many `ordinary citizens' who find themselves in such
circumstances (cf. Jupp, 2012 on other forms of `everyday' or `ordinary' activism). The
experiences PD collected show how the intensely local dynamics of planning conflicts
can generate very different trajectories of personal political engagement. With reference
to planning theory's long-standing interest in planning as a process of social learning
(Friedmann, 1987), this suggests a need for further research to understand the `learning
curve' involved in becoming a planning citizen, the different trajectories such political
mobilisation can generate and what motivates the journeys taken by different citizens.
Further work might also develop a more empirically rich understanding of the longer
term dynamics generated by local planning conflicts, considering when and under what
circumstances end-of-the-pipe involvement might lead on to either involvement at more
strategic levels of planning or to the articulation of more `universal' political claims.
The stories collected by PD also highlighted the mobilisation of strong political ener-
gies that `gripped' people in more than simply self-interested or purely cognitive ways.
The refusal of the planning process to acknowledge and work with such emotional con-
cerns severely limits the potential to do justice to such energies. Instead, they are often
displaced onto the private lives of those involved or occasionally reflected back into
conflicts within local communities. The high costs of political participation borne by
those citizens who mobilise through the planning system are, however, rarely addressed
within existing literature. This omission detracts attention from a major set of impacts
that require greater scrutiny, potentially reconfiguring understanding of the `mediating'
Inch 421
responsibilities of public professionals in managing the suffering and harm that planning
processes can generate. That the experience of struggle imposes often unreasonable
demands on citizens also presents a salutary corrective to any tendency to romanticise
the agonistic emphasis on conflict, highlighting a need for a form of democratic planning
that can also care for the citizens it engages, fully considering what `respectful disagree-
ment' should mean for all participants. Given that another significant outlet for unac-
knowledged emotional energy may be its projection onto the local state, this also raises
questions about the long-term impacts that the operation of `systemic defences' may
have on the legitimacy of democratic planning (cf. Inch, 2012).
Although jarring with the long-standing assertion that planning is political rather
than the preserve of any specialist technical expertise, pervasive anxieties about the
capacities and interests of the citizens (and elected representatives) who do engage
suggest wariness about entrusting decisions to democratic processes. For many, the
opening up of planning decisions to a more nakedly and passionately political process
may threaten good decision-making or risk empowering already privileged groups to
pursue reactionary interests. Such concerns further highlight the responsibility of plan-
ners to recognise and find ways to channel the political energies that planning issues
generate.
While Huxley and Yiftachel (2000) are surely right to argue that planning is about
more than decision-rules, the debate between an agonistic opening up of disagree-
ment and a deliberative desire for consensus at some level does revolve around creat-
ing legitimate procedures for taking decisions, recognising as Mansbridge (1996)
argues that there are necessarily coercive elements to democratic decision-making.
Debate must then revolve around who wins and who loses from any given set of
rules, who is coerced, how, when and why. Within this picture, enhanced procedural
rights are not a sufficient condition for just planning (Porter, 2014), but they remain
necessary as part of a struggle to democratise decisions about the use and develop-
ment of land in established liberal democracies. Indeed, many of the stories that PD
heard highlight the importance of a sense of procedural justice to citizens operating
within such spaces.
The argument I have developed here further suggests that procedural rules must also
recognise that they make a wider range of demands of citizens than has typically been
acknowledged. Arguably, existing theories too readily assert the virtues of democratic
citizenship while paying less attention to the demands they make of citizens. In practice
meanwhile, rules often seem concerned to defend a commitment to development as a
public good rather than foster robust and inclusive debate about how places should
develop. As a result, planning processes do little to engage the energies citizens bring
while often imposing significant hidden costs on them.
Conclusion
In this article, I have explored what democratic planning requires of the citizens it would
seek to engage. Outlining requirements of the deliberative and agonistic citizen, I have
argued that much existing theory does not fully acknowledge the demands it would make
of these ideal citizen-subjects and has therefore sidestepped a significant challenge for
422 Planning Theory 14(4)
the project of shaping more democratic planning practices. Tracing this through into
practice, I have highlighted how various `technologies of citizenship' can be used to
defend against the potentially disruptive effects of end-of-the-pipe citizen mobilisation
within pro-growth planning cultures. By listening to the experiences of citizens ignited
by such end-of-the-pipe struggles, I have sought to highlight ways in which agonistic and
deliberative planning theories retain both critical potential and limitations. However,
beyond this, I have suggested that citizens' experiences raise further issues that have not
been widely considered in existing debates. Drawing attention to the presence of a range
of hidden costs, I have argued that they raise significant questions about the demands that
are made of people in the name of democracy. In doing so, I have pointed to the need for
further consideration of what political participation requires of citizens, the forms of
democratic learning that they engage in and the broader significance of their political
participation. Overall, the experiences of the `ordinary citizens' drawn on here point
towards a different, as yet unacknowledged demand, a demand for democratic planning
processes that can care for the citizens they summon while fully and fairly engaging the
political energies they bring. It is a demand that remains to be addressed in both theory
and practice.

Notes
1. For example, Forester (1999) focuses at length on the skills required of the `deliberative prac-
titioner', but there is no corollary for the deliberative citizen.
2. It is important to note that Habermas' (1996) theory assumes that true deliberation can only
be achieved by the wider transformation of late capitalist societies.
3. Connolly's (1995) account of agonistic pluralism may provide a useful corrective here though
his focus is on the development of an ethos rather than how decisions might be made.
4. For example, both deliberative and agonistic theorists share an assumption that good citizen-
ship involves active participation ­ potentially at odds with citizens who do not feel the need
to participate outside of traditional electoral channels. As one reviewer suggested, this may
be another category of citizen absent from much planning theory.
