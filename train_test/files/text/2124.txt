ABSTRACT
DUNTON, G. F., D. BERRIGAN, R. BALLARD-BARBASH, B. I. GRAUBARD, and A. A. ATIENZA. Environmental Influences
on Exercise Intensity and Duration in a U.S. Time Use Study. Med. Sci. Sports Exerc., Vol. 41, No. 9, pp. 1698­1705, 2009.
Purpose: Rising rates of physical inactivity and obesity in the United States highlight the critical need to identify contexts and settings
that are conducive to the promotion of recreational physical activity. The current study investigated whether the intensity and duration
of sports and exercise bouts differ across physical and social environments as reported in a nationally representative time use survey of
U.S. adults. Methods: From the American Time Use Survey (years 2003­2006), adult participants (ages Q21 yr) who reported at least
one bout of sports or exercise on the previous day were selected (N = 7700). For each exercise bout, respondents reported the activity
type, its duration (in minutes), its location (e.g., outdoors, home, work, health club/gym), and with whom it occurred (e.g., alone, family
members, coworkers, friends/acquaintances). Sample-weighted logistic and linear regression analyses examined differences in intensity
expressed as METs (moderate, 3.0­6.0 METs; vigorous, 96.0 METs) and in duration of exercise bouts across environments. Results:
Vigorous-intensity exercise was more likely when the bout occurred alone as compared with other social situations (P values G 0.001)
and when at a gym/health club and at home as compared with outdoors (P values G 0.001). For both moderate and vigorous activities,
exercise bouts were shorter when exercising alone versus with family members, friends/acquaintances, or multiple categories (P values G
0.001). Mean duration of exercise bouts was greater when exercising outdoors than when exercising at home, work, or at gym/health
club (P values G 0.001). Conclusions: Nationally representative time use data for U.S. adults suggest that the intensity and duration of
exercise bouts are differentially affected by social contexts and physical settings. Key Words: SOCIAL FACTORS, HOME, WORK,
OUTDOORS, SPORTS, POPULATION STUDY
Despite the health risks of physical inactivity and
sedentary behavior (26), most adults do not engage
in recommended levels of physical activity (22).
Promoting leisure time recreational sports and exercise is a
promising way to increase activity levels, as it accounts for
an estimated 60%­70% of physical activity reported among
adults (32). There has been increasing support for the role
of social and physical environmental factors in recreational
physical activity (14,28,35). Research has shown that the
availability and accessibility of environmental resources
and social support are positively associated with leisure
time physical activity levels in adults (7,8). However, little
is known about which types of physical settings and social
contexts are more conducive to recreational sports and
exercise, especially in terms of their impact on the intensity
and duration of individual exercise bouts. Policies and
programs to promote physical activity at the population
level could benefit from information about how social

features and physical settings influence the parameters of
activities taking place in those contexts.
A small body of intervention and observational research
has examined the impact of the immediate social context
and physical setting on exercise behavior. For example, a
home-based exercise program for obese women had a
greater impact on long-term exercise participation, adher-
ence, and weight loss compared with a group-based
program held at a clinic facility (25). Also, older adults
participating in an overground walking training program
had more favorable attitudes and found exercise more
enjoyable compared with a treadmill training group (21). In
a study using experience sampling, children reported more
intense physical activity when they were with their peers
and close friends (30). Research comparing self-selected
activity intensities of various tasks found differences
between home and laboratory settings (44). Taken together,
this evidence suggests that physical activity performance
varies across contexts. However, the ability to draw
meaningful conclusions from this research is limited by
the focus on only a small number of settings and use of
nonrepresentative samples.
Time use studies offer a novel approach to overcoming
challenges associated with studying the effects of different
environments on physical activity. Time use surveys
sequentially assess the type and duration of all activities
that a person performs across the day (using diary or short-
term recall) and are commonly used by sociologists and
economists to describe human behavior patterns (5,18,32).
An advantage of time use survey methodology is that
exposure to and use of environments can be temporally
linked to specific behaviors (i.e., the interview assesses
where and with whom behavior occurs throughout the day).
The American Time Use Survey (ATUS), which uses a
nationally representative U.S. sample, has been recently
used to study walking behaviors (37) and demographic and
temporal patterns in the use of social and physical environ-
ments for sports and exercise (12).
The current study used data from the ATUS to examine
whether the intensity and duration of sports and exercise
bouts performed by U.S. adults differ across social and
physical environments. Several hypotheses were tested.
First, on the basis of the evidence showing a favorable
impact of social interactions on physical activity intensity
(30) and adherence (9), it was hypothesized that the
intensity and duration of exercise bouts occurring with
friends/acquaintances, family members, or coworkers would
be greater than exercise occurring alone. Second, prior
research suggests that people often prefer to exercise
outdoors (42) and that there is a positive association
between time spent outdoors and overall physical activity
level (21). Therefore, it was hypothesized that outdoor
environments would have a favorable impact on exercise
performance. We expected that exercise occurring outdoors
would be greater in intensity and duration than exercise
occurring in any other physical environments. We took an
exploratory approach to comparing exercise intensity and
duration among bouts performed with family, friends/
acquaintances, and coworkers as well as among bouts
performed at home, at work, and at a gym/health club,
mainly due to a lack of prior research on these contexts.
METHODS
ATUS procedures. The ATUS is sponsored by the
Bureau of Labor and Statistics and conducted by the U.S.
Census Bureau (http://www.bls.gov/tus/). It uses a strati-
fied, three-stage survey design to measure time use patterns
in a nationally representative sample of individuals (ages 15
yr and older). To obtain reliable estimates and adequate
sample size, the survey oversampled weekend days and
some demographic groups (e.g., households with Hispanics
or non-Hispanic Blacks, households with children). Within
each selected household, a telephone interview was
conducted with a single randomly chosen individual to
assess time use on the previous day. The reporting day was
randomly preassigned to the household. To encourage
households without a telephone to call to complete the
survey, they received a $40 debit card in the mail. The
ATUS, which is collected through the Census Bureau, does
not release identifiable participant information to the public
and is not subject to institutional review board approval.
Authorization to collect the ATUS is granted by the U.S.
Office of Management and Budget.
Trained ATUS interviewers used a Computer-Assisted
Telephone Interviewing system to pose a series of stan-
dardized questions designed to lead the respondent through
the recall of the previous day. Respondents were asked to
sequentially describe each activity and its duration for the
24-h period beginning at 4:00 a.m. Follow-up questions
assessed where and with whom each activity occurred. Each
interview lasted approximately 15 to 20 min.
Study sample. To obtain reliable estimates of activity
across different times of the day and days of the week, data
from the 2003­2006 surveys were combined in the current
study. Only respondents aged Q21 yr and reporting at least
one bout of sports or exercise were included in the analyses.
Data treatment. ATUS interviewers at the telephone
center assigned a six-digit classification code to each
activity (31). The present study focused on activities coded
as participating in sports, exercise, or recreation (General
Activity Category) within sports, exercise, and recreation
(Major Activity Category). Walking (for exercise) and
hiking fell into this categorization scheme. Other walking
or biking activities coded under traveling (General Activity
Category), household, nonhousehold (Major Activity Cate-
gory), or volunteer activities (Major Activity Category)
were not examined in this study. Likewise, moderate-
intensity physical activities performed for nonrecreational
purposes (e.g., transportation, occupation, household
chores) were not included in these analyses.

Activity intensity expressed in METs was calculated
using a scheme that links the ATUS variables to the
Compendium of Physical Activities (1,38) (http://riskfactor.
cancer.gov/tools/atus-met/). Activity intensity levels were
based on classifications used by the CDC/ACSM (25)
(moderate, 3.0­6.0 METs; vigorous, 96.0 METs).
Follow-up interview questions assessed the social and
physical environments of each activity. After the activity
was reported, respondents were asked, ``Who was with you/
Who accompanied you?'' Interviewers coded responses into
22 different categories. Responses were given more than
one category code if a heterogeneous group was reported.
Before data analyses, this variable was recoded into four
general categories representing the overarching type of
social companion: Alone, Family (e.g., household children,
parents, siblings), Friends/Acquaintances (e.g., friends,
neighbors, acquaintances, other nonhousehold children, other
nonhousehold adults), and Coworkers. A fifth general
subgroup called Multiple categories was created, which
encompassed responses reporting social companions from
more than one of the other four general categories.
To assess the physical environment of the activity,
respondents were asked, ``Where were you while you were
[activity]?'' The responses were coded by the interviewers
into 26 different categories including travel modes. Before
data analyses, less common locations for exercise, such as
someone else's house, school, and place of worship, as well
as locations coded as other place and unspecified place,
were combined to create an overall Other/unspecified
category. Exercise and sports reported in unusual or
illogical locations (e.g., grocery store, library, restaurant/
bar, bank) (G3%) and sedentary travel modes (e.g., car/
truck/motorcycle, bus, subway/train, boat/ferry, other mode
of transportation, unspecified mode of transportation)
(G2%) were not included in the analyses. Therefore, the
resulting physical environment variable consisted of five
levels: Outdoors, Home, Work, Gym/health club, and
Other/unspecified.
Temporal and demographic variables were also recoded.
Before data analyses, a season variable was created by
recoding the interview date as follows: fall (September 21
to December 20), winter (December 21 to March 20),
spring (March 21 to June 20), summer (June 21 to
September 20), and target days were coded as weekday or
weekend day. Each activity was coded for the time of day
that it began (i.e., morning [4:00 to 11:59 a.m.], afternoon
[12:00 to 5:59 p.m.], and evening [6:00 p.m. to 3:59 a.m.]).
A four-level age variable was also created: 21­34, 35­44,
45­59, and Q60 yr. Respondents' highest level of education
completed was recoded into the following categories: less
than high school, high school graduate, some college,
graduate of 4-yr college or greater. Race/ethnicity was
recoded as non-Hispanic white only, non-Hispanic black
only, Hispanic only/Hispanic mixed, Asian/Pacific Islander
only, American Indian/Alaskan Native, and non-Hispanic
mixed.
Statistical analyses. Because of the complex sam-
pling design of the ATUS, statistical analyses were
conducted using SUDAAN 9.0 (RTI International, Re-
search Triangle Park, NC). ATUS sample weights were
applied to all statistical analyses to reduce bias in producing
U.S. population estimates as a result of differential
sampling and response rates across subpopulations and
days of the week. For all analyses, the Fay replicate weight
method was used to estimate SE that accounted for the
complex sample design (41). This method for variance
estimation used replicate weights provided by survey
administrators of the ATUS, with an adjustment factor that
was set to Fayadj
= 0.3. Sample weights across the years
2003­2005 were standardized to the weighting method used
in 2006, allowing combined analysis of results (40). All
analyses accounted for nonindependence of observations
for individuals reporting more than one exercise bout per
day through the replicate weight method of variance
estimation (27).
Sample-weighted estimates for the proportion of sports
and exercise bouts that were of moderate and vigorous
intensity were generated. Logistic regression analyses were
subsequently used to test whether the type of social and
physical environment predicted the likelihood that a sport or
exercise bout was of vigorous (compared with moderate)
intensity. Multiple regression analyses were used to es-
timate whether bout duration (in minutes) differed by type
of social and physical environment. For the logistic and
multiple regression models testing social environments,
alone was designated as the reference group. Planned
contrasts comparing family members, coworkers, and
friends/acquaintances were tested using the ``Effects''
statement. Outdoors was designated the reference group
for the models testing physical environments. Differences in
sports and exercise intensity and duration among the home,
work, and gym/health club were tested with planned
contrasts. The multiple regression analyses testing differ-
ences in the duration of sports and exercise bouts examined
moderate- and vigorous-intensity activities separately. All
of the models adjusted for sex, age, education level, and
race/ethnicity. Temporal variables such as season, day of
the week, and time of day were also statistically controlled
because they could hypothetically influence both the
environment in which a behavior is performed and the
intensity and duration of that behavior. Predicted marginal
proportions (for dichotomous outcomes [moderate vs
vigorous intensity]) and predicted marginal means (for
continuous outcomes [minutes]) were calculated from the
logistic and multiple regressions, respectively. These pre-
dictions are standardized values that adjust for all of the
other covariates in the model (19).

participants, 7700 individuals (13.8%) reported at least one
bout of moderate- to vigorous-intensity (Q3.0 METs) sports
or exercise on the previous day (exercise bouts reported in
unusual/illogical locations were excluded). The demo-
graphic characteristics with weighted population estimates
for the current study sample (i.e., adults reporting one or
more exercise bouts) compared with the overall adult
ATUS sample are shown in Table 1.
Whereas the majority of the current study sample
reported one sports or exercise bout on the previous day,
approximately 22% reported more than one bout, which
contributed to a combined total of 9819 bouts across all
participants. The most frequently mentioned types of
activity were walking (for exercise; 32%), using cardiovas-
cular equipment (13%), weightlifting/strength training
(11%), participating in water sports (7%), and running
(5%). Overall, 70.4% of the sports and exercise bouts were
moderate (3.0­6.0 METs), and 29.6% were vigorous (96.0
METs). The sample-weighted mean duration of moderate
and vigorous exercise bouts were 78.43 (SE = 0.37) min
and 55.47 (SE = 0.32) min, respectively

vigorous compared with bouts occurring with family
members (18%), friends/acquaintances (30%), coworkers
(25%), or multiple categories (19%). Results for the

outdoor sports and exercise bouts were vigorous (26%)
compared with bouts taking place at work (16%). In
contrast, a greater percentage of sports and exercise bouts
occurring at home (40%) or at a gym/health club (40%)
were vigorous compared with outdoor exercise bouts. The
percentage of vigorous exercise bouts performed at a gym/
club and at home was comparable.
Environmental influences on the duration of
sports and exercise. Exercising alone generally resulted
in shorter moderate and vigorous bouts. On average,
moderate exercise bouts occurring alone (56 min) were
shorter in duration than bouts occurring with family
members (83 min), friends/acquaintances (120 min), or
multiple categories (122 min) (P values G 0.001; Fig. 1A).
However, the average duration of moderate exercise bouts
occurring alone did not differ from moderate bouts occurring
with coworkers (55 min). Vigorous bouts occurring alone
(44 min) were shorter than bouts taking place with family
members (67 min), friends/acquaintances (79 min), coworkers
(68 min), or multiple categories (86 min; P values G 0.001;
Fig. 1B).
For moderate and vigorous activity, bouts taking place
outdoors and in other/unspecified locations lasted the
longest. Specifically, moderate bouts performed outdoors
(84 min) were longer in duration than bouts occurring at
home (52 min), at work (27 min), or at gym or health club
(60 min; P values G 0.001) and were shorter than moderate
exercise in other/unspecified locations (94 min; P G 0.001;
Fig. 2A). Likewise, vigorous exercise bouts performed
outdoors (66 min) lasted longer than vigorous bouts taking
place at home (42 min), at work (40 min), at gym or health
club (47 min), or in other/unspecified locations (62 min;
P values G 0.001; Fig. 2B).
DISCUSSION
The current research examined the influence of social and
physical environments on the intensity and duration of
recreational sports and exercise bouts reported by adults in
the ATUS (years 2003­2006). This is one of the first
studies among adults to investigate characteristics of
exercise bouts across the full range of settings that they
naturally occur in the U.S. population. Time use data offer a
novel research strategy to examine context-specific exercise
behaviors. Results showed that social company and phys-
ical location were differentially associated with exercise
intensity and duration. These findings contribute to a
growing body of work examining the role that social
contexts and physical settings may play in shaping exercise
behaviors.
Results from the current study are consistent with
behavior setting theory, which suggests that behavior is
impacted by characteristics of the immediate context in
which it occurs (4). There is emerging support for the
notion that microcontextual factors, such as with whom and
where a person is located, influence characteristics of the
health behavior taking place in that environment (39). This
microcontextual approach is supported by calls for research
on context-specific behaviors and behavior-specific aspects
of the environment relevant to physical activity (29).
Overall, findings suggest that sports and exercise behaviors
can take on different characteristics depending on the
microcontext in which they take place.
The results suggest that exercising alone has a beneficial
impact on bout intensity and an unfavorable effect on bout
duration. In contrast to children, who were found to engage
in more intense physical activities when in the presence of
others compared with when they were alone (30), exercise
among adults in the current study was significantly more
likely to reach a vigorous intensity when performed alone.
A potential explanation for this finding is that high-intensity
activities, such as speed and endurance training, are simply
less feasible when occurring with family members or other
groups with mixed ages and activity levels. The decreased

likelihood of intense exercise when accompanied by people
from multiple categories (e.g., friends and family members)
supports this interpretation. Another possible reason is that
the goal of successfully completing the exercise task at a
desired intensity level is more salient during solitary bouts
compared with bouts performed with others, which could
also have process-oriented social or entertainment objec-
tives. The unfavorable effect of exercising alone on bout
duration, however, is consistent with a large body of work
emphasizing the advantages of social support and peer
interactions for physical activity (2,17,30,35,43). There is
some evidence to suggest that exercising with other people
is more enjoyable, pleasant, or entertaining than exercising
alone (10,11), which could result in longer sessions. Also
possible is that the cooperative or competitive nature of
engaging in sports and exercise with other people has a
positive impact on enjoyment and performance (13,34).
Exercise occurring with people coming from multiple
categories is performed with more than one other person.
The added element of this group dynamic may further
account for its beneficial impact on bout duration. Taken
together, results from the current study show that social
environments can have different implications for exercise
intensity and duration.
Differential findings also emerged for the effect of the
physical environment on exercise intensity and duration.
The greater likelihood of vigorous activity occurring at a
health club/gym and at home may be due to the increased
availability of cardiovascular and strengthening equipment
at these locations. These results diverge from studies on
children, which suggest that activity intensity is higher
outdoors than inside their home (3), and may indicate age
differences in preferences for types of vigorous activity
(e.g., adults prefer indoor treadmill running, whereas
children prefer outdoor sports). Yet, this hypothesis has
not been tested. The fact that exercise sessions taking place
in outdoor and other/unspecified locations persisted longer,
however, may reflect unique features of those settings. For
example, a few studies suggest that exercising outdoors and
in natural settings is perceived to be more pleasant than
exercising in artificial environments (6,44). The ATUS was
not specifically designed to study exercise environments
in-depth, and therefore, a substantial number of physical
locations have been coded as other/unspecified. Some of
these activities took place at someone else's house, school,
or a place of worship. Unfortunately, we are unable to infer
much about the remainder of the locations included in this
category, but they may consist of recreational facilities such
as ice/roller skating rinks, climbing walls, obstacle courses,
or other places not included in the general ATUS coding
schema. Distinctive characteristics of these settings, such as
the availability of specialized and/or novel equipment,
could account for in the extended exercise bouts taking
place in those settings.
Overall, these findings provide evidence supporting the
existence of distinct typologies of context-specific exercise
behaviors. Some environments may be more conducive to
higher-intensity activities, whereas others are more condu-
cive to activities that are longer in duration. The prioritiza-
tion of intensity or duration for an activity bout could vary
on the basis of contextual factors. Specifically, when people
are exercising in the company of others or outdoors, fun and
enjoyment might be important. In this case, people might
prioritize activity duration over intensity. In contrast, when
people exercise alone, especially in a health club (where
there is training equipment and help from professional
trainers) or at home (if they own exercise equipment), the
primary goal could be to engage in high-intensity exercise
to improve fitness. Prioritizing intensity in health clubs and
at home might naturally result in shorter exercise bouts.
These results shed light on the larger issue of environment­
behavior specificity that has been receiving growing
attention (23,29). The choice of settings for specific
programs may need to take into account individual differ-
ences and whether increasing the intensity or duration of
activity (or both) is the overall objective for the program.
Using the ATUS to examine differences in the intensity
and duration of sports and exercise bouts across environ-
ments offers several strengths. First, because the ATUS
relied on short-term recall of activities and their environ-
ments, the data may be less vulnerable to recall errors than
typical self-report assessments of physical activity, which
ask respondents to recall activities over longer periods (15).
Second, physical activity is only one of the many daily
activities assessed in the ATUS. Thus, physical activity
reporting in the ATUS may be less influenced by social
desirability reporting bias. In addition, reporting time use
chronologically across the day can provide temporal and
contextual cues that may help to improve the accuracy of
activity recall (16). Lastly, after applying the appropriate
population weights, information reported on the ATUS is
nationally representative and, therefore, describes sports
and exercise performed by U.S. adults on any given day.
There are a few limitations to this study, however. First,
the ATUS is a cross-sectional study and therefore, we need
to exert caution in making causal interpretations of the
findings. Second, the ``other/unspecified'' category within
the physical environment variable is quite large and
heterogeneous because the ATUS was not specifically
designed to measure physical activity environments. Third,
despite efforts taken by the ATUS developers to standardize
response explanations and coding (31), respondents may
have experienced some confusion and ambiguity with
regards to how to report certain environments such as
exercising outdoors when at work. Also, 24-h recall time
use surveys describe the average behavior of a group (e.g.,
proportion of individuals reporting physical activity) on any
given day. They are not intended to estimate an individual's
usual behavior (i.e., average daily physical activity level),
which can vary from day to day. Furthermore, it is possible
that the threshold levels for moderate and vigorous activity
(3.0 and 6.0 METs, respectively) do not accurately reflect

intensity levels for different individuals because of between-
people heterogeneity in fitness levels. Lastly, the current
study focused only on recreational sports and exercise. The
analyses did not include activities performed for the purpose
of transportation, work, or household chores.
In summary, research using a nationally representative
time use survey of U.S. adults found that the intensity and
duration of sports and exercise bouts differ across social and
physical environments. However, the effect of context was
not consistent for intensity and duration. Therefore, the
choice of settings for specific exercise programs may need
to take into account whether increasing the intensity or
duration of exercise takes priority. Overall, results support
the existence of context-specific exercise behaviors.
