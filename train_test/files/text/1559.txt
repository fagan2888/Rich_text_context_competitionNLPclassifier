National Trends In Adult Hospice Use:
1991­1992 To 1999­2000
Hospice care has grown dramatically, but about 75 percent of
Americans who died in 2000 had not used these services.

ABSTRACT: This study examines hospice use among adult hospice patients based on the
1992­2000 National Home and Hospice Care Surveys, the 1997­1999 National Nursing
Home Surveys, and the 1991­2000 annual Underlying and Multiple Cause-of-Death Files.
The total number of adult hospice patients tripled between 1991­1992 and 1999­2000.
The majority of inpatient hospice patients resided in nursing homes. The increased hospice
utilization rates and increased percentage of adult hospice patients with short stays in hos-
pice indicate changes in hospice enrollment patterns over time. Hospice is still in the proc-
ess of growing toward a steady state. [Health Affairs 25, no. 3 (2006): 792­799; 10.1377/

Hospice care in the United States
has evolved from a "movement" to a
"philosophy" to a new medical spe-
cialty that emphasizes comfort, pain relief,
and emotional and spiritual support for pa-
tients certified by a physician to have six
months or less of life expectancy. Once en-
rolled in hospice, patients receive comfort
care and forgo all curative treatments for their
terminal illness and related conditions. The
concept of holistic hospice care was first in-
troduced in this country in the 1960s, but the
Medicare hospice benefit was not created un-
til 1982.
Although use of hospice services in the
United States has increased dramatically over
the past twenty years, hospice care is still
underused.1 U.S. hospice admissions increased
from about 1,000 in 1975 to approximately
700,000 in 2000; however, only 25 percent of
Americans who died in 2000 were under hos-
pice care at the time of death.2 Even among
Medicare decedents with end-stage cancer di-
agnoses, only 44 percent used hospice care in
1996.3
Understanding how hospice use has
evolved over time can inform future efforts to
improve care for terminally ill patients and
their families. Previous studies have examined
factors associated with hospice use, length of
hospice service, and trends in hospice use and
costs for Medicare patients.4 However, no

studies have examined changes in hospice use
rates and length of hospice service use, hospice
enrollment patterns, and characteristics of the
entire U.S. hospice population over the past
decade. Using nationally representative hos-
pice data and national death files, we exam-
ined these trends for 1991­2000.
Study Data And Methods
n Data sources. Our study examined
9,418 adult hospice patients using data from
the National Home and Hospice Care Survey
(NHHCS) in 1992, 1994, 1996, 1998, and 2000.5
These data are based on nationally representa-
tive samples of home health and hospice agen-
cies and their patients. We also analyzed data
on adult nursing home hospice patients from
the 1997 and 1999 National Nursing Home
Surveys (NNHS), which are also nationally
representative.6 In addition, we examined data
from the 1991­2000 annual Underlying and
Multiple Cause-of-Death Files, which provide
cause-of-death information reported by all
fifty states and the District of Columbia from
1991 to 2000.7
We assessed the following hospice patient
characteristics: age, sex, race, primary pay-
ment source at admission, residence during
hospice care, and admission diagnoses. We
categorized length of hospice service use (ad-
mission date was subtracted from dis-
charge/death date) as 0­7, 8­15, 16­30, 31­90,
91­180, or 181 days or more. More than 85 per-
cent of hospice patients died in hospice care,
and many who were discharged from hospice
died soon thereafter.8
n Statistical analyses. We used chi-
square tests to examine the significance of
changes in distributions of adult hospice pa-
tients between 1991­1992 and 1999­2000 at
the bivariate level. We estimated the number
of adult hospice patients who were discharged
or died during each corresponding twelve-
month period (October of the year before the
survey year through September of the survey
year) by cancer diagnosis, age at admission,
and residence during hospice care.
We used a chi-square test to examine sig-
nificant changes in the length of service distri-
bution across the years. Z tests were applied to
test the statistical significance of changes in
the percentages within each subcategory of
length of service use between 1991­1992 and
1999­2000.
We calculated the number of adult hospice
patients who were discharged or died during
each corresponding twelve-month period by
their length of hospice service use. From the
1991­2000 annual Underlying and Multiple
Cause-of-Death Files, we estimated the num-
ber of U.S. nontraumatic deaths during each
corresponding twelve-month period de-
scribed above. Those with traumatic deaths
(such as those resulting from homicide, sui-
cide, or motor vehicle accidents) were ex-
cluded because they were unlikely to be eligi-
ble for hospice care.9
To estimate the adult hospice use rate by
length of hospice service use, we divided the
number of adult hospice patients who were
discharged after a certain length of hospice
service use by the number of nontraumatic de-
cedents during the same twelve-month period.
The entire analyses were conducted using SAS
callable SUDAAN to adjust for the complex
sampling design of the NHHCS and the
NNHS.10
Study Results
n Characteristics of hospice patients.
The percentage of hospice patients age eighty-
five and older doubled from 14 percent in 1991­
1992 to 26 percent in 1999­2000 (Exhibit 1).
The percentage with Medicare as their pri-
mary payment source increased from almost
63 percent to 79 percent over the study period.
The percentage of noncancer hospice patients
doubled during this period, and the percent-
age with Alzheimer's disease or dementia in-
creased significantly. Also, there was a three-
fold increase in the percentage of inpatient
hospice patients (residing in nursing homes,
hospitals, or other inpatient facilities).
n Number of patients by cancer diagno-
sis and age group. The number of adult hos-
pice patients with cancer doubled during the
study period, while the number without can-
cer increased more than fivefold (Exhibit 2).

There also was a more than fivefold increase in
the number of patients who were age eighty-
five and older at admission to hospice care
during the study period (Exhibit 3). Exhibit 3
also shows a decline in the number of hospice
patients ages 18­49 after 1995­1996. In addi-
tion, the number of nursing home hospice pa-
tients age eighty-five and older doubled from
1996­1997 to 1998­1999 (Exhibit 4).
n Number of hospice patients by resi-
dence. The total number of adult inpatient
hospice patients increased ninefold between
1991­1992 and 1999­2000 and nearly doubled
from 1997­1998 to 1999­2000 (Exhibit 5).
n Length of service use. The length of
service use among adult hospice patients
changed significantly across the years (Exhibit
6). The percentage with 0­7 days of hospice
use increased significantly from 1991­1992 to
1999­2000. We also saw significant declines in
longer lengths of hospice service use. Although
we are unable to determine length of hospice

number of nursing home hospice patients with
long nursing home stays increased over time:
36 percent had stays of more than ninety days
in 1996­1997, versus 43 percent in 1998­1999
(data not shown).
n Hospice use among decedents. Hos-
pice use rates per 1,000 nontraumatic dece-
dents increased significantly over the period,
except for patients with more than 180 days of

use rate among patients with 0­7 days of hos-
pice care rose the most.

the number of patients age eighty-five and
older increased more than fivefold. Rates of
hospice use and the percentage of adult hos-
pice patients with short hospice stays in-
creased significantly.
n Residence during hospice care. Al-
though the total number of adult hospice pa-
tients nearly tripled in the 1990s, the number
in inpatient facilities increased more than
ninefold. Further analyses revealed that the
majority of these patients resided in nursing
homes rather than in hospitals or other inpa-
tient facilities during 1997­1999. However, be-
cause intensity levels in hospice care have risen
over the years, the number of inpatient hospice
patients outside of nursing homes increased as
well.11
The NHHCS and NNHS do not capture
whether these hospice patients were nursing
home residents before hospice enrollment or
whether they were relocated to nursing homes
by hospice agencies as inpatients. A report by
Susan Miller and colleagues reveals that in the
1992­1996 period, almost 80 percent of hos-
pice patients in nursing homes were residents
there before enrolling in hospice.12 Our results
show that 36 percent of hospice patients in
nursing homes had more than ninety-day stays
in 1996­1997, and 43 percent did so in 1998­

1999. This suggests that many patients were
nursing home residents before they began re-
ceiving hospice care.
The increases in hospice enrollment among
nursing home residents might suggest that
more terminally ill nursing home residents are
benefiting from hospice care. Hospice patients
in nursing homes are less likely to be hospital-
ized near the end of life and are more likely to
receive appropriate pain management than are
nonhospice nursing home residents.13 Families
of nursing home hospice patients rated resi-
dents' end-of-life care more highly than did
families of terminally ill residents without
hospice.14 Although the number of nursing
home hospice patients increased over the
study period, the National Hospice and Pallia-
tive Care Organization reports that less than 5
percent of those who died in nursing homes re-
ceived hospice care in 1998.15
n Changes in hospice enrollment pat-
terns. Our results suggest that hospice enroll-
ment patterns have changed during the past
decade. We found that during the study pe-
riod, the percentage of adult hospice patients

percentage points and that the hospice use

hospice service quadrupled. This latter in-
crease could be related to recent improve-
ments in medical treatments that might have
prompted patients to pursue new curative op-
tions until shortly before death, resulting in
shorter lengths of hospice service use.16 Our re-
sults might also indicate the diffusion of hos-
pice care into current medical practice as a
new medical specialty, with many patients go-
ing into hospice as part of their ordinary care
when death is imminent. Researchers, clini-
cians, and insurance companies have recently
realized the importance of palliative care in the
earlier stages of the chronic care continuum
and are trying to combine life-prolonging
treatments when appropriate, palliation of
symptoms, and support for caregivers as a po-
tentially more effective form of end-of-life
care.17 This open-access approach could
remove some barriers to hospice access and
affect hospice use in the future.
Although recent studies indicate that even
very brief hospice stays can be beneficial,
symptom management is often difficult to
achieve over a week or two.18 Our results show
that among adult hospice patients in 1999­
2000, only 37 percent had more than thirty
days of hospice service, while about half of
them had 0­15 days. Although little is known
about the optimal length of a hospice stay, ear-
lier hospice enrollment might improve the
management of patients' symptoms and sup-
port for family caregivers.
n Changes in the hospice population.
Our results indicate that the percentage of
adult hospice patients with Medicare as their
primary payer increased and that there was a
substantial shift toward the oldest-old (age
eighty-five and older). These patients consti-
tuted almost one-fourth of all adult hospice
patients in 1999­2000. The percentage of hos-
pice patients with noncancer diagnoses or ex-
isting Alzheimer's disease or dementia also
greatly increased during this period. We also
note that the decrease we found in the number
of hospice patients ages 18­49 might be due in
part to the improvement in HIV/AIDS treat-
ment after 1995­1996. Hospice care is becom-
ing standard end-of-life care for patients with
a variety of terminal diagnoses.
n Future research and suggestions.
Hospice has grown dramatically because of
the development of government reimburse-
ment systems and private health insurance
coverage and because it meets many basic hu-
man needs associated with terminal illness
and bereavement. However, in 1998 more than
95 percent of those who died in nursing homes
did not receive hospice care; and in 2000 about
75 percent of U.S. decedents did not use hos-
pice services near the time of death.19 Future
studies are needed to understand the charac-
teristics and needs of both hospice patients
and nonhospice terminally ill patients, to en-
sure the provision of high-quality care at life's
end. Moreover, researchers need to examine
how the quality of hospice care has been af-
fected by the increase in patients with short
hospice stays over time. How hospice care is
perceived and is used by terminally ill patients
and their families is continuing to evolve. Fu-
ture studies are needed to assess how various
emerging approaches to end-of-life care affect
hospice use, the benefits received by hospice
patients and their families, and the hospice
care delivery system.

5. The NHHCS was conducted from September to
December of each survey year by the National
Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). The sample
design for each NHHCS was a stratified two-
stage probability design. The first stage selected
a stratified sample of agencies based on type of
agency (home health agencies, hospices, and
mixed agencies), metropolitan statistical area
(MSA), and region. The second stage systemati-
cally selected six current patients and six dis-
charged/deceased patients within each sampled
agency. We examined adult hospice patients
based on discharged/deceased patient sample of
each NHHCS. The weighted number of dis-
charged/deceased hospice patients provides an
estimate of the total number of hospice patients
who were discharged or died in the United
States during each twelve-month period (Octo-
ber of the year before the survey year through
September of the survey year).
6. The NCHS conducted 1995, 1997, and 1999 Na-
tional Nursing Home Surveys(NNHS) fromSep-
tember to December of each survey year. The
sample design was a stratified two-stage proba-
bility design. The first stage of selection was a
probability sample of the nursing facilities in the
sampling frame. The second stage systematically
sampled six current residents (1995, 1997, and
1999 NNHS) and six discharged/deceased resi-
dents (1997 and 1999 NNHS) within each se-
lected facility. We examined adult hospice pa-
tients based on discharged/deceased resident
sample of the 1997 and 1999 NNHS. The
weighted total number of patients from either
survey year provides an estimate on the total
number of nursing home hospice patients who
were discharged or died between October of the
year prior to the survey year and September of
the survey year.
