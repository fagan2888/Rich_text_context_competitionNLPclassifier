Abstract
Objective: To investigate whether the efficacy of continuous theta-burst stimulation (cTBS) for
improving visuospatial neglect can be enhanced by providing more days of stimulation and more
stimulation trains per day.
Methods: In a prospective study, right-handed patients with right hemisphere stroke and
visuospatial neglect were randomized to cTBS or sham cTBS treatment for 2 weeks and were
followed up for 4 weeks. The cTBS group received active cTBS over the posterior parietal cortex
of the unaffected hemisphere, combined with conventional rehabilitation therapy. Changes in
scores for two paper­pencil tests for visuospatial neglect (star cancellation and line bisection) were
evaluated.
Results: In each group, 10 patients completed follow up. Compared with the sham group, star
cancellation test scores in the cTBS group were improved by 37.03% at the end of treatment and by
47.21% after 4 weeks' follow up, and the line bisection score improved by 21.37% at the end of
treatment and by 35.99% after 4 weeks' follow up.
Conclusions: These results suggest that the efficacy of cTBS in visuospatial neglect can be
enhanced and prolonged by increasing the days of stimulation and the number of stimulation trains
per day over the left posterior parietal cortex.

stroke:1 it occurs in up to 43% of patients
with acute right hemisphere stroke.2 The
most striking defining feature is failure to
detect, respond or orient to stimuli ­ even
one's own body parts ­ in contralesional
space.3 Visuospatial neglect is an independ-
ent predictor of poor outcome in terms of
poststroke functional independence,4 there-
fore there is a compelling need for visuo-
spatial neglect rehabilitation. Although
several treatment methods have been devel-
oped,5 it is generally agreed that such
approaches remain unsatisfactory.6
Methods of noninvasive brain stimula-
tion, such as transcranial direct current
stimulation7 or repetitive transcranial mag-
netic stimulation (TMS),8 are promising
approaches to treat visuospatial neglect.
One influential mechanism underlying
these noninvasive stimulation methods is
based on interhemispheric rivalry, or the
competition model.9,10 A classic theta-burst
stimulation (TBS) protocol, which is used to
induce long-term potentiation or long-term
depression in brain slices, can be adapted to
TMS, where it rapidly produces a long-
lasting effect on the motor cortex.11 In a
sham-controlled study, 10 days of continu-
ous theta-burst stimulation (cTBS) over the
posterior parietal cortex (PPC) of the left
hemisphere reduced visuospatial neglect for
!2 weeks.10, Another study showed a 37%
improvement in the everyday behaviour of
patients with visuospatial neglect for !3
weeks, after two consecutive days of con-
tinuous theta-burst stimulation.12
Here, we used a modified version of a
cTBS protocol that is known to be effective
in inducing long-term depression and long-
lasting changes in the excitability of
the stimulated cortex.11 By increasing the
number of stimulation days and the number
of trains per day over the left PPC in
poststroke patients, we investigated whether
the efficacy of cTBS for visuospatial neg-
lect rehabilitation could be enhanced.
Visuospatial neglect was assessed with both
the star cancellation test (SCT) and the line
bisection test (LBT).13 The SCT is con-
sidered to be particularly sensitive for visuo-
spatial neglect and is not subject to practice
effects, therefore it is suitable for repeated
measurements.14 The line bisection test,
unlike the cancellation test, requires magni-
tude estimates that are influenced by atten-
tional bias. Furthermore, a combination of
neglect tests, rather than a single neglect test,
might be more sensitive in detecting and
defining the presence of visuospatial
neglect.15
Patients and methods
Patients
This study enrolled consecutive right-
handed patients with right hemisphere
stroke and visuospatial neglect, attending
the Department of Rehabilitation Medicine,
Xuanwu Hospital, Capital Medical
University between May 2011 and April
2013.
Patients were randomly allocated to left
PPC cTBS treatment or sham treatment,
using a computer-generated randomization
schedule. Patients and therapists were
blinded to the type of intervention. All
patients received conventional rehabilitation
training, based on visuospatial scanning, of
30 min twice daily for 2 weeks. Patients were
also treated with programmes for motor
rehabilitation when necessary.
All patients gave written informed con-
sent for participation in the study.
Experimental procedures were approved by
the local Ethics Committee and were under-
taken in accordance with the Declaration of
Helsinki.
Inclusion/exclusion criteria
This study included patients with visuo-
spatial neglect, with a history of a haemor-
rhagic or ischaemic lesion in the right
hemisphere, which was confirmed by
Fu et al. 197
computed tomography or magnetic reson-
ance imaging >2 weeks before the beginning
of the study. The diagnosis of visuospatial
neglect was based on the judgement of the
clinician and on deficits in at least one out of
two paper­pencil tests.12 The applied paper­
pencil tests were the SCT and LBT. The cut-
off score of SCT was 51 (i.e. four omissions
was defined as an impairment score).16 In
the LBT, patients were included if they
scored a deviation !12% to the right of
centre.15 All patients had normal or cor-
rected-to-normal acuity.
Exclusion criteria for this study were
based on the accepted safety guidelines for
TMS, which included an assessment of the
history of epilepsy, previous head trauma,
drug and alcohol abuse and psychiatric
disorders.17 Moreover, patients were
excluded for any of the following reasons:
recurrent stroke, obvious aphasia and com-
munication obstacles, family history of seiz-
ures, ever use of tricyclic antidepressants or
antipsychotic drugs, in vivo diamagnetic
metal implants such as cardiac pacemakers
and age <30 years or >80 years. Also,
patients with visual field defects
detected by the confrontation method were
excluded.
Continuous theta-burst stimulation and
sham protocols
Continuous theta-burst stimulation and
sham treatments were performed immedi-
ately before visuospatial scanning training.
The site of cTBS or sham stimulation was set
over P5, according to the International 10/
10 EEG system: this site overlies the left PPC
in proximity of the intraparietal sulcus.18
Each day, four trains of left PPC cTBS or
sham stimulation were applied, with an
interval of 15 min. Treatment was given for
14 consecutive days.
Continuous theta-burst stimulation was
delivered using a Super Rapid 2 magnetic
stimulator (Magstim, Whitland, UK) with
2.0-Tesla maximum field strength, con-
nected with a figure-of-eight coil (diameter
of outside loop, 87 mm). For each train, a
three-pulse burst was delivered at 30 Hz and
repeated every 200 ms (i.e. 5 Hz; the fre-
quency that mimics the theta wave of a
spontaneous neural rhythm) for 40 s. 11 The
stimulus intensity was 80% of the resting
motor threshold of the resting abductor
pollicis brevis muscles.19
Sham stimulation was delivered with the
same set up as cTBS but with the coil
perpendicular to the patient's scalp, with
only one edge of the coil resting on the
scalp.20
Clinical evaluation of visuospatial neglect
Visuospatial neglect was assessed with the
SCT and LBT, which were administered by
blinded raters (Y.Z., S.H. and R.Z) at three
time points: 1 h before starting the first
session of stimulation (baseline), at the end
of stimulation (Post 1) and after a follow up
of 4 weeks (Post 2).
The SCT consisted of an A4 sheet of
paper on which there were 56 small stars
randomly interspersed with a variety of
distracts (52 large stars, 10 short words
and 13 letters). The patients were instructed
to cross out all of the small stars. The
percentage of small stars not crossed out
was calculated.21
The LBT consisted of a landscape-
oriented A4 sheet of paper on which there
were five horizontal lines distributed with
equal vertical spacing. The line lengths (L)
were 16, 14, 12, 10 and 8 cm. Patients were
asked to mark the midpoint of each line. The
distance between the marked midpoint and
the corresponding true midpoint were mea-
sured (R). A positive value indicated devi-
ation towards the right of the true midpoint,
while a negative value indicated deviation
towards the left. The percentage severity of
visuospatial neglect was calculated as
100 Â R/(L/2).22

Statistical analyses
Data are presented as mean Æ SD. SPSSÕ
version 17.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA)
was used to process the data. A repeated-
measure analysis of variance (ANOVA) was
performed to calculate the differences in
SCT score and LBT score, with group
(cTBS versus Sham) as the between-subject
main factor and time (baseline versus Post 1
versus Post 2) as the within-subject main
factor. The Greenhouse­Geisser test was
used to correct the P-value if the
Mauchly's test of sphericity was significant.
If a significant effect was observed, post hoc
tests were carried out for multiple compari-
sons (least significant difference or Student­
Newman­Keuls). For all statistical analyses,
a P-value < 0.05 was considered to be
significant.
Results
Twenty-two right-handed patients with
right hemisphere stroke and visuospatial
neglect were enrolled in this study. Of
these, 11 were assigned to cTBS and 11 to
sham treatment. One patient in each group
did not finish the follow-up testing and these
two patients were excluded from the study.
Therefore, each group included full data
from 10 patients for analysis. The treatment
groups did not differ in sex, age or time
between stroke onset and beginning of
testing (Table 1).
There were no significant differences
between the groups in baseline SCT scores
(mean Æ SD for SCT scores in the two
groups were 53.47 Æ 7.07% and 52.14 Æ
7.07%, in the cTBS and sham treatment
groups, respectively). There were significant
differences between the groups in Post 1
SCT scores (cTBS, 16.43 Æ 7.03%; sham,
50.00 Æ 7.03%; P ¼ 0.030) and Post 2 SCT
scores (cTBS, 6.25 Æ 5.94%; sham, 45.29 Æ
5.94%; P < 0.001; Figure 1). Compared
with sham treatment, cTBS over the left
PPC resulted in an improvement in SCT
scores between baseline and Post 2, as
revealed by ANOVA, showing a group-
Â time effect (F2,18
¼ 44.499; P < 0.001) and
a group Â time interaction (F2,18
¼ 27.582;
P < 0.001). Within the cTBS group, there
were significant improvements between
baseline and Post 1 SCT scores (by
37.03%; P < 0.001) and between baseline
and Post 2 scores (by 47.21%; P < 0.001).
There was no significant within-group dif-
ference between Post 1 and Post 2 scores.
There were no significant differences
between the groups in baseline LBT scores
(cTBS, 47.16 Æ 23.65%; sham, 46.03 Æ
22.82%) or Post 1 scores (cTBS, 25.79 Æ
27.32%; sham, 32.79 Æ 13.12%). There was
a significant difference between the groups in
Post 2 LBT scores (cTBS, 11.17 Æ 14.27%;
sham, 35.79 Æ 18.65%; P ¼ 0.004; Figure 2).
Compared with sham treatment, cTBS over
the left PPC resulted in an improvement in
LBT score between baseline and Post 2, as
revealed by ANOVA analysis showing
a group Â time effect (F2,18
¼ 13.522;
P < 0.001) and a group Â time interaction
(F2,18
¼ 4.050; P ¼ 0.045). Within the cTBS
group, there were significant differences
between baseline and Post 1 LBT scores
(21.37%; P ¼ 0.042) and between baseline
and Post 2 scores (35.99%; P ¼ 0.001).
There was no significant within-group dif-
ference between Post 1 and Post 2 scores.
No study participant experienced any
severe adverse event. Two patients reported
a slight headache when they received the real
cTBS stimulation.
Discussion
The present study findings showed that our
modified cTBS protocol, administered over
the unaffected PPC for 2 weeks, combined
with conventional rehabilitation training,
reduced visuospatial neglect significantly.
The improvement persisted for !4 weeks
after the discontinuation of cTBS.
Furthermore, for the LBT task, efficacy at
Fu et al. 199
the end of 4 weeks' follow up was signifi-
cantly better than at the end of 2 weeks'
stimulation. No significant improvement
was observed with sham treatment com-
bined with conventional rehabilitation ther-
apy. Our device was only able to deliver
30-Hz magnetic pulses if we also wanted to
adjust the output (stimulation intensity),
which we did in the present study; hence,
we used a modified protocol. Furthermore,
4­7-Hz rhythms are in the range of the theta
band, according to electroencephalograph
systems.
The method of how to achieve powerful,
long-lasting and stable efficacy for
visuospatial neglect is still open to debate.
Our observation of a reduction in visuo-
spatial neglect after cTBS over the unaf-
fected PPC is in line with other noninvasive
brain stimulation studies, which used single-
pulse TMS and paired TMS as a `virtual
lesion' technique,23,24 low-frequency
( 1 Hz) repetitive TMS,17,24,25 cathodal
transcranial direct current stimulation26 or
continuous TBS.10,12 Koch et al.10 applied
left PPC TBS in two sessions per day with an
interval of 15 min every day for 2 weeks (10
days), which reduced hemispatial neglect for
up to 2 weeks after treatment: behavioural
inattention test scores improved by 16.3% at

the end of treatment and 22.6% at 2-week
follow up. Cazzoli et al.12 applied more
trains per day (four trains), but for fewer
days (2 days): their results showed a 37%
improvement in everyday behaviour of
hemispatial neglect patients for !3 weeks.
In the current study, we applied more trains
per day (four trains) and more stimulation
days (14 consecutive days) and showed that
the efficacy of cTBS can be enhanced and
can persist for !4 weeks after discontinu-
ation of stimulation. The mean Æ SD SCT
score in the cTBS group improved by
37.03% at the end of stimulation and
47.21% at 4 weeks' follow up. However,
no significant effect was observed in the
sham group. Patients in the cTBS group
maintained their relatively stable beneficial
outcome, or even kept improving, after
discontinuation of stimulation. This finding
suggests that the approach applied in this
study ­ four trains daily and 14 consecutive
days ­ might be particularly promising for
therapeutic application.
It has been suggested that the suppression
of pathological hyperexcitability of the
structurally intact PPC, which also leads to
a reduced interhemispheric inhibition from
the unaffected towards the affected hemi-
sphere, is an important mechanism resulting
in visuospatial neglect remission.27 It is
highly possible that the build up of cumula-
tive effects may account for the dispropor-
tionately longer-lasting effect of repeated
trains of cTBS compared with a single train:
cumulative effects can be achieved after a
long conditioning phase involving periodic
stimulation sessions at intervals 24 h,
which build up a lasting `memory' and
result in increased facilitation of subsequent
stimulation effects.28 Another interpretation
for the long-lasting effect of cTBS considers
consolidation mechanisms, as proposed in
the cascade model of animals, where
repeated trains of TBS can extend the life-
time of plastic modifications in the human
brain. Similar to results in animal studies,

the number of applied theta-burst trains
determines the lifetime of changes in the
neural network of the human brain.19 The
lasting reduction in visuospatial neglect
observed in this study supports the idea
that one or more of these mechanisms is
active in the human brain.
A strength of the present study is the
blinding of the patients, therapists and the
test raters. Also, the stimulus intensity for
the sham stimulation was the same as for
cTBS, and all patients had the same acoustic
sensation during treatment. Notable limita-
tions of the present study are that there was
no stratification by patient age, lesion loca-
tion or subtype of visuospatial neglect, all of
which may influence the recovery of visuo-
spatial neglect,12 therefore stratification stu-
dies are needed. Further studies should also
investigate whether the number of stimula-
tion days or the number of trains per day has
the greater effect. In addition, we note that
our study also excluded patients with visual
field defects, which may have resulted in
less-impaired patients being included in the
cohort. Whether the extent of visuospatial
neglect in stroke patients affects the efficacy
of cTBS should be considered in further
studies. Finally, further studies should
include a control group.
In conclusion, the present study sup-
ports previous findings that multiple ses-
sions of cTBS over the unaffected PPC,
combined with conventional rehabilitation
therapy, can lead to efficient and long-
lasting improvement in visuospatial neg-
lect. Compared with other studies,10,12 the
present study also found initial evidence
that efficacy of cTBS for visuospatial
neglect may be enhanced and prolonged
by increasing the number of stimulation
days and the number of trains per day.
We base this conclusion following com-
parison of our findings with those from
other published studies, and we note that
the efficacy of conventional rTMS or TBS
often is considered to be short lasting.
