Abstract
Background: Patients who undergo percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for severely
calcified coronary lesions have long been known to have worse clinical and economic
outcomes than patients with no or mildly calcified lesions. We sought to assess the likely
cost-effectiveness of using the Diamondback 360® Orbital Atherectomy System (OAS) in the
treatment of de novo, severely calcified lesions from a health-system perspective.
Methods and results: In the absence of a head-to-head trial and long-term follow up,
cost-effectiveness was based on a modeled synthesis of clinical and economic data. A cost-
effectiveness model was used to project the likely economic impact. To estimate the net
cost impact, the cost of using the OAS technology in elderly ( 65 years) Medicare patients
with de novo severely calcified lesions was compared with cost offsets. Elderly OAS patients
from the ORBIT II trial (Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of OAS in Treating Severely Calcified
Coronary Lesions) [ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01092426] were indirectly compared with
similar patients using observational data. For the index procedure, the comparison was with
Medicare data, and for both revascularization and cardiac death in the following year, the
comparison was with a pooled analysis of the Harmonizing Outcomes with Revascularization
and Stents in Acute Myocardial Infarction (HORIZONS-AMI)/Acute Catheterization and Urgent
Intervention Triage Strategy (ACUITY) trials. After adjusting for differences in age, gender,
and comorbidities, the ORBIT II mean index procedure costs were 17% (p < 0.001) lower,
approximately US$2700. Estimated mean revascularization costs were lower by US$1240 in
the base case. These cost offsets in the first year, on average, fully cover the cost of the device
with an additional 1.2% cost savings. Even in the low-value scenario, the use of the OAS is
cost-effective with a cost per life-year gained of US$11,895.
Conclusions: Based on economic modeling, the recently approved coronary OAS device
is projected to be highly cost-effective for patients who undergo PCI for severely calcified
lesions.

considerably greater healthcare utilization and
costs [Chambers et al. 2014a]. The Diamondback
360® Coronary Orbital Atherectomy System
(OAS) (Cardiovascular Systems Inc., St. Paul,
MN, USA), approved in late 2013 by the US
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) specifi-
cally indicated for the treatment of de novo, severe
coronary artery calcification (CAC), represents
the first major advance in many years for coronary
lesion preparation dedicated to heavily calcified
lesions. The pivotal clinical study, the Evaluate
the Safety and Efficacy of OAS in Treating
Severely Calcified Coronary Lesions (ORBIT II)
trial, was a single-arm trial carried out at 49 US
sites and included 443 patients [Chambers et al.
2014b], and was the first prospective study to
focus exclusively on the treatment of severely cal-
cified coronary lesions.
Given the ongoing changes in healthcare policy and
financing in the postreform era, payers, clinicians,
patients, and policymakers must increasingly con-
sider both the cost and the clinical effectiveness of
therapeutic devices, including not only the initial
inpatient or acute care costs but also the postacute
care costs over a longer period of time. In addition,
as recommended in the recent American College of
Cardiology/American Heart Association statement
on cost/value methodology [Anderson et al. 2014],
it is important to assess societal-level cost and value
information. These data are critical for developers
of clinical guidelines and performance metrics, as
well as for health technology assessment and adop-
tion considerations.
The primary objective of this analysis was to
assess the potential cost-effectiveness of the
Diamondback Coronary OAS device for severe
CAC from a health-system perspective by mode-
ling: (a) the expected cost offsets, both during the
acute and postacute care periods; (b) the poten-
tial reduction in patient mortality and morbidity;
(c) the comparison of mortality and morbidity
impacts in relation to the overall cost impact of
device use via a cost-effectiveness analysis. Given
the lack of a control arm in the pivotal trial, an
indirect comparison was made with other clinical
trial results and relevant observational data to
assess the cost-effectiveness. This economic anal-
ysis compared the ORBIT II study population
with: (a) a comparison sample of elderly Medicare
beneficiaries; (b) a new subanalysis of data from
theHarmonizingOutcomeswithRevascularization
and Stents in Acute Myocardial Infarction
(HORIZONS-AMI)/Acute Catheterization and
Urgent Intervention Triage Strategy (ACUITY)
trials pooled (H-A/AP) analysis that was pub-
lished recently [Généreux et al. 2014]. This study
compared the cost of the OAS device with poten-
tial savings that may be attributed to lower stent-
procedure costs and lower revascularization rates
in treated patients as well as the projected impact
on patient mortality.
Methods
Study design
In October 2013, the FDA approved the OAS
technology for coronary use. The covered indica-
tion is "to facilitate stent delivery in patients with
coronary artery disease (CAD) who are accepta-
ble candidates for percutaneous transluminal cor-
onary angioplasty (PTCA) or stenting due to de
novo, severely calcified coronary artery lesions"
[FDA, 2013]. The approval was based on a sin-
gle-arm study (ORBIT II), for which safety and
efficacy were compared with historical data for a
range of major adverse cardiac events (MACEs)
at 30 days postprocedure [Chambers et al.
2014b]. The study met both endpoints: efficacy
(procedural success, 88.9% versus 82% target;
95% confidence interval [CI], 85.5­91.6) and
safety (freedom from 30-day MACEs, 89.6% ver-
sus 83% target; 95% CI, 86.7­92.5) [Chambers
et al. 2014b].
In the absence of a head-to-head trial and long-
term follow up, this assessment of the potential
cost-effectiveness of the intervention was based on
a modeled synthesis of relevant, available data,
both clinical and economic, in comparison with
the current standard of care for severely calcified
lesions, which is the use of balloon angioplasty to
prepare the stent-placement site. Although a rota-
tional atherectomy device is available, it was likely
used in only a small percentage of cases. A simple
cost-effectiveness model was used to project the
essential elements of the likely economic impact.
To estimate the net cost impact (the numerator in
the cost-effectiveness ratio), the cost of using the
OAS in elderly ( 65 years) Medicare patients
with de novo, severely calcified lesions was com-
pared to any cost offsets. The potential cost offsets
due to OAS use fall into three major categories:
(a) reduced procedural costs related to stent
implantation; (b) reduced revascularization events
in the 30 days following the initial hospitalization;
Therapeutic Advances in Cardiovascular Disease 10(2)
76 http://tac.sagepub.com
(c) reduced revascularization events between day
30 and 1 year. Effectiveness (the denominator in
the cost-effectiveness ratio) was measured in two
ways: (a) patient survival at the end of 1 year;
(b) life-years gained over a lifetime horizon.
To a considerable extent, the structure and limi-
tations of the available data defined the type and
breadth of the economic comparison that was
made at this early stage of commercialization.
ORBIT II patients were followed through 1 year
postprocedure. In addition, a new International
Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision,
Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) diagnosis
code (414.4) for CAC was instituted in the last
quarter of 2011, and data for elderly Medicare
patients through to the end of 2012 (the latest
period for which these data are available) were
examined. Given the small numbers, it was not
possible to estimate postprocedure revasculariza-
tion in the Medicare sample: instead, a new suba-
nalysis of the elderly population from the H-A/AP
sample was used [Généreux et al. 2014]. This
combination of information allowed us to com-
pare the two groups for 1 year postprocedure.
Economic model
The cost-effectiveness analysis was based on a
mathematical model that integrated data on costs
and MACE rates from several sources in order to
compare the performance of the OAS technology
versus standard treatment in stenting de novo,
severely calcified lesions in a specific set of
patients, i.e. elderly Medicare patients.
The analysis was from the perspective of a health
system, which considers direct costs as well as
patient outcomes. Given current data limitations,
the focus was on the key drivers for which evi-
dence is currently available.
Figure 1 provides a simple schematic of the com-
parison. Elderly OAS patients from the ORBIT II
trial were compared with a similar sample of
Medicare patients with de novo, calcified lesions
for the index stent placement and with the H-A/
AP sample following the index procedure. Thus,
the cost comparison was constructed as the sum
of three intervals: (a) the initial index procedure;
(b) patient status at 30 days following the proce-
dure; (c) patient status from the period between
postprocedure day 31 and 1 year. The primary
effectiveness endpoints were based on the survival
difference at 1 year following the procedure and
were measured in two ways: cost per `life saved'
and cost per `life-years gained'. The latter required
a projection of expected lifetime for a typical
(median) patient (a 74-year-old man) in the
ORBIT II elderly subsample.
Cost of the OAS device
The manufacturer's suggested list price of the
OAS device in this analysis was set at US$3795
and did not vary in the analysis. It is a disposable,
one-time-use device.

patients were compared with a sample of elderly
Medicare coronary-stent patients with reported
CAC. As shown in Table 1, the ORBIT II and
Medicare comparison samples were similar in
terms of baseline characteristics with the exception
of the Charlson comorbidity index score [Delong
et al. 1997]. This may be due, in part, to coding
differences in the two datasets: the documentation
of comorbidities in the clinical trial database was
less thorough and clear because only those reported
during the index hospitalization were included. A
generalized linear model with a gamma distribu-
tion was used with the following covariates: age
group, gender, and Charlson index, and censored
costs were taken into account using the Basu-
Manning method [Basu and Manning, 2010].
ORBIT II patients.
Uniform inpatient billing
records were obtained for the elderly ORBIT II
patients (n = 297) and compared with a sample
(n = 308) of elderly Medicare coronary-stent
patients with reported CAC. Inpatient charges
were adjusted to costs using hospital-specific,
cost-to-charge ratios.
Medicare patients.
The Medicare comparison
sample was drawn from the 100% Standard
Analytical File (SAF) for the period September
2011 through December 2012. While a new
ICD-9-CM diagnosis code (414.4) was intro-
duced late in 2011 for severe CAC, actual docu-
mentation of CAC via administrative coding
practice has lagged. For example, only 1.7% of
patients with de novo PCIs were reported to have
CAC, and the significant degree of underreport-
ing of CAC in the Medicare population has
recently been described [Garrison et al. 2015].
This is the first published cost-effectiveness
analysis that relies to any extent on the
reporting and use of this ICD-9 code for de novo
PCI patients in the elderly Medicare
population.
The principal data sources for the control-arm
index procedure cost and survival analyses were
from the Medicare SAFs. The SAFs contain
seven datasets with detailed claims information
about healthcare services rendered to Medicare
beneficiaries in fee-for-service Medicare. SAFs
were available for institutional (e.g. inpatient,
outpatient, skilled nursing facility, hospice, or
home health agency) and noninstitutional (e.g.
physician and durable medical equipment pro-
viders) claim types. Data were organized at the
claim level and included basic beneficiary demo-
graphic information, date of service, diagnosis
and procedure code, provider number, and
reimbursement amount. Two SAF databases
were used: the Medicare 5% SAF and 100%
SAF. The 5% random sample of beneficiaries
included all relevant claims (e.g. inpatient, out-
patient, physician, durable medical equipment,
etc.) except drugs, which are tracked and
reported separately via Medicare Part D and
not readily accessible for evaluation. The 100%
files include inpatient and outpatient claims
only and include all fee-for-service beneficiaries;
Medicare Advantage program members are not
included.
For this comparison, a special subsample (n =
308) was defined from the 100% SAF that
included all hospitals (n = 17) that coded more
than 10% of their PCI patients as having CAC
(using code 414.4). This sample was used as the
control arm under the assumption that this sub-
set was more diligent and accurate in their
coding.

H-A/AP data.
For the indirect comparison of
postindex MACE rates, a new subanalysis, based
on the elderly population from the H-A/AP sam-
ple [Généreux et al. 2014], was used for patients
with severely calcified coronary lesions. This
included 205 patients with severe CAC. The
mean age was 73.7 years, somewhat older than
the average age of 71.4 years seen in the ORBIT
II study. Patients included in the H-A/AP study
presented with unstable angina, moderate- or
high-risk non-ST-segment elevation acute coro-
nary syndrome (ACS), or ST-segment elevation
myocardial infarction (MI). As shown in the Sup-
plemental Appendix Table, the ORBIT II and
H-A/AP samples had significant and comparable
histories of comorbidities, such as diabetes,
hypertension, and hyperlipidemia.
MACE rates, target lesion revascularization/
target vessel revascularization
For the OAS arm, estimated MACE rates were
drawn from the ORBIT II 1-year follow-up anal-
ysis [Généreux, 2015]. Estimates for the standard
therapy arm were based on the subanalysis of the
elderly population patients with severely calcified
coronary lesions from the H-A/AP sample
However, to simplify the comparison and the
model, only differences in target lesion revascu-
larization (TLR)/ target vessel revascularization
(TVR) were compared since most MIs would
occur during the index procedure.
MACE costs
The cost of MACEs, specifically for revasculari-
zation (TLR/TVR), was estimated using the
Medicare SAF samples. The 100% SAF sample
provides estimates of inpatient and outpatient
facility costs, but it does not include physician
fees. Inpatient charges were transformed to costs
using hospital-specific, cost-to-charge ratios.
The cost offsets for days 1­30 and days 31­365
were conservatively based on the difference in
revascularization between ORBIT II and H-A/
AP. In addition, a conservative episode-cost esti-
mate of US$20,000 was used, based on estimates
of facility costs in the Medicare SAF analyses of
PCI patients, but this did not include cardiolo-
gist or other provider fees.
Health outcomes: survival
For ORBIT II patients, cardiac death was used
as the 1-year outcome. For the standard
treatment, the estimate of cardiac death was
based on the elderly population patients with
severely calcified coronary lesions from the
H-A/AP sample. For the life expectancy calcula-
tion, the life-years gained estimate was based on
the median age and gender of an elderly PCI
patient (i.e. a 74-year-old man) who would nor-
mally have an expected an additional lifetime of
11.5 years. This was then adjusted down to 9.5
years after discounting at 3% per annum, which
is the standard practice in cost-effectiveness
analyses with a lifetime patient horizon [Gold
et al. 1996]. In addition, this is within the
expected range of life expectancy (5­11 years)
for patients with cardiovascular disease in this
age range (Peeters et al. 2002).
Cost-effectiveness
The parameter estimates needed to perform the
cost-effectiveness analysis are presented in
Table 2.
Sensitivity and scenario analyses
With the exception of the price of the OAS
device, all the parameters in the model are sub-
ject to some uncertainty; each was addressed by
varying the individual parameters within a range
of low to high values. The lower and higher val-
ues scenarios vary based on the assumption that
total cost offsets are lower by 25% or higher by
25%. In addition, the base-case cardiac-mortal-
ity differential of 2.6% was varied to 1% in the
low-value scenario, and 3% in the high-value
scenario. A one-way sensitivity analysis was car-
ried out to identify key drivers of the results. In
addition, a probabilistic sensitivity analysis was
conducted using the Monte Carlo simulation,
varying all of the parameters. Input ranges for
sensitivity analysis were estimated at +/- 25%.
Normal distributions were assigned to all prob-
abilities and costs. Means and 95% CIs for each
of the posterior distributions were computed on
the basis of 5000 iterations.
Results
Stent implantation
As shown in Table 3, considering both inpatient
and outpatient procedural costs, unadjusted
mean costs were lower by US$3198 (p = 0.003)
in ORBIT II patients compared with similar
Medicare patients. After adjusting for
J Chambers, P Généreux et al.
http://tac.sagepub.com 79
differences in age, gender, and comorbidities,
the ORBIT II mean costs were 17% lower
(approximately US$2700; p < 0.001). Both
unadjusted and adjusted costs are shown in
Figure 2. Mean length of stay in hospital was
lower in the ORBIT II arm by about 1 day. The
lower inpatient costs in the ORBIT II trial were
due, in part, to fewer complications (including
the occurrence of MACEs), which would lead
to a longer hospitalization, and any reductions
in the use of other supplies, such as guide wires,
would be reflected as well.
MACEs and costs
Key components of the MACE rate were signifi-
cantly lower in the ORBIT II elderly sample when
compared with estimates for elderly patients with
severely calcified lesions in the H-A/AP sample.
As shown in Figure 3, at 1 year, the cumulative
percentage experiencing cardiac death was 3.2%
in ORBIT II compared with 5.8% in the pooled
sample. The cumulative percentage for revascu-
larization was 4.9% in ORBIT II versus 11.3% in
the pooled sample, and for MI, it was 11.0% in
ORBIT II versus 11.4% in the pooled sample.

30-day MACEs and costs
It is important to note that some types of MACE
episodes in these patients are much more likely to
occur during the index procedure than afterwards.
In particular, in the ORBIT II trial, nearly all of
the MIs occurred during the index procedure.
The same breakdown of MACEs (i.e. during
index procedure versus postindex) was not availa-
ble for the H-A/AP data; hence, a direct compari-
son was not possible. As shown in Table 4,
revascularization rates within the 30 days follow-
ing the procedure were substantially lower for
ORBIT II patients versus H-A/AP patients (0.3%
versus 3.8%).
31­365-day MACEs and costs
As shown in Table 4, mean revascularization
rates in days 31­365 were slightly higher in
ORBIT II than in H-A/AP patients, 2.9% versus
2.0%, respectively.
Total first-year costs
The ORBIT II-Medicare comparison indicates
substantial cost offsets related to the index proce-
dure episode including associated MACEs. The
modeled comparison based on the pooled sample
supports cost offsets related to revascularization
in the first 30 days. From a facility or health-sys-
tem perspective, the total projected cost offsets in
the first year in this elderly population, on aver-
age, would fully cover the cost of OAS technology
at US$3795.
Mortality and life-years gained
As shown in Figure 3, cardiac mortality in the
overall ORBIT II elderly cohort was 3.2% com-
pared with 5.8% in the H-A/AP analysis cohort.
From an economic perspective, this differential

amounts to 2.6 lives saved or 29.9 life-years
gained for a cohort of 100 patients. Discounting
by 3% per annum for time preference, this
amounts to 0.247 years per OAS patient, i.e.
about one-quarter year per patient.
Cost-effectiveness
Table 5 presents the cost-effectiveness results for
both the base case and for alternative low-value and
high-value scenarios. In the base case, it is estimated
that the use of OAS technology would enable a slight
cost savings of about 1.2%. In addition, the average
patient would expect to gain 0.247 (discounted) life-
years. On average, the documented lower cost with
better outcomes, technically termed as `dominant',
suggests that the use of OAS technology is the clear
treatment of choice. At the more optimistic end of
the range, the cost savings could be as high as
US$1118 (US$4913 in savings compared with
US$3795 for the device). This savings projection
strongly supports clinical use of the OAS technology
for severely calcified patients, with the average
patient gaining 0.36 life-years. Even with more pes-
simistic assumptions, use of the device offers good
value at US$11,895 per life-year gained. This is far
below the `high-value' threshold of a US$50,000
cost per healthy life-year [Anderson et al. 2014].
Sensitivity analyses
Figure 4 summarizes the one-way sensitivity anal-
ysis in a tornado diagram. Not surprisingly, the
two key drivers are the price of the OAS device
and the cost offset during the index event. The
rates and cost of revascularization are also influ-
ential. However, in any case, even with a 25%
change (in either direction) of key parameters, the
projection suggests that the use of OAS technol-
ogy is highly cost-effective.
Figure 5 presents the results of the probabilistic
sensitivity analysis in a scatterplot of projected
cost-effectiveness ratios. The analysis showed
that the 95% CI for the incremental cost-effec-
tiveness ratio of OAS technology compared
with standard treatment was dominated,
US$2657 per life-year. The figure depicts the
resulting cost and effectiveness (in life-years)
from 5000 simulations of OAS technology and
standard treatment. OAS results were domi-
nant, which suggests that OAS technology is
less costly and more effective than the standard
treatment in 58.5% of simulation cases. Using
a conservative (high value) willingness to pay
US$50,000 per life-year, OAS technology was
projected to be cost-effective and thus high
value in approximately 99.9% of simulations
[Anderson et al. 2014].
Discussion
These parallel, indirect comparisons to the
Medicare claims data and to previous stent trials
suggest that the additional cost of the OAS tech-
nology in treating de novo, severely calcified coro-
nary lesions would likely be offset by other
downstream health-system cost savings. These
results represent a conservative estimate of poten-
tial savings. A less optimistic set of assumptions
for OAS technology use suggested a modest
increase in overall costs (US$848), but still pro-
duced a cost-effectiveness ratio that is deemed to
be high value when mortality reductions are con-
sidered. Given the expectation of better health
outcomes in terms of improved survival and fewer
MACE episodes, it is highly likely that this inter-
vention will be cost-effective from a health-system
perspective that considers both payer medical
care costs and health benefits to patients
themselves.

The major cost driver is the projected cost offset
due to reduced length of stay in hospital (by
avoiding complications) and lower costs during
the index procedure itself. The cost differential in
the index procedure reflects a variety of possible
factors, including fewer in-hospital MACEs (par-
ticularly MIs), fewer complications that lead to
longer stays, and reduced use of supplies, such as
guide wires. The impact on physician costs was
not included since neither dataset includes them.

The second major cost consideration was attrib-
uted to differences in the postprocedure MACE
rate, and particularly the need for revasculariza-
tion in the remainder of the first year. The H-A/
AP analysis of elderly patients showed a higher
overall revascularization rate in the first year, but
with the major difference appearing in the first 30
days following the index procedure. This would
be important to facilities that are at financial risk
for the cost of postoperative re-admissions in the
first 30 days. The significance of, and reasons for
the slightly higher mean revascularization rates in
days 31­365 for ORBIT II versus H-A/AP patients
are unclear, however, the difference is small and
does not greatly affect the overall 1-year differen-
tial. The mean age in the ORBIT II trial was 71.4
years [Chambers et al. 2014b], which is slightly
less than the 73.7 years in severely calcified
patients in the H-A/AP analysis. Older patients in
general have worse outcomes. Furthermore, the
ORBIT II study may have more patients with sta-
ble angina compared with the H-A/AP sample.
Patients with unstable angina or acute MI are
more likely to have recurring events versus a stable
angina population. This could bias the projected
savings upwards, though probably only slightly.
In any case, the sensitivity analysis demonstrates
that, even at the lower bound of the mortality
advantage, use of the OAS technology would be
highly cost-effective at about US$12,000 per life-
year gained. Even with an adjustment for lower
quality of life compared with a perfectly healthy
person, which was not calculated in this analysis,
this cost would be far below the high-value thresh-
old of US$50,000 per quality-adjusted life-year
proposed by Anderson and colleagues [Anderson
et al. 2014].
This analysis had several limitations. First, there
was lack of a direct comparator, as ORBIT II was
a single-arm study. Second, coding of CAC in the
Medicare data has lagged since its introduction
and therefore, was highly likely to have been
underreported at the time of this analysis. Third,
since the degree or severity of calcification is not
always known or estimated, it was unclear how
well the Medicare SAF sample compared with the
ORBIT II trial. While the retrospective compari-
son of this cohort has inherent bias, the H-A/AP
trials represent the largest cohort of patients with
severely calcified lesions ever published. While
using different cohorts with different demographic
characteristics is a limitation, we believe that these
cohorts are the best available population in the
current literature, and that they are appropriately
matched for calcification severity. Fourth,
although the multivariate cost equation for differ-
ences in the index PCI is potentially subject to
unmeasured confounding, the adjustment for the
Charlson index and other measured variables was
likely biased downwards due an underestimate of
the Charlson index in the ORBIT II sample.
Thus, their actual costs are lower than predicted.

and ACUITY [Stone et al. 2006] trials enrolled
patients with ACS. Patients with ACS have been
shown to have worse outcomes than patients with
stable angina. In addition, since morbidity-related
MACEs are higher with standard therapy, this
model likely underestimated the total impact of
patient-level, health-status improvements made
possible by the OAS technology because it does
not capture the negative impact that these events
have on a patient's quality of life. Finally, the
assumption about survival impact might be ques-
tioned because of the lack of a direct comparison.
ORBIT II may have been underpowered to meas-
ure this single component of the composite MACE
measure.
Conclusion
Relying on comparison of a single-arm trial to his-
torical data, the FDA approved the OAS technol-
ogy in October 2013 to improve outcomes in
difficult-to-treat PCI patients with severely calci-
fied coronary lesions. For this population, this
economic modeling analysis suggests that using
OAS technology is likely to result in lower inpa-
tient costs, particularly for the initial procedure
and during the immediate 30-day follow-up
period. Based on economic modeling from the
pivotal ORBIT II trial as well as indirect compari-
sons with other trial and Medicare data, the OAS
device likely represents both significant clinical
and highly cost-effective improvements in the
care of patients with severely calcified lesions
undergoing PCI.
