Abstract
Purpose: To investigate whether social interactions in friendship networks influence the following weight-related behaviors
of adolescents: exercising regularly, playing an active sport, hours of TV/Video viewing, sleeping six or fewer hours, eating
breakfast on weekdays, frequency of eating at fast food restaurants, eating five servings of fruits/vegetables daily, and
consuming calorie-dense snacks.
Method: Data from a nationally representative sample of adolescents are used to examine the association between peer
and individual weight-related behaviors. Evidence from multivariate regression analysis controlling for an extensive list of
individual- and family-level factors as well as school-level unobserved heterogeneity is obtained.
Results: We find a significant positive association between individuals' and friends' behaviors in terms of sports, exercise
and fast food consumption. The estimated associations are robust to controls for individual- and family-level factors,
unobserved heterogeneity at the school level and our attempts to account for non-random peer selection.
Conclusions: The social transmission of weight-related behaviors is a viable explanation for the spread of obesity in
friendship networks documented in recent research. Traditional weight reduction interventions may be fruitfully
complemented with strategies that focus on harnessing peer support to modify behaviors.

Introduction
Excess body weight among children and adolescents is one of the
most pressing health problems today. The percentage of overweight
children age 6­11 has more than doubled and the percentage of
overweight adolescents age 12­19 has more than tripled since late
1970s [1]. In 2003­2004, 37.2% of children ages 6 to 11, and 34.3% of
adolescents ages 12 to 19 were overweight or at risk for overweight [2].
Since the dramatic increase in average weight and obesity has
occurred in genetically stable populations, the weight gains can be
attributed to environmental factors related to calorie intake and/or
physical activity. Indeed, poor dietary choices and health behaviors
such as skipping breakfast, a diet low in fruits and vegetables, eating at
fast food restaurants and consuming calorie-dense snacks, all of which
are associated with a risk of abnormal weight-gain and adiposity
among children and adolescents, have been on the rise [3­6].
Children's consumption of calories from fast food is estimated to
have risen from 2% of total energy intake in the late 1970s to 10%
of energy intake in the 1990s [7]. Between 1965 and 1991,
breakfast consumption by children ages 8 to 10 and adolescents
declined by 9% and 13%, respectively [8]. Furthermore, while the
average size of a snack and the caloric energy per snack have
remained relatively constant between 1977 and 1999, the
frequency of snacking among children increased significantly [9].
In light of evidence that sedentary behaviors such as watching
TV/video are associated with obesity [10­13], researchers have
argued that the lack of opportunity to engage in physical activity in
schools and the growing availability of more sedentary alternatives
as opposed to traditional sports-related leisure pursuits may have
contributed to the rising prevalence of overweight among children
and adolescents. While surveys of adolescents, beginning in the
1990s, have suggested little or no decrease in the level of physical
exercise across those cohorts and a relatively stable level of
sedentary activities [14­16], the long-term trends in how
adolescents use time and their level of physical activity is unclear
because of the lack of comparable data.
Social interactions may also have contributed to the rapid rise in
obesity [17,18]. Although it is difficult to talk about causality, a
number of observational studies have used data on the social
networks of adults to document a positive correlation between
adults' weight and the average weight of their peers [18]. Several
studies reached similar results in terms of adolescents' weight and
the weight of their peers [19­22]. However, the nature of the social
interactions that cause the apparent spread of obesity in social
PLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 June 2011 | Volume 6 | Issue 6 | e21179
networks is not well understood. Burke and Heiland [17] considered
the possibility of interactions on weight through social weight norms
and showed how an increase in the reference group's average
weight can result in additional calorie consumption and weight gain.
Individuals' lifestyle choices may also be directly influenced by peer
behavior. For example, as regular exercise and sports become more
popular in an individual's social network, the chances that the
individual also engages in these pastimes increases, perhaps because
of interest stimulated by the peer involvement in this activity or
social pressures to conform to the group behavior.
In addition to the evidence supporting social interaction on
weight, peer influences have been found in various health-related
behaviors, ranging from smoking [23,24], alcohol use [25], other
health risky behaviors [26,27], to health care utilization and
preventative care [28]. To date, much of the attention to the social
transmission of weight-related behaviors among children and
adolescents has been on eating disorders [29­31]. A notable
exception is the study by Fletcher [32], who analyzed peer effects
on adolescents' time spent watching TV.
However, estimates of the relationship between social networks
and health behaviors have been viewed with skepticism, largely from
the failure to address the issues of peer selection and environmental
confounders [19,20,27]. Peer selection implies that the correlation in
behavior could be attributed to the similarity among individuals,
whereas peer influence implies that the correlation is due to the peer
behavior itself. Disentangling the peer influence from spurious
unobserved factors associated with peer selection is important if we
are to accurately estimate the relationship between the behaviors of
the individual and that of their peers. Thus, if there are common
underlying attributes of individuals within a peer group that drive
behavior more than peer influence itself, policies aimed at taking
advantage of peer influence may not realize the desired effects
[23,25,26]. However, it is important to note that there is
disagreement in the literature as to how to adjust for peer selection
and choice of the methodology to account for this in most cases is
driven by the data set that is being utilized in the study [27]. We
elaborate further on this point in the Statistical Analyses section when
we discuss our attempt to account for peer selection.
Environmental confounders, on the other hand, refer to factors
that might be common to all adolescents living in the same
environment, or community-specific factors influencing the
outcome of all individuals in the same reference group. These
effects, when unmeasured, can lead us to incorrectly attribute
social network effects in individual outcomes when none might
exist. For example, a higher concentration of fast-food restaurants
or scare public recreational facilities in a neighborhood could
simultaneously affect the eating pattern or exercise habits of all
individuals in networks within the community. Thus, caution
should be exercised in attributing causality to correlations in
outcomes between friends when environmental confounders are
not adequately accounted for.
The present research provides a comprehensive investigation of
the relationship between peer and individual weight-related
behaviors among adolescents. We consider seven previously un-
examined behaviors related to physical activity and diet (energy
expenditure and intake): regular physical exercise, participation in
a sport, eating breakfast, eating at fast food restaurants, consuming
five servings of fruits/vegetable daily, calorie-dense snacking, and
six or fewer hours of nightly sleep. In addition, we analyze whether
there are interaction effects in TV viewing in networks of close
friends, which complements Fletcher's [32] study of TV viewing
behavior among schoolmates. The current study builds on
previous research supporting peer effects related to obesity in
general by looking at specific behaviors that may be responsible for
the spread of obesity in social networks. We hypothesize that
behaviors that are easily observable by other adolescents are better
candidates for peer interaction effects. Hence, individual sleep
habits and breakfast consumption, which are not directly
observable by peers, should be less likely to be influenced by the
respective peer behaviors than participation in sports, exercise, or
eating at fast food restaurants, which are activities that directly
benefit from peer participation.
Materials and Methods
Data Source
The data for this study are drawn from the National Longitudinal
Survey of Adolescent Health (henceforth ``Add Health''). Add
Health surveyed adolescents in grades 7 to 12 in 132 schools
nationwide in the U.S. Beginning with an in-school questionnaire
administered to a nationally representative sample of students in
grades 7 through 12 in 1994­95 (Wave 1), the study follows up with
a series of in-home interviews of respondents approximately one
year (Wave 2; 1996), six years (Wave 3; 2001­2002), and thirteen
years later (Wave 4; 2007­2008).
A unique feature of Add Health is that the first two waves
(1994­95 and 1996) contain information on individuals' nomina-
tions of their closest friends. Since these friends were also surveyed,
peer measures of weight-related behaviors can be constructed from
actual responses. We also employ parental information from the
parent questionnaire administered in the in-home survey in the
first wave. (A full description of the sample design, data and
documentation is available at www.cpc.unc.edu/addhealth.)
The samples in this study are drawn primarily from the wave II
(1996) respondents in grades 7 through 12 with at least one
nominated friend. Where possible, we link data from the first and
second wave of the in-home survey (not all respondents were
interviewed in both waves, and some nominated friends were not
surveyed).Our analysis is based on samples of 3,898 adolescents
and their peers. The average number of nominated friends per
individual is 2.54, and approximately 85% of the friends are from
the same school as the respondent. Detailed summary statistics on
adolescent and peer weight-related behaviors for our analysis are
in Table 1, while Table 2 reports the corresponding descriptive
statistics for the control variables. The measures that we
constructed from wave I (1994­95) data and linked to the
adolescents interviewed in 1996 are noted in the tables.
Measures
Dependent Variables. We consider eight weight-related
behaviors: (i) Exercise ­ a binary variable indicating whether the
respondent reported exercising three or more times during the past
seven days; (ii) Sports ­ a binary variable indicating whether the
individual reported playing an active sport such as baseball, softball,
soccer, swimming or football; (iii) Hours of television/video viewing
- the weekly hours of television viewing, including watching videos
and playing video games; (iv) Sleep six hours or less ­ a binary
variable indicating whether the individual usually gets six or fewer
hours of nightly sleep; (v) Breakfast ­ a binary variable indicating
whether the individual usually eats breakfast on weekday mornings;
(vi) Fast food ­ the number of days in the past week the adolescent
ate in a fast food restaurant such as McDonald's, Taco Bell, or KFC;
(vii) Five Servings of Fruits or Vegetables ­ a binary variable
indicating whether the adolescent had at least five servings of fruits
or vegetables the previous day; (viii) Calorie-dense Snack ­ a binary
variable indicating whether the adolescent consumed calorie-dense
snacks (doughnuts, sweet rolls, muffins, pastries, cookies, brownies/
pie, etc.) the previous day.

Independent Variables. The members of a social network
are identified based on the set of close friends nominated by the
respondent. For each adolescent we constructed measures of the
percentages of his or her friends who exercise, play sports, get six or
fewer hours of sleep, and regularly have breakfast, and measures of
their average reported hours of television viewing and average
number of days of eating in a fast food restaurant. We examine the
robustness of the link between peer and individual behaviors to
various controls, including demographic characteristics of the
individual (age, gender, education and race) and whether the
adolescent had been taught about the problems related to being
overweight or underweight in school. In addition, using the data
from the parent survey, we employed controls for a number of
parental characteristics, including whether the adolescent lives with
both biological parents, the parents' level of education, whether
both parents work full time, family income, whether the parents
chose their residence because of the school district and how old the
adolescent was when they first moved into the district. Other
parental measures considered are whether the parent plays an active
sport (in the exercise and sport models), whether the parent allows
the adolescent to decide how much television to watch (in the hours
of television model), whether the parent allows the adolescent to
decide when to go to bed (in the sleep model), and whether the
parent allows the adolescent to decide what to eat (in the eating
behaviors models). Hereafter, we refer to the latter indicators as
parental weight-related activities. Finally, we use information on
individuals' current and past BMIs, along with the current and past
average BMIs of the peer group. We also estimated our models with
BMI percentiles and BMI z-scores and the results were consistent
with the ones reported here. We report the results with BMI to be
consistent with the previous literature and to make our results
comparable to them [18].

related behaviors, b1
by estimating relatively parsimonious models
and then consider models with an increasingly large set of controls
to assess the robustness of the estimated peer effects.
Identifying social network effects in observational data is not
without its challenges. First, there is the concern about confounding
resulting from non-random selection of friends. Second, unobserved
characteristics in the shared environment that affect all individuals in
the social network may also cause environmental confounding.
These confounding factors, if unaccounted for, can cause correla-
tions suggestive of social network effects when none are present. We
address this problem by estimating models that control for a large set
of individual- and family-level factors, as well as school-level fixed
effects, which capture unobserved characteristics common to
adolescents from the same school and any other unmeasured
school-specific influences. For example, schools will differ in the
proximity to fast food restaurants, a well documented determinant of
students' poor nutrition and overweight [33], as well as in the
availability of vending machines, meal plans, and opportunities to
expend energy (built environment, exercise facilities, etc.).
In addition to models with standard individual- and family-level
controls (demographics, parents' education, etc.), we estimate models
that control for individuals' and their peers' current (1996) and
previous (1994) BMIs in order to control for the selection of friends
based on weight status [18,19,34]. Peer BMI may proxy for the
group's weight norm [17] and directly influence adolescents' exercise
and food choices. We also utilize data on whether the family moved
recently and whether the neighborhood was selected for the school
district. Accounting for parental location preferences may further
reduce the bias from non-random selection of friends [22,27].
As mentioned earlier, there is no consensus in the literature as to
the most appropriate methodology to account for non-random
peer selection. Some studies have argued for using a measure of
social network at a more exogenous level, such as the
neighborhood or school level [27]. However, a problem with this
approach is that social networks at such aggregated levels might
not be relevant, i.e., these might not be the networks that influence
individual behaviors [27]. Another suggested approach is to
account for parental location preferences along with school-level
fixed effects and controls for certain outcomes that might be
driving the selection [18,27]. For example, in the obesity and peer
effects literature [18], individuals and their peers' lagged and
contemporaneous body weights have been used to account for
peer selection that might be driven by body weights. In another
literature that focuses on risky health behaviors among adolescents
such as drinking and drug use [27], peer selection was accounted
for by controlling for parental location preferences and school-
level fixed effects. The rationale is that for adolescents it is
primarily the parents' location decision that determines with
whom their children associate. To the extent that this is true,
unobserved environmental confounders and factors that might
drive residential location preferences can account for peer
selection.
Our empirical strategy is a combination of these approaches.
Specifically, we include individual and their peers' BMI to account
for peer selection based on body weight, while acknowledging that
body weight is not the only factor driving friendship selection. In
addition, our controls for school-level fixed effects and parental
location preferences attempt to account for that possibility that
parents' location decisions affect peer selection.
Results
The estimates of the peer effects from various models without
school-level fixed effects are shown in Table 3, and the estimates
with school-level fixed effects are reported in Table 4. For the
binary outcomes, we report marginal effects estimated from probit
models at the mean values of the independent variables. The hours
of television viewing and the number of days eating in a fast food
restaurant are treated as continuous variables, and the corre-
sponding estimates are based on linear regression models.
Column 1 of Table 3 presents estimates from our baseline
model, which controls only for the adolescents' demographics.
Comparison of the results from the baseline model to models that
control for individual- and family-level factors allows us to
investigate the robustness of the estimated network effects. In
particular, the model in column 2 also controls for parental
characteristics (including parental education and income and
whether the individual lives with both biological parents). In
column 3, a measure for whether the adolescent was taught about
the problems related to being overweight or underweight in school
is added, together with other parental measures, including whether
the current residential location was chosen because of the school
district, how old the respondent was when he/she moved to the
current location, and indicators for parental activities. The model
in column 4 adds the individuals' own lagged BMIs, and models in
columns 5­7 also include peers' lagged BMIs, peers' contempo-
raneous BMIs and individuals' own contemporaneous BMIs. We
report only the estimated peer effects in Tables 3 and 4, and we
report the full sets of estimates based on the most comprehensive
models (column 7) in Tables 5 and 6. (The estimates from models
without school-level fixed effects are in Table 5, and the estimates
from models with school-level fixed effects are in Table 6.)
The estimates from the baseline model, which includes only peer
and demographic variables (see column 1 of Table 3), suggest that
having friends who are more engaged in weight-related behaviors is
associated with an increase in individuals' participation in these
activities. This result holds for all weight-related behaviors except
for sleeping six or fewer hours. The effects are sizeable across
behaviors, with peer influence having the greatest effect on
participation in a sport and eating at fast food restaurants. After
family-level information is added, the estimates in columns 2 and 3
decrease in magnitude slightly. The greatest change in the
magnitudes occurs in model 5, where we add peers' lagged BMIs
to account for the selection of friends. The estimated coefficients
change little after peers' contemporaneous BMIs and individuals'
own contemporaneous BMIs are included in columns 6 and 7,
respectively. In the most comprehensive model in Table 3
(column 7), we find positive and statistically significant associations
for all behaviors except for getting six or fewer hours of sleep.
The fact that the estimates of the peer influence change in
magnitude across different model specifications is consistent with
the idea that there are confounding factors that can bias the effect
of peers on individuals' behaviors. However, we cannot rule out
that even the most comprehensive model in Table 3, model 7,
overstates the peer effects because of other confounding factors for
which we do not account. In an attempt to minimize the bias
further, we re-estimate all models in Table 3 with school-level
fixed effects. The corresponding estimates in Table 4 suggest that
only exercise, sports, and eating at fast food restaurants have
consistently positive and significant social network effects after
accounting for unmeasured school-specific influences. The esti-
mated effects in Table 4 are smaller than those in Table 3,
suggesting that the unmeasured heterogeneity across schools
introduces upward bias in the peer effects estimates.

The results from our most comprehensive model, Model 7, in
Table 4 suggest that, on average, a 10 percentage points increase
in the proportion of friends who exercise is associated with a 0.79
percentage points (p = 0.025) greater likelihood that the individual
exercises. The effect of a same-size increase in the proportion of
friends who participate in an active sport is a 1.84 percent points
(p,0.001) greater likelihood that the individual participates in an
active sport. A one-day increase in the average number of
weekdays friends eat at fast food restaurants is associated with a
0.18 (p,0.001) increase in the number of days the adolescent eats
in a fast food restaurant. The estimated peer effects associated with
these three activities change little across specifications, as shown in
Table 4. We find no evidence that hours of TV viewing, sleeping
six or fewer hours, eating breakfast, eating five servings of fruits/

Weight-Related Behavior among Adolescents
PLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 5 June 2011 | Volume 6 | Issue 6 | e21179
vegetables or consuming calorie-dense snacks is affected by friends'
engagement in such activities when unobserved school-level
factors are accounted for. However, the coefficients on all these
activities are positive and it is possible that we cannot reject the
null hypothesis of no effect due to the sampling error. It is also
important to note that the weight-related behaviors were not
significantly associated with the BMI (Table 6); this could
potentially be due to unobserved heterogeneity (e.g. genetic
predisposition) and from having BMI in 1994 and 1996 highly
correlated.
As a further robustness check of our estimates we performed a
sensitivity analysis by restricting the sample to only those with
Table 5. Detailed Estimates from Full Specification (without school­level Fixed Effects).

stable friendship links between waves 1 and 2, i.e. the individual
who were nominated as friends in both the waves. The rationale
for this analysis was to test whether our estimates (after
accounting for peer selection) were driven by a change in
friends' pool composition between the waves. These restrictions
lead to a reduction of the sample size by 199 from our preferred
specification. However, it is important to note here that Add
Health did not allow us to indentify whether this reduction in the
sample was because these individuals were no longer friends or
whether the nominated friends were no longer part of the survey.
The estimates from the restricted sample were quantitatively
very similar to the estimates presented above, suggesting that our

Weight-Related Behavior among Adolescents
PLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 7 June 2011 | Volume 6 | Issue 6 | e21179
results are not driven by a change in the friendship network
composition.
Discussion
This study investigates the spread of weight-related behaviors in
adolescents' friendship networks. Utilizing a longitudinal research
design and a representative sample from the Add Health, we
examine the influence of peer behaviors on adolescents'
engagement in eight weight-related behaviors. We find significant
peer effects for pursuing an active sport, regular exercise, and the
frequency of eating in fast food restaurants, suggesting that an
individual is more likely to engage in these behaviors if his or her
friends do.
We find no consistent evidence in support of peer effects on TV
viewing, sleeping six or less hours, or on eating breakfast, calorie-
dense snacks, or five servings of fruits and vegetables. Adolescents
engage in these activities primarily in their parents' homes, which
limits both the extent to which these behaviors are self-directed by
the adolescent as well as how observable they are to friends; this is
especially true for hours of sleep and breakfast consumption. In
addition, we find that the association between friends' average TV
viewing and that of the individual declines considerably and
becomes statistically insignificant after accounting for unobserved
factors at the school level. A similar result is obtained for unhealthy
snack food consumption, another activity where peer influences
are plausible. Our findings for TV viewing complement Fletcher
[32], who documented a sizable association between school-level
and individual-level TV viewing. We find weaker and statistically
insignificant associations after accounting for school-level unob-
served heterogeneity. While the estimates are not directly
comparable across studies since we use close friends as reference
group rather than all schoolmates, our results cast doubt on the
presence of peer effects on TV viewing.
Our study contributes to the emerging literature on the
potential mechanisms by which obesity may spread within social
networks [17­22]. It also has significant implications for
understanding the influence of person-specific behaviors that are
related to obesity in adolescence, a time when individuals become
vulnerable to weight gain and peer influence. Determining the
weight-related behaviors most salient to peer influence has direct
policy implications by suggesting the behaviors within social
networks that should be the focus of interventions.
Our findings indicate that any policy intervention that alters the
weight-related behavior of an individual who is embedded in a
social network might also have an indirect effect on the behavior of
untreated adolescents who are in the same social network [35]. It
may be fruitful to complement traditional weight reduction
interventions with strategies that focus on harnessing peer support
to modify behaviors and, especially among adolescents, strategies
that target norms regarding sports, exercise, and eating fast food.
Given that these behavioral norms will tend to differ across groups,
the effectiveness of an intervention will likely be enhanced by
taking into account the particular peer environment. By reducing
calories from fast food and increasing physical activity levels
among adolescents, such interventions may help reverse current
trends in adolescent obesity. Finally, the findings of our study are
consistent with the idea that changing physical activity and food
norms has contributed to the spread of obesity. However, this
consistency does not rule out weight norms as additional channel
[17,18]. Also, to the extent that these results reflect peer selection,
(i.e. the observed associations might themselves be a product of
peer selection) they might be of limited use as policy levers aimed
at encouraging healthy body weights.
Several limitations of our research warrant elaboration. Even
after accounting for common unobserved influences at the school
level, the relationships that we found to be significant may be
driven in part by the correlated effects within smaller groups. This
is a concern since the individual selects his or her friends, who will
tend to be similar to the individual. Although we utilize both
lagged and contemporaneous measure of body weight along with
school-level fixed effects and parental location preferences, it is
likely that selection could be conditioned on other unobserved
characteristics, such as degree of risk aversion. If common
attributes and environmental factors that influence adolescents'
weight-related behaviors are not captured by our individual- and
family-level controls or by the school-level fixed effects, the
estimates presented here may overstate the influence of friend
networks. In that regard, future studies should investigate further
how friendship ties are formed. For example, future research could
examine whether friendship ties are more likely to form between
individuals with similar observable traits after controlling for
demographics and environmental confounders [36]. On a similar
note it might also be worthwhile to examine whether the spread of
one behavior in social networks (e.g. fast-food consumption) might
influence the spread of another (e.g. unhealthy snacking). This
would be similar to the Mednick et al. [37] study which found that
the spread of sleep patterns in social networks also have an impact
on marijuana consumption in the social networks. In addition,
future study should look into whether peer effects in obesity
operate via pathways other than the ones examined here, for
example, economic insecurity [38]. Another potential limitation of
the current study is our reliance on self-reported behaviors.
However, to the extent that the measurement error in the peer
group activities is classical, the estimated magnitudes of the peer
effects will be conservative.
