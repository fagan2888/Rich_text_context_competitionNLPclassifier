Introduction
The past three decades have witnessed a rapid development
of cognitive science in both theoretical exploration and prac-
tical application in every corner of cognition. Language
teaching and learning are no exception. With the new ideas
of cognitive science introduced into language education,
researchers are looking beyond the mere examination of
teacher behaviors and are studying teacher cognitions from
different perspectives (Borg, 2006; Borko & Putnam, 1996;
Calderhead, 1996; Cheng & Tang, 2010; Ernest, 2001;
Gebhard, 2009; Johnson, 2006; Kelly, 2006; Lantolf, 2004;
Raymond, 1997; Shulman, 1986b). Shulman (1986a) and
Brown and Barid (1993) have recommended a more compre-
hensive study of the wide variety of teachers' cognitions and
their relationship to a broader repertoire of teaching actions
in the classroom. Artzt and Thomas (2012) have conducted a
systematic investigation on a relationship between teacher's
instructional practice and their underlying cognitive models
from a cognitive perspective, with the findings that knowl-
edge, beliefs, and goals directly have formed a network of
cognitive models that direct and control the instructional
behaviors of teachers in the classroom. Teacher cognition has
played an active role in classroom decision making and is cru-
cial to the process of teaching. Understanding teacher cogni-
tion as a means of being better able to understand what it is to
be a language teacher is very fundamental (Borg, 2006). Work
examining the "processes" of teacher cognition is, to some
degree, correlated to significant change in teacher trainee's
belief, which would comprise teachers' professional practice
(Borg, 2009, 2011). All these researches have suggested the
importance of examining teachers' cognitive models.
For English as a Second Language (ESL) or English as a
Foreign Language (EFL) teachers, the identification and
research into cognitive models they develop can be a basis
for enabling them to voice their internal thought on their
instructional practice and underlying cognitions in a struc-
tured, comprehensive manner. A close examination of the
cognitive models may not only provide them with some
insights into their knowledge structure, but also provide ESL
or EFL teachers with the same awareness, which, in turn, can
help them to reorganize or make adjustments to their instruc-
tional practice. However, in ESL or EFL teacher research,
much existing literature has primarily explored the content

Exploring EFL Teachers' Cognitive Models
Through Metaphor Analysis
Hui Xiong1, Lan Li1, and Yingmei Qu2
Abstract
This study aims to investigate how a group of Chinese university teachers developed their cognitive models by using "English
as a Foreign Language (EFL) teachers" metaphors. The research method includes an open-ended questionnaire, a checklist
questionnaire, and verbal reports. The goal for this research is twofold. First, we will present those metaphors we believe
to be the most frequently used or most central in shaping the thoughts or ideas they have had for EFL teaching and learning.
Second, we will provide a description of their internal process of developing cognitive models, as well as factors that could
account for such models. The findings showed that (a) most of us had three ways of understanding EFL teachers in terms of
the educational journey metaphor, the educational building metaphor, and the educational conduit metaphor; (b) we used
such a cluster of converging cognitive models as the instructor model, the transmitter model, and the builder model to
construct definitions for EFL teachers, with the instructor model as a central model; and (c) metaphor can actually serve as a
useful, effective, and analytic tool for making us aware of the cognitive model underlying our conceptual framework.

of teachers' cognitions, whereas the "process" of language
teachers' cognitive thinking has remained relatively unex-
plored (Borg, 2006, 2009). To fill this gap, in this article, the
authors conduct investigations into how groups of Chinese
university teachers constructed their cognitive thinking or
models by using their metaphors in a specific context of EFL
teaching in China, where English is instructed just as a sub-
ject rather than for a communicative purpose.
Literature Review
Cognitive models and metaphors provide the rationale for
this study. According to Lakoff (1987), people organize
knowledge by means of structures called idealized cognitive
models (ICMs), which, in turn, allow them to theorize, con-
struct, and understand the world. Such models come from
four sources: Fillmore's frame semantics, Lakoff and
Johnson's theory of metaphor and metonymy, Langacker's
cognitive grammar, and Fauconnier's theory of mental
spaces (Lakoff, 1987). These models are derived from basic
principles of cognition (Anderson & Lebiere, 1998). A cog-
nitive model is a coherent, in large part nonlinguistic, knowl-
edge structure, and a representation of multimodal conceptual
entities (Evans, 2006) that can be used as a basis for percep-
tual simulations (see Barsalou, 1999; and others, for exam-
ple, Jesse, 2002; Zwaan, 2004).
Lakoff (1999) has established a theory of embodied cog-
nition and claimed that our concepts and forms of reason
arise from our bodily structures, sensorimotor experiences,
and interactions with the environment. In their claim, they
have also identified the importance of imaginative capacities
and metaphor in cognition, without which we could not fur-
ther structure or understand our experience. Another one of
the most important claims they have made is that we are usu-
ally unaware of our thought process, which has been referred
to as "backstage cognition" by Fauconnier (1994). In sum-
mary, cognitive models relate to coherent bodies of knowl-
edge, procedural knowledge, and knowledge of more abstract
entities. They are built from our personal interaction with the
surrounding environment both linguistically and non-
linguistically, modified and renewed by ongoing experience.
As for the way cognitive models of ESLor EFLteachers are
studied, a number of researchers in language teacher education
have demonstrated that metaphors represent cognitive and
affective distillations of teachers' fundamental knowledge
about teaching (Cortazzi & Jin, 1996). Metaphor, as a mediat-
ing psychological tool, plays an important role in cognitive
modeling, and is held to serve as evidence of its role in structur-
ing not only how we talk but also how we think and act (Lakoff,
1984). The essence of metaphor is seen in how one mental
domain is conceptualized in terms of another (Lakoff, 1993).
According to Lakoff and Johnson, metaphor is what makes our
abstract thought possible, and a large part of self-understanding
is the search for appropriate personal metaphors that make
sense of our lives. The purpose of self-understanding is the
continual development of new life stories about ourselves.
Metaphors can serve as a means for teachers to verbalize their
"professional identity" and have, thus, played an important
role in teachers'personal practical knowledge. In other words,
metaphors can indicate the way teachers think about teaching
and, therefore, direct the way they act in the classroom
(Clandinin, 1986; Ellis, 2001, 2003; Kramsch, 2003; Pajak,
1986; Zapata & Lacorte, 2007). With metaphors, teachers will
mediate understanding of their beliefs about teaching in the
classroom and accordingly to predict behaviors likely to fol-
low from them (de Guerrero & Villamil, 2002). Provenzo,
McCloskey, Kottkamp, and Cohn (1989) have pointed out that
it is only by a process of critical reflection on metaphors that
language teachers can understand and combine the unknown
into what they already know. Hart (2009) has conducted an
intensive investigation into the effects of sharing and discuss-
ing metaphors for cognition in terms of writing and found that
discussing metaphors can promote mutual understanding
between students and teachers and, thus, resolve classroom
conflicts. In a sense, metaphors can function as a powerful tool
in gaining insight into students' and teachers' cognition (Li,
2011). Metaphor is a useful way of bringing implicit assump-
tions to awareness, encouraging reflection, finding contradic-
tions, and fostering change in educational beliefs and practices
(see, for example, Cameron & Maslen, 2010; de Guerrero &
Villamil, 2002; Munby, 1987; Tobin, 1990).
Recognizing the critical role metaphors play in conceptu-
alizing fields of knowledge, educational researchers have
been using metaphor as a research tool to investigate lan-
guage teacher's cognition (Cameron & Low, 1999). The
study of teachers' metaphors appears to be a fruitful, indi-
rect way to reveal important aspects of teachers' cognition:
for example, how teachers plan or make decisions, or how
they give meaning to their experience (Munby, 1986). In
short, metaphor is an essential mental tool, which should be
harnessed as an instrument of imaginative rationality
(Lakoff & Johnson, 1980), or a problem-solving device
applicable to all fields, including language learning and
teaching. Metaphors have a function of organizing system-
atic concepts in teacher's cultural-cognitive models of learn-
ing (Riley, 1997). It has been documented that metaphor has
a preponderant place as a cognitive tool (Green, 1993; Petrie
& Oshlag, 1993) and as a teaching one (Low, 1988;
Martinez-Duenas, 1988; Ponterotto, 1994; Sticht, 1994).
Thus, one method of making EFL teachers more aware of
their cognitive models is to encourage them to examine the
way they use metaphors to describe their understanding of
language teaching.
The Study
Research Questions
This empirical research was designed to address three ques-
tions as follows:
Xiong et al. 3
Research Question 1: How do Chinese EFL university
teachers use metaphors to describe their beliefs concern-
ing English teachers?
Research Question 2: What cognitive models do Chinese
EFL university teachers develop by using such metaphors?
Research Question 3: What are the factors that might
result in the differences in EFL teachers' cognitive
models?
Participants
There were two groups of participants taking part in this
study during two stages. The first group participating in the
study during the first stage was comprised of 20 EFL univer-
sity teachers randomly selected from 11 Chinese universities
(5 engineering colleges and 6 regular universities), most of
them are Chinese visiting scholars to the University of
California (UC), Berkeley or other universities so as to
ensure the representativeness and reliability of the samples.
All the participants of this study have at least 8 years of
English teaching experience, 18 of whom have received PhD
degrees in applied linguistics or American literature.
The second group was comprised of 30 EFL teachers ran-
domly selected from the Department of Foreign Language at a
university in China. Compared with the first group, the degrees
the second group have received are comparatively lower, and
95% of them have just received MA degrees in linguistics or
literature. In total, 15 participants from the second group have
admitted taking part in some professional teaching training
before or after their engagement in English teaching.
Instruments
Three methods were used in the whole research: The first
method was an open-ended questionnaire, the second method
was a checklist questionnaire, and the third method was ver-
bal reports. Below is a detailed description of each.
Open-ended questionnaire.To validate how efficiently EFL
teachers could generate metaphors to make sense of their
own experiences and understanding of the English language,
teaching, and learning in a very natural way, a questionnaire
(Appendix A) was worked out and conducted among the first
group of 20 EFL university teachers during the first stage in
December 2012. The questionnaire followed Wan's (2007)
framework on metaphor elicitation and consisted of two
parts: (a) their demographical information, such as educa-
tional background, current academic position, years of teach-
ing experience, and so on; and (b) a metaphor elicitation task
by asking them to complete three specific open-ended ques-
tions: (i) An English teacher is . . . , because . . . ; (ii) English
learning means . . . ; and (iii) The English language is . . . . To
ensure the validity of questionnaire results, all the participants
in the first group were required to write down at least three
sentences but not more than five as the answers to each ques-
tion in metaphorical language, the length of each sentence
being limited to 10 words, for in this way, participants would
be prevented from using a single metaphor repeatedly while
others would use a broader range. All of these instructions
were given orally before the questionnaire. As the research
aims to investigate how participants used metaphors to
describe their very basic cognitive beliefs as EFL teachers, it
does not matter whether they use the same conceptual meta-
phors repeatedly. All the data obtained from this part would
serve as the basis for the checklist questionnaire.
Checklist questionnaire. The author has collected 60 sentences
from the first group of participants in the open-ended question-
naire. After that, the author analyzed all the sentences through
the traditional approach outlined by Cameron and Low (1999)
and found that only 20 of them were analyzable and, therefore,
valid. To illuminate underlying themes in our participants'
responses, the authors systematically examined some influential
books in the field of both language teaching and general educa-
tion (Bailey & Nunan, 1996; Brookfield, 1995; Oxford, 1990;
Vygotsky, 1978) and included four metaphors (English teacher
as competitor, mind-and-behavior controller, repeater, and
entertainer) from studies conducted by other researchers
(Oxford et al., 1998) as well as two metaphorical statements
(English teacher as conduit and nurturer) made by educational
theorists and methodologists (Oxford et al., 1998), all six meta-
phors being common and popular in the field of EFL teaching
(Oxford et al., 1998). Combined with the above-mentioned
metaphors, a checklist questionnaire consisting of 26 metaphors
(Appendix B) was distributed to the second group of 30 EFL
teachers randomly selected from the Department of Foreign
Language at a university in China. The questionnaire was
designed to address two questions: (a) How similar or different
are EFL teachers' metaphors of the English language teaching
and learning compared with the group members? and (b) How
are the metaphors EFL teachers have generated in their instruc-
tional practice linked to their cognitive models?
Verbal reports.There are a variety of procedures that could
be used to investigate how human beings think through tasks,
among which verbal reports are considered as an appropriate
data source (Hamilton, Nussbaum, & Snow, 1997; Leighton
& Gierl, 2007; Norris, 1990). A verbal report is an individu-
al's description of his or her internal processes and, there-
fore, is used to develop cognitive models (Ericsson & Simon,
1993). Verbal reports are usually conducted using one-to-one
interviews. Thus, in this research, to investigate the factors
determining differences in cognitive models, 10 EFL teach-
ers were asked to verbalize every thought that came to mind
when the metaphor was generated or selected.
The questions from the interview are shown inAppendix C.
Data Collection and Analysis
All the linguistic metaphors EFL teachers generated to
describe their knowledge about English language teaching and
learning, and selected from other studies, were first coded and
4 SAGE Open
then categorized into conceptual metaphors by following the
traditional approach created by Cameron and Low (1999),
which involves four steps: (a) naming/labeling, (b) sorting
(clarification and elimination), (c) categorization, and (d)
analyzing data (also see Saban & Kocbeker, 2007).
Accordingly, each linguistic metaphor was analyzed to iden-
tify three elements: a source domain (i.e., an English teacher),
a target domain (i.e., the term with which the source domain
is compared), and a source-to-target mapping (i.e., a struc-
tural correlation between a source domain and a target
domain). Then, based on the inferential structure of the meta-
phor, on the entailments, and on the similarities with other
metaphors, three conceptual categories were generated from
the 26 metaphors, and they were ranked from the most fre-
quently chosen to the least frequently chosen. One point the
author attempted to make is that there seems to be no corre-
spondence between the number of metaphors participants
used and the frequency of metaphors as options. As shown in
Table 1, we have nine options for the "journey" metaphor, 13
for the "building" metaphor, and four for the "conduit" meta-
phor, but the most frequently used metaphor is the journey
metaphor (T 147), rather than the building metaphor (T 136).
Results
Table 1 shows the three conceptual categories and the total
number of participants who used each conceptual metaphor,
which are represented by the alphanumeric code T 147, T
136, and T 40, respectively. It also can be seen from Table 1
that there were some differences in interpretations of images
and emphasis of EFL teachers in the categories of journey,
building, and conduit metaphors, although not so marked.
Three Main Categorizations of Metaphors
Table 1 lists 26 distinct metaphors, which were later classi-
fied as species of the three conceptual metaphors. It is impor-
tant to stress that the author was not only seeking to identify
every metaphor used in the text but also to present those EFL
teachers believed to be the most frequently used or most cen-
tral in shaping their thoughts or ideas when it comes to EFL
teaching and learning, based on the results of the checklist
questionnaire.
Educational journey metaphor. We start with this perspective
because, from all the responses to either the open-ended
questionnaire or the checklist questionnaire we received, this
was the most prevalent and frequently used image of EFL
teaching (T 147) with nine metaphors. Lakoff (1999) has
identified two common ways we structure the events: the
Location Event-Structure and the Object Event-Structure
metaphors, both of which make use of the primary meta-
phors Causes Are Forces and Changes Are Movements. In
the Location Event-Structure metaphor, events are conceptu-
alized as a change of states viewed as movement from one
bounded region in space to another with a desired location
(destination) as goal or purpose. Therefore, we can move
from one state to another over a period time to reach a final
state. In the Object Event-Structure metaphor, events are
conceptualized as the acquisition or loss of attributes viewed
as possessable objects. For instance, Harry can get a head-
ache or lose his headache. Therefore, purposes are conceptu-
alized in this metaphor as desired objects--things you want
to get.
As specific types of events, EFL teaching and learning are
often conceptualized in terms of these same metaphors.
Given the Location Event-Structure metaphor, English lan-
guage teachers and learners start from their first language,
and move along the path toward the desired purpose as des-
tination. In this case, EFL teaching and learning can be
viewed as a journey with a number of intermediate purposes,
which is in accordance with what Lakoff (1999) has outlined
in Long-Term Activities Are Journeys metaphor, derived
from the Location Event-Structure metaphor, where EFL
learners are travelers and teachers serve as guide. The cur-
riculum can provide a plan or itinerary. This is referred to as
the educational journey metaphor. EFL teachers in this cate-
gory were described either as tour guide (T 26), or instructor

(T 24), or director (T 17), or learning partner (T 15) who can
walk learners from a beginning, help set study goals, and
find the right path to reach the goals. If students were hin-
dered by difficulties from moving forward, or if something
blurred their learning, teachers would be responsible for aid-
ing or providing more instructional support to allow them to
move along the learning path, just as a candle (T 11) or a
bridge (T 20) functions. Besides, in China, a compulsory
English exam has exerted heavy pressure on students since
they started university. It is, therefore, not surprising to expe-
rience what is called anxiety or low motivation in the process
of English learning. Thus, EFL teachers are expected to show
compassion and listen empathically to them to help reduce
such anxiety in a way a nurturer (T 15) or a lover (T 10)
behaves. Because a journey may have a guide who points out
things of interest along the way, learners also expect their
teachers to be just like an entertainer (T 9) so as to stimulate
their interest in English language learning.
Educational building metaphor.This metaphor is very com-
mon and popular in the education and psychological litera-
ture. In the building metaphor, five aspects are emphasized:
content, progress, basicness, strength, and structure, referred
to by Lakoff and Johnson (1980) as the Argument Is a Build-
ing metaphor. In this metaphor, the outer shell and founda-
tion of the building constitute the content. Basicness lies in
the building's foundation, the deeper, the more basic.
Strength shows how strong or weak the internal connection
is and consists of both the building's capacity to maintain an
upright and balanced posture and capacity to withstand
external force and harm. Structure refers to shape, form, and
outline of the building. In the belief that education is primar-
ily concerned with constructing the mind and character of
every child and therefore can ensure the well-being of soci-
ety, students are taken as objects, school as a factory, and the
teacher as machine (T 8), manufacturer (T 11), controller
(T 4), and engineer (T 10), shaping the student into the pre-
scribed mold by strictly following a set of standardized sci-
entific practices. In addition, an increasing demand for a
compliant, faithful, skilled, and knowledgeable workforce
has framed students in a very passive role, where teachers are
portrayed as competitor (T 3), doctor (T 12), judge (T 9),
coach (T 20), strict parent (T 7), and activity designer (T 19),
who have had absolute dominance and implemented rules. In
the above situation, teachers were encouraged to have strict
control over students, and treat students as a standardized
social product rather than a creative individual. The goal of
learning was to shape students into mechanical and passive
individuals, who waited to be led by others into a prescribed
set of skills, knowledge, or values.
Teacher as scaffolder (T 11) suggests a very different edu-
cational building metaphor. The scaffolding, as a temporarily
erected structure used to support a building under construc-
tion, can be gradually removed bit by bit, when the building
itself emerges and grows stronger and more stable. It fits the
neo-Vygotskian metaphor (Karpov, 2005; Vygotsky, 1978),
where the teacher just provides basic structural guidance and
assistance, which is progressively withdrawn as students
move toward mastery of a particular skill or activity. The
scaffolding is constructed by a teacher and later gradually
removed, as the structure of the students'learning is gradually
built up. This metaphor is now widely used in education.
Educational conduit metaphor. As illustrated above, two of the
most fundamental metaphors of structuring events are the
Object Event-Structure metaphor and the Location Event-
Structure metaphor. Based on the Object Event-Structure
metaphor, English language teaching can be conceptualized
as transmission, which involves the transmitting or deliver-
ing of knowledge to learners, whereas learning can be acqui-
sition, which involves the acquisition or reception of
knowledge from teachers. This fits what Michael Reddy
(1993) has referred to as the teacher as conduit metaphor,
where the teacher (unidirectional information-giver) puts
ideas (objects) into words (containers) and transmits them
(through a conduit) to a student (information-receptor) who
takes the idea/objects out of the word/containers. In the met-
aphor of teacher as conduit (T 40), the English language is
taken as an object of study, and the language teacher must
exert strong control over both the content and the students,
which is actually an instance of Achieving a Purpose Is
Acquiring an Object, an entailment of the Object Event-
Structure metaphor. The metaphor Achieving a Purpose Is
Acquiring an Object pertains not just to communication, and
to arriving at satisfying interpretations of linguistic forms,
but to any attempt to achieve a purpose. This is in line with
what the conduit metaphor entails. In all of these metaphors,
EFL teachers were compared to conduit (T 10), envoy (T 10),
ambassador (T 11), and repeater (T 9), all considering
the teacher as an information or cultural transmitter who
treated language as an end or object rather than as a means of
communication.
Teachers' Responses to the Open-Ended
Questionnaire and Interviews
In the open-ended questionnaire, the 20 EFL teachers were
invited to answer the three questions concerning English
teachers, English teaching, and English learning in meta-
phors. The results showed some agreement with respect to
teacher as "instructor," "director," "tour guide," "flintstone,"
"cultural transmitter," "builder," "engineer," and "bridge."
When asked what was the key role EFL teachers can play, 20
agreed with the "instructor" and "director" metaphors and
indicated that they were their initial belief about the role of
EFL teachers, while 15 insisted on the view that EFL teach-
ers should be an assistant or tour guide during the English-
teaching-learning process, help the students through the
process, and lead them to a destination. As to the question
regarding the way to conceptualize EFL teachers, 8 assumed

that EFL teachers should be a nurturer and therefore be
responsible for taking care of students and facilitating their
personal development as a parent, while 9 of them mentioned
the necessity of teachers' responsibility for establishing a
bridge and transmitting the English culture to the students.
To investigate how they conceptualized the role of EFL
teachers by means of metaphors, 10 EFL teachers were asked
to participate in the interview and verbalize every thought
that came to mind when the metaphor was generated or
selected with a list of five predetermined questions (see
Appendix C). All the feedback was recorded and analyzed,
the results of which are shown in Table 2.
As Table 2 shows, Chinese cultural model, personal learn-
ing and teaching experience, and their frame of knowledge
were the factors that could determine their choice of meta-
phors. Besides, their interpretation of the category of EFL
teachers was found consistent with the metaphors they gen-
erated. To show how they structured the role of EFL in meta-
phors, the details of interviews with three EFL teachers'
choice of metaphors are outlined below.
Rong Ou. Rong Ou has been an EFL teacher for almost 20
years. Her perceptions of EFL teachers were shaped by the
following metaphors she used: teacher as instructor, director,
and builder.As for the reasons for such choice, she explained
that Chinese traditional culture and personal experience
could account for it. Rong Ou remarked,
I see myself not only as an instructor and director but also mind
builder that was traditionally primary function of teachers. I
would instruct and direct my students in the process of English
learning. I would be shaping the minds of these "budding"
adults. As an instructor, I want to interest my students in English
studies, and thus it is very important for me to stimulate their
learning motivation. In this case, English teachers should try to
show their class in an interesting, and humorous way just like an
entertainer does and makes this learning journey more relaxing
and pleasant.
Yingmei Qu.Yingmei Qu, coauthor of this article, has been
an EFL teacher for 15 years. In the interview, she expressed
the metaphors of English teacher as instructor, English
teacher as tour guide, English teacher as scaffolder, and Eng-
lish teacher as flintstone. She clarified the teacher as the flint-
stone of the building metaphor in that one of the primary
functions for English teachers is to usher students into Eng-
lish learning, provide very basic assistance, and then with-
draw after they have established their own structure, which
seems to be consistent with what English teacher as scaf-
folder has suggested, a different educational construction
metaphor. When asked to explain how she could conceptual-
ize EFL teachers as such, Yingmei Ou remarked:
My perceptions of EFL teachers are manifest on several levels.
First, for me, EFL teachers should be responsible for conveying
knowledge in various ways and finding the right track for
students to reach their targets, just as an instructor or a tour
guide behaves, which is [in] line with long-standing Chinese
traditions. Second, English teachers should provide basic
structural guidance and then ignite their passions for English
learning. Similarly, English teachers should withdraw such help
later when students have built up their own structure. To this
end, I usually link myself to a scaffolder or a flintstone and all
the metaphors I have used to structure EFL teachers are out of
my personal teaching experience and educational theories.
Hong Fei. Hong Fei has been an EFL teacher for almost 25
years. She said that the metaphors she used for defining EFL
teachers followed a long-standing tradition of holding teachers
Xiong et al. 7
in respect and a traditional view of good teacher. A good
teacher in a traditional view has always been expected to
work hard at providing professional guidance and, thus,
stimulating students' potential, which is, to a larger extent,
dependent on the class the teachers organized. Thus, teacher
as organizer and teacher as judge were the two primary met-
aphors she has generated for the category of EFL teachers.
She also said that she did not agree with the teacher as
instructor metaphor, and she explained this as follows:
Educational theories I have learnt have influenced me a lot. I see
myself as an organizer or judge, rather than an instructor to my
students. I don't want to instruct my students. For a smaller class,
I am more willing to be an organizer and make more room for my
students. For a larger class, I choose to be a judge, who can not
only decide what materials are suitable to students but also decide
what strategies students could use to finish the task. Teacher as
judge is a reflection of Construction Metaphor, where teachers,
sometimes, have to take total control over teaching materials,
methods and molding students, which is quite similar to a judge
who rolled a judge, jury and executioner into one in court.
As illustrated above, cultural, societal, and cognitive fac-
tors could account for the participants' selection of the three
conceptual metaphors to define EFL teachers. Although
there was a discrepancy in their choices, a cluster of four ele-
ments such as instructor, initiator, knowledge transmitter,
and builder were found to be important for conceptualizing
their roles as such.
Cognitive Models
According to Lakoff (1987), any element of a cognitive
model can correspond to a conceptual category, which is
characterized with its prototype effect. Prototypes are usu-
ally considered as the most representative members of a cat-
egory. In many cases, prototypes act as cognitive reference
points of various sorts and form the basis for inferences
(Rosch, 1975, 1981). Prototype effect may result from many
factors, such as degree of category membership, internal cat-
egory structure, nature of cognitive models, and so on.
From the responses to both the open-ended questionnaire
and the checklist questionnaire, we found that three
metaphors--Educational Journey Metaphor, Educational
Building Metaphor, and Educational Conduit Metaphor--
were involved in defining the category of EFL teachers. As
seen in Table 1, the Educational Journey Metaphor was the
most prevalent and frequently chosen item (T 147), the
Educational Building Metaphor the next most frequently
chosen item (T 136), and the Educational Conduit Metaphor
was the least frequently chosen item (T 40). It seemed that
participants used the three conceptual metaphors, but with a
relatively distinct weight, to partially structure the concept of
English teacher.
As shown in Table 2, a cluster of four elements were
found to be important for defining the category of an English
teacher by metaphors. Instructor (T 10), initiator (T 6),
knowledge transmitter (T 7), and builder (T 3) are the most
important elements of the prototype of an English teacher.
The author found that participants, when asked for focal ele-
ments of the category of EFLteachers, varied in their choices,
some of which seemed to conflict with others. Three partici-
pants told the author that sometimes they had a quite differ-
ent conceptual category of EFL teachers according to the size
and type of lessons. For a larger class, they preferred to be a
builder and controller, whereas for a smaller one, they chose
to be an initiator who just led students in and then provided
some instruction. When it comes to what factors could
account for their selection among the 26 metaphors, it was
found there were many factors such as their basic under-
standing or knowledge as teachers (T 10), which is referred
to as a folk model by cognitive anthropologists, influence
from the learning of educational theory (T 6), years of teach-
ing experience (T 10), cultural models (T 4), personal experi-
ences (T 10), and so on. Besides, there was apparent
consistency between their use and choice of metaphors and
pedagogical behaviors. In total, 10 participants claimed that
the metaphors they have selected or generated were more or
less in alignment with what they have practiced in their lan-
guage classroom, consciously or unconsciously. The way
they have selected the metaphors also suggested some differ-
ences in their first consideration in implementing their teach-
ing practice. A total of 6 out of 10 accepted students as the
most important, 4 accepted teaching scheme, and none
accepted teachers as their first consideration before they
have implemented their teaching practice.
Discussion
The results from the two questionnaires and verbal reports,
which indicated the various conceptual metaphors EFL
teachers have generated or chosen, converge on a certain
prototypical cognitive model of an English teacher. Such a
prototypical cognitive model is not restricted to a single
model. In fact, it involves a number of cognitive models that
combine to form a complex cluster. The cluster is psycho-
logically more basic than the models taken individually
(Lakoff, 1987).
At the follow-up interviews, participants' responses to
five predetermined questions suggested that EFL teachers
took instructor, initiator, cultural transmitter, and builder as
the focal elements of the category of EFL teachers, and this
was the reflection of the prototypical cognitive models, which
was in line with what they have selected from the 26 meta-
phors. It can be inferred from their metaphors and follow-up
interviews that no single model could cover the full range of
EFLteachers. EFLteacher is based on a cluster of models, which
can be represented as instructor model, transmitter model, and
builder model. In the first model, teachers are usually expected to
provideinstruction,aroledesignatedbyafolkmodel,whereteach-
ers are described as being knowledgeable and, thus, responsible
8 SAGE Open
for guiding and educating students. In a transmitter model,
teachers are often perceived as the knowledgeable individual
or master, derived from people's common knowledge without
any technical expertise, and their function is to convey knowl-
edge, such as culture, science, and so on. The builder model is
consistent with the long-standing Chinese traditional culture
that teachers are soul engineers, and they should build and
mold their students' minds. For the 10 participants who have
taught EFL in China for at least 7 years, it became obvious
that they usually used a cluster of converging cognitive mod-
els with the instructor model as a central model to construct
definitions for EFL teachers.
For the reasons why the teachers would conceptualize their
roles as such, the cultural and social models of Chinese tradi-
tional education should form a part, which is subsequently
linked to their personal experiences, self-understanding, and
professional role that motivated them to believe in, identify
with, and make decisions around the nature of language
teaching, language learning, and the language learners in and
out of their class. To most of the EFL teachers who were
brought up in a Chinese traditional culture, two key aspects of
cultural models of language education and teaching are their
instructional force as well as their emphasis on social order.
In such a model, teachers are usually endowed with a duty to
instruct and construct students' minds and behavior and,
therefore, maintain social harmony and stability, where teach-
ers should be a knowledgeable person, social leader, and
powerful educator. Such culture has served to reinforce their
views on the importance of intellectual and social responsibil-
ity teachers should take in language teaching. Thus, it is
imperative that language teachers not only guide and instruct
students' learning, but also shape and build their minds to
ensure a harmonious society. However, in the development
and advancement of educational theory, where attention has
been shifted from being teacher-oriented to students-oriented,
new attributes have been added for language teachers and the
need to inspire students' full potential has become more
prominent and stronger, which may experience some change
from the social builder who has committed himself or herself
to molding the next generation to a cultural bridge rather than
just an instructor.
Conclusion
Situated in a Chinese context of EFL teaching, the present
study demonstrates that teachers'cognitive models are, more
or less, in line with the metaphors they used or generated,
which corresponds with Cameron and Low's (1999) and
Cameron and Malsen's (2010) claim that metaphor has been
used as a research tool to investigate language teacher's cog-
nition (Cameron & Low, 1999). Following Wan's (2007)
framework on metaphor elicitation, the study achieved the
following conclusions.
First, all the metaphors EFL teachers have generated or
selected to describe their knowledge, beliefs, and goals on
EFL teaching were later categorized into three metaphors:
Educational Journey Metaphor, Educational Construction
Metaphor, and Educational Conduit Metaphor. As for the
factors that determine their selection from 26 metaphors,
basic knowledge (folk model), influence from the learning of
educational theory, years of teaching experience, cultural
models, and personal experiences influenced their choices,
among which personal teaching and learning experience
were considered the most important.
Second, as far as cognitive models are concerned, the
study showed most of us did not have a single coherent
understanding of EFL teachers. Instead, we had three con-
verging cognitive models--instructor model, transmitter
model, and builder model--each with distinct focal entail-
ments, to structure the category of EFL teachers. The find-
ings showed high consistency between cognitive models and
metaphors teachers have generated or selected.
Third, on the basis of the above analysis, we assume that
metaphors can actually serve as a useful, effective, and ana-
lytic tool for making us more aware of the cognitive model
underlying our conceptual framework for EFL teaching.
Besides, it can allow us to identify some of the important
assumptions we have made in EFL teaching and, therefore,
choose to take responsibility for our pedagogical behaviors.
By understanding how we structure the category of EFL
teachers in terms of metaphors and their associated cognitive
models, we can more effectively, critically reflect and evalu-
ate our teaching practice with the purpose of promoting EFL
learning.
Last, this research has just been a quantitative study and
limited in three aspects. First, metaphor and cognitive mod-
els involve a variety of disciplines, such as psychology, biol-
ogy, cognitive science, sociology, and so on; consequently,
they are difficult to categorize. Second, as our study focuses
on the participants from only one university, a larger scope of
EFL teachers at the same level cannot be investigated; there-
fore, the findings of the present study are not generalizable.
