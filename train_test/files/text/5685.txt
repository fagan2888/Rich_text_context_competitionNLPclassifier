Commentary
Blind regards: Troubling data
and their sentinels
Tahani Nadim
Abstract
A new generation of environmental satellites, the Sentinels, has recently been launched by the European Space Agency
(ESA). Part of ESA's Copernicus Programme, the sentinel mission has adopted an Open Data policy which intends to
make different levels of data freely available via an online data hub. Sentinel data will support applications including land
monitoring, emergency management and security and will thus form the evidence-base for a wide-range of local, regional,
national and international decisions, from individual insurance claims to humanitarian interventions. By providing ever
more data streams for monitoring and managing the planet, the sentinels institute a novel mode of visibility in terms of
resolution, coverage and frequency. At the same time, they are co-constitutive of the increasing datafication of the
environment. In the entwinement of heavenly gaze and data visions, I want to recover the work of `data fictions' in order
to demystify notions of visibility and calculability associated with ``earth observation'' and trouble its unquestioned
pursuit of total monitoring.

Dear database
How to address Big Data infrastructure? How to figure
agency, recover subjectivities and disclose a space of con-
testation in environmental data streams? In 2008a
number of disgruntled mycologists demonstrated how
an open letter to GenBank, the world's largest DNA/
RNA database, might be a good start (Bidartondo,
2008). The issue that prompted it was (and remains)
that many of the database records for fungal sequences
were erroneously annotated, that is, the contextual infor-
mation which ensures the intelligibility of sequence data
was inadequate.1 The signatories suggested the introduc-
tion of open, collective annotation and while this
demand has not been met, the letter proved surprisingly
efficient in other ways: It garnered an irate response from
GenBank's host institution, the National Center for
Biotechnology Information, elicited an editorial in
Science as well as comments from a number of promin-
ent scientists and caused widespread debate about open-
ing Big Data resources for community editing.
The letter thus occasioned somewhat of an `infra-
structural inversion' (Bowker and Star, 1999), a
moment in which infrastructural matters are compelled
to come to the fore. In relation to climate data Edwards
(2010) has shown how such inversions can take the
form of what he calls `data frictions', the resistance
which arises from the habitual unpacking and re-packa-
ging of data as they travel across communities and plat-
forms (see also Leonelli, 2009). I would contend that
inversions and frictions also reveal something about the
data fictions that allow this trajectory to cohere within
infrastructures, and importantly, across interfaces,
domains and communities of practice. During a
recent workshop of the European Group on Earth
Observations (GEO), a central struggle appeared to
be the articulation of a consensual imagination capable
not only of reconciling different types of data but of
turning a corollary of issues (poverty, sustainability,
public health, food security, etc.) thinkable and
doable primarily through environmental Big Data.2

And so it is with regard to data fictions that I find
the open letter to GenBank such an instructive episode.
The letter, a narrative device, variously discloses and
occasions protagonists, histories, materials, interests
and so prepares the ground for novel or other problem-
atisations (in this case conflicting understandings of
`openness').3 In other words, it helps `unearth the
dramas inherent' in data infrastructure (Bowker and
Star, 1999: 377). Data fictions articulate and organise
and at times trouble the imaginaries that instruct the
production, processing and distribution of data.
Methodologically, this compels discussions about
`making data global' (Edwards, 2010) to encompass
questions related to the workings and purchase of
genre, convention, sensitivity, aesthetic and rhetoric
and invites a `diffractive' (Haraway, 1992) engagement
that reads data through its fictions. Because the ease
with which satellites have become sensible guardians
of the environment tends to obscure questions about
the complexities, the labours and the differential visions
effected by environmental Big Data.
Environmental data fictions
In 2014, the European Space Agency (ESA) launched `a
new family of missions' entitled Sentinels in order to
support the work of Copernicus, Europe's earth obser-
vation programme (formerly known as the Global
Monitoring for Environment and Security). The senti-
nels will total 20 satellites, which will fly in constellation
(as `twins') allowing more frequent revisits and the
creation of near real-time data (Showstack, 2014).
Two sentinel satellites have already been launched
from Europe's spaceport in Kourou, French Guiana
(on 3 April 2014 and 23 June 2015, respectively):
Sentinel-1A, a high-resolution radar imaging mission
with a 5 -m ground range resolution, and Sentinel-2A,
a high-resolution optical mission with a spatial reso-
lution from 10 to 60m. Sentinel-1s will provide observa-
tions for applications covering ocean, seas and polar
areas including oil spill monitoring, sea-ice monitoring,
ship traffic and routing, as well as for land applications
including emergency responses and security. Sentinel-2s
focuses on land observations such as land cover and
usage while also monitoring inland water and coastal
zones, similarly providing data for emergency and secur-
ity services. In short, the sentinels' objective is `to manage
the environment effectively and help respond to the chal-
lenges of global change' (ESA, 2015: 2).
The ceaseless gaze of the new sentinels purports to
put eyes on the environment as it encompasses all land
and coastal areas between latitudes 84 north and 56
south, from beyond the tip of Greenland to just beyond
the southernmost point of Chile. It covers all islands
greater than 100 km2, all islands in the European
Union, all within 20 km of a coastline, the entire
Mediterranean Sea and all inland water bodies and
closed seas. Specifically, the sentinel flies over and
scans an area acquiring a continuous image that is
referred to as a `datatake'. The maximum length of a
datatake is 15,000 km (from Lisbon, Portugal to
Vanimo, Papua New Guinea). Because it is not possible
for a single earth observation station to cover this, so-
called datastrips, portions covering 5,000 km of the
image, are downlinked to ground stations. These data-
strips form the basis for the Copernicus programme's
environmental data. Data are provided on three levels
from 0 to 2 where 0 means unprocessed instrument and
payload data (at full resolution) and 2 indicating
refined measures such as surface wind speed. Data for
Sentinel-1A and Sentinel-2A are already available
through the Sentinel Data Hub portal at scihub.coper-
nicus.eu. The data hub gives access to what one com-
mentator has termed, perhaps not so coincidentally, a
`data explosion' as well as an `enormous dump of free
data' (Amos, 2014). It thus continues the decisive devel-
opment of open remote-sensing (RS) data that began in
2008 when the US Geological Survey's Landsat pro-
gram (ongoing since 1972) made their data available
for free download.4
Evidently then, the basis for effective environmental
management is an enormous continuous stream of near
real-time RS data. Sentinel-1s and Sentinel-2s alone
will provide about 3.4 terabytes of data per day,
which will be instantaneously downlinked to ground
stations before being released between 2 and 12 h
from sensing. Most of the data will be made available
on an open and free basis online (with some security
exceptions). In terms of coverage, data volume and
data dissemination, the sentinels represent a `new era
in earth observation' (Showstack, 2014). And all this is,
`literally, (. . .) for the benefit of mankind', according to
Josef Aschbacher, who is responsible for coordinating
ESA's earth observation programme (quoted
Showstack, 2014).5 Advocates for the sentinels and
earth observation are adamant that the environment
can and should be made intelligible principally through
Big Data produced by extremely expensive artefacts
that orbit the earth at a distance of approximately
786 km (Sentinel-2s, 693 km for Sentinel-1s).6
If satellites (and the environmental data they gener-
ate) are the answer to environmental crises, then we
might do well to consider how this entrenches the ques-
tion of how best to address environmental change. To
put it differently, what is the shape and form of crisis if
the primary response impels the environment to
become `utterly absorbed into data and data space, a
digital ghost in the machine' (Waldby, 2000: 7)? One
possible figuration is that of war, which also provides
an answer to the question of how satellites got there in
2 Big Data & Society
the first place. Whether in the description of the
Landsat programme as `civilian', the stress on strategic
measures and `combating' environmental challenges, or
the drive for ever more penetrating and panoptic vision,
environmental Big Data can appear close to the rhet-
oric of warfare. Yet in contrast to much environmental
ruination war is infinitely more sensible in that it has
present effects and follows recognisable conventions
(e.g. soldiers, military hardware, bombings). That one
can at least grasp the condition of war and thus com-
prehend it through an established set of fears, expect-
ations and knowledges emerges as a central argument
in the accounts of the people of Chernobyl recorded by
Svetlana Alexievich (2016 [1997]). What, however,
escapes the senses, comprehension and imagination is
(radioactive) pollution and the long-term or far-away
effects of environmental degradations.
Artful accounting
Sentinels account for the environment by observing,
measuring and modelling earth surface characteristics.
In relation to terrestrial sensing, these characteristics
are indicative of different types of land cover formed
by biophysical and biochemical patterns resulting from
the interaction of biotic and abiotic factors including
humans, climate, geology, soils, animals, fungi and
plants. Parameters measured are, for example, leaf
area index, chlorophyll and nitrogen as well as spectral
products like `red edge' position and the normalised
difference vegetation index (NDVI), an index of photo-
synthetic activity. None of this is captured directly.
Instead theories and models from one phenomenon
such as reflectance or radiance are extended into the-
ories and models of another phenomenon such as
chlorophyll production (Lein, 2012: 45). What counts
as real or virtual (manufactured based on model simu-
lations) observation though remains a critical uncer-
tainty in the pursuit of Big Data environmental
science (e.g. Beven et al., 2012).
`Is it a piece of art or a satellite image?' the Copernicus
website asks of an image (Figure 1) produced by
Sentinel-2A. An article in The New Scientist discussing
the same image asserts that `Gustav Klimt would like it'
(Firth, 2016). Looking at Figure 1 one is certainly per-
suaded to appreciate it aesthetically: a pretty mosaic of
red, grey and black tiles. The caption, however, makes
clear that this is not Jugendstil art but agricultural fields
in Italy's Fucino valley imaged in false colour (here
showing the `red edge' where plants and chlorophyll
show in different red tones). The picture, then, is both
art and satellite image and while such equivocacy high-
lights the instrumental combination of imaging and
knowing (e.g. Daston and Galison, 2007), it also trou-
bles the logic according to which visibility, legibility and
calculability connect and proceed. It is not a matter of
course that sensors apprehend digital numbers and pixel
values beget data, which in turn become images that are
commensurable with environments. Sentinel data
requires continuous and habitual inverting: A recorded
observation has to `be translated into numerical terms
before it can be realised as data' (Lein, 2012: 45).
For Waldby, the digital ghost (in her case, the human
body) problematises any neat distinctions between the

Space Agency (ESA).

virtual and the real for it demonstrates how issues such
as sex and `race' become re-materialized via data.
Similarly, the picture of the Fucino Valley is not quite
real, nor entirely virtual. It is hard to tell what might
have gone astray on the convoluted and laborious path
of data processing: from dark signal and crosstalk
correction, defective pixel restoration, de-convolution
and de-noising, re-sampling and imagery compression
to further resampling, orthorectification, masks compu-
tation and additional imagery compression. The picture
is more of a vision than a clear-cut observation. Yet
consequential data fictions are being woven that can,
in the case of the Fucino valley, sensibly contain and
relate RS observations, biomass proxies, crop yield
and acreage, per capita food demand, gross domestic
product or population statistics. Thus transformed
into so-called `agricultural intelligence' (e.g. Atzberger,
2013), remote-sensed crop monitoring can (and indeed,
has) become a staple in narrating the politics (and infra-
structures) of food security. But there is a lot which
escapes sentinels: migrant workers and labour relations,
types of fertiliser and pesticides used (and their long-
term environmental and public health effects), agricul-
tural subsidies, futures traded on crop forecasts, or
mycorrhizal entanglements. These omissions are not
only due to technical limitations but also connected to
limited imaginations about Big Data and environmental
crises. How do we read an image like the one shown
above? What, with reference to Waldby, are the consti-
tutive dynamics between the real and the virtual
and how can we grasp the similarities and differences
that matter?

Come in the sow
Guillaume Apollinaire, ``Cotton in your Ears'', 1918
Apollinaire's poem ``Cotton in your ears'' takes us
into the trenches of World War I where the sentinel
cuts an odd figure. The poem, part of his
Calligrammes: Poems of Peace and War 1913­1916
(1980) collection, begins with an explosion accompa-
nied by words set unto the page like artillery fire. On
the poem's second page, things have calmed as the
letters settle into their grid until the shout of ``Come
in the sow'' (perhaps a call sign bellowed into a field
telephone), all caps. It is then that the sentinel makes
his first appearance. Senses stifled by the crashing and
the screaming, still his gaze remains fixed on the
adversary, enduringly unfazed. He is only interrupted
by the strange sign informing us of this particular dug-
out's name (`the tranquil cenobites') before returning
once more with his gaze long and lingering. The repe-
tition of sentinel might not refer to the same but to
more of the same indicating the steady replacement of
parts obliterated by war. The sentinel here is both
witness and guard in the midst of a type of warfare
that remote sensing technology, with its `surgical'
gaze, is supposed to have rendered obsolete. Yet the
spectre of some sort of war is not far when sentinels
watch the earth for the benefit of `mankind' amongst
other satellite families that supply data for the navi-
gation and guidance of missiles.
For one, the cycle of destruction and substitution
(or, restoration) chimes with the logic of environmental
economics and its particular notion of ecosystem as a
quasi-mechanistic functional unit defined primarily by
its service provisions to (some) humans. Accordingly,
ruination of one environment can be offset by conser-
ving another. Earth observation satellites are important
tools for such environmental book-keeping as well as
for tracking compliance with regulatory frameworks
such as EU agricultural policy or for arbitrating land
disputes (Bartel, 2005). Next-generation environmental
science predicated on Big Data and the promises of the
`fourth paradigm' (Hey, 2009), the discovery and col-
laboration in and from Big Data, expand this vision to
include total surveillance of the planet. There is some-
thing disconcerting about the level of urgency by which
a total monitoring of earth is made reasonable and
necessary. The not-so subtle conflation of military
rationalism7 with earth observation efforts becomes
mirrored in the militarisation of environmental protec-
tion that is using military technologies and shoot-on-
sight policies (Kelly and Ybarra, 2016; Peluso and
Watts, 2001). Sentinels seamlessly merge environmental
concerns with securitization, capturing invasive popu-
lations, human and vegetal alike. If environmental sci-
ence is configuring its infrastructures according to war
scenarios, it begs the question of how exactly earth
observation constitutes its battleground. If earth obser-
vation requires sentinels, that is, guarding soldiers
then what are the battle lines and who, exactly, is the
enemy?
Dark data
For Serres global environmental perils such as climate
change signal a new kind of war, one in which nature
4 Big Data & Society
`brutally and without warning' imposes itself into `our
schemes and maneuvres [sic].' (Serres, 1995: 3) The stakes
of this war are greater than of any battle seen before: the
Earth itself, humanity in toto. Anthropogenic means
of mass destruction, from nuclear submarines to internal
combustion engines, have given rise to an entirely
new class of opponents: air, atmosphere, water and
soil. This transformation has gone, however, unnoticed
as `history remains blind to nature.' (Serres, 1995: 7)
History, however, was not entirely ignorant if we con-
sider the armament of the atmosphere by toxic gas on the
Ypres front in 1915. For Sloterdijk this event marked `the
introduction of the environment into the battle between
adversaries' and the `transition from classical warfare to
terrorism' (2009: 13). The environment either as non-tra-
ditional security threat (think of `food security' or `water
security') or potential weapon warrants unyielding
observation.
The violence (`data explosion') and waste evoked in
the description of sentinel data is not trivial. They
matter as part of imaginaries conjured up in comments
and technical descriptions, built into specifications and
data sheets, and reproduced in the shared conceptual-
isations of models, standards and ontologies that govern
the earth observation project. Apollinaire's poem
alludes to both the possibilities and the limits of repre-
sentation when it comes to sensibly relaying what both,
the military and remote sensing community call ground
truth, actual conditions on the ground. But where the
data-take seeks calculated visibility, the poem deliber-
ately courts opacity. The materiality of the words, their
typesetting, speech patterns and semiotic modes refuse
clear divisions between sensations and observations. In
contrast, the sentinels are meant to monitor without
passion or prejudice the objective destructions wrought
upon Earth. Their very deployment, part of an effort
that Serres likens to `general mobilisation', betrays the
coupling of immanent threat and indiscriminate appre-
hensions that characterises a continuum of war and
environment, to paraphrase Massumi (2009).
Troubling sentinels
A letter, as Simmel (1908) observed, enters a space of
many uncertainties once it leaves its writer. As it travels,
interception and manipulation are possible. Similarly
volatile is its reception by its addressee: Will they read
its content the way the sender had meant it? Much the
same anxieties accompany environmental Big Data as
they are sensed, collected, assembled, relayed and dis-
seminated. The sentinels and their data are used to
account for the environment and in doing so, they appre-
hend the environment narratively. In other words, they
make certain stories possible. In this, the genre of crisis
is popular as it suspends hesitations and allows a
frictionless alignment of environmental and security
concerns. It is important to trouble the self-evidence
by which perpetual capture is a sensible response to
unrivalled destructions of forms of life, many of which
remain of course unseen by sentinels and their relatives.
In her reflections on Sputnik, the world's first satel-
lite launched on 4 October 1957, Hannah Arendt (1998
[1958]) diagnoses a troubling flight from earthly `speech
and sound'. She writes that `it could be that we, who are
earth-bound creatures and have begun to act as though
we were dwellers of the universe, will forever be unable
to understand, that is, to think and speak about the
things which nevertheless we are able to do' (Arendt,
1998: 3). The sentinels will stay with us for a while.
Data from the sentinels will find their way into deci-
sions and policies that will have wide-ranging effects on
lives, human and otherwise. That is why the expanding
worlds of environmental satellites, their continuous
streams of data and their laborious rendering into
data products, what Gabrys (2016) calls `creaturing',
require inventive problematisations. Critical engage-
ment must thus work on assembling a language `to
think and speak' about sentinels. This is not a question
of how to escape their gaze but of crafting copious
imaginaries that put them in their place and time.
