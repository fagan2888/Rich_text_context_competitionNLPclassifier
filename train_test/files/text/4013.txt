Introduction
The current study considers the use of humor in the class-
room as related to two specific constructs: perceived learning
and actual learning. Research on the relationship between the
use of humor and different forms of learning spans several
decades (Kaplan & Pascoe, 1977; Matarazzo, Durik, &
Delaney, 2010). Although the body of research is significant,
there are several issues. First, some research was studied in a
restricted manner. For example, in the area of actual learning
(specific leaning outcomes), most studies were limited to
short interventions, while only a few lasted an entire semes-
ter. The last researcher to conduct an extensive study lasting
an entire semester was Ziv (1988). A second area of concern
centers on the number of humor resources on websites and
within books not based on empirical evidence. These
resources are often based on anecdotal evidence provided by
instructors resulting from individual humor experiences
within the classroom and presented as instructional tech-
nique (Lundberg & Thurston, 2002; Strean, 2011). A third
issue concerns the different variables (e.g., gender) that play
a role in the relationship between humor and learning. For
example, in these studies, the gender of the instructor using
humor within the classroom was a factor in how humor was
perceived by the average student and the impact of humor
use (Bryant, Comisky, Crane, & Zillmann, 1980; Van Giffen,
1990). Few studies have looked at the gender of students in
this regard.
Types of Humor Used in Educational
Settings
To gain a more comprehensive understanding of the relation-
ship humor might have with different types of learning, it is
important to understand the kinds of humor used in educa-
tional systems. A comprehensive study by Wanzer, Frymier,
Wojtaszczyk, and Smith (2006) found several appropriate
and inappropriate uses of humor by teachers in the class-
room. For that study, participants were undergraduate stu-
dents who were given open-ended questions and asked to
describe an example of teachers' use of both appropriate and
inappropriate humor within the classroom. Several catego-
ries of appropriate humor emerged. The categories included
the following: (a) related humor strategies or behaviors
linked to course material, (b) unrelated humor strategies or
behaviors not associated with course material, (c) self-dis-
paraging humor directed at oneself, and (d) unintentional
humor that was considered spontaneous or unplanned. The
inappropriate uses of humor that emerged were (a) disparag-
ing humor-targeting students (e.g., making fun of them in the
class), (b) disparaging humor-targeting others (e.g., making

Understanding the Relationship Between
Different Types of Instructional Humor
and Student Learning
Moshe Machlev1 and Nancy J. Karlin1
Abstract
The purpose of this study was to examine the frequency of use of different types of humor in the classroom for a possible
relationship with perceived and actual learning. This relationship was examined using quantitative methods. Participants
answered questions about their perceived and actual learning and the type of humor to which they were exposed (examining
the frequency of such exposure). Student's final grade in the course served as the measure of actual learning. The study
consisted of 195 undergraduate students ranging in age from 18 to 25. A factor analysis identified two distinct types of
humor (relevant/appropriate and non-relevant) used in the classroom with relevant/appropriate humor predicting perceived
learning. No relationship was found between the different types of humor and actual learning. There was also no difference
in the interaction between different types of humor with gender.

fun of a celebrity), (c) offensive humor (e.g., sexual jokes),
and (d) self-disparaging humor used in a way to laugh about
oneself (Wanzer et al., 2006). Based on Wanzer's et al.
(2006) findings, the current research examined the relation-
ship between the types of humor recognized by students
(appropriate-relevant/in appropriate) and different educa-
tional outcomes (perceived and actual learning/course grade)
with gender as a covariate.
Humor and Learning
Short-term interventions.Humor has been recognized as an
influence on learning. Most of the initial research about humor
with a possible relationship to learning was done using short-
term interventions that mostly examined retention and recall.
One group of researchers (Hauck & Thomas, 1972) looked at
incidental and intentional associative learning. Intentional
learning was defined as learning that was sought, while inci-
dental learning occurred by was not sought. These researchers,
using elementary schoolchildren, discovered humor influences
retention when learning was incidental. Kaplan and Pascoe
(1977) proceeded by using three types of humor in a lecture:
humorous examples related to the concepts in the lecture (con-
cept humor), unrelated to the concepts (non-concept humor), or
a combination of concept and non-concept examples (mixed
humor). Their study examined retention and comprehension of
material immediately after the lecture and 6 weeks later. These
researchers found immediate comprehension was not influ-
enced by the use of humor. However, retention of concept
humor related material significantly improved after 6 weeks.
To further investigate the influence of humor on a specific type
of learning, Clabby (1979) had participants select nouns and
non-nouns. When participants selected nouns, their choice was
followed with cartoons that were humorous. When participants
selected non-nouns, non-humorous cartoons followed. It was
found that humor did influence learning, especially for partici-
pants low in creativity.
Snetsinger and Grabowski (1994) also examined the
effect of humorous and non-humorous learning. These
authors considered two types of learning in the context of a
computer-based instructional (CBI) lesson on tick identifica-
tion (i.e., ticks that cause Lyme disease). They found that
there were no differences between the two groups (humor
and non-humor) when it came to learning, retention, or
enjoyment. The authors report a difference between the
humor groups when it came to being worried about ticks
with the humorous group being more worried about ticks
than the group learning in a non-humorous manner.
During the same period, Schmidt (1994) looked at mem-
ory for humorous and non-humorous versions of sentences.
He found sentences containing humor were remembered bet-
ter than non-humorous sentences. This was true with both
free- and cued-recall, and also with measures of word and
sentence recall. Garner (2006) examined the impact of cur-
riculum-specific humor on retention and recall. He found a
positiveimpactoncontentretention.Hackathorn,Garczynski,
Blankmeyer, Tennial, and Solomon (2012) discovered the
use of humor significantly increased students'overall perfor-
mance on exams, predominantly on knowledge and compre-
hension quiz items, but not on application items. The prior
body of research has proven significant but since there was
an emphasis on short-term interventions, a need to examine
these issues over a semester period was needed.
Semester-long interventions. The first comprehensive study
that was not a short-term intervention about the influence
of humor on learning, and examined overall actual learning
(student's final grade in a course) was done by Ziv (1988).
In this study, instructors completed a seminar about the use
of humor in the classroom, and at the end of the seminar,
instructors judged to have the "best" type of humor were
chosen to teach a statistics class. The instructors taught one
class throughout a semester using three pre-determined jokes
in each and every class period. Instructors taught another
section in the exact way but without the use of humor. At the
end of the semester, all students took a multiple-choice exam
on the material studied throughout the semester. Those stu-
dents who studied in the humorous section achieved higher
grades on the final test than students in the non-humorous
section. This author replicated the study (using an introduc-
tory psychology class) with similar robust findings (Ziv,
1988). However, much of the research following Ziv did not
conduct a semester-long study of the relationship between
humor and learning (Hackathorn et al., 2012).
Students' perception of instructors' use of humor.Several
researchers have taken a different approach and examined
how students perceive instructors' use of humor and its influ-
ence on learning. According to Kher, Molstad, and Donahue
(1999), humor can be a part of the classroom because humor
creates an atmosphere of respect between students and the
teacher. When the students feel safe, they revel in the learning
process. Conkell, Imwold, and Ratliffe (1999) examined the
effects of humor in learning fitness concepts and students'
perceptions of a teacher who used relevant humor while
teaching. They had students view either a humorous or non-
humorous lecture on body composition and weight control
via videotape. Later the researchers asked the students about
the content and delivery of the lecture. They discovered with
regard to content examination, there was little difference
between the humorous and non-humorous groups. Students
were more accepting of the instructor that incorporated humor
into the lecture. In addition, students in the humorous group
were more motivated to increase personal fitness levels.
Other studies have found a robust association between humor
and learning (Torok, McMorris, & Lin, 2004; Ulloth, 2002).
Few studies examined both constructs (throughout an
entire semester) in the same study with the same participants,
meaning, the relationship between actual learning and per-
ceived learning with humor that is used in the classroom. It is
Machlev and Karlin 3
of interest to examine in one study with the same students: if
there is a relationship between humor and the perceived learn-
ing of the students and the actual learning, if there is a relation-
ship between humor and only one of those constructs, or if
there is no relationship at all between humor and those two
constructs. A certain finding can indicate whether the use of
humor in the classroom is related to only one type of learning,
to both, or to none of those. In addition, the Ziv (1988) studies
only included one measure of evaluation (exams), the measur-
ers in this study included different course requirements such as
quizzes, papers, participation, attendance, extra credit assign-
ments, and research-related requirements.
Gender and humor. When it comes to the classroom, previous
research has shown that male teachers use humor signifi-
cantly more often than female teachers, with women in small
classes being especially unlikely to use humor (Crawford &
MacLeod, 1990). Previous research about instructor gender
and humor in the classroom also suggested differences
between the perceptions of humor for males and females. If
the instructor was a male using humor, humor positively
related to appeal, delivery, and teaching effectiveness. If the
instructor was a female, only the use of hostile humor was
associated with enhanced appeal. However, use of some non-
hostile forms of humor was associated with a loss of appeal
(Bryant et al., 1980). Darling and Civikly (1987) found that
a male teacher using non-tendentious humor and a female
teacher using tendentious humor are perceived as more self-
protective than helpful. A male teacher using no humor is
perceived as more forthright and truthful than the same
teacher using either tendentious or non-tendentious humor.
Van Giffen (1990) reported ratings by students of their
instructor's sense of humor was a better predictor of how the
student would rate the instructor on course evaluations, if the
instructor was a female rather than a male. Prior research is not
conclusive for whether a difference exists if the student is
female or male, when it comes to humor as an instructional
technique and its relationship with different educational out-
comes. Older findings imply if the instructor was male, a favor-
able view is reported. However, in more recent times, it seems
that this perception has changed. In some instances, female
instructors are viewed more favorable when using humor.
But the research about the gender of the students and how
the use of humor by the instructor might have relationship
with perceived or actual learning is not comprehensive.
There is a significant body of research, however, about the
differences between the genders in regard to humor outside
of the classroom. When it comes to gender and humor, some
researchers found differences between the genders in the per-
ception of humor. Jackson and Jackson (1997) had male and
female participant's rate jokes with either a male initiator/
female joke or vice versa. They found that the gender of the
joke target made no difference for the male participants.
Jokes with male targets had a significantly higher rating than
jokes with female targets, when the participants were female.
Research Questions
The literature review that was presented illustrates that study
of the relationship between humor and learning was either
studied in the form of short-term interventions without con-
sidering the gender of the students, and there is no one study
to be found that examined both the relationship between dif-
ferent types of humor and perceived and actual learning
through an entire academic semester. It is of interest to exam-
ine whether those two types of learning both have a relation-
ship with different types of humor in the same study using
the same participants and with the same kind of circum-
stances (course content).
In this study, the perceived learning of students was mea-
sured by how much they felt that they learned in the course
and actual learning as measured by their final grade in the
course. The study sought college students as participants.
The main reason for selecting college students is that humor
is more developed in this cohort as compared with those in
early childhood (McGhee, 1983). When looking at college
age humor, different types of humor are more understandable
and can have a stronger relationship compared with earlier
years where sense of humor is less developed. Childhood
humor might demonstrate a lower familiarity with various
types of humor along with no formal preference for different
types of humor. The present study also examined whether
there were differences between the genders for student par-
ticipants in predicting different educational outcomes by dif-
ferent types of humor.
Research Question 1: Which type of humor would have
a positive relationship with the educational outcomes for
perceived and actual learning?
Hypothesis 1: The use of relevant and appropriate humor
will have a positive relationship with perceived learning
(Ulloth, 2002) and actual learning (Ziv, 1988). This ques-
tion was examined with each type of learning and the dif-
ferent types of humor separately.
Hypothesis 2: The use of non-relevant humor will not
have a positive relationship with actual learning (Ziv,
1988).
Research Question 2: Would gender moderate the rela-
tionship for type of humor with the different types of
learning (perceived and actual)?
Hypothesis 3: There will be a difference between genders
on the relationship of different types of humor with differ-
ent educational outcomes (Jackson & Jackson, 1997).
Method
Participants
Participants were students who enrolled in an introductory
psychology class at a medium size public university located
in the rocky mountain region with approximately 90 stu-
dents enrolled in each section. The course is a liberal arts
4 SAGE Open
elective. Students were required to either participate in stud-
ies to receive credits or write a paper instead. Based on a
power analysis conducted with G*Power 3.1 software (Faul,
Erdfelder, Buchner, & Lang, 2009), a sample size of 92 par-
ticipants was required for this study with an effect size of
0.15, error probability of 0.05, power of 0.8, and four pre-
dictors. Table 1 provides descriptive characteristics of
participants.
Procedures
Participants were recruited by using the computerized
recruiting pool. All participants were students taking one of
several introductory psychology class. Different instructors
taught the various sections of this format similar course. The
department requires all instructors to use the same textbook
and teach the same assigned topics. In the study, there were
participants from all seven sections of a general psychology
course offered during a semester. Six different instructors
taught these sections (one instructor taught two sections).
Participants were invited to answer the study questions in
a lab setting with approximately 1 month left in the academic
semester. After completion of the consent process and agree-
ing to participate in the study, participants were asked to
complete questions on perceived learning and their instruc-
tor's sense of humor. Verbal instructions for each survey
along with a copy of the informed consent were provided.
Student final grades were obtained at the completion of the
semester.
Instrumentation
Demographic measure.Using a self-report questionnaire,
demographic information was collected to describe the sam-
ple characteristics of the groups. This instrument included
questions about participant age, gender, ethnicity, major,
minor, academic year, cumulative grade point average, and
course specifics (e.g., course title, instructor's name).
Humor measure. To examine humor use by the instructor, a
questionnaire was developed. The questionnaire was devel-
oped using humor items recognized by Wanzer et al. (2006).
For example, participants were asked of how frequently their
instructor used relevant humor, non-relevant humor, appro-
priate humor, inappropriate humor, offensive humor, self-
deprecating humor, self-deprecating others types of humor,
and spontaneous humor. Questions about relevant and non-
relevant humor were asked 3 times by varying the wording
so as to examine reliability. Students were asked the
following:
How often does your instructor use humor that is relevant to the
topic?
How often does your instructor use humor that promotes
understanding of the topic?
How often does your instructor use humor that is related to the
course content? How often does your instructor use humor that
is NOT relevant to the topic?
How often does your instructor use humor that does NOT
promote understanding of the topic?
How often does your instructor use humor that is NOT related to
the course content?
How often does your instructor use humor that is appropriate?
By appropriate we mean: you feel comfortable with the sense of
humor being used.
How often does your instructor NOT use humor that is
appropriate?
How often does your instructor use self-disparaging humor to
laugh about oneself?

How often does your instructor use disparaging humor, i.e.,
targeting students by making fun of them in the class?
How often does your instructor use humor that is spontaneous
and unplanned?
How often does the instructor use disparaging humor-targeting
others (e.g., making fun of a celebrity)?
How often does your instructor use offensive humor (e.g., sexual
jokes)?
Possible answers for the questions were as follows: never,
less than once a class period, once or twice a class period,
and more than once or twice a class period. Answers were
given a number ranging from zero through four.
Perceived learning measure.This measure for the current
study asked students to reflect on how much they believed
they learned in the course. A Likert-type scale was used to
measure this perception. The measure asked the following
question: When thinking about PSY 120 (Principles of Psy-
chology), how much would you say that you learned from
the instructor in your class? Possible answers were as fol-
lows: (a) I did not learn at all; (b) I learned a little bit; (c) I
learned something not too little, but not too much; (d) I
learned a lot.
Actual learning measure.The student's final grade in the
course, reported by the instructor, served as the actual learn-
ing measure for the study. Participants consented to the
release of this information.
Analysis
Data analysis was conducted using SPSS version 22. Factor
analysis was conducted to determine the number of humor
types loaded together. In addition, a reliability analysis was
conducted to examine the types of humor that factored
together. The study examined the relationship between
study variables (using Spearman's rho correlation) and pre-
diction of normally distributed dependent variables using
multiple regression. An interaction between gender and the
types of humor as predictors was also examined.
Results
Descriptive and Correlational Statistics
Table 1 provides a breakdown of participant characteristics. In
short, the study consisted of 195 undergraduate students, there
were 205 participants who filled out surveys but 10 were elim-
inated with missing data (n = 117, 60% female and n = 78,
40% male). The age of these participants ranged from 18 to 25,
with a mean of 18.91 years (SD = 1.29).Atotal of 146 (74.9%)
participants were first year students, 24 (12.3%) were second
year students, 19 (9.7%) were third year students, and 6 (3.1%)
indicated being in at least their fourth year of undergraduate
education. The most reported academic majors were business
(n = 33, 16.9%), psychology (n = 27, 13.8%), undeclared (n =
16, 8.2%), athletic administration (n = 13, 6.6%), and other (n
= 89, 54.3%). The current study included 121 (62.1%)
Caucasian, 26 (13.3%) Biracial, 22 (11.3%) Hispanic, 18
(9.2%)AfricanAmerican, seven (3.6%)Asian, and one (0.5%)
Pacific Islander or Native Hawaiian; most of the participants
(85.6%) received a course grade of C- or better. Table 2 pro-
vides averages for humor types, as well as correlational statis-
tics between humor types and educational outcomes. The
average course grade for each section is as follows (on a scale
of 0 to 4): Section 1 (2.59), Section 2 (2.57), Section 3 (2.96),
Section 4 (2.63), Section 5 (3.17), Sections 6 and 7 (2.39) had
the same instructor. Participants from these two sections were
submitted with no section identifiers.
An Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) using the
Maximum Likelihood extraction methods with a varimax
(oblique) rotation method for the different questions about
humor types was conducted on data gathered from the
same 195 participants. First, all of the humor styles were
entered; at this point, four major factors emerged. Factor 1
included the three items that asked about relevant humor in
three different ways (using the words: relevant, promotes
understanding, and related) and two additional items that
asked about spontaneous humor and appropriate humor.
Factor 2 included the three items that asked about non-
relevant humor (using the words: not relevant, does not
promote understanding, and not related). Factor 3 included
one item that asked about self-disparaging humor, and one
item that asked about disparaging others (students). Those
items had a low factor loading. Factor 4 included three
items. One item asked about relevant humor, one about
appropriate humor, and one item about offensive humor.
Two of those items (relevant humor and appropriate
humor) cross-loaded with the first factor loading, but with
weaker value. Factors 1 and 2 showed the most significant
values (more than .70).
The spontaneous humor item had a low loading on the
first factor loading and was dropped. With this item dropped,
all of the relevant humor items loaded with one another.
Appropriate humor also loaded with the three questions that
asked about relevant humor. All of the non-relevant humor
items also loaded together. This resulted in a two-factor solu-
tion: related/appropriate humor and non-related humor.
Reliability for the four items measuring related/appropriate
humor was .90, and reliability for the three items measuring
non-relative humor was .78. Table 3 displays results for the
oblique rotation. The first factor had an eigenvalue of 3.16,
and it accounted for 45.21% of the variance in the data.
Factor 2 had an eigenvalue of 2.11 and accounted for a fur-
ther 30.18% of the variance.
Thus, two humor types were considered in the remaining
portion of this article (relevant/appropriate and non-relevant).
6 SAGE Open
It is worth mentioning that negatively worded items might fall
into the same factor and should be considered alongside study
results.
Primary Analyses
Subsequent analyses examined the different research ques-
tions. For each research question, several regression analyses
were conducted with different independent and dependent
variables and moderating variables.
Research Questions
The first question asked, "Which type of humor (relevant/
appropriate non-relevant) would have a positive type of rela-
tionships with the educational outcomes of perceived learn-
ing and actual learning?" And the second research question
asked, "Would gender moderate the relationship of the types
of humor with the different educational outcomes (perceived
and actual learning)?"
A linear regression was conducted. In Step 1, gender was
entered; in Step 2, the humor types of relevant/appropriate
and non-relevant were entered; and in Step 3, the interactions
of each humor type with gender were entered. Interactions
were entered separately for each of the educational outcomes
after variables were centered.
Perceived learning. In Step 1, with just gender as a predictor,
the model explained 1.2% of the variance: F(1, 193) = 2.27,
p < .13. Gender did not significantly predict perceived learn-
ing. In Step 2, with the two humor types entered, the model
explained 25.4% of the variance. There was statistically sig-
nificant change in r2: F(2, 191) = 30.94, p < .00. Relevant/
appropriate humor significantly predicted perceived learning
( = .50, p < .00), but non-relevant humor was not a signifi-
cant predictor ( = -.10, p = .10). In Step 3, the gender by
humor type interactions were entered. There was not a statis-
tically significant change in r2 (p = .79) and none of the inter-
actions predicted perceived learning. Table 4 presents these
results.
Actual learning. In Step 1, with just gender as a predictor, the
model explained 2.2% of the variance: F(1, 193) = 4.33, p <
.03. Gender significantly predicted actual learning ( = .14,
p < .00). In Step 2, with the two humor types entered, the
model explained 3.8% of the variance. There was no signifi-
cant change in r2: F(2, 191) = 2.54, p = .19. Relevant/appro-
priate did not predict actual learning ( = -.11, p = .12), and
neither did non-relevant humor ( = .09, p = .21). In Step 3,
the gender by humor type interactions were entered. There
was no statistically significant change in r2 (p = .33), and
none of the interactions predicted actual learning (Table 5).
Discussion
The relationship between different forms of humor and dif-
ferent types of learning is an important question. Humor is
used within the classroom in various ways (Wanzer et al.,
2006) with some instructors using humor as an instructional
technique (Lundberg & Thurston, 2002). Accordingly, it was
of interest to examine the relationship of different types of
humor with perceived and actual learning. It was also of
interest to examine possible mediating factors. Gender was
chosen as a factor to be examined, due to the fact that there is
not a significant amount of research in this area (Jackson &

Jackson, 1997). With the educational system divided into dif-
fering levels (elementary, middle school, high school, col-
lege), university/college students were chosen as the focus
for the potential toward a greater understanding of humor
types and individual preference.
With regard to the four measures of humor, factor analy-
ses revealed appropriate and relevant humor loaded together
with the only reliable types of humor being relevant/appro-
priate and non-relevant. Accordingly, only two types of
instructor humor were evaluated. It was found that certain
types of humor were positively related to certain educational
outcomes. The analysis suggests that the use of relevant/
appropriate humor by an instructor predicts higher levels of
perceived learning.
Appropriate humor is the type of humor students feel
comfortable with and can predict positive emotions among
students. Appropriate humor was positively associated with
perceived learning. The current study found the more appro-
priate humor used, the higher perceived learning reported by
students. According to Instructional Humor Processing
Theory (IHPT), if there is a positive affect, the message
enhances student ability to process information with reports
of learning and retention occurring (Wanzer, M. B., Frymier,
A. B., & Irwin). For the current study, relevant humor posi-
tively correlates with perceived learning. This affirms IHPT
(Wanzer et al., 2010), which suggests instructors who use
related humor during a course promote learning in a positive
manner. For the current study, students report the more
instructors use relevant humor, the more students believe
they learned from the instructor in the course. Therefore,
humor may relate to the perceived learning of students for
that specific course.
There may be no relationship between different types of
humor and actual learning, this may suggest that the use of
humor by an instructor does not directly contribute to higher
levels of actual learning. In previous studies, a relationship
between types of humor and actual learning was found (Ziv,
1988). Perhaps in the current study, humor was not targeted
in the same deliberative manner as in the Ziv study where
specific jokes were chosen so as to relate to course materials

and used throughout the entire semester. In the present
study, the type of humor used varied and not all related to
course materials. Also, the current study incorporated more
measures of actual learning by comparison, while the Ziv
study used the final exams as actual learning and integrated
three purposeful types of humor. These variations may have
affected why different conclusions are drawn from Ziv
(1988).
There were no differences in the classroom between
males and females in the manner in which different types
of humor related to different educational outcomes. It may
be that because of the similar experiences for both males
and females, similar humor preferences allow for similar
impressions.
Recommendations
There are three specific recommendations resulting from the
present study. First, relevant/appropriate humor correlated
with perceived learning in a positive manner. This indicates
specific types of humor used in the classroom are associated
with higher levels of student perceived learning. If instruc-
tors use humor that is relevant and appropriate in the class-
room, it may contribute to higher levels of perceived learning
for that specific course and for those specific students.
Second, there were no differences in the classroom between
males and females in the manner in which different types of
humor related to different types of learning. It may be that
because of the similar experiences for both males and
females, similar humor preferences will allow for similar
impressions. Third, when taking into account the Ziv (1988)
study, actual learning can have a relationship with different
types of humor. This may be the case if humor is specific to
course material and targeted in such way to emphasize that
specific information.
Limitations
The present study is of value in understanding the use of
instructor humor within the college classroom. However,
there are several limitations. The first limitation of this study
is that this was not a cause and effect study, and the author
could not conclude the use of humor will result in higher or
lower levels of different types of learning. Future studies will
want to consider a cause and effect design.
The second limitation is the fact that all of the instructors
were female. This happened by chance. Instructors who
taught the class in the prior semester included both males and
females. The original intention of the study was to examine
both the gender of students and teachers. However, because
only female instructors were teaching the course at the time
of data collection, it was only possible to consider student
gender. Future research needs to examine instructor-related
gender issues.
Directions for Future Research
The limitations presented in the previous section provide a
roadmap to how the study was conducted. Suggestions for
possible improvement toward gaining a more thorough
understanding of the relationship between different types of
humor and specific types of learning are provided. There are
at least two potential directions for future research.
First, an experimental design should be used so research
can draw a cause and effect conclusions about the rela-
tionship between different types of humor with different
types of learning. Specifically, future research could test
the suggested causal relationship: relevant/appropriate
humor increases perceived learning and also the possible
relationship that was found in previous studies between
relevant humor and actual learning. Second, future
research should continue to examine both female and male
instructors and their use of humor in the classroom. This
may shed light on whether there are additional differences
in the manner in which humor is judged by students and
its relationship with perceived and actual learning, if the
instructor is male or female. This kind of research will
also make it possible to look at the relationship between
gender of the student and gender of the instructor.
Including both genders with equal male to female ratios
would be preferential.
