A Longitudinal Study of Paternal Mental Health During
Transition to Fatherhood as Young Adults
WHAT'S KNOWN ON THIS SUBJECT: There is growing
understanding of the detrimental effect of paternal depression on
children. The transition to fatherhood is a unique time for men.
Identifying which fathers are at-risk and when will inform
effective methods to help men and their families.
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: Nonresident fathers have the highest
depression symptom scores, peaking before entering fatherhood.
Although resident fathers' scores decrease preceding entry into
fatherhood, there is a significant increase from 0 to 5 years of
their child's life when key parent­infant attachment occurs.
abstract
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Rates of paternal depression range
from 5% to 10% with a growing body of literature describing the harm
to fathers, children, and families. Changes in depression symptoms
over the life course, and the role of social factors, are not well known.
This study examines associations with changes in depression symp-
toms during the transition to fatherhood for young fathers and whether
this association differed by key social factors.
METHODS: We combined all 4 waves of the National Longitudinal Study of
Adolescent Health to support a 23-year longitudinal analysis of 10 623
men and then created a "fatherhood-year" data set, regressing age-
adjusted standardized depressive symptoms scores on fatherhood
status (nonresidence/residence), fatherhood-years, and covariates to
determine associations between Center for Epidemiologic Studies
Depression Scale scores and fatherhood life course intervals.
RESULTS: Depressive symptom scores reported at the entry into fa-
therhood are higher for nonresident fathers than nonfathers, which
in turn are higher than those of resident fathers. Resident fathers have
a significant decrease in scores during late adolescence (b = ­0.035,
P = .023), but a significant increase in scores during early fatherhood
(b = 0.023, P = .041). From entrance into fatherhood to the end of
early fatherhood (+5 years), the depressive symptoms score for res-
ident fathers increases on average by 68%.
CONCLUSIONS: In our longitudinal, population-based study, resident
fathers show increasing depressive symptom scores during children's
key attachment years of 0­5. Identifying at-risk fathers based on social
factors and designing effective interventions may ultimately improve
health outcomes for the entire family. Pediatrics 2014;133:836­843

screening rates of clinical paternal
depression ranging from 5% to 10%.1­5
Depressed fathers exhibit poorer par-
enting behaviors,6 lower likelihood of
child engagement, and greater likeli-
hood of parenting stress and child
neglect7 than non-depressed fathers.8
Children of depressed fathers are at
risk for later psychiatric disorders,3
poorer language and reading devel-
opment,9 and increased risks of be-
haviorproblems,includingpeerproblems,
conduct problems, and poorer pro-
social behaviors across ages, than
children of nondepressed fathers.2,5 Al-
though studies show a decline in young
men's physical health during the tran-
sition to fatherhood,10­12 less is known
about the mental health of fathers
during the transition. Several social
factors may be implicated.13 First, off-
time entry into fatherhood, in which
men become fathers outside the typical
timeframe for their generational peers,
particularly during the adolescent years,
may increase risk of depressive symp-
toms8,14 making the earlier years of fa-
thering especially important in early
childhood development. Second, father's
living arrangements may play a role be-
cause nonresident fathers report higher
levels of depression and anxiety.8,15­20
Finally, race/ethnicity has been shown to
be an important factor in depression in
general with non-Hispanic blacks and
Hispanics more likely to report major
depression than non-Hispanic whites.21­23
No studies of paternal depression that
we are aware of have examined these
factors collectively over time before and
after becoming a father. Given the sig-
nificant negative consequences of pa-
ternal depression early on in fatherhood
and the potential of exposing offspring
during key early childhood develop-
mental stages when fathers are in their
early fathering years, understanding
the progression of fathers' depression
and delineating key points of potential
intervention are paramount.
The developmental window across
the life course during which fathers
are at-risk or experience depression
symptoms has not been well estab-
lished. Life course theory posits that
appropriately timed interventions
hold the most promise for improved
long-term outcomes and decreased
disparities.24 One such successful
application is a smoking cessation
intervention designed specifically
for fathers using the transition to
fatherhood as an intervention point.25
Thus, understanding the evolution of
paternal mental health along the life
course may identify key windows with
the greatest potential for interventions
to improve the well-being of fathers and,
ultimately, their children.
The primary goal of this study was to
assess how the transition into fa-
therhood may be associated with
changes in depression among men
and whether this association differed
by key social factors. Our data come
from the National Longitudinal Study
of Adolescent Health (Add Health),
which followed a representative sample
of American youth from adolescence
through early adulthood (20 745 total
adolescents).Thesize,longitudinal scope,
andnationalrepresentationofAddHealth
provide an exceptional opportunity to
investigate the determinants of mental
health among males as they progress
from adolescence into young adulthood.
We examined a 2-sided hypothesis that
change exists between fatherhood pe-
riod and depressive symptoms. We fur-
ther examined the association between
changes in depression and key social
factors.
METHODS
Study Design and Sample
Add Health is a nationally representa-
tive, longitudinal study of the social,
behavioral, and biomedical health of
20 745 youth begun in 1994 as they prog-
ress from adolescence into adulthood.
Wave I interviews (population N = 20
745, male n = 10 263; overall response
rate: 79%) were conducted in 1994­
1995; Wave II (N = 14 738, n = 7182; 88%)
in 1996; Wave III (N = 15 197, n = 7167;
77%) 6 years later in 2001­2002, and
Wave IV (N = 15 701, n = 7349; 80%) in
2007­2008. Add Health intentionally
oversampled adolescents from various
income, racial/ethnic, and disability
subgroups26; study-supplied weights
correct for this. Data were combined
to support a continuous time analysis
of participants' differing life stages
across waves such that all variables
had values for each year covered by the
study. Our institutional review board
approved this investigation.
Measures
Depressive Symptoms
All participants reported on their
symptoms of depression at each wave
of the survey using 10 items drawn
from the well-validated Center for Ep-
idemiologic Studies Depression Scale
(CES-D) scale.27,28 We examined the
mean, SD, and quartiles for all 10
questions across each wave; scores
were averaged and standardized to
create a total score with adequate
internal reliability at each wave (a1
=
0.762, a2
= 0.767, a3
= 0.759, a4
=
0.811),29 using accepted methods.30­32
An age-adjusted standardized de-
pressive symptoms score was created
from this unadjusted score to control
for differences of depressive symp-
toms across ages along fatherhood-
years. This age-adjusted depressive
symptoms score was calculated by
finding the expected value of the un-
adjusted score for each age and sub-
tracting it from each participant's
unadjusted score. The expected val-
ues were found by regressing all ages
on the unadjusted standardized de-
pressive symptoms score. Therefore,
an increase or decrease in the age-
adjusted depressive symptoms score

is commensurable across all 3 groups
throughout the fatherhood years. The
changes in this score represent a rela-
tive change in a normally distributed
depressive symptoms outcome.
Fatherhood Status and Time in
Fatherhood
Fatherhoodstatuswasdefinedbyusing
the household roster (reports on each
member of their household) and live
child data set (reports on each child
they have fathered) in each wave. Men
who had listed a biological child in the
household roster or live child data set
were categorized as a father. Father's
residence was coded into 3 categories:
resident fathers, nonresident fathers,
and nonfathers. Resident or nonresident
father classification was held constant
through all future waves. Nonfathers
were the referent group throughout
the analyses.
We created a person-year file in which
all relevant interview years of any given
sample male's longitudinal record were
broken into separate data records, each
of which contained the male's identifi-
cation number and demographic and
mental health data used in the analysis.
For these "fatherhood-year" records,
fatherhood status in each of the possi-
ble years of the data collection period
was calculated on the basis of wave-
specific information regarding the age
of the firstborn child. For example, a
participant who first mentioned a 3-
year-old in wave IV was coded as having
+3 fatherhood-years in wave IV and ­3
fatherhood years in wave III (which was
conducted 6 years before wave IV), ­9
fatherhood years in wave II (which was
conducted 12 years earlier) and ­10
fatherhood years in wave I (which was
conducted 13 years earlier). Data from
males who were never observed to be
fathers were centered at the mean age
of entrance into fatherhood for all fa-
thers in the sample, which was 23. Thus,
"fatherhood years" for a nonfather ob-
served when the nonfather was 26 are
codedas+3.Thisallowsforcomparisons
of fatherhood-years over the 19-year
span between nonfathers (14­33) and
fathers (­9 to +10) and resembles
other approaches to defining person-
years surrounding events of interest.15
The term "fatherhood-years" is used
for fathers and nonfathers.
Control Variables
Covariates coded for each person-year
observation included respondents'
race/ethnicity and own mother's edu-
cation (wave I), and education, physical
health, income, marital status, and
number of children (each wave). Race/
ethnicity was categorized as white,
black, Asian, Hispanic, and other with
white as the referent group for the
analyses. Marital status was measured
at entrance into fatherhood. Although
there was a significant difference be-
tween resident and nonresident fathers
and marital status, marital status was
not collinear with fatherhood status and
had minimal affect on regression coef-
ficients when removed (bdiff
6 0.005);
therefore, it was kept in the model.

Statistical Analysis
Mean levels of depressive symptoms
scores were first analyzed by using
tests of differences (ie, 2-group t tests,
analysis of variance) over 2 social
determinants of interest, fatherhood
status and race/ethnicity. Next, a gen-
eralized estimating equation (GEE)
model was estimated to control for
other covariates and to measure de-
pressive symptom change over time.
The GEE allows for outcomes to corre-
late over time, features an exchange-
able correlation structure, and does
not impose stringent assumptions of
means, variances, and distributions on
longitudinal data. Missing data are
handled under a missing completely at
random structure.33
Using GEE, we estimate a spline model
with 3 knots modeling 4 mutually ex-
clusive time category intervals to
evaluate possible nonlinear change
before and after fatherhood and based
on a life course perspective: adoles-
cence (defined in our data to include ­9
up to ­4 fatherhood-years), late ado-
lescence (from ­4 up to 0 fatherhood-
years), early fatherhood (from 0 up to
+5 fatherhood-years) and later father-
hood (from +5 up to +10 fatherhood-
years). Using splines has the benefit of
estimating linear segments of time-
based functions that might be non-
linearacross the entire period.Analyses
were performed by using Stata/SE 12.1.
RESULTS
Descriptive Findings
Of 10 253 men in the sample, 6828
(66.5%) were nonfathers, and 3425
(33.5%) were fathers by wave 4; of
those fathers, at the time of the child's
birth 686 (20.03%) were nonresident,
and 2739 (79.97%) were resident
(Table 1). The majority of nonfathers
and resident fathers were white, and
equal numbers of nonresident fathers
were white and black. Most resident
fathers were married (78%) compared
with nonresident fathers (8%) and
nonfathers (13%).
The 10 CES-D depressive symptom
scores and descriptive statistics are
presented inTable2.Thecross-sectional
mean depressive symptoms scores for
fathers at 0 fatherhood-years and non-
fathers at age 23 years are shown in
Table 3. Scores at 0 fatherhood-years
indicate that there are significant dif-
ferences between the 3 groups, with
resident fathers having significantly
lower depressive symptoms than non-
fathers, who in turn were significantly
lower than nonresident fathers. Sim-
ilarly, there are differing scores at
0 fatherhood-years by fatherhood cat-
egory within certain races (Table 4)
and differences in depression scores
by race, with black and Hispanic men
have higher mean scores than white
men among both nonfathers and resi-
dent fathers (Table 5).
Regression Results
Depression and Fatherhood Status
The regression results in Table 6 show
trends in depressive symptom scores
for all 3 groups of fathers, with non-
fathers as the referent group. For
nonfathers, none of the 4 time slope
estimates is statistically significant.
For resident fathers, however, the in-
teraction variable between fatherhood
status and the late adolescence time
period is negative and statistically sig-
nificant (b = ­0.055, P = .02) compared
with nonfathers. This indicates that be-
fore becoming a resident father, de-
pressive symptoms are occurring less
often. Yet the child's birth reverses this
downward trend; resident fathers show
a statistically significant increase in the
depressive symptoms score during
early fatherhood (b = 0.033, P = .04)
compared with nonfathers. Thus, from

entrance into fatherhood to the end of
early fatherhood (0­5 years), the de-
pressive symptoms score for resident
fathers increases by 0.023 per year, or
by 0.115 U over the 5-year period. Taking
the highest depressive symptom score,
which occurs in the adolescent period
(­0.009), and subtracting the lowest
score at the entrance to fatherhood
(­0.179), results in a difference of 0.170 U.
Considering this range, early residen-
tial fatherhood constitutes an average
increase of 68% of the average resident
father's total score. Early fatherhood
therefore represents a period of large
change in depressive symptoms for
resident fathers. In contrast, none of
the 4 coefficients on interaction terms
representing nonresident fathers is
statistically significant.
Figure 1 illustrates the trajectories of
age-adjusted depressive symptoms for
resident and nonresident fathers taken
from the regression coefficients; the 2
statistically significant periods are the
decrease in resident fathers' scores
before the child's birth and the in-
crease in scores after the birth.
Depression and Other Covariates
Mother's education, own education,
physical health, employment, marriage,
and income level were all associated
with lower levels of age-adjusted de-
pressive symptoms scores (Table 6).
There is evidence that each additional
child is positively associated with de-
pressive symptoms (b = 0.047, P , .05);
limiting the range of children did not
affect the outcome. Table 6 also shows
that race is associated with mean levels
of depressive symptoms scores. Com-
pared with the referent group of white
males, all other race/ethnicities repor-
ted a significantly higher level of de-
pressive symptoms.
DISCUSSION
In the first study of its kind using na-
tionally representative longitudinal
data to follow depressive symptoms of
young men during the transition to
fatherhood, we find that resident
fathers experience a decrease in de-
pressive symptoms scores in the pe-
riod immediately preceding entry into
fatherhood but then have a 68% in-
crease in their scores through the
child's first 5 years of life. For chil-
dren, the 0 to 5 years are key de-
velopmental years when attachment,
security, and the ability to safely ex-
plore and learn in one's environment
are of paramount importance. Parents
are responsible for creating such en-
vironments. Unrecognized paternal de-
pression during this time period,
whether due to a lack of awareness or
a lack of access to health care services
for fathers, may adversely affect infant

and toddler development, parental re-
lationships, and father well-being. The
transition to fatherhood and early fa-
therhood years may indeed be optimal
time points along the life course trajec-
tory to identify fathers at risk for or
suffering from depressive symptoms
and intervene.
Findings from the nonresident fathers
and nonfathers groups, although not
statistically significant, provide addi-
tional key context. In the years just
before the transition to fatherhood (ie,
late adolescence), young men who are
not going to become a father have
relativelystablescores,whereasthose
who will become nonresident fathers'
show an increase and those who will
become resident fathers show a de-
crease in scores. It is nonresident
fathers reporting the highest levels of
mean depressive symptoms scores
among the 3 groups, reaching a maxi-
mum just before entering fatherhood.
This confirms earlier research placing
nonresident fathers at higher risk for
depression.15,16 The lack of statistical
significance may be due in part to
smaller sample sizes; future studies
with larger sample sizes, either from
this data set as time passes or in
others, are warranted. Some may ar-
gue that selection into fatherhood may
be playing a role, with the strongest
argument being that those with the
lowest scores are likely to find a part-
ner and become a resident father.
Nevertheless, our findings show the
unique path each group takes over
time that plays a role when concep-
tualizing effective interventions and
programs for young men.
Race/ethnicity, another key social
factor, was associated with depressive
symptoms scores with black and His-
panic fathers showing higher levels
comparedwithwhitesateachdatapoint
and along the trajectories. This is con-
sistent with previous research.8,21,22
For those races with higher baseline
scores (ie, blacks, Hispanics), this rel-
ative increase in scores may result in
a clinically significant rise in overall
symptom scores. With other studies
reporting that depression is highest
among ethnic minority fathers,8,28
special attention to the mental health
of men of color is necessary.

Viewing these results from a life course
perspective, a number of implications
emerge. First, nonresident and resident
fathers have different mental health
trajectories from late adolescence into
early fatherhood. Therefore, designing
strategiestoidentifytheseyoungmenat
the appropriate times is key to im-
provingtheirwell-beingandthatoftheir
offspring. Of note, a growing body of
research finds fathers present at pedi-
atric visits,34,35 suggesting that identify-
ing at-risk fathers at these encounters
is possible. Second, depressive symp-
tom scores among nonfathers and
nonresident fathers increase in late
adolescence. If identified early enough
and acted on, peak scores during the
transition to fatherhood (or age 23 for
nonfathers) may be diminished. This is
likely to be true for black and Hispanic
men who start with higher scores. Fi-
nally, when considering interventions, it
is essential to remember that men of
the child-rearing ages 18 to 44 are less
likely to be engaged in the health care
system, have a primary care physician,
and have insurance compared with
women,13,36 thereby making the identi-
fication of mental health problems dif-
ficult at the very time when the impact
on children and families may be the
greatest. Several initiatives, such as the
Affordable Care Act37 and a new focus
on preconception care,38 offer potential
to improve the care for young men.
Identifying changes in paternal mental
health today faces similar challenges
to identifying maternal mental health
changes in the past. Chief among them
is finding effective screening tools.
Men are typically more willing to ac-
knowledge fatigue, irritability, anhe-
donia, and sleep disturbances rather
than reporting sadness, worthless-
ness, or guilt.28,39,40 Useful screens
do exist, including the Edinburgh Post-
natal Depression Scale,41 the 5-item
Mental Health Inventory,42 the 36-item
Short Form Health Survey,43 the General
Health Questionnaire,44 the CES-D,27 and
the Patient Health Questionnaire--2.45
The next issue to address is identifying
next steps for those men who screen
positive. This is a more formative hur-
dle; first, men are often reticent to seek
help, and, second, finding appropriate
referral sources for men may be dif-
ficult.46,47 Comprehensive clinical in-
terventions designed specifically for
depressed fathers are minimal.11,48 The
current study identifies the life course
timing during which programs and
interventions could be designed to ad-
dress paternal depression.
The nature and timing of longitudinal
data collection present several limi-
tations. First, we have variable point
estimates that we estimate to be
linear but may be nonlinear. By using
splines, we ensure our linear slopes
provide reasonable estimates dur-
ing each time period. Second, be-
cause of timing, our sample consists
ofyoungerfathers.However,resident
fathers age of fatherhood entry, 25, is
the same as the National Survey of
Family Growth's age at first birth for
men from 2006 to 2010.49 We cannot
generalize our findings to men who
become fathers before age 18, who
have been fathers for .10 years, or
are older fathers. Finally, because
we constrained the fatherhood sta-
tus variable to 1 entry per partici-
pant, we cannot address the changes
some fathers may have made from
nonresident to resident or vice versa.
Future research that can track these
changes and the role these changes
have on mental health is important.
CONCLUSIONS
With the growing appreciation of the role
fathers play in the health and develop-
ment of their children, understanding
the natural history of paternal de-
pression over the life course has
implications for fathers'own well-being
and involvement as well as the well-
being of their children. In our longitu-
dinal, population-based study, non-
resident fathers showed an increase in
depressive symptoms leading up to
fatherhood, whereas resident fathers
showed an increase in depression
symptoms during their children's years
0 through 5, key development years for
child bonding and attachment. Identi-
fying at-risk fathers and designing ef-
fective interventions may improve
health outcomes for themselves, their
children, and their family.
