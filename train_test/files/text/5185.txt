Introduction
As the mean age increases around the world, the factors that
determine the health and well-being of older populations are
increasingly recognized as critical public health issues
(Mawby, 2004). Within this research area, one can find two
broad lines of inquiry--a literature investigating how the
physical and social environment affects mental health out-
comes, and a body of research showing how fear of crime
(FOC) and victimization affects the way older adults live and
behave. The current article aims to synthesize these diverse
literatures for the interested reader, and presents some plau-
sible physiological mechanisms through which FOC may
directly or indirectly affect the life span development of the
brain to modulate mental health in an effort to aid further
development of research in this area.
The Environment and Mental Health
The impact of both the physical and social environment on an
individual's mental health has long been appreciated (Faris &
Dunham, 1939; Srole et al., 1962). In particular, a great deal
of research has shown that an older adult's neighborhood of
residence is an important determinant of his or her mental
health. Neighborhood characteristics such as affluence,
inequality, and residential stability can significantly affect
health even after controlling for a number of individual-level
factors (Beard et al., 2009; Boardman, Finch, Ellison,
Williams, & Jackson, 2001; Chaix, Rosvall, & Merlo, 2007;
Diez, 2001; Subramanian, Kubzansky, Berkman, Fay, &
Kawachi, 2006). A number of theories have been proposed to
explain the association between neighborhood characteristics
and mental health outcomes. Researchers have proposed that
neighborhoods with greater disadvantage and/or inequality
inherently have lower levels of social cohesion and weaker
capacity for social control (Sampson, Morenoff, & Gannon-
Rowley, 2002). The lack of cohesion often results in poor
social organization and lower levels of trust, which both pro-
vide a chronic stressor and inhibit the ability of social net-
works to buffer stress (Lin, Ye, & Ensel, 1999; Ross &
Mirowsky, 2001; Sampson, Raudenbush, & Earls, 1997;
Sampson & Raudenbush, 2004). A critical mediator in this
relationship between neighborhood and mental health may be
FOC. Since the term first emerged in the late 1930s, wide-
spread discourse concerning FOC emerged among profes-
sionals and academics, quickly turning FOC into an
established social scientific concept (Lee, 2007). Furthermore,
data indicate that increases in the rate of crime coverage may
be driving the growth of FOC (Critcher, 2008; Ericson, 2007;
Lee, 2007; J. Taylor, Eitle, & Russell, 2009). As such, this
article attempts to provide a timely synthesis of the evidence
for the role of FOC in determining the mental health of older
populations.

Scared Sick: Relating Fear of Crime to
Mental Health in Older Adults
Rachael E. Collins1 and Diano F. Marrone2
Abstract
The factors that determne the health and well-being of older populations are increasingly recognized as critical public health
issues. The focus of this review article is to provide evidence for the role of fear of crime in determining the mental health
of older populations. The fear of crime is a complex construct, as the vast majority of fear is not related to actual rates of
victimization. Here, we synthesize the literature on fear of crime and how the physical and social environment can profoundly
affect mental health outcomes. The review presents some plausible physiological mechanisms by which fear of crime may
directly or indirectly affect the life span development of the brain to modulate mental health in an effort to aid further
development of research in this area.

Fear of Crime as a Key Environmental
Determinant of Mental Health
FOC is a complex construct used to explain a range of both
psychological and social reactions to perceived threats of
crime and/or victimization. Adding to this complexity is the
fact that FOC can be measured in many ways (Hale, 1996;
Pain, 2001). When asking participants about their FOC,
some studies (for instance) distinguish between the cogni-
tive assessment of the risk of being victimized and the
affective state of fear (e.g., Cossman & Rader, 2011; Killias,
1990). Moreover, some studies use a binary forced choice,
while others allow participants to rank their fear on a con-
tinuum. In addition, respondents may be asked about fear of
crime in general, about one or more specific crimes (e.g.,
mugging), and/or in one or more specific circumstances
(e.g., while walking alone at night). It is possible for any of
these methodological differences to have a profound impact
on the results that are obtained. Despite these differences,
the vast majority of studies find that FOC is unrelated to
actual rates of victimization (Hale, 1996). This is because
perceptions are what drive the FOC, rather than objective
measures of risk (Brunton-Smith, 2011; Brunton-Smith,
Jackson, & Sutherland, 2014). It is logical to include in this
discussion that the constant exposure to constructions of
the criminal Other and finding people who match those
depictions within their neighborhood can also manipulate
this subjective sense of risk. Thus, it is not surprising to
find that substantial literature exists which demonstrates
that marginalization, particularly marginalization based on
race, and FOC are linked (Greer, 2007; Larson, 2006;
Miller, Like, & Levin, 2006). A relationship between FOC
and the racial composition of place has been widely
assumed in social science literature (Chiricos, McEntire, &
Gertz, 2001), as studies have shown that the presence of
minority groups in a neighborhood affects fear levels far
more than actual crime statistics (Chiricos, Hogan, & Gertz,
1997; Liska, Lawrence, & Sanchirico, 1982; Rader, May, &
Goodrum, 2007; Skogan, 1995).
Factors affecting social disorder may also play a role in
the production of fear and perceived risk. Incivilities, or
physical signs of social disorder such as litter, graffiti, and
abandoned buildings, have been shown to correlate with
local FOC (Covington & Taylor, 1991; R. B. Taylor &
Covington, 1993; Sampson & Raudenbush, 2004). This vari-
able, however, is inextricably tied to race. Neighborhoods
with a vast majority of ethnic minorities tend to have high
unemployment rates and tend to receive less investment in
their maintenance from civic and governmental bodies.
In addition, incivilities may be closely tied to another
form of social capital referred to as collective efficacy.
Sampson et al. (1997) broadly define collective efficacy as
the ability of ". . . neighborhoods to realize the common val-
ues of residents and maintain effective social controls"
(p. 919). In general, people with stronger ties to their neigh-
bors and neighborhood experience less FOC (Aneshensel &
Sucoff, 1996; Chaix et al., 2006; Ferraro & LaGrange, 1987;
Latkin & Curry, 2003; Robinson & Keithley, 2000; Ross &
Mirowsky, 2001; Stockdale et al., 2007; Wandersman &
Nation, 1998; Warr, 2000; White, Kasl, Zahner, & Will,
1987). Much of this same research has shown that people
living in neighborhoods with less collective efficacy and
higher crime rates have a higher prevalence of many nega-
tive measures of mental health, including depression, anxi-
ety, substance abuse, and psychoses, as well as general
psychological distress. These relationships hold true even
when controlling for other neighborhood characteristics such
as economic context. Unfortunately, one of the key factors
analyzed in many studies of the relationship between FOC
and a persons'mental health is often estimates of the reported
local crime rate--likely because statistics such as uniform
crime reports are relatively easy to obtain across large geo-
graphical areas. There may be several problems with this
approach. First, there are methodological issues, such as
under reporting crime due to incomplete reports on the part
of officers and individuals who often do not report crimes
committed against them. Second, there are conceptual prob-
lems with measuring "real" victimization risk. The approach
to victimization risk inherently assumes that FOC and vic-
timization are the product of a rational and largely accurate
assessment of relative risk. Large amounts of data, however,
show this is not the case particularly for older persons.
Variation in self-reported levels of FOC generally do not
reflect local crime rates, particularly when individual-level
factors such as social class are controlled for (DuBow,
McCabe, & Kaplin, 1979; Taylor & Hale, 1986; Taylor &
Shumaker, 1990). Research has shown that levels of FOC are
in fact inversely related to real-world estimates of victimiza-
tion risk (Akers, La Greca, Sellers, & Cochran, 1987;
Covington & Taylor 1991; Lebowitz, 1975;Yin, 1980, 1985).
This phenomenon, often referred to as the paradox of fear,
has been the subject of much research. Although the cause
for this paradox is beyond the scope of this article, its exis-
tence establishes that FOC can affect the lives (and health) of
individuals, despite the fact that most people have low vic-
timization risk, such as older individuals.
Research has also shown that a person's perceived risk of
victimization and his or her subsequent FOC may be related
to his or her physical strength and perceived ability to defend
oneself, and his or her socio-economic status, size of social
networks, and feelings of control (Hale, 1996; Mawby, 2004;
Powell & Wahidin, 2008; Stafford, Chandola, & Marmot,
2007; Stiles, Halim, & Kaplan, 2003). This perceived vulner-
ability tends to have the greatest effect on older people and
women. Women in general have higher rates of fear then men
but have less risk of victimization then men (Hilinski,
Kindsey, Pentecost, & Andrews, 2011). According to Hilinski
et al. (2011), much of the fear that women experience relates
to sexual aggression, and women are 10 times more likely to
be sexually assaulted than men (Reid & Konrad, 2004).
However, older persons in particular have disproportionately
high FOC relative to their risk of victimization (De Donder,
Collins and Marrone 3
Verte, & Messelis, 2005; Killias & Clerici, 2000; Oh & Kim,
2009; Scarborough, Like-Haislip, Novak, Lucas, & Alarid,
2010; Quann & Hung, 2002; Wittebrood, 2002; Yin, 1985),
particularly in large cities (Lee, 2007), as crime is often asso-
ciated with the rise of cities. This is not a surprising result
given that almost every key socio-demographic feature
known to be associated with higher levels of FOC is also a
feature that increases in prevalence with age. Moreover, these
individual-level variables and other known neighborhood-
level variables often interact in synergistic ways to amplify
FOC in older people. For example, older neighborhood resi-
dents are more likely to live in neighborhoods experiencing
rapid turnover, as one generation vacates nearby properties
due to mortality or movement to assisted living arrangements,
while younger residents replace them (see Taylor &
Covington, 1988). This heterogeneity and high turnover both
inhibit the formation of social networks and amplify FOC.
Although the relationship between age and FOC is con-
tested (e.g., Ditton, Bannister, Gilchrist, & Farrall, 1999;
Kury, Obergfell-Fuchs, & Ferdinand, 2001), the need to
understand FOC in older populations remains important
even if they are not disproportionately afraid. One reason for
this need is the fact that pre-existing health conditions can
drive FOC. Although there is evidence to support the direc-
tion of causation (e.g., Stafford et al., 2007), a more complex
feedback model has been proposed (e.g., Jackson & Stafford,
2009). That is, although poorer health may increase FOC due
to perceived vulnerability, FOC may also act to subsequently
promote changes in both physiology and lifestyle that further
deteriorate health. This review will focus on the plausible
mechanisms by which FOC is coupled with mental health in
older individuals, both directly and through physical activity
and social interaction (see Figure 1).
Mechanisms for FOC to Alter Life Span
Brain Development
Exercise
Physical activity is a very potent modulator of both physical
and mental health (Nocon et al., 2008; Tanasescu et al., 2002;
Warburton, Nicol, & Bredin, 2006). A large body of evidence
suggests that older adults are more likely to engage in physi-
cal activity if they perceive their neighborhoods to be safe

(Booth et al., 2000; Brownson, Baker, Housemann, Brennan,
& Bacak, 2001; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
[CDC], 1999; Stafford, Marmot, Eley, Stansfeld, & Marmot,
2006; Van Cauwenberg et al., 2013). However, research has
also shown that FOC is associated with sedentary behavior
including reduced outdoor activities (Ross, 1993) and
increased car use (Lauer, 2005). More importantly, physical
activity in older adults is consistently linked with improved
mental health across multiple measures, including decreased
prevalence of depressive symptoms (Emery, Schein, Hauck,
& MacIntyre, 1998; Penninx et al., 1998), improved cogni-
tive functioning (Chang, Pan, Chen, Tsai, & Huang, 2012;
Hindin & Zelinski, 2012; Tseng, Gau, & Lou, 2011), and
decreased risk of dementia (Flicker, 2010; Lee et al., 2010).
The link between mental health outcomes and physical
activity is complex and bi-directional, and several non-
exclusive mechanisms have been proposed to mediate the
relationship (Erickson, Gildengers, & Butters, 2013;
Mattson, 2012). Many studies support the argument that
exercise has anti-depressant effects in older adults, yet the
mechanism of action remains unclear. Many psychosocial
factors are implicated, including increased social contact
from participation in group exercises (Cooney et al., 2013;
discussed further below). Other non-mechanistic factors
have been suggested as well, such as increased self-efficacy
and enhanced self-concept as a result of exercise interven-
tions (Erickson et al., 2013). Consistent with the feedback
model of Jackson and Stafford (2009), the above factors
also decrease FOC and provide another example in a very
complex feedback cycle in which there are many opportu-
nities for bi-directional interaction between FOC and health
via exercise.
There are also clear biological mechanisms for exercise's
effects on mental health that cannot be accounted for by psy-
chosocial factors, in part because they also occur in multiple
mammal species with prolonged exercise. These mecha-
nisms include enhancement in both volume and functional
connectivity of brain circuits involved in mood and memory
function, such as the prefrontal cortex and medial temporal
lobe (Vivar, Potter, & van Praag, 2013). Exercise also exerts
effects on a wide range of brain systems in many species,
including the biological stress response, a vascular perfusion
of many brain regions (Black et al., 1990; Kerr, Steuer,
Pochtarev, & Swain, 2010), neuromodulator systems that are
known to affect both cognition and mood (Chen et al., 2008;
Ransford, 1982), and the production of protective trophic
factors (Rothman & Mattson, 2013).
In addition to the direct influences, exercise also exerts
protective effects on many age-related physical ailments that
affect mental health. This is particularly well established in
the case of exercise's ability to reduce the risk of cardiovas-
cular diseases (e.g., Dunn et al., 1999; Fried et al., 1998),
which in turn are major risk factors for cognitive decline and
dementia. Higher levels of physical activity are also associ-
ated with a reduction of falls (DeSure, Peterson, Gianan, &
Pang, 2013; Faber, Bosscher, Chin, Paw, & van Wieringen,
2006; Hausdorff, Rios, & Edelberg, 2001; Tinetti, Doucette,
Claus, & Marottoli, 1995), which are a major contributor to
injury among older adults. The moderation of injury risk is
relevant here because of the feedback model of FOC, which
states that pre-existing health problems increase a person's
sense of vulnerability, thus amplifying FOC, which further
curtails physical activity. Although a full discussion of the
potential for these factors to affect life span development is
beyond the scope of this review, the above description is suf-
ficient to illustrate that the biological and psychosocial fac-
tors provide powerful mediators of successful brain aging
and mental health that both affect and are affected by FOC.
An equally complex dynamic emerges when examining
another behavior pattern associated with both FOC and suc-
cessful aging--the maintenance of social networks.
Social Activities and the Maintenance of Social
Contact
The effects of social support and isolation on mental health
have long been recognized (Heaney & Israel, 2002; Kawachi
& Berkman, 2001). In the context of older adults, increased
engagement in social activities and larger social networks
has been associated with decreased risk of cognitive decline
and dementia (Bassuk, Glass, & Berkman, 1999; Fratiglioni,
Wang, Ericsson, Maytan, & Winblad, 2000; Saczynski et al.,
2006; Wang, Xu, & Pei, 2012; Williams, Plassman, Burke,
& Benjamin, 2010) and depression (Aenchbacher et al.,
1991; Dean, Kolody, & Wood, 1990; Glass, De Leon,
Bassuk, & Berkman, 2006; Oxman, Berkman, Freeman, &
Barrett, 1992; Oxman & Hull, 1997). Faris and Dunham
(1939) were among the first to link mental health to neigh-
borhood factors. Social integration played a prominent role
in their work, as it was argued that neighborhoods high in
"social disorganization" promoted social isolation, which in
turn negatively affected mental health outcomes. This semi-
nal finding has given rise to a wealth of literature on the
social stress model, which is arguably the dominant analytic
model for the social determinants of health (Silver, Mulvey,
& Swanson, 2002). The model points to at least two distinct
mechanisms by which FOC may play a critical role in medi-
ating the relationship between social integration and health.
The reduction in social contact associated with higher FOC
may affect (and be affected by) health directly. In addition,
reduced social integration may negatively affect the ability
of social networks to buffer chronic stressors that include
stress about FOC. Skogan and Maxfield (1981) recognized
the impact of negative behavioral changes such as avoid-
ance behaviors and their impact on social life. It was found
that people who avoided certain places or did not ride public
transit due to FOC (Box, Hale, & Andrews, 1988) also had
smaller social networks and had less engagement in social
activities (Geis & Ross, 1998; Pain, 2000; Ross, 1993;
Stafford et al., 2007).
Collins and Marrone 5
Consistent with the feedback model (e.g., Jackson &
Stafford, 2009), there is evidence that the relationship
between FOC and social isolation is bi-directional. For
instance, FOC is affected by many factors, including per-
ceived vulnerability. In parallel to physical vulnerability,
FOC is equally affected by perceptions of social vulnerabil-
ity derived from lack of access to support networks. That is,
although physical vulnerability potentiates fear through a
person's perceived lack of ability to defend himself or her-
self, social vulnerability does so through perceived inability
to recruit others to aid in his or her defense. In fact,
social vulnerability has been argued as an explanation for
neighborhood-level variation in fear, as neighborhoods with
closer social ties between neighbors report lower FOC, per-
haps because they perceive each another as more likely to
come to their aid (Covington & Taylor, 1991; Franklin,
Franklin, & Fearn, 2008; Oh & Kim, 2009), particularly in
older adults (De Donder, De Witte, Buffel, Dury, & Verté,
2012; Lebowitz, 1975; Sundeen & Mathieu, 1976). In this
context, social ties have been almost exclusively studied at
the neighborhood level. To the authors' knowledge, no study
to date has clearly examined the individual impact of intra-
versus extra-neighborhood social ties on FOC and health.
This is unfortunate, given that older adults are more likely to
utilize extended social supports from friends and family for
informal health care and financial aid (Penning, 1995; Van
Houtven & Norton, 2004).
Although no scholar can dispute the wealth of data show-
ing neighborhood-level ties in mediating FOC, the extended
informal care network of older individuals may suggest that
extra-neighborhood social ties will also have great impact on
perceived vulnerability and subsequently on FOC in older
adults. Among older adults with chronic health problems,
these social supports may be as important as neighborhood-
level ties in determining fear levels. Further investigation is
clearly needed in this area.
In addition to the direct effects of social isolation and
mental health mentioned above, a great deal of evidence
shows that social networks have positive effects on mental
health by acting as stress mediators (Aneshensel 1992;
Kawachi & Berkman, 2001; Wenzel, Glanz, & Lerman,
2002). This research focuses on the amount of available
functional social support (often referred to as social capital)
at both individual and neighborhood levels. The research
consistently shows that support systems can provide a stress-
buffering mechanism and, as a result, reduce biological
markers of chronic stress and associated disease. Although
chronic stress may originate from a wide array of sources,
one potential stressor is FOC. These stressors can have direct
physiological and behavioral consequences for health. It has
been proposed that chronic exposure to threat (whether per-
ceived or actual) stimulates physiological responses that
over long periods can compromise the function of both the
nervous and immune systems (Lupien, Maheu, Tu, Fiocco,
& Schramek, 2007; Ross & Mirowsky, 2001) and may make
the brain more vulnerable to subsequent insults (Russell,
Zigmond, Dimatelis, Daniels, & Mabandla, 2014). Moreover,
chronic stress increases the likelihood of other health-
deteriorating activities such as heavy drinking (Hill & Angel,
2005) and may also decrease the health-promoting effects of
exercise (Howells, Russell, Mabandla, & Kellaway, 2005).
Finally, evidence suggests that older adults may be particu-
larly susceptible to the effects of chronic stress, as aging is
associated with a more pronounced physiological stress
response to the same stressor (Lupien et al., 2007; Sindi,
Fiocco, Juster, Pruessner, & Lupien, 2013).
Conclusion
It is clear that FOC affects mental health at a population
level. Moreover, FOC shows complex reciprocal relation-
ships with both mental health and health-promoting behav-
ior. Many of these factors are independently associated with
age. These factors conspire to put older adults at greater risk
of being negatively affected by FOC and its determinants.
Therefore, FOC should be a public health focus as a potential
community-level mediator of mental health and well-being,
particularly those focused on compression of morbidity in
older adults.
However, one point bears mentioning. Although it is clear
that the FOC exhibited by older individuals is disproportion-
ate to their victimization risk, the question of whether they
are in fact more fearful than their younger counterparts
remains debated. The fact that this question has been the
focus of such a large proportion of the research is unfortunate
in the opinion of the authors. This question is not the most
productive one to ask. This is because it can provide limited
insight beyond showing that FOC is linked to factors in the
social and physical environment rather than true victimiza-
tion risk, and by extension that reduction of actual crime
rates is not sufficient to reduce the FOC and its subsequent
effect on mental health. Rather, it would be more impactful
to clarify the relationships between physical and mental
health, the social environment, and FOC, as these are likely
to change with age. A wide array of unique physical and
mental health concerns emerge during the third and fourth
ages of life, and it is reasonable to hypothesize that their rela-
tionship to the physical and social environment of an indi-
vidual is similarly evolving over time. Understanding how
they are affected by (and in turn affect) FOC over the life
span can provide unique opportunities to promote health and
prevent disease. Indeed, data show that changes made at a
neighborhood level can reduce FOC. In a recent systematic
review, Lorenc and colleagues (2013) isolated several key
features of the built environment that can modulate anxiety
about safety such as gates, street lighting, visibility and
"openness" in the environment, and physical incivilities (i.e.,
signs of neglect such as dirt, graffiti, and litter). This list pro-
vides a clear starting point for interventions aimed at reduc-
ing FOC. Moreover, evidence shows that changes to the
6 SAGE Open
physical environment can positively affect the perception of
neighborhood safety and subsequently lead residents to
increase their physical activity (Jongeneel-Grimen,
Droomers, van Oers, Stronks, & Kunst, 2014).
Although these data provide a starting point, few studies
have examined how the relationship between the physical and
social environment change with age. Instead, age is often
treated as a variable to be controlled for, and while this
approach is useful for isolating universal trends, it misses an
opportunity to target those individuals who are likely to derive
the most benefit from interventions. It is also important to note
that in planning such interventions, the synergies among the
factors being manipulated must be taken into account. For
instance, recent data show that increases in the amount of
retail space within walking distance of a resident not only
tended to increase walking but also increased FOC (Foster,
Wood, Christian, Knuiman, & Giles-Corti, 2013). The para-
dox highlights that any intervention program needs to consider
the balance between community growth and a resident's FOC.
In a similar vein, many approaches that have been used in the
past to enhance some environmental factors associated with
reduced FOC have been criticized for promoting a "bunker
mentality" that reduces social cohesion, which is also a power-
ful mediator of FOC (Cozens, Saville, & Hillier, 2005). As
such, these interventions should not be undertaken without
reservation. There remains great untapped potential, however,
in programs to curb FOC in an age-sensitive manner to
improve mental health and well-being.
