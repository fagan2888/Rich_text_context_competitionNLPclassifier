The employment of a private session, or caucus, within a
family mediation session was acknowledged by Moore
(1987) as a vehicle for the promotion and satisfactory com-
pletion of a settlement. However, its use may not be popular
with all practitioners, since according to Taylor (2002, pp.
161-166), the utilization of private sessions arises from users
of "problem-solving/negotiative" approaches to mediation
practice, whereas practitioners holding to a "systems" per-
spective often eschew its use.
In the main, discussions on the need for a private session
arises as a result of consultation between mediator(s) and
disputants, usually during sessions, but also range from
being scheduled prior to the mediation session proper, fre-
quently as part of the intake process (Swaab & Brett, 2007)
to a type of shuttle between disputants in caucus following a
preliminary joint session, when upon settlement a final joint
session is held (Calkins, 2006). Despite there being only a
small amount of published research on the nuances associ-
ated with private sessions, there are available enlightening
descriptions and reviews of caucus use. For example, Jacob
(1991) discussed the use of private sessions with postdecree
disputants where extensive caucus use was seen as beneficial
in exposing "blockages" to gain understanding of the nature
of the conflict. Significantly, most of the family mediation
models reviewed by Bowen (1999) used caucusing at least
once per session, ideally equal time being allotted to each
disputant. In addition, Parkinson (1997) observed that the
decision to include a caucus stage varies according to the
mediation model used, as a function of agency practice,
directed at the perceived needs of participants, or as a result
of mutual consultation between mediators and disputants.
Furthermore, mediators might assume that each disputant
may need to disclose or discuss their concerns in a private
session (Tillett & French, 2006) or for each client to examine
their separate positions (Rifkin, Millen, & Cobb, 1991). In
addition, Fisher and Brandon (2009) indicated that mediators
may identify concerns that might benefit from exploration,
or issues that appear to be contributing to repetitive loops, a
deadlock, or an impasse. Interestingly, Fisher and Brandon
(2009, pp. 184-187 and pp. 29-30) observed that a significant
value of caucus is in promoting negotiating equality and
positive negotiating strategies and also to allow participants
"time-out," while Taylor (2002, pp. 161-166) argued for the
employment of caucus in circumstances where disputant
safety issues are identified as a significant feature of the rela-
tionship. Although Haynes and Charlesworth (1996) saw
limited use for private sessions except where specific diffi-
culties presented, a study by Swaab and Brett (2007) con-
cluded that pre-family mediation caucuses contributed to a
reduction of interpersonal conflict. Importantly, the authors
also asserted that caucusing should be used to establish trust
between disputants and practitioners rather than to work
through "agreement issues." Bush and Folger (1994, pp.
270-271) acknowledged the value of an environment where
parties are able to raise concerns that they feel unable to in
joint session, but at the same time, the authors were critical
of sessions dedicated to the urging of disputants toward spe-
cific courses of action. The authors observed that practitio-
ners should be adept in ensuring that caucusing assists
disputants in the understanding of their own position while

A Critique of Private Sessions in
Family Mediation
Don Bowen1
Abstract
This study represents a critical examination of private sessions (caucuses), seen as a sub-process within the core family
mediation process and defined as involving separate and confidential conversations between mediator(s) and each disputant
during the main session.In the study,the views of family mediators were explored revealing that considerable support for the
use of the tool was juxtaposed with a range of fundamental ethical concerns. Emerging from the study is strong evidence of
coercive practice as an inherent component of caucusing thus posing a challenge to the positive benefits.

considering others' perspectives. Reviewing issues likely to
benefit from caucusing, Moore (1987) and later Moore
(2003, pp. 369-377) identified examples ranging from pres-
sures arising out of preexisting problems in the clients' rela-
tionship to those emerging from the session in progress or as
a result of the negotiation process. Pope (2001, p. 93) listed
several general uses for caucusing such as reflection on the
future and the importance of settlement, discussions around
alternative options for settlement, ventilation of emotions
arising from the dispute, mediator(s) acting as a "sounding
board" prior to rejoining joint session, and examination of
premature concessions or commitments. Significantly, co-
mediators may also benefit from a private session to "take
stock" of the joint session's progress, according to Fisher
and Brandon (2009, p. 238). Furthermore, an important and
difficult dimension likely to emerge in a session was identi-
fied by Saposnek (1998, pp. 126-129) and Taylor (2002, pp.
161-166) relating to situations where children are inter-
viewed separately from each other or their parents.
Views vary as to the most appropriate time to hold a caucus
meeting or under what circumstances (Taylor, 2002, pp. 161-
166). Moore (2003, pp. 370-375) suggested that practitioners
who break proceedings for a private session with one party
should time the break appropriately: not too early, particularly
where there is still the possibility of a productive settlement;
and not too late when all is virtually settled. However, an early
caucus is often indicated when it is considered that ventilation
of an issue or emotional concern might aid negotiation flow.
Despite there being no ideal time for a caucus break, the loca-
tion, duration, and order in which the disputants are "seen" are
generally subject to an agreed standard.
This study attempted to add to the relatively small amount
of published research on the efficacy of caucusing by focus-
sing on a critical review of its use in a family mediation con-
text. The views of practitioners were explored on their
rationale for using caucus and the potential for ethical con-
cerns or dilemmas likely to arise. Accordingly, the central
question addressed was "What are the special characteristics
associated with the use of caucus?" An associated question
was "Are there ethical implications inherent to caucusing?"
Method
The study was part of a larger project using mixed-method
research (Hall, 2008), which utilized two sources of qualita-
tive data collection: (a) a large 56-question questionnaire
divided into 12 topic areas, 1 being the subject of this article;
(a) several in-depth semistructured interviews.
For the questionnaire, the unit of analysis was family
mediation practitioners and the sampling, as defined by
Denscombe (1998, p. 15) and Hall (2008, pp. 194-196) was
purposive. Invitations to participate in the project were
posted to mediation agencies known to provide family medi-
ation services (Bowen, 1999). In the invitation, the project
was presented as involving a self-completion postal ques-
tionnaire (Hall, 2008, pp. 194-196) that would probe
practitioners' opinions on a range of topics associated with
family mediation practice. The 56-question questionnaire
was subdivided into 12 main topic areas (Richards, 2009, p.
101) 1 of which being the subject of this article. There were
129 assenting responses resulting in 129 serial numbered
packages being sent to agencies for distribution to willing
practitioners. Each of the packages contained a covering let-
ter introducing the researcher and the institution, an outline
of the project and its significance, appreciation of respon-
dents' cooperation in the project and assurance of confiden-
tiality, and the questionnaire (with completion instructions)
and a return envelope preaddressed to the investigator. Of the
129 packages mailed out, there were 47 completed question-
naires received by the investigator who was blind to the
identity of respondents. The response rate was therefore
36%. The 47 respondents' locations were Australia (27),
Canada (2), Puerto Rico (1), the United Kingdom (7), and
the United States (10). The topic area reported here was
titled "Use of Caucus" and consisted of two principal pre-
coded questions.
Seven Australian mediation practitioners were also
recruited as volunteer participants to participate in semis-
tructured in-depth interviews (Hall, 2008, pp. 201-204) con-
ducted by the investigator. As with the questionnaire, the
sampling was purposive, the participants being known to the
investigator through his work in family mediation and cho-
sen for their "first hand experience and knowledge," an attri-
bute which Rubin and Rubin (2005, pp.64-67) regarded as
critical to a successful investigation. Inclusionary criteria
were formal mediation training and participation in 400 or
more mediation sessions post-training. The interviewees
provided informed consent based on the cautionary elements
expressed by Padgett (1998, pp. 35-36), and agreed to be
audio recorded more than 1.5 to 2 hr. When the tapes were
transcribed, the content was subjected to a form of thematic
analysis (Grbich, 2007, pp. 16-32). A phenomenological
style of interview was used, described by Roulston (2010,
pp. 122-129) as useful in generating detailed explanation and
meaning to interviewee experiences and permitting opportu-
nities to explore special points of significance identified by
interviewer and interviewees. Participants were asked to dis-
cuss their perception of the family mediation process and
reflect on their experiences and understanding of the topic
area. Discussion allowed for clarification, exploration, and
congruent discussion of meanings and interpretations of
emergent issues, which, in the case of this article, were asso-
ciated with private meetings (caucus).
Results of the Questionnaire
This topic area ("Using Caucus") involved two precoded
questions, grouped according to response category.
In the first question, practitioners were asked whether
they used private sessions (caucus) "routinely," "some-
times," "never," or "rarely." All 47 participants answered
this question, the responses being 23 (49%) "routinely," 21
Bowen 3
(45%) "sometimes," with 3 (6%) stating they either "never"
or "rarely" used caucus. The prominent feature of these
responses was that 44 of the 47 respondents (94%) used cau-
cus "sometimes" or "routinely."
In the second question (consisting of two parts), the inten-
tion was to survey the respondents' view of the value of
caucusing.
Part 1: Do you consider that the use of the caucus is valu-
able? Of the 44 (of the 47) who responded, 18 (41%) and 24
(55%) stated that using caucus was "always" valuable or
"sometimes" valuable, respectively, with 1 respondent stat-
ing "mostly" and another stating "rarely."
Part 2: The mediators were asked whether they consid-
ered it valuable, to whom was it valuable? Of the 44 who
answered the question, 39 (89%) considered caucus was
valuable to the mediation process, 36 (82%) considered it of
value to clients, and 30 (68%) of value to the mediator(s).
The survey exposed limitations on the use of the ques-
tionnaire tool in this case. For example, problems were asso-
ciated with the rigid parameters set by the questions with
some respondents stating that they opted for the nearest to
their preferred answer.
Results of Interviews
Following transcription and thematic analysis, key inter-
viewee assertions and opinion arising from discussions and
selected dialogue were coded for like or linked responses and
grouped into thematic clusters (Roulston, 2010, pp. 122-129).
Cluster 1--Aims, Benefits, andValues of
Caucus and Caucusing
Despite some reservations, there was consensus among
interviewees on the benefits caucus could offer disputants,
such as to allow them to express their views without fear of
interference or intimidation from the other disputant, enable
a client to ventilate emotions in a safe environment, or
"rehearse" for a return to joint session. In addition, there was
agreement among interviewees that a major aim of caucus-
ing was to gather information with a view to facilitating the
management of difference or tension between disputants in
joint session. Moreover, some interviewees observed that a
topic discussed in private session often assumes a different
meaning or connotation in joint session. An amalgam of sug-
gestions as to the aims of caucus use included (a) to explore
"real" differences between disputants, and how they are to
be managed; (b) how disputants felt about each other; (c)
how they regarded discussion of their concerns in joint ses-
sion; and (d) what has been the reaction to those same con-
cerns prior to attending mediation. Some mediators added
that they utilize caucus to discover what compromises par-
ties are prepared to make in agreement setting. In responding
to questions about the value of caucusing, three interviewees
asserted that they might be unable to facilitate moves toward
resolution of issues if they could not equate what transpired
in the joint session with discussion in private sessions. For
example, one person stated that
if you hear similar stories and they appear consistent
in both cases, then you have a good idea that whatever
is resolved, is going to be valid. If you have a person
presenting differently than in joint session, then you
have to pursue a different approach.
Responding to questions from the interviewer on the role
of the practitioner, without exception all interviewees
acknowledged the central role of "controlling the process."
Cluster 2--When to Introduce a Caucus
Session and forWhat Length ofTime?
Interviewees stated repeatedly that they offered parties equal
time in caucus sessions, regardless of the discussion sub-
stance. Two people described how and when private sessions
were used in their model, with one person noting that a
"small" caucus lasting about 10 min was usually introduced
15 to 20 min into the session, whereas the other interviewee
stated that if the decision was made to use a caucus break,
she would do so about 30 min into session. Referring to the
length of private sessions, an interviewee said that typically,
about 15 min per person was offered once, sometime during
a session. On the other hand, another person reported that in
her agency, caucus was made available whenever needed.
She said that if there was seen to be a power imbalance, for
example, it might be appropriate to explore individual views
on what disputants had tried previously. A mediator stated
that he asks participants whether they would like a "break"
or "to caucus." He would suggest a caucus where there was
an impasse in the proceedings or any suggestion of abusive
behavior in the relationship that might be "notifiable under
law," for example, child abuse. Another interviewee agreed
and added that the model she used usually had a private ses-
sion, sometimes two, during the assessment stage: "For
instance, if we decided not to go ahead with mediation, fur-
ther down the track we would be inclined to have another
private session to check how each person is going to handle
this." Also in her model, an aim might be to find out what
the disputants really wanted: "If we think counseling is a
better option, be it separate or couple counseling, one person
might say, `maybe we'll be better off seeking counseling.'
Under these circumstances, you would need to hold a private
session with the other party." Answering the question of
when and where he would use caucus, an interviewed
mediator responded thus:
I have used caucus in the beginning, in the middle, and
at the end. The reasons were: in the beginning you use
it in order to establish a reason for "shock remediation";
in the middle you might use it if there is expression of
4 SAGE Open
extreme emotion, or a "disposition" that needs to be
clarified and perhaps confronted.
He explained that
you can't really have people crying and the other party
exploiting the situation, or also becoming upset. If you
discover that the person is experiencing difficulties in
accepting the system that you are using and maybe
questioning it or the validity of the process, you have
to suggest a caucus session. It often means that one
has to start from the beginning and ask what's bother-
ing them and why they feel the way they do "please
tell us because we need to understand it." A caucus
towards the end might be utilized in order to test the
validity of what has been resolved or to discover how
disputants feel about the session's content.
Another interviewee elaborated on the occasions for the
use of caucus, noting that most often mediator(s) agree it is
time for a session, although there is often conflict between
practitioners as to the appropriateness of temporarily stop-
ping the joint session at a particular spot, and holding sepa-
rate sessions with the clients. When asked how she would
manage conflict, she stated that if she wanted to delay the
caucus, or needed to ask another question of the client(s), she
would press ahead and delay caucus until she considered a
more appropriate time! There was consensus among inter-
viewees regarding additional situations likely to precipitate
caucusing, including (a) a history of inadequate communica-
tion where one party habitually acquiesces to the other, or (b)
a superficial level of communication where continuance of
the relationship requires agreement at all costs. In private
session, the other partner being absent might upset the
arrangement thus allowing for concerns or fears to be
verbalized.
Cluster 3--Empowering Mechanisms
AssociatedWith Caucus
One interviewee was circumspect in describing her use of
caucus; nevertheless, she emphasized the importance of the
caucus tool as being one of empowerment for participants
who are then in a strong position in caucus to review aspects
of their status. Yet another person also alluded to empower-
ment as a recurrent theme, stressing the usefulness of private
sessions when an impasse has occurred:
It is a very powerful strategy if we are "stuck," or if
something happens which is inflammatory, or we've
nowhere else to go but separate the disputants . . .
we're in a better position to say I don't understand
what's happening or what's going on, or it seems
we're stuck . . . what's your view . . . So, it gives us a
chance to check things out with people without doing
so in joint session where they may not tell you what
was going on without losing face. (emphasis added).
By adding the "loss of face" aspect, she underlined the
way caucusing enhanced disputant empowerment. Similarly,
she reassured the disputant of her impartiality: "That's where
engagement (with clients [emphasis added]) comes in . . .
being able to proceed in a way that the person isn't going to
feel you're not on their side or that you're advocating for the
other person." She stressed the value of caucus to elicit sig-
nificant information: "Since you don't know what's happen-
ing with people until you ask them, it becomes a problem
when they are reluctant to reveal much in joint session."
Another interviewee's comment was similar when referring
to the case of a couple who appeared to have settled the dis-
pute and had merely come to mediation to have it written
out! However, he and his co-mediator decided to continue
with the mediation protocol anyway. It transpired that there
were underlying issues that had not been addressed. It was in
caucus that these were identified. His views were consistent
with those of the other six interviewees with regard to the
empowering effects of caucusing. Emphasizing its role in
reassuring clients, he asserted that if used carefully, caucus
had considerable ability to empower and afford the practitio-
ner the opportunity to demonstrate their neutrality and
impartiality. In addition, another interviewee added that by
asking whether disputants would like to take a particular
path or even a different approach was facilitating some sense
of empowerment for disputants.
Cluster 4--Disadvantages in the Use of
Caucus
Although mediators interviewed were, in varying degrees,
supportive of the use of caucus, some saw cause for concern
with its use. The concerns ranged from some negative
aspects in specific circumstances through to significant con-
cerns, prompting references to it being tantamount to uneth-
ical practice. One interviewee thought there were few
negative aspects to using caucus and because it was enabling
an ultimate agreement then, "the end might be said to justify
the means." Conversely another interviewee was somewhat
uncomfortable with the use of private sessions, having been
initially trained in a model that used them only if considered
necessary. She was critical of its use from the perspective of
its potential for eroding the trust between mediators and
disputants:
I think that if you're encouraging parties to speak
openly and honestly with each other, by separating
them and then offering disputants opportunity to talk
privately with me because there may be things you
don't want to say in front of the other person, you're
actually creating an element of distrust. It can be seen
by the other party as quite destructive, and they might
Bowen 5
think "well, here am I being open and honest and I've
been asked by the mediator to be so, while at the same
time the mediator's saying, you don't have to be open
and honest really, because you can tell me whatever
you like, and it will stay confidential." So there's
something in the whole process of private sessions that
might break down that element of trust that you're
hoping to build up.
Two interviewees acknowledged the positive aspects of
caucusing but were also forthright on the negative perspec-
tives, one person suggesting that the whole idea of caucusing
was unethical and "smacked" of unprofessional practice, a
view echoed by the other interviewee with particular con-
cerns, who considered its use as a violation of the spirit of
mediation where "everyone worked in concert aiming for a
resolution to the dispute." Another interviewed participant
also had reservations on the use of caucus, stating that it was
"underhand to some extent and possibly contrary to basic
tenets of mediation." One interviewee added that the whole
idea was that everyone works toward a resolution "in the
same room . . . and in an `open manner.'" Significantly,
another interviewee saw disadvantages that particularly
related to the feelings of the party not in the private session,
thus creating the possibility of erosion of trust: "I think it can
contribute to suspicions being raised such as, `what are they
going to say when I'm out there.'" She also voiced concern
about unilateral decisions to enter "caucus" (i.e., by one
mediator): or held at the wrong time. She said that
an example might be if one mediator suddenly say's
"oh look, I think we'll have a private session now" and
hasn't checked with the co-mediator who might feel
the session is just getting somewhere. Sometimes we
don't say we are going to have a private session, we
promptly call a break!
When pressed by the interviewer as to why, having such
negative views, interviewees continued to use private ses-
sions, typical responses ranged from it being part of the
agency model through to stating that in most (not all) situa-
tions, the positive aspects outweighed the negative ones!
Cluster 5--Confidentiality During Caucus
Sessions
All interviewees asserted that discretion and confidentiality
are central to the spirit and ethos of mediation practice. This
was an important aspect of the interviews because (a) confi-
dentiality of proceedings is a criterion for successful, ethical
family mediation; (b) most codes of ethics of professional
bodies emphasize confidentiality. While all interviewees
acknowledged the central importance of neutrality and
impartiality to the caucus milieu, questions about client
empowerment and preservation of confidentiality during
and after sessions garnered some specific observations. For
example, two people interviewed noted that there was no
control on out-of-session disclosure of confidential material
from either joint or separate sessions, confidentiality being
limited by the desire of all participants to preserve it.
Another interviewee observed that after a private session
and upon resumption of joint session, it might be beneficial
for disputants to disclose those key aspects of the caucus,
which may be of assistance in the formation of settlement.
In contrast, a particular interviewee emphasized that in her
model, breaking of private session confidences was not tol-
erated, with the exception of statutory notification of child
abuse. Another person also cited statutory obligations,
affirming her strong belief in the value of confidentiality
thus explaining her reluctance to use the caucus tool, hold-
ing that its use should be discretionary. She said that
those who favor private sessions will say that there
may be many people (disputants [emphasis added]) in
mediation who feel quite intimidated by the other
party who, despite being encouraged to be as open and
honest as possible, don't feel they can be so because
of: a troubled "history," feeling too nervous, not being
at their "best," or the other party being constantly
dominant.
She continued by observing that "there may be a number
of reasons why in a private session, one party opens up in a
way that they haven't been able to in a joint session." She
said that
no matter how skilled a mediator is, if there is a behav-
ioral aspect present, recent "history" between the par-
ties, or simply a concern for the future, some parties
feel that they cannot "disclose" in a joint session with
their former partner present, a private session may
then be beneficial.
However, she said that she left the option open ended, by
contrast to those who applied subtle pressure to include cau-
cus: "There are some mediators who will say that we can
have a private session if you wish; or one party might request
one."
Discussion and Conclusion
Responses to the questionnaire demonstrate that most
respondents used caucus and that they regarded it as valu-
able to the mediators, the clients, and also to the mediation
process. Results from the interviews indicated that despite
some strong reservations, there was mainly agreement that
adroit use of private sessions enables mediator(s) to perform
supportive functions such as exploration of disputants' con-
cerns; in this, the results were sympathetic to existing litera-
ture, such as discussed by Pope (2001). Private sessions
6 SAGE Open
were seen to create a "safe" environment which was defined
as a discussion forum without interference from their co-
disputant, possible "loss of face," or an erosion of the nego-
tiation phase as is possible in joint session. Interviewees
indicated that any concerns disputants may hold about the
confidential nature of caucus are to a large degree contingent
on adequate explanation to them by mediators, about its use
and the reasons why it may be used. Concern surrounding
preservation of confidentially was identified by some media-
tors as in need of cautious treatment. A private session may
be at the behest of one or all of the participants in a session.
Some mediators who participated in this study used caucus-
ing to consider strategies to influence the course of the ses-
sion, to learn what compromises parties were prepared to
make in the process of agreement setting, or to better under-
stand an individual disputant's perspective. It emerged from
the study that private sessions enable examination and
exploration of concerns surrounding, for example, future
care of children which may be seen by a disputant to be more
appropriately aired privately before revealing options in
joint session. The absence of a dominating partner allows the
party in caucus to be heard by a mediator without pressure
from the other party to precipitate a decision or agreement
under duress. Important additional benefits to be derived
from caucus include improvement in the negotiation pro-
cess, often by the relief of tension between clients and the
prevention of premature concessions, and using it as a
"sounding board" to check out what the parties are willing
to agree to in the journey to a fair and just outcome.
Modeling of skills such as active listening by practitioners is
also likely to be noted by disputants. Although there are
occasions where disputants may call for a private conference
break, the mediator(s) in "controlling" the process are the
most likely of the participants to actually do so. It is impor-
tant to recognize the point behind caucusing in this context.
The evidence from this study and the literature suggests that
caucusing is focused to a large extent on the pursuit of jus-
tice for disputants, with justice being seen as a central tenet
of mediation. Importantly, caucus can be exploited by a
party to reassess their position, even though sometimes as a
prelude to undermining session progress. More positively,
they may use it to evaluate the way the session is proceeding
for their co-disputant, or to consider ways of establishing a
more conciliatory approach to issues. A constructive aspect
of caucus is that its skilful use by practitioners aids the
facilitation of empowerment. This is accomplished by
allowing each party to clarify their goals and desired out-
comes, reinforce their position, and explore options and
feasibility of implementation through reality testing, without
exposure to possible intimidation from the other party.
In addressing the associated research question, a range of
questions emerged from the study relating to the use of cau-
cusing. Not least of these is in fact connected with empower-
ment of disputants. If the aim of caucus sessions is to provide
a safe and informal avenue for ventilation of concerns, or
disclosure of sensitive material, and because the disputants
belong to an informal system, how does it affect the other
party? This might explain the reluctance of mediators from a
"systems" perspective embracing the tool (Taylor, 2002, pp.
161-166). Is there a possibility that empowerment of one
party may be at the expense of the other? How can mediators
be certain that by seeing both parties separately in a non-
threatening (safe) environment where the discussion is con-
fidential, the parties will be empowered as an automatic
result of caucusing? In addition, some ethical concerns sur-
faced from the study. For example, there may be a form of
coercion involved if caucusing is either used routinely or
even suggested to clients, however, gently. Furthermore,
such coercion may be instrumental in the erosion of trust
engendered during or prior to the engagement phase of the
process. This might compound the coercive effects from
subtle pressure applied to a disputing party such as suggest-
ing that it might be in their best interests to negotiate a settle-
ment rather than pursue a particular path. It is worthwhile
pondering on the possibility that coercive processes might be
initiated involuntarily prior to a session being planned,
because pressure is on both parties to attend mediation to
avoid the risk of "losing out." Coercive practice is thus likely
to continue throughout the whole session with caucusing
playing a significant part, particularly where mediators initi-
ate one or more breaks during a session. Indeed, it is equally
plausible to argue that mediators interrupting sessions to
caucus is redolent of disarray or dissent when viewed from
the disputant position, or even a level of disrespect for the
spirit of the process. In the interviews, confidentiality fea-
tured strongly difficult since it relies on all participants pre-
serving it. Conversely, it may be argued that caucusing
allows for the modeling of dynamic resolution procedures.
This then begs the question "Is mediation even applicable in
cases where private sessions are considered necessary?"
Perhaps counseling is more appropriate. A significant aspect
of private sessions is that since family mediation is regarded
as an open and honest negotiation process where issues of
conflict are mutually aired and ideally, resolved, private ses-
sions may well be seen as the antithesis of conciliation or
reconciliation.
Addressing the basic questions set for this study, the con-
clusions are encapsulated by stating that caucus includes fea-
tures that are crucial to the ethos of family mediation with
impressive support from respondents and interviewees. In
the pursuit of justice for clients, there is a constant focus on
the clients' potential autonomy. Caucus helps create a situa-
tion in which autonomy is recognized, facilitating disputants'
arrival at a firmly and fairly negotiated agreement with cli-
ents being encouraged in independent decision making.
Caucusing at best allows for free autonomous expression in
a safe environment and as a mediator of equity in social jus-
tice terms. At worst, it is an opportunity for the erosion of
trust and is the antithesis of empowerment and a perpetrator
of unethical practice, with its extended use appearing

to create a series of ethical dilemmas. Family mediation is
concerned with the pursuance of informed, joint decision
making; accordingly, it behooves practitioners to be aware of
the potential for negative unethical effects associated with
private sessions.
