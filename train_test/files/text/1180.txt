Objective To investigate the effect of quantity and quality of early child care on children's
risk for unintentional injury. Methods A diverse cohort of 1,225 children was recruited
from several sites in the United States and followed from birth until first grade. Quantity and
quality of child care from birth until entry into kindergarten were used to predict unintentional
injuries from age 6 months until first grade. Measures from an evaluation at 6 months of age
were tested as covariates. Results Children who spent more time in nonparental childcare
environments were at slightly reduced risk for unintentional injury after controlling for child
(gender, temperament), family [socioeconomic status (SES)], parent (positive parenting), and
child care (quality of care) characteristics. Conclusions We discuss possible explanations
for the results, including the possibilities that childcare center environments are safer than the
homes of most preschoolers or that attendance in child care is nonrandom.

Nearly 65% of 3- through 5-year-old American chil-
dren--just under 8 million youngsters--spends their
weekdays in childcare settings outside the home
(Cohen, 2001). Recent efforts have documented a range
of both positive and negative behavioral and mental
health outcomes for children who spend significant por-
tions of their early development in a childcare setting
(e.g., Belsky, 2001; Lamb, 1998; NICHD Early Child
Care Research Network, 1998, 2000, 2001, 2002,
2003). Surprisingly, only a limited amount of empirical
research has considered the effect of child care on chil-
dren's risk for the leading cause of mortality among pre-
school-aged children, unintentional injuries.
Unintentional injuries kill more American children,
ages 1­4, than the next several leading causes of death
combined (National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS)
Vital Statistics System, 2001; National Safety Council,
2001) and have been described by many authorities as a
national health care priority (e.g., National Center for
Injury Prevention and Control, 2002; Sleet & Bryn,
2003). Psychological and epidemiological research have
identified many risk factors for injury among preschool-
ers--among the strongest predictors are male gender,
impulsive or undercontrolled temperament, and inade-
quate parenting or supervision (e.g., Brehaut, Miller,
Raina, & McGrail, 2002; Morrongiello, 1997; Morrong-
iello, in press; Schwebel & Barton, in press; Schwebel &
Plumert, 1999; see Matheny, 1988; Wazana, 1997; for
reviews)--but just a few empirical studies have com-
pared injury risk in young children attending child care
versus those cared for at home. Results of those studies
were mixed. Most compared risk to children in child
care during the hours they were at childcare centers ver-
sus risk to children not attending child care during the
hours they were at home. In the earliest, such research,
Rivara and colleagues found injury risk was lower for
children ages 5 and under in childcare centers than it
was for their counterparts cared for at home (Rivara,
DiGuiseppi, Thompson, & Calonge, 1989). More recent
reports replicated this finding for minor injuries among

Child Care and Injury 185
children under age 5 (Kotch et al., 1997) and for chil-
dren ages 6 months to 2 years (Kopjar & Wickizer,
1996), but found similar injury rates when more severe
injuries (Kotch et al., 1997) or children ages 3­6 (Kop-
jar & Wickizer, 1996) were considered. Injury risk to
children in family day care settings rather than childcare
centers has been examined in one empirical study
(Kotch et al., 1997). The results indicated greatly
reduced risk for children in family day care settings, but
the study's authors expressed concern about sampling
biases and recommended caution in interpreting results.
Just one study compared overall risk of injury--that
is, injury risk regardless of where the injury occurred--
in children who attend child care compared to children
who do not attend child care (Gunn, Pinsky, Sacks, &
Schonberger, 1991). In that study, random-digit tele-
phone dialing was used to sample 1,775 households with
children under age 5. As in other work, risk of injury for
children attending child care during the time at child
care was lower than that of children not attending child
care during the time at home. However, children who
attended child care had a slightly higher overall risk for
injury than did children who did not attend child care.
Because children who attended child care had a higher
risk of injury during the time they were at home than did
children who did not attend child care, the overall risk
for injury was actually higher among those children who
attended child care (Gunn et al., 1991).
Together, available evidence tentatively indicates
that childcare attendance might decrease children's risk
for injury while in child care but increase children's
overall risk for injury. Several questions remain unan-
swered. First, excepting the study by Gunn and col-
leagues, there is little information on overall risk for
injury among children who attend or do not attend child
care. Ecological theories suggest time spent in one contex-
tual environment affects behavior in other environments
(Bronfenbrenner, 1977), so in this study, we considered
children's overall risk for injury rather than focusing on
only the time at a childcare center. Second, excepting the
study by Kotch et al. (1997) which admits sampling
biases, there is no information on risk for injury to chil-
dren cared for in family day care settings.
Third, there is little information on the effect of
child care on injury risk in large national samples.
Previous work (Kopjar & Wickizer, 1996; Kotch et al.,
1997; Rivara et al., 1989) relied primarily on local
samples. Fourth, previous work focused only on atten-
dance at child care without considering the important
variable of the quality of that child care (Alkon et al.,
2000). In this report, researchers considered not just
time in child care but also the quality of the childcare
setting. Fifth, and perhaps most critical, previous work
failed to control for anticipated effects of child behavior
and family factors on injury. In this report, we con-
trolled for child temperament, family poverty, and
maternal parenting strategies.
We had two primary hypotheses. First, based on
the results from Gunn et al. (1991), we hypothesized
children who spend more time in child care might have
increased overall risk of unintentional injury. Second,
we hypothesized that this effect would be moderated
by quality of child care: children in high-quality child-
care centers might have somewhat lower risk of injury
compared with those in lower quality centers after
controlling for potential child and family mediating
factors.
Methods
Data Source and Participants
Data came from the National Institute of Child Health
and Human Development (NICHD) Study of Early
Child Care, a longitudinal investigation of the effects of
early child care on children's development. Participants
were recruited from 31 hospitals located in or near 10 US
cities (Little Rock, AR; Irvine, CA; Lawrence, KS; Boston,
MA; Morganton, NC; Philadelphia, PA; Pittsburgh, PA;
Charlottesville, VA; Seattle, WA; Madison, WI). During
selected 24-hr sampling periods, 8,986 women giving
birth were visited in the hospital. Of these, 5,416 met
the study's eligibility criteria (briefly, English-speaking
mothers age 18 or over who planned not to put children
up for adoption, not to relocate in the next year, and
who lived in safe and accessible neighborhoods for
research; for details, see NICHD Early Child Care
Research Network, 2000). A subset of this group was
selected in accordance with a conditional-random sam-
pling plan designed to ensure recruited families reflected
the economic, educational, and ethnic diversity of the
catchment area at each site. When the infants were 1
month old, 1,364 families (58% of those contacted)
enrolled in the longitudinal study (see NICHD Early
Child Care Research Network, 1994, 2001; for details of
study design and recruitment, including informed con-
sent procedures).
Of the 1,364 families who took part in the NICHD
Study of Early Child Care, data from 1,225 are reported
in this study. Missing cases arose for a variety of reasons.
Several families did not participate in the mother­child
interaction (n = 92) or the Infant/Toddler HOME Inven-
tory (n = 85); some failed to provide family income
186 Schwebel, Brezausek, and Belsky
information (n = 93); and many failed to consistently
respond to inquiries about children's injury history (n =
92). If any of this information was missing, the family
was dropped from all analyses.
Independent samples t tests were used to compare
the sample reported at present with the sample with
missing data on all variables reported in regression anal-
yses. Just two differences emerged, both concerning the
childcare variables. The sample included in the analyses
was cared for in childcare centers (M = 8.12 hr/week, SD =
10.26) and family day care environments (M = 5.50, SD =
9.73) for more hours than the sample that was dropped
from analyses (M = 2.73, SD = 6.80 in childcare centers;
M = 2.44, SD = 6.41 in family day care centers).
The sample of 1,225 families reported at present was
followed longitudinally until first grade. It included 624
boys (51%) and 601 girls (49%) and was 81% Caucasian,
12% African American, and 7% other ethnicities. Mothers
had an average of 14.33 (SD = 2.51) years of education.
Measures
Many measures were chosen from the NICHD Early
Child Care Study data for this analysis, as detailed
below.
Child Gender
Parents reported child gender during the 1-month
assessment period.
Family SES
SES of the family was approximated by using an income
to needs ratio. Income was based on the entire income of
all members of the family living in the same household.
Needs were based on the poverty threshold during the
year of measurement, the number of people in the
household, and the number of children in the household
(see Bilbrey, Batten, Appelbaum, & Wendell, 1994 for
details).
Child Activity and Affect During Mother­Child
Interaction
Children's activity and affect were measured at 6 months
of age during the course of a 15-min semistructured,
mother­child interaction session that was videotaped for
subsequent coding. During the first half of the session,
mothers played with their infants, by using toys of their
own choosing. During the second half, a standard set of
toys was provided by the experimenter for the mother to
engage the infant. Three measures of interest for this
report were coded by trained observers watching video-
tapes of the interaction: activity level, positive mood,
and negative mood (Appelbaum, Batten, & Wendell,
1994; reliability of coders was adequate, rs ranged from
0.61 to 0.83; Batten, Appelbaum, & Wendell, 1994).
Maternal Parenting Behavior
Maternal parenting behavior was assessed by using the
Infant/Toddler HOME Inventory (Bradley & Caldwell,
1988), which was administered when children were
6 months of age. Observers visited the home, inter-
viewed mothers, and made binary decisions concerning
various aspects of the home environment and maternal
behavior decisions were made based on observations
during the visit and mother's answers to questions dur-
ing the interview. A series of factor analyses conducted
by the NICHD Early Child Care team yielded a three-
factor solution. Of particular interest for this study was
the factor labeled "positive involvement" which included
six items from the measure (Little, Appelbaum, Batten,
& Wendell, 1994). Example items include "parent spon-
taneously vocalizes to child at least twice" and "parent's
voice conveys positive feelings toward child."
Child Care Attendance and Quality
Childcare attendance was measured based on parent report
during regular phone calls or interviews every 3­4 months.
Parents reported the average number of hours per week
their children were in various types of childcare situ-
ations. For the purposes of this study, maternal
responses were aggregated into three categories: child
care in a childcare center (i.e., child care in a setting
designed specifically for the care of children, with sev-
eral staff members and many children); child care in a
family day care setting (i.e., child care in an individual's
home, typically with one caregiver and few children);
and other childcare arrangements (most typically care
by the parents or other relatives of the child). In gen-
eral, the childcare centers children attended were
licensed by local or state authorities (e.g., 99% of cen-
ters attended during the 6-month assessment were
licensed) but the family day care centers were not (only
15% of family day care centers children attended at the
6-month assessment were licensed by the state or com-
munity, registered with the city or county as a childcare
provider, or belonged to a group that organized family
day care in the local area).
Two childcare attendance variables were of particu-
lar interest for this report: the average number of hours
per week children spent in childcare centers and the
average number of hours per week children spent in
family day care environments, both of them computed
from birth until age 5 and set to 0 if children did not
spend any time in those environments. This method of
computation was deemed most accurate, but created a
Child Care and Injury 187
situation whereby children might have non-zero scores
on both variables. That is, a child who spent an average
of 20 hr per week in family day care and 10 hr per week
in a childcare center would receive non-zero scores for
each variable and would be included in analyses based
on both those scores. Similarly, a child who changed
type of childcare attendance during development (e.g.,
attended family day care while ages 1 and 2 and
switched to a childcare center from ages 3 through 5)
might receive scores on both variables based on the
average time across early childhood that he or she was in
each type of childcare arrangement.
Measures of childcare quality were available via the
average of several variables from the Observational
Record of the Caregiving Environment (ORCE), an
observational rating of the childcare environment. The
ORCE was performed at both childcare centers and family
day care environments on five occasions: when chil-
dren were 6, 15, 24, 36, and 54 months. On each of
those five occasions, childcare environments were rated
in 10-min intervals at least twice; a wide range of char-
acteristics were coded. For this study, two measures
were standardized and averaged to generate an overall
assessment of childcare quality. First, a composite
"total quality" variable that was itself composed of the
average of five variables was considered. The five com-
ponents of the total quality measure were ratings of the
caregiver's sensitivity to nondistress, the caregiver's
detachment (reversed), the caregiver's stimulation of
development, the caregiver's positive regard, and the
caregiver's flatness of affect (reversed). Second,
researchers considered the observer's overall rating of
childcare quality, a rating that was made on a 5-point
scale with a higher score representing a better rating.
The two measures of childcare quality correlated
strongly, r(1132) = 0.60, p < .001. Two standardized
scores were computed for the purposes of this analysis,
the average quality of care children experienced during
their time in childcare centers between birth and age 5
and the average quality of care children experienced
during their time in family day care centers between
birth and age 5. These values were set to 0 if data were
missing (most frequently because children did not
spend time in the setting of interest).
Injury History
Mothers reported their children's history of injuries
requiring professional medical attention on a quarterly
basis, either through telephone interviews or during
scheduled home visits by experimenters. For the pur-
poses of this study, all injuries of children when 6­60
months of age were summed to create a single measure
of injury history. Injuries were summed across the full
study period (ages 6­60 months) for two primary rea-
sons. First, a sizable developmental period was necessary
to provide sufficient variance in the dependent variable
for a regression equation. If injury risk was examined
over shorter developmental periods, statistical variance
would be lost. Second, we wished to examine how child
care influences children's risk for injury throughout early
development. Tendency to be injured is a relatively stable
individual difference across development--that is, chil-
dren who engage in injury risk behaviors at age 2 are also
likely to do so at age 4 (Jaquess & Finney, 1994;
Schwebel & Plumert, 1999)--so we felt it appropriate to
consider risk throughout early childhood rather than
across shorter developmental stages.
Data Analysis Plan
The analysis plan consisted of four steps. First, descrip-
tive statistics were considered for all variables of inter-
est. Second, a correlation matrix was constructed to test
how predictors related to each other and how predictor
variables related to children's injuries. Third, to test the
primary hypothesis, we constructed two Poisson regres-
sion equations. One tested the role of childcare centers
in children's risk for injury and the other tested the role
of family-based care in children's risk for injury. Last,
relative risk and percent attributable risk were com-
puted to offer an epidemiological approach to interpret-
ing findings.
Results
Descriptive Analyses
Descriptive statistics for all variables of interest are
shown in Table I. Over the 54-month study period, children
experienced a mean of 0.64 (SD = 0.92; range = 0­6)
injuries requiring professional medical attention.
Children were more likely to be injured at age 1
(mean number of injuries = 0.21, SD = 0.49) and age 2
(M = 0.21, SD = 0.44) than during their first year of life
(age 0; M = 0.06, SD = 0.24), age 3 (M = 0.12, SD = 0.34)
and age 4 (M = 0.14, SD = 0.38), and during the kinder-
garten (M = 0.13, SD = 0.36) and first grade (M = 0.15,
SD = 0.39) years. The 624 boys in the sample had a
higher total injury rate (M = 0.72, SD = 0.98) than the
601 girls (M = 0.56, SD = 0.84), t(1223) = 3.04, p < .01.
Overall, 698 children in the sample reported no injuries
between age 6 months and the end of first grade; 347
reported one injury, 122 reported two injuries, and 58
reported between three and six injuries.

Correlation Matrix
Table I also includes a correlation matrix. Several of the
statistically significant correlations were anticipated.
The three measures of child affect related to each other,
for example (activity level correlated .26 with positive
mood and ­.10 with negative mood; positive mood
correlated ­.28 with negative mood; all ps < .01). The
income:needs ratio was related to maternal parenting (r =
0.20, p < .01) and time and quality in child care (r = 0.12
and 0.21, ps < .01, respectively) and family day care (r =
0.05, p < .05 and r = 0.11, p < .01, respectively) centers.
Hours and quality of child care correlated negatively
with each other, r = ­0.14, p < .01, for childcare centers
and r = ­0.06, p < .05, for family day care centers.
Of particular interest in Table I were correlations
between children's injuries and the other measures. Not sur-
prisingly, injury history correlated with gender (r = ­0.09,
p < .01), with boys injured more than girls; activity level (r =
0.07, p < .05), with more active infants injured more; and
with positive mood (r = 0.07, p < .05), with more "positive"
infants injured more. Though effect sizes were small, these
anticipated associations provide validational evidence for
the measure of injury used in this inquiry. Contrary to the
primary hypothesis, children who spent more time in child-
care centers (r = ­0.06, p < .05) and in family day care envi-
ronments (r = ­0.07, p < .01) were modestly protected from
injury. There were no indications of significant relations
between injuries and quality of child care.
Regression Analyses
The third and primary analyses were stepwise Poisson
regression models with a logarithmic link function pre-
dicting unintentional injuries. As shown in Table II, two
models were constructed. The only difference between
the models were which childcare variables were entered;
in the first, childcare center hours and quality were
entered and in the second, family day care hours and
quality were entered.
The first two steps of each model were identical;
child variables were entered in the first step and parent/
family variables in the second. In the first step, replicat-
ing work with other samples, male gender, high activity
level, and high positive mood, all emerged as statistically
significant predictors of injury risk. The addition of fam-
ily SES and maternal parenting in the second step did
not change the model appreciably.
In the third step, hours and quality of child care
were entered into each model. In both cases, the amount
of time children spent in child care predicted injury risk
in a positive manner: the more time children spent in
either childcare centers (2 = 5.47, p < .05) or family day
care centers (2 = 8.00, p < .01), the more injuries the
child experienced. Results provided no support for the
moderational hypothesis in the final step, as the interac-
tion term did not add significantly to the model from
Step 3.
Epidemiological Approach
Table III illustrates the data using an epidemiological
approach. Relative risk (and its 95% confidence interval)
and percent attributable risk are displayed for each of
the variables in the last step of the Poisson regression
models. Results reflect findings in the regressions. Male
gender and positive mood increased risk for injury.

Hours in child care had a small but statistically signifi-
cant effect on reducing injury risk. Other variables--
most notably activity level, negative mood, and family
day care quality--had moderately high percent attribut-
able risk but were not statistically significant.
Discussion
Researchers continue to debate whether attending child
care at young ages is advantageous, detrimental, or
immaterial to a child's development (e.g., Belsky, 2001;
Lamb, 1998; NICHD Early Child Care Research Net-
work, 2002, 2003). Recent evidence makes it clear that
it is a mistake to think simply in terms of whether child
care is good or bad for children--and for several rea-
sons. First, child care is not a monolithic experience,
but rather one that varies on several dimensions: Some
children spend lots of time in child care and others little
time; some children experience good quality care and
others poor. Second, the way in which child care affects
one aspect of development may differ from how it
affects another. For example, in the NICHD Study of
Early Child Care, better quality care has been found to
be associated with modestly enhanced cognitive and
linguistic functioning, whereas more time in any kind
of child care (i.e., of good or poor quality) has been
found to be predictive of modestly higher but not psy-
chopathological levels of externalizing behavior prob-
lems (NICHD Early Child Care Research Network,
2002).
Previous research suggests children are at reduced
risk for injury while physically in a child care setting
(Gunn et al., 1991; Rivara et al., 1989), particularly for
younger children (Kopjar & Wickizer, 1996) and when
minor injuries are considered (Kotch et al., 1997). We
sought to test a different question, however: how does
attendance at child care--both in childcare centers and
in family day care environments--affect a child's overall
risk for injury, in all contextual environments they
encounter (Bronfenbrenner, 1977). Just one study has
tested this question previously (Gunn et al., 1991), and
it found that children who attended child care, although
at reduced risk for injury while at child care, were at
increased risk for injury overall--largely because they
experienced an elevated risk for injury when at home.
We tested our hypotheses by using a large sample, con-
trolling for various child and family factors that influ-
ence injury risk, and with consideration of the quality of
childcare settings.
After controlling for child and family factors that
predict unintentional injury by themselves (and in com-
bination with each other), results proved contrary to
previous results and to predictions. In our study, chil-
dren who spent more time in child care experienced a
small but statistically significant reduction in risk for
unintentional injuries. We could detect no evidence that
this effect was restricted to good quality child care (or
that the reverse was true when child care was of poor
quality). This result is consistent with research on chil-
dren's risk in childcare settings (e.g., Rivara et al., 1989)
but inconsistent with research on children's injury risk
overall (Gunn et al., 1991). It proved true for children
both in childcare centers, most of which were licensed,
and for those in family day care environments, most of
which were not licensed.
These findings lead to speculation concerning why
more time in child care might predict slightly reduced
risk for injury and what aspects of childcare attendance
might be associated with that reduction. One possibility
is that childcare center environments are somehow safer
than the homes of most preschoolers. This possibility
can be verified in most US childcare centers, where
safety of childcare centers is highly regulated (e.g., par-
ticular staff:child ratio must be maintained, staff are
trained on child safety issues, and hazards are absent
from playgrounds, restrooms, and play areas). However,
our findings extended beyond childcare centers to fam-
ily day care environments, which are typically not regu-
lated in the United States (including those attended by
children in this sample), and we found that more time in
family day care environments also protected children
from injury.
It may be that it is not the environment but the
adults working with children who teach children to act
safely. Childcare workers--whether at childcare centers
or in family day care environments--may somehow be
more protective of children's safety than parents. This
possibility is particularly appealing given our finding
that children in child care had a reduced risk of injury
across all environmental contexts they engaged in. We
had hoped our investigations of the role of child care
and parenting quality might have revealed this possibil-
ity, but it is possible that our measures of quality were
insufficient.
Another explanation for our findings has to do with
the fact that attendance in child care is nonrandom. It may
be that the types of children who attend child care influ-
ence their risk of injury. Parents who choose to send their
children to child care, for any number of financial, tem-
peramental, or interpersonal reasons, may have children
who are at reduced risk for injury. As an example, many
parents who send their children to child care are likely
Child Care and Injury 191
to value their careers and therefore may be motivated for
success in all aspects of their lives; this motivation may
extend to creating a safer home environment for their
children. Similarly, children who attend child care may
be conditioned to behave in somewhat different ways
(e.g., with more cautious exploration of unknown envi-
ronments) than children who do not attend child care,
and these differences might influence risk for injury.
The fact, however, that the analyses controlled for pre-
existing differences between the two groups suggests
that selection may not be the operative factor accounting
for the reported results.
What might we conclude? Combined with previous
work, our findings indicate children who attend child care
have a slightly reduced risk of unintentional injury. Statis-
tical effect sizes are small, but significant; this translates
into minor but meaningful influences on the lives of chil-
dren. We must entertain the possibility that our findings
are spurious--subject to type I statistical error or peculiar-
ities of our data, particularly because they contradict with
the previously-reported results of Gunn et al. (1991).
However, the facts that our findings were consistent for
both childcare centers and family day care centers, that
they were maintained despite controlling for a number of
child and family factors, and that the data came from a
large national sample in a longitudinal design, suggest the
findings are meaningful. What remains undetermined, and
in need of continuing investigation, is why there might be
a difference in injury risk among children in child care
versus those not in child care.
Limitations
Limitations of this research should be mentioned in
closing. First, the amount of variance accounted for in
our regression equations was small. This was not sur-
prising: a wide range of intrapsychic, interpersonal, and
environmental factors contribute to children's risk for
unintentional injuries and one would not expect child-
care attendance to play a major role in children's risk for
injury. Our objective was to examine whether attendance
in child care might be one of many contributing factors,
not to explain all factors that might contribute to children's
injury risk. Statistically speaking, we anticipated a small
effect size and therefore required a large sample to
achieve the modest results we did; the variance explained
by our regression equations was of lesser interest than
the influence of particular variables.
A second limitation of this investigation stems from
the fact that some childcare providers refused to admit
observers from the NICHD research team. It was the
sense of the NICHD researchers that such settings were
likely to be of poorer quality, on average, than those vis-
ited, observed, and rated for quality of care. To the
extent that this was the case, it may have undermined
our ability to detect effects of childcare quality on injury,
either as a main effect or a moderator of time spent in
child care. This is because it seems plausible that it is in
the poorest quality child care where children are most at
risk of being injured due to the inadequacy of their
supervision.
Third, this study was opportunistic and exploratory.
The data were not collected for the explicit purpose of
studying the effects of child care on children's uninten-
tional injury risk and hypotheses were created following
data collection. Some of the measures were not ideal.
Many measures were based on self-report. The maternal-
report measure of injury exemplifies this limitation.
Although parental reports of children's injuries are rea-
sonably reliable (Pless & Pless, 1995), particularly when
reports are collected at short (e.g., quarterly) intervals to
reduce recall biases (Harel et al., 1994; Peterson, Harbeck,
& Moreno, 1993), measures from secondary reporters
(e.g., fathers) or medical providers might have validated
the maternal reports used. Further, mothers may not
have reported all their children's injuries because they
did not know about the injuries. In particular, it is possi-
ble that some injuries incurred at child care were not
reported to parents and therefore resulted in a false indi-
cation that children in child care had fewer injuries,
although this possibility seems relatively unlikely
because for analytic purposes, researchers tallied only
injuries requiring professional medical attention.
Fourth, our decision to average amount of time chil-
dren spent in child care through development, though
providing a good indication of time in child care over
long periods of development, restricts our ability to
examine developmental changes over smaller periods.
For example, it may be that children placed in family
day care from the age of 6 through 24 months, and then
transferred into a childcare center, are at great risk for
injury whereas children who are in a childcare center
early in development and then transferred into family day
care are not. Our analyses were designed to look at large-
scale trends, and relied on average time in various child-
care settings throughout early development, but do not
inform questions related to shorter developmental periods.
Conclusion
Results from this study indicate attendance at child care
may offer a slight protection from risk for child injury.
192 Schwebel, Brezausek, and Belsky
From a public health perspective, identification of even
a small effect in the relation between time in child care
and risk for unintentional injury is meaningful. As
stated in our introductory paragraph, nearly 65% of 3- to
5-year-olds in America spend their weekdays in child-
care settings (Cohen, 2001). Unintentional injuries are
the leading cause of pediatric mortality (National Safety
Council, 2001) and strike with alarming frequency in
childcare settings (Alkon et al., 1999). Prevention of a
small portion of injuries at childcare centers will affect a
large number of children and their families. From the
pragmatic public health viewpoint of preventing unin-
tentional injury, identification and subsequent preven-
tion based on a small effect size that affects many
children might be considered as vital as identification
and subsequent prevention based on a large effect size
that affects few children.
