Introduction
Extensive research suggests that obesity reduces quality of life
(QOL) in the domains of physical functioning and health, sex-
ual health, social and interpersonal relationships, work-related
performance and mental health (1,2). The degree of impair-
ment appears to be correlated with the severity of obesity such
that the largest individuals experience the lowest QOL (1,3­5).
However, not all obese individuals experience a reduction in
QOL and, consequently, examination of the conditions under
which obesity can influence QOL is necessary.
Binge-eating disorder (BED), an eating disorder prevalent
in obese samples (6­8), may be one condition that influences
the relationship between obesity and QOL. The little research
that exists to date generally suggests that individuals with BED
experience more negative QOL outcomes and mental dys-
function than noneating disordered obese individuals (9­12).
However, other research has found few differences in QOL
between individuals with BED and obese noneating disor-
dered individuals (13). Given these equivocal findings, more
research in this area is warranted because the ability of a BED
diagnosis to predict a broad range of variables that establish its
validity (e.g., ability to discriminate from other disorders due
to biological factors, QOL) and clinical utility (e.g., response to
treatment) will be critical to determining its nosological status
in the DSM-V, due to be published in 2012 (9).
Ethnicity may be another factor that influences the relation-
ship between obesity and QOL. Rates of obesity are higher in
ethnic minority groups in the United States (14). In the eat-
ing disorder literature, a growing body of research documents
considerable differences in weight-related attitudes, body size
ideals, and unhealthy weight control behaviors across diverse
ethnic groups (15­17). In addition, a small body of literature
exists suggesting that minorities may have an optimistic view
of health, even in the presence of significant risk factors that
harm physical health or psychiatric disorders that decrease
mental health functioning (18,19). For these reasons, ethnic-
ity may be an important factor that influences the relationship
between BED, QOL, and obesity.
A very small body of research has examined QOL in obese,
ethnically diverse groups in the United States and found inter-
esting differences. Overall, research suggests that QOL is
more impaired for white women compared to ethnic minority
groups, with white women reporting significantly more overall
impairment than all other groups despite having a significantly
lower BMI (4,5,20) and black males reporting significantly less
overall impairment than all other groups despite having the
highest BMI (4). Additionally, physical functioning has been
reported to be the greatest area of impairment across all ethnic
groups, with sexual functioning reported to be an area of sig-
nificant impairment for black women (4).
The Relationship Between Quality of Life,
Binge-Eating Disorder, and Obesity Status
in an Ethnically Diverse Sample
Marisol Perez1 and Cortney S. Warren2
This study examined the relationship between obesity status, binge-eating disorder (BED), and quality of life (QOL) in
a large, ethnically diverse community sample of adult men and women. Using data from the Collaborative Psychiatric
Epidemiological Surveys (N = 20,013), individuals were categorized into four groups: nonobese with BED (n = 142),
nonobese without BED (n = 14,301), obese with BED (n = 136), and obese without BED (n = 4,863). Results indicated
obese individuals with BED consistently reported the poorest QOL. Findings suggested that obesity status was more
strongly related to physical health-related QOL variables (e.g., number of physical conditions, mobility impairment)
whereas diagnostic status was more predictive of mental health and social functioning QOL variables (e.g., cognitive
impairment, social interaction impairment, time out of role). The degree to which lifetime BED diagnosis was
associated with impairment in social interaction differed across ethnic groups. For black individuals, the number of
physical health conditions was associated with BED presence moreso than weight status.

Epidemiology
To expand on existing research, the overarching purpose of
this study was to examine the relationships between obesity
status (i.e., obese or nonobese), diagnostic status (i.e., BED or
non-BED), and QOL in a large, ethnically diverse commu-
nity sample of adult men and women. Specifically, we tested
two intertwined issues: (i) whether obese and nonobese indi-
viduals diagnosed with BED differ from obese and nonobese
individuals without BED on QOL, and (ii) whether the rela-
tionship between obesity status, clinical diagnosis, and QOL
differs across ethnic groups. Consistent with previous research,
we predicted that obese individuals would report significantly
more impairment on physical health-related aspects of QOL
than nonobese individuals and that individuals with BED
would report more impairment on mental health and sociali-
zation related aspects of QOL than non-BED participants.
Additionally, we predicted that obese individuals with BED
would report the poorest QOL in both physical and men-
tal health aspects of QOL. Consistent with a limited body of
research, we also hypothesized some ethnic differences. First,
we expected that white individuals would report the most QOL
impairment and black individuals would report the least QOL
impairment, with Hispanics falling in the middle. Second, we
predicted that although the relationship between obesity, BED,
and QOL would be consistent across ethnic groups (i.e., as pre-
dicted above), the degree of impairment would differ by ethnic
group. For example, we expected obese individuals to report
more impairment on physical health than nonobese individu-
als and for this to be consistent across ethnic groups. However,
we expected ethnic groups to differ on the degree of impair-
ment reported, with minorities reporting less QOL impair-
ment than white individuals.
Methods and Procedures
Participants
Togatheralargeenoughsampleofethnicminorityparticipants,datawere
compiled from the NIMH Collaborative Psychiatric Epidemiological
Surveys (CPES), which includes the National Comorbidity Survey
Replication, the National Survey of American Life, and the National
Latino and Asian American Study (15,18). The CPES is a nationally
representative dataset that assesses mental disorders in 20,013 men
and women living in the United States. Given its representative nature,
the CPES includes a large sample of ethnic minority participants: Of
the sample, 38% of participants self-identified as Caucasian/European
American (n = 7,587), 31% black/African American (n = 6,238), 18%
Hispanic/Latino (n = 3,620), 11% Asian/Asian American, and 2% other.
Approximately 57% of the sample is female.
Procedure
For the original CPES studies, all individuals were interviewed using
a modified version of the World Health Organization's Composite
International Diagnostic Interview (WHO-CIDI, ref. 21) to obtain
DSM-IV diagnostic criteria information and arrive at disorder classi-
fication. This information was used to determine BED diagnosis. The
CPES study included 946 interviewers who were trained on cultural,
racial, sexual orientation, and socioeconomic sensitivity; the eligibil-
ity and selection of households; and, the administration of the inter-
view (22). Interviewers successfully completed a certification process in
which they conducted mock interviews with trainers (23). The average
interview length ranged from 126 to 145min, with an overall response
rate ranging from 70.9 to 71.5% (21,22,24). Further details on the meth-
odology, study design, development, implementation, recruitment
strategies, etc., can be found in previous publications (25).
Measures
All participants that positively endorsed the screener item "Ever have
a strong fear/concern about being too overweight," received the rest
of the questions in the eating disorder module from the WHO-CIDI
diagnostic interview. Within the binge-eating module, participants
were asked if they engaged in binge eating consistent with the defi-
nition in the DSM-IV TR (e.g., sense of loss of control over eating,
eating a large amount of food). Positive responses to both items were
required for diagnosis. In addition, participants were asked if the binge
episodes were associated with any of the following and three positive
endorsements were required for diagnosis: eating until uncomfort-
ably full, eating more rapidly, eating when not physically hungry, eat-
ing alone because embarrassed by amount of food eaten, and feeling
guilty/depressed/disgusted after overeating. Binge eating had to cause
marked distress, could not occur during the course of another eating
disorder, and could not be associated with weight-related compen-
satory behaviors. Algorithms were created to assess BED classifica-
tion consistent with DSM-IV TR including frequency and duration
criteria. All diagnostic criteria were assessed and represented in the
module and algorithm. Lifetime diagnoses were ascertained using the
individual's retrospective report. Inter-rater  for the eating disorder
modules ranged from 0.78 to 0.80 (26). Further information can be
found in previous CPES publications (22­24) (For those interested in
replicating these analyses from this public dataset, please contact the
authors for the numerical identification code given to each variable
within the dataset).
Although using empirically supported measures of QOL is generally
preferable, this was not possible while retaining a large sample of ethnic
minorities (i.e., using the CPES dataset). Consequently, we examined
areas of life impairment that are generally included in QOL measures
(specific variable numbers and/or labels used from the dataset are avail-
able upon request).
Physical health. Physical health-related aspects of QOL were assessed
in two ways. First, a "physical health rating" item measured each par-
ticipant's self-perceived overall physical health rated on a 1­5 Likert-
type scale, with higher scores indicating better functioning. Second,
to obtain a more objective assessment of physical health, a composite
score of the number of physical health conditions reported by each par-
ticipant was created by adding the number of conditions endorsed. A
total of 13 physical conditions were examined including arthritis, ulcers,
cancer, high blood pressure, diabetes, liver problems, kidney problems,
stroke, asthma, lung disease, blood circulation problems, heart trouble,
and osteoporosis.
Mental health. Mental health aspects of QOL were also assessed in two
ways. First, a "mental health rating" item measured self-perceived over-
all mental functioning on a 1­5 Likert-type scale, with higher scores
indicating better functioning. Second, a variable consisting of the num-
ber of lifetime Axis I psychiatric disorders (excluding eating pathology)
was created by adding the number of endorsed diagnoses from a total
of 15 disorders.
Social support. Social support was measured using six items assess-
ing friend and family support. The items consisted of the frequency of
phone communication with relatives and friends, the degree to which
one believes they can rely on relatives and friends when faced with a
serious problem, and the degree to which one can openly discuss wor-
ries with relatives and friends. All items were measured on a Likert-
type scale and summed, with higher scores indicating poorer support.
Additionally, the World Health Organization Disability Assessment
Schedule (WHO-DAS II) is a semistructured interview developed
for assessing functioning among patients with mental disorders and
assessed six domains of functioning within the past 30 days: cogni-
tive impairment, self-care, role impairment, social interaction, time
obesity | VOLUME 20 NUMBER 4 | april 2012 881

Epidemiology
out of role, and mobility. Cognitive impairment assesses an individ-
ual's ability to understand, communicate, concentrate, and learn new
tasks. Self-care assesses an individual's ability to meet basic physical
needs (e.g., bathe, feed, ability to live alone at home for a few days).
Role impairment assesses the total number of days the individual was
unable to carry out work or normal daily activities, as well as reduc-
tion in quality of work/activities. Social interaction assesses effec-
tive social interaction, such as getting along with people you do not
know, maintaining friendships, and forming new friendships. Time
out of role assesses an individual's ability to do everyday tasks, such
as household responsibilities and chores. Finally, mobility assesses an
individual's ability to walk both in- and outdoors, stand for long peri-
ods of time and other similar activities. The WHO-DAS II has been
extensively studied across 18 countries, including the United States,
and has been found to have good construct and convergent valid-
ity, good internal consistency, and test­retest reliability (27,28). The
WHO-DAS II subscales are scored from 0 to 100, with higher scores
indicating greater impairment.
Analytic procedure
In the original CPES dataset, participants were separated into six BMI
groups: underweight, normal weight, overweight, obese class I, obese
class II, and obese class III. To determine how to consolidate the groups,
a one-way ANOVA was performed with BMI groups as the predictor
on all of the dependent variables. No statistically significant differences
emerged on any of the dependent variables in the under-, normal-, and
overweight groups except for number of physical health conditions
(the overweight group reported significantly more conditions than the
normal weight and underweight groups). However, all three groups
(i.e., under-, normal-, and overweight) did differ significantly from
the obese groups on all of the dependent variables. Consequently, the
under-, normal-, and overweight groups were combined into one group
labeled the nonobese group (BMI <30) and the three obese groups were
combined into one group labeled the obese group (BMI 30).
Given that the main focus of this study was to investigate whether
overall QOL and general functioning differed by obesity status and
BED diagnosis, the nonobese and obese groups were further divided
by lifetime history of BED. In sum, four groups were created: nonobese
individuals with BED (n = 124, BMI M = 25.30, s.d. = 3.24), nonobese
individuals without BED (n = 12,063, BMI M = 24.45, s.d. =3.09),
obese individuals with BED (n = 126, BMI M = 36.26, s.d. = 5.22), and
obese individuals without BED (n = 4,585, BMI M = 34.93, s.d. = 4.62).
The lifetime prevalence rate of BED was 1% among nonobese individu-
als and 2.6% among obese individuals. Among those that met criteria
for BED diagnosis within the past 12 months, 55% were in the obese
with lifetime BED diagnosis and the rest were in the nonobese with
lifetime BED diagnosis; this difference was nonsignificant 2(1) = 2.69,
P = 0.10. Table 1 displays the ethnic distribution across the four groups.
Approximately 33.6% of black individuals were obese, compared to
23.8% for whites and 27.4% for Hispanics. The prevalence of BED was
2.3% among Hispanics, 1.5% among black individuals, and 1% among
white participants. Among those that met criteria for BED diagnosis
within the past 12 months, 27% were white, 40% were black, and 34%
were Hispanic; this difference was significant 2(2) = 15.82, P < 0.01.
Interestingly, for black and Hispanic participants, comorbid mental
health conditions were higher in BED groups (average of two comor-
bid mental health conditions) than non-BED groups (average 0.5­0.7;
P < 0.001). However, on self-perception of mental health, all groups
rated their mental health between "good" and "very good" (on average).
Among the white group, the BED groups reported more mental health
conditions (average 2.5) and poorer perception of mental health than
the non-BED groups (P < 0.001).
For the main analyses, hierarchical regression equations were com-
puted; one equation per QOL measure. To control for socioeconomic-
status, the income-to-needs ratio variable in the dataset was entered
first as a covariate. In step 2, ethnicity (coded as white, black, or His-
panic) and the variable BED by obesity status group (coded as non-
obese without BED, nonobese with BED, obese without BED, obese
with BED) were simultaneously entered into the equation. In step 3,
the interaction term between ethnicity and BED by obesity status was
entered. Dependent variables were overall physical health, number of
physical conditions, overall mental health, number of mental health
conditions, social support, ability to self-care, cognitive impairment,
impairment in mobility, time out of role, role impairment, and social
interaction. Because both predictors (i.e., ethnicity and BED by obesity
status group) were categorical variables, both variables were dummy
coded into the regression equations. The contrasts for ethnicity were
whites vs. blacks, whites vs. Hispanics, and blacks vs. Hispanics. The
contrasts for the BED by obesity status group compared each group to
another group (no groups were combined), consisting of six contrasts.

The interaction term dummy codes consisted of the multiplication of
ethnicity and BED by obesity status group. However, not all possible
combinations of contrasts were computed for the interaction term. The
main interests were comparing BED vs. without BED groups, and obese
vs. nonobese groups, for each ethnic group (a total of six contrasts).
To reduce family wise error, significance level was set at 0.001 for all
regression equations. Table 2 displays the results from the regression
equations.
Results
The relationship between obesity,
lifetime BED diagnosis, and QOL
The first objective of this study was to explore the relationship
between obesity status and lifetime BED diagnosis, and QOL.
It was hypothesized that obese individuals would report sig-
nificantly more impairment on physical health-related aspects
of QOL than nonobese individuals and that individuals with
lifetime BED diagnosis would report more impairment on
mental health and socialization related aspects of QOL than
non-BED participants. The BED by obesity status variable
significantly predicted all QOL indices except for social sup-
port (see Table 2). Table 3 displays the means, s.d., and sig-
nificant post-hoc comparisons between the BED by obesity
status groups. In general, the obese with lifetime BED diag-
nosis group reported the most impairment for both physical
and mental health. Both obese groups regardless of lifetime
BED diagnosis reported more impairment in physical health,
number of physical conditions, and mobility. Those that
reported a lifetime BED diagnosis regardless of weight status,
reported more impairment in overall mental health, number of
mental conditions, cognitive impairment, time out of role, and
social interaction. Although overall physical health and social
support were significantly predicted by BED by obesity status,
none of the post-hoc comparisons were statistically significant.
In general, means were in the expected direction, regardless of
significance and consistent with hypotheses.
The impact of ethnicity on the relationship
between obesity, BED, and QOL
Significant ethnic differences on overall physical health,
number of physical conditions, number of mental health condi-
tions, mobility, time out of role, and role impairment emerged
(see Table 2). Contrasts revealed that the black group reported
the most physical conditions (M = 0.85, s.d. = 1.35) and great-
est impairment in time out of role (M = 16.30, s.d. = 3.21),
followed by the white group (conditions M = 0.16, s.d. = 0.73;
time out M = 13.53, s.d. = 2.72), and the Hispanic group who
reported the least impairment (conditions M = 0.06, s.d. = 0.43;
time out M = 10.37, s.d. = 2.59). The white group reported the
most mental health conditions (M = 0.80, s.d. = 1.37) and role
impairment (M = 6.05, s.d. = 1.37), followed by the Hispanic
group (mental health M = 0.67, s.d. = 1.26; role M = 4.55, s.d. =
1.15), and the black group (mental health M = 0.60, s.d. = 1.20;
role M = 4.07, s.d. = 1.10). The white group reported the best
self-perception of physical health (M = 2.63, s.d. = 0.70) but
the most impairment in mobility (M = 5.71, s.d. = 1.62), fol-
lowed by the black group (health M = 2.60, s.d. = 0.74; mobility
M = 4.33, s.d. = 1.38), and the Hispanic group, who reported
the worst perception of physical health (M = 2.56, s.d. = 0.78)
and least impairment in mobility (M = 3.49, s.d. = 1.29).
The second objective of this study was to assess whether
the relationship between lifetime BED diagnosis and obesity
status, and QOL differed across ethnic groups. The relation-
ship between BED by obesity status across ethnic group is
reflected by the interaction term in Table 2. Although all of the

overall regression equations were significant, contrasts within
the interaction term were only significantly associated with
two of the QOL indices: number of physical conditions and
social interaction. As Figure 1 shows, contrasts revealed the
black group significantly and consistently reported more phys-
ical conditions than any other ethnic group. In addition, the
black groups with BED reported more physical conditions than
the groups without BED. In contrast, for Hispanics, the obese
group with BED reported more physical conditions than the
other groups. This suggests that number of physical conditions
reported by black individuals was associated with presence
of lifetime BED diagnosis, whereas the combination of being
obese with BED was associated with the number of physical
conditions reported by Hispanics. With regard to social inter-
action, Figure 2 displays how the ethnic groups differed on
reported impairment. For Hispanic and black individuals, the
presence of BED was clearly associated with the level of impair-
ment reported whereas this was not true for white individuals
(for whom the obese BED group reported the most impair-
ment). In addition, the Hispanics with BED reported the most
impairment of any group. There were also two nonsignificant
trends where ethnicity influenced the relationship between
BED by obesity status on cognitive impairment (P < 0.004),
and mobility (P < 0.007; results not displayed). For cognitive

impairment, lifetime diagnosis of BED was associated with the
level of impairment reported for all ethnic groups; however,
the impact of BED was greater for Hispanics than any other
group. For mobility, lifetime diagnosis of BED was associated
with the level of impairment reported by black individuals,
whereas weight status influenced the level of impairment for
all other ethnic groups.
Discussion
The objective of this study was to expand on existing research
by examining the relationship between obesity status, BED
diagnosis, and QOL in a large, ethnically diverse community
sample of adult men and women. Results revealed that obes-
ity status was more strongly associated with impairment in
physical health-related QOL, whereas lifetime BED diagno-
sis was more strongly associated with impairment in mental
health and social functioning related QOL. These findings
have important clinical significance. For example, a relatively
large percentage of obese participants with BED noted severe
time out of role impairment (which indicates impairment
in the ability to complete everyday tasks such as household
chores): Approximately 23% of obese individuals with BED,
14% of nonobese individuals with BED, 9% of obese individu-
als without BED, and 6% of the nonobese individuals without
BED reported severe impairment (score of 70 or greater). In
addition, 2% of individuals in the obese with BED group, 1%
in the nonobese with BED group, 0.2% in the obese without
BED, and 0.2% in the nonobese without BED reported severe
impairment in their ability to care for themselves. Both obesity
and lifetime BED diagnosis increased the likelihood of experi-
encing impairment in QOL, with the presence of both leading
to the worst impairment. When comparing the nonobese with
lifetime BED diagnosis and obese without BED diagnosis, the
nonobese with lifetime BED diagnosis reported more impair-
ment across more domains of functioning. It is important to
note that 52% of the sample with lifetime BED diagnosis had
not met criteria within the past year suggesting that QOL may
continue to be impaired long after the disorder remits. These
results from this study also lend some support to the clinical
utility of BED when assessing QOL.
With regard to ethnicity, although the patterns discussed
above were generally consistent across ethnic groups, some
interesting findings emerged. The black group reported the
most physical conditions and the Hispanic group reported
the most impairment in social interaction. With regards to
number of physical conditions, diagnostic status was more
influential than weight status for black individuals, whereas the
reverse tended to be true for Hispanics and whites. However,
it is important to note that the black group had a higher per-
centage of individuals meeting criteria for BED within the past
12 months than the other racial groups which could be driv-
ing these two findings. Diagnostic status was more influential
in impairment of social interaction for the minority groups,
whereas weight status was more influential in the white group.
Aside from these differences, there were more similarities than
differences across ethnic groups.
Another interesting observation was a discrepancy between
perception of mental health and actual mental health that
emerged among the minority groups. For black and Hispanic
participants, comorbid mental health conditions were higher
in BED groups than non-BED groups. However, on self-per-
ception of mental health, all groups rated their mental health
between "good" and "very good" (on average). Among the
white group, the BED groups reported more mental health
conditions and poorer perception of mental health than the
non-BED groups. This finding is consistent with a recent study
where more than half of black participants and one-third of
Hispanic participants who described themselves as "slightly"
overweight would be classified as obese based on BMI (19).
Furthermore, despite their weight status, 72% of blacks and
62% of Hispanics in the sample reported their overall health
was good to excellent. The authors concluded that despite
the greater self-reported prevalence of certain risk factors for
poor health, blacks and Hispanics had a more optimistic view
of their overall health and weight status than was objectively
supported. Additionally, in the clinical treatment literature,
research suggests that ethnic minority individuals are less
likely to attribute mild and moderate emotional problems to
mental health, and that the perception of poor mental health
leads to treatment seeking (19) despite general underutiliza-
tion of treatment by many ethnic minority groups (15,20,25).
Future research should continue to explore the influence of
ethnicity on the relationships between perception of mental
health, severity of mental health symptoms, and treatment
seeking among minorities.
There are several important limitations to this study that
should be considered when examining these data. In this
study, QOL was assessed through items asked on different
domains of functioning and disability instead of through a
psychometrically evaluated instrument or an obesity-specific
measure of QOL, which would have enriched the data. Data
on BED and comorbid psychiatric diagnoses were gathered
retrospectively, making the data subject to recall bias which
may limit the generalizability and comparison of this study
to past research that investigated QOL among eating disor-
dered and obese individuals. The structured clinical interview
used to diagnose BED implements skip rules signifying that
individuals have to positively endorse screener items in order
to receive the BED module. It is unknown if screener items
are biased where ethnic minority individuals are less likely to
endorse items indicating that the sample in this study would
be an under-representation of BED (29). Additionally, despite
the large representative sample of ethnic minority individuals
in this dataset, relatively few minority individuals were diag-
nosed with BED (e.g., 40 nonobese BED and 41 obese BED
Hispanics; 38 nonobese BED, and 55 obese BED black indi-
viduals) which may have influenced statistical power and the
representativeness of the sample. Furthermore, although Asian
participants were included in the main dataset, the sample had
too few obese Asian individuals with BED to assess the perti-
nent variables on this group separately. It is also important to
note this study is cross-sectional in nature; although analyses

were framed with BED diagnosis and obesity as predictors and
QOL as the dependent variable, it is possible that QOL can also
impact obesity and psychiatric symptoms.
Despite these limitations, results from this study suggest that
weight status is associated with physical health and physical func-
tioning. However, these data also suggest that BED can be associ-
ated with QOL above and beyond obese weight status in certain
domains of functioning, such as social interaction, and cognitive
impairment. Obese individuals with BED reported the poorest
QOL across all domains. Consequently, treatment strategies for
BED and obesity aimed at relief of distress and dysfunction due
to both weight-status and eating pathology may improve QOL
among obese individuals of diverse ethnic groups (30).
