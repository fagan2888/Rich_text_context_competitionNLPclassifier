Relation of Serum Ascorbic Acid to Serum Vitamin B12
,
Serum Ferritin, and Kidney Stones in US Adults
Joel A. Simon, MD, MPH; Esther S. Hudes, PhD, MPH
Background: Concern has been raised that high levels
of ascorbic acid consumption may lead to potential ad-
verse effects, such as vitamin B12
deficiency, iron over-
load, and kidney stones.
Objective: To examine the relation of serum ascorbic
acid level, which reflects intake, to serum vitamin B12
level,
serum ferritin level, and kidney stones.
Methods: We analyzed data collected on a random
sample of the US population enrolled in the Second Na-
tional Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 1976-
1980. We analyzed data using linear and logistic regres-
sion models. Serum ascorbic acid, serum vitamin B12
,
hemoglobin, red blood cell mean corpuscular volume
(MCV), and serum ferritin levels were measured using
standardized protocols. History of kidney stones was de-
termined by self-report.
Results: After multivariate adjustment, serum ascorbic
acid level was associated with higher serum vitamin B12
levels among women in regression models that assumed
a linear relationship; each 57-µmol/L (1.0-mg/dL) in-
crease in serum ascorbic acid level (range, 6-153 µmol/L
[0.1 to 2.7 mg/dL]) was independently associated with
a serum vitamin B12
level increase of 60 pmol/L (81 pg/
mL) (P.001). Among men, serum ascorbic acid level
was marginally associated with higher serum vitamin B12
levels: each 57-µmol/L (1.0-mg/dL) increase in serum
ascorbic acid level was associated with a serum vitamin
B12
level increase of 27 pmol/L (36 pg/mL) (P = .10). In
addition, serum ascorbic acid level was not associated with
correlates of vitamin B12
deficiency, such as higher MCV
levels, macrocytosis (MCV 100), or lower hemoglo-
bin concentrations. Serum ascorbic acid level was not in-
dependently associated with serum ferritin levels. How-
ever, among women only, serum ascorbic acid levels were
associated in a nonlinear fashion with prevalence of el-
evated serum ferritin levels (P = .02). We found no as-
sociation between serum ascorbic acid level and preva-
lence of kidney stones in women or men (both P.05).
Conclusions: Serum ascorbic acid levels were not asso-
ciated with decreased serum vitamin B12
levels (or indica-
tors of vitamin B12
deficiency), prevalence of kidney stones,
serum ferritin levels, or--among men--prevalence of el-
evatedserumferritinlevels.Serumascorbicacidlevelswere
associated with prevalence of elevated serum ferritin lev-
els among women. Although the clinical relevance of these
findings is uncertain, it seems prudent to suggest that
womenwithageneticsusceptibilitytoironoverloadshould
consider moderating their intake of ascorbic acid.

To examine the relation of blood

that surveyed a large random sample of the
American population.
RESULTS
Baseline characteristics of women and men
are presented in Table 1. Men had higher
dietary iron intakes and serum ferritin lev-
els compared with women but roughly
comparable serum vitamin B12
levels. Ap-
proximately 3% of women and 5% of men
reported a history of kidney stones. Preva-
lence of high serum ferritin levels was ap-

pected, participants with the highest serum ascorbic acid
levels were more likely to report such use. Approxi-
mately 1% of participants in the lowest serum ascorbic
acid quintile used supplements compared with 6% to 12%
of participants in the highest quintile. Mean dietary ascor-
bic acid intakes for women and men were 94 mg/d and
105 mg/d, respectively.
We examined whether serum ascorbic acid level was
associated with serum vitamin B12
level in several models
(Table 2). In univariate, age-adjusted, and multivariate
models, serum ascorbic acid level was associated with
higher serum levels of vitamin B12
in women; in the mul-
tivariate model, each 57-µmol/L (1.0-mg/dL) increase in

METHODS
SUBJECTS
NHANES II was a national probability survey of more than
20 000 Americans conducted between 1976 and 1980.19 Par-
ticipants, whose age ranged from 3 to 74 years, were in-
terviewed and examined by study personnel at 2 visits.19
We analyzed data from adult participants between the ages
of 20 and 74 years. Data were available from 10 735 par-
ticipants who answered questions regarding a history of
kidney stones. Serum vitamin B12
levels and serum ferritin
levels were available for 1798 participants and 3407 par-
ticipants, respectively.
MEASUREMENTS
NHANES II questionnaire data included self-reported age,
race, sex, menopausal status, years of education com-
pleted, level of leisure time physical activity, history of smok-
ing, level of alcohol intake, gout, and use of diuretic medi-
cations, hormones, and nutritional supplements. Nutrition
data were collected using a food frequency questionnaire
and 24-hour diet recall. We calculated body mass index (a
measure of weight in kilograms divided by the square of
height in meters) from weight and height data recorded dur-
ing the physical examination. The questionnaires, dietary
methods, and examination procedures used in NHANES
II have been described elsewhere in detail.19
Serum ascorbic acid levels were measured at the Cen-
ters for Disease Control and Prevention by the dinitrophenyl-
hydrazine method using a standardized protocol.20 Be-
cause there were a small number of extreme serum ascorbic
acid values of questionable validity (ranging as high as 1028
µmol/L [18.1 mg/dL]), we excluded participants with ascor-
bic acid levels in the top 0.5% of the sample (n = 54). Ascor-
bic acid levels for the remaining 99.5% of the participants
ranged from 6 to 153 µmol/L (0.1-2.7 mg/dL).
Serum vitamin B12
levels were measured in a sub-
group of participants using the radioassay method de-
scribed by Gunter et al20 and Lau et al.21 Serum ferritin lev-
els were measured at the University of Kansas Medical
Center, Kansas City. For both serum vitamin B12
and se-
rum ferritin assays, a subsample of persons was selected
as follows: all persons whose NHANES II numbers ended
in 8 and persons with 1 or more abnormal hematologic val-
ues (red blood cell count, hemoglobin, hematocrit, red blood
cell mean corpuscular volume [MCV], white blood cell
count). An additional ferritin subsample of participants was
also randomly chosen at the end of the survey for ferritin
analysis.22 A 2-site immunoradiometric assay was per-
formed and samples with high serum ferritin levels (200
µg/L) and low serum ferritin levels (20 µg/L) were reas-
sayed.22,23 To identify participants with elevated serum fer-
ritin levels, we used the age- and sex-specific cut points
published by the NHANES II Expert Scientific Working
Group on iron status of the US population.22 These cut points
were more than 200 µg/L in men and more than 150 µg/L
in women aged 20 to 44 years; more than 300 µg/L in men
and 200 µg/L in women aged 45 to 64 years; and more than
400 µg/L in men and more than 300 µg/L in women aged
65 to 74 years.22
A history of kidney stones was established by a posi-
tive response to either of the following 2 questions: "Have
you ever had kidney stones?" and "Did a doctor ever tell
you that you had kidney stones or stones in the ureter?"
STATISTICAL METHODS
We examined the distribution of ascorbic acid concentra-
tions and other variables of interest using sample weights.
We used simple and multiple linear regression models to
examine the relation of serum ascorbic acid level to serum
vitamin B12
level, hemoglobin concentration, MCV, and se-
rum ferritin level. For the dichotomous outcomes, ie, pres-
ence of elevated serum ferritin levels and kidney stones,
we used simple and multiple logistic regression models.
Level of education, level of physical activity, and alcohol
consumption were analyzed as ordinal variables in the mul-
tivariate models.
Analyses were performed using Stata software that in-
cluded survey commands for the analysis of complex sur-
vey data.24 We calculated linear regression coefficients and
95% confidence intervals (CIs) to estimate differences in
serum vitamin B12
level, hemoglobin concentration, MCV,
and serum ferritin level associated with each 57-µmol/L (1.0-
mg/dL) increase in serum ascorbic acid level. Odds ratios
and their 95% CIs were calculated using logistic regres-
sion to estimate the relative prevalence of elevated serum
ferritin levels and kidney stones. Hosmer-Lemeshow good-
ness-of-fit tests25 modified for weighted data were per-
formed using a SAS macro program.26 Two-tailed P values
of .05 were considered to be statistically significant, unad-
justed for multiple comparisons.27
Figures examining the relation of serum ascorbic acid
level to serum vitamin B12
level and hemoglobin concen-
tration were calculated using linear and quadratic coeffi-
cients derived from linear regression models. Predicted lev-
els of the outcome variables were calculated within each
6-µmol/L (0.1-mg/dL) serum ascorbic acid level and the low-
ess smoothing procedure was applied to produce the plots.28
Figures that examined the association between serum ascor-
bic acid level and prevalence of elevated serum ferritin level
were used to plot the adjusted prevalence of elevated se-
rum ferritin level as a function of serum ascorbic acid level.
Logistic coefficients were used to compute individual pre-
dicted probability of elevated serum ferritin level. Next, we
computed the mean of these probabilities within each 6-
µmol/L (0.1-mg/dL) serum ascorbic acid level and then ap-
plied the lowess smoothing procedure to produce the plots.28

a serum vitamin B12
level increase of 60 pmol/L (81 pg/
mL) in women (P.001). Among men, each 57-µmol/L
(1.0-mg/dL) increase in serum ascorbic acid level was mar-
ginally associated with a serum vitamin B12
level increase
of 27 pmol/L (36 pg/mL) (P = .10). Multivariate models
controlled for the effects of a number of variables, includ-
ing age, race, smoking, alcohol consumption, and use of
vitamin B supplements. Because we also identified signifi-
cant curvilinear relations between serum ascorbic acid and
serum vitamin B12
levels (P = .09 in men and .04 in wom-
en) and because the proportion of variance explained by
both the linear and nonlinear models was almost identi-
cal, we also present these relations using models contain-
ing linear and quadratic terms (Figure 1).
Less than 1% of participants had low serum vita-
min B12
levels (221 pmol/L [300 pg/mL]) consistent with
vitamin B12
deficiency. Serum ascorbic acid level was as-
sociated with a decreased prevalence of low serum vita-
min B12
levels in women (P = .001) but was not associ-
ated with prevalence of low serum vitamin B12
levels in
men (P = .58). Because the assay used in NHANES II can-
not distinguish between active and inactive analogs of
vitamin B12
, we also examined whether serum ascorbic
acid levels were associated with indicators of vitamin B12
deficiency, such as hemoglobin concentration, red blood
cell MCV, and macrocytosis (MCV 100). Among par-
ticipants in whom measurements of serum vitamin B12
were performed, we found no association between se-
rum ascorbic acid level and hemoglobin concentrations
in men (P = .34) but found a significant curvilinear re-
lation among women (P = .001) (Figure 2). We also ex-
amined whether serum ascorbic acid level was a corre-
late of red blood cell MCV and prevalence of macrocytosis.
Serum ascorbic acid level was not associated with either
MCV or macrocytosis in women or men (all P.08). Fur-
thermore, self-reported ascorbic acid supplement use was
not independently associated with serum vitamin B12
lev-
els in either women (P = .92) or men (P = .11).
We also assessed the relation between serum ascor-
bic acid and ferritin levels (Table 3). In univariate mod-
els, serum ascorbic acid level was significantly associ-
ated with serum ferritin level among women (P.01) but
not among men (P = .99) The association between ascor-
bic acid and iron status among women was attenuated
after multivariate adjustment (P = .05) and further at-
tenuated after controlling for the additional effects of
menopausal status and hormone use (P = .14). Serum
ascorbic acid level was not associated with elevated se-
rum ferritin levels in men (P = .59) (Table 4) but was
independently associated in a nonlinear fashion with el-
evated serum ferritin levels in women (P = .02)

levels (116 µmol/L [2.1 mg/dL]) had an approxi-
mately 2-fold increase in prevalence of elevated serum
ferritin levels compared with women whose serum ascor-
bic acid levels ranged between 43 and 80 µmol/L (0.8 and
1.4 mg/dL). Ascorbic acid supplement use was not in-
dependently associated with serum ferritin levels or el-
evated serum ferritin levels among men (P = .34 and .83,
respectively). Among women, there was no indepen-
dent association between ascorbic acid supplement use
and serum ferritin levels (P = .81), but we did observe a
trend toward a lower prevalence of elevated serum fer-
ritin levels with supplement use (P = .08).
Approximately 3% of women and 5% of men re-
ported a history of kidney stones. Serum ascorbic acid
level was not associated with an increased prevalence of
kidney stones in women (multivariate odds ratio = 0.78;
95% CI, 0.56-1.10; P = .15). A marginally significant in-
verse association was observed between serum ascorbic
acid level and kidney stones in men (multivariate odds
ratio, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.51-1.02; P = .06) (Table 5). No
data were available regarding the chemical composition
of the self-reported kidney stones. Ascorbic acid supple-
ment use was not independently associated with preva-
lence of kidney stones in either women (P = .87) or men
(P = .46).
COMMENT
Concern has been expressed that high levels of ascorbic
acid consumption may be placing many Americans at risk
for adverse health outcomes, such as vitamin B12
defi-
ciency, iron overload, and kidney stones.5,6 Several stud-
ies that have examined these issues were performed in a
laboratory setting 5,16-18 or on small numbers of sub-
jects.7,9-15 Among a representative sample of the adult US
population surveyed between 1976 and 1980, we found
no evidence that higher serum ascorbic acid levels re-
sulting from ascorbic acid consumption adversely af-
fected serum vitamin B12
levels, prevalence of kidney
stones, or, among men, prevalence of elevated serum fer-
ritin levels. We did, however, find a nonlinear relation
between serum ascorbic acid level and prevalence of el-
evated serum ferritin levels among women, which ap-
peared similar to the relation between serum ascorbic acid
level and hemoglobin concentration among women.
SERUM VITAMIN B12
LEVELS
Using the same vitamin B12
radioassay used in NHANES
II, Herbert and Jacob5 reported that the addition of ascor-
bic acid to homogenized test meals resulted in the destruc-
tion of vitamin B12
. These findings, however, could not be
replicated.16 Herbert and colleagues11 later reported that 4
of 18 patients with spinal cord injury who received 2 g/d
of ascorbic acid for periods up to several years were vita-
min B12
deficient. Others, however, have judged these find-
ings to be, at least in part, the result of an artifact of the
assay used to measure vitamin B12
levels.2 Examination of
the relation of high intakes of ascorbic acid in 10 patients
with spinal cord injury29 and among 40 children with my-
elomeningoceles30 failed to reveal an association between
ascorbic acid and vitamin B12
deficiency. To our knowl-
edge, there have been no large population-based studies
examining the relation of ascorbic acid to vitamin B12
sta-
tus. We found no evidence that serum ascorbic acid levels
are associated inversely with serum vitamin B12
levels. On
the contrary, it appeared that higher ascorbic acid serum
levels were, on average, associated with higher serum vi-
tamin B12
levels among women and men. These findings
could be the result of a correlated intake of these nutri-
ents, either in the diet or in nutritional supplements.
SERUM FERRITIN LEVELS
Although serum ferritin levels may be elevated as a con-
sequence of inflammatory conditions, they generally re-
flect total body iron stores and are considered the best mea-
suretoassessironstatusinepidemiologicstudies.31 Ascorbic
acidenhancestheabsorptionofnonhemeiron32 and,there-
fore, may aid in the treatment of iron-deficiency anemia.
However, ascorbic acid may be detrimental to individuals
who carry the gene for hemochromatosis.8 In assessing the
prevalence of elevated serum ferritin levels based on age-
and sex-specific cut points,22 we found no association be-
tween ascorbic acid and prevalence of elevated serum fer-
ritin levels among men but observed a nonlinear relation
among women. To our knowledge, the relation between

nonrandomized study of 17 healthy college students re-
vealed no adverse effect from high-dose ascorbic acid in-
gestion (2 g/d) on serum ferritin levels and iron stores.14
The clinical significance of our findings in women is un-
certain. Several reviews have concluded that, for most in-
dividuals, high levels of ascorbic acid consumption are
safe.2-4 Furthermore, other analyses of NHANES data have
reported improved health outcomes and lower mortality
rates among individuals with high serum or intake levels
of ascorbic acid.33-35
KIDNEY STONES
Most kidney stones are composed of calcium oxalate or
uric acid. Although not observed uniformly,12,36,37 some
studies have reported that urinary oxalate and uric acid
excretion are increased by the ingestion or administra-
tion of large amounts of ascorbic acid.2 Studies that ex-
amined the relation of ascorbic acid to oxalate and uric
acid excretion have generally examined small numbers
of subjects.2 We were able to examine the relation of se-
rum ascorbic acid level to history of kidney stones among
a random sample of more than 10 000 Americans and
found no evidence to indicate that high serum ascorbic
acid levels increased the prevalence of kidney stones. On
the contrary, among men, each 57-µmol/L (1.0-mg/dL)
increase in serum ascorbic acid level was independently
associated with an approximately 28% decrease in the
prevalence of kidney stones (P = .06). These findings agree
with the conclusions of others2 that in general, high lev-
els of ascorbic acid ingestion do not result in increased
kidney stone formation and may, in fact, be associated
with a decreased prevalence of kidney stones.38
The main limitation of our study derives from the
cross-sectional nature of the analyses. Thus, we cannot be
certain that the outcomes did not affect ascorbic acid con-
sumption and, in turn, serum ascorbic acid levels. For ex-
ample, it is possible that persons with kidney stone dis-
ease decreased their ascorbic acid intake and consequently
lowered their blood ascorbic acid level, thereby produc-
ing the ostensible protective association between ascor-
bic acid and kidney stones. Although we cannot exclude
this possibility, it is also biologically plausible that ascor-
bic acid may, in fact, lower the risk of kidney stones by
decreasing urinary calcium excretion.13 Because most
people are unlikely to know their serum ferritin level or
vitamin B12
level, it seems less probable that these asso-
ciations resulted from individuals changing their ascor-
bic acid intake. The serum vitamin B12
radiodilution as-
say used by NHANES II measures both biologically active
and inactive vitamin B12
analogs.39 Hence, we cannot be
certain that the higher levels of serum vitamin B12
associ-
ated with serum ascorbic acid levels reflect higher levels
of the biologically active form of the vitamin. However,

examination of the reliability of the serum vitamin B12
ra-
diodilution assay, when compared with the microbio-
logic vitamin B12
assay, suggests that the comparative rank
order of serum values is likely to be similar across as-
says.40 Higher serum ascorbic acid levels were not associ-
ated with lower hemoglobin concentrations, higher red
blood cell MCVs, or increased prevalence of macrocyto-
sis, which further suggests that serum ascorbic acid lev-
els, which reflect ascorbic acid intake, are unlikely to be
associated with decreased serum levels of biologically ac-
tive vitamin B12
. Although serum ascorbic acid levels re-
flect intake patterns over days to weeks,41 we had only a
single measurement of serum ascorbic acid, which may
not reflect longer-term intake. Finally, because the geno-
type of participants is not known, we cannot comment on
the relation of serum ascorbic acid levels to elevated se-
rum ferritin levels among individuals categorized by their
genetic susceptibility to iron overload.
There are 2 notable strengths to these analyses. First,
NHANES II surveyed a large random sample of the US
population using standardized procedures and proto-
cols. Hence, our findings should be generalizable. Sec-
ond, the measurement of serum ascorbic acid levels on
such a large number of persons provides a more accu-
rate and precise assessment of ascorbic acid status as a
correlate of serum vitamin B12
level, serum ferritin level,
and history of kidney stones than studies using dietary
and supplement estimates only.
Establishing the safety of high levels of ascorbic acid
ingestionisofpublichealthimportanceinviewofthelarge

serum levels, reflecting a broad range of ascorbic acid in-
takes,donotadverselyaffectvitaminB12
