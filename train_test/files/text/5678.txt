More Health Expenditure, Better
Economic Performance? Empirical
Evidence From OECD Countries
Fuhmei Wang, PhD1
Abstract
Recent economic downturns have led many countries to reduce health spending dramatically, with the World Health
Organization raising concerns over the effects of this, in particular among the poor and vulnerable. With the provision of
appropriate health care, the population of a country could have better health, thus strengthening the nation's human capital,
which could contribute to economic growth through improved productivity. How much should countries spend on health
care? This study aims to estimate the optimal health care expenditure in a growing economy. Applying the experiences of
countries from the Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD) over the period 1990 to 2009, this
research introduces the method of system generalized method of moments (GMM) to derive the design of the estimators
of the focal variables. Empirical evidence indicates that when the ratio of health spending to gross domestic product (GDP)
is less than the optimal level of 7.55%, increases in health spending effectively lead to better economic performance. Above
this, more spending does not equate to better care. The real level of health spending in OECD countries is 5.48% of GDP,
with a 1.87% economic growth rate. The question which is posed by this study is a pertinent one, especially in the current
context of financially constrained health systems around the world. The analytical results of this work will allow policymakers
to better allocate scarce resources to achieve their macroeconomic goals.

Introduction
The global financial crisis has led many countries to reduce
spending dramatically, with health care being a common target
of such reductions. However, the provision of health care is
important for improving a population's health, which in turn can
lead to more productivity, better economic performance, and
then more fiscal resources. However, could better economic
performance be achieved through more health spending? The
findings of the current literature with regard to the influences of
health expenditure on economic growth are ambiguous.1,2 How
much should countries spend on health care?3 Previous research
has not suggested the optimal level of health expenditure using
empirical evidence. The current study thus aims to investigate
whether raising health expenditure can effectively improve eco-
nomic performance, and so it also aims to find the optimal level
of health expenditure to maximize economic growth.
Methods and Specifications
Existing studies have examined various aspects of the
health expenditure­economic growth nexus. However, the
historical and institutional backgrounds of each country
are unique, and thus the question is a rather complex one.
An empirical methodology that controls for cross-country
variations in certain political and economic institutional
characteristics, and successfully deals with differences
across countries, would be able to offer a better framework
for statistical inferences. The use of simple ordinary least
squares (OLS) estimation could lead to biased and incon-
sistent parameter estimates, due to regressor endogeneity.
This article overcomes these issues by introducing the gen-
eralized method of moments (GMM) technique to derive
the design of the estimators of interest.4,5

2 INQUIRY
Subjects
Health expenditure in developed countries has risen faster
than gross domestic product (GDP). Organization for
Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD) coun-
tries are all developed nations. The well-established social
security systems in these counties have contributed to
improvements in the health of their populations, although
this has also caused a fast rise in health expenditure. This
research provides rigorous scientific examinations to exam-
ine the following issues: (1) how health expenditure affects
an economy's GDP growth, (2) whether there is an optimal
ratio of health expenditure relative to GDP, and (3) whether
and how the other factors influence economic performance.
The results could be used to derive the appropriate health
expenditure level to obtain better economic performance and
social well-being.
Analytical Framework
The Grossman model has yielded considerable insights into
the determinants of health, as well as into the allocation of
time and money into health production.6 The working hours
and productivities of workers in poor health both decline,
and this is one economic side effect of a health care policy.7,8
A key premise of the literature is that good health enhances
worker productivity and improves economic outputs.9,10
Human capital can only be productive if it is healthy.
Health expenditures thus influence economic growth by
improving and enhancing productivity. The production func-
tion of per capita GDP(y) could be a function of health
expenditure (h) and a vector (X) of public services and socio-
economic variables that affect real per capita GDP:
y f h
= ( , ).
X (1)
Empirical Tests
Economic growth rates depend on the combined influences
of several factors, rather than just one or two key elements.
Provision of health services requires the use of public
resources. At the macroeconomic level, there is a potential
trade-off between health and other public expenditures that
may affect economic performance. An increase in the ratio of
health expenditure to GDP affects economic performance
through two channels. The first is due to the crowding out
effect, whereby an increase in health expenditure reduces
expenditure on other public spending, which might also be
able to improve productivity. This channel tends to reduce
economic growth. The second channel is related to the effects
of improvements in public health, whereby an increase in
health spending tends to improve the productivity of work-
ers. This channel leads to better economic performance. The
net effect of a rise in health expenditure on economic growth
depends on the relative strength of these two channels.
Obviously, a rise in the share of health expenditure favors
(deters) the economic growth rate if it improves (deterio-
rates) workers' health. The relationship between health
expenditure and economic growth may be non-linear, and
this issue needs to be examined. This research then tries to
find the optimal level of health expenditure. The model used
here is typical of economic growth determinant models, and
is as follows: 11

are composed of socio-economic
and demographic explanatory variables. Our primary interest
is how health expenditure affects economic growth, and
whether other factors influence this relationship.
Econometric Method
GMM has been widely applied by researchers, to examine
subjects as diverse as financial and economic issues to public
health studies on the effects of AIDS deaths on households
since the 1990s.5 This econometric technique is specifically
designed to extract causal lessons from data or observations
(whether countries, hospitals, or patients), each of which is
observed only annually over 5 or 10 years, as well as to resolve
the issue of multicollinearity between explanatory variables.
Data Description
Applying the experiences of OECD countries, the panel
datasets of the dependent and explanatory variables are
observed over the period from 1990 to 2009, thus excluding
the global financial crisis that arose after this. The following
socio-economic and demographic explanatory variables are
examined: the ratio of health expenditure relative to GDP;
the square of the ratio of health expenditure relative to GDP;
the ratios of military expenditure, education expenditure, and
government consumption expenditure to GDP; the tax rate;
the growth rate of the college enrollment rate; the inflation
rate; the openness and the corruption indexes; the develop-
ment index; the aggregate birth rate; the population; the ratio
of young people in the population; the ratio of elderly people
in the population; and the per capita GDP growth rate for the
last period in logarithmic form. The survey data are collected
from World Development Indicator for the period from 1990
to 2009. Table 1 summarizes the descriptive statistics and
Figure 1 presents a scatter plot showing the relationship
between government health expenditure and the economic
growth rate over the period 1990 to 2009.

After identifying the factors that might affect the per cap-
ita GDP growth rate in log form and by applying the GMM
estimators in STATA 10.0 to the survey data, this research
further estimates the significance of the coefficients corre-
sponding to each of the above-mentioned explanatory
variables.
Results
The GMM estimated results for per capita GDP growth rates
in log form, as well as for the other variables, are presented
in Table 2. The results for AR(1), AR(2), and the Sargan test
are 0, 0.876, and 0.051, respectively, and indicate that the
selection of variables is valid, the estimation equation is cor-
rectly specified, and the estimation results are robust.
Based on Table 2, the growth rate of the college enroll-
ment rate, the corruption index, the development index, the
aggregate birth rate, and per capita GDP growth rate in log
form of the last period all statistically and significantly influ-
ence per capita GDP growth rate. Multiplying the coeffi-
cients of these socio-economic explanatory variables by the
respective mean values from the summary statistics in Table
1 and adding them up to the constant term yields the specifi-
cations of Equation (3), and this can then be used to explore
the exact relationship between health expenditure and eco-
nomic performance. The main concern of this study is to
explore how health expenditure affects economic perfor-
mance. The impact of health expenditure on economic per-
formance is estimated as follows:

where h presents the ratio of health expenditure to GDP.
Figure 2 presents the estimated graph, and shows the rela-
tionship between health spending and economic growth is
non-linear. When the ratio of health spending to GDP is less
(more) than the optimal level of 7.55%, increases in health
spending are associated with faster (slower) economic
growth. The maximum economic growth is 3%. The real
level of health spending is 5.48% of GDP in OECD coun-
tries, and the economic growth rate is 1.87% over the period
1990 to 2009.
Discussion
In general, people with better health are capable of produc-
ing more goods and services than those in poor health,

leading to faster economic growth. Nevertheless, an increase
in health expenditure, which could improve the health of the
workforce, might crowd out other expenditure, such as
spending on infrastructure inputs, that could also stimulate
economic growth. The impact of increases in health expendi-
ture on economic growth is thus ambiguous.
Over the coming decades both developing and industrial-
ized countries will face sharp rises in health expenditure, as
well as other long-term health care challenges, because of
their aging populations. Our findings indicate that it is worth-
while for governments to increase investment in health until it
reaches an optimal level to achieve greater economic develop-
ment. The Dartmouth Atlas project and researchers agree that
more spending on health does not necessarily equate to better
care.12-14 The current study challenges the assumption that
increased spending in health care is inevitable and unavoid-
able, and tries to find the effective level of health spending for
stimulating economic growth, while also improving the popu-
lation's well-being. Based on empirical evidence from OECD
countries, when the ratio of health spending to GDP is less
than the optimal level of 7.55%, increases in health spending
effectively lead to better economic performance. Otherwise,
such spending does not cause improvements in care. With the
provision of appropriate health care, the population could have
better health, and thus a nation's human capital would be
stronger and better able to contribute to economic growth
through improved productivity.15
Recent economic downturns tend to have the greatest
effects on working age adults.TheWorld Health Organization
has raised concern over the financial crisis' impact on global
health, in particular among the poor and vulnerable.7,8
Furthermore, this article finds that increases in the ratio of
the elderly people in the population do not affect economic
growth significantly. Our findings reflect that appropriate
spending on health care supports economic development.
The overarching empirical question that is posed by this
research is a pertinent one, especially in the context of the
financially constrained health systems that now operate
around the world, which are being squeezed by multiple
developments, including (1) a financial squeeze due to the
global economic downturn, (2) rapidly expanding and
increasingly costly treatment regimes, and (3) rapidly aging
populations. It is thus more crucial than ever to carry out an
appropriate policy analysis at the macroeconomic level,
which will allow policymakers to better allocate scarce
resources in the public sector. In future work, we shall inves-
tigate the impact of preventative health care on a nation's
health and economic performance, through its effects on
improved health and productivity, as well as reduced future
demand for health care and possible reductions in health
expenditure. This issue is important, as the knowledge gained
from such research could help reduce the deficits in public
budgets caused by expensive health systems.
