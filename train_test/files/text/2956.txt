PROFIT SHIFTING IN THE EU:
EVIDENCE FROM GERMANY
Abstract
The paper considers profit shifting behavior using data on German inbound and outbound
FDI. It finds an empirical correlation between the home country tax rate of a parent and the
net of tax profitability of its German affiliate that is consistent with profit shifting behavior.
For profitable affiliates that are directly owned by a foreign investor the evidence suggests
that a 10 percentage point increase in the parent's home country tax rate leads to roughly half
a percentage point increase in the profitability of the German affiliate. On the outbound side
of German FDI, the data provides some evidence that tax rate changes in the host country lead
to a stronger change in after-tax profitability for affiliates that are wholly owned, which may
reflect the larger flexibility of these firms in carrying out tax minimizing behavior without
interference of minority owners.

1. Taxes and profit shifting
Tax competition between countries may be conceived of in different ways. A
common conception is that countries or regions employ tax instruments to attract or keep
firms. But even without firm relocation a country may benefit from lowering taxes if this
induces multinational firms to shift taxable profits to this country. Firms may achieve such
income shifting by using prices for intra-company sales that depart from arms' length
conditions, by agreeing on excessive management and overhead fees, by setting non-market
interest rates within a group, etc. There are also limits to profit shifting behavior.
Governments, in particular in high tax countries, may try to limit the allowable transfer
pricing strategies and this may even lead to a double taxation.1 In addition, firms themselves
may find it difficult to set tax efficient prices if this leads to confusion in the accounts of
profit centers and problems in the remuneration of managers (Caves 1982, pp. 246-7), or if
minority shareholders resist.
Starting in the early 1990s, a growing literature has tried to empirically identify tax
motivated profit shifting.2 So far, the studies have almost exclusively concentrated on U.S.
data. The debate has been stirred by Wheeler (1988) und Dworin (1990) with the simple
observation that foreign-owned subsidiaries in the U.S. have a smaller profitability than
genuine U.S. firms. Grubert, Goodspeed und Swenson (1993) showed that at least 50% of
the difference could be explained by the special characteristics of foreign-owned firms. For
example, those firms on average are younger than domestic firms or may have special write-
offs following a foreign takeover. The authors suggest that the reminder of the difference in
profitability is due to profit shifting activities.3 Harris et al. (1993) analyze the profitability
1 Cf. Schjelderup and Weichenrieder (1998), Elitzur and Mintz (1996), or Mansori and Weichenrieder (1999).
2 Useful surveys on profit shifting and related aspects of international tax issues are contained in recent papers
by De Mooji (2005) and Eggert/Haufler (2006).
3 In an unpublished revision of Grubert, Goodspeed und Swenson (1993), Grubert (1997) found a considerably
reduced difference between U.S. and foreign-owned firms.
3
of U.S. parent firms and find that parents with subsidiaries in low-tax countries have a
significantly lower return than parents with high-tax affiliates, which is compatible with
profit shifting activities. Grubert and Mutti (1991) use aggregated data from the Bureau of
Economic Analysis and find that profits on sales of U.S. subsidiaries are higher in low-tax
countries than in high tax countries.4
One of the interesting empirical facts reported in Grubert, Goodspeed und Swenson
(1993) was that in 1987, 37% of all non-financial foreign companies had a profitability in
terms of total assets that was near to zero. Conversely, only 27% of the domestic firms fell
into the same zero range from -2.5% to +2.5%. This issue is taken up in Collins, Kemsley
and Shackelford (1997) who concentrate on a sample of foreign-owned and non foreign-
owned wholesale firms. Their working hypothesis is that if foreign-controlled firms (unlike
domestic firms) target zero profitability, then an (exogenous) increase in sales should go
along with a smaller increase in profitability compared to domestic firms. The reason is that,
while higher sales per se are good for profits, foreign firms would counteract by charging
higher prices on intra-firm trade. The findings of Collins, Kemsley and Shackleford do not
support the view that foreign controlled firms have a significantly weaker correlation
between sales and profits. Based on this observation the authors suggest that systematic
differences between domestic and foreign firms rather than income shifting may be the
reason for the near zero profitability of many foreign-controlled U.S. firms.5
Hines and Rice (1994) use 1982 country level data on U.S. affiliates. Their profit
measure approximates earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT). The empirical results
suggest that a one percentage point increase in the host country tax rate reduces reported
EBIT of U.S. affiliates by some 3 percent. Finally, Huizinga and Laeven (2005) in a recent
paper use a micro data set of European based subsidiaries. Like in Hines and Rice, they
4 U.S. studies using mostly smaller firm samples include Klassen, Lang and Wolfson (1993), Jacob (1996),
Collins and Shackelford (1998), and Rousslang (1997)
5 A recent study that uses a quite different approach is by Bartelsman and Beetsma (2003). Instead of using
specific data on multinationals, however, they consider aggregate industry data of OECD countries to detect
tax effects on the size of value added.
4
consider a cross-section (1999) of firms and study the effect of tax differentials on reported
EBIT. Their findings suggest that, while the estimated tax effect is considerably smaller than
in Hines and Rice, profit shifting implies a significant revenue loss for high tax countries,
Germany in particular.
In this paper, I use the MiDi database of the Deutsche Bundesbank on German
inbound and outbound FDI to empirically detect profit shifting. While the above discussion
of the literature has made clear that there have been several attempts to empirically identify
profit shifting behavior of multinationals, this paper is one of the first micro-based studies
with non-U.S. data.
While there are many potential influences on firm profitability, a first hypothesis is
that the lower the tax rate of a foreign parent is vis a vis the rate that is applicable to its
German affiliate, the more profitable it will be to shift the profits of the affiliate to the home
country of the parent. Therefore the profitability of the German affiliate may be positively
correlated with the home country tax rate. The paper also looks at the effects that the foreign
tax rate has on the profitability of German subsidiaries abroad. A problem here is that the
database of German FDI does only record net-of-tax profits of subsidiaries, which at a given
pre-tax profitability automatically react negatively to a tax rate increase. Therefore the paper
will formulate hypotheses how co-ownership of foreign subsidiaries may influence profit
shifting. Under certain conditions the testable hypothesis can be formulated that tax rate
changes have a more pronounced effect on wholly-owned subsidiaries as compared to non-
wholly owned ones.
The strongest evidence for profit shifting behavior is found for inbound FDI. For
profitable subsidiaries that are directly owned by a foreign investor the evidence suggests
that a 10 percentage point increase in the parent's home country tax rate leads to roughly half
a percentage point increase in the profitability of the German affiliate.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 formulates a stylized
model of profit shifting that will formulate testable hypotheses. Section 3 will briefly
5
introduce the data used in this paper before Section 4 will econometrically analyze German
inbound FDI and Section 5 will look at German outbound investment. Section 6 concludes.
2. A stylized model of profit shifting
One characteristic of the MiDi database, which will be described in more detail in the
next section, is that it collects net of tax profits, but no information on pre-tax profits.
Another issue is that MiDi contains little information on the parent firms apart from
information on their country of origin. In the light of these data limitations, the following
model is set up to develop hypotheses about the observed subsidiaries that indeed can be
tested with the help of the German panel data set.
Consider a multinational with a parent firm in country H that owns a single affiliate
in the destination country D. Country D taxes reported profits at rate tD
. Country H is
assumed to exempt foreign profits earned in country D, but taxes domestic profits (and any
profits that are shifted into country H) at the rate tH
. Since Germany uses an exemption
system towards foreign dividends, this assumption is justified if we think of Germany as the
home country H. In the case where Germany is acting as the host country (D) the assumption
is obviously appropriate in the case of investing countries that also use an exemption system.
If the investing country uses a credit system of taxation, then effective exemption still occurs
if the parent in the home country is in an excessive credit position. An excessive credit
position applies if the foreign taxes underlying the foreign dividends received by a parent
are higher than the taxes that would apply had the parent earned the equivalent income at
home. Since Germany is a high tax host country, such a situation is the norm and a credit
system in the home country of the multinational may then be approximated by an exemption
system.
Let there be a level of "true" profits that would prevail in H and G in the absence of
profit shifting activities (fH
, fD
). The only decision variable of the multinational shall be the
net amount S of profits that is shifted from D to country H. A negative amount of S then
6
indicates profit shifting into D. Shifting profits from a high tax jurisdiction to a low tax
jurisdiction may save taxes but may also imply a cost for the multinational. For example,
special activities may be necessary to hide the profit shifting. I assume that this cost is
incurred by the plant that reduces its profitability. This assumption reflects that legal costs
that arise when inadequate transfer prices are contested by minority shareholders or tax
authorities will occur in the country where profits have been diminished.6 That is, the cost
cH
(S) falls on the parent if the profit is shifting from the home country into D and cD
(T,) is
incurred by the affiliate if the shifting is out of the host country. Here  denotes the fraction
of shares of the host country affiliate that are held by other investors.7 The respective cost is
assumed to be convex in the absolute amount of shifting.
If the shifting is from D to H, then the existence of other investors (who may resist
the manipulations) makes profit shifting increasingly costly, while this is not the case if the
other investors gain from profit shifting.8 Therefore, cH
, unlike cD
, is taken to be independent
of . The assumptions on the shifting cost may be summarized as follows:

From equation (5), the predicted impact of an increase in
H
t is positive: ceteris paribus, a tax
increase abroad should increase the profitability of a German affiliate. For the later empirical
investigation it would be helpful to also have a clear testable prediction about the role of
outside shareholders on the size of this tax effect. But, like in equation (4), the role of
minority shareholders is ambiguous.
Now consider the impact of a change in the tax rate tD

It is useful to summarize the results for Case A (S > 0) in a non-technical
proposition.
PROPOSITION 1: If the profit shifting incentives lead to an upward manipulation of
home country profits and a downward manipulation of profits in the host country,
9
then an increase in the host (home) country tax rate should reduce (increase) reported
profits of the foreign affiliate. It is theoretically unclear how co-ownership influences
the magnitudes of these effects.
Case B: Incentives to shift profits abroad.
If the home country is a high tax country, then the incentives are to shift profits abroad (S <

variable , then the marginal effect of tH

ownership abroad lowers the (absolute) marginal effect of a change in the host country tax.
An intuition behind this is that a fraction of a tax decrease abroad is benefiting other
shareholders of the affiliate, which makes this increase less effective for the decisions of the
multinational. What are the implications for reported net of tax profitability? From the
definition of the affiliate's net of tax profit and cD

When tD
increases net-of-tax profits fall for two reasons. First, an increase in the tax rate
reduces net profitability for a given amount of profit shifting. Second, profit shifting into the
affiliate is reduced. Since net of tax profits, which will be the focus of the econometric
10
analysis, are reduced even in the absence of profit shifting it is important to have a testable
hypothesis on how the slope in equation (10) depends on . If the profit (fD

t Increased co-ownership in this case would reduce the impact of tax rate
changes on profitability. The above results may be summarized in a non-technical way as
follows.
PROPOSITION 2: If the profit shifting incentives lead to a downward manipulation
of home country profits and an upward manipulation of profits in the host country,
then an increase in the host (home) country tax rate should reduce (increase) reported
net-of-tax profits of the foreign affiliate. Under the assumption that pre-tax profits
are not dependent on co-ownership, co-ownership should reduce the effect of the
host country tax rate on reported net of tax profitability.
The two propositions of this section suggest an asymmetry in the effect that co-
ownership has on the amount of shifting. Given that the profit shifting benefits the affiliate,
co-ownership is expected to limit the effect of a tax rate change in the host country on the
amount of profit shifting. Intuitively, co-ownership makes this reaction to tax rate changes
more expensive because co-owners participate in the increased profit. Conversely, co-
ownership does not necessarily dampen the effects of a tax rate increase in the home country
of the parent if the profit shifting is benefiting the parent's profit: while co-ownership per se
increases profit shifting incentives, it also implies a resistance to such behavior if it comes at
a cost to co-owners.
3. The data
German investors owning foreign affiliates are legally required to report on their
foreign operations if it meets mild size and ownership requirements. Conversely, foreign-
controlled affiliates that operate in Germany have to report on these German operations. The
11
firm reports are the basis for the FDI database of the Deutsche Bundesbank (MiDi).10 Most
of the information in the data refers to a set of balance sheet items. On the liability side there
is information on paid-up plus not paid-up equity, capital reserves, loss carry-forwards,
current profits net of taxes, debt, liabilities to affiliated companies, and other liabilities. On
the asset side, information is collected on fixed assets plus intangibles, financial assets
(shares, loans), current assets, and other assets. Important non-balance-sheet items that are
collected by the Bundesbank are sales and employees.
An unusual feature of the MiDi balance sheets is that they contain the yearly profit
after taxes but before dividend distributions as a separate part of the equity of the firm.
Therefore, the balance sheets provide information on profitability despite the fact that the
database does not contain formal profit and loss statements.
Micro data on foreign direct investment are available for years since 1989 but firm
identifiers that allow for the tracing of firms over time are available only from 1996
onwards. Nevertheless, the ability to trace firms over up to 8 years is an important advantage
over other data sources on FDI and can be used to avoid possible biases from cross-section
estimates.
For the purpose of this study, I dropped affiliates if these were either operating in
not-for-profit sectors or were not incorporated. I also excluded affiliates in the banking and
insurance industries and holding companies to avoid problems connected to the very
different balance sheet structure of financial firms. On the outbound side, this results in
117,254 firm-year observations during the period 1996-2003 and the data set includes
10,855 (16,745) firms in 1996 (2003). On the inbound side, I have for the same time span
55230 firm-year observations and 5791 (6988) firms in 1996 (2003).11 Table 1 gives an
10 For a detailed description of MiDi see Lipponer (2003). Ramb and Weichenrieder (2005) use the
Bundesbank data to analyze the financial structure of German inward FDI and Mintz and Weichenrieder
(2005) look at the financing of outward FDI. Buettner and Ruf (2004) use the database to study taxes and
location decisions of German multinationals.
11 I also dropped a limited number of observations for which we failed to collect reliable tax rate information
on the home country (host country) if the affiliate was located in Germany (abroad). Finally, since the legally
applied reporting thresholds varied between 1996 and 2003 I filtered the sample by imposing uniform size
12
impression of the total assets involved. The first two columns summarize the inbound side,
while columns 3 and 4 inform about the magnitudes on the outbound side. In both cases I
decided to follow the Bundesbank convention to separately account for directly and
indirectly held affiliates. On the inbound side, the affiliate is indirectly held if the immediate
investor is a foreign-owned intermediate company that is located in Germany. An affiliate is
directly held if the immediate owner is a foreign investor. The definitions differ a bit on the
outbound side. Here a German-owned foreign affiliate is defined as an indirectly held
participation if the ownership chain contains at least one foreign company between the
German investor and the foreign affiliate. This foreign intermediate company may or may
not be in the country of the ultimate company. Conversely, the affiliate is directly held if no
intermediate foreign company is used.

(ROA) in the 5th, 25th, 50th, 75th, and 95th centile of firms. Again the categories "direct" and
"indirect" are reported separately. Indeed, firms in these categories show a sizeable
difference in ROA when it comes to inbound German FDI. Indirectly held firms have a
lower spread in returns and more often show near zero profitability. If we look at a "near-
zero band" between -2.5% and +2.5% similar to Grubert, Goodspeed und Swenson (1993),
restrictions (total assets 3m for majority participations and 5.1m in the case of minority stakes) during this
period.
13
we find that in 2003 from the total of all directly held affiliates (inbound) 36% fall in this
range, while for the indirectly held firms it is even a majority of some 72%.12

The fact that this high fraction of firms with more or less zero profitability is pretty
constant over the years may fuel the suspicion that advanced tax planning is the reason
12 Grubert, Goodspeed and Swenson use taxable profits (instead of net of tax profits) to total assets to define
the band.
14
behind these figures. However, the high fraction of affiliates with zero profitability among
indirectly held affiliates at least partly results from specific data problems. While the
Bundesbank requests firms to report profits net of taxes but before distributions, some
indirectly held firms may fail to report profits that are transferred to the owner on the basis
of a corporate contract. Under such a corporate contract the dependent company may agree
to transfer all profits and losses to the upper-tier corporation in order to achieve profit and
loss consolidation for tax purposes. Consolidation not only requires the existence of such a
contract. Germany also restricts consolidation of profits and losses within a group to cases in
which a German umbrella company is a majority owner of the dependent firm, i.e. an
ownership chain is necessary to establish a profit transfer agreement. While the Bundesbank
requires firms to report their profits before distribution, I found strong empirical evidence
that many indirectly held firms report figures that are net of profit transfers to the umbrella
company and therefore decided to drop indirectly held firms in the analysis of inbound FDI.
Unlike the data for indirect inbound FDI, the profit data for German outbound investment
presented in Figure 2 show no bunching at zero profitability and the reporting of zero
profitability of indirectly held firms did only weakly correlate with the opportunity to
consolidate profits in the relevant host country. For this reason, indirectly held firms were
kept in the analysis of outbound investment.
4. Profit shifting and the profitability of German inbound FDI
Since during the observed period Germany is a high tax country by international
comparison, the results derived for the case A (see Section 2, S > 0) are considered relevant
for the profitability of inflowing FDI. According to Proposition 1, which assumes profitable
multinationals, the foreign corporate tax rate in the country of the parent is then expected to
positively affect the profitability of a German affiliate. Whether this effect should be
expected to be larger for wholly-owned versus partly-owned affiliates is unclear from
Proposition 1.
15
To test these implications I use a subsample of incorporated non-financial firms in
Germany that on average across all firm observations show a positive profitability. The
endogenous variable is return on assets (ROA), where the return is measured by the net-of-
tax profits after interest payments (but before dividends). Because of the data problems
discussed in Section 3, I concentrate on firms that are directly held by a foreign investor.
Table 2 gives a summary statistics of this sample that contains 3788 firms that on average
are observed over 4.7 years. Despite the fact that the sample is built by excluding firms that
on average show non-positive profitability, the profitability measure shows a huge spread
between -407 percent and 321 percent. To limit the impact of outliers I use a winsorized
variable W_ROA that has been derived by setting the top and the lowest 5% of the
observations to the 5th and 95th percentile of ROA, respectively. The average tax rate in the
home country of the German affiliate is 34.7%.13 WHOLLY is an indicator variable with
value one if the foreign investor holds 100 percent of the German firm and zero otherwise.
This variable is also used to create interactive variables. CT_WHOLLY takes on the value
of the home country tax rate if the affiliate is wholly owned, and zero otherwise.
Analogously, CTGER_WHOLLY results from multiplying the German corporate tax rate
with the variable WHOLLY. DEBT_RATIO is defined as the ratio of debt to total assets that
in some cases exceeds 100 percent. This can occur if the firm under consideration has loss
carry forwards. To limit the impact of those outliers, the regressions use a winsorized
variable, W_DEBT_RATIO.
13 On average, the parent firms of the German affiliates over the observed years experienced a maximum
absolute change in the home country corporate tax rate of 4.4 percentage points. In cases in which investors
from different countries own a German corporation I used the rate for the largest investor. The tax rate
employed includes also average or representative local income taxes. It abstracts from tax base effects since
optimal profit shifting decisions of profitable firms are independent of tax base effects.

Since random effects models did not pass a Hausman test, the tax effects were
estimated using a fixed effects model. Table 3 reports the regression results. The German tax
rate could not be entered in the model as all firms are subject to the same rate in a given year
and year fixed effects are also included. Model (1) starts with a parsimonious specification
using the foreign tax rate, fixed firm and time effects, plus the logarithms of employment,
sales, and fixed assets.14 The variable of prime interest, CT, which measures the corporate
tax rate of the foreign parent, turns out significant at the six percent level. The coefficient of
0.049 implies that an increase in the tax rate of the parent by ten percentage points increases
the return on assets of a German affiliate by approximately half a percentage point, which
amounts to roughly ten percent of the average profitability in the sample. This evidence is in
line with profit shifting behavior and Proposition 1. Employment does not enter
significantly, while sales enter significantly positive. The size of fixed assets enters
negatively, which may result from large depreciation allowances of investing firms.
Model (2) uses the same specification but adds the variable W_DEBT_RATIO. Since
additional debt increases the interest cost of an affiliate, the significant negative coefficient
is in line with expectations. Inclusion of the debt ratio leads only to a small change in the
coefficient of CT. By including the leverage variable the coefficient of CT measures the
effect of the tax rate that prevailed when leverage was held constant. Therefore, changes in
14 To be precise, the value for fixed assets also includes intangible assets as these are compounded in the
Bundesbank questionnaires.
17
the profit shifting activities that are induced by a change in CT seem to result only to a
limited extent from the use of debt. This is in line with the previous observation that the
parent tax rate does not significantly influence the leverage decision of foreign owned
affiliates in Germany (Ramb and Weichenrieder 2005).

presentation, logs have been entered in one tenth of a percent.
According to Proposition 1, the effect of co-owners on the impact of a change in tax
rates is unclear. Models (3) and (4) include variables that are constructed by interacting the
German and the foreign tax rates with the dummy WHOLLY. The objective is to empirically
investigate whether co-ownership matters for the size of the tax effects. The effect of
ownership on the size of the tax effects turns out to be not only theoretically undetermined
but also empirically insignificant. Finally, the insignificance of WHOLLY does not suggest
that the net of tax profitability changes if firms have a change from partial to full ownership
18
by a foreign investor and this is confirmed by employing a formal F-test using all variables
in which the variable WHOLLY is included (p-values are 36% and 54% in equations (3) and
(4)).
6. The profitability of German outbound FDI
I now turn to the outbound side of German FDI. Given the high German tax rates a
major concern is that German multinationals have an incentive to shift profits abroad to
repatriate these profits as a tax free dividend. This is a concern that corresponds to the Case
B in Section 3.
Of course a straightforward approach would be to test whether foreign taxes
influence the pre-tax profitability of German owned foreign affiliates. The problem in doing
so is that the Bundesbank database only contains net-of-tax profits. Therefore, it is
impossible to identify whether a reduction in a foreign affiliate's observed return is due to a
change in profit shifting activities or is simply caused by higher taxation at constant pre-tax
earnings. However, there is another prediction of the model in Section 3 that indeed can be
tested. If the incentives are to shift profits abroad, then, according to Proposition 2, co-
ownership should lead to a reduced impact of the foreign tax rate if co-ownership by itself
has no impact on profitability. This contrasts with the case in which co-investors have an
incentive to resist to profit shifting and the cost of profit shifting was assumed to increase in
the amount of profit shifting.

Dependent variable: W_ROA. All regressions contained a full set of time and firm fixed effects; coefficients
are not reported. W_ROA and W_DEBT-RATIO are winsorized versions of ROW and DEBT-RATIO. To
avoid losing firms with zero employment, sales, or fixed assets in some years, I added a small constant before
taking logs. For sake of presentation, logs have been entered in one tenth of a percent.
Like in Section 5, I concentrate on affiliates that on average show a positive
profitability. Table 4 gives the summary statistics for important variables. As on the inbound
side, the return on total assets shows a huge variation that is obviously unrelated to taxation
and the regressions below will therefore use the winsorized variable W_ROA. CT is now
characterizing the corporate tax rate applicable to profits of the German-owned affiliate
abroad. Using the dummy WHOLLY that takes on the value one if the German investor
holds a 100% participation, I created the variable CT_WHOLLY = CT * WHOLLY in
addition to using the simple host country corporate income tax, CT. Of course, the impact
20
CT is expected to be negative: an increased tax rate should reduce the net of tax profitability
as long as a potentially accompanying tax base broadening does not overcompensate the
effect of tax cuts.15 Proposition 2 suggests that the coefficient of CT_WHOLLY should also
be negative reflecting that firms without co-investors find it easier to adapt to tax rate
changes than other firms.
Table 5 contains two regression results using fixed effects models. While model (2)
contains a variable for the leverage of the affiliate, model (1) omits such a variable. Apart
from this, there are no differences in the specifications.
Like in section 5, there is no evidence that the fact that a firm is wholly-owned
correlates with profitability. The sign of CT is consistent with expectations: an increase in
the tax rate of the host country reduces profitability. The coefficient is not significant,
though, suggesting that a large fraction of the effects of rate reductions may be outweighed
by accompanying tax base adjustments. The main variable of interest is CT_WHOLLY,
which turns out to be negative and statistically significant at the 8 percent level in model (1).
In line with Proposition 2, this suggests that wholly-owned firms indeed do react more
strongly than co-owned affiliates.
The German tax rate cannot be tested when time fixed effects are included as it is
identical for all firms in a given year. The variable CTGER_WHOLLY measures the
differential effect of the German tax rate for wholly owned affiliates as compared to non-
wholly owned subsidiaries. It shows a positive sign but is not significant at conventional
levels. This is consistent with the model that has not suggested a systematic correlation.
Unlike in the inbound sample, LN_EMPLOYMENT has a positive effect on
profitability, while the control variables LN_SALES and LN_FIXEDASSETS have a
corresponding sign: positive for sales and negative for the amount of fixed assets.16 Finally,
two variables are added that represent the macroeconomic situation in the host country. As a
15 I do not observe information on the tax base of foreign subsidiaries.
16 Like on the inbound side, LN_FIXEDASSETS include intangible assets as these are compounded in the
Bundesbank questionnaires.
21
measure of the local performance off the real economy, GDPGROWTH enters positively:
affiliates in high growth countries are enjoying a significantly higher return on assets.
Besides real growth also the financial macroeconomic situation may affect profitability.
DOMPRIVCRED, which measures the domestic private credit to GDP ratio and captures the
liquidity of local loan markets, does not show up to be significant.
If the negative coefficient of CT_WHOLLY is interpreted as evidence for profit
shifting activities the question arises as to what extent this profit shifting may be due to a
different financial structure. Since the dependent variable is a measure of the return on total
assets, interest on additional debt, which an increased local tax rate may induce, will reduce
profits and decrease this measure. Inclusion of a variable for the debt to asset ratio in model
(2) should control for this latter effect. Indeed the inclusion of W_DEBT_RATIO decreases
the impact of CT_WHOLLY and renders the estimated coefficient insignificant. This change
suggests that some part of the profit reaction that is induced by a lower foreign tax rate CT
results from a reduced leverage. These results are in line with the finding of Mintz and
Weichenrieder (2005) that the foreign tax rates significantly influences the intra-company
loans granted by a German parent, but much less so if the foreign affiliate is co-owned by
other investors. The estimated coefficient of -0.109 implies that an increase of the debt to
asset ratio by one percentage point is associated with a reduction of the ROA by some 0.11
percentage points.
6. Summary
The paper has taken two approaches to identify profit shifting behavior. In a first step, it has
looked at the correlation between the home country tax rate of a parent and the net of tax
profitability of its German affiliate. The finding is compatible with profit shifting behavior.
For profitable affiliates the evidence suggests that a 10 percentage point increase in the
parent's home country tax rate leads to roughly half a percentage point increase in the
profitability of the German affiliate.
22
In a second step the paper has analyzed German outbound FDI. Given the high tax
rates of German parents by international standards, the profitability of German-owned
affiliates abroad may benefit from profit shifting. Since pre-tax profits are not observed in
the German FDI data, the empirical test looks at whether the local tax rates of German-
owned affiliates have a stronger impact on wholly-owned affiliates. While such a differential
effect seems to be present if leverage is excluded as an explanatory variable, the significance
of the distinction between wholly-owned and partly-owned affiliates is blurred if leverage is
entered in the regression.
