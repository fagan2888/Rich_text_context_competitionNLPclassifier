ABSTRACT
Background: Racial differences in cardiovascular risk factors do
notfullyexplainthehigherprevalenceoflower-extremityperipheral
arterial disease (PAD) in black adults.
Objective: We sought to determine whether any of this excess risk
may be explained by vitamin D status, which has been widely doc-
umented to be lower in blacks than in whites.
Design: This population-based cross-sectional study included 2987
white and 866 black persons aged 40 y from the 2001­2004 Na-
tional Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. PAD was defined
as an ankle-brachial pressure index of 0.90 in either leg.
Results: Mean (SEM) 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concen-
trations were significantly lower in black than in white adults (39.2
 1.0 and 63.7  1.1 nmol/L, respectively; P  0.001). Adjusted
odds ratios for PAD decreased in a dose-dependent fashion with
increasing quartiles of 25(OH)D in white adults [1.00 (referent),
0.86, 0.67, and 0.53; P for trend  0.001]. In black adults, the
association was nonlinear; models with cubic splines suggested ev-
idence of greater odds for PAD and a trend for lower odds for PAD
at the lowest and highest concentrations of 25(OH)D, respectively.
After adjustment for racial differences in socioeconomic status and
for traditional and novel risk factors, odds for PAD in black com-
pared with white adults were reduced from 2.11 (95% CI: 1.55, 2.87)
to 1.67 (1.11, 2.51). After additional adjustment for 25(OH)D, the
odds were further reduced to 1.33 (0.84, 2.10).
Conclusions: Racial differences in vitamin D status may explain
nearly one-third of the excess risk of PAD in black compared with
white adults. Additional research is needed to confirm these
findings. Am J Clin Nutr 2008;88:1469­77.
INTRODUCTION
Lower-extremity peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is a man-
ifestation of atherosclerosis resulting in the obstruction of blood
flow to the lower extremities, significant morbidity, and elevated
risks of all-cause and cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality
(1­3). National data suggest that PAD diagnosed via ankle-
brachialpressureindex(ABI)criteriaispresentin5millionUS
adults (4). Black adults have been consistently reported to be
morelikelytohavePADthanarewhiteadults(4­6).Thisgreater
risk for PAD has been shown to be only partially explained by
racial differences in traditional or novel CVD risk factors (5, 6).
Therefore, the identification of additional factors that may con-
tribute to this racial disparity in PAD is of primary public health
importance.
Increasing evidence from several lines of research suggests
that exposure to ultraviolet B (UVB) light radiation (290­315
nm), which decreases with increasing latitude and which is
lower during winter in nonequatorial regions, may influence
the risk of CVD (7­9). Because skin production is the prin-
cipal source of vitamin D and because it is dependent on UVB
radiation, vitamin D has been hypothesized to play a role in the
pathogenesis of CVD. However, evidence from clinical stud-
ies of the association of concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin
D [25(OH)D], the primary circulating storage form of vitamin
D, with cardiovascular events has been mixed. Studies have
reported lower 25(OH)D concentrations in cerebrovascular
(10, 11), heart failure (12), and coronary heart disease (10, 13)
patients, but high 25(OH)D concentrations have been reported
in ischemic heart disease patients (14). More recent evidence
suggests that low 25(OH)D concentrations are associated with
higher rates of hypertension (15), myocardial infarction (16),
and CVD (17).
Vitamin D deficiency is highly prevalent in the United States
and around the world. Low vitamin D status has been estimated
to be present in 30­50% of otherwise healthy adults (18, 19).
Blacks are one of several groups that are at high risk of vitamin
D deficiency. Several factors may account for this racial dispar-
ity, including greater cutaneous melanin content, which blocks
the initial conversion of 7-dihydrocholesterol to previtamin
D3
in the skin (20, 21); a dietary intake that includes a lower
consumption of dairy products and other foods fortified with
vitamin D (22, 23); and racial differences in vitamin D me-
tabolism (24, 25).
Recent data from the National Health and Nutrition Examina-
tion Survey (NHANES) suggested an association between vita-
min D deficiency and PAD (26). The examination of this asso-
ciationinwhiteandblackadultswaslimited,however,especially
with regard to the shape of the dose-response curves and to

whether racial differences in vitamin D concentrations may ex-
plain any of the excess risk of PAD in black than in white adults.
We therefore aimed to characterize the shape of the dose-
response association between 25(OH)D and PAD in a nationally
representative, population-based sample of white and black
adults. We further sought to determine whether any of the risk for
PAD in black adults may be explained by racial differences in
vitamin D status.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS
Study design and population
The present study was based on data from NHANES 2001­
2004 that was conducted by the National Center for Health Sta-
tistics of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
NHANES is an ongoing data-collection initiative that employs a
complex, multistage, stratified probability-sampling design to
select participants representative of the noninstitutionalized ci-
vilian US population. Data collection occurred during a home
interview and a health examination conducted in a mobile ex-
amination center.
A total of 3557 white and 1187 black adults aged  40 y
completed a health examination as part of NHANES 2001­2004.
For our purposes, we excluded persons who did not complete
ABI testing (n  800), those who were missing 25(OH)D infor-
mation (n  167), and those with an ABI of 1.5 (n  14), which
typically is indicative of noncompressible vessels. The remain-
ing 2897 white and 866 black adults formed the sample popula-
tion for analyses.
All subjects provided written informed consent. The Institu-
tional Review Board at the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention approved the overall design of NHANES.
Peripheral arterial disease
The presence of PAD was determined with the use of ABI, a
highly sensitive and specific noninvasive test (27). Participants
40 y old who completed a physical examination as part of
NHANES 2001­2004 were eligible for the ABI assessment.
Reasons for exclusion included body weight  182 kg, bilateral
amputations, or the presence of a cast, ulcer, or bandage that may
have interfered with the measurement. The measurements of
bloodpressureusedtodetermineABIdifferedfromthoseusedto
determine hypertension. To calculate ABI, supine systolic blood
pressurewasmeasuredontherightarm(brachialartery)andboth
ankles (posterior tibial arteries) with the use of an 8-MHz Dopp-
ler probe (Parks Mini-Laboratory IV, model 3100; Parks Medi-
cal Electronics, Las Vegas, NV). If the right arm had a condition
that interfered with the measurement, the left arm was used. Each
limb pressure was measured twice and averaged in subjects
40­59 y old; it was measured once in those 60 y old. Left and
right ABIs were calculated as the respective ankle systolic pres-
sure divided by the brachial systolic pressure. An ABI of 0.90
in either leg was used to define PAD (28).
25-hydroxyvitamin D
During the health examination, blood samples were obtained
by venipuncture and immediately centrifuged, aliquoted, and
frozen to 20 °C. The frozen serum and plasma samples were
then shipped on dry ice to central laboratories and stored at
70 °C until they were analyzed. Serum 25(OH)D [both
25(OH)D2
 25(OH)D3
] concentrations were measured by us-
ing a radioimmunoassay (Diasorin Inc, Stillwater, MN). Total
(intraassay and interassay) CVs ranged from 6.3% to 13.2%, the
limit of detection was 7.5 nmol/L, and the reference range was
25­137 nmol/L. Values are converted to ng/mL by division by
2.496. Because the vitamin D distribution differed considerably
between white and black adults, race-specific cutoffs were used
to categorize 25(OH)D into quartiles.
Other variables
Information on smoking, alcohol use, physical activity,
vitamin-mineral supplementation, mobility limitation, educa-
tion,andhouseholdincomewasobtainedbyself-report.Statusas
a current, former, or never smoker was based on the use of
cigarettes, cigars, or pipe tobacco. Subjects who had smoked
100 cigarettes, 20 cigars, or 20 pipes of tobacco in their
lifetime but no longer smoked were considered former smokers.
Frequency of alcoholic beverage (ie, beer, wine, or spirits) con-
sumption over the past year was assessed. Subjects were asked
about the frequency and duration of walking or bicycling for
transportation, home or yard work, and moderate- to vigorous-
intensity leisure-time physical activity performed for 10 min at
a time during the previous month. Responses to those questions
were incorporated into a single summary variable expressed as
metabolic equivalents (measured as MET-min/wk) by using in-
tensity values recommended by the National Center for Health
Statistics (29). Data on the use of individual and multivitamin
supplements over the previous month were used to assess intakes
of supplemental vitamin D. The presence of mobility limitation
was defined as any difficulty in walking without special equip-
ment or at least some difficulty in walking 2­3 blocks.
Using a mercury sphygmomanometer, a certified technician
measured blood pressure a maximum of 4 times in seated sub-
jects after a 5-min rest. Hypertension was defined by any of 4
criteria: an average systolic blood pressure of 140 mm Hg, an
average diastolic blood pressure of 90 mm Hg, physician di-
agnosis, or medication use. Body weight to the nearest 0.1 kg and
standing height to the nearest 0.1 cm were measured by using an
electronic scale (Mettler-Toledo Inc, Columbus, OH) and a sta-
diometer (Seca, Hamburg, Germany). Body mass index (BMI; in
kg/m2) was calculated.
Serum cholesterol was measured enzymatically (Hitachi 704
Analyzer; Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN). Hypercholes-
terolemia was defined as a total cholesterol concentrations of
6.2mmol/L(240mg/dL)ormedicationuse.High-sensitivity
C-reactive protein (CRP) was measured with a Behring Nephe-
lometer II Analyzer (Dade Behring Diagnostics Inc, Somerville,
NJ). Serum creatinine was measured with the use of the Jaffé rate
reaction (Beckman Astra, Brea, CA). Glomerular filtration rate,
a measure of kidney filtration function, was estimated with an
abbreviatedversionoftheequationfromtheModificationofDiet
in Renal Disease Study (30), calculated as 175  (serum creat-
inine, mg/dL)1.154  (age, y)0.203  0.742 (if female) or 
1.212 (if African American). Plasma glucose was measured by
using standard hexokinase enzymatic assays. Diabetes was de-
fined by history, use of diabetes medications, fasting glucose 
7.0 mmol/L (126 mg/dL), or nonfasting glucose  11.1
mmol/L (200 mg/dL). A history of CVD was defined as a
physician diagnosis of myocardial infarction, congestive heart
failure, or stroke.

Statistical analysis
All analyses were weighted to the US population to provide
nationally representative estimates. SAS-callable SUDAAN
statistical software (version 9.0; Research Triangle Institute,
Research Triangle Park, NC) was used to account for the
complex survey design, a stratified multistage cluster sample.
Because the concentration of 25(OH)D and the prevalence of
PAD differed significantly between the races, we examined
predictors of 25(OH)D and risk factors for PAD separately by
race. Differences in sample characteristics according to race
and presence of PAD were determined with independent sam-
ple t tests for continuous measures and with chi-square tests
for categorical measures. Race-specific odds ratios (ORs)
(and 95% CIs) for PAD according to 25(OH)D concentration
were estimated by using multivariate logistic regression mod-
els. Tests for a linear trend were performed by entering the
continuous 25(OH)D variable into the multivariate model as
an ordinal term.
To visually explore the dose-response association between
25(OH)D and PAD in white and black adults, we used flexible
cubic splines with knots at the 5th, 25th, 75th, and 95th percen-
tiles of the race-specific 25(OH)D distribution (31). The mid-
point of the lowest race-specific 25(OH)D quartile served as the
referent value. To test for a nonlinear association between vita-
min D and PAD, we entered quadratic and linear terms or both
quadratic and cubic terms along with a linear term in the multi-
variate models. The extent to which groups of covariates ap-
peared to explain the excess odds of PAD in black adults was
determined by calculating the percentage reduction (PR) in the
OR associated with adjustment according to the formula PR 
(oa
 ob
)/(oa
 1), where oa
is the OR for PAD in blacks versus
whites in the base model adjusted for age and sex; ob
is the OR
after additional adjustment for covariates; and oa
­ 1 is the excess
odds of PAD in blacks than in whites. Statistical significance was
defined as P  0.05 by using 2-sided tests.
RESULTS
Mean (SEM) 25(OH)D concentrations were significantly
lower [39.2  1.0 (range: 7.5­110.7) and 63.7  1.1 (range:
7.5­196.7) nmol/L, respectively; P  0.001] in black than in
white adults, whereas the prevalence of PAD was significantly
higherinblackthaninwhiteadults(8.5%and5.3%,respectively;
P  0.05). Additional characteristics of the cohort stratified by
race and presence of PAD are shown in Table 1. Black adults had
a lower household income and education; were less physically
active and less likely to use vitamin D supplements; and had a
lower ABI than did white adults. In addition, black adults had a
higher BMI and were more likely to smoke and to have mobility
limitation, higher CRP concentrations, and diabetes and hyper-
tension than were white adults. In contrast, white adults were
slightly older, had a lower estimated glomerular filtration rate,
and were more likely to have hypercholesterolemia than were
black adults.
White and black adults with PAD were generally older, had
lower income and education, drank alcohol less frequently, had

lower kidney filtration function, and were more likely to have
diabetes and CVD than were adults without PAD (Table 1). In
addition, white adults with PAD had lower 25(OH)D and higher
CRP concentrations, were less physically active, and were more
likely to have hypertension and hypercholesterolemia than were
white adults without PAD.
The association between 25(OH)D and selected demo-
graphic, anthropometric, and clinical characteristics of the
cohort stratified by race is shown in Table 2. In both white and
black adults, 25(OH)D was higher in men than women; was
inversely associated with BMI, CRP concentrations, and es-
timated glomerular filtration rate; and was positively associ-
ated with physical activity. In white adults, ABI increased,
whereas age and the presence of mobility limitation decreased
with increasing 25(OH)D. In black adults, 25(OH)D increased
with age. Lower 25(OH)D concentrations were associated
with a history of CVD and the presence of diabetes and hy-
pertension in white adults only.
In white adults, a strong inverse dose-response age- and
sex-adjusted association was observed between 25(OH)D and
the prevalence of PAD (Table 3). The strength of this asso-
ciation was only modestly attenuated after adjustment for
socioeconomic status; anthropometric and lifestyle factors; a
history of CVD; the presence of mobility limitation, diabetes,
hypertension, or hypercholesterolemia; kidney function; and
the CRP concentration. For each 5-nmol/L increase in the
concentration of 25(OH)D, the multivariate-adjusted odds for
PAD were reduced by 7% (OR  0.93; 95% CI: 0.90, 0.97).
Results of the 4-knot cubic spline among white adults are
displayed in Figure 1. Although the CIs are wide, the odds of
PAD appeared to decrease linearly with increasing vitamin D
status. In black adults, there was no clear trend in the quartile
analysis presented in Table 3. However, results of the 4-knot
cubic spline among black adults provided evidence of a non-
linear association (Figure 2). The fitted curve suggested
higher odds of PAD at the lowest concentrations of 25(OH)D
and a nonsignificant trend for lower odds above a concentra-
tion of 70 nmol/L. Regression coefficients for the quadratic
and cubic vitamin D terms contributed significantly to the
model in black (P  0.029 and 0.048, respectively) but not
white (P  0.168 and 0.180, respectively) adults.
To examine the extent to which the observed excess preva-
lence of PAD in black adults may be explained by racial differ-
ences in socioeconomic status and by lifestyle, traditional, and

novel CVD risk factors, we constructed several multivariate
models. After adjustment for age and sex, the odds of PAD were
2.11 (95% CI: 1.55, 2.87) times as high in black adults (Table 4).
After further adjustment for 2 indicators of socioeconomic status
(ie, household income and education), BMI, and lifestyle factors,
the observed odds were reduced by 37.8%. Racial differences in
CRP concentrations and estimated glomerular filtration rate; the
presence of diabetes, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia;
and a history of CVD explained an additional 1.8%. After addi-
tional adjustment for racial differences in 25(OH)D, the odds of
PAD in black adults were further reduced by nearly 31%.
DISCUSSION
In this nationally representative, population-based, cross-
sectional sample of US adults, we observed a strong inverse
dose-response association of vitamin D status with PAD in
white adults that was independent of several potential con-
founding factors and PAD risk factors. In black adults, the
association was nonlinear; models with cubic splines sug-
gested evidence of higher odds of PAD and a trend for lower
odds of PAD at the lowest and highest concentrations of
25(OH)D, respectively. Differences in the dose-response as-
sociation between black and white adults may be attributed to
a woefully inadequate vitamin D status of black adults, altered
sensitivity to the effects of vitamin D, or differences in the
concentrations of related hormones. We further showed that
racial differences in vitamin D concentrations may explain
nearly one-third of the excess risk of PAD in black adults,
above and beyond differences in established and novel CVD
risk factors. In general, these findings are consistent with
recent studies suggesting that racial differences in vitamin D
also may contribute to the greater frequency of hypertension
and cancer observed among black adults (32, 33).
A higher prevalence of PAD in black adults has been con-
firmed by numerous studies (4­6). This excess risk does not
appear to be fully explained by differences in traditional or novel
CVD risk factors (4­6). Allison et al (5) showed that significantly
(47%) higher odds of PAD in black adults remained after adjust-
ment for racial differences in socioeconomic status and for life-
style, traditional, and novel risk factors. In the current study, the
odds of PAD were 2.11 times as high in black adults. After
adjustment for racial differences in socioeconomic status and in
lifestyle, traditional, and novel risk factors, a significant 67%
increase in the odds of PAD remained. After additional adjust-
ment for racial differences in serum vitamin D, the excess odds
werereducedto33%,andthedifferencebetweenblackandwhite
subjects was no longer statistically significant. These findings
suggest that the high frequency of vitamin D deficiency observed
in black adults may be an important contributor to their higher
risk of PAD.
Vitamin D is widely recognized for its role in regulating
calcium homeostasis, bone formation, and bone resorption.
However, an accumulating body of evidence suggests that
vitamin D deficiency may also play a role in the pathogenesis

of CVD (9, 34). Lower vitamin D concentrations have been
observed in patients with stroke (11), acute myocardial in-
farction (13), heart failure (12), and CVD (10, 13). Low vi-
tamin D status has also been associated with clinical and
subclinical PAD (26, 35) and with higher rates of hypertension
(15), myocardial infarction (16), and CVD (17). Furthermore,
small clinical trials have shown that vitamin D supplementa-
tion or UVB irradiation may lower systolic blood pressure
(36), improve blood pressure control (37), and regress myo-
cardial hypertrophy (38). Nonetheless, recent data from the
Women's Health Initiative showed that calcium and vitamin
D supplementation did not reduce CVD risk in postmeno-
pausal women (39). There are several possible explanations
for this apparent discrepancy, including the design of the
Women's Health Initiative as a fracture prevention trial, an
insufficient dose of vitamin D, and the inability to examine

whether supplementation may have benefited subjects with
deficiency (40).
In the present study, the association between 25(OH)D and
PADinblackadultswasnonlinear.Differencesintheassociation
of vitamin D with related risk factors, including higher fasting
glucose concentrations and impaired glucose tolerance, have
been reported between the races (41), although the investigation
of a nonlinear association has been limited. Furthermore, numer-
ous studies have shown, paradoxically, that black adults have
greater bone mass and a lower risk for fracture than do white
adults, despite lower vitamin D status and a resultant higher
parathyroid hormone concentration (42­45). Black adults may
have adapted to the secondary hyperparathyroidism caused by
chronic vitamin D deficiency and to the observed intestinal re-
sistance to the actions of vitamin D by developing skeletal resis-
tance to the bone-resorbing effects of parathyroid hormone (46,
47). Thus, we speculate that racial differences in the shape of the
association between vitamin D and PAD may be due at least
partly to an altered sensitivity to the effects of vitamin D, related
hormones, or both. Further research is necessary to confirm this
hypothesis.
Despite the potential for an altered sensitivity to vitamin D,
black persons or other persons with dark skin can attain high
25(OH)D concentrations, given sufficient UVB exposure or sup-
plementation (48, 49). Attaining a definition of the optimal in-
take of vitamin D or 25(OH)D to promote health is an area of
current controversy. Existing recommendations suggest a daily
allowance of 200 IU for those 50 y old, 400 IU for those 50­69
y old, and 600 IU for those 70 y old. However, many experts
havearguedthatthecurrentrecommendedallowanceiswoefully
inadequate because it was based largely on the prevention of
osteomalacia or rickets (50). Some experts say an optimal intake
is 1000 IU/d or a 25(OH)D concentration  75 nmol/L, a
concentration that may be associated with maximal suppression
of parathyroid hormone and a lower risk of fracture (50).
Several mechanisms may explain the association of vitamin D
deficiency with PAD. Low vitamin D status has been shown to
have an association with obesity, diabetes, and hypertension, all
of which increase the risk of PAD (51). However, in the present
study, the relation between 25(OH)D and PAD remained after
adjustment for these risk factors, which suggests that there are
additional explanatory mechanisms. Vitamin D receptors have a
broad tissue distribution that includes vascular smooth muscle
cells (52), macrophages (53), and lymphocytes (54). Further-
more, vitamin D regulates the expression of a number of proteins
relevant to the arterial wall, including vascular endothelial
growth factor, matrix metalloproteinase type 9, myosin, elastin,
and type I collagen (34). In addition, vitamin D has been shown
to regulate the renin-angiotensin system by suppressing renin
gene expression (55, 56) and to inhibit cytokine release from
lymphocytes (54). Similarly, a transgenic rat model that consti-
tutivelyexpressesvitaminD-24-hydroxylase--anenzymethatis
responsible for breaking down an activated form of vitamin D,
therebycausingdeficiency--developsaorticatherosclerosisand
hyperlipidemia (57). In an animal model of chronic kidney dis-
ease, the administration of clinically relevant doses of vitamin D
reduced aortic calcification, whereas higher doses increased ath-
erosclerosis (58). In another study, rats fed a diet rich in choles-
terol and extremely high in vitamin D (1.8 million units/kg) also
developed greater aortic calcification (59). Thus, evidence from
animal models and from clinical studies suggests that the optimal
vitamin D concentration for cardiovascular health may be one
that is neither excessively high nor insufficient.
The present study had a number of strengths, including a
nationally representative population-based sample, standardized
data collection protocols, and rigorous quality-control proce-
dures. In addition, the use of ABI allowed the identification of
subclinical PAD. However, this study is limited by the cross-
sectional nature of these data, which impedes the drawing of a
causal inference. It has been suggested that low 25(OH)D in
persons with PAD may be the result of reduced ambulatory
activity and less access to sunlight. Despite this hypothesis, we
found that the association between vitamin D and PAD was
independent of physical activity and the presence of mobility
limitation. Furthermore, none of the participants were institu-
tionalized, and all were mobile enough to attend the physical
examination. As in most racial-ethnic comparison studies, edu-
cation and income are merely proxy indicators for socioeco-
nomic status and are thus subject to residual confounding (60).
Additional limitations include the lack of information regarding
the geographic area of residence, the season during which blood
samples were obtained, and the measurement of parathyroid
hormone concentrations. However, even if the results of the
current study are mediated by secondary hyperparathyroidism,
the appropriate treatment would focus on the repletion of vitamin
D, which justifies our focus on vitamin D concentrations.
In conclusion, we found that racial differences in vitamin D
status may explain nearly one-third of the excess risk of PAD in
black compared with white adults. Because vitamin D concen-
trations can easily be modified via supplementation or safe, mod-
erate sun exposure, additional research to determine whether low
vitamin D concentrations contribute to the greater risk of PAD in
black adults appears warranted.
