Obstructive Lung Disease and Low Lung Function
in Adults in the United States
Data From the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 1988-1994
David M. Mannino, MD; Robert C. Gagnon, MS; Thomas L. Petty, MD; Eva Lydick, PhD
Background: Obstructive lung disease (OLD) is an im-
portant cause of morbidity and mortality in the US adult
population. Potentially treatable mild cases of OLD of-
ten go undetected. This analysis determines the na-
tional estimates of reported OLD and low lung function
in the US adult population.
Methods: We examined data from the Third National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III),
a multistage probability representative sample of the US
population. A total of 20050 US adults participated in
NHANES III from 1988 to 1994. Our main outcome mea-
sures were low lung function (a condition determined
to be present if the forced expiratory volume in 1
second­forced vital capacity ratio was less than 0.7 and
the forced expiratory volume in 1 second was less than
80% of the predicted value), a physician diagnosis of
OLD (chronic bronchitis, asthma, or emphysema), and
respiratory symptoms.
Results: Overall a mean (SE) of 6.8% (0.3%) of the popu-
lation had low lung function, and 8.5% (0.3%) of the
population reported OLD. Obstructive lung disease (age-
adjusted to study population) was currently reported
among 12.5% (0.7%) of current smokers, 9.4% (0.6%)
of former smokers, 3.1% (1.1%) of pipe or cigar smok-
ers, and 5.8% (0.4%) of never smokers. Surprisingly,
63.3% (0.2%) of the subjects with documented low lung
function had no prior or current reported diagnosis of
any OLD.
Conclusions: This study demonstrates that OLD is pre-
sent in a substantive number of US adults. In addition,
many US adults have low lung function but no reported
OLD diagnosis, which may indicate the presence of un-
diagnosed lung disease.

OBSTRUCTIVE lung dis-
eases (OLDs), which in-
clude chronic bronchi-
tis, emphysema, and
asthma, are the fourth
most common cause of death in the United
States and accounted for more than
109000 deaths in 1997.1 Obstructive lung
disease is the only major disease among
the top 5 causes of death that is rising in
prevalence and mortality.2 It is now esti-
mated that nearly 16 million people in the
United States have chronic bronchitis and
emphysema, which is commonly re-
ferred to as chronic obstructive pulmo-
nary disease (COPD).3 Costs of hospital-
izations, physician visits, and consumption
of health care resources for COPD were
almost $15 billion in 1993.4 In addition,
asthma may affect as many as 14.6 mil-
lion people in the United States3,5 with as-
sociated direct medical costs of $6.0 bil-
lion in 1993.6
Because of the increase in prevalence
andmortalityofOLD,andthemedicalcosts
associatedwiththem,itisimportanttoiden-
tify patients and to treat them before they
reach the symptomatic and costly stages of
disease.TheLungHealthStudyshowedthat
when patients with mild to moderate OLD
quit smoking, their lung function declined
only slightly over the next 5 years.7 In con-
trast, similar patients who continued to
smoke had rapid rates of decline in lung
function.Inaddition,theLungHealthStudy
showed a high incidence of mortality re-
latedtolungcancer,heartattack,andstroke
in subjects with only mild to moderate air-
flow obstruction.7
Because a high proportion of OLD has
eluded diagnosis, it is impossible to know
the true prevalence of these diseases in the
United States today. To estimate the mag-
nitude of OLD in the United States, we ana-
lyzed data from the Third National Health
and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES III)8 in an effort to determine
how much of the US population might
have low levels of lung function, OLD, and
respiratory symptoms.

SUBJECTS AND METHODS
STUDY POPULATION
The NHANES III was conducted from 1988 to 1994 by the
National Center for Health Statistics of the Centers for Dis-
ease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Ga.8 In this study a
stratified multistage clustered probability design was used
to select a representative sample of the US population, yield-
ing results that can be extrapolated to the entire US popu-
lation. Study participants completed extensive question-
naires in the household and a comprehensive physical
examination, including pulmonary function testing, ei-
ther in the household or at a specially equipped mobile ex-
amination center. A total of 81 sites were included in the
final sample. The study was approved by the National Cen-
ter for Health Statistics Institutional Review Board.
SUBJECTS
Our study sample was limited to adults aged 17 years and
older who classified themselves as whites or blacks, had
pulmonary function testing performed in either the home
or the mobile examination center, and had complete data
on their race, smoking status, height, and presence of res-
piratory symptoms. Of the 20050 adult study partici-
pants, 543 were not of white or black race, 3355 did not
have pulmonary function testing done, 8 were missing data
on smoking status, race, or height, and 56 were missing
data on 1 or more respiratory symptom. In addition, we
excluded 4 women from the analysis who were current ci-
gar or pipe smokers. After the exclusions, we had data from
16084 subjects available for our main analysis.
VARIABLE DEFINITION
The race of the participants was classified as either white or
blackandwasdeterminedbyself-reportonthequestionnaire.
Wedefinedsubjectsasbeingcurrentsmokers,formersmok-
ers, pipe or cigar smokers, or never smokers based on their
responsestoseriesofquestions.Onehadtohavesmokedmore
than 100 cigarettes to qualify as a former or current smoker
and could not be currently smoking cigarettes to qualify as a
pipe or cigar smoker. Former smokers were asked how old
theywerewhentheylastsmokedcigarettes.Subjectswereasked
"Hasadoctorevertoldyouthatyouasthma?"andsimilarques-
tionsaboutchronicbronchitisandemphysema.Subjectswith
a positive response to the question about asthma or chronic
bronchitis were also asked "Do you still have asthma?" and
"Do you still have chronic bronchitis?" We considered sub-
jectswhorespondedthattheycurrentlyhadasthmaorbron-
chitis, or that they had ever had a diagnosis of emphysema,
to have a current diagnosis of OLD. We considered subjects
withapositiveresponsetoapreviousdiagnosisofeitherchronic
bronchitis or asthma, but a negative response to current dis-
ease, to have a past diagnosis of OLD. We classified subjects
as having a symptom if they gave a positive response to the
following questions involving specific symptoms (cough,
phlegm,wheezing,anddyspnea):"Doyouusuallycoughon
mostdaysfor3consecutivemonthsormoreduringtheyear?"
"Do you bring up phlegm on most days for 3 consecutive
months or more during the year?" "Have you had wheezing
orwhistlinginyourchestatanytimeinthepast12months?"
and"Areyoutroubledbyshortnessofbreathwhenhurrying
on level ground or walking up a slight hill?" If a subject had
a positive response to any of these 4 symptoms, we consid-
ered that subject to have a respiratory symptom.
For most analyses, we stratified subjects into 6 age
strata; 17 to 24 years, 25 to 44 years, 45 to 64 years, 65 to
74 years, 75 to 84 years, and 85 years and older. For use in
logistic regressions we classified subjects as having or not
having cardiovascular disease (positive response to physi-
cian-diagnosed stroke, myocardial infarction, or conges-
tive heart failure); obesity (body mass index [BMI] 28,
calculated as the weight in kilograms divided by the square
of the height in meters); inactivity (based on self report as
being less active than peers); and low socioeconomic sta-
tus (based on family income below poverty level).
PULMONARY FUNCTION DATA
Using either a dry rolling seal spirometer in the mobile ex-
amination center or a portable spirometer in the home ex-
amination, spirometry was conducted on the examinees.
Procedures for testing were based on the 1987 American
Thoracic Society recommendations.9 To obtain accept-
able protocol curves, examinees performed 5 to 8 forced
expirations. We used published prediction equations for
forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1
) to calculate
the predicted FEV1
for whites and blacks, stratified by sex.10
We then determined the value of the FEV1
(as a percent-
age of the predicted value) for each subject. We defined
subjects with an FEV1
­forced vital capacity (FVC) ratio of
less than 0.70 and an FEV1
less than 80% of their pre-
dicted value as having low lung function, and further di-
vided this group into subjects with an FEV1
of 50% or more
and those with less than 50% of their predicted value, cor-
responding to people with stage 1 vs stage 2 or 3 OLD.11
ANALYSIS
We calculated all estimates using the sampling weight to rep-
resent adults aged 17 years and older in the United States.
The purpose of these sampling weight calculations was to ad-
just for unequal probabilities of selection and to account for
nonresponse. They were poststratified to the US population
as estimated by the Bureau of the Census. For analyses, we
used both SAS and SUDAAN, a program that adjusts for the
complex sample design when calculating variance esti-
mates.12 Most of our analyses stratified the data by race and
sex,withfurtherstratificationbyeithersmokingstatusorage.
We also present data stratified by reported lung disease and
level of lung function. In these strata and substrata, we de-
termined the estimated national population, the mean FEV1
aspercentpredicted,themeanFEV1
-FVCratio,andthenum-
ber and age-adjusted percentage of the population with low
lung function. We used the 6 age classes noted above and the
overall age distribution of the study participants to age-
adjust our results. In addition, we determined the number
and age-adjusted percentage of the population with past or
current OLD and the age-adjusted percentage of the popu-
lation with cough, phlegm, wheezing, dyspnea, or any res-
piratory symptom. We also determined the age-adjusted per-
centage of the population stratified by race, sex, and smoking
status with low lung function but with no current diagnosis
of any OLD. Finally, we modeled, using logistic regression,
factors predicting subjects who were unable to perform pul-
monaryfunctiontesting,subjectswithlowlungfunction,and
subjects with low lung function yet no reported OLD.

RESULTS
Our final data set contained 16084 subjects represent-
ing an estimated 169.3 million adults in the United States.
Relative SEs for the data presented are less than 10%, ex-
cept for data on pipe and cigar smokers, where the RSEs
are less than 35%. Among the population, an estimated
14.3 million (8.5%) had current OLD, and another 7.3
million (4.3%) had OLD in the past, but not currently
(Table 1). The proportion of the population with past
or current OLD varied by sex, race, and smoking status,
with women reporting more disease than men, whites re-
porting more disease than blacks, and current or former
smokers reporting more disease than never smokers
(Table 1). Obstructive lung disease was present among
12.5% of current smokers, 9.4% of former smokers, 3.1%
of pipe or cigar smokers, and 5.8% of never smokers (all
age-adjusted to study population). Former smokers were,
on average, older than never and current smokers (Table
1). Mean level of lung function, either as the FEV1
-FVC
ratio or FEV1
percent predicted, was always lower among
current smokers, former smokers, and pipe or cigar smok-
ers, compared with never smokers (Table 1). Among
whites, the reported COPD component of OLD gener-
ally increased with age, while among blacks this trend
was less apparent (Figure 1).
Subjects frequently reported more than 1 OLD. For
example, 25.0% of subjects with current bronchitis re-
ported that they had current asthma, and 34.3% of sub-
jects with current asthma reported that they had cur-
rent chronic bronchitis. Similarly, 19.4% of the subjects
with emphysema reported that they had current asthma,
and 25.0% of the subjects with emphysema reported that
they had current chronic bronchitis. Among subjects who
reported having at some point been diagnosed with
asthma, 63.7% reported current asthma, and 58.3% of sub-
jects who reported having been at some point diag-
nosed with chronic bronchitis also reported a current di-
agnosis.
Pulmonaryfunctiontestingwasnotobtainedon3355
of the original 20050 subjects. The significant predic-
tors of not having testing done were the presence of car-
diovascular disease (odds ratio [OR], 1.4; 95% confi-
dence interval [CI], 1.2-1.7) and age (OR, 1.9; 95%
CI, 1.4-2.5 for those aged 65-74 years; OR, 2.9; 95% CI,
2.3-3.8 for those aged 75-84 years; and OR, 5.3; 95% CI,
3.8-7.3 for those aged 85 years and older, compared with
those aged 17-24 years). Overall, 6.8% of the popula-
tion, or an estimated 11.5 million people had low lung
function (Table 2). An additional 7.2% of the popula-
tion had an FEV1
-FVC ratio of less than 0.7 but an FEV1
greater than 80% of the predicted value. Significant pre-
dictors of low lung function included current smoking
(OR, 4.3; 95% CI, 3.2-5.7), former smoking (OR, 2.0; 95%
CI, 1.5-2.5), pipe or cigar smoking (OR, 2.7; 95% CI, 1.4-
5.0), current OLD (OR, 5.4; 95% CI, 4.1-7.0), prior OLD
(OR, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.0-3.0), and age (ORs increased from
2.1 for those aged 25 to 44 years to 21.0 for those aged
85 years and older, compared with 17- to 24-year-olds,
all CIs significant). Moderate to severe lung obstruction
(FEV1
less than 50% of the predicted value and an FEV1
-
FVC ratio of less than 0.7) was more common among cur-
rent and former smokers and among people aged 45 years
and older (Figure 2 and Figure 3). Overall, 1.5% of
the population, or an estimated 2.6 million people, had
an FEV1
of less than 50% of the predicted value, includ-
ing an estimated 900000 people with an FEV1
of less than
35% of the predicted value. Lower levels of lung func-
tion were associated with higher levels of reported symp-
toms (Table 3).

2). Reporting of symptoms varied across disease strata
(Table 3). Among subjects with low lung function, 66.1%
reported at least 1 respiratory symptom (Table 3), com-
pared with 34.4% of subjects with normal pulmonary
function. There was a great deal of overlap between sub-
jects reporting respiratory symptoms, those with low lung
function, and those with current or prior OLD (Figure 4,
Table 3).
Overall, 63.3% of the population with low lung
function did not have a current diagnosis of OLD.
Even among subjects with moderate to severe pulmo-
nary impairment, as indicated by an FEV1
of less than
50% of the predicted value, 44.0% did not have a cur-
rent diagnosis of OLD. Across sex, race, and smoking
categories this proportion ranged from 40% to 88%
(Figure 5). People with a past diagnosis of obstruc-
tive lung disease accounted for a small proportion of
this group of subjects not currently diagnosed (Figure
5). The only significant predictors of low lung function
without a current diagnosis of OLD were current smok-
ing (OR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.0-2.5), inactivity (OR, 0.6;
95% CI, 0.4-0.9), and cardiovascular disease (OR, 0.5;
95% CI, 0.3-0.7).
COMMENT
These data show that low lung function and OLD occur
commonly in a nationally representative sample of the
US population. Low lung function is found in more than
10% of the population over age 45 years, but is not as-
sociated with reported current OLD 63.3% of the time.
This finding is important, because when these patients
can be identified in early and less symptomatic stages of
disease, interventions can be expected to alter the course
and prognosis of disease.7,13,14 Clearly, smoking cessa-
tion is the most important feature in management and is
apt to be beneficial when it is accomplished at an early
age with only mild evidence of airflow obstruction. While
the finding of low lung function does not by itself diag-
nose OLD, its presence should alert clinicians to the pos-
sibility of OLD being present, resulting in subsequent
evaluations and interventions.
These results confirm the findings of many previ-
ous studies, which show associations between cigarette
smoking and pulmonary effects, including low lung
function and respiratory symptoms.13,15,16 A somewhat
surprising finding, though, was that cigar or pipe smok-
ers had a higher prevalence of low lung function
than never smokers, along with more reported respira-
tory symptoms, a finding that runs counter to studies
finding fewer smoking-related health effects in pipe or
cigar smokers.17 Our study suggests that pipe and cigar
smokers are getting enough doses of smoke to cause
lung damage, but our findings may also reflect, in part,
former cigarette smoking (in our study, 69.3% of pipe
and cigar smokers were former cigarette smokers).18 In
addition, our finding of decreased lung function in
pipe and cigar smokers demands intervening in this
group.
The results of our analysis also confirmed previ-
ously known associations between aging and increased
airway obstruction.19 The prevalence of low lung func-
tion increased with increasing age (Figure 2) except in
the oldest group, which may be related to either differ-
ential mortality or inability to do pulmonary function test-
ing. While it is certainly known that the individuals with
low lung function die young,13,20,21 our data also suggest
that people over age 45 years may have significantly de-
creased lung function that remains undiagnosed (Fig-
ure 2 and Figure 5). The patterns we found of reported
OLD also were consistent with reports of COPD increas-
ing with age3 (Figure 1). The racial differences we ob-
served, of generally lower levels of reported COPD in
blacks compared with whites, is consistent with other ob-
servations.3
There have been numerous, but much smaller re-
gional prevalence studies done in the United States, most
notably in Berlin, NH22; Tecumseh, Mich23; and Glen-
wood Springs, Colo.24 These studies used different
degrees of airflow obstruction and had different defini-
tions of the diseases characterized by airflow obstruc-
tion. In Berlin, NH, the prevalence of all chronic non-
specific respiratory diseases ranged from 15.4% to 39.1%
among men and from 15.2% to 19.8% among women,
and low levels of lung function were found among 3.1%
to 21.7% of men and 6.7% to 13.9% of women.22 In Te-
cumseh, Mich, about 14% of adult men and 8% of adult
women had chronic bronchitis, obstructive airway dis-
ease, or both.23 In Glenwood Springs, Colo, about 13%
of adult men and 10% of adult women had chronic bron-
chitis and 13% and 4%, respectively, had low lung func-
tion.24 The above-noted findings can be contrasted with
our own findings of 8.5% of adults reporting current OLD
and 6.8% having low lung function.
Our data also showed a large degree of overlap be-
tween asthma and COPD. Subjects with both diseases had
lower lung function and more respiratory symptoms than
subjects with just one or the other disease (Table 3).
Asthma is a potentially reversible disease when diag-
nosed and treated early in its course with bronchoactive
andanti-inflammatorymedications.25,26 Bycontrast, COPD

tends to be a progressive disease, with relentless decline
in lung function and resultant morbidity and mortality
beginning in the fifth or sixth decade of life.25 Prevent-
ing or forestalling this burden of disease may be pos-
sible through aggressive smoking cessation and, per-
haps, medications that may improve baseline lung
function. The search for other drugs to modulate the in-
flammatory processes incident to the pathogenesis of
COPD is also ongoing.27-34
This survey is subject to several limitations that af-
fect the interpretation of these results. The entire medi-
cal history, including the previous and current diag-
noses, the respiratory symptoms, and the smoking
histories, were entirely self-reported. It is possible that
subjects may have underreported or overreported in any
of these categories. For instance, we found that only 33.9%
and 25.6% of subjects with COPD reported cough and
phlegm, respectively. While the criteria for a positive re-
sponse to these questions were stringent, this may indi-
cate that either symptom or disease reporting was inac-
curate. Another limitation was that current smokers who
either smoked irregularly or had just stopped smoking
could be misclassified as former smokers. In our analy-
ses, however, many of our findings were consistent with
known relationships between respiratory disease, respi-
ratory symptoms, and lung function, suggesting that any

misreporting bias potentially present did not have a large
effect on the results.
Another potential bias of this study design is that
not everyone completed pulmonary function testing. It
is possible that subjects unable to do pulmonary func-
tion testing were also more likely to have low levels of
lung function, thus resulting in an underestimate in the
burden of the prevalence of low lung function in the
United States. Selection was limited to a noninstitution-
alized, nonmilitary population, so it was not truly ran-
domized to a general population. Only patients who were
ambulatory and able to participate were studied, which
might have created a selection bias.
Pulmonary function testing may provide an inter-
ventional opportunity in the United States. Since early
intervention may alter the course and prognosis of OLD,
it is important that all clinicians who encounter smok-
ers and any patient with respiratory symptoms, particu-
larly those over age 45 years, be able to make an accu-
rate diagnosis. Previous studies have shown, though, that

symptoms alone are not adequate to diagnose COPD,35,36
and that spirometry may need to be more widely used to
detect early disease.4
The National Lung Health Education Program is a
new health care initiative aimed at involving primary care
physicians in the early identification and treatment of ob-
structive lung disease.4 The National Lung Health Edu-
cation Program is promoting the widespread use of simple
office spirometry to measure the FEV1
, FVC, and FEV1
-
FVC ratio. The present study demonstrates that a sig-
nificant proportion of the US population older than 45
years has low lung function, which may represent un-
recognized and potentially treatable OLD. Spirometry re-
mains the most efficient means of identifying and treat-
ing this population.
