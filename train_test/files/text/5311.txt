El presente estudio es una réplica del estudio de Foster
(1998) sobre la negociación de significado. Foster observó
los ajustes conversacionales entre aprendientes del inglés
como segunda lengua mientras resolvían diferentes tipos de
tareas comunicativas. Este artículo duplica los métodos de
recolección y análisis de datos pero, modifica las condicio-
nes originales al explorar la interacción entre aprendientes
del inglés como lengua extranjera en la Benemérita
Universidad Autónoma de Puebla (BUAP). Sigue los mis-
mos parámetros de Foster: producción de lenguaje, calidad
del input y calidad del output. La diferencia en los partici-
pantes evidentemente afectó los resultados donde el corpus
obtenido muestra una producción significativa de nego-
ciación e interacción. Esta disparidad coincide con el estudio
de Pica, Holliday, Lewis, y Morgenthaler (1989) en donde la
interacción negociada se reporta viva y benéfica cuando se
usa en combinación con otros principios pedagógicos que
promueven la adquisición del lenguaje.

This research project was carried out in Facultad de
Lenguas Benemérita Universidad Autónoma de Puebla
(BUAP), which is responsible for educating and training
teachers for foreign language (FL) instruction. Its secondary
mission is to provide a link between the communities within
the state of Puebla through specific outreach programs such
as the courses for modern languages. One such program is
known as the "Cursos de Extensión Universitaria (CEU),"
which are short courses mainly given to the general public.
The focus of this research is located in the interaction occur-
ring among English as a foreign language (EFL) students in
this program. The purpose was to explore the ways class-
room interaction inhibits or promotes interactional modifica-
tions in the language production of students. This study sets
out to observe the extent to which EFL upper-intermediate
learners produce comprehensible oral input in general and
modified output, particularly as they engage in group- or
pair-work in a natural classroom setting. It also seeks to see
if task type and participant structure may affect speech pro-
duction and interactional modifications.
Statement of the Problem
Following second language acquisition (SLA) research tradi-
tion, the study analyzes language interactions in controlled
conditions, determined by "task type" and "participant struc-
ture" as accurately suggested by D. Foster (1998, p. 14). But,
it goes beyond laboratory conditions situating the study in a
"Mexican classroom." The process of research is also con-
trolled as it follows D. Foster's (1998) original questions

A Classroom View of Negotiation of
Meaning With EFL Adult Mexican Pupils
Gildardo Palma1
Abstract
The present article reports on an approximate replication of D. Foster's (1998) study on the negotiation of meaning. D. Foster
investigated the interactional adjustments produced by L2 English learners working on different types of language learning
tasks in a classroom setting. This replication study duplicates the methods of data collection and data analysis of the original
study, but alters the conditions by exploring interactional modifications in the language production of English as a foreign
language (EFL) students. It followed the three parameters set originally by D. Foster: speech production, comprehensible
input, and modified output. It was thus carried out within the Benemérita Universidad Autónoma de Puebla (BUAP). The
participants' differences were seen as affecting the results of this replication where a corpus shows participants conducting
significant amounts of meaning negotiation and producing modified output. This disparity in results is interpreted as deriving
from a closer examination of interaction as suggested by Pica, Holliday, Lewis, and Morgenthaler.

which address the three areas of Long's (1980) interactional
hypothesis exposure to new target language forms.
Given the implicit acquisitional prospective of negotiated
interaction, the question arises as to how to best create a
learning environment in which negotiation of meaning and
interactional adjustments can occur. Since the 1980s, a sig-
nificant number of studies have been carried out, which
observe language learners solving specially designed tasks.
These "referential communication tasks" have been used to
prompt interaction (Gass, 1997; Gass & Mackey, 2000; Pica,
1994).
Such tasks have been investigated as to how they induce
L2 production, the negotiation of meaning, and/or the mod-
ification of output (Gass, 1997; Gass & Mackey, 2006,
2007; Mackey, 2007; Pica, 1994). Nevertheless, studies
have typically not been conducted in classrooms: The
empirical immensity of task-based research in SLA has
taken place under laboratory conditions rather than in actual
classrooms.
Some classroom-based studies move one step further
and analyze conversational group and dyadic interaction
among L2 learners. Evidence from these studies shows that
students' interaction improves communicative use of the
L2 (Long & Porter, 1985; Taylor, 1987). A question of
interest to SLA researchers interested in the pedagogical
application of their investigations is whether the results
they have obtained can be replicated under "normal class-
room conditions" (D. Foster, 1998, p. 6). Task evaluations
performed by teachers, then, may serve as a way of testing
the transferability of research insights (R. Ellis, 1997). D.
Foster (1998) claims,
Small group work in EFL classrooms is a widespread practice,
enthusiastically endorsed in much of the literature. It is seen as
beneficial in several ways: it increases the amount of class time
available to an individual student to practise speaking the target
language; it decreases the amount of time students spend
listening (or not listening) to other class members interacting
with the teacher; it avoids the anxiety and self-consciousness
that prevent some students from speaking up in front of the
whole class; it allows the teacher more opportunity for individual
instruction. In sum, it can help to create a positive and relaxed
learning environment. (p. 1)
Research of the language produced by small groups has
intended to justify these hopes. It has been seen, for instance,
that when interacting in small groups students talk more
than they do in teacher-fronted activities, that they do not
talk less accurately or carefully (Porter, 1983), and that they
have the opportunity to practice a greater variety of speech
acts (Long, 1996).
Other research has focused on whether students working
in dyads or groups can provide each other with the
Comprehensible Input (Krashen, 1982, cited in Gass &
Varonis, 1985, 1989) that has been argued to be a crucial ele-
ment in SLA.
In this vein, D. Foster (1998) questions the extendibility
of laboratory results on negotiation for meaning in L2 class-
rooms based on her research findings. She goes on to describe
negotiation in interaction and she comes to the conclusion
that there was no significant evidence of interaction in the
classroom she studied. Classrooms are not as easily con-
trolled as laboratories; this characteristic of classrooms needs
to be taken into account when, as D. Foster does, going
beyond the laboratory to fulfill what she states as "if lan-
guage acquisition research wants to feed into teaching meth-
odology, the research environment has to be willing to move
out of the laboratory and into the classroom'' (p. 21).
Further classroom-research is needed to increase data
typicality that would support "negotiation of meaning" as a
likely construct for SLA (Eckerth, 2009; D. Foster, 1998).
This study hopes to contribute to interaction and SLAinquiry
through a replication of D. Foster's (1998) "negotiation for
meaning" study within a real classroom
Signification of the Study
Interaction, broadly stated, refers to communication among
individuals, particularly when they are "negotiating mean-
ing" or working to prevent a breakdown in communication
(Gass, 1997; Gass & Mackey, 2000; Long, 1991a, 1991b;
Pica, Doughty, & Young, 1986). Language learning may be
seen merely as input, but it requires favorable conditions
offered by an interactive context. As such, interaction is a
necessary condition for acquisition, which outweighs input
received in any other way (Eckerth, 2009). Within SLA
research, input obtained via interaction has been conceptual-
ized and researched in terms of "comprehensible input,"
"negotiation of meaning," and "comprehensible output"
(Gass & Varonis, 1994; Kaplan, 2002; Lantolf & Thorne,
2006). The interrelatedness of these three notions is con-
cisely expressed in Long's (1983, 1998, cited in Kaplan,
2002; Lantolf & Thorne, 2006; Long, 1996; Pica, 2005)
revised version of the Interaction Hypothesis. In other words,
conversational interaction in an L2 forms the basis for the
development of language rather than being only a forum for
practice of specific language features.
This has been most recently expressed by Long (1996) as
the Interaction Hypothesis: negotiation for meaning, and
especially negotiation work that triggers interactional adjust-
ments by the native speaker (NS) or more competent inter-
locutor, facilitates acquisition because it connects input,
internal learner capacities, particularly selective attention,
and output in productive ways. It is proposed that environ-
mental contributions to acquisition are mediated by selective
attention and the learner's developing L2 processing capac-
ity, and that these resources are brought together most use-
fully, although not exclusively, during negotiation for
meaning. Negative feedback obtained during negotiation
work or elsewhere may be facilitative of L2 development, at
least for vocabulary, morphology, and language-specific
Palma 3
syntax, and essential for learning certain specifiable L1­L2
contrasts.
A question of interest to FL acquisition researchers inter-
ested in the pedagogical application of their investigations is
whether the results they have obtained can be replicated
under "normal classroom conditions" (D. Foster, 1998, p. 6).
Within SLA research, input obtained via interaction has been
conceptualized and researched in terms of "comprehensible
input" (Krashen, 1981, cited in Gass & Varonis, 1994;
Lantolf & Thorne, 2006; Long, 1991a, 1991b, 1996), "nego-
tiation of meaning" (Long, 1983; ahin, 2009; Swain, 2005;
Swain & Lapkin, 1995, 1998), and "comprehensible output"
(Kaplan, 2002; Lantolf &Thorne, 2006; Swain, 1985, 1995,
2005; Swain & Lapkin, 1995). The interrelatedness of these
three notions is concisely expressed in Long's revised ver-
sion of the Interaction Hypothesis.
From the middle of the 1980s onward, a large number of
studies have been conducted which observe language learn-
ers working on specially designed tasks. These "referential
communication tasks," as they have been called (Kay &
Jones, 2008; Lantolf, & Thorne, 2006; Pica, Kang, & Sauro,
2006; Yule, 1997), such as information distribution (informa-
tion shared among vs. split between interlocutors) and infor-
mation flow between interlocutors (one-way vs. two-way).
Usually, then, such tasks have been investigated as to how
they induced L2 production, the negotiation of meaning,
and/or the modification of output (Gass, 1997; Gass &
Mackey, 2000, 2006, 2007; Lantolf & Thorne, 2006; Loewen,
2002, 2005; Mackey, 2007; Pica, 1994, 2005).
Although research on task-based learning is primarily
concerned with the cognitive and interactive conditions of
language acquisition, such studies on negotiated interaction
also argue to be directly or indirectly significant to SLA and
L2 pedagogy. Tasks, although they were developed for
research, are claimed to be of immediate applicability as a
teaching tool in the L2 classroom (Eckerth, 2009; Loewen,
2002, 2005; Long & Crookes, 1987; Long & Porter, 1985;
Pica, 2005; Pica, Holliday, Lewis, Berducci, & Newman,
1991). Conversely, these studies have typically not been con-
ducted in classrooms: The empirical immensity of task-based
research in SLA has taken place under laboratory conditions
rather than in actual classrooms. A question of some interest
to SLA researchers interested in the pedagogical application
of their research is whether the results they have obtained
can be replicated under normal classroom conditions. Task
evaluations performed by teachers, then, may serve as a way
of testing the transferability of research insights (R. Ellis,
1997, 2003, 2005).
Task evaluations performed by teachers, then, may serve
as a way of testing the transferability of research insights (R.
Ellis, 1997, 2003, 2005). D. Foster (1998) observed partici-
pants while they were working in small groups and in pairs
(dyads/participant structure) on different language learning
tasks (task types). D. Foster as teacher-researcher, could
effectively gather three sets of oral discourse production
data: (a) for the amount of speech production, she collected a
corpus of 918 c-units; (b) as for comprehensible input
(expressed in negotiation moves), she gathered a corpus of
87 moves (9.4% of the total corpus); and (c) for modified
output, she collected 20 moves (2.1% of the total corpus).
Her results inform no clear effect for task type or grouping
on the frequency of incidences of student output in the three
areas of the study.
Method
Following SLA research tradition, this study analyzes lan-
guage interaction in controlled conditions, determined by
"task type" and "participant structure." But, it goes beyond
D. Foster's original research conditions by not only situating
the study in a "Mexican classroom" but also using communi-
cative tasks taken from English as a second language (ESL)
books applied on an EFL context. The process of research is
also controlled as it follows D. Foster's (1998) questions pre-
sented below, which address the three areas of Long's (1983)
interactional hypothesis: (a) Comprehensible Input: To what
extent do students in dyads and groups negotiate for meaning
to make input comprehensible? (b) Modified Output: To
what extent do students in dyads and groups modify their
language to make it comprehensible to others? Given the
implicit acquisitional prospective of negotiated interaction,
the question arises as to how to best create a learning envi-
ronment in which negotiation of meaning and interactional
adjustments can occur. Since the 1980s, a significant number
of studies have been carried out which observe language
learners solving specially designed tasks. These "referential
communication tasks," have been used to prompt interaction
(Doughty, 2000a, b)
The Research Tradition
The design of this study integrates methodological principles
as Chaudron (1985) asserts that both qualitative and quanti-
tative approaches to research on second language learning
are considered, with the special case of second language
classroom research being used for illustration. It is evident
that both approaches are relevant to determine (a) the impor-
tant variables to investigate and (b) the relationships those
variables have to second language learning outcomes. Based
on these principles, this study is mainly quantitative, but it
includes some qualitative assumptions as Doughty's (2000)
accurately suggests,
By hearing laughs and calm breathing, researchers, when
transcribing and coding data in c-units, may assume that a
relaxed atmosphere is being preserved so as to permeate their
result with qualitative comments . . . the researcher's qualitative
comments enhance which otherwise would be raw numbers,
percentages and statistics by enlightening numbers with
meaning. (p. 110)
4 SAGE Open
This study codes participants' utterances in c-units (com-
munication units) that generated frequencies which were
interpreted on a qualitative basis following Doughty (2000)
criteria of meaning negotiation.
Measuring Spoken Performance in Interaction
One of the interesting features within interaction research
has been the different ways in which researchers have fea-
tured and measured performance (Skehan, 1998; Skehan &
Foster, 1999; Yule, 1997). To a considerable extent, the dif-
ferent choices that investigators have made have reflected
their theoretical positions. With respect to complexity, P.
Foster, Tonkyn, and Wigglesworth (2000) argue strongly for
the use of what they term theAS-unit (Assessment of Speech)
through communication units (c-units). This, they argue, is
more appropriate for a spoken language context, and pro-
vides a more appropriate measure than Text-units (T-units as
described by Hunt, 1965, cited in P. Foster et al., 2000). In
this vein, D. Foster (1998) and Eckerth (2009) articles ana-
lyze speech production through communication units
(c-units) that are explained as
Independent utterances which provide referential or pragmatic
meaning . . . By excluding false starts but allowing for ellipses,
c-units are arguably more sensitive to the transmission of
meaning and a more appropriate measure for an investigation
into oral language. (Brock, 1986, cited in D. Foster, 1998, p. 8)
Similarly, they are defined by Chaudron (1988, p. 45) as
"an independent grammatical predication: the same as a
T-unit; except that in oral language, elliptical answers to
questions also constitute complete predications." In other
words, c-units account for multiple messages within each
individual turn and, therefore, provide "a sensitive and accu-
rate measure of the amount of language produced by the par-
ticipants" (Abrams, 2003, p. 162).
The Participants
There are 10 students in an EFL upper-intermediate level
class within the "Cursos Estacionales." The participants are
presently studying the 8th of 10th required English courses
to obtain a diploma certifying their linguistic competences.
They share the same L1 background in Spanish as well as
their Mexican nationality. Their ages range from 20 to 36.
Six are females and four are males.
Pseudonyms were used to identify learners: Nashielly,
Rodrigo, Laura, Victor, and Karla have a master's degree in
business administration, whereas Francisco, Patty, Rocío,
Dulce, and Alberto hold a bachelor in arts degree in manage-
ment. Participants have been involved in business negotia-
tions overseas (mainly in the United States and the United
Kingdom). They have also carried out important projects
with international companies such as General Motors and
Volkswagen. In addition, the upper-intermediate students are
to take Cambridge First Certificate. In that respect, students
are trained in the communicative competences necessary to
fulfill Cambridge language standards. In opposition to D.
Foster's (1998) participant election criterion where subjects
"can be seen as highly typical of the very large number of
part-time learners of English throughout Britain," these
learners were representing different social realities and pro-
fessional profiles (p. 5). In this respect, such criterion is seen
as a wider view of context, which acknowledges different
social backgrounds. Thus, these are special highly trained
business people who do not belong to the common random
sample from the part-time learners in the United Kingdom.
Besides, these ones are learning English within a FL context
as opposed to D. Foster's participants who were totally inter-
acting in different L2 settings, not only in the classroom but
also out there in the streets and suburbs. These 10 partici-
pants considered necessary to enhance their English compe-
tence through constant practice of language. That is one of
the main reasons they took the course. The second reason
was to be involved in an interactional course where spoken
production was the priority. As the Facultad de Lenguas
BUAP is working with spoken interaction competences as
the Common European Framework of Reference (CEFR)
established, participants saw in this program an opportunity
to do so.
The Setting
The "CEU" were established to promote the acquisition of a
FL through admitting students from different ages and back-
grounds. The English program's syllabus entails five levels
of language attainment: intro, basic, intermediate, upper-
intermediate, and advanced. This program runs two modali-
ties: weekly and weekend courses. Weekly courses are taken
twice or 3 times a week to account for 100 hrs of language
learning, whereas weekend sessions are taken on Saturdays
and Sundays to account for 50 hrs of language learning. A
real classroom-environment was thus preserved in the week-
end modality. In addition, the protocol of data gathering was
scheduled 4 times according to the class routine. That is,
recordings were taken within four normal classes while stu-
dents were performing negotiation of meaning tasks adopted
from two sources: the Cutting Edge upper-intermediate book
(Cunningham & Moor, 1999), Tasks 2, 3, and 4 and the
MacMillan's teaching website, Task 1 (Kay & Jones, 2008).
At the time of data gathering, the class had been running
for more than 3 months, and all students had been properly
placed in the upper-intermediate level. Not only did the
teacher conduct research himself but he also influenced stu-
dents' grouping arrangements so that the possible bias of
"the observer paradox" (Labov, 1972, cited in Nunan, 1997)
could have been significantly reduced. In other words, both
the teacher's and students' common communicative task-
based approach behaviors were exerted weekly as part of the
Palma 5
class ongoing pace; nothing was altered during the whole
research process. Thus, students were acquainted to work in
dyads and groups to solve different communicative tasks
during the entire course. In addition, their permission was
granted to use the mp3 recorders to gather the data for this
article.
The Tasks
This study used, as D. Foster (1998) suggests, four types of
tasks: two for students working in dyads and two by students
working in groups of five. Two of the tasks should only be
carried out if the subjects shared "individually held informa-
tion." These are defined as "required information exchange
tasks." The other two tasks should supply similar informa-
tion to all subjects. They are explained as "optional informa-
tion exchange tasks."
1. A conscious raising task-text repair: Learners were
asked to decide on the meanings of some British idi-
oms by selecting the correct option from three differ-
ent choices within two given worksheets (A and B).
Then, the dyads had to work out an appropriate ver-
sion of the idiom to fill in some sentence gaps within
Worksheet C, pointing out that each idiom appears
only once and that it may be necessary to change the
verb forms. Completing a text repair task involved
inserting lexical items such as idioms in accordance
with tense and subject­verb agreement. Although
this task focuses on specific L2 features, it does not
face participants with isolated, de-contextualized lin-
guistic forms, thus having them make use of their
own language resources. However, as there is no
obligation to exchange information, this task is clas-
sified as optional information exchange.
2. Picture differences: Each affiliate of the dyads was
provided either Sheet A or B of a photocopy of 12
small line drawings. Some of these drawings had
slight discrepancies. Without showing each other
their versions, the learners had to describe the pic-
tures in their worksheet to the partner and decide on
their correct order. In addition, dyads were required
to create a coherent story line with those pictures.
That could only be done by learners trading informa-
tion, and was typified as "a required information."
For the small group arrangement the tasks recorded were
as follows:
3.
Consensus, the great diamond robbery: This is a
discussion task in which subjects were supposed to
pose a problem and then they were given a number
of possible courses of action. Once they had reached
a consensus on which path to follow, they got a fur-
ther piece of information which divulged the
consequences of their alternative and set them a
new problem to solve. They again had to reach a
consensus, which entailed further problems and
options until the task ended. Each group had to
work out a plan to steal the precious diamond and
escape without getting caught. As all the informa-
tion was available to all the members of the group,
this task was typified as "an optional information
exchange."
4.
The Supersaver map: Each participant received a
copy of a newspaper article about the construction of
a new supermarket, a map of the possible sites where
the supermarket could be built and an identity card
specifying not only the role each participant had
within the council of the town but also giving signifi-
cant clues about the roles which the others in the
group did not know.
Time was given for participants to familiarize with their
roles. Then, the chairperson began the debate ensuring that
everyone had anything to say. At the end of the debate, stu-
dents took a vote on whether to allow the supermarket to be
built. As this task could not have been carried out without
subjects sharing their individually held information with the
other members of the group, it was typified as "a required
information exchange."
Data Collection, Transcription, and
Coding
The first 10 min of every interaction were transcribed and
coded. The transcription system used was fairly standard.
Three periods were used to indicate a longer pause. A ques-
tion mark indicated raising intonation, an exclamation mark
indicated noticeable emphasis, and quotation marks identi-
fied words that were read from the worksheet. Score tran-
scription had been used to better account for pauses and
overlapping turns. Doughty's (2000) model was used for
faster identification of breakdowns in communication and
for revealing how the errors were followed up and repaired
(see Figure 1). Triggers, signals, responses, and reactions
were identified, classified, and coded. No effort has been
made to select examples of interactional sequences system-
atically or to choose negotiation moves according to specific
criteria, for example, their degree of "typicality." The only
principle that guided the selection was the desire to show at
least one interactional sequence from each of the learners'
dyads and groups in the corpus.
Amount of Speech Production
Not only did the coding of the data include the number of
turns and c-units (communication units) but also noted how
many of these were produced during the completion of tasks.
The definitions for these units were adopted from Long
6 SAGE Open
(1983), a c-unit is "a t-unit or isolated phrase not accompa-
nied by a verb, but which has communicative value" (p. 1).
This study used c-units as the primary units of analysis, as
they most appropriately account for those utterances that
might not be complete, lacked a verb, or are simply exclama-
tions, but are used as elements for communication.
The Negotiation Model for Analysis
The negotiation model proposed by Doughty and Pica (1986)
and used by D. Foster (1998) was adopted for this study
(Figure 1). According to Doughty and Pica (1986), the essen-
tial feature of the negotiation sequences "is the opportunity
that is provided to the learner to process utterances in the L2
which become more comprehensible" (p. 43). Her model
incorporates a trigger, a signal, a response, and a reaction. A
trigger is "an utterance or part of an utterance that is not
understood" (p. 48). A signal is used by the interlocutor to
express a lack of comprehension. A response then comes
from the first speaker trying to repair the problem. A reaction
is an extension or a response to the repair. In this article,
direct and indirect responses are considered without further
differentiation as both are part of the negotiation process.
To operationalized signals, Long's (1983) confirmation
checks, clarification requests, and comprehension checks
will be used. These types of input modifications are used to
negotiate meaning. Also following Long, the responses in
the data will be identified as repetition, expansion, or refor-
mulation. Along with the original study, negotiated interac-
tion was coded for clarification requests (a request for
further information from an interlocutor about a previous
utterance), comprehension checks (the speaker's query of the
interlocutor(s) as to whether or not they have understood
the previous speaker utterance(s)), and confirmation check
(the speaker's query as to whether or not the speaker's
[expressed] understanding of the interlocutor's meaning is
correct; D. Foster, 1998, referring to definitions from
Chaudron, 1985; see the appendix).
Modified Output
Also in accordance with the original study and to measure
modified output, the transcripts were coded using the defini-
tions from Pica et al. (1989) for semantic modification moves
(through synonym, paraphrase, for example), morphological
modification moves (through addition, substitution, or dele-
tion of inflectional morphemes and/or functors), phonologi-
cal modification moves (the pronunciation of the phonemes
/s/ in third-person singular and the use of /-t/, /-d/, /-d/, /-d/
suffix, also ­d in simple past tense), and syntactic modifica-
tion moves (through embedding and elaboration in clauses).
Results and Discussion
The replication sought to explore whether, insofar as D.
Foster's findings concerning transferability of laboratory
results to classroom conditions, transferability of experimen-
tal research findings also applies to classrooms in a different
socio-cultural context. In that, this study closely followed the
research procedures adopted in the original study, further evi-
dence will hopefully contribute to the claim that negotiation
of meaning is not only a primary factor in FL acquisition but
also the main trigger of SLA. In this vein, Eckerth (2009)
contributed with differentiate findings, by using immediately
stimulated recall interviews that reveal transcript turns where
L2 German students noticed and recognized that they acquired
a morphological, lexical, or syntactical item. In this regard,
Gourlay (2005) and Harris (2005) posit that activation of
negotiation of meaning through the task-based approach is
thoroughly supporting the paradigm that selective attention
and interpersonal communication generate SLA.
When students signal incomprehension about a lexical,
morphological or complexity task item, a response from the
other interlocutor is given trying to fill the gap . . . 15
conversational turns later the item is acquired by the speaker
who asked for clarification ( in turn 7) by using it abundantly
through the entire act speeches of the following turns. (Gourlay,
2005, p. 115)
As will be specified in the following sections, the relevant
parameters such as participants, setting, tasks, data collection
procedures, and data coding were identically or closely com-
parable with those in the original research. While observing
task-based language learner performance in an actual EFL
classroom, the coded data were presented in the form of sim-
ple totals and percentages. In the following section, the infor-
mation derived from examination of students' classroom

composition of learner dyads and groups (e.g., 1a, 2b, 3a, 4b)
and their distribution across tasks (indicated by numbers) are
typified. Mp3 recorders are identified by letters (e.g., a, b, c).
In the present study, it was generally the same students work-
ing together on the different tasks. This allowed for a perfor-
mance comparison across learners as well as across tasks. The
data will be presented according to the parameters aforemen-
tioned: The first category concerns language production, the
second category examines comprehensible input, and the
final one looks at modified output. Within each of these three
categories, tables specify the performance of the dyads as
numbers and percentages. (Quote deleted)
Language Production
The Table 1 shows that, in dyadic interaction, cross-talk
clearly reveals a less speech production for Task 2 with
required information exchange (30.75%), as compared with
the grammar Task 1. Contrastively being the exception Dyads
2a and 2e that produced 159 and 158 c-units, respectively. As
revealed by Table 2, this does not only hold true in terms of
the total of c-units produced by all dyads, but mostly also in
terms of percentages. Such a result is in conflict with D.
Foster's data, which showed an opposite ratio of participants'
c-units with less language production within the optional
information exchanged Task 1. Furthermore, compared per-
centages across dyads are inconsistent with D. Foster's study
(1998) due to the fact that the overall amount of language
production in this replica does not vary widely. This is fairly
supported by the standard deviation, which is low (3.05) with
all the scores clustered around the mean (131.8).
This table further suggests that group participant structure
allows for the production of a similar score. For Task 3, par-
ticipants' scores vary slightly from Groups 3a to 3b with a
difference of just three c-units. Moreover, for the group task
with required information exchange participants' language
production is measured with a range of 53 c-units. The results
summarized in Table 2 are similar to D. Foster's original
study where Task 3 is associated with more language produc-
tion as well. Standard deviation is even lower (2.5) showing
an index of minimum disparity among scores which assumes
that scores do not vary widely in groups as well.
As described in the previous table, there is a slightly wider
range of scores throughout all the tasks as a whole showing a
mean of 144 and a range of 101 c-units. Furthermore, the
standard deviation of 3.5 is also low indicating a narrow dis-
tance of the scores from the mean. There is a slight possibil-
ity that D. Foster's (1998) claim that the conscious raising
task-text repair (1) seemed to promote the production of an
extensive number of c-units.
Comprehensible Input
Negotiation of meaning was measured by determining the
number of negotiation moves (comprehension checks,
confirmation checks, and clarification requests) made by
each dyad and group. The scores for these variables are
shown in Table 3. The least (9.23%) was produced by Dyad
1e doing the same task. The most negotiation moves (20.65%
of c-units) were produced by Group 3b doing an optional
information exchange task.
As can be seen in Table 3, a similar tendency indicates
that the second highest score for negotiation moves (20.32%)
was for Group 3a performing an information exchange task
as compared with the second lowest (19.71%), which was
Group 4a doing a required information exchange task.
This article shows students negotiating to a significant
extent (16% of the total corpus of 2,016 c-units). In all,
313 negotiation moves were produced as a result of accom-
plishing all tasks as opposed to 87 signals of clarification
in D. Foster's study (9.5% of her total corpus). As required
information exchange tasks were adapted to elicit partici-
pants' negotiation by having them hold and give specific
information, they were expected to elicit more meaning
negotiation.
Contrastively, concise results reveal that optional infor-
mation exchange tasks are generating as much negotiation
moves as the required information ones. These insights are
seen as a direct consequence of using different tasks and
EFL participants within a different socio-cultural back-
ground. This outcome strongly contrasts with Eckerth's
(2009) and D. Foster's (1998) findings that show partici-
pants producing more negotiation moves for the required
information exchange tasks. Thus, D. Foster's "pretend and
hope strategy" is clearly not being used by the participants
of this study that seem to engage vigorously in meaning
negotiation when a breakdown in communication is pro-
duced. The significant amount of modified utterances indi-
rectly supports this claim.

L2 D. Foster's participants let signals of clarification pass
without any modification due to the fact they felt was not
necessary to negotiate meaning. A yes or no answer was
enough to clarify a comprehension check. Conversely, the
EFL participants of this study were highly involved in clari-
fication because they perceived that engaging in constant
communication would enhance their FL competences to the
fullest.
It seems warranted to conduct research which would ver-
ify such predictions in real classrooms, in settings where
learners share their mother tongue and have limited out-of-
school exposure to the target language (Eckerth, 2009; D.
Foster, 1998; Gass & Mackey, 2006; Kaplan, 2002; Mackey,
Gass, & McDonough, 2000). The present article contributes
to this line of inquiry by exploring the occurrence and value
of "negotiated interaction" among EFL upper-intermediate
Mexican learners prompted by optional and required infor-
mation exchange tasks. It thus inquires to what extent "mean-
ing negotiation" is attempted by these students in dyads and
small group work.
Table 3 clearly reveals that students without the obliga-
tion to exchange information reacted rather similarly in the
amount of negotiation they undertook. This evidence is
contrasting with D. Foster's (1998) findings that show par-
ticipants reacting very differently during the completion of
an optional information exchange task. In the same vein,
the obligation to trade information, entailed by Tasks 2 and
4, produced similar results (both of them scored 176
moves), so as to show that negotiation of meaning is pro-
lific when participants are engaged in required information
exchange tasks (Doughty & Pica, 1986, cited in Doughty,
2000a, b).
As shown in Table 1, the instances of c-units these tasks
generated from participants were within a much narrower
range of 11.42. Despite the high frequencies of negotiation of
meaning, the corpus is of 313 moves representing 16% of the
total corpus compose of 2,016 c-units. Unlike D. Foster's
(1998) insights that show participants not engaging in mean-
ing negotiation, this study shows most students at least nego-
tiating to some extent. Table 4 shows that all of participants
thus attempted some negotiation work.
Table 4 illustrates the distribution of negotiation moves
within dyads and groups. As can be seen, an analysis of the
way that individual members shared the production of nego-
tiation moves reveals, not surprisingly, that some shared
more or less equally (e.g., Dyads 1c, 1e, and 2b, and Group
3b), others less equally (e.g., Dyads ld and 2e and Groups 3a
and 4a), and yet others very unequally (e.g., Dyad 2a and
Group 4b). It is important to note that the required informa-
tion exchange task showed the shared responsibility for
negotiation only in 2b, 2c, and 2d (three of them dyads) and
Group 4b. On these occasions, one member was very domi-
nant: In 2b, Patty produced 10 and Francisco 9 negotiation
moves; in 2c Victor produced 7 and Rocio 9, respectively; in
4b, Nashielly is slightly exceeding Alberto with 12 and 11,
respectively. A closer look at the data in Table 8 reveals how
dyads shared the production of meaning negotiation moves
as compared with the most reluctant interlocutor.
As compared with D. Foster's (1998) original study, this
article shows participants meaning negotiating to a great
extent.
The incidence of modified output (i.e., utterances that
were morphologically, semantically, syntactically, or phono-
logically altered in response to a negotiation move) was cal-
culated for each dyad and group. Most modification moves
were made by Dyad 2e doing a task that required agreement
on sequencing some line drawings. Furthermore, Table 5
shows the other dyads closely following 2e (e.g., 2d with

14.61% and 2c with 14.58%). Interestingly, for Type 1 that
was a conscious raising task-text repair, Dyad 1c produced
20 interactional modifications (14.60% modified output),
closely followed by Dyad 1d that produced 15 instances of
modified output (15.15% of the total of c-units produced by
this dyad in particular).
Table 5 illustrates the distribution of negotiation moves
within dyads and groups. As can be seen, an analysis of the
way that individual members shared the production of nego-
tiation moves reveals, not surprisingly, that some shared
more or less equally (e.g., Dyads 1c, 1e, and 2b and Group
3b), others less equally (e.g., Dyads ld and 2e and Groups 3a
and 4a), and yet others very unequally (e.g., Dyad 2a and
Group 4b).
As can be seen in Table 6, figures are broken down to
show the negotiation moves each interlocutor made within
dyads. In the majority of cases, the reluctant participants'
ratio of negotiation moves varied widely from their interloc-
utors. In Task 1, Karla negotiated twice as vigorously as
Nashielly. Similarly, during the completion of Task 2 Karla
was the one who exceeded in the meaning negotiation
endeavor. Francisco who has been seen as a dominant inter-
locutor in Task 4a producing 13 negotiation moves just pro-
duced 8 in Task 1 with a 62% as compared with Patty who
contributed 38% more negotiation moves to the same task.
Table 6 shows that, in dyadic interaction, cross-talk com-
parison sheds light on meaning negotiation. Laura who was
ahead with 14% of Rodrigo in Task 1 increased their domi-
nance with a 44% in Task 2 with required information
exchange. Almost the same ratio is kept by Rocio and Victor
with Rocio being slightly above Victor throughout Tasks 1
and 2. Dulce also maintained the dominance of meaning
negotiation with a 67% ahead in Task 1, but reducing her
dominance to 25% during Task 2.
Table 6 reveals that the interlocutor who dominated in one
dyad dominated all dyads and tasks. Karla exceeded twice as
compared with their interlocutors when signaling incompre-
hension in both tasks. Similarly, Patty who dominated her
interlocutor producing twice as many negotiation moves in
Task 1 reduced his domination in Task 2. Furthermore, Rocio
and Dulce slightly exceeded their interlocutors when asking
for clarification in Task 2. It is important to note that interac-
tants engaged significantly in meaning negotiation during
Task 2 with required information exchange. This insight is
partially in accordance with D. Foster's (1998) and Eckerth's
(2009) study.
Modified Output
Table 5 summarizes cross-talk analysis through group inter-
action. Group 3b produced 43 frequencies of interactional

required information exchange, participants produced a wide
range of 13 modified outputs. Group 4b produced most inter-
actional modifications (42 modified output moves or
22.11%). Participants produced a significant number of
interactional modifications. A concise analysis throughout
the scores is called for as students generated a significant
amount of optional and required information exchange. This
is seen as evidence of the occurrence of modified output that
would be a direct consequence of cognitive processes (Pica
et al., 1989). D. Foster's (1998) claim that if one student
dominated the conversation in one task, he or she tended to
dominate across all tasks and group structures, is strongly
proved by the empirical data of this article. Data within this
study are showing participants negotiating to some extent
with all signals of incomprehension triggering a significant
quantity of interactional adjustments.
Tables 7 and 8 show participants eagerly engaged in task
completion producing high frequencies of interactional
adjustments. This insight is due to the fact that signals of
incomprehension were not always directed at one individual,
but many who took responsibility for answering. In contrast,
4a was the participants' arrangement that produced less out-
put adjustments. The score is also informing, a total of 29
interactional output moves were attempted as a response to
Francisco exhaustive meaning negotiation. These interac-
tional adjustments were highly semantic due to the fact that
participants held individual informative roles that were cru-
cial to the task completion.
As can be seen in Tables 7 and8, the tasks with required
information exchange provided most output modifications.
Such results highly contrast with D. Foster's (1998) study
where groups and dyads were generally noisier and none of
the participants took the responsibility of answering confir-
mations and clarifications. In addition, the absence of any
strict requirement to fulfill the task inclined her students not
to pay close attention to the form of their language.
As can be revealed in Tables 4, 7, and8, the most notable
feature is there were not any frequencies of zeros. That is,
students remaining silent or applying D. Foster's hope and
pass strategy. Such an insight is definitely in conflict with D.
Foster's quantitative results: 28 scores were for 0, and a fur-
ther 8 were for only 1. Nevertheless, this study is strongly
related to the data reported by Pica et al. (1989), which
showed that their 10 NSs made a total of 327 negotiation
moves during the three tasks they were set, and that the 10
non-native speakers (NNSs) interlocutors made 327
responses, of which an impressive 116 were modified. Within
this study, a total of 312 responses were interactional modi-
fied out of 313 negotiation moves. Furthermore, D. Foster's
claim that a NNS deciding that a breakdown in communica-
tion is the fault of his NNS interlocutor, might not feel
obliged to attempt a repair is inconsistent with this study
results. Overall participants were engaged in meaning nego-
tiation to some extent with 99.6% of output adjustments
being produced by more competent interlocutors.
Summary and Conclusion
This study contributes to the applied linguistics field through
showing reliable data that support "negotiation of meaning"
as an effective way of constructing Foreign Language
Acquisition. However, it was carried out with a small sample
that makes it hard to generalize to a wider Mexican popula-
tion. In addition, by virtue of being a cross-sectional study
where interactions had been recorded through four class

sessions, a longitudinal study taking into account recalled
sessions with participants was not possible to be accom-
plished. Although figures seem not to address a significant
correlation between task type and participant structure, tasks
with optional information exchange elicited a considerable
amount of meaning negotiation and interactional
adjustments.
(a) Amount of language production: Participants uttered
an impressive corpus of 2,016 communication units as
opposed to D. Foster's corpus of 918 c-units. This in turn
supports the fact that they were intensive language produc-
ers. None of them remained silent or shy. Even the ones who
appeared to be at times hesitant contributed with substantial
lexical items to the fulfillment of the four tasks. (b)
Comprehensible input: A significant corpus of meaning
negotiation was also gathered (313 negotiation moves) as
opposed to D. Foster's 7 moves. Participants seemed to be
signaling incomprehension vigorously when a breakdown in
communication was raised. (c) Modified output: A notewor-
thy corpus of interactional modifications was obtained (312
responses) as opposed to D. Foster's 20 moves. In addition,
all participants produced at least some output as a response
to a signal of incomprehension. Being nearly all negotiation
moves responded with interactional modifications. The con-
sciousness raising task, with optional information exchange,
generated morphological modifications throughout four of
five dyads. That is, this study showed participants' gram-
matical awareness by identifying the morphological inflec-
tion of the third-person singular in present tense when coping
with some phrasal verbs such as "economical with the truth"
in the conscious raising task-text repair (1). This research
based on tasks taps into grammatical modifications and
shows that learners can be manipulated into negotiations for
meaning that involve verb tense and aspect.
In this vein, Pica, Kanagy, and Falodun (1993) accept that
negotiation for meaning (when it occurs) is far more likely to
be over lexical items than over grammatical morphology.
Eight of 10 participants of this study nevertheless showed
grammatical awareness by identifying the morphological
inflection of the third-person singular in present tense when
coping with some phrasal verbs in Task 1. Pica et al. (1993)
calls for research based on tasks that will "tap into grammati-
cal modifications" and which will presumably show if learn-
ers can be manipulated into negotiations for meaning that
will involve, for example, verb tense and aspect. Again a
close view of the data reveals that the conscious raising
grammar task fairly answers Pica's query by triggering most
students' signals of incomprehension that were morphologi-
cally modified by their interlocutors.
Implications for Teaching English for Students of
Other Languages (TESOL): A Classroom Stance
of Negotiation of Meaning
It is needed to explore why so many of the students in this
study were motivated to initiate or pursue negotiation for
meaning. It is not difficult to suggest possible explanations.
According to D. Foster (1998), to hold up the interaction
every time there is a problem utterance, and painstakingly to
attempt to repair it is a sure way of making the task frustrat-
ingly slow. Similarly, indicating to others each time you fail
to grasp their meaning is a sure way of making yourself look
and feel incompetent.
Unlike D. Foster's participants, the students of this study
were willingly engaged in meaning negotiation. They did not
seem to be embarrassed or incompetent due to the fact that
they perceive negotiation on a different way. Such perception
was strongly related to the practice of language. The more
they negotiated, the further they accomplished their own
stance of the tasks' purposes. Contrary to Aston's (1986,
cited in Eckerth, 2009) assumption that those group-work
tasks that are designed to maximize negotiation for meaning
may end up de-motivating and discouraging students by
making them feel unsuccessful and ineffective; the tasks
adapted in this study had an opposite effect. In the same vein,
Pica (1994) acknowledges that negotiating for meaning is a

natural communication strategy that can be harnessed to pro-
mote SLA. The present study directly supports this claim.
Implications for a Task-Based Approach
Within SLA
It is strongly acknowledged that the task designed proce-
dures proposed by Pica (1994), Gass (1997), Gass and
Mackey (2006), Eckerth (2009), and D. Foster (1998) to pro-
mote meaning negotiation. Students singular response to
tasks, within this study, demonstrates that tasks of the kind
commonly used in SLA research "are not just performed but
rather are interpreted, resulting in activity that is `con-
structed' by the participants in accordance with their particu-
lar motives and goals" (R. Ellis, 2003, p. 187).
Using transcript-based and individualized post hoc tests,
some studies show in what ways learners exploit tasks
beyond the pedagogical focus of the task, thereby adapting
the task to their individual learning needs and goals (Adams,
2007; Eckerth, 2009; Loewen, 2002, 2005; Nabei & Swain,
2002; Swain & Lapkin, 1995, 1998; Williams, 2001). In this
vein, studies such as Kumaravadivelu (1991, 2006),
Coughlan and Duff (1994), Gourlay (2005), and Harris
(2005) have revealed different activities emerging from the
same task when completed by different learners. Thus, what
has been called the "permeability of tasks" (Mondada &
Pekarek Doehler, 2004, p. 512) or their "interactional recon-
figuration" (Mondada & Pekarek Doehler, 2004, p. 510)
points to major challenges in task-based research. There
seem to be good reasons for bringing together qualitative
analyses of contextualized task-based interactions with
quantifications of isolated linguistic units when researching
issues of SLA. Rather than perpetuating unproductive "para-
digm wars" (Edge & Richards, 1998, p. 335), such a multi-
methodological perspective seeks to connect different
approaches "to link, but not reduce, one perspective to
another" (Wertsch, 1998, cited in N. Ellis & Larsen-Freeman,
2006, p. 578).
Such an integrated approach might be one way to inform
academics about potential gaps between "intended" and
"actual" pedagogy (Seedhouse, 2005) and to improve the
content validity of research constructs. If supported by further
research, evidence of learners' task adaptation, this author
suggests, does not question the validity of interactional adjust-
ments and its significance for SLA (Doughty, 2004; Gass,
2003; Gass & Mackey, 2006, 2007; Mackey, 2007; Pica et al.,
2006). It also does not, as Skehan and Foster (1999, p. 117)
suggest, prevent tasks and their range of influence from being
researchable "at the level of probable outcomes" (my empha-
sis). However, they continue, this does not imply that "task
characteristics might have a deterministic impact on perfor-
mance" (my emphasis).
Combining a stimulated recall methodology with an anal-
ysis of task performance, a future study can try to show in
what way learners' task perceptions can influence their task-
based interactions. This study will also attempt to contribute
to the understanding of task-based EFL classroom learning
as being perceived by the learners as a cognitive activity, a
communicative event, and a social process. However, as the
empirical base of these and related findings is still limited,
they call for more classroom-based interventionist studies
(Brumfit & Mitchell, 1990).
