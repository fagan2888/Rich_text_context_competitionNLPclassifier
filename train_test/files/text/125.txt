Research Question
Changes in the interest rates have two direct effects on banks: First, concerning new
business, yields on loans and customer deposits change (price effect) and, second, banks
adjust their balance sheet composition (quantity effect) because demand and supply for
their various products differently react to an interest rate shock. From financial statement
data, one can often only infer the total effect. In our analysis, we decompose the total
effect into the price and quantity effects.
Contribution
To decompose the total effect, we use data that was collected by the banking supervisor
in summer 2015 in a survey among all the small and medium-sized banks in Germany. In
this survey, banks were requested to determine their interest income and other P&L com-
ponents in various scenarios. In our analysis, we concentrate on three of these scenarios
which are especially suitable for decomposing the total effect.
Results
We find that in the short run (one year) the price effect is nearly eight times as large as
the quantity effect. By contrast, in the medium term (after five years), the price effect
is only twice as important as the quantity effect. We find that large banks adjust their
balance sheets more strongly than small banks, but large banks are more impacted by the
price effect. In addition, it turns out that the current balance sheet composition explains
the price effect more weakly the longer the horizon is. With the quantity effect, it is the
other way around: the longer the horizon, the higher the explanatory power of the current
balance sheet composition. This can be explained by the presumption that banks only
gradually adjust the composition of their balance sheet.

Abstract
Using unique supervisory survey data on the impact of a hypothetical interest rate
shock on German banks, we analyse price and quantity effects on banks' net interest
margin components under different balance sheet assumptions. In the first year, the
cross-sectional variation of banks' simulated price effect is nearly eight times as large
as the one of the simulated quantity effect. After five years, however, the importance
of both effects converges. Large banks adjust their balance sheets more strongly
than small banks, but they are impacted more strongly by the price effect. The
quantity effects are explained better by a bank's current balance sheet composition,
the longer the forecast horizon. The opposite holds for banks' price effect.

1 Introduction
An interest rate shock has two direct effects on banks' net interest margin: a price effect
and a quantity effect. The price effect results from the change in interest rates assuming
the balance sheet structure and size to be constant. By contrast, the quantity effect on
the balance sheet structure and size is due to banks' and depositors' behavioral adjust-
ments as a consequence of the interest rate change. In empirical data, we usually observe
only the combined effect, i.e. the addition of the price and the quantity effects. Using
unique supervisory survey data on German small and medium-size banks, we are able to
disentangle the simulated price and quantity effects of net interest margin components
following a hypothetical 100 basis points downward shift in the yield curve. The data set
contains simulated data on net interest margin components for a forecast horizon of one
year, two, three, four and five years, which also allows us to analyse the time dimension
of these effects.
We believe that distinguishing between the two effects is an important issue for three
reasons: first, the time profiles of the two effects are expected to be different. Price ef-
fects are likely to have an immediate impact whereas quantity effects can be assumed to
gradually materialize due to behavioural and financial frictions. For instance, depositors
exhibit behavioural rigidities and banks' portfolio decisions are subject to various regu-
latory constraints. When setting behavioural assumptions on the balance sheet structure
and size in microprudential or macroprudential stress tests, the time profile of both effects
plays a key role.
Second, from a financial stability perspective, it is crucial to know how banks react to
shocks and adjust their balance sheets because this reaction can have considerable impact
on other financial intermediaries and on the real economy. From the microprudential
perspective of a single bank, the balance sheet adjustments may be perfectly rational.
However, if all banks react in the same way, then this behaviour may have unintended
negative externalities. For instance, as a consequence of considerable losses due to an
interest rate shock, a significant number of banks may shrink their balance sheets thereby
reducing the credit supply to the real economy.
Third, the impact of price changes on banks' income statements are often dealt with in
a symmetric manner: the effect of a price increase is assumed to equal ­ in absolute terms
­ the effect of a decrease in prices. This may be a good approximation if only the price
effect is considered, but the quantity effect due to balance sheet adjustments is expected
to work in the majority of cases in favour of the bank which leads to an asymmetry.
Our contribution is threefold. First, our study is among the first that focuses on the
question, under which setting a static or dynamic balance sheet assumption seems to
be justified in micro- and macroprudential stress testing exercises. Second, our study is
among the few that deals with the separation of the price and quantity effects in the wake
of a macroeconomic shock. This separation makes it possible to quantify the relative
importance of the price and quantity effects. Third, we are the first to have a time
dimension at our disposal. Our results can help in gaining a general understanding of
balance sheet reactions which are mostly at the core of macroprudential stress testing
exercises.
Our supervisory survey data include forecasted net interest margin for the five years
following the base year 2014 under different scenarios. In addition, we have data concern-
1
ing the balance sheet composition of these banks in the base year 2014. Our results show
that, in the first year, the cross-sectional variation of the simulated price effect is nearly
eight times as large as the one of simulated quantity effect. After five years, however, the
magnitudes of these two effects are converging as the simulated price effect is just twice
as large as the simulated quantity effect. We conclude that in interest rate stress tests
with a short forecast horizon a static balance sheet assumption might be justified, but
not for the medium term. In addition, it is theoretically motivated and empirically shown
that the simulated quantity effects are explained better by a bank's current balance sheet
composition, the longer the forecast horizon. The opposite holds for banks' price effect.
The paper is structured as follows. In Section 2, we give a short overview of the related
literature. In Section 3, we introduce empirical modeling. Section 4 elaborates on the
data we use and in Section 5, we give the empirical results. Section 6 concludes.
2 Literature
The contribution of our study to the existing literature is twofold: first, to the literature
on stress testing and second, to the literature on interest margins.
When it comes to stress testing, our study can help to assess whether a static bal-
ance sheet assumption might be justified or a dynamic balance sheet assumption might
be necessary. The methodologies of the supervisory stress tests performed by the Bank
of England, the European Banking Authority, the US Federal Reserve and the Bundes-
bank/BaFin treat the balance sheet composition and size differently.
The Bank of England's annual stress test1 allows banks to account for changes in
the composition and size of their balance sheets (bottom-up stress test). Banks should
explicitly incorporate corporate plans of costs and business changes. In order to ensure
comparability of those changes, the methodology restricts these changes, for instance, by
demanding that lending should not exceed the current market share (see Bank of England
(2016)).
In the European Union, the European Banking Authority (EBA) ST 2016 is run
under the static balance sheet assumption in terms that maturing assets and liabilities
are replaced with similar financial instruments (bottom-up stress test). The methodology
does not allow for mitigating management actions, such as changes in the composition
and size of the balance sheet. Instead, the impact of this assumption is considered in
the evaluation and application of the stress test results (see European Banking Authority
(2016)).
The US Federal Reserve applies a dynamic balance sheet approach (top-down and
bottom-up) for the US Comprehensive Capital Analysis and review (CCAR) ST 2016
mirroring the expected balance sheet development through the forecast horizon in line
with banks' corporate plans (see Federal Reserve System (2016)).
The Bundesbank/BaFin ST 2015 accounts for a static and dynamic balance sheet
(bottom-up) under the negative interest rate scenario, respectively. The static balance
sheet is used to ensure comparable results and to illustrate the counterfactual outcome
without active management actions. The dynamic scenario is meant to account for ex-

and microprudential-related Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) in meeting their statutory objectives

ogenously and endogenously driven changes in the volume, resulting in changes in the
composition and size of the balance sheet (see Bundesbank (2016)).
Concerning the literature on banks' interest margins, we contribute to three strands;
namely, the composition of the interest rate pass-through, the time profile of the interest
rate pass-through as well as the the level of interest rate margins against the backdrop of
the balance sheet composition
First, our paper contributes to the literature on how banks react to a macroeconomic
shock. Memmel and Schertler (2013) perform a separation of changes in the net interest
margin of German banks into a price effect and a quantity effect, where the quantity effect
is due to balance sheet adjustments and can be seen as a measure of banks' behaviour.
Concerning this aspect of their research, their study is closest to ours. Unlike them, we
do not use realized data from banks' financial statements, but rather banks' simulated
data on interest margins under different scenarios, where the distinction between price
and quantity effects can be directly inferred. In addition, we have a time dimension of up
to five years of the forecast horizon.
Market interest rates are an important macroeconomic factor, especially for banks,
and many studies on banks' interest margins include the interest rate level as an explana-
tory variable (see, for instance, Bolt, de Haan, Hoeberichts, Oordt, and Swank (2012)).
Albertazzi and Gambacorta (2009) show that increasing long term market rates affect
interest income positively, while the opposite holds true for non-interest income. Busch
and Memmel (2015) make the impact of the interest rate level a central question of their
paper. Using a long time series of the German banking system, they show that a down-
ward shift in the term structure is at first beneficial for the banks' net interest margin,
but that this downward shift reduces the net interest margin in the medium and long
term. Using the time dimension of our survey data, we can see whether the short-term
effect is qualitatively different from the medium and long-term effects. Furthermore, we
are able to disentangle the influence of the balance sheet adjustment.
Second, our paper contributes to the empirical literature that examines the pass-
through from market rates to bank rates (See, for instance, Kleimeier and Sander (2006),
Schlueter, Busch, Hartmann-Wendels, and Sievers (2016) and Pangopoulos and Spiliotis
(2015)). This pass-through is most often found to be incomplete, with differences re-
garding various product categories (see, for instance, De Graeve, De Jonghe, and Vennet
(2007)). In such studies, the bank rates are often assumed to be a linear combination of
their own past values and of past and present market rates. By contrast, in our survey
data, we can determine the pass-through directly and for different time horizons (up to
five years).
Third, we contribute to the literature that explains the level of interest margins us-
ing banks-specific variables (see, for instance, Ho and Saunders (1981), Angbazo (1997),
Maudos and de Guevara (2004), and Busch and Memmel (2016)). These studies find that
a bank's credit risk, its exposure to interest rate risk, its operating costs and its market
power (among other things) determine the level of the interest margins. Some papers
show how business models influence interest margins. For example, Lepetit, Nys, Rous,
and Tarazi (2008) and Busch and Kick (2015) find a negative relationship between the
interest rate margin and non-interest income and argue that banks react to decreasing
interest margins by diversifying into new activities. Our approach differs from these stud-
ies: We investigate how far a bank's current balance sheet composition can explain future
3
changes in the interest margins.
3 Empirical Modelling
In the literature, banks' net interest margins are often explained by bank-specific variables.
In our paper, we do not explain the level of interest margins, but their changes due to an
interest rate shock. As bank-specific variables, we use banks' balance sheet compositions
in the base year (here: in the year 2014). That means that we aim to explain the bank's
simulated price and quantity effects by its current balance sheet composition, using a
stylized model.
We assume that the price effect ah
, i.e. the effect on the net interest margin under
the assumption of a constant balance sheet, can be modelled in a basic setting:
ah
= (w0
+ (1 - w0
) ˇ h
) r + h
(1)
where we assume that the asset-side of a bank consists of only two types of assets,
namely overnight interbank loans (portion: w0
) and customer loans of longer maturity
(portion: 1 - w0
). h
gives the share of customer loans which have matured in the period
from 0 to time h, r is size of the interest shock and h
is a noise term.
Equation (1) gives the business that is affected by the shift in the yield curve (mul-
tiplied by the shock size r): the interbank loans which have matured immediately in
addition to those customer loans that have already matured (share: h
).
Proposition 1: Given the model above, concerning the price effect ah
, the explanatory
power of the current balance sheet composition (here: w0
) is falling with the length
of the forecast horizon h.
Proof: From Equation (1), one can calculate the variance of the variable ah
and its
covariance to the weight w0
, where we assume that the stochastic comes from the weight
w0
(variance: 2
w
) and the noise term h
(variance: 2

), which we assume to be independent
from the weight w0
:
var (ah
) = (r)2 (1 - h
)22
w
+ 2

(2)
and
cov (ah
, w0
) = r ˇ (1 - h
) ˇ 2
w
(3)
Defining the (positive) ratio 
:= 2

/ (r)2 2
w
, we obtain as the coefficient of
determination R2
a,h
:= cov2 (ah
, w0
) / (var(ah
) ˇ 2
w
) for the regression of the direct effect
ah
on the current weight w0
R2
a,h
=
(1 - h
)2
(1 - h
)2 + 
. (4)
With the help of some conversions, one sees that the derivative of R2
a,h
with respect
to the horizon h is negative, proving the statement in Proposition 1.
The economic intuition behind the declining coefficient of determination R2
a,h
is that,
in the short run, the banks differ in terms of the extent to which the price effect of the
4
interest rate shock is passed-through, in the model above expressed by different weights
w0
. In the long run, however, the price effect a of the interest rate shock is similar across
all banks because finally all positions are replaced by new business; in the model above,
this corresponds to limh
h
= 1. That is why the coefficient of determination R2
a,h
decreases with respect to the horizon h.
The quantity effect bh
, i.e. the effect on the net interest margin due to balance sheet
adjustments, can be modelled as follows in the model from above:
bh
= c ˇ (wh
- w0
) + h
(5)
where c is a constant and h
is an error term that introduces some noise with variance
2

.2 We assume that a bank cannot immediately reach the new optimal weight Ż
w, but
approaches it following an autoregressive process of order 1, which can be motivated by
adjustment costs (see Appendix 1), where 0 <  < 1:
wh
=  +  ˇ wh-1
(6)
Proposition 2: Given the model above, concerning the quantity effect bh
, the explana-
tory power of the current balance sheet composition (here: w0
) is increasing with
the length of the forecast horizon h.
Proof: Using some conversions, one can express the weight wh
as a function of the original
weight w0
:
wh
= h ˇ w0
+  ˇ
1 - h
1 - 
(7)
combining this expression with Equation (5), one can determine the variance of bh
as
var (bh
) = c2 ˇ (1 - h)2 ˇ 2
w
+ 2

(8)
and its covariance to the original weight w0
as
cov (bh
, w0
) = -c ˇ 2
w
ˇ 1 - h . (9)
Again, defining the (positive) ratio 
:= 2

/2
w
, we obtain for the coefficient of determi-
nation R2
b,h
for the regression of the quantity effect bh
on the original weight w0
:
R2
b,h
=
c2 ˇ (1 - h)2
c2 ˇ (1 - h)2 + 
(10)
With the help of some conversions, one sees that the derivative of R2
b,h
with respect to
the horizon h is positive, proving the statement in Proposition 2.
Concerning the increasing coefficient of determination R2
b,h
, the intuition is that, due
to adjustment costs and subsequent partial adjustments, the current balance sheet com-
position has all the more explanatory power, the longer the horizon h.
2Again, the noise term h
is assumed to be independent from the weight w0
.

4 Data
4.1 Low-interest-rate survey
The empirical analyses are based on data from the supervisory survey "Profitability and
resilience of German credit institutions in the low-interest-rate setting 2015", which in-
cludes approximately 1,500 German small and medium-size universal banks directly su-
pervised by the Bundesbank and Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin). This
survey was conducted in 2015 to track how banks intend to tackle the prevailing challenges
of the low-interest-rate environment until 2019. First, in a low-interest-rate environment,
expiring assets need to be replaced by lower remunerated assets. Second, history still
shows that most deposit rates are de facto floored at zero by banks due to intense compe-
tition and endeavoring not to lose customers to rivals. The floor means for banks that in
a continuing low-interest-rate environment deposit funding becomes more expensive than
market funding. For banks with high deposit-funding, the combination of lower asset
remuneration and de facto floored deposit rates yields to decreasing net interest margins
(see Drescher, Ruprecht, Gruender, Papageorgiou, Tows, and Brinkmann (2016)).
Against this backdrop, the Bundesbank and BaFin asked banks to populate the su-
pervisory survey, which contains a bank-specific planning scenario, four additional super-
visory interest rate stress test scenarios as well as separate credit and market risk stress
tests. With regard to the interest rate stress test scenarios, banks had to simulate in a
bottom-up approach manner the impact on their income statements and balance sheets.
We focus on the following three interest rate stress test scenarios. First, the supervisory
low-interest-rate environment scenario presumes interest rates will remain at levels as of
31 December 2014. Each of the following supervisory interest rate scenarios assumes an
abrupt and persistent change in the yield curve. Second and third, the two supervisory
scenarios with a negative interest rate shock assume a sudden downward shift of the yield
curve by 100 basis points as of 31 December 2014; one with a static balance sheet and
one with a dynamic balance sheet. The assumption of a static balance sheet implies that
maturing business is being replaced by similar new business, i.e. matching in terms of
credit quality, asset and liability structure and total assets. This assumption is not made
in the dynamic balance sheet scenario, where banks are allowed to adjust their balance
sheets as a response of the shock. In the dynamic scenario, banks were allowed to take
countermeasures in terms of portfolio shifts.
In order to disentangle banks' simulated price and quantity effects for the negative
interest rate shock scenario in a meaningful way, we applied a thorough cleaning algorithm.
First, we dropped those banks that provided missing data in at least one of the relevant
scenarios. This cleaning is considered necessary to ensure a balanced panel for aggregating
the results. Second, we dropped those banks that used a static balance sheet structure
or adapted the dynamic balance sheet structure of its planning scenario to the negative
interest rate shock scenario. This cleaning is considered necessary since the balance sheet
structure should deviate between different scenarios against the backdrop of endogenous
and exogenous drivers. Third, we dropped all price and quantity effects for the net
interest margins below the first and above the 99th percentile. In the end, we obtain a
data set consisting of around 400 banks compared with around 1,500 that took part in
the survey. In what follows, the empirical results are derived from this restricted sample.

Additionally, we provide the results for the full sample in the robustness checks in Section
5.4

Starting from 2014, German small and medium-size banks provided Bundesbank and
BaFin with simulations on net interest margin components over the next five years, until
2019 (see Figure 1). In a persistent low-interest-rate environment scenario and static
balance sheet, the median bank simulates the net interest margin to go down to 1.53% of
total assets. Assuming a 100 basis points downward shift of the yield curve, the median
bank simulates the net interest margin to drop to 1.35% of total assets with a static
balance sheet respectively to 1.38% of total assets with a dynamic balance sheet. All
developments also apply beyond the median bank for different deciles.
Given these scenario designs, our study focuses on the low-interest-rate scenario (here:
scenario k = 0, which we will use as our benchmark) and the two negative interest rate
shock scenarios with a static (here: scenario k = 1) and dynamic balance sheet (here:
scenario k = 2), respectively. We chose these three scenarios because they enable us to
carry out the separation of the simulated price and the quantity effects.3
As we normalise the net interest margin, interest income and expenses with total assets,
it is worthwhile starting by also taking a look at how banks' total assets evolve in the
negative interest rate shock scenario. Given lower interest rate levels, the vast majority of
banks expects total assets to increase from 2014 to 2019 respectively, being higher in the
dynamic balance sheets scenario compared to the static balance sheet scenario in 2019.
For instance, total assets of banks grouped in deciles are expected to increase between
-7.0% and 4.8% (see Table 1). Contemporarily, banks expect costumer loans to increase
relative to costumer deposits. With respect to the banks grouped in deciles, these ratios
are expected to grow from 0.9% to 6.6% (see Table 1). Nevertheless, most banks still
expect to have more costumer deposits than costumer loans (see Figure 3).
In Figure 2, we illustrate how the survey data are used for the analyses. For instance,
if we assume that in the first year (h = 1) the bank i's interest income margin (IIM)
is 300 bp (per total assets of 31 December 2014) in the benchmark scenario k = 0 with
3Please note that there is no mechanism to ensure that the individual responses of the banks add up
to a macroeconomic equilibrium where aggregated supply meets aggregated demand.

dynamic balance sheets and a negative interest rate shock). In the first year, the price
effect can be calculated as a1,i
= 280bp - 300bp = -20bp, the quantity effect amounts to
b1,i
= 285bp - 280bp = 5bp and the total effect is tot1,i
= 285bp - 300bp = -15bp.
The scenario k = 2 with dynamic balance sheets (allowing for adjustments in the
composition and size) and a negative interest rate shock was not at the center of attention
of the participating banks. The banks seemed to have put more effort in determining other
scenarios, for instance the scenario where they used the parameters with which they are
planning for the future. To take into account the considerable reduction in observations,
we run a robustness check to determine whether the results qualitatively remain the same
under less severe cleaning.
4.2 Balance sheet composition
We use each bank's balance sheet composition as of 31 December 2014 (base year) to
evaluate its power of determination for the simulated price and quantity effects. The
banks' asset side is broken down into customer loans (three brackets concerning the loans'
initial maturity: up to one year, one to five years, and more than five years), interbank
loans (four brackets) and bond holdings. Concerning the liabilities, we split them into
deposits from non-financials, savings deposits, interbank loans (four brackets: overnight,
up to one year; more than one to two years, and more than two years) and issued bonds.
The weighted balance sheet composition of our restricted sample of banks can be seen in

Using the supervisory survey data (see Subsection 4.1), we investigate the banks' P&L
components that are directly related to interests rates, namely the net interest margin

Figure 2: Scenarios
In this figure, the three survey scenarios that we use in our study are displayed as small circles, namely
the benchmark scenario k = 0 with static balance sheets and no interest rate shock, the scenario k = 1
with static balance sheets and a parallel interest rate shock of -100 bp and the scenario k = 2 with
dynamic balance sheets and the parallel interest rate shock of -100bp. The price effect a and the total
effect tot (relative to the benchmark) are shown as arrows with solid lines. The quantity effect b (which
is calculated as the difference from the total effect and the price effect) is depicted as a dotted line.

bank i's total assets TAk

at the point in time that the prognosis was established (i.e.
with h = 0 and k = 0).6 Note that the assumption of a static balance sheet may itself
induce a price effect. One can think of an interest rate shock which makes the customers
put more money in some bank product. To keep the balance sheet weights constant, the
bank has to make this bank product less attractive by lowering the bank rate for this
product. In the following, we neglect this kind of price effect.

(14) suggests ­ a and b.
Correspondingly, Equations (12) to (14) can be defined for the interest income margin
(p = IIM) and for the interest expense margin (p = IEM). To sum up, we look at three
dimensions: first, the P&L components (p = NIM, IIM, IEM); second, the different
effects (total effect tot, price effect a, quantity effect b) and, third, the time dimension
(base year h = 0 and prognosis h = 1, 2, .., 5).
In the following, we assess the contribution of banks' simulated price and quantity
effects, respectively, to the total effect by their respective shares of the total variation.
To some extent, one can think of these shares as R2s (coefficients of determinations) of
regressions of the simulated total effect on the simulated price effect and quantity effect,
respectively.

5 Empirical Results
5.1 Descriptive Analysis
In this subsection, we present a descriptive analysis of the impact of a -100 basis points
drop in the yield curve on the banks' net interest margin and the respective income and
expense margins.
In Figures 4-6, the mean of the difference from the benchmark scenario is shown on
the left hand side. As said above, the scenarios are designed such that a decomposition of
the simulated total effect (tot) in the simulated price effect (a) and the simulated quantity
effect due to balance sheet adjustments (b) is possible. All the effects are normalized by
the total assets as of 31 December 2014.
We expect the price effect for interest income and interest expenses to be negative
since falling interest rates are passed through to bank interest rates. For Banks that are
engaged in term transformation the interest rate pass-through should be faster for interest
expenses. In this case, the price effect for the net interest rate margin will be positive
in the first months after the interest rate shock. However, the sign of the price effect
on the net interest margin is expected to change after certain time because the long-run
pass-through on the asset-side is usually larger than on the liability-side.
It seems very likely that the quantity effect is positive in all cases, since rationality
requires that a bank steers its investment and funding in an advantageous way. However,
in practice banks are not able to fully steer their investment and funding sources. For
example, the amount of overnight deposits is mostly determined by the clients and, to
some extent, beyond the banks' control.
The total effect (tot) on the net interest margin (NIM) is positive for the first year,
11
whereas the price effect (a) is on average negative from the first year on. Busch and
Memmel (2015), using aggregate data for German banks for the period 1968-2013, find
that this critical horizon is about 1.5 years, which is in line with the simulated total effect
tot, which corresponds to the actual observed accounting data.
Also, in general, the simulated effect b due to balance sheet adjustments works on
average in favor of the banks. This, however, is not the case for the interest expense
margin (IEM), where the mean value of the simulated quantity effect due to balance
sheet adjustments (b) is in fact slightly negative.
In 2019, the simulated price effect (a) of the 100 bp decrease in the yield curve on
the interest income margin (IIM) is on average -49.1 bp. By contrast, banks' simulated
total effect (tot) is on average -40.9 bp, meaning that the simulated quantity effect due
to balance sheet adjustments (b) is sizable (8.2 bp on average). This serves as a good
example of the asymmetry mentioned above: Whereas the total effect is -40.9 bp (= -49.1
bp + 8.2 bp) in the case of a downward shift in the term structure, it will presumably
be 57.3 bp (= 49.1 bp + 8.2 bp) in case of a corresponding upward shift in the term
structure.

structure

The Figures 4-6 show on the right-hand side the variances of the net interest margin,
interest income margin and interest expense margin for the five year time horizon as

difference from the benchmark. The corresponding tables next to the variances (figures
with square roots), also give the the cross-sectional standard deviation (figures without
square roots). Both can also be used to compare the importance of the price effect relative
to the quantity effect.
Note that ­ in contrast to the mean ­ the standard deviation of the simulated total
effect (tot) is not the sum of the standard deviations of the simulated price (a) and
quantity effects (b). We present the standard deviation because its magnitude can be
more easily assessed than that of the variance. The standard deviation increases with
the forecast horizon. This holds true for all P&L components (NIM, IIM and IEM)
and all effects (tot, a and b). Moreover, we also present the variances because we think
that the variance comparison is more meaningful since it corresponds to the ratio of the
coefficients of determination. In principle, this comparison could also be done by looking
at the respective means. In good approximation, it is possible to sum up the variances
because the covariance between the price effect and the quantity effect is rather small.7
The increase in the standard deviation is far more pronounced for the simulated quan-
tity effect (b) than it is for the two other effects (tot and a). For instance, in 2015, the
simulated price effect (a) on the net interest margin (NIM), measured by the variances,
is nearly eight times as large as the effect due to the balance sheet adjustment (b) (11.72
vs. 4.22).8 This finding is line with Memmel and Schertler (2013) who find that ­ on a
yearly horizon ­ the coefficient of determination for the price effect is more than three
times that of the one for the quantity effect. In 2019, however, this ratio of the simulated
price effect (a) to the simulated quantity effect (b) is barely above two (21.42 vs. 14.22).
This indicates that in the short term primarily the simulated price effect is important and
in the medium-term (and presumably in the long-run) both effects are important.
Table 2 reports the share of improvements relative to the benchmark. For instance,
7Using the identity as laid down in Equation (14), one obtains var(tot) = var(a)+var(b)+2cov(a, b).
The covariances are considerably small, so they are assumed to be zero. For instance, when the return
of a stock is split up into the market component and an idiosyncratic component, the cross sectional
mean of the idiosyncratic components should be close to zero. Moreover, no one would say that the
idiosyncratic component of the shocks is (close to) zero. By contrast, looking at the second moments
(standard deviation or variance), one obtains a meaningful comparison of the relative importance of the
market and idiosyncratic components.
8In terms of standard deviations, the effect is more than twice as strong.

This table shows the share (in per cent) of improvements relative to the benchmark (Scenario k=0). Two
scenarios are compared: the scenario of a downward shift in the yield curve and the benchmark scenario
with constant yield curve. The difference of three income components are analysed, namely NIM,IIM
and IEM which denote the net interest margin, the interest income margin and the interest expense
margin, where the respective income components are divided by the total assets as of end 2014 (and not
as of the respective year). The effects a and b denote the impact due to the price and the quantity effects
(as defined in the Equations (12) and (13)), respectively; tot means the total effect, the sum of a and b
(as defined in Equation (14)). *** , ** and * denote significance at 1%, 5% and 10% level, respectively,
concerning the hypothesis that the true share is 50%.
in 2015, in 51.9% of the cases, the NIM is higher in the downward shift scenario than
in the benchmark scenario of a constant term structure. Special attention should be paid
to the simulated quantity effect b, the difference in the outcomes between the assumption
of dynamic balance adjustment and constant balance sheets. If we assume that banks
optimize their balance sheets, there must be an improvement ­ or at least no deterioration
­ in all cases, i.e. we expect 100 per cent in the respective columns. This is not the case,
however. Even on the asset side, only round 85% of all cases lead to an improvement; in
more than 10% of the cases, the balance sheet adjustment leads to a deterioration in the
interest income margin (IIM). In case of the interest expense margin (IEM), the share is
just above 50 per cent, meaning that the balance sheet adjustments lead to a deterioration
nearly as often as to an improvement. It seems as though banks cannot solely optimize
their balance sheet structure; instead, they are subject to exogenous factors as well. Such
exogenous factors may be customers who want to deposit their money at banks that are
reluctant or not allowed to turn their deposit rates negative.
14
5.2 Size Effects
In this section we analyse how the price, quantity, and total effects of the interest rate
margin are affected by bank size. We compare these effects for the 25% smallest and 25%
largest banks (measured by total assets). In general, we observe a similar pattern for both
size groups regarding the development of the price effect, quantity effect and the total
effect, but with different absolute levels (Figure 7). While the total effect for the group
of small banks is positive in the first two years, the total effect of large banks is negative.
Also regarding the price effect we observe more favourable values for small banks. For
small banks the price effect is positive in the first year. We expect such an effect for
banks that are engaged in term transformation. In contrast, the average quantity effect is
higher for larger banks. In order to quantify the effects, we run a regression analysis for
a sample of banks covering the 25% smallest and the 25% largest banks. We regress each
effect (the price effect, the quantity effect and the total effect) on a size dummy (D75),
which takes the value 1 for banks belonging to the 25% largest banks. Furthermore, we
include year dummies and interact the time dummies with the size dummy.
The results shown in Table 3 confirm that large banks are more strongly hit by the price
effect. Nevertheless, we also see that large banks are better able to adjust their balance
sheets. Furthermore, the time trend is negative for the price effect and the total effect.
It is positive for the quantity effect. However, the interaction dummies do not indicate
differences between size groups becoming smaller through time. An explanation for the
differences in the levels of the size groups with less competition for small banks and more
flexible business models of large banks is that smaller banks usually operate in rather
rural areas while larger banks are located in urban areas which are more competitive.
Therefore, we expect smaller banks to react less competitively to market rate changes
resulting in smaller changes in interest margins after an interest rate shock. However,
large banks usually offer a broader product portfolio which enables them to adjust their
balance sheet composition more easily compared to small banks. In total, the price effect
dominates the quantity effect leading to a less favourable development of the total effect
for large banks. The results qualitatively remain the same if we include the remaining
banks in the sample and let the size dummy taking the value 1 for the 50% largest banks.
Only for the regression of the quantity effect is the size dummy not statistically significant.
5.3 Balance sheet composition
In our empirical analysis, we regress ap
h,i
, bp
h,i
and totp
h,i
with p = NIM, IIM, IEM on the
bank i's balance sheet composition in h = 0, i.e. on the weights w0
0,i,j
, thereby obtaining
45 (= 3 effects x 3 P&L-components x 5 years) R2 (coefficients of determination). These
R2 are reported in Table 4. In Section 3, the stylized empirical model showed that the
coefficients of determination R2
a,h
and R2
b,h
should fall for the price effect a (Proposition
1) and increase for the quantity effect b (Proposition 2), with respect to the horizon h.
In fact, we find that the simulated price effect (variable a) shows a relationship to the
balance sheet weights of the base year (as of 31 December 2014) which becomes weaker
as the forecast horizon h increases. This more or less holds true for all P&L components.
What is more, we find the opposite result for the simulated quantity effect (variable b).
The explanatory power of the balance sheet weights (of the year 2014) tends to become
stronger with the length of the forecast horizon h. For instance, whereas the 2014 balance

sheet weights explain only 2.8% of the simulated quantity effect on the interest income
margin in 2015, the explanatory power increases and reaches 3.2% in 2019.
We compare the R2 among each other to see whether there is a statistically significant
dynamic as predicted by the model above. In Table 5, we show that, in the case of
the simulated price effect a, the coefficients of determination in the first year of the
forecast horizon are in some cases significantly smaller than at future points in time,
which holds true for all three parts of the P&L (See Appendix 2 for a derivation of the
test statistics). In the case of banks' simulated quantity effect b, we find significance
only for the IIM compared to the year 2016; for NIM, the signs of the test statistics
correspond to the theoretical prediction, but they are not significant. The total effect,
which is, by definition, the sum of the direct and indirect effects (tot = a+b), often shows
a u-form development. According to the model in Section 3, the economic intuition is as
follows: At first, the explanatory power of today's balance sheet weights is falling because
the extents of the pass-through of the single bank products are becoming more similar.
Then, this explanatory power is increasing again because the second effect, the adjusting
of the balance sheet weights, is getting stronger.
5.4 Robustness checks
First, as stated above, our data cleaning considerably reduces our sample size. To take
this into account, we apply a less rigorous data cleaning for the robustness check. Hence,

shift in the yield curve and the benchmark scenario with constant term structure. The difference of three
income components are analysed, namely NIM,IIM and IEM which denote the net interest margin,
the interest income margin and the interest expense margin, where the respective P&L components are
divided by the total assets as of end 2014 (and not as of the respective year). The effects a and b denote
the impact due to the price and the quantities (as defined in the Equations (12) and (13)), respectively;
tot means the total effect, the sum of a and b (as defined in Equation (14)).

a, b and tot on the balance sheet weights of the year 2014. Two scenarios are compared: the scenario
of a downward shift in the yield curve and the benchmark scenario with a constant yield curve. The
difference of three income components are analysed, namely NIM,IIM and IEM which denote the net
interest margin, the interest income margin and the interest expense margin, where the respective income

we retain observations no matter whether the balance sheet development is the same in
different scenarios that allow for balance sheet adjustments.9 This way of data cleaning
yields a data set of about 1,200 banks. Overall, the results remain qualitatively the same.
However, several points have to be highlighted. First, the total effect of the interest rate
shock on the net interest margin is on average positive for the first two years, not only
on the first year as in the restricted sample (see Subsection 5.1). Second, the standard
deviation of banks' simulated quantity effect for the NIM is larger than that of banks'
simulated price effect in 2019 (and not the other way around as in the restricted sample).
Third, when using the extended data set, the significances for the comparisons of the R2
(see Subsection 5.3), become stronger.
Second, we check whether the calculations are robust to changes in the definitions of
asset and liability components. First, we take together assets and liabilities of the same
maturities. Here, we observe a lower absolute level of the R2, but the same pattern of the
coefficient of determination.
Third, we differentiate regarding the type of customer and loan type. Here, we classify
balance sheet positions into positions originated by business relationships with corporate
customers, private persons, banks, government, non-profit organizations and foreign cus-
tomers. Applying this specification also indicates a rising coefficient of determination
regarding banks' simulated quantity effect, while the explanatory power in the specifica-
tions for banks' simulated price effect declines over time.
Fourthly. we analyse the effects of balance sheet alignments separately for expansions
and reductions. It turns out that the average effects on the P&L components NIM and
IIM are negative in the event that banks expect balance sheet expansions, whereas in the
case of balance sheet reductions the average effects are positive. These results demonstrate
that expectations concerning balance sheet growth are a major determinant.
6 Conclusion
Using unique supervisory survey data of German small and medium-size banks we are able
to shed light on the question if a static balance sheet assumption seems to be justified
in stress testing exercises. For understandable reasons, eg comparability of results, stress
tests with a horizon of even several years are often carried out under the assumption of
static balance sheets. In its pure nature, such a setting does not allow for changes in the
composition and size of the balance sheet. Our results suggests that over a horizon of
several years banks' simulated quantity effects due to balance sheet adjustments may have
noticeable effects. Our results show that in the first year the variance of banks' simulated
price effect ­ derived from a scenario with static balance sheets ­ is nearly eight times as
large as the simulated quantity effect ­ derived from the same scenario but with dynamic
balance sheets. After five years, however, the importance of both effects converges as
banks' simulated price effect is just about twice as large as the simulated quantity effect.
We come to the conclusion that in interest rate stress tests with a short forecast horizon
a static balance sheet assumption might be justified, but not for the medium term. In
general, the current trend to create stress test exercises with constrained dynamic balance
9This procedure can be justified by the argument that the balance sheet structure planning is not
significantly different.

sheets is consistent with our conclusion.
Furthermore,our results show that balance sheet adjustments are not always in favor
of banks. This might be explained by the fact that banks are subject to exogenous
factors, such as the behavior of depositors. The planning of the balance sheet structure
seems to account for these considerable effects. We also find that the current balance
sheet composition can to some extent answer the question of how banks are affected
by a macroeconomic shock. Our results indicate that the simulated quantity effects are
explained better by a bank's current balance sheet composition, the longer the forecast
horizon. This is likely mirroring the only partial adjustment to the new equilibrium of
portfolio composition. The opposite holds for banks' price effect.
A Appendix
A.1 Appendix 1: Deviation of the process of wh
We assume that a bank minimizes its losses which stem from deviations of the weight wh
from the optimal weight Ż
w and from deviations from the past weight wh-1
(adjustment
costs):10
Loss = ľ1
( Ż
w - wh
)2 + ľ2
(wh
- wh-1
)2 (16)
When optimizing with respect to the weight wh
, we obtain:
Loss
wh
= -2ľ1
( Ż
w - wh
) + 2ľ2
(wh
- wh-1
) (17)
Setting Equation (17) to zero, the following condition arises, which is an autoregressive
process of order 1:11
wh

A.2 Appendix 2: Comparision of R2s
In this appendix, we derive the test statistics for a comparison of two coefficients of deter-
mination, where we define, for the regression yi
= xi
+i
, the coefficient of determination
as
R2 = 1 -
2

y
(19)
10See Baltagi (2008), p. 137.
11Note that we take the weight wh-1
as given. If we abstained from this assumption, the expressions
would be more complicated (the resulting autoregressive process would be of order 2), but the qualitative
statements would remain.

where we use the corresponding expressions in Equations (21) and (22). Under the
null hypothesis of equal R2, the test statistics ts is asymptotically standard normally
distributed.
The covariance-matrix  is estimated as follows, where, for reasons of brevity, we
restrict the illustration to two variables (although the matrix  is of dimension 4 × 4):
Let yi
and i
with i = 1, ..., N be (across the N banks) independent and identically
distributed (iid) random variables with expectation ľy
and zero, respectively.12 We define
Zi
= (Z1,i
, Z2,i
) , Z1,i
= (yi
- ľy
)2 and Z2,i
= 2
i
.13 By the central limit theorem, we
obtain for the arithmetic average Ż
Z = 1
N

12Note that in case there is some positive cross-sectional correlation, for instance due to common shocks,
then the test statistics will too often signal significant results.
13Note that ľy
is estimated as the arithmetic average.
