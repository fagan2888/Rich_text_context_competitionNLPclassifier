Abstract
The goal of this paper is to estimate peer influence in video gaming time among adoles-
cents. Using a nationally representative sample of the U.S. school-aged adolescents in
2009­2010, we estimate a structural model that accounts for the potential biases in the esti-
mate of the peer effect. Our peer group is exogenously assigned and includes one year
older adolescents in the same school grade as the respondent. The peer measure is based
on peers' own reports of video gaming time. We find that an additional one hour of playing
video games per week by older grade-mates results in .47 hours increase in video gaming
time by male responders. We do not find significant peer effect among female responders.
Effective policies aimed at influencing the time that adolescents spend video gaming should
take these findings into account.
Introduction
Global sales and popularity of video games have been rising steadily in the recent decade and
are expected to continue their growth in the foreseeable future [1]. Players under the age of 18
account for about one-quarter of the audience of this growing industry and as the games
become increasingly realistic, there has been growing concern among parents, the media and
the research community about important social and behavioral effects of video gaming on ado-
lescents [2,3].
The existing literature suggests significant social, behavioral and clinical effects of video
gaming. Some of the literature has linked violent video games to aggressive and antisocial
behaviors among children and adolescents. Early literature suggests that excessive arcade video
gaming may develop into a behavior which resembles a gambling addiction [4]. It was found
that children who play more video games are more likely to behave violently and get into argu-
ments [5]. This relationship was confirmed in another study of 8th and 9th graders in the U.S.
Midwestern schools [6] and later in meta-analysis [5] found this relationship to exist in differ-
ent cultures. Another study [7] found the opposite to be true for pro-social video games. Some
studies investigated the link to school performance and attention and found a negative effect of
video games on school performance [6,8] and college engagement [9]. However another study
[10] found that video gaming had no significant relationship to poor academic performance

after controlling for other risk factors. It was found that video gaming among girls was associ-
ated with higher odds of getting into a serious fight and carrying a weapon to school [3].
Among other studies, [11] found a link between video gaming and sleep disorders and hyperac-
tivity, [12] found a link to attention deficits and [13] using longitudinal data found some evi-
dence of relationship between gaming at age 8 or 9 and behavioral and psychological problems
measured at age 15. Yet, in a recent experiment on adults with and without autism [14], there
was found no effect of violent-video-game exposure on aggressive behavior in either group.
Moreover, in a recent meta-analysis, It was concluded [15] that video games have little influ-
ence on several children's and adolescents' behaviors, including aggression, mental health, pro-
social behavior, and academic performance. Also, it was noted that women are often
misrepresented in video games [16], however there was no relationship found between video
game use and sexist attitudes towards women using a 3 year longitudinal study of adolescent
students in Germany [16]. Other literature has documented several positive effects of video
gaming. It was found that video gaming was associated with lower odds of smoking in boys
and lower odds of reporting depression in girls [3]; and gaming was not found to be associated
with alcohol, drug or caffeine consumption or body-mass index [3]. In a longitudinal study of
students in Canada over 4 years [17], it was found that playing sports video games is associated
with participating in active sports more. In addition, experienced gamers have been found to
have superior visual, spatial and attention skills [18,19,20]. Consistent with this strand of litera-
ture, a recent study using functional MRI scanning of the participant gamers [21], found that
violent video games result in aggression desensitization and improvements in spatial attention.
Moreover, several successful health interventions among children and adolescents used video-
game format [22]. The link between video gaming and these important outcomes warrants
examination of the factors that might change video gaming behavior of adolescents.
In this paper, we focus on estimating peer effects in the time spent video gaming by adoles-
cents in the U.S. The literature hypothesized that the social network and peer influence play an
important role in video gaming behavior of adolescents. Support to this hypothesis is lent by
survey data, which indicated that video gaming often happens in group setting--with friends
or family members [23,24]. If peer effects in video gaming activities exist, such peer effects
"may serve to amplify the effects of interventions" targeted at changing behavior of individual
gamers [25].
Most of the previous research on peer influence has looked at screen time in general, which
included television watching, video gaming and internet usage [26,27,28]. Fletcher [26] used
nationally-representative survey of U.S. adolescents in grades 7 through 12 in 1996 and found
that an increase in average school-level television viewing by one hour was associated with an
almost half an hour increase in television viewing by an adolescent. Liu et al. [27] investigated
involvement in screen activities by U.S. adolescents in grades 7­12 in 1994 using an aggregate
of hours a week that students watched television, videos or played video or computer games
but did not find a significant peer effect of nominated friends on an adolescent. Sirard et al.
[28] used a cross sectional study (n = 2126) in 20 middle schools and high schools in Minneap-
olis/St. Paul MN during the 2009­2010 academic year and found that every additional hour of
a best female friend's screen time (watching TV/DVDs/videos, using a computer not for home-
work, and Xbox/Play-Station/other electronic games played when sitting) was associated with
an additional 15 minutes of screen time per week for high school boys. While general screen
time includes video gaming, a large proportion of it is comprised of television viewing. An
important difference between television viewing and video gaming is the level of involvement
and the type of activity: Unlike television watching, video games provide a place for social
interaction both online and face-to-face, and the content of video games can be modified by
interaction of player with the game and with other players. Only one recent study [29] focused

on video gaming and found a statistically significant peer effect in console use time in a repre-
sentative survey of secondary school students aged 14­16 in Catalonia (Spain) in 2008, with an
additional hour increase in console gaming by nominated friends within the classroom leading
to an increase in individual's gaming by 5 minutes among boys but no effect among girls.
The existing research into peer effects in media consumption (including video gaming) has
several flaws and shortcomings, which we attempt to address in this study. Most importantly,
most studies used outdated data, convenience samples or failed to address statistical issues sur-
rounding the estimation of peer effects. For example, samples from 1996 and 1995 were used
to look at television viewing and general screen activities [26,27]. However, the development of
128-bit gaming systems (also known as 6th generation systems, including Sony PlayStation 2,
Nintendo GameCube, and Microsoft Xbox) in 1998 allowed for development of much more
realistic video games, which could change the nature of the experience. Furthermore, this new
technology could have potentially changed the type of audience playing these games and the
nature of social interactions, as these devices saw a significant rise in the popularity of large-
scale online gaming, namely with the introduction of Microsoft's Xbox Live and Sony's PlayS-
tation Network online gaming platforms in 2002 and 2006 respectively. Today, these platforms
provide a unified gaming experience and cater to millions of console, PC and even smartphone
gamers. It seems likely that such platforms make online gaming much more accessible and
appealing to a wide audience, while previously online gaming was more restricted to tech-
savvy PC gamers. These innovations coincided with the rapid increase in popularity of video
gaming since late 1990's; only four out of the ten best-selling video game consoles in history
were made before the year 2000 (http://www.statista.com/statistics/268966/total-number-of-
game-consoles-sold-worldwide-by-console-type/ accessed on June 16, 2014). Even today,
video gaming constantly evolves into a more realistic and immersive experience, yet most stud-
ies on media consumption were conducted using data that preceded this expansion. Another
important aspect of modern video games and consoles is that many of them can be played on-
line with friends and even strangers and do not require physical presence of the participants­
which is in contrast to the previous generations in arcades that were mainly played only in
social spheres or together in the sofa.
While some of the existing studies rely on more recent data, the data used were quite limited
in coverage: Sirard et al. [28], who studied peer effects in general screen time, only used data
collected in the state of Minnesota; Escardíbul et al. [29], who studied peer effects in video gam-
ing time, used only data from Catalonia, an autonomous community of Spain. The results
from these limited samples might not directly apply to other populations in light of a signifi-
cant variability across human populations in terms of psychology, motivation, and behavior
[30].
There are also methodological issues that arise when estimating behavioral peer effects. As
noted by Manski [31], the identification of (endogenous) peer effects is difficult because of the
"reflection problem"--the fact that individuals tend to select their peers, may face similar envi-
ronment or select each other based on common traits or interests (correlated effects), or may
be influenced by peers' background characteristics (contextual effects). If these are the main
driving forces behind the correlation in peers' behavior, a policy aimed at changing video gam-
ing habits will not have a ripple effect among individuals who were not directly affected by the
policy. The previous analysis of peer effects [29] may suffer from the selection concerns; while
they utilized the relevant peer group of nominated friends in the same classroom, estimates
based on the peer group of nominated friends within the same classroom are likely suffer from
peer selection [31] that might not be properly controlled for by the included observable covari-
ates at the individual and classroom levels. Escardíbul et al. [29] tried to address the reflection
problem by using a convincing identification strategy--by utilizing characteristics of the

respondents' friends-of-friends who are not friends with the respondent--as instruments for
peers' video gaming. However, the intransitivity property of the peer network, which requires
that some of the students are not directly related as friends but only via others, is unlikely to
hold if some students under-report their friendships.
Our updated analysis relies on a recent nationally representative sample of the U.S. school-
aged adolescents in 2009­2010 school year. Our empirical methods account for the problems
of contextual effects, correlated effects, and peer selection and thereby reduce the potential
biases from the estimates of peer effects. Our peer group is comprised of non-nominated
peers­older adolescents in the same grade in the school--who are unlikely to be selected by the
individual yet are likely to exert significant influence on video gaming behavior of an adoles-
cent. We also use instrumental variable strategy where we use measures of peer's parental con-
trol and relationship as instruments. Our analysis also accounts for a number of individual and
family-level covariates, which were identified in the literature as important determinants of
video gaming behavior and the omission of which may bias the estimates of the peer effects.
For example, video gaming has been found to vary by gender, race and ethnicity, body weight,
urban status, grade level in school, school performance, and socio-economic status of the
household [32,33,34,28,26,35]. Finally, given the evidence that video gaming is much more
prevalent among males [36,37,38,39,40] and that peer effect in console use varies by gender
[29], we explore whether the peer effect in video gaming time differs by gender. Thus, we pro-
pose the following two hypotheses:
1. There is a significant peer effect in adolescents' video gaming time.
2. Peer effect in video gaming time is stronger among males compared to females.
Data
We utilize data from Health Behavior in School-Aged Children (HBSC), which is a school-
based study of health-related attitudes and behaviors based on a series of cross-sectional
national surveys of school-aged children. We use HBSC 2009­2010 data for the U.S. [41],
which contain information from the 2009­2010 school year on 12,642 students from 314 pub-
lic, Catholic, and other private schools and who were enrolled in grades 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 or
their equivalent in the 50 states and the District of Columbia. In most schools in the U.S., edu-
cation is divided into three levels: elementary school (kindergarten to 5th grade and ages 5­10),
middle or junior high school (grades 6th to 8th and ages 11­13), and high school (grades 9th to
12th and ages 14­18). In addition, education is mandatory starting between the ages of five and
eight and ending between ages sixteen and eighteen, depending on the state ("US School Sys-
tem." http://www.fulbright.org.uk/, accessed on 06.04.2016). HBSC 2009­2010 data are main-
tained and distributed to the general public free of charge (upon registration and agreement
with the terms of use) by the Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research.
(Access and data download page for HBSC 2009­2010 is http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/
icpsrweb/ICPSR/studies/34792#accessNotes, accessed on 06.08.2016). The objectives of HBSC
are to monitor health-risk behaviors of adolescents in order to identify targets for health pro-
motion initiatives and to help explain the development of health attitudes and behaviors
through early adolescence. HBSC contains extensive information on substance use (e.g.,
tobacco, alcohol, and marijuana) and various health behaviors and attitudes (including video
gaming, eating habits, physical activity, body image, health problems) in addition to demo-
graphic and socio-economic conditions of the student's family. (Detailed description of HBSC
2009­2010 can be found at http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/ICPSR/studies/34792,
accessed on 06.08.2016). Students were also asked about their relationship with their parents

and the level of parental control over their activities. These questions are used for creating
instrumental variables (IV), which are used to help identify the peer effects. Because HBSC sur-
veyed multiple students in the same school and grade, we were able to create same-grade peer
group measure of video gaming.
Measure of Adolescent Video Gaming
The dependent variable of our analysis is a continuous variable measuring the number of
hours a day that student spent video gaming and is based on the survey questions "About how
many hours a day do you usually play games on a computer or games console (Playstation,
Xbox, GameCube, etc.) in your free time on weekdays/weekends?" The reported number of
hours played on weekdays multiplied by 5 was added to the number of hours played on week-
ends multiplied by 2 and the sum was divided by 7 to create a weighted average number of
hours spent video gaming by the adolescent during a typical week.
Peer Measure of Video Gaming
Our peer measure of video gaming is based on co-location and is the average number of hours
spent video gaming among students who are one year older than the respondent and belong to
the same grade level in the same school as the responder.
Previous studies of peer effects often used nominated peers [28,29] to define peer groups.
These groups usually include close friends that were nominated by the student. This appears to
be a reasonable approach to defining the relevant peer group, as students are likely to be
engaged in discussions about gaming with their friends; they may also participate in gaming
together. However, there are several methodological difficulties when trying to identify peer
effects among nominated friends. Friends, who are frequently selected by the individual, are
likely to share similar background, interests and personalities. Thus, it is difficult to separate
the correlated effects from the endogenous peer effect. This is less of a problem when using
grade-level peers. While the degree of peer influence of grade-level peers is likely less than that
of close friends, classmates and same-grade individuals were previously found to have a signifi-
cant influence on various behaviors of adolescents [42,43,26,44]. Students often communicate
and are exposed to gaming by other students in the same grade, and using grade-level peers
will allow us to capture the gaming culture and social norms pertaining to gaming within a
grade level.
An advantage of using grade-level peers is that they are assigned exogenously (based on age)
and independently of other individual's characteristics that might be correlated with his/her
video-gaming behavior. As a result, the estimated peer effects are less likely to capture corre-
lated effects. In addition, because our grade-level peer measures are based on peers' own
reports, they do not to suffer from the reporting bias from using respondents' own reports of
peers' activities [45,46]. Friendship nominations, on the other hand, are likely to suffer from
recall bias when respondents are presented with a long roster [47]. Using older grade-mates as
a peer group also means that individual's own outcome is not present in the peer group mea-
sure (peer group average). This allows to avoid the downward bias in the peer effect estimate,
which usually results from the mechanical negative correlation between the individual's and
the peer group's outcome after systematically removing individual's own outcome from the
peer group's outcome. This is sometimes referred to as "regression to the mean" in the peer
effects literature [48]. If a students' hours video gaming are subtracted from calculating grade
average hours, the grade average hours will be negatively correlated with individual students'
hours: For a student whose hours exceed grade average, grade average is below the student's
hours, and vice versa.

Family and Personal Characteristics
Our multivariate analysis includes several important individual- and family-level determinants
of video gaming among adolescents. Individual characteristics include sex, race (white, black,
other race), Hispanic ethnicity, whether student is U.S. born, student's body mass index (BMI),
whether student has ever smoked, whether student is a current drinker, whether student used
drugs in the past year and whether student resides in an urban area. Other individual charac-
teristics include a categorical measure of student-reported teacher's evaluation of student's per-
formance on school tests (1­4, 1 for `Below average,' 2 for `Average,' 3 for `Good,' and 4 for
`Very good') and a categorical measure of student's feeling about school (1­4, 1 for `I don't like
it at all,' 2 for `I don't like it very much,' 3 for `I like it a bit,' and 4 for `I like it a lot'). We also
use indicators for student's school and grade level (grade 5 through grade 10 with grade 5 being
an omitted category). Family-level variables include indicators of whether the student's father
and mother have a job, whether he or she has siblings, whether mother and father are at home,
whether there is a second home, number of computers at home, and a categorical affluence
scale measuring how wealthy the family is (1­9, 1 for `Low', 9 for `High').
We also use measures of parental control and relationship with the parent. Parental control
and monitoring of adolescent's activities appears to be an important determinant of adolescent's
media use [49], while lack of significant relationship with parent or lack of mutual attachment
are important predictors of early onset of many risky behaviors [50,51,52]. The measures used in
our analysis are based on six relevant questions answered by the student on a scale 1­3 (1 for
`almost always,' 2 for `sometimes,' and 3 for `never'): "Whether parent (or guardian) tries to con-
trol everything I do"; "Whether parent (or guardian) understands my problems"; "Whether par-
ent (or guardian) helps me as much as I need"; "Whether parent (or guardian) lets me make my
own decisions"; "Whether parent (or guardian) is loving"; and "Whether parent (or guardian)
treats me like a baby". The response `almost always' to each question was coded as one in order
to create the corresponding binary indicator variables: "Parent tries to control everything I do" (0
or 1), "Parent understands my problems" (0 or 1), "Parent helps me as much as I need" (0 or 1),
"Parent lets me make own decisions" (0 or 1), "Parent is loving" (0 or 1) and "Parent treats me
like a baby" (0 or 1). These indicators of parental control and relationship also formed the basis
of our instrumental variable identification strategy for estimating peer effects.
The full sample used in the analysis contains 11,888 observations with non-missing values
on all variables. In order to reduce measurement error in the estimates of peer group averages,
we only used peer group averages that were based on at least two observations. As a result, we
have 7,978 non-missing observations for the peer measure. Table 1 reports descriptive statistics
for the variables used in our analysis.
Estimation Strategy
Manski [31] described empirical problems that arise when trying to estimate peer effects using
observational data by collectively referring to them as the "reflection problem." Specifically, the
coefficient on the average peer outcome in a standard linear regression may have several inter-
pretations, which may not necessarily reflect behavioral response of an individual to social
influence of his or her peers. Manski [31] pointed out three different interpretations for the
coefficient on the average peer outcome:
a. Endogenous effect­individual's behavioral response to changes in the behavior of others in
his or her peer group. This effect is present if video gaming among peers creates a social
norm and social acceptance of gaming and thus leads individual to increase his or her time
playing video games. Here, the behavior of peers leads to a change in behavior of an

individual, whose behavior, in turn, becomes part of peer group's behavior. The policy sig-
nificance of the existence of such a behavioral effect is that targeting some individuals in a
group would affect the behavior of other individuals in the group.
b. Exogenous (contextual) effect­effect of exogenous (background) characteristics of the peers
on individual's behavior. For example, if most peers come from households with permissive
parenting style which allowed peers to spend long hours gaming, individual's own gaming
could also be high as a result. While exogenous effect is also a type of social influence, target-
ing the behavior of peers will not lead to the same effect as in the case of endogenous effect
and the behavior of others in the peer group will not change.
c. Correlated effect­describes similarities in behavior of individuals who share the same environ-
ment (e.g., geographical, institutional). For example, students in urban schools could all have
greater attachment to electronic gadgets compared to students from rural schools. Correlated
effect also describes similarities in behavior of individuals who sort themselves into groups
based on personal traits. For example, students who have preference for sedentary activities
may be more likely to become friends. Again, if one of these students starts spending less time
video gaming as a result of an intervention, this change in behavior is not going to spill over to
his friends because something else is driving the correlated effects in the first place.
Given these alternative interpretations of a significant peer effect, standard linear regression
is unable to distinguish between the endogenous, the exogenous and the correlated effects and
a successful policy aimed at changing gaming behaviors will depend upon the mechanism driv-
ing peer effect in each particular case. If the purpose is devising an effective policy that would
exploit behavioral influences among the peers, the econometric strategy needs to control for all
other influences in order to identify the endogenous peer effect [53]. Our empirical strategy
deals with the reflection problem by relying on the instrumental variable approach, school
fixed effects and by using exogenously assigned peer group.
Because approximately 18 percent of the students in our sample (1,449 observations) do not
spend any time playing video games, the dependent variable (hours spent video gaming by a
student) is left-censored at zero. In order to account for the censoring, we employ the Tobit
regression model, which models the outcomes of the latent variable yÃ related to the observed
values of variable y as follows:

tion via sorting into same grade and school) in the estimate of the peer effect. The endogenous
peer effect, , captures peer effect on a student's time spent video gaming. If  is estimated to be
positive, then policy intervention that alters video gaming behavior of an individual would
have an indirect effect on video gaming of other students in the same peer group [31].
If individual's behavior is a linear function of peer group average as in Eq 1, the parameter 
is not identified because group behavior is by definition the aggregation of individual behavior
[31]. Therefore, in order to identify the direct effect of peers' behavior on the adolescent's
behavior, we utilize instrumental variable strategy. Instrumental variable approach is com-
monly used to identify peer effects in various health-related behaviors of adolescents
[54,55,25,56]. We obtain IV estimates of the model in Eq 1 using a two-step method [57,58],
where an endogeneity-correction term given by the least-squares residual from the first-stage
model is added to the censored regression in Eq 1, and then Tobit regression is applied to the
model with the correction term estimated jointly with the first-stage model [59].
The key to implementing the IV technique is having access to instrumental variables which
satisfy two properties. First, instruments must have a strong effect on the endogenous regres-
sor, which in our case is peer measure of video gaming time. Second, instruments must have
no effect on the outcome of interest, individual's gaming time, other than through their effect
on the peer measure. We use six variables that describe peers' relationship with their parents
and the level of parental control over their activities: The percentage of peers whose parent (or
guardian) (i) "tries to control everything they do", (ii)"understands their problems", (iii) "helps
them as much as they need", (iv) "lets them make their own decisions", (v) "is loving"; and (vi)
"treats them like a baby". These peer level variables are expected to directly impact peers'
behavior but should otherwise not predict an individual's behavior. The intuition for the iden-
tification using instruments is that, while individuals whose parents are more permissive or
less involved are likely to spend more time playing video games, the parenting style of peer's
parents will only affect the individual via peers. The use of instrumental variables in combina-
tion with school-level fixed effects, exogenous peer group and important individual-level con-
trols would allow us to obtain more consistent estimates of the peer effects.
Results
We begin by presenting Tobit regression estimates of the peer effects of video gaming time in
Table 2, where the estimates are only adjusted for the effect of individual and family level
covariates (no school fixed effects or IV). The estimates are obtained for everyone, and then
stratified by gender. (All of the Stata code used to create the variables for our analysis and to
produce the estimates in this paper are available from the authors upon request.)
The naïve estimates in Table 2 show that there is a positive and statistically significant asso-
ciation between peers' and individual's video gaming time. Among included covariates, male
students spend significantly more time video gaming compared to females. Students of black

or other race play significantly more compared to students of white race. Higher BMI, urban
residence, and number of computers at home are also associated with significantly higher time
video gaming. On the other hand, better progress at school, positive attitude towards school,
having a father or mother with a job, having a second home, being in the ninth or tenth grade
(relative to the fifth grade) and having a helping parent are negatively associated with the time
spent video gaming. After stratifying the estimates by gender, video gaming time among males
is strongly associated with peers' video gaming time while the association for females is only
marginally statistically significant.

excluded instruments is far greater than 10 in all cases, which indicates that our instruments
are strong. The Amemiya-Lee-Newey overidentifying restrictions test fails to reject the null
hypothesis that all of our instruments are exogenous (i.e. uncorrelated with the error term in
the Tobit regression) in all cases. These results support the validity of our instruments.
After stratifying by gender, peer effect is statistically significant only for males and indicates
that an increase in the average amount of time playing video games among older grade-mates
by an hour leads to .47 hours increase in video gaming by a male student. The peer effect for
females is insignificant. These results are consistent with our second hypothesis and partially
consistent (for males) with our first hypothesis. In addition, we note that the magnitude of the
effect is larger than the corresponding coefficient in Table 2. This indicates that after account-
ing for the reflection problem, peer effect becomes more important. The estimated peer effect
for the entire sample is not significant, which does not lend support to our first hypothesis,
Conclusion
The objective of this paper is to estimate peer effect in video gaming time among adolescents.
We use a nationally representative sample of the U.S. school-aged adolescents surveyed in
2009­2010 to estimate a structural model that accounts for the potential biases in the estimate
of the peer effect. Our results suggest that the amount of time spent video gaming by school
peers significantly affects own time playing video games among male adolescents; an additional
one hour of playing video games per week by peers results in .47 hours increase in video gam-
ing time by male adolescent. We do not find significant peer effect among female adolescents.
Our finding of a significant peer effect in video gaming among males is in line with the ear-
lier research [29], which estimated peer effects in console use among secondary school students
aged 14­16 in Catalonia (Spain) using 2008 data. However, the magnitude of the peer effect
found in Spanish data is much lower than here; Spanish data [29] showed that an additional
hour increase in console use by nominated friends within the classroom leads to an increase in
individual's gaming by only 5 minutes. Our finding of a significant peer effect is also broadly
consistent with the literature finding a significant peer effect in general screen time activities,
which include video gaming among other media consumption [26,28].
While our paper does not examine the reasons why there is a significant peer effect in video
gaming time for males but not females, there are at least two possibilities for this gender differ-
ence. One possibility is that there are simply more opportunities for male gamers to interact
and influence each other's gaming habits compared to female gamers, given that the research
commonly finds that males play video games much more than females [36,37,38,39,40].
Another possibility is that males and females have different motivations to play video games,
with males being more motivated by the opportunity to socialize (and hence influence and
being influenced by peers) compared to females. This idea is supported by the finding that
boys utilize violent or sports games as social tools that allow for socialization through competi-
tion and cooperation [60]. Males also dominate LAN (Local Access Network) gaming events,
where players bring their computers to a designated location to play online and face-to-face;
and the main gratifying property of LAN events is the opportunity to game in each other's
presence [61]. In addition, in a study of Matese men and women [36] found that "males' pref-
erence for first person shooters, roleplaying games, and sport and strategy games indicates grat-
ification of different needs­challenge and social interaction" ([36], p. 36). On the other hand,
women were found to be interested primarily in puzzle, adventure, fighting, and managerial
games, which indicates "females' top reasons for playing include challenge and arousal" ([36],
p. 36). Males have also been found to have a higher score on social interaction compared to
females in explorative survey (N = 760) conducted among players of The Sims2 [62].

As with any empirical strategy, our results may only be viewed as suggesting a strong associ-
ation. Our study points in that direction provided that our assumptions hold. Specifically we
assume that our instrumental variables, which reflect parental control over an adolescent's
video-gaming, are plausibly uncorrelated with the video-gaming time of students who are in
the same grade. In addition, the data that we use and our estimates only suggest the existence
of peer effects in video gaming time, but not the mechanism underlying the process (e.g., obser-
vation of behavior vs. participation in behavior). Another limitation of our study is that it uses
self-reported time spent playing video games. In fact, it has been found that gamers tend to
under-estimate the time they play [63,64]. As long the amount of underreporting of the gaming
time is unrelated to the regression error term, our estimates will be attenuated and will provide
a lower bound on the magnitude of the (positive) peer effects.
Our findings imply that future policies aimed at changing video gaming behavior among
adolescents could potentially benefit from relying on the spread of this behavior among peers,
where even the individuals who did not directly participate or were not included in the pro-
gram could nevertheless be affected by the program. Policies involving only a subset of the tar-
get population would have a spillover effect on other individuals and may be more cost
effective than previously thought.
Given that video gaming is a global phenomenon, future research could focus on cross-coun-
try comparisons to better understand the influence of cultural, ethnic, and other differences on
the magnitudes of peer effects in video gaming. It would also be valuable to learn about the mech-
anisms through which peer effect in video gaming might operate by conducting qualitative analy-
sis of players and by estimating peer effects for different types of games (multiplayer, LAN
games, on-line games). Future studies should also confirm whether the gender difference in the
peer effect found here exists in other datasets and try to ascertain the reasons behind it.
