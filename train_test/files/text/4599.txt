Electronic Health Object: Transforming
Health Care Systems From Static to
Interactive and Extensible

Abstract
Electronic health records (EHRs) store health-related patient information in an electronic format, improving the quality of
health care management and increasing efficiency of health care processes. However, in existing information systems, health-
related records are generated, managed, and controlled by health care organizations. Patients are perceived as recipients
of care and normally cannot directly interact with the system that stores their health-related records; their participation in
enriching this information is not possible. Many businesses now allow customers to participate in generating information for
their systems, strengthening customer relationships. This trend is supported by Web 2.0, which enables interactivity through
various means, including social networks. Health care systems should be able to take advantage of this development. This
article proposes a novel framework in addressing the emerging need for interactivity while preserving and extending existing
electronic medical data. The framework has 3 dimensions of patient health record: personal, social, and medical dimensions.
The framework is designed to empower patients, changing their roles from static recipient of health care services to dynamic
and active partners in health care processes.

Introduction
Health care organization is a service industry that is always
challenged with efficiencies, equities, and provision of quali-
ties in delivering services. In principle, the quality of health
care services should be improved by electronic processing
and the availability of medical data.1 Electronic health
(e-health) was introduced to improve information access and
flow, efficiency, effectiveness, and quality of health care pro-
cesses and service delivery. E-health initiatives are progres-
sively taking place worldwide to support efficient health care
management and business processes, and to fulfill increasing
consumer demand for online services.
E-health cannot be separated from electronic health
records (EHRs) or electronic medical records (EMRs), as
essentially both are core parts of an e-health system. The pri-
mary goal of an EHR is to make medical data available
beyond physical borders. However, many essential EHRs are
still recorded on paper or within isolated databases. Even
modern health care centers with advanced health information
systems limit access to EHRs for authorized users.2
EHRs have evolved to become center-stage in the national
health informatics strategies of most European countries and
internationally.3,4 Health care professionals increasingly
need to access details from health records to manage the safe
and effective delivery of complex and knowledge-intensive
health care, and to share this information within and between
organizations.5 More patients are now demanding access to
their EHR to an extent that permits them to actively partici-
pate in their health care management. This is becoming more
urgent as the focus of health care delivery shifts from spe-
cialist centers to community settings and to the patient's per-
sonal environment.4 Health care has transformed from a
static system, where patients are perceived as recipients of
care to an interactive and dynamic health care system that
recognizes patients as partners in the health care processes.

2 INQUIRY
Recent developments in interactivity on the Web (Web
2.0) mean that consumers are motivated to have better con-
trol of the information flowing within their social networks.
Consumers are able to interactively converse among them-
selves to confirm and even criticize services, products, or the
performance of businesses that they have experienced. Web
2.0 has driven changes in consumer behavior in terms of
interaction and empowerment, enabling consumers (patients)
in health care environments to have conversations and inter-
actions among themselves. These patient-to-patient interac-
tionsareaformofelectronicempowerment(e-empowerment)
whereby they can share, discuss, and even generate records
(content) of their health-related activities and services pro-
vided by their health care providers. Web 2.0 has the poten-
tial to support better partnerships between patients and their
health care providers for mutual benefits.
The present article aims to present a promising research
direction that may shape the future of health care systems.
We review the roles of EMRs and EHRs and propose a new
representation of health or medical data by reorganizing and
extending EMRs with Web 2.0 features. This new represen-
tation, electronic health object (EHO), is designed to improve
the extensibility of health-related data and accommodate
patient interactivity in health care systems using the Web 2.0
concept. EHO uses an object-oriented approach to flexibly
and robustly extend the existing stationary EHR to interac-
tive health records and information. EHO comprises 3 main
objects: personal, which captures activities of individual
daily life that may directly or indirectly affect the individu-
al's overall health status; social, which captures the patient's
social networking activities; and medical, which is the emu-
lation of conventional EMR that may consist of records of
checkups, outpatient treatment (O/P), and inpatient treatment
(I/P). The next section presents the background of the study,
followed by discussion of EHO. We then discuss the applica-
tion of EHO in e-health and its contribution to patient
empowerment. Finally, we present our EHO prototype
(Clinic 2.0).
Related Work
Like many companies, health care providers have several
lines of business. These include medical examination, treat-
ment, prescription, marketing and health promotion, and
pharmacies. Each of these lines of business is characterized
by a specific combination of objects. Some objects are spe-
cific to 1 line of business; others are common to several lines
of business. The user derives the meaning of an object from
the business domain of that object and from the context in
which the object is used.6
EMRs and EHRs are the foundation of e-health systems.7
These concepts and their extension to accommodate online
collaboration through Web 2.0 tools and strategies are dis-
cussed below. We explore the adoption of Web 2.0 technolo-
gies in health care business lines and service delivery, and
focus on the intersection of EMRs in e-health and potential
use of Web 2.0 to facilitate social networking, participation,
and collaboration. The term Medicine 2.0 is also discussed to
provide a parallel for Web 2.0 in a health care organization
environment.
EHR and EMR
Currently, the meaning of EHR is variable. As EHRs have
many functions and include many kinds of data, it is neces-
sary to explicitly determine what EHR means.8 According to
the International Organization for Standardization (ISO),9
EHR means a repository of patient data in digital form,
stored and exchanged securely, and accessible by multiple
authorized users. An EHR contains retrospective, concur-
rent, and prospective information, and its primary purpose is
to support continuing, efficient, and quality integrated health
care.
EMRs are defined as electronic medical data and reports
about patients' conditions, images, physiological signals,
checkups, medical treatment videos, and medical forms.10,11
EMRs allow patient health records to be stored, updated, and
exchanged between various medical facilities and health care
organizations nationwide.12 The functionality provided by
these systems include simple patient records, elaborate
patient management, electronic medication ordering, and
billing systems.13 They can improve the quality of health
care delivery; increase efficiency, transparency, and clarity in
medical records; decrease medical errors; provide easy
access to consolidated patient records; reduce physician
mental workload; decrease duplication of medical tests; and
reduce staff time in locating and extracting information from
patient files.14
EMRs contain the records of a patient's health-related
information generated and owned by a particular health care
provider, whereas EHRs contain the records of a patient's
long-term and aggregated health-related information gener-
ated by encounters in any care delivery setting, and stem-
ming from the interoperability of multiple providers. EHRs
may also contain patient demographics, progress notes,
problems, medications, medical history, immunizations, lab-
oratory data, and radiology reports.15
Neither an EMR nor EHR allows patients to update and
add content, even though this content may be useful to help
improve treatment.16 Patients are therefore not sure what
authority they have in interacting with their health data or
clinical records. The Web 2.0 tools, discussed below, have
made sharing information and content easy and fast. We
argue that patients should be dynamically included to enrich
information related to their daily activities, habits, or other
information useful for their health-related records. With this
in mind, EMRs and EHRs may be extended to allow dynamic
Web 2.0 concepts to be used in e-health services, meaning
dynamic and rich content from diverse sources can be used
to create innovative ways to view health information. We
Almunawar et al 3
used an object-oriented approach to define our novel EHO
concept.
Medicine 2.0
The impact of Web 2.0 technologies on health continues to
grow, and the term Medicine 2.0 has entered popular catego-
rization. According to Hughes etal,17 the terms Medicine 2.0
and Health 2.0 were similar and could be categorized by (1)
the participants involved (eg, doctors, patients), (2) the
impact on traditional and collaborative practices in medicine,
(3) the ability to provide personalized health care, (4) the
ability to promote ongoing medical education, and (5) asso-
ciated method- and tool-related issues, such as potential
inaccuracy in end user­generated content.17 In comparing
definitions of Medicine 2.0 with e-health, key distinctions
are made by the collaborative nature of Medicine 2.0 and its
emphasis on personalized health care. However, there are
common elements such as health or medical education.
Medicine 2.0 refers to the use of a specific set of Web
tools (eg, blogs, podcasts, tags, search, wikis) by actors in
health care including doctors, patients, and scientists, using
principles of open source and user-generated content, and the
power of networks to personalize health care, and collabo-
rate and promote health education.17
Supporting this are 5 themes that we define as follows:
1. Participants: different stakeholders in Medicine 2.0.
2. Method/tools: the manner in which Medicine 2.0
information is created and owned (eg, accuracy of
user-generated information, open source or owner-
ship, and the use of specific tools such as wikis).
3. Collaboration and practice: Medicine 2.0 as a tool to
promote participants' interests as readers (staying
informed), or to communicate and collaborate collec-
tively for their own practice.
4. Medical education: Medicine 2.0's educational
potential for the general public, training health pro-
fessionals, or ongoing education for specialists
(examining and collaboration on a particular patient
case).
5. Personalized health: Medicine 2.0 as a mechanism to
provide customized health care, such as connecting
patients with rare conditions and improving health
care value for an individual.
Some doctors resist for their patients' to use Medicine 2.0
to generate information as they worry about information
inaccuracy and potential risks associated with inaccuracy,
and privacy and ownership issues. There are some interest-
ing debates on this issue.17
The first debate relates to agreement on the existence of
Web 2.0.18 This debate has flowed into Medicine 2.0, with dis-
cussion about terms such as Health 2.0 possibly not existing.19
However, some researchers have argued that Medicine 2.0
and Health 2.0 may be terms that have evolved for differ-
ent audiences such as academic, business, and health
consumers.17,20
Second, doctors' resistance to their patients' use of
Medicine 2.0 may be due to unwanted patient behavior such
as not consulting a physician, consulting a physician too late,
or coming to wrong conclusions about their disease manage-
ment even if the information available to them online is
accurate.
Third, methods used to generate Medicine 2.0 informa-
tion risk inaccuracy. However, in exploring specific informa-
tion about an Internet-based cancer support group, most
information was accurate and false or misleading statements
were rapidly corrected.21 The impact of information accu-
racy and credibility in relation to e-health should not be wor-
ried too much as patients tend to use both intermediate
(experts, authorities) and distributed (Medicine 2.0) informa-
tion to make their health decisions, thereby reducing risk
from inaccurate user-generated online information.20
Finally, debate relates to the consequences of the methods
used to generate Medicine 2.0 information. In addition to
information accuracy, the nature of health information means
that privacy, ethical, legal, and ownership issues are critical.17
This also applies to doctors who may use social networking
sites for medical education and debate.22 Overall, good mod-
els are needed to realize the advantages promised by Web 2.0
and develop new sources of health information sharing.
Methods
The present study was conducted in 5 stages: a literature
review, developing a reference model, conducting a survey,
developing the prototype, and testing. The literature analysis
informed development of the reference model and guided the
next stage. In the third stage, a survey was conducted based
on the features of the reference model. The survey aimed to
confirm user requirements and their perspective on the fea-
tures of the proposed model. The results of the survey were
used to develop our prototype (Clinic 2.0) in an iterative
approach. Finally, we tested Clinic 2.0 in a health care center
of Indonesia. Details of the survey have been published
elsewhere.23
Electronic Health Object
EHRs and EMRs were developed on the basis of patients as
solely recipients of care with content generated by health
care providers. Patients or their families have no authoriza-
tion to access this information, no means to dynamically
contribute to generating content, and no media to share infor-
mation or seek opinions from other patients/health care pro-
viders.24 As neither an EMR nor EHR allows patients to
update and add new content, the records are static medical
information entities with all data generated or controlled by
health care providers.
4 INQUIRY
We argue that patients should not be considered as solely
recipients of care, as they are partners in the whole health
care process because of the information and knowledge they
have. Patients can help themselves or at least partly self-care
during long-term health care processes.25 A new concept that
incorporates this view and a new strategy to make it happen
are necessary. Viewing patients as partners in care implies
that patients are empowered in a dynamic health care pro-
cess. It means health care organizations should incorporate
patients in generating the content of health records, which
are considered to belong to patients or perceived as benefi-
cial if they empower patients or their families. For example,
patients' personal data and daily habits can be modules that
they are authorized to access and self-manage.
EHO extends EHR by incorporating patients as partners
of care, empowering them to generate content and have con-
trol of their own health records. Although complex, espe-
cially in defining who and what to access, providing
e-empowerment offers the advantage of patients (consum-
ers) becoming actively involved in their health care pro-
cesses. EHO was developed using an object-oriented
approach as this allowed us to dynamically expand an EHR-
based system with the concept of usability and extensibility.
To achieve our goal, we needed to redefine the objects
and their roles within electronic information flow. The term
object refers to the object-oriented paradigm in information
systems or computer science. Objects are reusable compo-
nents as they are independent encapsulations of state and
operations. A reusable component is a piece of software that
is independent of any application. A broad overview of the
relationship between components and objects is that each
component is an object that is not bound to a particular pro-
gram, computer language, or implementation.26
In object-oriented terminology, an object class is a tem-
plate of objects comprising attributes and operations. The
object class is a container for objects and used to create
objects; a child class inherits attributes and operations from a
parent class. Object classes can be organized in a hierarchy
that shows the relationship between general and more spe-
cific object classes. Objects communicate by sending mes-
sages that will invoke the associated methods in other
objects. Figure 1 illustrates an object-oriented approach to
determine objects in the class medical that focus on object
diseases.
The EHO concept views e-health activities as groups of
objects with embedded attributes and behaviors. The EHO
proposes a comprehensive view of the role of the patient
within an e-health system, suggesting that a patient as a part-
ner in the health care process has 3 distinct roles: an indi-
vidual health actor, a social health agent, and as a partner in
the medical care process. These roles are represented in the
system as object classes personal, social, and medical.
Object class personal refers to the module (object) personal
daily life activity (PDLA). Object class social is represented
by the module social life activities (SLA). Finally, object
class medical refers to medical activities (MA) such as
checkups, O/P treatment, and I/P treatment.
In EHO, object class medical is comparable with the con-
cept in EMR. With this in mind, EHO proposes to extend an
EMR by accommodating the dynamic social and personal
roles. To understand the differences between EHR and EHO,
Table 1 summarizes EHO concepts as distinct from EHRs'.
EHO places e-health information exchange at the center. It
assumes that extensive e-health services authorize patients to
partially participate in the process of health care activities
(PDLA, SLA, MA). Patient involvement empowers them to
achieve health prevention, health literacy, and be able to take
better action for personal health decision making.
Figure 2 sets out the information flow in an EHO scenario
where the source of information includes patient data, knowl-
edge resource, and directory information. Patient data are
categorized as personal health data and personal medical
data. EHO proposes that personal health data and medical
data are synchronized to obtain a comprehensive view of
patient data. In conventional systems, medical data refer to
EMR and are mostly generated by health care staff.
Distinguished personal health data differ from personal med-
ical data.27 Personal health data are the individual's personal
habits that may affect the overall health status of that indi-
vidual.28 For example, eating and sleeping habits may affect
blood pressure and the process updating this information
may be empowering for the individual.29 Sources of informa-
tion from personal health data or medical data should accom-
modate multiple health care providers to ensure personal
health data are comprehensible.
The knowledge resource manages the accumulation, dis-
semination, and distribution of comprehensive health knowl-
edge that is accessible to users, including patients, patients'
families, doctors, researchers, and health care management.
The knowledge resource aims to help users stay informed
about the latest developments and to enable them interact,
discuss, and contribute to the content of the knowledge
resource.30 What makes EHO different is that patients are
authorized to access, update, post queries, or verify informa-
tion stored in the knowledge resource. To ensure information
Figure 1. Object-oriented approach.
Almunawar et al 5
quality and reliability, an individual may contribute to the
knowledge resource after verification of general clinical evi-
dence, while knowledge originating from social networks
can be placed in different cluster to distinguish the level of
information quality and integrity. The directory consigns the
expertise and services available to the health care organiza-
tion to a database.
EHO and Patient Empowerment
The introduction of EHO within e-health systems is expected
to have a positive effect on health prevention and patient
empowerment. E-health initiatives can provide effective
self-service that empowers patients and allows organizations
to reduce costs by handling an increasing number of con-
sumer transactions more efficiently. There is good evidence
that coaching patients using e-health empowerment strate-
gies leads to broadened, less negative definitions of illness as
well as improved patient self-management. However, with-
out commitment from health care organizations, the benefits
of empowerment are unlikely to emerge.31
Web 2.0 drives changes in customer behavior in terms of
interaction and empowerment, enabling customers (patients)
to engage in conversations and interact with other patients.
This between-patient interaction is another form of empow-
erment, as they can share and discuss health-related issues
including services provided by health care organizations.32 The
ability to view medical records proposed by EHO is another
form of empowerment that can promote self-awareness and
may improve health literacy.33
Enabling patient access to their medical records may also
simplify requests for second opinions from other health or
medical practitioners, although the privacy and confidential-
ity of medical staff involved must be upheld. Social network-
ing media are another form of patient empowerment offered
by EHO. Sharing knowledge and information in social net-
works provides patients or their families with knowledge and
information about their health concerns. For example, patients
with diabetes may like to share and discuss experiences with
other patients with diabetes, for moral support or to exchange
information or experiences. Empowerment through EHO
may also contribute to decision making; more information

available to patients means more accurate and reasonable
decisions can be achieved.
Figure 3 presents the EHO business architecture, encom-
passing object classes personal (PDLA module/object per-
sonal), social (SLA module/object social), and medical (MA
module/object medical). In a traditional e-health system,
object class medical is similar to EMRs.
Object personal consists of object identity/profile (ID),
object personal habits (HB), object exercise (EX), object
emotional and spiritual (SE), object personal health plan
(HP), object personal account (AC), and more objects
depending on need and urgency. Object class social consists
of all objects related to social networking and media, includ-
ing object conversation (CS), object knowledge management
(KM), and object resolution (RS). Finally, object medical
consists of activities such as objects e-appointment (EA),
examination (XM), treatment (TM), and e-prescription (EP).
Each object also contains sub-sub modules. For example,
object XM may be composed of chronic disease (cc) and
nonchronic disease (nc). In turn, chronic disease comprises
diabetes (da), cancer (ca), obesity (ob), and others. The
object-oriented approach allows an object to inherit attri-
butes and methods/operations from the parent object(s).
How does the model support e-empowerment? The
object-oriented approach helps to determine the process of
e-empowerment. Some activities (represented as objects)
have embedded information and actions that can be dele-
gated to patients and/or their families. For example, object
classes personal and social can be fully empowered to
patients/families. However, the object class medical cannot
be fully empowered to patients/families because of the
mechanism by which information and actions are shared,
such as authorization and access control.
Figure 3 shows an e-health service as an integrated health
care activity that governs personal health care processes in
relation to personal, medical, and social activities. The model
suggests that e-empowerment can be assigned to any object
class or at a subclass level. The circle with a solid yellow line
indicates that empowerment has been assigned to that object,
whereas no circle means empowerment has not been
assigned. A circle with a yellow dashed line indicates partial
e-empowerment. For example, a health care provider only
gives patients authorization to read his or her medical
records.
EHO offers a holistic view and mechanism for health care
providers to give e-empowerment to their customers based on
a modular approach. However, e-empowerment within the
object class medical needs goodwill from health care provid-
ers and may need to conform to the law that protects medical
records. For instance, Australian government has introduced
a revolutionary e-health system through Personally Controlled
Electronic Health Records (PCEHR). PCEHR supports
patients to view their medical records; however, the ability to
update medical records is strictly disabled using object-
oriented approach in Clinic 2.0. Object medical is divided
into 2 objects: chronical diseases and nonchronical diseases.
For nonchronical diseases, Clinic 2.0 empowers patients to
update their medical status into the systems. For instance, in
the case patients get fever and influenza, they can input their
medical condition and their own treatment to the system. By
looking at those medical records generated by patients, physi-
cians can have a broader perspective of patients' condition.
Implementing EHO With Clinic 2.0
Clinic 2.0 is a prototype of e-health system based on EHO
using the Web 2.0 platform. It implements the paradigm of
an interactive health care system where the patient is per-
ceived as partner in care.Although Clinic 2.0 does not imple-
ment complete modules as proposed in the EHO business
architecture (Figure 3), it offers multiway patient interaction.
Three possible relationships involved in an e-health system
are patient alone (patient interactions with the system),
patient-to-patient interactions, and patient-to-health care
provider interactions.
Figure 2. Information flow in EHO.
Note. EHO = electronic health object.

Almunawar et al 7
Personal objects refer to a patient's ability to have interac-
tive sessions with Clinic 2.0 systems. Interactivity means the
patient is able to participate in generating content and data
into Clinic 2.0 as well as retrieving data or content when it is
needed. This feature is not possible in the traditional e-health
system, as the static approach views the patient as a recipient
of care with no means of interaction with the system.
A significant element of patient interactivity is achieved by
enabling them to view their medical information electronically.
Object class personal contains personal health information that
the patient is fully authorized to view, update, and delete at any
time.An individual can dynamically interact with the system to
acquire their own health information and personal habits.34
Medical objects enable Clinic 2.0 to support the interac-
tion between health care providers and their patients. The
interactions concern with the medical activities (eg, store,
update, exchange, record, retrieve, medication, ordering,
prescription) from patient checkups, I/P or O/P treatment,
where the presence of medical staff is compulsory to ensure
the quality and reliability of medical records. The scope and
dimension of object class medical are limited to clinical or
medical treatment and activities.
Figure 4 shows a screenshot of Clinic 2.0 consultation his-
tory. Consultation history exists within the object class medi-
cal. It is composed of specific fields: date, diagnosis treatment,
hospital (place), medical staff, and action. This module is
authorized for health care providers or medical staff to enter
all required information. Patients can view their consultation
history but cannot change anything recorded by the health
care provider. In the future direction, patients will be able to
update the consultation with the guidance from an online
health educator. However, there must be a mechanism and
authentication process for information entered by patients.
For example, a patient seeks a second opinion from another
health care provider; the result of that consultation can be
added to the existing record.
Finally, social objects in Clinic 2.0 offer multiway inter-
actions that empower patients through patient-patient con-
versations. It is an informal means of interaction between
patients to share experiences and discuss issues related to
health care services or medical concerns. It encourages
patients to express concerns and feelings through a channel
provided by the organization so that it can be part of the
health care process. A health care professional or team
(online health educator) should monitor the conversation
process and provide support or assistance as needed during
the conversation. The presence of online health education
within a conversation is important to ensure the quality of
information. Online health education can deepen relation-
ships between health care providers and patients.

Privacy and Security
Privacy and security are the main concern in an e-health imple-
mentation. In fact, many patients hesitate to adhere to using the
service if there is no guarantee of privacy and security. However,
the need for interconnectivity and accessibility is strong, and the
law in accessing personal health information protects individuals.
It is challenging from the technical, organizations, and legal per-
spectives. However, the advantages offered by e-empowerment
are promising such as involving patients in the health care pro-
cess, increasing efficiency in managerial tasks, and improving
health awareness or health literacy of users.
There is no doubt that all health care professionals must
uphold confidentiality of their patients'data. Consequently, it is
in need of the system to meet requirements such as maximum
security, sufficient privileges for users to fulfill their respective
tasks, and easy user maintenance. Implementing a client/server
environmentovertheInternetprovidesgreatflexibility.However,
in an e-health environment, highly sensitive information is at a
greater risk of being lost, manipulated, and spoofed.

aspects of activities and information is secure: first, access
protection given to users to access the service from the
Internet; second, an object-oriented authorization design;
third, ensuring that protection is provided at a network com-
munication level; and, finally, log activity monitoring, rou-
tine, and nonroutine analysis of network assessment must be
carried out to understand access patterns toward the
systems.
Conclusions
Health care organization is heavily dependent on
Information and Communication Technology (ICT) .
Many e-health initiatives to improve health care efficiency
and effectiveness have been widely proposed. EMR and
EHR are 2 well-known health record systems, which have
many similarities and share the objective of improving
efficiency and effectiveness of health care business pro-
cesses through ICT. However, EHR has wider data cover-
age than EMR, as it contains a patient's long-term and
aggregated health-related information generated by 1 or
more encounters in any care delivery setting stemming
from the interoperability of multiple providers, rather than
health-related data generated by a particular health care
provider.
EHO was developed using an object-oriented approach
that allows usability and extensibility, meaning that EHO is
more flexible than EMR or EHR. Traditional EMR and
EHR were developed on the basis of patients being sole
recipients of care. EHO incorporates patients as partners in
care, empowering them to generate content and to have bet-
ter control or access to their own health records. Social
objects enable patients to share their health experiences in
Clinic's social networks. Personal objects empower patients
to generate personal health habits. Medical objects enable
patients to view their medical records.
