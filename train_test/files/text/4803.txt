ABSTRACT
The 4 allele of the gene that encodes apolipoprotein E
(APOE4) is the greatest genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's
disease (AD), while APOE2 reduces AD risk, compared to
APOE3. The mechanism(s) underlying the effects of APOE
on AD pathology remains unclear. In vivo, dendritic spine
density is lower in APOE4-targeted replacement (APOE-TR)
mice compared with APOE2- and APOE3-TR mice. To inves-
tigate whether this apoE4-induced decrease in spine density
results from alterations in the formation or the loss of den-
dritic spines, the effects of neuron age and apoE isoform on
the total number and subclasses of spines were examined
in long-term wild-type neurons co-cultured with glia from
APOE2-, APOE3- and APOE4-TR mice. Dendritic spine density
and maturation were evaluated by immunocytochemistry via
thepresenceofdrebrin(anactin-bindingprotein)withGluN1
(NMDA receptor subunit) and GluA2 (AMPA receptor subunit)
clusters. ApoE isoform effects were analyzed via a method
previously established that identifies phases of spine forma-
tion (day-in-vitro, DIV10­18), maintenance (DIV18­21) and
loss (DIV21­26). In the formation phase, apoE4 delayed total
spine formation. During the maintenance phase, the density
of GluN1 + GluA2 spines did not change with apoE2, while
the density of these spines decreased with apoE4 compared
to apoE3, primarily due to the loss of GluA2 in spines. During
the loss phase, total spine density was lower in neurons with
apoE4 compared to apoE3. Thus, apoE4 delays total spine
formation and may induce early synaptic dysfunction via
impaired regulation of GluA2 in spines.

INTRODUCTION
Apolipoprotein E (apoE) is a protein component of plasma
lipoproteins known primarily for its role in lipid transport and
maintenance of cholesterol homoeostasis in the periphery
and the central nervous system. Within the brain, apoE is
synthesized primarily by glia, and secreted for subsequent
interactions with members of the apoE family of receptors
expressed by neurons and glia (Boyles et al., 1985; Pitas et al.,
1987; Linton et al., 1991; Rapp et al., 2006). ApoE is encoded
by the APOE gene with three common alleles in the human
population: 2, 3 and 4. Compared to APOE3, inheritance
of APOE4 increases risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) 4- to
15-fold depending on the presence of one or two alleles, and
reduces the age of AD onset (Strittmatter and Roses, 1996). In
contrast, APOE2 reduces AD risk 2- and 4-fold (Corder et al.,
1994). The specific mechanisms underlying APOE-dependent
AD risk remain unclear.
AD manifests as a loss of short-term memory, followed by
loss of long-term memory and cognition. Evidence demon-
strates loss of hippocampal synapses as a major structural
correlate of the cognitive dysfunctions in AD (Scheff et al.,
2006, 2007). ApoE plays a critical role in the regulation of
neuron and synapse development, maintenance and repair

E. Nwabuisi-Heath and others
(Valastro et al., 2001; Kim et al., 2011). These functions of
apoE are modulated by apoE isoform and may serve as a
source of the APOE-associated AD risk. Initial in vitro anal-
yses of apoE isoform effects on neurons show that apoE3
enhances, while apoE4 inhibits or has no effect on, neurite
extension during neuron development (Nathan et al., 1995;
Sun et al., 1998; Nathan et al., 2002). In the cortex of human
APOE-targeted replacement (APOE-TR) mice (Sullivan et al.,
1997, 1998) dendritic spine density and dendritic complexity
was lowest in APOE4-TR mice, compared with APOE2- and
APOE3-TR mice (Dumanis et al., 2009). In hippocampal slice
cultures from APOE-TR mice, synaptic plasticity was altered
in the dentate gyrus and CA1 regions of APOE4-TR mice
(Trommer et al., 2004; Korwek et al., 2009).
While apoE4 is associated with a reduction in the density
of dendritic spines relative to apoE2 and apoE3 both in vitro
and in vivo (Ji et al., 2003; Dumanis et al., 2009), it is un-
clear whether apoE4 inhibits the formation or enhances the
loss of spines. Dendritic spines are highly dynamic structures
that undergo cycles of extension and retraction, although as
neurons mature more stable spines gradually replace motile
spines. The dynamic nature of spines suggests that dendritic
spine density reflects the net balance between spine forma-
tion and elimination. Longitudinal analysis of spine density
demonstrates an initial increase in spine density, a relatively
stable phase, followed by a decrease in spine density as neu-
rons mature (Papa et al., 1995; Nwabuisi-Heath et al., 2012).
Therefore, longitudinal analysis of spine density provides a
model to evaluate the relative effects of apoE isoform on the
formation and elimination of spines.
N-methyl-D-aspartate and -amino-3-hydroxy-5-
methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid ionic glutamate receptors
(NMDAR and AMPAR, respectively) are the primary mediators
of excitatory synapse transmission (Thal, 2012) and are
critically involved in the formation, maturation and stability
of dendritic spines (Petralia et al., 1999; Alvarez et al., 2007;
Wirths and Bayer, 2012). Ultimately, memory and cognitive
deficits result from synaptic dysfunction, which may be the
result of glutamate receptor-dependent alterations in spines,
as spines that lack NMDAR or AMPAR exhibit impaired or loss
of synaptic transmission (Ye et al., 2000). Interestingly, apoE
isoforms have been shown to differentially affect NMDAR
and AMPAR signaling and trafficking: in reelin-stimulated
cultures, apoE4 inhibits NMDAR subunit phosphorylation
and surface expression of AMPAR, compared with apoE2
and apoE3 (Chen et al., 2010). Losses of NMDAR and AMPAR
in cortical neurons with age have also been reported (Hof
et al., 2002), however, apoE isoform effects on NMDAR and
AMPAR loss remain unknown.
In the current study, the effects of apoE isoform and
neuron age on the density and composition of NMDAR and
AMPAR on dendritic spines were examined in long-term wild-
type (wt) neurons co-cultured with glia from APOE-TR mice.
These effects were evaluated during phases of dendritic spine
formation (day-in-vitro, DIV10­18), maintenance (DIV18­21)
and loss (DIV21­26) as a continuum, using a method previ-
ously designed for this in vitro model (Nwabuisi-Heath et al.,
2012). This neuron­glia co-culture model was utilized to take
advantage of the natively regulated secretion of apoE by glia
isolated from APOE2-, APOE3- and APOE4-TR mice. The cur-
rent study demonstrates that apoE4 delayed spine forma-
tion during neuron development, compared with apoE2 and
apoE3. With increasing neuron age, apoE4 induced a loss of
mature spines compared to apoE2 and apoE3, primarily via
the loss of AMPAR from spines.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Primary neuron, glia, and neuron­glia
co-cultures
Animals were handled according to the Institutional Animal
Care and Use Committee (IACUC) protocols at the University
of Illinois at Chicago, and the National Institutes of Health
Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. Primary
neuron and glial cultures were prepared as previously de-
scribed (Nwabuisi-Heath et al., 2012). Briefly, five to seven
E17 embryos or postnatal-day 2/3 (P2/3) pups were used for
primary neuron or glial culture, respectively. For co-culture,
DIV5 neurons prepared from C57BL6 (Charles River, Jackson
Labs) mouse embryos on 12 mm- or 15 mm-diameter cover-
slips were transferred into six-well plates containing tertiary
glial cells prepared from APOE2-, APOE3- or APOE4-TR mice.
Two or three coverslips were placed in each well with the neu-
rons facing the glia. Paraffin wax spotted on the surface of
the coverslips prevented direct contact between neurons and
glia. Cells were co-cultured in neurobasal media containing
1×B27 supplement and 1×Glutamax. Every 3­4 days, 10%
of the media was changed.
Immunocytochemistry
On DIV 10, 14, 18, 21 and 26, neurons on coverslips were
rinsed in artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF: 145 mM NaCl,
3 mM KCl, 1 mM CaCl2
, 10 mM Hepes, 1 mM MgCl2
, and
8 mM dextrose), fixed with ice-cold methanol for 15 min, and
permeabilized with 1×phosphate-buffered saline containing
0.025% Triton X-100 detergent (1×PBS-TX) for 10 min. Af-
ter blocking with 3% BSA in 1×PBS for 30 min, neurons
were incubated for 1 h with an antibody mixture contain-
ing: rabbit anti-GluR2 (Millipore, 1:50 dilution) for AMPAR
subunit 2 (GluA2); mouse anti-NR1 (Pharmingen, 1:50 dilu-
tion) for NMDAR subunit 1 (GluN1); pig anti-drebrin (Fitzger-
ald, 1:500 dilution); and anti-MAP2 (Abcam, 1:500 dilution).
Neurons were washed and incubated for 30 min with a mix-
ture of corresponding Alexa fluorophore-labelled secondary
antibodies (Invitrogen, 1:500 dilution) containing: donkey
anti-rabbit 750, donkey anti-mouse 647, donkey anti-guinea
pig 488, and goat anti-chicken 594. Following three 5 min
washes with 1×PBS-TX, coverslips were mounted on slides

with Prolong Gold Antifade reagent with DAPI (Invitrogen).
Mounting media were allowed to cure overnight.
Image acquisition, dendrite sampling and
quantitative analysis
Image acquisition, dendrite sampling and quantitative analy-
ses were performed as previously described (Nwabuisi-Heath
et al., 2012). Briefly, wide-field images of neurons were ac-
quired using a Zeiss Axio Imager M1 fluorescence microscope
equipped with a Zeiss AxioCam HRm camera and controlled
with Axiovision version 4.7 software. Images were captured
with a 63× 1.4 NA oil objective. Three to five positions per
coverslip were randomly selected and a 5×6 mosaic of 63×
images per position were captured at 2776×2080 pixel reso-
lution. Each mosaic contained an average of 15­20 neurons.
For dendrite sampling, spiny neurons with discrete dendrites
were marked, as determined by immunoreactivity for MAP2
and drebrin. All channels were then turned off except for
MAP2 and DAPI for dendrite sampling. Dendrite segments
20 m in length, from two to three dendrites per neuron,
were sampled 50 m away from the cell body. Distance and
length measurements were performed using the Axiovision
software measurement tool. Acquired 20 m dendrite images
were discarded in cases where two or more dendrites were
in close proximity such that overlap of spines was suspected.
Images of sampled dendrites were exported as tiff images for
quantitative analysis.
As previously described (Nwabuisi-Heath et al., 2012),
drebrin, GluN1 and GluA2 cluster quantifications were per-
formed with ImageJ NIH software using custom plugins. For
co-localization analysis, juxtaposed (within 1 pixel distance)
and overlapping clusters were measured as co-localized. All
measurements were performed on a per 20 m dendrite ba-
sis. An average `n' of 50 dendrite segments per isoform per
time point was used for spine analysis. Data shown are repre-
sentative of two independent experiments and are expressed
as means +
- S.E.M. Statistical analyses of apoE isoform effects
was performed by one-way ANOVA and Tukey's post-hoc test,
P < 0.05 (GraphPad Prism 5); and significance between time
points for a single isoform was analyzed by unpaired Stu-
dent's t tests with equal variance, P < 0.01.
Identification of spine subtypes
Dendritic spines were identified using drebrin clusters as spine
markers. Triple and double co-localizations of GluN1 and
GluA2 clusters with drebrin clusters (Figure 1) were used to
identify spine subtypes. Triply co-localized GluN1, GluA2 and
drebrin clusters (GluN1 + GluA2 + drebrin clusters) identified
mature spines. Immature spine densities were determined
by subtracting the density of GluN1 + GluA2 + drebrin clus-
ters from total drebrin clusters at each time point per iso-
form. The density of GluN1-only or GluA2-only spines at
each time point per isoform was determined by subtracting
GluN1 + GluA2 + drebrin clusters from the density of dou-
bly co-localized GluN1 + drebrin or GluA2 + drebrin clusters,
respectively. Drebrin-only spine densities were determined
by subtracting the densities of GluN1 + GluA2 + drebrin,
GluN1-only and GluA2-only clusters from the total drebrin
cluster density.
RESULTS

Dendritic spines have actin-rich, bulbous heads, distinguish-
ing them from the more dynamic filopodia protrusions.

Drebrin, an actin-binding protein, is enriched and clustered in
spine heads. Therefore, drebrin clusters were used as markers
for spines, to exclude contributions from filopodia exten-
sions in spine density analyses (Figure 1). As previously re-
ported, drebrin cluster density from DIV10 to DIV26 revealed
phases of increasing spine density (spine formation phase,
DIV 10­18), stabilization of spine density (spine maintenance
phase, DIV 18­21), and decreasing spine density (spine loss
phase, DIV 21­26) (Nwabuisi-Heath et al., 2012), in wt neu-
rons co-cultured with glia isolated from APOE2-, APOE3- and
APOE4-TR mice. For total spine density, the greatest density
on DIV10 was with apoE2, with no difference between apoE3
and apoE4 (Figure 2). On DIV14, spine density was signifi-
cantly lower with apoE4, with no difference between apoE2
and apoE3. Between DIV14 and DIV18, spine density increased
in all three groups with no significant difference among the
apoE isoforms. The lower density of spines with apoE4 early in
development (DIV14), and the subsequent increase to levels
comparable with apoE2 and apoE3 cultures (DIV18) suggest a
delay, rather than a reduction, in spine formation with apoE4.
From DIV18 to DIV21, total spine densities were comparable
with apoE2, apoE3 and apoE4. However, by DIV26, signifi-
cant decreases in spine density were observed with apoE2
and apoE4.

synapse on the spines. To determine if apoE isoform had
specific effects on subpopulations of spines defined by the
presence of these two types of glutamate receptors, we first
analyzed the density of spines containing both the NMDAR
subunit GluN1 and the AMPAR subunit GluA2 (Figure 3A and
Table 1). On DIV10, the density of spines containing both
NMDAR and AMPAR (GluN1 + GluA2 positive) were com-
parable in all apoE groups. On DIV14, while the density of
GluN1 + GluA2 positive spines increased with all three apoE
isoforms, apoE2 had a significantly greater effect than apoE3
and apoE4. On DIV18, these GluN1 + GluA2 positive spines
reached maximum density in all three isoforms with no dif-
ferences. Thus, despite the delayed increase in total spine
density with apoE4 in the formation phase, the density of
apoE4 mature spines was comparable to apoE3, with apoE2
accelerated.

During the spine maintenance phase (DIV18­21), there
was a significant decrease in the density of GluN1 + GluA2-
positive spines with only apoE4. Thus, by DIV21, the greatest
density of GluN1 + GluA2-positive spines was with apoE2, an
intermediate density with apoE3 and the lowest density with
apoE4. On DIV26, these GluN1 + GluA2-positive spines de-
creased in all three groups to levels where densities were com-
parable between apoE2 and apoE4, and lowest with apoE3.
Based on these data from DIV18­26, we conclude that apoE4
induces an early loss of functionally mature spines, compared
with apoE2 and apoE3.
Next, we analyzed the effect of apoE isoform on imma-
ture spines, defined as spines that lack one or both of the
glutamate receptor subunits, GluN1 or GluA2 (Figure 3B).
On DIV10, immature spine density was greatest with apoE2,
and comparable between apoE3 and apoE4. On DIV14, the
highest spine density was with apoE3, with no significant
increase with apoE2 and apoE4. This is the time point
where the greatest density of mature spine was with apoE2
(Figure 3A). From DIV14 to DIV18, the density of immature
spines increased with apoE2 and apoE4. On DIV21, further
increases in density were observed with apoE3 and apoE4,
but not with apoE2. At DIV26, immature spine densities
plateaued for apoE2 and apoE3, but significantly decreased
with apoE4. The increase in the density of immature spines
at the maintenance phase (DIV18­21) suggests that the
decrease in the density of mature spines may result from a
loss of either GluN1 and/or GluA2.
To determine the effect of apoE isoform on immature
spine subclasses, analysis was separated to reflect changes
in the densities of spines that express only GluN1 (GluN1-
only), only GluA2 (GluA2-only), or neither GluN1 or GluA2
(drebrin-only) (Figure 4 and Table 1). On DIV10, GluN1-only
spine density was greater with apoE2, and no difference with
apoE4, compared to apoE3 (Figure 4A). On DIV14, GluN1-only
spine density increased with apoE3, resulting in comparable
densities between apoE2 and apoE3 and lower with apoE4.
By DIV18, GluN1-only spines increased for all isoforms. In-
terestingly, the maximal density of GluN1-only spines with
apoE4 was comparable to apoE2 and greater than apoE3.
These data further support accelerated and delayed forma-
tion of new spines with apoE2 and apoE4, respectively. At the
maintenance phase (DIV18­21), GluN1-only spines increased
with apoE3 and apoE4, but not with apoE2; and significantly
decreased with apoE4 on DIV26.
Analysis of GluA2-only spines on DIV10 showed a compa-
rable spine density across apoE isoform (Figure 4B). However,
on DIV14, the highest density was with apoE3. On DIV18, the
density of GluA2-only spines was comparable between apoE2
and apoE4, with a pronounced decrease with apoE3, perhaps
due to acquisition of GluN1 by GluA2-only spines to form
mature GluN1 + GluA2-positive spines. On DIV21, a decrease
in the density of GluA2-only spines was observed with apoE4,
while no change was seen with apoE2 or apoE3. On DIV26,
GluA2-only spines decreased with apoE2 and apoE3, and the
decrease with apoE4 on DIV21 continued.
Drebrin-only spines were analyzed to examine changes
in the density of spines not yet enriched with GluN1 or
GluA2, or that may have lost their GluN1 and GluA2 (Fig-
ure 4C). Drebrin-only spines increased from DIV10 to DIV18 to

spines and a decrease in GluA2-only spines. This suggests
that the loss of GluA2 precedes the GluN1 loss in spines. This
GluA2 loss occurs earlier with apoE4 spines and may con-
tribute to the early loss of mature GluN1 + GluA2-positive
spines.
DISCUSSION
Several studies demonstrate that apoE isoform may differen-
tially influence synapse density, structure and function, with
negative effects reported in the presence of apoE4 (Bour
et al., 2008; Dumanis et al., 2009, 2013). Results presented
herein utilize a co-culture model with natively regulated se-
cretion of human apoE by glia, the main endogenous source
of apoE in the CNS. The simultaneous analysis of changes
in dendritic spines and dendritic spine glutamate receptor
composition demonstrate an apoE4-induced delay in spine
formation in developing neurons, and with increasing time in
culture, an early loss of mature spines, compared with apoE2
and apoE3. Thus, these data provide evidence for a cellu-
lar and molecular basis for age-dependent apoE4 effects on
neuron function in vitro.
APOE4 is associated with poor memory and cognitive
performance and increased risk for AD in older individuals
(usually after 50 years of age) (Deane et al., 2008; Caselli
et al., 2009). However, young APOE4 carriers exhibit en-
hanced cognitive performance (Bachmeier et al., 2013), aca-
demic achievement (Hawkes et al., 2012) and a higher IQ
(Yu et al., 2000) than non-APOE4 carriers. Young APOE4
individuals also show brain oxygen utilization comparable
to APOE2, and higher than APOE3 individuals (Trachtenberg
et al., 2012). Analysis of developing spine subtypes at max-
imal spine density showed that with apoE4, the density of
GluN1 + GluA2 dendritic spines was comparable to apoE3,
but the density of NMDAR-rich and AMPAR-poor (GluN1-
only) spines was greater with apoE4 than apoE3. These
NMDAR-rich and AMPAR-poor spines in developing neurons
are characteristic of immature spines that can undergo sta-
bilization for memory formation and storage (Bourne and
Harris, 2007). Thus, these differences in spine composition
may provide a structural and molecular basis for the ob-
served dichotomy of beneficial effects in young individuals
with APOE4 and the detrimental effects of APOE4 in older
individuals.
The slow development of dendritic spines observed with
apoE4 may also be important in the poor recovery from dam-
age by other insults, such as traumatic brain injury (Teasdale
et al., 1997; Chiang et al., 2003; Zhou et al., 2008) or HIV-
dementia (Burt et al., 2008; Chang et al., 2011). The apoE
isoform-specific effects on inflammation may also be af-
fecting dendritic spines. Aging is associated with increased
pro-inflammatory signaling, which has been shown to induce
internalization or removal of AMPA receptors from synapses
(Hara et al., 2012). Interestingly, in vivo lipopolysaccharide
(LPS) endotoxin treatment in APOE-TR mice induces glial acti-
vation and pro-inflammatory cytokine release, accompanied
by synaptic protein loss, with a greater response in APOE4-TR
mice compared with APOE2- and APOE3-TR mice (Zhu et al.,
2012). The role of apoE isoform-specific neuroinflammation
in the observed early loss of AMPAR from spines is of future
interest.

ApoE isoform effects on dendritic spines
The observed negative effects of apoE4 and positive ef-
fects of apoE2 on spines are consistent with their effects
on AD risk. With apoE4, maintenance of GluA2 at spines
was impaired, while the greatest density of GluA2-positive
spines was observed with apoE2. Early loss of GluA2 from
spines has several negative functional implications. Loss of
AMPAR from spines may result in conversion of functional
synapses into silent, non-functional synapses (Lo and Erzu-
rumlu, 2007). GluA2 also plays a critical role in maintaining
the biophysical properties of AMPAR, including reduction of
AMPAR calcium permeability (Jonas et al., 1994; Geiger et al.,
1995; Washburn et al., 1997). A decrease in GluA2-positive
AMPAR can result in glutamate-induced excitotoxicity, long-
term depression and eventual loss of spines (Luthi et al., 1999;
Van Damme et al., 2002; Hsieh et al., 2006; Medvedev et al.,
2008; Bell et al., 2009).
