Abstract
In early 2015, a public debate about a perceptual phenomenon that impressively demonstrated the
subjective nature of human perception was running round the globe: the debate about #TheDress,
a poorly lit photograph of a lace dress that was perceived as white­gold by some, but as blue­black
by others. In the present research (N ¼ 48), we found that the perceptual difference between
white­gold perceivers (n1
¼ 24, 12 women, Mage
¼ 25.4 years) and blue­black perceivers (n2
¼ 24, 12
women, Mage
¼ 24.3 years) decreased significantly when the illumination information provided by
the original digital photo was reduced by means of image scrambling (Experiment 1). This indicates
that the illumination information is one potentially important factor contributing to the color
ambiguity of #TheDress--possibly by amplification of a slight principal difference in
psychophysics of color perception which the two observer groups showed for abstract
uniformly colored fields displaying a white­blue ambiguity (Experiment 2).

In early 2015, a public debate about a perceptual phenomenon that impressively
demonstrated the subjective nature of human perception was running round the globe: the
debate about #TheDress. It had been initialized by the photo of a lace dress posted on
Tumblr (http://swiked.tumblr.com/post/112073818575/guys-please-help-me-is-this-dress-
white-and; last accessed September 26, 2015, 6:54 p.m. CMTþ1, unfortunately, the original

The_dress_%28viral_phenomenon%29) that evoked ambiguous color perceptions in its
observers. The debate mainly went: It's white with golden lace!--No, it's blue and
black!--No, no, now it's this, then it's that, I can switch! . . . The observation that a stimulus
can induce intra- or interindividually varying, sometimes even switching perceptions is not
new, indeed. Perceptual multistability elicited by ambiguous figures such as the Necker cube
is a classic example in this regard, and the evocation of perceptual challenge by means of
ambiguity is even a core aesthetic principle, for example, in modern art (Muth, Hesslinger, &
Carbon, 2015). Concerning color perception, intra- or inter-individual variation is known as
well: Even though the human visual system is equipped with mechanisms to preserve color
constancy (e.g., Gegenfurtner, 2003), our perceptions of an object's color can vary, for
instance, as these mechanisms work more or less well depending on illumination condition
and background (Pearce, Crichton, Mackiewicz, Finlayson, & Hurlbert, 2014). Interobserver
discrepancies in perceived color can further be related to factors such as differing current
states of chromatic adaptation, different color memories of observers encountering an object,
and differences in the composition of retinal photo pigments (e.g., Jameson, Highnote, &
Wasserman, 2001; Mollon, 1992).
In order to explain the differently perceived colors of #TheDress, several assumptions have
been brought forward by vision scientists, for example, that the different perceptions were
related to differential color sensitivity or differences in anchoring and the resulting lightness
perception (cf. Gilchrist et al., 1999). In the present research, we focussed on the hypothesis
that interindividual differences in the use of illumination information (e.g., Palmer, 1999)
contribute to the variance in the perception of #TheDress. This hypothesis or, as Brainard
and Hurlbert (2015) called it, the ``colour constancy explanation'' refers to the mechanism
which enables color constancy under varying illumination conditions by inferring the type or
quality of illumination of a scene and correcting the percept accordingly. With regards to
#TheDress, it was hypothesized that some persons infer and correct for a bluish illumination,
thus perceiving a white­golden dress, while others infer and correct for a yellowish
illumination, thus perceiving a blue­black dress.
General Method
The sample, setting, and apparatus were the same for both experiments. We describe them
here in the first part. Detailed information on the procedure and results of each experiment
will follow straight afterwards in the respective sections.
Participants
A total of 48 volunteers (24 women; Mage
¼ 24.8 years) with normal or corrected-to-normal
vision (checked via Snellen test) and normal color vision (checked via a short version of the
Ishihara test) participated in the study which comprised Experiments 1 and 2. Each
participant completed both experiments within one session. In order to prevent the
psychophysical functions assessed in Experiment 2 from being biased by previous exposure
to the photo of #TheDress which was shown in Experiment 1, the order the experiments were
2 i-Perception 7(2)
actually executed in was inverse to the numbering we use here: first Experiment 2, then
Experiment 1. On basis of the ratings participants gave for the original digital photo of
#TheDress in Experiment 1, they were post-hoc classified as white­gold perceivers and
blue­black perceivers, respectively. The rating scale ranged from 0 (not blue at all) to 100
(very blue), and participants' classification was executed on basis of a mean score of
50--actually the result of classification would have been exactly the same if we had used a
median split instead as the median was 52.5, so very close to the mean score of 50. By chance,
it turned out that half of the sample was to be classified as white­gold perceivers (n1
¼ 24, 12
women; Mage
¼ 25.4 years), and the other half was to be classified as blue­black perceivers
(n2
¼ 24, 12 women; Mage
¼ 24.3 years). The two groups clearly differed from each other
(Mdiff
¼ 42.9, t46
¼ 9.7, p < .0001, Cohen's d ¼ 2.80--a very large difference regarding
Cohen's definition of a d ¼ 0.80 as indicating an already large effect). Participants were
naive to the purpose of the experiments and were tested individually. All procedures were
in accordance with the national ethical standards on human experimentation and with the
Declaration of Helsinki of 1975, as revised in 2008. Informed written consent was obtained
from all participants.
Setting and Apparatus
Both experiments were conducted in the same laboratory with constant lighting conditions
(no daylight entering from outside; illumination of the lab via Osram cool daylight
technology). The experiments were run on a Dell Desktop PC with a true color Eizo
Color Graphic CG245W TFT monitor (wide screen; 24.100 diagonal, resolution:
1,920 Â 1,200 pixels, color depth: 32 bits per pixel, refresh rate: 60 Hz). The monitor was
linearized via the integrated calibration routine (IPS Panel) at the beginning of each session.
The white point of the monitor was x, y ¼ 0.3324, 0.3474 (D55; 5497 K); the empirical
primaries of our monitor were Red (R) ¼ (0.6767, 0.3068, 27.65), Green (G) ¼ (0.1998,
0.6860, 64.32), and Blue (B) ¼ (0.1507, 0.0537, 5.24) in terms of Commission Internationale
de l'E
´ clairage (CIE) color space xyY values. During the experiments, the participants were
sitting at a constant distance of 50 cm in front of the screen, which was ensured by using a
chin­forehead rest. For stimulus delivery and data collection we used the up-to-date
Experiment Builder version 1.10.1241 (SR Research Ltd., Mississauga, Ontario).
Experiment 1
In Experiment 1, we tested whether illumination information provided by the photo of
#TheDress had an impact on the perception of the colors of #TheDress. Our rationale
was: If the color constancy explanation (see earlier text) is right, that is if interindividual
differences in the use of illumination information significantly contribute to the differences in
the perception of the dress, these differences will decrease when the illumination information
of the image is reduced. A reduction of illumination information was implemented by means
of image scrambling.
Method
Stimuli. We used the original digital photo of #TheDress and multiple variants of the same
that varied with regards to the degree of information about illumination. Photographs
usually provide some kind of information about the illumination of the original scene such
as background or surround, detectable shadows, reflections, familiar objects the color of
Hesslinger and Carbon 3
which is known, and so forth. For the present experiment, we systematically reduced
illumination information by cropping and scrambling the digital photograph of #TheDress
that had been posted on tumblr. More precisely, we first selected a rectangular part of the
original digital photo so that there was nothing of the original background left in the
resulting cropped image rectangle to prevent integrative scrambling of the background (see
Figure 1, leftmost depiction). Then we scrambled the cropped image rectangle (384 Â 904
pixel, visual angle 11.8 Â 27.4) several times using different sizes of scramble squares.
The scrambling process was executed via a self-programmed Matlab routine that
segmented the image into scramble squares with side length a which were randomly
permuted. For the present experiment, we defined the following 17 side lengths: a ¼ 200,
150, 100, 90, 80, 70, 60, 50, 40, 30, 20, 10, 5, 4, 3, 2 pixels, and 1 pixel. The smaller the
used scramble squares were (i.e., the more ``segmented'' the image was), the less valid
illumination information was preserved in the stimulus. So, for the scrambled version with
the smallest scramble squares, illumination information was most strongly reduced as
compared with the original photo (though not fully abolished, of course). The scrambling
process was performed twice for each side length. We thus obtained 2 Â 17 ¼ 34 scrambled
versions. In sum, we had 1 (original digital photo of #TheDress) þ 1 (cropped image
rectangle) þ 34 (scrambled versions of the cropped image rectangle) ¼ 36 stimuli to be used
in Experiment 1. Several exemplary stimuli are presented in Figure 1 (Note. Scrambling is
only one possible procedure for systematically reducing the degree and validity of
illumination information besides, for example, phase manipulation by adding noise, see
Wichmann, Braun, & Gegenfurtner, 2006. We decided to use scrambling as it preserves
the local color information of the image).
Procedure. Participants rated the original digital photograph of #TheDress as well as a
cropped rectangular version and scrambled variants of the same with regards to their
degree of being blue. The whole experiment comprised 36 trials. In each trial, one of the
36 stimuli was presented singly in the center of the screen until participants pressed the space
key to indicate that they were ready to give their rating. On the following screen, participants
were asked to indicate their impression of how blue the just-presented stimulus was. In order
to do so, they entered an integer between 0 ¼ not blue at all and 100 ¼ very blue and confirmed
their decision by pressing the enter key. The next trial started automatically (inter trial

and a trial scheme for Experiment 1 are shown in Figure 2.
Results and Discussion
While white­gold perceivers and blue­black perceivers differed markedly in their
interpretations of the color of less segmented versions, their ratings became closer and
closer to each other with increasing image segmentation (Figure 3). In fact, the difference
between both groups' interpretations of the version that was segmented to a very high degree
(where scramble squares of very small side length were used) and thus provided the least

illumination information was statistically insignificant (see also caption of Figure 3).
The pattern of results we found indicates that the (specific) background and illumination
of the original digital photo of #TheDress contribute to the variation in the perception of the
colors of the depicted garment. This is in line with some of the findings of Lafer-Sousa,
Herman and Conway (2015), who showed that perceivers vary more in their judgments
of the colors of #TheDress when the photo is presented with the original background
than when it is presented with alternative backgrounds that provide ``unambiguous
illumination cues'' (p. R2).
The next question, however, is: Which factor(s) might underlie this individual difference in
color constancy found for #TheDress? Brainard and Hurlbert (2015) suggested testing for
other individual differences using stimuli that are much simpler than #TheDress (p. R553).
That was exactly what we did in the second experiment.
Experiment 2
In Experiment 2, we investigated whether white­gold and blue­black perceivers also differ in
their perceptions of simpler stimuli. To that end, we assessed the different observers'
psychophysical functions of color perception for a white­blue and a gold­black
color continuum, respectively, and compared the perceptions of the two observer groups
(white­gold and blue­black perceivers).
Method
Stimuli. We defined two color continua, one ranging from white (RGB 255, 255, 255; i.e.,
CIE1 xyY: 0.3340, 0.3456, 98.68) to blue (RGB 0, 0, 255; i.e., CIE xyY: 0.1507, 0.0537, 5.24),
and one ranging from gold (RGB 255, 215, 0; i.e., CIE xyY: 0.4761, 0.4653, 76.57) to black
(RGB 0, 0, 0; i.e., CIE xyY: 0.2842, 0.3158, 0.30), respectively--see General Method for
monitor primaries. We divided each continuum into 51 color levels (shades) to be presented
on the screen in the form of uniformly colored full-screen rectangles (1,920 Â 1,200 pixel,
visual angle 54.6 Â 35.9).
Procedure. The experiment comprised two parts. In the first part, participants rated all
51 color levels of the white­blue continuum; in the second part, they rated all 51 color
levels of the gold­black continuum. For each continuum, the respective stimuli were
presented on the screen one by one in randomized order until participants pressed the
space key to indicate that they were ready to give their rating. On the following screen,
participants were asked to indicate the color of the presented stimulus by entering an
integer between 0 and 100 (part 1: 0 ¼ white, 100 ¼ blue; part 2: 0 ¼ gold, 100 ¼ black) and
to confirm their decision by pressing the enter key. The next trial started automatically (inter
trial interval ITI ¼ 1,200 ms). In sum, the experiment comprised 2 (parts) Â 51 (stimuli) ¼ 102
trials. Instructions and a trial scheme for the white­blue continuum are shown in Figure 4.
Results and Discussion
On the white­blue but not the gold­black continuum, the average psychophysical function
obtained for white­gold perceivers differed slightly but systematically and significantly from
the function obtained for blue­black perceivers (p ¼ .0434, p
2 ¼ .092), especially in the case of
color levels (shades) that were colorimetrically more white than blue. Here, blue­black
perceivers reported higher amounts of blue than white­gold perceivers (see Figure 5;
6 i-Perception 7(2)
although interaction color level Â perceiver group was not reaching the significance level of
.05, concretely: p ¼ .0663, the systematic difference between both groups along a wide range
of color levels was quite obvious although being quite small in size). This might reflect a
slightly higher sensitivity for blue components or, at least, a slight bias toward interpreting
white­blue ambiguities as blue rather than white.
General Discussion
The divergent perceptions of #TheDress did also show up under highly standardized lab
conditions with a color-calibrated monitor (see also, e.g., Gegenfurtner, Bloj, & Toscani,
2015). This demonstrates that the observed variance in perceiving #TheDress is not merely a
result of different technical presentation devices used by different observers in the field.
In the present study, we tested the so-called ``colour constancy explanation'' (Brainard &
Hurlbert, 2015) that explains the variation in the perceptions of #TheDress on basis of a

specific mechanism involved in obtaining color constancy under different illumination
conditions. In Experiment 1, we found that the illumination information provided by the
original digital photo of #TheDress and the way it is used by the observer seems to be one
potentially important factor for the divergence it evokes, indeed. Our results may support the
assumption that white­gold and blue­black perceivers process or interpret this information
differently. This difference between the two observer groups might trace back to and amplify
a more basic interindividual difference in the psychophysics of perceiving stimuli that
``display'' a color ambiguity on the white­blue continuum. In Experiment 2, we found that
observers who perceive #TheDress as blue and black are a little bit more ready to interpret or
perceive such ambiguity as blue rather than white. Interestingly, for the gold­black
continuum, we did not find a significant difference between the psychophysical curves of
the two observer groups. This indicates that the interpretation and perception of colors on
the white­blue continuum are of specific importance here.
It should be noted that our results are not only compatible with the color constancy
explanation. For instance, the scrambling method utilized in Experiment 1 does not only
reduce illumination information, but also disrupts form, so Gestalt detection is undermined
and, ultimately, the meaning of the image is not (easily) accessible any longer. The Gestalt
itself, in this case the dress, its design and the texture of the material it is made of, however,
are potential cues for inferences about color. Lafer-Sousa et al. (2015), for example, observed
that relatively more observers interpreted #TheDress as being white and golden, when the
photo was presented at larger sizes so that high-spatial frequency information, which
provides a cue to the material, was more evident.
In our study, the participants did not explicitly report changes of their percepts of
#TheDress. Yet, in related studies in which we investigated further aspects of the
phenomenon of #TheDress in different contexts (unpublished), we registered so-called
``switchers'' as well, and according to the data of Lafer-Sousa et al. (2015), for instance,
numerous naive observers (45%) experience a switch between the first and following
exposures. How to relate such cases of switching to our results on (static) group
differences in psychophysics of interpreting and perceiving white­blue ambiguities is a
question that is not easily answered, but requires further empirical investigation.
The difference between the psychophysical curves of white­gold and blue­black perceivers
that we found in Experiment 2 might be a first indication of more basic differences underlying
the phenomenon of different percepts observed for #TheDress. An important next step would
be locating the (physiological) basis of the found psychophysical results within the visual
apparatus. Furthermore, the processes relating them to the differential use of illumination
information remain to be identified.
