Sexualization, Media, & Society

As these quotes suggest, magazine covers, news headlines,
blogs, and social media routinely feature postpartum images
of celebrities. Research documents how multiple media
forms present celebrity mothers' bodies as ideal types--in
prenatal, pregnant, and postpartum stages (Chambers, 2009;
Douglas & Michaels, 2004; Dworkin & Wachs, 2004;
Echeveste, 2008; Gentile, 2011; Nash, 2005; Pincus, 2010).
Representations of celebrity motherhood begin with tabloids
speculating over the celebrity "baby bumps," followed by a
detailed progression of their pregnancies, and then critiques
of their postpartum bodies.
Douglas and Michaels (2004) suggest that everyday
mothers have several reactions to these "carefully packaged
fantasies" (p. 123): Some mothers fully subscribe to these
images, wanting celebrity bodies and lives for themselves;
other mothers are quite critical, stressing that these images
are airbrushed and have nothing to do with real mothers'
lives. Douglas and Michaels suggest most mothers lie some-
where in between--They are somewhat critical of these
images but also feel inadequate in comparison.
However, like most research on celebrity mother profiles,
Douglas and Michaels (2004) do not directly examine how
these images influence everyday women. Our research fills
this gap by exploring how noncelebrity mothers react to
media featuring celebrity postpartum bodies. We use objecti-
fication theory to frame our research and draw from an inter-
sectionality framework to explore a diverse group of mothers
and their reactions to media. Using in-depth interviews, we
showed our sample of 38 mothers several celebrity mom
body (CMB) images in popular magazines to explore their
reactions. In this article, we focus on two sets of questions:

"Who Doesn't Want to Be This Hot
Mom?": Celebrity Mom Profiles and
Mothers' Accounts of Their Postpartum
Bodies
Brittany M. Williams1, Karen Christopher1, and Jennifer Sinski1
Abstract
In this article, we explore mothers' responses to celebrity mom body (CMB) profiles in popular magazines. Drawing from
objectification theory, we frame CMB images as one component of the ubiquitous sexualization of girls' and women's bodies,
and ask how these images influence mothers' views of their postpartum bodies. While a good deal of previous research
examines the media portrayal of pregnant and postpartum bodies, very few studies go on to ask how these images affect
mothers' self-image and their relationships with men. During in-depth interviews, we showed our sample CMB images and
found that most mothers evaluated themselves negatively; however, we add that they evaluated themselves in different ways
depending on their social class and educational backgrounds. All mothers identified negative effects of CMB images on men,
which diminished mothers' feelings of sexual attractiveness to male partners.

their narratives vary across social class and educational
attainment? Second, how do mothers interpret men's reac-
tions to these images, and how do these interpretations influ-
ence mothers' feelings of sexual attractiveness? To the
literature reviewed below, our research also contributes a
diverse sample of women by race and class; in their own
words, these mothers interpret CMB images and discuss
their own bodies in light of these images.
Literature Review
The Maternal Body in the Media
A large body of scholarship explores representations of
women's bodies in the media. Here we focus on media
representations of the maternal body in the United States,
particularly those using celebrities. Scholars suggest that
the obsession with celebrity motherhood began with Demi
Moore's Vanity Fair cover in 1991, which became the
best-selling single issue in Vanity Fair's history
(Cunningham, 2002; Hopper & Aubrey, 2013). Moore's
cover challenged the historical norm of hiding a woman's
pregnant body, and instead objectified the pregnant female
body, providing the maternal image for public consump-
tion and pleasure (Cunningham, 2002). Throughout the
1990s and 2000s, celebrity women emulated Moore by
posing nude, and often draped in jewels, while pregnant
(Cunningham, 2002; Echeveste, 2008; Nash, 2005). Over
the past two decades, pregnancy photos became a lucra-
tive strategy for selling magazines (Hopper & Aubrey,
2013).
Many have argued that popular media--which increas-
ingly featured celebrity narratives over the 1990s and
2000s--perpetuates unrealistic standards of beauty and
weight (Bordo, 1993; Roberts, 1997; Wolf, 1991) and sexu-
alizes mothers' bodies (Douglas & Michaels, 2004; Oliver,
2010). Media portrayals of pregnant women create a beauty
ideal in which every part of the body is small and contained,
with the exception of the pregnant belly (Bordo, 1993;
Cunningham, 2002; Gentile, 2011; Nash, 2005).
For example, Oliver (2010) analyzes the eroticization of
the pregnant body in popular culture. She argues that Demi
Moore's body represented an entirely novel form of sexual-
izing women's bodies: "Their bodies and their desires are
imagined for others, for men, for the viewing audience, and
not for themselves or as women themselves experience their
own sexuality or desires" (Oliver, 2010, p. 765). Similarly,
Chambers (2009) explores the flaunting of the "ornamental
bump" in the media. Chambers's study, done in the United
Kingdom, examines the ways popular culture uses fertility to
inscribe meanings to women as subjects from 1990s to 2009.
Chambers (2009) concludes that "celebrity pregnancy has
been become part of a sexy to-be-looked at femininity" (p.
15), adding that certain pregnant women--lower-income
women, women of color, and single women--are presented
and discussed in a more negative light than upper-income,
White, married mothers.
Douglas and Michaels's (2004) in-depth media analysis
of celebrity motherhood uncovers a pervasive "new-
momism" ideology that requires perfection in all mothering
practices, including "getting back" their slim, toned bodies.
This ideology "exemplify[ies] what motherhood has become
in our intensified consumer culture: a competition. They
[celebrity mothers] rekindle habits of mind pitting women
against women that the women's movement sought to end,
leaving the notion of sisterhood in the dust" (p. 138). Douglas
and Michaels conclude that the "new-momism" has created
an environment of hypercompetition, guilt, and anxiety for
women.
A handful of studies explore how media covers postpar-
tum weight loss. Dworkin and Wachs (2004) conduct a con-
tent and textual analysis of Shape Fit Pregnancy magazine.
Once the celebrity pregnant body has been exposed on the
cover or within the magazine, the next step is to monitor the
postpartum body, otherwise known as "getting your body
back" (Cunningham, 2002; Dworkin & Wachs, 2004). The
phrase, "letting the body go," has often been used to identify
new mothers who do not immediately return to their prepreg-
nancy weight (Dworkin & Wachs, 2004, p. 616). Magazines
feature before and after photos of women working hard to
return to their "normal body." McRobbie (2006) agrees that
the favorite cover image of celebrity weeklies is the "yummy
mummy" who is back to her pre-baby weight within weeks
of giving birth. O'Donohoe (2008) claims that North
American consumption of the "yummy mummy" resembles
that in the United Kingdom. In sum, women are bombarded
with images of slenderness and containment immediately
after pregnancy, a time when "women feel overwhelmingly
unattractive" (Dworkin & Wachs, 2004, p. 612).
Indeed, research has shown that after having children, the
majority of women's bodies do not return to their original
form, and many women never regain their prepregnancy
shape (Cunningham, 2002; Jenkin & Tiggemann, 1997;
Johnson, Burrows, & Williamson, 2004). Many women
experience feelings of grief and disappointment in regard to
their body after pregnancy (Jenkin & Tiggemann, 1997;
Johnson et al., 2004). P. Fox and Yamaguchi (1997) examine
the relationship between prepregnancy body weight and
body image change in 76 women who were pregnant for the
first time. Among normal-weight women, feelings of self-
consciousness were common, and many said these feelings
were caused by an increase in public scrutiny of their bodies.
Moreover, Collett (2005) suggests that after their pregnancy,
women often remind people or inform them they just had a
baby, so as not to confuse her changed body with one of lazi-
ness or "letting go."
A recent study by B. Fox and Neiterman (2015) found
considerable variation in how Canadian mothers discussed
their postpartum bodies. While many women associated
breastfeeding with powerful feelings toward their maternal
Williams et al. 3
bodies, most mothers reported being unhappy with their
postpartum appearance, particularly their weight gain.
However, B. Fox and Neiterman stress that mothers'material
circumstances--the education, jobs, and resources they
had--mediated their views of their postpartum bodies; moth-
ers with more education and better jobs tended to feel better
about their bodies, in part because they felt they had more
control over their lives. (On the contrary, returning to paid
work did make many mothers more worried about their
appearance.) Drawing from this study, we explore how moth-
ers' narratives about their postpartum bodies vary by social
class and educational attainment.
While many content analyses have examined how media
portrayals objectify women, limited research explores the
effects of media on pregnant and postpartum women. One
important exception is Hopper and Aubrey's (2013) analysis
of celebrity gossip magazines and pregnant women's self-
objectification. Hopper and Aubrey separate 301 pregnant
women into three groups: one viewed highly objectifying
images of celebrity pregnant women (showing their full bod-
ies in little clothing), one group saw much less objectifying
images of celebrity pregnant women (only headshots), and
the control group saw baby products. They found that in their
first trimester, the pregnant women shown the less objectify-
ing pictures reported the most self-objectification (measured
by how often women described features of their own bodies
when describing themselves). They suggested,
Images of thin, toned, and sculpted celebrity bodies are so
prevalent in our culture and these bodies are so frequently
objectified by the media that it is likely just seeing their heads
triggered these women to visualize images of these celebrities'
bodies that they had previously been exposed to. This
visualization, in turn, may have caused them to see themselves
as objects to be evaluated by others because their pregnant
bodies differed from their visualization of that thin ideal.
(Hopper & Aubrey, 2013, p. 782)
Among respondents in their third trimester, the most highly
objectifying images lead to more self-objectification as pre-
dicted. The authors speculate that because women earlier in
their pregnancy are often not immediately identified as preg-
nant (but may have gained weight), they may self-objectify
more than women in the third trimester--who are typically
recognized as pregnant. Their study was the only research we
came across that explores the impact of pregnant celebrity
media images on women's self-objectification. Our research
builds on their analysis by using in-depth interviews to
explore mothers' nuanced and detailed reactions to CMB
profiles.
Objectification Theory
Fredrickson and Roberts's (1997) objectification theory
argues that women and girls experience sexual objectification
by internalizing an observer's perspective of their own
bodies. In our culture, the "observer's perspective" separates
women's bodies, or body parts, from the rest of her person-
hood and views women's bodies primarily as objects of male
sexual desire (Bartky, 1990; Bordo, 1993). Bordo (1993)
details how women internalize a male gaze that prioritizes
their physical attractiveness, "practices which train the female
body in docility and obedience to cultural demands" (p. 27).
These practices reduce the importance of women's bodies
outside of their sexual attractiveness to men. More recent
scholarship affirms that in our culture, early socialization
practices and unrealistic media images cause girls and women
to "self-objectify by treating themselves as an object to be
looked at and evaluated on the basis of appearance"
(Szymanski, Moffitt, & Carr, 2011, p. 8). Objectification the-
ory emphasizes the cumulative effect of the objectification of
women's bodies over their life course, a process through
which women internalize the conventional beauty ideals
described above (Fredrickson & Roberts, 1997; Hopper &
Aubrey, 2013). Indeed, women who self-objectify or rou-
tinely experience sexual objectification often feel shameful
about their bodies and engage in restrictive dieting (Noll &
Fredrickson, 1998), display disordered eating (Tiggemann &
Williams, 2012), and have positive attitudes toward plastic
surgery (Calogero, Pina, Park, & Rahemtulla, 2010).
The objectification of pregnant women's bodies is espe-
cially problematic, because pregnancy, birth, and breastfeed-
ing can be among women's most profound bodily experiences
(Rich, 1976). The objectification process thus ignores and
devalues the power of the female body. Objectifying preg-
nant and postpartum women's bodies also shows the extent
to which this process is ubiquitous in our society (Fredrickson
& Roberts, 1997); women's weight is surveilled during preg-
nancy--when women must gain weight to give birth to a
healthy baby, and during the postpartum period--when
women need extra weight if nursing their babies. The objec-
tification and surveillance of mothers' bodies devalues the
power of the maternal body, mothers' work as caregivers,
and mothers' many other contributions to society.
Applied to this study on postpartum bodies, sexual objec-
tification can be seen in magazine images where the pregnant
body is presented for the consumption of others, through a
gazing and inspection of the body (Fredrickson & Roberts,
1997). As this gaze is available for around the clock con-
sumption in our media culture, women internalize the
observer's perspective and self-objectify, or view themselves
as objects for male sexual desire (Fredrickson & Roberts,
1997). Consequently, in this study, we pay particular atten-
tion to how women evaluate their postpartum appearance
when comparing themselves with CMB images and also
when comparing themselves with the imagined standards of
their male partners.
While previous research has explored various objectifica-
tion experiences within a woman's life cycle, such as puberty
(Brownmiller, 1984; Dion, Dion, & Keelan, 1990; K. Martin,
1996) and midlife (Rodeheaver & Stohs, 1991), little research
4 SAGE Open
using objectification theory has explored sexual objectifica-
tion in the postpartum experience. Therefore, a main contri-
bution of this research is to explore to how CMB profiles, as
one example of ubiquitous media narratives that normalize
thinness and conventional standards of beauty, influence
mothers' views of their postpartum bodies.
Intersectionality
Contemporary gender scholarship emphasizes that women's
lived experiences vary considerably by race/ethnicity, social
class, nationality, and sexuality (P. H. Collins, 1990, 2004;
Roberts, 1997). Our society has long targeted the bodies of
women of color for unequal treatment. Patricia Hill Collins
(2004) writes that from slavery onward, "Black women
were objects to be seen, enjoyed, purchased, and used, pri-
marily by White men with money" (p. 31). Because another
article from this study focuses on race in mothers' postpar-
tum narratives, we do not focus on race in this article. A
large body of sociological literature shows that social class
and educational attainment influence women's everyday
lived experiences of both motherhood and body image (Edin
& Kefalas, 2005; B. Fox & Neiterman, 2015); therefore,
here we explore differences in mothers' narratives across
class and education.
Our main research questions include the following:
Research Question 1: In light of CMB narratives, how
do mothers evaluate their bodies vis-à-vis others--includ-
ing celebrities and others in their lives?
Research Question 2: How do mothers' narratives vary
by women's social class and educational backgrounds?
Research Question 3: In light of CMB narratives, how do
mothers interpret men's evaluations of their postpartum
bodies, and how do these interpretations influence moth-
ers' body image and feelings of sexual attractiveness?
Method
During 2013 and 2014, the first author conducted 38 in-depth
interviews with noncelebrity women who had one or more
children. Interviews took place in a moderate-sized metro-
politan area in the upper South of the United States. We
recruited respondents through personal contacts, and more
commonly with flyers and social media advertisements; in
flyers, we described the project as an interview-based study
of mothers' views of their postpartum bodies and media
images of celebrity motherhood. Some respondents were
found utilizing snowball sampling, through which respon-
dents provided names of additional mothers who might par-
ticipate in the study. To ensure a diverse sample, only five
women in the study were found through snowball sampling.
The interviews were conducted in public places chosen by
respondents or in respondents' homes.
After each woman filled out a small set of demographic
questions, interviews were semistructured; the first author
worked from an interview guide but gave women substantial
leeway to discuss the issues most important to them. The first
author began with general questions on media consumption
and went on to ask how respondents felt the men in their
lives viewed their bodies before and after pregnancy. Then,
the first author showed mothers media images of celebrity
motherhood, asking how these made respondents feel about
their own bodies, and how respondents thought the men in
their lives viewed these images. The media images came
from People Magazine, Shape, Us Weekly, Elle, and other
popular magazines. We choose these magazines because
they have high circulation rates (PSA Research, 2016), rou-
tinely feature stories on celebrity mothers, and are featured
in grocery store checkout lines and magazine stands through-
out the country. All of our respondents were familiar with
these magazines. Celebrity mothers on the covers of these
magazines included Jessica Simpson, Beyonce, the
Kardashians, and Demi Moore (from the iconic 1990s cover).
Some respondents focused on the cover of the magazines;
others flipped through the magazines to view more images.
When viewing these images, respondents typically seemed
more engaged and comfortable; they often opened up and
discussed more personal experiences and struggles with their
own body image.
Interviews lasted between 35 and 75 minutes, most about
45 minutes. All interviews were digitally recorded and tran-
scribed, and all respondents were given pseudonyms.
As seen in Table 1, these mothers came from different
racial and socioeconomic backgrounds. We interviewed 23
White women, seven African American women, one
Hispanic woman, two Asian women, and five racially mixed
women Our sample is somewhat representative of the popu-
lation of the metropolitan area in which interviews took
place, though our sample has more mixed race respondents:
The metropolitan area is 77% White, 22% African American,
and less than 5% Hispanic, Asian American, or mixed race
(U.S. Census Bureau, 2016). Our sample is 61% White, 18%
African American, and 13% mixed race, with fewer than 5%
Asian American or Hispanic respondents. Due to space limi-
tations, this article explores how mothers' narratives vary by
social class and education; another article focuses on differ-
ences in women's narratives by race/ethnicity--which were
substantial.
All mothers self-reported they were heterosexual. We
measured income by respondents' self-reports of family
income. Eleven mothers were lower-income and earned less
than US$20,000 annually; 10 were lower-middle income and
earned between US$20,001 and US$45,000; eight were
upper-middle income and earned between US$45,001 and
US$99,999; and nine were upper income, earning
US$100,000 or more per year. Women ranged from ages 19
to 45, with the average age of 31. Respondents had between
one and four children.
Williams et al. 5
Once interviews were complete, we reread transcripts
several times and then coded each interview according to
themes and patterns that emerged from all the interviews
(Heese-Biber & Leavy, 2007). Once general themes were
found, we coded interviews again for more specific themes
related to our research questions (Charmaz, 2006).
Findings
Mothers' Consumption of CMB Profiles
Mothers in this sample consumed between 1 and 8 hours of
popular media, but on average their daily media consump-
tion was around 3.5 hours. Media consumption consisted of
viewing popular magazines, TV, online news sources, and
smartphone apps. Out of these 38 women, 17 women openly
discussed seeking out CMB narratives in the media; they
subscribed to popular magazines such as People, Us Weekly,
Cosmopolitan, or Shape. Most mothers were more reluctant
to admit their consumption. When asked if they ever bought
magazines such as People, Us Weekly, Ok! Magazine, or
Shape, 21 of the mothers denied such purchases. Some
claimed they had no time to follow CMB narratives.
However, later in the interview, each of these 21 women spe-
cifically mentioned stories from magazines, named celebrity
mothers, or described advice they took from particular CMB
narratives. Even though all of these mothers showed they
had some consumption of CMB profiles, these 21 women
seemed to associate these profiles as a kind of "guilty plea-
sure" entertainment and did not want to be viewed as women
who read these magazines.
By the end of the interviews, almost all mothers in the
sample reported being a headline consumer of these maga-
zines (even though most did not buy them). Many revealed
that they consumed more CMB narratives than they had real-
ized. For example, Paige explained that she did not buy into
CMB media and had no time to follow their stories. However,
by the end of the interview, she had mentioned 11 celebrity
mothers and their pregnancy or postpartum weight loss sto-
ries; she said, with embarrassment, "I know so much more
than I thought I did!"
Social Class, CMB Profiles, and Mothers'
Evaluations of Their Postpartum Bodies
Upper-income mothers. Of the women interviewed, nine were
high-income mothers. As seen in Table 1, all of these women
were White. Most of these women were married to influen-
tial men in the community, many of them business leaders.
However, two of these mothers had PhDs and were married
to male PhDs. All nine women graduated from college. As
seen in Table 1, these mothers were the least likely to report
struggling with postpartum weight loss.
Several patterns emerged in the interviews of high-income
mothers: Most believed they could achieve a fit body through
hard work and overlooked the resources associated with their
high incomes. In addition, most had some kind of plastic sur-
gery, and most compared their bodies with women in their
social circle rather than celebrities.
Although many of these women complained about their
bodies in interviews, all but two believed you could have
postpartum success if you were fit before your pregnancy. In
this sense, these mothers were not highly critical of the

images of celebrity postpartum bodies. For example, Angela,
a personal trainer, was very critical of other mothers who
were not physically fit after pregnancy:
I do not think women should use pregnancy as a crutch, like oh,
I had two children. No, you just don't work out or you don't
work hard enough. If you had a flat stomach before kids, you
can again. If you didn't before, then no, it is not going to
happen.
Another mother, Anne, similarly believed a mother's post-
partum body had a lot to do with how fit she was before
pregnancy and with good genes. In contrast, Brooke, a more
critical mother, explained, "I grew up in a single mother
household. I know what it means to work hard and put every-
one before yourself." For Brooke, postpartum success had a
lot to do with her resources and social class. She was aware
of the privilege that comes with a high-income lifestyle--
nannies, personal trainers, and the ability to buy healthy
foods. In contrast, most of the high-income mothers did not
seem aware of how their class privilege influenced their
postpartum bodies.
All nine of the high-income mothers said they compared
themselves with women in their social circle in addition to
celebrity mothers. Several of these women displayed a sense
of hypercompetitiveness among their friends. Miranda, the
first higher-income mother I interviewed, brought this com-
petitiveness to my attention:
For the social circle I am in, there is so much pressure to look
good . . . So I don't even have to pick up a magazine to compare
myself to--I can just compare myself to my friends and the
women at my country club . . . What I am getting at is, I know
these magazines are altered . . . so that is not as intimidating as
when the people you are hanging out with are totally changing
the way they look and flaunting it.
Miranda experienced self-objectification not by evaluating
herself in light of the CMB profiles but instead by measuring
her body against those in her social circle.
One likely outcome of comparing their postpartum bodies
with others in their very high-income social circle was cos-
metic surgery: Seven of the nine high-income mothers had
Botox or cosmetic surgery to alter their bodies. Mothers like
Caroline, Allison, and Brooke were open about having plas-
tic surgery, while Anne was embarrassed to admit having any
work done. Anne whispered, "I had a tummy tuck. My friend
used the same doctor and hers looked great, so I decided to
do it." When I asked why she whispered to me about her
tummy tuck, she replied,
I know . . . and I don't understand why women don't talk about
that more, you know? I mean even among my friends, plastic
surgery is a secret. Weight loss efforts are a secret. Everyone has
the better nanny or the better trainer . . . Sometimes it just makes
me crazy.
Anne suggests that while she compared her body with those
of her friends, the methods they use to attain fit bodies are
largely secretive.
Other mothers were more upfront about using plastic sur-
gery. Brooke said,
I worked my ass off to get in the shape I am. I also paid my
doctor a lot of money to keep me looking this way. It was my
choice, and I am very open about having plastic surgery and
Botox. Most women are not. I see nothing wrong with keeping
myself in shape and looking young.
After asking Brooke about particular CMB narratives, she
replied,
Look, I know that these women are being airbrushed and getting
work done. Myself and my friends all get the same work done. .
. I know that I don't have to look like this in order to make it in
my business, but in order to make it in my lifestyle and social
circle, yes, I have to look a certain way.
Brooke's quotes suggest that high-income mothers may feel
the need to engage in plastic surgery and exercise to meet the
high expectations for beauty within their social networks.
Overall, the higher-income respondents felt immense
pressure to look their best and keep up with friends and pop-
ular celebrity trends. Not all higher-income women evaluate
their bodies on the basis of celebrity mothers; most care
more about how they look compared with mothers in their
social circle. Even if they were critical of the hypercompeti-
tiveness among themselves and their friends, they still felt it
necessary. As suggested by objectification theory, these
women have internalized patriarchal norms about the ideal
female body--as Brooke says, "I have to look a certain way."
The narratives of these high-income women suggest that
economic privilege may exacerbate the pressures of self-
objectification, as these women can afford to go to more
extreme measures (such as plastic surgery) to attain the ide-
alized, thin body after childbirth.
Middle-income mothers.The majority of the women inter-
viewed were lower- to upper-middle-class mothers.Atotal of
18 respondents had family incomes between US$20,001 and
US$99,999. Many of these mothers described consuming
CMB narratives as a guilty pleasure, something moms could
read with little effort or concentration. Of these 18 women,
15 struggled with postpartum weight loss and had negative
thoughts toward their bodies after pregnancy. The main
theme emerging from these narratives was ambivalence:
Middle-income mothers were both critical of and envious of
celebrity mothers who had time to work out and eat
healthfully.
All 18 middle-income women were educated and almost
all were career-oriented; one was a stay-at-home mother.
They had college degrees; many had professional degrees as
Williams et al. 7
well. Their education, or their jobs, often led them to be more
critical of CMB narratives. Kate explained,
I think they (CMB images) are very unrealistic for your average
mom, especially if they have more than one child. You have a
child that only wants chicken nuggets. And you're running to
three different sporting events. I don't have anyone to cook for
me.
Joyce had similar feelings but also those of
jealousy and envy--wanting to be a part of that lifestyle. Seeing
how easy everything is for them. I can barely make it to the gym,
but I feel like all I see these women doing are working out or
playing on the beach. It was always in the back of mind that I
needed to lose the weight . . . But time was always a factor, or
not having any motivation after work.
Joyce seems to buy into the CMB images, even while she
realizes her life is quite different from that of celebrities who
"play on the beach" all the time.
Samantha, a part-time professor and college admissions
counselor, also showed ambivalence toward CMB narratives.
She believed that because of her education, she knew they
were unrealistic and avoided comparing herself with them.
She said, "These women cannot be that perfect. It also makes
me wonder exactly what these women are doing. I think a lot
of them probably do more cosmetically than we think they
do." She admitted that she was interested in what celebrity
mothers do cosmetically, but because of her education, she did
not believe cosmetic surgery was something worth pursuing.
Of these 18 women, three admitted to having plastic sur-
gery. However, 11 middle-income mothers admitted wanting
breast augmentation or tummy tucks. Even those who said
they would not undergo plastic surgery expressed ambiva-
lence. For example, Lauren quickly answered "no," when
asked if she has or would ever have plastic surgery, but later
said,
I really don't like the idea of it because we wouldn't have the
money. But I often fantasize about what a tummy tuck would
look like. It is just a fantasy, to finally have a flat stomach.
While Lauren did not want plastic surgery, she did fantasize
about the results of it. Her ambivalence when shown and
asked about the CMB profiles was also clear:
It makes me feel bad. I wish I could be like well, whatever, I am
not a celebrity. But it is hard not to think . . . I still look somewhat
pregnant seven weeks after the birth of my son. Then I look at
these women in their bikinis holding their newborn babies, and
who doesn't want to be this hot mom? Yeah . . . they make you
feel so crappy. I don't think any of us are immune to it.
Like other middle-income mothers, Lauren was critical of
CMB profiles but still influenced by them.
As suggested by objectification theory, the internalization
of conventional beauty norms is evident in these women's
narratives: Working mothers like Joyce and Lauren, who
have little time or energy for working out, still feel pressure
to be physically attractive. Lauren asks, "Who doesn't want
to be this hot mom?" The CMB profiles encourage these
mothers to discount other important aspects of their lives,
such as jobs or parenting skills, and instead focus on whether
or not their bodies meet conventional (and for the vast major-
ity of mothers, unattainable) standards of beauty and thin-
ness. While several middle-class mothers were openly
critical of the narrow scope of CMB profiles, they had a hard
time resisting the conventional beauty standards located
therein.
Low-income mothers.Eleven respondents were low-income
mothers, earning less than US$20,000 a year. These women
were full-time students, working minimum wage jobs, or
unemployed. All low-income mothers were single mothers
and attributed their inability to regain their pre-baby bodies
to a lack of economic resources.
Low-income mothers were high consumers of CMB pro-
files, some more interested in the pregnancies, others more
focused on postpartum narratives. Like other respondents,
initially these women expressed ambivalence toward CMB
consumption, but once rapport was established, they began
to divulge high consumption. The majority of these women
were headline consumers, not willing to spend money on
popular magazines. However, all of these women admitted to
flipping through these magazines or following CMB narra-
tives on television or online.
Two patterns emerged in lower-income mothers' narra-
tives: First, like the middle-income mothers, they were
somewhat critical of the class privileges that undergird CMB
images, but at the same time, almost all lower-income
respondents said they wanted these kinds of bodies for
themselves.
These mothers described an inability to "afford" the per-
fect bodies in the magazines. These women said that celebri-
ties like Kourtney Kardashian, Jessica Alba, and Jennifer
Lopez were able to obtain a beautifully shaped and toned
body quickly; for example, a young mother, Susan, said,
These celebrity moms put so much pressure on people like me!
Look at Kourtney Kardashian, who has 2 kids now and dropped
the weight successfully in front of the public in a matter of
weeks--it is almost like a slap in the face to normal women.
Lower-income mothers were very aware of the economic
resources of celebrities. One mother, Ashley, said, "If you
have money, this is what you look like. Without money, I do
not think women's bodies are capable of looking like this
immediately after pregnancy." Similarly, Leah claimed that
she did follow celebrity mother's dieting and fitness advice,
but said that they were more successful because, "People
8 SAGE Open
like me, I don't have the time or the money for a personal
trainer. I could diet, but that is hard also when you live a life
financially struggling." Almost all of the low-income moth-
ers referred to themselves as "women like me" or "people
like me," which showed a sense of class difference and
awareness of the privileges women showcased in CMB
narratives.
However, while critical of the class privilege of celebrity
mothers, the low-income mothers in this sample also wanted
these economic privileges for themselves. For example,
Melissa, an African American mother of two, said, "these
celebrity women have the money, they have the means to
achieve the look they want. These are all things I cannot do,
and most women cannot do, because we do not have the
same life." She admitted that she and other women idolized
celebrity mothers.
I know this is the body God blessed me with, but looking at
these [images], I just feel fat. I feel like I need to lose more
weight. They look fantastic . . . and I know they probably had
people helping them look this way, so it is not totally realistic.
She later went on to tell me, "I took advice from celebrity
moms and tried to work out more and just drink water. But
that didn't always work. I was stressed a lot and wanted
chocolate." Melissa expressed a sense of powerlessness over
her own body in regard to postpartum weight loss and CMB
profiles. Like Melissa, several other low-income mothers we
interviewed had internalized feelings of guilt, inadequacy,
and inability to control their own bodies by comparing them-
selves with socially constructed ideals of beauty and
motherhood.
Some respondents attributed their inability to regain their
bodies to a lack of willpower. Even 6 years after giving birth
to her daughter, Paige admitted that she still continues to fol-
low CMB advice:
I have always followed Britney Spears. She would list her daily
food regimen, like salmon, rice, and vegetables. That is not
always realistic for women like me. I am a single mother and
cannot afford all of the fancy and healthy foods all the time.
Rather than to cook a healthy meal that costs 25 dollars with
salmon and grilled chicken, I can take that money and buy food
that will last all week. But it's not healthy, it is not what celebrity
mothers are saying is right, or what mothers like me should be
doing.
Paige indicated that a lack of economic resources prevents
low-income mothers from obtaining good food, exercise pro-
grams, and dietitians. Like Paige, several low-income women
in this study seemed to internalize messages from media
images that ensure a continued otherness.
Like the high-income mothers, almost all lower-income
women admitted to wanting plastic surgery (if they had the
money). For example, Erica said, "I have thought about hav-
ing plastic surgery on my stomach. Maybe in time I will have
the money." Similarly, Candace said, "If I had the money, I
would get a tummy tuck and breast-lift in a heartbeat!"
In sum, the lower-income mothers were often critical of
the class privilege among celebrity mothers, but they also
wanted these economic resources, and celebrity moms' bod-
ies, for themselves. As suggested by objectification theory,
mothers buy into conventional beauty standards and feel
quite badly about their own bodies and lives, even when they
know celebrity mothers have substantial resources unavail-
able to them.
The Male Myth: Mothers' Views of Men's
Reactions to CMB Narratives
In every interview, respondents said they thought the men in
their lives expected a quick return to their prepregnancy bod-
ies. All 38 mothers believed that the men in their lives sub-
scribed to what we began to call the "male myth"--the
assumption that women's bodies spontaneously go back to
their prepregnancy shape following the birth of a child.
Ellen, a bench clerk in family court, described the atti-
tudes many of the women held regarding men:
I think a lot of men expect their wives to look a certain way
during and after pregnancy. I mean even Scott [Disick] tells
Kourtney Kardashian she needs to lose weight, or makes crappy
comments to her about weight gain . . . If it happens in celebrity
lives, it happens 1000 times more in our lives.
Lauren, a mother of two, echoed this mentality when sharing
a story from her motherhood group:
They [the mothers in her group] all complain that they don't feel
like they are in their own body--things are moved around . . .
They all talk about how they don't feel sexy for their husbands
anymore, and feel like their husbands do not want to have sex
with them. I do not know how to explain it, you just really don't
feel comfortable in your own skin for a while. Then you have
these men that want you to look like these famous women. It is
hard to understand men, they say, "no no no, I don't expect you
to look like this," but you know they do . . . you know that's what
they desire.
Lauren then explained,
Media teaches us that to be a good mother and a good wife, you
have to look like you haven't had a child six weeks after giving
birth. Otherwise you have failed at mothering and you have
failed at being sexy for your partner.
This mother clearly believed that celebrity images can make
women feel less sexually attractive to their partners.
Many mothers admitted that their negative body image
was influenced by how their partner viewed their body.
Melissa, a mother of two who struggled with her weight
while caring for her ill parent, claimed,
Williams et al. 9
Men think all women should look like these celebrity mothers. I
think some are okay with the baby weight, but most want you to
drop it immediately. The father of my children did. He didn't
want to be around me because I was so big. He told me I was so
fat all the time. The doctor would explain to him I was retaining
water.
Although she had a medical reason for her weight gain, she
associates his negative image of her body during preg-
nancy with their relationship ending. Similarly, Erica
described her partner's negative reactions: "Since I've
been pregnant, he doesn't show me attention. This hap-
pened during my other pregnancies as well . . . but I keep
putting up with it."
Some mothers revealed partners' severely negative reac-
tions to their postpartum bodies. Kate said,
[He] put me down a lot when I was pregnant . . . every chance he
got. He called me a fat slob. He threw food away and told me I
couldn't eat certain things. I remember crying and asking for ice
cream and he laughed and said I had already gained enough. . .
It took me six years to boost my confidence back up.
Kate admitted on several occasions that she believed his neg-
ative attitude toward her pregnant body was directly related
to CMB profiles; she said,
Six years ago these images devastated me. These celebrities . . .
you see Britney and you're like, oh wow, she is gorgeous and not
huge . . . And then my boyfriend comes home after looking at
these like why are you so fat and they aren't? It puts off a persona
that you stay skinny while pregnant.
Likewise, Kimberly, a mother of three, whose husband
left her for another woman during her last pregnancy,
explained that "some men have complete aversions to preg-
nancy and weight gain. My ex-husband did not like it. He
was like EW! I would do little belly dances to tease him and
he would be disgusted." Samantha explained her view of
men's aversion to pregnancy in more depth:
I think men in general are freaked out by pregnant women.
Women's bodies have been so sexualized . . . I think when the
body changes, it just totally freaks them out. I think some men,
once a woman has a baby--they never see their partner outside
of their maternal role again. The sex is never the same. I think it
is hard for men to separate your role as a mother and your role
as a woman. I think men are harder on women about their weight
also.
Like Lauren above, Samantha emphasizes how the sexual-
ization of women's bodies can make postpartum women feel
sexually unattractive to male partners.
Some women claimed their husbands' criticisms were
healthy criticisms to keep them motivated. Miranda said,
"My husband would tell me to go work out, because he knew
it would make me feel better about myself. But also, I mean
he probably wanted to see the benefits of it." In addition,
Joyce explained that her fiancé
was supportive, and encouraged me to eat healthy. He made me
a meal plan that was helpful. He was nice. He would make
comments that I should start running or get my workout in. But
that didn't hurt my feelings or anything because he was worried
about me and wanted to encourage me.
However, later in her interview, she admitted, "I know when
things get back to normal we will make it official [long
pause] . . . I am working out a lot and getting back into shape.
I know he will get excited for a wedding!" While many of
these men may have wanted to support their partners in
efforts to stay healthy and feel better about themselves,
Joyce's comment implies that a slimmer body may be neces-
sary for their relationship.
In contrast, some women claimed their husbands were
happy or even excited about the changes in their bodies dur-
ing pregnancy. Tiffany explained that her husband enjoyed
seeing her body change during her pregnancy: "He was
always supportive and would encourage me that I was beau-
tiful." Lauren similarly shared that her husband "doesn't pay
much attention to magazines I don't think. I'm sure he com-
pares me sometimes to these women, he is only human. He
tells me he thinks I am beautiful and doesn't expect anything,
but he is progressive." Ellen claimed her husband did not say
anything to her during pregnancy: "He made me feel good.
Like I was pretty. I had a great pregnancy. But he did men-
tion after the pregnancy that he would work out with me."
Thus, a few mothers suggested that men were comfortable
and happy with their partners' pregnant and postpartum
bodies.
Despite these positive experiences with their partners, all
38 women interviewed said that men in general assumed all
women's bodies could resemble those of celebrities in CMB
profiles after pregnancy. Jennifer, a psychology professor,
said,
Most men are under the impression that after the baby, you just
go back to your normal weight. If these women did, you can too.
Eat healthy, work out, it is easy right? Most don't realize that
many of the changes with our bodies are permanent.
While most mothers viewed male reactions to CMB nar-
ratives in a negative light, one woman, Sally, whose husband
died of a rare form of cancer while her daughter was very
young, expressed an alternative:
I have heard men say they think their wives are sexy during
pregnancy but once they have their baby it is like "okay honey!
Time to get back to normal! Time to get back to that sexy body
I married!" It's like buddy . . . I still am the sexy woman you
married . . . I am just trying to raise our new baby. I am still me.
I am still sexual. We can't change the stretch marks, or the new
hips. For most people that doesn't go away. We aren't airbrushed.
10 SAGE Open
Sally suggests that men should come around to the realiza-
tion that the real women are not "airbrushed" and can still
enjoy sex and their bodies.
As objectification theory suggests, when respondents
imagined male reactions to CMB profiles, most viewed their
own postpartum bodies as inferior and felt sexually unat-
tractive. However, a few mothers, Sally in particular, openly
reject the objectification of women and the male gaze in
CMB profiles. But on the whole, these quotes show that most
mothers feel their postpartum bodies are inadequate.
Conclusion
This research finds that everyday mothers typically compare
their bodies negatively with those of celebrity mothers.
Almost all of the women, albeit to varying degrees, shared
the experience of feeling their bodies were inadequate in the
face of CMB narratives. In addition, all 38 mothers thought
men believed a woman's experience of pregnancy and post-
partum body should mimic those of celebrities.
The voices of the 38 women in this sample support objec-
tification theory (Fredrickson & Roberts, 1997): The sexual-
ization and objectification of women's bodies is inescapable
in our culture, even among women who have recently given
birth. The CMB images we showed to mothers reinforce
patriarchal norms about conventional beauty, most notably
the ideal of thinness. Like women in other research, these
mothers felt pressure to "get their body back" (Bordo, 1993;
Dworkin & Wachs, 2004; Wolf, 1991). Although many of the
38 women interviewed seemed acutely aware of how these
images have been stylized and airbrushed, they still viewed
their bodies negatively in light of CMB profiles.
However, our research suggests that mothers evaluated
themselves in different ways depending on their social class
background. Higher-income women framed motherhood in
more competitive terms than other mothers, as the former
were more concerned with living up to the perceived stan-
dards of beauty within their social circles. Douglas and
Michaels (2004) argue that mass media's representation of
motherhood has created an environment of hypercompeti-
tion, guilt, and anxiety for women. Indeed, in this sample,
most high-income women admitted to having plastic surgery
to keep up with other mothers they know. As Douglas and
Michaels suggest, when women compete against each other,
they are unlikely to work together for social change.
While the middle- and low-income mothers did not
express motherhood in competitive terms, most still wanted
the toned bodies shown in the CMB narratives. The lack of
competition in these mothers' accounts could be because
they saw CMB narratives as out of their reach. In contrast,
the higher-income mothers had the resources to attain the
bodies presented in CMB profiles and may have felt more
accountable to them.
Some middle-income mothers said that their education
made them more critical of CMB profiles, and that their
parenting and paid work made it impossible for them to look
like celebrity mothers. Low-income mothers were also criti-
cal of the CMB profiles based on their own life experiences;
some had tried the diets touted by celebrities, but were unable
to afford healthy food, or were unable to keep up with exer-
cise regimens and diets without child care and personal train-
ers. However, unlike most middle-income respondents, most
low-income mothers openly wished for the resources of
celebrity mothers and felt a sense of personal failure when
their bodies did not meet the (unrealistic) standards of CMB
profiles. Thus, our research suggests that college-educated,
middle-income women were the most critical of the images,
with several saying they knew they should not pay attention
to them. Nonetheless, as predicted by objectification theory,
every mother in this sample had to some degree internalized
an ideal of thinness for women's bodies, even soon after
childbirth. As Lauren, one of the most critical, middle-
income mothers, concluded in her discussion of CMB
images, "I don't think any of us are immune to it." This
points to the pervasive effects of early socialization and
media forms in promoting conventional norms of thinness
and beauty--even among women who feel they should
"know better."
Likewise, despite differences across class and education,
all women in this sample believed that CMB profiles had
negative effects on men, and most mothers believed that men
in the lives evaluated their postpartum bodies unfavorably;
many mothers in this study believed that their postpartum
bodies were not "sexy" to the men in their lives. Because we
did not interview the male partners of the mothers, we can
only go by mothers' interpretations of how men in their lives
approached CMB profiles and viewed mothers' bodies.
Further research could explore men's views of CMB pro-
files, and their expectations of postpartum bodies, in more
direct ways. More research on sexual objectification and
mothers' use of plastic surgery is especially needed.
Last, we would argue that this research, and other research
in this vein, can serve as a form of consciousness-raising
among mothers. Many of the women commented on a lack of
dialogue among mothers concerning their expectations for
and experiences of postpartum weight loss. In addition,
higher-income mothers felt pressure to stay fit because they
compared themselves with other women in their social cir-
cle; some, like Angela, chastised women who did not lose
their pregnancy weight, thus surveilling the bodies of other
mothers. If women were more open and honest with each
other about their feelings of guilt and inadequacy in the face
of CMB narratives, this could lead to less competition among
higher-income mothers and more solidarity among lower-
income mothers. More open dialogue could also lead to
fewer women following and purchasing media featuring
unrealistic CMB profiles.
Structural changes are also necessary. Women in this sam-
ple with higher levels of education were generally more criti-
cal of CMB narratives; this suggests that higher education
Williams et al. 11
can help women challenge these pervasive narratives. In
addition, a few online sources, such as "The Shape of a
Mother" website, provide accurate portrayals of postpartum
mothers--with stretch marks, ample bellies, and sagging
breasts. As suggested by Sally, more realistic portrayals
could help affirm and celebrate real women's postpartum
bodies, those that "are not airbrushed." More realistic images
of postpartum bodies could help women feel better about
their postpartum bodies and more sexually attractive to their
male partners.
