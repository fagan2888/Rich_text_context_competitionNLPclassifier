Abstract
Objective: To evaluate retrospectively the relationship between meteorological factors in
Shenmu County, Yulin City, Shaanxi Province, China and the incidence of lower respiratory tract
infections in children.
Methods: Meteorological data (air temperature, atmospheric pressure, rainfall, hours of sunlight,
wind speed and relative humidity) for Shenmu County and medical data from hospitalized patients
aged 16 years were collected between January 2009 and December 2012. The association
between meteorological factors and rate of hospitalization due to lower respiratory tract
infections was investigated; the total hospitalization rate was compared with the rate of lower
respiratory tract disease-related hospitalizations.
Results: The leading bacterial causes of lower respiratory tract infections were Streptococcus
pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae type B; the main viral cause was respiratory syncytial virus.
Lower respiratory tract infection hospitalization rate was significantly correlated with air
temperature (R ¼ À0.651), atmospheric pressure (R ¼ 0.560), rainfall (R ¼ À0.614) and relative
humidity (R ¼ À0.470), but not with hours of sunlight (R ¼ À0.210) or wind speed (R ¼ 0.258).
Using multiple linear regression, lower respiratory tract infection hospitalization rate decreased
with a gradual increase in air temperature (F ¼ 38.30) and relative humidity (F ¼ 15.58).
Conclusion: Air temperature and relative humidity were major influencing meteorological factors
for hospital admissions in children due to lower respiratory tract infections.

Introduction
Seasonal diseases are those that occur or
worsen in close relation to changes in the
weather and the seasons.1 Changes in
meteorological factors mainly affect the
respiratory system and, in particular, are
thought to be substantial causes of induced
bronchial asthma, tracheitis, bronchitis,
pneumonia and other respiratory diseases.2
Meteorological factors are considered to
affect the respiratory system via two mech-
anisms:3 (i) by lowering the resistance of the
human body to infection;4 (ii) by affecting
the ease with which infections spread.
Factors associated with the first mechanism
lower human resistance to infection by
affecting the site of entrance of micro-
organisms or viruses into the body, and
place of settlement and further progression
of disease.5 Factors associated with the
second mechanism affect general disease
resistance of the body, which is determined
by the specific physiochemical state of the
body at a given time, and by weather and
climate-related habits, e.g. crowding into
rooms, shutting windows and doors (redu-
cing ventilation), and modifying clothing
and diet.6,7
The incidence of respiratory tract
infection-based hospitalization is higher
in children compared with adults, particu-
larly in relation to lower respiratory tract
infection.8,9 An improved understanding
of the relationship between meteorological
factors and respiratory tract infections
may facilitate measures to reduce the
incidence of such infections during adverse
meteorological conditions. Thus, the pre-
sent study investigated the association
between meteorological factors and lower
rates of respiratory tract infection in chil-
dren admitted to Shenmu Hospital and
Shenmu Second Hospital (Shenmu
County, Yulin City, Shaanxi Province,
China) between January 2009 and
December 2012.
Patients and methods
Study population and data collection
This retrospective observational study
included medical records from children aged
16 years, admitted to Shenmu Hospital and
Shenmu Second Hospital, and discharged
between January 2009 and December 2012.
Cases with a primary discharge diagnosis of
lower respiratory tract infection (including
pneumonia, bronchiolitis and bronchitis, in
accordance with the International Statistical
Classification of Diseases and Health Related
Problems-10, version 200810) and with no
other associated comorbidity (e.g. obesity,
physical disability, allergic conditions) were
included in the study.11 Respiratory tract
infections were diagnosed according to the
diagnostic standard of Practical Pediatrics,
7th edition.12
Records included chest X-radiographs
obtained according to clinical indication
(which included all children with a suspected
lower respiratory tract infection). All chest
X-radiographs were retrospectively evalu-
ated by an expert radiologist. Sputum cul-
ture data were obtained for cases in which
sputum had been produced.
Hospitalization records for all children
aged 16 years, including those admitted
with respiratory tract infection, were col-
lected each week of the year over the study
period, to represent all seasons and extremes
of meteorological factors. During the cor-
responding time-period, data from daily
monitoring of atmospheric meteorological
factors were collected from Shenmu County
Meteorological Bureau, Shenmu County,
Yulin City, China, including daily mean air
temperature, atmospheric pressure, rainfall,
hours of sunlight, wind speed and relative
humidity. All of the meteorological moni-
toring sites for Shenmu County provided
hourly measurement data of meteorological
factors. Methodology described by the
American Heart Association was used for
Liu et al. 31
data selection and analyses, according to
which measurements were taken at monitor-
ing sites using a HOBOÕ RX3002 weather
station kit (including thermometer, barom-
eter, rain gauge, anemometer and hygrom-
eter [Onset Computer Corporation, Bourne,
MA, USA]).13 All sensors were integrated
into an Onset HOBOÕ RX3002 data logger,
which controlled the sensors and stored the
raw data using HOBOwareÕ Pro software
(Onset Computer Corporation). Hourly mean
values were used to calculate the 24-h mean of
each factor, from which weekly 24-h mean
values were computed. Weekly 24-h mean
value was subtracted from each 24-h value for
that week; each subtracted value was then
squared and the sum of the squares calculated
for each given week. The sum was divided by 6
(7 days of week minus 1) to obtain the
variance and the SD was calculated.
The Shenmu Hospital Institutional
Review Board waived the requirement for
ethical approval, as the study did not dir-
ectly involve patients or clinical samples.
A written request from the authors to collect
inpatient data was approved by the head of
the Paediatrics Department and the execu-
tive director of Shenmu Hospital.
Statistical analyses
Data are presented as n patient incidence
and mean Æ SD for lower respiratory tract
infection hospitalization rate and meteoro-
logical factors (air temperature, atmospheric
pressure, rainfall, hours of sunlight, wind
speed and relative humidity), respectively.
Pearson's correlation coefficient was used to
assess the correlation between meteoro-
logical factors and lower respiratory tract
infection hospitalization rate. Stepwise
multiple linear regression was performed,
with main meteorological factors as inde-
pendent variables, to investigate the regres-
sion relationship between the independent
variables and respiratory tract infection
hospitalization rate. Shapiro­Wilk test was
applied to assess distribution of the popula-
tion. SASÕ software version 9.3 (SAS
Institute, Cary, NC, USA) was used for
the statistical analyses. P-values < 0.05 indi-
cated statistical significance.
Results
Epidemiology and pathophysiology
A total of 19772 children aged 16
years were admitted to the Paediatrics
Departments of Shenmu Hospital and
Shenmu Second Hospital between 1 January
2009 and 31 December 2012. Of these admis-
sions, 4449 (22.5%) were diagnosed with a
lower respiratory tract infection; there were
2980 (67%) male cases.
All patients with a lower respiratory tract
infection exhibited fever (temperature
>38C) and clinical signs such as dyspnoea,
rapid breathing (children aged <2 months,
>60 breaths per min; children aged 2­12
months, >50 breaths per min; children aged
12­59 months, >40 breaths per min; children
aged 5­12 years, >30 breaths per min; chil-
dren aged 12­16 years, >25 breaths per min),
chest in-drawing and other life-endangering
signs (exhaustion, inability to feed, seizures or
vomiting).
In patients diagnosed with a lower
respiratory tract infection, 36% of cases
(1601) were found among those aged 29
days to 12 months, 33.5% of cases (1490)
among those aged 1­4 years and 25% of
cases (1112) among those aged 5­16 years.
The lowest incidence of lower respiratory
tract infection (5.5% [246 cases]) was found
in neonates (aged 28 days).
The leading causative bacteria found in
lower respiratory tract infections were
Streptococcus pneumoniae (confirmed in
756 cases [17%]) and Haemophilus influenzae
type B (400 cases [9%]). The main causative
virus was found to be respiratory syncytial
virus (diagnosed in 667 cases [15%]), followed
32 Journal of International Medical Research 44(1)
by influenza A virus (311 cases [7%]), para-
influenza III (178 cases [4%]) and influenza B
virus (133 cases [3%]). In total, 845 cases
(19%) were of mixed aetiology, and the
pathogen was unidentified in 1159 cases
(26%) of lower respiratory tract infection
(Figure 1).
Overall paediatric hospital admissions
and admissions due to lower respiratory
tract infection according to variations in air
temperature, atmospheric pressure, rainfall,
hours of sunlight, wind speed and humidity
are shown in Table 1.
Correlation between hospitalization rate
and meteorological factors
The total number of hospital admissions in
children aged 16 years diagnosed with a
lower respiratory tract infection was signifi-
cantly correlated with mean values of air
temperature, atmospheric pressure, rainfall
and relative humidity (Table 2). There was
no statistically significant correlation
between mean values of hours of sunlight
and wind speed (Table 2).
Regression analysis
Using Pearson's correlation coefficient, air
temperature, atmospheric pressure, rainfall
and relative humidity were kept as inde-
pendent variables and fitted into a linear
regression model against the number of
lower respiratory tract infection-related hos-
pital admissions. First, the variance inflation
factor was used as a reference value for the
independent variables to comprehend

collinearity. The variance inflation factor for
each independent variable (air temperature,
7.7; atmospheric pressure, 8.9; rainfall, 3.8;
relative humidity, 2.4) was <10, suggesting
that collinearity between the independent
variables had little effect on parameter esti-
mation results.
The stepwise linear regression model
showed that the ratio of lower respiratory
tract infection-related hospital admissions to
total hospital admissions gradually decreased
with the increase in mean air temperature.
The same decline was observed with a rise in
mean relative humidity (test optimization
fitting model, P < 0.001 confirms the statis-
tical significance, while adjusted R2 ¼ 0.545
shows that the regression line fits the
data; Table 3). According to the normal
distribution of residuals, the normality
plot (Shapiro­Wilk test, W ¼ 0.964;
P ¼ 0.121) and the rate of lower respiratory
tract infection-related hospital admissions
(standardized predicted values versus
standardized residuals; Figure 2), the data
tested were from a normally distributed
population.
Discussion
Since the implementation of free healthcare
for all residents of Shenmu County in March
2009, healthcare has become available to
>99% of the total population of Shenmu.14
Shenmu Hospital and Shenmu Second
Hospital serve $80% of the child popula-
tion in Shenmu County. In addition,
Shenmu County Meteorological Bureau
holds comprehensive meteorological records
for Shenmu County from 1997 onwards.15
The present study was able to use these
extensive, representative data to investigate
the relationship between meteorological fac-
tors and the prevalence of respiratory tract
infections in children in Shenmu County.
Respiratory tract infection is a disease
caused by multiple external factors,16,17 one

but air temperature and humidity have the
most substantial impact.20
Meteorological factors affect the respira-
tory system through lowering local resist-
ance of the human body to infection, and by
affecting the general resistance of the body
through influencing the spread of infec-
tions.3,4 Local resistance may be affected in
different ways: (i) the effect of thermal stress
on permeability and capillary resistance of
membranes, whereby resistance increases
following cold stress; (ii) all meteorological
factors affecting the rate of sweating and
evaporation influence the acid coating pro-
duced by the eccrine sweat glands, which
protects the skin against infections. Cold
and low humidity favour spots of low acidity
in skinfolds, resulting in the growth of
micro-organisms and their penetration into
the skin; (iii) low humidity causes removal of
water vapour from the body cells, which in
turn leads to microfissures in the nasal
mucosa during cold weather and in centrally
heated rooms; (iv) cold causes constriction
of peripheral blood vessels and reduces
blood flow, resulting in drying and cracking
of nasal mucosa; it also depresses ciliary
movements in the respiratory tract, thus
increasing vulnerability to infections.4
Factors that affect general resistance of
the body through influence on spread of
infections include: (i) the impact of weather
and climate on social habits, such as crowd-
ing in rooms, shutting windows and doors
(i.e. reducing ventilation), and changing
clothing and diet;3 (ii) the influence on the
survival of micro-organisms and viruses; (iii)
the effect of meteorological factors on
spread of infectious agents through the
atmosphere. For example, Gram-positive
bacteria and influenza viruses have
been shown to die more quickly with high
humidity and air movement.3,21 Studies of

City, Shaanxi Province, China).
Liu et al. 37
school-age children mostly confined within
classrooms have found that the degree of air
circulation in the classrooms greatly affects
the incidence of respiratory disease.22 Thus,
low humidity and reduced air movement in
winter appears to favour the development of
infectious respiratory diseases.
Studies have suggested that air tempera-
ture has the most notable influence on the
incidence of respiratory tract infections;
however, different views exist regarding
this relationship. Some scholars believe
that air temperature and respiratory tract
infection rate are negatively correlated,23
while some scientists report a positive cor-
relation between them.24
A study into the correlation between
climatic factors, including humidity, and
clinical illnesses found that upper and
lower respiratory tract infections were nega-
tively correlated with relative humidity.25
These data concur with the present study,
which found an increased incidence of lower
respiratory tract infection with decreased
humidity, resulting in increased numbers of
paediatric hospital admissions.
Incidence of acute respiratory tract infec-
tion is reported to be correlated with
crowding; exposure to crowded conditions
has led to an increased risk of acute respira-
tory tract infection.26 During winter in
Shenmu the temperature falls to around
À20C to À25C, which means the children
are confined indoors either at home or in
classrooms and outdoor activities are mark-
edly reduced. This may make it easier for
infection to spread, leading to high numbers
of hospital admissions during winter.
The spread of viruses is thought to be
directly related to human mobility through
transportation.27 The fact that human travel
is a cause of infection spread confirms that
infected humans are a source of pathogens.
Thus, human confinement to a specific area
due to travel-hindering weather conditions
can lead to increased disease incidence in
that area. The confinement indoors of the
children of Shenmu during winter may thus
be the cause of increased incidence of lower
respiratory tract infections in the county.
The influenza virus has been shown to
transmit through the air most readily in
cold, dry conditions, whereas higher tem-
peratures of $30C tend to block aerosol
transmission.21 Viruses with lipid envelopes
generally tend to survive longer at lower
(20­30%) humidity. This applies to most
lipid-enveloped respiratory viruses, includ-
ing influenza. Minimal survival for both
lipid-enveloped and nonlipid-enveloped
viruses occurs at an intermediate relative
humidity of 50 ­ 70%.21 The present study
also demonstrated a high incidence of the
lipid-enveloped respiratory syncytial virus
followed by influenza A virus.
Gram-positive cocci are most prevalent in
indoor and outdoor air, followed by
Gram-positive rods (e.g. Bacillus and
Actinomycetes species), Gram-negative
rods and, lastly, Gram-negative cocci. For
some airborne Gram-positive bacteria
(Staphylococcus albus, Streptococcus haemo-
lyticus, Bacillus subtilis and S. pneumoniae
[type 1]), death rates are lower at lower
relative humidity levels.28 In the present
study, the primary causative bacteria for
lower respiratory tract infection in children
aged 16 years were S. pneumoniae and H.
influenzae type B.
Studies on aerosolized Mycoplasma spe-
cies have shown that survival is optimal at
low (<25%) and high (>80%) relative
humidity, and worst between these two
extremes; this reveals that mycoplasma sur-
vives well at lower humidity.28 There is a
strong association between ventilation and
control of airflow direction in buildings and
transmission and spread of infectious dis-
eases. Reduced ventilation and crowding
may contribute to the observed excess of
lower respiratory tract infections among
young children.29 The present study also
suggests an association between reduced
ventilation and crowding and lower

respiratory tract infections among young
children, as a large number of children
affected were of kindergarten age (1­4
years; 1490 cases [33.5%]) and others were
of school age (5­16 years; 1112 cases [25%]).
In the present study, mean values of lower
respiratory tract infection-related hospital
admissions and meteorological factors were
calculated per week, annually. Following
Pearson's correlation coefficient analysis of
meteorological factors, the multivariate
linear regression model was fitted. The multi-
variate linear regression model, multicolli-
nearity of the independent variables, residual
normality and homogeneity of variance
observed in the present study support the
reliability of the results.
The present study found that the rate of
lower respiratory tract infection-related hos-
pital admissions was significantly correlated
with air temperature, atmospheric pressure,
rainfall and relative humidity, but was not
statistically correlated with sunlight inten-
sity and wind speed. In addition, the rate of
lower respiratory tract infection-related hos-
pital admissions was found to decrease with
gradual increase in temperature and relative
humidity. This information is essential from
a public health perspective when planning
appropriate cold risk-management strate-
gies. Information regarding the trends and
seasonality of respiratory viral infections in
the community is a first step in enabling
healthcare providers to implement strategies
to prevent and minimize infection, and to
apply early therapeutic options to high-risk
patients. A limitation of this study is that the
sample size and power were not pre-
determined.
In conclusion, the results obtained in the
present study show that seasonal variations
in meteorological factors are correlated with
rates of respiratory tract infection-related
hospital admissions in children. To the best
of the authors' knowledge, this is the first
published report showing seasonal patterns
of respiratory infections in Shenmu County.
The results demonstrate the importance of
epidemiological surveillance of respiratory
infections in all regions of China, and sug-
gest that future studies are necessary to
correlate clinical aspects with climatic
variations.
