Introduction
Cancer being the second main cause of deaths in the world,
research over the past decade has been aiming to improve
the current strategies of chemotherapy for better outcomes.1
Consistent epidemiological studies have shown that con-
sumption of bioactive compounds isolated from grains,
fruits, and vegetables strongly reduced the incidence and
risk of several chronic diseases, including cancer.2-4 Thus,
owing to the enhanced health benefits of nutraceuticals (use
of chemicals from food as medicine) several studies have
been carried out for their effective application in chemopre-
vention.5,6 In addition, conventional chemotherapy induced
drug resistance and disease relapse in several cases, includ-
ing breast, lung, liver, colon and prostate cancers 7-9
With increasing evidences on the cytotoxic potential of
plant-derived compounds and continuous efforts to improve
patient survival, combination therapy is expected to provide
effective inhibition of carcinogenesis, with limited side
effects.10-12
Anthocyanins are one of several phytochemicals that
are being extensively studied for beneficial effects during

Abstract
Hypothesis. Anthocyanins possess well-known biological effects and suppress DNA damage induced by therapeutic
topoisomerase poisons. Our study focusses on the modulatory effects of anthocyanidins--malvidin (MAL) and pelargonidin
(PEL)--on topoisomerase II poison mitoxantrone (MXT)-induced cytotoxicity and genotoxicity in in vitro and in vivo
conditions. Study design. HepG2 cells were treated with MXT (1-10 µM), MAL (10-100 µM,) and PEL (5-640 µM) to
determine cell viability. Further, experiments on cytotoxicity and apoptosis induction by single agents or combinations
were performed. In vitro and in vivo antigenotoxic effect of MAL/PEL against MXT was evaluated in human lymphocytes
and mouse bone marrow cells. Methods. Cytotoxicity of test agents and apoptosis induction in HepG2 cells was assessed
by MTT assay, trypan blue dye exclusion assay and Hoechst 33258 staining. Antigenotoxic effects of MAL/PEL against
MXT were assessed in co-treated human lymphocytes and bone marrow from mice that received MXT intraperitoneally
30 minutes post MAL/PEL oral administration Results. Dose-dependent cytotoxicity was observed with all 3 test agents
in HepG2 cells. Highest test concentration of 100 µM MAL, 640 µM PEL, and 10 µM MXT decreased HepG2 cell viability
by 80%, 30%, and 90%, respectively. The combination of 1 µM MXT + 80 µM MAL reduced cell viability better than
single agents. MAL/PEL treatment significantly reduced MXT-induced genotoxicity in human lymphocytes and micronuclei
formation in mice. Conclusion. Combination of MAL/PEL with lower doses of MXT, especially MAL+MXT increases the
cytotoxicity in cancer cells. In addition, MXT treatment with MAL/PEL reduced MXT-induced genotoxicity and protected
normal cells during chemotherapy.

combination therapy.13-15 Anthocyanins are the most abundant
flavonoid compounds that confer bright colors to fruits and
vegetables and possess antioxidant and anti-inflammatory
properties.16,17 Of the 6 common anthocyanidins found in
higher plants, the present study focuses on the analysis of che-
mopreventive activity of malvidin (MAL) and pelargonidin
(PEL) either alone or in combination with mitoxantrone (MXT)
in cancer cells and their protective effect against MXT-induced
genotoxicity in normal cells. MAL, abundantly present in ber-
ries and occurring attached to a sugar moiety, is responsible for
the blue-red color and has been proved to have antioxidant,
antidiabetic, and anti-inflammatory activities.18,19 PELis the red
color­producing anthocyanidin found in fruits especially
pomegranate and is known to possess estrogenic activity.20
Topoisomerase inhibitors form a major class of antineo-
plastic agents consistently used in the therapy regimens of
various cancers.21 MXT is a topoisomerase II­targeting
anthracenedione that efficiently works against acute leuke-
mia, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, breast, liver, lung, pros-
tate, and bladder cancer.22 Although MXT has been known
to produce considerably fewer side effects, such as cardio-
toxicity than doxorubicin,23 drug resistance is a major
drawback observed in treated cases.24 In addition, the high-
dose regimen induces genetic damage in cells, which might
be a cause for secondary cancers.25 Studies have also
shown selective antiproliferative potential of anthocyanins
against cancer cells compared to normal cells, where nor-
mal cells are minimally or completely unaffected.26,27
Thus, coadministration of anthocyanins, especially MAL
or PEL with MXT, might be an effective strategy to reduce
genotoxicity in normal cells and enhance antitumor effi-
cacy as a combination therapy providing a low-dose, mul-
titargeted approach with high antineoplastic efficacy,
warranting better outcome with minimal side effects.28,29
The results of the present study showed that MAL with
low doses of MXT, than PEL in combination or as single-
agent treatment, efficiently killed hepatocellular carcinoma
cells and also that MAL/PEL+ low doses of MXT potentially
reduced MXT-induced in vitro and in vivo genotoxicity.
Materials and Methods
Chemicals and Drugs
The phytochemicals malvidin chloride (CAS no. 643-84-5),
pelargonidin chloride (CAS no. 134-04-3; purity 95%)
and chemotherapeutic drug mitoxantrone dihydrochloride
(CAS no. 90476-82-3; purity 97%) were obtained from
Sigma-Aldrich, Germany. All other chemicals used in the
study were of analytical grade.
Cell Line
Human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line, HepG2 was pro-
cured from National Centre for Cell Sciences, Pune, India
and cultured in DMEM (Himedia, India) containing 10%
heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Gibco, USA), 100
units/mL penicillin G, 100 mg/mL streptomycin (Himedia,
India), 2 mM glutamine (Gibco, USA), 25 mM HEPES, and
2 mM sodium bicarbonate at a cell density of 1 to 3 × 106
cells/mL. Cells growing in the exponential phase were har-
vested at 80% to 90% confluency and subsequently used for
experiments under standard conditions (37°C in 5% CO2
with 95% humidity) in an Eppendorf­New Brunswick
Galaxy CO2
incubator. Cells were grown up to 3 passages
before the treatments.
Animals
All the experiments were carried out with male Swiss albino
mice, which were 12 to 14 weeks old, weighing 30 to 36 g.
These animals were bred in the university animal house and
maintained at 25°C ± 2°C on the standard mouse diet and
water ad libitum in accordance with guidelines from
Committee for the Purpose of Control and Supervision of
Experiments on Animals (CPCSEA). Approval for this
work was obtained from the university animal ethical com-
mittee (IAEC-JNU 5/2011).
Preliminary Analysis of in Vitro Cytotoxic Activity
The dose- and time-dependent cytotoxic activity of MAL,
PEL, and MXT in experimental cells was measured using
the MTT assay. Briefly, HepG2 cells were plated at a den-
sity of 1 × 104 cells/well on a 96-well plate with 100 µL
medium/well. Following 24 hours of incubation and
attachment, the cells were treated with MAL (10-100 µM),
PEL (5-640 µM), and MXT (1-10 µM). After different
treatment periods, cell viability was analyzed by MTT
assay to compare the ability of metabolically active cells
to reduce tetrazolium salt to colored formazan compounds.
MTT (Sigma, MO) at a final concentration of 5 mg/mL
was added to each well and incubated for 4 hours at 37°C
in 5% CO2
. After 4 hours, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)
was added to each well to solubilize formed formazan.
Optical density was measured at 570 nm with 650 nm as
reference filter using an iMark microtitre plate reader
(BioRad, USA). All the experiments were performed in
triplicate.
Cotreatment and Trypan Blue Dye Exclusion
Assay
For evaluating the combinatorial effect of experimental
compounds in inducing cytotoxicity, cancer cells were
treated with anthocyanins and chemotherapeutic drug as
single agents or in combinations of low and high concen-
trations for a period of 24 hours, and cell viability was
assessed using trypan blue dye exclusion assay. 0.4% try-
pan blue was added to the treated cells. After 5 minutes,
Dhivya et al 527
cells were loaded into a hematocytometer and counted
based on dye uptake. Cells with damaged membrane
appeared blue because of the accumulation of dye and
were counted as dead. Live cells maintained cell mem-
brane integrity and did not take up the dye. The number of
viable cells was calculated as a percentage of the total cell
population.
Morphological Assessment by Phase Contrast
Microscopy
Exponentially growing cells were seeded on 24-well
plates at a density of 5 × 104 cells/mL/well. After 24
hours, the cells were treated with specified concentra-
tions of anthocyanins and chemotherapeutic drug as sin-
gle agents and combinations. At the end of the
experimental period, digital photographs were taken
visualizing the treated cells under a phase contrast
inverted microscope (TS100-F, Nikon, Japan) to assess
their morphology.
Detection of Apoptosis by Hoechst 33258
Staining
The ability and extent of apoptosis induction by experimen-
tal compounds as single agents and combinations was
assessed by staining cells with Hoechst 33258. Briefly, after
the experimental period, cells were trypsinized and washed
twice with PBS (phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4); 100 µL
of cell suspension was stained with Hoechst 33258 (10 µg/
mL) for 20 minutes, and the characteristic apoptotic mor-
phological changes, chromatin condensation, and fragmen-
tation were observed under a fluorescent microscope
(Eclipse 80i, Nikon, Japan).
Human Peripheral Blood Lymphocyte
Culture
To determine the protective effect of the anthocyanins
against MXT-induced genomic instability in non-tumori-
genic cells, human peripheral blood lymphocytes were cul-
tured and treated with specific concentrations of
experimental drugs as mentioned above. Briefly, blood
samples were collected in heparin-coated tubes from
healthy donors. Lymphocytes were isolated from the blood
using Histopaque (Sigma) and were cultured in a humidi-
fied incubator (37°C, 5% CO2
) in RPMI-1640 supple-
mented with 20% FBS, 200 mM l-glutamine, penicillin
(100 U/mL), and streptomycin (100 µg/mL), as previously
described.30 Then, 0.2 mL of phytohemagglutinin M
(Himedia, India) was added to induce cell division. Ethical
approval for using human blood samples was obtained from
the Institutional Ethical Committee for Human Research
(DM/2014/101/45).
Mitotic Index (MI) and Chromosomal Aberration
(CA) Assay
To determine the MI, after incubation for a specific period
with experimental drugs, the cultured lymphocytes were
centrifuged at 300g for 15 minutes, washed with ice cold
PBS (pH 7.4), and resuspended in 6 mL of prewarmed hypo-
tonic solution (0.075 M KCl) and kept at 37°C for 10 to 15
minutes. Cells were then centrifuged and fixed in Carnoy's
fixative (methanol:acetic acid, 3:1). The slides were pre-
pared and stained with 4% Giemsa for 8 to 10 minutes. The
frequency of mitotic cells per culture condition was deter-
mined by tallying the number of mitotic cells out of a popu-
lation of 1000 consecutive cells, ignoring broken cells,
clumped cells, and cellular debris. For the analysis of CA
induced, the experimental cells were treated with colchicine
and then harvested and fixed as mentioned above. Slides
were prepared by dropping 3 to 5 drops of the fixed cell sus-
pension on a clean slide and air dried. The slides were stained
with Giemsa. For each treatment, 100 well-spread meta-
phases were analyzed to detect the presence of CAs.
Treatment of Mice With Anthocyanidins and
MXT
MAL (1 or 2 mg/kg b.w.) and PEL (5 or 10 mg/kg b.w) were
dissolved in double-distilled water and administered to
mice by gavage (10 mL/kg b.w.). MXT (6 mg/kg b.w) was
dissolved in distilled water and injected intraperitoneally
(10 mL/kg b.w.), 30 minutes after the administration of
MAL/PEL. The control animals received the same volume
of distilled water. Depending on the body weight (b.w.) of
the animals, volume administered varied, so as to match the
doses. The doses of anthocyanins for in vivo studies were
chosen as described previously.31
Bone Marrow Micronucleus Test
After treatment with specific concentrations of MAL, PEL,
and MXT, mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation;
bone marrow cells from the femur were collected in tubes
containing FBS, and genotoxic effects were evaluated by
the mouse bone marrow micronucleus test according to
Schmid.32 The dose for in vivo analysis was fixed based on
the in vitro results and previous literature. Slides were pre-
pared and stained with May-Grünwald and Giemsa stain. A
total of 2000 polychromatic erythrocytes (PCEs) were
scored per animal per slide to determine the frequency of
micronucleated PCEs (MnPCEs).

Statistical Analysis
The results are presented as mean ± SD of replicate analy-
ses of independent experiments. Statistical analyses were
carried out using ANOVA by GraphPad Ver 5.03 statistical
software and Microsoft Excel. Differences at P < .05 or less
were considered statistically significant.
Results
Dose and Time Determination for Combination
Treatment
The experimental cells were treated with different doses of
MAL, PEL, and MXT to determine the ideal concentration
that could produce cytotoxicity in HepG2 cells. Our results
show that there was a prominent dose-dependent decrease
in cell viability when treated with MAL for 24 hours. Figure
1A shows that approximately 60% and 80% cytotoxicity
was induced at concentrations of 40 and 100 µM (highest
dose used for the study) of MAL, respectively. PEL induced
only 30% cytotoxicity even at the maximum concentration
of 640 µM (Figure 1B) used in the study for all 3 time peri-
ods (24, 48, and 72 hours). The chemotherapeutic drug
MXT produced a dose-dependent decrease in cell viability.
Approximately, 50% cytotoxicity was induced at 2 µM, and
almost 90% cell killing was observed at the highest dose of
MXT used for the study (10 µM). There was no significant
time-dependent difference in the cytotoxicity (Figure 1C).
Based on our observation, the doses for further investiga-
tion into the combinatorial cytotoxic effect of MAL+MXT
and PEL+MXT, and antigenotoxic effects of MAL and PEL
against MXT-induced genotoxicity in experimental cells
were chosen to be 40, 80, and 1 µM for MAL, PEL, and
MXT respectively for a time period of 24 hours.
Combinatorial Effect of MAL, PEL, and MXT on
HepG2 Cytotoxicity and Apoptosis Induction
After cotreatment with combinations of MAL, PEL, and
MXT, the ratio of viable cells was analyzed. All treated
cells had significant decrease in cell count when compared
with untreated control cells. We observed that 1 µM MXT +
40 µM MAL and 1 µM MXT + 80 µM MAL reduced cell
viability by 70% and 80%, respectively, whereas only 40%
to 60% cell death was induced when they were used as sin-
gle agents (Figure 2). The cotreatment of MXT+PEL did
not produce significant cytotoxicity when compared with
MXT alone or MXT+MAL (data not shown). Our results of
cotreatment show that 1 µM MXT was sufficient enough to
induce around 70% to 80% cytotoxicity when combined

with MAL, whereas twice the concentration of MXT (2
µM) was able to induce only ~50% cell death when used
alone. There was no statistically significant increase in
cytotoxicity when the cotreatment groups were compared.
Morphological assessment of treated cells by phase con-
trast microscopy showed that control cells formed a com-
plete monolayer with robust epithelial morphology (Figure
3A), whereas treated cells exhibited cell shrinkage and
detachment of cells from the monolayer, indicating the
occurrence of apoptosis (Figures 3B-3G).
The changes in the nuclear morphology to determine the
extent of apoptosis induction in the experimental cells as
evidenced by Hoechst 33258 staining showed that the con-
trol cells had intact nuclei (Figure 4A), whereas all the
treated cells had nuclear changes with varying degrees of
apoptotic features (Figures 4B-4G). Apoptosis induction is
characterized by chromatin condensation, fragmentation of
nuclear material, membrane blebbing, and formation of
apoptotic bodies. We found that there was no significant
difference in the number of apoptotic cells within the
cotreated cells. However, cells treated with 1 µM MTX+40
µM MAL and 1 µM MTX+80 µM MAL had increased fluo-
rescence (Figures 4F and 4G) when compared with cells
treated with single agents, showing increased chromatin
condensation marking severe apoptosis induction.
Effect of Cotreatment on Normal Cells
To analyze the genoprotective nature of MAL and PEL
against MXT in normal cells, human peripheral blood
lymphocytes were treated with the same doses and com-
binations of MAL, PEL, and MXT as HepG2 cells.
Figures 5A and 6A show the MIs of treated lymphocytes.
We observed that 2 µM MXT greatly reduced the dou-
bling potential of cells when compared with untreated
control cells, and cells treated with 1 µM MXT had ~25%
to 30% MI. Cotreatment with MXT+MAL reduced the MI
of cells similar to MXT alone, whereas it was compara-
tively higher in cells treated with MAL alone (Figure 5A).
MXT+PEL treatment showed a higher MI than MXT
treatment alone (Figure 6A). PEL treatment as a single
agent did not show any change when compared with the
control.
The protective effect of cotreatment at the chromosomal
level was analyzed by calculating the number of abnormal
metaphases and total number of CAs, such as breaks, gaps,
and dicentrics. Analysis of single-agent treatment showed
that 2 µM MXT and 1 µM MXT produced ~48% and 39%
cells with CA, respectively, whereas the number of cells
with CA after MAL or PEL treatment was not significant.
Cotreatment of MXT with MAL/PEL greatly reduced the
number of cells with CA to half the percentage when treated
with MXT alone (Figures 5B and 6B). Also, 1 µM MXT+40
µM MAL, 1 µM MXT+80 µM MAL, 1 µM MXT+40 µM
PEL, and 1 µM MXT+80 µM PEL reduced the incidence to
25%, 32%, 16%, and 20%, respectively.
In Vivo Genoprotective Activity
Analysis of the protective effect of MAL and PEL against
MXT-induced genotoxicity was evaluated by micronuclei
assay. It was observed that there was a significant dose-
dependent increase in percentage of MnPCEs in all MXT-
treated animals when compared with control (Figure 7). As
concentrations of MXT (2-8 mg/kg b.w. ) used for the study
had a significant impact on the genome integrity, 6 mg/kg
b.w. was chosen for further analysis during combination
studies. The frequency of MnPCEs was found to be maxi-
mum in MXT-alone treated animals, whereas there was a
statistically insignificant incidence at the higher doses of
MAL (2 mg/kg b.w.) and PEL (10 mg/kg b.w.) treatments
used in the study when compared with the control. A dose-
dependent reduction in the level of genotoxicity was
observed in the combined treatment. MXT (6 mg/kg b.w.)
with PEL (5 mg/kg b.w.), and PEL (10 mg/kg b.wt) treat-
ment reduced the frequency of MnPCEs to ~40% and
45.5%, respectively, when compared with the control
(Figure 8). There was no significant variation between the
combined treatment animals. MXT+MAL (1 mg/kg b.w.)
treatment reduced the MnPCE incidence to ~38% when
compared with MXT-treated animals (Figure 9). Thus, our
results show that minimal doses of MAL (1 and 2 mg/kg
b.w.) greatly reduced drug-induced genotoxicity when com-
pared with minimal dose of PEL (5 mg/kg b.w.).

Discussion
Anthocyanins have been widely studied in recent times
because they are expected to be more than just plant colors
because of their unravalled medicinal properties. Among
the anthocyanins, MAL and PEL have been proved to pos-
sess chemopreventive potential in several reports. However,
their potential cytotoxic and genoprotective activities when
given in combination with standard drugs are yet to be elu-
cidated. In the current study, MAL produced significant
death of experimental cells, whereas PEL was not cytotoxic.
Similar results have been obtained in our previous study
involving HL-6033 and several other studies on cell lines
such as MCF-7, AGS, and HCT-116.15 The variation in the

cytotoxic effect might be attributed to the change in the
functional groups, and the low sensitivity of HepG2 cells to
PEL can also be a result of their selective responsiveness to
the estrogenic activity of PEL.34 MXT induced cell death at
all 3 time points in the experimental cells at doses similar to
that in previous reports.35,36 Identification and analysis of
compounds that produce effective cell killing at minimal
doses is essential to prevent the deleterious side effects.
From the preliminary cytotoxicity assessment, the doses of
anthocyanins to be used for further studies were chosen as
40 µM for MAL and 80 µM for PEL for combination treat-
ment with MXT.
Combination therapy has been gaining more importance
because of its benefits such as limited side effects, decreased
chemoresistance, and improved toxicity to cancer cells;
anthocyanins have also been shown to have anticancer
activity as single agents,37 targeting several mechanisms
such as reactive oxygen species generation

(ROS), activation of inflammatory mediators, induction of
apoptotic proteins, and inhibition of matrix metalloprote-
ases. However, this work serves as a pilot study for the use
of MAL and PEL in combination with MXT to enhance the
cytotoxicity in HepG2. The dose of MXT needed for effec-
tive killing of cancer cells in combination was reduced to
50% of the required concentration when administered as a
single agent. This reduction in dose may be attributed to the
synergistic or additive effect of MAL and PEL when coad-
ministered with MXT. Similar synergistic activities have
been observed in several other phytochemicals when given
as combinations of epicatechin, tea polyphenols, curcumin,
and other flavonoids.38,39 The reduction in the dose of MXT
used might prevent acquired drug resistance induced during
high-dose administration.40,41
The results of the study also show successful activation
of apoptosis in the experimental cells subjected to combi-
nation treatment, as evidenced by Hoechst staining.
Studies have shown that extracts rich in anthocyanins such
as blueberry extract and red wine inhibited the growth of
several cell lines by the activation of apoptosis, specifi-
cally modulating the expression levels of Bax/Bcl-2, cas-
pases, ERK, mitochondrial membrane potential along
with increased ROS generation.18,42-44 However, elucida-
tion of the exact mechanism that is responsible for cancer
cell toxicity during cotreatment of MAL or PEL with MXT
is necessary to understand the alteration in the cellular
physiology and assessment of any deleterious effects that
might be produced.
The ROS thus, expected to be generated by combination
treatment might interact with the macromolecules of sur-
rounding normal cells and in turn induce genotoxicity with
subsequent alterations in cell cycle and development of sec-
ondary cancers. Huber etal45 have shown that DNAdamage
induced in the cells of the microenvironment in prostate
cancer might lead to secondary cancers. In addition, MXT

treatment led to the development of myelodysplastic syn-
drome characterized by deregulation of apoptosis, dysplas-
tic features in hematopoietic precursors, and peripheral
blood cytopenias that increased risk for transformation to
acute leukemia.46 Analysis of the effect of combination
therapy on normal cells in in vitro conditions has shown
that there is no significant increase in the MI of cells
between MXT alone and in combination treatment with
MAL, whereas there is a very distinct reduction in the inci-
dence of CAs in MAL+MXT treatment. PEL+MXT treat-
ment in cells showed a slight increase in the MI and lower
genoprotective effect when compared with MAL+MXT,
proving that MAL cotreatment with MXT gives an additive
effect in inducing chemopreventive and genoprotective
function relative to single agents. Circulating tumor cells
generally exhibited a biologically aggressive cancer pheno-
type, accompanied by selective resistance to chemother-
apy.47 The introduction of combination therapy involving
MXT + anthocyanidins can effectively reduce the aggres-
siveness of cancer and its progression.
The in vivo assessment of combination treatment of
PEL/MAL with MXT also showed that the anthocyanidins
under study greatly reduced the frequency of micronucle-
ated cells, thereby reducing the chances of therapy-induced
cancer development and drug resistance. The reduction in
genotoxicity after MAL/PEL treatment was similar to that
of the effect observed in our previous study on combinato-
rial treatments of anthocyanidins with cyclophosphamide.31
This study thus confirms the genoprotective activity of spe-
cific anthocyanins MAL and PEL that could be effectively
used to enhance the existing methods of chemotherapy,
especially combination treatment with topoisomerase
inhibitors for improved patient survival.
Conclusion
It is well known that anthocyanins have the potential to nor-
malize several physiological activities in disease condi-
tions. However, lack of knowledge on synergistic
interactions, predictable combinations, and their clinical
outcomes prevent the use of these plant-derived compounds
in therapy regimens. The present study thus proposes the
primary idea of utilizing a combination of anthocyanins and
chemotherapeutic drugs, especially MAL/PEL+MXT,
which ensures cancer cell killing along with the protection
of genome integrity in normal cells. Our study has focused
on the application of specific anthocyanins in combination
with specific chemotherapeutic drugs. However, further
analysis on the molecular mechanisms orchestrated during
such combination treatments might help in the development
and analysis of several other combinations of phytochemi-
cals with conventional therapeutic agents and enhance cur-
rent therapy strategies, minimizing or nullifying the side
effects, if any.
