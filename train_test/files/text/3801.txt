The Design of Urban Plazas: What Is
the Role of Aesthetics?
Public space is essential for the well-being of communities
and societies. Parks, plazas, squares, and other urban open
spaces provide a vital connection with nature and can posi-
tively affect quality of life (Marcus & Francis, 1998). In
urban environments, public spaces such as plazas can serve
as successful social spaces and can function as a focus for
different activities. The physical characteristics of plazas,
which can vary enormously, generally include an urban
space confined in terms of space and size, centrally located,
and laid out in such a way as to allow for a multiplicity of
uses (Woolley, 2003). Generally, in the academic and design
term, plaza means a designed urban open space, and the
exclusion of cars makes them ideal as places for a range of
activities such as strolling, relaxing, sitting, and socializing
(Marcus & Francis, 1998). In terms of the design of urban
plazas, an increasing number of scholarly works focus on
their physical characteristics and visual qualities, and how
these may influence human response and behavior. These
characteristics and qualities include architectural elements,
landscape design, and morphology, plus features relating to
security, management, and other ambient characteristics of
the environment (Loukaitou-Sideris & Banerjee, 1993;
Loukaitou-Sideris & Ehrenfeucht, 2009; Mehta, 2009).
While the literature identifies the visual and aesthetic
dimensions of an urban plaza as characteristics that enhance
qualities of public space, a gap exists concerning the precise
nature of the aesthetic characteristics of the architectural ele-
ments that enhance the interface between the environment
and human responses. This article explores the architectural
and visual characteristics of urban plazas as public spaces
specifically in relation to aesthetic responses. Outcomes
from this study can be used to further explore the aesthetic
attributes of urban plazas and designed urban open spaces.
The interface between urban plazas, human response, and
behavior is clearly multidimensional; that is, a range of
visual, morphological, and aesthetic qualities are essential to
creating a successful public space. The traditional definition
of aesthetics often refers to perceptions of beauty in the arts
and implies intense feelings that are sublime (Lang, 2005,
2007). Lang (2005) defines the visual aesthetic dimension of
the urban environment as one of the essential criteria for the
environmental evaluation of urban space. Intuitive capacity
for aesthetic appreciation is influenced by four distinct
components that transcend time and culture. These are sense

Examining the Relationship Between Key
Visual Characteristics of Urban Plazas and
Aesthetic Response
Farhana Ferdous1
Abstract
Urban plazas as public spaces occur in every town and city around the world; however, some plazas are more user-friendly
and successful than others. This study examined that "aesthetics" also have a significant impact to determine the extent
of success of urban plazas and urban open spaces in combination with other quantitative factors, such as centrality of
location, provision of services, and amenities. In addition, this research sought to focus on the relationship between visual
characteristics and aesthetic response to urban plazas. Photo elicitation and focus interviews were conducted to identify
key visual characteristics as well as to examine aesthetic responses to those characteristics. Eight plazas and designed urban
open spaces in Dhaka, Bangladesh, featured in the main study, and research methods included a structured questionnaire
to collect data and used semantic differential rating scales as a measuring instrument. Outcomes from this research indicate
that a positive aesthetic response was linked to specific visual characteristics of urban plazas, suggesting that this information
could be used to more effectively refurbish existing and design new urban plazas as public spaces.

of pattern, appreciation of rhythm, recognition of balance,
and sensitivity to harmonic relationships. As all visual quali-
ties are not "aesthetic," in this article, the definition of aes-
thetic refers solely to visual qualities that can create an
appreciation of an urban environment (Carmona, Heath, Oc,
& Tiesdell, 2010).
The design of urban plazas can positively or negatively
affect the use of public spaces, and therefore, designers have
a special responsibility to understand and design in such a
way as to serve the public good (Carr, Francis, Rivlin,
& Stone, 1992). Over the last few decades, environment­
behavior studies have provided an effective way of examin-
ing the interrelationship between visual characteristics of the
built environment and human responses. Many studies have
focused on neighborhoods and public streets (Gehl, 2006;
Mehta, 2009). While other research has examined residential
streets and community spaces (Sullivan, Kuo, & Depooter,
2004), some studies have concentrated on the physical attri-
butes of the environment by combining behavior mapping
and geographic information system (GIS) techniques
(Golicnik, 2007; Marusic, 2011). Some authors are con-
cerned about visual preference, permeability, functional
aspects, and impressions of enclosed spaces and urbanscapes
(Herzog & Flynn-Smith, 2001; Stamps, 2005a, 2005b,
2005c). However, it is likely that positive aesthetic response
in relation to urban plazas depends to a certain extent on the
visual attributes of architectural characteristics and features,
and a logical assumption is that successful urban plazas may
also be those that generate positive aesthetic responses. Thus,
it is imperative to explore the relationship between the envi-
ronmental and aesthetic qualities of urban plazas to improve
their efficiency given that plazas serve as a form of urban
relief for urban dwellers.
Research Framework and Void in
Literature to Aesthetic Response
Over the last few decades, using an empirical approach to
address environment­behavior studies of urban open spaces
has become common. It is considered that there is a strong
relationship between the built environment and the aesthetic
dimension of urban space. The Austrian architect and city
planning theoretician Camillo Sitte (1965) recommended
two primary elements, nodes and paths, in addition to artistic
elements, that is, fountains and monuments, as the most
important features for planning and designing of urban
forms. Kevin Lynch (1960, 2007) further developed this rec-
ognition of essential characteristics of urban forms and iden-
tified paths, edges, nodes, districts, and landmarks as the
vital components defining the quality of the city image. In
addition to identity, structure, and meaning to evaluate the
cityscape, Nasar (1998) argued that the evaluative image
also represents some psychological constructs that involve
subjective assessments of feelings about the environment.
Affective appraisal is one aspect of how someone interprets
an environment in terms of psychological arousal. Russell
(2003) focused on the emotional appraisal of the physical
environment and found different dimensions as the psycho-
logical construction of emotion. Kaplan and Kaplan (1982)
suggested an environmental preference framework to evalu-
ate the physical environment, and found "coherence" and
"complexity" as an immediate appreciation of the environ-
ment, and "legibility" and "mystery" as a longer term
evaluation.
This research sought to examine the interface between the
visual characteristics of urban plazas and the aesthetic
response. As a framework, this research has adopted Nasar's
(1994) probabilistic model of aesthetic response to the built
environment. Nasar considers that overall aesthetic response
is a combination of perception, cognition, affect, and affec-
tive appraisal (Figure 1). Furthermore, Nasar's model
acknowledges that affect, cognitive judgments, and affective
appraisals of building attributes are highly interrelated and
complex, and hence, his model is probabilistic rather than
predictive due to the influence of individual characteristics,
personality, affective state, and cultural experience of indi-
vidual observers. By adopting the framework of this model,
key visual characteristics of urban plazas for positive aes-
thetic response has been developed as a future design model.
We observed from the previous studies that some affec-
tive variables as well as cognitive judgments are included to
measure the aesthetic response (Abu-Obeid, Hassan, & Ali,
2008; O'Connor, 2006, 2011; Taylor, 2009). Several percep-
tual, cognitive variables can measure the visual properties of
a physical environment, and arousal, evaluation, and prefer-
ence have been used to measure affective variables. Nasar
(1998) also argues that the evaluative process, which may
involve two kinds of variables, results from a complex pro-
cess between observers, the cityscape (environment), and an
interaction between the two. As such, the evaluation process
involves psychological constructs that also reflect subjective
assessments of feelings about the environment (Nasar, 1998).

Aesthetic response has been explored in relation to differ-
ent aspects of landscape, building style, streetscape, city
image, façade color, house style, house form, urban environ-
ment, urban spaces, and individual urban plazas (Heft
& Nasar, 2000; Nasar, 1994).
Some research has also been undertaken in relation to aes-
thetic experience of landscapes, architectural forms,
streetscape, building exteriors, and city images (Nasar, 1994,
1998; Olascoaga, 2003). From the review of related litera-
ture, there emerges a growing demand and need to measure
environmental aesthetics, and the responses toward the aes-
thetics of the built environment. Although there are various
operational measures and factors of aesthetic response, few
attempts have been made to measure aesthetic responses in a
mixed-method approach toward the built environment or to
the overall evaluation of environmental aesthetics. Therefore,
this study chose to focus on specific physical features, visual
and architectural characteristics of urban plazas, by using
both qualitative and quantitative data analysis to concentrate
on the interface between the visual attributes of the built
environment of urban plazas, aesthetic response. Model of
aesthetic response provides ways to represents and investi-
gates the aesthetics of built environment that can also act as
a reference framework for future research works.
Research Design and Method
This research involved two phases, mixed-methods approach
with the first phase being a preliminary study that identified
as well as explored preferences in terms of the visual charac-
teristics of urban plazas using photo elicitation. The main
study or second phase used field survey and sought to iden-
tify levels of association between aesthetic response and the
visual characteristics of urban plazas. This article concen-
trates on the main study by using key findings of the prelimi-
nary study, through which interrelationships between visual
characteristics and urban plazas have been explored. Only a
very brief description of the first phase is included in the next
section.
First Phase: Preliminary Study
The main objective of the preliminary study was to identify
preferences for specific visual and architectural character-
istics of a range of famous urban plazas, squares, and
pedestrian malls from different urban spaces around the
world. Using an iterative mixed-methods approach, the
study involved focus interviews (using semistructured
questionnaires) as well as Q-sorting tasks in conjunction
with multiple digital images of twenty-four plazas, squares,
and pedestrian malls. The Q-sort technique is a categoriza-
tion or sorting technique, which directs participants to
group visual stimuli into categories as defined by the
researcher (Amin, 2000). To transmit architectural values,
elicitation through photographs is a common device in
different research domains, and photographs or slides have
been used extensively as a substitute for the physical envi-
ronment (Brown & Gifford, 2001; Stamps, 2000; Stamps
& Nasar, 1997). Previous studies that explored the use of
photographic images and other elicitation media have gen-
erally concluded that the correlation between responses to
static color photographs, dynamic virtual reality model, and
responses to the physical environment is comparatively
very high (Stamps, 2010). Therefore, an appropriately
framed picture should be able to tell more than a thousand
words (Gaber & Gaber, 2004).
A group of EBS (environment, behavior, and society)
experts, from the University of Sydney, finalized 24 photo-
graphs to use as visual stimuli from a series of 42 urban pla-
zas from different parts of the world. The selection of 24
plazas was based on two criteria. First, participants were
asked to sort the images into three representative types of
urban open spaces: urban plazas, urban squares, and pedes-
trian malls. Second, the slides had to represent the diversity
of types of scenes according to the visual qualities.
In the first phase, to understand the users' subjective
experience according to their "likeability" of color images,
focus interviews and Q-sorting techniques were applied
among conveniently selected 50 respondents. From a total of
240 evaluations, participants identified the following most
"liked" visual features of urban plazas, squares, and pedes-
trian malls that were considered to influence aesthetic
response. Different research literatures also mention the
importance of these five physical features and corroborate
the following outcomes:
a. a good sense of enclosure (Collins, Collins, & Sitte,
2006; Moughtin, 2003; Stamps, 2005b, 2005c);
b. the height of the surrounding enclosure (in respect to
width; Cullen, 2007; Mehta, 2009; Stamps, 2005c);
c. a good coverage of vegetation, greenery, and natural-
ness (Galindo & Rodríguez, 2000; Herzog, Maguire,
& Nebel, 2003; Nasar, 1998);
d. the inclusion of water features and fountains
(Moughtin, 2003; Whyte, 2007; Woolley, 2003); and
e. presence of monuments or sculptures (Lynch, 2007;
Mehta, 2009).
However, this research only included the tangible visual
characteristics that influence visual qualities of architectural
elements and did not include intangible mediating factors
that might influence cognitive emotional appraisal, such as
order, coherence, complexity, or legibility (Kaplan & Kaplan,
1982; Nasar, 1998; Russell, 2003).
Second Phase: Main Study
The objective of the main study was to identify levels of
association between aesthetic response and the visual char-
acteristics of urban plazas as identified in the preliminary
4 SAGE Open
study. A semantic differential rating scale was used to mea-
sure responses with four bipolar rating scale items: pleasant­
unpleasant, beautiful­ugly, like­dislike, and
desirable­undesirable. To corroborate the findings of the
first phase, the field survey was conducted at eight urban pla-
zas in Dhaka, Bangladesh: Dhanmondi 8, Dhanmondi 32,
Sangshad Bhavan, Zia Uddan, Rayer Bazaar, Ramna, Shahid
Minar, and the Teacher Student Centre (TSC) at Dhaka
University (see Figure 2). Prior to the main study, a pilot
study evaluated the survey methods, the appropriateness of
interview techniques, and questionnaire details, such as the
number and wording of questions as well as the effectiveness
of the use of probes, and the sequence of questions.
As there are few designed urban spaces in Dhaka city, this
research sought to include all urban open spaces of Dhaka
city. However, based on short interviews with 15 architects
and 15 nonarchitects, twelve urban plazas were selected. Out
of these twelve spaces, a final eight urban plazas (Figure 2)
were selected for field survey. The remaining four plazas
were excluded due to privatization of ownership, restricted
accessibility, overlapping visual characteristics, or lack of
vibrancy and less use by the people. Data collection sessions,
which occurred between September and November 2009,
were conducted during the day on these eight urban plazas
and took between 15 to 20 min each. Stratified convenience
sampling was used, and participants included people who
actively used the plazas at the time of the survey. The partici-
pant group for each plaza was 35 resulting in a total sample

size of 280. Each participant group was stratified to ensure a
balance of age groups and gender. The visual characteristics
of each plaza were further identified using a space inventory
survey, based on the five most liked visual features of urban
plazas as per the preliminary study. Nominal group consen-
sus was used to provide different levels within each of the
five categories, and a total of 25 Sydney-based Bangladeshi
architects participated. Selection of the participant group was
based on the relevance of their educational background,
experience, and cultural familiarity, and each participant was
provided with a set of visual stimuli and a 5-point Likert-
type scale questionnaire for each plaza (Table 1).
Therefore, for each variable, the visual characteristics
that are measured by the Likert-type scale are divided into
five levels, and the middle level always represents a "mod-
erate amount." Here, Likert-type scale 1 represents com-
pletely enclosed for "surrounding enclosure," extremely
low for "height of the surrounding enclosure," none at all
for "vegetation," "water features," and "monuments/sculp-
tures." For example, if an urban space is fully enclosed by
any visual barrier, then the Likert-type scale measure is 1.
However, Likert-type scale 5 represents completely open
for "surrounding enclosure," extremely high for "height of
the surrounding enclosure," great amount for "vegetation,"
"water features," and "monuments/sculptures." For exam-
ple, if an urban space is without any visual barrier (com-
pletely open), then the Likert-type scale measure is 5. It is
acknowledged, however, that the dimensions given in
terms of low, moderate, and high are subjective and rela-
tive, and this is often how the author refers to the propor-
tion of these physical characteristics according to the
previous literature. The 5-point Likert-type scale is one
example of those used to measure the physical features
(see Table 1). The results of the space inventory observa-
tions are detailed in Table 2.
Data Analysis and Results
Determining the Variables and Internal Reliability
of the Measurement Instruments
Factor Analysis. An exploratory data reduction technique fac-
tor analysis was used that summarizes data and allows for the
determination of key components to establish whether it was
statistically appropriate to link the variables used in this
study to the construct "aesthetic response" (Pallant, 2007).
The number of factors or components extracted from factor
analysis may vary depending on the loading of the compo-
nent, and the results may be considered as "clean" when the
variables are strongly related (Pallant, 2007; Tabachnick &
Fidell, 2007). Table 3 illustrates the components of aesthetic
response from factor analysis.
Correlation Coefficients.To identify the levels of association
between the variables, Pearson product­moment correlation
analysis was applied, and the strength of correlation between
the variables is quite strong. According to Pallant (2007),
correlation coefficients from .10 to .30 indicate a weak cor-
relation, coefficients from .30 to .50 indicate a medium cor-
relation, and coefficients from .50 to 1.0 indicate a strong
correlation. Strong correlation occurs among the four vari-
ables linked to aesthetic response (pleasant­unpleasant,
like­dislike, beautiful­ugly, and desirable­undesirable).
Strong correlations (with coefficients ranging from .65 to
6 SAGE Open
.81, in Table 4) statistically justify linking these four vari-
ables to the construct aesthetic response.
Cronbach's Alpha.Reliability usually refers to repeated or
replicated similar and consistent research findings over a
number of occasions (Groat & Wang, 2002; Kinnear & Gray,
2009). Internal reliability measures the internal consistency
of the test or measurement instrument, and this was mea-
sured using Cronbach's alpha to ensure that the scale mea-
sured the same characteristics, that is, the variance of
participant's scores on each rating scale item (Kinnear &
Gray, 2009; Pallant, 2007). It is suggested that an alpha ()
score of .7 or above indicates good reliability of the instru-
ment (Tabachnick & Fidell, 2007). In this research, with the
four items of aesthetic response, Cronbach's alpha is .916
(Table 5), which is well above the .7 recommended.
The Relationship Between Visual Characteristics
and Aesthetic Response
Analysis of variance (ANOVA) compares the mean scores
between different groups with the variability within each of
the groups (Pallant, 2007). One-way between-groups
ANOVA was conducted to explore levels of association
between the five visual characteristics (from the first phase)
and the aesthetic response. An F ratio represents the variance
between and within the groups, which are calculated by
dividing the variance between the groups and within the
groups. A large F ratio indicates more variability between the
groups than within each group, and an F ratio close to 1 indi-
cates no difference between the groups (Hinton, 2004;
Pallant, 2007). The results of the one-way ANOVA for the
independent variables on four dependent variables of aes-
thetic response are detailed in Table 6. The F(3, 276) ratio is
greater than 1 indicating significant differences at the p < .05
level in aesthetic response in relation to the identified visual
characteristics. These results indicate that the variable like­
dislike appears to be representative of overall aesthetic
response.
Aesthetic Response and Surrounding Enclosure. Different levels
of enclosure appear to be associated with variations in pref-
erence based on the variable like­dislike. Variations were
strongest for partially enclosed (Likert-type scale 2) and par-
tially open (Likert-type scale 4), as opposed to moderately
enclosed (Likert-type scale 3) and completely open (Likert-
type scale 5). Figure 3 illustrates response to surrounding
enclosure using the variable like­dislike, which, as discussed
above, appears representative of overall aesthetic response
within the context of this study.
Aesthetic Response and the Height of Surrounding Enclo-
sure. Responses were mixed with respect to the height of the
surrounding enclosure, and it is difficult to establish a pattern
or trend in responses. Figure 4 illustrates responses in relation
to the variable like­dislike; however, changes in height of the
surrounding enclosures appear to be much more strongly
associated with variation in the variables pleasant­unpleas-
ant, like­dislike, and desirable­undesirable at the p < .001

significance level. However, overall, it appears that a low
surrounding enclosure (Likert-type scale 2) appears to be
more strongly preferred over extremely low- (Likert-type
scale 1) or moderate-height enclosures (Likert-type scale 3).
Aesthetic Response andWater Features. Responses of a "mod-
erate amount" (Likert-type scale 3) of water features are sig-
nificantly different from other levels of water features.
Variation in the number of water features appears to be more
highly associated with variation in "beautiful­ugly" than to
other preferences. The F(3, 206) ratios detailed in Table 6 are
greater than 1, indicating significant differences at the p <
.05 level to the availability of water features. For the variable
like­dislike, a moderate amount (Likert-type scale 3) of
water features is clearly preferred over other levels of water
features, as illustrated in Figure 5.
Aesthetic Response and Vegetation.A nonsignificant differ-
ence in aesthetic response occurred for different levels of
vegetation, and the effect size calculated by using eta squared
for all the variables was considered a small effect. The F(3,
276) ratios detailed in Table 6 are very close to 1, indicating
nonsignificant differences for aesthetic response at different
levels of vegetation. However, from Figure 6, it is noticeable
that the mean score for "quite a lot" (Likert-type scale 4) of
vegetation is desirable and significantly different for differ-
ent types of responses. In summary, vegetation rated higher
than a "moderate amount" (Likert-type scale 4) is associated
with variation in aesthetic response, and "quite a lot" (Likert-
type scale 4) of vegetation appears to be the most preferred
level of vegetation.
Aesthetic Response and Monuments/Sculptures.The presence
or absence of monuments and sculptures appear to be more
strongly associated with variations: pleasant­unpleasant,
like­dislike, and beautiful­ugly, and the mean scores for
"great amount/size" (Likert-type scale 5) are significantly
different from other levels of monuments/sculptures. Figure
7 illustrates the scores for like­dislike with respect to monu-
ments/sculptures.
Aesthetic Response and Eight Urban Open Spaces. This study
indicates that changes in the visual characteristics of urban
open spaces appear to be associated with variation in aes-
thetic response. In relation to the variables pleasant­
unpleasant, like­dislike, and beautiful­ugly, Dhanmondi 32
and TSC differed significantly from Dhanmondi 8,

Sangshad Bhavan, Ramna, and Shahid Minar. In respect to
the variable desirable­undesirable, Sangshad Bhavan dif-
fered significantly from Dhanmondi 32, Ramna, and Shahid
Minar, while the mean scores for Dhanmondi 32, Sangshad
Bhavan, Zia Uddan, and Ramna were significantly higher in
terms of overall aesthetic response (Figure 8). From Table 2,
it is evident that Urban Plazas 2, 3, 4, and 6 possess similar
kinds of visual characteristics according to the respondents.
Although the contextual settings of the eight study areas are
different for the observed five visual features, these four
spaces share similar kinds of architectural settings and visual
characteristics. This could be the reason why some spaces
scored higher than others. From the ANOVA, the aesthetic
response for each of the five variables also highlighted the
most preferred types of visual characteristics (Figure 3-7) for
the aesthetically preferred urban plazas, such as Dhanmondi
32, Sangshad Bhavan, Zia Uddan, and Ramna. Figure 8 illus-
trates the variable beautiful-ugly and preferences across
eight urban plazas.
Discussion and Conclusion
In conclusion, aesthetic response varied with respect to the
eight featured plazas of Dhaka. While these variations may
be due to factors other than those identified herein, the above
results indicate that various visual features were rated more
highly than others (as per the variables like­dislike, beauti-
ful­ugly, pleasant­unpleasant, and desirable­undesirable).
These visual features include openness and the height of the
surrounding enclosure, in addition to the occurrence of water
features, vegetation, and monuments/sculptures. Therefore, a
partially open, low-height enclosure, with a moderate amount
of water features, moderate to great amount of monuments
and sculptures, and plentiful vegetation, is very strongly
associated with the construct aesthetic response. For aesthet-
ically appealing, user-sensitive design solutions for urban
plazas, designers need to consider the above design features
to generate positive aesthetic response. Based on the above
analysis, the following conceptual model is proposed (Figure
9). The model highlights the key visual characteristics of
urban plazas found to be highly related to positive aesthetic
response within the context of this study.
It is fully acknowledged that the measure of complex per-
ceptual subjective experience, aesthetic response, was lim-
ited to four variables. This research is not concerned about
how people perceive and evaluate different visual character-
istics; rather, the pattern of response is limited to a range of
variables. However, this opens up possibilities for future
research to consider various moderating factors of the envi-
ronment and different respondents (Ferdous, 2011).
Moreover, to test, validate, and generalize the findings, this
study could be used to create even more and diversified
opportunities for future research. By repeating the steps and
approaches of the research method, this research design
could be applied to different towns, cities, and other types of
urban open spaces within different sociocultural contexts.
Hence, future research could include other influential rele-
vant constructs not examined in this study.
This study was conducted in Dhaka, Bangladesh, and it is
yet unknown whether the findings will be replicated in other
settings and situations. Future studies may indicate whether
similar findings occur with respect to urban plazas in other
regions and cities. In addition, opportunities for further
research include examining the levels and weightings to
which each of these key visual characteristics contributes to
aesthetic response. This research model could be used as a
design protocol for making future decisions on policy as well
as being used as a basic model for further academic research
or urban design process (Karimi, 2012). By integration of
users' subjective response with the objective measures ana-
lyzed through SPSS, urban designers, architects, urban and
community planners, social scientists, urban space manag-
ers, and other related authorities can make future urban pla-
zas more successful, useful, and aesthetically attractive and

appealing. By modifying the contextual settings and adopt-
ing the measures and directions indicated in this research, it
is possible for urban plazas to be designed in a more informed
manner so that they routinely become highly successful and
attractive breathing spaces.
