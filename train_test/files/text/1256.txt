Background
Blood pressure levels and the prevalence of hypertension are related
to adiposity.We evaluated the relationship of adiposity to blood
pressure in normotensive and untreated hypertensive African
Americans--an ethnic group with a high prevalence of hypertension
and obesity.
Methods
Outpatient measurements were obtained in 1,858 normotensive and
1,998 hypertensive subjects (44% untreated) residing in Milwaukee.
The blood pressure­adiposity relationship was also analyzed in
non-Hispanic black (n = 908) and non-Hispanic white (n = 2182)
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES)
participants.
Results
InMilwaukeesubjects,bodymassindex(BMI),waist/hipratio,

Conclusions
Although indices of adiposity were greater in hypertensive
than in normotensive subjects, blood pressures were significantly
correlated with measures of adiposity in normotensive, but not
in untreated hypertensive subjects.We hypothesize that the blood
pressure­adiposity relationship in hypertensives is modulated
by a combination of environmental and genetic factors.

Obesity, defined as a body mass index (BMI) 30kg/m2 is
associated with increased cardiovascular disease risk and an
increased risk of death.1,2 Based on the results of National
Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANESs)
within the United States, the prevalence of obesity and over
weight has been increasing in children, adolescents, and
adults for at least the past two decades.3,4 Indices of abdomi
nal obesity (waist circumference, waist/height ratio) and the
prevalence of abdominal obesity have also increased appre
ciably in US children and adolescents between 1988­1994 and
1999­2004.5 These increases have occurred in both sexes and
in all racial/ethnic groups. The highest prevalence of obesity
and overweight has been observed in black women and girls.
Based on the 1999­2000 NHANES, over 50% of black women
aged 40 or more were obese.4
Obesity and hypertension frequently coexist. Within and
across populations, blood pressure levels and the prevalence of
hypertension are related to adiposity. In the INTERSALT study,
BMI was associated with both systolic and diastolic blood pres
sure, unrelated to age, alcohol intake and dietary intakes of
sodium and potassium, as measured by urinary excretion of
these electrolytes.6 Possibly related to the increased prevalence
of obesity, in US adults the prevalence of hypertension increased
from 25.0 to 28.7% between 1988­1991 and 1999­2000.7
The present analysis was undertaken to evaluate the hypo
thesis that the associations of actual blood pressure levels
with BMI and other indices of adiposity (waist circumference,
waist/hip ratio, waist/height ratio, percent body fat) are simi
lar throughout the range of normotensive and hypertensive
blood pressures. African Americans were the primary focus of
study because of the high prevalence of both hypertension and
obesity in this ethnic group. Additionally, data from NHANES
participants were also analyzed to evaluate the adiposity­blood
pressure relationship in other population groups, including
non-Hispanic black and non-Hispanic white normotensive
and untreated hypertensive individuals.
Methods
Normotensive and hypertensive African-American volun
teers were recruited from a variety of community resources

(community blood pressure screenings; radio, TV, and

newspaper 
presentations) and health providers in Milwaukee.
All volunteers identified themselves as black, Negro, or
African American and reported that both parents were
African American in origin and had English as their primary
language. Blood pressure and anthropometric measurements
were obtained during a single, scheduled outpatient visit.
Historical information was obtained about the use of cigarettes
and menopausal status in women. Following the blood pres
sure measurement, peripheral venous blood was obtained for
measurement of serum cholesterol concentration. All subjects
ranged in age from 18 to 55 years. Exclusion criteria included
BMI >36kg/m2, diabetes mellitus, or current pregnancy.
Informed consent was obtained by study personnel from
all subjects, and the protocol was approved by the Froedtert
Memorial Lutheran Hospital/Medical College of Wisconsin
Institutional Review Board.
A total of 1,858 normotensive and 1,998 hypertensive sub
jects were evaluated. Of the hypertensives, 56% were on anti
hypertensive drug therapy. To eliminate the confounding
influence of antihypertensive medications, among hyperten
sives, the adiposity­blood pressure relationship was analyzed
only in untreated individuals.
Blood pressure was measured by trained and certified staff
using an aneroid sphygmomanometer with an appropriate cuff
size for arm girth. After seating the subjects comfortably for
several minutes, two readings were taken in each arm and the
average of the arm with the higher measurement was used as
the blood pressure reading. Subjects were considered to have
hypertension if their systolic blood pressure was 140mmHg,
diastolic blood pressure was 90mmHg, or if they were taking
antihypertensive medications.
Anthropometric measurements included height, weight,
waist circumference, and skinfold thickness measured at mul
tiple sites. Height was measured to the nearest 0.1cm while
the subjects were without shoes, using a standardized Holton
stadiometer. Body weight was measured with a calibrated
beam scale to the nearest 0.1kg with subjects wearing only
light indoor clothing. Waist circumference was measured
using a flexible, inextensible plastic graduated tape with sub
jects in the standing position and was taken at the narrowest
point between umbilicus and superior iliac spine. Hip cir
cumference was measured in a horizontal plane at the level of
maximum extension of the buttocks. Subscapular, suprailiac,
biceps, triceps, and skinfold thicknesses were measured with
a standard protocol using a Lange skinfold caliper. All circum
ferences and skinfolds were measured three times and aver
aged. Based on skinfold measurements, percent total body fat
was calculated with gender-specific formulas using the Durnin
and Womersley equation.8 Serum cholesterol was measured
spectrophotometrically.
The relationship between anthropometric indices and
blood pressure levels was also analyzed using data collected
from 1999 to 2004 NHANES participants. Conducted by the
National Center for Health Statistics, the continuous NHANES
uses a complex, stratified, multistage probability cluster 
sample
design.9,10 Selected subgroups, including non-Hispanic blacks,
are oversampled to improve the reliability of statistical esti
mates. The NHANES sample was limited to non-Hispanic
black or non-Hispanic white persons who had a physical exam
with a valid blood pressure measurement, were not pregnant
at the time of the exam, and were not taking antihypertensive
medications. To match the demographics of the Milwaukee
African-American subjects, the NHANES sample was fur
ther limited to participants aged 31­55 years. As a result, the
unweighted NHANES sample size included 3,090 persons.
Analyses were performed using appropriate survey estimation
commands in STATA v. 9 (Stata Corp, College Station, TX).
Results are presented as mean ± s.e. Two-way analysis of
variance was carried out to determine the significance of dif
ferences of variables, adjusting for sex and blood pressure
status (hypertensive vs. normotensive). Correlations between
blood pressure and anthropometric variables were evalu
ated with either Pearson's correlation coefficient for normally
distributed variables (before or after log transformation) or
Spearman's correlation coefficient for variables that were not
normally distributed. These correlations were adjusted for
age and sex, and in additional analyses, the correlations were
adjusted for age, sex, and reported cigarette smoking status. A
stepwise multivariate regression analysis was used to identify
the best anthropometric predictors of blood pressure. Because
the various anthropometric indices were correlated with each
other, the multivariate analysis started with the most signifi
cant correlate of blood pressure, and only those other indices
that added to the predictability of blood pressure were allowed
to enter the model. Analysis of variance was used to test the
statistical significance of mean differences between gender
and blood pressure (normotensive vs. hypertensive subjects)
groups, and the significance of differences between percent
ages was evaluated with the Chi square test. The significance of
trends across blood pressure quartiles was examined with one-
way analysis of variance, using the bootstrap correction.
Results
A total of 1,858 normotensive and 1,998 hypertensive subjects
were evaluated. In the Milwaukee African-American sub
jects, height, weight, and waist/hip ratio were greater in males
than in females (P < 0.0001), whereas BMI, percent body fat,
and waist/height ratio were greater (P < 0.0001) in females
(Table 1). There were no gender differences in waist circum
ference. All indices of body size (except height) and adiposity
were greater in hypertensive than in normotensive subjects
(P < 0.0001). One percent of normotensives and 4.4% of hyper
tensives were taking lipid lowering medications (P < 0.0001).
Excluding these subjects, mean serum cholesterol concentra
tion was higher in the hypertensives (P < 0.0001).
Of the hypertensives, 56% were on antihypertensive drug
therapy. To eliminate the confounding influence of antihy
pertensive medications, among hypertensives, the adiposity­
blood pressure relationship was analyzed only in untreated
individuals. Overall, combining normotensive and untreated
hypertensive subjects (Table 2), systolic and diastolic blood
286 MARCH 2008 | VOLUME 21 NUMBER 3 | AMERICAN JOURNAL OF HYPERTENSION

pressures were highly correlated (adjusted for age and sex)
with BMI, waist circumference, waist/hip, waist/height, and
percent body fat (P < 0.0001 for each). Excluding subjects
taking lipid lowering medications, the blood pressure read
ings were also significantly correlated with serum cholesterol
(P < 0.001). Based on a multivariate analysis including all
anthropometric measures of adiposity as independent vari
ables in the model, taken together, all indices of adiposity
accounted for 4.1% of the variation in systolic blood pres
sure (P < 0.0001) and 5.1% of the variation in diastolic blood
pressure (P < 0.0001). In a stepwise regression analysis, only
the waist/hip ratio and the waist/height ratio remained in the
model for systolic blood pressure; waist/hip ratio and waist
circumference remained in the model for diastolic blood
pressure. The waist/hip ratio accounted for 3.6% of the vari
ation of systolic blood pressure (P < 0.0001) and 4.2% of the
variation of diastolic blood 
pressure (P < 0.0001); the waist/
height ratio accounted for less than 1% of the variation of
systolic blood pressure and waist circumference accounted
for less than 1% of the variation of diastolic blood pressure
(P < 0.001) for each.
Among only the normotensive subjects, there were again
consistent and highly significant correlations of both systo
lic and diastolic blood pressure with each of the measured
anthropometric traits and with serum cholesterol (Table 2).
Taken together, all indices of adiposity accounted for 4.5% of
the variation of systolic blood pressure (P < 0.0001) and 3.2%
of the variation of diastolic blood pressure (P < 0.0001). In a
stepwise regression analysis, only waist circumference and
percent body fat remained in the model for both systolic and
diastolic blood pressure. Waist circumference accounted for
3.1% of the variation of systolic blood pressure (P < 0.0001)
and 2.6% of the variation of diastolic blood pressure (P <
0.0001); percent body fat also contributed to a smaller extent
to the variability of both systolic and diastolic blood pressure
(P < 0.0001 and P = 0.02, respectively). In contrast, among
hypertensive subjects, there were only a limited number of
marginally significant correlations between blood pressure
and the measured anthropometric traits, and none of the
anthropometric measures significantly contributed to the
variation in blood pressure. Blood pressure was also not cor
related with serum cholesterol in hypertensive subjects. With
the sample size of 889 untreated hypertensive subjects, there
is 90% power to detect a correlation of 0.11 and 99% power
to detect a correlation of 0.15 or greater. Consequently, it is
unlikely that these analyses failed to detect a meaningful cor
relation in the hypertensive subjects.

Relationship of Blood Pressure to Adiposity
The differential associations of blood pressure with adipo
sity between normotensive and hypertensive subjects were
not affected by gender, menopausal status (24% of women
reported being postmenopausal), or smoking history. When
data for women and men were analyzed separately, similar to
the analysis in Table 2, within each gender there were highly
significant correlations between blood pressure and each of
the anthropometric indices in normotensive, but not in hyper
tensive subjects. Sixty one percent of normotensive and 66%
of hypertensive subjects reported a positive cigarette smoking
history (P = 0.064). Overall, all indices of adiposity were lower
in smokers than in non-smokers (P < 0.0001). Further statisti
cal adjustment for smoking history did not alter the correla
tions of blood pressure with indices of adiposity or with serum
cholesterol concentration.
To further evaluate the relationships between blood pres
sure and body size, the combined sample of normotensive
and untreated hypertensive subjects was divided into quar
tiles based on their systolic blood pressure readings. Table 3
presents the mean and median (and interquartile ranges)
blood pressure readings, the actual blood pressure ranges, and
the mean values for the anthropometric indices for each of the
systolic blood pressures quartiles. BMI, waist circumference,
waist/hip ratio, and waist/height ratio all increased signifi
cantly across the blood pressure quartiles (P < 0.0001). Both
systolic and diastolic blood pressures were significantly cor
related with each of the anthropometric indices in the 
lowest
blood pressure quartile (Table 4). In contrast, there were no
significant correlations of systolic blood pressure with any of
the anthropometric measures in the three upper quartiles.
Diastolic blood pressure was also not correlated with the indi
ces of body size except for marginally significant correlations
with waist circumference in the third and fourth quartiles.
Notably, the range of blood pressure values was not con
stricted in the upper quartiles. Indeed, the largest blood pres
sure range was observed in the highest blood pressure quartile.
Consequently, the absence of correlation between blood pres
sure and anthropometric traits in the hypertensive subjects,
cannot be not accounted for by constricted blood pressure
ranges in the upper blood pressure quartiles.
Among NHANES participants, weight, BMI, waist circum
ference, and waist/height ratio were all greater (P < 0.0005)

in untreated hypertensive than in normotensive participants
(Table 5). Combining normotensive and untreated hyper
tensives, for both black and white participants, 
systolic and
diastolic blood pressure values were significantly 
correlated
with BMI, waist circumference, and waist/height ratio
(P < 0.0005). Similar to the results in the larger number of
Milwaukee African-American subjects, in both black and
white NHANES participants, systolic and diastolic blood pres
sure values were significantly correlated (P < 0.0005) with
these anthropometric measures only in normotensive, but
not in hypertensive participants (Table 6). Overall, there was
found no difference in the percent of smokers between nor
motensive and hypertensive subjects, either in black and white
participants combined (29.3 vs. 27.3%; P = 0.4) or within each
ethnic group analyzed separately. The BMI was lower in smok
ers among both blacks (P < 0.0005) and whites (P = 0.002), and
among blacks, waist circumference was also lower in smokers
(P = 0.007). Further statistical adjustment for smoking status
had no effect on the significance of the correlations between
adiposity and blood pressure or on the differences of these cor
relations between normotensives and hypertensives in both
black and white participants.
Discussion
Previous reports describe either a positive association of blood
pressure with anthropometric measures in predominantly
normotensive populations or the association of higher anthro
pometric measures with an increased prevalence or incidence
of hypertension, but not with actual blood pressure levels in
hypertensive individuals. The new information in this study is
the observation that the relationship of blood pressure to adi
posity differs in normotensive and in untreated hypertensive
individuals.
In the Milwaukee subjects, systolic and diastolic blood pres
sure values were highly correlated with indices of body size in
normotensive African-American men and women. In striking
contrast, there were no correlations of systolic blood pressure
and only inconsistent, marginally significant correlations of
diastolic blood pressure with these anthropometric traits in
untreated hypertensive individuals. Furthermore, even among
subjectsintheupperrangesofthenormotensiveblood
pressure
distribution, there was no association of blood pressure with
the measured anthropometric indices. Several reports sug
gest that the relationships of body size to blood pressure level,
the prevalence of hypertension, and mortality are weaker in
African Americans than in whites.2,7,11,12 Nevertheless, similar
to the current observations in Milwaukee African Americans,
among NHANES participants, correlations of blood pressure
with body size were observed only in normotensive, but not in
untreated hypertensive blacks or whites.
To a greater extent than BMI, increased waist circumference
is associated with elevated arterial pressure and additional
cardiovascular disease risk factors constituting the metabolic
syndrome.11,13,14 The waist/height ratio is also associated with
the metabolic syndrome, and in several populations the waist/
height and waist/hip ratios are more closely associated with
cardiovascular disease than either BMI or waist circumference
alone.15,16 Although the measurement of waist circumference
includes both subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissue, vis
ceral adipose tissue independent of total body fat has been
found to be the most consistent correlate of hypertension
and the metabolic syndrome.17­19 In the current study, in a
multivariate analysis with all measures of adiposity included
as independent variables in the model, only waist circumfer
ence was predictive of systolic blood pressure in untreated

Americans.
Longitudinal studies provide the most compelling evidence
for a causal relationship between weight gain and the subse
quent development of hypertension.20­22 Conversely, pri
marily in short-term studies, weight loss is associated with a
decrease in blood pressure and hypertension prevention, even
when dietary salt intake is held constant.23,24 The average
effect of weight loss on blood pressure is small, and long-term
results are disappointing.22 In morbidly obese individuals, the
Swedish Obese Subjects study suggests that the beneficial effect
of weight loss on blood pressure during active weight loss may
not be sustained over time during weight maintenance.25 The
current demonstration of the association of adiposity with
blood pressure in normotensive, but not in hypertensive indi
viduals, raises the possibility that control of body weight may
be a more effective strategy for hypertension prevention than
for the treatment of hypertension.
Hypertension and obesity are multifactorial traits deter
mined by a complex interplay of genes and environment.26,27
Although weight gain may be a predisposing factor for the
development of hypertension, our data are compatible with
the concept that the relationship between adiposity and blood
pressure is modulated by genetic and environmental factors.
For example, the Pima Indians have the highest prevalence of
reported obesity in the world, but a low prevalence of hyper
tension. Experimental evidence suggests that the lack of an
increase of sympathetic nervous system activity with increas
ing adiposity contributes to the low prevalence of hyperten
sion in this population.28
Several limitations of this study should be noted. Four blood
pressure measurements were obtained during a single outpatient

Relationship of Blood Pressure to Adiposity
visit. Although a clinical diagnosis of hypertension is defined
on the basis of an arbitrary blood pressure value, by evaluating
correlations of blood pressure with adiposity and by separating
subjects into blood pressure quartiles, we describe the relation
ship of adiposity to blood pressure across wide ranges of blood
pressure rather than focusing exclusively on one blood pres
sure value. Nevertheless, the results of this cross sectional study
should not be interpreted to minimize the potential contribution
of weight change to blood pressure change over time. The study
was carried out exclusively in African Americans. Although
inclusion of NHANES data provided the opportunity to evaluate
the blood pressure­
adiposity relationship in a population based
sample of white subjects, this relationship should be explored
in additional population groups. To eliminate the confounding
effects of antihypertensive drug therapy, hypertensive patients
on drug therapy were not included in the analysis of the blood
pressure­adiposity relationship.
In summary, in both blacks and whites, indices of adiposity
were greater in hypertensive than in normotensive subjects.
In both the Milwaukee subjects and the NHANES partici
pants, combining normotensive and untreatred hypertensive
individuals, blood pressure values correlated with adiposity.
However, a relationship between blood pressure and adipos
ity was not observed throughout all blood pressure ranges.
Blood pressure values were significantly correlated with adi
posity only in normotensive subjects, but not in subjects with
hypertension. These observations are consistent with the
hypothesis that control of body weight may be a more effec
tive strategy for hypertension prevention than for the treat
ment of hypertension.
