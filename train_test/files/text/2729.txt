Session: 96. HIV Co-Morbidities and Co-Infections

Background. In the setting of expanded ART, there is increasing awareness that
HIV-infected populations also face a dual burden of non-communicable diseases
(NCDs). The aims of this study are to describe the differences in prevalence and access
to care for diabetes (DM) and hypertension (HTN) across the HIV Care Cascade in
Agincourt, South Africa and to assess the relationship between HIV infection, ART use
and access to care for these major NCDs.
Methods. The Health and Aging in Africa: Longitudinal Studies of INDEPTH
Communities (HAALSI) Study is a cohort of 5059 adults aged 40 and over based in
Agincourt. Enrollment took place from November 2014 through November 2015. This
survey collected self-reported demographic characteristics and health service utiliza-
tion. Height, weight, blood pressure (BP), glucose, HIV antibody, viral load and expo-
sure to ART (FTC/3TC) were measured. We calculated differences in access to care for
DM and HTN among HIV-positive participants who had never received ART (HIV/
Never ART), who had a detectable viral load on ART (ART/VL Detected) and who
were virally suppressed on ART (ART/Suppressed), compared to the HIV-negative
population. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used; all models were adjusted
for age, sex, BMI, educational attainment and wealth quintile.
Results. DM prevalence in the HIV-positive groups ranged from 6.6 to 9.1% and
HTN from 42.6 to 50.4%. Logistic regression models showed increased odds of ever
receiving a blood pressure (OR: 1.80, 95% CI: 1.24­2.60) or glucose measurement
(OR: 1.53, 95% CI: 1.12­2.09) among the ART/VL Detected group and increased
odds of ever receiving a glucose measurement (OR: 1.47, 95% CI: 1.15­1.87) or pre-
ventive counseling regarding diet (OR: 1.70, 95% CI: 1.19­2.43) or exercise (OR: 2.04,
95% CI: 1.34­3.11) among the ART/Suppressed group, as compared to the HIV-neg-
ative population.
Conclusion. The burden of NCDs is substantial across the HIV Care Cascade in
Agincourt. The HIV-positive population on ART also reported greater access to pre-
ventive care for NCDs. The positive spillover effects from ART utilization to preventive
care for other chronic conditions could provide a powerful vehicle for broader popu-
lation health improvements via increased programmatic integration.
