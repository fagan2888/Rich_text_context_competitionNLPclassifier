A 1985 estimate that 4500 respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)­associated deaths occur annually
among US children has not been updated using nationally representative data. Thus, 1979­1997
multiple cause-of-death records for children !5 years old listing bronchiolitis, pneumonia, or
any respiratory tract disease were examined. Deaths among children associated with any res-
piratory disease declined from 4631 in 1979 to 2502 in 1997. During the 19-year study period,
1806 bronchiolitis-associated deaths occurred (annual mean, 95 deaths; range, 66­127 deaths).
Of these deaths, 1435 (79%) occurred among infants !1 year old. Congenital heart disease, lung
disease, or prematurity was listed in death records of 179 (9.9%), 99 (5.5%), and 76 (4.2%) children
dying with bronchiolitis, respectively. By applying published proportions of children hospitalized
for bronchiolitis or pneumonia who were RSV-infected to bronchiolitis and pneumonia deaths,
it was estimated that 510 RSV-associated deaths occurred annually during the study period,
fewer than previously estimated.
Acute lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) are an im-
portant cause of mortality among children !5 years old and
remain the leading cause of disability-adjusted life years lost
worldwide [1]. The LRTI burden is borne disproportionately
by children in developing regions, where it is estimated that 4.3
million children !5 years old die annually of LRTIs [1, 2].
However, LRTIs are also associated with substantial childhood
mortality in more developed countries, including those in the
Americas [3].
Bronchiolitis is an important manifestation of LRTI, partic-
ularly among infants. An increasing proportion of US child-
hood LRTI morbidity, as gauged by hospital admissions, is
associated with bronchiolitis. From 1980 through 1996, the pro-
portion of all lower respiratory disease hospitalizations asso-
ciated with bronchiolitis among US children !1 year old in-
creased from 22% to 47% [4].
Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the pathogen most com-
monly recovered from children with bronchiolitis [5, 6]. As many
as 50%­90% of children hospitalized during the winter with bron-
chiolitis may be infected with RSV [6, 7]. The contributions of

RSV infection and bronchiolitis to US childhood mortality have
not been assessed recently. A study that compared 1975­1984
respiratory virus isolation data from 10 laboratories with US
mortality data among children !5 years old demonstrated a tem-
poral association between winter RSV outbreaks and LRTI
deaths among infants 1­11 months old [8]. In 1985, the National
Institute of Medicine made the only national estimate of RSV-
associated childhood mortality. The institute multiplied a pos-
tulated risk of 0.5% for hospitalization among children infected
with RSV by a 1984 population projection of children !5 years
old [9]. By assuming that 60% of RSV hospitalizations would
occur among those !1 year old, the institute estimatedthat54,697
infants and 36,465 children 1­4 years old were hospitalized.RSV-
associated deaths were calculated by assuming that 5% of chil-
dren hospitalized with bronchiolitis would die on the basis of
mortality among 229 RSV-infected infants hospitalized in a single
tertiary-care facility during 1976­1980 [10]. Thus, the institute
predicted 2736 RSV-related deaths per year among infants and
1832 among children 1­4 years old.
Since publication of the Institute of Medicine report, several
hospital-based studies have documented that mortality among
RSV-infected infants with congenital heart disease or other
high-risk conditions has decreased markedly, probably because
of earlier surgical correction or improvements in critical care
[11, 12]. The effect of decreasing mortality among medically
complex children with cardiac or lung disease on the overall
RSV mortality rate is unknown. Here we describe trends in
bronchiolitis-associated deaths among US children and esti-
mate deaths potentially associated with RSV infection by using
national data for bronchiolitis and pneumonia deaths. Current
JID 2001;183 (1 January) Bronchiolitis-Associated Mortality 17
estimates of childhood mortality associated with RSV infection
are important for economic assessments of prevention inter-
ventions, including the cost-effectiveness of the recently licensed
humanized murine monoclonal anti-RSV antibody, palivizu-
mab [13­15], and of candidate RSV vaccines.
Methods
Sources of data. We analyzed multiple cause-of-deathmortality
data compiled by the National Center for Health Statistics, Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention, from 1979 through 1997 [16,
17]. A bronchiolitis-associated death was defined as a death for
which an International Classification of Diseases (ninth revision;
ICD-9) code for acute bronchiolitis (466.1) appeared anywhere on
the death record [18]. Since 20 multiple causes-of-death can be
listed on a death certificate, use of such a strategy should capture
both nosocomial bronchiolitis cases and those deaths for which
bronchiolitis was a contributing, but secondary, cause. Records for
deaths associated with pneumonia (ICD-9 codes 480­486) and with
any respiratory tract disease (ICD-9 codes 460­519) also were ex-
amined. The single underlying cause of death for each bronchiolitis-
associated death was determined by using computerized selection
and modification rules that were developed to ensure international
comparability of mortality data [17, 19, 20].
Because congenital heart disease [10, 21], chronic lung disease
[22], and premature birth [23] have been associated with increased
morbidity among infants hospitalized with RSV infection, these
conditions were specifically ascertained among those children who
died with bronchiolitis. Prematurity was defined by the appearance
of ICD-9 code 765 (disorders relating to short gestation and un-
specified low birth weight) anywhere on the death record. Children
were classified as having lung disease arising in the perinatal period
if any of the following codes appeared in death records: 769 (res-
piratory distress syndrome), 770.1 (meconium or massive aspiration
syndrome), 770.2 (interstitial emphysema and related conditions),
770.3 (pulmonary hemorrhage), 770.4 (primary atelectasis/pul-
monary immaturity not otherwise specified), 770.5 (other atelec-
tasis originating in the perinatal period), 770.7 (chronic respiratory
disease arising in the perinatal period), 770.8 (other respiratory
problems after birth arising in the perinatal period), or 770.9 (un-
specified respiratory condition of the fetus and newborn). The fol-
lowing ICD-9 codes were used to define the presence of congenital
heart disease: 745 (bulbous cordis anomalies and anomalies of car-
diac septal closure), 746 (other congenital anomalies of the heart),
747.0 (patent ductus arteriosus), 747.1 (coarctation of aorta), 747.2
(other anomalies of aorta), 747.3 (anomalies of pulmonary artery),
and 747.4 (anomalies of great veins).
Data analysis. The distribution of bronchiolitis-associated
deaths was examined by year, month of death, age (!1 year or 1­4
years), sex, race (white, black, or other), and association with other
diagnoses listed in death records. Place of residence was analyzed
by using the 4 standard census geographic regions: Northeast,
South, Midwest, and West. Among infants, annual bronchiolitis
mortality rates were calculated as the number of deaths per 100,000
live births [24]. For children 1­4 years old, denominators were
calculated by subtracting births from intercensal population esti-
mates of children !5 years old for the corresponding year [25].
Poisson regression analysis was used to determine risk ratios (RRs)
and to calculate 95% confidence intervals [26]. To detect possible
trends in coding of death certificates from 1979 through 1997, the
proportions of death records that listed bronchiolitis as the un-
derlying, rather than a multiple, cause of death were compared by
calendar year with the Cochran-Armitage test by StatXact 3 soft-
ware (Cytel Software). A similar method was used to compare the
proportions of children dying with bronchiolitis also diagnosed
with prematurity, chronic lung disease, or congenital heart disease
over time. A 2-tailed was considered statistically significant.

Estimates of RSV-associated deaths. Death certificates often
do not specify the etiological agent of many infectious diseases,
including bronchiolitis. Therefore, we assumed that the proportions
of children dying with bronchiolitis or pneumonia who were in-
fected with RSV were similar to the proportions of children hos-
pitalized in temperate countries for bronchiolitis or pneumoniawho
were RSV infected [27­37]. Thus, RSV-related deaths were esti-
mated by multiplying the average annual number of bronchiolitis
deaths by 0.3­0.7 and by adding this figure to the average number
of pneumonia deaths multiplied by 0.08­0.25.
Results
Bronchiolitis-associated deaths. During the 19-year study
period, 1806 bronchiolitis-associated deaths occurred among
US children !5 years old (mean, 95 annually; range, 66­127).
Of these deaths, 79% (1435) occurred among infants !1 year
old. Among infants, the median age at death was 3 months
(interquartile range, 2­5 months). Bronchiolitis-associated
deaths peaked in January, when 18% of deaths during the study
period occurred (figure 1). Most bronchiolitis deaths, 77%
among children !1 year old and 71% among children 1­4 years
old, occurred during the typical November through April RSV
season. The proportion of bronchiolitis-associated deaths dur-
ing the RSV season was significantly greater among children
!1 year than among children 1­4 years old ( ). Patterns

of monthly mortality did not vary by calendar year or geo-
graphic region of residence (data not shown).
Bronchiolitis was the underlying cause of death in 55% of
children who died with bronchiolitis (table 1). Either acute bron-
chiolitis or acute bronchitis was the underlying cause in 62% of
deaths. The proportion of bronchiolitis-associated deaths for
which bronchiolitis was determined to be the underlying cause
of death did not vary from 1979 through 1997 ( for

as the underlying cause of death in 12% of children who died
with bronchiolitis: interstitial pneumonia (2.8%) and pneumonia,
organism unspecified (2.4%). Any form of congenital heart dis-
ease was the underlying cause of death for 93 children (5.1%),
and lung disease arising during the perinatal period was listed
as the underlying cause of death for 20 children (1.1%).
Only 3 specific diagnoses were listed on 110% of multiple
cause-of-death records among children who died with bronchio-
litis: unspecified bronchopneumonia (15%), unspecified pneu-
monia (13%), and acute bronchitis (11%; table 1). Any form

Mortality rates. From 1979 through 1997, the numbers and
rates of infant and childhood deaths for all respiratory tract
diseases decreased (figure 2A). By 1997, rates among infants
and children were 50% lower than the respective 1979 rates.
In contrast, the number of bronchiolitis-associated deaths and
the mortality rates among children !1 year old and among those
1­4 years old remained relatively stable (figure 2B). Although
some year-to-year variability in these rates was demonstrated,
particularly among infants, the 1997 rates were similar to the
1979 rates (for infants, 2.2 vs. 2.4 per 100,000 live births; for
children !5 years old, 0.57 vs. 0.65 per 100,000 live births).
Although the majority of bronchiolitis-associated deaths oc-
curred among white children (64%), mortality rates were sig-
nificantly higher among black infants (RR, 2.4) and black chil-
dren 1­4 years old (RR, 3.0), compared with those of white
children (table 2). Male infants were 1.5 times more likely to
die with bronchiolitis than were female infants; however, boys
1­4 years old were not at a significantly increased risk of dying
with bronchiolitis. Children in the South faced the greatest risk
of dying with bronchiolitis (RR, 1.6), compared with that of
infants in the Northeast, who had the lowest rates.
Estimates of RSV-associated mortality. A mean of 1772
pneumonia-associated deaths occurred annually among chil-
dren !5 years old during the study period; of these, 1261 deaths
(71%) occurred among infants !1 year old. To estimate RSV-
associated mortality, we multiplied the annual average of pneu-
monia deaths by 0.08­0.25 and added this number to the annual
average of 95 bronchiolitis deaths multiplied by 0.3­0.7. Under

these assumptions, we estimated that 171­510 RSV-associated
deaths occurred annually among young children during the
study period.
Discussion
We found that bronchiolitis-associated mortality rates among
children were relatively stable from 1979 through 1997, with no
suggestion of a consistent increase or decrease. In contrast, child-
hood deaths associated with any respiratory disease decreased
steadily. Fewer than 3000 respiratory deaths occurred annually
during the last 4 years of the study period, 1500 fewer than the
4500 estimated for RSV alone by the Institute of Medicine.
Most children dying with bronchiolitis were not concurrently
diagnosed with underlying prematurity or pulmonary or cardiac
conditions. This finding suggests that the majority of RSV-related
deaths do not occur among children who are presumed to be at
high risk for severe RSV LRTIs. Prophylactic therapy with either
RSV-enriched human immunoglobulin or a humanized murine
monoclonal anti­F protein antibody is available for premature
infants and children with chronic lung disease [13]. However, our
findings suggest that appropriate use of these antibody therapies
will not prevent the majority of RSV-associated deaths.
Although the only specific ICD-9 code for RSV-related dis-
ease (RSV pneumonia, code 480.1) appeared infrequently in
the records of children who died with bronchiolitis (1.6%), the
seasonal pattern of deaths and the fact that 79% of these deaths
occurred among infants provide evidence that RSV is the pri-
mary virus associated with bronchiolitis deaths. Our findings,
that male infants are more likely to die with bronchiolitis than
are female infants and that black children and those living in
the South are at the greatest risk of bronchiolitis-associated
death, are consistent with results of studies of children hospi-
talized with RSV infection. Boys are 1.5 times more likely
than are girls to be hospitalized with RSV infections [4, 37],
and lower socioeconomic status is associated with an increased
risk for hospitalization with RSV [6, 38]. Black race and resi-
dence in the South have been used as crude surrogates for lower
socioeconomic status among US children [39].
We estimate that 200­500 young US children annually die

with RSV-associated deaths, substantially fewer than the 4500
deaths estimated by the Institute of Medicine in 1985 [9], the
only other national estimate of the RSV mortality burden. We
also found that 80% of these deaths occur among infants,
a higher proportion than the 60% assumed in 1985. A recent
estimate suggests that 1500­6700 annual pneumonia deaths
among adults 65 years old may be RSV associated [40]. There-
fore, considerably more RSV-related deaths appear to occur
among the elderly than among children !5 years old.
The fact that fewer than 3000 respiratory deaths of all types
currently occur among young children may constitute the most
compelling evidence that the 1985 Institute of Medicine RSV
mortality estimates are too high to be applicable to the current
US population of children. The 1985 figures were derived by
applying mortality data collected during 1976­1980 from a sin-
gle tertiary-care facility (5%) to the US population of children.
More recent hospital-based studies indicate that mortality from
RSV-associated illnesses among high-risk children has de-
creased since then [11, 12]. In addition, many children with
common childhood diseases (e.g., bronchiolitis) are hospitalized
in general community hospitals. The application of morbidity
and mortality estimates derived from tertiary-care centers,
which typically care for more severely ill children, to the general
population may overestimate serious sequelae, including death.
For example, initial reports from academic medical centers of
children evaluated for febrile seizures indicated recurrence rates
as high as 71% and a markedly increased risk for later non-
febrile seizures [41]. Subsequent population-based studiesfound
lower febrile seizure recurrence rates (29%­35%) and only a
nominally increased risk for epilepsy among children followed
up after an initial febrile seizure [41]. Other examples of referral
bias in observational studies conducted within tertiary-care fa-
cilities include clinical trials and outcomes studies among pa-
tients with multiple sclerosis [42] and diabetes mellitus [43].
An interesting finding in our analysis is that, although mor-
tality rates for all respiratory disease deaths among children
!5 years old decreased during the study period, bronchiolitis-
associated mortality rates remained essentially unchanged.
In contrast, bronchiolitis-associated hospitalization rates in-
creased substantially from 1980 through 1996 [4]. Thus, in-
creasing hospitalization rates have not been accompanied by
concomitant increases in mortality rates. These findings prompt
2 hypotheses: (1) improved medical and surgical care has
decreased the proportion of children hospitalized with bron-
chiolitis who die, and (2) children with less severe bronchiolitis
have had an increased chance of hospitalization since 1980.
Mortality among high-risk RSV-infected children hospital-
ized in academic centers decreased during the study period [11,
12]. As the study period progressed, we believe that less severely
ill infants may have been more likely to be hospitalized for
bronchiolitis. Changes in the evaluation and monitoring of
young children with lower respiratory tract illnesses could result
in increased bronchiolitis hospitalizations, without affecting
mortality rates. For example, expansion of pulse oximetry use
in the evaluation of wheezing infants might lower the threshold
for hospitalization among RSV-infected children who have mild
hypoxia but who are not at risk of impending respiratory failure
[4]. Also, pathology studies linking viral respiratory infection
to sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) cases [44] and epi-
demiological associations between SIDS deaths and temporal
patterns of RSV detection [8] may have compelled health care
providers to hospitalize more young RSV-infected infants for
apnea observation as pediatric monitoring methods improved.
Our population-based study has several limitations. One is the
lack of ICD-9 codes that specifically and completely capture
RSV-associated mortality. Therefore, we were forced to estimate
the RSV mortality burden by multiplying deaths associated with
bronchiolitis or pneumonia by the proportions of these diagnoses
associated with RSV infection among hospitalized children.
Some children whose deaths were related to RSV infection may
not have been included in the death records we used. For ex-
ample, it is possible that infants dying with chronic lung disease
during the winter months may have had undocumented respi-
ratory viral infections that contributed to their mortality. How-
ever, too few children currently die in the United States with
diagnoses such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia to account for
the differences between our estimates and those of the Institute
of Medicine. Finally, the presence of comorbid conditions may
have been underestimated in death certificate records. On the
basis of a previous study, we almost certainly underestimated the
prevalence of prematurity [45]. For other conditions that we were
specifically interested in, however, death certificates appear to
record underlying conditions adequately. For example, congen-
ital heart disease, when examined as a single entity, is completely
JID 2001;183 (1 January) Bronchiolitis-Associated Mortality 21
captured in death records, although specific diagnoses (e.g.,
tetralogy of Fallot) are not adequately identified [46].
A variety of therapies for bronchiolitis and RSV disease were
introduced or became more widely used during the study period,
including ribavirin, bronchodilators, and corticosteroids [47].
However, increasing use of these drugs did not lead to decreasing
rates of childhood bronchiolitis deaths. Corticosteroid treatment
of bronchiolitis and RSV infection was found ineffective in 2
large, well-designed clinical trials [48, 49]. Use of ribavirin in
severely ill patients with RSV disease may not improve outcomes
[50, 51], and routine use of bronchodilators in less severely ill
patients remains controversial [52, 53]. An apparent lack of an
effect of more medication use on bronchiolitis-associated mor-
bidity has also been demonstrated among hospitalized children.
Canadian children hospitalized with RSV infections in 12 pedi-
atric tertiary-care centers experienced similar lengths of stay at
each center, despite considerable variation in medication use,
particularly among previously healthy children [54].
In summary, RSV-associated mortality among young US
children is considerably lower than previously estimated. It is
unlikely that currently available prevention or therapeutic in-
terventions will substantially influence RSV-associated mortal-
ity among young children. If RSV-associated mortality is to be
reduced, effective RSV vaccines that can be administered safely
to infants and the elderly are needed.
