Data that warms: Waste heat,
infrastructural convergence and the
computation traffic commodity
Julia Velkova
Abstract
This article explores the ways in which data centre operators are currently reconfiguring the systems of energy and heat
supply in European capitals, replacing conventional forms of heating with data-driven heat production, and becoming
important energy suppliers. Taking as an empirical object the heat generated from server halls, the article traces the
expanding phenomenon of `waste heat recycling' and charts the ways in which data centre operators in Stockholm and
Paris direct waste heat through metropolitan district heating systems and urban homes, and valorise it. Drawing on new
materialisms, infrastructure studies and classical theory of production and destruction of value in capitalism, the article
outlines two modes in which this process happens, namely infrastructural convergence and decentralisation of the data
centre. These modes arguably help data centre operators convert big data from a source of value online into a raw
material that needs to flow in the network irrespective of meaning. In this conversion process, the article argues, a new
commodity is in a process of formation, that of computation traffic. Altogether data-driven heat production is suggested
to raise the importance of certain data processing nodes in Northern Europe, simultaneously intervening in the global
politics of access, while neutralising external criticism towards big data by making urban life literally dependent on power
from data streams.

Introduction
In 2011, a team of researchers at Microsoft published a
paper in which they argued for the need to decentralise
data centres and place servers in private living spaces as
a way to offset problems with managing the heat that
threatens server halls with disruptions (Liu et al., 2011).
They called the system `data furnaces'. The data fur-
nace represents a high performance server designed to
look like a heater which disperses the heat emitted in
the process of networked computation into private
living and office spaces. It is supposed to reduce the
cost of waste heat management for the data centre by
converting server heat into a new commodity to be sold
to internet users. Internet users would also host the
servers of the data centre in their private space and
pay for doing so. The paper concludes that such a solu-
tion is environmentally friendly as it reduces the carbon
footprint of the data industry and brings more profit to
the data centre by eliminating the need to acquire land,
pay for electricity and invest in cooling systems.
At the time when the paper was published, a mod-
ified version of this idea had already been implemented
in the Finnish capital, Helsinki. In a Cold War bunker
located under a cathedral near the city centre, the IT
company Academica built a data centre and connected
it to the pipes of the local district heating system,
rerouting the waste heat from the servers to heat the
water of 500 central apartments (Vela, 2010).

Since then, similar solutions have been rapidly emer-
ging in a number of European cities. Besides Helsinki,
Stockholm, Paris and London have been at the fore-
front of pushing corporate imaginaries of a new role
for data centres, as energy providers and important
global data processing hubs. TelecityGroup in Paris
has been rerouting its waste heat into an arboretum to
grow plants (TelecityGroup, 2010). Telehouse West in
London Docklands disperses heat from its server halls
into the local district heating system and provides hot
water to nearby houses (Telehouse, n.d.). In Stockholm,
the internet service provider Bahnhof is experimenting
with turning waste heat into the main source of heating
in the Swedish capital while establishing standards for
future `green' data centres (Elementica, 2016; Triple
Green, n.d.). This future is imagined to be `not in the
countryside, it is in cities with a well connected district
heating system', Bahnhof's CEO proclaims (Bahnhof,
2015a). In confirming this statement, the Russian
search engine Yandex opened in early 2016 a massive
data centre in Ma
¨ ntsa
¨ la
¨ , Finland that now provides
the energy to heat water for 20,000 town inhabitants
(DatacenterDynamics, 2015).
The examples above resemble a new wave of techno-
optimism and are commonly veiled in a discourse of
innovation, environmental friendliness and `smarter'
data processing. They are at the same time alarming
as they normalise the production of big data and inter-
connect internet infrastructures with the critical infra-
structures of urban life, that is the systems of water,
energy and heat supply. As Halpern (2014) reminds,
fantasies that connect large data streams with sustain-
ability have been present for a while in contemporary
urban development projects aimed at creating `smart'
cities powered with new media. Inspired by cybernetic
imaginaries from the 1950s, such urban landscapes con-
ceptualise data as a source of stability, wealth and sen-
sory pleasure while converting it into a new raw
material to mine, creating new orders of control and
surveillance (Halpern, 2014: 5).
The bright sustainable future that data centre oper-
ators chart seems to take place in a universe in which
the critical debates that surround big data do not exist,
while cementing data production as a regime of com-
putation that can literally power everyday life. An
enquiry into the nature and implications of this expand-
ing phenomenon is therefore urgent and represents the
main objective of this article.
Big data has been defined as the capacity of certain
actors to compute large data streams (boyd and
Crawford, 2012). This capacity, possessed primarily
by corporate data centre operators, internet service
providers and government security agencies redefines
our ontological and epistemological orientation in the
world, bringing about issues of global surveillance,
ethics, privacy, algorithmic governance, new digital div-
ides and transformations of the public sphere (boyd
and Crawford, 2012; Gillespie, 2014; Harper, 2016;
Kitchin, 2014; Striphas, 2015).
This article extends these concerns by asking what
kind of issues, practices, modes of valorisation and
infrastructural interconnection arise when big data
streams become the raw material that replaces older
forms of energy supply in the urbanised world.
Taking as an empirical object the heat generated from
server halls, the article asks what implications does the
use of waste heat for urban heating have on the eco-
nomic, symbolic and institutional significance of data
and data centre operators? What are the processes by
which the data processing industry becomes an energy
supplier, and with what societal consequences?
Drawing on new materialisms, infrastructure studies
and classical theory of valorisation through waste in
capitalism, the article suggests that by paying close
attention to the ways in which urban infrastructures
are rewired to transport waste heat, we could under-
stand better the processes of ongoing renegotiations of
the meaning, materiality and the value of digital data.
Not least, we can see how the data industry contributes
to extend the sphere of capitalist production and the
digital economy by redefining waste into a desirable
commodity.
Using examples from Stockholm and Paris, two
modes of valorisation of waste heat are outlined: first
through a process of infrastructural convergence, or the
creation of links of dependencies through loops of
energy transfer between the flows of data streams and
those of urban energy supply. And, second, by obscur-
ing power through dismantling the data centre spatially
and moving it into our homes, converting it into yet
another ephemeral artefact. The main contribution of
the article is in showing how these two modes convert
data from a source of value online into a broader
resource of significance. In this process of conversion,
a new commodity is emerging, that of computation
traffic. This commodity arguably extends the power of
data centre operators by allowing them to, first, valor-
ise data online, and second, use big data streams as a
raw material that has to increase and flow perpetually
in the network irrespective of its meaning. The article
concludes with a discussion of the broader implications
of this emerging commodity.
Servers, hot and cold
Within media studies, heat and media temperatures
have been referred to predominantly metaphorically,
and more rarely as the main object of study. Mapping
the historical terrains of the use of temperature in
media studies, Starosielski (2014) reminds of four
2 Big Data & Society
uses. The first, and more common, is McLuhan's (1994)
metaphor of media as cold or hot which refers to the
affective intensities that our engagements with different
mediums evoke. Another use is in Shannon's theory of
thermodynamics where heat describes the conductivity
of communication technologies, whether or not they
can transmit information. A third approach with
Marxian roots refers to transformations of media
over time, moving from one phase to another, or
when media objects change form. Finally, heat as
used by new materialisms has been concerned with
the analysis of media environments and `the expansive
cooling infrastructure needed to dissipate communica-
tions heat' (Starosielski, 2014: 2506). The latter per-
spective is useful to map the context in which the
infrastructures of big data are currently being rewired
and to start charting the modes in which they transform
the value, materiality and cultural meaning of data
streams.
Materiality of media is both about the physicality of
hardware, software, digital objects and artefacts, and
about the material conditions of producing the digital
(Munster, 2014). From a materialist perspective, as
with any other body, media hardware radiates heat
(Mulvin and Sterne, 2014). As a consequence, heat
has always been a problem in electronics. Maxwell
and Miller (2012: 27­30) note how in the famous
essay by Gordon Moore from 1968 about the exponen-
tial increase in density of transistors on a chip, there is
an overlooked section called `Heat Problem'. In it, the
heat generated by the components in a chip is regarded
as an engineering problem that requires consideration.
In 2011, the problem was solved by inventing a new
chip called dark silicon (Maxwell and Miller, 2012:
28). Yet, if solved locally at the level of electronics,
the problem of heat re-emerges in the broader context
of the expansive infrastructures of networked data cen-
tres made of energy-hungry server halls.
In order for the signals of telecommunication net-
works to be pushed through the transoceanic fibre optic
cables, cable stations need to be powered by electricity
and cooled (Starosielski, 2015a: 66). However, only a
minimal part of the energy that powers server rooms is
actually needed to emit signals in the telecommunica-
tion network (Liu et al., 2011). Most of the input elec-
tricity is transformed into heat by the servers, which
can become warm even when computing only a little,
simply due to the close proximity of large numbers of
machines located in a dense space. The heat increases
during computing when a greater load is placed on the
servers' processors.
Intense computation emerges from more than simply
collecting data for surveillance purposes or for produ-
cing `the cloud'. The digital version of the oldest new
media, animation (Manovich, 2001), requires massive
computation power, called render power, to be mobi-
lised. In order to create their 3D films, Hollywood ani-
mation studios use thousands of servers with tens of
thousands of cores to render their animations. Those
who do not possess such computing power revert to the
services of online render farms. These farms usually
operate as part of data centres and cloud-computing
infrastructure, and share their computational capacity.
Because of this infrastructural coexistence, emerging
major actors in the area of online distributed render
power are, unsurprisingly, Google, through its ZYNC
service, and Amazon through its Elastic Compute
Cloud. Universities and other large-scale research facil-
ities face similar needs for large-scale computation
power.
Intense computation processes can make server
rooms reach temperatures of 35­45C that could
result in server failure. Surprisingly, the effort that the
industry exerts to offset this threat has largely evaded
scholarly attention, which has instead predominantly
discussed the input problem, the electricity.
In 2008 when Microsoft was adding 20,000 servers a
month to its server farms and Google already had
about half a million servers, `the cloud' was consuming
gigawatts of energy, representing about 2% of US elec-
tricity consumption, with prospects for doubling every
five years (Maxwell and Miller, 2012: 29). Yet, just
three years later the energy consumption of server
halls surpassed 10% of the global electricity consump-
tion (Cubitt et al., 2011). A much cited report from
Greenpeace shows that up to 80% of this energy
came from coal, making data centres a major polluting
industry (Cook and Van Horn, 2011). This pollution is
specific and it leaves carbon footprints, coal dust and
exploits vast amounts of land needed to store the ser-
vers of the data centres (Gabrys, 2015).
Additional specificity is added by the emission of
`waste heat'. From a materialist perspective heat is an
instance of a `weird materiality' (Parikka, 2012), or a
`material immateriality' (Gabrys, 2015). It is `weird'
because it does not `bend to human eyes and ears
[and is] not only touchable objects, but also modula-
tions of electrical, magnetic, and light energies, in which
also power is nowadays embedded' (Parikka, 2012: 96).
The `weirdness' of heat stems from its ontology of being
a form of energy in flux, one which is culturally con-
structed by the operators of data centres as `dirt and
bad matter' (Parikka, 2012: 98) as it threatens to halt
communication, computation and economic flows.
Waste heat threatens the information power gathered
in the databases of user activity (Gillespie, 2014: 174)
by destabilising the infrastructures of the data centres
and the carefully crafted illusion of `the cloud' that the
industry has laboriously (and successfully) created
(Durham Peters, 2016).

In order to offset this threat, data centres usually use
water. Mel Hogan (2015) demonstrates how the
National Security Agency constructed its surveillance
data centre, the third largest on the planet, such that
it requires 1.7 million gallons of water per day to keep
its servers running. While half of the world's population
lacks adequate access to clean water, Hogan notes how
water is used for both propelling a surveillance machine
and enabling the digital networked lives that we live:
The huge amount of water currently required to
manage our digital lives is inextricably linked to
values we uphold, such as power and control, assumed
to be inherent to Big Data and deeply rooted into the
provisions of nature, while never fully committed to
them. (Hogan, 2015: 7)
In Europe, new data centres tend to be built close to
seas, rivers and lakes in order to ease the supply of water
to server cooling systems. This is also one of the reasons
why cities located in water abundant Northern Europe
are becoming attractive locations for the data industry.
At one of the largest data centres in London,
PowerGate, TelecityGroup collects rain water, stores
it and evaporates it in a controlled way into the atmos-
phere doing `smart climate management' through `free
cooling' (TeleCity Engineering Group, n.d.).
Another way to offset waste heat is by relocating
data centres to geographically colder locations, such
as those in the Arctic climate zone, reshaping the top-
ography of the internet infrastructure (Starosielski,
2014). A paradigmatic example has been Facebook's
data centre in the city of Lulea
° in Northern Sweden,
the first one to be opened outside of the US. While
using as much energy as a steel plant, the centre, also
called `The Node Pole', cools down its servers by pump-
ing outside air into the building and exhausting waste
heat (Harding, 2015). Similar solutions have been
implemented by Google's data centre in Finland and
Apple's equivalent in Denmark.
A commonality of these approaches to cooling is that
they treat heat as `a matter out of place' (Douglas, 2002:
44). But whether matter is in the right or wrong place in
telecommunication systems is negotiated in the process
of capitalist production. The next section extends the
materialist framework by revising theories that help
relate waste heat to circuits of commodity production
and circulation, value and power.
Waste, value and infrastructural
stability
As a material and cultural category, waste is never an
end point. Inherent to capitalism and its need to
expand, waste is created in the dialectical processes of
production and consumption, both of which are con-
tingent on the supply of raw material and the availabil-
ity of infrastructures to transport and process it. What
is of value and what is its opposite, i.e. waste, is deter-
mined by the interested parties in the production pro-
cess. Waste could be a by-product of production, and
equally a by-product of productive consumption, when
the practice of consumption produces the raw material
for new production and consumption practices to
emerge (Bolin, 2011).
Waste is also an intermediate state and a boundary
category in which an object is not in movement towards
valorisation or devaluation but is temporarily exempted
from value (Thompson, 1979). This state is important
for two reasons. First, Thompson notes that at each
moment in time an object is located on a specific trajec-
tory of valorisation, either increasing its value over time,
and hence becoming durable, or decreasing its value and
becoming transient. The conversion from transient to
durable takes place when something becomes waste,
an object of no value and no projected lifespan. If `dis-
covered', the object can increase in value and lead to the
creation of new commodities. Second, the possibility for
these transfers to occur permits the maintenance of
social boundaries and the uneven distribution of
power in society (Thompson, 1979: 109). Simply put,
those who have the power to define what is valuable
in a society (including redefining waste as a valuable
asset) are those who produce and maintain difference.
In a capitalist system, raw materials need to be con-
stantly reinvented in order to allow capital to expand.
As discussed above, the raw material that powers the
data infrastructures, at least in the US, has been pre-
dominantly coal. Yet such raw material is insufficient to
create surplus value in the digital economy, which also
depends on creating symbolic raw materials, such as
audiences for advertisers to mine (Bolin, 2011: 36), or
internet users to be fed to algorithms (Gillespie, 2014:
173). Occasionally, waste also needs to be converted
into a symbolic raw material in order to expand the
digital economy.
In the context of the internet infrastructures, spam is
a good example of the latter. Spam is ambiguous gar-
bage and it is simultaneously the agent that clogs band-
width and the ever multiplying by-product of this
clogging (Brunton and Coleman, 2014). It is quotidian
yet rarely noticed or read by those who receive it.
Despite hijacking bandwidth, spam has been valuable
not only for the economic practices of the dark internet
(Brunton and Coleman, 2014), but also as Bolin (2014)
notes, for internet service providers because it creates
traffic, a commodity that is produced by the flow of
visitors to websites (van Couvering, 2008).
In the case of waste heat, its conversion into a raw
material of value could not happen at once.
4 Big Data & Society
An important step in the process was the phase when
data centre infrastructure operators constructed `the
cloud' and themselves as powerful nodes on which the
digital economy depends.
The creation of the cloud has been predicated upon
aggregating and centralising user information manage-
ment, moving it away from users' personal computers.
As Jakobsson and Stiernstedt (2012) show, this move
had to be perceived as safe. This perception has been
carefully crafted by deliberately inscribing the data
centre in the temporalities of geological, historical
and technological change, placing data centres in his-
tory through which they become part of a desired
future. Stories about the formation of Earth's surface,
the bedrock and broadly geological, political and eco-
nomic stability have been used particularly in the
Nordic countries to define data centres as eternal, and
hence durable (Jakobsson and Stiernstedt, 2012).
Once objects are defined as valuable they also tend
to increase in aesthetic value (Thompson, 1979: 33).
Aerial photos of sleek containers embedded in scenic
landscapes, clean server rooms with shiny pipes, colour-
fully blinking electronics and James Bond-inspired
interiors hyper stylise data centres and make the
visual argument that the landscape becomes more
beautiful through data (Holt and Vonderau, 2015).
Making data beautiful is also intrinsically related to
the process of making data useful (Halpern, 2014).
Yet, as long as heat remains waste within the data
centre it acts as a material force that devalues this so
effortfully and carefully constructed social image of
durable data and its extended utilisation. Waste heat
acts as the major agent of disruption from within the
data centre and threatens its power through the threat
of network instability, transience and decay.
Destabilisation is a common problem for global
communication flows, one that requires constant
effort, strategic material and cultural interventions to
offset disturbances (Graham and Thrift, 2007; Jackson,
2014; Starosielski, 2015b). One of the main ways to
stabilise the internet infrastructure has been through
what Starosielski (2015b: 18) calls `strategies for inter-
connection'. By this she means the process of adding
cultural and material layers of insulation that facilitate
the transfer of multiple forms of energy between the
systems of the cable network and the cultural geogra-
phies into which it is inserted, keeping the network in
equilibrium. Such strategies have ranged from using the
ocean to ground the signals transferred through fibre
optic cables, to arranged marriages between workers in
order to help `sustain the operators and therefore sta-
bilise transoceanic signal traffic in remote locales'
(Starosielski, 2015b: 19).
Commodifying waste heat can therefore represent a
way to insulate the data centre network from inner
disturbances, and therefore stabilise it. Not least, it
can help bring attention to a new commodity that the
data industry creates, that of computation traffic, while
neutralising external criticism by reframing data pro-
duction as environmentally responsible and necessary
for everyone's well-being. The next sections illustrate
how this process happens through discussing examples
from Stockholm and Paris.
Infrastructural convergence
One emerging approach to commodifying waste heat is
through infrastructural convergence. To explain the
process I will use as an example the workings of
Bahnhof, a Swedish internet service provider that has
recently constructed a number of data centres in
Stockholm, in a way that rewires the systems of
energy supply in the Swedish capital to become contin-
gent on data.
Founded in 1994, Bahnhof was one of the first inter-
net providers in Sweden and aims to deliver `Internet
with privacy' as its slogan reveals. Bahnhof adhered to
this principle on multiple occasions. It has been provid-
ing hosting services to Wikileaks since Amazon stopped
servicing it in 2010. It also offered free VPN encryption
to all its clients when the European Union passed the
data retention directive in 2014 that forced all internet
service providers to collect data from their users, thus
making such collection worthless (Bahnhof, 2014).
The data centre that hosts Wikileaks is Pionen.
Inaugurated in 2008 in a Cold War nuclear bunker in
the city centre, Pionen attained a cult status for its
futuristic cyber-utopian design largely inspired by
popular culture, and the symbolism of its location
which in the event of a cataclysm would likely be one
of the few that would remain intact, signifying the value
of the data hosted there (Holt and Vonderau, 2015;
Jakobsson and Stiernstedt, 2012).
While providing cloud services online, Bahnhof also
created a visible cloud of steam in central Stockholm,
which for years was a cause of anxiety for citizens. In a
2015 press release, the company explained that the
cloud of steam was generated by its underground ser-
vers. It also announced its new project to eliminate the
visually disturbing sight of the steam cloud by routing
heat into the pipes of the district heating system in this
part of Stockholm (Bahnhof, 2015b).
Bahnhof's solution was to create a large cooling
plant inside the data centre that would absorb the
waste heat from the servers and pump it in the homes
of the city dwellers. The system was serviced by
Fortum, one of Stockholm's largest electricity and dis-
trict heating providers (Open District Heating, n.d.). As
of 2016, the plant's waste heat is said to provide a con-
stant supply of between 600 kW and 1 MW of heat
Velkova 5
with a delivery temperature of 68C (Open District
Heating, n.d.).
The streams of waste heat that enter homes, shops
and offices in Stockholm currently pair the production
of digital data with the residents' sensory experiences of
ambience. This process of integration literally shows
how heat can move `across and through infrastructure,
ecologies, and bodies' (Starosielski, 2014: 3). As Larkin
(2013) reminds us, infrastructures are able to influence
sensory experiences of softness, hardness, the noise of a
city or the feeling of being hot or cold, affecting per-
ceptions of temporality, speed and the sense of what it
is to be modern and part of a specific future.
The future of Bahnhof is one of intervening in the
energy politics of the Swedish capital through comput-
ing data and providing heating with it, attempting to
eliminate older forms of energy supply and convert the
data centre into an essential energy provider. The cool-
ing plant in Pionen, likewise in other data centres is far
larger than the current capacity requires (Open District
Heating, n.d.). In building a cooling system on such a
scale, Bahnhof reflects the general principle of the tele-
communication cable industries' to bind their economic
models and infrastructures to a projection of media as
an ever-expanding resource to be capitalised on
(Starosielski, 2015a). The value of the heat fluctuates,
based not on the servers' temperature but on the out-
door temperatures making servers in colder climates
economically more profitable, strengthening the
attractiveness of northern locations: `On a cold winter's
day one megawatt hour can be worth ten times as much
as on an ordinary summer's day. Bahnhof still knows
that it has made a good investment' (Open District
Heating, n.d.).
Since Pionen, Bahnhof and Fortum have built three
larger data centres in Stockholm with this system in
place and two more are in the planning stage. One of
them is intended to be Stockholm's largest data centre
code named Elementica. Admitting that the new `21
megawatt monster' is a heavy industry project, its cre-
ators nevertheless promise it will be the world's most
modern and climate smart data centre. They envision a
future where Stockholm is Northern Europe's internet
hub, replacing the main sources of heating for the cap-
ital with the waste heat from the data centre (Bahnhof,
2016; Elementica, 2016). Elementica is estimated to
generate 112 GW h of heat per year and provide that
heat to 20,000 households.
Such a replacement is significant for converting the
production of data from a source of value online into a
raw material to power urban life. Yet, the success of the
imaginary that underpins this multimillion investment
is crucially dependent on the ability of data centre oper-
ators to fill the data processing and storage capacity of
these oversized centres. This need implies that we are
still to see an increase in the intensity of the generation
of big data, while the projected infrastructures that
anticipate such production already create firm depen-
dencies between the ambient experience of comfort of
city dwellers and the need for increased data produc-
tion and computation.
When new infrastructures are established they tend
to be layered upon older ones, creating historical lines
that chart different temporalities and cultural contexts
in which each layer has emerged (Star and Ruhleder,
1996). The type of infrastructural connection that
Bahnhof makes is somewhat different. It is not about
layering on top, but about converging older infrastruc-
tures with those of big data. The heat emitted by servers
and its valorisation extends the process of media con-
vergence beyond that of media formats and devices.
Instead it becomes materially implicated with legacy
infrastructures, transforming them and replacing their
raw material with data and waste heat.
The spatial dismantling of the
data centre
Another way to valorise waste heat in European capital
cities, albeit on a smaller and more experimental scale,
is through the attempts of providers of computation
services to realise the idea of data furnaces.
One of the most successful examples so far is that of
Qarnot computing, a French company that specialises
in providing computation power rather than storage to
banks, research institutes and animation studios.
Founded in 2013, the company has created a `smart'
heater that represents `a fusion of an electrical heater
and a high-performance computer server' (Qarnot
Computing, n.d.). The device is called Q.rad and pro-
duces heat by computation. When a client of Qarnot
requires computing power to process financial data or
render a scene of an animation film, the Q.rads are
activated and each of them produces 500 W of energy
that heats up a space of 13­25 m2. If no computation is
requested, the server pulls tasks from its cache or per-
forms dummy calculations to emit heat. The electrical
consumption is measured by an embedded meter, and
the bill is sent to the client who ordered the computa-
tion, rather than the one who used the heat. Since 2013,
the company has installed 300 such heaters in Paris
apartment blocks and 25 in the Telecom ParisTech
incubator, with plans for expanding to the Nordic
countries, the US and China.1
In this scheme of valorising waste heat, the space of
private homes and office buildings becomes the infra-
structure that bears the data centre, supplies it with
electricity and cools it down. The home becomes a cool-
ing environment and a node in the telecommunication
network that ensures its stability. It powers it physically
6 Big Data & Society
with electricity, cools it down and fills it symbolically
with content through the more mundane online activ-
ities of the household members. The production of con-
tent does not directly heat the living space, but it
supplies the network with more data, a justification
for such infrastructure to be built at the first place.
More importantly though, the members of the house-
hold are made involuntary into service staff that can
observe and report the physical attributes of the
heater, push buttons or carry out hard reboot of the
server if requested, in the case of malfunction, or need
of repair. These services are normally provided by dedi-
cated staff at the data centre, but in Qarnot's configur-
ation there is no need for such paid labour. There is
also no central space in which such labour could poten-
tially work. Data furnaces installed in private living
spaces fiscally devalue the work of data centre mainten-
ance. What the household members receive in return is
a product that has sign value. It comes in the form of a
supposedly enhanced sensory experience of comfort
that the heat produced through computation creates.
As Qarnot claims, it is `a high quality ``soft'' heat as
opposed to electrical convectors' (Qarnot Computing,
n.d.). Such an aestheticised waste heat can provide resi-
dents with a sense of pleasure and evoke feelings of
progress, of belonging to the future and of giving mean-
ing to what it is to be a responsible producer of big
data. In a campaign video by the Dutch company
Nerdalize, which is experimenting with an identical
approach to Qarnot in cooperation with the energy
provider Eneco, an elderly couple shares their positive
feelings about the new server heater they received:
Does it buzz? Does it hiss? Does it gurgle? Does it beep?
Not at all -- it's completely silent! (giggle) -- I just
think the whole idea is brilliant -- that rather than
putting all those things together inside a single unit
that you then need to cool, you spread them around
instead, one by one, among private individuals so that
everyone gets to benefit from it. I think that before long
hundreds of families will start enjoying the benefits of
this option. (Nerdalize, 2015)
Besides homes, other important nodes in the dis-
tributed data centre are schools where Qarnot has
experimentally placed 50 server heaters to guarantee
that even if households turn off the heaters on warm
summer days, those in schools will keep computing
and cool the network by emitting waste heat while
students are on vacation (Judge, 2014). In addition
to considerations about locations in which the ser-
vers could be placed as part of the topography of
the internet, data centres anchor their infrastructures
in the temporal cycles of social life and seasonal
change.
To sum up, in this mode of valorising waste heat, the
data centre is fragmentised, decentralised and its com-
puting servers are moved into multiple private and
public spaces. Such a move introduces a new degree
of ephemerality to `the cloud'. Its materiality and work-
ings are veiled in a new degree of abstraction that is
ever harder to locate. With materiality reconfigured,
data centre service workers redefined and data ready
to replace heat supply in private living spaces, the
data centre rises in power and veils itself in deeper
opacity.
In a certain way, this approach mirrors some earlier
internet infrastructures such as the bit torrent protocol
that made possible peer-to-peer file sharing. It also
exhibits similarities to the commons-based peer produc-
tion mode of creating value in the internet economy
(Benkler, 2006). One lesson that these models of cul-
tural production have taught us is that their emergence
has come with a profound transformative charge that
has altered economic, cultural and technological pro-
duction, bringing about phenomena such as Wikipedia,
Napster and concentrations of algorithmic power.
The concluding section of this article discusses the
transformations that occur through the two modes of
turning waste heat into a utility and their broader
implications.
Transformations of data and the birth of
the computation traffic commodity
We can see that with the intensification of big data
production there have emerged particular locations in
Europe where waste heat is being converted into a valu-
able asset and a raw material to mine by data centre
operators. These developments are significant in
several ways.
First, the creation of this raw material is a sign of the
ongoing formation of a new commodity, that of com-
putation traffic. Traffic as a commodity emerged after
the Dotcom crash, as a result of the process of the
reconfiguration of the web portals and the search
engine market (Van Couvering, 2008). This reconfigur-
ation implied that it was no longer as valuable to pro-
vide content to users as to increase and keep the flow of
visitors, a move that led to search engines becoming
outright winners. The traffic commodity was further
developed by internet server providers and data centre
operators that were able to aggregate and organise
information about these flows and sell it to third par-
ties. Bolin (2014) shows how this process extended the
general traffic commodity and made it more specific by
selling visitor data to advertisers. The cases discussed in
this article show instead how data centre operators are
attempting to create surplus value from the flows of
data in the network and the need to process them and
Velkova 7
assure their stability rather than from the flows of vis-
itors or audiences. This shift in focus signifies that digi-
tal data is starting to be valued by data centre operators
first of all as a source of content or information that
can be valorised back online, and then again, as a raw
material that has to increase and flow perpetually in the
network in order to stabilise it and generate energy to
sell in urban areas. A logical implication is to see the
appearance of novel media practices that could poten-
tially fill the emerging infrastructures of waste heat cir-
culation with computation traffic.
Second, valorising waste heat arguably integrates the
data centre industry with the energy sector. Yet, this
integration does not happen by generating truly green
energy. Even if the data industry claims to be an active
agent against global warming that reduces its carbon
footprint by creating infrastructural loops of renewable
heat, none of the approaches discussed in this article
provide an actual alternative to polluting energy
sources that power data centres with electricity, such
as coal. Rather, the data centre industry relies on the
existing sources of power available in each specific loca-
tion, and these can differ substantially.2 Nor do data
centre operators reduce the amount of electricity
needed to power a data centre. Instead, the claimed
energy efficiency through valorising waste heat trans-
lates into economic efficiency for the data centre oper-
ators, which decrease their maintenance costs while
expanding their sphere of influence, by introducing
server waste heat as a competing resource to other
forms of recycled waste, such as biomass used for heat-
ing. Hence, data centre operators do not offset the
environmental problems that the industry generates,
but rather reshape the discourse around it. Rather
than an image of powerful actors who change our epis-
temological orientation in the world, the operators of
data centres are redefined culturally into providers of
desired infrastructures that are needed for a sustain-
able, fossil-free future. In effect, data production
becomes connected with imaginaries of an environmen-
tally responsible global citizenship and illustrates how
infrastructures can produce specific citizens (Larkin,
2013; Von Schnitzler, 2008), who have to keep creating
data for the improvement of everyone's well-being.
In the context of these developments, there are
nevertheless some structural constraints to these shifts
in the meaning and value of data that need to be
acknowledged.
The convergence between the data centre industry
and urban heating infrastructures is dependent on a
well developed and broadly used district heating
system. In Europe it is the Nordic, Baltic and some
Eastern European countries that have more than half
of the population heated in this way and serviced by
fibre optic internet, making them potentially attractive
locations for such approaches. Other European regions,
likewise rural areas have limited or no access to district
heating, and a much less developed fibre optic connect-
ivity (Euroheat and Power, 2015; European
Commission, 2015). This unequal geographical distribu-
tion poses limits for where data and heat infrastructures
can converge, yet makes certain locations, particularly
major cities in the Nordic countries, into potentially
more important data and energy nodes in the future.
On the other hand, the possibility to create a distrib-
uted data centre depends on the abilities of the data
industry to make specific arrangements with major
actors in the telecom industry. In order for Qarnot com-
puting to be able to heat homes with computation, it had
to enter into a partnership with Orange, a large telecom
and fibre optic cable operator in France, which installed
dedicated fibre optics in selected buildings on top of
existing fibre optic connectivity as a way to secure a reli-
able and fast link to the Q.radsi. Similarly, Bahnhof in
Sweden rents dark fibre from the municipal company
Stokab and Skanova, a private holding for its own ser-
vices. Therewith, the potential for making distributed
data and heating infrastructure is dependent on the tele-
com switching and backbone industry which determines
its outreach and speed of expansion.
These dependencies ultimately illuminate the import-
ance of the geographical locations where the data pro-
cessing industry becomes an energy provider, and how
they contribute to sustain and reproduce existing digital
divides and politics of access. The new generation of
energy efficient data centres seem to be the ones located
in the colder climate zones of the fibre-abundant global
North, pushing the need for further investment in rapid
and reliable connections there, while solidifying the
rural network edge as a periphery and a host of
larger yet less efficient, slower and polluting data pro-
cessing facilities.
The present analysis suggests that there are a range
of issues arising from the currently decentralising and
converging data centre infrastructures which require
further critical analysis as their operators experiment
with diverse schemes to commodify waste heat. This
article is a modest attempt to start such a discussion
and hopes to prompt further critical engagement with
the expanding infrastructures of big data as they get
integrated into realms beyond the online.

Notes
1. Data from email exchange with Qarnot computing, July
2016.
2. It should be noted that the energy sources that power the
data centre infrastructures differ across Europe.
Particularly in the Nordic countries, as well as Malta,
Latvia, Lithuania and Portugal, energy is generated
mostly from renewable sources. In other countries, such
as Estonia, Poland and Greece, solid fuels are most preva-
lent (Eurostat, 2016). This means that the energy sources
powering data centre infrastructures in Europe generally
vary from country to country. In the examples discussed
here, the primary energy sources are nuclear and
hydropower.
