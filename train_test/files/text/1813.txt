In a recent study of older participants (age >60 years) in the
1999­2002 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES), we showed that a combination of high serum folate and
low vitamin B12 status was associated with higher prevalence of
cognitive impairment and anemia than other combinations of
vitamin B12 and folate status. In the present study, we sought to
determine the joint influence of serum folate and vitamin B12
concentrations on two functional indicators of vitamin B12 status,
total homocysteine (tHcy) and methylmalonic acid (MMA), among
adult participants in phase 2 of the NHANES III (1991­1994) and the
NHANES 1999­2002. Exclusion of subjects who were <20 years old,
were pregnant, had evidence of kidney or liver dysfunction, or
reported a history of alcohol abuse or recent anemia therapy left
4,940 NHANES III participants and 5,473 NHANES 1999­2002 par-
ticipants for the study. Multivariate analyses controlled for demo-
graphic factors, smoking, alcohol use, body mass index, self-
reported diabetes diagnosis, and serum concentrations of
creatinine and alanine aminotransferase revealed significant in-
teractions between serum folate and serum vitamin B12 in relation
to circulating concentrations of both metabolites. In subjects with
serum vitamin B12 >148 pmol/liter (L), concentrations of both
metabolites decreased significantly as serum folate increased. In
subjects with lower serum vitamin B12, however, metabolite con-
centrations increased as serum folate increased starting at 20
nmol/L. These results suggest a worsening of vitamin B12's enzy-
matic functions as folate status increases in people who are vitamin
B12-deficient.
NHANES  cobalamin  methionine synthase  L-methylmalonyl-CoA mutase
Vitamin B12
participates as a coenzyme in two reactions, the
remethylation of homocysteine (Hcy) to methionine and the
isomerization of L-methylmalonyl-CoA to succinyl-CoA (1­3).
The former reaction is catalyzed by methionine synthase in the
cytosol, and the latter is catalyzed by L-methylmalonyl-CoA
mutase in the mitochondria. Vitamin B12
deficiency is associated
with anemia, megaloblastosis, neuropathy, and neuropsychiatric
disorders (4), all of which could theoretically be linked to the
block in Hcy remethylation or the resulting hyperhomocysteine-
mia (5). However, the block in the isomerization reaction and
resulting buildup of methylmalonic acid (MMA) could also play
a role (6).
Early case reports of vitamin B12
deficiency due to pernicious
anemia described the alleviation of anemia but the precipitation
or exacerbation of neurologic or neuropsychiatric sequelae after
folic acid administration, an early form of treatment based on the
mistaken idea that folate deficiency was the problem (7). How-
ever, a lack of confirmatory data from animal models or human
studies has generated controversy about the true consequences
of folic acid administration in vitamin B12
deficiency (8), which
is now known to encompass more than pernicious anemia (9, 10).
We recently examined the interaction between serum folate and
vitamin B12
status in relation to anemia, macrocytosis, and cognitive
impairment in older participants (age 60 years) in the 1999­2002
United States National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES) (11). As expected, low vitamin B12
status was associ-
ated with all three abnormalities. Furthermore, when vitamin B12
status was normal, high serum folate was related to protection from
cognitive impairment. Among those with low vitamin B12
status,
however, high serum folate was directly associated with both
anemia and cognitive impairment. Consistent with our findings for
subjects with normal vitamin B12
status, several cross-sectional
studies (12­15), as well as some prospective investigations (16­19),
have reported direct relations between folate status and cognition.
On the other hand, Morris et al. (20) found that higher folate intake
was associated with more rapid cognitive decline in a cohort of
4,000 community-dwelling elderly people whose vitamin B12
status was unknown.
In India, where vitamin B12
deficiency is common, authors of
the Pune Maternal Nutrition Study found that the combination
of high blood folate and low vitamin B12
levels during pregnancy
was associated with elevated risk of insulin resistance in the
children at age six (21). Insulin resistance is not an established
consequence of vitamin B12
deficiency, but the wide-ranging
known effects of the vitamin suggest that it also may have
unknown benefits, and its deficiency may have unknown
risks (22).
Our goal in the present study was to determine whether higher
folate status in vitamin B12
deficiency was associated with higher
circulating levels of the functional indicators of low vitamin B12
status, total (t) Hcy, and MMA.
Results
Subject Characteristics and Serum Vitamin B12. The prevalence of
serum vitamin B12
148 pmol/liter (L) was 1.6% in the
NHANES III and 2.2% in the NHANES 1999­2002. The
demographic distribution of the subjects reflected the national
representation of the survey and our focus on adults of all ages
(Table 1). Supplement use was much more common during the
more recent survey, when serum folate was also much higher,
and tHcy was lower. In both surveys, low serum vitamin B12
was
significantly less common among non-Hispanic blacks than it was
in non-Hispanic whites. Also consistent across surveys were
strong associations between low serum vitamin B12
status and
nonuse of dietary supplements, low folate status, and high tHcy
and MMA concentrations as well as at least marginally signifi-
cant associations with higher age, cigarette smoking, and lower
alanine aminotransferase concentration. A notable difference

Serum Folate and tHcy and MMA. Among participants in both
surveys, serum folate interacted significantly with serum vitamin
B12
in relation to tHcy (NHANES III, P  0.002; NHANES
1999­2002, P  0.005). Specifically, although geometric mean
Hcy decreased across increasing serum folate categories among
survey participants in both surveys with serum vitamin B12
148
pmol/L (P  0.001), a decreasing trend across all serum folate
categories was not observed for subjects with serum vitamin B12
148 pmol/L (Fig. 1). The highest geometric mean tHcy that we
estimated was for the NHANES III participants with serum
vitamin B12
148 pmol/L and serum folate in the low-to-
deficient range. Furthermore, geometric mean tHcy for
NHANES 1999­2002 subjects with low serum vitamin B12
and
serum folate 19.3 nmol/L was in the normal range and close to
that of subjects in the same serum folate category with higher
serum vitamin B12
(Table 2). However, the mean for the group
with low serum vitamin B12
and serum folate 32.6 nmol/L was
nearly 12 mol/L, a commonly used cut-off point for hyperho-
mocysteinemia. In fact, in subjects with serum B12
148pmol/L,
tHcy increased significantly across the four serum folate cate-
gories represented in the NHANES 1999­2002 (P  0.003).
Serum folate interacted significantly with serum vitamin B12
in relation to serum MMA concentrations only for participants
in the NHANES 1999­2002 (P  0.003). Among participants in
that survey with serum vitamin B12
148 pmol/L, geometric
mean serum MMA increased significantly across categories of
increasing serum folate (P  0.008), while a modest but signif-
icant decrease in MMA with increasing serum folate was ob-
served among subjects with serum vitamin B12
148 pmol/L
(P  0.001). Although no significant trends emerged for partic-
ipants in the NHANES III, the data for subjects in the two
surveys with serum vitamin B12
148 pmol/L suggested a
decrease in serum MMA as serum folate increased up to a point,
but highly elevated MMA concentrations at serum folate con-
centrations 19.3 nmol/L.
Discussion
Associations between low vitamin B12
status and both hyperho-
mocysteinemia and elevated MMA concentrations are well
established, as is an inverse relation between folate status and

circulating Hcy under normal circumstances. A possible link
between folate status and MMA has not been considered,
because folate is not known to participate in pathways affecting
MMA accumulation. In this study of the general United States
population spanning pre- and postfolate fortification eras, we
found that tHcy does not generally decrease with increasing
folate status among people with low serum vitamin B12
concen-
trations. On the contrary, in people with low serum B12
con-
centrations, high tHcy levels were found at both very low and
very high serum folate levels, with lower tHcy levels in between.
Furthermore, whereas MMA data for people with low levels of
both vitamin B12
and folate were limited, the MMA results were
consistent with the tHcy results in revealing a narrow range of
folate values associated with near-normal metabolite levels and
elevated metabolite levels among those with low and high folate
concentrations.
In vitamin B12
deficiency, high tHcy reflects impaired methi-
onine synthase activity, whereas high MMA indicates impaired
methylmalonyl-CoA mutase activity. Consequently, our findings
suggest that both pathways of vitamin B12
metabolism are
adversely affected by high serum folate despite the direct
involvement of folate only in methionine synthase activity.
Simultaneous impairment of both pathways is normally caused
by vitamin B12
deficiency or by the disruption of those early steps
in vitamin B12
processing that are common in both pathways (1,
23): (i) the intrinsic factor mediated B12
absorption by the
intestine; (ii) formation of the B12
-transcobalamin II complex in
plasma; (iii) transport of the complex into peripheral tissue by a
receptor-mediated endocytosis and incorporation of the com-
plex into the lysosomes; (iv) dissociation of the complex and exit
of vitamin B12
, in the form of acquocob(III)alamin, into the
cytosol; and (v) reduction to cob(II)alamin for subsequent
migration either for association with the methionine synthase
(MS) in the cytosol or to enter the mitochondria.
It is difficult to envision how folate could interfere with any
of these steps. The alternate possibility is that this interference
occurs after the diversion of the vitamin to the respective
compartments in the course of rendering the vitamin available
for interaction with the respective enzyme proteins or during
catalysis. In the cytosol, the cob(II)alamin associates with the
MS to form a cob(II)alamin­MS complex. This complex is then
reduced by a closely associated enzyme, methionine synthase
reductase (MTR) to form a cob(I)alamin­MS that is catalytically
active. The MS enzyme contains a binding site for 5-methyltet-
rahydrofolate, which is more specific for polyglutamyl derivatives
(2). In the enzyme catalysis, the cob(I)alamin acquires a methyl
group from bound 5-methyltetrahydrofolate by means of an
oxidation addition mechanism forming a methyl­cob(III)alamin
prosthetic group (24). This bond between the methyl group and
the cobalt ion is then cleaved heterolytically, leaving both
bonding electrons on the cob(I)alamin and transferring the
methyl group to homocysteine in the form of a carbocation,
CH3
 (24). Cob(I)alamin is remethylated by 5-methyltetrahy-
drofolate. However, the enzyme-bound cob(I)alamin occasion-
ally becomes oxidized to cob(II)alamin, and this enzyme form is
catalytically inactive. The enzyme is reactivated by a reductive
methylation in which the methyl group is derived from adeno-
sylmethionine (25).
In the mitochondria, the cob(II)alamin undergoes a reduction
to cob(I)alamin by an electron donor followed by adenosylation
in a reaction that involves ATP, to form the 5-deoxyadenosyl-
cob(III)alamin (Adenosylcobalamin) (1, 2, 23). This is then
associated with the mutase by the action of adenosyltransferase.
A mitochondrial protein, methylmalonic aciduria cblA type
protein (MMAA), associates with the mutase to protect the
mutase from inactivation (26).
In the MMA­CoA mutase reaction, the bond between the
methylene group of 5-deoxyadenosine and the cobalt ion un-
dergoes homolytic cleavage, thus resulting in free radicals both
on the methylene group and the cobalt ion. The free radical on
the methylene group is transferred to the MMA­CoA molecule
to allow isomerization to succinyl-CoA, which is accompanied by
the transfer of the free radical back onto the methylene group for
subsequent rebonding with the cobalt ion (1, 2, 23).
Although the reduction of cob(II)alamin to cob(I)alamin
occurs in both compartments, the process is substantially dif-
ferent for the two. In the cytosol, this reduction takes place while
cob(II)alamin is bound to the enzyme. In the mitochondrion, on
the other hand, this reduction precedes the association of the
mutase. This difference and the fact that these reductions occur
in separate compartments render it difficult to envision inter-
ference by folate.
Another possibility is that folate interferes with the catalytic
action of MS, and the impairment of the mutase is secondary to
the interaction with the MS. This possibility would be analogous
to the observed effects of nitric oxide on B12
metabolism. Nitric
oxide is a strong oxidizing agent that irreversibly inactivates
methionine synthase by oxidizing enzyme-bound vitamin B12
to
form a free radical (27). There is no known direct effect of
nitrous oxide on the mutase. Nevertheless, both humans who

inhaled the gas and laboratory animals subjected to prolonged
exposure had elevated plasma and spinal fluid levels of not only
tHcy but also MMA (28­32).
Using a methionine-independent human glioma cell line
(P60H), Reidel et al. (33) showed that exposure to nitrous oxide
resulted in cellular depletion of methylcobalamin and, after a lag
period, decreased adenosylcobalamin and conversion of the
mutase holoenzyme to its apoenzyme. These data suggest a
coordinate distribution of cobalamin cofactors between the
mitochondria and the cytosol compartments.
High serum folate as encountered in this study was attribut-
able to high intake of folic acid from supplements and fortified
food, which undoubtedly resulted in the appearance of unme-
tabolized folic acid in plasma (34, 35). In the Framingham Study,
the percent of folate consumed as folic acid increased sharply as
plasma folate increased, from 50% among those with plasma
folate 30 nmol/L to 80% among those with plasma folate 50
nmol/L (S. Choumenkovitch, P.F.J., and J.S., unpublished work).
A high intake of folic acid in vitamin B12
deficiency would
change the concentration and character of cellular folate, par-
ticularly tetrahydrofolate (36). A central hypothesis to account
for the observed effect of folic acid intake in the remission of the
hematological complications in pernicious anemia is that the flux
of unmethylated folate into the bone marrow cells circumvents
the inhibition of DNA synthesis caused by the trapping of folate
coenzymes as methyltetrahydrofolate (37). Folate coenzymes
participating in DNA synthesis include formylated tetrahydro-
folate, which is used for purine synthesis, and 5,10- methylenetet-
rahydrofolate, which is used for thymidylate synthesis. Unsub-
stituted tetrahydrofolate and dihydrofolate are the respective
products of these syntheses.
A common denominator for some of these folates is that they
can serve as electron acceptors or oxidation agents. Formylated
tetrahydrofolate can be reduced to 5,10- methylenetetrahydro-
folate; 5,10- methylenetetrahydrofolate can be reduced to
5-methyltetrahydrofolate, whereas folic acid and dihydrofolate
acquire electrons for conversion to tetrahydrofolate. Based on
these properties, it is tempting to suggest that folic acid or its
partially reduced form, dihydrofolate, as well as formylated and
methylene tetrahydrofolate could act as electron acceptors and
thereby accelerate the rate of oxidation of MS cob(I)alamin to
MS cob(II)alamin. The enzyme activity could be even more
compromised because of the lower S-adenosylmethionine
(SAM) availability and lower enzyme synthesis due to B12
deficiency (38, 39).
This proposed interaction between folate derivatives (folic
acid, dihydrofolate, etc.) and a heterologous protein (i.e., MS) is
not unprecedented: 5-methyltetrahdrofolate is an activator of
cystathionine -synthase in Neurospora crassa (40), an inhibitor
of glycine methyltransferase in mammalian systems (41), and
binds to cytosolic serine hydroxymethylase (42). Binding to
serine hydroxymethylase is associated with diminished synthesis
of methionine and diversion of the flow of one carbon units
toward thymidylate synthesis. Dihydrofolate is a competitive
inhibitor of pig liver methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase
(MTHFR) (43). In all cases, these associations are enhanced
when the respective folates are polyglutamated, which is con-
sistent with the idea that the great majority of folate enzymes
have a common binding site for the glutamic acid side chain. As
pointed out above, MS also contains a binding site for methyl-
tetrahydrofolate and its product, tetrahydrofolate (2).
Based on this paradigm, we propose that the high serum MMA
associated with the combination of low B12
status and high
plasma folate status stems from the disruption of B12
hemostasis
in the mitochondria, analogous to the effect of nitric oxide.
In conclusion, we have extended the findings of our recently
published study of the interaction between vitamin B12
status
and folate status in relation to anemia, macrocytosis, and
cognitive impairment (11) by demonstrating that, among people
with low serum vitamin B12
concentrations, high plasma folate
is associated with higher concentrations of the two functional
indicators of impaired B12
status, Hcy and MMA. These obser-
vations provide a possible biochemical explanation for high folic
acid intake's exacerbation of the clinical manifestations of
vitamin B12
deficiency.
Methods
Study Population. The NHANES, which is currently implemented
as a continuous annual survey, monitors the nation's health and
nutritional status by using a complex multistage probability design
to select a representative sample of the noninstitutionalized United
States civilian population. To increase the precision of estimates
derived from the survey, adolescents, the elderly, Mexican Amer-
icans, and blacks are oversampled. The protocols for conducting the
NHANES were approved by the institutional review board of the
National Center for Health Statistics, Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention, and informed consent was obtained from all
participants (44). For this investigation, we used data from phase 2
(1991­1994) of the third NHANES (NHANES III) and the
NHANES conducted in 1999­2000 and 2000­2002. Consistent
with NHANES analytic guidelines, we combined data from these
latter two surveys into a single dataset (45).
Trained interviewers used a computer-assisted personal in-
terview system to interview participants in their homes. The
participants were also asked to report to a mobile examination
center (MEC) to provide further interview data and undergo a
physical examination that included phlebotomy. A detailed
description of blood collection and processing can be found in
the NHANES Phlebotomy Manual (46). Although the survey
included people of all ages, we focused our attention on adults
(i.e., those aged 19 years).
Besides participants 20 years old, we excluded pregnant
women and men and women who reported a history of heavy
alcohol use or recent anemia therapy as well as those with serum
creatinine concentration (based on Jaffe reaction) indicative of
renal dysfunction (i.e., men, 131 mol/L; women, 115
mol/L) or alanine aminotransferase 40 units/L, which sug-
gests liver disease (47). Of the 8,588 adult participants in phase
2 of the NHANES III, 4,940 were included in this study (Fig. 2).
Of the 10,291 adult participants in the NHANES 1999­2002,
5,473 were included in this study.
Biochemical Measurements. Priority analyses were carried out at
the Inorganic Toxicology and Nutrition Branch or the Division
of Laboratory Sciences, National Center for Environmental
Health, or at central laboratories that varied with survey years.
Serum concentrations of folate and vitamin B12
were measured
by using the Quantaphase II Radioassay Kit (Bio-Rad). Serum
alanine aminotransferase was measured by using an autoana-
lyzer (NHANES III, Hitachi; NHANES 1999­2001, Hitachi;
NHANES 2002, Beckman; Synchron LX20). In all survey years,
serum creatinine concentration was based on the Jaffe reaction,
but values varied greatly among the NHANES III, NHANES
1999­2000, and NHANES 2001 and 2002. Also, only the values
reported for the last 2-year period were consistent with results
using a gold-standard method (46). After Coresh et al. (48), we
subtracted 20 mol/L (0.23 mg/dl) from the NHANES III values.
We also added 11.5 mol/L (0.13 mg/dl) to the NHANES
1999­2000 values as recommended by NHANES documenta-
tion (46).
Concentrations of MMA and tHcy were measured in
NHANES III as phase 2 (1991­1994) surplus serum projects
carried out at the United States Department of Agriculture
Human Nutrition Research Center on Aging after approval by
the New England Medical Center Human Investigations Review
Committee and the Surplus Sera Bank Steering Committee.

Surplus serum samples were stored at 70°C and underwent one
to four freeze­thaw cycles before tHcy and MMA analyses. Total
Hcy and MMA concentrations have been shown to remain stable
in long-frozen samples (49, 50). In 1994, Hcy concentrations
were measured in serum samples from participants 12 years old
by the HPLC method of Araki and Sako (51). In 1998, MMA
concentrations were measured in surplus serum samples from
65-year-old participants (n  1,145) and, for comparison pur-
poses, in a random sample of available serum samples from 30-
to 39-year-old participants (n  1,026). Serum MMA concen-
trations were measured by gas chromatography/mass spectrom-
etry using the solid extraction method and derivatization with
cyclohexanol as described by Rasmussen (52).
In the NHANES 1999­2002, measurement of plasma tHcy
and MMA were priority analyses. tHcy was measured by using
a fully automated fluorescence polarization immunoassay (Ab-
bott Laboratories). Plasma levels were calculated by using a
machine- stored calibration curve (Abbott IMx analyzer, 1999­
2001; Abbott AxSYManalyzer, 2002). Plasma MMA was mea-
sured by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry with cyclohexa-
nol derivatization (53). It is important to note that MMA
measurements for the NHANES 1999­2002 were much lower
than the measurements recorded in the NHANES III. Pfeiffer
et al. (53) attributed the different MMA values obtained in the
two surveys to differences in the laboratories conducting the
analyses and the matrices and methods used.
Statistical Analyses. Data analyses were performed by using
SUDAAN release 9.0 (Research Triangle Institute) with appro-
priate sampling weights and masked variance pseudostratum and
pseudoPSU variables available from the NHANES website to
account for the survey's complex sampling design (44). P  0.05
was considered statistically significant for all tests.
We first used SUDAAN PROC REGRESS, SUDAAN
PROC CROSSTAB, and SUDAAN PROC RLOGIST to de-
scribe the qualifying participants via least-squares means and
proportions and to perform comparisons between subjects with
serum vitamin B12
below the conventional cut-off point for
deficiency of 148 pmol/L and the remaining subjects.
For our main data analyses, we used SUDAAN PROC
REGRESS to estimate least-square geometric mean (95% C.I.)
circulating tHcy and MMA for serum folate categories after
multivariate adjustment for age, gender, race/ethnicity, body
mass index, smoking status, alcohol intake, self-reported diabe-
tes diagnosis, and serum concentrations of creatinine and ala-
nine aminotransferase. These analyses were performed stratified

by vitamin B12
status after interactions between vitamin B12
status and folate status were tested. Because of the much smaller
number of subjects in the group with lower serum vitamin B12
as
compared with the number with higher serum vitamin B12
values, we used the distribution of the former group to determine
the serum folate category cut-off points.
The availability of tHcy and MMA values for NHANES III
participants allowed us to examine interrelations among folate,
vitamin B12
, and the metabolites across a broader range of folate
levels than the NHANES 1999­2002 dataset afforded given the
institution of government- mandated food folic acid fortification
between the two surveys. We made no attempt to combine data
from the NHANES III with data from the NHANES 1999­2002.
We divided participants in the 3-year second phase of the
NHANES III into three folate categories, and we divided
participants in the 4-year NHANES 1999­2002 into four folate
categories (Table 3).
