Abstract
Background: Illicit methamphetamine use continues to be a public health concern in the United
States. The goal of the current study was to use a relatively inexpensive methodology to examine
the prevalence and demographic correlates of nonmedical methamphetamine use in the United
States.
Methods: The sample was obtained through an internet survey of noninstitutionalized adults (n =
4,297) aged 18 to 49 in the United States in 2005. Propensity weighting methods using information
from the U.S. Census and the 2003 National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) were used
to estimate national-level prevalence rates.
Results: The overall prevalence of current nonmedical methamphetamine use was estimated to
be 0.27%. Lifetime use was estimated to be 8.6%. Current use rates for men (0.32%) and women
(0.23%) did not differ, although men had a higher 3-year prevalence rate (3.1%) than women (1.1%).
Within the age subgroup with the highest overall methamphetamine use (18 to 25 year olds), non-
students had substantially higher methamphetamine use (0.85% current; 2.4% past year) than
students (0.23% current; 0.79% past year). Methamphetamine use was not constrained to those
with publicly funded health care insurance.
Conclusion: Through the use of an internet panel weighted to reflect U.S. population norms, the
estimated lifetime prevalence of methamphetamine use among 18 to 49 year olds was 8.6%. These
findings give rates of use comparable to those reported in the 2005 NSDUH. Internet surveys are
a relatively inexpensive way to provide complimentary data to telephone or in-person interviews.
Background
Illicit methamphetamine use is a public health concern in
the United States with an increase in prevalence in the
1990s. Treatment admission rates for methamphetamine
use surged from 10 admissions per 100,000 in 1992 to 52
admissions per 100,000 in 2002 [1]. Prevalence rates have
largely stabilized since 2000, although a decrease in new
methamphetamine users aged 12 or over occurred

between 2004 and 2005 (from 318,000 to 192,000). The
2005 National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH)
found past year and lifetime prevalence rates of 0.5% and
4.3% [2]. About half a million Americans used metham-
phetamine in the past month [2].
While methamphetamine use in the early 1990s was pri-
marily a problem in the Western United States, the past 15
years have seen it spread across the country. In 1992, 5
states reported high rates of treatment admissions (i.e.,
>24 per 100,000 population) for primary methampheta-
mine/amphetamine problems, but by 2002, 21 states
reported high rates [1]. Epidemiological data suggest that
methamphetamine use in 2005 was highest (0.6% use in
past month) among 18 to 25 year olds [2]. From the early
to mid 1990s, methamphetamine use doubled among
high school students, particularly in Western states [3].
Long-term methamphetamine use is associated with psy-
chiatric symptoms, including drug-induced psychotic
symptoms that persist over time [4]. Additionally, in a
large sample of treatment-seeking methamphetamine
users, 27% had reported a previous suicide attempt, and
43% had reported violent behavior problems [5]. Among
methamphetamine-using arrestees in several Western cit-
ies, more than a third reported violent behavior as a con-
sequence of their use [6]. Methamphetamine use is also
associated with increased risky sexual behaviors [7] and
higher prevalence of HIV infection [8,9].
In addition to impacting the individual user, metham-
phetamine use burdens society with associated criminal
justice and health care costs. In 2000, the prevalence of
current methamphetamine use among adult male arrest-
ees was approximately 25% in 3 California cities [10].
Methamphetamine use is also highly predictive of self-
reported violent criminal behavior and recidivism among
parolees, with 82% of methamphetamine users (versus
54% of nonusers) returning to custody within 12 months
[11]. Frequent injection of crystal methamphetamine is
also associated with high rates of emergency room use
[12,13]. The medical cost for treating a patient with severe
burns related to methamphetamine production has been
estimated to be about $78,000 [14]. Despite little change
in prevalence rates since 2000, methamphetamine-related
admissions for treatment have increased steadily from
2000 (68,000) to 2004 (129,000). This may be a result of
the increased availability (in 2001) of "ice" methamphet-
amine, a smoked form of highly pure methamphetamine
that is thought to be more addictive because smoking
gives an intense high [15].
While the NSDUH offers large sample sizes (e.g., 68,305
persons aged 12 or older in 2005 [2]) to provide data on
the prevalence of illicit drugs in the United States, other
methods may provide comparable data in a more expedi-
tious fashion. Emerging trends can be verified by exami-
nation of data from additional studies. If not confirmed,
these differences can serve as the basis for further research
to explain the different findings.
Telephone surveys cost less than in-person surveys and do
not require travel to high-crime areas to interview
respondents. However, telephone surveys are increasingly
difficult to conduct due to the use of call-screening devices
and because these surveys draw their samples from land-
line telephone numbers. Random-digit dialing (RDD)
procedures allow sampling of unlisted telephone num-
bers and can be designed to increase interviewers' likeli-
hood of reaching eligible numbers. However, about 16%
of U.S. households have substituted wireless phone serv-
ice for landline phones [16].
The use of internet panels is 1 alternative to such time-
intensive surveys. In addition to lower cost and increased
speed of data collection, internet surveys have the ability
to use visual cues to assist in recall [17]. Findings from
internet surveys are increasingly being reported in the lit-
erature [18].
While internet surveys may yield a sample that is unrepre-
sentative of the target population, propensity methods
can address this problem. Weights can be applied by
adjusting responses using a propensity scoring method
that is tied to the likelihood that an internet survey
respondent would have participated in a probability sur-
vey. Further statistical adjustments can be made so that
the final weights for the internet sample agree with the
distribution of the U.S. target population on general
demographic characteristics. Nevertheless, because of the
concerns about the potential for biases due to respond-
ents self-selecting into an internet survey pool, we stress
the importance of having data from a national probability
survey as a benchmark against which to compare internet
survey findings.
In light of these issues, the current study uses data from a
nationwide internet panel to examine the prevalence and
correlates of methamphetamine use among adults aged
18 to 49 in the United States.
Methods
Study sample and procedures
Subjects were recruited from the Harris Poll Online
(HPOL) panel maintained by Harris Interactive. This
panel is composed of several million members interna-
tionally who have consented to be contacted for public
opinion surveys distributed via the internet. Participants
were noninstitutionalized civilian adults aged 18 to 49
living in the 50 states and the District of Columbia. Per-
Substance Abuse Treatment, Prevention, and Policy 2008, 3:19 http://www.substanceabusepolicy.com/content/3/1/19

sons younger than 18 were excluded because of the time
and costs involved in obtaining parental consent.
The survey was administered and collected in August 2005
through a password-protected, encrypted Web portal. All
panel members who initially met eligibility criteria
received an e-mail invitation describing the study. These
members then received a short screening questionnaire to
identify respondents according to specified target group
assignments (by age group and substance use history). If
a particular target group was not yet filled, eligible mem-
bers were further directed to a more detailed informed
consent form for participation in the full survey. Of the
11,200 HPOL participants who responded to the initial
survey invitation, 4,541 were eligible to participate in the
study and responded before their respective target groups
were filled. This group of eligible respondents included
4,297 (94.6%) members who completed the full survey
and 244 (5.4%) members who qualified but refused to
participate further. An additional 645 of the 11,200 par-
ticipants who responded to the initial invitation (5.8%)
started but did not finish the full survey.
An Institutional Review Board approved the study proce-
dures prior to data collection. Respondents who com-
pleted the survey received a $10 honorarium.
Measures
Public domain NSDUH questions served as a basis for the
substance use and demographic items used in this survey
in order to establish comparability between the estimates
of the 2 studies. Consistent with NSDUH, respondents
were asked about their most recent nonmedical metham-
phetamine use (defined as drug use without a prescription
or to induce a specific feeling or experience), except that
the NSDUH category of use "more than 12 months ago"
was split into 2 categories: 1) more than 12 months ago
but within the past 3 years and 2) more than 3 years ago.
From this question, information was obtained about use
in the past month, past 12 months, past 3 years, and any
time in the respondent's lifetime.
Statistical analysis
Descriptive statistics (frequency estimates and percentages
and related standard errors) were used to estimate popu-
lation prevalence of methamphetamine use in general
and within available demographic subgroups. Weights
(see below) were applied to convert raw percentages of
respondents to estimates for the civilian, noninstitution-
alized population of adults aged 18 to 49 living in the
United States. Weighted prevalence estimates and statisti-
cal tests were conducted using the SUDAAN Software for
Analysis of Correlated Data [19]. The DESCRIPT proce-
dure in SUDAAN was used to conduct t tests and generate
p-values from the tests. Differences between percentages
were considered to be statistically significant if the test
yielded a p-value less than .05. Because analyses were per-
formed on the entire sample, all statistical tests had 4,296
degrees of freedom.
A 2-stage weighting process was used to correct for possi-
ble selection bias within the internet panel. First, the data
were weighted according to results from a probability-
based telephone survey using a propensity scoring
approach. The propensity score adjusted for self-selection
into the online population and into the panel and for sur-
vey nonresponse that may not be explained by demo-
graphic differences. The propensity score model was
created by Harris using data from parallel telephone and
internet surveys that they periodically collect with the tel-
ephone survey based on RDD probability sampling.
Weights were created so that the weighted distribution of
the propensity score for internet respondents was
matched to the distribution for the RDD telephone
respondents. The second step in the weighting process was
to weight the data to match the U.S. target population dis-
tribution by general demographic characteristics, as well
as distribution of past month cigarette use and past
month "binge" alcohol use (i.e., consumption of 5 or
more drinks in a single occasion at least once in the past
30 days) estimated from the 2003 NSDUH, the most cur-
rent publicly available data at the time the study was con-
ducted.
For this study, a model was developed to predict the prob-
ability that a response was obtained from a selected indi-
vidual. For response probability models to be effective, we
needed to find covariates that would be related to both (a)
the likelihood that a subject was included in the study
(i.e., an internet user) and (b) the analysis outcomes
being measured in the study. Therefore, the latter 2 sub-
stance use measures were chosen because alcohol and cig-
arette use appear to be related to a respondent's likelihood
of being online [20]. Cigarette use and "binge" alcohol
use also appear to be related to the likelihood of illicit
drug use (2). Further details of the weighting process are
given elsewhere [21].
Demographic characteristics of the sample and weighted
population percentages also have been described previ-
ously [21]. Briefly, the study design for the data set used in
this paper favored the inclusion of nonmedical users of
prescription drugs used in the treatment of attention-def-
icit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Consequently, young
adults aged 18 to 25 were overrepresented in the sample
(77% versus 23% for adults aged 26 to 49). However, the
weighting procedures reversed this overrepresentation of
young adults to reflect their representation in the popula-
tion (weighted percentages of 24% for young adults and
76% for adults aged 26 to 49). Persons who were white
Substance Abuse Treatment, Prevention, and Policy 2008, 3:19 http://www.substanceabusepolicy.com/content/3/1/19

(and not of Hispanic origin) also were overrepresented in
the sample (sample percentage of 77% for whites versus a
weighted population percentage of 66%). Males were
slightly underrepresented in the sample (43% of the sam-
ple versus a weighted percentage of 49%).
Results
The overall weighted prevalence of lifetime nonmedical
methamphetamine use among persons aged 18 to 49 was
8.63% (Table 1). In the past year, the weighted prevalence
was 0.71%, and the prevalence of current use (past
month) was 0.27%. However, these overall rates masked
important differences among subgroups.
Young adults aged 18 to 25 were significantly more likely
than older adults aged 26 to 49 to have used methamphet-
amine in the past year (t = 3.53, p = .0004). The prevalence
of use in the past 3 years did not differ significantly by age
group. The lifetime rate was somewhat higher among the
26 to 49 year olds, as might be expected given the greater
number of years in which older adults had the opportu-
nity to have used at least once. However, this difference
was not statistically significant.
Prevalence rates did not differ significantly by gender for
any period. Within the age group with the highest rates of
methamphetamine use (18 to 25 year olds), men and
women also had comparable prevalence rates (Figure 1);
none of the differences between men and women in this
age group were significant.
Those without a high school degree were nearly 4 times
more likely to be lifetime methamphetamine users com-
pared with college graduates (t = 2.03, p = .04). High
school graduates and those with some college had similar
weighted lifetime prevalence rates, but the rates for both
of these groups were not significantly different from the
prevalence rate for those without a high school degree. For
the past 3 years and past year, the prevalence rates did not
vary significantly by education level. In terms of current
use, the pattern of use in regard to education was quite dif-
ferent than that seen for lifetime use. There was a trend for
increased current use with higher education: 0.21% cur-
rent use among high school graduates, 0.31% among
those with some college, and 0.47% among college grad-
uates. However, these weighted prevalence rates were not
significantly different (i.e., t = 0.48, p = .63 for high school
graduates versus adults with some college, t = 0.58, p = .56
for adults with some college versus college graduates, and
t = 0.86, p = .39 for high school graduates versus college
graduates). The weighted prevalence rate for current use
among those without a high school degree was very low.
Although this estimate also was imprecise (SE: 0.02), it
was significantly different from the estimate for those with
some college (t = 2.44, p = .01).

As shown in Figure 2, young adults aged 18 to 25 who
were not currently enrolled as students were more likely
than their counterparts, who were students, to have used
methamphetamine in the past year (t = 2.51, p = .01) and
in the past 3 years (t = 2.51, p = .01). Although non-stu-
dents in this age group appeared to be about 4 times more
likely than students to be current users, this difference was
not significant (t = 1.65, p = .10). Rates of lifetime use also
were not significantly different between students and
non-students.
Although rates of methamphetamine use in the lifetime
and past 3 years appeared to be higher among persons
without health insurance compared with persons with
private or other insurance (Figure 3), these differences
were not significant. There were no significant differences
between insurance status groups for methamphetamine
use in any period.
Discussion
Data from this study suggest that at the time of the survey
collection (August 2005) 8.6% of the U.S. population
aged 18 to 49 had used methamphetamine at least once,
and 2.1% had used it in the past 3 years. However, only
0.7% used methamphetamine in the past year, and 0.3%
were current users. Other key findings of this survey are 1)
the prevalence of past year use was nearly 5 times greater
among the 18- to 25-year-old age group than in the 26- to
49-year-old group; 2) methamphetamine use was not
exclusively a problem for men, with current use preva-
lence rates being similar for men and women; 3) non-stu-
dents within the 18- to 25-year-old age group were more
likely than students in this age group to be methamphet-
amine users in the past year and past 3 years; 4) more than
1 in 5 adults aged 18 to 49 without a high school degree
(20.6%) had used methamphetamine at least once in
their lifetime; and 5) while uninsured individuals
appeared to have elevated lifetime and past 3 year preva-
lence rates relative to privately insured individuals, there
were no significant differences in methamphetamine use,
in any timeframe by insurance status.
The 2005 NSDUH, which spanned the timeframe of the
current internet survey, reported lifetime rates of metham-
phetamine use of 4.3% among Americans aged 12 or
older and 4.6% among persons aged 18 or older [2,22].
Rates of lifetime methamphetamine use among adult age
groups were 5.2% for those 18 to 25, 4.8% for those aged
26 to 34, and 4.5% for those aged 35 or older [22].

to 25 year olds, a comparable age group in both studies,
were somewhat higher in the present study than in
NSDUH, rates in these 2 studies among young adults were
similar for the past year and past month.
Demographic correlates of methamphetamine use also
were similar in the NSDUH and the present internet sur-
vey. Combined data from the 2002 through 2004
NSDUHs [23] and the present study found that past year
methamphetamine use was more prevalent in the 18- to
25-year-old age group. In addition, the 2005 NSDUH
reported past year methamphetamine use among college
students (aged 18 to 22) in 2005 of 0.5% compared to
0.8% for noncollege students in that age range [22].
Although the present internet survey used a slightly differ-
ent age range (18 to 25), we observed significantly lower
rates of past year methamphetamine use among students
compared with non-students.
Combined data from the 2002 through 2004 NSDUHs
also found a somewhat higher annual average rate of past
year methamphetamine use among males aged 18 to 25
(1.8%), compared with 1.4% of females in this age group
[23]. The present study also estimated a past year rate of
about 1.8% for young adult males but estimated compa-
rable rates among young adults by gender.
In addition, the sample size of the current study (n =
4,297), while still fairly large, may not have had sufficient
power to detect statistically significant differences
between demographic subgroups for a relatively low-prev-
alence drug such as methamphetamine. For example, the
higher prevalence of current use among 18 to 25 year olds
compared with 26 to 49 year olds approached but did not
reach statistical significance (p = .07). In comparison,
there were more than 67,700 completed interviews each
year in the combined NSDUH data for 2002 through
2004 [23].
Although data from the 2003 NSDUH were used in the
final weight adjustments, methamphetamine use was not
1 of the variables used in the weighting for the present
study. Further, the NSDUH results discussed in this article
are principally from the 2005 survey. Therefore, the com-
parability of our findings on methamphetamine use with
those from NSDUH bolsters our confidence in our find-
ings based on the use of a large, national, probability sur-
vey as a benchmark for calibrating our estimates.
Underreporting of methamphetamine use may be 1 issue
for both studies (and for survey measurement of metham-
phetamine use in general) when questions about use of
this substance are asked in conjunction with questions

about nonmedical use of prescription drugs. Although
methamphetamine can be available in prescription form,
most methamphetamine that is now used in the United
States is produced illegally in the United States or abroad
[23].
In recognition of this issue, the 2005 NSDUH included
additional questions to evaluate potential underreporting
of methamphetamine use [2]. These new questions were
asked in a "noncore" module separate from the "core"
prescription stimulant use module; NSDUH includes
"core" modules whose content is designed to stay con-
stant across survey years to measure drug use trends and
noncore modules that can change from 1 year to the next
[2].
When analyses combined positive responses to these non-
core questions with data from the core methampheta-
mine questions, the NSDUH yielded lifetime prevalence
rates of 8.4% among 18 to 25 year olds and 6.6% among
persons aged 26 or older, compared with rates of 5.2% for
18 to 25 year olds and 5.3% for 26 to 49 year olds based
on the core data [2]. In terms of current (past month) use,
the 2005 NSDUH estimated a rate of 0.60% among 18 to
25 year olds using their core questions, but this rate
increased to 0.83% when the noncore questions were
added [2].
This issue also is relevant to the present internet survey
because the methamphetamine use questions in this
study were taken directly from the core methampheta-
mine questions in NSDUH and were asked in the context
of questions about prescription drugs. Among persons
aged 18 to 25, our estimate of lifetime methamphetamine
use (6.0% with a standard error of 1.0) fell between the
2005 NSDUH estimate of 5.2% based on the core data
and 8.4% based on core and noncore data, though closer
to the former. The estimate of current methamphetamine
use in this age group (0.6%) was the same as that in the
2005 NSDUH based on the core data. These findings sug-
gest that a similar effect on methamphetamine estimates
due to the placement of the methamphetamine questions
in the context of questions about prescription drugs may
have occurred in the present survey.

We also recognize concerns about biases in the use of a
nonprobability sample to make inferences about use of
drugs such as methamphetamine in a broader population.
In our study, therefore, it was important that we had a
nationally representative probability survey such as
NSDUH that we could use in weighting our data and as a
benchmark against which to compare our results. In par-
ticular, comparisons between estimates from the present
internet study and the 2005 NSDUH for methampheta-
mine and other drug use variables that were not used in
the weighting procedures suggested that the 2-stage
weighting process in the present study yielded estimates
that were comparable with those from NSDUH [21].
However, we are not suggesting that internet studies such
as this should (or can) replace the need for large, epidemi-
ologic surveys from probability samples. In fact, some sur-
veys, particularly lengthy ones such as NSDUH that cover
a wide range of topics and average 1 hour in interview
time, would not be acceptable for an internet survey for-
mat. Thus, in general, internet surveys should be used in a
targeted way to complement rather than replace findings
from other data sources.
Keeping in mind the limitations of internet studies, we
can suggest that regular internet surveys be considered by
states as a methodology for collecting data on metham-
phetamine or other drug use. At the national level, several
ongoing telephone or in-person surveys (e.g., NSDUH,
Monitoring the Future) already exist to monitor trends in
methamphetamine use. States, however, may find inter-
net surveys to be a promising option for collecting infor-
mation rapidly and at relatively less cost. The speed and
reduced cost of internet surveys may be particularly
important when data relevant to a timely policy issue,
such as enactment of legislation related to methampheta-
mine, is required.
The specific cost for internet surveys likely varies with the
content and length of the questionnaire, the groups being
targeted, the targeted sample size, the length of time
required to get the targeted number of interviews, and
other factors. The cost advantage of internet surveys lies
primarily with the fact that this methodology does not
require interviewer labor, which is a key cost component
of household surveys that are conducted in-person or via
telephone. In these other survey methods, interviewer
labor is required for screening sampled units (i.e., house-
holds, telephone numbers), recontacting households or
individuals in which no one has responded or the sample
member is not available, and conducting the interview
with sample members who consent to be interviewed. In
the current study, the full survey was expected on average
to take 20 minutes to complete. Not counting interviewer
labor for screening or for multiple recontact attempts,
completion of a 20-minute telephone or in-person survey
for 4,300 respondents would require more than 1,400
hours of labor just for interviewing.
Another cost advantage for internet surveys is that there
are no data entry costs. Other methods of electronic data
capture, such as computer-assisted telephone interviewing
(CATI) or computer assisted personal interviewing
(CAPI), are sometimes used for noninternet surveys.
Many studies, however, continue to use paper-and-pencil
methods that require considerable time for data entry and
checking. In addition, use of CAPI for in-person surveys
requires the purchase or availability of a fleet of laptop
computers for data collection, and the interviewers need
to transmit the data for merging into a data file; in an
internet survey, the respondent supplies the necessary
hardware and software. Telephone interviews that use
CATI would have costs associated with any long-distance
calling.
A final cost issue is the ability of an internet survey design
to target specific population subgroups to collect informa-
tion rapidly and efficiently. In the survey that yielded the
current data on methamphetamine use, 4,300 responses
were obtained in only 3 weeks' time. A telephone survey
would likely require months rather than weeks to achieve
that number of interviews.
Additional research using national probability samples
and focusing on methamphetamine use would be helpful
to confirm the current findings. In particular, the current
study targeted nonmedical users of prescription medica-
tions rather than methamphetamine and used a nonprob-
ability design. Consequently, additional research using
probability samples or a future internet survey design tar-
geting methamphetamine users and that is benchmarked
to a national probability survey such as NSDUH also
could increase the yield of methamphetamine users for
further analyses. Given the breadth of topics that surveys
such as NSDUH cover, future internet surveys that are cal-
ibrated to national probability surveys could be helpful as
formative research for generating hypotheses and explor-
ing topics related to methamphetamine use in greater
depth.
Conclusion
This study used an internet panel weighted to reflect U.S.
population norms to estimate the prevalence of metham-
phetamine use among 18 to 49 year olds. The lifetime
weighted prevalence was 8.6%, the past year weighted
prevalence was 0.71%, and the prevalence of current use
(past month) was 0.27%. These findings give rates of use
comparable to those reported in the 2005 NSDUH. Inter-
net surveys provide a rapid, relatively inexpensive way of
obtaining data that may help inform policy decisions.

Author Note
Findings that were recently released from the 2006
NSDUH, subsequent to the initial preparation of this
manuscript, took into account additional items on meth-
amphetamine that were added to the survey in 2006.
These additional items identified respondents who did
not report methamphetamine use earlier in the core stim-
ulants module because they did not think of it as a pre-
scription stimulant. Based on these data, estimates of
lifetime methamphetamine use in 2006 were 6.42% for
young adults aged 18 to 25 and 6.26% for adults aged 26
or older. Respective estimates of past year use for these 2
age groups were 1.69% and 0.61%. The 2006 NSDUH
national findings report also presented the results of trend
adjustment procedures based on the items from the 2006
survey (see Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services
Administration. [2007]. Results from the 2006 National Sur-
vey on Drug Use and Health: National Findings [Office of
Applied Studies, NSDUH Series H-32, DHHS Publication
No. SMA 07-4293]. Rockville, MD).
