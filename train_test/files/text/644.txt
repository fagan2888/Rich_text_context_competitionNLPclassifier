Objectives. The goal of the study was to show that cross-sectional and longitudinal data yield dramatically different answers
to a basic question: "How did older persons fare in the recovery years of the 1980s?"
Methods. The United States Panel Study of Income Dynamics and the German Socio-Economic Panel are used cross-
sectionally to capture changes in the economic well-being of older persons in the trough and peak years of the 1980s business
cycle, and longitudinally to trace how the economic well-being of a given cohort of older persons changed over those years. Kernel
density estimation is then used to show how the distribution of economic well-being of these populations changed over these years.
Results. Cross-sectional comparisons confirm that persons aged 65 and over in the peak year were better off than persons aged
65 and over in the trough year in both countries. Longitudinal comparisons, however, show that persons aged 65 and over in the
trough year who survived to the peak year received a substantially smaller share of the rewards of economic recovery than cross-
sectional comparisons imply. Moreover, the entire income distribution of older persons in the United States shifted downwards.
Discussion. Compositional changes in the cross-sectional data, caused by the entry of high-income persons who are young
in the peak year but old in the trough year, obscure the decline in the economic well-being of the cohort of older persons who
survived the trough year, in cross-sectional comparisons of older populations in the United States in the 1980s.
MOST analyses of how economic well-being and income
distribution changed in the United States and in other na-
tions over the 1980s and the early 1990s are based on compar-
isons of cross-sectional data. (See Levy & Murnane, 1992, for a
review of the United States literature, and Gottschalk &
Smeeding, 1997, for a review of such studies in an international
context.)
Although much can be learned from these studies, the nature
of the data used limits the scope of the questions that can be an-
swered. Cross-sectional data provide a useful way of compar-
ing groups in a given year--e.g., workers, older people, chil-
dren--with similarly defined groups in another year. However,
such comparisons may not accurately describe how a given age
cohort has fared over the period. Cross-sectional comparisons
between two years potentially mix compositional changes
within the age groups with age and period effects. To follow the
fortunes of a specific group of people over time, it is necessary
to use longitudinal data. While these two alternative data
sources may lead to the same conclusions, they need not do so.
As we will show, it is critical to recognize the difference in
these two perspectives of how economic fortunes change when
considering the economic well-being of older persons. In both
the United States and Germany, policymakers are contemplat-
ing reforms in their social security retirement systems to reduce
thefinancialpressure that their aging baby boom cohorts will
bring to those systems over the next three decades. (For a sum-
mary of such changes in Germany, see Heese, 1997. For a sum-
mary of such changes in the United States, see Quinn &
Mitchell, 1996.)
In their deliberations it is inevitable that the economic well-
being of older populations will be considered. Cross-sectional
comparisons of older persons between two years will mix po-
tential changes from several different sources. Foremost among
these compositional changes within the older age population
are changes in average age, race, and education, each of which
can influence average measured income. These compositional
effects make it possible that cross-sectional and longitudinal
measures of the economic well-being of elderly people will di-
verge considerably between two years. Policymakers should be
aware of what is driving these changes as they draw inferences
about how proposed policy changes will impact on the older
population.
Here we show how the economic well-being of older per-
sons in the United States and Germany changed over the
growth period of the 1980s business cycle, contrasting cross-
sectional views of these changes with longitudinal analyses,
which follow the same individuals over the period. We chose a
period of economic growth in both countries to compare the
economic well-being of older persons during a period of simi-
lar macroeconomic conditions between the two countries and
to provide a conservative measure of the absolute loss in eco-
nomic well-being associated with aging. We assumed that while
the income of younger persons would rise as the economy
grows, other things equal, the income of older persons should
also grow. This growth should offset to some degree the loss of
income normally associated with the later part of the life cycle.
In both countries, longitudinal analyses yield much more
pessimistic outcomes than cross-sectional comparisons.

However, in the United States older cohorts are found to have
become absolutely worse off during this period of economic
growth as well as relatively worse off compared to younger per-
sons. We show that the decline in the income of older people in
the United States during the growth period of the 1980s is
masked by compositional changes in the older populations con-
tained in the two cross-sections.
METHODS
Data
The data used in both the cross-sectional and longitudinal
analyses are from the United States Panel Study of Income
Dynamics (PSID) and the 1997 English Language Public Use
File of the German Socio-Economic Panel (GSOEP). Our analy-
sis will show how the fruits of economic growth were dis-
tributed during the approximate trough-to-peak years of the
1980s business cycle. Because business cycle troughs and peaks
in the two countries occurred over slightly different years, we
use the years that mark the deepest part of the recession and the
highest point of the subsequent peak in each country rather than
comparing the same calendar years. We chose our trough and
peak years based on macroeconomic indicators of real gross
domestic product, real personal income, and the unemployment
rate. For the United States, the period of observation is 1983
through 1989. For Germany, the analysis covers 1984 through
1991.
We used the 1984 and 1990 waves of the PSID, which pro-
vide income information for the years 1983 and 1989, for both
our cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses for U.S. elders.
The PSID contains information on approximately 19,500 indi-
viduals over this period. In the cross-sectional analyses, the
data samples for 1984 and 1990 contain all observations in the
PSID that have nonzero sampling weights. Thus, there are indi-
viduals in the 1984 sample who are not present in the 1990
sample, and vice versa. The longitudinal sample comprises the
14,923 individuals who are in both the 1984 and 1990 waves of
the PSID. In the longitudinal case, the 1990 sampling weights
are used in all estimations.
We used the 1985 and 1992 waves of the GSOEP, which pro-
vide income information for the years 1984 and 1991, for both
our cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses for Germans. The
GSOEP contains information on approximately 14,000 individ-
uals over this period. The cross-sectional analyses and longitu-
dinal samples of the GSOEP used here are constructed simi-
larly to those of the PSID. As was the case with the PSID, all
longitudinal GSOEP data are weighted by the more recent 1991
individual sampling weights.
Because the PSID gives all new entrants into the sample an in-
dividual weight of zero, we use an imputed individual weight
equal to the household weight divided by the household size for
all observations in our samples. This practice is consistent with
our use of individual equivalent household income in that we as-
sume that the benefits of all household sources of income are
shared equally among all members. Furthermore, while the PSID
and GSOEP household weights and the GSOEP individual
weights are adjusted for entry and exit of household members,
the PSID individual weights are not. (See Hill, 1992, for a fuller
discussion of the PSID weighting procedures, and see Rendtel,
1993, for a fuller discussion of the GSOEP weighting procedure.)
Since 1990 the GSOEP has included a representative sample of
households living in the reunited eastern states of Germany.
However, in these analyses we restrict our sample to individuals
living in the western states of Germany. For a more detailed discus-
sion of these data, see Wagner, Burkhauser, and Behringer (1993).
Comparability and quality.--The quality of the PSID data
on income is quite high. Several studies have compared differ-
ent income components in the PSID with other data sets.
Gottschalk and Moffitt (1992) look at the labor earnings and
hourly wage rate distribution in both the PSID and the Current
Population Survey (CPS). They find considerable conformity in
age, education, marital status, and levels of weeks worked.
Regression analysis of the earnings and wage distribution over
the period shows similar directions of change in between-
education group levels as well as in within-group dispersion.
Fitzgerald, Gottschalk, and Moffitt (1994) look at attrition in
the PSID and find that the PSID sample was roughly consistent
with the CPS in 1968 and remained so through 1989 for male
heads, wives, and female heads.
In Germany there has been no complete census since 1970.
However, a microcensus (1% sample) is done yearly. Berntsen
(1992) has compared the distribution of income across 18
classes of monthly net income using the 1985 microcensus with
the same classes using the 1985 GSOEP. With the exception of
the four highest income classes, where the GSOEP shares are
higher, both distributions are similar.
PSID methods played a key role in the development of the
GSOEP, so its method of following respondents is similar in
design to the PSID. Both panels ask detailed questions on in-
come sources. A major difference, however, is that the year is
the time unit in the PSID, whereas the month is the time unit in
the GSOEP. Fortunately a yearly measure has been constructed
for the GSOEP, and that measure is available to researchers. It
is that yearly public use data we employ here. For a more de-
tailed discussion of comparability of these data sets and the
construction of the yearly income values in the GSOEP, see
Burkhauser, Butrica, and Daly (1999).
Measuring Economic Well-Being
Economists conceptualize well-being in terms of utility or
life satisfaction. But they measure well-being either in terms of
consumption or income. While consumption-based measures
more closely approximate the theoretical construct of well-
being, survey data on individuals seldom include detailed mea-
sures of consumption. Hence, the most commonly used alterna-
tive measure of well-being, and the one we use in this study, is
income. As a measure of well-being, income will be correlated
with consumption, although the degree of correlation will be
less among the small portion of the elderly population with sub-
stantial liquid wealth. Slesnick (1993) and Mayer and Jencks
(1993) show that poverty rates are generally lower if one uses
consumption-based rather than income-based measures of well-
being. Their evidence suggests that the income-based measure
presented below will be a lower bound measure of economic
well-being among older people. It is important to note that in
the following sections the points we will make about cross-sec-
tional versus longitudinal measures of well-being using income
are likely to hold for such comparisons, using consumption as
the measure of economic well-being.
ECONOMIC GROWTHAND OLDER PEOPLE S281
When measuring economic well-being it is necessary to make
several explicit or implicit assumptions in order to make com-
parisons across people, across time, and across countries. We
discuss the major measurement issues in the following sections.
The sharing unit.--Although we measure individual eco-
nomic well-being and position in the income distribution, most
people share resources with other coresident individuals and
have access to income that does not flow directly to them. For
this reason a broader sharing unit, such as a family or a house-
hold, is used to collect information on income from which indi-
vidual income is derived.
The CPS family definition, based on marriage or blood rela-
tionship, is often used as the income-sharing unit in the United
States income distribution literature, but the CPS household
definition, based on common residence, is closer to what is used
in most cross-national studies. Atkinson, Rainwater, and
Smeeding (1995) argue that using the blood or marital relation-
ship definition rather than the less restrictive common residence
definition produces a bleaker picture of the income distribution
because it categorizes a larger number of individuals as single-
person sharing units even when they reside and share the bene-
fits of living with others. The PSID and GSOEP sharing-unit
definitions fall somewhere between the strict CPS family and
broad CPS common residence definitions in that they include
unmarried nonblood-related cohabitants in the "family" but ex-
clude other unmarried nonblood-related residents. For conve-
nience of discussion, we will use the word "household" to de-
scribe the PSID and GSOEP sharing units in our analysis,
although they are not exactly comparable to the CPS household
definition. We also assume that household members equally
share household income during the period they are together.
Adjustingfor inflation.--While measures of income distribu-
tion are not affected by the cost-of-living index used, measures
of economic well-being are. Boskin, Dulberger, Gordon,
Grilliches, and Jorgenson (1996) offer the most systematic criti-
cism of the Consumer Price Index-X (CPI-X) used in most mea-
sures of economic well-being in the United States and propose
alternative indices for the 1980s that are between 1.0 and 1.5
percentage points below the CPI-X. While using alternative cost-
of-living measures affects the magnitude of our results, (e.g., a
lower CPI will increase the real gains in economic well-being
over time), they do not alter our major points, because in most
cases we are making relative comparisons that are not affected
by absolute levels. Hence, we use the CPI-X for the United
States in this study to remain consistent with the literature. We
use the International Monetary Fund Consumer Price Index for
Germany. All incomes are converted to 1991 monetary units.
Accountingfor taxes.--Household income is defined as the
sum of all income held by individuals residing in a single
dwelling, and it is measured as post-tax, post-transfer money
income. In the U.S. literature, pre-tax, post-transfer family
money income, including cash government transfers, is the
most common yardstick used to measure economic status.
However, we are interested in making cross-national compari-
sons, and because taxes play a much larger role in Germany
than in the United States, we measure household income net of
income taxes and Social Security contributions in both coun-
tries. To calculate this measure, we first sum all sources of in-
come for all household members during a calendar year. To ob-
tain a more comprehensive income measure, we add the cash
value of food stamps in the United States and the imputed rental
value of owner-occupied housing in each country. (See
Burkhauser, Butrica et al. [1999] for a detailed discussion.)
Adjustingfor household size.--Because the standard of liv-
ing afforded each household member by a given household in-
come amount will vary with the number of individuals sharing
that income, household income must be adjusted for household
size. This is done using a household equivalence scale. The of-
ficial United States equivalence scale was developed by
Orshansky (1965) in her attempt to determine poverty lines for
different types of households in the United States. While the
Orshansky equivalence scale continues to be used in all official
U.S. government statistics regarding poverty, its use is not with-
out controversy. Most recently a National Academy of Sciences
report (Citro & Michael, 1995) urged major changes in this
scale. Germany has no official poverty lines or equivalence
scales but the government does set a "sociocultural minimum
income level" for its citizens that contains an implicit equiva-
lence scale. Burkhauser, Smeeding, and Merz (1996) show that
not only are the equivalence scales in the U.S. poverty line and
the German minimum income level concept far apart, but that
the difference is inconsistent with the consumption patterns of
similar-sized families in the two countries.
All equivalence scales include assumptions about how much
household income must increase to maintain the same eco-
nomic well-being of individual household members when a
person is added to the household. For example, if there are no
"returns to scale" for larger families, then, for instance, a two-
person household would need twice as much income as a one-
person household for each member of the two-person house-
hold to reach the same level of economic well-being as in the
one-person household. However, to the degree that two can live
on average more cheaply than one (e.g., heating a room for two
persons is no more expensive than heating the same room for
one), then there are "returns to scale," and individuals in the
two-person household would require less than twice the house-
hold income of a one-person household to reach the same level
of economic well-being.
Researchers interested in comparative cross-national re-
search on economic well-being must choose which equivalence
scale to employ. In the United States the Orshansky scale as-
sumes relatively high returns to scale. The German scale con-
tains much lower returns to scale. Using one scale for all na-
tions in a cross-national study is the dominant choice in the
literature (e.g., Buhmann, Rainwater, Schmaus, & Smeeding,
1988; Ringen, 1991). In these studies a class of parametric
equivalence scales is often used in which the scales share a
common functional form, and parametric variations change the
scale rate for households of different size. The scale developed
by Buhmann and colleagues (1988) is an example of this class
of scale. The Buhmann scale has a single parameter, e, the elas-
ticity of the scale with respect to household size. The scale is
characterized by the following equation:
El = D/Se
(1)
In this equation, equivalent income (economic well-being) of a
S282 BURKHAUSER ETAL.
single person in a household (El) equals total disposable house-
hold income (total income minus taxes, denoted by D) divided
by household size (S) raised to the power of the elasticity pa-
rameter e. When e equals 1, there are no returns to scale, and a
family of two requires twice as much disposable income as a
family of one for each household member to reach the same
level of equivalent income or economic well-being. Operation-
ally, each person in the household is assigned the per capita in-
come of his or her household. At the other extreme, where
e equals 0, returns to scale are perfect. Each member of a house-
hold of two, or for that matter of any number, can live exactly as
well as a person in a single-person household with no need for
additional income. Operationally, each person is assigned the in-
dividual-equivalent income of his or her household.
Burkhauser and associates (1996) show that the Orshansky
scale has an e value of 0.56, while the German scale has an s
value of 0.81. They find that whereas these different values will
not greatly affect the relative poverty rates or the income distri-
bution of the entire U.S. or German population, the use of the
German scale on U.S. data would substantially improve the rel-
ative economic well-being of older Americans. Older persons
tend to live in smaller households than younger persons; hence,
they will appear to be relatively better off compared to younger
persons, the higher the value of s. This must be the case be-
cause, as can be seen in Equation (1), the higher the value of e
the lower are the implied returns to scale in a household.
Burkhauser and associates (1996) recommend the use of an e
value of 0.5 in cross-national studies. This value is the domi-
nant one used in the cross-national literature. It is the one we
use here.
Defining the Older Population
Old age is an arbitrary concept. Because we are interested in
how those who are dependent on social security and other old-
age-related transfers fare economically, we divide our sample
between those over and under age 65. We include children in
this second group. While children are also not likely to be in the
labor force, they usually live in households with adults who are
younger than age 65 and in the labor force.
In the cross-sectional analyses using either the PSID or the
GSOEP, a person's population subgroup assignment is defined
in each year by the person's age in that year. Thus, some indi-
viduals are included in the younger group in the trough year
and in the older group in the peak year. And, as we will show,
this phenomenon greatly affects our results. For the longitudi-
nal analyses, a person's population subgroup assignment is de-
fined by the person's age in the trough year.
Summary Measures Versus Kernel Density Estimation
Traditional summary measures like the mean, the median,
or the 90/10 ratio--the household size-adjusted income of the
person at the 90th percentile of the distribution compared to
the household size-adjusted income of the person at the 10th
percentile of the distribution--are well-established methods
for summarizing the level of economic well-being and inequal-
ity in an income distribution. (See Atkinson, 1983, for a dis-
cussion of these inequality measures.) By design, however,
these measures summarize an entire distribution with one
value. Because few distributions with known properties can be
completely described by one or even two parameters, the use
of these summary indices produces an incomplete view of the
underlying distribution of interest. For example, we will show
that income inequality as measured by the 90/10 ratio rose over
the trough-to-peak period both in the United States and
Germany, but that changes in the means and medians over this
period varied greatly in size and direction across age and data-
type categories. We will also show that these measures fail to
point out that the modality of the distributions for older per-
sons in both countries also changed dramatically. Hence, sum-
mary measures alone do not provide the clearest picture of
how distributions change.
Kernel density estimation is an elegant alternative to using
traditional summary statistics to measure income inequality and
changes in economic well-being. It provides a picture of the en-
tire income distribution in terms of the income density function,
from which we can observe the distribution's location, spread,
and modality simultaneously. It can also capture absolute in-
creases in income levels via shifts in the density function to the
right. Hence, it can show that increases in inequality arise from
a variety of changes in the shape of the density function. One
type, a "squashing down" in the middle combined with a
"stretching" at each end, is typically discussed in the literature.
But this is only one possibility, as our results will show.
Changes in modality are also revealed by changes in "clump-
ing" at different points along the income scale. For these rea-
sons we use kernel density estimation here to evaluate how the
income distribution changed in the United States and Germany
during the expansion years of the 1980s for older individuals as
a complement to traditional measures.
In their simplest forms, kernel estimators are smoothed his-
tograms. Data in a neighborhood around a point are used to
estimate the distribution of a variable of interest (e.g., income)
over a population. However, while histograms restrict obser-
vations to any one neighborhood group, kernel estimators the-
oretically allow an observation to be included in an infinite
number of neighborhood groups, which results in a smoothing
of the distribution shape. In practice, an observation is in-
cluded in a finite number of groups, where the number of
groups is equal to the sample size. The idea underlying kernel
density estimation is a viewing window that slides over the
data; the estimate of the density depends on the number of ob-
servations that fall within the window as it passes along the
income scale.
In all estimates, weighted adaptive bandwidth kernel esti-
mators are used with the Epanechnikov kernel function. Kernel
estimators are well established in the statistics and economet-
rics literatures; an excellent reference on kernel estimators is
Silverman (1986). For a more technical discussion of the kernel
density method employed here in the context of measuring
economic well-being, see Burkhauser, Cutts, Daly and Jenkins
(1999).
RESULTS
Changes in Economic Weil-Being in the United States
and Germany
In Table 1 we use cross-sectional and longitudinal data from
the trough and peak years of the 1980s business cycle to com-
pare changes in economic well-being and income inequality for
the entire population and for our two age subgroups. It should
ECONOMIC GROWTHAND OLDER PEOPLE S283
be noted that our purpose here is not to compare changes in ab-
solute economic well-being between the two countries. Rather,
it is to show how measured changes in the economic well-being
of individuals and, in particular, older persons are affected by
the type of data used to measure it.
Our cross-sectional results for the U.S. population are similar
to those of other researchers (e.g., Burkhauser & Poupore,
1997; Karoly & Burtless, 1995). Economic growth following
recession brought substantial increases in average economic
well-being. As can be seen in column 3 of Table 1, in the United
States, median household size-adjusted income rose by 9.01%
between 1983 and 1989. Our cross-sectional results for
Germany are also consistent with past research (e.g., Abraham
& Hauseman,1995; Hauser & Becker, 1997). In Germany, me-
dian real income increased by 9.84% (column 9) between 1984
and 1991.
These increases in overall economic well-being, as measured
by the 90/10 ratio, were accompanied by greater inequality in
household size-adjusted incomes. In both countries these mea-
sures increased in the cross-section, with the U.S. ratio growing
by 9.72% and the German ratio rising by 6.61%. Germany also
had a much lower level of income inequality, as measured by
the 90/10 ratio, than the United States throughout the period.
The positive picture of increased economic well-being for
the total cross-sectional population extends to cross-sectional
views of the older and younger subsamples in the two coun-
tries. In both the United States and Germany, household size-
adjusted average (median and mean) income increased for older
persons. In Germany the increases were approximately the
same as those for younger persons. However, in the United
States the percentage increases for older persons were much
less than those for younger persons. While the United States
shows smaller relative gains for older persons than younger
persons over the period than Germany, this cross-sectional view
still implies that, on average, older persons benefited from eco-
nomic growth.
To be included in the PSID and GSOEP longitudinal sam-
ples, a person had to be observed in both trough and peak years;
hence, the number of observations in the longitudinal sample in
the trough year in both countries is smaller than in the cross-

sectional trough year sample. This reduction reflects attrition
both because of death and nonresponse. For instance, in the
older PSID population, of the 1,356 older persons observed in
1983, 835 are in the sample 6 years later. Of the 501 persons
not in the 1989 sample, 170 died, 37 moved, 3 were institution-
alized, and 291 were missing for unknown reasons.
If attrition is nonrandom, it may bias our results. If poorer in-
dividuals are more likely to die or attrit, then the bias should
lead to higher mean and median income values in the initial
year of the longitudinal sample. This is supported by our find-
ings using the PSID; the mean and median values in column 4
are somewhat greater than those in column 1. The direction of
the bias in the GSOEP is not so obvious, as the mean values are
smaller for the longitudinal sample (column 10) than for the
cross-sectional sample (column 7) in the initial year, but the
median values are larger.
The fact that bias is present, however, does not necessarily
deter from our main premise for two reasons. First, even if the
initial year longitudinal income levels are biased upward, it
does not imply that the income dynamics of attriters differ sig-
nificantly from stayers. Secondly, the income dynamics of
poorer persons, and poorer older persons in particular, are likely
to be such that these individuals are at higher risk of a decline
in economic well-being or small increases than the population
overall. If this latter case applies to the attriters in our data, then
our results will overstate the gains or understate the losses in
economic well-being of the total population. Such a case
strengthens our arguments. The degree of these biases, how-
ever, cannot be determined from the data at hand.
Despite these potential bias problems, the cross-sectional
and longitudinal comparisons of the total population in the two
countries between trough and peak years, shown in the top three
rows of Table 1, are similar. Among persons observed in these
years, income inequality and average economic well-being rose
using either cross-sectional or longitudinal data. The increase in
household size-adjusted mean income in the cross-sectional
comparison in the United States is 13.86% (column 3). The in-
crease in mean income in the longitudinal comparison is
11.82% (column 6). In Germany, the two values are 10.25%
and 13.79%, respectively.
It is in the age subgroup comparisons that important differ-
ences are found between the cross-sectional and longitudinal
views of household size-adjusted individual income. In the
cross-sectional analyses, economic well-being among younger
and older persons increased in both Germany and the United
States. However, the longitudinal comparisons tell quite a dif-
ferent story.
While mean income in the United States of those aged 65
and older in 1989 was 4.17% higher in real terms (using 1991
dollar equivalents for both years) as measured with cross-
sectional data, when we actually follow the fate of older per-
sons (aged 65 and older in 1983)who survived to 1989, we find
their mean adjusted income dropped by 8.33%. In contrast, the
mean income of younger persons in the United States increased
by 16.35% in the cross-sectional comparison and a slightly
lower 14.75% in the longitudinal comparison.
In Germany, our longitudinal measures for older persons
were also dramatically different from our cross-sectional ones.
The mean income of older persons increased by 10.14% in the
cross-section but only by 2.85% longitudinally. The mean in-
come of younger persons increased by 10.64% in the cross-
section but 15.03% longitudinally. Hence, while the absolute
level of economic well-being of older persons in Germany in
1984 did not fall by 1991, as was the case in the trough-to-peak
year comparisons in the United States, it nevertheless rose by a
substantially smaller fraction than did the mean household size-
adjusted income of younger persons. A comparison of median
changes in the two countries yields similar patterns.
These findings suggest that cross-sectional and longitudinal
data provide much different views of how the returns to growth
were distributed in the growth years of the 1980s. In Table 2 we
look more closely at what is behind the differences between our
cross-sectional and longitudinal views of economic well-being.
Changes in the Income Distribution: Cross-Sectional
Versus Longitudinal Views
Table 1 showed that the economic well-being of persons
aged 65 and over in 1983 relative to persons aged 65 and over
in 1989 not only could be, but was, much different from the
economic well-being of people aged 65 and over in 1983 who
survived until 1989. The reasons for these dramatically differ-
ent outcomes in 1989 can be seen in Table 2.
In columns 4, 5, and 6 of Table 2 we look at subgroups of
our 1989 cross-section of older persons aged 65 and over, first
presented in Table 1. As can be seen in the bottom four rows of
column 6, the mean, median, and sample size of the older total
cross-sectional population in 1989 are identical to those in the
second column of Table 1. The first 1989 subgroup we focus on
in Table 2 consists of persons aged 65 through 70 in 1989 who
were not in the older population in 1983. Of these 631 persons,
most (595) are "new-old" stayers, that is, they were in the 1983
PSID sample but were aged 59 through 64 and hence in the
younger population in 1983. The rest of this age group are
PSID sample members who were not interviewed in 1984 but
were in the 1990 sample. These 36 individuals are defined as
entrants in Table 2. The weighted shares of these subgroups rel-
ative to the entire older population in 1989 are also reported in
Table 2.
While the median household size-adjusted income of the
PSID stayers fell from $20,118 in 1983, when they were aged
59 through 64 (column 1), to $18,759 in 1989 (column 4), their
median income in 1989 was still higher than the $15,089 me-
dian household size-adjusted income of all older persons in
1983 (column 3). Therefore, the entry of these "new-old" stay-
ers into the 1989 cross-section helped to push the cross-
sectional median income of older persons in 1989 above the
1983 cross-sectional total.
While they make up less than 1% of the total population in
the 1989 cross-section, entrants aged 65 through 70 in 1989
(column 5) also had substantially more income than the median
older person in 1983. Combined, this new-old population aged
65 through 70 in 1989 made up 31.99% of the entire older
cross-section population and had a median income of $18,759
(column 6). This was well above the 1983 median of all older
persons.
The rest of the 1989 older person cross-section is made up of
855 stayers aged 71 and over in 1989 (column 4) and 80 en-
trants who were aged 71 and over in 1989. The older stayers
experienced a decline in their median household size-adjusted
individual income from $16,701 (column 1) in 1983 to $13,

128 (column 4) in 1989. The older stayer subgroup is the older
longitudinal population that we followed in Table 1. It is this
older stayer group that provides the answer to the question of
how older persons in 1983 who survived to 1989 fared. Their
economic well-being fell.
The fall in the economic well-being of the 65.78% of the
older population in the 1989 cross-section who are older stayers
is masked by the addition of the other subgroups, all of whom
have average income that is not only above the average income
of older stayers in 1989 but is above the total older population
in 1983 (column 3). Of these 1989 subgroups, the most impor-
tant in size is the population of new-old stayers (31.24%) who
have aged into the older cross-section population over the six
years. When all four subgroups are combined (column 6), their
median income of $15,517 is identical to that of the 1989 cross-
sectional older population reported in column 2 of Table 1.
It would be ideal if 1989 entrants to the PSID sample were
randomly drawn from the rest of the population. In such a case
they would have mean and median household incomes similar
to stayers in their age group. As can be seen in Table 2, PSID
entrants have somewhat higher household size-adjusted in-
comes than the stayers in their age group. However, the differ-
ences are relatively small as are the sizes of these populations.
It is the new-old stayers that are driving the differences between
our cross-sectional and longitudinal comparisons. It is primar-
ily because the new-old in 1989 are substantially better off than
the older cross-sectional population in 1983 that the entire older
cross-sectional population in 1989 has a higher level of eco-
nomic well-being than the older cross-sectional population in
1983, even though the median older person in 1983 who sur-
vived to 1989 is worse off.
In Germany, the average (mean or median) household size-
adjusted income of the new-old also fell between 1984 and
1991, but is nonetheless higher in 1991 than the average in-
come of the entire older population in 1984. However, unlike in
the United States, the older stayer subgroup in the older 1991
population experienced an increase in their average income
over the period, so both cross-sectional and longitudinal mea-
sured changes are positive. The cross-sectional change is
greater due to the movement of new-old persons with higher
average income into the older cross-sectional population in
1991. As in the PSID, entrants are a trivial component of the
GSOEP older population.
Some studies of economic well-being use the age of the
household head to assign individuals to older or younger house-
holds. Because we follow individuals over time in Tables 1 and
2, rather than households, we used an individual's age to assign
him or her to our older and younger age groups. However, our
S286 BURKHAUSER ETAL.
results do not substantially change when we use the age of the
household head to assign an individual to our age groups. These
results are shown in Appendix Tables 1 and 2. The results also
do not change substantially when we exclude children and
youth younger than 25 years old. These results are shown in
Appendix Table 3.
Kernel Density Estimation
Table 1 provided summary measures of economic well-being
(mean and median) and income distribution (90/10 ratio) of
older people and showed how they are affected by the use of
cross-sectional and longitudinal data. Figures 1 and 2 provide a
richer view of the income distributions using kernel density es-
timations. Figure 1 represents older persons in the United
States. The estimated distributions for older persons in
Germany are shown in Figure 2. The top panels contain the
cross-sectional estimates, and the bottom panels contain the
longitudinal estimates.
The 1989 cross-sectional distribution has a lower height and
a thicker right tail than the 1983 distribution. Most striking,
however, is that the 1983 distribution is trimodal, with the
largest peak at just below $10,000, a second smaller peak at
about $16,500, and a third peak at $30,000. The six-year growth
period stretched the distribution to theright,resulting in a distri-
bution that not only has greater economic well-being but is
nearly unimodal. The statistical literature has not settled on the
appropriate tests for determining if the differences we describe
here are significant. Burkhauser, Cutts, and colleagues (1999)
use and review a set of statistical tests that could be used. We
did not perform those tests in this study.
The change in modality and the rightward landslide of the
distribution could not be determined from the summary mea-
sures presented in Table 1. While Table 1 shows that economic
well-being in the cross-section improved at a cost of higher in-
equality among older persons in the United States, the kernel
density estimates in the top panel of Figure 1 present a richer
picture of the nature of the changing distribution of income
from one with three distinct income classes to one with a single
peak and aricherand wider middle section.
The bottom panel of Figure 1 presents the estimated distribu-
tion of income using longitudinal data. We see the trimodal dis-
tribution again in 1983, but by 1989 the distribution of income
grew taller, lost density mass in therighttail, and became nearly
unimodal like the cross-sectional distribution but peaking at a
lower level of income. Thus, the overall economic well-being
in 1989 of our sample of older persons in 1983 is substantially
lower in spite of overall economic growth and is concentrated
at an income level just above the poverty line of $6,973 for a
single-person household. Because we adjust income for house-
hold size, the appropriate comparison for whether a person is in
poverty is the single-person household poverty line. The equiva-
lence scale used here approximates the United States poverty
scale. Thus, the poverty line for a four-person household (with
size-unadjusted income) is twice (that is, multiplied by the
square root of 4) that of a single person, or $13,946.

nal (bottom panel) views of the income distribution of older
persons in Germany. In both views, overall economic well-
being improved, with a lower peak and thicker right tail in
1991. Similar to the U.S. distributions in 1983, the 1984 trough
distributions in Germany were bimodal and nearly became uni-
modal through economic growth. However, the shift in distribu-
tion in the longitudinal panel in Figure 2 is smaller than in the
cross-sectional estimates, and the middle section became nar-
rower, compressing leftward. Thus, the overall economic well-
being in 1991 of older persons who aged 7 years since 1984
was relatively, but not absolutely, worse off than was implied
by the cross-sectional data; yet, the leftward compression of the
middle of the distribution means that a significant portion of
older individuals saw decreases in their economic well-being.
As we saw in Table 2, the differences between the cross-
sectional and longitudinal views of the economic well-being of
older persons shown in Figures 1 and 2 can be attributed to
compositional changes in the older population. The new-old
persons in the peak year have higher average income than did
older persons in the trough year. These new-old persons moved
into the older population in the trough year cross-sectional analy-
sis but are not included in the longitudinal analysis. This was
true in both the United States and Germany.
But what explains the size of the differences in the cross-
sectional and longitudinal results in the two countries? One
possible explanation, which is consistent with our findings, is
related to differences in the social security programs in the two
countries. Older persons in both countries primarily depend on
employer pensions and social security benefits for their current
income. In Germany the federal social security system is the
dominant source of income for the older population. German
social security benefit increases are intended to allow retirees to
share in economic growth and, hence, increases are based on
wage increases as defined by changes in average gross social
security covered income. (See Bundesminister fur Arbeit und
Sozialordnung, 1991, and Jacobs & Schmahl, 1989, for more
on German social security benefits during the 1980s.) In con-
trast, the United States social security system is one part of a
"three-legged stool" that also includes private employer pen-
sions and private savings. In the United States, social security
benefit increases are only intended to offset inflation and,
hence, increases are based on price changes using the
Consumer Price Index. In addition, most private employer pen-
sions in the United States do not have automatic adjustments to
offset either wage or price increases. To the extent that covered
wages rose faster than prices in the growth years of the 1980s,
the German system allowed the older population to obtain a
greater share of the returns to economic growth. This may ex-
plain the ability of German older stayers to maintain their eco-
nomic well-being while the economic well-being of United
States older stayers fell.
DISCUSSION
Cross-sectional views of economic well-being and income
distribution have dominated the recent literature on the chang-
ing distribution of income in the United States and elsewhere.
The analyses in this study confirm that household size-adjusted
income of individuals increased over the economic expansion
of the 1980s in both the United States and Germany, as did in-
come inequality. We also found that both the average older and
younger person gained during this period. However, conclu-
sions about how the gains to economic growth were distributed
across the age distribution using cross-sectional data mask the
fate of older cohorts over these growth years.
Estimates of the relative returns to growth, that is, changes in
economic well-being, in both the United States and Germany
depend critically on whether one uses cross-sectional or longi-
tudinal data. Although each type of data yields similar results
for the population as a whole, the two types of data yield sub-
stantially different implications when older and younger co-
horts are followed separately. Older persons in the United States
in 1983 not only received a smaller share of the fruits of eco-
nomic growth than younger persons over the next 6 years but
actually experienced substantial declines in their economic
well-being.
Although the longitudinal picture in Germany also showed
that older persons received a smaller share of economic growth
than younger persons, their economic well-being increased, in
contrast to the United States. Our kernel density estimates com-
plement the summary measures in showing how the choice of
data--cross-sectional versus longitudinal--affects the out-
comes of relative measures of economic well-being across the
age distribution by highlighting changes in modality and the
shifting of income from the center into the tails, or vice versa.
In creating pictures of the 1980s it is important to focus the
lens appropriately. For instance, cross-sectional estimates of
economic well-being have been used to assert that across-the-
board cuts in social security benefits will not harm the eco-
nomic well-being of older people as much as in previous
decades because the average income of older people has risen.
Such an assertion clearly misses the critical point that, while the
income of new cohorts of older persons rose on average during
the growth years of the 1980s, people who were already old in
the trough year of the business cycle in the United States on av-
erage saw their income fall despite overall gains due to eco-
nomic growth. While the differences in outcome were not quite
so dramatic for Germany, the use of cross-sectional compari-
sons also exaggerates the gains to older cohorts during the
trough-to-peak years of the 1980s business cycle in Germany.
