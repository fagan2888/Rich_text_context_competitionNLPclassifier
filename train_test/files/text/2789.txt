1 Background
1.1 
Policy and Scholarly Debates
Of the many potential determinants of child
health development throughout the life course,
one of the most contentiously debated has been
the role of marriage and nonmarital childbearing.
The now-famous Moynihan Report (1965), titled
The Negro Family, highlighted family structure,
along with the legacy of slavery and sustained
discrimination, and inadequate employment
opportunities, as key determinants of intransigent
poverty among African-Americans of the time
(Massey and Sampson 2009). Moynihan's pri-
mary policy recommendation was for increased
federal efforts toward economic opportunity, and
he was initially praised by black leaders for
focusing such high-level attention on the wellbe-
ing of black families. However, a more enduring
legacy of his report, particularly in the context of
the civil rights and feminist movements of the
1960s, was his reference to the "pathological"
nature of mother-headed households (ibid.) and
the controversy it engendered.
In the subsequent decades, scholars and poli-
cymakers debated whether nonmarital childbear-
ing was the result of a "culture of poverty," which
encouraged choices that undermined African-
American children's life chances, or of structural
factors such as racial discrimination, which
trapped families in circumstances of intergenera-
tional poverty and social disadvantage (Wilson
1988). The nature and causes of poverty, and the
racialized discourse about social welfare pro-
grams, single-parent families, and their implica-
tions for child wellbeing, played a significant role
in policy debates as well. This rhetoric was par-
ticularly notable in passage of the 1996 welfare
reform law, the Personal Responsibility and
Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act (Cherlin
et al. 2009).
At the same time, the prevalence of nonmari-
tal births has grown considerably, both among
blacks and other racial and ethnic groups
(McLanahan 2009). This growth, illustrated in
Fig. 1, engendered further debate about the
nature of nonmarital childbearing and whether
its widespread increase should be cause for
concern.
However, in the 1990s, empirical data on
unmarried parents and their children was limited
602
(McLanahan 2009). Scholars and analysts
alternately posited that children born to unmar-
ried parents were the result of encounters so
casual that mothers might not know who the
fathers were, or that nonmarital childbearing in
the United States might resemble that in other
Western industrialized countries in which com-
mitted, cohabiting parents raised children within
the same stable unions as a married couple,
"lacking only the piece of paper." Still others
suggested that while unmarried parents might be
committed to each other and their children, the
American welfare state did not provide the sup-
port of those in other Western industrialized
countries, leaving the family units at risk
(McLanahan et al. 2010).
At the point when these debates were most
salient, the literature on single parenthood and
father absence focused predominantly on wid-
ows and divorced families (McLanahan and
Sandefur 1994), who researchers suspected dif-
fered significantly from parents who never mar-
ried. Some basic demographic information was
available about the women who gave birth while
unmarried, but very little was known about the
fathers of their children or about the social and
cultural environments in which their children
grew up (McLanahan 2009). Still less was
known about the health development outcomes
of children born outside of marriage or the role
of the family and social environment in their
development.
1.2 
Development of the Fragile
Families and Child Wellbeing
Study
To build a sound evidence base on the causes and
consequences of nonmarital childbearing, a team
of researchers at Columbia and Princeton
Universities developed and implemented a large
national survey, the Fragile Families and Child
Wellbeing Study (FFCWS).The "Fragile Families"
moniker was carefully chosen and derived from
the Ford Foundation's "Strengthening Fragile
Families" initiative of the 1990s (Sorensen et al.
2002). Although a variety of family transitions
carried the potential for resulting instability ­
divorce and parental death, among others ­ the
term "Fragile Families" referred specifically to
families in which parents were not married at the
time a child was born (ibid.). The word "fragile"
referred to the risks that unmarried parents faced
in terms of their economic and relationship sta-
bility, while the word "families" was used in rec-
ognition that unmarried partners with children
represent a cohesive family unit (ibid.).1
The FFCWS was designed to address four key
questions raised by the Moynihan Report and sub-
sequent public discourse (Reichman et al. 2001).
1To avoid potential stigma associated with the term "frag-
ile," families participating in the FFCWS were approached
using more neutral terms and asked to participate in the
"Survey of Parents."

(especially fathers) when their child is born?
How many of the fathers hold steady jobs?
How many want to be involved in raising their
children?
2. What is the nature of parental relationships in
fragile families at birth? How many couples are
involved in stable, long-term relationships?
How many expect to marry? How many expe-
rience high levels of conflict or domestic vio-
lence? How do relationships change over time?
3. What factors push new unwed parents
together? What factors pull them apart? How
do public policies affect parents' behaviors
and living arrangements or child wellbeing?
What are the long-term consequences of new
welfare regulations, stronger paternity estab-
lishment, and stricter child support enforce-
ment? What roles do childcare and healthcare
policies play? How do these policies play out
in different labor market environments?
4. How do parents and children fare in fragile
families, and how does family structure and
stability affect child wellbeing and
development?
The study has since expanded to become a key
source of information about family relationships
and the broader social environment and their
effects on child health development and wellbe-
ing. At time of writing, the FFCWS is in the mid-
dle of its sixth wave of data collection, and the
children born at the study baseline are turning
15 years old. The study is a joint effort by the
Princeton University Center for Research on Child
Wellbeing (CRCW) and Center for Health and
Wellbeing, the Columbia Population Research
Center (CPRC), and the National Center for
Children and Families (NCCF) at Columbia
University. The Principal Investigators of the
Fragile Families Study are Sara McLanahan, Dan

Columbia University. The study's funding has
come from the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National
Institute of Child Health and Human Development,
as well as a variety of other government and pri-
vate funders, listed in Appendix A. More than 730
scholarly articles, theses, books, and abstracts
have used the FFCWS data, which has also been
used to inform testimony to policymakers at the
national, state, and local levels (e.g., Sorensen
et al. 2002; Geller 2011).
1.3 
The FFCWS and Life Course
Health Development Research
The FFCWS has several features that make it ide-
ally suited for life course health development
research on children. The Life Course Health
Development (LCHD) model (see Halfon and
Forrest 2017) views health as a "dynamic, emer-
gent capacity that develops continuously over the
lifespan, in a complex, nonlinear process" form-
ing health development trajectories that are influ-
enced by physical and social environmental as
well as personal and genetic factors. Specifically,
the model lays out seven principles of health
development (ibid.):
1. Health is an emergent set of developmental
capacities.
2. Health develops continuously over the life
span.
3. Health development is a complex, nonlinear
process occurring in multiple dimensions and
at multiple levels and phases.
4. Health development is sensitive to the timing
and social structuring of environmental expo-
sures and experience.
5. Health development is an adaptive process
that has been engendered by evolution with
strategies to promote resilience and plasticity
in the face of changing and often constraining
environmental contexts.
6. Optimal health development promotes survival,
enhances thriving, and protects against disease.
7. Health development is sensitive to the timing
and synchronization of molecular, physiologi-
cal, behavioral, social, and cultural function.

604
Health is a broad set of developmental capaci-
ties that are in constant and dynamic transactions
with individuals' biological, physical, and social
environments (National Research Council and
Institute of Medicine 2004). The FFCWS mea-
sures children's environments across all of these
domains: the study contains biological indicators
of children's wellbeing from the time of their
birth, including low birthweight (Reichman and
Teitler 2006) and overweight and obesity (Kimbro
et al. 2007), among others (e.g., Holt et al. 2013).
In many cases the FFCWS is even able to study
children's prenatal environments through their
mothers' hospital records (Reichman and
Nepomnyaschy 2008; Smulian et al. 2005). More
recently, the study has also started to collect
genetic data, to enable examination of gene-envi-
ronment interactions (Mitchell et al. 2014).
The FFCWS also contains rich information on
children's physical environments, examining fac-
tors with significant influence on health develop-
ment throughout the life course. The study
collects data on the homes and neighborhoods in
which children live, exposure to lead (Boutwell
et al. 2014), access to food (Corman et al. 2014),
and other neighborhood conditions.
One of the richest contributions of the FFCWS
is its measurement of the social environment in
which children are raised. According to the theo-
retical principles of life course health develop-
ment, health development is a multilevel
construct, and the FFCWS measures children's
social environments at many of the levels that
influence their health development throughout
the life course: the family (both biological par-
ents and the social unit that comprises the house-
hold) (Jackson et al. 2012; Pilkauskas 2014),
childcare settings (Rigby et al. 2007), schools
(Razza et al. Forthcoming), neighborhoods
(Suglia et al. 2013), and broader contexts such as
states or local labor markets (Rigby et al. 2007;
Pilkauskas et al. 2012).
In addition to the rich multilevel data con-
tained in the FFCWS, another significant contri-
bution the study makes to life course research is
its unique sampling strategy (detailed below in
Sect. 2.1). Given the study's focus on unmarried
parents and nonmarital childbearing, the study
systematically oversamples unmarried couples,
who face disproportionate socioeconomic
challenges (McLanahan 2011). The FFCWS

permits the observation of these challenges on a
population level, and enables the identification of
factors that might exacerbate risk or promote
resilience among children. By nature of the
FFCWS sampling plan, the data also contain
large samples of racial and ethnic minority fami-
lies, who are often underrepresented in popula-
tion-based surveys (Reichman et al. 2001).
Another contribution of the FFCWS is the
longitudinal nature of its data collection. The
study contains rich information on children's
environments, health status throughout infancy,
early childhood, school entry, and middle child-
hood, which permits the construction of health
development trajectories. As important as these
periods are for long-term health and wellbeing
(Shonkoff and Phillips 2000; Heckman 2006),
very few population-based American datasets
track birth cohorts or begin in infancy or early
childhood (though see Flanagan and West 2004
for information on the Early Childhood
Longitudinal Study, a notable exception).
The longitudinal birth cohort structure of the
FFCWS, coupled with the rich data it collects on
multiple domains of health and health determi-
nants, permits the joint analysis of children's
physical and emotional health development, both
of which develop continuously over the life span.
Health development and environmental con-
structs are tracked over time, with indicators
either measured repeatedly or updated to be age-
appropriate, as needed. These measures are there-
fore able to capture the time-sensitive nature of
child development. Children (and adults) experi-
ence several key transitions throughout the life
course (e.g., school entry, puberty, etc.), which
require new modes of adaptation to biological,
psychological, or social changes (Elder 1985;
Graber and Brooks-Gunn 1996). Events they
experience ­ both positive and negative ­ may
also serve as turning points that alter their life
course trajectories (Elder 1985; Sampson and
Laub 1990). The effects of turning points and
other key exposures on life course trajectories
may further be linked to the timing of these
A. Geller et al.
605
exposures with respect to developmental transi-
tions (Graber and Brooks-Gunn 1996).An impor-
tant strength of the FFCWS is its observation of

exposures to key influences, and measurement of
children's risk and resilience, throughout their
health developmental trajectories.
1.4 Road Map
The rest of this chapter proceeds as follows.
Section 2 lays out the sampling plan and study
design of the FFCWS. Section 3 provides an
inventory of the data available at time of writing.
Section 4 provides greater detail on how the
FFCWS data may be used for life course health
development research. Section 5 lays out future
plans for the FFCWS. Section 6 concludes with
resources available for FFCWS data users.
2 Study Design
The FFCWS was designed to provide informa-
tion on unmarried couples and their newborn
children (McLanahan et al. 2010). Previous
efforts to describe these "fragile families" were
limited by the challenges in collecting data on
unmarried fathers (Reichman et al. 2001). What
little was known about men who fathered chil-
dren outside of marriage suggested that they were
younger and less educated than men who father
children within marriage, with lower incomes
and fewer attachments to the labor market
(Reichman et al. 2001; Garfinkel et al. 1998).
These fathers also reported more disability, more
depression, and a greater prevalence of risky
health behaviors such as drinking and substance
use (ibid.). These factors create challenges in
recruiting and retaining them in population-based
surveys (Aday and Cornelius 2006). Unmarried
fathers also are less likely to be their children's
legal guardians and to have fewer formal ties to
their families, and may be harder to locate as a
result. Accordingly, it is also likely that data
obtained from prior household surveys under-
stated the disadvantage faced by families with
unmarried fathers.
The FFCWS focused its study design around
the objective of obtaining information about
previously understudied, unmarried, and often

nonresident fathers. Early pilot studies sug-
gested that unmarried fathers were often present
at the birth of their child, and that both parents
were willing to be interviewed at this time
(Reichman et al. 2001). Baseline data collection
was designed around this "magic moment," and
both mothers and fathers were initially con-
tacted for interview while in the hospital, shortly
after their child's birth. Sampling from hospitals
also provided a spatial clustering of new parents
that both improved response rates and kept
recruitment and interview costs manageable.
2.1 Sampling Strategy
The FFCWS was based on a multistage stratified
random sample: cities were sampled, then hospi-
tals within cities, and then births within hospitals.
The sampling of cities was based on all cities in
the United States with populations of 200,000 or
more. Some of the cities in the sampling frame
had a population of over 200,000 only when out-
lying suburban areas were included, while some
cities were considered only in terms of their inner
city ­ the definition of each city was drawn from
its vital statistics (Reichman et al. 2001). These
cities were then characterized by their policy
environments, as defined by three variables: the
welfare generosity, the strength of the local labor
market, and the strength of local child support
enforcement. (See Reichman et al., at 310­311,
for further details on the scoring of policy
environments.)
Each city's welfare, labor market, and child
support regimes were scored on a three-point
scale: low, medium, or high welfare generosity
and strong, medium, or weak labor markets and
child support enforcement policies. Cities were
then sorted into two groups: those with only
extreme values (low or high) for all three dimen-
sions (leaving 8 different "extreme cells") and
cities with at least one middle value (19 remain-
ing cells). One city was sampled from each of
the 8 extreme cells, and 8 additional cities were

606
randomly sampled from the 19 remaining cities,
with selection probability based on city popula-
tions. In the 8 "extreme policy" cities, the plan
was to collect data on 250 nonmarital births and
75 marital births, for a total of 325. In the other
8 cities, the plan was to sample a total of 100
births. The "large sample" cities provided an
ability to understand the social and policy envi-
ronment and social processes within cities, as
well as differences between cities. The eight
"small sample" cities, selected from the cells
with at least one middle value, improved the
ability to observe nonlinearities in the effects of
welfare, child support, and labor markets.
The 16 cities randomly selected along the sys-
tematic stratified sampling plan comprise the
"national sample" of the FFCWS.3 Four addi-
tional cities were added to the study, given their
special substantive interest to funders. Table 1
lists the cities sampled in the FFCWS, whether
they were selected as part of the national (i.e.,
random) sample and their baseline sample sizes.
The FFCWS is not only designed to be nation-
ally representative of births in large cities but to
offer detailed case studies of the included cities
themselves. Hospitals were systematically sam-
pled in order to increase coverage of nonmarital
births, which led to a full sample of 75 hospitals
(see Reichman et al. 2001, for the full list of
3Two cities (Baltimore and San Jose) were selected in a
second round of sampling, when the research team was
unable to gain access to hospitals in two of their initially
sampled cities (Birmingham, AL and Santa Ana, CA).
included hospitals). Within each hospital, moth-
ers of new babies were sampled from maternity
ward lists. Once sampled, mothers were asked to
complete a screening instrument to determine
marital status and eligibility for participation in
the study. Quotas were set at each hospital for the
number of unmarried and married births, based
on sample cities' 1996/1997 unmarried birth
rates. Marital and nonmarital births were ran-
domly sampled until preset quotas were reached
for each hospital. If a mother was determined to
be above the set quota for a given marital status,
the case was coded "over quota," and the mother
was not interviewed. In the rare cases that sur-
veyed parents had had twins or a higher-order
multiple birth, one child was designated the
"focal child," the child to whom answers to the
FFCWS refer.
The FFCWS oversample of nonmarital births,
coupled with the significantly higher rates of
nonmarital childbearing among blacks and
Hispanics noted in Fig. 1, provided a study sam-
ple with a significantly higher representation of
non-white families than most household surveys.
Racial and ethnic classification of the mothers
and fathers in the survey are provided in Table 2.
Several subgroups of parents were not
included in the study: those who did not speak
English or Spanish well enough to complete the
interview, those who planned to place the child
for adoption, those for whom the father of the
baby was deceased, those whose baby died before
the interview could take place, those mothers
who were too ill to complete the interview (or

whose babies were too ill for the mother to
complete the interview), and, in many hospitals,
parents who were under 18 and therefore prohib-
ited by the hospital from being interviewed
(Reichman et al. 2001). Because the study was
designed to examine the roles of mothers and
fathers in families, the study is also limited to
births to heterosexual couples. As the sample is
hospital-based, home births and births in other
venues are also not represented. With these and
other slight exceptions, the FFCWS sample is
representative of the nonmarital births taking
place in each city. However, the marital sample is
not necessarily representative of marital births in
each city because in many cities, births were pur-
posively sampled from hospitals with the highest
rates of nonmarital births. It is also important to
note that the sample is representative of nonmari-
tal births taking place in each city rather than of
births to residents of each city (Reichman et al.
2001), since parents giving birth within the city
may live elsewhere.
2.2 Sampling Weights
Due to the complex sampling design of the
FFCWS, the data are provided with sampling
weights to make the data representative of the
sample cities and of urban births nationally.
These weights account for the stratified random
sample of cities, the sample of hospitals, and the
sample of births, as well as the clustering of
births by hospital, the oversample of nonmarital
births, the underrepresentation of teen births, and
mothers' marital status, education, race/ethnicity,
and age. The survey includes six sets of weights:
to make the data nationally representative and
representative of sample cities, for couples and
for mothers and fathers separately. These weights
are provided for the five waves of data currently
available, to account not only for design but for
baseline nonresponse and attrition over time
(Carlson 2008; CRCW 2008a, b).
2.3 
Timing of Interviews
Baseline interviewing for the FFCWS took
place over 3 years, between 1998 and 2000.
Couples were subsequently contacted for re-
interview in four additional waves, reflecting
various developmental stages of the focal child's
life. Interviews took place when the focal chil-
dren were 1, 3, 5, and 9 years of age, and a sixth
wave of the study is currently in the field (inter-
viewing the families while the focal children are
15 years old.) Due to the short time that elapsed
between the early interviews, some families
were interviewed for their Year 1 (Y1) follow-
up before baseline interviewing was completed
for all families, for their Year 3 (Y3) follow-up
before Y1 interviewing was completed, and for
Year 5 (Y5) follow-up before Y3 interviewing
was completed.
Because interviews were carried out over
approximately 3 years in each wave, many of
the early interviews provided valuable informa-
tion to improve the survey while it was ongoing.
Interviews took place in the first two cities
(Oakland, CA and Austin, TX) approximately a
full year before interviewing began in the
remaining 18 cities, and the early interviews
served as a form of pilot test. If questions were
not well understood by the respondents, or
responses did not have sufficient variation to
permit meaningful analysis, these questions
were revised before interviewing in the remain-
ing 18 cities.
It also bears noting that considerable time
may elapse between father and mother inter-
views within the same family. Of the families
in which both mothers and fathers were inter-
viewed at baseline, more than half (55%) of

couples were interviewed on the same day.
However, in more than 10% of families, par-
ents were interviewed more than 1 month apart.
By Year 9 (Y9), only 15% of parents who both
participated were interviewed on the same day.
More than 30% were interviewed more than 1
month apart from their partners, with a small
number interviewed over a year apart. It is
quite possible that discrepancies in mothers'
and fathers' reports of family circumstance
reflect differences in timing as well as differ-
ences in perspective and other traditional
sources of measurement error.
2.4 
Attrition and Retention
The FFCWS has been unusually successful in
collecting data on its generally hard-to-reach tar-
get population. Core response rates are provided
in Table 3 for mothers and fathers, by their base-
line marital status. Mothers' baseline response
rates are computed as the percent of mothers
approached for interview who agreed to partici-
pate. Fathers' results at baseline are computed as
the percent of mothers interviewed at baseline
whose partners agreed to participate. Response
rates in subsequent waves are computed as a per-
cent of the couples interviewed at baseline who
participated in subsequent waves. Even among
the hardest-to-reach population, unmarried
fathers, the majority of the sample was retained
in the survey at the 9-year follow-up wave. Nearly
all fathers (96% of fathers married at baseline
and 87% of unmarried fathers) were interviewed
at least once.
2.5 Couple Data
Another way in which the FFCWS provides
unique information into its hard-to-reach target
population is by the collection of couple data.
Not only does the "magic moment" of the focal
child's birth provide an opportunity to identify
fathers who might not otherwise be located,
information on these fathers is not only provided
through personal interviews but also through the
data collected from their partners. Mothers report
not only on their own background and behavior
and their personal perception of the couple rela-
tionship, but they also report detailed information
on their partners' own background and behavior.
This information includes the fathers' racial and
ethnic background, place of residence, and edu-
cational attainment, as well as behavioral infor-
mation such as labor market activity, incarceration
history, parenting behavior, and other aspects of
father involvement (e.g., child support payment
and visitation). Likewise, fathers are asked to
report on similar domains of the mothers' back-
ground and behavior.
Couple data provides value in two important
ways. When both parents are interviewed, con-
cordance or disagreement between the two

parents' responses can be used to assess many
domains of their relationship, subject to differ-
ences in the phrasing of some questions and the
timing of each parent's interview. When only one
parent is interviewed, responses about their part-
ner provide information not directly obtainable.
This is particularly important given the factors
likely to influence attrition and retention. If the
fathers least involved with their partners and

children are the most likely to leave the survey,
analyses based only on those retained are likely
to be affected by selection bias. Collecting moth-
ers' reports of father characteristics helps to
reduce this bias.

the Office of Population Research (OPR) at
Princeton University. These data, excluding Y9,
are also available through the Inter-university
Consortium for Political and Social Research
(ICPSR). In-home data from the Y3, Y5, and Y9
waves are also available for a subset of core
respondents. Additional data, described below,
are available to the public via a restricted use
contract.
The FFCWS restricted-use dataset (also
known as the "contract data") contain more sen-
sitive information such as geographic identifiers
(i.e., the city where the focal child was born and
state of respondent residence), census tract char-
acteristics, local macroeconomic measures,
genetic data, medical records data, and school
characteristics. More information on these mea-
sures is provided in Appendix B. While these
indicators are invaluable for researchers who are
interested in children's local or school environ-
ments, gene-environment interactions, or detailed
information about maternal health, it bears noting
that the vast majority of FFCWS research is done
using the public-use dataset.
Access to the FFCWS contract data is limited
to researchers who agree to the terms and condi-
tions contained in the Contract Data Use License.
Access is limited to faculty and research person-
nel at institutions which have an institutional
review board (IRB) or human subjects review
committee registered with the US Office for
Human Research Protections (OHRP) or the
National Institutes of Health (NIH). Researchers
must obtain IRB approval of their research and
data protection plans. Students may use the
FFCWS contract data for dissertation research;
however, a faculty advisor must serve as the
investigator and complete the application pro-
cess, with the student signing a Supplemental
Agreement with Research Staff form. The faculty
advisor and the institution bear full responsibility
for ensuring that all conditions of the license are
met by the student. Further information about the
data access process for both the public- and
restricted-use files is available in Appendix B.
3.2 Data Modules
In every wave, participating mothers and fathers
each completed a "core" survey, administered
in-person for most baseline interviews and by
phone in most subsequent interviews. For both
mothers and fathers, each core interview
included questions on household and family
characteristics (including a household roster and
parents' marital and coresidence status, as well
as contact between nonresident parents and the
focal child); sociodemographic and background
characteristics; information on parenting behav-
ior; romantic relationships (with the focal bio-
logical child's other biological parent or, where
relevant, with new partners); details about each
parent's health, education, employment, and
income; as well as indicators of the focal child's
health development and wellbeing. Many of the
indicators in the core are collected using the
same survey questions at each wave, enabling
longitudinal analyses of family trajectories.
Details on the data collected in the FFCWS core
are provided in Sect. 4. In addition to the data
available in the core, both the FFCWS public-
and restricted-use files contain several other
modules with additional information. These
include in-home observations, supplemental sur-
veys, official records, and genetic data.

3.2.1 
In-Home Module (Public
and Restricted Use)
In addition to the data collected by phone from
both mothers and fathers in the FFCWS core
data, both the public- and restricted-use files
include an in-home module in the Y3, Y5, and
Y9 waves. The in-home module includes several
assessments of the child and his or her home
environment and a survey of the child's primary
caregiver (PCG), defined as person the focal
child lives with at least half the time. The PCG,
who can be either the biological mother or father,
or a nonparental figure such as a grandparent, is
interviewed in the Y3, Y5, and Y9 survey waves.
Interviews include a mix of in-person and self-
administered questionnaires conducted in the
home and questions asked over the phone.
The PCG survey covers information about the
child's home and neighborhood environment,
including questions of neighborhood safety, the
availability of household resources, parenting
behaviors, and childcare arrangements. The PCG
also provides details of the focal child's health
development, which are best reported by the per-
son the focal child spends the most time with. It
is notable, however, that which questions are
answered in the PCG survey and which are
answered by the biological parents in the core
survey vary by wave.
In addition, the in-home module in all three
waves includes several systematic assessments
by the interviewer, including the focal child's
general health and cognitive health develop-
ment, the PCG's health and cognitive abilities,
and assessments of the home and neighborhood
environment. These include measures of the
height and weight of both the PCG and child,
cognitive tests of both the PCG and child, and
recorded observations of interactions between
the PCG and child.
In the most recent wave (Y9), the in-home
assessment also includes an interview of the focal
child. In the "child survey," the focal child pro-
vides his or her perspective on the home environ-
ment, including relationships with each of their
biological parents, as well as any new partners
that the parents are married to or living with. The
child also reports on the extent of discipline and
monitoring provided by their primary caregiver
and discipline provided by each of their biologi-
cal parents and any new partners. The focal child
also reports on relationships with his or her sib-
lings and how and with whom he or she spends
time. He or she provides self-reports of personal
information that might not be accurately assessed
by the parents or PCG, including health, personal
safety, his or her school environment, school con-
nectedness, bullying and bully victimization, and
several aspects of behavior, including early delin-
quent behavior.
3.2.2 
Childcare Provider and Teacher
Surveys (Public
and Restricted Use)
In the Y3 survey, families using nonparental
childcare for at least 7 hours per week, and one
consistent childcare arrangement for at least
5 hours per week, were asked if a representative
of the childcare program could be interviewed. A
subset of these parents and childcare providers
consented to be interviewed and observed. The
childcare provider survey included information
on the focal child's behavior, social skills, and
learning, as well as characteristics of the pro-
gram. In many cases the interviewer also observed
interactions between the provider and the child.
In Y5 and Y9, the focal child's teachers were
also asked to participate in the survey. Teachers
who agreed completed a self-administered
questionnaire and provided characteristics of
their classroom, the school climate, and their
assessment of the child's behavior, social skills,
and learning, as well as the parents' involve-
ment. The teacher surveys did not include
administrative details of the school itself; fur-
ther information provided on the child's school
is provided in the restricted-use file and
described in Sect. 2.4.
3.2.3 Medical Records (Restricted Use
Only)
Approximately 75% of the mothers interviewed
at the FFCWS baseline gave permission for their
medical records to be abstracted for analysis.
These records contain detailed quantitative and
qualitative data on the mother's health and
A. Geller et al.
611
healthcare history, including details of her repro-
ductive history, such as how many previous preg-
nancies she had had before the focal child was
born, and how much weight she gained during
the pregnancy. The FFCWS medical records data
also contain other anthropomorphic measures
(such as the mother's weight and the child's birth
weight), indicators of chemical substances in the
body at the time of the birth, and diagnoses,
including both physical and mental health. The
medical records data provides a rich narrative of
the mother's health at the time of the birth and
serves to identify inconsistencies in maternal
self-reports.
3.2.4 
School Characteristics File
(Restricted Use Only)
At the Y9 follow-up survey, data on the focal
child's school was collected by the National
Center for Education Statistics (NCES).Although
the names and locations of the school are not
released in the restricted-use file, a unique identi-
fier is provided for each school in the file, so that
children attending the same school can be identi-
fied. The NCES data include information on
whether the school is a public or private school,
the school's grade span (i.e., the grades taught in
the school), the racial composition of the student
population, Title I funding and eligibility (United
States Department of Education 2014), an indica-
tor of socioeconomic disadvantage among the
students, and the percent of the student body eli-
gible for free or reduced price lunches.
3.2.5 "Neighborhood"Contextual
Data File (Restricted Use Only)
Neighborhood data for both mothers and fathers
are measured at each wave. "Neighborhoods" in
the FFCWS are defined as each parent's census
tract of residence, though to protect respondent
privacy, the tract identifiers are coded, and
respondents cannot be matched to a specific tract
in the restricted-use files. In addition, some ran-
dom noise has been introduced into the data to
ensure that respondents' census tracts cannot be
identified from the data. This noise should have
no impact on analyses. The contextual data file is
based on the US Census and contains information
on the tracts'racial composition, local employment
and income levels, housing characteristics and
rent, and receipt of public assistance.
3.2.6 
Macroeconomic Data File
(Restricted Use Only)
In addition to tract-level contextual data, the
FFCWS has recently released broader contex-
tual data for restricted use. The macroeco-
nomic data file contains information on the
national and local economic climate facing
both mothers and fathers in the month of their
interview. This file is based on MSA-level data
from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, on
employment, unemployment, and labor force
participation in the MSA containing their sam-
ple city, as well as monthly population data in
both the MSA and sample state. The file also
contains national-level data from the Survey of
Consumers on the Consumer Sentiment Index
in the month of interview. These data, coupled
with the fact that Y9 data collection in the
FFCWS took place between August 2007 and
March 2010, permit unique analyses of the
Great Recession and the effects of economic
downturns on families and children (Pilkauskas
et al. 2012).
3.2.7 
Genetic Data (Restricted Use
Only)
In the Y9 wave of data collection, in addition to
the survey data collected from parents, children,
and teachers, and the administrative data col-
lected to supplement the surveys, the in-home
module included the collection of genetic data.
More than half of families in the study ­ and
more than 75% of families participating in theY9
in-home survey ­ provided noninvasive saliva
samples for genotyping. The goal of the genetic
data collection was to allow researchers to
directly incorporate genetic information into
their models of family relationships and child
development and to test hypotheses about the
relationships between genes, environment, and
child health development. Saliva samples were
sealed into containers with a liquid preservative
and mailed to the survey subcontractor, where
they were in turn shipped to the Princeton
Using the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study (FFCWS) in Life Course Health Development Research
612
University Molecular Biology laboratory, where
genetic information was extracted and quantified
into genetic markers such as single nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs) and telomere length
(CRCW 2013).
The genetic data file includes results from the
genotyping of several candidate polymorphisms
hypothesized to influence child health develop-
ment through their interactions with children's
social environments. These candidate polymor-
phisms include serotonin transporters, dopa-
mine transporter, dopamine D2 receptor,
dopamine D4 receptor, catechol-O-methyltrans-
ferase, melanocortin 4 receptor, transmembrane
protein, and tryptophan hydroxylase. Further
information on the specific polymorphisms
included in the data file, the genotyping process
and quality control mechanisms for each, and
valuable references for the study of gene-envi-
ronment interactions, are available through the
Center for Research on Child Wellbeing (2015).
At the time of writing, additional data are being
developed in conjunction with active research
programs, for future release. Data users are
encouraged to check the FFCWS home page for
up-to-date information.
3.3 
Module Participation Rates
Although not all of the data collection modules
were completed for each family at each wave, the
majority of modules were completed for a sub-
stantial majority of families at the waves they were
offered. Table 4 provides the participation rates for
each of the data collection modules by wave.

Using the FFCWS
As noted in Sect. 3.1, FFCWS data can be
obtained through two different processes: public
access and the contract process for accessing
restricted-use data. The access details described
in this section apply only to the public-use file.
The remainder of this section lays out details of
the FFCWS data, which apply to both the public-
and restricted-use data.
4.1 Data Access
The FFCWS public-use files can be accessed
through a two-step process: users must first reg-
ister with the data archive at the Princeton
University Office of Population Research and
thensignupforaccesstotheFFCWS.Registration
applications are usually reviewed within one
business day. Public-use files, not including Y9,
are also available through the Inter-university
Consortium for Political and Social Research
(ICPSR); however, the Princeton archive has
the most current data files and is preferential for
scientific research. Access protocols for the

University (CRCW 2009a).
4.2 Data Structure
In both the public- and restricted-use datasets,
the FFCWS data are structured with one record
per child and identified with a unique family
identifier, a string variable called idnum. At
each wave, mother and father data are stored in
separate files and can be merged using the
idnum variable to match members of the same
family. The other modules described in Sect. 3
can also be merged to the core data using the
idnum variable. Each core dataset has records
for all 4898 families, regardless of whether
each parent was interviewed. Flag variables
indicate whether or not a mother or father was
interviewed at a given wave, and cases who
didn't participate in a given interview/wave are
coded as "not in wave" on all other variables.4
4.3 Variable Documentation
The complete merged FFCWS dataset contains
more than 10,000 variables, covering a wide vari-
ety of domains used in life course health develop-
ment research. These include parents'
demographic information, parental relationships,
relationships the parents may form with new
partners, relationships between each parent and
the focal child, relationships between parents'
new partners and the focal child, child wellbeing,
health, behavior, and other aspects of health
development. The data also contain information
on the focal child's physical and social environ-
ments, including parental employment, house-
4In Y9, there were several types of interviews a PCG may
have participated in, so it was possible for them to be
coded as "not in wave" for one interview but to participate
in a different interview, technically in the same wave. For
example, a mother who is the PCG might have partici-
pated in the mother core survey but not completed the
PCG self-administered questionnaire.
hold income and economic wellbeing, parental
health and behavior, parental incarceration, social
support and other family relationships, housing
and neighborhood quality, and access to govern-
ment programs. Not all domains are covered in
each wave of the FFCWS and where each domain
appears in the survey varies across waves. Each
topic can be located within the five available
waves using the FFCWS Core Question Map
(CRCW 2009b), which lists in which waves a
given topic appears; whether a topic is covered
by mothers, fathers, or both; and in which section
of the survey. Additionally, there is an In-Home
Questionnaire Map for Y3 and Y5. Complete
questionnaires are also available on the docu-
mentation page of the FFCWS website.
4.3.1 Variable Structure
and Construction
Other than the variable idnum, which identifies
families across data modules, core FFCWS vari-
ables are named according to a consistent con-
vention. Core variable names begin with either
an m or an f, depending on whether it was reported
by the mother or father, respectively, followed by
an indicator of the wave in which it was asked
(1 = baseline, 2 = 1 year, 3 = 3 years, 4 = 5 years,
and 5 = 9 years), followed by a letter and number
to indicate the section and question where it
appears in the survey instrument. For example,
the variable m1a12 refers to the mother's base-
line survey and the 12th question of section a.
Variables from the in-home survey are stored in
separate modules and are numbered only with a
letter and number to indicate section and ques-
tion.5 The Y9 dataset includes several additional
variable prefixes to accommodate the additional
modules described in Sect. 3.2 (CRCW 2011).
Variables in the FFCWS data are also charac-
terized by a consistent schema for responses and
5It is important to note that many variable names are used
in both the Y3 and Y5 in-home modules, and will need to
be renamed for unique identification, usually by adding
prefixes (i.e., ih3, ih4), if the variables are used together in
a single data file. Future data updates may correct for this
by including variable prefixes.
Using the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study (FFCWS) in Life Course Health Development Research
614
missing data. All substantive responses appear in
the data as positive numbers. Nonnumeric vari-
ables are also coded as positive integers, and their
substantive meaning is indicated in the question-
naires and embedded variable labels. (For exam-
ple, "Yes" answers are usually coded as 1, and
"No" answers are usually coded as 2.) Missing
responses are indicated with negative numbers,
with different negative values indicating different
reasons that the data are missing. Details on the
missing data codes are provided in Table 5.
The FFCWS dataset also includes numerous
variables constructed by CRCW staff to ensure
that commonly used concepts are coded consis-
tently by all users. At baseline, examples of con-
structed variables include the baby's sex, whether
or not the birth was of multiple children (i.e.,
twins), whether the baby had low birth weight
(i.e., less than 2500 grams), the ethnicity and race
of both parents, and each parent's educational
attainment at baseline. At Y1, additional vari-
ables were constructed to note the mother's age
when she first had a baby and the total number of
biological children she had. At Y3, variables
were constructed to indicate each parent's cogni-
tive ability (Wechsler 1981). Several other vari-
ables were constructed to indicate household
composition (along with a second variable to
indicate whether the child's grandparents lived in
the household), fathers' incarceration histories,
whether each parent reported depression and
anxiety, and several details of the interview
itself ­ whether it was conducted in Spanish,
whether each parent was interviewed, and
whether the primary caregiver participated in the
in-home study.
4.3.2 Variable Content
The FFCWS data, collected through multiple meth-
ods, contains a rich set of child health and behav-
ioral indicators, measures of parental resources and
behavior, as well as indicators of parents' physical
mental health, health behaviors, incarceration histo-
ries, and relationship stability before and since the
focal birth. A summary of information collected to
date is provided in Table 6, along with the modes of
collection used for each class of data.
4.3.3 
Tracking Constructs Over Time
One of the strengths of the FFCWS for life
course health development research is the con-
sistent measure of multiple substantive con-
structs across waves of the study. Many of the
questions on child health were asked in each
wave: parents or primary caregivers are asked to
report the focal child's general health status,
whether he or she has any physical disabilities,
and whether he or she has had any experience
with asthma ­ a diagnosis or an attack, with par-
ticular attention to whether the attack required a
visit to the emergency room. Parents and care-
givers are also asked to report children's medical
visits at each wave, including doctor's visits for
preventive care, illnesses, and accidents, as well

as any visits to the hospital or emergency room.
Many indicators of the family's social environ-
ment were also asked in similar formats across
waves, such as parents' reports of relationship
quality and co-parenting.
Other family characteristics differ slightly
from one wave to the next; for example, parents
are asked to report on between 8 and 14 indica-
tors of material hardship in each of the Y1, Y3,
and Y5 waves. These measures may be recon-
ciled by analyzing only the eight indicators that
appear in all three waves or can be used in their
differing format. Still other characteristics, par-
ticularly those related to child health develop-
ment, would be inappropriate to measure in the
same way in all waves (e.g., questions on child
behavior, cognitive development, and puberty
onset). The FFCWS measures are selected and
designed to be age-appropriate at the time they
are asked. Researchers maintain considerable
flexibility in ways to model child cognitive and
behavioral health trajectories over time.
5 Looking Ahead
In addition to the rich data that has been collected
in the FFCWS to date, the study is currently in
the field for a new round of data collection. This
data collection is timed around the focal child's
15th birthday (hereafter "Year 15" or "Y15") and
designed to improve understanding of how chil-
dren's experiences in early and middle childhood
influence adolescent behaviors. Adolescence is a
critical period in human development when chil-
dren engage in both positive and negative behav-
iors with lasting consequences for future health
and wellbeing. The new wave of the FFCWS will
provide new information about how children's
adolescent outcomes are influenced by their
experiences in infancy and early childhood.
Data in the Y15 wave is being collected
through a series of new measures, as well as
measures from existing waves that have been
expanded to capture children's experiences
directly from their self-report. Key areas of
expansion include sexual activity (and particu-
larly risky sexual activity), school performance
and engagement, delinquency, civic and extra-
curricular participation, pro-social behaviors,
pubertal development, substance use and abuse,
sleep, physical activity, eating, multimedia
exposure, and a variety of other measures of
adolescent health and wellbeing. The Y15 survey
is also collecting data on the focal child's rela-
tionships with both his or her biological parents,
any new partners, and siblings, in order to under-
stand how family complexity and instability
influence family interactions and adolescent
wellbeing. Finally, the Y15 wave will include
new collection of genetic information through
additional saliva samples.
The new data will facilitate research on topics
related to adolescent risk; the role of the family in
shaping adolescent outcomes; racial and ethnic,
gender, and income disparities in adolescent
health development; and the role of gene-envi-
ronment interactions in adolescent development.
Data collection is scheduled to be completed by
2017, and the data will be cleaned and released
for limited and public use in the coming years.

Key Resources for Users
In addition to the rich data resources available in
the FFCWS, Princeton's Center for Research on
Child Wellbeing (CRCW) and the Columbia
Population Research Center (CPRC), as the
home institutions of the study, devote consider-
able material and intellectual resources to the
community of data users. In addition to the data
and extensive documentation available online,
CRCW staff maintain an online database of
working papers and publications using the
FFCWS. Data users are encouraged to publish
their working papers and submit their publica-
tions for inclusion in the database. CRCW also
publishes a series of research briefs based on
FFCWS publications, which are both available
from the FFCWS website and distributed to a
broad audience of researchers, policymakers,
and advocates. Finally, CRCW staff are available
to answer questions about the study. In addition,
