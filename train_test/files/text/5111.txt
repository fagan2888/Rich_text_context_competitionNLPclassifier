Height and Body Mass on the Mating
Market: Associations With Number of Sex
Partners and Extra-Pair Sex Among
Heterosexual Men and Women Aged 18­65
David A. Frederick1 and Brooke N. Jenkins1
Abstract
People with traits that are attractive on the mating market are better able to pursue their preferred mating strategy. Men who are
relatively tall may be preferred by women because taller height is a cue to dominance, social status, access to resources, and
heritable fitness, leading them to have more mating opportunities and sex partners. We examined height, education, age, ethnicity,
and body mass index (BMI) as predictors of sexual history among heterosexual men and women (N ¼ 60,058). The linear and
curvilinear associations between self-reported height and sex partner number were small for men when controlling for education,
BMI, and ethnicity (linear b ¼ .05; curvilinear b ¼ À.03). The mean and median number of sex partners for men of different heights
were: very short (9.4; 5), short (11.0; 7), average (11.7; 7), tall (12.0; 7), very tall (12.1; 7), and extremely tall (12.3; 7). Men who
were ``overweight'' reported a higher mean and median number of sex partners than men with other body masses. The results for
men suggested limited variation in reported sex partner number across most of the height continuum, but that very short men
report fewer partners than other men.

Introduction
The primary goal of this study was to examine whether height
is linked to sexual history for men in ways that are predictable
based on mating market and evolutionary perspectives. In addi-
tion, we also examined how current body mass and how female
height, along with other traits, are linked to sexual history in a
sample of 60,058 heterosexual participants.
Possessing Attractive Traits on the Mating Market:
Potential Links With Sexual Behavior
The metaphor of the ``mating market'' can illuminate patterns
of mate preferences and behaviors (Pawlowski & Dunbar,
1999). Mate choice is a two-way process. Who a person enters
into a relationship with depends on (a) what traits that person
prefers and (b) what traits potential partners prefer. If a person
possesses preferred traits, then that person has a strong bargain-
ing hand when seeking a mate. If that person possesses
nonpreferred traits, then that person has a weak bargaining
hand. People with more attractive traits are in a better position
to pursue their preferred mating strategy on the mating market.
This mating market perspective can explain how the mate pre-
ferences of one sex dictate the bargaining hands and mating
strategies of members of the other sex.
Both men and women pursue short-term and long-term mat-
ing strategies, but men are more open than women to sexual
encounters across a wide variety of contexts (Buss & Schmitt,
1993; Schmitt et al., 2012). This gender difference may
emerge, in part, due to the fact that men have higher reproduc-
tive potential and lower obligatory biological costs associated

with reproduction (Trivers, 1972). The preferred mating strat-
egy, therefore, may vary systematically by gender.
For many men, pursuing short-term strategies or a combi-
nation of short-term and long-term strategies may be the pre-
ferred mating strategy. Not all men, however, can successfully
pursue short-term strategies. Strategic pluralism theory sug-
gests that men who are in good condition and possess attractive
traits are better able to pursue short-term mating opportunities
and will, therefore, have more sex partners (Gangestad &
Simpson, 2000). For example, men who are more muscular
than average are rated more attractive and report more sex
partners, brief sexual affairs, and affairs with mated women
(Frederick & Haselton, 2007).
Using evolutionary mating market perspectives, it is diffi-
cult to make a priori predictions regarding the links between
attractiveness and sexual behavior for women. Very attractive
women are in the best position to be particularly choosy and to
secure an attractive long-term partner who possesses resources,
kindness, and willingness to invest in her and her offspring,
leading to attractive women having fewer sexual partners. On
the other hand, if attractive women receive the most solicita-
tions for mating, this could lead to attractive women having
more partners. Past research has found that self-rated attrac-
tiveness is weakly correlated with sexual experience for
women, but ratings of women's attractiveness by independent
judges do not generally correlate with sexual history (for a brief
review, see Weeden & Sabini, 2007).
What traits are attractive to men and women that might
impact their desirability on the mating market and thus may
ultimately impact their sexual experiences and dating opportu-
nities? Here we focus on height and body mass and provide
explanations for why people may attend to these aspects of the
body when selecting mates.
Theoretical Perspectives on Preferences for Relatively Tall
Men
Women may prefer relatively tall men because tall height is a
cue to indirect (genetic) benefits or because of the direct ben-
efits that taller men may provide. Alternatively, or in addition,
taller men may be more effective in intrasexual competition,
which can result in more mating opportunities (for a review,
see Stulp & Barrett, 2014). Finally, there are also likely socio-
cultural factors that increase women's preferences for rela-
tively taller men.
Mate choice for indirect benefits. Indirect benefits are conferred to
offspring of females through genetic inheritance. Some traits
can only be produced by men with certain heritable qualities,
resistance to disease, and low genetic mutation loads (Kaplan
& Gangestad, 2005; Kokko, Brooks, Jennions, & Morley,
2003; Sear, 2010). Men who are tall may have a reproductive
advantage if tall stature is a cue that the male was in good
condition or if developing taller stature would enhance the
attractiveness or reproductive success of offspring. Height
itself is highly heritable, with estimates placing heritability
around 0.80 (Macgregor, Cornes, Martin, & Visscher, 2006;
McEvoy & Visscher, 2009; Silventoinen, Kaprio, Lahelma,
Viken, & Rose, 2001; Silventoinen, Krueger, Bouchard,
Kaprio, & McGue, 2004). Women who chose taller men as
mates could directly pass this propensity for taller height to
offspring, and, therefore, women prefer taller men as mates.
Mate selection for direct benefits. In contrast to indirect benefits,
selection for direct benefits refers to the idea that females
choose a mate because he possesses a trait that directly
increases her health, survival, or lifetime reproductive output.
This can include selection of males who provide superior
resources, offer more parental care, or otherwise reduce female
reproductive costs (Kokko et al., 2003). Height may be a par-
ticularly useful cue of access to resources and socioeconomic
status (Cassidy, 1991; Judge & Cable, 2004; Murasko, 2013;
Ranasinghe et al., 2011). Women who preferred tall men as
mates could have experienced greater reproductive success
because of the direct benefits that taller men may have been
able to provide. These benefits could include resources and
protection in either a short-term or a long-term mating context,
and, thus, women may prefer taller men as mates (or may
happen to choose taller men as mates when they exercise their
preferences for access to resources or socioeconomic status).
Intrasexual competition. Although much research in evolutionary
psychology has focused on the importance of female choice
(e.g., Frederick, Reynolds, & Fisher, 2013; Gallup & Frederick,
2010; Miller, 2000), intrasexual competition also plays an
important role in human mating (Puts, 2010). Taller men may
be better able to intimidate rivals and thus gain control of
resources or access to mates. Taller men are viewed as more
dominant, more masculine, and better fighters. They are also
more likely to be stronger, able to strike with greater force, hold
positions of authority in the workplace, be less sensitive to cues
of dominance in other men, be perceived as leaders, and exhibit
greater aggression and interpersonal dominance (for reviews,
see Blaker et al., 2013; Carrier, 2011; Stulp, Buunk, Verhulst,
& Pollet, 2013, 2015).
Social norms. One explanation for women's preferences for tal-
ler men is that cultural transmission of certain ideals and beha-
viors is internalized by men and women, in particular, cultures.
Men are expected to display masculine traits, and tallness may
be perceived as a social cue of masculinity. If a man is shorter
than his partner, this may cause people to view the man as less
masculine and the woman as less feminine and lead to social
stigma. Past research has only found weak correlations, how-
ever, between women's preferences for taller men and endor-
sement of male gender roles and norms (Salska et al., 2008;
Swami et al., 2008).
Preferences for Male Height
Consistent with multiple evolutionary perspectives, height is
considered an important feature of male attractiveness (for a
review, see Courtiol, Raymond, Godelle, & Ferdy, 2010). In
2 Evolutionary Psychology
two studies, women were more likely than men to indicate that
height matters when selecting a mate (Salska et al., 2008;
Yancey & Emerson, 2014), and taller men were more likely
to be selected for dates at speed dating events (Kurzban &
Weeden, 2005). In a study of personal advertisements, rela-
tively short men were less likely to be contacted than other
men. Tall men, however, did not appear to have an advantage
over medium height men (Pawlowski & Koziel, 2002). Past
research has found that taller men were more likely than shorter
men to find a long-term partner and to have multiple long-term
partners (Nettle, 2002a). Men who are shorter than average
appear to be at a disadvantage on the mating market: Their
partners are more likely to be less healthy, have lower incomes
and education, and have higher body mass index (BMI; Stulp,
Mills, Pollet, & Barrett, 2014).
Preferences for taller men, however, are not universal across
all women within a culture or across cultures. One study found
that among the Himba of northern Namibia, 52% of women
preferred a taller partner, 34% of women preferred a partner
of the same height, and 14% preferred a shorter partner
(Sorokowski, Sorokowska, Fink, & Mberira, 2012). Among the
Datoga people of Tanzania, only half (52%) of women pre-
ferred a taller partner (Sorokowski & Butovskaya, 2012).
One key to many women's preferences is that they tend to
prefer relatively taller men, not necessarily very tall men
(Courtiol et al., 2010; Pawlowski, 2003; Salska et al., 2008;
Stulp, Buunk, & Pollet, 2013). The association between height
and reproductive success across different cultures is frequently
curvilinear, with the very shortest men having the fewest chil-
dren and men in the center of the distribution having the most
(for a review, see Stulp, Pollet, Verhulst, & Buunk, 2012).
Extremely tall men are more likely to be excluded from the
dating pools of shorter women and may have fewer dating
options compared with men who are slightly taller than
average.
Preferences for Male Body Mass
Cross-cultural research on preferences for male body mass is
limited. In a U.S. sample, very slender and very fat men were
preferred less than other men (Frederick & Haselton, 2007). In
a study of 41 sites across 26 countries, however, preferences for
body fat in men were highly variable (Frederick, Swami, & The
56 Members of the International Body Project, 2010). In West-
ern contexts, there is a strong curvilinear association between
BMI (weight/height2) and body satisfaction. Men in the ``nor-
mal/healthy'' and ``overweight'' categories typically feel most
satisfied with their bodies and evaluate their appearance more
positively, presumably because they are perceived to have a
healthy or athletic body-build (Frederick, Forbes, Grigorian, &
Jarcho, 2007; Frederick, Peplau, & Lever, 2006; Peplau et al.,
2009). It should be noted that the category overweight is a
medical classification and does not necessarily conform to
perceptions of who is overweight in a social context (e.g.,
George W. Bush fell in the middle of the overweight range
during his presidency; Kolata, 2004).
Preferences for muscularity are clearer. Men with toned and
muscular bodies are featured as prestigious and attractive in
popular U.S. media (Frederick, Fessler, & Haselton, 2005), are
rated more attractive than other men (Dixson, Dixson, Bishop,
& Parish, 2010; Frederick & Haselton, 2007; Gray & Freder-
ick, 2012), and report more sex partners (Frederick & Haselton,
2007; Lassek & Gaulin, 2009). Most men desire increased
muscularity to attract women and to be more successful in
intrasexual competition (Frederick, Buchanan, et al., 2007).
Men with very high or low muscularity, however, are rated
as less attractive than men with moderate muscularity (Freder-
ick & Haselton, 2007).
Both muscularity and body fat contribute to the overall body
mass. In the general population, BMI is strongly correlated
with body fat percentage. For example, BMI is strongly corre-
lated with abdominal visceral adipose tissue (range: r ¼ .61­
.69), abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue (range: r ¼ .86­
.93), and fat mass (range: r ¼ .91­.94; Camhi et al., 2011). The
associations of both body fat and muscularity with attractive-
ness are curvilinear (Frederick, Buchanan, et al., 2007; Freder-
ick & Haselton, 2007), and, therefore, we expected a
curvilinear association between BMI and number of sex
partners.
Preferences for Female Height
Using the logic of different evolutionary perspectives, it is less
clear what height men would prefer in women. On the one
hand, whereas it may be advantageous for males to allocate
significant resources to developing tall body size in order to
compete with rivals and to signal their fitness or social status to
potential mates, female reproductive success may be enhanced
by allocating available energy toward other processes such as
enhancing fertility, pregnancy, lactation, and somatic upkeep
(see Hrdy, 1981; Nettle, 2002b; Stearns, 1992; Stulp, Verhulst,
Pollet, & Buunk, 2012). Shorter women also have a larger
potential dating pool because women typically prefer men who
are taller than themselves and men typically prefer women who
are their height or shorter (Salska et al., 2008). Based on this
logic, one might expect that shorter women would have more
mating opportunities.
On the other hand, tall female height may be valued to the
extent that height in women is a cue of access to resources,
healthy development, dominance, and high status. Taller
female height may be valuable because taller females may have
relatively taller sons who might increase both their and their
mate's reproductive success. It is clear that in some contexts,
tall women are viewed as attractive. Prestigious mass media
models, playgirl models, and beauty pageant winners tend to be
taller than the average woman (Spitzer, Henderson, & Zivian,
1999). Taller women may be perceived to be more dominant
than shorter women (Boyson, Pryor, & Butler, 1999), have
higher social esteem and higher incomes (Judge & Cable,
2004), and be more satisfied with their height (Lever, Freder-
ick, Laird, & Sadeghi-Azar, 2007). In one speed dating study,
although women preferred men who were 25 cm taller on
Frederick and Jenkins 3
average, men preferred women who were only 7 cm shorter on
average (Stulp, Buunk, Kurzban, & Verhulst, 2013). Based on
these findings, one might expect that taller women might have
more mating opportunities, but it is difficult to make any a
priori predictions regarding the links between height and sexual
history for women.
Preferences for Female Body Mass
The existing research on body mass provides a clearer pic-
ture regarding which female body types are considered most
attractive. Preferences for body fat level in women vary
substantially across cultures, with relative thinness being
considered most attractive in most industrialized countries
(Frederick, Forbes, & Berezovskaya, 2008; Gray & Frederick,
2012; Swami et al., 2010). Women at the lower end of the
``normal'' range of BMI in industrialized countries are gen-
erally rated most attractive, and BMI is a particularly strong
predictor of attractiveness ratings (Swami & Tovee, 2005;
Tov´
ee, Reinhardt, Emery, & Cornelissen, 1998). In parallel,
women who have higher body masses tend to be less satis-
fied with their appearance than women with lower body
masses (Frederick, Forbes, et al., 2007; Frederick et al.,
2006). Popular media and news media often promote the
idea that higher BMI is linked to poorer health, which
causes people to have more negative attitudes toward
women (and men) with higher body masses (Saguy, Freder-
ick, & Gruys, 2014). Thus, slender women likely have the
greatest bargaining hand in industrialized countries. It is
unclear, however, whether having a stronger bargaining
hand and greater attractiveness will lead to more or fewer
sex partners for women.
Hypotheses and Research Questions
Hypothesis 1: Taller men will report a more extensive sex-
ual history than shorter men (although this association may
be curvilinear, given very tall men are not preferred by very
short women). If the link between height and sex history is
strongly linear across the entire height continuum, even at
the high end, this may indicate that other factors than female
choice for indirect benefits are leading to more sex partners
among tall men (e.g., intrasexual competition; direct bene-
fits such as ability to provide resources). If the association is
strongly curvilinear (e.g., inverted U-shaped), this is consis-
tent with the proposal that women's preferences are dictat-
ing men's mating opportunities.
Hypothesis 2: Men in middle BMI ranges will report a more
extensive sexual history than underweight or obese men.
Research Question: What are the associations between
height, BMI, and sexual history for women? We explored
these links but were unable to make clear a priori predic-
tions with the exception that thinner women, who have the
strongest bargaining hand, would be less likely to be
single.
Material and Method
Participant Recruitment
We analyzed the results of an online survey of heterosexual
participants (N ¼ 60,058) with a mean age of 37 (SD ¼ 11).
The present study is based on secondary analyses of anon-
ymous data collected via a survey posted on the official website
of NBC News for 10 days along with other websites (e.g.,
ELLE.com). The study was advertised as the ``ELLE/
MSNBC.com Sex and Love Survey designed for both men and
women'' in order to attract a diverse group of participants. Only
participants who completed the survey via the MSNBC.com
portal were included in the analyses.
Market research on NBCNews.com (formerly MSNBC.
com) shows that at the time of the survey it routinely ranked
among one of the most popular websites in the United States.
Its 58-million unique monthly visitors include a broad diversity
of people in terms of age, income, and political orientation
(NBCNews.com Media Kit, 2012; note that msnbc.com, the
general news website, was a different entity than MSNBC
TV and had substantially different demographics, including
approximately equal numbers of Democrats and Republicans).
Data sets garnered through this site have been used to examine
sexual jealousy (Frederick & Fales, 2014), sexual history
(Fales, Frederick, Garcia, Gildersleeve, Haselton, & Fisher,
in press), sexual regrets (Galperin et al., 2013), friendship (Gil-
lespie, Frederick, Harari, & Grov, 2015; Gillespie, Lever, Fre-
derick, & Royce, 2014), and aspects of body image (Frederick,
Lever, & Peplau, 2007; Frederick et al., 2006; Frederick,
Peplau, & Lever, 2008; Lever et al., 2007; Lever, Frederick,
& Peplau, 2006; Peplau et al., 2009).
Participants
Of the 60,058 heterosexual participants, 52% were men (Mage
¼ 40; SDage
¼ 11) and 48% were women (Mage
¼ 34; SDage
¼
10). Sexual orientation was determined in response to a ques-
tion asking participants to identify as heterosexual, bisexual, or
gay/lesbian. The reported ethnicities were 86% White/Cauca-
sian(n ¼ 51,731),3% Black/African American (n ¼ 1,999), 4%
Hispanic/Latino(a) (n ¼ 2,313), 2% Asian/Pacific Islander
(n ¼ 1,449), 3% other or mixed ethnicity (n ¼ 1,683), and
2% preferred not to say (n ¼ 883). The sample was diverse in
terms of education, with participants reporting some high
school education or less (1%), high school degree (9%),
some college or associates degree (35%), college degree
(36%), and postgraduate degree (19%). We did not collect
information on what country they currently resided in. In
another data set collected via this website, however, over
97% of participants indicated they were living in the United
States and 99% reported living in the United States or
Canada (Frederick, Sandhu, Morse, & Swami, 2015).
Finally, in one data set participants were asked to indicate
their zip code, and over 95% of participants provided a U.S.
zip code, with 5% declining to provide a zip code (Gillespie
et al., 2014, 2015).
4 Evolutionary Psychology
Predictors
Height. Participants were asked ``how tall are you'' and were
given a drop-down menu where they could record their height
from 401000 or under to 60700þ. In regression analyses, the con-
tinuous measure of height was used as the predictor variable.
To facilitate data presentation, we then conducted a series of
analyses where participants were split into six categories con-
sisting of approximately 3-inch intervals, starting with the
``average'' category encompassing the U.S. average population
height for men and for women +1 inch, and then moving up
and down in 3-inch categories. Due to the way height was
distributed, some of the extreme categories (short women and
extremely tall men) do not contain precisely 3-inch intervals.
We label these categories: very short, short, average, tall,
very tall, and extremely tall. For men, these were very short
(50200­50400; 157­164 cm; 1%), short (50500­50700; 165­171 cm;
9%), average (50800­501000; 172­178 cm; 33%), tall (501100­60100;
179­186 cm; 40%), very tall (60200­60400; 187­194 cm; 15%),
and extremely tall (60500þ; greater than 194 cm; 2%). For
women, these were very short (401100 or less; 151 cm or less;
1%), short (50000­50200; 152­159 cm; 17%), average (50300­50500;
160­166 cm; 38%), tall (50600­50800; 167­174 cm; 33%), very
tall (50900­501100; 175­182 cm; 10%), and extremely tall (60000­
60200; 183­189 cm; 1%).
BMI. Participants were asked ``how much do you weigh'' and
were given a drop-down menu where they could record their
weight so that BMI could be calculated (weight/height2). The
drop-down started at <85 pounds and then in intervals of 5 from
86 to 200 (e.g., 85­89), and then by 10 from 200 to 300 (e.g.,
200­209). These were recoded at the midpoint of each range
(e.g., 87). The continuous BMI variable was used in regression
analyses. The mean BMIs were in the overweight range for
men (M ¼ 27.8; SD ¼ 4.4) and for women (M ¼ 25.5;
SD ¼ 5.9).
We created BMI categories using Centers for Disease Con-
trol and Prevention (CDC) guidelines. The percentages of men
and women who fell into each category of the BMI CDC vari-
able were underweight (<18.5; 2%), healthy weight (18.5­
24.99; 39%), overweight (25­29.99; 37%), obese (30­39.99;
15%), and morbidly obese (40.0þ; 7%). For some analyses, we
created a BMI CDC SPLIT variable where BMI was further
broken down into nine categories: underweight (<18.5; 2%),
low healthy (18.5­20.99; 10%), mid healthy (21­22.99; 13%),
upper healthy (23­24.99; 16%), lower overweight (25­27.5;
20%), upper overweight (27.51­29.99; 16%), obese I (30­
34.99; 15%), obese II (35­40; 6%), and obese III (>40; 2%).
Education. In order to retain the relative ordering of the educa-
tion levels when using education as a predictor variable (Pasta,
2009), education was coded from lower (0 ¼ some high school
education or less) to higher (4 ¼ postgraduate degree).
Ethnicity. This variable was dummy coded with Whites as the
reference group.
Sex History Outcome Measures
For convenience, when referring to the collective set of out-
come variables, we use the phrase ``sex history variables''
rather than ``sex history and current relationship variables.''
Number of sex partners. Participants indicated ``In total, since
you've been sexually active, about how many sex partners have
you had?'' Response options ranged from 0 to 14 by ones and
then 15­20 (recoded 18), 21­25 (recoded 23), 26­50 (recoded
30), or more than 50 (recoded 50). Due to the fact that the
variable was mostly continuous but with some unequal
increases at the tail end of the variable, we also created two
categorical outcome variables: more than 5 sex partners and
more than 14 sex partners, as described below.
More than five sex partners. We created a dichotomous variable
that indicated whether people had greater than five partners
(56% of women and 58% of men; code ¼ 1) or five or fewer
(44% of women and 42% of men, code ¼ 0).
More than 14 sex partners. We also created a dichotomous vari-
able that indicated whether people had more than 14 partners
(23% of women and 29% of men; code ¼ 1) or 14 or fewer
(77% of women and 71% of men; code ¼ 0).
Extra-pair sex. Participants were asked ``Have you had sex with
another person since you became serious with your partner?''
coded 0 ¼ no and 1 ¼ yes. Note that this item does not assess
infidelity per se, but rather any instance in which an individual
has sex with someone other than their partner (e.g., could
include ``swinging'').
Relationship status. Participants indicated their current relation-
ship status. The percentage of men and women indicating each
status was not currently dating (9%), dating or seeing more than
one person (3%), dating or seeing one person (17%), living
together but not married (12%), married (54%), or remarried
(5%). To test whether or not height or BMI predicted the like-
lihood of being single, people who were not currently dating
were coded as 1 and all other participants were coded as 0.
Overview of Data Analysis Strategy
Regressions, multicollinearity, and curvilinear relationships. Linear
regressions were conducted for the continuous sex partner
number variable, and logistic regressions were conducted on
all of the other outcome measures. Tolerance was high (0.90­
1.0) and VIF was low (<2.5) for all analyses, suggesting that
multicollinearity was not an issue. All continuous predictor
variables were z scored. In all regression analyses, BMI and
height were entered simultaneously to examine the linear asso-
ciations between these variables and sexual history, as is com-
monly recommended (e.g., Michels, Greenland, & Rosner,
1998). BMI is one's body mass independent of their height
(or more specifically, weight per unit of height2), and as a
result, height and BMI are essentially uncorrelated (in this
Frederick and Jenkins 5
sample, r ¼ .05 for women and r ¼ .01 for men). The BMI
measure enables us to directly compare body masses of people
with differing heights. Entering BMI and height as predictors
allows us to examine the effect of having a higher body mass
given a certain height. The interaction term was entered to
determine whether the association between BMI (i.e., weight
per inch) and number of sex partners differs by height. The
squared BMI and height variables were entered as predictors
to test the curvilinear associations with sexual history.
One concern with these data is that BMI might change
across the life span, and thus current BMI might differ from
BMI at the time a person was accruing sex partners or having
extra-pair sex. In this sample, there was a weak correlation
between BMI and age for men (r ¼ .13) and women
(r ¼ .14). We entered age as a predictor in the model.
Additionally, education level may be linked to height, BMI,
and sexual behavior. We elected to treat education as a con-
tinuous predictor in order to examine the linear relationship
between increasing education level and sexual history (see
Pasta, 2009). There were weak but statistically significant cor-
relations of education to height (men, r ¼ .04; women, r ¼ .07)
and to BMI (men, r ¼ À.08; women, r ¼ À.11). Finally, eth-
nicity might covary with BMI, height, and sexual history, and,
thus, ethnicity was included as a predictor. It is also possible
that the link between the predictor variables and the sex history
variables varies by ethnicity. Although we had no a priori
hypotheses regarding ethnic differences, we analyzed the
results without any interactions with ethnicity and again with
all interactions of each predictor with ethnicity (dummy coded
with White as the reference group). To conserve space and
because few interactions were statistically significant, we
describe any significant interactions in text rather than present-
ing all 24 interactions for each analysis in the table.
Skew and kurtosis. Skew and kurtosis were within acceptable
ranges for all variables. The sex partner variable did, however,
have a subgroup of individuals scoring relatively high, leading
the mean to be higher than the median. We analyzed the results
once with the sex partner outcome variable and once with a log-
transformed version. The pattern of results did not change, and
thus we report the results for the nonlog-transformed version.
We also report median number of partners and the percentage
of participants who have more than 5 and more than 14 sex
partners according to their BMI and height categories.
BMI and height categorical variables. One-way analyses of var-
iance were conducted to examine the main effects of height
group (six categories) and the two BMI group variables (five
and nine categories) on number of sex partners for each gender.
Post hoc least significant difference tests were then conducted
to examine whether groups differed from the central categories
for the height groups, BMI CDC 5, and BMI CDC SPLIT 9
category variables (Table 1).
Statistical significance and effect size. Our large sample size
enabled us to detect even miniscule effects. Further, we
conducted numerous statistical tests, raising the possibility of
Type I errors. As a result, we set the level for determining
statistical significance at p < .001. Even with the more stringent
criteria for statistical significance, however, correlation (r) and
b (i.e., standardized coefficient) values as small as .02 were
statistically significant when using the full samples of men or
women. Therefore, in addition to reporting statistical signifi-
cance, we also attend to effect size. There are established rough
guidelines for interpreting Cohen's d effect sizes as small (.20),
moderate (.50), or large (.80; Cohen, 1988).
Overview of data presentation in tables. Table 1 shows the mean
sex partner number for height and BMI categories in men and
women. Table 2 shows the percentage of participants who had
more than 5 sex partners, had more than 14 partners, who
engaged in extra-pair sex, and who are currently single. Table 3
presents the linear regression analyses predicting the number of
sex partners. Table 4 presents the results of logistic regression
analyses predicting the dichotomous outcome variables for the
full samples of men and women.
Overview of data presentation in figures. Figure 1 shows the mean
sex partner number for heterosexual men and women for each
inch of height containing at least 25 participants. Figure 2
shows the mean sex partner number for each BMI unit for
which there are at least 25 participants.
Results
Hypothesis 1: Taller men will report a more extensive sex-
ual history (although this association may be curvilinear).
Mean differences. Contrary to our expectations, as shown in
Table 1, there was little variation in mean number of sex part-
ners across most of the height continuum. Looking at mean
differences in the number of partners between the tall men and
other categories, only the very short men differed from tall men
by an effect size larger than d ¼ .20, reporting fewer partners
(d ¼ À.22). The mean number of partners for every inch of
height can be seen in Figure 1.
Regressions. Regression analyses examining height as a predic-
tor found that height was a weak but statistically significant
predictor of number of sex partners in the overall sample (linear
b ¼ .07; curvilinear b ¼ À.04), with height being linked to
higher sex partner number more so at the lower end of the
height continuum than at the higher end (Table 3). Adding
interaction terms with ethnicity did not notably increase per-
centage of variation explained in number of sex partners by the
predictors (adjusted R2 from .044 to .046). None of the inter-
actions between ethnicity and height or height2 were significant
at the p < .001 level, although the interaction of Black ethnicity
with height was close to this threshold (p ¼ .005). At first
glance, it appeared that the linear association between height
and sex partner number was stronger for Black men than for
White men, but this was primarily due to the fact that very short
Black men (50200­50400; 158­163 cm) reported substantially
6 Evolutionary Psychology
fewer partners than other Black men. When restricting the
sample to men 50500 (165 cm) or taller, the associations of height
to sex partners for Black men were similar to other ethnic
groups and there was no significant interaction of Black ethni-
city with height (p ¼ .63).
Height did not predict history of engaging in extra-pair sex,
but there were weak linear and curvilinear associations of
height with most of the other categorical sex history variables
(Table 4). There were no significant interactions with ethnicity.
Hypothesis 2: Men in middle BMI ranges will report a more
extensive sexual history than underweight or obese men
Mean differences. Consistent with the hypothesis that men in the
middle body mass ranges would have the most partners, over-
weight men had the highest number of sex partners (median ¼
8, mean ¼ 12.8; see Table 1). Compared to the overweight
men, fewer partners were reported by underweight men (med-
ian ¼ 4, mean ¼ 8.2, d ¼ À.40) and obese III men (median ¼ 5,
mean ¼ 9.3, d ¼ À.30). Differences from other groups were
smaller than d ¼ .20.
Regressions. Consistent with our expectations, there was a curvi-
linear association between BMI and number of sex partners in
the overall sample, and technically, the linear association was
statistically significant despite the small effect size (linear
b ¼ .03; curvilinear b ¼ À.10; Table 3). In particular, men
in the middle BMI ranges had reported having more partners
than men at the ends of the distribution. This pattern can be
seen clearly in Figure 2, where mean number of sex partners is
plotted for each unit of BMI. There were no significant inter-
actions with ethnicity.
The linear and curvilinear associations of BMI and BMI2
were generally weak with the categorical sex history variables,
with the exception of likelihood of being single (linear OR ¼
0.62; curvilinear OR ¼ 1.22; Table 4). Relatively thinner men
were more likely to be single, with little variation among over-
weight­morbidly obese men. There were no significant inter-
actions with ethnicity.
Research Question: What are the associations between
height, BMI, and sexual history for women?
All other comparisons between tall women and other
women were smaller than d ¼ .20 in size, except very short
women had fewer partners than tall women (d ¼ À.20; Table 1).
Underweight women reported the fewest partners (7.8), which
were fewer partners than both healthy weight (d ¼ À.20) and

CDC and BMI CDC SPLIT categories, the mean number of sex
partners ranged from 9.2 to 10.6. In regressions, however, all
associations were quite weak even when significant (Tables 3

Discussion
Key Findings for Men
Height. The existing literature has generally found that rela-
tively tall men (but not extremely tall men) are consistently
considered more attractive to women (Courtiol et al., 2010;
Salska et al., 2008; Swami et al., 2008). Interestingly, however,
men's reported sexual behavior only partially reinforced the
preference data. Consistent with the idea that women prefer
relatively tall men, the shortest men in the sample reported
fewer partners than other men. These findings confirm that
height is relevant on the mating market. Across most of the
height continuum, however, there was little variation in mean
or median number of reported sex partners. Further, men
between 50700 and 60300 (170­191 cm) varied little in whether
they had more than 5 partners, had more than 14 partners,
engaged in extra-pair sex, or were currently single. Given that
very tall men may have a smaller dating pool, the lack of
downturn among taller men in number of sex partners may
indicate that these males are successfully using intrasexual
competition or direct benefits to obtain more mating opportu-
nities, a point future research may clarify.
The relatively limited variation in sex partner number for
men across much of the height continuum is difficult to
explain. Research on other traits generally considered attractive
to women has found that men with these traits have more sex
partners (e.g., muscularity; Frederick & Haselton, 2007; Lassek
& Gaulin, 2009). One possibility is that women may prefer
relatively tall height, but other factors more strongly dictate
sexual behavior. Research on the relative importance women
place on height versus other traits would clarify this matter.
The existing research, however, suggests that height is an
important component of women's mate preferences: One study

found that women gave height the fifth highest rating out of
21 traits for how desirable it is in their ideal mate (Montoya,
2007). It is possible that for most women there is a certain
minimal threshold of height, after which they will consider a
male as a potential sex partner, and thus men above that height
end up with similar numbers of sex partners (e.g., Salska et al.,
2008). Finally, if relatively taller men are chosen more often as
long-term partners, this may reduce the total number of sex
partners they have time or ability to pursue. Future research
can determine if the patterns found in this study are replicable.
Body mass. Men in the normal and overweight categories
reported the highest number of sex partners and engaged in
extra-pair sex more often than men in the underweight or obese
categories. As previously mentioned, it may be the men in the
normal and overweight categories who are perceived to be the
most athletic, healthy, powerful, or muscular, and previous
research has shown that men in these middle BMI ranges (nor-
mal/healthy and overweight) feel most confident in their bodies
(Frederick, Forbes, et al., 2007; Frederick et al., 2006; Peplau
et al., 2009). Although it might be initially surprising that over-
weight men reported the highest number of partners, it is
important to note that the medical classification overweight
does not necessarily map onto social perceptions of who is
overweight. Our findings suggest that possessing this body
type, or associated traits (e.g., confidence), may translate to
these men having higher numbers of sex partners.
Key Findings for Women
Height. Our examination of the relationships between height
and sex partner number for women was exploratory. These
analyses generally revealed no associations or very weak
associations between height and sexual history. Very short
women reported fewer partners compared to tall women
(although this effect size was small).
Body mass. Generally speaking, there was little variation in the
number of sex partners for women of differing body masses.
Underweight women, however, reported fewer partners than
other women. This parallels the finding that underweight men
had fewer partners as well. Very slender women may be highly
dissatisfied with their weight and be suffering from anorexia
and thus motivated to not expose their bodies. Additionally,
however, being in the underweight category is associated with
relatively high mortality rate (Flegal, Graubard, Williamson, &
Gail, 2005). It is also possible that underweight individuals
may be more likely to be suffering from a variety of ailments
and wasting diseases that cause weight loss and thus may have
fewer sex partners because they are more likely to be dealing
with serious health issues. Alternatively, attractiveness may
play a role here: Very slender women may be highly attractive
(Kos
´cin
´ski, 2013), but attractive women may also be very
choosy (Buss & Shackelford, 2008) and, therefore, have fewer
partners.
Limitations and Strengths
This study provided a unique look at the links between height,
BMI, and sexual history. Although our sample was unusually
large and diverse, it was not nationally representative. It is
possible that the survey title ``Sex and Love'' appealed to peo-
ple with more liberal attitudes toward sex. For example, the
median number of sex partners reported in one nationally rep-
resentative survey of adults aged 30­44 was around seven
female sexual partners for men and four male sexual partners
for women (Mosher, Chandra, & Jones, 2005). The median
number of sex partners in our sample was slightly higher (eight
for men and eight for women ages 30­44). On the other hand,
the rates of extra-pair sex in our sample were similar to other
large-scale studies (Blow & Hartnett, 2005). A further issue is
what, precisely, number of sex partners indicates. It is not a
measure of reproductive success and is not a direct measure of
sexual strategy (e.g., a man with 10 partners may have had
multiple partners simultaneously or a series of monogamous
relationships). We took number of sex partners to be one rough
indicator of men's appeal on the mating market, but multiple
factors influence number of sex partners (e.g., attractiveness,
how coercive a male is, and income).
A related issue is that some people might purposely misre-
port answers to key variables in socially desirable ways.
Furthermore, when reporting number of sex partners, different
people might be using different criteria for who counts as a sex
partner (Brown & Sinclair, 1999; Cecil, Bogart, Wagstaff, Pin-
kerton, & Abramson, 2002). Men and women may not always
accurately report their height and/or weight. In a review of 64
studies on self-reported versus directly measured height and
weight, self-reported measures differ only slightly from peo-
ple's actual heights and weights (Gorber, Tremblay, Moher, &

Gorber, 2007). Consistent with these findings, a study of over
4,000 British men and women found that self-reported and
measured height, weight, and BMI were strongly correlated
(rs > .90; Spencer, Appleby, Davey, & Key, 2002). Systematic
biases in responses across participants, however, could be pro-
blematic. For example, if men who exaggerate their height by
an inch or so are more likely to exaggerate their number of sex
partners, then this study may overestimate the strength of the

association between height and number of sex partners. Alter-
natively, if shorter men are more likely to overestimate their
number of sex partners, this would cause association between
height and sex partner number to be underestimated. Replicat-
ing this research with measured height and weight is a key
future direction. The research was also limited to a U.S. sam-
ple, and the distribution of BMIs in hunter-gatherer and hunter-
horticulturalist societies likely differs substantially from the
United States, making it important to examine how body fat
distribution and height are related to sexual behavior in less
industrialized settings.
A further limitation is that we only had reports of current
weight from participants. Some people may experience sub-
stantial fluctuations in weight, and, therefore, their current
weight may not reflect the weight they had when they were
accruing sex partners. When examining links to sexual history,
it would be valuable to also ask participants how many partners
they have had recently or while at their current weight.
This survey suffered the same limitation that most survey
research encounters: results were derived only from people
who chose to participate in the research study. Internet sam-
ples, including ours, tend to include participants who are rela-
tively more educated and have higher income than the national
population, but they also tend to be more diverse with respect to
gender, age, socioeconomic status, and geographic region than
nonprobability samples generated by many traditional data-
gathering methods (Gosling, Vazire, Srivastava, & John,
2004). Selection biases introduced by differential access to the
Internet have been minimized, as Internet use has grown more
commonplace (Rainie & Horrigan, 2005; U.S. Census Bureau,
2012). Given the broad-based appeal of the news website, we
were provided with a demographically diverse sample and an
opportunity to compare men and women who differed substan-
tially on this study's variables of interest. Surveys can be
completed with ease from the privacy of respondents' homes
or workplaces, thereby reaching individuals who would not
otherwise have the opportunity to participate in research stud-
ies. Our large sample enabled us to examine the data not only
by broad categories but also in detail by individual height in
inches and across the entire BMI continuum.
Conclusion
Height and body mass are traits that may be useful cues about
health, social status, and heritable fitness. These qualities are
valued by women, suggesting that tall men would have more
sex partners, whereas short men would have fewer. Surpris-
ingly, however, taller men did not report substantially more
sex partners than men other than very short men. This was
surprising, given women's clear preferences for relatively taller
men in Western cultures. These findings raise interesting ques-
tions regarding the mating strategies of men with average to
somewhat below average heights, and how well-stated prefer-
ences for height map on to actual sexual behavior.
