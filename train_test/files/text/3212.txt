Research Question
Europe has seen business cycle movements differ greatly across countries, which has re-
newed calls to introduce some form of public cross-country risk sharing, sometimes under
the name of a "fiscal union". It has been argued that the unemployment insurance system
is a good and politically viable channel to share risk across countries. In this paper, our
question is: If a group of countries were to introduce a common unemployment insurance
system, what should it look like?
Contribution
We answer the question using a two-country DSGE model. The model incorporates equi-
librium unemployment through search frictions in labor markets. Workers in each country
can only imperfectly insure unemployment risk and business cycle risks. Moreover, we
assume they cannot move across countries. The government in each country maintains
a mandatory unemployment insurance system with a balanced budget, while a suprana-
tional unemployment insurance agency is able to administer an additional component of
unemployment insurance system. We rule out permanent transfers between countries by
the supranational agency by requiring the expected value of transfers to be zero. Our
analysis combines the literature on international risk sharing and fiscal unions on one
hand, and the literature on the design of optimal unemployment insurance on the other
hand.
Results
Based on a theoretical model, we find that the supranational unemployment insurance
can be used to insure against country-level risk without affecting unemployment levels
if the levels of benefits and contributions can differ across countries and as a function
of country-specific shocks. Compared to nationally optimal policies, the optimal supra-
national insurance system is more generous in countries that are in a worse state of the
business cycle than the union average. Moving on to a quantitatively richer model cal-
ibrated to the core and the periphery of the Euro area, we find that transfers through
the supranational unemployment insurance system are indeed sizable. Furthermore, we
show that optimally designed unemployment insurance works like a fairly priced insurance
policy which cannot be replicated by using government debt and countercyclical national
deficits.

Abstract
We discuss how cross-country unemployment insurance can be used to improve
international risk sharing. We use a two-country business cycle model with incom-
plete financial markets and frictional labor markets where the unemployment insur-
ance scheme operates across both countries. Cross-country insurance through the
unemployment insurance system can be achieved without affecting unemployment
outcomes. The Ramsey-optimal policy however prescribes a more countercyclical
replacement rate when international risk sharing concerns enter the unemployment
insurance trade-off. We calibrate our model to Eurozone data and find that opti-
mal stabilizing transfers through the unemployment insurance system are sizable
and mainly stabilize consumption in the periphery countries, while optimal replace-
ment rates are countercylical overall. Moreover, we find that debt-financed national
policies are a poor substitute for fiscal transfers.

1 Introduction
Europe has seen business cycle movements differ greatly across countries. This develop-
ment, together with the resulting strains on public budgets, has renewed calls to introduce
some form of public cross-country risk sharing, sometimes under the name of a "fiscal
union". Indeed, a widely held view is that a common currency exacerbates the need for
international risk sharing mechanisms, and that fiscal transfers become desirable when
the private sector lacks such mechanisms (Mundell (1961), McKinnon (1963) and Kenen
(1969)).1
At the same time, high unemployment levels in many developed countries have led
to renewed interest in the design of unemployment insurance. In the Eurozone in par-
ticular, policy makers have argued that the unemployment insurance system is a good
and politically viable channel to share risk across countries. The EU Commissioner for
Employment, L´
aszl´
o Andor, states that "based on the expert work available to date, I
consider that the best form of [...] a countercyclical fiscal capacity at the EMU level
would be a scheme where the participating countries share part of the costs of short-term
unemployment insurance" (Andor, 2014). 2
Our question is: If a group of countries were to introduce a common unemployment
insurance system, what should it look like? We answer it using a two-country business
cycle model with search frictions in labor markets. Financial markets are incomplete and
labor is immobile across countries, so that country-specific risk and idiosyncratic unem-
ployment risk can only be partially insured privately. The government in each country
maintains a mandatory unemployment insurance system. In addition, a supranational
unemployment insurance agency is able to administer an additional component of the un-
employment insurance system. This component can differ across countries as a function
of country-specific shocks.
Starting with a simplified version of our model, we derive two theoretical insights.
First, a supranational unemployment insurance system can be used to insure against
country-level risk without affecting unemployment levels. The intuition is as follows.
Unemployment insurance affects unemployment levels by changing the relative value of
employment over unemployment, which determines incentives to search and wage bar-
gaining outcomes. When a country is to receive a fiscal transfer, this relative value can
be kept constant by simultaneously increasing the level of benefits and lowering the rate
of contributions to the unemployment insurance system. The opposite can be done in the
country which is to send the transfer.
Second, the presence of an international risk sharing motive introduces a counter-
cyclical element to the optimal unemployment insurance policy. Here, the intuition is
1See Furceri and Zdzienicka (2015) and Kalemli-Ozcan, Luttini, and Sørensen (2014) for recent evi-
dence on the lack of risk sharing mechanisms in the Euro area. Sørensen and Yosha (1998) also provided
comparable estimates in the past.
2A harmonized unemployment insurance system within the Eurozone as a tool for international risk
sharing has also been suggested by the President of the European Council (van Rompuy, 2012), the
International Monetary Fund (Blanchard, Jaumotte, and Loungani, 2014), the German Institute for
Economic Research (Bernoth and Engler, 2013), the French Advisory Council (Artus, Benassy-Quere,
Boone, Cailloux, Delpla, Farhi, Gourinchas, Tirole, and Wolff, 2013), Dolls, Fuest, Neumann, and Peichl
(2014), the Banca d'Italia (Brandolini, Carta, and D'Amuri, 2015) and B´
enassy-Qu´
er´
e, Ragot, and Wolff
(2016). Brenke (2013) also discusses some of the drawbacks.
1
as follows. The classic unemployment insurance trade-off for a social planner is between
efficiency of employment and insurance. Too much insurance reduces search effort and/or
job creation, while too little insurance harms risk-averse workers who cannot insure pri-
vately against unemployment risk. When international risk sharing is present, the planner
is shielding local consumption from fluctuations in local output. After a negative produc-
tivity shock in one country, the planner can then afford to provide more generous insurance
and shift employment towards countries where it is more productive. Therefore, insurance
becomes more countercyclical.
We then move on to a quantitatively richer model, where we calibrate the two countries
to the core and the periphery of the Euro area. We compute the Ramsey-optimal policy
and compare it with a policy of constant replacement rates and no international transfers,
as such policies are currently in place in most countries. In computing optimal policy,
we rule out permanent or perpetual transfers: A country can receive a transfer payment
in response to a shock (and does not have to pay it back in the future), but transfers
have to average out over time and in expectation, so that no country can expect to be a
permanent net contributor or net recipient to the scheme. In our baseline simulation, the
optimal unemployment insurance policy is countercyclical even without transfers, and it
becomes more generous when a country receives a transfer. The transfers themselves are
sizable: The periphery receives 0.70 percent of GDP for every percentage point drop in
its own GDP, but has to transfer an almost equal amount to the core for a percentage
point reduction in core GDP. However, there is overall very little country-specific business
cycle risk in the model, owing to it being calibrated to the high correlation of GDP
among Eurozone countries. As a result, transfers are unable to reduce consumption risk
everywhere, but rather they distribute it more evenly by shifting some risk from the highly
volatile periphery to the more stable core.
A common critique to a supranational unemployment insurance is that its objectives
could be achieved just as well by national policies financed with government debt. We
show that this argument does not hold: When transfers are replaced by debt as the
instrument of the Ramsey planner, the stabilization gains all but disappear. The reason
for this is that budget deficits have to be reversed in the future, but international transfers
only have to average out over time. This makes them much more effective at stabilizing
the economy. Fiscal risk sharing works much like a fairly priced insurance policy: Even
though, on average, the premia and expected payments net out to zero, one is still better
better off buying the insurance than taking out a bank loan in the event of "damage",
because the loan creates a large liability when times are bad.
Our results have one practical limitation, which is that we abstract from the politi-
cal moral hazard induced by risk sharing (Persson and Tabellini, 1996). It is plausible
that a fiscal transfer mechanism reduces incentives for national governments to carry out
structural reforms, and this is probably the main political reason for its opposition in
the Eurozone. In this paper, we acknowledge this concern insofar as we rule out policies
with permanent transfers from one country to another. However, our main focus is on
the potential economic benefits rather than the political economy.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. We briefly review the related
literature in Section 2. In Section 3, we lay out a simplified version of our model with
only two periods. This allows us to show our theoretical insights analytically and provide
intuition. In Section 4, we lay out the full dynamic model that we use for quantitative
2
analysis and calibrate it to the Euro area. Section 5 contains the numerical results from our
calibrated model. Section 6 discusses why government debt is not an effective replacement
for the risk sharing achieved by our unemployment insurance scheme. Section 7 concludes.
2 Related literature
Our analysis relates to the literature on international risk sharing and fiscal unions on one
hand, and the literature on the design of optimal unemployment insurance on the other
hand.
It is well known that the search externality in frictional labor markets can be corrected
using unemployment insurance. Because of costly search, employment ­ and the corre-
sponding fluctuations ­ may be too low or too high, depending mainly on the relation of
the workers' bargaining power to the matching elasticity. In the steady state, this can
be resolved by changing the outside option of workers through unemployment benefits
(Hosios, 1990). When workers are risk-averse, the correction of the search externality
needs to be weighed against the provision of insurance (Baily, 1978). Fredriksson and
Holmlund (2006) survey the literature on optimal unemployment insurance in static and
steady-state situations. More recently, interest has emerged in unemployment insurance
policies that depend on the state of the business cycle. Here, a central point of debate is
whether benefits should become more generous in a recession in order to increase insur-
ance (countercyclical policy), or less generous in order to mitigate the fall in employment
(procyclical policy). Earlier contributions such as Kiley (2003) and Sanchez (2008) sug-
gest that there is room for countercyclical unemployment benefits. Landais, Michaillat,
and Saez (2015) analyze a model with sticky wages and job rationing and find that a
countercyclical policy is optimal as the effect of insurance on equilibrium unemployment
is smaller in recessions. Albertini and Poirier (2015) and Kekre (2016) find that more
generous unemployment insurance can mitigate the aggregate demand deficiency when
the zero lower bound is binding. On the other side, Mitman and Rabinovich (2015)
numerically compute optimal dynamic policies and show that the cyclical stance of the
unemployment insurance is procyclical in a setting when workers' outside option leads
to inefficiently high wages. Moyen and St¨
ahler (2014) analyze the optimal cyclicality of
benefits holding their average level fixed. They show that there are situations in which
unemployment insurance should be countercyclical even when wages are directly affected
and the bargaining power of workers is too high relative to the Hosios condition.3 Jung
and Kuester (2015) analyze first-best policy with sufficiently many fiscal instruments.
They find that benefits should rise in recessions if hiring subsidies and layoff taxes also
rise at the same time. These two instruments increase the incentives to hire and decrease
those to fire workers, which may compensate partly for increased wage costs. However,
if hiring subsidies and layoff taxes are not adjusted, they also find procyclical benefits to
3Moyen and St¨
ahler (2014) compare the optimal benefit duration policy in Europe and the US. In their
European calibration, the bargaining power of workers is larger than the matching efficiency, implying
the optimal benefit to be negative in light of the Hosios condition. However, it is restricted to be positive.
Additionally, rule-of-thumb households make average marginal utility of consumption fluctuate relatively
much. It can be shown that steady-state benefits above optimum and relatively volatile marginal utility
of consumption make optimal benefit policy countercyclical even when the bargaining power of workers
is already high.

be optimal.
Importantly, the literature exclusively analyzes closed economies. Our paper instead
analyzes optimal policy when unemployment insurance can operate across multiple coun-
tries and faces the additional objective of sharing cross-country risk.
Turning to the literature on fiscal unions, Leduc, Dedola, and Corsetti (2009) have
shown that, when asset markets are incomplete, country-specific productivity disturbances
can have large uninsurable effects on wealth and consumption paths. In a prominent re-
cent paper, Farhi and Werning (2012) find that such uninsurable effects may be especially
large in a currency union with nominal rigidities. They suggest forming a transfer union
to insure against this risk. Many economists follow their view that, in federal unions,
a (fiscal) transfer mechanism to at least compensate for the uninsurable effects due to
nominal rigidities may be desirable. However, there is still some debate on how to ideally
establish such a transfer mechanism or a fiscal union (see Bargain, Dolls, Fuest, Neu-
mann, Peichl, Pestel, and Siegloch, 2013 and Bordo, Markiewicz, and Jonung, 2011 for a
discussion). Evers (2012) provides a quantitative assessment of federal transfer rules and
finds that targeting regional differences in labor income generates highest welfare gains,
which primarily stem from reducing the allocative inefficiencies of factor inputs caused
by nominal rigidities. Dmitriev and Hoddenbagh (2013) find that a tax union, in which
the steady state income tax are harmonized, has to be preferred to cross countries fiscal
transfers only if the Armington elasticity is low. Evers (2015) shows that a fiscal revenue
equalization system, that shares nominal tax revenues, destabilizes business cycles and
worsens welfare while a fully centralized fiscal authority does the opposite. While these
papers have mostly focused on symmetric countries, we show, in a model calibrated to
Eurozone data, that a transfer mechanism is desirable even without nominal rigidities.
3 Simplified model
The intuition for our results can best be seen in a two-period model that allows us to
analytically prove our results and provide a graphical representation. The model is highly
simplified: In particular, the real exchange rate is constant and the two countries are in
financial autarky. We will relax these assumptions in the quantitative part in the next
section.
3.1 Model setup
There are two countries, which we call Home and Foreign. Home is inhabited by a
mass   (0, 1) of workers, while Foreign is inhabited by a mass 1 -  of workers.
In each country, firms transform labor into a homogenous consumption good (in the
quantitative model of Section 4 we will introduce imperfect substitutability between Home
and Foreign goods). Firms are owned by workers, but make zero profits in equilibrium.
While consumption goods can be traded across countries in competitive markets, labor is
immobile across countries and labor markets are subject to search frictions within each
country.
In the first period, all workers start out as unemployed. In the second period, firms
post vacancies and are matched with workers. Production and consumption take place
4
only in the second period. Expected utility of a worker at Home in the first period is:
U = E [nu (ce
) + (1 - n) u (cu
)] (1)
where ce
is his consumption level if he turns out to be employed, and cu
his consumption
level if he turns out to be unemployed. n is the employment level per capita in the second
period.4 We assume logarithmic utility: u (c) = log (c).
In the second period, the number of vacancies is v and the number of matches is given
by
n = m
1-µ. (2)
where  is the tightness in the labor market. Since the initial stock of employment is zero,
employment in the second period equals the number of matches and market tightness
equals the number of vacancies.
A firm that posts a vacancy incurs a cost v
. The probability that the vacancy is filled
is q = m
-µ. In that case, the match produces a units of output and the worker gets paid
a wage w. This wage is determined using Nash bargaining, where the bargaining power
of workers is denoted  (the bargaining solution is described further below). A zero-profit
condition for vacancy creation prescribes
v
= q (a - w) (3)
We denote by y aggregate output in the Home country net of vacancy costs:
y = an - v
v (4)
The productivity a is a random variable which is only revealed in the second period. The
Foreign country has a similar structure to the Home country, but with possibly different
parameters. We denote Foreign variables with an asterisk, e.g. y for foreign output.
Home and foreign productivity (a, a) are the only sources of aggregate uncertainty.
Employed workers receive wages w which are taxed at the rate , while unemployed
workers receive unemployment benefits b. Payroll taxes  and benefits b are administered
by an unemployment insurance agency. We assume that the two countries are part of
an insurance union, such that the agency operates across both countries. It has to run a
balanced budget with the constraint:
 [(1 - n) b - nw] + (1 - ) [(1 - n) b - nw] = 0. (5)
3.2 Social planner problem
We first look at the social planner problem. A utilitarian social planner maximizes a
weighted average of worker utilities subject only to the resource constraint and the search

Here, ~
 is the relative weight the planner puts on workers in the Home country, which
might be more or less than the size of its population . Within a country, all workers are
ex-ante homogenous and so weighting of individual workers is inconsequential. The first
order conditions of the planner problem are standard:

The first two conditions are the Hosios conditions in each country, which determine the
number of vacancies that maximize aggregate output net of vacancy costs. The remaining
conditions prescribe full risk sharing within and across countries. The consumption levels
of employed and unemployed workers within each country should be identical, and each
country should consume a constant fraction of union output.
3.3 Optimal policy with private insurance
We now come back to the competitive equilibrium. Throughout this chapter, we assume
some form of international market incompleteness, since our focus is on how unemploy-
ment insurance can be used to overcome a lack of risk sharing. In this section, we allow
workers to only insure domestically against idiosyncratic unemployment risk. Since all
workers are ex-ante identical, it is optimal for a Home worker to fully diversify his risk
by selling his entire future income in exchange for a diversified portfolio of the income of
all other Home workers' income. In this case, the consumption levels of all Home workers
are equalized:
ce
= cu
= c. (6)
The wage w is assumed to be set by Nash bargaining. When workers have bargaining
power , the Nash-bargained wage is simply:
w (a, ) =
a
 + (1 - ) (1 - )
(7)
6
where  is the net replacement rate, defined as
 =
b
(1 - ) w
. (8)
A higher replacement rate improves workers' outside option and drives up wages. It
thereby lowers the incentives for job creation and reduces employment.
We want to know what the optimal unemployment insurance scheme looks like in this
situation. Our first result is that a transfer of resources from one country to another can be
implemented through the unemployment insurance system without affecting unemployment
levels.
We first note that the budget constraint of the unemployment insurance agency can
be rewritten as
0 =  (c - y) + (1 - ) (c - y) . (9)
We can therefore choose replacement rates ,  and a transfer from the Foreign to the
Home country T = c - y as a policy and back out the necessary benefits b, b, ,  from
the budget constraint. We obtain:
b = 
nw + T
n + (1 - n) 
(10)
 = 1 -
1
w
nw + T
n + (1 - n) 
. (11)
The unemployment level n and the wage w depend only on policy through the replace-
ment rate . Therefore, from the formula above we can see that a positive transfer from
Foreign to Home (T > 0) can be implemented by increasing unemployment benefits b and
at the same time lowering payroll taxes . This way, all workers get to consume more, but
the net replacement rate  stays constant and the relative bargaining position of workers
is unchanged. Since we generally have n > 1 - n, most of this transfer is achieved by
reducing the contributions by the employed. Increased benefits of the employed are only
a minor part of such a neutral transfer.
While it is possible to make transfers without affecting replacement rates, is this
also optimal? With privately insured unemployment risk, the insurance agency has to
mitigate three inefficiencies: search externalities in the Home and Foreign countries and
lack of international risk sharing. It also has three policy instruments: the Home and
Foreign replacement rates and a cross-country transfer. Indeed, there exists a policy that
eliminates all three inefficiencies. The replacement rates satisfying the Hosios condition
are
 =
µ - 
µ (1 - )
,  =
µ - 
µ (1 - )
. (12)
These rates do not depend on the realizations of a and a and are therefore constant.
They also do not depend on the planner weight ~
. The transfer T however does depend
on this weight. In principle, one can choose any value for ~
. We determine it by imposing
that transfers are zero in expectation:
E [T] = 0. (13)
7
This condition implicitly defines a value for ~
. This choice of the weight implies that
neither country expects to be systematically subsidizing the other country through the
unemployment insurance system. The value of the weight is
~
 = E [y]
E [y + (1 - ) y]
(14)
and the resulting transfer policy is
T = E [y] E [y]
E 
1-
y + y

-

. (15)
The Home country receives a transfer when its output is below average, but has to pay a
transfer when output in the Foreign country is below average.
3.4 Optimal policy without private insurance
So far we have abstracted from the most important objective of unemployment insurance,
namely to insure against unemployment. We now remove the possibility to privately
insure unemployment risk. In this case, the optimal policy becomes genuinely second-
best and trade-offs emerge between all three policy objectives: maximizing net output,
providing insurance between employed and unemployed, and providing insurance across
countries.
We eliminate all asset trade in Period 1 (in the quantitative model of Section 4 we
will allow for trade of a non-contingent bond across the border). The consumption levels
in Period 2 are simply:
ce
= (1 - ) w (16)
cu
= b = ce
(17)
The Nash-bargained wage now takes into account the curvature in the worker's utility
function. When workers have bargaining power , the bargained wage is:
w (a, ) =
a
 - (1 - ) log 
. (18)
In this situation, the social planner allocation is no longer feasible. Providing full
insurance against idiosyncratic unemployment risk calls for  = 1, but then the worker
captures the whole surplus (w = a) and job creation collapses to zero. We therefore have
to solve for the (second-best) Ramsey-optimal policy as follows:
max


n, , ce, ,
n, , ce, 


~
 E [nu (ce
) + (1 - n) u (ce
)]

)
+ (1 - ) (nc
e
+ (1 - n) c
e
)
=
 (an - v
)
+ (1 - ) (an - 
v
)
Here, we have substituted out most equilibrium conditions. In particular, choosing an
unemployment insurance policy (b, b, , ) subject to the insurance agency's budget con-
straint is equivalent to choosing replacement rates and consumption levels (, , ce
, c
e
)
subject to the aggregate resource constraint. The benefit and transfer levels can be in-
ferred from (10)-(11) as before. Again, we choose the social planner weight ~
 such that
any transfers made across countries net out in expectation: E [T] = 0.
The problem has eight choice variables and five constraints, leaving three degrees of
freedom. These correspond to the three policy instruments ,  and the cross-country
transfer T. The first order condition determining the optimal transfer is derived as:
T = E [y] E [y]
E 
1-
y + y
y
E [y]
-

. (19)
This is the exact same expression as in (15). Each country consumes a constant share of
union output. The Home country receives a transfer when its output is below average,
but has to pay a transfer when output in the Foreign country is below average. The
additional question here is how transfers (and all other resources) are distributed among
the employed and the unemployed.
The answer to this question is contained in the first order condition with respect to
the replacement rate. For the Home country, it reads as follows:
(1 - n) (1 - )
n + (1 - n)

is the elasticity of Home employment with respect to the Home replace-
ment rate, and y

= dy
d

y
is the elasticity of net Home output with respect to the Home
replacement rate. A symmetric condition is obtained for the Foreign country. The left-
hand side I () is the marginal benefit of insurance when raising the replacement rate, at a
fixed quantity of output available to the country. By raising , the unemployed's marginal
utility increases relative to average marginal utility. This is the first term on the left-hand
side of Equation (20). At the same time, a higher  reduces employment (through higher
wages and lower job creation), which shifts the composition of the workforce towards the
unemployed. This means that one marginal worker suffers a utility loss, which is the
"log " term in the left-hand side of Equation (20). It also implies a composition effect
on the insurance budget, captured by the remaining term on the left-hand side. The
right-hand side H () is the marginal cost of raising the replacement rate in terms of net
output lost (output minus vacancy costs. This cost is where the level of transfers T enter.
A high transfer implies that the planner is relying less on domestic production to support
9

domestic consumption, lowering the marginal cost of raising domestic output.
The determination of the optimal replacement rate is graphically depicted in Figure
1, which plots the functions H () and I ().5 We can see that the insurance term I () is
positive and only equals zero at  = 1. Intuitively, holding output constant, it is always
desirable to increase the replacement rate until full insurance is achieved.
The efficiency term H () is first negative and then turns positive, approaching infinity
as   1. Intuitively, when  is too high, there is too little job creation and the amount
of resources available for consumption can be increased by lowering replacement rates,
thereby lowering bargained wages and increasing job creation. In this case y

< 0, and
therefore H () is positive. Conversely, when  is too low, there is too much vacancy
posting and the amount of resources available for consumption can be increased by raising
replacement rates. In this case, H () is negative.
The optimal replacement rate lies at the intersection between the two curves. Employ-
ment is always lower than in the social planner solution where H () = 0. The marginal
benefit of insurance is always positive and so the optimal  is higher than what the Hosios
condition would call for.
What happens to the replacement rate when shocks to a or a hit the economy? We
first keep the ratio y/ (y + T) constant. This is the case in particular when T = 0, as in
the limit   1 of a closed-economy. The left panel of Figure 2 depicts the effects of a
recession caused by a reduction in productivity a.
A reduction in a increases the insurance term I () and scales up the efficiency term
H (). The intuition is as follows. A reduction in productivity reduces employment.
Holding total resources constant, this translates into an increase in unemployment risk
for each worker, raising the social benefit of insurance. I () shifts up for any value of
. At the same time, lower productivity directly reduces net output for any level of
employment. Therefore, the average marginal utility of increasing output towards its
efficient level increases and H () is scaled up for any value of . The figure shows that
the effects of these two forces on the replacement rate work in opposite directions, so that
the change in  is ambiguous. This ambiguity reflects the debate in the existing literature
5Proposition 1 in the appendix proves that the shape of the I and H curves are indeed as depicted.

about the cyclicality of optimal unemployment insurance in closed economies--it is not
clear whether, in a recession, it is more important to keep output from falling or to protect
workers from unemployment risk.
In our supranational insurance scheme, however, a drop in productivity a also triggers
an incoming transfer T. The risk sharing condition (19) prescribes that T is a decreasing
function of y, in order to keep average consumption of the Home country proportional to
union output. The increase in T then affects the optimal replacement rate, and it is this
risk sharing aspect that is novel to the literature on optimal unemployment insurance.
Specifically, the presence of international risk sharing makes the replacement rate more
countercyclical. This can be seen from the optimality condition (20). When a falls, Home's
output will relatively low compared to union output, and T will increase. The right panel
of Figure 2 shows that the optimal replacement rate rises as a response, introducing
a countercyclical element to the optimal policy. When transfers increase, the planner
is relying less on domestic production to support domestic consumption, lowering the
marginal cost of raising domestic output. The efficiency term H () shrinks and the
trade-off between efficiency and insurance shifts towards the latter. The replacement rate
 rises as a result.6
Next, the Home replacement rate is increasing in Foreign productivity a. Foreign
productivity only affects the Home replacement rate because of its effect on Foreign output
y and therefore transfers to the Home country. When the Foreign country experiences
a drop in productivity, it receives a transfer and T falls. The planner is now relying
more on Home output relative to Foreign output, and the trade-off between efficiency
and insurance shifts towards the former. The replacement rate  falls in order to increase
production at Home.
Finally, we can show that when a and a are independent, the optimal Home replace-
ment rate is countercyclical in the limit as   0. When the Home country is small and
its shocks are uncorrelated with the rest of the union, its risk can be completely diversified
6The appendix provides a formal proof.
11
at the supranational level. The appendix shows that in this case, shifts of the H function
due to transfers (right panel of Figure 2) dominate those due to movements in productivity
(left panel). The Home replacement rate unambiguously rises when productivity falls. It
is worth mentioning that even in the case   0, the optimal replacement rate is not one.
This might seem counterintuitive as it would be costless for the union to perfectly insure
all workers in an infinitesimally small country. But this would imply that the country re-
ceives positive transfers in all states of the world, which we have ruled out with condition
(13). The planner weight ~
 shrinks together with  to ensure that this condition holds.
Every country, regardless how small, has to be self-financed in expectation, even as its
idiosyncratic business cycle risk can be better insured.
4 Model for quantitative analysis
The simple model of the previous section illustrates the relevant trade-offs involved in
supranational unemployment insurance. In this section, extend the model along a number
of dimensions and calibrate it to the core and periphery of the Eurozone. We numerically
solve for the Ramsey-optimal policies with and without the possibility of transfers. Our
simulation results of the optimal policies confirm the insights from the simple model.
We extend the simple model in the following dimensions. First, the model is dynamic
with an infinite horizon, where workers transition back and forth between employment and
unemployment. Second, we allow for variable search effort, so that unemployment benefits
affect the labor market not only through wage bargaining but also through their effect on
search effort. Third, we add imperfect substitutability between Home and Foreign goods,
so that movements in the terms of trade can partly insure against country-specific shocks
to production. Fourth, we add price and wage rigidities to help the quantitative fit of
the model, in particular the volatility of unemployment. Finally, we allow for a limited
degree of trade of intertemporal non-contingent bonds, so that even in the absence of
supranational risk sharing mechanisms agents can somewhat smooth business cycle shocks
intertemporally.
4.1 Model setup
Time is discrete at t = 0, 1, 2, .... As before, a unit mass of workers and firms populates
the economy, where   (0, 1) workers live in the Home country and (1 - ) workers
live in the Foreign country. We will only describe the model setup in the Home country.
The structure of the Foreign economy is identical up to potentially different parameter
values. If we need to show variables and parameters of Foreign, they will be indicated by
an asterisk.
4.1.1 Matching
At the beginning of period t, a fraction ut
of workers at Home are unemployed. We
assume that labor is immobile across countries, so that workers can only search for jobs
domestically. The number of total new hires is determined by the number of searching
workers ut
, the search effort et
, and the number of vacancies vt
. Workers and vacancies
12
are matched according to a standard Cobb-Douglas matching function
mt
= m
(et
ut
)µ v1-µ
t
(21)
where m
is a matching efficiency parameter and µ is the elasticity of matches with respect
to unemployment. Defining labor market tightness as t
= vt
/et
ut
, the probability that a
vacancy gets filled, and the probability that a worker putting in one unit of search effort
finds a job, are given by qt
= m
-µ
t
and ft
= qt
t
. Separation occurs at the exogenous
rate s. Unemployed workers who separate have to wait one period before they can start
searching again. Accordingly, the laws of motion for employment and unemployment are
given by:
nt
= (1 - s)nt-1
+ qt
vt
(22)
ut
= 1 - nt-1
. (23)
4.1.2 Workers
A worker can be employed or unemployed. He maximizes expected lifetime utility, defined
recursively as follows:
Wt
= u (cet
) + Et
{(1 - s)Wt+1
+ sUt+1
} (24)
Ut
= u (cut
) + Et
{(1 - ft+1
et+1
)Ut+1
+ ft+1
et+1
Wt+1
- k (et+1
)} . (25)
where Wt
is the utility of an employed worker with consumption cet
and Ut
is the utility of
an unemployed worker with consumption cut
. Unemployed workers have to exert search
effort et+1
at the beginning of the next period to find a job. We assume the following
functional forms:
u (c) =
c1-
1 - 
,   0
k (e) = e
e1+
1 + 
,  > 0
The consumption flow cjt
, j  {e, u} denotes expenditure on a consumption basket. This
basket consists of goods produced in the Home and Foreign countries and is given by:
cjt
= ( (cjt,H
) + (1 - ) (cjt,F
))1/ (26)
Here, cjt,H
is the amount of goods consumed and produced at Home, while cjt,F
is the
amount of goods consumed at Home but produced in Foreign. The parameter   (-, 1)
governs the elasticity of substitution between foreign and domestic goods, which equals
1/ (1 - ), and the parameter  represents the relative valuation of Home goods.7
We abstract from international trade costs so the law of one price holds for both goods.
We take the Home good as the num´
eraire and let pt
be the relative price of Foreign goods.
7In the case of unitary elasticity of substitution ( = 0), the consumption basket is of the Cobb-
Douglas form cjt
= (cjt,H
) (cjt,F
)1-, so that the expenditure share on Home goods is exactly . A
situation where  >  then corresponds to home bias in consumption.
13
Thus, pt
also represents the terms of trade of the Foreign country. Next, we define the
consumer price index (CPI) at Home by Pt
= (cjt,H
+ pt
cjt,F
) /cjt
. Utility maximization
implies that8

Next, we specify workers' budget constraints and the financial assets to which they have
access. We want to capture an incomplete market setting in which workers can neither
obtain perfect insurance of their idiosyncratic unemployment risk nor of country-specific
risk. We opt for a setting in which workers do not have access to individual savings at
all, so that they cannot insure their idiosyncratic unemployment risk. However, both
unemployed and employed workers will own a fixed amount of shares in firms, and firms
are able to access a non-contingent international bond. As will become clear below, this
allows us to introduce limited intertemporal trade while escaping the need to keep track
of the distribution of assets when solving the model.
Employed workers receive a wage payment wt
(in units of Home goods), of which an
amount t
of payroll taxes is deducted. The unemployed receive unemployment insurance
benefits bt
. All workers receive an equal share of profits t
from the firms in their country
of residence. Since firms discount profits at a household rate, holding shares in firms
effectively gives agents a form of savings through firms' intertemporal decisions, but they
cannot save individually and must consume their per period-income, which in real terms
reads as follows:
cet
= (wt
- t
+ t
) /Pt
(29)
cut
= (bt
+ t
) /Pt
. (30)
The only choice variable for workers is the search effort et
when unemployed. Maximiz-
ing the utility of the unemployed with respect to effort leads to the following optimality
condition:
k (et
) = ft
(Wt
- Ut
) . (31)
4.1.3 Firms
We assume that production is divided into a final and an intermediate goods sector,
with the latter being subject to search frictions. Each country produces a distinct final
good from domestic intermediates. Intermediate producers operate under monopolistic
competition and are able to set prices.
More precisely, at Home there is a representative final good producer which purchases
a variety of differentiated intermediate goods, bundles these into a final good and sells
the latter as a price taker. The price of the Home country's final good is the same in
8Having normalized the price of the Home good to one, note that Pt
is Home CPI relative to Home
PPI. It correspondingly holds that P
t
is Foreign CPI expressed relative to goods produced in Home. We
will, hence, express all Foreign variables relative to the price of goods produced in Home.

reads:
yt
(j) = (~

. (34)
Combining the latter with (32) and the zero profit condition, we obtain the producer price
index in the home country and normalize it to one:
1 =

Now, each intermediate producer operates the following technology:
yt
(j) = at
nt
(j) (36)
which is linear in labor, and at
is a productivity shock common to all firms. Employment
is subject to search frictions. Firm j needs to post a number of vacancies vt
(j), each of
which leads to successful matching with a worker with probability qt
. The vacancy filling
rate is taken as given by the firm. Successful matches start production in the next period.
Furthermore, firm j needs to pay its workers a wage wt
(j), and it needs to pay a cost
for each vacancy, which takes the form of a constant quantity v
of domestically produced
goods. Following Arseneau and Chugh (2007), the firm faces a quadratic cost of adjusting
real wages.9For each of its workers, the real cost of changing wages between period t - 1

Rotemberg price adjustment costs that are similar to wage adjustment costs described
above, with p
being the cost parameter. Finally, the firm has to pay a fixed cost F every

that the firm discount factor is a weighted average of the worker discount factors :

Note that in the last three equations we made use of the fact that, in equilibrium, all firms
will chose the same price and allocation; thus, we dropped the index j due to symmetry
and imposed ~
pt
(j) = 1 from Equation (35).

4.1.5 Government
Unlike in the simple model of the previous section, we explicitly spell out national gov-
ernments as well as a supranational unemployment insurance agency, each of which inde-
pendently manages its finances.
The government in the Home country gains revenue exclusively from payroll taxes
gt
. These taxes are used to fund benefits for unemployed workers bgt
as well as govern-
ment expenditure gt
. Government expenditure is spent entirely on domestically produced
goods.10 The government has to balance its budget every period. Its budget constraint
writes
gt
+ ut
bgt
= gt
nt
. (43)
The supranational unemployment insurance agency can likewise administer a compo-
nent of unemployment insurance. This agency also has to balance its budget every period.
It collects payroll taxes xt
and disburses unemployment benefits bxt
in the Home coun-
try, and collect payroll taxes 
xt
and disburses unemployment benefits b
xt
in the Foreign
country. The agency's budget constraint writes
 (1 - nt
) bxt
+ (1 - ) (1 - n
t
) pt
b
t
= nt
xt
+ (1 - ) n

xt
. (44)
Total taxes on employed workers, total benefits received by unemployed workers, and the
net replacement rate are then given by:
t
= gt
+ xt
(45)
bt
= bgt
+ bxt
(46)
t
=
bt
wt

(47)
In our benchmark calibration, the supranational agency is inactive (bxt
= b
xt
= xt
=

xt
= 0) and national governments target constant replacement rates t
= ¯
 and 
t
= ¯
.
Since this situation is close to the current system in place in the Eurozone, we call it the
"status quo".

(50)
The international bond is in zero net supply so that bond market equilibrium prescribes
0 = dt

. (51)
Finally, the exogenous shocks in our model are persistent shocks to productivity and
government spending. The processes for government spending and productivity in the
Home country are as follows:
log at
= a
log at-1
+ (1 - a
) log ¯
a + at
(52)
log gt
= g
log gt-1
+ (1 - g
) log ¯
g + gt
(53)
where all shocks are i.i.d. normally distributed with zero mean. Technology and govern-
ment spending shocks are independent of each other, but we do allow for correlation of
the Home and Foreign technology and government spending shocks, respectively.
We require the autoregressive coefficients to be less than one to rule out permanent
shocks. This choice is not innocuous in its policy implications. The first best allocation
in our model would completely shield domestic consumption from domestic employment
and instead tie it to union output. In the presence of permanent shocks that differentially
affect the long-run level of GDP in each country, this would effectively prescribe perma-
nent transfers from the country with higher per capita income to the one with lower per
capita income, and the Ramsey-optimal policy would then implement this prescription
by permanent fiscal transfers. We do not see much practical relevance in such an extreme
form of risk sharing and therefore focus exclusively on cyclical shocks. Any cross-country
transfers under the Ramsey planner will always fall back to zero in expectation.
4.2 Optimal policy
When we characterize optimal unemployment insurance policies, we define "optimal" to
be maximizing a utilitarian welfare function:
E [~
 (nt
Wt
+ (1 - nt
) Ut
) + (1 - ~
) (n
t
W
t
+ (1 - n
t
) U
t
)] (54)
18
We solve for Ramsey-optimal policies involving the replacement rates t
, 
t
as well as a
transfer policy of the supranational agency, defined as
Tt
= (1 - nt
) bt
- nt
t
. (55)
Unless stated otherwise, we implement transfer policies by setting bxt
= Tt
, b
xt
=
/ (1 - ) Tt
/pt
, and xt
= 
xt
= 0. This is without loss of generality: For any other
set of policies bxt
, bgt
, xt
, gt
, b
xt
, b
gt
, 
xt
, 
gt
, one can define Tt
as above and set b
xt
= Tt
,
b
gt
= bgt
+ bxt
- Tt
, 
xt
= 0, 
gt
= gt
+ xt
etc. and achieve exactly the same allocation, as
the budget constraints of the public sector can be consolidated from a planner perspective.
As in the simple model, we choose the welfare weight on the Home country ~
 to rule
out permanent transfers from one country to another:
E [Tt
] = 0. (56)
We also compute what we call a "no-transfer" Ramsey problem. There, we keep the
planner weight ~
 at the value imposed by condition (56), but now impose Tt
= 0, so that
the Ramsey planner is left with the Home and Foreign replacement rates as instruments.
Comparing the "full" and the "no-transfer" Ramsey solutions will allow us to isolate the
interaction effect of transfers and unemployment insurance policies.
4.3 Calibration
We calibrate the model to the Eurozone, where we identify the Home country with six Eu-
rozone core countries (Austria, Belgium, Germany, Finland, France, Luxemburg, Nether-
lands) and the Foreign country with six periphery countries (Spain, Greece, Ireland, Italy,
Portugal). In what follows, we use the term "country" in the model sense and use the
words "Home"/"Foreign" and "Core"/"Periphery" interchangeably. Our calibration is
summarized in Table 1.
The number of workers in the Home country is set to 60 percent, which corresponds
to the relative size of the labor force in the Core. We set the discount factor  in both
countries to the standard value of 0.99 which yields an annual real interest rate of 4 per
cent. The curvature of consumption  in both countries is set to 1.5 as reported in Smets
and Wouters (2003). The parameter  in both countries is set to 0.744, implying an
elasticity of substitution between Home and Foreign goods of 3.9 matching the European
average of estimates reported in Corbo and Osbat (2013). Given that value, we calculate
values for the home good preferences ,  to match a GDP-weighted average of domestic
expenditure shares of 85 percent as estimated in Balta and Delgado (2009), and ensuring
that the relative price of foreign goods in steady state equals p = 1. The inverse elasticities
of search effort ,  are chosen to match the estimate in Meyer (1990) of an elasticity
of unemployment duration with respect to the level of benefits of 0.9. The effort scaling
parameters e
, 
e

observed by Hagedorn and Manovskii (2008), workers need to capture a high share of
the match surplus for a search model to reproduce the volatility of unemployment in the

The cost coefficient of price adjustment p

intermediate good producers of 30 percent and a Phillips curve that has the same slope
coefficient on marginal cost as a corresponding Phillips curve with price rigidities ´
a la
Calvo with an average price duration of two quarters. This value is lower than what
is common in the literature; stronger price rigidities would imply that unemployment
rises after positive technology shocks because of the associated fall in markups. This is a
common problem in New-Keynesian models with search frictions (see for example Gertler,
Sala, and Trigari, 2008). We do, however, allow for substantial wage rigidity and set the
wage adjustment costs w

11Many ways have been proposed to address the fact that the standard search and matching model
fails, for a standard calibration, to account for the cyclical properties of unemployment and vacancies,
the so called "Shimer puzzle" (Shimer, 2005). Contributing to this debate is beyond the scope of our
paper.
12Doing so avoids the problem of ending up with a negative replacement rate in the Ramsey solution.
Since we are setting a high bargaining power for workers, the Ramsey planner tends to undo this bar-
gaining power with a lower replacement rate. Without the fixed cost F, it is possible to set a negative
replacement rate (i.e. a tax on unemployment instead of an insurance) because unemployed workers can
still consume a positive amount of profits.

in Home and Foreign are chosen to match the HP-filtered standard deviation of real
GDP in the Core and the Periphery. The correlation of the two shocks is chosen to
match the correlation between filtered unemployment rates in the Core and Periphery
of 51 percent. The resulting correlation is approximately 0.8, which implies that the
synchronization of the business cycle across the two countries is quite high. The steady-
state levels of government spending ¯

The Eurozone-specific moments we target are summarized in Table 2. The Periphery
contributes about 40 percent of the EZ-12 labor force, but only about 35 percent of
real GDP. It also has a higher volatility of GDP and unemployment. Nevertheless, our
calibration features a higher degree of wage rigidity in the core than in the periphery. This
is because the relative standard deviation of unemployment to output is actually higher
in the core, so that for a shock of a given size unemployment has to rise more in the core,
which is achieved by setting a higher degree of wage rigidity. Finally, the periphery has a
higher average unemployment rate, but a less generous unemployment insurance system
as measured by net replacement rates, which in our calibration translates into a higher
calibrated value for the separation rate.
5 Results
We now present the results from our numerical simulations. We first confirm that our
calibration of the status quo produces second moments that are close to the data. We then
compute Ramsey-optimal unemployment insurance policies, and also calculate optimal
policy without transfers, i.e. imposing that Tt
= 0 holds at all times. Even without
transfers, we find that optimal replacement rates are countercyclical in the model. With
regards to transfers, we confirm our predictions from the simple model: Replacement
rates rise when a country receives a transfer, so the generosity of unemployment insurance
becomes more countercyclical in the presence of transfers. Nevertheless, the impact of
transfers on output and unemployment rates is relatively minor, indicating that transfers
can be implemented through the unemployment insurance system without causing large
distortions in labor markets. We then explore how our results differ under alternative
scenarios.
5.1 Status quo
Table 3 summarizes key second moments of our calibrated model. The standard devia-
tions of real GDP and unemployment in each country are targeted by the calibration. The
standard deviation of consumption is higher than in the data. This is an outcome of the
fact that our model does not include capital and has a sizable share of output absorbed

by a relatively stable government expenditure process. We see this outcome as an accept-
able cost of simplification, but the gains from stabilization might therefore be somewhat
overstated. The standard deviation of wages, by contrast, is reasonable. The bottom row
also reports statistics on the Home trade balance as a percentage of domestic GDP. The
standard deviation is of a realistic magnitude. This implies that even in the absence of
cross-country fiscal transfers, households are able to smooth international consumption
risk to some extent through savings in the bond market.
The contemporaneous correlations with GDP are close to the data, with the excep-
tion of real wages. Our HP-filtered wage series display very little correlation with filtered
output. As for the cross-correlations across countries, the cross-correlation of unemploy-
ment is targeted by the calibration, and that of output and wages is within reasonable
range. But the correlation of real consumption across countries is very close to one. Our
model therefore suffers from the Backus, Kehoe, and Kydland (1992) consumption cor-
relation puzzle, overstating the amount of international risk sharing present in the data.
Addressing the puzzle will likely strengthen our results.
5.2 Ramsey policy
We now compute Ramsey-optimal policies with and without transfers and confirm our
predictions from the simple model about the cyclicality of policy instruments. The results
are summarized in Table 4.
The left half of the table documents the standard deviations of optimal replacement
rates and transfers and their correlation with output. The standard deviations of re-
placement rates are relatively large, around three percentage points. Remarkably, all

replacement rates are countercyclical. Transfers to the Foreign country as a percentage
of Foreign GDP are also large and countercyclical. In the Foreign country, replacement
rates are more volatile and more negatively correlated when the planner has access to
transfers than without transfers (Tt
= 0 imposed). However, in the Home country the
opposite pattern can be observed.
However, looking at correlation coefficients does not say much about the behavior
of policy because it does not say by how much replacement rates change in response to
economic conditions. Moreover, GDP across the two countries is highly correlated, and so
correlation coefficients mask differences in policy reactions to shocks originating at Home
and in Foreign.
For these reasons, our preferred measures of the cyclicality of optimal policy are the
coefficients from bivariate regressions of replacement rates and transfers to Home and
Foreign GDP. These are shown in the right half of Table 4, and they clearly confirm our
predictions from the simple model. On average, when Home GDP rises by one percent,
replacement rates fall by 1.37 percentage points in the Home country with transfers.
Without transfers, they only fall by 1.08 percentage points. Foreign replacement rates rise
by 0.83 percentage points in the presence of transfers, compared to only 0.15 percentage
points without transfers. The Foreign country also receives, on average, a transfer of
0.69 percent of its GDP when GDP at Home rises by one percent. The same patterns
appear in response to changes in Foreign GDP: Replacement rates are countercyclical
with respect to domestic GDP and procyclical with respect to GDP abroad, and this
cyclicality becomes stronger in the presence of transfers.
To further illustrate these results, we compare impulse response functions to a negative
productivity shock in the periphery in Figure 3 (the patterns are qualitatively similar for a
shock in the core). Specifically, we contrast the optimal Ramsey planner response with the
no-transfer Ramsey solution and the status quo policy (no transfers, constant replacement
rates). The upper panel of the figure depicts the four direct policy instruments: Home and
Foreign benefits bt

and Home and Foreign payroll taxes t

. These can be mapped
into the replacement rates and transfer policies, but we want to highlight how variations
in these policy variables are implemented by the planner. After a negative productivity

shock in the periphery, the Ramsey planner (solid red line) implements a transfer from
the core to the periphery. It does so by increasing unemployment benefits in the periphery
and at the same time cutting payroll taxes, and effecting the opposite pattern in the core.
Benefits drop below their initial level after six quarters in order to make the increase
in unemployment dissipate more quickly, while taxes stay low for a long time. A large
transfer finds its way to the economy mainly by a reduction in payroll taxes which affect
most of the population, rather than benefits which only affect only the relatively few
unemployed workers. When the planner does not have access to transfers (blue dashed
line), the behavior of the instruments is markedly different. In the core, benefits and
taxes stay mostly flat after the shock. The level of benefits still rises in the periphery, but
this time the increase in benefits has to be financed by higher taxes. In the status quo
calibration with constant replacement rates, taxes also increase even though the level of
benefits barely moves. This is because unemployment increases markedly and persistently,
and more recipients of benefits and fewer payroll contributors necessitate a higher level
of contributions to balance the national unemployment insurance budget.
The lower panel of the figure depicts the aggregate outcomes under the different poli-
cies. The responses of GDP and unemployment in the core are barely affected, but there
are marked differences in the periphery where the shock hits. The Ramsey planner man-
ages to stabilize GDP and unemployment with respect to the status quo policy. However,
the response of these variables is nearly identical whether the planner can make use of
cross-country transfers or not. This result obtains despite the fact that the transfer is
sizable--0.28 percent of Foreign GDP at its peak--and underscores our prediction that
transfers can be channeled through the unemployment insurance system without distort-
ing labor market outcomes.
Of course, transfers have a stabilizing function on consumption. Compared to the sta-
tus quo, the planner without access to transfers already manages to stabilize consumption
in both countries by reducing the size of unemployment fluctuations. Still, consumption
drops by more in the periphery where the shock originates. Transfers even out the burden
of reducing consumption, raising it in the periphery and reducing it in the core. Finally,
the figure also depicts the response of the core trade balance. It is positive under all
three policies, reflecting the fact that the periphery runs a current account deficit to pri-
vately smooth out the drop in consumption. It does so by taking up debt. However,
non-contingent debt is not the same as full risk sharing and the planner can improve on
this allocation. The transfer of course results in an even larger trade balance.
How important are the stabilization gains? We measure stabilization in terms of the
reduction in the variances of consumption and unemployment , documented in Table 5.
Column (1) shows the standard deviations of unfiltered (log) consumption and unemploy-
ment in both countries at the status quo policy. Column (2) shows the same statistics at
the Ramsey policy without transfers. The Ramsey planner can achieve a reduction of at
least 20 percent in the volatility of consumption and at least 45 percent in the volatility of
unemployment by adjusting national replacement rates alone. In Column (3), the planner
can additionally pool the unemployment insurance systems at the supranational level. In
that case, it achieves additional stabilization in the periphery: unemployment volatility
drops three percent, and consumption volatility drops 26 percent. In the core however,
the volatility of unemployment and consumption increase by 4 percent and 24 percent,
respectively, although they remain lower than under the status quo.

Why is the planner not able to stabilize consumption in both countries? The answer is
that business cycles in the model are highly correlated, owing to the calibration. There is
relatively little country-specific risk that can be reduced through diversification. Instead,
the planner is implementing transfers to shift risk from the periphery to the relatively
more stable core. As a result, the standard deviations of consumption in the core and
the periphery move closer to each other. The policy distributes risk more evenly across
the two countries, but it is not a Pareto-improvement over the no-transfer policy: The
core would be better off without transfers. We conjecture that a Pareto improvement
could be achieved by a perpetual steady-state payment from the periphery to the core as
a compensation for the added risk. But this is ruled out by our requirement that transfers
be zero in expectation. We think that this point has not been appreciated in the existing
literature: A fiscal risk sharing mechanism in the Eurozone is likely to be detrimental
to the more stable economies of the core even when permanent transfers are ruled out
by design, simply because risk is perpetually shifted from more volatile to more stable
countries. 13
5.3 Alternative scenarios
How sensitive are our results to the calibration? Our main qualitative result--transfers
make optimal unemployment insurance more countercyclical--hold up for any reasonable
parametrization of the model, but the quantitative results are sensitive to several param-
eters. Table 6 computes the cyclicalities of optimal policy under a variety of alternative
assumptions on the parameters.
Column (1) repeats the baseline calibration regression coefficients from Table 4. In
Column (2), the Home population share is increased to  = 0.8. This scenario implies that
the size of the Foreign country is roughly that of Spain within the Eurozone. Compared to
the baseline, the Home replacement rate becomes less countercyclical, Foreign replacement
rates more countercyclical, and Foreign transfers become larger. These results are fully
in line with the predictions from our simplified model: A smaller country can be better
insured by the union, and the countercylical effect of risk sharing on replacement rates
becomes stronger.
13Our calibration to only two regions might understate the amount of diversifiable business cycle risk.
At the single country level, the component of risk that is diversifiable across the union is certainly
larger, so that it might be possible to reduce consumption volatility in every country with appropriate
risk-sharing policies.

Regression coefficients are obtained from regressing each row variable simultaneously on the log of Home
and Foreign real GDP.
In Column (3), the variance of Foreign productivity shocks is set to A
= 0, so that
almost all output fluctuations come from shocks originating in the Home country. This
scenario isolates the policy reaction to country-specific shocks, which arere not clearly
visible in the baseline because of the high correlation of shocks. The cyclicalities of
replacement rates and transfers increase everywhere.
In Column (4), the steady-state unemployment rate in the Foreign country is ¯
u re-
duced to the value to that in the Home country ¯
u. This scenario can be thought of as the
implementation of labor market reforms in the Eurozone periphery that reduce structural
unemployment. As a result, replacement rates become more countercyclical in the Home
country and less countercyclical in the Foreign country, while the magnitude of transfers
is roughly unchanged. Intuitively, when ¯
u falls, Foreign GDP becomes less volatile and
its share in total GDP rises, meaning that the core will insure less risk of the periphery.
Replacement rates become less countercyclical in the less well-insured Foreign country,
while the opposite happens in the Home country.14
In Column (5), the elasticity of substitution between Home and Foreign goods is set
close to unity. This scenario puts the economy close to the case studied in Cole and
Obstfeld (1991) where movements in the terms of trade achieve perfect risk sharing even
under financial autarky. In line with their finding, the size of optimal transfers is now
close to zero. The replacement rates become more procyclical as a result.
Most other parameters of the model have little impact on the quantitative results.
For example, the choice of the bargaining weight  is crucial to match the volatility of
unemployment in the model, but does not affect optimal policy. In Column (6), we set
 = µ so as to bring the model closer to the Hosios (1990) condition. The changes to the
coefficients in the table are relatively small and there is no clear pattern in the change of
cyclicality. Similar results obtain when varying other parameters.
Likewise, the degree of nominal price rigidities has little impact on the optimal policy.
Figure 4 plots the bivariate regression coefficients on the optimal policy instruments as a
function of the Rotemberg price rigidity parameter p
. The dotted line marks the baseline
value of p
= 6.601. This is at the lower end of values used in the literature, as discussed
above. But a lower or higher value for p
does little change to the cyclicality of the Home

replacement rate. It has some effect on the response of the Foreign replacement rate to
changes in Home GDP (red lines in the middle panel of the figure): Larger price rigidities
induce the Foreign replacement rate rise less, on average, when Home GDP rises. Still,
the qualitative conclusion of more countercyclical replacement rates in the presence of
transfers is unaffected by the size of price rigidities. 15 What's more surprising is that
even the transfer policy is little changed as p
varies. The inefficiencies caused by the
presence of a currency union and nominal rigidities emphasized by Farhi and Werning
(2012) seem to be quantitatively unimportant compared with the other financial market
imperfections in the model.
6 The difference between debt and insurance
In writing this paper, we frequently encountered the argument that a fiscal risk sharing
mechanism without permanent transfers would be no different from using government
debt to run countercyclical deficits. Here, we show that this argument does not hold. Our
fiscal risk sharing mechanism works like a fairly priced insurance policy: Even though on
average, the premia and expected payments net out to zero, one is still better better off
buying the insurance than taking out a bank loan in the event of damage.
We modify our quantitative model to introduce national government debt. All debt is
denominated in nominal terms in the common currency of the two countries. The budget
constraint (43) of the Home government is modified as follows:

15This finding is in line with Kekre (2016) who finds that optimal unemployment insurance is affected
by nominal rigidities and the ensuing demand externalities only when the zero lower bound on interest
rates is binding.

as the private sector. If this were not the case, the primary use of government would be
to replace frictional private borrowing with frictionless public borrowing. The Foreign
government similarly can similarly issue debt d

. The clearing condition (51) in the bond
market is modified to read:
0 =  (dt

We then compute the Ramsey-optimal policies where the planner does not have access
to cross-country transfers Tt
but can instead optimally choose the national government
debt levels dgt
and d
gt
. As before, the planner can also choose the national replacement
rates t
, 
t
. From a welfare perspective, the value of the Ramsey problem with debt is
bounded from above by that with transfers, and from below by the value of that with
nationally balanced budgets.
It turns out that the planner is not able to distribute risk very effectively with debt.
This can be seen immediately from Column (4) in Table 5: The values for the volatility
of consumption in particular are very close to those without transfers (Column 2).
In Figure 5, we plot impulse responses after a negative country-specific productivity
shock in the periphery, comparing the full Ramsey solution, the solution with debt, and
the solution with nationally balanced budgets (labeled "no transfers"). It is immediately
clear that the solution with debt is very close to the solution with balanced budgets. The
drop in consumption is minimally shifted from Foreign to Home, which is reflected in a
slightly higher trade balance. It is not advantageous for the planner to move resources
from Home to Foreign with debt, and the reason is of course that debt has to be repaid.
The rightmost graph in Figure 5, labeled "Transfer (F)", depicts the budget deficit of the
Foreign government in the solution with debt. This is the closest correspondence to the
supranational transfers in the full Ramsey solution, which are also plotted. The planner
does run a budget deficit in the periphery after the shock, but the optimal size of the
deficit is only about 0.08 percent of GDP at the peak, since it will have to be repaid
eventually (in the graph, starting four years after the shock). By contrast, when the
planner has access to transfers the stabilization gains are much larger, despite the fact
that transfers are temporary and equal zero in expectation. With debt, any "transfer" has
to be repaid with certainty at some point in the future; with fiscal risk sharing, transfers
only have to average out over time.

7 Conclusions
In this paper, we have used an international business cycle model with frictional labor
markets and incomplete financial markets to discuss optimal unemployment insurance
policy operating across multiple countries. Theoretically, the possibility to set different
policies across countries augments the classic policy trade-off between efficient employ-
ment and insurance of unemployment risk with a concern for international risk-sharing.
We have shown that cross-country insurance through the unemployment insurance system
can in principle be achieved without affecting unemployment levels; and that the desir-
ability of international risk sharing introduces a countercyclical element to the optimal
unemployment insurance policy.
Calibrated to Eurozone core and periphery, our two-country model implied that opti-
mal replacement rates are countercyclical even from a national perspective without trans-
fers. Adding transfers markedly increased this countercyclicality, and the optimal trans-
fers were found to be sizeable (about 0.7 percent of GDP following a one percentage point
decrease in GDP). However, we also found that, due to the high correlation of business
cycles across the Eurozone, there is very limited scope to diversify risk. Instead, the opti-
mal planner policy mainly implied a shift of consumption risk from the periphery to the
core in order to distribute it more evenly.
There is one important direction in which our findings could be extended in further
research. The optimal policy we compute here is one in which the planner has perfect
knowledge of the structure of the economy. One of the most difficult issues in implementing
a policy such as the one in this paper is that the structural rate of unemployment can
only be reliably estimated in hindsight, if at all. It would be useful to see whether
simple policy rules that are more easily implementable under imperfect information can
reasonably approximate the optimal policy.
Appendix: Propositions for Section 1
The optimal replacement rate in the absence of private risk sharing satisfies Equation (19)
in the main text:

n + (1 - n) 
- n

n + (1 - n) 
=:I()

n
=:H()
where x = y/ (y + T) is the income to consumption ratio of the Home country. Here, we
prove the properties of the optimal policy as discussed in the text. Throughout, we make
the following assumption:
Assumption 1. I is strictly concave, H and Hy are strictly convex in  given x.
We numerically verified for a wide range of parameters. The limit behavior of the
functions at the corners is easy to prove and together with our assumption determines
the shape of the curves in the main text.

Proof. We start with the insurance term I (). At the limit when   0, we have w  0

The remaining term of I () must therefore go to zero. Indeed,

Proposition 2. The optimal replacement rate is unique and strictly between exp µ

and one.

Proof. Since f () = H () - I () is continuous on [0, 1] and a strictly concave by our
assumption, it crosses zero at most twice. But f (0) > 0 and lim
- , so there is a
unique interior solution  to f () = 0. Since I (0) > I (1) = 0 and I is strictly concave,
I () > 0  (0, 1) and the optimum has H () > 0. Since H is a strictly convex
function, H (0) = 0 and lim1
H () = + and , H (0
) = 0 for exactly one 0
 (0, 1)
and  > 0
. Finally, H exp µ
1-µ
1-

= 0.
Proposition 3. The optimal replacement rate is strictly decreasing in x.
Proof. Taking the total derivative of the optimality condition with respect to x, we have

.
Clearly, dI/dx = 0 and at the optimal , we have dH/dx = H () /x > 0. Furthermore,
we know that I (0) > H (0) and I () = H () for exactly one value of , so it must be
the case that dH/d > dI/d at the optimal . Therefore d/dx < 0.
This result shows in particular that the replacement rate is increasing in foreign pro-
ductivity a , since an increase in a raises y and therefore decreases x.
Finally, we are going to establish countercyclicality of  in the limit case when Home
country becomes very small, and when a and a are independent.
Proposition 4. In the limit as   0, the optimal replacement rate is unique, strictly
below one, and strictly decreasing in a.
Proof. As   0, the risk sharing condition (19) becomes
x = E [y]
E [y]

.
The optimal choice of  when x is chosen optimally can now be described as
I () = ~
H ()
where ~
H () = - y

By our assumption, ~
H () is a strictly convex function. The value of ~
H at zero is
~
H (0) = H (0) E [y]
E [y]

y
= H (0) · 0 = 0.
For the limit at one, we note

since w  a as   1. Therefore, the optimal  when y/c is chosen optimally has the same
properties that we used before holding x constant. In particular, the optimal replacement
rate is unique and strictly below one. Also, we have d ~
H/d > dI/d at the optimal  as
in Proposition (3). Taking the total derivative again, we have
d
da

I
a
-  ~
H

where the denominator of the fraction is negative, so d/da has the same sign as I

The derivatives of I and ~
H with respect to productivity a are:

Therefore d/da < 0.
The last two propositions combined establish the final result of Section 3. A decline
in a raises , and at the same time output y falls. An increase in a also raises , and the
lower replacement rate causes y to fall. Therefore, the replacement rate is countercyclical
conditional on either productivity. Independence of the productivities then implies that
it is also countercyclical overall.
