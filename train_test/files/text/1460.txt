ABSTRACT
Background: Estimates of obesity-associated deaths in the United
States for 1991 were published by Allison et al (JAMA 1999;282:
1530­8) and subsequently for 2000 by Mokdad et al (JAMA 2004;
291:1238­45). Flegal et al (JAMA 2005;293:1861­7) then published
lower estimates of obesity-associated deaths for 2000. All 3 studies
incorporated data from the first National Health and Nutrition Exam-
ination Survey (NHANES I).
Objective: The objective was to clarify the effects of methodologic
differences between the 3 studies in estimates of obesity-associated
deaths in the US population by using NHANES I hazard ratios.
Design: The earlier reports used imputed smoking data for much of
the NHANES I sample rather than the available reported data and
applied a method of calculating attributable fractions that did not
adjust for the effects of age, sex, and smoking on mortality in the
target US population and did not account for effect modification
by age. The effects of these and other methodologic factors were
examined.
Results: The NHANES I hazard ratios in the earlier reports were
too low, probably because of the imputed smoking data. The low
hazard ratios obscured the magnitude and direction of the bias
arising from the incompletely adjusted attributable fraction method.
When corrected hazard ratios were used, the incompletely adjusted
attributable fraction method overestimated obesity-associated mor-
tality in the target population by .100,000 deaths.
Conclusion: Methodologic sources of bias in the reports by
Allison et al and Mokdad et al include the assessment of smoking
status in NHANES I and the method of calculating attributable
fractions. Am J Clin Nutr 2010;91:519­27.
INTRODUCTION
Several different estimates of obesity-associated deaths in the
United States have been published (1­3). Allison et al (1) esti-
mated deaths associated with overweight and obesity for the year
1991; Mokdad et al (2) updated the estimates to the year 2000.
Flegal et al (3) also estimated obesity-associated deaths for the
year 2000 with a different method of estimation and for the most
part different data sources. All 3 studies incorporated the first
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES I)
as one of their data sources. After the article by Flegal et al (3)
was published, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC) changed its estimate of obesity-associated deaths, writing
that "CDC will state, `The latest study based on a nationally
representative sample of U.S. adults estimates that about 112,000
deaths are associated with obesity each year in the United
States.'." (4).
Estimates in the 2 earlier reports (1, 2) were considerably
higher than those by Flegal et al (3). To clarify the sources of
these differences, we first briefly reviewed the methods and
results of the aforementioned publications (1­3). We then
compared estimates of obesity-associated deaths for the US
population in 1991 and 2000 using hazard ratios derived from the
NHANES I data with various approaches to explain the differ-
ences and to show the effects of several sources of bias.
METHODS
Methods and results reported by the 3 studies
Comparative information about the 3 studies is summarized in
Table 1. The report by Allison et al (1) represented an important
advance in methodology, combining hazard ratios from epide-
miologic cohorts with national obesity prevalence estimates and
vital statistics data to make estimates for the US population.
Allison et al (1) derived hazard ratios from 6 different epide-
miologic cohorts, including NHANES I. For each derivation
cohort, hazard ratios, adjusted for age, sex, and smoking, were
calculated for 9 levels of body mass index (BMI; in kg/m2), with
a BMI of 23 to ,25 as the reference category. Overweight was
defined as a BMI of 25 to ,30 and obesity as a BMI ! 30. The
hazard ratios from each cohort were combined with BMI
prevalence estimates from NHANES III (1988­1994) and the
total number of deaths in the United States in 1991 to estimate
overweight and obesity-attributable deaths for the target pop-

ulation (the US population) in 1991. The 6 estimates were
averaged to arrive at a final number (Figure 1). The average
value for obesity and overweight-associated deaths combined
was 280,184. For obesity-associated deaths alone, the average
was 237,199.
To update these results to the year 2000, Mokdad et al (2) used
the same derivation cohorts, hazard ratios, and attributable
fraction method used by Allison et al (1) but used the prevalence
of BMI levels from NHANES 1999­2000 and the number of
deaths in the United States in 2000. After correcting some cal-
culation errors (5), Mokdad et al estimated 414,123 deaths in
2000 associated with overweight and obesity combined--an
increase of 47% compared with the estimate of Allison et al (1)
for 1991. This increase was partly due to the 12% increase in the
absolute number of deaths between 1991 and 2000 (6) and partly
due to the 33% increase in the prevalence of obesity (7). The age-
adjusted death rate in the United States fell from 925.5/100,000 in
1991 to 872.0/100,000 in 2000, but the total number of US deaths
among adults increased due to the increased size of the pop-
ulation (6). Changes in other risk factors such as smoking do not
enter into the calculations.
Mokdad et al (2) then averaged their initial estimate for the year
2000withtheAllisonetal(1)estimatefor1991.Thisreducedtheir
estimate of overweight and obesity-associated deaths from
414,123 to 347,154, which then was rounded upward to 350,000.
Mokdad et al (2) next added 15,000 more deaths to account for
additional deaths due to poor diet and physical inactivity that were
independent of overweight and obesity, to arrive at a final value of
365,000 for diet- and inactivity-associated deaths, of which
350,000 were overweight- and obesity-associated deaths.
Flegal et al (3) used a different reference category of BMI 18.5
to ,25 and a different method of estimating attributable fractions
(described in more detail below). They estimated hazard ratios
adjusted for age, sex, smoking, race, and alcohol consumption
based on the combined NHANES I, II, and III mortality follow-
up data and applied hazard ratios to data for the US population in
2000. Flegal et al (3) estimated that 112,000 obesity-associated
deaths occurred in the US target population in 2000.
NHANES I smoking data
In NHANES I, there were 2 initial questions on cigarette
smoking. By design, '50% of the NHANES I sample (the
"detailed sample") received a more detailed examination that
included the smoking questions, whereas the other subsample
(the "nutrition sample") was not asked smoking questions at
baseline and thus had missing information about smoking at
baseline (8, 9).
The responses to the baseline smoking questions in the 2 sub-
samples are shown in Table 2. If the answer to the first question

was negative, further smoking-behavior questions were not asked,
so that never-smokers in the detailed sample did not answer the
second question ("Do you smoke cigarettes now?"). More than
50% of the survey participants (7494 of 14,407) were in the
nutrition sample that was not asked the smoking questions. At
the first follow-up in 1982­1984, retrospective smoking in-
formation was collected, mostly from participants themselves
(10). This retrospective information has been validated and used
in numerous analyses to fill in most of the missing smoking data
and provide a more complete smoking data set without statis-
tical imputation (10­15). Flegal et al (3) used the complete
reported smoking data, including both the baseline and retro-
spective data.
Allison et al (1) statistically imputed the smoking status for the
large number of NHANES I participants who had missing
smoking data. The smoking data reported at baseline included
4318 "nonsmokers" (2822 never-smokers and 1496 former
smokers), but the report by Allison et al (1) included only 1496
nonsmokers, so it is not clear whether Allison et al (1) perhaps
also imputed smoking data for the 2822 never-smokers and for
the 7502 participants who did not have smoking data reported at
baseline.
Attributable fraction calculations
Partially adjusted method
The 2 earlier reports (1, 2) used a computing formula to es-
timate the attributable fraction (AF) of deaths associated with
obesity:
AF ¼ PðEi
Þ 3 ðRi
2 1Þ

½1 þ RPðEi
Þ 3 ðRi
2 1Þ ð1Þ
where P(Ei
) is the prevalence of BMI exposure level i, and Ri
is
the unadjusted hazard ratio (relative risk) of mortality associated
with exposure level i. The formula used by Allison et al (1) is
algebraically identical to this formula.
Allison et al (1) used hazard ratios (relative risks) that were
adjusted for age, sex, and smoking but used the attributable
fraction formula given above, which is only appropriate for
unadjusted relative risks. The use of adjusted, rather than un-
adjusted, relative risks in this formula is known to lead to bias in
the attributable fraction estimates (16, 17). We have referred to
this approach as the "partially adjusted" method (18), because it
only partially adjusts for confounding factors (eg, age, sex, and
smoking). Although the hazard ratios in the derivation cohorts are
adjusted for these confounding factors, the attributable fraction
estimates are not adjusted for the effect of those same factors on

mortality in the target population. In addition, this approach of
Allison et al (1) and Mokdad et al (2) does not allow for effect
modification by age (18, 19). Both earlier reports (1, 2) used the
partially adjusted method.
Fully adjusted method
A complete adjustment for confounding factors takes into
account the effect of the confounding factors themselves on
mortality in the target population as well as on relative risks for
BMI in the derivation cohort. Flegal et al (3) used a method to
estimate attributable fractions that adjusts for confounding in the
target population and allows for effect modification by age (3, 20,
21). For convenience, we will refer to this method here as the
"fully adjusted" method. In this approach, the association of BMI
with mortality is modeled by using Cox proportional hazard
models within separate age groups to adjust for age and allows for
the possibility of effect modification by age. The hazard ratios
from the Cox model are then applied to the distribution of the
model covariates in the general (target) population. The hazard
ratios are used to calculate an estimated risk rc
for each in-
dividual with a given set of covariates c in the target population
based on the values of all the covariates for that individual, not
just BMI.
A counterfactual risk rc
* was also calculated for each in-
dividual from the same coefficients, setting BMI equal to the
reference category and keeping all other covariates the same for
that individual. This is a hypothetical estimate of an individual's
mortality risk if the individual's BMI had been moved to the
reference BMI category, but all of the individual's other co-
variates had remained the same. All individuals with identical
covariates c will have identical values of rc
and rc
*; the preva-
lence of that combination of covariates is pc
.
The mortality rate for a given age group is I
P
rc
pc
, where I is
the mortality rate for individuals who are at the reference levels
of BMI and all other covariates, and the sum is over all risk
factor combinations. The hypothetical counterfactual mortality
rate from moving all participants to the reference weight cate-
gory is I
P
rc
*pc
. Because the factor I cancels out, the attrib-
utable fraction depends only on the hazard ratios and
prevalences of the covariate categories and can be calculated as
follows:
AF ¼ ðR 2 RÃÞ=R ð2Þ
where R =
P
rc
pc
and R* =
P
rc
*pc.
This approach accounts for
confounding of the BMI-mortality hazard ratios in the derivation
cohort by all covariates in the model and for the independent
effect of the covariates on mortality in the target population (21).
Contrary to what has been stated elsewhere (22, p 46), the article
by Flegal et al (3) did not use the weighted sum method.
Statistical analyses
Analyses were conducted with PC-SAS (version 9.1; SAS
Institute, Cary, NC) and SUDAAN (version 9.03. Research
Triangle Institute, Research Triangle Park, NC). All analyses
used sample weights. We calculated hazard ratios (relative risks)
for BMI categories from the NHANES I data using Cox pro-
portional hazards models with adjustment for age, sex, and
smoking status. We used the data set without exclusions, because,
as we showed elsewhere (20), the attributable fractions for BMI
categories did not show large or systematic changes after si-
multaneous exclusion of ever smokers, participants with a history
of cancer or cardiovascular disease, and persons who died early in
the follow-up period or were measured at older ages. We first
calculated excess deaths from these hazard ratios by using the
partially adjusted method used in the earlier reports (1, 2). We
then calculated excess deaths using the approach described by
Flegal et al (3), first with the same confounding factors and
reference category as used by Allison et al (1) and then with
additional confounders and a different reference category.
RESULTS
We calculated hazard ratios from NHANES I for the same BMI
categories as used by Allison et al (1), adjusted for age, sex, and
smoking, first with only the original baseline reported smoking
data (Table 3) and then with the complete reported smoking
data, including both baseline and retrospective information. The
published hazard ratios from Allison et al (1) for NHANES I are
also shown in Table 3. At higher BMI levels, the published
hazard ratios (1) for the full sample appear too low and do not
agree with the hazard ratios calculated with the reported
smoking data. The differences between the hazard ratios in-
dicate that the NHANES I data set used by Allison et al (1) is
not the same as the NHANES I data set used by Flegal et al (3).
The data set used by Allison et al (1) included both reported and
imputed smoking data, and the main difference is probably due
to some problem in the statistical imputation of smoking data for
much of the sample by Allison et al (1). The report by Mokdad
et al (2) used the hazard ratio estimates published by Allison
et al (1) and thus was also affected by these differences. We also
included in Table 3 the correct hazard ratios for participants who
reported at baseline that they had never smoked as well as the
published hazard ratios from Allison et al (1) for "nonsmokers."
These 2 sets of hazard ratios are similar to each other and both
agree well with the correct hazard ratios for the full sample,
which further indicates that the problems seem to lie with the
published hazard ratios for the full sample from Allison et al (1).
Using the partially adjusted method, we calculated obesity-
associated deaths for the target population aged !25 y in 1991
with the NHANES I hazard ratios calculated with the complete
smoking data. The resulting estimate of 314,000 obesity-associated
deaths was almost 70% higher than the published estimate by
Allison et al (1) of 185,000 obesity-associated deaths for the
same target population based on NHANES I hazard ratios. Thus,
when the partially adjusted method was used, the low NHANES
I hazard ratios used in the earlier reports (1, 2) resulted in
considerably lower estimates of obesity-associated deaths in the
target population than if the correct hazard ratios had been used.
Comparisons of estimates of obesity-associated deaths in 2000
are shown in Figure 2. The 2 estimates of obesity-associated
deaths for 2000 from NHANES I hazard ratios from the partially
adjusted method, using the low hazard ratios and then the cor-
rected hazard ratios calculated with the complete smoking data,
are shown. Using the low hazard ratios produced an estimate of
289,000. When the corrected hazard ratios with both baseline
and retrospective smoking data were used, however, the partially
adjusted method led to an estimate of 472,000, .60% or
183,000 deaths higher.

We next compared the estimates from the partially adjusted
method with estimates from the fully adjusted method when the
identical data set was used as the derivation cohort for both
estimates. This allows for a direct comparison between the 2
methods with other sources of differences held constant. Ap-
plying the fully adjusted method used by Flegal et al (3) with the
same adjustment factors and the same reference category as used
in the earlier reports (1, 2) resulted in an estimate of 363,000
deaths. The partially adjusted estimate for the target population in
2000 of 472,000 was .100,000 deaths higher than the fully
adjusted estimate of 363,000. Thus, the partially adjusted
method led to a large overestimate of obesity-associated deaths
in the target population relative to the fully adjusted method.
The incorrect hazard ratios obscured the magnitude, and even
the direction, of the bias due to the use of the partially adjusted
method. The bias arises both from incomplete adjustment for
confounding factors and from failure to allow for effect modi-
fication by age.
The effects of other less influential methodologic differences
between the Flegal et al report (3) and the 2 previous reports (1, 2)
are also shown in Figure 2. Changing the reference category to
BMI 18.5 to ,25 decreased the estimate for 2000 by 36,000
deaths to 328,000. Further adjustment for race and alcohol
consumption decreased the estimate for obesity-associated
deaths to 299,000. This is the previously published estimate
based on NHANES I shown in the report by Flegal et al (3).
Competing biases of over- and underestimation
The estimate of 289,000 obesity-associated deaths in 2000
based on NHANES I as the derivation cohort obtained by the
methods of Allison et al (1) resembled the estimate by Flegal et al
(3) of 299,000 deaths, also based on NHANES I as the derivation
cohort. This similarity arises primarily because of competing
biases: overestimation from partial adjustment of the attributable
fraction, offset by underestimation due to the smaller hazard
ratios calculated from data with imputed smoking status. These
errors nearly cancelled each other out in this analysis of
NHANES I data, as shown in Table 4.
Similar estimates for overweight (BMI 25 to ,30) and for
a low BMI (,23 for the first 3 estimates shown and ,18.5 for
the fourth and fifth estimates) are shown in Figures 3 and 4. All

estimates of attributable deaths for both overweight and low
BMI were small. For overweight, the differences between the
published and the recalculated hazard ratio estimates were
slight, and the results of the partially adjusted method showed
only slight differences depending on which hazard ratios were
used. There was little difference between the partially adjusted
and the fully adjusted estimates. Changing the reference cate-
gory from BMI 23 to ,25 to BMI 18.5 to ,25 decreased the
estimated excess deaths for overweight from a small positive
number to a small negative number. For low weight, use of the
corrected NHANES I hazard ratios increased the estimate from
the partially adjusted method, but there was little effect of using
the fully adjusted method, of changing the reference category, or
of including additional covariates in the model.
Effects of changing reference categories
The study by Flegal et al (3) used a reference category of BMI
18.5 to ,25; the 2 earlier studies used a reference category of
BMI 23 to ,25 (1, 2). The effects of varying the lower bound of
the reference category on estimates of obesity-associated,
overweight-associated, and low weight­associated deaths, with
the upper bound held constant at a BMI of 25, are shown in
Figure 5. Although differences in estimates were not large in
any case, the major change was seen between a reference cat-
egory of BMI 22 to ,25 and a reference category of BMI 23 to
,25. Changing the lower bound from a BMI of 22 to BMI levels
,22 had little effect on the relative risks for the overweight and
obese categories, particularly at older ages in which most deaths
occur, and thus had little effect on estimates of excess deaths in
those categories. Changing the lower bound from a BMI of 22 to
BMI levels ,22 led to increased relative risks but a decreased
prevalence for the low-weight category and had little effect on
the estimate of excess deaths at low BMI because these effects
approximately counterbalanced each other.
DISCUSSION
The reports by Allison et al (1), Mokdad et al (2), and Flegal
et al (3) all used hazard ratios from NHANES I (the derivation
cohort) to estimate obesity-associated deaths in the US pop-
ulation (the target population). Flegal et al (3) used a statistical
method to calculate obesity-associated deaths that was different
from the partially adjusted method used in the other 2 articles.
Several articles (23­25) have compared the NHANES I­based
estimates from the several studies and have concluded from
the similarity between those estimates that the differences in the
statistical methods between the reports had little effect on the
estimates. We showed why this conclusion is incorrect.
The NHANES I hazard ratios used in the earlier reports (1, 2)
were too low, probably because of the use of incorrect smoking
data. Once the hazard ratios are corrected, the statistical methods
can be compared directly, and it becomes apparent that the
partially adjusted method used in the earlier reports (1, 2) leads to

considerably higher estimates for the target population than does
the fully adjusted method used by Flegal et al (3). For obesity-
associated deaths in 2000 based on NHANES I hazard ratios, the
partially adjusted method led to overestimates of '30%
(.100,000 deaths) relative to the fully adjusted method with the
same data, holding all other factors constant. Thus, when the
identical data are used, the difference in the statistical methods
has a large effect on the estimates.
The bias in the partially adjusted method arises from the failure
to account for the confounding effects of age, sex, and smoking
on mortality in the US population. In addition, the earlier reports
(1, 2) did not account for effect modification by age (18, 19). The
bias caused by partial adjustment of attributable fractions has
been repeatedly noted (16, 17, 26, 27). Besides NHANES I, the
earlier reports (1, 2) also used the partially adjusted method of
calculating attributable fractions with hazard ratios, adjusted for
age, sex, and smoking, from 5 other derivation cohorts to estimate
obesity-associated deaths for the same target population. Even if
the adjusted hazard ratios for the derivation cohorts are correct,
the attributable fraction method causes bias in the estimates for
the target population, because of the characteristics of the target
population itself. The bias results from failure to adjust for
confounding by age, sex, and smoking in the target population,
not in the derivation cohorts. In the US population, age and sex
are associated both with BMI and with mortality (6, 7, 18), but the
partially adjusted method fails to take this into account. Because
all the estimates are for the same target population with the same
confounding characteristics, all the estimates would be expected
to show bias due to use of the partially adjusted method, relative
to use of the fully adjusted method for the same derivation cohort.
In addition, however, when there is effect modification by age,
differences between the derivation cohort and the target pop-
ulation can increase the bias from partial adjustment (18, 19).
Thus, the use of partial adjustment with hazard ratios from the
other cohorts, which are less representative of the target pop-
ulation than NHANES is, may have led to even more pronounced
bias than illustrated above in our analysis of estimates based on
NHANES I hazard ratios.
The NHANES I example illustrates additional factors that
affect the estimates of obesity-associated deaths. When relative
risks are relatively small (generally ,2), modest differences may
have a large effect on estimates of obesity-associated deaths (3).
Estimates are also affected by the absolute numbers of deaths
in different years in the target population and by changes in
the prevalence of obesity. The choice of confounding variables to
include in the models also can affect the estimates. Flegal et al (3)
reported that, for their full sample, estimates of obesity-associ-
ated deaths ranged from 138,000 for a simple model to 79,000
excess deaths for a more complex model. Although we currently
only addressed bias due to the statistical method used to derive
estimates, additional bias may have arisen from the use of hazard
ratios that are not representative of the target population.

It has been suggested that it might be inappropriate to include
the lower half (BMI , 21) of the normal-weight category (BMI
18.5 to ,25) in the reference category (28). Use of the more
restrictive reference category of BMI 23 to ,25 will increase
the number of attributable deaths. As we showed here, the effect
was not, as might be surmised, due to the exclusion of BMI ,
21 from the reference category, but rather primarily simply due
to the exclusion of BMI 22 to ,23 from the reference category.
Thus, in this instance, there appears to be little reason for con-
cern about including the lower BMI values. Flegal et al (3) also
reported only a small difference in estimates between a refer-
ence category of BMI 21 to ,25 and a reference category of
18.5 to ,25.
The earlier reports (1, 2) used somewhat earlier cohorts that are
less representative of the US target population, did not properly
adjust attributable fractions for confounding, and did not allow
for effect modification by age. These factors may be among the
largest contributors to the differences. More minor differences
result from differences in the reference BMI category and from
increases in the absolute numbers of deaths in the United States
over time. In summary, the differences in estimates between the 3
reports can be explained in terms of the timing and sources of the
survey data and many methodologic differences, including es-
pecially the method of adjustment of attributable fractions for
confounding and effect modification.
Although the quantitative estimates differed between the 3
studies (1­3), all agreed in finding that obesity was associated
with excess mortality in the US population. These estimates of
obesity-associated deaths depend on estimates of relative risks,
which are measures of association that do not necessarily in-
dicate causal relations. In addition, these estimates use the as-
sumption that relative risks from past cohorts are applicable to
the present day. These estimates, like other attributable fraction
estimates, are based on the predicted numbers of deaths if
a factor had not been present. Thus, they estimate the health
burden associated with the presence of an exposure but not
necessarily the effects of possible interventions to prevent or
reduce exposure (29, 30). These estimates should be interpreted
cautiously.
The problem of bias introduced by misapplication of attrib-
utable fraction methods has the potential to affect results of
analyses that are used to make policy and should be addressed.
Errors in the calculation and interpretation of attributable frac-
tions are common, and the direction and magnitude of the effects
are not completely predictable (27). Further difficulties arise in
attempting to use attributable fraction methods to compare or
rank the burden of different risk factors (31). Two workshops
have been held to address issues related to the calculation and
interpretation of attributable health burden estimates (32, 33).
The development and evaluation of methods to estimate the effect
on mortality of interventions on lifestyle-related factors remains
an important challenge.
