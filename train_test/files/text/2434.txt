Abstract
Background: A recent study examined the prevalence, clinical correlates, age trends, and stability of unhealthy
weight control behaviors (UWCB; purging and diet pill use) in a nationally representative sample of Norwegian boys
and girls. The purpose of this study was to provide similar, comparative analyses for a nationally representative
sample of American youth.
Methods: Data were extracted from the restricted use data files of survey Waves I, II, and III of the National
Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health), selecting all participants who at Wave I had provided
information on age, sex, and UWCB. Using UWCB information, three groups were created (purging, diet pill use,
and no recent UWCB "controls") and compared on indicators of adverse health or mental health.
Results: Girls consistently were more likely than boys to report UWCB. UWCB were significantly associated with
higher body mass index, self-perception of being overweight, low self-esteem, depression, and delinquency. Prevalence
estimates for purging remained relatively constant across the three survey waves; in contrast, diet pill use was especially
common at Wave III.
Conclusions: Age trends, gender differences, and clinical correlates of change in the likelihood of UWCB between
Waves I-III were all identified in analyses comparing purging and diet pill use in American adolescents. Females
and older adolescents were specifically more likely to engage in pill use than purging, and individuals with increased
weight dissatisfaction, a history of delinquent behaviors, more depression symptoms, or lower self-esteem were more
likely to engage in an unhealthy weight control behavior over time. While the Norwegian study found that prevalence
of purging was lower among young adult participants, our results suggested that there were no significant differences
in prevalence between age groups.

Background
Various community surveys have shown that disordered
eating behaviors are prevalent in adolescents, correlated
with indicators of psychosocial impairment, and pre-
dictive of unfavorable physical or mental health outcomes
[1-3]. Although disordered eating symptoms such as binge
eating, purging, or non-purging compensatory behaviors
(for example fasting, excessive exercise, or diet pill use)
have often been studied in adolescence as early symptoms
of or as proxy variables for full syndrome eating disorders
(e.g., anorexia nervosa or bulimia nervosa) [4], investi-
gators have more recently begun to examine disordered
eating as a clinically relevant phenomena even in the
absence of a diagnostic eating disorder, determined by
criteria in the DSM-5 (or DSM-IV).
For example, purging behaviors have received increasing
scientific attention as symptoms of clinical relevance
in their own right. Studies have shown that vomiting
or misusing laxatives or diuretics to manage weight is
associated with low self-esteem, depressive symptoms,
substance use, and impaired psychosocial adjustment
[5-10] and also predict excess weight gain [11]. Results

from a large community-based study indicated that women
who used extreme weight control behaviors, regardless of
whether or not these behaviors occurred in the context of
binge eating, reported higher levels of psychopathology and
psychosocial impairment [12]. Moreover, several genetic
studies have found that, notwithstanding some overlap
between latent risk factors for binge eating and purging,
there may be distinct risk factors for purging versus
binge eating, which warrants further investigation of
compensatory behaviors [13,14].
Non-purging forms of weight control behavior have
been studied less extensively, yet the limited available
evidence indicates that these behaviors also are associ-
ated with measures of psychological distress such as
anxiety or depressive symptoms [15]. Currently, there is
some inconsistency as to whether diet pill use should be
classified as a "purging" or "non-purging" weight control
behavior [1,15]. Furthermore, research has rarely exam-
ined diet pill use outside of these grouped categories, and
consequently little is known about the behavior itself.
Two longitudinal studies have reported on changes in
purging and non-purging weight control behaviors from
adolescence to young adulthood. Project EAT, a longitu-
dinal study of high school students in Minneapolis/St.
Paul (United States, US), found an age effect in that,
over a 10-year period, the prevalence of diet pill use
increased in girls and boys, laxative use increased in
girls, and vomiting decreased in girls and boys [1]. New
data from Project EAT also suggest a cohort effect:
comparisons of two cohorts revealed that fewer stu-
dents in a cohort recruited in 2010 reported extreme
weight control behaviors than in the (original) 1999
sample [16]. The second study ("Young in Norway") was
conducted among a nationally representative sample of
Norwegian school children (ages 12 to 20 years at study
entry), contrasting purging and non-purging weight
control behaviors. In this study, diet pill use was classi-
fied as a non-purging behavior. Age differences in rates
of purging and non-purging weight control behaviors
were examined by grouping participants into four age
categories: 14­16, 17­19, 20­22, and  23 years at each
wave. In both boys and girls, prevalence estimates of
purging and non-purging weight control behaviors
gradually declined with the transition from adolescence
to adulthood [15].
The purpose of the present study was to determine
whether age trends and predictors of purging and non-
purging weight control behaviors observed in Norwegian
adolescents [15] could be replicated in a large, nationally
representative sample of US youth from the National
Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health)
where non-purging behavior were limited to diet pill use.
First, we tested age trends from adolescence into adult-
hood in two types of extreme weight control behaviors in
boys and girls: vomiting or laxative use as one group, and
diet pill use only as a separate group. Consistent with
trends observed in the Young in Norway study, we hy-
pothesized decreasing prevalence estimates with increas-
ing age. Second, we examined correlates of these extreme
weight control behaviors in boys and girls by comparing
them to participants with no recent extreme weight con-
trol behaviors. Consistent with previous findings, we hy-
pothesized that more girls than boys would report these
extreme weight control behaviors. We further hypothe-
sized that students who reported purging (vomiting or
laxative use) or diet pill use for weight control would differ
significantly (reflecting greater disturbance) from students
who did not engage in any UWCB on measures of body
weight, self-esteem, and self-reported depression.
Methods
Data source
The present study extracted data from the restricted-
use National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health
(Add Health) survey Waves I (1994­1995), II (1996),
and III (2001­2002). Add Health has been following
over 20,000 American adolescents over the course of
fourteen years, with four waves of data collection since
the study's inception when participants were in grades
7­12. (Wave IV did not collect data about purging and,
therefore, was not used for the present study).
Wave I was conducted between 1994 and 1995, with
sampling from 132 schools in the United States, representa-
tive for region, urbanicity, size, and ethnicity. Initially, 80
high schools were recruited, and each participating school
identified a feeder middle school in the community, with
the requirement of the inclusion of 7th graders. A total of
20,074 adolescents in grades 7­12 were tested using
self-administered, in-school questionnaires given during a
60-minute class period. Wave II was conducted in 1996,
and included over 15,000 of the participants originally
tested in Wave I. In-home interviews were conducted with
participants at Wave III (August of 2001 to April of 2002),
with participants now in early adulthood. Further details
about the study design can be found elsewhere [17].
Only participants, who provided consistent data across
survey waves on birth date and gender, and completed
questions concerning vomiting or use of laxatives or diet
pills for weight control purposes in Wave I, were included
in the present study. A total of 168 participants were
dropped due to missing weight control behaviors at Wave
I or inconsistent age and gender data across waves.
Instruments and procedures
Add Health surveys included a wide range of questions
pertaining to psychological and physical health issues
and behaviors. The variables used in this study are
described below.
Stephen et al. Journal of Eating Disorders 2014, 2:16 Page 2 of 9

Demographic information was extracted from the Wave
I dataset. Age was recorded in Waves II and III as age at
last birthday. Age at Wave I was calculated by subtracting
birth date from the date of interview.
Unhealthy weight control behaviors (UWCB). A two-
part question measured whether participants engaged in
a number of weight control behaviors. Participants were
asked whether, in the past 7 days, they had been trying
to lose or maintain weight (yes/no). Participants who
answered "no" were instructed to skip the follow-up
items; those answering "yes" were asked follow-up ques-
tions regarding what specific behaviors were used to do so
(response choices included: vomiting; laxative use; diet pill
use; dieting; exercising; other; none). Frequency of occur-
rence was not measured in the Add Health surveys.
Classification of participants based on unhealthy weight
control behaviors. At each wave, participants were classi-
fied into one of three mutually exclusive groups. The
purging group included those indicating vomiting or
using laxatives (regardless of whether they also reported
diet pill use) as their means of trying to lose or maintain
weight; the diet pill only group included those reporting
diet pill use but not purging behaviors for weight control
purposes. Purging and diet pill use were coded as mutually
exclusive in order to analyze diet pill use as a unique be-
havior and compare pill use with more commonly studied
UWCB. Finally, a third group (no recent UWCB) com-
prised all remaining participants, i.e., participants who
were not trying to control their weight or participants
who reported that they had dieted or exercised (because
these behaviors, unless taken to an extreme, are recom-
mended as healthy weight management strategies). Partici-
pants reporting "other" behaviors to manage their weight
were also classified into the comparison group.
Consistent with the Center for Disease Control (CDC),
Body Mass Index (BMI) was calculated by dividing weight
(in pounds) by the product of height (in inches) squared
times the value 703 [18]. Weight Self-Perception was mea-
sured using a single item ("How do you think of yourself
in terms of weight?"). Five responses were available using
a Likert scale: "overweight", "slightly overweight", "about
the right weight", "slightly underweight", and "very
underweight".
Self-esteem was measured using four questions based
on Rosenberg's Self-Esteem Scale [19] that were asked at
each wave ("you have many good qualities"; "you have
much to be proud of"; "you like yourself just the way
you are"; and "you feel you are doing things just right").
Participants rated each item on a scale from 1 to 5, and
a total score was calculated by summing the items [20].
(Cronbach's alpha =0.79 at Wave I, 0.80 at Wave II, and
0.78 at Wave III).
Depressive symptoms. At each wave, participants com-
pleted a modified version of the Center for Epidemiologic
Studies-Depression (CES-D) scale. Participants rated
symptom frequency in the past week on a scale from 0
(never or rarely) to 3 (most of the time). Using the 9
items that were asked at all three waves, we created a
total score by adding across all items for each wave.
[21] Cronbach's alpha was 0.81 at Wave I, 0.82 at Wave II,
and 0.80 at Wave III. Because of its skewed distribution in
our sample, the scale was then natural log transformed.
Delinquency. Consistent with other studies that have
utilized Add Health data, [22] seven questions concern-
ing delinquent behavior available in all three study waves
were used to create a binary delinquency variable.
Specifically, participants were asked "In the past 12 months,
how often did you: (1) Damage property that didn't
belong to you; (2) Steal something worth more than
$50; (3) Go into a house or building to steal something;
(4) Use or threaten to use a weapon to get something from
someone; (5) sell marijuana or other drugs; (6) steal some-
thing worth less than $50; (7) Take part in a fight where
a group of your friends was against another group".
Responses to each individual question were dichoto-
mized by recoding the original 4-point Likert format
(never, one or two times, three or four times, five times
or more) into never versus one or more. The recoded
items were then summed. Because the delinquency sum-
mary score was extremely skewed with most participants
reporting no delinquent behaviors (greater than or equal
to 59.0% at all waves), and the majority of the rest report-
ing just one delinquent behavior (greater than or equal to
20.7% at all waves), we recoded it into a binary categorical
variable with a meaningful cut point (0 = no instances,
1 = one or more instances of delinquent behavior).
Statistical analyses
All analyses were performed using Stata 13.1. Chi-square
tests were used first to analyze the differences in preva-
lence for purging and diet pill use at each wave as well
as between boys and girls. Mixed effects logistic regres-
sion models were tested to identify changes in these
behaviors over the three waves for boys and girls. Mixed
effects logistic regression analysis was next used to test
for age and gender trends in purging and diet pill use.
Finally, mixed effects logistic regression models adjust-
ing for age and gender as covariates were performed to
examine differences in the UWCB groups on all mea-
sures of psychosocial factors.
Results
Sample description
At Wave I, data were available for 10,173 boys and
10,437 girls (mean age = 15.66, SD = 1.75); at Wave II,
our sample included 7,108 male and 7,510 female partic-
ipants (mean age = 16.22, SD = 1.64); and at Wave III,
7,104 male participants and 7,927 female participants

(mean age = 21.96, SD = 1.77) were included. In all,
55.99% participants included in our study had data for
all three study waves. Efforts to change (gain or lose)
weight or maintain weight were reported by a majority
of participants. At each wave, about one-third of the par-
ticipants reported that they were trying to lose weight
(34.32%, 33.38%, 33.69% at waves I, II, and III, respect-
ively). Trying to maintain weight also was reported by a
substantial subset of participants at Wave I (34.28%) and
Wave II (33.11%) but was less common at wave III
(15.10%). Fewer participants reported efforts to gain
weight than trying to lose or maintain weight at each of
the waves (Wave I: 19.66%; Wave II: 18.88%; Wave III:
15.62%). Only a minority of participants at Wave I
(11.74%) and Wave II (14.63%) reported that they were
not trying to do anything to change or maintain their
current weight; at Wave III, about one-third of the sam-
ple (35.59%) reported that they made no efforts to
change or maintain their weight.
It should also be noted that some attrition bias was
found in this sample, such that men were more likely to
drop out (OR = 0.90, p < 0.001, CI = 0.85-0.96 at Wave II
and OR = 0.71, p < 0.000, CI = 0.67-0.76 at Wave III) as
were older participants (OR = 1.56, p < 0.000, CI = 1.53-
1.60 at Wave II and OR = 1.09, p < 0.000, CI = 1.08-1.11
at Wave III). However, neither purging nor laxative use
at Wave I was associated with attrition at Wave II, and
neither purging nor laxative use at Waves I or II was as-
sociated with attrition at Wave III.
Gender and age trends for UWCB prevalence
Table 1 summarizes the prevalence of purging and diet pill
use at each wave by gender. As shown in Table 1, signifi-
cantly more girls than boys reported vomiting, laxative
misuse, or using diet pills to lose or maintain weight at
each of the three waves. Additionally, because of the small
numbers of individuals reporting purging by means of
vomiting or laxative misuse, the two groups were com-
bined into one "purging" category, which similarly showed
higher rates of purging for girls than boys at all three
waves. Mixed effects logistic regression analyses were run
to evaluate change in each outcome across the three
waves. The results indicated diet pill use increased sig-
nificantly for men, and both diet pill and laxative use
increased significantly for women.
Furthermore, because of the range of ages found in each
study wave and the desire to analyze changes both over
time and across ages, mixed logistic regression models
were also tested with age as a predictor variable, broken
into four age categories (14­16, 17­19, 20­22, and 23 or
above) to ensure a sufficient sample size in each group.
Similar analyses were also performed to test for gender
effects overall. Figure 1 illustrates the changes in preva-
lence of purging and diet pill use from adolescence into
early adulthood, and Table 2 shows these age group and
gender effects for both the purging (vomiting or laxative
misuse) and diet pill only groups against the current
UWCB group. As shown in this table, significant gender
differences were found for both purging and diet pill use.
However, age effects were found only for diet pill use;
there was no significant difference for purging across age
groups. Further, Table 3 breaks down the prevalence of
purging and pill use in each age group by wave, given the
possibility for individuals to be classified in the same age
group over multiple waves. Age-adjusted prevalence rates
were also calculated using population data from the 2000
United States Census due to the higher number of obser-
vations in older age groups [23]. In multivariate modeling,
however, these repeat observations are also accounted for
through the use of mixed models.

Clinical correlates for UWCB
Mixed effects logistic regression analysis was then used
to examine a range of clinical correlates separately for
purging and diet pill use. In each model, age and gender
were used as control variables, and each variable of
interest was interacted with time in order to ascertain
the main effect of the variable as well as its effect over
time. Because of the high correlation between perceived
weight image and BMI, these variables and their inter-
action with time were tested together in a model to de-
termine whether they were independently associated
with purging and pill use. Results are shown in Table 4.
Significant overall group differences were found for
each of the clinical correlates examined in this study,
with the exception of BMI. Participants who either
purged or used diet pills as a form of UWCB perceived
themselves as more overweight, reported higher de-
pression symptom scores, reported lower self-esteem,
and were more likely to have engaged in delinquent
behaviors. After adjusting for weight image, BMI was
not significantly associated with either the purging or
diet pill group. Significant interactions with time were
found in diet pill use for depression scores and self-
esteem. Participants with higher levels of depression
and lower self-esteem at Wave I showed a smaller
increase in diet pill use over time. None of the clinical
correlates were associated with changes in the likeli-
hood of purging over time.
Discussion
This study examined prevalence and correlates of
UWCB as well as trends over time in these behaviors in a
large, nationally representative sample of males and
females. Consistent with prior research, UWCB were
reported by far more female participants than male
participants [1,15]. The prevalence estimates obtained
in our sample for vomiting or laxative misuse for weight
control reasons are lower than estimates reported in other
studies [15], most likely due to the short time frame used
in Add Health for measuring UWCB (past 7 days).
Regardless of how many adolescents engage in pur-
ging, experts uniformly agree that vomiting or laxative
abuse is a health risk behavior and should be addressed
via therapeutic or preventive interventions [15].
Individuals who acknowledged purging had greater
weight dissatisfaction than those in the no recent UWCB
group. These results are noteworthy because the no recent
UWCB group included participants who reported using
various behaviors to try and lose or maintain weight that
were not considered to be UWCB as defined in this study.
This makes our comparisons more conservative than had
we used a comparison group comprised of individuals
who did not report any efforts to manage their weight.
Prior studies have shown that UWCB actually are
associated concurrently and prospectively with increased
weight [1]. Moreover, also in keeping with prior studies,
compared to the no recent UWCB group, the purging
group scored lower on self-esteem and higher on depres-
sion [4]. At Wave I, the purging group was more likely

than the no recent UWCB group to report having engaged
in delinquent behaviors; however, there was no significant
difference in the likelihood of purging or diet pill use over
time for those engaged in delinquent behavior compared
to those who did not. Both purging and delinquent be-
haviors fall in the spectrum of disinhibited or impulsive
behavior. Reports of delinquent behavior declined with
each successive wave in all three groups, possibly reflect-
ing increasing maturity and self-control, although rates
of purging showed no evidence of declining over time.
Additional studies are needed to further explore the
relationship between delinquent behavior and purging.
It is important to note that the models testing both
BMI and weight dissatisfaction showed significant asso-
ciations between weight dissatisfaction for both UWCB
outcomes, but there were no significant associations for
BMI. This may be due to the fact that a significant number
of individuals in this sample who did not show any recent
UWCB were also trying to lose or maintain weight. Future
research may wish to investigate how these purging and
pill use groups differ specifically from those who were not
trying to lose or maintain weight as opposed to the no
recent UWCB group more broadly in order to more fully
understand the differences between weight dissatisfaction
and BMI as clinical correlates.
Overall, our findings suggest that purging and diet pill
use are associated with a less favorable profile on the
clinical correlates examined in this study. Among those
who reported purging or diet pill use only to manage
their weight, these correlates suggest more pathology
compared to the no recent UWCB group, including
higher weight dissatisfaction, greater prevalence of delin-
quent behaviors, lower self-esteem, and increased de-
pression. However, only depression and self-esteem were
associated with change in the likelihood of pill use over
time, and none of the clinical correlates were related to
changes in the likelihood of purging. Research is needed
to determine whether educating individuals about the
lack of efficacy of purging as a long-term weight man-
agement strategy would reduce the prevalence or inci-
dence of these behaviors.
To our knowledge, ours is the first study to examine
the prevalence of diet pill use in the absence of purging
behaviors [24]. Diet pill use was considerably more
prevalent than purging, and unlike purging, showed a
considerable increase with age. At Wave I, diet pill users
were significantly older than purgers. More importantly,
the diet pill group differed significantly from the no recent
UWCB group on all clinical correlates with the exception
of BMI. Diet pill use was associated with greater weight

able scores on measures of psychological adjustment such
as self-reported depression or self-esteem at Wave I. In
addition, higher levels of depression and lower self-esteem
were associated with an increased likelihood of diet pill
use over time.
In contrast to findings from a Norwegian study where
the prevalence of purging was found to be lower among
late adolescent or young adult participants [15], our
findings from the Add Health sample suggest that pur-
ging prevalence remained relatively unchanged across
the age groups, and diet pill use was far more prevalent
among participants in the age groups of 17 years and
older. Thus, the development of these behaviors may be
different for American youth, and more research on
predictors of purging--particularly diet pill use in the
absence of purging--is warranted to further identify how
these behaviors develop in American youth.
Several limitations need to be acknowledged. The Add
Health measures used in our analyses relied on self-
report, which is subject to recall errors or biased report-
ing. The time frame used for measuring presence of
UWCB was shorter (past 7 days) than is typical in most
epidemiological studies of disordered eating. Therefore,
it is unclear the extent to which individuals in the com-
parison group (no recent UWCB) may have also engaged
in diet pill use, laxative misuse, or vomiting for weight
control purposes during the longer time frame covered
in some of the psychosocial measures. For example, no
time frame was specified for measuring self-esteem,
and delinquency was based on the past 12 months.
Inadvertent inclusion in the no recent UWCB group of
individuals who might have reported "yes" to the question
about purging or diet pill use had the time frame been
broader renders our group comparisons more conserva-
tive. Similarly, those who reported "other" mechanisms
with which to lose or maintain weight were not asked
about what those mechanisms were, and therefore it is
possible that these could be classified as UWCB.
Limitations are also associated with several of the vari-
ables used in this study. For example, Add Health did
not collect information on the type of diet pills used.
Similarly, data on binge eating, a symptom often associ-
ated with purging or diet pill use, were not collected. In
addition, because frequency information was not avail-
able for UWCB, we were unable to study the severity of

these behaviors. Finally, low frequency of engagement in
delinquent behaviors limited us to defining delinquency
more broadly as a binary yes/no for engagement in
delinquent behaviors and precluded an examination of
each behavior separately.
Another potential limitation arises from our classifica-
tion of purging and diet pill use. Specifically, despite the
fact that this was a large, nationally representative,
epidemiological study, the low prevalence of UWCB
required that we group individuals who vomited and those
who abused laxatives into one group. Larger samples are
needed to determine whether these two types of purging
behavior should be classified into distinct groups. This
may require oversampling on these behaviors given their
low prevalence rate in the population. Moreover, we prior-
itized purging over diet pill use, allowing into our purging
group individuals who also used diet pills but not vice
versa (i.e., the diet pill group only reported diet pill use
and not purging).
Finally, concerns arise regarding the analyses in Tables 2
and 3 given that not every subject has an equal probability
of contributing to the various age-specific prevalences.
While the use of the mixed modeling helps to deal with
this issue, such unequal opportunities may present a prob-
lem. This concern is also compounded by the fact that
men and individuals who were older were significantly
more likely to drop out of the study at a follow up point,
and thus the results of this study must be interpreted with
caution.
Nonetheless, these limitations were offset by several
strengths. The study involved a nationally representative
sample, and therefore did not contain the limitations
inherent in studies of patient samples. Furthermore, the
large sample size afforded us the opportunity to analyze
both men and women, and the longitudinal design allowed
us to gain information on our sample over a considerable
period of time (8 years) from adolescence into early
adulthood. Finally, the classification system allowed an
opportunity to study diet pill use, a previously under-
studied behavior, as a unique UWCB.
Conclusion
This study examined the prevalence of vomiting, laxative
misuse, and diet pill use among adolescents, as well as
the age trends of these behaviors from adolescence into
adulthood and the clinical correlates that predict diet pill
use and purging UWCB. Results suggest that girls or
women are more likely than boys or men to engage in
each of these behaviors and that diet pill use, but not
vomiting or laxative misuse, increases over time. Fur-
thermore, results have shown significant differences
between diet pill use, purging UWCB, and the control
group for a variety of clinical correlates, supporting
research indicating that it is important to prevent, identify,
and treat nonclinical levels of disordered eating. Our
results differed from the Norwegian study in that we
did not find that purging prevalence was lower in
young adults. Whether these differences between our
and the Norwegian study reflect cultural differences or
are a function of methodological differences awaits
further investigation.
