OBJECTIVES: To characterize the extent and nature of
drug­alcohol interactions in older U.S. adults.
DESIGN: Cross-sectional.
SETTING: Community.
PARTICIPANTS: Nationally representative population-
based sample of community-dwelling older adults
(N = 2,975).
MEASUREMENTS: Regular drinkers were defined as
respondents who consumed alcohol at least weekly. Medi-
cation use was defined as the use of a prescription or non-
prescription medication or dietary supplement at least
daily or weekly. Micromedex was used to determine drug
interactions with alcohol and their corresponding severity.
RESULTS: One thousand one hundred six (41%) of the
participants consumed alcohol regularly, and 567 (20%)
were at-risk for a drug­alcohol interaction because they
were regular drinkers and concurrently using alcohol-inter-
acting medications. More than 90% of these interactions
were of moderate or major severity. Antidepressants and
analgesics were the most commonly used alcohol-interact-
ing medications in regular drinkers. Older adult men with
multiple chronic conditions had the highest prevalence of
potential drug­alcohol interactions.
CONCLUSION: The potential for drug­alcohol interac-
tions in the older U.S. adult population may have impor-
tant clinical implications. Efforts to better understand and
prevent the use of alcohol-interacting medications by regu-
lar drinkers, particularly heavy drinkers, are warranted in
this population. J Am Geriatr Soc 63:2324­2331, 2015.
Key words: aging; prescription drug abuse and misuse
The vast majority of older adults in the United States
use prescription and nonprescription medications,1
and more than 50% drink alcohol regularly.2 Older adults
are also more likely than younger adults to suffer from
chronic conditions and to experience the adverse effects of
medications3 and alcohol use.4 Many medications that
older adults commonly use, such as analgesics, sedatives,
and antidepressants, interact with alcohol and further
increase the risk of adverse drug events, including falls,
automobile crashes, and death.5,6 Older adults who drink
alcohol regularly are more likely than those who do not to
be admitted for an adverse drug event,4 with more than
25% of emergency department admissions associated with
a drug­alcohol interactions.7 Despite this, nationally repre-
sentative information on the prevalence of drug­alcohol
interactions in the U.S. older adult population is limited.
Previous studies examining drug­alcohol interactions in
the United States have not focused on older adults and have
been limited to prescription medications.8,9 A study con-
ducted in 2008 using data from the 1999 to 2002 National
Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES)
reports that approximately 13.5% of adults aged 20 and
older were using an alcohol-interacting prescription medica-
tion, of whom 6% were at high risk of an alcohol-related
adverse event.8 a study derived from pharmacy claims and
survey data in low-income beneficiaries of the Pennsylvania
Pharmaceutical Assistance Program reported that 20% of
adults aged 65 and older were at risk of drug­alcohol inter-
actions,9 but that study was not nationally representative
and excluded information on nonprescription medications.
The current study used data from the National, Social
life, Health and Aging Project (NSHAP), a population-
based survey of community-dwelling older U.S. adults. The
primary objective was to examine the prevalence of drug­
alcohol interactions in older adults in the United States
overall and according to therapeutic class of prescription
and nonprescription medications and to identify older
adult individuals most at risk of such use.

time of screening in 2004) from households across the Uni-
ted States. Blacks, Hispanics, men, and the oldest persons
(75­84 at the time of screening) were oversampled. Of
4,017 eligible persons, 3,005 were successfully interviewed,
yielding an unweighted response rate of 74.8% and a
weighted response rate of 75.5%. Professional interviewers
conducted in-home interviews and compiled medication
logs in English and Spanish between July 2005 and March
2006. The National Institutes of Health sponsors NSHAP,
and the study protocol has been previously described.1 The
University of Chicago and National Opinion Research
Center institutional review boards approved the NSHAP
protocol, and all respondents provided written informed
consent.
Data
Data on medication use were collected during the house-
hold interview by direct observation of medication bottles
using a computer-based log. Participants were asked to
provide the interviewer with all medications used "on a
regular schedule, like every day or every week" and were
instructed to include "prescription and nonprescription
medications, over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and
herbal and alternative medicines." All identifiable drug
names for prescription and over-the-counter medications
and dietary supplements were coded. Additional details on
the method of drug coding have been previously
described.10
A drug information database (Thomson Micromedex;
Truven Health Analytics, Denver, CO) was used to iden-
tify alcohol-interacting medications and to provide a mea-
sure of the severity of the interaction (contraindicated--the
drugs are contraindicated for use; major--the interaction
may be life threatening or require medical intervention to
minimize or prevent serious adverse events; moderate--the
interaction may result in the exacerbation of the individ-
ual's condition or require an alternative therapy; minor--
the interaction has limited clinical effects).
Drinking characteristics were defined based on
responses to a series of questions: "Do you ever drink any
alcohol beverages such as beer, wine, or liquor?" "In the
past three months, on average, how many days per week
have you had any alcohol to drink (for example, beer,
wine, or liquor)?" and "How many drinks do you have on
the days that you drink?" Nonregular drinkers were
respondents who did not drink alcohol or drank less than
1 day per week. Regular drinkers were respondents who
drank at least 1 day per week. Regular drinkers were fur-
ther characterized into three categories based on the fre-
quency of drinking on drinking days: light drinkers
(1 drink/d), heavy drinkers (2­3 drinks/d), and binge drin-
kers (4 drinks/d). These definitions have been previously
used to define drinking behavior in older adults.2,4 respon-
dents with the potential for a drug­alcohol interaction
were defined as those who were regular drinkers and using
at least one alcohol-interacting medication with any level
of interaction severity.
The following age intervals were used: 57 to 64, 65 to
74, and 75 to 85. (Some individuals originally 84 years
old at the time of interview had turned 85.) Race and eth-
nicity were defined as white, black, Hispanic non-black,
and other. Level of education was defined as less than high
school education, high school graduate or GED comple-
tion, some college or vocational education (associate
degree included), and a bachelor's degree or higher. Lastly,
income was divided into four categories by asking,
"Approximately what was the income of your household
last year [this year minus one] before taxes or deductions
(<$25,000, $25,000­50,000, <$50,000­74,999, $75,000)?"
Healthcare and health-related factors were also impor-
tant considerations. Information about insurance status
was ascertained by asking, "Are you currently covered by
any of the following health insurance programs (Medicare,
Medicaid, private insurance, Veterans Administration, or
other)?" Participants who did not report being covered by
any of these programs (including other) were considered to
have no insurance.
A measure of self-reported health was included
whereby respondents had to qualify their physical health
into a standard 5-point scale (poor, fair, good, very good,
excellent). A measure of comorbidity was included because
concurrent health conditions can affect drug­alcohol inter-
actions. A comorbidity index was calculated based on a
previously validated algorithm used in questionnaire and
survey research11 in response to whether they had had a
myocardial infarction, heart failure, peripheral vascular
disease, peptic ulcer disease or stomach ulcers, arthritis,
emphysema or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,
stroke, diabetes mellitus, dementia or Alzheimer's disease,
cirrhosis, leukemia, lymphoma, poor kidney function, or
cancer.
Analysis
Weights included in the National, Social life, Health and
Aging Project (NSHAP) data set were used for each analy-
sis to adjust for oversampling, differential probability of
selection, and differential nonresponse.12 Descriptive statis-
tics were used to estimate the prevalence of drug­alcohol
interactions (overall and according to drinking frequency)
in the entire sample and stratified according to age and
sex. The chi-square statistic was used to test statistical sig-
nificance at the .05 level. Logistic regression was used to
assess which variables were significantly (P < .05) associ-
ated with a potential drug­alcohol interaction. All analyses
were performed using SAS version 9.3 (SAS Institute, Inc.,
Cary, NC).
RESULTS
Table 1 presents older adult sociodemographic and health
characteristics overall and according to drinking status. In
2005 and 2006, 41% of older adults were regular drinkers
of alcohol (1 drinks/wk). The prevalence of regular drink-
ing was more common in older adult men, participants
aged 57 to 64, and white participants and those with
higher income, more education, and excellent self-reported
health. Older adults who were regular drinkers were sig-
nificantly (P < .001) less likely to use alcohol-interacting
medications. Seventeen percent of older adults were light
drinkers (1 drinks/d), 20% were moderate drinkers (2­
3 drinks/d), and less than 5% were heavy or binge drin-
kers (4 drinks/d). Women of all ages were significantly

(P < .001) less likely to drink alcohol regularly than men,
and of those who drank, women of all ages were signifi-
cantly more likely to be light drinkers (Appendix S1).
Respondents in the sample used 76 of the 165 alco-
hol-interacting medications identified in Micromedex.
Whereas 57.7% of older U.S. adults use at least one alco-
hol-interacting medication, approximately 21% (95% con-
fidence interval = 18.7­23.0) are at risk of a drug­alcohol
interaction (regular drinkers who concurrently use at least
one alcohol-interacting medication). The prevalence of
potential drug­alcohol interactions increased with age for
men, but not women, and was highest in in the oldest men
(75­84). The prevalence of any drug­alcohol interaction
was higher in men than women of all age groups.
Figure 1 depicts the prevalence of multiple (2) drug­
alcohol interactions according to age and sex. Approxi-
mately 8.3% of respondents reported the concurrent use of
two or more alcohol-interacting medications with regular

drinking; men were significantly (P < .001) more likely than
women to be at risk of multiple drug­alcohol interactions.
The difference between men and women persisted across the
older age groups but not those aged 57 to 64.
Table 2 depicts the likelihood of a potential drug­
alcohol interaction stratified according to respondent
sociodemographic and health characteristics. Potential
drug­alcohol interactions were significantly more likely in
men (P < .001), non-Hispanic white respondents (P = .01),
wealthier respondents (P < .001), and those with greater
formal education P < .001). Individuals with greater comor-
bidity were also significantly more likely to experience a
potential drug­alcohol interaction.
Overall, drug­alcohol interactions were most common
in older adults reporting a diagnosis of liver disease; 35%
were regular drinkers concurrently using at least one alco-
hol-interacting medication. Aspirin and aspirin-containing
analgesics were the most commonly used alcohol-interact-
ing medication in all health conditions, with the exception
of metformin, which was more common in older adults
with diabetes mellitus. Men of all age groups with diabetes
or hypertension were significantly (P < .001) more likely
than women to experience a drug­alcohol interaction
(Appendix S2).
Four percent of older adults were potentially at risk of
a drug­alcohol interaction of major severity, 19% of mod-
erate severity, and 3% of minor severity, and fewer than
1% of individuals were using contraindicated alcohol-
interacting medications concurrently with regular drinking
(Table 3). More than half of potential drug­alcohol inter-
actions involved the use of alcohol-interacting analgesics
with major (2.7%) or moderate (11%) severity such as
aspirin, acetaminophen, and narcotics concurrently with
alcohol. In addition, 7% of older adults are regular
drinkers and concurrently using alcohol-interacting
psychotropic medications such as antidepressants, anxi-
olytics, and sedatives.
There were significant sex differences in the types of
alcohol-interacting medications used among older adults.
Prevalence of a major drug­alcohol interaction with antidi-
abetic agents and analgesics was significantly greater in
men than women aged 57 to 64. Although potential drug­
alcohol interactions with psychotropic medications were
more common in women than men aged 57­64, the use of
anxiolytics and sedatives was equally common in men and
women of all age groups. With the exception of men aged
65 to 74, women more frequently used antidepressants in
combination with regular alcohol consumption.
As expected, the types of medications most commonly
combined with regular drinking varied between age groups
for men and women. For example, men in the oldest age
group (75­84) were significantly more likely to drink regu-
larly and concurrently use analgesics and psychotropic
medications than men aged 57 to 64, who were more
likely to use antidiabetic agents in combination with alco-
hol. Women aged 57 to 64 were more likely to use psy-
chotropic medications, whereas women in the oldest age
group were more likely to use aspirin in combination with
alcohol.
Table 4 presents the weighted prevalence of drug­
alcohol interactions according to drinking status and
frequency. Regular drinkers were significantly (P < .05)
less likely to use alcohol-interacting narcotic analgesics
(2.4% vs 4.1%), acetaminophen (5.3% vs 9.7%), diabetes
mellitus medications (8.4% vs 18.0%), and psychotropic
medications (18.9% vs 25.4%). Heavy drinkers
(4 drinks/d) were significantly less likely to use alcohol-
interacting psychotropic medications (13.0%) than light
(18.9%) and moderate (20.3%) drinkers. These findings
persisted in multivariate analyses controlling for age, sex,
race and ethnicity, and education.
DISCUSSION
To the knowledge of the authors, this is the first study to
use a nationally representative, population-based sample of
older U.S. adults to examine the concurrent use of medica-
tions and alcohol. The analyses indicate that one in five
older U.S. adults are potentially at risk for a drug­alcohol
interaction, particularly men aged 75 to 85, and more than
half of these interactions involved nonprescription medica-
tions, specifically aspirin. Nearly one in 10 older adults
were using multiple alcohol-interacting medications and
were regularly drinking alcohol. Thus, efforts to avoid the
potential for drug­alcohol interactions in older adults are
warranted, especially considering evidence that older
adults who drink alcohol regularly are more likely to be
admitted for an adverse drug event4 and that more than

25% of emergency department admissions are associated
with a drug­alcohol interactions.7
These estimates of drug­alcohol interactions were
greater than those reported in adults aged 20 and older in
the 1999 to 2002 NHANES,9 the only national popula-
tion-based study of drug­alcohol interactions in the United
States. This is not surprising, considering that the prior
study excluded nonprescription medications and that the
use of prescription and nonprescription medications,
including alcohol-interacting medications, increases with
age.1 The higher prevalence of drug­alcohol interactions
may also be related to the increasing prevalence of
unhealthy drinking in older U.S. adults.2 Although the
findings are similar to those reported previously,8
differences in data source and definitions of alcohol-inter-
acting medications limit comparability.
The current findings suggest that efforts to improve
the safe use of medications in older adults should focus on
increasing awareness of the health risks associated with
the use of specific medications concurrently with alcohol,
particularly in regular, heavy (or binge) drinkers. Although
drinking is common in older adults, increasing awareness
to facilitate more-informed decisions about drinking
behavior and medication use is especially important con-
sidering the increasingly unhealthy drinking patterns iden-
tified in older U.S. adults.13
The use of alcohol-interacting nonprescription medica-
tions is particularly noteworthy. More than half of the

drug­alcohol interactions identified involved an over-the-
counter medication or dietary supplement. For example,
11% of older adults in the United States were regularly
using aspirin concurrently with alcohol, 3% were using
vitamins, and 2% were using acetaminophen. These medi-
cations are available without a prescription, and physicians
often do not ask patients about their use of over-the-coun-
ter medications and dietary supplements.14 Therefore, peo-
ple may not be aware of the potential harmful interaction
effects with alcohol.
These findings indicate that the risk of drug­alcohol
interactions increases with age, particularly for men, and is
highest in men aged 75 to 85. Older adults with multiple
chronic conditions, particularly those with liver disease,
hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and depression, have the
highest prevalence of drug­alcohol interactions. To avoid
potentially harmful drug­alcohol interactions in these
at-risk chronically ill subpopulations, providers should reg-
ularly ask patients about their drinking behavior and medi-
cation use.
Several medications commonly used in the older adult
population were also found to be major contributors to
drug­alcohol interactions, for example, analgesics such as
acetaminophen and hydrocodone, antihistamines (e.g.,
diphenhydramine) for sleep and allergies, aspirin for car-
diovascular prevention, glyburide and metformin for dia-
betes mellitus, and benzodiazepines as sedatives. Providers
may consider substituting non-alcohol-interacting medica-
tions with similar therapeutic indications for alcohol-inter-
acting medications in at-risk individuals. Although this
may be possible for some medications (e.g., antihista-
mines), it may not be feasible for others (e.g., metformin).
Providers may also consider reducing prescriptions for
alcohol-interacting medications in individuals most at risk,
such as those with liver and kidney disease.
Although the current findings focused on the preva-
lence and patterns of drug­alcohol interactions in older
U.S. adults, the use of alcohol-interacting medications, par-
ticularly analgesics and diabetes mellitus and psychotropic
medications, was significantly lower in regular drinkers.
Regular drinkers who report heavy or binge drinking are
less likely to use a series of alcohol-interacting medica-
tions, compared to other regular drinkers. These findings
suggest that physicians may be asking their patients about
their drinking behavior and customizing their prescribing
practices accordingly. This is reassuring considering prior
evidence that physicians often do not counsel patients on
medication interactions with alcohol.5,15
Limitations
This study has several limitations. The potential for drug­
alcohol interactions and not actual interactions were exam-
ined. Also, many factors influence adverse drug effects of
alcohol consumption (e.g., liver function, dose, type of
interaction, timing of dose). Micromedex drug-interaction
software was used to identify potential interactions. Multi-
ple data sources are used in clinical settings to identify drug
interactions with varying definitions. For example, several
data sources include statins and ibuprofen as alcohol-inter-
acting medications, whereas Micromedex does not. In addi-
tion, Micromedex identifies some medications as alcohol

interacting, whereas other software (e.g., Lexi-comp;
Wolter Kluwer, Indianapolis, IN) does not. Therefore, the
current findings may over- or underestimate the preva-
lence of specific types of drug­alcohol interactions. The
findings may also overestimate the potential for harm
from drug­alcohol interactions because this estimate was
derived based on regular drinkers (1 drinks/wk), and the
timing of medication use was not incorporated. To better
estimate the magnitude of this problem, estimates of
drug­alcohol interactions based on drinking frequency are
also provided (see Appendix S3).
CONCLUSION
The concurrent use of medications with alcohol in older
U.S. adults is an important yet underrecognized public
health problem. The potential for drug­alcohol interac-
tions in older U.S. adults is significant and has important
clinical implications, particularly for the oldest adults and
chronically ill individuals. Strategies to better monitor and
prevent the use of alcohol-interacting medications in regu-
lar drinkers are warranted in this population.
