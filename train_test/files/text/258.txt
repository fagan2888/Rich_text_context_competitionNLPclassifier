and Immunization of Young Children
The Mediating Role of Age-Appropriate Well-Child Care Utilization
Ashley H. Schempf, BS; Cynthia S. Minkovitz, MD, MPP; Donna M. Strobino, PhD; Bernard Guyer, MD, MPH
Objective: To prospectively evaluate the impact of pa-
rental satisfaction on childhood immunization and the
mediating role of age-appropriate well-child care.
Design: Secondary analyses of cohort data from the Na-
tional Evaluation of Healthy Steps for Young Children.
Data sources included an enrollment questionnaire, par-
ent interview at 2 to 4 months, and medical records.
Setting: Twenty-four pediatric practices across the United
States.
Participants: A total of 4896 (85%) of the initial 5565
enrolled families who were interviewed at 2 to 4 months
and had abstracted medical records.
Main Exposure: Parental satisfaction with overall pe-
diatric care assessed at 2 to 4 months as excellent, good,
or fair/poor.
Main Outcome Measures: Age-appropriate first dose
of diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis; third dose of diphtheria-
tetanus-pertussis; and measles, mumps, and rubella
vaccinations; and up-to-date vaccinations at 24 months
(4 diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis, 3 polio, and 1 measles,
mumps, and rubella).
Results: The majority of parents were satisfied with their
child's health care; only 4% rated overall care as fair or
poor. Children whose parents reported fair/poor satis-
faction with care had a reduced odds of receiving
age-appropriate first dose of diphtheria-tetanus-
pertussis vaccination (odds ratio, 0.43; 95% confidence
interval, 0.28-0.67); third dose of diphtheria-tetanus-
pertussis vaccination (odds ratio, 0.52; 95% confidence
interval, 0.36-0.74); and measles, mumps, and rubella vac-
cination (odds ratio, 0.58; 95% confidence interval, 0.37-
0.92); and of being up to date by 24 months (odds ratio,
0.65; 95% confidence interval, 0.43-0.99) compared with
children whose parents reported excellent care, inde-
pendent of sociodemographic and maternal health care­
utilization variables. The negative effect of fair/poor sat-
isfaction on immunization was largely explained by
reduced utilization of age-appropriate well-child care.
Conclusion: Quality assurance activities that assess pa-
rental satisfaction with care may have added value in iden-
tifying children who are less likely to receive timely pre-
ventive services.

CHILDHOOD IMMUNIZA-
tion is considered to be
among the most effective
preventive services, and is
therefore critical to moni-
tor and evaluate.1 Although national im-
munization levels for a comprehensive se-
ries of vaccines among 2-year-olds recently
exceeded the Healthy People 2010 goal of
more than 80%,2 few children receive vac-
cine doses within age-appropriate win-
dows, exposing a significant problem of
delays in immunization. Most children re-
ceive at least 1 dose of the routinely rec-
ommended vaccines late, and only 42% of
children complete a basic series of vacci-
nations (4 diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis
[DTP], 3 polio, and 1 measles, mumps, and
rubella [MMR] vaccinations) at the rec-
ommended ages.3 These delays are not
trivial; one third of all children are under-
vaccinated for more than 6 months.4 Im-
munization delays increase the risk of dis-
ease outbreak and are markers for
inadequate receipt of other preventive ser-
vices.5 For these reasons, age-appropri-
ate immunization is a more accurate in-
dicator of adequate immunization than
whether immunizations have been re-
ceived by age 2 years.3,4,6,7
Timely immunization depends on both
appropriate access to health care and the
administration of eligible doses at each
visit. Family characteristics related to in-
adequate immunization include poverty,
lack of health insurance, later birth or-

der, young maternal age, low maternal education,8-14 and
inadequate prenatal care.15-19 Provider characteristics, in-
cluding immunization-related practices20,21 and struc-
tural attributes, such as long clinic waiting times,22,23 have
also been associated with underimmunization and are po-
tentially modifiable, unlike many personal characteris-
tics.
Parental satisfaction with pediatric care is an indica-
tor of provider quality that has been relatively unex-
plored in relation to childhood immunization. One prior
study reported an association between parental satisfac-
tion with pediatric care and up-to-date immunization at
24 months independent of maternal age, race, and edu-
cation12 but did not establish temporal ordering. It is also
not clear whether the potential relationship between pa-
rental satisfaction and children's immunization is the re-
sult of greater age-appropriate well-child care utiliza-
tion or of some combination of parental and health care
provider vigilance. In addition to promoting appropri-
ate utilization, satisfaction may increase engagement in
the health care process. Research on parental health be-
liefs and attitudes often assumes that parents decline im-
munization or are simply less knowledgeable and per-
sistent in the health care setting without also examining
their access and timely utilization of well-child care.24-26
The present study prospectively investigates the re-
lationship between parental satisfaction with care and
timely childhood vaccination in a large and diverse sample.
We examine whether satisfaction with early pediatric care
is related to timely and adequate immunization during the
first 2 years of life, and if so, whether this relationship is
mediated by greater utilization of age-appropriate well-
child care.
This study relies on prospective data collected as part
of a national evaluation of Healthy Steps for Young Chil-
dren--a pediatric practice­based intervention designed
to promote developmentally appropriate parenting prac-
tices by providing enhanced developmental services in
the first 3 years of life.27 The evaluation followed a co-
hort of 5565 families enrolled at 24 pediatric practices
across the US from the child's birth to age 3 years.27-29 In
contrast to other national surveys, such as the National
Survey of Early Childhood Health or the Consumer As-
sessment of Health Plan Satisfaction, this data set pro-
vides a unique opportunity to longitudinally evaluate the
relationship between parental satisfaction with early pe-
diatric care and subsequent vaccination.
METHODS
PARTICIPANTS
The study sample included 4756 families who enrolled in
Healthy Steps between September 1996 and November 1998,
completed an interview at 2 to 4 months, and had abstracted
medical records. Of the 5565 enrolled families, 4896 were in-
terviewed at 2 to 4 months (88%). Medical records were ab-
stracted for 4756 (97%) of these families, yielding overall in-
clusion of 85% of the initial cohort.
Institutional review board approval was obtained for this
study from The Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public
Health Committee on Human Research. Informed consent was
obtained at the time of enrollment and reviewed prior to the
interview.
DATA SOURCES
Three data sources inform these analyses: an enrollment par-
ent questionnaire, a parent interview at 2 to 4 months, and medi-
cal records. At enrollment (within 28 days of birth), a brief ques-
tionnaire provided sociodemographic data about both parents
and the infant. At 2 to 4 months, information was obtained
through a telephone interview with parents, primarily the
mother, regarding services received, satisfaction with ser-
vices, and maternal health care utilization. The interviews were
conducted in English or Spanish by trained interviewers. Medi-
cal records were abstracted up to 32 months of age to obtain
information on the frequency and timing of well-child visits
and immunizations. A random sample of approximately 5% of
records was reabstracted at each site with agreement of 87%
or higher for visit type, 96% or higher for visit date, 99% or
higher for vaccine type, and 98% or higher for vaccine date.
STUDY VARIABLES
Dichotomous age-appropriate immunization measures were con-
structed according to minimum age and spacing guidelines of
the 1997 American Academy of Pediatrics Red Book,30 the edi-
tion in use when the majority of study children were eligible
for immunization (Table 1). Three age-appropriate measures--
first dose of DTP (DTP1), third dose of DTP (DTP3), and
MMR--and 1 up-to-date measure of 4 doses of DTP, 3 doses
of polio, and 1 dose of MMR vaccination at 24 months were
analyzed. First dose DTP, DTP3, and MMR were chosen to rep-
resent different ages at vaccination (2, 6, and 12 months, re-
spectively).
Parental satisfaction with pediatric care was evaluated with
a global measure assessed when the child was 2 to 4 months
old. Parents were asked to rate doctors and nurses at their site
of care in "providing good health care since [their baby] left
the hospital after birth," with responses grouped as excellent,
good, or fair/poor. This measure corresponds with the global
measure included in Consumer Assessment of Health Plan Sat-
isfaction and the National Survey of Early Childhood Health,
which asks parents to rate their child's health care on a scale
from 0 to 10 (10 indicating the best possible care). The corre-
lation coefficients between the global satisfaction measure and
other multiple-item scales of satisfaction with provider listen-
ing and time spent with the provider were high in our sample,
demonstrating construct validity.
Several sociodemographic8-13,16,31,32 and maternal health care­
utilization variables15-19 related to immunization were exam-
ined as confounders. Maternal age, education, race/ethnicity,
marital status, and first-trimester prenatal care were obtained
from the newborn questionnaire at enrollment. Home owner-
ship, the infant's health insurance and health status, house-
hold income, number of siblings, and maternal postpartum visit
were reported by parents in an interview at 2 to 4 months. House-
hold income was imputed for families with missing data (7%)
by using monthly housing costs and a series of covariates. An-
nual income was divided into earning tertiles: less than $20 000,
$20 000 to $49 999, and $50 000 or more.
The main measures of age-appropriate well-child care uti-
lization were the timely receipt of the 2-month visit and the
total number of age-appropriate well-child visits completed by
24 months, as defined by the American Academy of Pediatrics
schedule of preventive health care (Table 1).33 The receipt of
early age-appropriate care is strongly related to later up-to-
date immunization status.7 To control for age-appropriate well-

child care utilization in regression models of immunization and
satisfaction, we used the number of age-appropriate well-
child care visits received by the last date possible to receive the
immunization age appropriately. Because a visit within the first
month of life was nearly universal in our sample (97%), the
1-month age-appropriate well-child care visit was excluded from
the total count of age-appropriate well-child care visits.
Denominators for each vaccination and well-child care out-
come were determined by the children's time in practice--a mea-
sure combining the age at last visit with information provided
by parents at 30 to 33 months about their child's regular source
of care and when they left the practice, if the Healthy Steps site
was no longer their regular source. Time in practice refers to
the length of time in days that children were active patients at
the Healthy Steps site. Analyses of the age-appropriate vacci-
nation and well-child care­utilization outcomes included chil-
dren whose time in practice exceeded the oldest age allowable
to receive the dose or visit within the recommended age win-
dow. This resulted in analysis of children who could be con-
sidered patients of the practice throughout the period neces-
sary to receive the dose or visit.
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Bivariate associations between reported satisfaction and im-
munization outcomes; satisfaction and the aforementioned co-
variates; and immunization and the covariates were examined
with 2 test statistics. Multivariate regression models were per-
formed to explore the independent association between satis-
faction with care and each immunization outcome and media-
tion by age-appropriate well-child care utilization. Following
tests for mediation proposed by Baron and Kenny,34 we first
evaluated whether parental satisfaction with care was indepen-
dently related to the mediator of age-appropriate well-child care
utilization using logistic (2-month visit) and Poisson (total num-
ber of age-appropriate visits by 24 months) regression analy-
ses. We next examined the relationship between satisfaction
and immunization outcomes adjusting for associated sociode-
mographic and maternal health care­utilization variables (model
1). We then added the number of age-appropriate well-child
visits received (model 2) to evaluate mediation of the relation-
ship between satisfaction and immunization by examining the
coefficient change. All models controlled for the receipt of the
Healthy Steps intervention and the practice site. Fixed effects
were used to control for unobserved differences between sites.
Missing data did not exceed 3% for any variable. Two di-
chotomous variables were included in adjusted models to ac-
count for missing data: unknown prenatal care entry (3%) and
unknown for other covariates with less than 1% data missing
(2%). All analyses were conducted using SAS (SAS Institute Inc,
Cary, NC).
RESULTS
SAMPLE CHARACTERISTICS
Among study mothers, 13% were teenagers, 16% had not
completed high school, and 66% were married (Table 2).
Eighty percent of mothers initiated prenatal care in the
first trimester and almost 90% returned for a postpar-
tum visit. Similarly, 88% of infants received the 2-month
age-appropriate well-child visit.
Satisfaction with care was high. Two thirds of moth-
ers reported their infant's health care as excellent, 27%
as good, and only 4% as fair or poor (Table 2). Immu-
nization levels ranged from more than 90% for age-
appropriate initiation of the DTP series to 72% for
age-appropriate DTP3 and up-to-date vaccination levels

(4 DTP, 3 polio, and 1 MMR by 24 months) (Table 3).
The up-to-date vaccination level (4 DTP, 3 polio, and 1
MMR) in our sample is somewhat lower than the na-
tional estimate in 2000 (78%)35 because of our more strin-
gent inclusion of only valid doses administered accord-
ing to minimum age and interval guidelines.
STEP 1: BIVARIATE ASSOCIATIONS--
SATISFACTION, COVARIATES,
AND IMMUNIZATION
Mothers who reported less satisfaction with their in-
fant's health care were younger, unmarried, less edu-
cated, nonwhite, uninsured or Medicaid-insured, first-
time mothers, had lower incomes, and had reported their
infant's health status as fair/poor (Table 2). In addition,
mothers who were less satisfied with their infant's health
care were less likely to use health care for themselves and
their infant (Table 2). Children whose parents reported
fair/poor care averaged 2 fewer age-appropriate well-
child visits in the first 2 years of life than children whose
parents reported excellent care.
Satisfaction with care was associated with all immu-
nization measures examined, with much lower percent-
ages observed among children whose mothers reported
fair/poor care relative to those reporting good or excel-
lent care (Table 3). Only 58% of children whose parents
were dissatisfied with their children's health care were
up to date at 24 months compared with 73% among those
whose parents reported excellent care.

All covariates were significantly associated with each
immunization outcome in the anticipated direction at
P.05 (data available from authors upon request). Vari-
ables positively related to age-appropriate and up-to-
date immunization included older maternal age; higher
maternal education; higher income; home ownership;
white, non-Hispanic race/ethnicity; being married; pri-
vate insurance; first birth order; good or excellent in-
fant health status; receipt of first-trimester prenatal care;
maternal postpartum visit; 2-month well-child visit; and
the Healthy Steps intervention.
STEP 2: MEDIATOR AS OUTCOME--WELL-CHILD
CARE IN RELATION TO SATISFACTION
Parental satisfaction with care was related to age-
appropriate well-child care utilization independent of as-
sociated sociodemographic characteristics and mater-
nal health care utilization (Table 4). Compared with
children of parents who reported excellent satisfaction
with care, children of parents reporting fair/poor satis-
faction were significantly less likely to have obtained the
age-appropriate 2-month well-child visit and had sig-
nificantly fewer total age-appropriate visits by 24 months
of age. Children of parents who reported good satisfac-
tion with care were not significantly different from chil-
dren of parents reporting excellent satisfaction in their
receipt of age-appropriate well-child care.
STEP 3: MULTIVARIATE REGRESSION
MODELS--BEFORE AND AFTER ADJUSTMENT
FOR WELL-CHILD CARE
Adjusting for related sociodemographic characteristics and
maternal health care utilization, children whose parents
reported fair/poor care had markedly lower odds of hav-
ing received all immunization outcomes relative to chil-
dren whose mothers reported excellent care (odds ratios,
0.43-0.65) (Table 5, model 1). After adjusting for the total
number of age-appropriate well-child visits received, fair/
poor satisfaction with care was no longer significantly re-
lated to any of the immunization outcomes, indicating that
the effect of fair/poor satisfaction was mediated by re-
duced age-appropriate well-child care utilization.
COMMENT
The findings of this analysis suggest that early satisfac-
tion with care is independently related to both age-
appropriate and up-to-date immunization, despite asso-
ciations with a variety of sociodemographic risk factors,
reported infant health status, and maternal health care­

utilization patterns. The early nature of this effect is simi-
lar to that observed for age-appropriate DTP1 vaccina-
tion on later immunization7,36 and may be useful for the
early identification of children at greater risk of inad-
equate immunization. Infants of parents who were less
satisfied with their pediatric care at 2 to 4 months of age
had significantly lower odds of immunization for all vac-
cine outcomes examined through the first 2 years of life.
This relationship appeared to be mediated by reduced
well-child care utilization; parents who were less satis-
fied with their children's health care were less likely to
bring their children in for age-appropriate care. This find-
ing is consistent with results from the National Survey
of Early Childhood Health, which demonstrate a strong
negative relationship between parental global satisfac-
tion ratings and missed or delayed pediatric care.37
Dissatisfaction with care was strongly related to in-
adequate immunization; the population of dissatisfied par-
ents may warrant greater attention. Understanding the
sources of dissatisfaction and other barriers to utiliza-
tion of this subgroup is critical for targeted interven-
tions. Several studies, including our own, have shown
that parental global satisfaction is highly related to sat-
isfaction with physician communication skills (eg, lis-
tening and answering all questions) and the length of time
spent during well-child visits.37,38 As the level and sources
of dissatisfaction may vary according to provider and set-
ting, investigations should be context specific. A recent
survey of personnel at a variety of pediatric settings found
that the most common quality improvement initiative in-
volved efforts to increase patient satisfaction through base-
line surveys and tailored interventions.39 It is important
to note that only inclusion of the total number of age-
appropriate well-child visits received, rather than re-
ceipt of the 2-month age-appropriate well-child visit alone,
accounted for the relationship between satisfaction and
immunization outcomes (data not shown). This sug-
gests that interventions designed to improve the immu-
nization of children whose parents are dissatisfied with
their care must be sustained and not simply confined to
an early period of several months.
The significance of these findings is tempered by the
small percentage of parents who were dissatisfied with
their child's care. Although the high level of satisfaction
with children's health care is consistent with other re-
search,37,38,40-42 the Healthy Steps sites may not be repre-
sentative of all pediatric practices. The level of dissatis-
faction varied considerably among the sites, ranging
from 2% to 8%, suggesting that the relevance of quality
improvement initiatives and/or targeting dissatisfied
parents may be site specific. Broader efforts to improve
parent satisfaction may also enhance compliance with
medical regimens43 and reduce the risk of malpractice
litigation,44,45 in addition to improving preventive ser-
vices utilization.
There are several limitations to this study. While we
made considerable efforts to establish the temporal se-
quence between satisfaction and subsequent immuniza-
tion and to control for predisposing maternal health care­
seeking behavior, it is possible that the observed
association is the result of other factors related to both
satisfaction appraisal and health care utilization. How-
ever, the magnitude of the association amidst a range of
control variables highly associated with both satisfac-
tion and immunization reduces the likelihood of this pos-
sibility. Regardless of causality, parental dissatisfaction
with care identifies a group of children significantly less
likely to receive age-appropriate preventive care who war-
rant greater attention and targeted intervention.
The inability to directly compare the level of satisfac-
tion in our sample with others highlights another study
limitation. Our global measure of satisfaction is similar to
thequestionsusedbyConsumerAssessmentofHealthPlan
SatisfactionandNationalSurveyofEarlyChildhoodHealth
but has a more restricted response range--from 1 to 4, as
opposed to from 0 to 10. The magnitude of the effect of
fair/poorsatisfactionwithcareinrelationtoup-to-datevac-
cination levels (4 DTP, 3 polio, and 1 MMR by 24 months),
however, is similar to the effect of less satisfaction ob-
served by Bates and Wolinsky,12 supporting the reliabil-
ity of our results. We also examined other, more specific
measures of satisfaction with care, including scales of
satisfaction with provider listening, time, help, and ad-
vice, but the global measure of satisfaction was more
strongly and consistently related to immunization. Thus,
use of a global measure of satisfaction with care may be
efficient and helpful in identifying children who are less
likely to receive preventive services.
CONCLUSIONS
The results of this study show that parents' satisfaction
with their child's health care at an early age is related to
the child's later immunization, independent of sociode-
mographic characteristics, infant health status, and pat-
terns of maternal health care utilization. The associa-
tion between fair/poor satisfaction with care and reduced
receipt of timely and up-to-date immunization ap-
peared to be mediated by reduced utilization of age-
appropriate well-child care. Although dissatisfaction was
relatively uncommon among parents in this study, fu-
ture research might determine whether other widely used
measures of satisfaction yield greater variability and pre-
dictive value in relation to immunization. Our global mea-
sure of satisfaction was more strongly related to immu-
nization than other measures of satisfaction and is
conducive to rapid assessment at clinical sites. Parental
satisfaction is frequently measured by providers in some
form for quality assessment and may have unantici-
pated value in identifying children who are less likely to
receive age-appropriate preventive care.
