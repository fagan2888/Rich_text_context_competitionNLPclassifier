Abstract
Objective: This study aimed to assess the possible association of high breast milk sodium levels
with postpartum depression and anxiety.
Methods: A total of 150 mothers and their healthy, exclusively breastfed newborns aged 8 to 15
days were recruited. Mothers were asked to complete scales for evaluation of postnatal depression
and anxiety following an interview for consent and sociodemographic data collection. Breast milk
samples were obtained to measure sodium and potassium (K) levels.
Results: Forty-nine mothers had higher than expected breast milk Na concentrations and a high
Na/K ratio. These mothers scored significantly higher on the scales of postnatal depression and
state anxiety (P ¼ 0.018 and P ¼ 0.048, respectively).
Conclusions: This study shows that compared to normal breast milk Na levels and Na/K ratio,
high breast milk Na and high Na/K ratio, with possible serious consequences in infants, are
associated with maternal depressive and anxious symptoms in the postpartum period.

Introduction
Postnatal maternal psychiatric morbidities,
such as postpartum depression, have major
consequences for the woman, her child, and
the family. Important caregiving activities,
such as breastfeeding, sleep, adherence to
well-child visit, and vaccine schedules, can
be compromised in depressed mothers.
Maternal depression also influences attach-
ment and bonding of the newborn, and can
affect the child's development, leading to
cognitive, social, emotional, and behav-
ioural problems that last into adolescence.1
Breastfeeding is one of the first relation-
ships between the mother and newborn.
Therefore, effects of postnatal depression
on breastfeeding practices have received
increasing interest in the last decade. Most
of the research regarding this topic has
focussed on the association of initiation
and duration of breastfeeding with postpar-
tum depression, providing evidence for
adverse effects of postpartum depression
on breastfeeding practices.2,3 Besides con-
tinuity of breastfeeding, few studies have
investigated any association between mater-
nal depressive and anxious feelings and
breast milk content in the postnatal
period.4,5 Following recognition of breast-
feeding being associated with hypernatre-
mia, a potential life-threatening condition
for infants, the association of maternal
adverse psychosocial characteristics and
high breast milk Na concentrations has
started to be examined.6 Previous maternal
psychiatric morbidity, postnatal state anx-
iety, the perception of having a poor rela-
tionship with their mother, and the belief of
being unsuitable to be a mother have been
suggested to be more common in women
who had higher than expected Na concen-
trations in their breast milk compared with
controls.4 Additionally, Flores-Quijano
et al. showed that high breast milk Na
concentrations of exclusively breastfed
mothers were associated with maternal
feelings that their milk was insufficient for
their newborns.5 They indicated a margin-
ally significant relationship between mater-
nal depression and mammary gland
permeability as shown by the Na/K ratio in
breast milk. This ratio is expected to rapidly
decrease, starting from postpartum day 3,
and keep decreasing until the 6th month if
breast feeding is continued. The Na/K ratio
is an indicator of successful breastfeeding in
the first postpartum week.5,7
Early detection of failure of breastfeeding
in depressed and anxious mothers in the
postpartum period may have clinical impli-
cations for the newborn's growth.
Therefore, the present study aimed to inves-
tigate the association of breast milk Na
levels and the Na/K ratio with postnatal
depression and anxiety in a sample of
mothers who exclusively breastfed their
newborns.
Materials and methods
This study was approved by the Dokuz
Eylul University Medical Sciences
Research Ethics Committee. Informed writ-
ten consents were obtained from all of the
participants.
Patients
The sample consisted of mothers of 150
exclusively breastfed healthy newborns, who
weighed 2500­4000 g at birth and were born
at 38­42 weeks' gestation. The mothers were
consecutively admitted to the well-baby unit
of the Pediatrics Department of Dokuz
Eylul University Faculty of Medicine and
Tepecik State Hospital for routine monitor-
ing at 8­15 days postpartum.
Mothers who were recruited had no breast
problems, such as an engorged or wounded
breast or mastitis, which account for failure
of lactation. Exclusive breastfeeding was
defined as mothers not offering anything,
including water, other than breast milk.

Measures
Sociodemographic data regarding mothers
and their newborns were collected by a semi-
structured interview. Postnatal maternal
anxiety and depression were assessed using
the self-report State and Trait Anxiety
Inventories (STAI-I and STAI-II) and the
Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale
(EPDS), respectively.8,9 Higher scores indi-
cated higher anxiety and depression levels
depending on the instrument used. All three
instruments have been shown to be valid and
reliable for the Turkish population.10,11
Additionally, mothers were also asked
whether they had received any psychiatric
treatment.
Breast milk sampling
A volume of 10 ml of milk was obtained by
manual milking of either breast. Sodium
levels are not affected by the mother's diet,
the method that milk is obtained (manually
or by electric pump), being collected from
either breast, or being obtained prior or
following breastfeeding.12
The milk sample was centrifuged at
3000 rpm for 10 minutes to separate the
serum in which Na and K are present.
Samples were stored atÀ20C until analysis.
Biochemical analysis of the breast milk
samples was performed using a Cobas 6000
analyzer (Roche Diagnostics) via an indirect
method with an ion selective electrode.
Breast milk Na concentrations greater than
18 mmol/L and Na/K ratios greater than 1.0
were considered as high in accordance with
relevant literature.12,13,14
Data analysis
Data were analysed using SPSS version 15
(SPSS Inc. 2006).15 Descriptive statistics,
including means, standard deviations, and
percentages, were calculated for sociodemo-
graphic variables. Bivariate analyses were
performed to assess the association between
variables using Spearman's correlation.
Chi-square and t-tests were used to evaluate
the potential group differences for categor-
ical and continuous variables, respectively.
A P value < 0.05 was considered as
significant.
Results
Mothers who participated in the study were
aged between 17 and 41 years (mean age,
28.6 years; SD, 5.2). None of the mothers
were taking any psychotropic medication or
receiving any psychiatric treatment.
Newborns were aged 8­15 days (mean,
10.4 days; SD, 2.5) with a birth weight of
2500­4000 g (mean, 3304.6 g; SD, 363.7).
Additional sociodemographic data regard-
ing mothers and newborns are shown in
Table 1.
High Na levels (> 18 mmol/L) and a high
Na/K ratio (> 1.0) were present in 49
(32.7%) of 150 milk samples. Newborns of
mothers who had high breast milk Na levels
and a high Na/K ratio were significantly
more likely to be the first child of the family
(P ¼ 0.021 for Na, P ¼ 0.013 for Na/K)
(Table 1).
Mothers with high breast milk Na levels
had significantly higher mean STAI-I scores
than did mothers without high breast milk
Na levels (P ¼ 0.048). Mothers with high
Na/K ratio also had higher STAI-I scores
but this was not significant compared to
mothers with normal Na/K ratio
(P ¼ 0.063). No significant difference in the
STAI-II score was observed (Table 2).
Mean EPDS scores of mothers with high
breast milk Na levels and a high Na/K ratio
were significantly higher than those without
high breast milk Na levels and without a
high Na/K ratio (P ¼ 0.018 for Na;
P ¼ 0.047 for Na/K) (Table 2). Correlation
analysis showed a significant correlation
between mean Na levels and the mean
EPDS score (r ¼ 0.217, P ¼ 0.008).

Discussion
In this study, we aimed to investigate the
associations of breast milk Na levels and the
Na/K ratio with postnatal depression and
anxiety. Although a direct causal relation-
ship is controversial, we showed that high
breast milk Na levels and the Na/K ratio
were associated with high postnatal depres-
sion and anxiety scores.
There have been few studies regarding the
association of postnatal maternal psychi-
atric morbidity and breast milk content.
Flores-Quijano et al. compared breastfeed-
ing practices in postnatally depressed and
non-depressed mothers.5 They suggested

that depressed women had a marginally
high breast milk Na/K ratio in their breast
milk. Additionally, they found that high
EPDS scores were compatible with
mothers not feeling confident about breast-
feeding.5 In our study, we compared mothers
with high and expected levels of Na in their
breast milk and found that mothers had
significantly higher scores of postnatal
depression when they had high breast milk
Na levels. Furthermore, these mothers also
had significantly higher state anxiety scores
than those without high breast milk Na
levels. Our results appear to support those
by Flores-Quijano et al.'s indicating that
postpartum depression has adverse effects on
breast milk content and that state anxiety
may be another psychiatric morbidity related
to high Na levels in breast milk.
In our sample, nearly one third of the
mothers had high Na levels in their breast
milk, which is a similar finding to that by
Flores-Quijano et al.5 This finding also
indicates that approximately one third of
newborns may be feeding on breast milk
with high Na levels. Blood Na concentra-
tions > 150 mmol/L are a potentially lethal
condition for neonates.6
A potential explanation for the physio-
pathology of this condition is as follows.
Mothers who cannot hold their newborn on
their breast long enough to allow proper
ductal evacuation might have increased
mammary gland permeability. This condi-
tion is thought to be related to incomplete
closure of the close connections between
mammary gland epithelial cells that have
not been sufficiently evacuated, causing an
increased passage of Na from plasma to
milk.4,5,13,14 This hypothesis still needs to be
tested by further studies measuring the time
spent at the breast.
Our study also showed that birth order
(i.e., being the first child) may be another
risk factor associated with high breast milk
Na concentrations. This finding might be
related to the breastfeeding experience,
which has been suggested to affect successful
lactation.6,16
There are several limitations to our study.
These limitations include reporting bias
because a lot of the data were based on
maternal reports and questionnaires.
Although several studies have suggested
using the STAI and EPDS to determine
anxiety and postpartum depression,8,9,17,18
clinical assessment is necessary for diagnosis
of postnatal depression and anxiety.
Additionally, the data were obtained from
a limited population. An extended epi-
demiological study that assesses the associ-
ation between breast milk Na levels and
maternal emotional factors is necessary.
Despite its limitations, to the best of our
knowledge, our study is the first to assess the
association of high levels of breastmilk Na,
which is an indicator of lactation failure,
with postnatal maternal anxiety and depres-
sive scores of mothers of babies without
hypernatremic dehydration. Further
research is required to determine whether
breast milk Na levels improve with psychi-
atric treatment of postnatal depression and
anxiety. This could lead to other studies for
implementation of breast milk Na measure-
ments in clinical practice as a screening tool
to detect adverse effects of postnatal depres-
sion and anxiety on feeding of newborns.
