Abstract. The mirror reversal of an image is subtly different from the original. Often such change
goes unnoticed in pictures, although it can affect preference. For the first time we studied the effect of
mirror reversal of feature films. People watched Yojimbo or Sanjuro in a cinema, both classic films by
Akira Kurosawa. They knew that this was a study and filled out a questionnaire. On one day Yojimbo
was shown in its original orientation, and on another day the film was mirror reversed. Sanjuro was
shown reversed on one day and non-reversed on another day. Viewers did not notice the reversal,
even when they had seen the film before and considered themselves fans of Kurosawa. We compared
this with estimates from a survey. In addition, the question about the use of space (scenography)
revealed that although people who had seen the film before gave higher ratings compared with those
who had not, this was only true when the film was not reversed.
Keywords: aesthetics, visual art, composition, film, laterality.
1 Introduction
In the opening scene of Yojimbo (1961), a samurai arrives at a fork in the road and throws
a stick in the air. The stick points to the right, and the samurai follows the road to a village.
Here the story begins. We will never know where he would have arrived if the stick had sent
him to the left. But what we can test is how different the film would have been if keeping
everything else the same, the stick had pointed to the left and the samurai had walked to
the left to a similar but mirror-reversed village. In other words, an entire film can be shown
with a left-right reversal of the images. This is what we did in our study, and afterwards asked
viewers a series of questions on their experience. By doing this we tested (i) how often people
reported that the film was reversed and also (ii) whether the judgments on the quality of the
film, acting, and scenography were different for the participants that saw the original or the
reversed versions.
2 Composition and scenography
In the study of the visual arts, composition and balance are important themes (recent studies
of balance include McManus et al 2011 and Gershoni and Hochstein 2011). For instance,
Oppé (1944) claimed that Raphael's cartoons changed in meaning as the drawings were
turned into tapestries (and mirror reversed in the process). One possibility is that people
have a specific way of scanning a picture, and as a consequence, they prefer images in
which movement proceeds from left to right (Gaffron 1950). Empirical research on aesthetic
judgments of pictures has identified some asymmetrical biases: there is a preference for
having more salient content on the right side (Levy 1976; Beaumont 1985), for directional

cues pointing from left to right (Mead and McLaughlin 1992), for light coming from the left
(Mamassian 2008), for portraits (especially of females) to show the left cheek rather than the
right cheek (McManus and Humphrey 1973; Schirillo 2000), and for more space present in
front (anterior) as opposed to behind when objects have a facing direction (Palmer et al 2008;
Bertamini et al 2011). All but the last of these aspects of an image are affected by a left-right
reversal.
The aesthetic criteria for a film may differ from those used to assess a painting (Cutting
2002; Cutting et al 2011). In Arnheim's words: "Film almost never deals with non-moving
pictures as do painting and photography, and thus we cannot speak here strictly of the
composition of a static image" (1997, page 86). However, Arnheim goes on to argue that
composition is part of a broader set of spatial aspects of a film. For dynamic images,
composition in this broad sense is likely to be even more important than in paintings,
and we will use the term scenography to refer to spatial composition as well as the set,
costume, and lighting. Although usage of this term differs amongst authors, our use is in
line with the following definitions of scenography: "the manipulation and orchestration of
the performance environment. The means by which this is pursued are typically through
architectonic structures, light, projected images, sound, costume and performance objects
or props" (McKinney and Butterworth 2009, page 4) and "the creation of the stage space"
(Howard 2002, page xix).
The left-right reversal manipulation changes some aspects of spatial layout while leaving
others intact. Persons and objects relocate to the opposite side of the image, and any
horizontal motion is in the opposite direction. The way that clothes are folded and swords are
carried also changes. A kimono, for example, is always worn with the left side overlapping the
right side (the reverse is used to dress a corpse for burial). Light that used to come from one
side is now coming from the other. Any right-handed actor becomes left-handed and vice
versa. Finally, many emotions are expressed by actors during a film, and facial expressions
are also known to be asymmetrical (Sackheim and Gur 1978), and more so for deliberate
facial actions (Ekman et al 1981). Any of these factors could be noticed by an observer, but
even when they are not noticed, they could also contribute to a change in the evaluation of a
film overall, or more specifically in relation to an evaluation of scenography (defined in our
question as the use of space, set, costume, and lighting).
3 The films
Akira Kurosawa (1910­98) is frequently cited as one of the greatest directors of all time. He is
also widely acknowledged as an influence on other directors, from Sergio Leone to George
Lucas (both of whom used themes from Kurosawa's films in their own productions [Galbraith
2002; Richie 1999]). A perfectionist, he worked passionately on every aspect of the filmmaking
process. He used multiple cameras and was particularly admired for his skills as an editor
(Richie 1999). Images from Kurosawa's films are powerful and memorable.
Yojimbo (1961) is set in 1860's Japan. The main character is a ronin (a masterless samurai)
played by the actor Toshir¯
o Mifune. Some themes, such as the taciturn samurai, inspired
later western films (eg, the nameless hero). Sanjuro (1962) is a sequel to Yojimbo in which we
meet again the same protagonist, although the film is lighter in tone (see Figure 1). Both were
filmed in black and white and have never been dubbed into English. In our study they were
screened in the original Japanese with English subtitles. A few seconds (less than a minute) at
the beginning of each film and at the end were omitted to avoid any words using the Roman
alphabet (but titles and credits in Japanese were preserved). The running times for Yojimbo
and Sanjuro are 110 minutes and 96 minutes, respectively.

We chose Kurosawa not only because he is highly admired as a director but also because
in these films there are no cars and no Roman alphabet writing. We wanted to avoid the
special case of detection of inversion for text and focus instead on the change in handedness
and in composition of the visual images.
Figure 1. The original posters for the films Yojimbo (left) and Sanjuro (right). In the Sanjuro poster
Mifune is holding his sword with his left hand. Possibly the image was reversed to fit the composition
of the poster, but we could find no information on this (and therefore it may be that this has gone
unnoticed before).
4 Familiarity
It is well known that having been exposed to a stimulus may affect responses to it at a
later time. There is a large literature on implicit learning or learning without awareness
(eg, Seger 1994). Importantly for aesthetics, prior exposure also affects preference and
affective responses, a phenomenon known as "mere exposure" (Zajonc 1968; 1980). Mere
exposure has been studied in relation to actual works of art (eg, Berlyne 1970). Cutting
(2003; 2007) discussed the application of the idea of mere exposure to the formation and
maintenance of artistic canons and provided evidence to support this view in the case of
French Impressionism.
If exposure is critical for the evaluation of a film, then viewers that have seen the film
before may behave differently from viewers that have not seen the film. Unlike a laboratory
study, we cannot randomly assign people to the two groups. Moreover, what people may be
unaware of is not which film they have seen in the past but the specific details of the film. If
so, it is possible that people who remember having seen the film before may not notice that
the film is now different (mirror reversed) and yet evaluate the film differently than those
who see the film in the original orientation (because only the latter are being exposed to the
same film again).

5 Expectations about how easy it is to notice a left-handed world
In addition to the study of the experience of watching a left-right reversed film, we wanted to
know what intuitive beliefs people have about how easy it is to detect a left-right reversal.
To do this, we used a simple questionnaire with three different scenarios. One group of
participants (N = 35) was asked whether it would be easy or difficult to notice that the world
has been left-right reversed. Another scenario described a museum in which all paintings
have been mirror reversed (N = 35), and a third described a film (N = 35). The wordings of
the questions are presented inside the graphs of Figure 2. For instance the question about
the film was: "Imagine that you went to see a new film, and in the film the entire world has
been changed into its mirror-reversed version. Most things would be the same except that
most people in the film would now use their left-hand to eat, shake hands, point, and so on.
How long do you think it would take for you to notice?"(1) Participants circled one of three
answers: "Immediately", "Some time", "Never". If they answered "Some time," they were
then asked how long. This first question was followed by a second question: "Now, please
answer the same question but this time the film is a film that you had seen before in the
non-reversed version. How long do you think it would take for you to notice?" This follow-up
question was included only for the film and the museum scenarios, as the world cannot be
unfamiliar.
The 105 participants were students from several classes at the University of Liverpool,
including some with mature students. The majority were females (86), and the mean age
was 24 years. Figure 2 shows the percentage of responses in each category. The "some time"
category has been split into "less than an hour" and "more than an hour" on the basis of the
specific predictions made by the participants.
In all cases a majority of respondents predicted that they would notice the reversal
immediately or that it would take them less than an hour to notice it (world, 63%; museum,
63%; film, 63%). This majority increased when they were asked to assume that the paintings
in the museum or the film were familiar to them (museum, 100%; film, 74%). We are not
going to speculate about the differences between the three scenarios, as they may require
further research. Our purpose was simply to see whether people's intuition was that this task
was easy or hard. We can conclude from the data that the task is judged to be non-trivial
(overall "immediately" responses were 27%) and that a few minutes may be necessary to
notice the change, but this task is not impossible (overall "never" responses were 16%).
6 Left-right reversal
This study is the first investigation of the experience of watching a film after a manipulation
that reverses the left-right orientation of the image. The first empirical question to answer is
whether the spectators will notice the mainly left-handed world of the story, and whether
having seen the film before, would increase the detection of the change. If the outcome were
to match the expectations, based on the data presented above, a majority of people will
detect the reversal, and this majority will be larger in the case of people who had seen the
film before.
The sample in our study was made up of people who came to a free screening in a cinema
located in the centre of Liverpool, UK. This sample was completely different from the sample
who answered questions about how long it would take to notice a reversal (see section on
expectations). Participants knew that in exchange for free entrance they had to fill out a
(1)The question mentioned the change of handedness for clarity, but we also replicated this pattern of
expectations from an additional sample of 35 people for whom the question was shorter and did not
mention handedness.

questionnaire at the end, and they knew that this was part of a study. The questionnaire was
designed to collect information about how much they liked the film overall and specifically
about the acting and the scenography. It also asked the level of engagement with the story,
and space was provided for people to make comments on anything they had noticed about
the film. We collected information about sex, age, level of education, where they were sitting
in the theatre, whether and when they had seen the film before, and whether they considered
themselves fans of Kurosawa. Given the importance of previous exposure for aesthetics (eg,
Cutting 2003), the difference between people who had seen the film before and those who
did not is particularly important.
We predicted that many people would not notice the reversal manipulation. This
prediction was based on the fact that mirror images of objects have similar perceptual
effects (eg, Biederman and Cooper 1991) and that people do not easily distinguish an original
painting from its reversed image (Gordon and Gardner 1974; Bennett et al 2010), although
they do better when the paintings are highly familiar (Blount et al 1975). However, our study
was different from anything done before, and it is essential to measure the actual frequency
of detection. In addition, judgments about the film's quality may depend on the reversal
despite the lack of awareness of the manipulation. In particular, we were interested in the
question about scenography.
7 Method
7.1 Design
There were four screenings for four groups of observers. On Monday Yojimbo was shown in
the original orientation (N = 43) and Sanjuro was shown reversed (N = 36), and on Wednesday
Yojimbo was shown reversed (N = 50) and Sanjuro was shown in the original orientation (N =
43). Yojimbo was always screened at 3:00 PM and Sanjuro at 6:30 PM. This choice meant that
time of day was confounded with film, but orientation and film as well as orientation and
time of day were balanced.
7.2 Participants
Ninety-three people watched Yojimbo, and seventy-nine watched Sanjuro. The majority were
males (66%), and age ranged from 16 to 74 with a mode of 20. Highest level of education was
varied, but a large proportion had a university degree (46%) or a doctorate (26%). A minority
(19%) had seen the film before, but almost half of the participants (47%) answered yes to a
question about whether they considered themselves a fan of Kurosawa.
7.3 Stimuli and procedure
The cinema was located within the Foundation for Art and Creative Technology, a complex
that includes three cinema screens as well as art galleries. The theatre was small (10 m x 10
m) and had a capacity of 50 people. The screen was 8 m wide. The image was of DVD quality,
and the projector was a Christy Digital CP2000. Participants were permitted to choose a seat
and were asked to complete the questionnaire after the film was shown.
Participants had to choose a value between 1 (terrible) and 9 (wonderful) on the following
four items: "Overall the movie was", "The quality of the acting was", "The quality of the
scenography (use of space, set, costume, lighting, etc) was", and "The performance of Toshiro
Mifune (main character) was". The fifth question was about level of engagement, and the
scale went from 1 (indifferent) to 9 (engaged). There was also an open question at the bottom
of the page: "A final open question: Is there anything else in particular you would like to tell
us about the movie that you have just seen?"

8 Results
8.1 Detection of reversal
Approximately half of the viewers (49%) wrote comments on the questionnaire in addition to
answering the questions, and many others talked with the experimenter after the screening.
Only two individuals wrote in their comments that they had noticed that the film was
mirror reversed. One of them could speak Japanese and therefore reported that the Japanese
characters were reversed. This puzzled her, but her comments were only relative to the text,
not the film itself. Only one person therefore genuinely detected the manipulation in the
film. This person was a fan of Kurosawa who had not only seen the film but seen it repeatedly.
She was also in contact with the family of Toshir¯
o Mifune and carried with her a signed
photograph and a small container with some of his ashes. We excluded both individuals from
the subsequent analyses.
The almost total lack of detection of the reversal is remarkable. Except for the one
individual mentioned above, none of the people who had seen the film before or that
classified themselves as fans of Kurosawa detected that they were watching a film that
was different from what they had seen before; nor did they detect the fact that they were
watching a world populated mainly by left-handed people.
Next we consider the four separate aspects of the film that viewers judged. Given that we
had only four screenings in total, reversal, film, and day of the week could not be completely
crossed in the design. In all the analyses reported we included reversal (original or reversed)
and film (Yojimbo or Sanjuro) as factors, but analyses performed with reversal and day of
the week as factors produced exactly the same pattern of significant results. Mean scores are
shown in Figure 3.
Figure 3. Mean rating values on the questionnaire items as a function of whether viewers had seen the
film before. Errors bars are 1 SEM.
8.2 Overall impression of the film
The first question was about the overall rating of the film. Perhaps unsurprisingly ratings
were, in general, high. The mean was 7.32 on a 9-point Likert scale.
Kurosawa 535
We performed an ANOVA with the following factors: Film (Yojimbo or Sanjuro), Reversal
(original or reversed), Exposure (the group who had seen the film before and the group who
had not), and Sex. The only significant effect was exposure: people who had seen the film
before gave higher scores (F(1,148) = 10.63, p = .001).
This effect is likely to be a selection phenomenon: all but one of those who had seen the
film before claimed also to be fans of Kurosawa. It is also possible that in addition to the
selection issue, there was an effect of previous exposure. To test that possibility, we selected
the subset of people who were fans (N = 80). Within this group only 30 (37%) had seen the
film, and we compared the fans that had seen the film before with the fans that had not. We
reasoned that for a fan of Kurosawa seeing a film that they had not yet seen should be a treat
and therefore they should give higher scores (and nobody in either group was disappointed
given the high scores). Conversely, if seeing a film that one has seen before is the important
factor, then the previously exposed group should have the higher score. The latter was the
case (t(77.66) = 4.51, p < .001), supporting the idea that previous exposure is a contributing
factor.
8.3 Acting
There were two questions about acting, one about the whole film ("The quality of the acting")
and one about Mifune ("The performance of Toshiro Mifune"); the means were 7.04 and
8.02, respectively. The latter value is the highest mean for all questions and is close to ceiling
on the 9-point scale.
We performed a mixed ANOVA with the following factors: Question (overall or Mifune),
Film (Yojumbo or Sanjuro), Reversal (original or reversed), Exposure (the group who had seen
the film before and the group who had not), and Sex. There was a difference between the two
questions (F(1,148) = 28.18, p < .001), an effect of Exposure (F(1,148) = 6.90, p = .010), and an
interaction between the two (F(1,148) = 9.52, p = .002). Despite the interaction, the trend for
exposure was in the same direction for both questions (higher values from people who had
seen the film before). Therefore, the results relative to acting show something similar to the
results on overall impression of the film.
8.4 Scenography
As discussed in the introduction, because of the existing literature on effects of spatial
composition for paintings, this was the question we were most interested in. We performed an
ANOVA with the following factors: Film (Yojimbo or Sanjuro), Reversal (original or reversed),
Exposure (the group who had seen the film before and the group who had not), and Sex.
There were no significant main effects, but there was an interaction between Reversal and
Exposure (F(1,148) = 4.27, p = .040). This interaction is illustrated in Figure 4.
As we have seen in the analysis of the overall quality of the film and the acting, viewers who
have seen the film before tend to rate the film higher. However, in the case of scenography
those who had seen the film before gave a higher rating only to the original version, the effect
of previous exposure was absent for the reversed version (Figure 4).
To find further support for a role of previous exposure, we reasoned that any effect of
exposure should weaken over a long period of time. We used the information about when the
film had been seen and used the median to split the previously exposed group into two new
groups: those who had seen the film within the last 5 years and those who had seen the film
more than 5 years ago. Overall, the means for the two groups did not differ (t(20.94) = -1.83,
ns). Interestingly, the effect of exposure was present for the first group (t(13.87) = 2.45, p
= .028) but not the second (t(12.61) = 0.19, ns), supporting the idea that (recent) previous
exposure is linked with higher ratings for the original version, even though none of these
viewers detected the reversal.

8.5 Engagement
We performed an ANOVA with the following factors: Film (Yojimbo or Sanjuro), Reversal
(original or reversed), Exposure (the group who had seen the film before and the group who
did not), and Sex. There were no significant main effects or interactions.
9 Seating
It is interesting to analyse briefly the information about where in the cinema people were
sitting. One may expect that higher ratings would be associated with sitting near the centre,
and therefore more in line with the projector. We coded the five aisles from -2 on the right
(near the entrance) to 2 on the left and plotted mean scores as a function of aisles. These plots
displayed a symmetrical distribution with a peak near the centre. We performed an ANOVA
for each of the questions and looked for evidence of a quadratic trend. For the questions
about acting and scenography the quadratic term was significant (F(1,163) = 6.69, p = .022,
F(1,163) = 15.18, p = .004, respectively) and there was a similar trend for the question on
the overall impression of the film (F(1,163) = 4.41, p = .059). Because people could choose
their seats in the theatre, there are two possible explanations for the higher scores near the
centre. The first is that people who are more interested in the film sit in the middle, and the
second is that people who sit in the middle have a better experience. We cannot separate
these two in our study, but what is important is to check that location in the theatre was
not confounded with previous exposure. If it were the case that people who had seen the
film before tend to sit in the centre of the theatre, then the fact that they give higher scores
may not necessarily depend on previous exposure but simply on where they were sitting.
Therefore, we compared the location (as coded in terms of aisles) for the two groups (those
who had seen the film before and those who had not). There was no significant difference
between the two groups in terms of location to the left or the right (t(166) =-0.34, ns) or in
Kurosawa 537
terms of eccentricity (aisles were recoded for eccentricity by removing the sign) (t(166) =
-0.61, ns). Therefore, the higher ratings from people who had seen the film before, which
was discussed earlier, are unlikely to be an indirect consequence of where the viewers were
sitting.
10 Replication with short clips
We conducted a study in Italy to replicate and extend the basic finding. We selected two
5 min clips from Yojimbo (A and B) that were similar in content (they both begun with an
interior scene, relatively rich in dialogue, and ended with a combat scene, rich in action). We
recruited four groups of 120 students each from four undergraduate courses at the University
of Parma. One group saw clip A (original orientation), then clip B (reversed); one saw clip A
(reversed), then clip B (original); one saw clip B (original), then clip A (reversed); and one saw
clip B (reversed), then clip A (original). Afterwards, participants were required to compare
the two clips. Specifically, a questionnaire asked them to rate how much they preferred the
scenography of the second clip over the first using a nine point scale. They were also given
an open question as in the Liverpool study. One interesting aspect of this study was the
absence of subtitles. In the Liverpool study participants may have paid less attention to the
images if they concentrated on reading them. In this control study we used the Japanese
soundtrack with no subtitles. Consistent with the earlier study, none of the participants
reported noticing that one clip was reversed. With respect to the role of familiarity, out of 480
participants, only 2 reported having seen the film before. For this reason, a comparison with
the main study is impossible, although, interestingly, these two students reported preferring
the scenography of the original version over that of the reversed one. An ANOVA with factors
Clip (A or B), Version (original or reversed), and Sex revealed an overall preference for clip A
over B (F(1,433) = 11.25, p = .001), but no effect of version. It is interesting that even when
two clips were compared directly against each other's, the reversal was not noticed.
11 Discussion
Our study revealed unequivocally that it is possible to watch a film mirror reversed without
noticing the reversal, and with similar levels of engagement. One person noticed the reversal
of the Japanese characters, and one noticed the reversal in the images, but everybody else
failed to report the reversal. On the one hand, it is true that we did not ask explicitly whether
the images were reversed, and therefore cannot claim that people would have been at chance
once asked. On the other hand, participants knew that they were part of a study and knew that
the event was organised by researchers from the University of Liverpool, and they were on
average highly educated. Both Yojimbo and Sanjuro lasted more than 1.5 hours, and during
this time viewers watched a world of left-handed people without detecting that this was
unusual. In addition to the change in handedness, a few other aspects of the modified images
might have looked wrong, specifically the asymmetry in facial expressions, the folding of the
clothes, how swords were carried, and the direction of lighting and movement, as discussed
in the introduction. These are all subtle changes but together they add to a considerable
amount of information. In a similar study in Italy two clips were directly compared (one of
them reversed), and even this direct comparison did not lead to detection of the reversal.
This lack of detection may be related to the fact that when viewing a film, the viewer is
engaged with a story, and that such a story is unaffected by mirror reversal. A separate group
of people judged how quickly they would notice a left-right reversal of the world, pictures in
a museum, or a film. A majority predicted that it would take less than an hour to notice the
reversal in each of the three scenarios. In the case of a film this expectation was not matched
by people's actual performance in our study.
538 M Bertamini, C Bode, N Bruno
Almost one participant in five had seen the film before, and almost half (47%) declared
themselves fans of Kurosawa. Nevertheless, with the exception of one individual, having seen
the film before or being familiar with the work of Kurosawa did not make it easier for the
viewer to notice that the film was different. For instance, even though Mifune is a famous
actor and many viewers would have been familiar with his roles in many of Kurosawa's films,
it did not matter whether he was right handed (original version) or left handed (reversed
version).
The choice of films by Kurosawa allowed us to test films from a famous and highly admired
director, but it also had the advantage that the setting in 19th-century Japan meant that there
were no cars and no Roman alphabet writing in the images. Detection of inversion for words
is a special case, and we consciously designed our study to avoid this aspect. Instead we were
interested in reversal of the image, and therefore the change in composition. This aspect was
targeted specifically by the question on scenography.
The ratings of the quality of the scenography (defined as the use of space, set, costume,
and lighting) for the original version or reversed version differed as a function of previous
experience; only the viewers who had seen the film before rated the original more highly
than they did the reversed. The phenomenon of mere exposure (Zajonc 1968) can help to
interpret this finding. It is known that observers prefer stimuli that they have seen before even
though they do not remember them (eg, Seamon et al 1995; Johnson et al 1985). However, our
situation is different and unique. Participants did remember having seen the film; what they
did not remember was the orientation of the images. We found that people who had seen
the film before reported liking the scenography more than people who had not seen the film
before, but only when the film was shown in the original orientation (even though they did
not consciously recognise that the reversed version was different). We interpret this finding
as evidence of a composition-specific exposure effect. This interpretation is supported by
the fact that the preference for the original version in people who had seen the film before
was specific to people who had seen the film relatively recently (in the past 5 years). However,
given the limited sample size of the subgroup of observers who had seen the film before, this
issue does need further research.
Studying the experience of watching a film in a cinema is challenging but rewarding.
People who come to a cinema are a sample from a population of people with an interest in
films (and specifically with an interest in the works of Kurosawa in our case) and therefore
more diverse than participants recruited within the university community. Finally, questions
about the role of asymmetric biases in visual art as well as questions about the role of previous
exposure can be tackled, and our study is hopefully the first of many.

Marco Bertamini studied psychology at the University of Padova, Italy, and then at the
University of Virginia, USA. He moved to Liverpool in 1999 where he established the Visual
Perception Lab. His interests are broad across visual perception and cognition. For more
information visit http://www.liv.ac.uk/VP.
Carole Bode, prior to studying psychology at undergraduate level at the University of
Liverpool, qualified (and still works) as a painter and illustrator. She is currently in the
first year of her PhD (supervised by Marco Bertamini), which examines the effects of
composition on expressiveness in visual art and viewer engagement.
Nicola Bruno studied philosophy at the University of Trieste, Italy, and experimental
psychology at Cornell University. He returned to Trieste in 1992 where he became full
professor of General Psychology in 2000. In 2009 he moved to the University of Parma
where he is setting up a Multisensory Perception and Action Lab. He has published broadly
on perception, perception and action, and multisensory processes. For more information
