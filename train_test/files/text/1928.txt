OBJECTIVE--The objective of this study was to examine the risk factors of low/mid-
frequency and high-frequency hearing impairment among a nationally representative sample
of diabetic adults.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS--Data came from 536 participants, aged 20­69
years, with diagnosed or undiagnosed diabetes who completed audiometric testing during 1999­
2004 in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). We defined hearing
impairment as the pure-tone average .25 dB hearing level of pure-tone thresholds at low/mid-
frequencies (500; 1,000; and 2,000 Hz) and high frequencies (3,000; 4,000; 6,000; and 8,000
Hz) and identified independent risk factors using logistic regression.
RESULTS--Controlling for age, race/ethnicity, and marital status, odds ratios for associations
with low/mid-frequency hearing impairment were 2.20 (95% CI 1.28­3.79) for HDL ,40 mg/dL
and 3.55 (1.57­8.03) for poor health. Controlling for age, race/ethnicity, sex, and income-to-
poverty ratio, odds ratios for associations with high-frequency hearing impairment were 4.39
(1.26­15.26) for history of coronary heart disease and 4.42 (1.26­15.45) for peripheral neu-
ropathy.
CONCLUSIONS--Low HDL, coronary heart disease, peripheral neuropathy, and having
poor health are potentially preventable correlates of hearing impairment for people with diabetes.
Glycemic control, years since diagnosis, and type of glycemic medication were not associated
with hearing impairment.
Diabetes Care 34:1540­1545, 2011
Some degree of hearing impairment
affects over two-thirds of diabetic
adults, about twofold higher than
that of the nondiabetic population (1), yet
little is known about the characteristics of
those experiencing this disability. Reports
(2,3) indicating that audiometric hearing
thresholds are correlated with diabetes
complications, poor glycemic control, or
diabetes duration are often not corrobo-
rated (4­6). Although cardiovascular dis-
ease and its risk factors, including
smoking, have been linked to hearing
impairment in the general population
(7,8), these associations are unsubstanti-
ated among people with diabetes. One
investigation (9) of diabetes complica-
tions among a population-based sample
demonstrated that hearing impairment
was associated with nephropathy but
not with retinopathy, diabetes duration,
or hemoglobin A1c
(A1C). Thus, the evi-
dence that diabetes severity is associated
with the likelihood of hearing impairment
is inconclusive.
Recent national survey data provide
an opportunity to examine the correlates
of hearing impairment in a representative
sample of diabetic adults. The aim of the
currentstudyistoexaminewhether,among
people with diabetes, hearing impairment
is associated with diabetes duration, insulin
use, glycemic control, cardiovascular dis-
ease risk factors, or the presence of diabetes
complications.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND
METHODS--Data, collected during
1999­2004, came from the National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES), which used a complex, mul-
tistage, probability sample representative
of the civilian, noninstitutionalized U.S.
population. Of 5,418 study participants
aged 20­69 years who were randomly
assigned to audiometric testing, 5,147
(95.0%) completed the audiometric ex-
amination, and of those, 399 reported
diagnosed diabetes when asked the ques-
tion, "Other than during pregnancy (for
women), have you ever been told by a
doctor or health professional that you
have diabetes?" Of the remaining 4,748
participants, 2,116 were randomly as-
signed to a fasting blood draw and were
evaluated for undiagnosed diabetes using
the criterion of a fasting blood glucose
$126 mg/dL. Seventy-five participants
with undiagnosed diabetes were identi-
fied with fasting blood glucose. Of 4,673
participants not identified from the inter-
view or fasting blood glucose as having
diabetes, 62 had A1C $6.5% and also
were classified as having undiagnosed di-
abetes, yielding an analytical sample of
536 individuals with diabetes.
Pure-tone audiometry signals were
presented to each ear at varying intensities
until the threshold at which the partici-
pant was just able to perceive the tone
was identified. Air-conduction hearing
thresholds in decibels hearing level (dB
HL) were obtained for each ear at 500;
1,000; 2,000; 3,000; 4,000; 6,000; and
8,000 Hz by trained audiometric techni-
cians using a calibrated Interacoustics
Model AD226 audiometer with study par-
ticipants in a sound-treated booth, which
met the American National Standard Max-
imum Permissible Ambient Noise Levels
for Audiometric Test Rooms (ANSI S3.1-
1991).
Participants were classified as having

(hereafter referred to as the pure-tone av-
erage [PTA]) measured at 500; 1,000; and
2,000 Hz in either ear exceeded 25 dB HL.
If the PTA of thresholds measured at
3,000; 4,000; 6,000; and 8,000 Hz in
either ear exceeded 25 dB HL, participants
were classified as having high-frequency
hearing impairment. A PTA of at least
25 dB HL is considered to be impairment
of sufficient severity to present difficulties
with understanding speech (10). Item-
missing threshold data were considered
as audiometric nonresponse (tone not per-
ceived). After verifying that the average
of their available pure-tone thresholds
exceeded 25 dB HL, participants with
audiometric nonresponse within a fre-
quency range were classified as impaired
for that range. For graphical purposes,
the worse ear was defined as the ear
with the greater PTA of all seven thresh-
olds.
Demographic characteristics, includ-
ing age, race/ethnicity, sex, marital status,
and educational attainment were ob-
tained during interviews. Current smok-
ing status and history of smoking also
were obtained by interview. The income-
to-poverty ratio was defined as the ratio of
reported total family income to the U.S.
Census Bureau poverty threshold. We
defined leisure-time noise exposure as a
positive response to either of two ques-
tions assessing noise exposure from fire-
arms (outside of work) or other noise
sources, for an average of at least once per
month for a year. Occupational noise
exposure was defined as a history of
loud noise at work that required speaking
in a raised voice to be heard. Coronary
heart disease was defined as a positive
response to any of three questions asking
whether a doctor had told the participant
that they have coronary heart disease,
angina, or had a heart attack. Participants
rated their general health status during a
computer-assisted interview. Questions
about the current use of insulin and oral
agents, and years since diabetes diagno-
sis, were asked of those with diagnosed
diabetes.
Anthropometric and clinical mea-
sures were obtained during physical ex-
aminations that included a blood draw
and clean-catch urine collection (11).
BMI was calculated as weight in kilograms
divided by the square of height in meters.
We defined central adiposity as a waist
measurement of $102 cm for men or
$88 cm for women. We defined hyper-
tension as systolic blood pressure $140
mmHg, diastolic blood pressure $90
mmHg, or report of current antihyperten-
sive medication use. Ankle brachial index,
the ratio of systolic blood pressure in the
brachial artery to that in the posterior
tibial artery in the right or left ankle, was
measured in participants aged $40 years.
We defined peripheral arterial disease as
an ankle brachial index ,0.9. Albumin-
uria was defined as a ratio of urinary al-
bumin to urinary creatinine $30 mg/g.
Monofilament testing was administered
to participants aged 40­69 years. Periph-
eral neuropathy was defined as having at
least one insensate area of six metatarsal
sites tested (three on each foot) using a
standard 10-g monofilament. High cho-
lesterol was defined as total cholesterol
$200 mg/dL, a positive response to a
question of whether a health professional
had ever told the participant that they
have high cholesterol, or reported current
use of lipid-lowering medications. Low
HDL was defined as HDL ,40 mg/dL.
A1C was assessed by Boronate Affinity
High-Performance Liquid Chromatogra-
phy using Primus CLC330 and Primus
CLC 385 (Primus, Kansas City, MO),
and values were standardized to the
method of the Diabetes Control and
Complications Trial, yielding interassay
coefficients of variation ,3.0% (12). Sub-
optimal glycemic control was defined as
A1C $7%. Plasma glucose was measured
using a hexokinase enzymatic method
with a coefficient of variation of 1.3­
2.2% (11).
Data analysis
The proportions of our sample with
hearing impairment at high frequencies,
at low/mid-frequencies, at both frequency
ranges, and not hearing-impaired were
computed. Statistical differences in the
distribution of sociodemographic and
anthropometric characteristics, noise ex-
posure, smoking, comorbidities, and
characteristics of diabetes were examined
with t tests (for continuous characteris-
tics) and x2 tests (for categorical charac-
teristics). For the t test, values for years
since diabetes diagnosis were trans-
formed by taking their natural logarithm
to better approximate the assumption of
normality. The level of significance was
a = 0.05. Characteristics independently
associated with a greater prevalence of
low/mid- and high-frequency hearing im-
pairment were identified from odds ratios
and 95% CIs were estimated using logistic
regression. Models tested with peripheral
neuropathy, or peripheral arterial disease,
were limited to participants aged 40­69
years. Differences in the effects of covari-
ates on the odds of hearing impairment by
whether diabetes was previously diag-
nosed were tested with interaction terms.
Analyses were performed using SAS ver-
sion 9.2 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) and
SUDAAN version 10.0.0 (Research Trian-
gle Institute, Research Triangle Park, NC),
incorporating 6-year sample weights,
which accounted for the probabilities of
being assigned to audiometry and/or to
fasting plasma glucose testing.
RESULTS--Two-thirds of subjects
with diabetes had high-frequency hearing
impairment (Table 1). Twenty-six per-
cent also had low/mid-frequency hearing
impairment. Less than 1% of subjects
with diabetes had a low/mid-frequency
hearing impairment without high-
frequency involvement. Characteristics of
the U.S. population with diabetes (diag-
nosed and undiagnosed), aged 20­69
years, are presented in Table 2 and strati-
fied by low/mid- and high-frequency hear-
ing impairment. Diabetic subjects with
hearing impairment had a mean age of
56­57 years, which was significantly older
than those without hearing impairment.
Among those with hearing impairment, a
lesser proportion was non-Hispanic black
or Mexican American. No sex differences in

low/mid-frequency hearing impairment
were observed, but there was a markedly
higher percentage of male subjects among
the hearing-impaired at high frequencies.
Diabetic adults with low/mid-frequency
hearing impairment were more likely to
be unmarried and to have less than a high
school education, whereas no significant
differences in marital or education status
were found by high-frequency hearing im-
pairment status. We found no significant
differences in the proportions with hearing
impairment by leisure time or occupational
noise exposure.
Among subjects with diabetes, prev-
alence of low HDL was significantly
greater in those who were hearing-
impaired at the low/mid-frequency range,
whereas the prevalence of high total
cholesterol was significantly higher in
those who were hearing-impaired at the
high-frequency range. We observed no
differences in hearing impairment by the
prevalence of hypertension or current
smoking status. Coronary heart disease
was twice as prevalent among diabetic
subjects with low/mid-frequency hearing
impairment and over four times as prev-
alent among those with high-frequency
hearing impairment compared with those
without hearing impairment. Comparing
diabetic subjects with high-frequency
hearing impairment to those without
impairment, estimates for mean BMI and
the proportion with central adiposity
were not in the expected direction but
were not significantly different (P = 0.12).
Peripheral neuropathy was experienced
by 25% and peripheral arterial disease
by 9% of those with high-frequency hear-
ing impairment, about four times the
prevalence of these complications among
those not impaired. Higher prevalence es-
timates of albuminuria were observed
among those with hearing impairment at
both frequency ranges, although this was
statistically significant at the low/mid-
frequency range only. We observed no
difference in the proportion with A1C
$7%. The proportion of subjects with
low/mid-frequency hearing impairment
who reported being in poor health was
over two times that of those without
low/mid-frequency hearing impairment.

Hearing impairment and diabetes
Among 399 participants with diagnosed
diabetes, mean diabetes duration in those
with hearing impairment was 5 years
greater than in those without hearing im-
pairment but was statistically significant
only at the high-frequency range. Partic-
ipants with low/mid-frequency hearing
impairment used insulin more frequently
and oral medications less frequently
(marginally significant, P = 0.08).
Adjusting for sociodemographic fac-
tors, we found that low HDL levels in-
creased the odds of low/mid-frequency
hearing impairment by 2.2-fold (Table 3).
Those who reported poor health were
over three times as likely to have low/
mid-frequency hearing impairment. Sub-
jects who reported coronary heart disease
or peripheral neuropathy had over four
times the odds of high-frequency hearing
impairment. We found no evidence of ef-
fect modification of any covariate by di-
agnosed versus undiagnosed diabetes.
Suboptimal glycemic control, years since
diagnosis, type of glycemic medication,
BMI, and high total cholesterol were not
significantly related to hearing impair-
ment at either frequency range. Age-
adjusted mean pure-tone thresholds
from the worse ear are presented by the
presence or absence of low HDL (Fig. 1A),
coronary heart disease (Fig. 1B), periph-
eral neuropathy (Fig. 1C), and poor self-
reported health (Fig. 1D). Subjects with
low HDL and coronary heart disease and
those who reported poor health had higher
thresholds at all frequencies than subjects
without these conditions. Subjects with pe-
ripheral neuropathy had higher thresholds
at frequencies .1,000 Hz.
CONCLUSIONS--Diabetes-related
hearing loss has been described as a pro-
gressive, sensorineural impairment (5)
affecting audiometric thresholds between
500 and 8,000 Hz (1). Presbycusis, or
age-related hearing loss, typically begins
in the higher frequencies and progresses
to the middle and then lower frequencies as
people age. Correlates of high-frequency
hearing loss may indicate characteristics
of those in an earlier stage of presbycusis,
and subjects who additionally have low/
mid-frequency hearing impairment are
more likely to have had hearing impair-
ment for a longer period of time. Thus,
we evaluated correlates of low/mid- and
high-frequency hearing impairment in a
nationally representative sample of dia-
betic adults aged 20­69 years.
We observed strong associations with
age and race at both frequency ranges that
are consistent with evidence from the
general population (13). Despite the
higher prevalence of diabetes complica-
tions, such as retinopathy and nephropa-
thy, among non-Hispanic blacks and
Mexican Americans (14,15), these groups
had lower prevalence of hearing impair-
ment compared with non-Hispanic
whites or people from other minority
race/ethnicity groups. The higher odds
of high-frequency hearing impairment
among male subjects than female subjects
is possibly attributed to residual confound-
ing by industrial and/or recreational noise
exposure, for which self-reported measures
often are inadequate. Excessive noise com-
monly affects hair cells sensitive to signals
of 4,000­6,000 Hz, and elevated thresh-
olds in this range are more commonly ob-
served among male subjects (16). We
observed greater prevalence of high- fre-
quency hearing impairment among those
with a lower income-to-poverty ratio,
consistent with previously described so-
cioeconomic inequalities (17). In addi-
tion to exposure to noisy environmental
conditions (18), subjects of lower socio-
economic status may have a history of in-
adequate glycemic control, for which we
are unable to adjust adequately because
we have only one A1C measurement. We
observed a greater prevalence of low/mid-
frequency hearing impairment among un-
married subjects. Cruickshanks et al. (19)
have reported greater risk of hearing im-
pairment among unmarried subjects over
10 years of follow-up, but the role of mar-
ital status in the development of hearing
impairment remains unknown.
There is debate about whether diabe-
tes affects hearing through angiopathic or
neuropathic mechanisms (20). We found
hearing impairment in the low/mid- and
high-frequency range to be associated
with low HDL and coronary heart disease
history, respectively. These observations
support the hypothesis that diabetes-
related hearing loss accompanies an ath-
erosclerotic mechanism affecting the inner
ear that also may occur subsequent to an
ischemic event. There are no population-
based studies of subjects with diabetes
with which to compare our findings,
but Gates et al. (7) described elevated
low/mid-frequency pure-tone thresholds
among male subjects (but not female sub-
jects) of the Framingham Cohort Study
with confirmed myocardial infarction
and reported a greater occurrence of low/
mid-frequency hearing impairment among
both male and female subjects with con-
firmed coronary heart disease. Our evi-
dence agrees with observations by Gates
et al. (7) who found an inverse relationship
between HDL and low/mid-frequency
PTAamongwomen.Findingsfromastudy
of middle-aged men in military occupa-
tions further support an atherosclerotic
mechanism based on modest associations
of high total cholesterol and high triglycer-
ides with hearing impairment after adjust-
ing for diabetes (21). It is important to
note that we observed no association be-
tween hearing impairment and albumin-
uria, an outcome related to microvascular
disease. The elevated odds of hearing im-
pairment among non-Hispanic white sub-
jects that we observed compared with
non-Hispanic black or Mexican-American
subjects also is incongruent with usual
race/ethnic patterns of microvascular com-
plications, such as nephropathy or retinop-
athy (14,15).
We observed a strong association of
high-frequency hearing impairment with
peripheral neuropathy. Diabetic neurop-
athy is a well-established complication of
uncontrolled hyperglycemia, but there is

little population-based evidence of a cor-
relation with hearing function despite the
hypotheses that diabetes or hyperglyce-
mia may affect the sensory neurons of the
inner ear, involve the VIII nerve, or in-
fluence central auditory processing
(22,23). Several studies have examined
the effect of diabetic neuropathy on audio-
metric threshold levels with small samples
of patients with type 1 diabetes, but overall
evidence is inconclusive as to the indepen-
dent effects of neuropathy, other compli-
cations, diabetes duration, or glycemic
control (2­6). A previous epidemiologic in-
vestigation of type 2 diabetes and hearing
impairment found no association for either
diabetes duration or A1C, findings that our
study corroborates (9).
We acknowledge the limitations to
this analysis. Our sample is derived from
noninstitutionalized adults, so we are
unable to generalize to subjects in nursing
homes, where more severe disability
might be expected. We cannot differenti-
ate subjects with type 1 diabetes from
those with type 2 diabetes, but note that
90­95% of the diabetic adults in our na-
tionally representative sample are likely to
have type 2 diabetes (24). Temporal rela-
tionships between our covariates and
hearing impairment remain ambiguous
as a result of the cross-sectional nature
of the data. There also may be some errors
in the measurement of independent vari-
ables. Years since diabetes diagnosis is an
imperfect proxy for disease duration, par-
ticularly if pathogenic changes accompany
hyperglycemic states prior to diabetes di-
agnosis (25).
In summary, hearing impairment is
not widely recognized as a complication
of diabetes despite its occurrence in as
many as two-thirds of our diabetic sam-
ple. Among U.S. adults with diabetes, we
identified a greater likelihood of hearing

Hispanic white, male, or who have lower
income. Diabetic subjects with low
HDL, a history of coronary heart disease,
symptoms of peripheral neuropathy, or
those who report poor health also
exhibited a greater likelihood of hearing

be important in delineating the natural
