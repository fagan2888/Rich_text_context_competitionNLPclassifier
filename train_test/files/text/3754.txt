Abstract. Pictorial images are icons as well as eye-cons: they provide distillations of objects or ideas
into simpler shapes. They create the impression of representing that which cannot be presented.
Even at the level of the photograph, the links between icon and object are tenuous. The dimensions
of depth and motion are missing from icons, and these alone introduce all manner of potential
ambiguities. The history of art can be considered as exploring the missing link between icon and
object. Eye-cons can also be illusions--tricks of vision so that what is seen does not necessarily
correspond to what is physically presented. Pictorial images can be spatialised or stylised; spatialised
images generally share some of the projective characteristics of the object represented. Written
words are also icons, but they do not resemble the objects they represent--they are stylised or
conventional. Icons as stylised words and spatialised images were set in delightful opposition by
René Magritte in a series of pipe paintings, and this theme is here alluded to. Most of visual science
is now concerned with icons--two-dimensional displays on computer monitors. Is vision now the
science of eye-cons?
Keywords: vision, art, icons, ambiguity, illusions, allusions.
1 Introduction
Observations provide the bedrock of perception. Records of observations precede records of
their verbal descriptions; that is, the products of art precede those of writing. Relatively little
is known about the origins of visual art. Examples of marks made on tools and cave walls
have been dated to many thousands of years ago, but we do not know when such activities
began. Writing had its origins around 5,000 years ago. The adoption of experimental methods
to record observations is a development of recent centuries. What we consider to be art
involves the distillation of specific observations into spatialised representations (what we
call pictures) or of categories of observations into stylised representations (typically written
words). Both pictorial images and written words are spatially extended, and both can be
considered as icons. The term icon now has several connotations, but it derives from the
Greek word eikon meaning likeness or image. It is in this sense that it will be used here so
that an icon can be equated with a pictorial image.
Perception has evolved to make and maintain adaptive contact with the environment.
Through the action of the senses an organism seeks sustenance, shelter, and sex in order to
survive and reproduce. The senses of all species have become adapted to the demands of
their survival and reproduction, and there is a great variety in the ways in which senses have
evolved. In addition, the human senses are linked to an intricately organised brain, which
has evolved to extract more than the elements of material sustenance. It furnishes us with
intellectual sustenance, too, and extracts from the patterns of sensory stimulation links to
language and thought. Humans not only use their senses but they also muse about them.
Paradoxically, much of this musing has concerned minor errors of perception (referred to here
as eye contricks) rather than the constancies of what we perceive. Despite the long history
of recording perceptions, attention continues to be directed to eye contricks--the small
deviations from constancy that we call illusions. Constancy and illusion can be considered
as existing on a continuum from veridical perception (reflected as a Brunswik ration of 1)
to complete illusion (as in some instances of induced motion, when the physically moving
parts are seen as stationary and the stationary parts as moving in the opposite direction).
Eye contricks 487
Most of our perception involves constancy or minor deviations from it; these latter we call
illusions (or eye contricks). Artists have developed an array of eye contricks in order to
achieve their ends--conveying an allusion to the objects or classes of object they represent.
It will be argued that visual scientists now share this concern with artists. They examine
representations of objects (usually pictorial representations of them) rather than the objects
themselves: they are engaged in intricate manipulations of eye contricks which might not
further our understanding of object perception.

The concepts of image and icon have thrived on their vagueness, and so attempts
have been made to refine them (see Wade 1990). An icon corresponds to a pictorial
image: it is spatially extended and can share some of the projective characteristics of the
object represented. Thus a photograph of a pipe is an icon or spatialised image because
it corresponds to a projection of the three-dimensional object onto a two-dimensional
surface. It also represents a specific pipe viewed from a particular direction. The word PIPE
is similarly an icon or stylised image, but it refers to a category of objects rather than to
specific exemplars. Like all pictorial images, icons are eye-cons: they provide a distillation
of a complex object or idea into a simple pictorial shape. They create the impression of
representing that which cannot be veridically presented. Despite the cliché that the camera
never lies, the links between icon and object are tenuous in photographs. The dimensions of
distance or depth as well as motion are missing from the pictorial image or icon, and this
alone introduces all manner of potential ambiguities. Wagemans et al (2011), Koenderink et
al (2011), and van Doorn et al (2011) discuss the apparent depth in pictorial images and the
ways in which they can be measured. The history of art can be considered as an exploration
488 N Wade
of the missing link between icon and object: the many pictorial tricks applied by artists
allude to the dimensions that icons and pictorial images do not contain--depth and motion.
Eye-cons (as in Figure 1) can be more honest--they can reflect tricks of vision so that what is
seen does not necessarily correspond to what is presented.
The term "eye-con" is also a play on words. The English language affords vast license for
word play, and I will engage in this exercise in the titles of the eye-cons presented. However,
my main concern with "eye contricks" is to engage in a play on images rather than words. That
is, less attention has been directed to the shapes of letters and words than to the meanings
they convey. Indeed, even that great artistic wizard with words and images--René Magritte
(1898­1967)--did not apply his artistry to letter and word shapes. He was more concerned
with confounding the verbal and visual labels than with complicating the shape of the word.
Concrete or visual poetry has shown a similar reluctance to manipulate the fundamental
features of typography (see Hollander 1991; Riddell 1972; Roberts 2011; Voss and Drucker
1996). I will use letter and word shapes in a variety of graphical ways in order to play tricks
with icons. A broader range of eye contricks involving "perceptual portraits" can be seen in
Wade (2006) and at http://neuroportraits.eu.
2 Stylised and spatialised icons
We all make icons (pictorial images) constantly, though we rarely think of them in this way--
we can all write although most of our writing is now done indirectly via a computer keyboard.
Accordingly, pictorial images can be either stylised, like the letters of our written language, or
spatialised, like drawings, paintings, and photographs. Figure 2 conflates these two types of
icons by presenting the words in both conventional and idiosyncratic scripts: conventional
uppercase letters spell the words IMAGE repetitively in the top half and WORD in the
bottom half. However, these conventional letter shapes are enclosed within idiosyncratic and
incomplete script for WORD at the top and IMAGE at the bottom; only parts of the complete
letters are presented, and they are joined by an equally idiosyncratic AND. The handmade
words are more difficult to read as a consequence, unlike the conventional printed letter
shapes. Moreover, the colours themselves play parts in the perceptual puzzle: the red is
physically equivalent throughout, as is the blue, but they do not appear so. Owing to colour
assimilation, the red looks darker in the upper half than in the lower, and the blue looks
lighter in the lower than the upper half.
Stylised pictures, as in written scripts, are obviously arbitrary and dependent upon
convention. Chinese pictograms differ markedly from our alphabetical letters, but they can
be arranged to allude to the same objects by those schooled in the rules of the language. Thus,
written words are also instances of visual allusions. They present us with indirect references
to objects and ideas. They are stylised images that usually have little spatial similarity to the
things they signify. This is the basis for the discordant tune played by Magritte on his pipes
(Figure 3). The word "pipe" has little in common spatially with the vast variety of objects
that would be members of that category. In this sense, a word is worth a thousand images!
To be more precise, a stylised image is worth an infinite number of spatialised images: any
object can be represented by an infinite number of spatialised images by varying its pictorial
dimensions, viewpoint, etc. We can make words less indirect by depicting the shape of the
objects to which they refer. That is, the stylised image (the shape of the word) can represent
the class of objects the word signifies, whereas the spatialised image is a specific instance of
a member of that category. The simulated reality of both spatialised and stylised pictures
is appositely portrayed in a picture by Magritte entitled The Perfidy of Images (see Foucault
1983; Gablik 1976; Whitfield 1992). Variations on the theme are played in Figure 3; others can
be found in Wade (1990, 2010).
Eye contricks 489
Figure 2. Images and Words (© Nicholas Wade).
Magritte's initial pipe painting was produced around 1928, and he made several variations
on the theme. The title signalled his desire to pit word against image: printed beneath the
spatialised image of the pipe are the words "This is not a pipe". Thus, the viewer is confronted
with the message that although this looks like a pipe it is actually pigment on canvas, ink or
silver crystals on paper, or light on a screen: the pictured pipe cannot be smoked or handled,
indeed it seems to be floating in air rather than supported on any surface. We do not know if
there ever was an actual pipe that Magritte painted. He might have represented a pipe from
his imagination, in which case it would have been a pipe dream! Note that Magritte painted
the words, too, so he was using one symbolic picture (the written word--a stylised image) to
say that another symbolic picture (the shape and colour of the pipe--a spatialised image)
was not the object represented. When the painted pipe and painted words are in conflict like
this we are more likely to think that the pipe shape does not correspond to the object rather
than question the relation of the word shape to its referent.
When objects are represented in isolation they tend to be depicted in what can be
referred to as the stereotypical view (Wade 1990). This has also been called a typical outline;
other terms for it have been canonical or prototypical views. They all involve minimal
foreshortening of the most asymmetrical axis. Therefore, the stereotypical view is the
most informative two-dimensional representation of a three-dimensional object. Another
way of describing the stereotypical view would be as the least ambiguous silhouette (see
Wagemans et al 2008). The pipes in Figure 3 could have been photographed from many
other directions, some of which would not have been readily recognised as pictures of a pipe.
Magritte's painting depicted a pipe from the side with its bowl inclined slightly towards the
viewpoint; the side view does not shorten the asymmetrical axis of the pipe stem, and it is
the stereotypical viewpoint. There is less relation between Magritte's painted word PIPE and
the shape of actual pipes than there need be. The variety of letter shapes is vast--from the
minor variations in typefaces to the extravagant ornamental shapes used in advertising and
calligraphy. When we take the vagaries of handwriting into account, the range of recognisable
letter shapes explodes even further, as is evident with the upper-right pipe in Figure 3.
It encompasses two ways of writing the words UNE PIPE. The lower one corresponds to
490 N Wade
Figure 3. These Are Not Magritte's Pipes (© Nicholas Wade).
Magritte's handwriting, but the uppermost one is idiosyncratic and complements the shape
of Magritte's painted pipe. Does the combination of the shape of the pipe with the word used
to describe it make it more like a pipe? The pipe was not an arbitrary instrument on which
Magritte played his surreal chords! He was, in fact, rebelling against ideas prevalent in the
late 1920s regarding the universality of the pipe or tube shape, as advocated by the architect
le Corbusier (Charles-Édouard Jeanneret, 1887­1965). Pipes can also be tubes, and they can
have a variety of other meanings, too, which can be alluded to by word pictures shown in
Figure 3.
Magritte described himself as a philosopher who wielded a paint brush rather than a
pen, and his confounding of stylised and spatialised images speak to this appellation. His
tune was played on more than pipes. In his painting Ceci n'est pas une Pomme he painted
an apple with the caption stating that it was not one. Again, the equivalence, rather than
the conflict, between stylised and spatialised icons can be emphasised, as in Figure 4 (left).
Apples featured in many of Magritte's paintings and often obscured the facial features of his
Eye contricks 491
subjects. For example, in The Great War an apple is painted in front of the bowler-hatted
figure. A variant of the theme is played in Figure 4 (centre), in which identity is partially
exposed. Magritte also made a series of paintings in which he gave false names to pictured
objects. In his Key of Dreams he divided the canvas into four quadrants and painted a pictorial
image in each of these. Three were accompanied by inappropriate verbal labels: beneath
a picture of a horse the words THE DOOR were painted, a clock was accompanied by THE
WIND, and THE BIRD beneath a picture of a jug. This icon trick has been turned on its
stylised head in Figure 4 (right), where the jug is THE BIRD. The sounds of the verbal labels
are determined by the demands of language, and the same object is given varied vocalisations
in a variety of languages. In this sense they can be considered as arbitrary, as can the letter
shapes or scripts used to capture the particular sounds.
One of the reasons why we equate pictorial images with the objects they represent is
because of the many camera-derived images we see constantly in print, on television, and
on computer screens. It is these perspective pictures that provide us with such a satisfactory
substitute for reality. The camera always lies: it delivers a time-frozen image of a dynamic
world. We do not see by means of static images in the eye; our eyes are in continual motion
due to either involuntary or voluntary eye movements. This is quite unlike any image a
camera can deliver.

3 Illusions as eye contricks
Eye contricks are much more than visual illusions, although they can operate at this level.
Because icons and pictorial images generally seem to convey their meaning with such
immediacy, we rarely stop to ponder the paradoxes they pose. If they are so important, we
should understand more about the way we see them and the processes that are involved in
making them. Pictorial representations, like those captured by a camera, are traditionally
referred to as creating illusions of objects in three-dimensional space, but this is less than
accurate because it betrays a misunderstanding of what is meant by the term illusion. Such
pictures are visual allusions rather than visual illusions. The distinction is more fundamental
than a single letter, and it can be illustrated in Figure 5. The words VISUAL ILLUSIONS are
dimly defined by the green and yellow outlines and the slight difference in colour and contrast
to the background. Throughout the figure there are red vertical lines; they are parallel to one
492 N Wade
another, but they probably look tilted one way and then the other. This is an example of an
illusion.
Figure 5. Allusory Illusions (© Nicholas Wade).
Illusions are the result of genuine and consistent mistakes in our perception (Gregory
2009; Ninio 2001; Robinson 1972; Wade 1982, 2005a), as in misjudging the orientation of the
red vertical lines in Figure 5. That is, a constant mismatch occurs between perception of
an object property and the physical description of it. The lines are physically vertical and
parallel even though they appear to be tilted away from one another. This is because of the
wavy lines they cross: without them the lines would look parallel and there would be no
illusion. Illusions are unitary and compelling perceptions, whereas allusions involve the
perception of at least two aspects of pictures simultaneously. There are two visual allusions
in Figure 5. One is an allusion to depth--the wavy lines look like a three-dimensional surface;
the depth might appear ambiguous, with one set of curves looking like humps then like
hollows, but the depth is apparent while at the same time the surface of the page is seen as
flat. This is the most pervasive form of visual allusion we encounter, and it has proved to be
one of the most persistent concerns throughout the history of art. Representational pictures
have a dual reality: they are perceived as what they are--marks on a flat surface--while at the
same time representing objects. They are allusions because viewers do not try to handle the
objects depicted as they would the actual objects they represent. There is no doubting the
flatness of the surface on which the marks are made. The other allusion in Figure 5 (which
is more difficult to discern) is a self-portrait. It might not be immediately visible, but it is
there physically in the slight thickening of the blue wavy lines. The geometrical design carries
within it, virtually unseen, another picture. It might be necessary to blur the pattern in some
Eye contricks 493
way in order to see the hidden image; some people can do this by focusing their eyes on some
imaginary point between the picture and their eyes, and others can do the same by shaking
the head from side to side or by shaking the surface on which the picture is printed. This type
of visual allusion is rather like a literary allusion, where the indirect reference remains in the
background--but once appreciated it cannot be dismissed.
In visual science illusions provide the quintessential examples of eye-cons. Spatial or
chromatic features that are physically equivalent appear otherwise because of the context
in which they are placed. Illusions as departures from veridical perception have been a
constant source of enquiry throughout the recorded history of vision. Nonetheless, they
were imbued with increased significance in the late 19th century. On the one hand, they
liberated psychology from physiology and, on the other, they were considered to hold the
key to unlock the secrets of perception. Moreover, they could be readily visualised via simple
icons which induced compelling contrasts. Paradoxically, some of the first illusions displayed
in this form were of phenomena that could be experienced in the natural environment, like
the moon and waterfall illusions (Wade 2005a). Helmholtz (1867) was able to see the start of
this illusory movement, and he also added a static illusion that is called Helmholtz squares
(Figure 6). It is basically an example of the horizontal­vertical illusion: the area defined by
horizontal lines appears smaller than that made up of vertical lines.
The illusions that attracted the interests of many 19th-century visual scientists were those
labelled "geometrical optical" by Oppel (1856). They consist of relatively small but reliable
distortions of visual space, mostly in the domains of size or orientation. Many novel forms
were devised and depicted in the final decades of the century, and they often bear the names
of those who first drew and described them (see Vicario 2008). Geometrical optical illusions
are phenomena of the late 19th century, when the likes of Ponzo, Poggendorff, Mach, and
Müller-Lyer described their eponymous phenomena. It is, however, instructive to examine
why there should have been this burst of illusory activity in the late 19th century. Put another
way, why did icons assume such a central role in the study of visual perception? It could
have been due to the combination of two powerful strands of thinking about vision. The
first stems from the 17th century, when Kepler and later Scheiner elucidated the dioptrical
properties of the eye. They thereby set in train the idea that the problem of perception has
an icon as its starting point--the static, two-dimensional retinal image. The retinal image
was considered as static, and the problem was seen as restoring the missing dimension of
distance from the ambiguous projection. However, this is both a physical and a physiological
fiction.
The static retinal image is a convenient physical fiction because it allows us to draw
ray diagrams that describe the dioptrical properties of the eye. It is a physiological fiction
because the eye is never still and the receptors collect energy at differential rates depending
upon wavelength and luminance. Nonetheless, these fictions continue to drive our models of
vision. The second strand relates to the experimental approaches to the study of perception
introduced in the mid-19th century. Wheatstone (1838) and Helmholtz (1867) argued that
experimental rigour of the physical sciences should be brought to bear on the study of
perception. Thus stimulus variables should be isolated and manipulated in quite unnatural
ways in order to determine how perception is modified. It is difficult to manipulate solid
objects, but it is exceedingly easy to create novel pictorial images or icons. Moreover,
Wheatstone himself had shown that the perception of three-dimensional space can be
synthesised from the use of two appropriate flat drawings. So pictures or icons became the
accepted stimuli for the study of vision. Once accepted, the psychologists then rediscovered
eye contricks that had been a part of the artist's armoury for centuries, and they devised
some novel ones, too (see Pinna and Reeves 2009, Wade 2007a).

Figure 6. Helmholtz Squared. Helmholtz is enclosed twice within squares like those he printed, defined
by either vertical or horizontal lines; the blue lines are physically the same throughout (© Nicholas
Wade).
The Helmholtz squares illusion is based on the distortions of space in the cardinal
orientations. It is now called the horizontal­vertical illusion, and it is usually represented
as single lines in an inverted T shape. It incorporates both orientation and extent, whereas
most others involve one of these dimensions alone. Two orientation illusions are shown
in Figure 7. That on the left consists of the original figure used by Johann Karl Friedrich
Zöllner (1834­1882; 1860) to show how cross hatchings in opposite directions result in lines
appearing to be inclined. Zöllner sent his icon to the journal Annalen der Physik und Chemie
which was edited by Johann Christian Poggendorff (1796­1877), whose portrait is shown in
Figure 7, left. Poggendorff noted that the edges of the cross-hatched lines appeared out of
alignment, and his name is now associated with that illusion. A more contemporary drawing
of the Zöllner illusion is shown on the right: the concentric squares appear to be distorted
because of the diagonal lines that cross them. Zöllner's portrait is also alluded to in the
illustration on the right; it might be difficult to discern initially, but when it is seen his palsied
right cheek and lip will be evident.
Illusions of length were represented somewhat later, but they have been subjected to more
intense experiment and interpretation than those of orientation. The illusions of Franz Carl
Müller-Lyer (1857­1916) and Mario Ponzo (1882­1960) are shown in Figure 8. Geometrical
optical illusions have an important place in the history of psychology, because they were
amongst the factors that led Wundt to establish his Psychological Institute at Leipzig in
1879--he could not envisage how illusions could be accounted for in physiological terms;
and so they, along with consciousness, required a separate discipline. Wundt took as his
yardstick the proximal stimulus (the retinal image)--and he could not accept that, say, two
linear extents (like the horizontal lines in Figure 8, left) that produced equivalent retinal
extents could yield perceptual inequality due to physiological processes. Thus, geometrical
optical illusions are important in the context of establishing psychology as an independent
discipline: there was considered to be no physiological correlate of perception. Psychologists
like Wundt sought to determine correlates, and the one most favoured at that time was in
terms of eye movements, although other higher-level alternatives were also entertained.
Contrast phenomena provided another potent source of visual illusion. Although the
influence that a surrounding colour can have on an enclosed one had long been known,

in Poggendorff's Annalen; it illustrated the illusions with which both are associated. Zöllner can be
seen on the right in a modern variant of his orientation illusion; his right eye is centred in the pattern
and he is facing to the left (© Nicholas Wade).
Figure 8. Illusions of Extent. Left, the two red horizontal lines are the same physical length but they
appear different: the upper one appears longer. This was described by Müller-Lyer, whose bearded
features are present in the illustration. Right, converging lines create contrasts in size perception, as is
evident in the two same-sized portraits of Ponzo: the upper one appears larger than the lower one (©
Nicholas Wade).
subtle effects of brightness contrast were described in the 19th century. For example, Ludimar
Hermann (1838­1914; 1870) gave an account of the effects that can be seen in the grid on
the left of Figure 9--dark dots appear at the intersection of the lighter lines. He related the
illusory dots to the operation of simultaneous contrast. The converse, where light grey dots
are seen at the intersections of the darker lines, was described later by Karl Ewald Konstantin
Hering (1834­1918; 1907). Hermann's and Hering's original figures were in black and white.
496 N Wade
The Hermann grid on the left of Figure 9 contains the face of Hermann, and the Hering grid
on the right contains Hering's portrait.
Figure 9. Hermann-Hering Grids. The grid on the left contains the face of Hermann, whereas the grid
on the right carries the face of Hering. The faces will be seen more easily if the figure is viewed from
several metres (© Nicholas Wade).
The Hermann and Hering grids have assumed a position of considerable importance
in contemporary visual science, as they have provided a means by which receptive fields
recorded physiologically can be related to "perceptive fields" determined psychophysically
(see Lingelbach and Ehrenstein 2002; Schiller and Carvey 2005; Spillmann 1994; Wade 2005b).
The dimensions of concentric receptive fields are smallest in the retinal ganglion cells
receiving their input from the central fovea, and they increase in size with increasing distance
from the fovea. This is probably the reason why the Hermann-Hering dots are not visible
at the fixated intersection: both the centre and surround would fall between the squares
and within the intersections, so that there would be no differential response from them, and
no illusory dots. If the separations are made sufficiently small, then the dots can be seen at
the fixated intersections. It is by this means that measuring the limiting dimensions of grids
yielding the illusory dots has been used to estimate the sizes of perceptive fields at different
eccentricities in human vision.
In the 19th century the study of illusions was used to argue for the independence of
psychology from physiology. The static proximal stimulus had been described, and so the
two lines of the Müller-Lyer illusion would project equal length lines on the retina and visual
neuroscience stopped at the retina--so physiologists could not account for the illusion.
Illusions were studied in the late 19th century because they were not amenable to the extant
Eye contricks 497
physiology--hence their place in psychology. They also fostered the use of two-dimensional
stimuli in perceptual experiments, giving vision the aura of scientific respectability.
4 Pictures as eye-cons
Pictorial images are icons which provide allusions to objects, and some of the eye contricks
that can be played with the transition from three to two dimensions. Indeed, this is grist to
the artistic mill: icons incorporate ambiguities and impossibilities that are rarely or never
present in objects. Are icons so central to understanding perception? What is the relationship
between perception of pictorial images and of the objects they portray? Will understanding
icons facilitate our interpretations of vision, or vice versa? And how do those peculiar eye-
cons, geometrical optical illusions, relate to other forms of pictorial representation? It could
well be argued that the study of vision will not be furthered by the examination of such
oddities.

All include portraits facing to the left, but that of Wilding also contains a right-facing portrait (©
Nicholas Wade).
Magritte was not alone in generating subtle eye contricks: others on the surrealist scene
were sowing similar seeds. For example, Salvador Dali (1904­89) and Marcel Duchamp
(1887­1968) drew upon the emerging experimental research on vision to further their
artistic ends. Dali not only amplified ambiguities in many of his early paintings but also
presented more subtle variations on the digitised images of Abraham Lincoln, constructed
by Harmon and Julesz (1973)--see http://www.michaelbach.de/ot/fcs_mosaic/. Duchamp's
498 N Wade
rotoreliefs, produced at around the same time as Magritte's pipe pictures, followed
rapidly on the heels of Musatti's (1924) experiments with the stereokinetic effect, where
simple circular patterns appeared in depth when rotated--see http://lite.bu.edu/vision-
flash10/applets/Depth/Benussi/Rotorelief.html and http://www.opprints.co.uk/stereokinetic-
3-4-6.php. Other kinetic works by Duchamp were based on visual persistence. His Rotary
Glass consisted of propellers of glass on which arcs were painted: when they were rotated
rapidly they created the impression of circles (see Wade 1978). Between both these artists,
and influencing them artistically, was Pablo Picasso (1881­1973). The development of
cubism represented an attempt to embrace the other missing dimension in icons--time--by
capturing views of the same subject at different moments of movement. All three artists are
shown in Figure 10. On the left Dali's trademark moustache encloses contours alluding to
ambiguous depths from which his third eye peers. In the centre Picasso can be seen within
cubist depictions of his name PABLO PICASSO, and Duchamp's profile is part of a pattern
that, if rotated, would appear like a cone in depth.
The science and art of vision merge in the genre referred to as Op Art. Op Art is first and
foremost geometrical and hard edged: the shapes displayed are precisely defined by sharp
edges, and the assemblage is geometrical rather than naturalistic (see Follin 2004; Guigon
and Pierre 2005; Houston 2007; Wade 1978, 1982, 1990, 2009; Zanker 2004). That is, the
works are generally abstract, with no representational features. The aspect that distinguishes
the genre from many other forms of geometrical abstraction is the dramatic visual effects
produced by the arrangements of contours. The works induce an immediate interaction
with the observer because the viewer's eyes are a fundamental feature of the interaction
between icon and observer. Not only do Op Art works "strike the eye" but they also undergo
dynamic changes in the process of observation. This is the context for the meeting between
visual art and visual science. One of the leading exponents of the genre was Victor Vasarely
(1906­97), who is dimly discernable in the red-and-green grid shown on the left of Figure 11.
Vasarely constantly experimented with geometrical abstraction, and he tried to remove the
imprint of personality from his work, much of which can be mechanically produced. His
concern was with simple geometrical shapes like circles, squares, and triangles, and he
varied the sizes, colours, and relations between these in many ingenious ways (Holzhey
2005; Vasarely 1965). He produced a large number of works in stark black and white, and
these were often visually vibrant--they would appear to move, or the shapes would seem
to reorganise themselves into novel configurations. These marked the beginning of Op Art
in the 1950s. Later, he worked more with colour, often using synthetic materials for added
intensity. Another pioneer of Op Art is Bridget Riley (Figure 11, centre), who is best known for
her high-contrast, black-and-white paintings of geometrically periodic patterns. Movements
and distortions of the patterns are seen even though none are occurring on the picture plane
(Kudielka 1999; Riley 2001, 2009). The dynamic changes are a consequence of processes
within the visual system of the observer, and so they are truly interactive paintings. Her
portrait is embedded in a drawn design that displays many of the visual distortions seen in
her paintings. The wavy radiating lines appear to shimmer and move, particularly around
the inflection points of the curves; the contours fluctuate in clarity, being sharply defined at
one moment and blurred at the next. These changes are a consequence of minor variations
in the curvature of the crystalline lens, which produce transient astigmatism. It is when the
contours are blurred that Bridget Riley's portrait can be seen. The wavy lines also display
another phenomenon--that of impossible figures. The contours can appear to represent
a three-dimensional surface, but one that could not be realised: curves which appear like
bumps on one side look like hollows on the other. Following a hump or hollow from one
side to the other will result in an inflection of the surface near the vertical midline, adding to

the visual tension generated by the design. Both Vasarely and Riley (as well as the other Op
Artists) were, however, drawing on a longer tradition both in visual science and in art.
When two periodic patterns are superimposed, slightly out of alignment, a new configu-
ration emerges that is determined by the intersections of the component patterns. This is
called a moiré pattern (after moiré antique or watered silk, which has a pronounced parallel
weave). When two gratings are inclined relative to one another, the dominant impression is of
the parallel moiré interference fringes due to the regions of minimal overlap of the gratings. It
is obvious from the name alone that moiré patterns have long been observed, but they have
also proved to be of interest to physicists over the last century. Illustrations of more complex
moiré patterns can be found in textbooks of optics as well as in many art galleries; examples
can be found at http://www.opprints.co.uk/moire-fantastic.php. Moiré patterns have proved
particularly potent in the works of a number of Op Artists. One of the greatest exponents
was Ludwig Wilding (1927­2010), who is shown in Figure 11, right. The interference fringes
are due to the interaction between a vertical grating and a radiating pattern. He is portrayed
twice, facing left and right, with his features defined by slight variations in the sizes of the
elements. Small separations in depth between the interfering components magnify the depth
seen in the disparate moiré fringes, and Wilding utilised this effect to create a novel form of
stereoscopic stimulus (Wade 2007b).

This selected survey of eye contricks has now come to an end. As was intimated at the
outset, it is rarely the eye that is being conned by icons, but it is the brain that is struggling to
find the solution to the paradoxes that pictorial images pose. Magritte was concerned with

eye contricks--demonstrating the allusory nature of all images--and so it is fitting to end
with one of him (Figure 12).
5 Conclusion
To question the appropriateness of icons as the stimuli for vision is more subversive than it
might at first appear. Are not our ideas of the retinal image also iconic? We have certainly
progressed in our physiological knowledge since Wundt; indeed, there are now physiological
interpretations of illusions. But have our ideas about the nature of the retinal image advanced
also? Visual phenomena provide the bedrock for science and art. Both disciplines revel in the
license allowed by iconic manipulation. Natural vision is binocular and dynamic, yielding
the perception of depth and motion. Icons are flat and static, but, when modified and
presented via a computer, they can present us with perceptual paradoxes. The deeper puzzle
is whether visual science is being conned by icons. Is it being seduced by the simplicity of
image manipulation and losing sight of the functions that vision serves? Is vision now the
science of eye-cons?
