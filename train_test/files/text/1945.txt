SCHOLARS have posited a variety of psychosocial re-
sources that can facilitate an individual's adaptation to
functional health decline (Bishop, 2005; Livneh, 2001),
such as having a strong sense of control and receiving
social support. This study aimed to extend understanding
of psychosocial resources that promote psychological
well-being in the face of declining functional health
by examining a factor that previous scholarship has not yet
addressed--felt obligation to help others. This study used
prospective data from the 1995­2005 National Survey of
Midlife in the United States (MIDUS) to investigate felt
obligation to help others across two domains of social re-
lationships (close others and society) as buffers against
losses in psychological well-being following functional
decline in middle and later life. This study also examined
whether associations among functional decline, felt obligation
to help others, and psychological well-being vary by age.
Felt Obligation to Help Others as a Psychosocial
Resource in the Face of Functional Decline
Felt obligation refers to perceiving that one is expected to
behave in particular ways toward others (Rossi & Rossi,
1990), with one type of behavior constituting helping others
(Stein, 1992). Felt obligation to help others can be concep-
tualized as an aspect of altruism, which is a broader con-
struct referring to a motivational state directed toward
enhancing others' welfare (Batson, 1991). Despite a grow-
ing body of research on altruism and individual well-being
(Post, 2005), there has been less attention to how an orienta-
tion toward helping others might be particularly important
for adults facing particular conditions of adversity, such as
declining functional health.
Recent theorizing on compassionate love--as a genuine
concern for the welfare of others with intentions to alleviate
their suffering and to promote their flourishing (Underwood,
2009)--offers preliminary insights regarding processes
through which greater felt obligation to help others can
serve as an asset in the face of functional decline. First,
qualitative studies have found that experiences of compas-
sionate love oftentimes involve a strong, potentially spiri-
tual, sense of connection to others (Mastain, 2006; Monroe,
1996; Oliner & Oliner, 1988; Underwood, 2002). Such ex-
periences might include connecting with a religiously iden-
tified transcendent and can also involve a more general view
of one's self as connected to all humanity (Mastain, 2006).
Being able to perceive one's self as part of a larger, mean-
ingful life whole might facilitate individuals' ability to tran-
scend their own physical self when faced with functional
decline and help them to continue to derive feelings of
meaning, growth, and a positive sense of self in relationship
to others despite functional decline.
Another aspect of compassionate love involves individu-
als' valuing others at a fundamental level (Mastain, 2006;
Monroe, 1996; Oliner & Oliner, 1988; Underwood, 2002).
This quality manifests itself in valuing the human worth of
all individuals--regardless of their needs for assistance--
and recognizing the imperfections of being human (Monroe).
Valuing others at a fundamental level further involves defin-
ing oneself and others beyond their functional contributions
to society (Underwood, 2002). Perhaps having such a per-
spective can help individuals better accept themselves when
Felt Obligation to Help Others as a Protective Factor
Against Losses in Psychological Well-being Following
Functional Decline in Middle and Later Life

This study examined felt obligation to help others in two domains (close others and society) as protective factors
against losses in psychological well-being following functional decline. Lagged-dependent regression models were
estimated using data from 849 respondents aged 35­74 years and without any functional limitations at baseline in
the 1995­2005 National Survey of Midlife in the United States. Greater felt obligation to help close others pro-
tected against declining self-acceptance in the face of more severe functional decline, and greater felt obligation to
help society protected against declining personal growth and self-acceptance. Greater felt obligation to help close
others and society protected against increasing depressive symptoms at younger ages in adulthood. Findings sug-
gest the importance for additional research on how aspects of altruism can promote psychological adaptation to
declining functional health in middle and later life.

faced with limitations of their own through declining func-
tional health.
Finally, experiences of compassionate love often involve
a universalistic orientation that advocates for society to af-
ford all people fundamental rights, such as freedom and
health (Mastain, 2006; Monroe, 1996; Oliner & Oliner,
1988; Underwood, 2002). For example, Oliner and Oliner
reported that individuals who helped targeted others to sur-
vive and escape Nazi-dominated Europe emphasized the
importance of applying standards of equity and justice to all
human beings and of helping others even when such assis-
tance was likely to be unreciprocated. When individuals
face circumstances that make them more dependent on
others, such as declining functional health, having a strong
belief in humanity's fundamental responsibility for the
basic well-being of all others might prepare them to more
comfortably accept being the recipient of other people's
care and concern.
Functional Decline, Psychological Well-being, Felt
Obligation to Help Others, and Age
Although much research on functional decline and psy-
chological well-being has focused on older adults (e.g.,
Lenze et al. 2001), functional decline is a salient phenome-
non to examine at earlier periods of adulthood as well. Pre-
vious work suggests that particular sociodemographic
subgroups are more likely to experience functional decline
earlier in the adult lifespan, including members of racial/
ethnic minority groups, women, and adults with lower so-
cioeconomic status (Cleary, Zaborski, & Ayanian, 2004;
Kim & Miech, 2009). Furthermore, with increasing rates of
obesity and associated health problems, scholars predict
that indicators of morbidity--such as declining functional
health--are likely to become increasingly common at ear-
lier periods of adulthood (Sturm, Ringle, & Andreyeva,
2004). Moreover, longstanding lifespan developmental the-
ories suggest age-related changes in individuals' orientation
to the welfare of others (see, McAdams, 2001, for a discus-
sion). Taken together, this scholarship suggests the impor-
tance of examining whether associations among functional
decline, felt obligation to help others, and psychological
well-being vary by age.
A Multidimensional Perspective on Psychological Well-being
Much research on the psychological consequences of de-
clining functional health has examined depressive symp-
toms (Bruce, 2001). Recent conceptualizations of mental
health, however, suggest that mental ill-being is not synony-
mous with well-being (Keyes, 2002). Accordingly, in addi-
tion to examining increasing negative moods and emotions
as a potential consequence of declining functional health,
this study also considers two other aspects of well-being
that address more positive aspects of well-being. These two
dimensions include personal growth (feelings of continued
growth and development as a person) and self-acceptance
(positive evaluations of one's self and one's past life; Ryff
& Keyes, 1995). Theorizing on concern for others as a foun-
dation for continued growth and development in adulthood
(Maslow, 1971), as well as for the acceptance of one's self
(Underwood, 2005), suggests the importance of examining
these particular dimensions of psychological well-being.
Hypotheses
Building from the above-reviewed scholarship, this study
examined the following hypotheses (H) and research ques-
tions (RQ):
H1:Adults who experience more severe functional decline
will report greater losses in psychological well-being than
adults who experience less functional decline. H2: Adults
who report greater felt obligation to help others (close
others and society) will report fewer losses in psychologi-
cal well-being than adults who report less felt obligation to
help others. H3: Reports of greater felt obligation to help
others will beneficially moderate problematic associations
between more severe functional decline and greater losses
in psychological well-being.
RQ1: Do associations between functional decline and
psychological well-being vary by age? RQ2: Do associa-
tions between felt obligation to help others and psycho-
logical well-being vary by age? RQ3: Does the extent to
which greater felt obligation to help others protect against
losses in psychological well-being following more severe
functional decline vary by age?
Method
This study used data from the National Survey of Midlife
in the U.S. (MIDUS). The MIDUS national probability
sample included English-speaking, noninstitutionalized
adults who were between the ages of 25 and 74 years in
1995 (Time 1 [T1]). The sample was obtained through ran-
dom digit dialing. Once a household was recruited into the
study, a participant from the household was randomly se-
lected, with older adults and men oversampled to ensure an
adequate distribution on the cross-classification of age and
gender. At T1, respondents were asked to complete a 30-
min telephone survey, followed by a lengthier self-adminis-
tered, mail-back questionnaire. A total of 3,024 in the
MIDUS national probability sample responded to both the
telephone survey and self-administered questionnaire
(60.8% response rate), and 1,748 respondents completed a
follow-up telephone survey and self-administered question-
naire in 2004­2005 (Time 2 [T2], approximately 62% of the
respondents who participated in both the telephone survey
and self-administered questionnaire at T1 who had not been
confirmed deceased as of December, 2005). For a detailed
technical report regarding the MIDUS study, see http://mid

FELT OBLIGATION AS A PROTECTIVE FACTOR 725
To limit this study's sample to respondents in middle and
later life (Moen & Wethington, 1999), the analytic subsam-
ple was restricted to respondents who were at least 35 years
old at T1, which excluded 306 respondents. To conduct pro-
spective analyses regarding the psychological consequences
of declining functional health, the analytic subsample was
further restricted to respondents who reported no functional
limitations at T1 (which excluded an additional 593 respon-
dents; see measure of functional decline subsequently).
These restrictions yielded a total sample size of 849 respon-
dents. About one third of the analytic sample at T1 was be-
tween the ages of 35 and 44 years, 36% was between the
ages of 45 and 54 years, 22% was between the ages of 55 and
65 years, and 8% was between the ages of 65 and 74 years.
Measures
Negative affect.--A six-item scale new to the MIDUS
was used to measure respondents' experiences of negative
mood and emotion, or negative affect (Mroczek & Kolarz,
1998). In the self-administered questionnaires at T1 and T2,
respondents were asked how much of the time during the
past 30 days they felt: (a) so sad nothing could cheer them
up, (b) nervous, (c) restless or fidgety, (d) hopeless, (e) that
everything was an effort, and (f) worthless. Respondents re-
ported their experiences with each of these indicators using
a 5-point scale (1 = all of the time; 5 = none of the time).
Scores on items were reverse coded and averaged such that
higher scores indicated more negative affect. Cronbach's
alpha for this index was .84 and .82 at T1 and T2, respec-
tively. Table 1 displays descriptive statistics for this and all
other analytic variables.
Personal growth and self-acceptance.--The self-
administered questionnaires at T1 and T2 included indices to
assess personal growth and self-acceptance (Ryff & Keyes,
1995). Ryff (1989) developed these indices as part of a larger
measurement index on psychological well-being, construct-
ing items based on theories of optimal human development
and mental health. Respondents reported the degree to which
they agreed or disagreed with statements on a seven-point
continuum. A sample item for the measure of personal
growth included "For me, life has been a continuous process
of learning, changing, and growth." A sample item for the
measure of self-acceptance included "When I look at the
story of my life, I am pleased with how things have turned
out." Out of consideration for survey instrument length,
three-item scales were used at T1 and seven-item scales were
used at T2. Scores across items for each subscale were aver-
aged such that higher scores indicated more personal growth
or self-acceptance. Cronbach's alpha for the personal growth
index was .55 at T1 and .76 at T2, and Cronbach's alpha for
the self-acceptance index was .59 at T1 and .85 at T2.
Functional decline.--In the self-administered question-
naires at T1 and T2, respondents were asked to indicate on a
4-point scale how much their health limits them when per-
forming various tasks, including lifting or carrying grocer-
ies, bathing or dressing oneself, walking one block, walking
several blocks, and climbing one flight of stairs (Lachman &
Weaver, 1998). To allow for this study's prospective, longi-
tudinal design, respondents who reported any degree of
limitation at T1 were excluded from the analytic sample.
Among remaining respondents, scores across the five items
at T2 were reverse coded and averaged such that higher
scores indicated more severe functional decline between T1
and T2. Cronbach's alpha for this scale at T2 was .88.
Felt obligation to help others.--Following previous stud-
ies' distinctions between individuals' orientation to helping

close others versus non­close others (Sprecher & Fehr,
2005), this study examined felt obligation to help others
within two domains of social relationships: close others
(which includes relationships with family and friends) and
society as a whole. Measures of felt obligation in these two
domains were collected by employing Rossi's (2001) indi-
ces of normative obligation to close others and society.
These items, which were included only at T1 of the survey,
assess the strength of respondents' internalized norms to
help others at some expense to themselves.
Respondents were introduced to the items as a list of
"hypothetical situations" and were asked to "rate how
much obligation you would feel if they happened to you
using a 0 to 10 scale where 0 means `no obligation at all'
and 10 means `a very great obligation'." Items assessing
felt obligation to help close others included the following:
(a) to drop your plans when your children seem very trou-
bled; (b) to drop your plans when your spouse seems very
troubled; (c) to take a friend into your home who could
not afford to live alone; (d) to give money to a friend in
need, even if this made it hard to meet your own needs; (e)
to raise the child of a close friend if the friend died; and
(f) to take your divorced or unemployed adult child back
into your home. Items assessing felt obligation to help so-
ciety included the following: (a) to pay more for your
health care so that everyone had access to health care, (b)
to volunteer time or money to social causes you support,
(c) to collect contributions for heart or cancer research if
asked to do so, and (d) to vote for a law that would help
others worse off than you but would increase your taxes.
Cronbach's alphas for the indices regarding felt obliga-
tion to close others and to society were .80 and .81, re-
spectively, and the correlation between scores on the two
scales was .49.
Sociodemographic variables and other covariates.--
Given findings from previous studies indicating that a vari-
ety of sociodemographic factors are associated with
functional decline (e.g., Zimmer & House, 2003), felt obli-
gation to help others (e.g., Marks & Song, 2009), and psy-
chological well-being (e.g., Mroczek & Kolarz, 1998; Ryff
& Keyes, 1995), this study included measures of several so-
ciodemographic variables as covariates in multivariate models
(see Data Analytic Sequence). These measures--which were
assessed at T1--included a continuous variable for respon-
dents' age, a dichotomous variable for gender, a multicate-
gorical variable for race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic White,
African American, Latina/o, and other race/ethnicity), a
multicategorical variable for educational attainment (less
than 12, 12, 13­15, and 16 or more years), a continuous
measure of household income, a dichotomous variable for
marital status (married vs. not), a dichotomous variable for
employment status (employed vs. not), and a dichotomous
measure for parental status (has at least one biological or
adopted child vs. not).
Furthermore, to investigate associations between felt
obligation and psychological well-being net of other psy-
chobehavioral and childhood factors associated with felt
obligation (Rossi, 2001) and functional limitations (e.g., Li
& Ferraro, 2006), as well as psychological well-being (e.g.,
Musick & Wilson, 2003), this study included an additional
set of statistical controls measured at T1. These variables
included a continuous measure of respondents' frequency
of religious service attendance (1 = never; 4 = more than
once a week), a dichotomous measure indicating whether
respondents engaged in formal volunteer work within the
past year, and a continuous measure of respondents' contact
with friends and family outside of their household (0 = never
or hardly ever; 7 = several times a day). Scores on two ad-
ditional scales were used to measure personality character-
istics that have been found to be correlated with felt
obligation, including a five-item index of agreeableness
(Cronbach's alpha = .81) and a five-item index of agency
(Cronbach's alpha = .82; Lachman & Weaver, 1997). Fi-
nally, this study included statistical controls for respon-
dents' retrospective reports of three aspects of their
childhood family background (Rossi), including a four-item
index regarding the extent to which their mothers and fa-
thers were generous toward others (e.g., "How generous
and helpful was [your mother] to people outside the fam-
ily?"; Cronbach's alpha = .75), a 12-item index of mothers'
and fathers' affection toward respondents in childhood (e.g.,
"How much love and affection did [your mother] give you?";
Cronbach's alpha = .91), and a four-item index of mothers'
and fathers' use of rules (e.g., "How strict was [your mother]
with rules for you?"; Cronbach's alpha = .81).
Data Analytic Sequence
This study estimated a series of ordinary least squares
(OLS) models to examine its hypotheses and research ques-
tions. Each of the T2 measures of psychological well-being
(negative affect, personal growth, and self-acceptance) was
regressed on the complete block of covariates, as well as on
the corollary measure of psychological well-being at T1.
Scores on psychological well-being, functional decline,
age, and felt obligation to help close others and society were
standardized at their means for ease of interpretation. OLS
models employed listwise deletion for missing data; no
more than 2% of the analytic sample was missing on any
one variable, and less than 10% of the sample was missing
across all variables.
To test H1 regarding more severe functional decline as a
risk factor for losses in psychological well-being, as well as
H2 regarding linkages between higher levels of felt obliga-
tion and psychological well-being, Model 1 was estimated
in which each dimension of psychological well-being was
regressed on functional decline between T1 and T2 as well
as on felt obligation to help close others and society. To ex-
plore RQ1 and RQ2 regarding potential age differences in
FELT OBLIGATION AS A PROTECTIVE FACTOR 727
these associations, additional models were estimated that
added each two-way interaction term, including Age ×
Functional limitations (Model 2), Age × Felt obligation to
help close others (Model 3), and Age × Felt obligation to
help society (Model 4). To test H3 regarding felt obligation
as a protective factor against associations of risk between
functional decline and more rapidly declining psychologi-
cal well-being, Models 3 and 4 also included two-way inter-
action terms between functional decline and each of
measures of felt obligation. To explore RQ3, Models 5 and
6 were estimated that added three-way interaction terms
among functional decline, age, and each respective measure
of felt obligation to help others. To interpret the highest or-
der statistically significant interaction terms, predicted
scores were calculated for estimated average change in the
given aspect of psychological well-being among relevant
subgroups of respondents. The baseline model included re-
spondents in the reference categories on categorical mea-
sures of covariates and at the sample mean on continuous
measures of covariates.
Results
Functional Decline and Psychological Well-being
Models 1 in Tables 2­4 indicate that respondents who
reported more severe functional decline between T1 and T2
also reported greater increases in negative affect (b = .25,
p < .001), greater decreases in personal growth (b = -.11,
p < .001), and greater decreases in self-acceptance (b =
-.07, p < .01). Models 2 in Tables 2­4 provide no evidence
for statistically significant interaction terms between func-
tional decline and age (for negative affect, b = -.04, ns;
for personal growth, b = -.00, ns; and for self-acceptance,
b = .04, ns). In summary, these results provide consistent
evidence that functional decline is a risk factor for greater
losses in psychological well-being (H1), and results provide
no evidence that such associations differ by age (RQ1).
Felt Obligation to Help Others and Psychological
Well-being
Models 1 in Tables 2­4 provide no evidence of associa-
tions between greater felt obligation to help close others at
T1 and change in any of the three dimensions of psycho-
logical well-being (for negative affect, b = .04, ns; for
personal growth, b = -.00, ns; and for self-acceptance,
b = -.03, ns). Moreover, reports of greater felt obligation
to help society also were not associated with change in any
of the three dimensions of psychological well-being (for
negative affect, b = -.05, ns; for personal growth, b = .06,
ns; and for self-acceptance, b = .01, ns). Furthermore,
Models 3 and 4 in Tables 2­4 provide no evidence for sta-
tistically significant two-way interaction terms between
age and felt obligation to help close others (negative affect,
b = -.01, ns; personal growth, b = .04, ns; and self-acceptance,
b = .01, ns), nor evidence for statistically significant inter-
action terms between age and felt obligation to help soci-
ety (negative affect, b = .02, ns; personal growth, b = .01,
ns; and self-acceptance, b = -.04, ns). In summary, these
results provide no evidence that felt obligation to help oth-
ers is associated with changes in psychological well-being
(H2), as well as no evidence that such associations differ
by age (RQ2).
Felt Obligation to Help Others as a Protective Factor
Models 3 and 4 in Tables 2­4 display results regarding
felt obligation to help close others, as well as to society, as
protective factors against more rapidly declining psycho-
logical well-being in the face of functional decline. Al-
though the interaction of Functional decline × Felt
obligation to help close others did not achieve statistical
significance in the model for self-acceptance (b = .05, ns),
the interaction did achieve statistical significance in the
model for negative affect (b = -.07, p < .05, but note the
three-way age interaction reported subsequently) and per-
sonal growth (b = .06, p < .05). Moreover, the interaction of
Functional decline × Felt obligation to help society did not
achieve statistical significance in the model for negative af-
fect (b = -.05, ns, but note the three-way age interaction
reported subsequently), but the interaction did achieve sta-
tistical significance in models with respect to personal
growth (b = .07, p < .01) and self-acceptance (b = .07,
p < .05).
Models 5 and 6 in Tables 2­4 display results with respect
to RQ3 regarding the influence of age on the extent to which
greater felt obligation to help others protects against losses
in psychological well-being in the face of more severe func-
tional decline. The three-way interaction among age, func-
tional decline, and felt obligation to help close others
achieved statistical significance in the model for negative
affect (b = .07, p < .05), but not in the models for personal
growth (b = .02, ns) or self-acceptance (b = -.06, ns). Simi-
larly, the three-way interaction among age, functional de-
cline, and felt obligation to help society also achieved
statistical significance in the model for negative affect
(b = .07, p < .05), but not in the models for personal growth
(b = .02, ns) or self-acceptance (b = -.06, ns).
Figures 1 and 2, respectively, display predicted scores re-
garding the three-way interactions that achieved statistical
significance in Models 5 and 6 for negative affect. Both fig-
ures indicate that among adults one standard deviation be-
low the sample mean on age (i.e., adults aged 40 years at
T1) and with lower levels of felt obligation to help close
others or society, a standard deviation increase in functional
decline was associated with nearly a half of a standard de-
viation greater predicted increase in negative affect. Among
adults aged 40 years at T1 and with higher levels of felt
obligation to help close others or society, a standard devia-
tion increase in functional decline was associated with only
GREENFIELD
728
about one fifth of a standard deviation greater predicted in-
crease in negative affect. Among adults one standard devia-
tion above the sample mean on age (i.e., adults aged 59
years at T1), a standard deviation increase in functional de-
cline was associated with about one fifth of a standard de-
viation greater predicted increase in negative affect
regardless of felt obligation to help close others or society.
Figures 3­5 display predicted scores with respect to the
two-way interaction terms that achieved statistical signifi-
cance (Table 3, Models 3 and 4; Table 4, Model 4). Figure 3
indicates that predicted decreases in personal growth among
respondents who reported more severe functional decline
were 64% larger among respondents who reported lower
levels of felt obligation to help close others in contrast to

respondents who reported higher levels of felt obligation to
help close others. Figure 4 indicates that among respondents
low on felt obligation to help society, predicted decreases in
personal growth among respondents who reported more se-
vere functional decline were 76% larger than predicted de-
creases in personal growth among respondents who reported
greater felt obligation to help society. Furthermore, Figure 5
indicates that predicted decreases in self-acceptance among
respondents who reported more severe functional decline
were 89% larger among respondents who reported lower lev-
els of felt obligation to help society in contrast to respondents
who reported higher levels of felt obligation to help society.
In summary, these results provide some evidence in sup-
port of greater felt obligation to help others as a protective
factor against declining personal growth and self-acceptance
following more severe functional decline. These results also
provide evidence in support of greater felt obligation to help
others as a protective factor against increasing negative af-
fect following more severe functional decline among
younger adults.

Discussion
The purpose of this study was to examine felt obligation
to help others within two domains (close others and society)
as protective factors against losses in psychological well-
being following functional decline and to examine differ-
ences by age. Results provided evidence in support of felt
obligation to help society as a protective factor against
losses in personal growth and self-acceptance, as well as
felt obligation to help close others as a protective factor
against losses in personal growth. Also, younger adults re-
ported a smaller increase in negative affect following more
severe function decline if they reported greater felt obliga-
tion to help close others and/or society.
This evidence for felt obligation to help others as a pro-
tective factor against losses in psychological well-being fol-
lowing greater functional decline supports expanded
conceptualizations of ways in which social relationships
can influence individuals' psychological well-being. A
longstanding body of work has addressed the mental health
benefits of receiving others' support, particularly during
times of stress (Uchino, 2004). Parallel to this area of re-
search, a more recent body of scholarship has emerged re-
garding the potential mental health benefits of giving support
to others (e.g., Liang, Krause, & Bennett, 2001; Thoits &
Hewitt, 2001). Findings from this study suggest the impor-
tance of continuing to examine ways in which aspects of
altruism, such as felt obligation to help others, can promote
psychological well-being not only among adults in general
but also particularly among those adults confronting par-
ticular challenges, such as declining functional health (for
other examples, see Brown, Brown, House, & Smith, 2008;
Li & Ferraro, 2007; Greenfield & Marks, 2004).
Findings from qualitative studies on experiences of com-
passionate love provide insights on processes through which
felt obligation can protect against losses in psychological
well-being following functional decline, such as by encourag-
ing individuals' sense of connection and a universalistic orien-
tation(Underwood,2002).Theorizingonhowmorebehavioral
aspects of altruism--such as formal volunteering--promote
psychological well-being has largely addressed other, yet re-
lated, factors, including self-efficacy and self-esteem (Thoits
& Hewitt, 2001). Studies that employ more refined measures
of various and theoretically informed aspects of altruism, as
well as of psychosocial factors linking these aspects to psy-
chological well-being, and that use data analytic techniques to
model these factors as being related-yet-distinct from each
other can help to better specify the complex causal pathways
among various aspects of altruism, other psychosocial factors,
functional health, and psychological well-being.
This study also tested for age differences in its focal associa-
tions. Results indicated that felt obligation to help close others
and/or society served as stronger protective factors against
increasing negative affect following functional decline among
younger adults. This finding, in part, is consistent with classic
developmental theorizing, which suggests that concern for the
welfare of others--particularly concern for future genera-
tions--is particularly salient in midlife relative to earlier and
later periods of the life course (e.g., Erikson, 1950). Neverthe-
less, empirical evidence regarding the extent to which concern
for others is most central in midlife has been mixed (see
McAdams, 2001, for a review). This study's finding of some
age-associated differences in the protective effects of felt obli-
gation to help others suggests continued focus on lifespan con-
texts that might alter ways in which functional decline and
various dimensions of altruism are associated with psychologi-
cal well-being. The finding of a weaker protective effect with
increasing age, specifically in terms of negative affect and not
personal growth or self-acceptance, suggests the importance of
considering multiple dimensions of psychological well-being
within lifespan research on altruism and well-being.

Despite this study's evidence for felt obligation to help
others as a protective factor against losses in psychological
well-being following functional decline, several of its fea-
tures limit the extent to which conclusions can be drawn.
First, this study draws on theorizing on compassionate love
to specify processes through which felt obligation to help
others might buffer against losses in psychological well-
being following functional decline.Accordingly, additional
studies that utilize direct measures of compassionate love
(see Fehr & Sprecher, 2009, for an example) are necessary
to examine the extent to which aspects of compassionate
love account for the protective effects found and to advance
understanding of processes underlying these associations.
Also, because the measure of felt obligation was included
only at the first wave of the survey, this study was not able
to account for potentially dynamic changes in felt obliga-
tion, which might, in part, be a function of changes in psy-
chological well-being and functional health. Similarly,
because functional health was assessed only at the begin-
ning and end of a 10-year interval, this study was unable to
include a more nuanced measure of dynamic trajectories of
functional limitations and psychological well-being. (The
10-year interval between measurement occasions might
also help to account for the relatively small sizes of associa-
tions among functional decline, felt obligation to help oth-
ers, and psychological well-being.) Overall, research that
collects measures of functional health, felt obligation, and
psychological well-being at multiple time points is neces-
sary for better understanding the sequencing of causal pro-
cesses linking these experiences. An additional limitation is
the potential for nonrandom response at T1 of the survey, as
well as nonrandom attrition across the 10-year study period,
to bias estimates of population parameters (Acock, 2005).
Despite these limitations, this study suggests the impor-
tance of additional research on how felt obligation to help
others and other aspects of altruism can protect against losses
in psychological well-being following functional decline.
For example, although previous research has identified pre-
dictors of aspects of altruism within the U.S. adult population
as a whole (Smith, 2009), studies are necessary to understand
processes toward orientations to help others among individu-
als with impaired functional health. Additional studies are
also necessary to identify the potentially complex processes
through which felt obligation to help others promotes psy-
chological well-being in the face of functional decline--par-
ticularly at diverse ages throughout adulthood. Advancing
such understanding can help better inform efforts to optimize
life quality among adults with functional impairments.
