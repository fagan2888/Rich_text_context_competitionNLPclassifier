India occupies the fifth position in the vegetable oil economy of the world. The demand
for oilseeds and vegetable oil has far exceeded the domestic output necessitating huge
imports. Futures market helps to bring price stability for the development of the under-
lying physical market. The present study investigates the volatility dynamics in spot
and futures markets of select oil and oilseeds commodities.
The objectives of this article are to study (a) the information transmission process
between spot and futures markets, also called volatility spillover and (b) the impact of
futures trading activity on the volatility of physical market prices.
The commodities selected from oil and oilseeds segment are refined soya oil, mustard
seed, crude palm oil, and mentha oil. The study uses basic Generalized Autoregressive
Conditional Heteroscedasticity (GARCH) model to capture volatility in prices of the
selected commodities. Bivariate GARCH model makes use of information in the history
of two different markets for testing volatility spillover between two markets of the same
underlying commodity.
The relationship between futures trading activity and spot price volatility is investi-
gated for examining the impact of futures trading activity on the volatility of underlying
spot market. Two variables, viz., futures trading volume and open interest are decom-
posed into expected and unexpected components and are taken as a proxy for the level
of trading activity. The contemporaneous and dynamic relationships are studied with
the help of augmented GARCH model and Granger causality, respectively.
It is observed that there is an efficient transmission of information between spot and
futures markets but it is the spot market which leads to the flow of information to futures
and hence causes greater spillover of volatility. The spot market has a greater impact on
the volatility of futures market, indicating that informational efficiency of oilseeds spot
market is stronger than that of the futures market.
The contemporaneous and dynamic relationship between spot price volatility and
futures trading activity tested with econometric models provide evidence of the dest-
abilizing impact of an unexpected increase in futures trading activity (volume or open
interest) on the spot price volatility in three out of four commodities studied. This indi-
cates that badly informed traders present in futures market are destabilizing the under-
lying spot market by inducing noise and lowering the information content of prices.

Edible oil and oilseeds sector occupies an impor-
tant position in the agricultural economy of
India. Moreover, India holds the fifth position
in the vegetable oil economy of the world, next only
to USA, China, Brazil, and Argentina. The demand
for edible and non-edible oil is increasing due to
the growing Indian population, rising income, and
expanding urbanization. The domestic demand for
vegetable oils has increased more than the domestic
output, leading to a rise in the import bill. According to
a data collected by the Solvent Extractors' Association
of India, from November 2011 to October 2012, edible
oils worth INR 562.95 billion were imported consti-
tuting about half of India's total edible oil consump-
tion (Gulati, 2013).The import bill has increased by 380
per cent from 2006­2007 to 2011­2012, resulting in a
huge current account deficit. At the end of the 12th Five
Year Plan, the edible oil requirement of the country is
expected to be 16.34 million tonnes while the produc-
tion is estimated at 10.55 million tonnes in 2016­2017.
The gap of 5.79 million tonnes in 2016­2017 will be met
through imports (Jha et al., 2012).
At present, oilseeds account for 13 per cent of the gross
cropped area, 3 per cent of the gross national product,
and 10 per cent value of all agricultural commodi-
ties (Ramanathan, 2001). Crude palm oil and Refined,
Bleached and Deodorized (RBD) palm oil together
constitute 77 per cent of our consumption while the
share of soya bean oil is 12 per cent. Despite being one
of the largest oilseeds producers in the world, 50 per
cent of India's domestic requirement is met through
imports. Prices of edible oils in the international market
are more competitive. This together with nearly duty-
free import structure has facilitated larger imports in
India. Imports have also increased the per capita avail-
ability of edible oils from 5.8 kg in 1992­1993 to 14.5 kg
in 2010­2011 (Bose, 2013).
The growth rate of domestic oilseeds production has
been a meagre two per cent, year on year (Jha et al.,
2012). The oilseeds industry faces challenges in terms
of institutional and technological barriers. Cultivation
of oilseeds is dependent on rainfall due to which there
is high instability in production. Because of this uncer-
tainty, it is cultivated on marginal lands which further
leads to low yields. The problem is aggravated by the
absence of technological advancement to develop high-
yielding varieties of oilseeds. The domestic prices of
oilseeds and edible oils are un-remunerative for farmers
and the sector has been sustaining on government
subsidies. Unless substantial improvement is brought
about in yields and processing of oilseeds, facilitated
with conducive trade policies, India's dependence on
imports is likely to be high.
On the global front, as per the OECD-FAO (2011) projec-
tions, prices in oilseeds complex will continue to trend
upwards due to tightening in global supplies caused
by high marginal cost of area expansion, profitability
of competing crops, and environmental constraints.
On the other hand, resumption in demand after the
global economic crisis and robust buying by importing
countries has resulted in wide demand-supply gap
and fall in global stock to use ratio. It is estimated that
the developing countries in Asia, mainly China, will
continue to show an increase in vegetable oil consump-
tion. Growth in consumption of vegetable oils in China
and India is primarily for food use whereas in the US
and the EU, biodiesel industry will be the main demand
driver. Biodiesel production is expected to account for
16 per cent of the total consumption of vegetable oils.
Hence, fundamental constraints of demand and supply
mismatch, along with technological, environmental,
and other social challenges faced by the oilseeds
commodity chain have put pressure on the govern-
ment, traders, and investors to combat expected price
volatility and take appropriate measures for a more
robust oilseeds sector. Local market prices are under
pressure due to low stocks, anaemic domestic produc-
tion, and dependence on imports.
The government has tried to bring price stability
through market intervention. But such practices create
uncertainties for cultivators and traders with respect
to long-term strategies and ultimately affect the price
structure of oilseeds relative to their competing crops.
Therefore, forward-looking policies are needed to
encourage stakeholders to continue cultivation and
trading. Among other reforms, price risk mitigation
instruments in the form of derivative contracts go a
long way in improving the status of the stakeholders.
The introduction of futures trading in oilseeds segment
has resulted in better price realization to the farmers.
Oilseeds futures contracts are the most liquid counters
on commodity bourses. However, the impact of futures
trading on the volatility of the underlying spot market
is a debatable issue since on many occasions physical
market prices have exhibited heightened volatility in
the presence of high trading volume in futures market.
The present study investigates the volatility dynamics
of spot and the futures market of select oil and oilseeds
134 VOLATILITY DYNAMICS IN OIL AND OILSEEDS SPOT AND FUTURES MARKET IN INDIA
commodities. Theoretically, speculative activity in the
futures market is purported to have two opposing
effects on the spot price volatility:
Futures Trading Stabilizes Spot Market Prices
Spot traders are able to hedge their positions only
because of additional liquidity that comes from the
speculators present in the futures market. Additional
liquidity in futures market reduces the impact cost or
the cost of executing a transaction since the buyers
and sellers constantly have opportunities for buying
and selling in the futures market at a reasonable cost.
In the absence of liquidity, they face high transaction
cost. A liquid futures market enables traders with
physical possession of the commodity to hedge against
unfavourable movements in prices. The risk is trans-
ferred from hedgers to speculators who are willing to
take the risk to earn more profits. Since risk is trans-
ferred, spot price volatility may reduce because the
need to incorporate risk premium in spot prices is elim-
inated (Figlewski, 1981). Speculation in futures market
will not destabilize the prices if the speculators are a
well-informed lot. They will buy when the prices are
low, pushing them up, and sell when the prices are
high, pulling them down and eventually lead the prices
to their mean level. Therefore, such profitable specula-
tion reduces spot market volatility.
Futures Trading Destabilizes Spot Market Prices
Futures trading may be considered to increase spot
price volatility because any news about changes in
fundamentals is assimilated in futures prices more
readily as they are more informationally efficient.
Through the arbitrage process, the price changes are
transmitted to the spot market of the same underlying
causing the volatility to increase. The presence of unin-
formed speculators brings in herd behaviour in the
markets making them more volatile. Market manip-
ulation and fraudulent activities are easier to perpe-
trate in futures market. By building large positions in
futures markets, speculators are able to capture the
market and manipulate and influence future price.
Formation of cartels and trading through related enti-
ties is also prevalent wherein futures market players
collude with spot market traders and hoard physical
stocks. It creates artificial scarcity of the commodity
resulting in price distortion.
Volatility and Information: Study of Volatility
Spillover
The volatility of asset prices is also related to the infor-
mation flow in the market. Spot price volatility is bound
to change if the informationally efficient futures market
increases transmission of information. The volatility
in returns manifests that information is flowing in the
market. The increase in spot price volatility in the pres-
ence of futures trading reflects that there is improved
flow of information brought about by a large number of
traders and speculators participating in futures market.
If futures market leads in the process of transmission
of information, it will cause spillover of volatility to
the spot market. In this context, the reverse is also true
if spot market is more efficient in the transmission of
information.
Indian futures markets have faced allegations due to
its destabilizing impact on the physical market vola-
tility, especially in 2006­2007, when futures trading of
a few agricultural commodities (wheat, urad, tur, and
rice) were suspended due to increase in food grain
inflation during that period. Since futures trading has
been blamed for increasing the spot price volatility, the
following issues have been empirically investigated in
the present study:
1. Volatility spillover from futures to spot market or
vice versa.
2. Impact of futures trading activity on spot price
volatility by examining the relationship between
spot price volatility, futures trading volume, and
open interest.
LITERATURE REVIEW
The diverse views on the impact of futures market
volatility on the volatility of spot markets have been
explored by academicians, researchers, and policy
makers to evaluate the past performance and chart
the path for a more efficient and vibrant derivatives
markets of commodities and financial products. Studies
which have made a notable contribution in this area are
discussed briefly.
Volatility Spillover
When volatility of one market influences the volatility
of another market, volatility spillover occurs. It helps
in identifying the market which leads to the assimila-
tion of information and transmission of the information
VIKALPA · VOLUME 41 · ISSUE 2 · APRIL-JUNE 2016 135
to the other market. With increased inflow of informa-
tion in one market, its volatility increases, and due to the
arbitrage process, volatility spills over to the other
related market. Liao and Williams (2004) pointed out
that news or volatility is transmitted through two chan-
nels. The first is the increase in the volatility of variance
of returns or price changes and the second is the increase
in volatility of variance of forecast error or noise.
Volatility spillovers from one market to another occur
because of the fact that speculative price changes are
linked with higher moment dependencies (Bollerslev,
Chou, & Kroner, 1992). According to Chan, Chan, and
Karolyi (1991), volatility spillovers can provide an alter-
native measure of information transmission if the return
analysis becomes inconclusive. Therefore, the study
of the relationship between spot and futures returns
(first moment) is expanding towards examining higher
moment dependencies in the form of time varying spill-
over of volatility between markets through which the
impact of one market on another can be assessed. The
hypothesis in volatility spillovers is to test the lead­lag
relation in volatilities of two or more markets.
Research on how volatility of one market affects the
process of the volatility of another market, that is, the
study of the volatility spillover effect, has made use of
GARCH family models which best capture the time
varying nature of volatility in financial markets. Named
as `meteor showers', the theory of volatility spillovers
between markets based on GARCH models was intro-
duced by Engle, Ito, and Lin (1990). Chan et al. (1991)
studied the intraday volatility spillover between S & P
500 stock index and stock index futures market using
bivariate GARCH model. Strong dependence in the
volatility of price changes in cash and futures market
was observed in their study as compared to dependence
in price changes themselves. Though the relationship
between cash to futures returns provided some predict-
ability, a stronger relationship was observed between
cash market and futures market volatility. The results
have an important implication that due to inter-market
volatility dependence, it is possible to predict the vola-
tility of a market on the basis of price innovations or
shocks that originate in the other market. Koutmos
and Tucker (1996) applied the Exponential GARCH
(EGARCH) model to daily data to study volatility spill-
over and asymmetric effect of volatility. Their findings
indicated that volatility spillover was from futures to
spot market and in both markets volatility increased
more with bad news compared to good news. Spot
market innovations had no impact on futures market.
Tse (1999) observed bidirectional volatility spillover in
Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) spot and futures
market on analysing minute by minute data using the
bivariate EGARCH model. However, DJIA futures
exhibited greater informational efficiency as spillover
was more from futures to spot market.
Mukherjee and Mishra (2006) studied volatility spill-
over in Nifty spot and futures index market in India
and examined whether there was any variation in the
relationship at the time of the release of macroeco-
nomic and firm-specific information. The authors intro-
duced a dummy variable representing the release of
different information, for example, activities of Foreign
Institutional Investors (FIIs), Mutual Funds (MFs) or
asset acquisition and disposal. The results exhibited
that in general there was bi-directional volatility spill-
over but the direction of causality was stronger from
spot to futures market. The analysis of the impact of
the release of firm-specific information on the lead­
lag relationship in volatility of NIFTY spot and futures
index indicated that the leading role of futures market
was weak after the release of firm-specific informa-
tion. In order to capture the asymmetric behaviour
of volatility and test the volatility spillover effect on
individual stocks and their futures traded on NSE,
EGARCH model was applied by Mallikarjunappa and
Afsal (2010). Their study reported findings similar to
Karmakar (2009) that both markets were information
efficient but futures market caused greater volatility
spillover to spot market for the majority of stocks.
However, for a few stocks, the reverse was true.
Understanding of the volatility transmission process
in commodities helps the decision makers in devising
new risk-management strategies. The information
transmission process between Malaysian crude palm
oil futures and its cash market at mean and volatility
level during 1990-2003 was tested by Azizan, Ahmad,
and Shannon (2007) using bivariate Autoregressive
Moving Average EGARCH (ARMA-EGARCH) model.
The analysis revealed bidirectional volatility spillover
between futures and cash market with the impact from
futures to cash being stronger than cash to futures.
Bidirectional volatility spillover in crude oil futures and
cash market was also reported in studies by Chan et
al. (1991), Lin, Chen, Hwang, and Lin (2002), Yu (2000),
and Yakob (2005).
Adopting similar methodology, Mahalik, Acharya, and
Babu (2009) examined volatility spillover in four spot
and futures indices of Multi Commodities Exchange
(MCX), namely agriculture, energy, metal futures price
136 VOLATILITY DYNAMICS IN OIL AND OILSEEDS SPOT AND FUTURES MARKET IN INDIA
index, and aggregate commodity index from 2005 to
2008. The results of bivariate EGARCH for testing vola-
tility spillover gave an indication of bidirectional vola-
tility spillover with greater strength from futures to spot
market for metal, energy, and aggregate commodity
index. However, in the case of agriculture index, spot
market was a source of volatility for futures market
pointing to the fact that agriculture futures market was
not being used by farmers because of lack of incentives,
low quality of technology, or risk of relying on unjusti-
fied rising prices perpetrated by speculators. This was
contrary to the results of volatility spillover studied by
Srinivasan and Ibrahim (2012) on similar indices. Using
similar bivariate EGARCH model, it was observed
that there was a stronger volatility spillover from spot
to futures markets represented by agriculture, metal,
energy, and composite commodity indices and, there-
fore, traders in futures market would have to watch
out for the volatility in the spot market. Srinivasan and
Ibrahim (2012) applied the same methodology on gold
spot and futures and revealed a greater ability of gold
spot market in exposing new information through its
channels of innovation, and at the same time, pointing
to less effectiveness of futures market in disseminating
new information. Shihabudheen and Padhi (2010)
tested volatility spillover on highly liquid commodi-
ties traded on MCX and NCDEX including gold, silver,
crude oil, castor seed, jeera (cumin seed), and sugar.
Except for sugar, in all other commodities, the direction
of volatility spillover was from futures to spot market.
Low trading volume in sugar contract was likely to
have caused lack of transmission of information from
futures to the spot market. Dey, Maitra, and Roy (2011)
found evidence of bidirectional volatility spillover
with a greater spill from spot to futures. In the Indian
context, except for a few exceptions, spot market has
been found to be dominant in the majority of studies on
agricultural commodities.
Impact of Futures Trading Activity on Spot Price
Volatility
Earlier studies on the impact of futures trading on cash
price volatility focused on the paradigm of the introduc-
tion of futures trading. They compared cash price vola-
tility before and after the introduction of futures trading
(Gulen & Mayhew, 2000). However, market behaviour
is influenced by a number of factors and so it is wrong
to attribute the differences in market behaviour pre-
and post-futures to the presence of futures market. As
pointed out by Stein (1987), the impact of more or less
speculation from an established futures trading on cash
market volatility is far more relevant to the real world
than to the introduction of futures market. Researchers
like Bessembinder and Seguin (1992) and Adrangi and
Chatrath (1998) examined the issue in a different manner
and analysed how the level of futures trading activity
(futures trading volume and open interest) affected the
volatility of cash market prices.
Figlewski (1981) modelled the volatility in Government
National Mortgage Association (GNMA) pass-through
certificates, cash prices by incorporating factors like
volatility in related markets, futures market activity in
the form of open interest and current trading volume,
GNMA prices, liquidity, and breadth of GNMA cash
market. By performing simple regression analysis,
evidence was found that increased liquidity, volume
of cash market activity, and lower average prices had
a stabilizing impact on the market whereas futures
market activity increased the price volatility. The
possible explanation for this was that GNMA dealers in
cash market were more informed than the new class of
traders in futures market who were less informed and
less experienced than the spot market dealer. Hence,
the additional noise in futures prices was being trans-
mitted to cash market causing increased volatility.
Bessembinder and Seguin (1992) studied the interrela-
tionship between equity volatility and futures trading
activity along with spot trading volume for S&P 500
index from 1978 to 1989. The components of futures
trading activity which included trading volume and
open interest were separated into unexpected and
expected component using Autoregressive Integrated
Moving Average (ARIMA) (0, 1, 10) formulation.
Regression results for daily S&P 500 return standard
deviation on the spot and future trading volume indi-
cated that equity volatility had a positive relation with
contemporaneous futures trading shocks or the unex-
pected component of futures trading activity, meaning
thereby that heavy trading in futures market is destabi-
lizing. However, there was a negative relation between
expected open interest and expected trading volume
indicating that equity volatility was reduced when
the expected level of trading activity was high. Their
findings that futures trading helped in improving the
depth and liquidity of equity markets were consistent
with the theories such as Grossman (1988). Studies by
Gulen and Mayhew (2000), Gupta and Kumar (2002),
Thenmozhi (2002), and Chen, Han, Li, and Wu (2012)
also found evidence of a decrease in spot index price
volatility after the introduction of index futures.
VIKALPA · VOLUME 41 · ISSUE 2 · APRIL-JUNE 2016 137
Following Bessembinder and Senguin's methodology,
Chatrath, Song, and Adrangi (2003) re-examined the
impact of futures trading activity on spot price volatility
of S&P 500 index. The study found strong evidence of
an increase in price volatility with the increase in partic-
ipation of institutional traders, whereas there was no
evidence of a destabilizing impact of positions held by
speculators and small traders.
The response to trading in commodity futures has
been more intense as compared to equities because
commodity prices are very sensitive for the agricul-
tural and industrial sectors in an economy. Commodity
futures markets, often accused of speculation and
gambling, have faced opposition from various
segments especially the farm sector. Pashigian (1986)
measured geographic opposition from grain traders
towards futures trading and suggested that opposi-
tion had diminished over time. The study by Weaver
and Banerjee (1990) did not support the hypoth-
esis that futures trading led to dynamic instability in
cattle prices, even though it could not be inferred that
they gave stability to cash prices. Yang, Balyeat, and
Leatham (2005) applied the methodology earlier used
by Bessembiner and Senguin (1992) on corn, soya bean,
wheat, cotton, sugar, hogs, and live cattle data from
1992 to 2001. The analysis was restricted to unexpected
futures trading activity since the impact of expected
component was already embedded in the spot prices.
The results indicated that unexpected futures trading
activity (open interest and trading volume) caused
cash price volatility, thus strengthening the ground for
growing criticism towards commodity futures for their
role in aggravating price volatility.
Not many Indian studies have used this methodology
in the commodities market, wherein futures trading
activity is linked to spot volatility. A recent study
by Sehgal, Rajput, and Dua (2012) examined the
period after the setting up of national level commodity
exchanges in India which gave momentum to comm-
odity futures trading. The destabilizing effect of futures
trading activity on spot volatility was indicated by
Granger causality flowing from futures trading activity
to spot volatility for all commodities except pepper
and barley.
Hence, what emerges from the discussion of empir-
ical studies is that though futures trading has been in
existence for many years, its impact on spot volatility
has been inconclusive. A few prominent studies, which
have reported the destabilizing role of futures trading
on spot markets volatility, are by Figlewski (1981),
Chatrath, Ramchander, and Song (1996), Adrangi
and Chatrath (1998), Chatrath et al. (2003), Bhargava
and Malhotra (2007), Yang et al. (2005), and Sehgal et
al. (2012). Some studies have, on the contrary, found
evidence that trading in futures market does not dest-
abilize the spot market (Bohl & Stephan, 2012; Darrat
& Rahman, 1995; Pashigian, 1986; Weaver & Banerjee,
1990). In India, research is still very limited in the area
of agricultural commodities especially oil and oilseeds
segment which makes it all the more pertinent to
explore these issues empirically especially when the
modern research tools are more robust and capable of
capturing the changing trends of market variables.

Daily closing spot and near months futures prices have
been converted into log returns to reduce the effect of
heteroscedasticity. It has been done by taking the first
difference of spot and futures log prices called loga-
rithmic returns. Log transformation by taking first
difference of log prices helps in making a non-stationary
series as stationary and valid conclusions can be drawn
from analysis of stationary data.

138 VOLATILITY DYNAMICS IN OIL AND OILSEEDS SPOT AND FUTURES MARKET IN INDIA
In addition to daily spot and futures prices, data on
futures trading activity has been used to study the
impact of futures trading on spot prices volatility.
Following the methodology adopted by Bessembinder
and Seguin (1992), Darrat and Rahman (1995), and
Yang et al. (2005), the components of futures trading
activity, viz. futures trading volume and open interest
have been used as explanatory variables and their data
is downloaded from the exchange itself. Both these
variables are indicative of the behaviour of futures
market participants. While futures trading volume
reflects movements due to speculators activity, open
interest movements primarily reflect hedgers activity
(Bessembinder & Seguin, 1992; Working, 1962).
If the variables being examined are stationary, that is,
their mean and variance are constant over time, the
regression analysis done would provide time invariant
and efficient estimates. However, most of the macro
economic and financial time series data exhibit random
walks and are found to be non-stationary. Regression
analysis done with non-stationary variables leads
to spurious results which might produce misleading
inferences about the degree of association between the
variables and the estimated parameters. If two-time
series are non-stationary in levels but their first differ-
ences are stationary, they are said to be integrated of
order one and denoted as I(1). The spot and futures
log price series of each commodity are first subject
to Augmented Dickey­Fuller (ADF) test (Dickey &
Fuller, 1979) to determine whether they are I(1). The
test checks for the presence of unit root and if detected,
the log prices are differenced to remove unit root and
make them stationary. This gives spot and futures
return series.
Volatility Spillover: Bivariate GARCH (1, 1) Model
The present study uses basic GARCH model to capture
volatility in prices of the selected commodities. First, an
autoregressive moving average (ARMA) model of spot
and futures return series is formulated. The conditional
mean equation of spot and futures returns has been
specified as an ARMA (p, q) process. An ARMA (p, q)
model associated with Box and Jenkins (1976) is one in
which current value of a dependent variable depends
on its own past values plus the current and past values
of white noise error terms. The autocorrelation and
partial autocorrelation functions of residual from the
model are examined using Ljung Box (LB) Q statistics
developed by Box and Pierce (1970). LB Q statistic tests
whether a series is white noise and is useful in testing
serial dependencies in time. It follows chi-square distri-
bution with the null hypothesis that all autocorrelation
coefficients are zero and there is no autocorrelation.
For volatility analysis, in order to apply GARCH
model, the presence of Autoregressive Conditional
Heteroscedasticity (ARCH) effect is first tested to see
if the data series exhibit features of heteroscedasticity
and volatility clustering. The presence of ARCH effect
connotes autocorrelation in volatility, that is, the condi-
tional variance of error terms depends on the value of
immediately preceding squared error. ARCH effect is
examined with the help of autocorrelation and partial
autocorrelation of the squared residuals from the esti-
mated ARMA (p, q) model. The LB Q statistics of
squared residuals is observed for this. The joint null
hypothesis being, coefficients of all lags of squared
residuals are statistically not different from zero. If the
value of test statistics is greater than the critical value
derived from chi-square distribution, it leads to the
rejection of the null hypothesis of `no autocorrelation
in squared residuals' and hence confirms the presence
of ARCH effect.
ARCH effect in residuals of ARMA(p, q) model has also
been tested with ARCH Lagrange multiplier (LM) test.
If the computed test value exceeds the critical value, it
leads to the rejection of the null hypothesis of `no auto-
correlation' in squared residuals. If ARMA (p, q) model
reports no autocorrelation in residuals and ARCH LM
tests reports the presence of ARCH effect, the authors
further proceed to formulate GARCH (1, 1) model so
that spot and futures price volatility can be modelled.
In the present study, bivariate GARCH (1, 1) model
developed by Bollerslev (1986) has been used as it has
been found to be the most parsimonious representa-
tion of ARCH class of models and acceptability of the
order has been proven empirically in many studies
employing time series data. Higher order GARCH
(p, q) specification very often has many local maxima
and minima and therefore basic GARCH model beats
the higher order models. `GARCH model predicts that
the best indicator of future variance is the weighted
average of long-run variance, the predicted variance
for the current period, and any new information in this
period, as captured by squared residuals' (Engle, 2001).
After formulating GARCH (1, 1) model for each of
the series, ARCH LM test is run again on the resid-
uals of the model to check if the ARCH effect has been
removed by the model. As a part of the diagnostic
VIKALPA · VOLUME 41 · ISSUE 2 · APRIL-JUNE 2016 139
check, LB test is also run on standardized residuals
and squared standardized residuals. If ARCH effect is
no more present in the residuals, it is an indication
that the model is an adequate fit and can be used for
volatility spillover analysis. Bivariate GARCH model
makes use of information in the histories of two
different markets and can be used in testing volatility
spillover between two markets of the same under-
lying commodity.
The residuals from GARCH (1, 1) model of spot and
futures return series are then squared to ensure that
variance is positive. We now have two series:
1. Squared residuals of GARCH (1, 1) equation of spot
returns.
2. Squared residuals of GARCH (1, 1) equation of
futures returns.
The squared residuals of a market are used as a proxy
for shocks emanating in one market and are introduced
in the volatility equation of the other market to test the
volatility spillover from one market to the other. The
model framed for testing volatility spillover is:

Volatility of the current period is measured as a lag of
squared residuals of the previous period derived from
the mean equation, that is, e
t-1

variance from the model, that is, s

 , and the squared
residuals of the other market. If the coefficient of Y
fut
is statistically significant in the volatility equation of
spot returns, it is an indication of volatility spillover
from futures to spot market, and if Y
spot
 is statistically
significant in the volatility equation of futures returns,
it means that spot market is spilling some volatility to
the futures market. If both the coefficients are statis-
tically significant, there is a bidirectional spillover of
volatility and the magnitude of the spillover coefficient
determines which market is causing more impact of
volatility on the other market.
Relationship between SpotVolatility, Futures Trading
Volume, and Open Interest
The issue of stabilizing or de-stabilizing impact of
futures trading is generally investigated from two
perspectives: (a) examining the volatility of spot prices
before and after the introduction of futures trading and
(b) examining the relationship between futures trading
activity and spot price volatility. The second method-
ology has been followed in this study since it gives a
more interesting perspective to the study of the impact
of futures trading by incorporating other factors which
influence the market behaviour rather than just attrib-
uting the differences in market behaviour pre- and
post-futures to the presence of futures market. A few
studies, known for such kind of analysis, are Figlewski
(1981), Bessembinder and Seguin (1992), Adrangi and
Chatrath (1998), Gulen and Mayhew (2000), and Yang
et al. (2005) among others.
The spot price volatility is modelled as a GARCH
(1, 1) process as it captures the time varying nature
of volatility. GARCH variance series is generated
from E-Views and used as cash price volatility series.
Two variables, viz., futures trading volume and open
interest have been taken as the proxy for the level of
trading activity. As pointed by Leuthold (1983), daily
futures trading volume is largely indicative of specula-
tive activity since the transaction of hedgers constitute
only a small proportion of trading volume. However,
since open interest represents trading positions which
are longer than intraday positions, open interest data
on an average captures activity of hedgers. This inter-
pretation is also consistent with the studies of Working
(1962), Bessembinder and Seguin (1992), Kamara (1993),
and Yang et al. (2005).
Both series are first examined for stationarity with ADF
unit root test. If the trading volume and open interest
series are not stationary, then the first difference is
taken which eliminates unit root problem and the anal-
ysis is done on the series which is integrated of the first
order, that is, I(1).
Following the methodology of Adrangi and Chatrath
(1998), the expected and unexpected components of
tradingvolumeandopeninterestaredecomposedusing
Hodrick­Prescott (HP) filter (Hodrick & Prescott, 1997).
Partitioning the series into expected and unexpected
components helps in examining the heterogeneous
effects of anticipated versus surprise component of
trading activity (Bessembinder & Senguin, 1992).
Decomposition of the unexpected component with
HP filter produces results which are similar to those
obtained by taking the difference of actual series
and those fitted with ARIMA model. There is a high
140 VOLATILITY DYNAMICS IN OIL AND OILSEEDS SPOT AND FUTURES MARKET IN INDIA
correlation between the expected and permanent
components derived from HP-filter and those calcu-
lated with ARIMA model (Adrangi & Chatrath, 1998).
Series of expected futures trading volume and open
interest are then generated as the difference of actual
series and the unexpected component. ADF unit root
test is run again on the four series, viz., expected futures
trading volume (ETV), unexpected futures trading
volume (UTV), expected open interest (EOI), and unex-
pected open interest (UOI). The relationship between
spot returns volatility modelled as GARCH variance
series and trading activity variables is examined with
models discussed below:
1. Contemporaneous association between futures trading
activity (volume and open interest) and spot price vola-
tility (Bessembinder & Seguin, 1992; Chen, Cuny,
& Haugen, 1995; Figlewski, 1981). The contempo-
raneous relationship is examined by formulating
Augmented GARCH model developed by Duan
(1997) which allows the addition of explanatory
variables in the GARCH specification for condi-
tional variance. The expected and unexpected
components of futures trading activity are included
as the exogenous variables in GARCH (1, 1) model
of the spot returns (Lamoureux & Lastrapes, 1990).
The augmented GARCH model is represented as
follows:

is the expected open interest at time t,
and UOI
t
is the unexpected open interest at time t.
The significance and sign of futures trading
activity variables will determine if spot volatility
is influenced positively or negatively by trading
volume and open interest.
2. Dynamic relationship by temporal ordering of spot price
volatility and futures activity variables so that the lead
or the lag that is identified can ascertain whether
causality flows from futures trading activity to
spot volatility or in the reverse direction (Adrangi
& Chatrath, 1998; Chatrath, Ramchander, & Song,
1996; Darrat & Rahman, 1995).
According to the rational expectation theory, informa-
tion contained in the expected component of futures
trading is to a large extent already reflected in the cash
prices. Therefore, only the unexpected components of
futures trading activity are examined for determining
causality as they indicate unusual levels of trading
activity associated with speculative positions that
may be destabilizing. With the objective of studying
the dynamic relationship between unexpected open
interest and unexpected liquidity in the futures market
and underlying spot market volatility, Granger (1969)
causality test has been used. Granger causality ascer-
tains causal link in two variables and has been used in
the present study to determine whether the increase in
futures trading activity leads to increase in cash market
volatility or vice versa.
To test Granger causality between unexpected liquidity/
unexpected trading volume or unexpected open interest
and cash price volatility, the following specifications
are used:

Equations (4) and (5) ascertain the causality between
UTV and cash returns volatility (CV) while equations (6)
and (7) ascertain causality between UOI and CV, i, being
the number of lags chosen for each variable by framing
vector autoregressive model (VAR), and fixing the
number of lags on the basis of minimization of AIC or
Schwarz information criterion (SIC) criteria whichever
reports lesser lags for a more parsimonious analysis.
Inference about destabilizing impact of futures trading
can be drawn if the contemporaneous coefficient of
UTV or UOI in Augmented GARCH is significant and
positive and lagged coefficients of UTV or UOI are
significant in Granger causality test specification indi-
cating that causality is flowing from unexpected futures
volume/open interest to spot volatility. In this respect,
examining the signs of statistically significant param-
eters in the VAR will provide additional information
about their relationship.

EMPIRICAL RESULTS
Table 2 reports the unit root test results of spot and
futures series. The results indicate that spot and futures
prices at levels are non stationary as the ADF test statis-
tics is greater than the critical value at 5 per cent signif-
icance level. However, in the first difference of log
prices, that is, log returns, the null hypothesis of unit
root is rejected. Therefore, futures and spot log prices
of all commodities are integrated of the first order, that
is, I(1) and the returns being stationary are used for
further analysis.
RESULTS OF VOLATILITY SPILLOVER
The order of ARMA model, which minimizes the infor-
mationcriteria,isselectedfortheconditionalmeanequa-
tions of both spot and futures returns (results forARMA
and ARMA-GARCH models are explained earlier in
the article). After formulating autoregressive moving
averagemodel,volatilityismodelledwithGARCH(1,1).
The residuals from the GARCH model so formulated
for each market are squared and introduced as shocks
in the volatility equation of the other market to test the
volatility spillover effect from futures to spot market or
vice versa. Table 3 presents the results of the volatility
spillover. Volatility spillover coefficients are highly
significant in spot and futures equations of all four
commodities indicating that futures market volatility
spills over to the spot market and vice versa. Except
mustard seed, the volatility spillover coefficient from
futures to spot market is of relatively smaller magni-
tude than the spillover coefficient from spot to futures
market. In the case of mustard seed, the model reports
bi-directional volatility spillover with equal strength.
The magnitude of spillover coefficient from spot to
futures is greater in the case of soya oil, Mentha oil, and
crude palm oil (CPO). Therefore, spillover effect from
spot to futures is more than the spillover from futures
to spot. An increase in volatility of spot prices increases
the volatility of futures prices more as compared to the
other way round. Information in both markets can be
used to predict the volatility of other market but the
information transmission mechanism of spot market is
stronger. Therefore, futures market of oilseeds needs to
be developed further in order to be a leading source
of information transmission and provide efficient risk
transfer mechanism. Similar findings of stronger vola-
tility spillover from spot market to futures market have
been reported in Indian studies on agro commodi-
ties by Dey et al. (2011) in case of pepper, Mahalik et
al. (2009) for agricultural index at MCX, Srinivasan
and Ibrahim (2012) for gold, and Srinivasan (2012)
for MCXCOMDEX (composite index of metal, energy,
and agro-commodities). The model results are ratified
by the diagnostic test criteria wherein p-value of LM
test run with 2 lags is greater than 0.05. Therefore, the
null hypothesis of `no ARCH' effect is not rejected indi-
cating no serial dependencies in the residuals.

Relationship between Spot Volatility, Trading
Volume, and Open Interest
An old Wall Street adage says, `It takes trading
volume to make prices move.' The futures markets
furnish greater trading opportunities as they offer
traders market-wide risk exposure at lower transac-
tion cost. The impact of an increase in trading oppor-
tunities on the volatility of the market is unresolved
at empirical and theoretical levels. Several studies
have investigated the relation between return vola-
tility and trading volume and many have concluded
that price movements and transactions are bunched
in time (Admati & Pfleiderer, 1988). In order to test
whether there has been a significant relation between
futures trading activity and spot price volatility,
Augmented GARCH model and Granger causality
test are used. First, the difference of futures trading
volume and open interest series is taken to make them
stationary. In the case of mustard seed, both series are
stationary at levels and are, therefore, not subjected to
differencing. Table 4 reports the ADF test results. The
null hypothesis of the presence of unit root is rejected
indicating that the series are stationary and amenable
to meaningful statistical analysis.

Contemporaneous Relationship between Futures Trading
activity and Spot Price Volatility--Augmented GARCH
Model
As per the methodology of Bessembinder and Seguin
(1992), expected and unexpected components of futures
trading activity variables are introduced as exogenous
variables in the volatility equation of spot returns
modelled as a GARCH (1, 1) process. The GARCH (1, 1)
model augmented with additional explanatory vari-
ables enables the estimation of the contemporaneous
relationship between components of trading activity
and conditional spot volatility. Table 5 presents the
results of Augmented GARCH model.
ETV is positively related to cash price volatility in the
case of mentha oil and soya bean oil; however, it is
negatively related to CV in mustard seed. UTV is posi-
tive and significant in soya bean oil and CPO while it
is negative and significant in mentha oil. EOI is nega-
tive and significant in soya bean oil and mustard seed
implying that there is an inverse relation between the
two, that is, increase in anticipated open interest repre-
senting hedger's positions is associated with reduced
cash price volatility. UOI is positive and significant only
in mentha oil.
Inference about stabilizing or destabilizing impact
of futures trading can be made after combining the
results of augmented GARCH model with Granger
causality analysis.

Dynamic Relationship between Spot Price Volatility and
Unexpected Futures Trading Activity--Granger Causality
The contemporaneous relationship between spot price
volatility and unexpected futures trading volume
does not account for the possibility of reverse causa-
tion, that is, causality from spot volatility to futures
trading activity (Figlewski, 1981). Therefore, analysis of
the lead­lag relationship between trading activity and
volatility helps in ascertaining the causality and gives
a clear picture regarding the stabilizing or destabilizing
impact of futures trading.
VAR is formulated and number of lags is fixed on the
basis of minimization of SIC criteria. Joint significance
of the variables in all the four Granger Causality equa-
tions is tested with Chi-square statistics. Commodity-
wise analysis is presented in Table 6.

Chi-square test statistics for UTV and CV relationship
is significant indicating that current cash returns vola-
tility is influenced by the past level of unanticipated
futures trading volume. However, this is not destabi-
lizing as the lagged coefficients of UTV in VAR (not
reported here) are negative. Coefficient estimate of UTV
in GARCH model (Table 5) is also negative implying
that unexpected surge in trading volume reduces
the spot price volatility. According to the Mixture of
Distribution Hypothesis, there is a positive relation
between trading volume and variance of stock returns.
Empirical evidences of an inverse relationship between
the two are rare in the literature and are also in sharp
contrast to the widely held perception that volume and
volatility have positive correlation (Kawaller, Koch, &
Peterson, 2001). Daigler and Wiley (1999) found empir-
ical evidence of a positive relation between volume
and volatility when volume was driven by uninformed
general public. However, when the volumes were
driven by the activity of informed traders like floor
traders and clearing members, it was inversely related
to volatility. Damodaran and Subrahmanayan (1992)
concluded from a survey of a number of studies that
commodity futures helped in reducing the variance in
commodity markets. In relation to S&P index, Brown-
Hruska and Kuserk (1995) gave evidence of decline in
spot price volatility with an increase in futures volume.
The present analysis also provides evidence that unex-
pected futures trading volume is not destabilizing
for the underlying spot market. ETV is significant in
GARCH equation but its lagged terms in VAR (not
reported here) are not significant leading to rejection
of Granger causality from ETV to CV. Overall, UTV or
sudden increase in futures trading volume is not desta-
bilizing for mentha oil spot market volatility.
Chi-square test statistics is also significant for causality
running from UOI to spot price volatility. GARCH
model coefficient of UOI and lagged terms of UOI in
VAR are mostly positive indicating that unexpected
open interest has a destabilizing impact on spot
price volatility. Similar findings have been reported
in the study by Darrat and Rahman (1995), Yang et
al. (2005), and Kumar (2009) on selected commodity
futures traded in India. This aspect was discussed
with commodity research analyst at NCDEX. Mentha
oil futures market has a peculiar nature as it is highly
speculative with low trading volume and high open
interest. Participation of real hedgers is very low for this
commodity. The speculators try to corner the stocks by
buying futures contracts and rolling over the positions
on contract expiry. This gets reflected in an increase in
open interest, whereas the trading volume is low as
contracts do not change hands due to a limited number
of participants. The increase in levels of open interest in
mentha oil is associated with speculative positions and
leads to increased spot price volatility.
Causality is also observed in the direction from cash
returns volatility to futures trading volume with mixed
positive and negative signs in the VAR indicating that
erratic nature of cash price volatility also affects the
futures trading volume. The possible role of specula-
tive interest in the spot market cannot be ruled out,
wherein spot price volatility induces greater volumes
in futures market.

volatility. The increase in unexpected futures trading
volume may arise from uninformed speculators who
infuse noise in the market which is transmitted to spot
market through arbitrage and causes increased price
volatility.Futurestradingvolumerepresentstheactivity
of speculators and as they increase positions during the
day, volatility of underlying cash market, which takes
price signals from futures market, increases. Studies on
Indian commodity futures markets which have come
up with similar findings are Kumar (2009) and Sehgal
et al. (2012). Causality is not significant in other direc-
tions. Unexpected open interest has an insignificant
coefficient estimate in GARCH model and causality
from UOI to CV is also rejected; therefore hedging
activity does not influence cash price volatility.
Mustard Seed
The coefficients of expected trading volume and open
interest are significant and negative in augmented
GARCH (Table 5). It implies that the increase in the
level of trading volume and open interest is associated
with reduced spot volatility. This is consistent with the
views expressed in several studies that activities in
futures markets attract informed traders to the phys-
ical market imparting more liquidity and making it less
volatile (Pericli & Koutmos, 1997). On the other hand,
the model reports that sudden and unanticipated levels
of trading volume and open interest have no influence
on the volatility of spot market.
Unexpected trading volume or open interest is not
Granger causing the volatility in the cash market.
The result of Granger causality coincides with that of
GARCH model in which coefficients of UTV and UOI
are insignificant. Hence, there is no evidence of price
destabilization effect of futures trading which is a posi-
tive sign for the mustard seed futures market. Mustard
seed is the only commodity in which there is no
evidence of destabilizing impact. A possible explana-
tion for this may be that first, mustard seed commodity
price data is referred from NMCE exchange which is not
dominated by excessive speculation. Second, it is one
of the 25 commodities which are subject to minimum
support price fixed by the Government of India to
protect farmers against excessive fall in prices during
bumper production. Also, India is almost self-suffi-
cient in mustard seed and mustard oil and its domestic
market prices are not much influenced by prices in the
international markets. Since its prices are not purely
determined by market forces, the result of the impact of
futures trading differs from other commodities.
In three out of four oilseeds commodities analysed,
the study provides empirical evidence of the desta-
bilizing impact of futures trading activity either in
the form of trading volume or open interest on the
volatility of spot prices. Unexpected levels of futures
trading volume are responsible for driving up the
spot price volatility in the case of soya oil and CPO.
The daily trading volume reflects speculative posi-
tions and only a small portion of hedging transactions.
When volumes in futures market are predominantly
driven by uninformed speculators, underlying spot
price volatility will also increase as the two markets are
linked by arbitrage. On the other hand, open interest
comprises longer than intraday trading positions and
generally represents positions of hedgers or actively
informed traders who bring fundamental informa-
tion about the commodity to the futures market. The
increase in hedgers' position imparts depth to the
market. They are traders who have relatively homoge-
nous beliefs and agree on prices which are close to the
intrinsic value of an asset. Therefore, higher liquidity
from the participation of informed traders in the form
of expected and unexpected open interest is not having
a destabilizing impact on the spot price volatility.
CONCLUDING REMARKS AND POLICY
SUGGESTIONS
Oil and oilseeds commodities are hot counters on com-
modity futures exchanges. They are heavily demanded
for domestic consumption and industrial use by
biodiesel industry. Futures trading is expected to bring
price stability for the development of its physical
market. However, the potential of futures contracts for
price discovery and price risk management is untapped.
The present study investigates the volatility dynamics
in spot and futures markets of select commodities from
the sector. The econometric analysis is undertaken to test
the volatility spillover between spot and futures market,
and to ascertain whether an unexpected increase in
futures trading volume or open interest is destabi-
lizing for the underlying spot market. It is observed
that though there is bidirectional volatility spillover,
the volatility of spot market has a greater impact on the
volatility of futures market, indicating that informa-
tional efficiency of oilseeds spot market is stronger than
that of futures market. The analysis provides evidence
of destabilizing impact of futures trading on the vola-
tility of physical market prices in three out of four
commodities analysed. It indicates that badly informed
traders present in futures market are destabilizing the
146 VOLATILITY DYNAMICS IN OIL AND OILSEEDS SPOT AND FUTURES MARKET IN INDIA
underlying spot market by inducing noise and lowering
the information content of prices.
The results are important for hedgers in commodity
markets who expect welfare gains from futures trading,
which is possible only if the latter does not increase
the spot price volatility. However, if the speculative
activity in futures market does not lower the volatility,
the overall risk of a hedged portfolio is not reduced
resulting in welfare reduction. Spot markets in India for
agricultural commodities are fragmented, unorganized,
and are not electrically traded. Due to the lack of trans-
parency, it becomes an easy victim of instability perpe-
trated by noisy speculative activity in futures markets.
Therefore, it is important to encourage participa-
tion of farmers, traders, processors and other stake-
holders who will bring fundamental information
about the underlying commodity into the futures
market. Educating and training farmers and traders
will enhance their confidence in the use of derivative
contracts. Spot markets can be strengthened by equip-
ping them with information-technology based price
dissemination terminals like electronic price ticker
boards. Such measures will bring speed and transpar-
ency in the spot trading mechanism which can coexist
with the state-of-the-art commodity futures exchanges.
Greater financial and administrative autonomy to
the Forward Market Commission (FMC) which is till
now operating under the Department of Consumer
Affairs (Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public
Distribution), will enable it to handle incidents of
price rigging and abusive practices like hoarding and
cartelization. The punitive powers of FMC need to be
increased so that it can take stringent action against
traders engaging in fraudulent activities. Whenever
such instability is witnessed, the regulator can control
the impact of excessive speculation by adopting meas-
ures, such as close monitoring of members' positions,
imposing additional margins, declaration of stocks
in warehouses, and staggered delivery systems, and
so on. It is also proposed that futures trading should
not be allowed in narrow commodities. These are the
commodities which do not meet the suitability require-
ment for futures trading. They face constraints like
limited domestic production due to which reliable
and timely demand and supply forecasts are not avail-
able. Narrow agricultural commodities like mentha oil
and cardamom become potential candidates for price
manipulation in the absence of any precise data.
