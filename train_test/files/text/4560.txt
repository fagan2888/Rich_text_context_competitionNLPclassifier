The affordability of wearable psychophysiological
sensors has led to opportunities to measure the men-
tal workload of operators in complex sociotechnical
systems in ways that are more objective and less obtru-
sive.This study primarily focuses on the sensors them-
selves by investigating low-cost and wearable sensors
in terms of their accuracy, obtrusiveness, and usabil-
ity for research purposes.Two sensors were assessed
on their accuracy as tools to measure mental work-
load through heart rate variability (HRV): the E3 from
Empatica and the emWave Pro from HeartMath. The
BioPatch from ZephyrTechnology,which is an U.S.Food
and Drug Administration­approved device, was used as
a gold standard to compare the data obtained from the
other 2 devices regarding their accuracy on HRV.Linear
dependencies for 6 of 10 HRV parameters were found
between the emWave and BioPatch data and for 1 of 10
for the E3 sensor.In terms of research usability,both the
E3 and the BioPatch had difficulty acquiring either suffi-
ciently high data recording confidence values or normal
distributions.However,the BioPatch output files do not
require postprocessing, which reduces costs and effort
in the analysis stage.None of the sensors was perceived
as obtrusive by the participants.

Introduction
Over the last few decades, there has been
a significant shift of focus from operators'
physical demands to their cognitive demands:
a shift that is especially pertinent in complex
and safety-critical systems, such as aviation,
driving, and rail (Young, Brookhuis, Wickens,
& Hancock, 2014). These cognitive demands
are reflected in an operator's mental workload
(MWL), or the proportion of mental capacity on
a task (Brookhuis & de Waard, 2010; Kahne-
man, 1973).
A variety of MWL measurement techniques
can be divided into three general categories:
performance, subjective, and physiological
measurement techniques (Brookhuis, 2004;
Cain, 2007; Wierwille & Eggemeier, 1993).
Performance-based techniques are assessed
through the capability in which an operator is
able to perform system or task functions, such as
speed and accuracy on primary and secondary
tasks (Wierwille & Eggemeier, 1993). Second,
subjective measurement techniques rely on opera-
tor judgements. Self-rating scales of MWL--such
as the NASA Task Load Index by Hart and
Staveland (1988), the Subjective Workload
Assessment Technique by Reid and Nygren
(1988), the Overall Workload Scale by Vidulich
and Tsang (1987), the Modified Cooper-Harper
Scale by Wierwille and Casali (1983), and the
Rating Scale Mental Effort by Zijlstra (1985)--
are a few of well-known examples that are used
in multiple domains (Young, Brookhuis, Wick-
ens, & Hancock, 2014). From a neuroergonomic
approach, psychophysiological measurements

324 December 2017 - Journal of Cognitive Engineering and Decision Making
(EDA) based on sweat glands are a few exam-
ples of measurement techniques to gain insights
into the MWL of operators (Brookhuis & de
Waard, 2010; G. F. Wilson, 2002). Another
assessment technique is that of heart rate vari-
ability (HRV; Mulder, De Waard, & Brookhuis,
2004; Parasuraman, 2011). Here the variable
durations between heartbeats can have different
oscillations patterns (Brookhuis, 2004).
So far, the results from multiple studies that
compare measurement techniques are scattered;
there is no measurement technique that has been
unanimously acknowledged to be valid and reli-
able for MWL (Cain, 2007). In a recent study,
multiple psychophysiological measurement
techniques have been used to compare MWL,
such as EEG, electrocardiogram (ECG), transcra-
nial Doppler sonography, functional near infrared,
and eye tracking (Matthews, Reinerman-Jones,
Barber, & Julian Abich, 2015). The findings
from this study indicate that certain metrics are
more sensitive to dual tasking--namely, short
fixation duration and a high task load index
(derived from EEG). Metrics more sensitive to
workload-associated change detection included,
for example, a low HRV (derived from ECG)
and a high theta (derived from EEG).
In the current study, MWL measurement
through HRV is further explored due to the
increasing availability of wearable and con-
sumer devices and the potential advantages of
these low-cost and/or less intrusive devices for
human factors research.
Psychophysiological tools focusing on HRV
measurements have traditionally been conducted
with three-lead ECG sensors attached to the
chest. The removal of bodily hair is a basic pro-
cedure to conduct the measurements, often fol-
lowed by a laboratory or simulator setting in
which participants are restricted in their move-
ments by a wired connection to the recording
system. Over the past few years, "wearable"
sensors have become more widely available.
These sensors are unobtrusive in the sense that
they can be worn as an ambulatory system in
which the individual is able to move around
freely during his or her measurement. The emer-
gence of wearable sensors can be explained by
recent advances in microelectronics that have
overcome the limitations resulting from the size
of front-end electronics and the sensor itself
(Patel, Park, Bonato, Chan, & Rodgers, 2012).
Wearable sensors in the form of rings, wrist-
bands, earplugs, and so on, are increasingly
used by individuals to monitor their health
(e.g., during workouts), whereas sensors in the
form of patches are more commonly used by
medical practitioners for the remote monitor-
ing of their patients. With consumers and med-
ical practitioners as potential clients in the
heart rate­monitoring market, these devices
became more affordable than ECG sensors
used for research.
These innovative measurement devices have
great potential for research in the railway
domain, where human factors research has been
steadily increasing since the railway sector, in
many countries worldwide, was broken up into
commercial and governmental organizations in
the 1990s (J. R. Wilson & Norris, 2005). In the
Netherlands, radical changes in the railways are
being implemented, as long-term targets have
been set to increase the infrastructural capacity
(Meijer, 2012). In 2014, financial investments
made by the government for capacity expansion
projects amounted to only 600 million euros,
which is 53% of the total funding (ProRail,
2015). Projects focusing on meeting a higher-
capacity demand vary from optimizations of
physical infrastructural configurations, such as
creating more buffers in bottleneck areas to pro-
cess optimizations. These changes also affect
railway traffic operations, for which it is there-
fore essential to investigate the impact on the
cognitive demands imposed on railway traffic
operators.
A series of railway gaming simulation ses-
sions have been conducted to test future modes
of the railway system, which is expected to carry
increasing amounts of freight and numbers of
passengers each year (Lo, Van den Hoogen, &
Meijer, 2013). Insights into the MWL of railway
traffic operators are considered valuable in these
sessions, with a finite pool of operators, who
often return as participants. Less obtrusive
instruments, such as wearable sensors, could
facilitate data collection without requiring too
much effort on the part of the participating oper-
ators such that they may not need be interrupted
during their tasks. Also, the use of instruments
Measuring Mental Workload With Low-Cost and Wearable Sensors 325
that are less obtrusive can support conditions
where participants are more aware of being in a
simulated environment or an investigation. Fur-
thermore, less invasive instruments can be help-
ful when investigations on operators are not an
established routine, as in the railway sector, in
which case individuals might be more prone to
feelings of hesitance and reluctance to partici-
pate. Additionally, longer MWL measurement
periods during operators'shifts in real-world set-
tings can be obtained. Current measurement tech-
niques in the railway domain obtain estimates of
MWL through self-rating or observation-based
rating tools (e.g., Pickup et al., 2005). As such,
the use of objective methods, such as psycho-
physiological measurement techniques, can pro-
vide insights into MWL development next to the
existing tools.
In addition, due to their easy application and
user-friendly interfaces for data extraction and
visualizations, low-cost and wearable psycho-
physiological sensors can reduce the need for
assistance from expert researchers (who are usu-
ally required when traditional heart rate mea-
surement instruments are used) and thus make
data processing in large-scale research efforts
much easier.
The present study focused on establishing
which low-cost and/or wearable sensors are suit-
able for accurate MWL measurements and,
therefore, future deployment. Three psycho-
physiological sensors that had not yet been
researched were selected from a broad range of
low-cost and wearable sensors: the E3 from
Empatica (Milan, Italy), the emWave Pro from
HeartMath (Boulder Creek, CA), and the Bio
Patch from Zephyr (Annapolis, MD). They were
used to measure the MWL of train traffic con-
trollers in a simulator through the analysis of
HRV. To identify the suitability of sensors for
analysis and future deployment, the focus was
on identifying (1) the extent to which partici-
pants perceived the sensors as being obtrusive;
(2) the sensors' usability for research purposes,
in terms of usable data points and ease of post-
processing data for the analysis; and (3) the
accuracy of the E3 and emWave sensors versus
the BioPatch ECG sensor as a U.S. Food and
Drug Administration (FDA)­approved gold
standard reference device.
The following section presents a description
of the three psychophysiological instruments
and their specifications, followed by the method,
results, and discussion and conclusion.
Psychophysiological
Instruments
The possibility of applying low-cost wearable
sensors (e.g., Garmin Edge 800, Polar S810, and
Suunto t6) to measure HRV has been explored
in a number of studies, mostly by comparing the
sensor to a gold standard (typically an ECG; Ess-
ner, Sjöström, Ahlgren, & Lindmark, 2013; Hlo-
tova, Cats, & Meijer, 2014; Porto & Junqueira,
2009; Schäfer & Vagedes, 2013; Wallén, Has-
son, Theorell, Canlon, & Osika, 2012; Weippert
et al., 2010). Although their findings are incon-
clusive, these studies indicate that the results from
wearable sensors are significant when physical
activity, gender, and age are taken into account
and care is taken in the use of absolute values.
This section provides a description of the func-
tionalities and specifications of the E3, emWave,
and BioPatch devices, which were selected on the
basis of placement at different locations on the
body--respectively, at the wrist, ear, and chest--
their low-cost availability (EmWave), their rec-
ommended application for research purposes (E3
and BioPatch), and the possibility to extract data
sets from the devices. Table 1 shows the simi-
larities and differences among the three sensors
(Empatica, 2013; Zephyr, 2013).
E3
Empatica's E3 device (see Figure 1) is a
wristband that has a photoplethysmograph sen-
sor, an EDA sensor, a three-axis accelerom-
eter, and a temperature sensor (Garbarino, Lai,
Bender, Picard, & Tognetti, 2014). Photople-
thysmograph is often used in wrist sensors to
assess variations in the reflected or transmitted
light to measure blood volume pulse, which in
turn can be used to derive heart rate and HRV.
The measurements are started by pressing a
button on the sensor. To access the raw data, it
first has to be uploaded from the device to the
Empatica website.
A unique feature of Empatica sensors is that
they include an EDAsensor for skin conductance.
326 December 2017 - Journal of Cognitive Engineering and Decision Making
EDA is known to be correlated with an individ-
ual's emotional state (e.g., stress) and workload,
as perspiration increases skin conductance (Pina,
Donmez, & Cummings, 2008). The sensor,
which is available in various sizes, is fixed to the
wristband.
For the current study, only HRV analyses
were conducted. To obtain the HRV data set
from the E3, the data from the device need to be
uploaded to the Empatica website. Empatica
uses algorithms to provide online visualizations
of the data and the option to download data sets
with the interbeat intervals (IBIs)--that is, the
time intervals between heartbeats. In the data
set, a time stamp for the first recorded data point
is provided with, subsequently, the number of
seconds after the start of the recording and its
respective IBIs. Note that the raw data are not
accessible nor downloadable.
emWave Pro
The emWave Pro is offered as a training sys-
tem for individuals to achieve better emotional
balance. The sensor is attached to the earlobe
and features only a photoplethysmograph sen-
sor to measure heart rate (see Figure 2). As the
sensor is wired to the measurement computer
via a USB connector, it is not considered a wear-
able device.
The emWave Pro product version is required
to access the raw data from the recorded ses-
sions. Measurements and raw file extractions are
accessible with the emWave software. The data
set is obtained through the software program and
provides the initial time stamp with the start of
the recording time of the data. The data set con-
sists of IBI data per second.
BioPatch
The BioPatch by Zephyr Technology is an
FDA-approved ECG sensor that can be placed
on the chest with two replaceable electrodes
(see Figure 3). FDA approval indicates that
the sensor complies with regulations on users'
safety and is therefore permitted for use in a
clinical setting. The BioPatch is rather unob-
trusive in comparison with the standard three-
lead ECG sensor, as no chest hairs need to be
removed (depending on its placement).
The BioPatch is capable of measuring heart
rate, interbeat (difference between R-wave occur-
rence times [RR]) interval, respiration rate, ECG,

activity level, and posture (Zephyr, 2013). The
measurement is triggered by pressing a button on
the sensor. To obtain the raw data from the
recorded sessions, the BioPatch needs to be con-
nected to a computer and accessed through a log
downloader. HRV data can be analyzed through
the ECG data set file or the IBI data set file. In the
present study, the sampling rate of the BioPatch
was set to the default 250 Hz, and the ECG data
set file was used to conduct the analyses.
Method
Experimental Setting
A human-in-the-loop simulator that is used to
train traffic controllers and test infrastructural,
timetable, and process changes was deployed to
conduct the experiments. This simulator, called
the PRL game (version 3.5.7), incorporates a
subset of the traffic management system's fea-
tures. PRL is an acronym for "Proces Leiding"
in Dutch, which translates to the name of the
traffic management system. For this experi-
ment, its features were extended and matched
to the level of validity of the simulator for the
current task at hand, in which operators had an
interface design highly similar to their regular
workstation. Table 2 shows the simulator design
characteristics based on a gaming simulation
design format (Lo & Meijer, 2013).
Scenarios
Each 20-min scenario comprised 4 phases,
in which the start of a phase was triggered by
an event (e.g., a call from a train driver). Each
phase approximately took 5 min. These sce-
narios and phases were developed and selected
by a subject matter expert. Scenario 1 focused
on an overloaded freight train that needs to
drive with a lower speed, therefore delaying
subsequent trains. In Scenario 2, a malfunction-
ing freight train blocks multiple tracks near a
railroad crossing, triggering a railroad crossing
malfunction in time. In Table 3, the four phases
of this scenario are summarized.
Participants
Twelve male train traffic controllers took part
in the simulator session. Their average work
experience was 14 years (SD = 8.5).
Materials
Perceived obtrusiveness.
The degree of
obtrusiveness of the sensors was qualitatively
measured through questions during the debrief-
ing. Two questions were asked to measure the
degree of perceived obtrusiveness: "Did you
experience the sensors as obtrusive?" "Which
sensor did you find the least obtrusive?" The
data were processed by checking how many
participants answered the first question with yes
or no and which sensor was indicated as being
least obtrusive.
Usability of the sensors for research.The
usability of the sensors was assessed by the
extent to which they were suitable for research
purposes in terms of usable data points and the
ease of postprocessing data for the analysis. The
postprocessing of data was necessary to identify
the start and end of a selected period or phase.
Reducing postprocessing saves time and
reduces the costs involved in the analysis stage
of a study. In terms of usable data points, the
collected data were evaluated on their heart rate
confidence values and normal distribution,

data.
Sensor accuracy. In line with the notion of
conducting analyses without the assistance of
expert researchers who use specific program-
ming tools, HRV was analyzed in each phase
with a freeware software packages called
Kubios HRV 2.2. Kubios has been applied in
numerous clinical studies (Fagundes et al.,
2011). Based on a visual inspection of the out-
liers, medium artifact corrections were applied
for the emWave and E3, and a very low arti-
fact correction was applied to the BioPatch
data. HRV parameters were similarly calcu-
lated for all three sensors by the time-domain
method (mean difference between R-wave
occurrence times; also known as mean RR) or
IBI in milliseconds, standard deviation of
normal-to-normal RR intervals, root mean
square of successive differences in millisec-
onds, relative amount of successive intervals
differing >50 ms in percentages (pNN50), tri-
angular interpolation in milliseconds, and
frequency-domain method (lower frequency
[LF] band: 0.04­0.15 Hz and higher frequency
[HF] band: 0.15­0.4 Hz, as calculated by
Kubios in terms of power, normalized values,
and ratio). For an elaborate description see,
for example, Schäfer and Vagedes (2013) and
Tarvainen, Niskanen, Lipponen, Ranta-aho,
and Karjalainen (2014).
Procedure.In this within-subjects design,
the participants were briefed on the purpose of
the simulator study at the start of each session,
and their permission was obtained to use the
data from the session anonymously. All partici-
pants gave their consent and were then equipped
with all three sensors. The E3 was worn on the
wrist that was not used for writing or handling
the computer mouse. The BioPatch was placed
on the sternum on the first day. During the
study, it was decided to change the location of
the BioPatch for the second measurement day,
to the rib left of the sternum (as seen from the
rear of the participant), to increase the data-
recording quality. The emWave sensor was
applied to the left earlobe, due to the location of
the computer. As the train traffic controllers'
tasks did not require physical activities, move-
ment activities were limited to seating positions
and arm movements.
After the final scenario, the participants were
debriefed about their experience with the sen-
sors, their MWL, and their usage of the simula-
tor. Questionnaires were handed out prior to and
after the session and after each scenario.

Results
Perceived Obtrusiveness
The qualitative findings from the debriefing
session showed that none of the participants
perceived any of the sensors as being obtrusive.
However, operators noted that the emWave was
occasionally noticeable due to its wired con-
nection with the computer. Most participants
indicated that they forgot they were wearing
the E3 wristband, as they were used to wearing
watches. Few participants who were not used
to wearing watches stated that they had some-
times found the E3 device noticeable. Overall,
the BioPatch sensor was perceived as the least
obtrusive device.
Usability of the Sensors for Research
The BioPatch sensor is provided with a heart
rate confidence value as a quality indicator.
Values >20% are indicated as a threshold for
a reliable heart rate (Zephyr, 2014). For this
study, this margin has been adopted based on
the assumption that a FDA-approved sensor
can validly serve as a gold standard device. A
raw data file from the E3 can be extracted only
from the website, which omits values when the

High
330 December 2017 - Journal of Cognitive Engineering and Decision Making
confidence rate of the measurement is not high
enough. The emWave sensor always provides a
value at each constant measurement point. Due
to the unavailability of data points caused by
a low measurement confidence, especially in
the case of the E3, a normal distribution of RR
intervals in each phase was not always obtain-
able. In the evaluation of usable data points,
four data sets of the BioPatch showed a low
heart rate confidence value, whereas seven data
sets of the E3 partially showed too few data
points to obtain a normal distribution. Also one
data set from the E3 was lost during an attempt
to upload the data from the device. No issues
were encountered regarding the emWave.
The E3 and emWave data first needed to be
processed manually by converting the time
stamps and identifying the start of the recording.
Time indications of the ECG file are directly dis-
played in Kubios. Some data files had to be
manually split, since Kubios is not able to open
very large files.
A precondition for the comparison among the
three sensors is that the data in each phase have
normal distributions and sufficiently high data
confidence rates. Failure to meet this precondi-
tion led to omission from the analysis. Due to
the omission or unavailability of data, only HRV
data from three to six participants could be
included in the analysis per phase.
Accuracy of the Sensors
Since the BioPatch is an FDA-approved
ECG sensor, it was used as a reference for the
accuracy of the E3 and emWave devices. For
each participant, only full data sets from all
three sensors were used in the analysis. Tables
4 and 5 present 10 HRV parameters and their
means and standard deviations for each sen-
sor and per phase, respectively for Scenario
1 (Phases 1­4) and Scenario 2 (Phases 6­8).
One phase in Scenario 2 was removed, as the
scenario was too short to provide sufficient data
points for the E3 sensor.
To identify to what extent the E3 and emWave
followed a similar trend in their data points in
comparison to the BioPatch, which indicates the
accuracy in relative terms, a linear regression
was computed based on the data from the seven
phases in Tables 4 and 5. The linear regression
analysis was conducted between the BioPatch
and each of the two other sensors; the significant
relationships are given in Tables 4 and 5. In total,
6 of 10 HRV parameters showed a linear rela-
tionship between the emWave and the BioPatch
data: mean RR, adjusted R2 = .99, F = 833.1, p <
.001; pNN50, adjusted R2 = .35, F = 4.3, p = .09;
LF power, adjusted R2 = .82, F = 27.5, p = .003;
normalized LF, adjusted R2 = .49, F = 6.8, p =
.04; normalized HF, adjusted R2 = .50, F = 6.9,
p = .05; and LF/HF ratio, adjusted R2 = .50, F =
7.1, p = .04. A significant linear regression was
found for 1 of 10 HRV parameters for the E3
sensor (i.e., mean RR, adjusted R2 = .98, F =
307.1, p < .001).
The results from two commonly used HRV
parameters derived from the time- and
frequency-domain analysis (mean RR and nor-
malized LF, respectively) are given in Tables 4
and 5.
Time-domain analysis.For the mean RR
values (see Figure 4), a linear regression analy-
sis was conducted over all phases. The findings
show that the data from the BioPatch can be
very well represented by a linear function in the
emWave data (adjusted R2 = .99, F = 833.1, p <
.001, as listed earlier). The absolute values of
the BioPatch and emWave can even be consid-
ered equal within the current measurement
range, with an error of approximately 8%. For
the E3, a similar result is observed (adjusted
R2 = .98, F = 307.1, p < .001, as also previously
mentioned). Thus, the data values recorded by
the emWave, E3, and BioPatch are linearly
dependent and can easily be converted for the
mean RR values as an HRV parameter.
Frequency-domain analysis. The regression
analysis shows a poor correspondence for the
normalized LF values between the emWave and
the BioPatch (adjusted R2 = .49, F = 6.8, p =
.04) but a very good one when the outlier P7 is
removed (adjusted R2 = .95, F = 99.1, p < .001;
see mean normalized LF values in Figure 5).
For the E3 sensor, no such linear dependency is
found. This implies that the findings from the
E3 sensor do not provide accurate indications
for the measurement of HRV for this parameter
and should therefore not be used to derive
conclusions.

Measuring Mental Workload With Low-Cost and Wearable Sensors 333
Discussion and Conclusion
In the present study, three psychophysi-
ological sensors were investigated on their per-
ceived obtrusiveness, their usability for research
purposes in terms of usable data points, and
the ease of postprocessing data and accuracy
on HRV (the E3 and emWave vs. the FDA-
approved BioPatch as a gold standard reference
device).
The data points of the E3, the emWave, and
the BioPatch are linearly dependent when the
analysis of HRV is limited to the mean RR
parameter. For this HRV parameter, the absolute
values of the emWave could be used inter-
changeably with those of the BioPatch. How-
ever, when the results from all 10 HRV parame-
ters were taken into account, a correspondence
was found for 6 of 10 parameters between the
emWave and the BioPatch. For the E3 sensor,
this applies to only one HRV parameter. Thus,
great care should be taken when selecting HRV
parameters derived from the E3 wristband data.
These findings are surprising in that, overall,
the emWave is more accurate than the E3, given
the lower sampling rate of the EmWave. A rea-
son for the difference in significant findings
between the E3 and the emWave with regard to
the 10 HRV parameters might be the location of
the sensors: A wristband sensor might incur
more noise during data acquisition. The impact
of the E3 as being less accurate given its signifi-
cant relationship with 1 of 10 HRV parameters
may contribute to the discussion about the extent
to which commercially available wearable sen-
sors, often wristbands, are accurate. However,
although the FDA does not actively enforce reg-
ulations on commercially available wearable
sensors, it has developed a draft set of guidelines
for products that are used only for wellness pur-
poses, that present a very low risk to users'

safety, and for which the data are not interpreted
to diagnose diseases or conditions (U.S. Depart-
ment of Health and Human Services, 2015).
The participants did not perceive any of the
three sensors as obtrusive, although a few found
the emWave and the E3 noticeable at times. In
terms of usable data points, both the E3 and the
BioPatch had difficulty acquiring either suffi-
ciently high data-recording confidence values
(especially the BioPatch) or normal distributions
(especially the E3, due to missing data points in
the output file).As for the ease of postprocessing
data, the BioPatch output files required no man-
ual postprocessing, which reduced costs and
efforts in the analysis stage. In this case, 12 par-
ticipants were analyzed, and in the case of both
the emWave and the E3, data had to be prepared
for the actual analysis in terms of manually iden-
tifying the start and end phases within the output
files (e.g., through time stamp conversions, the
synchronization of sampling rate with times, and
adaption of the output file). The postprocessing
of data took a considerable effort over a period
of a few days for both files. An output file that
needs very few or no manual adaptations can be
highly recommended when dealing with a larger
sample. However, greater compatibility between
the output file and the software program can also
support the postprocessing work.
Each of the three devices has its own pros and
cons regarding deployment in a research setting.
The BioPatch would be the overall preferred
sensor, due to its assumed accuracy and usability
for research purposes. However, a strong empha-
sis lies on exploring how to increase the data-
recording confidence rate. As an alternative sen-
sor, the emWave could be acceptable for mea-
suring HRV, as it had a sufficiently high accuracy
on 6 of 10 parameters to measure HRV, in which
1 parameter (mean RR) was significant in terms
of absolute values. It is not, however, a wearable
sensor, which limits the measurements to a static
setting. Note that sensors can be more preferred
or recommended given the priorities of a partic-
ular study. For instance, if the number of data
points is prioritized, if no time constraints are set
on postprocessing data, and if no ambulatory
movements are expected during the study, the
emWave would be recommended over the Bio-
Patch, as the latter's data-recording confidence
rate is unstable. The E3 could also be used in
control room studies when researchers want to
use a wristband sensor and are supportive of
using only the mean RR as an HRV parameter to
calculate MWL.
This study shows that the wearable BioPatch
sensor and the low-cost emWave sensor can
both be used to analyze the MWL development
of train traffic controllers. The positive advan-
tages of the sensors, especially with regard to the
ease of use in recording and postprocessing data
for analysis, could provide opportunities for cost
reductions in terms of expertise in traditional
ECG measurements as well as in equipment
costs. With proper but limited training, it is pos-
sible to apply the devices and prepare the data
set without much prior experience. Moreover,
with the increasing popularity of wearable sen-
sors, the chance increases that researchers and
participants are acquainted with the use of these
sensors. Additionally, in the light of so-called
regret costs, measuring the objective MWL of
operators through low-cost heart rate sensors
(<$450 for the BioPatch sensor [in U.S. dollars])
costs a fraction of the amount spent on imple-
menting a traffic management system--for
example, approximately $43 million (originally
stated as 28 million pounds) in the United King-
dom (Railway Gazette, 2014).
However, limitations in this study should be
noted, as the BioPatch had a different sensor
placement on the chest on the second measure-
ment day. As the sample size was too small to
investigate possible differences between the two
groups, future research should investigate pos-
sible effects. In general, future research is
needed to confirm these findings, given the lim-
ited number of samples in this study. Also the
presented conclusions are valid only for HRV
measurements in nonphysically demanding
tasks, such as supervisory control tasks. More
research is needed to explore the other wearable
sensors on the market, to investigate the effects
of individual differences, such as gender and
age, on the level of accuracy of the sensors and
to confirm the use of the BioPatch as a valid and
accurate reference device.
All in all, the accessibility and affordability
of wearable sensors show great potential to
obtain insights in the MWL development of
Measuring Mental Workload With Low-Cost and Wearable Sensors 335
operators next to the use of observational and/or
self-rating data. The advantages of long-term
measurements throughout operators' shifts can
especially provide new insights into the cogni-
tive demands of certain tasks at hand. Future
work could also examine the MWL through
HRV and stress through EDA relation, which
can be retrieved from the Empatica device.
