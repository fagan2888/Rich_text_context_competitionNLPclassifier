Abstract:
We analyse the implications of intra-firm bargaining for business cycle dynamics in
models with large firms and search frictions. Intra-firm bargaining implies a feedback
eect from the marginal revenue product to wage setting which leads firms to over-hire
in order to reduce workers' bargaining position within the firm. The key to this eect
are decreasing returns and/or downward-sloping demand. We show that equilibrium
wages and employment are higher in steady state compared to a bargaining framework
in which firms neglect this feedback. However, the eects of intra-firm bargaining on
adjustment dynamics, volatility and comovement are negligible.

Non-technical summary
In models that analyse the role of the labor market for business cycle dynamics it
is typically assumed that the marginal (revenue) product of labor is independent of
employment. In many cases, this is not very plausible, which has been noted in
the literature. The marginal product of a firm falls with its production for example
because of a downward-sloping demand curve or a concave production function. In
that case, there are two consequences for wage setting: on the one hand, a firm
has the incentive to expand production so as to reduce the wage per worker, which
depends on the marginal product. This is a partial equilibrium eect. However, in
general equilibrium, the higher demand for labor will improve the bargaining position
of worker and thus lead to higher wages. This suggest that a theoretical bargaining
solution should take account of employers' strategic considerations.
We analyse the issue of intra-firm bargaining in a calibrated general equilibrium
business cycle model. Indeed we find that there are strong eects on the steady state
of the model, with lower unemployment and higher wages than in the model with-
out strategic wage setting. However, it turns out that the dynamic, business cycle,
eects are qualitatively and quantitatively weak. In response to a positive aggregate
shock, unemployment falls slightly more, employment and vacancies increase some-
what more, and wages fall a little less. In this respect, intra-firm bargaining matters,
as the bargaining position of workers improves by less than is mandated by the rise in
labor market tightness. But overall, the transmission of aggregate shocks on output
is virtually unaected.
The findings can be interpreted as implying that, in many circumstances, re-
searchers may safely ignore intra-firm bargaining even when analyzing business cycle
models with large firms that face decreasing marginal product. If we - falsely - cal-
ibrate a model without this strategic feedback on wages to actual data where it is
present, the mistake we make is likely to be small. This is not meant to imply that
there may not be important and interesting eects on the steady state of a model,
which indeed have been analysed in the literature.
Nicht-technische Zusammenfassung
In Modellen, in denen die Rolle des Arbeitsmarktes für die konjunkturelle Entwick-
lung einer Volkswirtschaft untersucht wird, wird in der Regel unterstellt, dass der
Grenzertrag der Arbeit unabhängig von der Firmengröße ist. In vielen Fällen ist dies
aber wenig plausibel. Wenn der Grenzertrag eines Unternehmens mit seiner Pro-
duktion abnimmt - etwa als Resultat einer konkaven Produktionsfunktion oder einer
fallenden Nachfrage nach dem Output des Unternehmens - hat das zweierlei Konse-
quenzen für den Lohnbildungsprozess: Zum einen hat das Unternehmen im Partial-
gleichgewicht einen Anreiz, seine Produktion auszudehnen und so den Lohn seiner
Arbeitnehmer (der dem Grenzprodukt entspricht ) zu senken und damit den eigenen
Gewinn zu erhöhen. Auf der anderen Seite führt - im allgemeinen Gleichgewicht - die
stärkere gesamtwirtschaftliche Arbeitsnachfrage zu besseren Verhandlungspositionen
der Arbeitnehmer und höheren Löhnen. Beide Argumente legen für die theoretische
Lohnfindung eine Verhandlungslösung nahe, die die strategischen Überlegungen der
Arbeitgeber berücksichtigt.
Wir analysieren diese Zusammenhänge in einem kalibrierten allgemeinen Gleich-
gewichtsmodell. Tatsächliche zeigen sich starke Eekte im steady state des Modells,
indem Arbeitslosigkeit niedriger und Löhne höher sind, als in dem Modell ohne strate-
gische Lohnsetzung auf Unternehmensseite. Allerdings zeigt sich auch, dass die kon-
junkturellen Unterschiede qualitativ und quantitativ gering sind: die Arbeitslosigkeit
sinkt etwas stärker, die Beschäftigung und die oenen Stellen nehmen etwas mehr zu,
und die Löhne steigen etwas schwächer als Folge eines positiven Schocks. Insgesamt
ist die Transmission von konjunkturellen Schocks unverändert.
Die Ergebnisse lassen sich dahingehend interpretieren, dass Ökonomen in vielen
Fällen die strategische Rolle von fallendem Grenzprodukt oder -ertrag vernachlässigen
können, wenn sie die konjunkturelle Entwicklung der Wirtschaft untersuchen. Dies ist
insofern von Bedeutung, da zum einen viele Forschungsarbeiten diese Eekte ignori-
eren, und zum anderen Modelle ohne strategische Lohnsetzung wesentlich einfacher
zu lösen sind. Dies soll jedoch nicht suggerieren, dass sich daraus nicht interessante
Implikationen für den steady state ergeben können. In der Tat gibt es in der Literatur
Hinweise auf solche Eekte.

Does Intra-firm Bargaining Matter for Business Cycle
Dynamics?1
1 Introduction
We analyze the aggregate implications of intra-firm bargaining in a fully-fledged, yet
simple, general equilibrium business cycle model with search frictions in the labor
market. The issue of intra-firm wage bargaining arises whenever the scale of the
firm changes non-linearly with its labor input. The two most prominent examples
are concave production and downward-sloping demand. The first example has been
studied by Smith (1999), Cahuc and Wasmer (2001), Cahuc, Marque, and Wasmer
(2004) and Rotemberg (2006). The second example has been analyzed by Ebell and
Haefke (2004) and also Rotemberg (2006).
We show how intra-firm bargaining implies a feedback eect in the bargaining
process from a firm's marginal product to wage setting. Firms have an incentive to
increase production in order to decrease the marginal product, and thus the wages
of existing employees, in order to capture higher rents. In eect, firms reduce the
bargaining position of the marginal worker by over-hiring. This partial equilibrium
scenario, however, implies a general equilibrium feedback eect in that it leads to an
expansion in production, and thus higher surplus to be shared among more workers.
With a tighter labor market, the additional hiring of firms improves the outside
options of workers, and thus raises their wage in general equilibrium.
The main contribution of this paper lies in the analysis of business cycle dynamics.
When compared to a specification that neglects intra-firm bargaining, the dynamic
response of the economy to a productivity shock is barely aected. The response
of unemployment is slightly magnified, depending on the degree of returns to scale
and elasticity of demand. Similarly, employment and vacancies rise slightly more. In
this respect, intra-firm bargaining plays a role as the bargaining position of workers
improves by less than is mandated by the rise in labor market tightness. However,

intra-firm bargaining does not aect the qualitative response of the economy and an
overall eect on output is virtually non-existent.
We interpret our findings to the eect that, in many circumstances, researchers
may safely ignore intra-firm bargaining even when analyzing business cycle models
with large firms that face decreasing returns or downward-sloping demand. This is
not meant to imply that there may not be important and interesting eects on the
steady state of a model. This has been explored, for example, by Ebell and Haefke
(2004). However, if we -- falsely -- calibrate a model without this strategic feedback
on wages to actual data where it is present, the mistake we make is likely to be small.
Intra-firm bargaining is not the driving force of significant cyclical dynamics.
The gist of this argument can be illustrated by means of the following static exam-
ple that abstracts from search and matching frictions. Consider a simple bargaining
problem of a large firm that deals with each worker individually. Employed work-
ers bargain over the wage z, with their outside option being unemployment which
generates benefits e. The firm's bargaining position is given by the surplus that an
additional worker generates, net of its outside option which is the value of leaving the
job unfilled. This outside option is zero.
Let the firm's price be s and its output |. The firm pays wage z and employs q
workers. Its value is given by its revenue minus cost, which consists of the wage bill
and the hiring cost:
Y = s|  zq=

The first term on the right-hand side would not be present if the firm were a price
taker in the product market; the first term in square brackets would be absent if the
firm were a price taker in the labor market. The latter would equal zero when firms
can only hire one worker, or when the firm does not internalize the feedback from its
employment choice to the wage schedule. The value of a marginal worker is therefore
the dierence between marginal revenue and marginal cost, pu(q)pf(q), which we
indicate as depending on the level of employment.
2For simplicity of exposition we abstract from fixed costs of hiring and intertemporal considera-
tions.

The Nash bargaining solution maximizes the weighted product of the involved
parties' surpluses. Given a worker's bargaining weight , the solution is:
z(q)  e =

1  
[pu(q)  pf(q)] .
Inserting the marginal cost term and taking account of the dependence of the wage
on employment, yields:
z(q) =

The wage is a weighted average of the firm's marginal revenue and the worker's outside
option. The second term in brackets captures the eect from intra-firm bargaining.
Marginal revenue is adjusted for the feedback of the employment choice on the wage,
which in turn aects the optimal number of employees. Stole and Zwiebel (1996)
have shown that this prompts the firm to over-hire. This feedback eect crucially
relies on the assumption that the firm's marginal revenue function is not independent
of employment. Otherwise, as in the basic one-worker one-firm set-up of Pissarides
(2000), the wage would not depend on q as pu(q) = s, for all q=
In the rest of the paper we proceed as follows. The next section outlines the
model under the assumption of decreasing returns to labor and matching frictions
in the labor market. This allows us to disentangle the relevant eect without excess
complexity. We then add general equilibrium constraints, calibrate the model, and
proceed to analyze the steady state and business cycle implications graphically and
numerically. In section 4, we discuss the similarities of the results to the case of
monopolistic competition, and show the robustness of our findings to its inclusion
alongside decreasing returns. The final section concludes and highlights some further
connections to the literature.
2 A Business Cycle Model with Search Frictions
and Intra-Firm Bargaining
We illustrate the eects of (neglecting) intra-firm bargaining (IFB) by means of a
simple model in which production is characterized by decreasing returns to labor and
firms are large in the sense that they employ multiple workers. This contrasts with
the standard search and matching framework in which production originates in one-
worker one-firm pairs. We assume an economy with a continuum of firms that use
3
labor as the only input in production. The production function of a typical firm is
given by:
|w
= Dw
q
w
> (1)
where 0 ?   1, and Dw
is a stochastic productivity process common to all firms.
qw is the measure of workers employed by the firm. We assume that all firms behave
symmetrically, and consequently suppress firm-specific indices. With the total labor
force normalized to one, aggregate employment is identical to firm-level employment.
Unemployment is defined as:
xw
= 1  qw
= (2)
The labor market is characterized by search and matching frictions encapsulated
in the matching function p(xw
> yw
) = px
w
y13
w
. It describes the outcome of search
behavior of firms and workers in that unemployed job seekers xw
are matched with
vacancies yw
at rate p(xw
> yw
) to produce new employment relationships. 0 ?  ?
1 is the match elasticity of the unemployed, and p A 0 describes the e!ciency
of the match process. Using the definition of labor market tightness w
= yw
@xw
,
the aggregate probability of filling a vacancy (taken parametrically by the firms) is
t(w
) = p(yw
> xw
)@yw
. The evolution of employment is then:
qw+1
= (1  )[qw
+ yw
t(w
)]= (3)
0 ?  ? 1 is the (constant) separation rate that measures inflows into unemployment.
Firms maximize profits by choosing employment next period and vacancies to be
posted, subject to the firm-level employment constraint. This job creation comes at
a flow cost f A 0. The Bellman equation is:
V(qw
) = max
qw+1>yw
{Dw
q
w
 z(qw
)qw
 fyw
+ Hw
w
V(qw+1
)} = (4)
V(·) is the value of the firm, w
is the time-varying discount factor, and z(qw
) is the
wage schedule, which will be determined below. The notation indicates that the wage
of the marginal worker potentially depends on the existing number of workers in the
firm. The first-order conditions are:
f = w
(1  )t(w
)>
w
= Hw
w
V0
w+1
(qw+1
)>
4
where w
is the Lagrange-multiplier on the employment constraint (3). The corre-
sponding envelope condition is:
V0(qw
) = Dw

w
 z(qw
) 
Cz(qw
)
Cqw
qw
+ Hw
w
V0(qw+1
)
Cqw+1
Cqw
= (5)
The presence of the derivative of the wage schedule reflects the impact of intra-
firm wage bargaining. When choosing employment, firms take into account how an
additional worker aects their bargaining position and thus wage setting.
We define the value of the marginal job M(qw
) = V0(qw
), and rewrite the envelope
condition as an asset equation:
M(qw
) = Dw
q31
w
 z(qw
) 
Cz(qw
)
Cqw
qw
+ (1  )Hw
w
M(qw+1
)= (6)
With constant returns to scale,  = 1, the marginal product of labor is Dw
(the `one-
worker one-firm' case), and the wage is independent of the firm's current employment
level. The asset equation then reduces to the one in Pissarides (2000).
Combining this with the first-order conditions results in a vacancy-posting, or job
creation, condition:
f
t(w
)
= (1  )Hw
w
M(qw+1
)> (7)
which can alternatively be written as:
f
t(w
)
= (1  )Hw

w+1
 z(qw+1

Cz(qw+1
)
Cqw+1
qw+1
+
f
t(w+1
)
¸
= (8)
To gain some intuition, suppose firms anticipate an increase in productivity Dw+1.
This raises the present value of profits and thereby the marginal benefit of hiring
more workers at given marginal cost f@t(w
). Other things being equal, more vacancies
are posted, and qw+1 is expected to be higher, which, in turn, reduces the expected
marginal product of labor until equality is restored.
This adjustment is aected by two additional channels. The first takes place
within the firm, hence the label intra-firm bargaining. Adding a worker reduces
the eective bargaining power of existing workers, and thus their wage. Assuming
Hw
Cz(qw+1
)@Cqw+1
? 0, which we will show below to be true, this amplifies the in-
centive to post vacancies and employment increases further. In order to determine
the quantitative significance of this eect, we need to solve for the equilibrium wage
schedule z(qw
)> which is done below. The other channel is a feedback eect which
5
arises in general equilibrium. As all firms post more vacancies, aggregate vacancies
increase, the labor market tightens, and it becomes more costly to recruit additional
workers with the rise in f@t(w
). Therefore, employment in each firm increases by less
than it would if w
where constant.
2.1 Determining the Wage Schedule
Wages are determined based on the Nash bargaining solution: surpluses accruing to
the matched parties are split according to a rule that maximizes the weighted average
of the respective surpluses. Denoting the workers' weight in the bargaining process
as  5 [0> 1], this implies the sharing rule:
Zw
 Xw
=

1  
Mw
> (9)
where Zw
is the asset value of employment, Xw
is the value of being unemployed, and
Mw
is, as before, the value of the marginal worker to the firm.3
The value of employment to a worker is described by the following Bellman equa-
tion:
Zw
= zw
+ Hw
w
[(1  )Zw+1
+ Xw+1
]= (10)
Workers receive the wage zw
, and transition into unemployment next period with
probability . The value of searching for a job, when currently unemployed, is:
Xw
= e + Hw
w
[iw
(1  )Zw+1
+ (1  iw
(1  ))Xw+1
]= (11)
An unemployed searcher receives benefits e and transitions into employment with
probability iw
(1  ). The job finding rate iw
is defined as i(w
) = p(yw
> xw
)@xw
which
is decreasing in tightness w
. It is adjusted for the probability that a completed match
gets dissolved before production begins next period.
We substitute the asset equations into the sharing rule (9) and, after some algebra,
find the wage equation:
z(qw
) = 

Dw
q31
w

Cz(qw
)
Cqw
qw
+ fw
¸
+ (1  )e= (12)
3In models with one-worker firms, the net surplus of a firm is given by Mw
 Yw
> with Yw the value
of a vacant job. By free entry, Yw is then assumed to be driven to zero.
6
Because of the presence of the derivative of the wage schedule on account of intra-firm
bargaining this a first-order dierential equation, the solution of which is:
z(qw
) =

1  (1  )
Dw
q31
w
+ fw
+ (1  )e= (13)
The derivative with respect to employment is given by:
Cz(qw
)
Cqw
= 
(1  )
1  (1  )
Dw
q32
w
? 0> (14)
which, when inserted into (12), verifies the consistency with the solution.
For given employment, intra-firm bargaining increases the wage by virtue of the
scale factor 1@ [1  (1  )] A 1. The addition of a worker to the workforce implies
a higher value to the firm as it lowers the marginal product of all incumbent workers.
A new worker has therefore a higher value to the firm than just his marginal product
because he contributes to lowering the firm's wage bill. By the logic of bargaining, the
surplus is split, and workers get their share in terms of a higher wage. However, for
the very reason that adding workers reduces the wage bill, firms post more vacancies
to increase employment. This lowers the marginal impact of adding workers, which
is declining in qw
. Thus, workers' marginal product decreases with employment and
hence the wage. Equation (13) gives the overall eect of the falling marginal product
on the wage, corrected for intra-firm bargaining.4
The wage schedule can be used in the job creation condition (8) to yield:
f
t(w
)
= (1  )Hw

1  (1  )
Dw+1
q31
w+1
 fw+1
 (1  )e +
f
t(w+1
)
¸
= (15)
Intra-firm bargaining leads to the term 1@ [1  (1  )] which reflects the firm's
internalization of the eect of employment on the wage. It exerts a level eect in that
the marginal benefit from adding workers is perceived to be higher. This induces
more job creation. For the case of constant returns,  = 1, the equation collapses to
the usual form, and intra-firm bargaining is irrelevant. However, our argument has so
far relied on partial equilibrium reasoning from the perspective of the firm. We will
analyze below the general equilibrium feedbacks both on the steady state allocation
and on the model's adjustment dynamics.
4In a sense, this setup can be interpreted from the perspective of insider-outsider theory: firms
are willing to expand employment and incur vacancy costs in order to reduce the bargaining power
of insiders. The crucial assumption is that the incumbents' wages are not protected by long-term
contracts, but are constantly renegotiated. The term `bargaining power' is, of course, used loosely
in the sense that the Nash bargaining parameter  is fixed.
7
2.2 Wage Determination without Intra-Firm Bargaining
We assume from the outset that firms internalize the dependence of the wage schedule
on employment (see Eqs. (4) and (5)). This allows them to act strategically and
extract rents from the workers. As an alternative assume that firms behave myopically
by taking the wage of its incumbent workforce as given when choosing employment.
This amounts to Czw
@Cqw
= 0 in the firms' problem. In this case, the value function
of the firm is:
M(qw
) = Dw
q31
w
 zw
+ (1  )Hw
w
M(qw+1
)= (16)
Following the same steps as outlined above, we find the corresponding wage equation:
zw
= Dw
q31
w
+ fw
+ (1  )e> (17)
and the job creation condition:
f
t(w

= (1  )Hw
w

(1  )Dw+1
q31
w+1
 fw
 (1  )e +
f
t(w+1
)
¸
= (18)
When comparing the two job creation conditions, the only algebraic dierence is the
term multiplying the marginal product of labor, namely (1) ? (1)@[1(1)].
Intra-firm bargaining scales the marginal product of labor and thereby introduces
an additional incentive for vacancy posting. The wage equations and job creation
conditions under both scenarios will be the reference points from which we evaluate
the general equilibrium eects of intra-firm bargaining.
2.3 Closing the Model
We assume that all workers belong to a representative household that insures its
members perfectly against income risk implied by the two states of employment and
unemployment. By means of a complete internal asset market, incomes are pooled in
such a way that all households have the same level of income.5 Assuming a CRRA-
utility function for the household, we can thus construct an implied stochastic dis-
count factor:
w
= 
f3
w+1
f3
w
> (19)
5This assumption is standard in the literature following Merz (1995) and Andolfatto (1996). Note
that the unemployed enjoy a higher level of utility than the working since they do not suer the
disutility of employment.
8
which firms use to evaluate future revenue streams. 0 ?  ? 1 is the household's
discount factor, and  A 0 is the intertemporal elasticity of substitution. fw
is the
household's consumption, which draws from production as described by the social
resource constraint:
fw
= |w
 fyw
= (20)
Total hiring costs fyw
are subtracted form gross production as resources are lost in
the search process.
3 The General Equilibrium Eects of Intra-Firm
Bargaining
This simple search and matching model with concave production provides a labora-
tory for analyzing the qualitative and quantitative eects of intra-firm bargaining.
We proceed in two steps. We first compute the model's steady state and compare
allocations across the two wage-setting assumptions. This discussion parallels the
results in Cahuc and Wasmer (2001). In the second step, we study the dynamic
behavior of the model and the implications for business cycle statistics.
In order to fix a baseline for the model's quantitative analysis, we calibrate the
parameters to typical values found in the literature.6 We set the discount factor
 = 0=98, and choose  = 1. The mean of the technology process Dw
is normalized
to unity. We assume that the input elasticity  = 2@3, roughly the labor share in
U.S. income. The separation rate is fixed at a value of  = 0=1, which is a mid-point
of the range of values used in the literature. The match elasticity  is calibrated at
0=4 based on the empirical estimates in Blanchard and Diamond (1989), while the
match e!ciency parameter p = 0=4 is chosen to generate an unemployment rate
of roughly 8-10%. To be consistent with this, we fix unemployment benefits e and
vacancy creation costs f at 0=1. Finally, the Nash bargaining parameter  = 0=5, in
absence of any supporting empirical evidence.7
6A more detailed discussion of the calibration of a closely related model can be found in Krause
and Lubik (2006).
7Note that this violates the e!ciency condition in Hosios (1990). We do not regard this as
restrictive for our purposes since, as Cahuc and Wasmer (2001) have shown, the e!ciency condition
is modified under intra-firm wage bargaining, and second we are not explicitly concerned with welfare
considerations.
9
3.1 Steady State Eects
The model's first-order conditions can be reduced to a two-equation system in unem-
ployment x and vacancies y (see Pissarides, 2000). The first equation is the Beveridge
curve, and is derived from the employment accumulation equation (3) in steady state,
after substituting the expression for the firm-matching rate t() and unemployment
q = 1  x. After rearranging, this results in a relationship between y and x:
y =

(1  x)
(1  )px
¸ 1
13
x= (21)
It is straightforward to show that this relationship is downward-sloping and concave
in y-x space.
The second steady-state relationship is derived from the job creation condition
(15). Substitution and rearrangement results in the following expression:
1  (1  )
(1  )
f
p
³y
x
´
=
(1  )
1  (1  )
D (1  x)31  f
y
x
 (1  )e> (22)
for which no analytical solution in terms of y is available. Instead, we solve this equa-
tion numerically for our baseline calibration. It can be shown analytically, though,
that the job creation curve is upward-sloping and mildly convex. Consequently, the
two curves intersect once, so that the model delivers a unique steady state equilib-
rium. The two curves determining the steady state are depicted in Figure 1. The
figure also contains the job creation curve that neglects the feedback from intra-firm
bargaining (IFB), which is derived from (18).
Steady state equilibrium is at the intersection of both curves which yields an un-
employment rate of 8=5%. Without IFB, the job creation schedule is flatter and tilts
downwards, resulting in steady state unemployment of 10%. This confirms the result
by Stole and Zwiebel (1996), subsequently refined by Cahuc and Wasmer (2001) and
Ebell and Haefke (2004), that intra-firm bargaining leads to over-hiring. Firms have
an incentive to add more employees since the wage paid to all workers is falling in em-
ployment. This eect is mitigated by the feedback that hiring has on unemployment,
as it raises labor market tightness and thus marginal hiring costs f@t(). Overall, the
level of vacancies and employment are higher in the IFB-case since firms can generate
higher surplus by diluting the eective bargaining power of their workers.8
8The underlying mechanism is not a labor supply eect in the traditional sense, which would
10
The same reasoning can be illustrated with an alternative description of the steady
state. We use the Beveridge curve to substitute out q in the wage equation (13), from
which we derive a relationship between z and , labeled the `wage curve'. The job
creation condition can be rewritten in a similar way. Both schedules are depicted
in Figure 2. We also plot the two schedules for the specification in which intra-firm
bargaining is neglected. The figure shows that both wage and tightness are lower
compared to the baseline with IFB.9 Recall that, for given labor market tightness ,
higher employment allows a firm to reduce wages paid to workers, and to increase
overall profits. However, when all firms act in this manner, labor market tightness
rises both due to more vacancy postings and to a decline in unemployment. The
overall eect on the wage is positive, so that intra-firm bargaining raises wages in
general equilibrium, which Figure 2 illustrates.
3.2 Adjustment Dynamics and Business Cycle Statistics
We now turn to an analysis of the eects of intra-firm bargaining on the dynamic prop-
erties of the model. In order to do so, we linearize both the baseline specification and
the model that neglects IFB around their respective steady states. Strictly speaking,
this analysis conflates two eects: the dierences in steady state, and the dierences
in the coe!cients in the dynamic model. It is quite conceivable that models with
identical steady states can have dierent dynamic properties. Similarly, dierences in
responses (which are themselves measured in percentage deviations from the steady
state) have to be interpreted with care as they are relative to dierent steady states.
This implied error in our framework is likely to be small since the dierences in steady
states are small.10
The resulting linear rational expectations models are solved using standard tech-
require increases in the wage in order to attract additional workers. More searchers find employment
since the increase in vacancy postings reduces labor market tightness, and thus increases the job-
finding rate, which is enough to compensate the marginal unemployed worker for the lower wage
rate.
9Since both schedules are aected under the dierent specifications, it may be conceivable that,
say, the wage increased or decreased. Analytically, the schedules with and without IFB dier by
a factor of 1@ [1  (1  )] that multiplies the marginal product of labor Dq1. The schedules
thus shift both in the same direction. Only for very small values of  such a reversal can occur.
10The conceptual background we have in mind is that a researcher might ask how much of an error
he commits when neglecting intra-firm bargaining. The reason for this neglect might be di!culty in
solving dierential equations of the type (12), and the possibly burdensome underlying first-order
conditions. Alternatively, a researcher may be interested in exploring the implications of myopic
behavior by firms that ignores the strategic incentives to expand employment.

niques. We first compare dynamic adjustment paths towards the steady state after
a productivity disturbance. Secondly, we contrast their predictions for business cycle
statistics based on simulated data. In order to describe the stochastic properties of
the model we have to calibrate the technology process. We assume that productivity
Dw
follows an AR(1) process with autoregressive coe!cient D
= 0=90, and driven by
a zero mean innovation %w
with variance 2
%
= 0=0072. This value is chosen to replicate
the observed U.S. GDP standard deviation of 1=62%.
The impulse response function for both specifications are depicted in Figure 3.
Two observations stand out immediately. First, the model exhibits an almost com-
plete lack of internal propagation. The behavior of GDP follows virtually in its
entirety the adjustment path of the productivity process. This observation has been
emphasized by Krause and Lubik (2006), and is a corollary to the Shimer (2005)
argument that the standard search and matching model is unable to replicate the
volatility of unemployment and vacancies. Second, and more importantly for our dis-
cussion, the responses are remarkably similar in terms of shape, size, and direction. A
persistent 1% increase in productivity raises current production and future marginal
products of labor. This raises the value of jobs, and thus vacancies posted, per the job
creation condition (15). This leads to increased employment in the following period
(see equation (3)). Workers experience a rise in wages on account of higher productiv-
ity and labor market tightness. However, wages rise by less than productivity because
of the strategic hiring decisions by firms. Thus, intra-firm bargaining does not change
the basic dynamics of search and matching, but it (slightly) modifies its strength.
We also compare business cycles statistics computed from simulations of the two
model specifications. The results are reported in Table 1. The baseline model is cali-
brated so as to replicate the standard deviation of U.S. GDP; the standard deviations
of all other variables are then measured relative to this value. The overall impression
is that the cyclical properties of the model with and without intra-firm bargaining
are virtually identical. There is no dierence in the behavior of output - which has
already been apparent from the impulse response functions, and the real wage. How-
ever, when intra-firm bargaining is neglected, unemployment, vacancies and tightness
are roughly 10% less volatile than in the baseline case. When compared to the corre-
sponding business cycle facts for the U.S. economy, both models fall woefully short:
the latter statistics are o by a factor of 10, the wage is 50% more volatile than in
the data.
12
In terms of contemporaneous correlations, both specifications produce identical
results. The models are reasonably successful in matching unemployment correlations.
A benchmark statistic is the correlation between unemployment and vacancies. The
model-implied value of 0=58 is not too far away from the value in U.S. data of 0=95.
However, the models produce perfect correlation between the wage, , and output,
which is inconsistent with the data. Overall, these result support the impression
that a model with intra-firm bargaining is essentially observationally equivalent to
one without. An empirical, likelihood-based test of both specifications would find
it very di!cult to distinguish between the two alternatives as they exhibit identical
comovement and only minor dierences between variable-specific volatilities. While
intra-firm bargaining is a conceptually compelling idea, and quite conceivably relevant
at the firm level, we conclude that it does not have a significant eect on aggregate
dynamics.
4 Monopolistic Competition and Intra-Firm Bar-
gaining
An alternative source of a declining marginal revenue product is downward-sloping
demand in an environment with monopolistically competitive firms. Even with linear
production, firms would be compelled, and are able to expand hiring since they can
capture rents by moving down the demand curve. This assumption has been used,
for instance, in New Keynesian models of output and inflation dynamics with search
and matching in the labor market. Key examples are Trigari (2004) and Krause and
Lubik (2006).
We assume that output of a representative monopolistically competitive firm is
linear in labor: |w
= Dw
qw
, and that each firm faces a downward-sloping demand
function for the product variety it produces: |w
= (sw
@sw
)3 \w
, where \w
is aggregate
demand, and sw
, the aggregate price level, both taken as given by the firm;  A 1 is
the substitution elasticity between competing varieties, and sw
is the individual firm's
price. The firm's real revenue is then given by:

sw

The asset equation for the value of a marginal job can be derived following the same

Note that despite linear production, marginal revenue is responds elastically to changes
in employment, which opens the possibility of intra-firm bargaining.
The asset equation for workers remain unchanged, and so does the sharing rule.
We can consequently derive a wage equation as before:
z(qw

It is straightforward to verify that this expression corresponds to the wage equation
(13), derived under concave production, if  = 31

. However, this neglects the general
equilibrium feedback eect from aggregate demand condition, captured by \w
, which
both parties in the bargaining process take as given. Substituting \w
= |w
= Dw
qw
, i.e.
assuming a symmetric equilibrium, results in:
zw
=

Dw
+ fw
+ (1  )e= (27)
The aggregate wage equation is now independent of employment (on account of con-
stant returns in production), but the feedback eect from intra-firm bargaining mod-
ifies the productivity coe!cient. If IFB is neglected, this coe!cient is 31

Since the employment equation (3) is unaected in the monopolistic competition
framework, we can describe the steady state solution by reference to Figures 1 and 2.
In the former graph, the shape of the curves is unaected, there is a unique equilib-
rium, and intra-firm bargaining results in over-hiring, as the job creation curve tilts
downward when IFB is neglected. Similarly, the steady state relationships depicted
14
in Figure 2 remain the same qualitatively. In the literature, the substitution elas-
ticity  is often calibrated with a value of 11, which implies a steady state mark-up
of 10%. Given our baseline specification with  = 0=5, the IFB feedback coe!cient
is 1@(1  @)  1=05, which is negligible with respect to steady state values and
dynamics.
5 A Final Generalization
Concave production and downward-sloping demand do not produce substantial eects
of intra-firm bargaining on their own for plausible calibrations. We therefore combine
both elements from before in the simple search and matching framework. Following
the steps outlined before, the wage equation that takes into account the feedback
from IFB, is:

The specification without IFB results in the same equations, the dierence being the
denominator of the term pre-multiplying the marginal product of labor. The scale
factor which measures the feedback from IFB is now 1@

. This
factor is increasing in , decreasing in , and decreasing in %. In other words, intra-
firm bargaining aects steady state allocations and business cycle dynamics more in
economies in which workers enjoy higher bargaining power (large ), the labor share
of income is small (low ), and markets are not very competitive (low %).11
We illustrate the role of IFB in the extended model by a few numerical examples,
which are reported in Table 2. We compute various model statistics for variations
of the parameters aecting the scale factor. In particular, we contrast our baseline
calibration with a high worker bargaining parameter ( = 0=9), a lower labor share
11This reasoning underlies Ebell and Haefke's (2004) finding that product market deregulation can
have substantial employment and welfare eects. In fact, their implied values for the substitution
elasticity is % = 3.
15
( = 0=5), and inelastic demand (% = 2). We first note that for an extreme parame-
terization, shown in the tight-most column, the scale factor goes up to 3, compared
to a baseline of 1=25. That this implies stronger eects of IFB is confirmed by the
percentage increase of steady state employment and wage over the case when IFB is
neglected, as the percentage change is monotonically related to the scale factor. For
baseline bargaining power, the change in employment is, however, fairly small, but
more substantial for wages. With higher worker bargaining power, these numbers
increase dramatically. What the percentages hide, however, are the actual steady
state levels. The second row in the table shows that employment actually falls with
increases in the scale factor.
An increase in the scale factor also has a monotonic eect on the percentage change
in the standard deviation of labor market tightness. For a given parameterization,
the inclusion of intra-firm bargaining improves the predictive power of the model as
far as the volatility of key labor market variables is concerned. However, this scale
factor eect again masks the fact that with high  and low % the standard deviation
of  is implausibly low. We conclude that the combination of concave production and
downward-sloping demand can increase the strength of the feedback eect of intra-
firm bargaining. From a pure calibration perspective, there is, however, a trade-o
between `maximizing' the IFB eect and the plausibility of key model predictions.
For empirically relevant parameter values, the IFB eect still remains negligible as
far as business cycle dynamics are concerned.
6 Conclusions
Intra-firm bargaining yields a strategic incentive for firms to expand employment in
order to weaken their workers' bargaining position. This expands employment and
raises wages in general equilibrium because lower unemployment and higher vacancies
posted raise workers' outside options, osetting the partial equilibrium eect. While
this is a conceptually compelling story of hiring behavior at a microeconomic level,
we have shown in this paper that the aggregate eects of intra-firm bargaining are
negligible in standard search and matching framework with concave production and
downward-sloping product demand.
The results in this paper should not be taken to imply that we regard intra-firm
bargaining as irrelevant per se. The specification that combines both sources of de-
16
clining marginal revenue product shows that somewhat extreme, but still plausible
calibrations can imply large eects. This raises a few questions for further research.
Given aggregate data, do the restrictions implied by an IFB specification help with
parameter specification? Specifically, the bargaining parameter  is di!cult to pin
down. Furthermore, it is often di!cult to fit the behavior of the marginal product
of labor, which might be ameliorated by the inclusion of the scale factor. A related
question is to what extent it is possible to distinguish between the two specifica-
tion in aggregate data. A second line of research delves deeper into the production
side. Cahuc, Marque, and Wasmer (2004) have shown that intra-firm bargaining
has dierent eects in models with capital and heterogenous labor. Depending on
the bargaining power of workers, it may actually lead to underemployment. Their
analysis, however, is restricted to the steady state only.
