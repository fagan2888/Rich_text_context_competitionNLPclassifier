Abstract: It is commonly assumed that judgments of dominance from faces partly rely on
implicit judgments of bodily strength. In two studies, we demonstrate such a relation for
both computer-generated and natural photos of male faces. We find support when
aggregating data across participants, when analyzing with hierarchical models, and also
when strength and dominance are judged by different raters. Moreover, we identify
common predictors that underlie perceptions of both strength and dominance: brow height,
eye length, chin length, and the widths of the nose and mouth.

Introduction
Judgments of dominance from the face track physical strength
One basic type of human social relationship is based on social hierarchies, with
some individuals having greater access to resources and more control than others (Fiske,
1992). Similar, but much more rigid, social hierarchies occur in the species most closely
related to us: chimpanzees, bonobos, and gorillas (Smuts, 1987). Social hierarchies of
larger groups of humans are evident at least from the point at which chiefdoms were
developed, and have been prevalent in human societies ever since (Boehm, 1999).
An individual who maintains a high rank in social hierarchies is referred to as
dominant. High rank can be the outcome of various determinants; one likely determinant is
bodily strength, important both to secure resources and prevail in dominance contests. In
line with other recent arguments and evidence (e.g., Fink, Neave, and Seydel, 2007; Sell,
Tooby, and Cosmides, 2009; Windhager, Schaefer, and Fink, 2011), here we provide
evidence for the idea that judgments of dominance partly rely on judgments of bodily
strength.

Facial maturity and dominance
Theories of interpersonal relations, perception, and judgment have long considered
dominance as a central trait (Wiggins, 1979). For example, in the interpersonal circumplex
model, the vertical axis of personality is dominance vs. submissiveness, with the second
axis being cold vs. warm (Wiggins, Phillips, and Trapnell, 1989). When people perceive
another individual, that individual is automatically categorized according to sex and age
(Kurzban, Tooby, and Cosmides, 2001), but they are also judged spontaneously in terms of
personality traits. Dominance is one of the two central traits judged from perceiving a
human face. For instance, Oosterhof and Todorov (2008) used a series of principal
component analyses to identify the dimensions underlying face evaluation. In a bottom-up
approach, they started with more than 1000 trait inferences from faces, narrowed them
down to 15 traits, and collected ratings of these traits, which were then analyzed. They
found two dimensions that together accounted for more than 80% of the variance of trait
judgments from faces. One of the dimensions was dominance, the other trustworthiness.
The judgments of the traits dominant, mean, aggressive, and confident were the closest to
the axis of the factor, with the trait dominant the most central. These findings led the
authors to consider dominance as one of the dimensions of face evaluation.
Facial dominance correlates with social outcomes. Muller and Mazur (1997) found
that West Point cadets with more dominant faces were more likely to attain higher ranks in
their career. The influence of dominance can also be seen in the courtroom, where plaintiffs
with more mature looking faces receive higher penalties than baby-face looking ones
(Zebrowitz and McDonald, 1991). Facial dominance also predicts election outcomes
(Chiao, Bowman, and Gill, 2008; Little, Burriss, Jones, and Roberts, 2007; Rule et al.,
2010).
Dominance and strength
Social dominance is determined partly by actual physical strength, which predicts a
man's rank in the social hierarchy in general (Von Rueden, Gurven, and Kaplan, 2008).
The notion of social dominance is usually characterized as a superior likelihood in
competitive contests of attaining the access to assets. Status is related with our chances of
survival, reproduction, and kin protection (Cummins, 2005). Puts (2010), while discussing
the mechanisms of sexual selection, posited that contests between men can be their central
process of sexual selection. According to him, typically male features such as a larger
body, more muscularity, and physically strength are related to males' evolutionary history
of fighting and competition. Thus, individuals with more strength have a higher resource-
hold potential or formidability (Parker, 1974). It is plausible that formidability contributes
to status both because of advantages in inter-individual contests for higher ranks and also
because it secures resources in contests with competitors outside of the hierarchy.
Additionally, men with a higher ability to inflict costs on others have a higher fertility,
which is related to social status (e.g., Von Rueden, Gurven, and Kaplan, 2011).
This reasoning suggests that mechanisms that evolved to perceive physical strength
routinely contribute to the formation of social hierarchies, that is, dominance. Indeed, it
would be zoologically unusual if it were not the case (Smuts, 1987). What is the evidence
for this assumption? Some insights come from research on the baby face overgeneralization
Dominance and physical strength

hypothesis. In general, this research tradition assumes that a number of traits are associated
with individuals who are either very high or very low in babyfacedness, such as social
submissiveness vs. dominance, social dependency vs. autonomy, physical weakness vs.
strength, and so on. This line of work has referenced bodily strength, but it has rarely
focused on it specifically.
For instance, Zebrowitz and Montepare (1992) investigated correlations between
ratings of babyfacedness and ratings of physical weakness (among other variables). The
two variables correlated for both male and female targets of all age groups after infancy,
and judgments of physical weakness also correlated with the composite variables reflecting
actual babyfacedness of the judged faces.
More recently, using handgrip strength as a proxy of human physical strength
(Rantanen et al., 1999; Wind, Takken, Helders, and Engelbert, 2010), Fink et al. (2007)
showed that women's ratings of men's dominance and masculinity based on faces
correlated with those men's actual handgrip strength. Gallup, O'Brien, White, and Wilson
(2010) also found that handgrip strength was positively correlated with self-ratings of
dominance and aggression. Similarly, participants with more upper-body strength reported
more aggressive behavior and entitlement (Sell, Tooby, et al., 2009). However, they do not
show exactly relations between judgments of strength and dominance based on face.
Supporting evidence also comes from findings that dominance and strength
judgments are determined by the same variables. For instance, Jones et al. (2010) created
masculinized and feminized versions of target faces. Participants then judged the
dominance and physical strength of those target persons. The masculinized versions were
judged as both more dominant and physically strong.
Oosterhof and Todorov (2008), using a data driven statistical model (Blanz and
Vetter, 1999; Facegen Main Software Development, 2006), rendered computer-generated
faces varying along the dominance continuum and found that faces tended to be more
mature and masculine in the positive extreme of the dominance axis. They assumed that
dominance dimension was "an overgeneralization of perception of facial cues signaling the
physical strength/weakness of the person" (p. 11091). Nonetheless, these participants were
never asked to judge how physically strong they thought the person was.
Sell, Cosmides, et al. (2009) arrived at a similar idea. They tested what cues people
use to accurately judge the actual strength of a person. The targets in their study were
actually tested for their objective strength through weight-lifting tasks. Observers'
judgments of physical strength correlated with the actual strength of these targets, both
when they saw the whole body, and also when they only saw the face.
Thus, the idea that physical strength underlies dominance ratings follows from an
analysis of the determinants of social dominance, has been prominently featured in
arguments on both facial dominance and judgments of strength, and is in line with previous
findings of the relation of judgments to actual physical strength. Here, we test directly
whether judgments of physically strength are related to judgments of dominance when
participants only see faces. Furthermore, we will take a variety of correlational approaches,
including tests for correlations when the judgments of dominance and physical strength are
coming from different participants.

Facial features of dominance and strength
In addition, we take a closer look at the facial features underlying such a
correlation. We explore if there are common facial predictors for both strength and
dominance. Zebrowitz (1997) showed that a babyface has large eyes, high eyebrows, small
chin, round jaw, and high forehead. A face judged as dominant typically features small
eyes, low brows, large chin, a more angular face and a low forehead (see also Keating,
1985; Lorenz, 1943). Studies of sexual dimorphism (e.g., Penton-Voak et al., 2001) reveal
that males have a bigger jaw, and a more prominent brow ridge and cheekbones. Because
masculinity can signal dominance (Muller and Mazur, 1997), more dominant faces share
those characteristics. Schaefer, Mitteroecker, Fink, and Bookstein (2009) demonstrated that
men's facial shape related to prenatal levels of testosterone was very similar to the facial
shape that emerged from women's ratings of masculinity and dominance. More recently,
Windhager et al. (2011) found that men's faces that were considered more dominant by
women were more similar to physically strong faces. Using handgrip strength as a general
measure of strength and with the help of a geometric morphometric (GMM) toolkit (e.g.,
Mitteroecker and Gunz, 2009), they were able to create a facial shape of men's strength.
After that, they asked women to judge men's dominance. These researchers found that the
dominant facial shape created on the basis of women's judgments resembled the physically
strong facial shape. They found that faces considered more dominant by women and faces
from men with a stronger handgrip had shorter noses, thinner lips and wider middle and
lower faces. It remains to be seen, using both judgments of perceived physical strength and
perceived dominance by the participants, if there are common facial features that can
predict both judged physical strength and dominance.
Overview of the current research
In the current article, we present two studies. We test whether perceived physical
strength is related to dominance judgments from the face. In addition, we explore which
facial features are common predictors of both perceived strength and perceived dominance.
In Study 1, we used computer-generated faces (dimensions 400 x 400 pixels) from
the set developed by Oosterhof and Todorov (2008). In the Study 2, we used a set of photos
(dimensions 337 x 400 pixels) of male faces assembled by Sell, Cosmides, et al. (2009).1
We collected judgments of strength and dominance for all pictures from both
datasets, and in addition measured all faces according to the dimensions described by
Zebrowitz, Kikuchi, and Fellous (2007).

Procedure. Data for both studies were collected online, using Qualtrics
(www.qualtrics.com), and recruiting participants through Amazon Mturk (Buhrmester,
Kwang, and Gosling, 2011). Participants were informed that the faces would appear twice
with different questions, but the second question was not revealed until all judgments on
the first question were completed. Participants were told there were no right or wrong
answers and to answer intuitively.
Participants first judged all pictures on one of the dimensions (strength or
dominance), and then all pictures again on the other dimension. The order of the two blocks
was counterbalanced, and the order of pictures within a block was randomized.
The faces were presented at the center of the screen with the question below. The
questions were "How physically strong is this person?" or "How dominant is this person?"
for the two dependent variables, with response scales from 1 to 7 presented below the
question, anchored with "very weak" and "very strong," or "not at all dominant" and "very
dominant," respectively.
Before the dominance block, we explained that by dominance we meant "how much
this person wants to influence other people and how much she or he is able to do so."2
Facial metrics. We measured the facial features with a procedure based on the one
used in Zebrowitz, Kikuchi, and Fellous (2007). Each face was loaded into software
developed by us using Processing (
For
strength, no such explanation was deemed necessary.
http://processing.org/). In this software, 40 facial points
were marked (see Figure 1) in all faces. These points were all marked independently for all
pictures by three research assistants. All distances used by Zebrowitz were used, and two
more were added (Z1 and Z2). All measures were normalized by the inter-pupil distance
(E2) (see details of measurement in Zebrowitz et al., 2007)3
There was a high inter-rater reliability for all facial measures. The measurements
showed a high agreement for the normalization distance (E2) for both Study 1 ( = .98) and
. We had 24 facial distance
measures in total (see Figure 1). One of these was the normalization distance (E2), and one
was the composite distance Facial Roundness. The other measures corresponded to facial
features of the brows, eyes, cheekbones, nose, chin, and head length. More specifically, we
measured the inner eyebrows distance (B1), distances related with brow height (B2 to B6),
the distance between the inner corners of eyes (E1), distance between the outer corners of
eyes (E3), eye width (E4), eye length (E5), nose width (N2) and nose length (N3), the head
length (L0), length of the jowl (S0), distance from the pupil to the center of the chin (C1),
chin length (C3), mouth width (M0), philtrum length (M3), thickness of the upper lip (M4),
lower facial width (W1), head width (W4), cheekbones width (W6), the Z2 thickness of the
lower lip (Z2) and the length from the beginning of the hair until the end of the head (Z1).
2 In this broad definition we thus include both potential and motivation for influence. Influence is a key aspect
of social ranking/status (e.g., Cheng, Tracy, Foulsham, Kingstone, and Henrich 2013).
3 It should be referred that this standardization through the inter-pupil distance is not able to erase the size
cues from the faces. Because of the importance of height cues in judgments of human face (e.g., Re,
DeBruine, Jones, and Perrett 2013), we recognize that this may influence the judgments of our participants.

Study 2 ( = .99). The average inter-rater reliability for all facial metrics showed a strong
agreement for the Study 1 database faces ( = .85) and for Study 2 faces ( = .93) (see
Table 1). We then averaged across the three raters all the facial distances measured and
used these means in all following analyses.

Participants
We recruited 69 participants (41 female) from the United States of America (USA)
and Western Europe through MTurk and paid each $0.50. The mean age was 34.5 years
(SD = 13.99, range 18 ­ 77).

Materials
Participants judged 60 computer-generated faces developed by Oosterhof and
Todorov (2008; see Figure 2). The pictures were created with FaceGen software (Facegen
Modeller program version 3.1, http://facegen.com). The rendered pictures show heads of
mostly White faces of both genders (for some faces, gender and ethnicity is hard to judge)
without hair or clothing.

Todorov, 2008)
Results
We used Linear Mixed Models (also known as hierarchical linear modeling) to
analyze the relation between ratings of strength and ratings of dominance, and the
mediation of this relation by facial features. For the mixed models, the units of analysis
were the single judgments made by the participants regarding dominance. Both picture and
participant were added as groupings of the observations. For both pictures and participants,
the intercepts were allowed to vary randomly. The dependent variable was ratings of
dominance.
In the first model, we introduced ratings of strength, order of ratings (strength first
vs. dominance first), gender of participant, and their interactions as independent and fixed
factors. We estimated this model with the Mixed procedure in SPSS 18. The strength and
dominance ratings were z-standardized (based on grand mean) prior to analysis. This model
showed that perceived strength was a significant predictor of perceived dominance,
F(1, 3933.14) = 247.89,  = .26, p < .001. Gender had no effect, F(1,61.94) = 0.10, p = .76,
and neither did order of judgment, F(1, 61.90) = 0.64, p = .53. There was no interaction
between gender and order, F(1, 61.92 ) = 0.15, p = .86.
It is possible that the second judgment assimilated to the first judgment. In order to
check for this possibility, we needed to resort to aggregated values. We aggregated ratings
of dominance and strength for each picture across participants, thereby creating a dataset
where the single pictures were the units of analysis. Note that aggregation across so many
observers reduces error variance, resulting in higher correlations overall. After that, we
standardized the dominance and strength judgments. We did Pearson correlations between
ratings of strength and ratings of dominance. A first correlation was computed using both
judgments participants gave, with each picture as the unit of analysis. The correlation was
Dominance and physical strength

very high, r = .95, p < .001. We then repeated this analysis using only the first answer each
participant gave for the aggregation. The correlation obtained was about the same, r = .94,
p < .001. This indicates that, for this sample, a face that was perceived ­ on average ­ to be
dominant was also perceived to be strong (see Figure 3), even when both judgments came
from different participants who did not judge the other dimension first.
Figure 3. Scatter plots of z-standardized mean judgments of strength and mean judgments
of dominance
We then tested which facial features predicted judgments of dominance and
strength. For this, we ran two models. In the first, dominance was the dependent variable,
and all facial features were added as independent variables. Pictures and participants were
again added as groupings, letting the intercepts vary randomly across both. The second
model was the same except that strength was the dependent variable. We then identified
which predictors were significant in both models.
In the outcomes of these models, we identified facial characteristics that predicted
both dominance and strength (see Table 2). There were three: brow height (negatively, 
= -0.51, p = .006 for dominance and  = -0.40, p = .037 for strength, B6), eye length
(negatively,  = -0.25, p = .011 for dominance and  = -0.26, p = .013 for strength, E5), and
nose width (positively,  = 0.15, p = .005 for dominance and  = 0.14, p = .013 for
strength, N2). In addition, mouth width (M0) marginally (negatively) predicted dominance
( = -0.09, p = .078) and strength ( = -0.09, p = .106). In sum, a person with a wide nose,
narrow (vertically) eyes, low brows and a narrow mouth is simultaneously seen as strong
and dominant. There was one facial feature - head width - that only predicted dominance
(negatively,  = -0.34, p = .04 for dominance and  = -0.17, p = .338 for strength, W4).
There was no facial feature that predicted strength but not dominance (see Table 2).

Discussion
In Study 1, when participants judged computer-generated faces, perceptions of
strength and ratings of dominance were closely related, as shown both in the mixed model
analysis and in the correlations based on aggregated values. Importantly, this was also the
case when those ratings came from different participants (always using the first rating).
Order of ratings and gender of participants did not make any difference.
Our analysis of facial features identified a wide nose, short (vertically) eyes, low
brows, and a narrow mouth as common predictors of strength and dominance. A less wide
head predicted dominance but not strength.
One problem with the second step of our analysis is that we investigated a large
number of predictors simultaneously in the multilevel models. This has the potential to
Dominance and physical strength

create false positives through accumulated alpha error. These results should thus be
interpreted as exploratory and subject to replication. Study 2 aims at providing such a
replication. There, we will jointly consider significance and inclusion in confidence
intervals as criteria for replication.
Study 2
Study 2 was conducted to replicate the findings from Study 1 with photos of real
faces instead of computer-generated pictures.
Participants
We recruited and paid 135 (78 female) participants from the USA and Western
Europe as in Study 1. The mean age was 35.61 years (SD = 11.87, range 18 ­ 66).
Materials
We used 62 photos of male faces (mean age: 21.1 years, SD = 2.4, range 18 ­ 32;
62% Euro-American, 15% Asian-American, 5% African-American, 2% Middle Eastern,
5% Hispanic, 11% other, with no significant differences in strength as a function of
ethnicity) assembled by Sell, Cosmides, et al. (2009; see Figure 4).

2009)
Results
We again set up a mixed model, predicting ratings of dominance from ratings of
strength, adding participant gender as a fixed factor, and both participant and picture as
grouping variables, allowing the intercepts to vary across them. Judgments of strength
predicted judgments of dominance, F(1, 8268.30) = 718.44,  = 0.29, p < .001. Gender had
Dominance and physical strength
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 12(1). 2014. -11-
no effect, F(1, 132.85) = 0.21, p = .652. Because of a software failure in Qualtrics, order of
scales was not recorded. Note however that order had no effect in Study 1.
We then proceeded by creating aggregate scores, averaging ratings of strength and
dominance across participants. We standardized these judgments and conducted Pearson
correlations. The correlation of these two aggregated variables was somewhat lower than
for artificial faces, though still quite high, r = .78, p < .001.
We also analyzed whether judgments in our study were related to the actual upper
body-strength of the judged targets (targets were assessed on weight lifting machines; see
details in Sell, Cosmides, et al., 2009). We used the aggregated values for these analyses
for the Pearson correlations (see Figure 5). Actual upper body strength was correlated both
with judgments of strength (r = .54, p < .001) and the judgments of dominance (r = .34, p <
.001). In other words, men with objectively stronger upper bodies are judged as stronger
and as more dominant purely relying on facial characteristics. To tease apart these
relations, we computed partial correlations. When controlling for dominance judgments,
the partial correlation between judged strength and actual strength remained significant, r =
.46, p < .001. However, when controlling for judgments of strength, the partial correlation
between dominance and the actual strength was not significant r = -.14, p = .308.
We then repeated the analyses performed in Study 1 (see Table 2) to determine
which facial features predict both strength and dominance. We found fewer common

(negatively),  = -0.38, p = .004 and strength marginally,  = -0.26, p = .072. Eye length
(E5) predicted marginally both dominance (also negatively),  = -0.19, p = .071 and

= 0.58, p = .024 and marginally predicted strength,  = 0.54, p = .061. In sum, a man
featuring low brows, (vertically) narrow eyes, and large chin will be judged as both strong
and dominant.

We found facial features that predicted dominance but not strength and vice versa.
Nose length (N3) predicted dominance significantly (positively),  = 0.26, p = .05 but not
strength,  = 0.11, p = .484. Distance from the pupil to the center of the chin (C1) predicted
dominance significantly (negatively),  = -0.54, p = .002 but not strength,  = -0.28, p =
.156. Brow height (B2) marginally predicted strength (positively),  = 0.55, p = .052 but
not dominance,  = 0.30, p = .207.
However, the facial features of nose width (N2) and mouth width (M0) that
predicted both dominance and strength in Study 1, did not show the same pattern in Study
2. Nose width (N2) did not predict dominance  = 0.10, p = .253 or strength,  = 0.10, p =
.333. Finally, mouth width (M0) marginally predicted dominance (negatively),  = -0.12, p
= .081, but did not predict strength,  = 0.04, p = .565.
Nonetheless, the -values for nose width (dominance:  = 0.10; strength:  = 0.10)
Dominance and physical strength

are within the Study 1 confidence intervals for dominance (0.05; 0.25) and physical
strength (0.03; 0.25). Consequently, it is likely that Study 1 overestimated the strength of
this cue, but that this cue is still important. The estimates of mouth width (M0, dominance
 = -0.12; strength:  = 0.04) fall within the limits of the confidence intervals of Study 1
only for dominance judgments (-0.19; 0.01), but not for physical strength judgments (-0.20;
0.02). Thus, Study 2 contradicts Study 1 here, and M0 is likely not used as a cue to
physical strength, but only used as a cue for dominance (see Table 3).

General Discussion
In the current paper, we demonstrate a relation between perceived strength and
Dominance and physical strength
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 12(1). 2014. -14-
perceived dominance for both computer-generated faces (Study 1) and photos of male faces
(Study 2). In both studies, using multilevel modeling, we found that judgments of
dominance were predicted by judgments of strength. When aggregating data across
participants, and taking picture as the unit of analysis, the correlation is larger than .90 for
computer-generated faces and larger than .70 for real faces. Importantly, this correlation
remains unchanged when the strength and dominance were judged by different raters.
Notably, the correlation between aggregated values of strength and dominance is
lower for the natural photos in Study 2 than for the computer-generated in Study 1. (Note
that Matheson and McMullen, 2011, showed that computer-generated faces have the same
perceptual and memory processing as natural faces). This could be the result of some real
targets not having perfectly neutral expressions, or not being uniformly bald, and thereby
providing other cues of dominance along with the cues related to strength alone (e.g.,
perhaps cues of hostility). However, it should be noted that the coefficients in the mixed
model did not differ substantially from each other.4
For the targets judged in Study 2, we had measurements of their actual upper-body
strength. Our data show that both the judgments of strength and dominance were related to
actual strength. In other words, it is not only the case that dominance judgments are related
to strength judgments, but also to actual strength. Thus, it seems that (accurately judged)
actual strength might serve as a cue to dominance. Even though in typical Western social
environments social status between adults is rarely negotiated based on physical strength
except in sports contests, both males and females base their dominance judgments partly on
facial cues of strength.
However, the modest correlation between dominance judgments and actual strength,
and also the finding that the relation between dominance and actual strength become non-
significant when controlling for judged strength, suggest that perceivers use other cues to
judge dominance as well. During human evolution, physical strength was an important
basic heuristic for social status given that it predicted the ability to inflict costs.
Nonetheless, the mental skills associated with leadership, the ability to solve problems, and
material possessions would also be important for a higher social dominance because of
their likelihood of increasing the ability to give benefits to others. Thus, not only the
increasing ability to win physical contests (i.e., greater physical strength), but also a greater
influence in the community through the benefits that they are able to confer to the general
population suggest that both processes can be avenues to perception of social dominance.
In tribal societies we can see that, for example, hunting skills, knowledge about migration
cycles of animals, and being elderly are linked to a higher social status. In industrial
societies social status is probably even less related to physical strength and more associated
with intelligence, social skills, and technological expertise (Cheng et al., 2013; Henrich and
Gil-White, 2001; Von Rueden et al., 2011).
Going beyond the identification of a relation between strength and dominance, we
identified common cues that may enable the assessment of strength and dominance. For the
4 We conducted another study that is not reported in detail here, which replicated Study 1 with a larger sample
(i.e., 300) of computer-generated faces. In that study, the correlation between the aggregated values of
strength and dominance was slightly lower than in Study 1, r = .84, p < .001. Thus, it seems that the
difference between Study 1 and Study 2 is less substantial than one might think.

natural faces the common predictors of high dominance and strength ratings were low
brows (B6), narrow (vertically) eyes (E5), and large chins (C3). In computer-generated
faces, common predictors were low brows (B6), narrow (vertically) eyes (E5), and wide
noses and narrow mouths (N2 and M0).
In previous studies, these facial features were already linked with dominance
judgments. For instance, the baby face overgeneralization hypothesis (e.g., Zebrowitz,
1997) posits that because babies have certain facial characteristics, people will judge
persons according to those. Thus if someone has small eyes, large chins and low brows
people will tend to see those faces as resembling a mature adult because babies show the
opposite pattern. Curiously, Dotsch and Todorov (2012) used a reverse correlation method
with natural faces and revealed that the most diagnostic facial cues of dominance were the
regions around the eyes and the delineation of the face where they included the chin.
Windhager et al. (2011) showed that the main regions related with perceived dominance
were a wide lower face, a short nose and small eyes. Although there were some differences
with the facial regions found in our research, these studies give support to the idea that the
main regions to track strength are essential to track dominance. We recognize that our
method of identifying these facial features shows some limitations. Because faces are
processed in a holistic way, that is, people tend to perceive and judge faces as a whole and
not as an identity of separated and independent features, this process of measuring multiple
facial distances between landmark points in space tends to ignore the general facial shape
(Holland, 2009).
It's important to add that our data by no means suggest that judgments of social
dominance and judgments of bodily strength are the same. As the study of Windhager et al.
(2011) revealed, strong faces and dominant faces are not identical. In their research, they
were able to show that strong and dominant facial shapes showed differences in certain
facial regions like the eyes, the eyebrows, the mouth, the chin, and the region between the
eyes and eyebrows. In our study, there were also differences in the facial features
predicting dominance and physical strength. More specifically, for the computer-generated
faces, the head width negatively predicted dominance but did not predict strength.
Moreover, in the natural faces we were able to show that a larger nose and a shorter
distance from the pupil to the center of the chin predicted dominance, but not physical
strength. Additionally, one of the measures related with the brow height (B2) predicted
strength, but not dominance. Besides that, the relation identified in the multilevel model
clearly suggests that a substantial part of variance in dominance judgments is not related to
bodily strength. It remains a task for future work to investigate where the two dimensions
might diverge despite the strong relation we found here.
In sum, we extend the knowledge related with the notion that dominance and
strength ratings go hand in hand, even when collecting these data from different
participants and when tested on computer-generated and natural faces. Dominance
judgments are based on strength ratings, backed up by the findings that actual bodily
strength predicts dominance.
