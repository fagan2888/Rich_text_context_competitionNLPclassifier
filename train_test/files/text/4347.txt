Introduction
Esophageal cancer continues to have a dismal
prognosis, with a 5-year survival rate of 17%
[Siegel et al. 2012]. Despite advances in medical
and surgical therapy over the past several dec-
ades, there has been relatively little reduction in
esophageal cancer mortality. Extensive research
has been performed in colorectal cancer to iden-
tify exposures that influence outcomes, and this
information has in turn has led to the identifica-
tion of clinically-relevant tumor subtypes with
potential therapeutic implications [Chan et al.
2009; Liao et al. 2012b]. However, there is only a
limited understanding of exposures that influence
esophageal cancer development, behavior, and
outcomes.
There is substantial data to suggest that aspirin
has chemopreventive effects in esophageal can-
cer, as prediagnosis use is associated with reduced
incidence and esophageal cancer-specific mortal-
ity [Thun et al. 1993; Rothwell et al. 2011; Liao
et al. 2012a]. However, its effects on outcomes in
patients with esophageal cancer are less clear.
Aspirin has been best studied in colorectal cancer,
where the timing of aspirin exposure relative to
diagnosis appears to be extremely important.

Abstract
Background: Esophageal cancer remains associated with poor outcomes, yet little is known
regarding factors that influence survival. Aspirin use prior to cancer diagnosis may influence
outcomes. We aimed to assess the effects of prediagnosis aspirin use in patients with
esophageal cancer.
Methods: We conducted a prospective cohort study of newly-diagnosed esophageal cancer
patients at two tertiary care centers. We assessed history of prediagnosis aspirin use, and
prospectively followed patients and assessed mortality, cause of death, and development of
metastases.
Results: We enrolled 130 patients, the majority of whom were male (81.5%) and had
adenocarcinoma (80.8%). Overall, 57 patients (43.9%) were regular aspirin users. In
unadjusted analyses, we found no difference in all-cause mortality between aspirin users and
nonusers. In multivariate analyses, prediagnosis aspirin use was not associated with all-
cause mortality [hazard ratio (HR) 0.86, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.48­1.57] or esophageal
cancer-specific mortality (HR 1.07, 95% CI 0.52­2.21). Prediagnosis aspirin use was associated
with a significantly increased risk of interval metastasis (HR 3.59, 95% CI 1.08­11.96).
Conclusions: In our cohort of esophageal cancer patients, prediagnosis aspirin use was not
associated with all-cause or cancer-specific mortality. However, risk of interval metastatic
disease was increased among those who took aspirin regularly prediagnosis. Future
studies are warranted to assess whether aspirin influences the molecular characteristics of
esophageal tumors, with potential prognostic and therapeutic implications.

reduced overall and cancer-specific mortality
[Chan et al. 2009; Bastiaannet et al. 2012;
McCowan et al. 2013], and there are now ongo-
ing clinical trials to assess its use in the adjuvant
setting. A recent study of esophageal cancer
patients found that combined pre- and postdiag-
nosis aspirin as well as postdiagnosis only use was
associated with improved overall survival [Van
Staalduinen et al. 2016]. Studies of prediagnosis
aspirin use alone; however, have had heterogene-
ous results, with some studies showing either no
impact on survival or possibly increased mortality
in colon cancer [Chan et al. 2009, Zell et al. 2009;
Coghill et al. 2011; Bastiaannet et al. 2012].
These paradoxical effects are difficult to explain,
but conceivably could be due to prevention of less
aggressive tumors, thus `selecting' for a worse
phenotype among those patients who do ulti-
mately develop cancer.
In light of the uncertainties regarding the effects of
aspirin in esophageal cancer, we aimed to investi-
gate the impact of prediagnosis aspirin use on all-
cause mortality, cancer-specific mortality, and
metastasis-free survival in a prospective cohort of
esophageal cancer patients.
Methods
Study population
Starting in 2009 we prospectively enrolled indi-
viduals with newly diagnosed esophageal cancer
at Columbia University and Weill Cornell
Medical Centers, two tertiary care centers in
New York, NY, USA. Adults 18 years of age or
older with histologically confirmed primary
esophageal cancer were eligible for enrollment in
the study. We excluded from analysis individuals
in whom the highest degree of esophageal neo-
plasia was high-grade dysplasia (previously clas-
sified as esophageal carcinoma in situ), who were
enrolled at, or greater than, 180 days after diag-
nosis, or who had a coexisting malignancy
(excepting nonmelanoma skin cancers) within 3
years leading up to the diagnosis and initial
workup of esophageal cancer. We obtained writ-
ten informed consent from all study participants,
including permission to obtain all follow-up
clinical records. At the time of enrollment, we
administered a questionnaire pertaining to
demographics, medical history, medication use,
and lifestyle factors (see below), and collected
blood and urine samples for storage. The institu-
tional review boards at both Columbia University
Medical Center and Weill-Cornell Medical
College approved the study protocol.
Baseline assessment
We recorded patient demographics and self-
reported height and weight, both at enrollment
and 1 year prior. Using a combination of patient
self-reporting and manual review of the medical
records, we recorded co-morbidities, specifically
noting any history of cardiovascular disease
(including coronary artery disease, congestive
heart failure, arrhythmia, peripheral vascular dis-
ease, and cerebrovascular disease). We used the
Charlson comorbidity index to quantify overall
comorbidity burden [Charlson et al. 1987],
excluding esophageal cancer from the calculation
as this was the disease of interest. We also
recorded family cancer history, medication use
(including specific notation of aspirin, non-aspi-
rin antiplatelet medications (i.e. clopidogrel,
dipyridamole), statins, proton-pump inhibitors,
smoking history (current/former/never and pack-
years), and history of alcohol use.
Aspirin exposure
As part of the administered baseline question-
naire, we asked patients whether they regularly
used aspirin (`Do you take aspirin regularly?' Yes
or no'). Among those who were current aspirin
users, we recorded the dose (81 mg, 325 mg, or
other) as well as the number of years that the sub-
ject had been taking aspirin prior to enrollment
(`For how many years have you been taking aspi-
rin regularly?'). For the purposes of analyses, we
categorized duration of aspirin use as follows:
none, <5 years, 5­10 years, >10 years.
Tumor characteristics
For each subject, we recorded the date of diagno-
sis, tumor histology (adenocarcinoma, squamous
cell, other) and differentiation (well, moderate,
poor). If the differentiation straddled two grades,
then we assigned the tumor the worse of the two
grades (e.g. well-to-moderate was classified as
moderate). We used endoscopy reports and surgi-
cal resection descriptions to assign subsite loca-
tion (classified as esophagogastric junction, lower
esophagus, mid-esophagus, or upper esophagus)
based on the most proximal extent of tumor. Any
tumor whose epicenter was located either: (1)
greater than 5 cm distal to the esophagogastric
junction; or (2) within the proximal 5 cm of the
Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology 9(6)

stomach but did not extend to the esophagogastric
junction or esophagus, was reclassified as a pri-
mary gastric cancer and excluded from analysis.
We assessed tumor stage using a modification of
the TNM classification from the 7th edition of the
American Joint Committee on Cancer [Edge et al.
2010]. We recorded clinical T stage based on the
results of endoscopic ultrasound, as well as patho-
logic T stage for those patients who underwent
curative resection (esophagectomy or endoscopic
mucosal resection). For analysis purposes, we
used the clinical T stage unless the subject had the
tumor resected without previously receiving any
chemo- or radiation therapy, in which case we
assigned the pathologic T stage. We used a simpli-
fied lymph node assessment, assigning lymph
node status as positive if there was clinical or path-
ologic evidence of lymph node involvement prior
to receiving any chemo- or radiation therapy. We
recorded the presence of distant metastases (yes
or no) as well as the site(s) of metastases. We clas-
sified subjects with involved celiac, paraesopha-
geal, or cervical lymph nodes as lymph node
positive but not distant metastasis positive [Edge
et al. 2010]. For tumors in which human epider-
mal growth factor receptor-2 (HER-2) overex-
pression was assessed, we recorded HER-2 status
as negative, equivocal, or positive.
Follow up
For each subject, we collected follow-up data with
regard to treatment received, imaging studies, and
follow-up endoscopies. Our primary outcome of
interest was all-cause mortality as it relates to aspi-
rin use. We identified deaths through chart review,
next of kin, and the Social Security Death Index,
and we recorded the date of death. Cause of death
was determined by consensus among two of the
investigators who were blinded to aspirin expo-
sure. We defined death from esophageal cancer as
a death that occurred as a result of tumor burden
(e.g. failure to thrive due to inoperable obstructive
disease or due to extensive metastases), tumor-
related complications (e.g. hemorrhage due to
tumor), or as a result of any treatments directly
related to esophageal cancer (e.g. post-esophagec-
tomy respiratory failure).
Statistical analysis
We analyzed categorical variables using Chi-square
tests, and for continuous variables we used rank
sum tests for non-normally distributed variables,
and Student's t tests for normally distributed vari-
ables. For time-to-event analyses for all-cause
mortality, we used the date of diagnosis as time
zero. We then calculated time to death for those
subjects who died and censored all others at the
last time point at which they were known to be
alive, based on direct contact with the subject or
the most recent data in the medical records. For
esophageal cancer-specific mortality analyses, we
censored subjects at the last time point at which
they were known to be alive or, for those who died
from other causes, at the date of death. For metas-
tasis analyses, we only included individuals who
were metastasis-free at baseline and for whom at
least 6 months of surveillance imaging was availa-
ble. We calculated the time from date of diagnosis
to the date of the first imaging study to demon-
strate metastatic disease. All others were censored
either at the date of death or at the date of the most
recent imaging.
We used the log-rank test to compare survival
curves in aspirin users and nonusers. We per-
formed multivariable time-to-event analyses
using Cox proportional hazards modeling. We
first performed univariate Cox modeling to assess
the unadjusted association between each variable
and mortality. We subsequently tested each one
of these terms for interaction with aspirin use; we
found no evidence of significant interaction
between aspirin and any of the other variables. In
the full model we included aspirin use as well as
all of the variables associated with survival at p <
0.20 in the univariate analyses. The variables
included in the full model were the following: age
at diagnosis, year of diagnosis, race, marital sta-
tus, use of non-aspirin antiplatelet medications,
use of proton-pump inhibitors, smoking history,
tumor histology, tumor subsite, T stage, N stage,
M stage, receipt of surgery. We subsequently
removed from the model one variable at a time,
choosing the variable with the highest p value that
was >0.15.
The sample size for the present analysis was not
based on predetermined power calculations. The
sample size from our analyses (n = 130) had 82%
power to detect a hazard ratio (HR) of 2.0 for the
effects of prediagnosis aspirin exposure on all-
cause mortality, and 80% power to detect a HR of
3.3 for development of metastasis.
We defined statistical significance as p < 0.05. All
analyses were performed using STATA 12.1
(StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA).

Results
We enrolled 159 subjects between January 2009
and August 2014, 29 of whom were excluded due
to: enrollment 180 days after diagnosis (n = 16);
coexisting malignancy within 3 years leading up
to diagnosis (n = 6); no definitive diagnosis of
cancer (n = 5); reclassification as gastric cancer
(n = 1); and withdrawal from study (n = 1). Of
the remaining 130 subjects, the majority were
white (89.2%) and male (81.5%), with a mean
age of 65.2 years [standard deviation (SD) 11.4]
(Table 1). The median time from diagnosis to
study enrollment was 48 days [interquartile range
(IQR) 22­109]. The median follow up was 21.3
months (IQR 10­38) for the entire cohort, and
30.5 months (IQR 20­53) for those still alive at
the time of the analyses.
There were 57 (43.9%) patients who used aspirin
regularly. Overall, 14 (10.8%) subjects were tak-
ing non-aspirin antiplatelet agents, and 10/14
(71.4%) also took aspirin. In multivariable logistic
regression analysis, aspirin use was associated
with a history of cardiovascular disease (odds ratio
[OR] 3.62, 95% CI 1.40­9.36) and statin use
(OR 4.72, 95% CI 2.07­10.73).
Baseline tumor characteristics are summarized in
Table 2. A majority of cases were adenocarci-
noma (80.8%), and most tumors were localized
to the distal esophagus or gastroesophageal junc-
tion (81.5%). HER-2 assessment was performed
on 64/105 (61.0%) of the adenocarcinomas, and
18/64 (28.1%) were HER-2-positive. A total of
90 (69.2%) individuals underwent surgical resec-
tion with curative intent.
All-cause and esophageal cancer-specific
mortality
A total of 55 patients (42.3%) died during the fol-
low-up period, corresponding to a 3-year overall

survival of 53.7% (95% CI 43.7­62.8%). We
found no difference in unadjusted all-cause mor-
tality between prediagnosis aspirin users and non-
users (log-rank p = 0.86). In multivariable Cox
proportional hazards modeling, we found no asso-
ciation between prediagnosis regular aspirin use
and all-cause mortality (HR 0.86, 95% CI 0.48­
1.57) (Table 3). There was also no significant
association between aspirin dose (p for trend =
0.96) or duration (p for trend = 0.91) and all-
cause mortality. In the final multivariable model,
non-aspirin antiplatelet medication use was signifi-
cantly associated with increased all-cause mortality
(HR 2.68, 95% CI 1.17­6.16).
A total of 35 patients (63.6% of all deaths) died
from esophageal cancer. In unadjusted analyses,
there was again no difference in esophageal can-
cer-specific mortality between aspirin users and
nonusers (log-rank p = 0.85). In multivariable
analyses, we found no association between predi-
agnosis aspirin use and esophageal cancer-specific
mortality (HR 1.07, 95% CI 0.52­2.21) (Table
3). We did not observe an association with
increased aspirin dose (p for trend = 0.42) or
duration (p for trend = 0.84). Non-aspirin anti-
platelet medication use was not included in the
final multivariable model.
Metastasis-free survival
At baseline, 120 individuals were metastasis-free,
of whom 89 had at least 6 months of surveillance
imaging. Of these patients, 21/89 (23.6%) devel-
oped interval metastatic disease. In multivariable
analyses we observed a significantly increased risk
of development of metastasis among patients who
reported prediagnosis aspirin use (HR 3.59, 95%
CI 1.08­11.96) (Table 3). We found a nonsignifi-
cant trend towards increased risk of metastasis

with increasing doses of prediagnosis aspirin
(p for trend = 0.097). We found no increased risk
of metastasis with increased duration of aspirin
use (p for trend = 0.15). Non-aspirin antiplatelet
medication use was not included in the final mul-
tivariable model.
We considered the possibility that aspirin users may
have been less likely to receive surgery. We therefore
repeated the analyses restricted to those who under-
went surgery for curative intent (n = 79), and found
no qualitative change in the association between
prediagnosis aspirin use and development of
metastases (HR 3.26, 95% CI 0.93­11.44). We
found a similar association in analyses restricted
to adenocarcinomas (n = 74; HR 3.32, 95% CI
0.94­11.7).
Discussion
In this analysis of a prospective cohort of esopha-
geal cancer patients at two large tertiary care
centers, prediagnosis aspirin use was not associ-
ated with all-cause or cancer-specific mortality.
However, prediagnosis aspirin use was associated
with a greater than 3-fold increased risk of devel-
oping metastases.
There are limited published data specifically
assessing the impact of prediagnosis aspirin use
on esophageal cancer outcomes. Tsibouris and
colleagues performed a retrospective case-control
study to assess the association between nonsteroi-
dal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), includ-
ing aspirin, and esophageal adenocarcinoma, with
Barrett's esophagus patients serving as controls
[Tsibouris et al. 2004]. In secondary analyses, the
authors reported no significant unadjusted asso-
ciation between prediagnosis NSAID or aspirin
use and overall survival, consistent with our find-
ings. Overall, two prior studies reported no sig-
nificant association between NSAID use and
esophageal cancer survival [Trivers et al. 2005;
Thrift et al. 2012]. These studies combined aspi-
rin and non-aspirin NSAID use in the analyses,
and defined regular use as at least weekly. The
effects of aspirin alone as well as dose and dura-
tion effects were not reported.
Parallels can be drawn with studies of aspirin
exposure and colorectal cancer outcomes.
Bastiaannet and colleagues conducted a popula-
tion-based study in the Netherlands, in which
colorectal cancer cases were identified using a
national cancer registry, and aspirin use was
determined based on a linked prescription record
database [Bastiaannet et al. 2012]. The authors
found significantly higher mortality among
patients who took aspirin prior to diagnosis for
both colon cancer (HR 1.5, 95% CI 1.2­1.8) and
rectal cancer (HR 1.4, 95% CI 1.0­2.0). These
effects may not be limited to cancers of the gas-
trointestinal tract. In a large population-based
cohort study of breast cancer patients from
Scotland, prediagnosis aspirin use was associated
with significantly increased all-cause (HR 1.62)
and breast cancer-specific (HR 2.10) mortality
[Fraser et al. 2014]. Other studies; however, have
had mixed results with regard to the effects of
prediagnosis aspirin and cancer outcomes [Chan
et al. 2009; Zell et al. 2009; Coghill et al. 2011;
Brasky et al. 2012; Li et al. 2012]. While we did
not observe an association between prediagnosis
aspirin use and all-cause or cancer-specific mor-
tality, our cohort was not sufficiently powered to
detect small to moderate effects.
We were surprised to find a significant increase in
risk of metastasis among those exposed to aspirin
prior to esophageal cancer diagnosis. Multiple
studies have demonstrated that aspirin use is asso-
ciated with a reduced incidence of and lower mor-
tality due to esophageal cancer [Thun et al. 1993;
Rothwell et al. 2011; Liao et al. 2012a]. We specu-
late that aspirin may prevent esophageal cancers
that are associated with better outcomes, thus
`selecting' for more invasive tumors. The cycloox-
ygenase-2 (COX-2) enzyme is commonly impli-
cated in the aspirin­cancer paradigm. Expression
of COX-2 is increased in both esophageal squa-
mous cell cancer and adenocarcinoma, and higher
levels of COX-2 expression have been associated
with more severe disease and worse outcomes
[Morris et al. 2001; Buskens et al. 2002; Bhandari
et al. 2006; Liu et al. 2006; Takatori et al. 2008;
Li et al. 2009; Jimenez et al. 2010]. If aspirin
exerts chemopreventive effects exclusively through
COX-2, then one would expect selective preven-
tion of these more aggressive tumors. However,
in a randomized clinical trial in patients with
Barrett's esophagus and dysplasia, COX-2 inhi-
bition with celecoxib had no impact on expres-
sion of COX-2 or on other markers associated
with neoplastic progression [Heath et al. 2007].
Studies in colorectal cancer suggest that the effects
of aspirin may be influenced by the PI3K pathway
as well as other factors such as BRAF mutation
status, 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase
(HPGD) expression, and circulating macrophage
inhibitory cytokine (MIC)-1 [Liao et al. 2012b;
Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology 9(6)
812 http://tag.sagepub.com
Nishihara et al. 2013; Fink et al. 2014; Mehta
et al. 2014].
We found that prediagnosis use of non-aspirin
antiplatelet medications was associated with
significantly increased all-cause mortality, but
not with esophageal cancer-specific mortality or
development of metastases. Patients taking non-
aspirin antiplatelet medications were significantly
less likely to undergo surgery and had higher
Charlson comorbidity scores (data not shown).
We therefore suspect that patients who used these
medications were at increased risk of death due to
poorer overall health status rather than a direct
effect of the medications, and that poorer health
status may not have been fully captured in our
analyses.
Strengths of our study include its prospective
design with aspirin exposure ascertainment at the
beginning of the study, thus minimizing recall bias.
All enrolled patients completed the administered
baseline questionnaire, and we thus had complete
data on prediagnosis aspirin use, including dose
and duration history. We successfully obtained
vital status information on all patients at the time
of data analysis. Histologic and staging data were
collected for all patients, and we were able to adjust
for important confounders in our analyses. We
were able to collect comprehensive information on
cancer treatment and progression, including devel-
opment of recurrence and metastasis.
Study limitations include our lack of information
about indications for aspirin use. Additionally, our
baseline assessment likely did not capture inter-
mittent aspirin use. We also did not collect data
on non-aspirin, NSAID medications. We did not
assess postdiagnosis aspirin use, which may have
beneficial effects. Compared with prospectively-
collected data, retrospective assessment of postdi-
agnosis aspirin use would likely have been less
accurate and subject to potentially significant
misclassification bias. We suspect that postdiag-
nosis aspirin use likely correlated with prediagno-
sis use, and postdiagnosis use would therefore be
expected to bias towards the null for the associa-
tion between prediagnosis aspirin and metastasis.
However, we cannot rule out the possibility that
many patients in the cohort were started on aspi-
rin only after diagnosis. The size of the study
cohort was not large, thus limiting our ability to
detect smaller, potentially meaningful effects of
aspirin on outcomes. The effects of aspirin may
differ by histological subtype, and the cohort size
limited out ability to perform stratified analyses.
Assessment of cause of death has inherent limita-
tions; however, we used an accepted definition of
cancer-specific mortality [Howlader et al. 2010;
Sarfati et al. 2010], and we used two-physician
consensus for each case. Lastly, our cohort con-
sisted of a heterogeneous group of patients who
were referred to two large tertiary care centers,
which may restrict the generalizability of our data.
In conclusion, in a prospective cohort of patients
with esophageal cancer, prediagnosis aspirin use
was not associated with all-cause or cancer-specific
mortality. However, we did find a significantly
increased risk of developing metastases. The rea-
son underlying these observations are unclear,
although we speculate that aspirin may `selec-
tively' prevent the development of less-invasive
esophageal cancers. The effects of prediagnosis
aspirin use should be investigated and confirmed
in separate populations of esophageal cancer
patients. Future studies should also be aimed at
assessing the molecular and genetic characteris-
tics of esophageal tumors in patients with and
without aspirin use prior to diagnosis, as these
biological differences may have important prog-
nostic and therapeutic implications.
