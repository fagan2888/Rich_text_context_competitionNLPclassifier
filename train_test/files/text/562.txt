Cruel Intentions? HIV Prevalence and Criminalization During
an Age of Mass Incarceration, U.S. 1999 to 2012
Bryan L. Sykes, Trevor A. Hoppe, and Kristen D. Maziarka
Abstract: A 2014 U.S. Department of Justice Best Practices Report
advocates that states eliminate HIV-specific criminal penalties except
under 2 conditions: when a human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-
positive person intentionally commits a sex crime or transmits the virus
by engaging in behavior that poses a significant risk of transmission,
regardless of actual transmission. We assess the premise of these
exceptions to understand whether these best practices are based on
scientific evidence about the population at risk of infection and the risk
of sexual violence by HIV-positive individuals.
We employ nationally representative, cross-sectional survey data
from the Current Population Survey (CPS), the Survey of Inmates in
State, Federal, and Local Jails (SISFLJ), and the National Health and
Nutrition Survey (NHANES).
Data from the CPS, SISFLJ, and NHANES are weighted and
combined to analyze bias in the population at risk of HIV. Linear
probability models are employed to estimate the likelihood that HIV-
positive inmates are incarcerated for violent or sexual offenses, net of
socioeconomic factors.
We find significant measurement bias in HIV prevalence rates.
The selection of national surveys for population denominators
distorts contemporary estimates of HIV prevalence by 7% to 20%.
Our findings also illustrate that HIV-positive inmates are 10 percentage-
points less likely to be incarcerated for violent offenses than HIV-
negative inmates.
National best practice guidelines may undermine effective social
policy that aims to curtail stigma within HIV-positive communities
because scientific evidence neither include inmates into prevalence
denominators (as a measure of the population at risk) nor assess the
likelihood that HIV-positive inmates commit violent or sexual crimes.

INTRODUCTION
A recent U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ) guide has pro-
posed to align scientific research about the risk of human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) transmission with best practices
on when states should use HIV-specific laws to seek criminal
charges and penalty enhancements.1 In particular, the DoJ
report says that ``states may wish to retain criminal liability
when a person who knows he/she is HIV-positive commits a
(non-HIV specific) sex crime where there is a risk of trans-
mission (e.g., rape or other sexual assault)'' or when ``the
individual knows he/she is HIV positive and the evidence
clearly demonstrates that individual's intent was to transmit
the virus and that the behavior engaged in had a significant risk
of transmission, whether or not transmission actually
occurred,'' (p. 4).1 Beyond these 2 circumstances, the best
practices guide recommends that states reform and modernize
laws to accurately reflect the underlying low risk of HIV
transmission from biting, spitting, throwing body fluids, inser-
tive/receptive oral intercourse, and antiretroviral therapy.
Yet, the infrequent application of HIV criminalization
laws, the rise of mass incarceration in America, and penal
policy changes in inmate HIV testing converge to raise 2
important questions about the sexual health and criminal
demeanor of the HIV-positive community. First, recent work
shows that growth in the criminal justice system has obscured
national estimates of wages, employment, educational attain-
ment, and political participation. As inmates are not included in
household-based sample surveys, national statistics on major
social indicators are distorted, with some estimates being biased
by as much as 60%.2 It is possible that such sample selectivity
among HIV-positive inmates induce similar statistical biases
that inflate the overall prevalence and risk, belying the rationale
for criminalization laws in states that rely on HIV prevalence
rates from household surveys like the National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). There is some
evidence that including inmates in national estimates of HIV
and TB makes little difference, but that finding is based on 1
wave of data that span 2 years.2 This study assesses bias over a
14 year period (i.e., 1999­2012) to investigate whether the
population at risk of HIV exposure is contingent upon the
inclusion of inmates.
Second, HIV criminalization laws emerged during the pre-
ART era when the potential for HIV transmission was very
high.1,3 Failure to disclose one's HIV status placed romantic
partners at risk for future infection, resulting in a sexual offense
that increased the risk of morbidity and mortality because very
few treatment options existed during the 1980s and early
1990s.1 Furthermore, HIV legislation associated and codified
into law specific violent and nonsexual acts that legislators
inaccurately feared could transmit HIV (biting, spitting, etc.).1,3
Thus, many states criminalized the failure to disclose one's HIV
status as a sexual offence as well as violent behavior among
individuals living with HIV, while other states enacted penalty
enhancements for HIV-positive defendants during sentencing

for other sexual offenses such as prostitution.1,3 In Tennessee,
for example, HIV exposure is specifically categorized as a
violent offense that requires public sex offender registration
for life.4 One supposition of HIV criminalization laws is that, by
failing to disclose their infection, individuals who are infected
seek to intentionally (or negligently) infect their partners and
the population through sexual offenses and violent acts. Yet
research has not focused on how crimes committed by HIV-
positive inmates differ from the overall crimes of other inmates.
HIV criminalization laws rest partly on the assumption that the
overall risk of transmitting the infection within the general
population is high, regardless of treatment or safer sex practices.
However, no research has assessed whether HIV-positive
inmates are more or less likely to be jailed or imprisoned for
violent offenses, in comparison to HIV-negative inmates. If
HIV criminalization laws are meant to redress illegalities
associated with sexually transmitting the infection without a
partner's knowledge or violence that threatens public health, the
likelihood of serving sentences for violent acts should be greater
among HIV-positive inmates (compared to non-HIV inmates)
once the distribution of possible offenses (violent, drug, prop-
erty, etc.) is controlled.
This paper makes 3 contributions to the literature. First, we
assess measurement biases in HIV prevalence from national
household-based surveys that do not include incarcerated popu-
lation, which may be used to generate state-specific HIV
prevalence rates in the absence of access to surveillance data.
These household surveys can be used to set national and state
social policy on corrections and population health.2 Second, we
show how statistical biases in household surveys undermine the
conceptual basis for HIV criminal laws, particularly for states
that draw on data from the noninstitutionalized population to
make general claims that buttresses social policy. Finally, we
present a general criticism of the legal basis for HIV criminal
laws that make assumptions about criminal intent and violent
dispositions among individuals living with HIV/AIDS.1,3
BACKGROUND
In 2008, 1 in 100 adults was behind bars,5 but over 64
million adults had some form of arrest or criminal conviction,
representing 30% of the American adult population.6 By the
close of 2012, nearly 2.23 million men and women were
incarcerated in local, state, and federal correctional facilities,
and another 4.79 million were under some form of criminal
justice supervision.7 Exposure to the criminal justice system is
not uniform; race and class inequality in the likelihood of
incarceration has grown over the last 40 years,8,9 with the
life-time risk of imprisonment among young, undereducated
African-American men hovering around 70%.2,10,11
The expansion of the criminal justice system is known to
significantly shape population health. Incarceration is associ-
ated with an increased risk of infectious disease, stress, depres-
sion, unhealthy eating habits, body mass indexes (BMI), and
smoking,12­16 and recent work links incarceration to excess
infant mortality in America and Denmark.17,18 Mass incarcera-
tion has such a profound impact on levels of social inequality in
America that the health effects spill into and diffuse through
communities, as male incarceration rates in the early 1980s
through the mid-1990s are shown to be strongly associated with
AIDS rates among men and women.19
During the rise of the AIDS epidemic, state legislatures
began legislating sexual and social behavior around HIV-status.
Twenty-four states currently impose misdemeanor or felony
penalties on HIV-positive people for engaging in a range of
practices.20 Most statutes criminalize sexual contact without
first disclosing one's HIV-positive status, regardless of whether
that contact poses a risk of transmitting the virus; others are
widely construed to criminalize a range of potential exposures,
even behaviors that are not plausible transmission pathways
such as spitting and biting.20 In addition, a handful of other
states impose sentence enhancements on HIV-positive defen-
dants convicted of other sexual offenses such as rape or
prostitution. In total, 32 states currently have an HIV-specific
criminal statute on the books.20
Although HIV was largely terminal without treatment
during the pre-ART era, the introduction of antiretrovirals in
1995 substantially increased survivorship. These treatments not
only transformed the disease into a chronic, manageable illness,
but also greatly reduced the infectiousness of those taking
it.21,22 Data recently announced from a trial involving virally
suppressed partners in both heterosexual and same-sex sero-
discordant relationships (where one partner is HIV-positive and
the other HIV-negative) who were not using condoms at least
some of the time reveal that, after an estimated 44,400 sexual
encounters, zero transmissions were observed.23
Although the science of HIV treatment and prevention has
dramatically advanced in the 30 years since its discovery, the
criminal laws governing those infected with HIV have remained
largely static. The majority of HIV-specific criminal laws were
enacted during the mid-1980s and early 1990s during a general
panic about the disease and its potential to spread from minority
communities to the general population.24,25 In this context,
states enacted broadly construed laws that could be used to
criminalize sexual contact without any risk of transmission.
Additionally, some policy debates have centered on highly
aberrant cases involving male defendants (often of color)
infecting multiple (often white) female partners.26 However,
an analysis of convictions under Michigan's felony HIV dis-
closure statute between 1992 and 2010 reveals that less than 5%
of convictions involved a defendant accused of transmitting the
disease to a partner.27 The vast majority of cases involved a
sexual exposure without transmission, some involving no or low
risk sexual behaviors ­ such as a 2009 case involving an HIV-
positive Michigan dancer accused of allowing a male client's
nose to ``penetrate'' her vagina during a lapdance.27
The criminal justice system is known to structure and
recreate inequalities in health among inmates by selectively
testing prisoners for HIV depending on state-specific laws and
institutional facility type (jail, state prison, etc.).28 For instance,
although inmates are at a higher risk of contracting HIV/AIDS
than the general population,29 state legislatures enact different
guidelines about when and where to test inmates for this
infection. In 2004, 18 states had policies specifically aimed
at testing all inmates for HIV at admission into prison/jail, while
only 2 states had policies for testing inmates in custody, and 3
states tested prisoners upon release.30 Nationally, the number of
states that mandated HIV testing among inmates was greater
around the dawn of the millennium than in subsequent years.
Between 2000 and 2004, federal prisons ended testing all
inmates and began testing groups they deemed to be high-
risk.28 We assess the 2 critical suppositions of HIV criminaliza-
tion laws: whether a prominent, national household survey
routinely used to generate state-specific estimates of HIV over-
states the level of prevalence in the population due to the
exclusion of inmates; and whether inmates with HIV are more
or less violent than non-HIV infected inmates.

METHODS
Data
We use publicly available data from the NHANES from
1999 to 2012. NHANES data are collected by the National
Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), as part of the Centers for
Disease Control (CDC). Data on the health and well-being of
the U.S. population have been gathered by NHANES surveys
since the 1960s. These data capture demographic, dietary, and
health-related markers of a nationally representative sample of
about 5000 residents each year.31 NHANES administers bien-
nial laboratory tests for HIV antibodies to estimate the preva-
lence of HIV in the population. The age of the participants
varied by survey wave, with the range going from 18­49 in
1999 to 18­59 in 2012. To standardize across years, we limit the
age range from 20 to 49 and apply survey weights to obtain
nationally representative statistics by race. As the vast majority
of inmates are male, we restrict our analysis to men.
We also leverage data from the Survey of Inmates in State,
Federal, and Local custody. Data for the Survey of Inmates
series are collected by the U.S. Census Bureau and distributed
by the Bureau of Justice Statistics.32­35 The Survey of Inmates
is nationally representative sample of all inmates held in
correctional facilities throughout the United States. Respon-
dents include inmates being held pretrial, those serving local
sentences, and those awaiting transfer into the custody of
another correctional facility. The Survey of Inmates in State
and Federal Correctional Facilities was administered in 1997
and 2004. Data from the Survey of Inmates in Local Jails were
collected in 1996 and 2002. In each of these surveys, inmates
were asked if they were ever tested for HIVand for the result of
the test. To construct panel estimates of HIV prevalence among
American inmates, we estimate the distribution of inmates who
report being positive by race, weighted in proportion to aggre-
gate penal population counts from Bureau of Justice Statistics.
Estimates from between survey years are linearly interpolated,
and postsurvey year prevalence is assumed to follow the
weighted distribution of the most recent survey. This method
has been used to construct time-series for parental incarceration,
wage inequality, and the life-time risk of imprisonment.2,9­
11,36­38 Further details on our methodology and additional data
used to produce these estimates can be found in other work.2,10
To make the analysis consistent with NHANES, we limit the
sample to men age 20 to 49.
Population denominators to calculate prevalence rates are
obtained from 2 sources. When weighted, NHANES totals
represent the noninstitutionalized population. Another source
of information about population counts come from the March
Current Population Survey (CPS). Each month the CPS samples
approximately 50,000 to 60,000 Americans living in house-
holds, and survey measures capture the demographic and labor
market attributes of the noninstitutionalized population. CPS
data are jointly collected by the U.S. Census Bureau and the
Bureau of Labor Statistics, and the CPS has been fielded
monthly since the 1940s.39 We compare HIV prevalence rates
under each of these surveys to ensure that any bias in rates due to
institutionalization are not due to population count differences
between surveys.
As this observational study relies on publicly available,
secondary data sources that have been anonymized for wide-
spread use, the risk to potential subjects is low. The data have
been collected by government agencies tasked with anonymiz-
ing survey participants and ensuring minimal harm, and the data
have been deidentified and cannot be linked. As such, the
Institutional Review Board at the University of California-
Irvine classifies this research as exempt from review.40
RESULTS
Table 1 displays the descriptive statistics for the Survey of
Inmates and NHANES for the years that begin and end our
survey. Although subsequent analyses are only for men, this
table is used to display the overall sample demographics. Over
90% of all inmates are male, compared to almost half of
respondents who had their blood tested by NHANES. Although
the overall modal ages are fairly similar for 1999 and 2012
among American inmates, the mean age among the NHANES
sample increased over 5 years between 1999 and 2012.
Similarly, the racial composition of the inmates in jails and
prisons remained fairly stable, with roughly 65% of all inmates
being non-Hispanic Whites. The NHANES sample shows rela-
tively stable percentages among non-Hispanic Blacks and

Hispanics over the period, but the percentage of non-Hispanic
Whites declines by almost 5 percentage-points, and the non-
Hispanic Other group more than doubled in size.
The educational disadvantage of American inmates has
also increased overtime. In 1999, roughly 41.4% of all men and
women behind bars had less than a high school diploma (i.e.,
they dropped out of high school). By 2012, that estimate
increased by 14.3 percentage-points to 55.7%. Shifts in the
educational redistribution of inmates were largely at the
expense of inmates who completed high school, as the percen-
tage of inmates with a high school diploma dropped from 47.4%
in 1999 to 35.4 in 2012. Respondents in the NHANES sample,
on the other hand, experienced opposite movement in the
redistribution of educational attainment. Although individuals
with low levels of education experienced some declines in
representation between 1999 and 2012, highly advantaged
respondents became more prevalent by 2012. College educated
men and women, for example, increased their responsiveness by
9.2%-points, with 62.1% of NHANES respondents having some
college education.
The shifting educational distribution in these surveys
raises important questions about whether HIV prevalence is
concealed and distorted when institutions like the criminal
justice system concentrate disadvantage and inmates remain
outside sample selection eligibility for national surveys. Indeed,
some scholars have raised this concern for a number of clinical
trial studies, where individuals unincarcerated in earlier waves
of a study cannot be followed at later times due to incapacitation
and IRB protocols around inmate research.41 Table 1 shows that
HIV prevalence among inmates increased from 2.8% in 1999 to
3.3% by 2012. Comparatively, lab work by NHANES shows
that the percentage of Americans who are HIV-positive
declined, going from 1.1% in 1999 to 0.42% by 2012. As
inmates are disproportionately poor and possess low levels of
education,36 resulting in their exclusion from national house-
hold-based surveys,2,38 a reexamination of HIV prevalence
rates and bias due to their exclusion is warranted.
Quantifying Bias in HIV Prevalence
Currently, more than 1.2 million people are living with
HIV.42 Although national HIV prevalence estimates from the
CDC are based on surveillance site statistics, national house-
hold-based surveys like NHANES are another source of data for
states that seek to utilize social and epidemiological data on
HIV prevalence within the population. The potential use of
NHANES data to set social policy around state-specific HIV
criminalization laws has yet to be investigated.
To understand whether the rationale for HIV criminaliza-
tion laws may be due to an overestimated risk of HIV spreading
throughout the population due violent and deviant behavior, the
number of Americans living with HIV (i.e., the numerator) must
be standardized before adjusting the national prevalence rates
for individuals living outside of households or in institutions.
Thus, cases reported to the CDC by its surveillance programs
must be reconciled with national survey estimates from
NHANES. Table 2 shows the number of male adult or adoles-
cent cases from 2008 to 2010. Even if the total population (i.e.,
the denominator) included all persons in the United States,
NHANES would overestimate HIV prevalence because the
number of cases diverges from published CDC estimates in 2
of the 3 most recent years. For instance, NHANES HIV-positive
cases are 2.8% and 10.6% greater than CDC estimates in 2008
and 2009, respectively. Only in 2010 does the number of HIV
cases converge between NHANES and CDC estimates, with
NHANES reporting 0.149% fewer infected individuals.
Prevalence estimates require information from household
surveys on the noninstitutionalized to generate population
counts. The total population counts from NHANES differ
significantly from the CPS. Population counts from NHANES
produce different HIV prevalence estimates than population
counts from CPS. Similar to Table 2, where the incident counts
differed for the numerator, the population counts for the
denominator also induce sizeable differences in HIV prevalence
rates. The population counts for the denominator (i.e., the
population at risk of exposure) can induce sizeable differences
in HIV prevalence rates. We fix the numerator to be the number
of HIV cases from NHANES and vary only the population
denominators. If all members living in households have the

same sampling probability across surveys, then HIV prevalence
estimates between NHANES and the CPS should not differ
significantly. Figure 1 shows the level of denominator bias
associated with survey selection. Positive estimates indicate that
prevalence rates are higher when using the NHANES population
as the base, and negative estimates indicate that using population
totals from the CPS lowers the prevalence rate. For example,
while NHANES and CPS denominators made little difference in
the total HIV prevalence rate for 1999 to 2001, since 2002, bias in
population counts have diverged between the surveys. Current
estimates indicate that CPS population totals produce a rate that is
7.8% lower than NHANES. Race-specific HIV prevalence rates
are particularly distorted, as NHANES overrepresented preva-
lence among non-Hispanic Blacks by 7.8% in 1999. By 2012,
CPS population totals lowered HIV prevalence by 19.3% com-
pared to population counts from NHANES. Prior to 2002, CPS
population rates underrepresented HIV prevalence among His-
panics. After that period, however, NHANES overestimated their
prevalence rates.
As population counts are known to produce different
estimates before including inmates, we average CPS and
NHANES population counts to limit the overall bias associated
with choosing between surveys. We estimate bias in the HIV
prevalence rate due to excluding inmates from household-based
surveys in Figure 2. Positive numbers indicate that current HIV
prevalence rates should adjusted upward by the corresponding
percentage to include inmates. Negative numbers indicate that
the inclusion of inmates lowered prevalence rates by the
corresponding percentage. Including inmates generally
increases national HIV prevalence rates. Yet, for non-Hispanic
Blacks, inmate inclusion lowers national HIV prevalence for
many of the years in our study. This finding is consistent with
past research that examined 1 wave of NHANES data during the
mid-2000s.2
Dangerous Liaisons?
Most men are incarcerated for nonviolent and nonsexual
crimes. Table 3 presents the distribution of controlling offenses
(or the most serious crime) among inmates by race. HIV-
positive inmates were incarcerated for violent offenses at rates
substantially lower than other inmates. For example, in 1999,
22.1% of all inmates were incarcerated for violent offenses
compared to 14.5% of HIV-positive inmates, a 7.6%-point
difference (P < 0.001). The rise in mass incarceration changed
the overall offending composition by the end of our time series.
By 2012, the percentage of HIV-positive inmates incarcerated
for violent offenses was lower than the overall population by
8.1 percentage-points (P < 0.001). The fraction of non-
Hispanic Black men living with HIV who committed a violent
offense was almost 15 percentage-points lower (P < 0.001)
than the overall population of Black inmates.

Inmates, the NHANES and the CPS. Note: Positive numbers

In Table 4, we fit probit models to estimate differences in
the likelihood that HIV-positive inmates are more/less violent
than HIV-negative inmates. We report marginal effects, which
express the rate of change in the dependent variable (i.e., the
predicted probability) relative to a unit change in an indepen-
dent variable.43,44 All models are evaluated at their mean
values. HIV-positive men were 10%-points less likely to have
a violent offense than HIV-negative inmates. In fact, HIV-
positive inmates are statistically more likely to be incarcerated
for drug and property crimes (2.6% and 7.3%, respectively), not
sexual or violent offenses. Although drug and property crimes
may increase the likelihood of experiencing violence, these
findings indicate that HIV-positive inmates are significantly
less violent than their counterparts.
DISCUSSION
When HIV entered the national consciousness in the
1980s, HIV-positive people were quickly labeled as deviant
by those holding homophobic views, increasing their willing-
ness to believe myths of dangerousness.45 Perceptions of HIV-
infected persons as risky, dangerous, and threatening permeated
public discourse to the point that a 1988 General Social Survey
item revealed that 63.7% of Americans were in favor of a
government mandate that would require HIV-positive individ-
uals to wear identification tags.46 The stigma associated with
infection resulted in HIV criminalization laws that relied on
national statistics about HIV prevalence among high risk
groups, as well as misguided and biased assumptions about
the criminal nature of HIV-positive men and women.
Recent studies suggest that HIV-specific criminal laws are
not uniformly applied across the population. One study shows
that HIV-positive heterosexual Black men are more likely to
have been convicted under the Michigan nondisclosure law as
compared to their White counterparts.47 Contrary to expec-
tations, however, HIV-positive gay men in the state were much
less likely to have faced conviction as compared to their
heterosexual counterparts. These findings echo those of other
work,4 which shows that 80% of arrestees under Tennessee's
HIV-specific criminal law, who were subsequently tried in
Nashville courts between 2000 and 2010, involved men or
women with opposite-gendered partners. Findings from Michi-
gan and Tennessee underscore how HIV criminalization laws
may be differentially applied to segments of the population
based on beliefs about the risk of transmission, disclosure,
violent intentions, and institutional discrimination by race
and sexual orientation.
HIV criminalization laws promulgate myths of dangerous-
ness through the presumption of individual duplicity between
partners and collective misunderstandings about the overall risk
to the population at large. Distorted prevalence and incidence
rates due to survey and sample bias contribute to such mis-
conceptions by obscuring scientific facts about HIV trans-
mission and the relative rate of violent offenses among those
who are infected. Our study finds that the population at risk of
exposure is significantly overestimated and that HIV-positive
inmates are significantly less likely to be incarcerated for
violent offenses. HIV-specific laws compound the stigma
associated with being HIV-positive, even if inmates are incar-
cerated for nonviolent and nonsexual crimes. An unintended
consequence of this legislation is the further stigmatization of
minority groups and communities, which may induce greater
levels and varied forms of deviance as a result of increased
ostracization and internalization of deviant labels.48,49
We show that the very premise of these criminalization
laws are problematic in at least 2 respects. First, the correctional
system incarcerates many individuals experiencing the most
serious social problems in the country. Prisons and jails con-
centrate disadvantaged men, most of whom have low levels of
education and are disproportionately non-White.36 The rise of
mass incarceration since the 1980s has come to obscure basic
social facts about a host of population processes, including HIV
prevalence rates overtime when estimated using household-
based data. Thus, health advocates and legislators should
exercise caution when relying on nonsurveillance data from
household surveys to devise state-specific social policy.
Second, HIV criminalization laws make explicit assump-
tions about the intentionality and negligence of those living with
infections, particularly if they fail to disclose their HIV status.
As a matter of fact, a number of men and women have been
prosecuted even after disclosing their infection and in the
absence of transmission, which serves to bolster claims about
HIV stigma in the justice system.1,3,50 Furthermore, past charac-
terizations of HIV-positive individuals as dangerous and violent
are not validated by data on offense classifications of inmates.
HIV-positive inmates are statistically less violent than their
counterparts and are more likely to be incarcerated for drug and
property crimes. Thus, HIV criminalization laws focused on
sexual violations deliberately codify unfounded beliefs about
who is at risk of exposure and the criminality of those who
would seek to expose them.
Although public health institutions have been largely silent
on HIV-specific criminal laws until very recently, a recent DoJ
report calls for states to re-examine their HIV-specific criminal
statutes and assess the laws in accordance with scientific under-
standings of transmission risk.1 However, evidence suggests
that this critical stance toward HIV criminalization is not shared
at all levels of the public health infrastructure. For example, one
study found that local health officials in Michigan had devel-
oped specific tools and strategies for catching HIV-positive
clients suspected of nondisclosure.50
HIV criminalization laws impute a host of assumptions
about the HIV-positive community and their sexual partners.51
These laws were created during an era of public fear and
scientific mystery about the evolution, progression, and trans-
mission of the disease. Such legislation was enacted on specu-
lation about the underlying risk of infection and the criminal
intent of individuals living with HIV. Over 30 years after the
discovery of this disease, HIV laws represent a relic of our
collective biases and misunderstandings that have since been
compounded by the rise of mass incarceration and its corre-
sponding distortion of national prevalence estimates. In the
interest of public health and scientific validity, social scientists
and legislators should reassess the evidence that purportedly
undergirds characterizations of HIV-positive persons as danger-
ous liaisons with cruel intentions.
