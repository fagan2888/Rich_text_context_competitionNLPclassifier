Abstract
Objective: To investigate the effect of a standardized silicone liner programme on the duration of
prosthetic rehabilitation in patients who underwent transtibial amputation as a result of peripheral
arterial disease.
Methods: This retrospective study enrolled patients who underwent transtibial amputation
followed by one of two stump management programmes at the same rehabilitation centre over a
period of 14 years. The study compared the duration of rehabilitation following a standardized
silicone liner programme compared with that following a conventional soft dressing programme.
Results: This study included 16 patients who underwent the silicone liner programme and 11
patients who underwent the soft dressing programme. There were no significant differences
between the two groups in age, sex, interval between amputation and admission to the
rehabilitation centre and stump length. The duration required for the completion of the
rehabilitation programme was significantly shorter for the silicone liner programme compared with
the soft dressing programme (mean Æ SD: 77.3 days Æ 13.4 versus 125.4 days Æ 66.4 days,
respectively).
Conclusion: A standardized silicone liner programme reduced the duration of rehabilitation and
could be a valuable replacement for soft dressing-based stump management.

Introduction
Recent progress in endovascular treatment
and vascular surgery has reduced the
number of cases of peripheral arterial dis-
ease (PAD) that lead to major amputations,1
but according to the analysis of US
Medicare data from 2000 to 2008, of
approximately 3 million patients hospita-
lized with PAD, 186 338 underwent major
lower limb amputation during that time.1,2
The importance of preserving the knee joint
when selecting the amputation level became
widely known, with two thirds of the
patients requiring major amputation due to
PAD being amputated at the transtibial
level.1,3,4 Therefore, prosthetic rehabilita-
tion for vascular transtibial amputees is
very important. However, the rate of suc-
cessful prosthetic rehabilitation has not
improved over 40 years.5 Effective postam-
putation stump management and subse-
quent prosthetic rehabilitation strategies
remain to be established for transtibial
amputees.5,6
Rigid dressing management is generally
thought to be the desirable postoperative
management in terms of progress in the
maturation of the stump,7­9 and it appears
to enable earlier prosthesis fitting, thereby
reducing the rehabilitation period as com-
pared with soft dressing management.3,10­13
But the risk of soft tissue ischaemia makes it
difficult to apply rigid dressings for transti-
bial amputees caused by PAD.14 Soft dres-
sing management is one of the options for
postoperative stump management,10 but this
management method needs much more time
for wound healing,15,16 and uniform global
standard protocols for stump management
and rehabilitation have not been estab-
lished.14 Using removable rigid dressings
with silicone liners has been reported to be
effective for wound healing,6,15,16 and it
reduces the period of hospitalization for
prosthetic rehabilitation.15,17­20 Our institu-
tion introduced a standardized stump
management and prosthetic rehabilitation
programme using silicone liners in a time-
series framework after wound closure of
transtibial amputation in 2006.
This present study investigated the effect
of a standardized silicone liner programme
on the prosthetic rehabilitation period in
patients who had undergone transtibial
amputation caused by PAD by retrospect-
ively evaluating the outcomes compared
with those following an earlier soft dressing
management programme that was used
prior to the introduction of the standardized
silicone liner programme.
Patients and methods
Study population
This retrospective study analysed the data
from consecutive patients with PAD who
had undergone unilateral transtibial ampu-
tations at local community hospitals and
were then referred to the Department of
Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation,
Hyogo Rehabilitation Centre, Kobe, Japan
for prosthetic walking training between
January 2006 and December 2014. All
patients underwent a standardized stump
management programme using silicone
liners (silicone liner programme group).
The control group consisted of consecutive
patients with PAD who had undergone
unilateral transtibial amputation at local
community hospitals and were then referred
to the Department of Physical Medicine and
Rehabilitation for prosthetic rehabilitation
between January 2001 and December 2005,
which was before the standardized
stump management programme using sili-
cone liners was introduced at Hyogo
Rehabilitation Centre, Kobe, Japan.
Control patients had received soft dressing
management and trained on provisional
prostheses that were made for them (soft
dressing programme group). Data from all
patients with vascular transtibial amputa-
tion who were admitted to the Department
958 Journal of International Medical Research 44(4)
of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation
during both time periods were analysed in
this study.
Inclusion criteria for all study partici-
pants included: (i) ability to stand on their
nonamputated leg either unsupported or
supported by one hand on a desk at the
time of admission to the Department of
Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation; (ii)
no severe dysfunction of the nonamputated
leg or their upper extremities such as joint
contracture and paralysis. Patients were
excluded if they had any Steinberg factors
that might impede their prosthetic walking
ability.21 Exclusion criteria were as follows:
(i) history of silicone liner use; (ii) severe
mental deterioration; (iii) advanced neuro-
logical disorders; (iv) congestive heart fail-
ure; (v) advanced obstructive pulmonary
disease; (vi) advanced hip or knee flexion
contracture ( 30 ). Postoperative stump
management and rehabilitation before
admission to the Department of Physical
Medicine and Rehabilitation was not stan-
dardized across the local hospitals in either
study group. Stump wounds had already
healed fully when patients were referred to
the Department of Physical Medicine and
Rehabilitation.
Each patient was informed of the purpose
of this study, and verbal and written consent
was obtained. Patient anonymity was pre-
served. This study was approved by the
Institutional Review Board of Hyogo
Rehabilitation Centre (no. 1523) and it was
conducted in accordance with the protocol
and it followed the ethical and humane
principles of human research.
Stump management programme using
silicone liners (silicone liner programme)
The duration of the programme naturally
varied according to the unique circum-
stances of individual amputees, but the
standard programme was as described as
follows. After wound closure was confirmed,
compression treatment of the stump with a
silicone liner was initiated and continued
for 2 weeks (Figure 1). The choice of
silicone liner that was used, either an
ICEROSS DERMO (O
¨ ssur, Reykjavik,
Iceland; January 2006 to December 2010)
or a 6Y75 Skeo Skinguard (Ottobock,
Duderstadt, Germany; January 2011 to
December 2014), was based entirely on the
time period in which the patients were
admitted to the hospital. The silicone liner
fitting period began at 1 h/day and was
gradually increased by 2 h/day to eventually
reach 8 h/day. From the third week, a pro-
visional prosthesis was made, using cast
sockets and silicone liners, with training in
standing up between parallel bars beginning
on the same day (Figure 2). Training in
standing up and walking between parallel
bars for 2 weeks was followed by 2 weeks of
walking training using walking aids. During
that period, suitable silicone liner sizes were
selected and changed according to the con-
dition of the stump, when necessary. The
cast socket was also remade when necessary.
From the seventh week, a provisional pros-
thesis was made using thermoplastic sockets
with silicone liners fitted (Figure 3). The
programme was completed after another 2
weeks of intensive walking training, which
included applied action training such as
going up and down slopes and stairs, and
walking outside near to the rehabilitation
centre. Ideally, the total duration of the
programme was 8 weeks, but it was appro-
priately extended according to a patient's
ability to walk with their prosthesis.
A schematic representation of the silicone
liner programme is shown in Figure 4.
When determining the silicone liner size,
the circumference at a location 4 cm from
the stump end was measured according to
the manufacturer's instructions, and then a
liner that was one-size smaller than the
measured value was, in principle, chosen.
Before starting a pressure treatment, a liner
of the selected size was tried on by the
Chin and Toda 959
patient under the supervision of a physician
for 15 min to check the sense of constriction
at the stump and the state of the skin. If no
problems were found during the first check,
another trial fitting was done for 15 min to
confirm the same points. If no problems
were found after these two trials, a pressure
treatment was started from the following
day. The treatment was stopped immedi-
ately if something undesirable or abnormal
was found on the skin due to wearing the
liner. If the subject complained about a
strong sense of constriction at the stump,
successive liners each being one size larger
than the preceding one were tried until one
of the appropriate size that caused no sense
of constriction was found. Then, a liner of
the suitable size was adopted so as to avoid
constriction.
In this programme, no stump treatment
except the adoption of a compression
treatment using a silicone liner was used
during the rest of the day and night. After
starting the training with a provisional
prosthesis, the time span for wearing a
silicone liner was set at 8 h/day. The silicone
liner was fitted by the patient alone without
help from others.
Stump management programme using
soft dressings (soft dressing programme)
The soft dressing programme was used for
stump management prior to the introduc-
tion of silicone liner use in 2006 and it did
not include protocols for specific stump
management and rehabilitation based on a
time-series framework.14,16 Therefore, pro-
gramme content was established, such as the
timing of provisional prosthesis application
and gait training, as needed according to the
degree of stump maturity and the physical

conditions of amputees, by making good use
of the experience of physicians and therap-
ists. Specifically, stump treatment using
elastic bandages was introduced so that the
programme could be performed for the
largest possible number of hours per day.
The compression treatment using elastic
bandages was conducted by a physician or
clinical nurses. A provisional prosthesis
using a thermoplastic socket with an inner
socket using a suspension cuff was made
when stump maturity was achieved (judged
by physicians and prosthetists), and training
in standing up between parallel bars began.
Training in standing up and walking
between parallel bars was followed by
walking training using walking aids. The
soft dressing programme was completed
after applied action training such as going
up and down slopes and stairs, and walking
outside near to the rehabilitation centre.
The training procedure and the goal of the
prosthetic walking were the same as for the
silicone liner programme, but the duration
of each type of training was not fixed in the
same way as it was for the silicone liner
programme.

ning on the first day of soft dressing man-
agement and ending with the completion of
provisional prosthesis training. A retro-
spective comparison was conducted to
evaluate the effects of the silicone liner
programme on reducing the rehabilitation
period compared with the soft dressing
programme.
Statistical analyses
All statistical analyses were performed using
the SPSSÕ statistical package, version 20.0
(SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) for
WindowsÕ. Continuous variables (age, inter-
val between amputation and admission,
stump length and duration of training) were
compared with Student's t-test and categorical
variables (sex) with v2-test. A P-value< 0.05
was considered statistically significant.
Results
A total of 16 patients (13 males and three
females) underwent unilateral transtibial
amputations due to PAD and then
underwent the standardized silicone liner
programme. Their mean Æ SD age was
62.1 Æ 11.8 years. Eight patients were fitted
with an ICEROSS DERMO silicone liner
and eight patients were fitted with a 6Y75
Skeo Skinguard silicone liner. The control
group consisted of 11 patients (nine males
and two females) who had undergone uni-
lateral transtibial amputation due to PAD
that was followed by a soft dressing pro-
gramme for stump management. Their
mean Æ SD age was 56.3 Æ 12.6 years.
There were no statistically significant
differences in age, sex, interval between
amputation and admission to the rehabili-
tation centre and stump length (Table 1).
The mean Æ SD duration required for the
completion of the prosthetic training pro-
gramme was significantly shorter for the
silicone liner programme compared with the
soft dressing programme (77.3 days Æ 13.4
versus 125.4 days Æ 66.4 days, respectively;
P < 0.05). The type of silicone liner
(ICEROSS DERMO or 6Y75 Skeo
Skinguard) had no influence on the duration
taken to complete the training for the
silicone liner programme (mean Æ SD
76.3 Æ 12.3 days versus 78.3 Æ 15.2 days,
respectively). All patients in this study
completed their prosthetic training pro-
gramme without: (i) any interruptions from
major complications, such as the need for
wound debridement; and (ii) any internal
complications that needed to be treated at
another hospital during the rehabilitation
period.
Discussion
The results in this present study showed that
a standardized prosthetic rehabilitation pro-
gramme using silicone liners for vascular
transtibial amputees significantly reduced
the rehabilitation period compared with a
conventional soft dressing programme.
These results suggest that a silicone liner
programme may be a favourable method for

postoperative stump management and pros-
thetic rehabilitation for transtibial amputa-
tion caused by PAD.
Although using a rigid dressing is a
recommended method for both postoperative
stump management and the subsequent pros-
thetic rehabilitation,6,15,17­20 this method
greatly relies on the experience and expertise
of the physicians and skilled prosthetic team
responsible for the patient.14 Therefore, its
application in clinical practice can be diffi-
cult, particularly in a community hospital
setting. Soft dressing management is easier
and safer to apply for vascular transtibial
amputees, but it needs a longer time to
achieve wound healing, resulting in delayed
prosthetic fitting, and it might increase the
time taken for prosthetic rehabilitation.6,14
Various reports demonstrated the efficacy of
a removable rigid dressing using silicone
liners for achieving earlier stump healing
and a reduction of stump volume,6,16­20 and
for reducing the rehabilitation period,17­20
compared with soft dressing management. In
the present study, the mean duration of
prosthetic training required for the silicone
liner programme was 77.3 days, a significant
reduction of 48.1 days compared with the
soft dressing programme. The silicone liner
programme investigated in the present study
was applied to patients referred from other
institutions for a certain period after ampu-
tation, so there was no continuous process
from amputation through rehabilitation, a
point which differs from other reports.17­20
However, provided that the silicone liner
programme is implemented promptly after
wound closure, it appears that the required
period for rehabilitation can be shortened
compared with conventional soft dressing
stump management. The reliable effect of the
silicone liner on the facilitation of stump
maturation might be the factor that contrib-
uted to a shorter rehabilitation duration in
the silicone liner programme.17,18
Another problem associated with rigid
dressing management is it makes accessing
the wound much more difficult and thus
makes it harder for the medical staff to
detect any complications resulting from the
amputation, especially those caused by
PAD.14 Removable rigid dressings with sili-
cone liners makes wound inspection much
easier than rigid dressings with plaster casts,
and solves the problem of wound complica-
tions related to rigid dressings. In this
present study, none of the patients experi-
enced stump wound complications in either
study group. These present findings suggest
that the standardized silicone liner pro-
gramme can be safely used in patients with
transtibial amputations.

Conventional soft dressing stump man-
agement using elastic bandages has disad-
vantages, such as variations observed in the
progress of stump maturation, which
depends on the skill level of the medical
staff in charge.17,18 Furthermore, soft dres-
sing management lacks the protocols for
consistent stump management and rehabili-
tation based on a time-series frame-
work.14,16 A standardized silicone liner
programme presents clearly defined proto-
cols in this respect (Figure 4), which might
be regarded as one of the factors that
reduced the rehabilitation period. Even if
adequate dressing management is not avail-
able immediately after amputation surgery
in institutions that lack well-established
stump management and rehabilitation pro-
grammes, the standardized silicone liner
programme could sufficiently achieve the
facilitation of stump maturation as well as
effectively reduce the time needed for
rehabilitation, provided that this pro-
gramme is applied properly after wound
closure. This standardized silicone liner
programme may be feasible in a community
hospital setting that lacks a skilled pros-
thetic team. The numbers of elderly transti-
bial amputees due to PAD is expected to
increase considerably in the future.22
Therefore, the establishment of an
effective stump management protocol is
important for both improving patient out-
comes and managing the economics of
healthcare. Using the standardized silicone
liner programme might contribute towards
helping both of these issues by reducing
the time taken for patient prosthetic
rehabilitation.
This present study had several limita-
tions. First, the sample size was relatively
small, so verification by multicentre studies
recruiting larger sample sizes is required.
Secondly, it was not clear whether the
silicone liner programme could replace
rigid dressing management because there
were no past data available for a comparison
study. Thirdly, the study evaluated the
rehabilitation duration as a primary out-
come measure to show the efficiency of the
standardized silicone liner programme com-
pared with the soft dressing programme.
However, the patients in the soft dressing
programme group were admitted up to 14
years earlier than those in the silicone liner
programme group, which brings into ques-
tion the suitability of the soft dressing
programme group as a reliable comparator
group. However, the demographic and clin-
ical characteristics of the patients in both
groups were similar in terms of age, sex,
interval between amputation and admission
to the rehabilitation centre and stump
length. In addition, the stump wound in
every patient had already healed at the time
of starting either programme. Physical con-
ditions were also similar in terms of their
ability to stand on their nonamputated leg,
the presence of upper extremity function,
and the absence of comorbidities relating to
Steinberg factors. The goal of prosthetic
rehabilitation was also the same in both
groups. Furthermore, the funding models
for supply of prosthesis and prosthetic
rehabilitation have not changed (except for
the introduction of silicone liners) in Japan
over the period of this study. Taking all of
these factors into consideration, the patients
in the soft dressing programme group were
considered to be reliable comparators for
the silicone liner programme group.
In conclusion, the findings of the present
study showed that the application of a
standardized silicone liner programme
reduced the duration of rehabilitation in
patients who had undergone unilateral
transtibial amputation as a result of PAD.
This standardized silicone liner programme
could be applied after wound closure regard-
less of the stump management method
employed immediately after amputation
and it might also be feasible in a community
hospital setting that lacks a skilled pros-
thetic team.
