In adults, light to moderate alcohol consumption is associated with lower risks for heart disease, diabetes, and
mortality. This study examined whether light to moderate alcohol use is also associated with lower risk of incident
physical disability over two 5-year periods in 4,276 noninstitutionalized adults in the United States, aged 50 years
or older, by using data from 3 waves of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey Epidemiologic
Follow-up Study surveys from 1982 to 1992. Light/moderate drinking (<15 drinks per week and <5 per drinking
day or 4 per drinking day for women) was associated with reduced risk for incident disability or death over 5 years,
compared with abstention (adjusted odds ratio ¼ 0.77; P ¼ 0.008). Among survivors, light/moderate drinking was
associated with lower risk for incident disability, compared with abstention (adjusted odds ratio ¼ 0.75;
P ¼ 0.009). In stratified analyses, disability risk decreased with light/moderate drinking in a dose-dependent
fashion in men and women with good or better self-reported health but not in men or women with fair or worse
self-reported health. Alcohol consumption in moderation might reduce the risk of developing physical disability in
older adults in good health but not in those in poor health.

More than 1 in 5 adults, aged 75 years or older, has some
degree of physical disability, defined as difficulty carrying
out daily activities (1). The link between alcohol consump-
tion by older adults and the risk of becoming disabled is not
clear (2), but light to moderate alcohol use by older adults is
associated with lower mortality (3, 4), fewer cardiovascular
events (5, 6), and less dementia (7) and diabetes (8). Al-
though many studies suggest that, compared with absti-
nence, light to moderate alcohol use is associated with
less (9­16), and heavy drinking with more, disability (9,
17­20), some studies have found no alcohol­disability as-
sociation (2, 10, 21­23). However, most of these studies
have been either cross-sectional or limited to a single follow-
up period, and few adequately controlled for poorer out-
comes in those who quit drinking because of poor health
and for survival bias resulting from mortality associations
with alcohol consumption. Many studies were restricted to
single demographic groups; thus, some of the inconsistencies
between studies may reflect true differences in the alcohol­
disability association across demographic and health groups.
To address these gaps in the evidence base, we examined
the association between alcohol consumption and the devel-
opment of disability in a nationally representative, prospective
cohort of US adults aged 50 years or older, using data from
3 waves of the National Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey Epidemiologic Follow-up Study (NHEFS) surveys
(1982­1984, 1987, and 1992).

National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (1971­
1975) of a multistage, stratified, probability sample, repre-
sentative of the US civilian, noninstitutionalized population,
aged 1­74 years, with oversampling of people aged 65 years
or older, those living in poverty, and women of childbearing
age (24). NHEFS surveys collected self-reported informa-
tion on alcohol use and physical functioning from face-to-
face interviews in 1982­1984 and telephone interviews in
later surveys. We examined the alcohol consumption level
in 1982­1984 as a predictor of incident disability between
1982­1984 and 1987 (first period) and the alcohol consump-
tion level in 1987 as a predictor of incident disability be-
tween 1987 and 1992 (second period).
Study sample
Of the 12,200 persons surveyed at the NHEFS 1982­1984
survey, 6,588 were 50 years or older at the time, and phys-
ical disability data were collected for 6,577 (99.8%). Only
3,871 of these individuals were free of disability and thus at
risk for incident disability; 3,564 (92.1%) persons with com-
plete alcohol and follow-up (year 1987) disability (or death)
data contributed to the first period analyses (Figure 1). Of
this group, 2,719 remained at risk for incident disability in
the second period (i.e., they had not died or become disabled
by the end of the first period) (Figure 1); 2,571 of them
(94.6%) with follow-up disability (or death) data (in 1992)

contributed to disability analyses in both the first and second
periods.
By the time of the NHEFS 1987 survey, an additional
1,286 participants had become 50 years of age or older,
and physical disability data in 1987 were collected in
1,261 (98.1%). Only 989 of these individuals were free of
disability and at risk for incident disability; 712 (72%) with
complete alcohol and follow-up disability (or death) data (in
1992) were included in the second period analyses (Figure 2).
Thus, our sample size was 4,276 with 3,564 in the first
period analysis, 3,283 in the second period analysis, and
2,571 in the analyses for both periods.
Alcohol variables
Study participants answered similar questions about
quantity and frequency of alcohol use in each of the survey
waves. We defined abstinence as consuming fewer than 12
drinks in the previous year, based on the definition used in
the National Health Interview surveys (28). We wanted to
use a clinically easy-to-use definition of light to moderate
drinking and based our drinking categories on those sug-
gested by the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and
Alcoholism (28). Accordingly, we calculated the number
of drinks consumed per week (by multiplying the reported
usual number of days per week that alcohol was consumed
with the reported usual number of drinks per drinking day)
to classify drinkers in 2 groups: Those who drank less than
15 drinks per week and less than 5 drinks per drinking day
(4 per day for women) were classified as light to moderate
drinkers, and those who drank 15 or more drinks per week
or 5 or more drinks per drinking day (4 or more per day for
women) were classified as heavy drinkers (29). Alcohol data
in 1987 were missing and had to be imputed (by carrying
forward 1982­1984 data) in 770 persons (23.8% of those
contributing to period 2 analyses). We felt that such an
imputation was justified because alcohol consumption pat-
terns were fairly stable: In the 2,088 persons with alcohol
data in both periods, 83% were in the same drinking group
(abstainer, light to moderate drinker, heavy drinker) in the 2
periods. Because this imputation could have led to bias in
our findings, we conducted a sensitivity analysis in which
we reran the model after excluding these persons.
In the NHEFS 1982­1984 survey, alcohol consumption in
previous years was ascertained. Using these data, we created
a former drinker indicator variable to identify those who
drank in the past (12 or more drinks in a prior year) but
were currently abstinent, because older adults who discon-
tinue drinking often do so because of a health condition (30)
and are at increased risk for poor outcomes (31). The former
drinker variable was created for both 1982­1984 and 1987.
Physical disability variables
Questions measuring physical disability were asked at
each of the surveys by using the Stanford Health Assess-
ment Questionnaire Disability Index (32). The index queries
specific tasks representing 8 domains (dressing and groom-
ing, personal hygiene, arising, eating, walking, gripping,
reaching, and doing common daily errands and chores) with
the following question structure: ``Please tell me if you have
no difficulty (0), some difficulty (1), much difficulty (2), or
are unable to do these activities at all (3) when you are by
yourself and without the use of aids.'' We used 19 questions

that were common to all survey periods (33) and created
a binary global disability indicator: Indicator ¼ 0 if all 19
responses were 0 (no difficulty), and indicator ¼ 1 if the
response on one or more of the items was 1 (some difficulty)
or higher.
On the basis of our study inclusion criteria, everyone in
the sample had disability indicator ¼ 0 at baseline (the
1982­1984 survey for period 1 and the 1987 survey for
period 2). Participants were defined as having incident dis-
ability over a period if their global disability indicator at the
end of the period was 1.
In exploratory analyses, we also examined disability as
a count of the number of functional domains (range, 0­8) in
which the response was 1 (some difficulty) or higher, with
the count at 1987 as the outcome for the first period and the
count at 1992 as the outcome for the second period. By
definition, everyone in the analytical sample had a disability
count of zero at the start of the period.
Statistical analyses
The generalized estimating equations (GEE) method
(34) was used to model the log odds of incident disability
over a follow-up period as a function of alcohol consump-
tion (3 categories: abstainer, light to moderate drinker, and
heavy drinker) at the start of the period (1982­1984 alco-
hol assessment for period 1 and 1987 alcohol assessment
for period 2), length of the follow-up period (since actual
length of follow-up varied from period 1 to period 2 and
from participant to participant), an indicator for period 1
versus period 2 (to model a period effect: a secular change
in disability incidence from one time period to the next),
and history of former drinking and other relevant covari-
ates measured at the start of the period (NHEFS 1982­
1984 survey for period 1 and NHEFS 1987 survey for
period 2). We used an exchangeable correlation structure
with GEE to account for correlation between repeated ob-
servations in the same individual (i.e., correlation between
observations from periods 1 and 2 in participants who
contribute to the analyses for both periods). All analyses
were weighted by NHEFS sampling weights to make the
results representative of the US civilian, noninstitutional-
ized population aged 50 years or older. The SAS procedure
GENMOD (35) was used to implement GEE with empir-
ically calculated standard errors by use of the Huber-White
sandwich correction (36).
Selection of covariates for inclusion in the model was
based on known associations with impairment of physical
function and amount of alcohol consumption. The covari-
ates in the model were as follows: 1) age (a linear term and
a squared term); 2) gender; 3) race (white vs. other than
white); 4) education (less than high school education vs. at
least a high school education); 5) employment status (work-
ing vs. other); 6) annual income (less than the median $7,000
vs. at least $7,000); 7) marital status (married vs. other than
married); 8) current smoking status (smoker vs. nonsmoker);
9) number of medical conditions (0, 1, 2, or 3 or more)
reported by the subject (from a list of 13 conditions queried:
high blood pressure, cancer, diabetes, stroke, heart failure/
heart attack, hip fracture, arthritis, asthma/emphysema, liver

cident myocardial infarction and stroke; 11) participation in
regular exercise (yes/no); and 12) self-rated health (dichot-
omized as excellent, very good, or good vs. fair or poor).
To reduce residual confounding by covariate­covariate
interactions, we also included preselected interaction terms
in the GEE model, specifically, interactions between 1) age
and gender, 2) marital status and gender, and 3) age and
race. To test for effect modification by major demographic
and health variables, we added alcohol interactions with
gender and self-reported health one at a time to the model
and conducted stratified analyses if significant alcohol in-
teractions were found.
In sensitivity analyses, we reran the models after exclud-
ing the individuals with imputed alcohol variables in the
second period and conducted analyses by using the disabil-
ity count (range, 0­8) as outcome and Poisson regression
with GEE for the purpose.
RESULTS
The mean age in the study sample was 60.4 years (range,
50­74 years), and the sample was 50% female and 92%
white. Comparing the study sample (n ¼ 4,276) with the
rest of the cohort who met the age criterion and were not
disabled at baseline but were excluded because of missing
data (n ¼ 584), we found that those in the study sample
were slightly younger; more likely to be white, more edu-
cated, married, and working; and more likely to have higher
income, to participate in regular exercise, and to report good
health (Table 1).
Further, 42% of the sample (32% of men, 51% of women)
abstained from drinking at baseline, 48% of the sample
(51% of men, 45% of women) were light to moderate
drinkers, 10% of the sample (17% of men, 4% of women)
were heavy drinkers, and 8% were former drinkers.
In addition, 22% percent of the sample either died (7%) or
became disabled (15%) over 5 years: The risk was similar in
men and women (P ¼ 0.8) but substantially higher in those
with poor or fair self-reported health (42%) compared with
those with excellent, very good, or good self-reported health
(19%) (P < 0.001). Among those who survived 5 years,
16% developed disability; again, the risk was higher in those
with poor or fair self-reported health (31%) than in those
with excellent, very good, or good self-reported health
(14%) (P < 0.0001) and also higher in women than in
men (18% vs. 14%; P ¼ 0.0002). Comparing the first with
the second period, we found that risks were slightly higher
in the second period when participants were a few years

older (20% dead or disabled in the first period vs. 24% in the
second; among survivors, 14% were disabled in the first
period vs. 18% in the second).
In unadjusted analyses, the risk of incident disability or
death was lowest in light/moderate drinkers (17.7% com-
pared with 26.7% in abstainers and 21.4% in heavy drinkers;
P < 0.0001). Because mortality risk was also lowest in
light/moderate drinkers (6.0% vs. 8.4% in abstainers and
6.9% in heavy drinkers), it is possible that alcohol's associ-
ation with the incident disability-or-death outcome is a re-
flection of the alcohol­mortality association. To address this
possibility, we excluded those who died and examined the
risk of incident disability by alcohol consumption level
among the survivors. In unadjusted analyses, the risk of in-
cident disability among survivors was also lowest in light-
to-moderate drinkers (12.5% compared with 20.0% in
abstainers and 15.6% in heavy drinkers) (Figure 3).
This association of light/moderate drinking with reduced
disability risk persisted after controlling for potential con-
founders. Compared with abstainers, light to moderate
drinkers had 23% lower adjusted odds for incident disability
or death and, among survivors, 25% lower adjusted odds for
incident disability (Table 2). Heavy drinkers and former
drinkers had risks similar to those of abstainers in both
analyses. In sensitivity analyses, after exclusion of the 770
individuals whose alcohol variables in 1987 had been im-
puted from 1982­1984 alcohol data, the associations did not
substantially change (data not shown).

In tests of effect modification, light/moderate drinking
had a smaller protective effect in men compared with
women (Pinteraction
¼ 0.06 for death or disability outcome
and Pinteraction
¼ 0.05 for disability outcome in survivors)
and a larger protective effect in those with good, very good,
or excellent self-reported health compared with those with
poor or fair self-reported health (Pinteraction
¼ 0.01 for death
or disability outcome and Pinteraction
¼ 0.02 for disability
outcome in survivors). On the basis of these results, we reran
the models separately in 4 strata defined by gender and self-
reported health. To allow for the possibility that benefit or
harm may accrue at different levels of consumption in the 4
strata, we divided the light/moderate drinking category into
2 subcategories: light drinking, defined as consuming 7 or
fewer drinks per week; and moderate drinking, defined as
consuming more than 7 but fewer than 15 drinks per week.
The association between light/moderate drinking and re-
duced disability risk was seen only in women in good or
better health, and there was a suggestion that there might be
a dose response in both men and women with good or better
health (Table 3).
To test for a dose response, we reran the stratified models
with number of drinks per week as a continuous predictor,
after excluding the heavy drinkers. Each additional drink
per week was associated with 3% lower odds of disability
in men in good or better health, 7%­8% lower odds in
women in good or better health, and a statistically non-
significant 5%­10% greater odds in those in fair or worse
health (Table 3). We next added a quadratic term (square of
the number of drinks per week) to the models to test for
nonlinearity in the dose response. The squared term did not
make significant contributions to the associations, except in
women in good or better health, where it made a significant,
positive contribution (P ¼ 0.047) to the model for incident
disability or death, implying that the benefit in healthy
women peaks at around 9 drinks per week (Figure 4). To
examine the nature of the dose effect in heavy drinkers, we
reran the stratified models in heavy drinkers, once with num-
ber of drinks per week as continuous predictor and once with
number of drinks per drinking day as predictor. Among those
in fair or worse health, only 13 women and 63 men were
heavy drinkers; hence, these analyses were conducted only
in those in good or better health (144 women and 394 men).
In both sexes, neither number of drinks per week nor number
of drinks per drinking day had a significant association with
incident disability risk (P > 0.35 for all).
In exploratory analyses (in survivors), we reran the strat-
ified models using the follow-up disability count score
(range, 0­8) as outcome and Poisson regression (with GEE
to account for correlation of data between period 1 and period
2). Results were similar to the results from the main models.
Light to moderate drinking was beneficial only in men and
women in good or better health. Among the women in good
or better health, compared with abstainers, the follow-up
disability count score was 40% (95% confidence interval
(CI): 24, 57) lower in light drinkers and 76% (95% CI: 51,
88) lower in moderate drinkers. Among those who were
not heavy drinkers, each additional drink per week was asso-
ciated with 11% (95% CI: 5, 17) lower disability scores in
women in good or better health and 4% (95% CI: 0, 8) lower
disability scores in men in good or better health. There were
no quadratic dose effects in either group.
DISCUSSION
In a population-based sample of nondisabled Americans
aged 50 years or older, we observed that light and moderate
drinkers were less likely to become disabled than abstainers.
However, the benefits from light/moderate drinking were
seen only in men and women in good, very good, or excel-
lent self-reported health. In these individuals, there was
a dose response, where disability risk reduction was larger
at higher levels of drinking, up to 9 drinks per week in
women and 15 drinks per week in men. Although a causal
relation between alcohol consumption and disability pre-
vention cannot be directly inferred from an observational
study, the suggestion of a dose response strengthens the
evidence for a causal relation. One potential causal pathway
might be through reduction in cardiovascular events (37,
38). Stroke is the chronic condition that has the largest
impact on disability-free survival in old age (39); because
moderate alcohol use is known to protect against cerebro-
vascular disease (6), it is possible that some of the disability
risk prevention from light/moderate alcohol consumption
comes from preventing strokes. However, adjustment for
stroke in our analyses did not alter our findings, suggesting
residual confounding by severity of stroke (which we could
not adjust for) and/or subclinical cardiovascular disease.
The associations between light/moderate drinking and re-
duced disability risk were stronger in women than in men.
There are several possible reasons for this finding, including
gender differences in binge drinking (40) and the pace of
alcohol consumption (41). Moreover, alcohol consumption
declines (with aging) faster in men than in women (42); this

could have led to more confounding by the ill effects of past
heavy drinking in men than in women.
Light to moderate alcohol consumption appears to have
disability prevention benefits only in men and women in
relatively good health. It is possible that those who report
poor health have progressed too far on the pathway to dis-
ability to accrue benefits from alcohol consumption and that
alcohol consumption may even be deleterious for them. We
found that even light/moderate consumption may be asso-
ciated with increased disability risk in those in poor or fair
self-reported health. Alcohol's interactions with medica-
tions may be responsible for increased disability risk in
these individuals (43). Further studies are needed to exam-
ine if people with certain specific health conditions or on
specific medications are more prone to disability from alco-
hol consumption.
Unlike other studies (31), this study did not find increased
risk for incident disability in former drinkers compared with
lifelong abstainers. People who quit drinking often do so for
health-related concerns (30). The increased risks in these
individuals might be secondary to their underlying health
conditions. In our study, we controlled for health conditions
by including a count of medical conditions and indicators of
stroke, heart attack, and self-reported health. With these
controls, former drinkers were not at increased risk for in-
cident disability.
Our study had some limitations. Like other epidemiologic
studies of the effects of alcohol consumption on health out-
comes, this study also relied on participants' reports of cur-
rent and past consumption levels. However, a tendency in
abstainers and very light drinkers to overreport and in heavy
drinkers to underreport their consumption would only have
reduced the strength of the estimated association between
light/moderate drinking and incident disability risk. Disabil-
ity status was also obtained from self-report, but the validity
of self-reported disability data has been well established
(44, 45). Levels of both alcohol consumption and disability
were evaluated at discrete time points in our study; thus, we
did not capture historical information about levels of drink-
ing and did not distinguish between transient and permanent
forms of disability. Like those in other prospective cohort
studies, the participants in this study are likely to be health-
ier and from higher socioeconomic strata than the general
population. The use of NHEFS sampling weights in our
analyses at least partially compensates for such differences
in sampling probability and makes our findings representa-
tive of the general population.
In conclusion, this large, nationally representative,
prospective cohort study of alcohol consumption as a pre-
dictor of incident disability found that light/moderate
drinking is associated with 33%­65% reduction overall
(and 3%­8% reduction with each additional drink per week)
in the odds of incident disability in men and women in good
self-reported health, as well as possibly increased odds of
incident disability in men and women in poor self-reported
health. Further research is needed to discover the biologic
underpinnings of this association, to understand why
alcohol's benefits are seen only in those in good health,
and to determine whether and how definitions of harmful
drinking have to be tailored to an individual's overall health,
specific comorbidities and medications used, and social
circumstances.
