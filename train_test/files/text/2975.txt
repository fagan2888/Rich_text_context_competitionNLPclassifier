Smoking and Panic Attacks
An Epidemiologic Investigation
Naomi Breslau, PhD; Donald F. Klein, MD
Background: Epidemiologic studies have reported a life-
time association between smoking and panic disorder.
In this study, we examine potential explanations for this
association.
Methods: Analysis was conducted on data from 2 epi-
demiologic studies, the Epidemiologic Study of Young
Adults in southeast Michigan (N = 1007) and the Na-
tional Comorbidity Survey Tobacco Supplement
(n = 4411). Cox proportional hazards models with time-
dependent covariates were used to estimate the risk for
onset of panic attacks associated with prior smoking and
vice versa, controlling for history of major depression.
The role of lung disease in the smoking­panic attacks as-
sociation was explored.
Results: Daily smoking signaled an increased risk for
first occurrence of panic attack and disorder; the risk was
higher in active than past smokers. No significant risk
was detected for onset of daily smoking in persons with
prior panic attacks or disorder. Exploratory analyses sug-
gest that lung disease might be one of the mechanisms
linking smoking to panic attacks.
Conclusions: The evidence that the association
between smoking and panic disorder might result pri-
marily from an influence in one direction (ie, from
prior smoking to first panic attack) and the possibility
of a higher risk in active than past smokers suggest a
causal hypothesis for the smoking­panic attacks rela-
tionship.

EPIDEMIOLOGIC studies have
reported positive associa-
tions between smoking and
psychiatric disorders,1-4 con-
firmingpreviousreportsthat
the rate of smoking is higher in patients
with psychiatric disorders, including de-
pressive and anxiety disorders.5 The rela-
tionship between smoking and major de-
pression has been the focus of considerable
research.6-13 In contrast, little is known
about the relationship of smoking with
panic disorder, beyond the observation of
positive associations. Clinical studies sug-
gest that in patients with panic disorder
smoking preceded the onset of panic dis-
order.14,15
We examine the lifetime association
between daily smoking and panic attacks
in 2 community-based data sets, the Epi-
demiologic Study of Young Adults in
southeast Michigan1,2 and the National Co-
morbidity Survey (NCS) Tobacco Supple-
ment,16 and examine potential explana-
tions for the observed association.
A lifetime association between daily
smoking and panic attacks might reflect
causal and noncausal mechanisms. Daily
smoking might cause panic attacks; con-
versely, panic attacks might increase the
risk for daily smoking. Alternatively, the
association might be noncausal: smoking
and panic attacks might be linked by
shared etiologies. Although observa-
tional studies cannot definitively test causal
hypotheses, they can dampen the plausi-
bility of some hypotheses and suggest the
plausibility of others. Evidence that daily
smoking is associated with an increased
risk for first panic attack but no in-
creased risk in the reverse direction (ie,
from panic attacks to onset of daily smok-
ing) would dampen the plausibility that
panic increases the risk for smoking. It
would suggest the hypothesis that daily
smoking causes panic attacks, although the
plausibility of shared causes could not be
ruled out. Furthermore, evidence of a
greater risk for panic attacks in active
smokers than in those who have quit
would dampen the plausibility of the
shared causes explanation. In contrast, evi-
dence of influences in both directions and
evidence of an equally increased risk for
panic attacks in smokers who quit and
those who continued to smoke would sug-
gest the hypothesis that the observed as-
sociation reflects common causes.

We address 3 questions: (1) Does daily smoking sig-
nal an increased risk for first-time occurrence of a panic
attack? (2) Is the risk for first panic attack greater in per-
sons who continue to smoke than in those who have quit?
(3) Does a history of panic attacks signal an increased
risk for daily smoking? To each data set, we apply the
same statistical methods that take advantage of informa-
tion on the timing of onset of daily smoking and first oc-
currence of panic attack. Results are presented on DSM-
III-R panic attacks and panic disorder. Previous reports
suggest an association between pulmonary dysfunction
and panic disorder.17-22 In view of this evidence and the
established causal role of smoking in lung disease, we ex-
plore the potential mediating role of lung disease in the
smoking­panic attack relationship.
RESULTS
THE EPIDEMIOLOGIC STUDY
OF YOUNG ADULTS
Table 1 presents the lifetime prevalence of the major
variables in the analysis and the lifetime prevalence of
panic attacks in subsets stratified according to the cross-
classification of daily smoking and major depression. The
lifetime association between panic attacks and daily smok-
ing was similar in men and women; odds ratios (ORs)
were 3.13 (95% CI, 1.30-7.50) and 2.61 (95% CI, 1.66-
4.09), respectively.
Estimated in a Cox proportional hazards model with
daily smoking as a time-dependent covariate and adjust-
ing for sex and major depression, the HR of panic attack
associatedwithpriordailysmokingwas3.96(95%CI,2.28-
6.89). This estimate compares daily smokers with no his-
tory of major depression with persons who neither smoked
daily nor experienced major depression. The HR of panic
attacks associated with prior major depression alone was
12.98(95%CI,6.70-25.18),andwithmajordepressionplus
daily smoking, 12.77 (95% CI, 6.73-24.26). In another
model, history of major depression plus daily smoking was
codedas2covariatesaccordingtotheirtemporalorder:first
major depression and then daily smoking and vice versa.
The results suggest an added effect of subsequent daily
smokinginpersonswithpreexistingmajordepressioncom-
paredwithpersonswithmajordepressionalone(HR,16.28;
95% CI, 7.35-36.05). This was not the case if daily smok-
ingprecededtheonsetofmajordepression(HR,10.64;95%
CI, 4.93-22.98).
SUBJECTS, MATERIALS,
AND METHODS
SAMPLES AND DATA
Epidemiologic Study of Young Adults
A sample of 1200 persons was randomly selected from all
21- to 30-year-old members of a large health maintenance
organization in southeast Michigan. Personal interviews
were conducted in 1989 with 1007 subjects (84%) and fol-
low-up interviews were conducted in 1990, 1992, and 1994.
Completefollow-updataareavailablefor974persons(97%).
At baseline the sample was 62% female, 80% white, 45%
married, and 29% college educated. Detailed information
on the sample has been previously reported.1,2
The National Institute of Mental Health Diagnostic In-
terview Schedule,23 revised according to the DSM-III-R, was
used. Panic attack is defined in the DSM-III-R as an attack in
which at least 4 of the following 13 symptoms are experi-
enced: shortness of breath, dizziness, palpitation, trem-
bling, sweating, choking, nausea, depersonalization, numb-
ness, flushes or chills, chest pain, fear of dying, and fear of
going crazy. Panic disorder is defined as the occurrence of ei-
ther 4 attacks within a 4-week period or 1 or more attacks
followed by a period of at least 1 month of persistent fear of
havinganotherattack.TheDiagnosticInterviewScheduleelic-
its information on the age at which the first DSM-III-R panic
attack occurred. Age at first panic attack is also used to de-
fine age of onset of panic disorder in the subset meeting the
DSM-III-R criteria for the disorder. The onset of daily smok-
ing is defined as the age at which the respondent first smoked
dailyfor1monthorlonger.Lifetimehistoryofpanicattacks,
psychiatric disorders, and smoking was measured at base-
line,andintervalhistory,coveringtheperiodsincethelastas-
sessment,wasgatheredateachfollow-upinterview.Datafrom
baselineandfollow-upinterviewswerecombined,providing
lifetime data up to age 35 years, the upper age limit of the re-
spondents at the last interview.
NCS Tobacco Supplement
The NCS is based on a stratified, multistage area probabil-
ity sample of persons aged 15 to 54 years in the United
States.16 The diagnostic interview was a modified version
of the Composite International Diagnostic Interview, which
also yields DSM-III-R diagnoses.24 The Composite Interna-
tional Diagnostic Interview is modeled on the National In-
stitute of Mental Health Diagnostic Interview Schedule. The
Tobacco Supplement was administered in the second half
of the survey. Data are available on 4411 respondents of
the total NCS sample of 8098. Because the NCS fieldwork
was conducted in replicate samples, the subset with data
from the Tobacco Supplement is also representative of the
US population.16
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Cox proportional hazards models for censored survival data,
with daily smoking as a time-dependent covariate,25-27 were
used to calculate the hazard ratio (HR) of first occurrence
of panic attack associated with prior daily smoking (re-
search question 1). The HR estimates the risk for first panic
attack in persons who smoked daily compared with per-
sons who had not. Time was defined as chronological age.
Persons who had not experienced a panic attack by the time
of the last interview were censored.
The advantage of the Cox proportional hazards model,
compared with logistic regression, is that it permits taking
into account differences across individuals in the period
of risk for the outcome. The added advantage of models
with time-dependent covariates is that they allow consid-
eration of independent variables that vary over time. The
parameter estimate () in the Cox proportional hazards

Cox proportional hazards models with time-
dependent covariates were used to estimate the HRs of
the first occurrence of panic attacks in daily smokers who
continued to smoke and in smokers who quit. Com-
pared with persons who neither smoked daily nor expe-
rienced major depression, the HR of first panic attack in
smokers who continued to smoke was 4.71 (95% CI, 2.70-
8.21), but in smokers who quit it was 0.21 (95% CI, 0.05-
0.88). The contrast between continued and discontin-
ued smoking was statistically significant (P = .002).
Onset of Daily Smoking After Panic Attacks
The sex-adjusted HR of daily smoking associated with
prior panic attacks was 2.13 (95% CI,1.24-3.67). How-
ever, adjusting additionally for major depression oblit-
erated any evidence of an increased risk of daily smok-
ing associated with panic attacks (HR, 1.00; 95% CI,
0.40-2.48).
Panic Disorder
Of the 121 persons who experienced panic attacks, 52
met the criteria for DSM-III-R panic disorder (Table
1). The sex-adjusted OR that estimates the lifetime
association between daily smoking and panic disorder
was 4.24 (95% CI, 2.23-8.06). Calculated in a Cox
proportional hazards model with time-dependent
covariates, the sex-adjusted HR of onset of panic dis-
order (ie, first panic attack in persons meeting criteria
for panic disorder) in daily smokers compared with
nondaily smokers was 4.73 (95% CI, 2.36-9.49).
When history of major depression was controlled, the
HR of panic disorder in daily smokers was 13.13 (95%
CI, 4.41-39.10) compared with persons who neither
smoked daily nor experienced major depression. The
HR of panic disorder in daily smokers who continued
to smoke was 14.46 (95% CI, 4.81-43.50), but in
smokers who quit, 0.51 (95% CI, 0.12-2.28), using
persons who neither smoked daily nor experienced
major depression as a reference. The contrast because
of quitting was significant (P = .001).
Looking at the relationship in the reverse direction
(ie, from prior panic disorder to onset of daily smok-
ing), the sex-adjusted HR was 2.20 (95% CI, 1.10-4.42).
However, controlling also for prior major depression, the
HR of daily smoking after the onset of panic disorder fell
to 0.82 (95% CI, 0.20-3.39).
model is a regression coefficient from which the HR can
be obtained by taking the antilogarithm of the parameter
estimate. Hazard ratios with 95% confidence intervals (CIs)
that do not include the null value of 1 are significant at
.05 (2 tailed).
We controlled for the potential influence of major de-
pression, which is associated with both panic attacks (or dis-
order) and smoking. Three time-dependent covariates were
used, representing the 4 strata of the independent variable:
dailysmokingalone,majordepressionalone,anddailysmok-
ing plus major depression, with neither daily smoking nor
major depression as the reference. This model yields an es-
timate of the HR for panic attacks in daily smokers who have
never experienced major depression, compared with per-
sons who have neither smoked daily nor experienced major
depression. We used the SAS procedure for proportional haz-
ards regression, with the logit link to address the interval-
censored data.28 The proportionality assumption was tested
for each model, using graphic techniques.29
The proportional hazards model with the 3 time-
dependent covariates is as follows:
hi
(t) = ezi
(t) + yi
(t) + xi
(t)h0
(t)
where zi
(t) is 1 if the respondent smoked daily (but had
no history of major depression) before time t and 0 if not;
yi
(t) is 1 if the respondent experienced major depression
(but not daily smoking) before time t and 0 if not; xi
(t) is 1
if the respondent experienced major depression plus daily
smoking before time t and 0 if not; and , , and  are the
coefficients of risk for panic attacks associated with daily
smoking alone, major depression alone, and daily smok-
ing plus major depression, respectively.
To estimate the HR for panic attacks associated with
continued as opposed to discontinued smoking (research
question 2), daily smoking was defined as a time-
dependent covariate that can change twice: first from non-
daily smoking to daily smoking, and then from daily
smoking to quitting. It yields an estimate of the HR of panic
attack in daily smokers who continued to smoke and the
HR in those who quit, using nondaily smokers as a refer-
ence. History of major depression was controlled, as de-
scribed above. To estimate the HR of daily smoking asso-
ciated with prior panic attacks (research question 3), we
employed Cox proportional hazards models with time-
dependent covariates like those described above for re-
search question 1. Interactions between sex and indepen-
dent variables of interest were tested. No significant
interactions were detected at .15. Sex was included in
these models as a covariate.

THE NCS TOBACCO SUPPLEMENT
Unweighted and weighted prevalence estimates of the ma-
jor variables in the NCS appear in Table 1. The lifetime
association of panic attacks with daily smoking in men
was 1.64 (95% CI, 1.10-2.50) and in women, 1.69 (95%
CI, 1.26-2.25).
Applying the same Cox proportional hazards mod-
els with time-dependent covariates, the HR of first panic
attack in daily smokers was 2.02 (95% CI, 1.47-2.77),
adjusted for sex and major depression. The HR of first
panic attack in daily smokers who continued to smoke
was 2.07 (95% CI, 1.49-2.87) and in those who had quit,
1.85 (95% CI, 0.98-3.50), using persons who neither
smoked daily nor experienced major depression as a ref-
erence. The difference in the HRs was not significant
(P = .73). Analysis of the relationship in the reverse di-
rection showed that the HR of daily smoking associated
with prior panic attacks was 1.37 (95% CI, 0.99-1.88).
Of the 301 persons with a history of panic attacks,
149 met the criteria for panic disorder (Table 1). The sex-
adjusted OR measuring the lifetime association be-
tween daily smoking and panic disorder was 1.60 (95%
CI, 1.27-2.18). Calculated in a Cox proportional haz-
ards model with time-dependent covariates, the HR of
onset of panic disorder associated with prior daily smok-
ing was 2.93 (95% CI, 1.84-4.66), adjusted for sex and
major depression. In persistent smokers it was 3.18 (95%
CI, 1.99-5.10) and in smokers who had quit, 1.82 (95%
CI, 0.69-4.28). The difference between the estimates was
not significant (P = .24). The HR of daily smoking asso-
ciated with prior panic disorder was only 1.06 (95% CI,
0.54-2.08), controlling for sex and major depression.

ing are lower than corresponding estimates from the Epi-

ing to panic attacks. Also, the effect of smoking cessation
on diminishing the risk for panic attack or disorder is sug-
gestedbybothstudies,althoughthedifferencesbetweenac-
tive and past smoking were not significant in the NCS.
EXPLORATORY ANALYSIS OF THE POTENTIAL
ROLE OF LUNG DISEASE
The sex-adjusted ORs for panic attacks associated with
lung disease, alone and with daily smoking, were higher
than for daily smoking alone (Table 3). However, in both
data sets, daily smokers with no history of lung disease
had higher odds for panic attacks than the reference group
with neither daily smoking nor lung disease: sex-
adjusted OR of panic attacks in daily smokers with no
history of lung disease in the Epidemiologic Study of
Young Adults was 3.0 (95% CI, 1.76-5.28) and in the NCS,
1.9 (95% CI, 1.29-2.72).
Taking advantage of the prospective data in the Epi-
demiologic Study of Young Adults, we estimated the rela-
tive risk for first occurrence of panic attack during the
5-year follow-up interval according to smoking and lung
disease status at baseline (Table 4). The OR of first panic
attack associated with lung disease alone was 9.2 (95%
CI, 2.26-37.24) and for current daily smoking, 1.7 (95%
CI, 0.92-3.08). Although the OR for first panic attack
associated with daily smoking alone did not reach sig-
nificance (P = .09), the direction of the estimate and the

COMMENT
Parallel analyses of 2 epidemiologic data sets revealed
that daily smoking was associated with an increased
risk for first-time occurrence of panic attack; the risk
for first panic attack was higher in active than in past
smokers; there was no evidence that prior panic
attacks were associated with a significant increased
risk for daily smoking when co-occurring major
depression was taken into account; analysis of the sub-
set with panic disorder also supports an asymmetry in
the relationship, in that an increased risk was
observed from smoking to first onset of panic disorder
but not in the reverse direction; these relationships
held in both men and women, with no evidence of sex
interactions; and exploratory analysis suggests that
lung disease might be one of the mechanisms linking
smoking to panic attacks.
The prevalence estimates of DSM-III-R panic at-
tack and disorder were higher in the Epidemiologic Study
of Young Adults than in the NCS. This was caused pri-
marily by the longitudinal design of the Epidemiologic
Study of Young Adults--multiple follow-up assess-
ments added incidence cases that occurred during suc-
cessiveintervals.Atbaseline,theprevalenceestimateswere
similar to those in the NCS. Despite these and other dif-
ferences between the 2 studies, both lead to similar in-
ferences with respect to the relationship between daily
smoking and panic attacks or disorder.
In this study, we examined the relationship of daily
smoking with panic attack and panic disorder. While his-
tory of panic attack defines a heterogeneous category that
includesthosewithahistoryofasingleisolatedattack,panic
disorderdefinesamoredistinctclinicalphenomenon.Time
of onset of panic disorder was defined as first occurrence
of panic attack in persons meeting the DSM-III-R criteria
for the disorder. The age at which the full criteria were first
met is not ascertained in the Diagnostic Interview Sched-
ule or the Composite International Diagnostic Interview.
However, first panic attack might be the most reliably re-
called by persons with panic disorder.
The results suggest the possibility that the relation-
ship between smoking and panic attack or disorder might
flow primarily in one direction (ie, from smoking to sub-
sequent onset of panic attacks or disorder). Evidence sug-
gesting an influence in the reverse direction (ie, an in-
creased risk for daily smoking in persons with panic
attacks), was suggested in the NCS, but the risk was
smaller and not significant. Results from the Epidemio-
logic Study of Young Adults show increased risk for panic
attack and disorder in active smokers but not in past
smokers. Corresponding results from the NCS, al-
though consistent with this pattern, were less clear-cut.
The evidence that smoking cessation diminished the risk
for panic attacks and disorder should be interpreted with
caution.
Alternative hypotheses that link smoking to panic
attacks have been suggested.14 One potential mecha-
nism explored in this study is lung disease. The data on
this issue have important limitations, including reliance
on self-reports of lung disease and lack of information
on the time of onset of lung disease relative to first panic
attack. The results from both data sets show an in-
creased lifetime prevalence of panic attacks in smokers
who reported lung disease compared with smokers who
did not. Among nonsmokers, lung disease was associ-
ated with an increased risk of panic attacks, confirming
previous reports.20-22 By increasing the risk for lung dis-
ease, smoking might indirectly increase the risk for panic
attacks. However, the fact that only a small proportion
of smokers reported lung disease and the increased in-
cidence of panic attacks/disorder in smokers with no his-
tory of lung disease suggest the possibility of other path-
ways from smoking to panic.

Klein34,35 proposed that panic attacks represent a suf-
focation false alarm and that a subset of the general popu-
lation is predisposed to overreact to suffocation signals.
Cigarette smoking leads to chronic bronchitis and em-
physema as well as to subclinical respiratory impair-
ment. Smokers with pulmonary problems who are pre-
disposed to overreact to suffocation signals might manifest
panic attacks. Alternatively, carbon monoxide in ciga-
rette smoke might affect the suffocation alarm thresh-
old. It has been suggested36 that one asphyxiation moni-
tor for the suffocation alarm system may be the carotid
body, which is inhibited by carbon monoxide.37 Such a
direct effect would decrease the alarm reaction in smok-
ers; however, rebound receptor sensitization effects caused
by smoking pauses may also occur. Other causal mecha-
nisms in the smoking-panic relationship, including a role
for smoking and nicotine in anxiety, also should be con-
sidered.38-40
Experimental research that could provide defini-
tive evidence for ruling out noncausal explanations of
the association between smoking and panic and for
establishing the role of compromised lung function as
a mechanism is not feasible in humans. However, it
seems clear that longitudinal epidemiological investi-
gations can go beyond cross-sectional associations in
influencing the plausibility of competing hypotheses.
Clinical research in panic disorder has benefited from
experiments in which patients have been perturbed by
both psychological and physiological stimuli. Further
clarification might be gained if stimuli such as carbon
dioxide or intravenous sodium lactate were applied to
subjects with and without panic attacks, who also var-
ied with regard to smoking status. Also, longitudinal
studies with repeated administration of such stimuli in
subjects at high risk for progression to heavy smoking
could test if smoking induces panic by stimulating a
preexisting hypersensitive suffocation alarm system or
may actually induce such hypersensitivity.
A comment on the statistical analysis of the NCS
data is in order. Prevalence estimates and measures of
lifetime associations, the latter calculated in logistic
regression models, were based on weighted data to
adjust for the complex sampling design (Tables 1 and
3). To estimate the risk for first occurrence of panic
attack associated with prior daily smoking and to
address other questions that concern temporal rela-
tionships between variables, Cox proportional hazards
models with time-dependent covariates were applied
to unweighted data. To our knowledge, there is no
software for the analysis of weighted data in the Cox
proportional hazards model with time-dependent
covariates. The discrete-time logistic model, for which
software procedures for weighted data are available,
has been used to address similar questions.41,42 This
application of the discrete-time logistic model to inter-
val censored data, such as those produced by the Diag-
nostic Interview Schedule or the Composite Interna-
tional Diagnostic Interview (which date events by year
of occurrence), has been questioned recently by Hos-
mer and Lemeshow.43 We evaluated the effects of
weighting by applying the discrete-time logistic mod-
els to the unweighted and the weighted data. A com-
parison of the results with those that appear in Table 2
shows only a few differences. Specifically, the relative
risk estimate for panic disorder associated with prior
daily smoking was higher in the discrete-time logistic
model (OR, 3.9; 95% CI, 2.3-6.7, based on the weight-
ed data). The estimate of the relative risk for daily
smoking associated with prior panic attack in the
discrete-time logistic model was slightly higher and
significant (OR, 1.63; 95% CI, 1.02-2.61, based on the
weighted data). The discrepancies in both instances
occurred in the shift to the discrete-time logistic
model, whereas the use of weights had little added
effect. It is therefore unlikely that any bias in our esti-
mates from the Cox proportional hazards models cal-
culated on the unweighted data would be more than
minimal.
