OBJECTIVE -- A relationship between inflammation, measured by C-reactive protein (CRP),
and forced vital capacity (FVC) in diabetes or metabolic syndrome (MetS) has not been estab-
lished. We investigated whether high CRP is related to reduced FVC in MetS and diabetes.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS -- We examined the association of MetS/
diabetes and CRP (normal 3 mg/l, high 3 mg/l) with predicted FVC in 4,272 nonsmoking
U.S. adults aged 18­79 years without lung disease in the Third National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey. Logistic regression examined odds of FVC 80% by CRP and MetS/
diabetes.
RESULTS -- Mean FVC in individuals with MetS and high CRP (95.7%) and those with
diabetes and high CRP (93.7%) was lower than in those with no MetS/diabetes and normal CRP
(101.7%) (P  0.01) and was lower in those with MetS and high CRP (95.7%) than in those with
MetS and normal CRP (98.5%) (P  0.01). The odds ratio (95% CI) of FVC 80% was highest
in individuals with MetS and high CRP (odds ratio 4.26 [95% CI 2.08­8.73], P  0.01)
compared with those with no MetS/diabetes and normal CRP.
CONCLUSIONS -- Elevated CRP is associated with lower FVC in people with MetS.

Cross-sectional (1,2) and prospective
(3) studies have demonstrated im-
paired lung function in individuals
with diabetes and metabolic syndrome
(MetS). Recent studies show that reduced
lung function may be a precursor of dia-
betes (4). People with reduced lung func-
tion have greater levels of inflammation
(5), and people with diabetes or MetS
(6,7), including those with elevated C-re-
active protein (CRP) (8), are at increased
risk of cardiovascular disease. Although
the interplay among MetS, diabetes, and
insulin resistance has been thoroughly in-
vestigated and extensively published,
their role in systemic inflammation and
lung function impairment has not been
firmly established. We examined whether
increased levels of CRP may help identify
lung function impairment in individuals
with MetS/diabetes.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND
METHODS -- Using data from the
Third National Health and Nutrition Ex-
amination Survey (NHANES III), 1988­
1994 (9), we examined adults aged
18­79 years (n  4,272 projected to 43.2
million, 59.7% female) with available
forced vital capacity (FVC) data, who
were nonsmokers, absent of pulmonary
obstructions, and without known pulmo-
nary disease. Spirometric data were ob-
tained using a spirometry system
following the modified 1987 procedures
of the National Institute for Occupational
Safety and Health (NIOSH) and American
Thoracic Society (ATS). Predicted FVC
was calculated using equations developed
by Hankinson et al. (10). CRP was mea-
sured using a latex-enhanced nephelom-
etry technique, providing a lowest
detectable concentration of 2.1 mg/l. Ad-
ditional details of the NHANES method-
ology have been published (9).
MetS was defined by the presence of
at least three of the following: 1) waist
circumference 102 cm for men and
88 cm for women, 2) triglyceride level
150 mg/dl if fasting, 3) HDL cholesterol
level 40 mg/dl for men or 50 mg/dl
for women, 4) blood pressure 130/85
mmHg or on antihypertensive medica-
tions, and 5) fasting glucose level 100­
125 mg/dl (7.0 mmol/l) according
established criteria (11). Diabetes was de-
fined by a fasting glucose 126 mg/dl (or
200 mg/dl if nonfasting), taking oral di-
abetes medication or insulin, or self-
report. CRP cut points were defined as
normal (3 mg/l) or high (3 mg/l)
based on established recommendations
(12).
The 2 test of proportions or ANOVA
was used to compare baseline character-
istics among FVC groups. Multivariable
logistic regression was used to examine
the likelihood of decreased FVC (80%
of predicted) in those with MetS or diabe-
tes by CRP group compared with those
with neither of these conditions and low
CRP, adjusted for age, sex, and ethnicity.
SAS version 9.1.3 (SAS institute, Cary,
NC) and SUDAAN version 9.0.1 (Re-
search Triangle Institute, Research Trian-
gle Park, NC) were used for analysis and
computation of weighted estimates for
projection to the U.S. population.
RESULTS -- Individuals in FVC quar-
tile 1 (lowest FVC) exhibited the highest
CRP levels (P  0.01). Additionally, indi-
viduals in FVC quartile 1 had higher trig-
lycerides, glucose, systolic blood
pressure, and HDL cholesterol than those
in FVC quartile 4 (highest FVC) (P 
0.05). Prevalence of MetS was highest
among individuals in FVC quartile 1

(24.7%) compared with those in FVC
quartile 4 (11.5%) (P  0.01). There were
no significant differences in waist cir-
cumference, BMI, and sex across quar-
tiles of FVC.
Predicted mean FVC values, ad-
justed for age, sex, and ethnicity, were
significantly lower in those with high
versus normal CRP levels among indi-
viduals with MetS (P  0.01). FVC in
those with MetS and high CRP (95.7%)
was notably lower than in those with
MetS and normal CRP (98.5%) (P 
0.01) and those with no MetS/diabetes
and normal CRP (101.7%) (P  0.01).
Individuals with diabetes and high CRP
had the lowest FVC (93.7%), signifi-
cantly lower compared with those with
no MetS/diabetes and normal CRP
(101.7%) (P  0.01).
When examining the odds of FVC
80%, adjusted for age, sex, and ethnic-
ity, individuals with MetS and high CRP
had the greatest odds of FVC 80%
(odds ratio 4.26 [95% CI 2.08­8.73])
followed by individuals with diabetes and
high CRP (2.85 [1.18­6.88]) as com-
pared with those with no MetS/diabetes
and normal CRP (P  0.01 and P  0.05,
respectively) (Table 1). Those with diabe-
tes, regardless of CRP level, had higher
odds of FVC 80% than those with no
MetS/diabetes and normal CRP (3.57
[1.31­9.72] and 2.85 [1.18­6.88], re-
spectively) (P  0.05).
CONCLUSIONS -- We demonstrate
that elevated CRP is associated with re-
duced FVC in individuals with MetS.
Those with elevated CRP have an approx-
imate threefold greater likelihood of low
FVC than those with normal CRP. Indi-
viduals with diabetes appear to have re-
duced FVC regardless of CRP level.
However, individuals with MetS and ele-
vated CRP appear to have odds of reduced
FVC similar to those of individuals with
diabetes, suggesting that CRP measure-
ment may aid in stratification of risk for
low FVC in individuals with MetS.
Recent prospective studies suggest
reduced FVC to be a precursor of dia-
betes and MetS (5). It is not clear why
reduced FVC occurs in people with di-
abetes and MetS, although several pos-
sible explanations have been suggested.
First, in studies involving the alteration
in alveolar wall and capillaries, with
subsequent lung elastic recoil and car-
bon monoxide diffusion tests, there
were no significant differences between
insulin-dependent subjects with diabe-
tes and healthy nonsmokers (13); how-
ever, other studies show a relationship
(14). Second, while hypoxemia could
reduce FVC in diabetes and MetS,
mildly reduced FVC is unlikely to be
associated with significant hypoxemia
(5). Third, inflammation has been
shown to promote impaired lung func-
tion. CRP is an acute-phase protein that
is produced by the liver under the influ-
ence of cytokines. These cytokines are
produced at several extrahepatic sites,
including the heart, vessel wall, and ad-
ipose tissues. Increased CRP levels have
been described in people with diabetes,
MetS, obesity, and inflammation (15).
Limitations of this study include its
cross-sectional design; it is uncertain
whether the inflammatory process actu-
ally led to reduced FVC in those with
MetS and diabetes. An important strength
is the large sample and weighting, allow-
ing findings to be generalized to the U.S.
adult population. Moreover, the stan-
dardized measurement of lung function
and other laboratory measurements, in-
cluding CRP, lipids, and blood pressure,
enabled accurate classification of individ-
uals with MetS and diabetes.
Our study demonstrates that individ-
uals with MetS and elevated CRP levels, in
particular, may have a further increased
likelihood of low FVC, which may further
contribute to increased cardiovascular
disease risk beyond what MetS and CRP
may individually confer. This suggests
that CRP may be useful in risk stratifica-
tion for pulmonary disease in people with
MetS. Longitudinal studies are needed to
confirm the prognostic significance of our
findings.
