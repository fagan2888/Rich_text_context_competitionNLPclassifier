Black residential segregation has been declining in the United States.
That accomplishment rings hollow, however, if blacks continue to live
in much poorer neighborhoods than other Americans. This study uses
census data for all US metropolitan areas in 1980 and 2010 to
compare decline in the neighborhood poverty gap between blacks
and other Americans with decline in the residential segregation of
blacks. We find that both declines resulted primarily from narrow-
ing differences between blacks and whites as opposed to narrowing
differences between blacks and Hispanics or blacks and Asians.
Because black­white differences in neighborhood poverty declined
much faster than black­white segregation, the neighborhood pov-
erty disadvantage of blacks declined faster than black segregation--
a noteworthy finding because the narrowing of the racial gap in
neighborhood poverty for blacks has gone largely unnoticed. Fur-
ther analysis reveals that the narrowing of the gap was produced by
change in both the medians and shapes of the distribution of pov-
erty across the neighborhoods where blacks, whites, Hispanics, and
Asians reside.
neighborhood poverty | residential segregation | racial inequality |
Gini index
Non-Hispanic blacks (hereafter "blacks") generally live in
poorer neighborhoods than other Americans. In metropol-
itan areas in 2010, for example, blacks were nearly four times
more likely than other residents to live in neighborhoods where
the poverty rate was 40% or higher. The racial divide persists
even when comparing households of the same income (1). One
study finds that the average black household with annual earn-
ings of $75,000 resides in a higher-poverty neighborhood than
the average white household with annual earnings of less than
$40,000 (2). However, racial differences in neighborhood envi-
ronments were even greater in the past (3). In this article, we
document a significant narrowing of the black­nonblack gap in
neighborhood poverty levels since 1980 and compare that de-
cline with the decline in black residential segregation over the
same period.
The residential clustering of rich and poor in America is
important because of the diminished life chances for residents
of high-poverty neighborhoods (4, 5). In addition to more noise
and congestion and the absence of green space, high-poverty
neighborhoods in America often are characterized by poor
schools, reduced access to healthy food, high crime rates, and
weak social institutions. Sizable neighborhood inequality is
particularly troubling when high neighborhood poverty is as-
sociated with race (6). If exposure to poverty adversely affects
child development and educational attainment, as recent re-
search suggests (7­11), then disparities in the neighborhood
poverty environments of blacks versus more advantaged groups
may be an important factor in the persistence of racial in-
equality across generations (12).
The term "black neighborhood disadvantage" is used in this
article as shorthand for the difference in poverty rates of the
neighborhoods where blacks and other Americans live. Although
black neighborhood disadvantage requires black residential
segregation--blacks and nonblacks cannot be unequally distrib-
uted across rich and poor neighborhoods unless they are unequally
distributed across neighborhoods--the neighborhood disadvantage
of blacks need not change at the same rate, or even in the same
direction, as black residential segregation. This study compares
the two trends and quantifies the contributions of black­white,
black­Hispanic, and black­Asian neighborhood change to overall
change in the segregation and neighborhood disadvantage of
blacks in metropolitan America.
The findings advance our understanding of how racial neigh-
borhood segregation and inequality have been changing in
America. By using a common metric for neighborhood segre-
gation and inequality, we show that the neighborhood disad-
vantage of blacks has declined faster than the neighborhood
segregation of blacks, and by applying a decomposition method,
we show that black disadvantage declined faster than black
segregation primarily because of trends for blacks vis-à-vis
whites, as opposed to blacks vis-à-vis Hispanics or Asians. Fur-
ther analysis reveals that the decline in black neighborhood
disadvantage was due to changes in the shapes as well as in the
medians of the race-specific neighborhood poverty distributions.
Change in the Neighborhood Poverty Disadvantage of
Blacks, 1980­2010
In America, neighborhoods are where the nation's economic
cleavages are most visibly "etched in place" (13). Neighborhood
conditions historically have been particularly harsh for blacks, as
depicted in Fig. 1. The Lorenz curve (14) in Fig. 1 is constructed
by arranging the 57,370 US metropolitan neighborhoods (census
tracts) from poorest (highest poverty rate) to least poor based on
Significance
Racial inequality in America persists in part because of racial
differences in exposure to adverse neighborhood environments.
Blacks in particular are significantly more likely than other
Americans to live in high-poverty neighborhoods--neighbor-
hoods characterized by poor schools and limited access to
healthcare, jobs, and beneficial social networks--resulting in
inequality of opportunity, as life chances are diminished for
residents of such neighborhoods. In addition, the greater expo-
sure to crime, noise, and congestion implies a lower quality of
life, on average, for black Americans. Because black neighbor-
hood disadvantage results in inequality of life chances based on
race, it is important to determine the direction, pace, and sources
of change in black­nonblack differences in neighborhood pov-
erty in America.

census data for 1980. The curve plots the cumulative proportion
of blacks in the neighborhoods (x axis) by the cumulative pro-
portion of nonblacks in the neighborhoods (y axis), where non-
blacks consist of Hispanics, Asians, and non-Hispanic whites.
If blacks and nonblacks were distributed equivalently over rich
and poor neighborhoods, 10% of each group would reside in
the poorest 10% of neighborhoods, 20% of each group in the
poorest 20% of neighborhoods, and so on, coinciding with the
diagonal line of equality in Fig. 1. Instead, the Lorenz curve lies
well below the line, reflecting a high concentration of blacks in
poorer-than-average neighborhoods.
The degree of black neighborhood disadvantage is quantified
as the difference between the Lorenz curve and the line of
equality. There are two standard ways to measure this difference.
The first, the index of dissimilarity (D), measures the difference
as the vertical distance between the curve and the line of equality
at its greatest point. The second, the Gini coefficient (15), is the
proportion of the area below the diagonal that falls within the
curve (the shaded area in Fig. 1). Both indexes range in value
from zero (no black disadvantage) to 1.0 (all blacks live in poorer
neighborhoods than all nonblacks). We use the Gini in our
analysis because it is based on information for the entire distri-
bution and is decomposable (Table 1) whereas D is based on a
single point on the Lorenz curve and is not decomposable.
The Gini coefficient is 0.65 in Fig. 1 (D = 0.51), indicating large
differences in the neighborhood poverty rates for blacks and other
Americans in 1980. The curve includes the point (0.50, 0.077), for
example, indicating that in 1980 only 7.7% of nonblacks lived in
neighborhoods where the poverty rate was as high as or higher
than where the typical (median) black lived. By 2010, this figure
had increased from 7.7 to 22.5% and the Gini had declined to
0.39. To understand how this reduction in black neighborhood
disadvantage came about, note that the Lorenz curve--and thus
its associated Gini--is a population-weighted average of the black­
white, black­Hispanic, and black­Asian Lorenz curves (for a figure
showing the three Lorenz curves, see Fig. S1).
Hence change in the black­nonblack Gini from 1980 to 2010
derives from change in the three constituent Ginis plus change
in the population composition of the nonblack population.
Formally, let the black­nonblack Gini at a point in time be
expressed as G = 
P

 Gi, where i indexes the nonblack group
of interest, pi
is the proportion of the nonblack population in that
group, and Gi

We are not aware of prior work that has decomposed change in
inequality by partitioning the Gini in this manner.
Table 1 reports the additive and interactive components of the
decline in black neighborhood disadvantage from 1980 to 2010.
There are two critical findings. The first is that black­nonblack
neighborhood inequality declined by 40% based on the Gini,
from 0.65 in 1980 to 0.39 in 2010 (D declined by 43%, from 0.51
to 0.29). Although blacks today are still much more likely than
other Americans to live in high-poverty neighborhoods, there has
been a sizable narrowing of the black­nonblack neighborhood
poverty gap since 1980. The second critical finding is that the
reduction was driven primarily by the narrowing of neighborhood
poverty rates between whites and blacks. Because whites con-
stitute the majority of the nonblack population, the notable de-
cline of 0.21 Gini units in black­white inequality (Table 1) had a
large compressing effect on black­nonblack neighborhood in-
equality, accounting for the large majority of the overall decline.
Change in the composition of the nonblack population was the
next largest factor, accounting for about one-fourth of the de-
cline. Change in black­Hispanic and in black­Asian inequality
combined was responsible for only about 10% of the decline in
black­nonblack neighborhood inequality.
Change in the Neighborhood Segregation of Blacks, 1980­2010
Residential segregation in America has been the subject of much
research in the social sciences (6, 16­23). Black segregation has
been a particular concern because of its magnitude and history.
As recently as 1980 the Gini coefficient for black­nonblack resi-
dential segregation in metropolitan America was 0.89 (D = 0.75),
far exceeding the degree of inequality in black­nonblack neigh-
borhood poverty at that time (Gini = 0.65, D = 0.51).

The general consensus among researchers--that the segrega-
tion of blacks is high, and will remain so well into the future--
was called into question in 2012 by a highly publicized report
proclaiming the approaching end of the residential segregation
of blacks in America (24). Critics of the report argued that it
overstated the decline in black segregation by, among other things,
failing to distinguish black Hispanics from African Americans
(25). Most critics agree, however, that black residential segrega-
tion is declining. From Table 1 we know that black­nonblack
differences in neighborhood poverty have diminished notably
since 1980. Using data from the same neighborhoods and applying
the same methods, do we arrive at the same conclusion about
change in black segregation?
To address this question, we reanalyzed the 57,370 metro-
politan neighborhoods, this time focusing on change in their
racial composition. Because neighborhood segregation is a type
of inequality--the unequal distribution of racial groups across
neighborhoods--black segregation can be analyzed using the
same metric (Gini units) and the same tool (Gini decomposition)
that we used to analyze change in black neighborhood disadvan-
tage. To directly compare black segregation with black disadvan-
tage, we calculated segregation for the total US metropolitan
population following the same procedure that we used to calculate
black disadvantage, which is best measured at the national level.
For metropolitan America as a whole, then, we compare the dis-
tribution of blacks and nonblacks across neighborhoods (segrega-
tion) with the distribution of blacks and nonblacks across rich and
poor neighborhoods (disadvantage).
The Lorenz curve for segregation is formed by ordering neigh-
borhoods based on the percentage of residents who are black, from
highest to lowest, and plotting the cumulative proportion of blacks
in the neighborhoods (x axis) by the cumulative proportion of
nonblacks (y axis) (26). If every US neighborhood had the same
proportion of blacks--complete black integration--the Lorenz
curve would coincide with the diagonal line of equality. Fig. 2 dis-
plays the Lorenz segregation curves for US metropolitan areas in
1980 and 2010. Both curves lie well below the line, revealing very
high levels of black residential segregation both years. For example,
the curve for 1980 includes the point (0.50, 0.008), indicating that in
1980 half of the black population resided in neighborhoods that
were home to less than 1% of the nonblack population.
The Lorenz curve for 2010 is closer to the line of equality,
indicating that black segregation has moderated somewhat since
1980. Black segregation nonetheless diminished by only 0.13
Gini units (from 0.89 to 0.76), as indicated by the shaded area in
Fig. 2--well short of the 0.26 Gini unit decline in black­nonblack
neighborhood inequality over the same period. Fig. 3 displays the
sources of this difference by comparing the decomposition of the
decline in black­nonblack segregation (Table 2) with the de-
composition of the decline in black neighborhood disadvantage
(Table 1). The critical finding is that black neighborhood dis-
advantage declined more than black segregation primarily be-
cause the decline in black­white disadvantage greatly outpaced
the decline in black­white segregation and secondarily because
change in the racial/ethnic composition of the nonblack pop-
ulation affected inequality more than it affected segregation. The
changing residential circumstances of Asians and Hispanics rel-
ative to blacks, on the other hand, accounted for very little of the
faster decline in black neighborhood disadvantage.
We also compared black segregation with black neighborhood
disadvantage within each of the four major regions of the country
to determine whether we would find the same pattern of results
across regions with different population composition (blacks
comprise about 20% of the population in the South, for instance,
but only 6% in the West). Regional changes in fact mirrored
changes at the national level. In every region, black disadvan-
tage diminished faster than black segregation, and in every in-
stance, this finding was largely due to changes in the poverty
rates and racial compositions of the neighborhoods where
blacks and whites (as opposed to Hispanics or Asians) lived. As
one would expect, Hispanic­black change had a greater impact
on change in black disadvantage and segregation in the West,
where Hispanics constitute a larger share of the nonblack
population. Hispanic­black change nonetheless accounted for
very little of the faster decline in black disadvantage in the West
because the decline in Hispanic­black segregation nearly kept
pace with the decline in the neighborhood disadvantage of
blacks relative to Hispanics (Fig. S2).

Changes in the Distribution of Neighborhood Poverty by
Race: Median Shifts and Shape Shifts
Although blacks on average still live in the poorest neighborhoods,
they live in relatively better neighborhoods vis-à-vis nonblacks in
2010 than in 1980. As shown in the Gini decompositions above,
most of the relative gain of blacks from 1980 to 2010 was due to
narrowing differences in the poverty rates of neighborhoods where
blacks and whites live. In this section, we use relative distribution
methods (27) to compare change in the distribution of neighbor-
hood poverty directly for blacks versus whites, blacks versus His-
panics, and blacks versus Asians. We focus on change in the
overlap of the distributions because increasing overlap means
declining black disadvantage. Relative distribution methods ac-
count for change in the overlap of two distributions by separating
the contributions of median shifts from the contributions of shape
shifts. The method enables us to determine, for example, how
much of the decline in black­white neighborhood disadvantage is
due to convergence in the median neighborhood poverty rate for
blacks and whites and how much is due to changes in the shapes of
the two distributions.
From the declines in inequality observed in Table 1, we know
that there is greater overlap in the black­white, black­Hispanic,
and black­Asian distributions in 2010 than there was in 1980.
Which distributions moved, and in what direction? Table 3 pro-
vides descriptive data. From 1980 to 2010, there was a leftward
shift in the black distribution, toward lower poverty neighborhoods,
and a rightward shift in the distribution for each of the other
groups, toward poorer neighborhoods. Blacks, then, were the only
major population group in metropolitan America who were living
in lower-poverty neighborhoods in 2010 than in 1980. As a result,
the difference in median neighborhood poverty rates declined by
4.6 percentage points for blacks and whites, by 5.0 percentage
points for blacks and Hispanics, and by 4.4 percentage points for
blacks and Asians. These median shifts are likely to account for
much of the decline in the neighborhood disadvantage of blacks.
Black neighborhood disadvantage might also have been di-
minished by shifts in the shapes of neighborhood poverty dis-
tributions. The effects of shape shifts depend on the location as
well as the size of the shifts. Shape shifts are most consequential
where the two distributions being compared overlap the most.
For whites and blacks, for example, whites' shape shifts have the
greatest effect when they occur in the neighborhoods where poverty
rates are above average for whites, where there is the greatest overlap
with prevailing neighborhood poverty rates for blacks.
Figs. 4­6 show the neighborhood poverty distribution for blacks
relative to the distributions for whites (Fig. 4), Hispanics (Fig. 5),
and Asians (Fig. 6) in 1980 and 2010. The figures reveal narrowing
of the black neighborhood disadvantage with respect to each of
the other racial/ethnic groups. The convergence is particularly
notable for blacks and Hispanics. If those trends continue, in the
near future Hispanics will tend to live in poorer neighborhoods
than blacks.
Close inspection of the figures reveals the median shifts
reported in Table 3--the leftward shift of the black distribution
and the rightward shift of the distributions for whites, Hispanics,
and Asians. More obvious, however, is the "flattening" of the curves
for whites, Hispanics, and Asians. For whites especially, the peak of
the curve declined notably, and the right (higher poverty) tail en-
larged. Because the distributions for whites, Hispanics, and Asians
all thickened in the regions of the curve where a large share of
blacks reside, we expect to find that white, Hispanic, and Asian
shape shifts all contributed to the decline in black disadvantage,
independent of median shifts. The shape of the black distribution in
2010 closely resembles its shape in 1980, so we anticipate that
change in the shape of the black distribution contributed little to the
decline in black disadvantage (except in the case of Hispanics,
where a small shape shift for blacks is likely to be consequential due
to the substantial overlap in the Hispanic and black distributions).
Table 4 reports results using relative distribution methods to
isolate the contributions of median shifts and shape shifts. As
expected, median shifts were responsible for much of the decline
in black neighborhood disadvantage, accounting for about three-
fourths of the black­white decline, half of the black­Hispanic
decline, and two-thirds of the black­Asian decline. For black
disadvantage vis-à-vis whites and Asians, the remainder of the
decline was due to the shape shift for whites and Asians, re-
spectively--none was due to shape shift in the poverty distribu-
tion for blacks themselves. Indeed, the shape shift effect for
blacks is negative (but small) when blacks are compared with
whites, indicating that black neighborhood disadvantage vis-à-vis
whites would have increased, not declined, had the distributions
for blacks and whites remained constant except for the shape of
blacks' neighborhood poverty distribution. The decline in black
disadvantage vis-à-vis Hispanics was driven roughly equally by
blacks' shape shift (28%) and by Hispanics' shape shift (25%).
This finding is not surprising, given the considerable overlap in
the neighborhood poverty distributions for blacks and Hispanics.
Finally, there is a negative interaction effect for blacks and
Asians, indicating that the joint effect of median shifts and shape
shifts operated to reduce the magnitude of the decline in black
neighborhood disadvantage vis-à-vis Asians.

Conclusions About Neighborhood Change for Blacks:
Upward Economic Mobility with Modest Racial Integration
Blacks have been achieving more equal economic residential
footing with other Americans faster than they have been achieving
residential integration with other Americans. This state of affairs
raises the question of why, during a period of legal sanctions against
housing discrimination on the basis of race, black neighborhood
disadvantage has proved to be more tractable than black neigh-
borhood segregation. As shown in this study, the principal source
of the faster decline in black disadvantage than in black segre-
gation is the greater black­white convergence in neighborhood
poverty rates than in neighborhood coresidence. Blacks have
become less residentially disadvantaged primarily because of
their diminished neighborhood poverty differences with whites,
the largest racial group in America. The narrowing of black­
Hispanic and black­Asian differences matters much less for
either black disadvantage or black segregation.
The findings of this study challenge three perceptions about
the racial stratification of America's neighborhoods. First, the
end of black segregation is not at hand. As of 2010, the black­
nonblack segregation Gini was 0.76, with half of the metropoli-
tan black population living in neighborhoods that were home to
only 3.6% of the nonblack population. Clearly, the residential
segregation of blacks remains very high in America.
Second, in contrast to the view that blacks have become less
segregated largely because Hispanics and Asians have served as a
buffer between blacks and whites (28), we find that Hispanic­
black and Asian­black integration collectively accounted for only
about 18% of the decline in black segregation from 1980 to 2010.
White­black integration, in contrast, accounted for about 72%
of the decline. To be sure, white­black differences count more
because whites outnumber Hispanics and Asians. However, that
is the point: had white­black segregation not changed, the de-
cline in the residential segregation of blacks between 1980 and
2010 would have been only about one-fourth as large. That fact is
not easily deduced from patterns of mobility into or out of poor
neighborhoods (29, 30) or from research on white flight from
neighborhoods as blacks move in (31). It is difficult to infer ag-
gregate neighborhood change from household migration (32),
and only by directly decomposing the change in black­nonblack
segregation do we discover that the decline in the residential
segregation of blacks in America has been driven primarily by
reduction in the residential separation of blacks and whites.
Third, the reduction in black segregation was not the most
significant change in the racial stratification of America's
neighborhoods from 1980 to 2010. Over this period, there was a
much greater--although less noticed--narrowing of neighbor-
hood poverty differences between blacks and other Americans in
general and between blacks and whites in particular.
Our analysis reveals the sources of the narrowing neighbor-
hood poverty gap between blacks and other Americans. We now
know that the decline in black disadvantage resulted primarily
from the narrowing of the black­white gap in neighborhood
poverty. We also know how distributional changes produced the
decline in black disadvantage: shape shifts for whites, Hispanics,
and Asians accounted for part of the decline in the relative
disadvantage of blacks, but a larger portion of the decline was
due to median shifts--lower neighborhood poverty rates for
blacks and higher rates for whites, Hispanics, and Asians. The
growth in neighborhood poverty rates for whites squares with
census reports showing a sharp increase in the number of poor
whites living in poor neighborhoods (33). The decline in neigh-
borhood poverty for blacks is consistent with evidence of the
movement of blacks into middle-income neighborhoods (18, 34,
35); when a growing middle class black population moves from
low income to middle income neighborhoods that are pre-
dominantly black, black neighborhood disadvantage declines faster
than black segregation, in line with the findings here. The reasons
for these trends are only partly understood. It is likely that the
gentrification of poor urban areas (36) and a softening of white
aversion to black neighbors (figure 3.5 in ref. 37) are responsible for
some of the reduction in black neighborhood disadvantage. The
movement of immigrant populations to new destinations (38, 39)
might have played a role as well.
In light of evidence that racial disparity in neighborhood eco-
nomic conditions serves as a source of racial differences in life
chances (8, 9), black neighborhood disadvantage undercuts the
American ideal of equality of opportunity. The Gini value for
black­white inequality in neighborhood poverty was 0.48 in 2010,
indicating that on average blacks still reside in significantly poorer
neighborhoods than whites. A serious concern is that black­white
differences in wealth inequality (40)--inequality that itself is based
to a large extent on racial differences in housing assets (41)--
might slow or halt further narrowing of the black­white neigh-
borhood poverty gap. With the high cost of housing, for example,
intergenerational transfers are likely to become increasingly im-
portant, so black deficiencies in home wealth today might make it

more difficult for the next generation of blacks to escape high-
poverty neighborhoods. There is no guarantee, then, that the
decline in black­white neighborhood inequality will continue. Al-
though residential segregation dominates the headlines, the future
direction and pace of change in racial neighborhood inequality is
likely to have greater implications for American society.
Materials and Methods
Neighborhood Data. When we ask whether blacks now live in neighborhoods
that are more economically similar to the neighborhoods where other
Americans live, we want to know about disparities in conditions for blacks
and other Americans without regard to whether they live in Atlanta or
Detroit or Los Angeles. By pooling the neighborhood data for all US met-
ropolitan areas, we compare the poverty rates of neighborhoods without
regard to their metropolitan location. In line with many prior studies, we use
census-defined tracts to measure neighborhoods. Census tracts are designed
to be relatively homogeneous units with an optimum size of about 4,000. We
assembled racial composition at the tract level from the 1980 and 2010
decennial censuses. Neighborhood poverty rate is the percentage of indi-
viduals living below the poverty line, which we assembled from long-form
census data for 1980 and from 5-y estimates centered on 2010 from the
American Community Survey. To base findings on the same neighborhoods in
1980 and 2010, we used data where the 1980 census tracts were standardized
to 2010 boundaries (42). We excluded tracts where more than 25% of resi-
dents live in group quarters (such as prisons), yielding a consistent set of
57,370 neighborhoods for both years. Using census data for all places des-
ignated as "metropolitan areas" by the US Census Bureau captures 77% of
the total US population in 1980 and 84% in 2010. We begin with 1980
because it is the first year with adequate census data for Hispanics. The
four major racial/ethnic groups in the analysis--Hispanics, non-Hispanic
whites, non-Hispanic blacks, and Asians--comprise more than 97% of the
US population.
Methods. This study provides a design for revealing the loci of change in the
relative gains or losses of population groups. The design combines Gini de-
composition with relative distribution methods. Although there are various
ways to decompose inequality and segregation (43), the decomposition
method introduced here identifies the group comparisons that matter most
for the relative gains or losses of one population (e.g., blacks) vis-à-vis another
(e.g., nonblacks). Relative distribution analysis in turn identifies the distribu-
tional changes--median shifts versus shape shifts--that account for the
change in a particular group comparison (e.g., blacks versus whites). Both
methods deepen our understanding of change in inequality between groups
by pinpointing where the change is coming from--which subpopulations,
and which parts of the distribution, are driving the change. By combining
the decomposition of Ginis with the decomposition of distributional change
using relative distribution methods, the analysis here provides a template
for future research investigating the relative gains and losses of groups.
