Empirical Ethics
IEEN workshop report: Professionalism in
interdisciplinary and empirical bioethics
John Owens1, Jonathan Ives2 and Alan Cribb1
Abstract
The Interdisciplinary and Empirical Ethics Network was established in 2012 with funding from the Wellcome Trust in
order to facilitate critical and constructive discussion around the nature of the disciplinary diversity within bioethics and
to consider the ongoing development of bioethics as an evolving field of interdisciplinary study. In April 2013, the
Interdisciplinary and Empirical Ethics Network organized a workshop at the Centre for Public Policy Research, King's
College London, which discussed the nature and possibility of professionalism within interdisciplinary and empirical
bioethics. This paper provides a report of that workshop.

Bioethics is a diverse, interdisciplinary field that accom-
modates a broad range of perspectives and traditions.
In 2012, the Interdisciplinary and Empirical Ethics
Network (IEEN) was established with funding from
the Wellcome Trust to facilitate critical and construct-
ive discussion around the nature of this disciplinary
diversity and the ongoing development of bioethics as
an evolving field of interdisciplinary study. In April
2013, the IEEN's third workshop was held at the
Centre for Public Policy Research, King's College
London, to consider issues associated with profession-
alism in interdisciplinary and empirical bioethics. The
workshop focused on bioethicists' occupation of pro-
fessional roles, either at institutions or in association
with bodies authorised by professional groups, and
sought to explore how these roles are socially con-
structed, the ethical dimensions attached to the per-
formance of these professional roles, and how
performance of these roles may be judged and evalu-
ated. Speakers and attendees were asked to consider the
following core questions: (1) What does it mean to be a
good bioethicist, and what expertise is required?
(2) According to what standards should a professional
bioethicist be judged? (3) What authority and influence
do bioethicists have, and how might any potential
authority and influence be recognised, regulated and
evaluated? With these questions in mind, the morning
session considered perspectives on professionalism in
and from bioethics, while the afternoon session was
loosely directed towards the question of whether
professional standards in bioethics could be institution-
ally underpinned.
Søren Holm (University of Manchester) gave the
first presentation of the day with a talk that began by
asking whether there could in fact be a `profession' of
bioethics. He noted that, whilst standards and expertise
are important, when we think about professional stand-
ards we often also think about norms of behaviour. He
asked the question `why might we, as bioethicists, need
a profession', and suggested that one reason may be
that it offers some kind of security and validation of
our work and our views: being a `professional' is better
than being an `amateur'. Considering the various activ-
ities in which bioethicists tend to be engaged, including
their roles as researchers, teachers, experts on commit-
tees and/or public intellectuals and campaigners, Søren
suggested that the extent to which professionalism may
be applied to each of these roles or activities, as well as
the nature of professionalism in each case, depends on
the precise nature of the role or activity in question.
Given the diversity of activities undertaken by bioethi-
cists, Søren was not confident that the notion of profes-
sionalism could successfully and/or straightforwardly

be applied to bioethics in general. He pointed out that
each of these varied roles demand a diverse range of
skills and knowledge, including conceptual, regulatory
and legal knowledge, as well as analytic, problem sol-
ving, interpersonal and communicative skills. Any
notion of a professional expertise in bioethics would
need to be broad enough to encompass this spread of
skills and knowledge.
In an attempt to move beyond the complexities asso-
ciated with such diversity, Søren turned his attention
specifically to professionalism in the case of the empir-
ical bioethics researcher, suggesting that they ought to
be: (1) capable of understanding and executing the
appropriate empirical and analytic methods of empir-
ical bioethics in order to produce rigorous, high-quality
work; (2) aware of the relevant standards and require-
ments for bioethics research as well as potentially
related subject areas and/or disciplines; (3) aware of
the context in which their research will be published
and/or applied and be able to contextulize their findings
in relation to further important ethical questions. Søren
went on to express scepticism about the prospect of
there ever being a profession of `empirical bioethicist'.
Rather, empirical bioethics is something that a bioethi-
cist might do. He concluded that whilst it may be pos-
sible to use broad categories to judge professional
practice in bioethics on a specific case by case basis,
such evaluations seem vague, making it unlikely that
a general standard for understanding and evaluating
the role of the professional bioethicists could be suc-
cessfully drawn up.
Søren's presentation was followed by Richard
Ashcroft (Queen Mary's University of London), who
began by declaring that he is not a bioethicist, despite
holding a professional role as a bioethicist and being
widely recognised as such. He pointed out that profes-
sional roles are socially attributed, making the occupa-
tion of such a role at least partially an issue of meeting
the expectations of others. Given the inherent interdis-
ciplinarity within the field of bioethics, Richard high-
lighted how occupying a professional bioethics role
could be particularly challenging, especially if this
requires one to conform to a variety of paradigms, per-
spectives, traditions and standards. He thus described
professionalism within bioethics as a kind of `brico-
lage', in the sense that one may need to draw upon a
diverse array of resources and techniques in order to
perform as expected. However, despite the need to
work across disciplinary boundaries, Richard suggested
that working as a bioethicist within the academy
requires a clear set of professional qualities, associated
with being a professional academic more generally
rather than a bioethicist in particular: producing work
on time; reviewing work fairly; not speaking of the
unknown; teaching to a certain standard; conducting
oneself as a scholar. Beyond the professional role that
accompanies an academic position, Richard suggested
that bioethicists ought not to seek to become a profes-
sion in the formal sense, and that formal professional
status is neither required nor desirable.
The discussion that followed centred on what it
might mean to perform the role of a bioethicist `well',
as a proxy for `professionally'. John Owens began by
asking whether interdisciplinarity would be a prerequis-
ite for professionalism in bioethics, and this was
answered in the negative by Søren, who argued that
this would be too limiting. Richard supported this, sug-
gesting that being interdisciplinary cannot be necessary
to participate in professional bioethics. Rather, people
need to be good at one particular thing, and be able to
work with people from other disciplines where neces-
sary. Discussion then turned to the question of how we
can tell if bioethics is done well, and Jon Ives, playing
Devil's advocate, suggested that, at least to some
degree, the peer-review process acts as a mechanism
for ensuring that professional standards have been
met in the context of bioethics research, and that this
might be considered as a form of informal self-regula-
tion. In response, a number of problems with the peer-
review process as a model for self-regulation were con-
sidered by the group: reviewers' attitudes can vary
between being overly critical and overly sympathetic;
there are a number of journal publications within the
field of bioethics spanning a variety of genres, styles,
disciplinary orientations and readerships, making it dif-
ficult to find standard criteria for good research in bio-
ethics; there is not yet an established canon of
literature in empirical and interdisciplinary bioethics
against which standards could be judged.
The discussion then moved on to consider the power
of bioethics professionals, with the suggestion from
Suzanne Shale that it may be possible to identify an
outline of the bioethics profession through the specific
interests that they assert. Søren Holm suggested that
the development of a profession in bioethics might be
seen to emerge through the development of sociological
and philosophical critiques of powerful medical and
legal discourses and practices; and whilst this picture
may account for the emergence of bioethics as a com-
munity, it does not support calls for recognising bio-
ethics as a profession. In response to aired concerns
that bioethics lacks a common aim, methodology and
forms of evaluation and regulation, and may therefore
be too broad and nebulous to be called a profession,
Alan Cribb suggested that bioethics may plausibly be
thought of as a label which describes a collective group
of diverse sub-professions. On this reading, bioethics
would not be considered a profession in the formal
sense, but the question about the power attached to
the role of bioethicist remains important. Picking up

on the idea of sub-professions, Jon Ives then noted that
a perennial problem for professionalism, in the context
of bioethics, may be that there is a sense in which there
is no need to have specialists in bioethics, given that the
roles bioethicists play (that of commenting on ethical
issues and critiquing practice) can arguably be taken on
by anyone with an interest in those issues. The need for
a profession, and for a recognition of disciplinary
expertise for the bioethicist, is one unique to the acad-
emy, and not a concern for wider society. Richard
Ashcroft agreed that all medical professionals are sup-
posed to routinely engage with bioethics, and suggested
that their willing and respectful attitudes towards bio-
ethics may be more important than specialist bioethical
knowledge.
The afternoon session began with a presentation by
Suzanne Shale, an ethics consultant and research asso-
ciate at The University of Oxford's ETHOX Centre.
Suzanne presented her ethics consultancy work as an
example of how professional bioethics can be per-
formed beyond academic and clinical contexts.
Suzanne began by exploring how moral life is different
from moral research. In real life we negotiate moral
demands through narratives of value, relationships
and identity, where normative expectations regulate
our behaviour and we have strong reactive attitudes
when these expectations are breached. Given the
dynamic nature of our moral experience, Suzanne ques-
tioned what it is that the professional bioethicist claims
to know and to do, and the domain in which this tends
to occur. She suggested that the domain of professional
bioethics tends to be one of expert reasoning about the
moral literature and social fields of law, education,
policy and research, and that their core function tends
to involve providing criticism, guidance and support.
Suzanne's approach to bioethics is less typical, and
does not conform to this professional orthodoxy. She
describes herself as working in the domain of moral
dialogue, with a focus on the emotional intensity asso-
ciated with moral norm expectations and a function of
providing space for conversations about the moral
experience for those who require this sort of support.
She explained that her work often focuses on processes
of moral repair for people who have been harmed by
medical institutions by providing a means of exploring
experiences of harm through moral dialogue. Drawing
on Walker's1 work on moral repair and Berlinger's2
studies on the ethics of forgiveness, Suzanne uses litera-
ture from bioethics to create spaces for moral conver-
sations about grief, healing and repair to take place
which have a positive impact on those with which she
works. Suzanne's account testifies to the diverse and
varied nature of professional roles within bioethics.
Suzanne was followed by Hugh Whittall, director of
the Nuffield Council on Bioethics (NCB). In his
presentation, Hugh identified interdisciplinary ethics
as important to the NCB's work, which he described
as typically identifying ethical issues to which value
based, empirical and analytical reasoning processes
could be applied to reach conclusions for policy appli-
cation. He suggested that professionalism in the insti-
tutional context of the NCB might comprise having
sufficient knowledge and expertise, as well as having
the ability to engage in appropriate behaviour to meet
expectations. Hugh identified a variety of potential pro-
fessional roles for bioethicists: (1) decision-making
roles which might take place in a group or an institu-
tional context, but may also be undertaken as an indi-
vidual (whether as a patient, professional, academic,
etc.) embedded within a social context; (2) expert
roles which might involve providing support, critique,
advice or guidance; (3) practical policy roles which
might involve implementing a decision that has been
made, and could mean taking into account guidance
from experts. Hugh's central point was that establish-
ing the nature, purpose and conditions of a role is key
for understanding what professionalism may mean in
any given context. Hugh suggested that the NCB's
institutional role is also context dependent, but nor-
mally involves identifying and interpreting questions,
locating a decision-maker and producing reports
which would support decision-making. He identified
transparent justification as key to good performance,
and explained that this meant making the values and
empirical data on which the Council's reports are based
open and available for public scrutiny. In this way,
Hugh suggested that the NCB could potentially be
seen as a bioethics institution fulfilling a professional
role, but this doesn't involve decision-making, under-
writing what is correct or underpinning standards
within bioethics. Whilst an institution might one day
be created to codify standards of practise within bio-
ethics, and thus lend bioethicists a professional status,
Hugh concluded by suggesting that the professional
status of bioethics is less important than ensuring that
bioethics is practised to a high standard. As such, insti-
tutions like the NCB can be a useful mechanism for
supporting high-quality bioethics activity through
forms of education (for example, by presenting syllabus
contents for bioethics courses) or practice (for example,
by engaging in and/or promoting certain forms of
behaviour). However, Hugh acknowledged that these
measures may not be sufficient for ensuring high-qual-
ity outcomes in bioethics; indeed we may be worried
that they might promote certain forms, discourses and
practices of bioethics at the expense of other valu-
able elements. For this reason, the potential limitations
of institutions contributing to bioethics ought to be
recognised alongside their potential strengths and
resources.

In the discussion that followed, Suzanne was asked
to clarify the difference between her work in moral
repair and therapy. She replied that whilst there are
similarities, particularly insofar as there is a one-to-
one focus, the difference is in the subject matter. Her
work very much centres on having a moral conversa-
tion. Hugh Whitall then noted that we all make moral
decisions every day and, by and large, we do this well,
often without really thinking and without making our
reasoning explicit. When the problems get complex we
tend to struggle, and this is when some expertise or
`professional' input might be useful. The implication
here is that the `professional bioethicist', whether
doing the work that Suzanne described, or the work
that the NCB undertakes, can bring something unique
and valuable to the table, in terms of skills and experi-
ence. Whether this `professional' is a single individual,
or a group of people, will depend on the context of the
problem. Picking up on an earlier point from Søren's
talk, John Owens then suggested that given the diver-
gent nature of these bioethics `tasks', it might be insuf-
ficient to use any kind of institutional guidance to
determine what it is to be a bioethics `professional',
as those kinds of rules could never capture the complex-
ity of the roles. Rather, professionalism might be
carved out in contested spaces, and defined in practice
rather than outside of it. Angus Dawson then took the
discussion back to the afternoon talks, and asked (1)
what work is the word `moral' doing in Suzanne's con-
cept of `moral harm'? and, (2) how does the impact
agenda get into the NCB's work and it's professional
identity? Hugh replied, stating that the NCB does not
want to idealise its role. There are various kinds of
impact, ranging from getting people do what the
Council suggests to simply contributing to a discussion.
The NCB attempts to do all of this, and does not con-
sider itself the final authority on matters bioethical.
Coming back the point he made in his talk about a
marker of professionalism, he noted that the NCB
tries to make all of its reasoning very explicit, and
that makes impact, of different kinds, possible (rather
than guaranteed). Suzanne then replied to Angus' ques-
tion by saying that she was not entirely sure what made
something a `moral' issue specifically, but suggested
that wider interpretation is needed than what seems
to be used currently in the academy: we tend to think
about ethics exclusively in terms of the question `what
do we do next?', rather than asking `what do we do
when we have stuffed things up'? The concept of
`moral repair' is tied to the latter, and is not just con-
cerned with relations between individuals, but also with
how an individual can reconcile and accept moral harm
done to them themselves.
Summary
The meeting was successful in its aim of bringing
together members of the bioethics community to
explore questions of professionalism within bioethics.
Whilst no firm conclusions were reached, the presenta-
tions and subsequent discussion highlighted the import-
ance of: (a) unpacking the variety of activities which
bioethicists undertake and the diverse contexts in
which this work takes place; (b) analysing roles, expert-
ise and standards in bioethics in relation to this variety
of activities and diversity of contexts; (c) debating the
benefits that professionalisation within bioethics may
bring against the challenges and potentially negative
consequences of such efforts.
