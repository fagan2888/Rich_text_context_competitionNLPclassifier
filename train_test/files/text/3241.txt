Abstract:
This paper discusses methods to quantify risk and uncertainty in
macroeconomic forecasts. Both, parametric and non-parametric procedures are
developed. The former are based on a class of asymmetrically weighted normal
distributions whereas the latter employ asymmetric bootstrap simulations. Both
procedures are closely related. The bootstrap is applied to the structural
macroeconometric model of the Bundesbank for Germany. Forecast intervals
that integrate judgement on risk and uncertainty are obtained.
Keywords: Macroeconomic forecasts, stochastic forecast intervals, risk,
uncertainty, asymmetrically weighted normal distribution, asymmetric bootstrap.

Non-technical summary
In this paper, procedures for the quantification of risk and uncertainty in
macroeconomic forecasts are developed. The focus is on the integration of
information about asymmetric developments, upward or downward risks, in the
input factors of forecast variables. Parametric as well as non-parametric
procedures are discussed.
The parametric approach is based on asymmetrically weighted normal
distributions, using a logistic function to obtain a continuous density. This allows
to integrate asymmetric information about the distribution of input factors, which
may be correlated, and to aggregate them consistently. To generate
asymmetry, this procedure requires weaker modifications of the underlying
normal distribution than other widely used methods.
More complex forecast models do not allow to determine forecast
uncertainty analytically. In these cases stochastic simulation techniques can be
applied. This paper uses non-parametric bootstrap procedures as they
circumvent the need to make artificial assumption about the distribution of the
stochastic shock terms in the model. To generate forecast intervals for the
endogenous variables, the bootstrap recurs to the same asymmetric weighting
scheme as in the parametric approach.
Finally, the asymmetric bootstrap is applied to the econometric model of
the Bundesbank. The Bundesbank model is an empirically estimated, dynamic
and non-linear macroeconometric model for Germany with about 180 variables.
If the estimated residuals of the model are used asymmetrically in the bootstrap,
asymmetric forecast intervals of the endogenous variables are obtained.
However, the asymmetry of the shocks is partly absorbed within the model
structure such that the endogenous variables of interest, like real growth and
inflation, exhibit markedly less skewness than the shocks.
Nicht-technische Zusammenfassung
In der vorliegenden Arbeit werden Methoden zur Quantifizierung von
Risiko und Unsicherheit bei der Prognose makroökonomischer Variablen
entwickelt. Insbesondere wird untersucht, wie sich Informationen über
asymmetrische Entwicklungen, d.h. auf- oder abwärts gerichtete
Prognoserisiken, bei den Bestimmungsfaktoren von Prognosevariablen
berücksichtigen lassen. Dabei werden sowohl parametrische als auch nicht-
parametrische Verfahren diskutiert.
Die parametrischen Verfahren beruhen auf einer asymmetrisch
gewichteten Normalverteilung, wobei eine logistische Funktion verwendet wird,
um eine stetige Dichtefunktion zu erhalten. Damit lassen sich asymmetrische
Informationen über die Verteilung von Bestimmungsfaktoren, die untereinander
auch korreliert sein dürfen, abbilden und konsistent aggregieren. Das Verfahren
erzeugt Asymmetrie mit einer deutlich schwächeren Modifikation der zugrunde
liegenden Normalverteilung als andere verbreitete Methoden.
Komplexere Prognosemodelle lassen eine analytische Bestimmung von
Prognoseunsicherheit und Prognoserisiken nicht mehr zu. In diesen Fällen
können stochastische Simulationen eingesetzt werden. In dieser Arbeit werden
nicht-parametrische Bootstrap-Verfahren verwendet, die keine willkürlichen
Annahmen über die Verteilung der stochastischen Schocks des Modells
erfordern. Bei den Bootstrap-Ziehungen wird das gleiche asymmetrische
Gewichtungsschema wie bei den parametrischen Verfahren benutzt, um
Prognoseintervalle für die endogenen Variablen zu schätzen.
Das asymmetrische Bootstrap-Verfahren wird auf das ökonometrische
Bundesbankmodell angewandt. Das Bundesbankmodell ist ein empirisch
geschätztes, nichtlineares und dynamisches strukturelles Makromodel für
Deutschland mit etwa 180 Variablen. Werden die stochastischen Störterme
beim Bootstrap asymmetrisch verwendet, so ergeben sich asymmetrische
Prognoseintervalle für die endogenen Variablen. Wie sich jedoch zeigt, werden
asymmetrische Schocks im Modellzusammenhang teilweise absorbiert, so dass
die interessierenden endogenen Variablen wie reales Wachstum und Inflation
eine deutlich geringere Schiefe aufweisen.

Quantifying Risk and Uncertainty in Macroeconomic
Forecasts
1. Introduction
Monetary policy decisions are based on forecasts of inflation, output
growth and many other macroeconomic variables. Central banks often rely on
deterministic point forecasts, usually supplemented by verbal qualifications.
Frequently, baseline forecasts are complemented by alternative scenarios,
singled out as likely alternatives to the baseline. The obtained range of point
forecasts, however, is not a forecast interval which covers a well-defined
probability of outcomes.
Deterministic forecasts do not allow to quantify the associated uncertainty
(dispersion of the distribution) and risk (degree of asymmetry) properly. Wallis
(2007, 54) points out that "it is now widely recognised that a point forecast is
seldom sufficient for well-informed decision-making in the face of an uncertain
future, and that it needs to be supplemented with an indication of the degree of
uncertainty." Uncertainty intervals underline the inherently uncertain nature of
forecasts, they enhance the transparency of a central bank in its communication
with the public, and they facilitate the internal discussion by focussing it on the
sources of uncertainty and their quantitative importance (Blix and Sellin, 1999).
The shape of the uncertainty intervals provides the public with information about
the forecast risks. Depending on the loss functions of the public, information
about forecast risks can be as important as information about forecast
uncertainty. As an example, consider large losses only in case of deflation, and
a positive inflation forecast with low uncertainty but a large downward risk.
Central banks do not rely on a single econometric model to generate their
forecasts. Usually a suite of models is applied and subjective judgements play
an important role. The quantification of forecast risk and uncertainty in such an
environment is not a straightforward task. Resulting in the well-known "fan
charts", the Bank of England (Britton, Fisher, and Whitley, 1998) pioneered a
parametric procedure to determine the distribution of a linear combination of
skewed, yet independent, random input variables. The two-piece normal
distribution is utilised to introduce skewness into the forecast input variables.
Recently, at the Bank of Portugal a parametric method was developed that
achieves skewness by a combination of normal and exponential variates and
allows for correlated input variables (Novo and Pinheiro, 2005).
In this paper, we discuss a parametric and a non-parametric procedure for
quantification of risk and uncertainty in macroeconomic forecasts, mainly
focussing on risk. Whereas the former procedure is based on a generalisation
of the normal distribution, the latter relies on bootstrap simulations. Skewness is
introduced by an asymmetric weighting scheme.
Section 2 introduces a parametric class of asymmetrically weighted normal
(AWN) distributions for constructing forecast intervals. In section 3 a non-
parametric asymmetric bootstrap procedure to calculate forecast intervals that
take risk into account is discussed. This procedure is closely related to the AWN
distributions investigated in section 2. The methods presented in both sections
allow to handle skewness without affecting the mean and the variance of the
input variables. In section 4 the asymmetric bootstrap is applied to generate
forecasts with the structural macroeconometric model of the Bundesbank.
Section 5 concludes.
2. Forecast intervals based on AWN distributions
To quantify forecast risks, according to Azzalini (1985, 171): "it would be
ideal to have at hand a class of densities with the following properties: "strict
inclusion" of the normal density, mathematical tractability, wide range of the
indices of skewness and kurtosis." Based on the Gaussian normal distribution,
we introduce a class of asymmetrically weighted normal (AWN) distributions
which comes close to these requirements. AWN distributions include the normal
as a special case, they allow to quantify asymmetric risk by a single, easily
interpretable parameter, the density of a linear combination of correlated AWN
variables can be obtained by standard numerical integration techniques, and for
one of the AWN distributions, there is no lower or upper bound for its skewness
and no upper bound for its kurtosis.

where the Dk,h
are (estimated or calibrated) interim multipliers or elasticities and
h denotes the forecast horizon.1 The forecasts may be the output of an
econometric forecasting model, they may be based on expert judgement, or on
a combination of both.
We assume that the forecast errors of the input variables, denoted as

The error variables Zk
may be correlated with covariance matrix 6. The density
of their linear combination (3) can be obtained by standard procedures (Fisz,
1976). The resulting density would be symmetric, however.
2.2.The asymmetrically weighted normal (AWN)
distribution
Often, in a specific forecasting round, the forecaster may have information
which leads him to judge the forecast risks to be asymmetric, tilted upward or

lowercase letters for their realizations.
downward. Hence, led by subjective judgement, he may wish to deviate from
the normal distribution by rendering the forecasts asymmetric.
Despite the importance of risk in macroeconomic forecasts, there is no
established procedure for quantification of these risks. According to Machina
and Rothschild (1987), there are two basic requirements for a measure of risk.
First, the measure of risk must be related to the probability distribution of the
underlying random variable, e.g. inflation or output growth. Second, the risk
measure should be linked to preferences of the forecasting agent. Often,
quadratic loss functions are used in order to represent such preferences, as
pointed out by Woodford (2003, ch. 6). However, loss functions can take many
functional forms. Kilian and Manganelli (2007), for example, proposed an
asymmetric loss function for the risk of deflation and excessive inflation.
Because there is no generally accepted specification of a loss function, in this
paper we express the risk assessment of the forecaster simply as a probability.
An upward (downward) risk in the forecast of an input factor is measured by the
probability of a positive (negative) forecast error.
Assume that for the forecast period an upward forecast risk with probability Z is
expected. To take this into account, the random variable Z is transformed
according to Z J( ) Z (1 J( )) Z
{ Z   Z , where J(Z) is an indicator variable which
takes the value 1 with probability Z and the value 0 with probability 1­Z. The
density function of the variable Z is defined as

random variable Z has an asymmetrically weighted normal (AWN) distribution

The transformation shifts probability mass from the left hand side of the
underlying normal distribution to the right hand side (or vice versa) by

section 3 we apply the asymmetric weighting scheme non­parametrically in stochastic model
simulations.

proportionally scaling the density up or down, respectively. The AWN
distribution has two parameters, V as a measure of uncertainty and Z as a
measure of risk (asymmetry). For Z = 0.5 the normal distribution with zero mean
is obtained as a special case. For 1( 0)
Z o o the so called half-normal
distribution results, which may be regarded as extreme asymmetry. The mode
of the AWN is zero. The AWN density jumps at z = 0, the absolute size of the
jump being 2 12 (0)

  Z  d d 
Hence, the asymmetric weighting scheme does not distort the relative
probabilities of the underlying normal distribution M(z). This is a desirable
feature because no a priori knowledge with regard to more or less likely sub-
intervals for upward or downward risks is implied. The mean of the AWN is

where V denotes the second, S the third and W the fourth central moment. For
Z = 0.5 the moments of the normal distribution are obtained: m = 0, V = V2, S =
0, W = 3V4.
The forecaster may not wish that the risk assessment changes the mean and
variance of an input variable. In this case the following modification of the
density function (4) can be applied:

Similar to the two-piece normal distribution (John, 1982), the underlying normal
distribution has variance V1

Hence, despite skewness, the mean and the variance of the distribution remain
unchanged. Also note that no new parameter was introduced to get this
property. The skewness s(z) and the kurtosis w(z) are given by

Obviously, there is no upper or lower limit for skewness and no upper limit for
kurtosis. The lowest kurtosis equals 3 and is obtained with Z = 0.5, i.e. in the
case where Z is normally distributed.
2.3.The logistic asymmetrically weighted normal
(LAWN) distribution
In principle, the density of the linear combination (3) of several AWN­random
variables could be calculated. However, due to the discontinuity, this exercise is
burdensome because a rapidly increasing number of cases has to be treated
separately. For this reason we apply a continuous approximation of the AWN.
Consider the logistic function

Its derivative H'(z) is a density, which is symmetric about zero. The logistic
asymmetric weight function is now defined as
(9) O Z  Z  O  Z O
G( z; ) (1 )(1 H( z)) H( z)
where 0 1
d Z d , and O > 0 is a technical coefficient that controls the closeness
of the approximation to the step function (4). Chart 1 shows the logistic weight
function (9) for upward risks [Z=0.75,O= (1, 10)], and downward risk:
[Z=0.35,O= 10].
With increasing O the approximation to the weighting scheme of the AWN
becomes closer. In the limit we get:

We define the logistic asymmetrically weighted normal (LAWN) distribution for
the random Variable Z as:
(11) f(z; , , ) 2G( z; ) (z; )
Z V O O Z M V
where M V
(z; ) is the density of a normal random variable Z with zero mean and
variance V2: Z LAWN( , , )
V Z O
 .
It has yet to be shown that (11) is indeed a density. Azzalini (1985, 172) proved
the following
Lemma: Let M be a density function symmetric about zero, and : an
absolute continuous distribution function such that :' is symmetric about
0. Then : O M f   f
2 ( z) (z) ( z ) is a density function for any real O.
From this lemma we deduce the
Corollary: If : O M
2 ( z) (z) is a density, and G(Oz) is the logistic weighting
function (9) then 2G( z) (z)
O M is a density function as well.
Proof: The logistic function H in (8) satisfies the requirements of : in the
lemma. Since G(Oz) in (9) can be written as (2 1)H( z) 1
Z  O   Z, the
following holds:
2G( z) (z)dz

Since, in addition, all other conditions for density functions are fulfilled by
(11), f(z; , , ) 2G( z; ) (z; )
Z V O O Z M V is a density function.
If the forecaster wants to preserve the mean and variance of the risk-adjusted
forecast, a modification similar to (4') can be applied

Chart 2a shows the density function (11) for [V 1,Z=0.5,O=0] (standard
normal density), [V 1,Z=0.75,O=3] and [V 1,Z=0.75,O=100]. Chart 2b
shows the same distributions with mean and variance preserved according to
(11').

Table 1 provides numerical moments of the LAWN­distribution. For Z = 0.5
(any O) or for O = 0 (any Z) the normal distribution is obtained as a special case.
With increasing O the moments of the LAWN distribution rapidly approach to
those of the AWN distribution.

As the figures in brackets of Table 1 show, applying the mean- and variance-
preserving modification effectively fixes the mean and the variance of the LAWN
distribution at 0 and 1, respectively. However, skewness as well as kurtosis
increase sharply, indicating a stronger deviation from the underlying normal.
2.4. Comparison to other skewed distributions
In this section we briefly discuss three alternative skewed distributions, all
based on the normal, and compare them to the LAWN.
Azzalini (1985) defines the "skew-normal distribution" (SN) as3

are the density and the distribution function of the normal, respectively. The
shape parameter D generates skewness. For D o f the SN distribution
converges to the half-normal. The normal is included as a special case for D =
0.
At the Bank of England, Britton, Fisher and Whitley (1998) use the "two-piece
normal distribution" (TPN) with density

where the sample size was arbitrarily set to n = 100. The widely used JB­
statistic, which is independent of V2, tests whether a linear combination of
skewness and kurtosis deviates from the values implied by the normal
distribution (s = 0, w = 3).4 Measured by the JB­statistic, the LAWN distribution
yields the smallest distortion of the underlying normal distribution, closely
followed by Azzalini's SN distribution. Achieving the same upside risk of Z =
0.40 with the TPN distribution results in a somewhat bigger distortion of the
normal. However, in all three cases the deviation from the normal would not be
statistically significant at the 5 % level.

compared to the SGN distribution, the same degree of asymmetry is obtained
with a much smaller deviation from normality.

3. Forecast intervals based on asymmetric bootstrap
simulations
Many economic models do not allow for an analytical investigation of
forecast risk and uncertainty. This can for example be due to the size of the
model or due to non-linearities. In this case, stochastic simulations can be used
to obtain estimates of forecast uncertainty. Stochastic simulations require
random draws from the model's shocks. While this can be achieved using
distributional assumptions, it is also possible to use the distribution-free
bootstrap-approach. In the following it is discussed how the bootstrap approach
can be modified to incorporate risk and uncertainty assessments into the
stochastic simulations. The approach chosen generates shocks which have an
AWN distribution, if the residuals of the model are normally distributed.
3.1.Stochastic simulations
Consider the reduced form of a dynamic economic model consisting of g
equations given by
(23)  T
t t 1 t t t
y F(y , y ,x ,u ; ) t 1...T.
F denotes a g-vector of functions, yt
(yt-1
) denotes a g-vector of endogenous
(lagged endogenous) variables, xt
denotes a k-vector of exogenous variables, ut
denotes a g-vector of shocks, T is a vector of coefficients, and t = 1...T denotes
the estimation sample of the model. Estimation yields T
^ and t
^
u for t = 1...T.
The model is simulated M times, using random shocks m
h
^
u in every forecast
period h. Starting with m
T T
^
y y , in simulation m the forecast
(24)  T  
m m m
h h 1 h h
^
^ ^ ^ ^
y F(y ,x ,u ; ) h T 1,...,T H; m 1,...,M
emerges.5 The stochastic simulation thus gives samples
^ `
1 2 M
h h h
^ ^ ^
y ,y ,...,y for
every forecast horizon h. From these samples, the statistics of interest like
mean, variance, skewness or confidence bounds can be computed.
3.2.Bootstrap simulations
For stochastic simulations, random shocks m
h
^
u are needed for every
forecast period h and every run m. One way of generating these shocks is
drawing random variables from an appropriate distribution. However, often it is
unclear what the appropriate distribution is. In this case, it can be convenient to
resort to the bootstrap method. The bootstrap method uses the set of the
estimated residual vectors ^ `
1 2 T
^ ^ ^
u ,u ,...,u from which shocks are drawn with
replacement.6 So for every forecast period h and every run m, a number W from
the set ^ `
1,2,...,T is chosen randomly, and the vector W
^
u is used as the vector
of shocks m
h
^
u . The bootstrap method preserves all moments of the empirical
residuals like for example variance, skewness and correlations.
3.3.Asymmetric bootstrap
In certain situations, as discussed above, it might be preferable to adjust
the moments of the empirical residuals in the stochastic simulations in a certain
way. Information beyond those contained in the model might point to important
changes in moments. For instance, rising political tensions in major OPEC
countries or the expectation of a very active hurricane season in the Gulf of
5 In principle one could also draw random values for T
^ . However, we abstract from parameter
uncertainty in this work.
6 If the residuals have non-zero means, they are recentered prior to resampling as suggested
by Berkowitz and Kilian (2000).

Mexico can be expected to increase the level and the volatility of the oil price. It
can also be appropriate to model asymmetric shocks, for example due to
upcoming elections which will be won by a liberal party with high probability or
by a socialist party with low probability. In these cases the standard bootstrap
method can be modified in order to incorporate judgement about future shocks.
Suppose that the forecaster wants to add judgement about mean and volatility
of the shock z, where z denotes the i-th element of m
h
^
u ( { m
i,h
^
z u ), i.e. the shock
to equation i for the forecast horizon h in the run m. This can of course be
achieved by simply transforming the shock z according to
(25)  !

z a bz b 0
where a is the judgemental mean, b is the judgemental volatility factor for shock

z , and z denotes the original shock. Note that these transformations do not
change the correlations with other shocks. Of course, a and b can differ for
each forecast horizon h and each equation i, but they are constant for every run
m.
If the forecaster wants to incorporate judgement about asymmetric risk, this can
be achieved by applying the transformation
(26)    
   Z

z J z 1 J z with J J q
where J(q < Z) is the indicator function that takes the value 1 if the condition q <
Z is satisfied and 0 else; q is the realisation of a random variable which is
uniformly distributed over the interval [0,1] and Z denotes the judgemental
probability that the shock will be larger than zero.7 So J(q < Z) equals 1 in
approximately 100Z percent of the runs.
If the empirical residuals i,t
^
u from which the z's are drawn are normally
distributed, equation (26) implies that 
z has an AWN distribution, i.e. its density
is given by (4). Note that with Z = 0.5, 
z is symmetrically distributed regardless
of the symmetry properties of z.
7 Z can differ for each forecast horizon h and each equation i, but it is constant for every run
m.
If one intends to preserve the zero-mean property and the variance of the
shocks, the formula
(27)  
 Z Z
 
Z  Z

z J z 1 J z

can be used, which in the case of normally distributed residuals yields the
density (4') for 
z . However, in contrast to (4'), one does not have to assume a
specific distribution for z. The mean of 
z equals zero regardless of the
distribution of the empirical residuals i,t
^
u , since the expectation of 
z is given by

If z is symmetric, i.e. if f(z) = f(­z) where f(.) denotes the density function of z,
then the variance of z equals the variance of z . This means that the variance
of 
z equals the variance of the empirical residuals if the empirical residuals are
symmetrically distributed.
20
21
Of course, (26) and (27) can be combined with (25) to generate shocks with
judgemental mean, volatility and asymmetry. In this case, one first uses (26) or
(27) to obtain an asymmetric shock 
z and then applies (25) to this shock in
order to obtain an asymmetric shock with mean a and standard deviation bV,
where V is the standard deviation of 
z .
The correlation of 
z with all other shocks equals zero. Therefore, the proposed
method for generating asymmetries is useful especially if empirical correlations
are low in absolute value.8 In principle, it is possible to modify the approach
presented so that correlations can be preserved in many cases. In the
Appendix, we show how one can generate 
z according to (26) and impose
correlations with another possibly asymmetric shock. However, this modification
becomes very complicated if many shocks are involved. Furthermore, not all
asymmetries can be reconciled with all correlations. For example, if two
variables are supposed to be greater than zero in a large number of cases, i.e.
if both variables have a high Z, this can be incompatible with a negative
correlation between these variables.
If the model's residuals have a normal distribution, are independent, and the
model F(.) is linear, the bootstrap approach yields uncertainty and risk
assessments for the endogenous variables which are identical to those
obtained analytically in the previous section with the class of AWN distributions.
4. Stochastic forecasts with the Bundesbank model
The Bundesbank model is a dynamic non-linear structural
macroeconometric model for Germany containing about 180 variables of which
about 40 are exogenous. The model has 50 behavioural equations. In order to
use this model for stochastic forecasts, it is transformed in two ways. First, the
exogenous variables are endogenized by specifying equations in which they
depend on their own past values and possibly other formerly exogenous
variables. The only variables remaining exogenous are dummies, trends and
8 This is the case for the Bundesbank model used in Section 4. In this model, more than 90
percent of the correlations between the residuals do not differ significantly from zero at a
significance level of 5%.
tax rates. Second, autoregressive equations are specified for the residuals of all
model equations, so that these original residuals become endogenous variables
of the model, and the new residuals of the autoregressive equations are the
model's residuals. This last step is convenient in order to obtain residuals which
are free from autocorrelation.9
4.1.Forecast intervals
The stochastic simulations of the Bundesbank model are performed for the
period from the first quarter of 2006 (henceforth written as 2006q1) to 2008q4.
The residuals are drawn from the period 1992q1 to 2005q4. We conduct 10,000
simulations. Since the results will be compared to those of an asymmetric
bootstrap simulation, we use symmetric residuals here. This is achieved by
multiplying all residuals of a given run m with a constant O determined by
 
2 J q 0.5 1
O   , where again J(q < 0.5) is the indicator function that takes
the value 1 if the condition q < 0.5 is satisfied and 0 else, and q is the realisation
of a uniformly distributed random variable in the interval [0,1].
Chart 7 shows the resulting forecasts for the four-quarter growth rates of GDP
and the consumption deflator. Confidence bands centred on the median and
covering 90% of the forecast distributions are displayed. Each confidence band
corresponds to a probability mass of 5%. The dotted line indicates the mean.
As one can see for both variables, the mean is almost indistinguishable from the
median. This implies that there is at least no apparent sign of asymmetry for the
variables under study.10 The upward shift in the forecast for the consumption
deflator in 2007 is caused by the increase in the VAT rate. This tax rate
increase also leads to a downward shift of GDP growth in 2007.
9 One of the reasons why the original residuals can be autocorrelated is the fact that the
estimation samples can differ from the sample used for bootstrapping. Since every equation of
the Bundesbank model is estimated separately, estimation samples can differ from each other.
The sample used for bootstrapping is the largest common estimation sample.
10 The results would be different for example for the growth rate of the energy component of the
HICP which is strongly asymmetric due to large excise taxes on fuels.

Table 5 shows moments of the stochastic GDP and consumption deflator
forecasts. Skewness is presented for three different types of growth rates: four-
quarter growth rates, quarterly growth rates and annual growth rates. For none
of these growth rates, the coefficient of skewness exceeds 0.1 in absolute
value. Thus, there are no indications of asymmetry for the growth rates of both
variables under study.

For four-quarter and quarterly growth rates, the value for a specific year is

4.2.Asymmetric bootstrap forecasts
In order to investigate the results of asymmetric shocks, we choose to
assume strongly asymmetric shocks for almost all model equations, aiming at
creating strongly positively skewed growth rates of GDP.
Using formula (27), we set Z to 0.3 for all equations of the expenditure
components of GDP. Moreover, we set Z to 0.7 for all price equations. In almost
all other equations, Z is set either to 0.3 or to 0.7, depending on the equation's
initial impact on GDP. If a positive shock in the equation under study is
supposed to increase GDP growth in the short-run, Z is set to 0.3. If such a
shock decreases GDP growth in the short-run, Z is set to 0.7. Due to the
structure of the model, where higher prices dampen demand, this approach can
also be expected to generate negatively skewed growth rates of the
consumption deflator.11 The number of asymmetric shocks amounts to about 80.
Chart 8 shows the forecasts resulting from the asymmetric shocks. The mean
now lies above the median for the GDP forecast and below the median for the
consumer price inflation forecast. However, the differences between mean and
median are very small. Asymmetries of the confidence bands are not too
evident either. Only the outer two confidence bands appear to differ in size.
While the lowest confidence band for GDP seems to be slightly smaller than the
highest one, the lowest confidence band for the consumption deflator appears
somewhat wider than the highest one.
11 Of course, there are several equations where a shock with a positive impact on GDP growth
also has a positive impact on inflation. The wage equation is an example, where a positive
shock temporarily leads to higher GDP growth via higher demand, but also to higher prices
via the production cost channel. With the approach chosen, such an equation would cause
positively skewed inflation. However, one can expect the shocks to the price equations to
dominate the skewness of inflation.

Table 6 displays moments of the stochastic forecasts with asymmetric shocks.
Again, we consider three types of growth rates. It turns out that the means of
the forecasts are not affected by the asymmetry of the shocks. Since the
asymmetry of the shocks does not change their means, this result can be
interpreted as another indication for the almost linear behaviour of real GDP
and consumption deflator growth in the Bundesbank model. The standard
deviations of consumer price inflation also remain unchanged with respect to
the simulation with symmetric shocks. Those of GDP growth, however, increase
by 20 to 40 %. The increase is strongest in the first year and weakest in the
third. While the method used for generating asymmetric shocks leaves their
standard deviations unchanged, the asymmetric shocks are assumed to be
independent. In the case of real GDP growth, ignoring the interdependencies
between the shocks apparently leads to higher volatility.

Real GDP
Consumption Deflator
For four-quarter and quarterly growth rates, the value for a specific year is
calculated as the average quarterly moment observed in that year
The skewness of the variables under study clearly differs from zero. While the
skewness of real GDP growth is positive, consumer price inflation is negatively
skewed. Evidently, the coefficients of skewness depend on the growth rates
used. Annual and four-quarter growth rates exhibit less skewness in absolute
value than quarterly growth rates. The reason is that the former growth rates
strongly depend on the sum of four quarterly shocks, whereas quarterly growth
rates are rather determined by the shocks of a specific quarter.12 For the same
reason, the degree of asymmetry decreases over time. In the third year, due to
the dynamics of the model, shocks from all three years affect the simulation
results, whereas in the first year, only the shocks of the first year matter.
In general, the skewness of aggregates in large interdependent models can
always expected to be considerably smaller than the skewness of the shocks.
This is related to the following property of skewness
12 The sum of several independent equally asymmetric shocks is less asymmetric than the
individual shocks, because the sum approaches normality as stated by the central limit
theorem.

shocks which is the number of asymmetric shocks used in the stochastic
simulation. The skewness of this aggregate would be about 9 times smaller in
absolute value than the skewness of the shocks.
While the skewness of shocks with Z set to 0.3 equals 1.4, the skewness of
GDP growth only equals 0.5 in the first year. Similarly, while the skewness of
shocks with Z set to 0.7 equals ­1.4, the skewness of consumer price inflation
attains only ­0.7 in the first year. These results indicate that a considerable
amount of asymmetry is indeed absorbed in the aggregation and propagation of
the shocks. However, given that the absolute skewness of the TPN distribution
and of the SGN distribution, for example, cannot exceed 1 and 2, respectively,13
the coefficients of skewness observed in the first year can still be regarded as
pronounced at least in absolute terms.
For four-quarter and annual growth rates in the second and third year, the
absolute values of skewness appear relatively small given the large asymmetry
of the shocks.
In order to inspect the nature of the asymmetries in detail, it is interesting to look
at the distribution for a single forecast horizon. Consider the four-quarter growth
rates of real GDP and consumer price inflation in 2007q1. With the asymmetric
stochastic simulations, the former has a skewness of 0.24, and the latter of
­0.24. One would thus expect the densities of both variables to look broadly like
mirror images of each other in this case. With the symmetric simulations, both
coefficients of skewness equal 0.05.
In Chart 9, histograms containing the mentioned growth rates of 2007q1 in their
standardized form, i.e. after mean subtractions and division by their standard
deviations, are displayed. The upper panels contain one histogram for the

simulation with asymmetric shocks and one histogram for the simulation with
symmetric shocks. The lower panels contain the same data as the upper
panels, but here one histogram contains only the growth rates of GDP and the
other only the growth rates of the consumption deflator.
The histogram for the simulation with asymmetric shocks, shown in the upper
left panel, shows that the upward skewed growth rate of GDP has relatively few
moderately positive and extremely negative observations, but relatively many
moderately negative and extremely positive observations. For the consumption
deflator, indeed a mirror image emerges. The histogram in the upper right
panel, displaying the results of the simulation with symmetric shocks, does not
reveal obvious differences between both variables.

Turning to the lower left panel for the comparison of the real GDP growth rates
in the symmetric and asymmetric case, it is striking that differences between
both cases seem to be very small. In the asymmetric case, slightly more
28
29
extremely positive and moderately negative values and slightly less extremely
negative and moderately positive values appear to be observed. In contrast to
that, for consumer price inflation the differences between the asymmetric and
the symmetric case are much larger, especially for moderately positive or
negative observations. This might be explained by the fact that the skewness of
real GDP growth in the asymmetric case increases only by about 0.2 with
respect to the symmetric case, whereas the skewness of consumer price
inflation decreases by about 0.3.
In any case, it seems fair to say that the strong asymmetries of the shocks do
not yield strongly asymmetric four-quarter growth rates in the fifth quarter after
the beginning of the forecast. Since in subsequent periods, asymmetries of the
four-quarter growth rates are generally even less pronounced, it can be
concluded that when focusing on four-quarter growth rates of real GDP and the
consumption deflator, asymmetries are of minor importance in the medium to
long term, even if shocks are strongly asymmetric. The interdependent structure
and transmission mechanisms of the model appear to level out asymmetries to
a large extent.
5. Conclusions
In this work, we have discussed a parametric and a non-parametric
method to quantify risk and uncertainty in macroeconomic forecasts, mainly
focussing on risk quantification. Both methods can be applied such that the
incorporation of asymmetric risk does not affect the mean and variance of the
input variables.
The parametric method is based on a class of asymmetrically weighted normal
distributions. It was shown how this class relates to other asymmetric
distributions and how to consistently aggregate the risks and uncertainty of
input factors with asymmetrically weighted normal distributions in a linear
model. The non-parametric method presented also relies on asymmetric
weights but uses the bootstrap procedure to generate forecast intervals. Both
approaches are closely related and give identical input factors if the model's
residuals are normally distributed. If, in addition, the model's residuals are
independent and the model is linear, both approaches yield identical uncertainty
and risk assessments.
The asymmetric bootstrap is used to generate stochastic forecasts with the
structural macroeconometric model of the Bundesbank for Germany. It turns out
that asymmetries matter for real GDP growth and consumer price inflation
mainly in the short run. In the short run or with quarterly growth rates,
asymmetries of real GDP growth and consumer price inflation can be rather
pronounced if shocks are strongly asymmetric. However, the propagation
mechanisms of the model absorb a substantial share of the shocks'
asymmetries, so that the endogenous variables considered are far less
asymmetric than the shocks. In the medium to long run, asymmetries tend to be
smoothed out at least if four-quarter and annual growth rates are considered.

where Cov(z1

. The question now is how
to construct J1
and J2
, so that 
1
z and 
2
z also have a covariance equal to
Cov(z1

).
In order to achieve this, consider the following table containing joint probabilities
and the unconditional probabilities of the indicator functions J1
and J2
.

For example, the joint probability of J1
= 1 and J2
= 1 equals Z1
Z2
+D. The
unconditional probabilities are independent of the parameter D.
From this setup, it follows that the covariance of 
1
z and 
2
z , denoted as
Cov(

2
z ) is given by

.
Given a joint distribution of z1
and z2
and probabilities Z1
and Z2
, one can thus
try to set D in such a way that Cov( 
1
z , 
2
z ) equals Cov(z1
,z2
).
In order to inspect under which conditions this approach works, it is helpful to
set Z1
equal to Z2
and to use a bivariate standard normal distribution with
correlation coefficient U for z1
and z2
. Since the standard deviations of z1
and z2
equal 1, the correlation is equal to the covariance. Chart A shows the joint
probabilities of J1
= 1 and J2
= 1, J1
= 0 and J2
= 0, and J1
= 1 and J2
= 0. The
latter is identical to the joint probability of J1
= 0 and J2
= 2, because of Z1
= Z2
.
The chart also displays the value of D following from (A.1). Values are shown for
U = 0.5 in the left chart and for U = ­0.5 in the right chart; Z denotes the value of
Z1
and Z2
.
Chart A: Joint probabilities and D
Evidently, there is no problem to replicate the correlation of z1
and z2
if U equals
0.5. D must simply be set to values between 0 and 0.2, depending on the value
of Z. However, if z1
and z2
are negatively correlated, only for certain values of Z
the correlation of z1
and z2
can be replicated for 
1
z and 
2
z . For Z smaller than
34
35
0.4 or larger than 0.6, the joint probabilities of J1
= 1 and J2
= 1, and J1
= 0 and
J2
= 0 implied by the value of D become negative. Experimenting with other
values of U leads to the conclusion that the more negatively z1
and z2
are
correlated, the closer Z has to be to 0.5 in order to be able to replicate this
negative correlation with 
1
z and 
2
z . If Z1
and Z2
are allowed to differ from each
other and z1
and z2
are positively correlated, this can lead to the same problem,
especially if the correlation of z1
and z2
as well as the difference between Z1
and Z2
are large.
