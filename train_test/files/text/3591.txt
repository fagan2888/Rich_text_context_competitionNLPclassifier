Community is being together and opening to spaces. Students
like the ideas of openings if they look beyond the closed space.
--Maxine Greene, personal communication, March 2013
It was Day 2 of the dance activity. The ARtS (Aesthetic,
Reflexive thoughts, & Sharing) initiative team, comprised
of teaching artists, teachers, and university faculty, asked
children to articulate the ways in which group dancing was
related to our ongoing discussion on active citizenship.
During the poetry, clay art, and dance activities so far, chil-
dren have imagined and conceptualized the meaning of
"open" community with the same eagerness Greene high-
lights in the above excerpt, stressing the importance of cre-
ating possibilities outside of a typical closed, exclusive
community. Although children seemed to be exhausted
after practicing gestures, they soon enthusiastically par-
ticipated in dance activities that were meant to represent
who they are and their concepts of active citizenship and
community. Children made connections between group
dances and active citizenship by underscoring their open,
inclusive components--that is, looking at community in a
different way by challenging any closed understanding
of it (Greene, 1995). For example, Daniella said, "Group
dancing is related to active citizenship because everyone is
working as a group in a community. If we mess up, then
somebody might correct you nicely." Isabelle responded to
Daniella's elaboration about active citizenship by employ-
ing the metaphor of a street dance to express her own con-
ception of the term. Isabelle mentioned, "Group dancing is
active citizenship . . . you are like being active when you
are dancing and maybe if there is a street dance, the whole
street is hosting a dance, then you could join in." Isabelle's
metaphor of group dancing as active citizenship was cre-
ative and engaging. She hoped that anyone could join in
the community as an active citizen regardless of his or her
cultural background. Isabelle's metaphor of community as
"a street dance" opened up space for participation in the
community's urgent issues without remaining within
already-restricted borders or being aware of existing
limitations.

The ARtS Community Without
Community: Imagining Aesthetic
Curriculum for Active Citizenship
Seungho Moon1
Abstract
This article is about teaching art-based inquiry and equity pedagogy. The author introduces an aesthetic-inspired afterschool
curriculum in the urban context in the United States and theorizes the meaning of active citizenship and community.
Conceptually framed by "community without community," this article explicates the ways in which the ARtS children
(Aesthetic, Reflexive thoughts, & Sharing) investigated the meanings of community through dance, poetry, and clay art. The
author imagines and theorizes community that goes beyond emphasizing solidarity and a collective "we"-ness in the pursuit
of social transformation. Rather, the author argues that "community without community" could be an important framework
to revisit children's exploration of community, self-other, and active citizenship. The ARtS initiative opens up the possibility
of valuing diverse epistemologies and calls for releasing the imagination for a different community. Most notably, the notion of
community without community leaves open the possibility of reconceptualizing existing community and its vision for creating
new communities always open to possibilities.

"Community" and Active Citizenship:
Where Our Conversation Begins
This article focuses on teaching art-based inquiry and equity
pedagogy. The ARtS initiative is an aesthetic-infused after-
school curriculum that goes beyond increasing artistic skills
to foster student sharing of individual lived experience in the
community. Pedagogically, theARtS initiative team intended
to promote children's imagination and to allow them to see
the world in new ways. This openness toward possibility is a
means to release the social imagination, conceivable only if
children are open to new ideas and are willing to revisit and
share their existing values (Greene, 1995). The team of
teaching artists, classroom teachers, and professors cre-
atively imparted the difficult concept of active citizenship to
children through the use of vivid metaphors, personal experi-
ence in making clay art, and bodily movement in small and
large group activities during a 9-week afterschool program.
In imagining different versions of community, I apply the
notion of "community without community" (Derrida, 1997;
Nancy, 1991) in revisiting the ARtS children's exploration of
community, self-other, and active citizenship. The overarch-
ing question is, what possibilities exist in the field of multi-
culturalism when I, as a researcher, apply poststructuralist
theories while analyzing children's experiences during the
ARtS initiative? Mainstream multicultural education prac-
tices favor a universalized, collective voice that ironically
excludes other important voices within the group. I decon-
struct the meanings of community and solidarity by reflect-
ing on salient learning moments. I explore the possibility of
imagining community that moves beyond emphasizing soli-
darity and a collective "we"-ness in the pursuit of social
transformation.
Conceptual Framework: Community
Without Community
The ARtS initiative aims to support the existing school com-
munities' efforts to establish a much healthier community. I
conceptualize a community without community as one that
underscores the importance of imagining the multiplicities of
communities that cannot be universalized by existing cul-
tural norms, or by predetermined notions of cultural same-
ness and difference (Derrida, 1997, Nancy, 1991). My
theorization of "community without community" stems from
Derrida's (1997) elaboration of proleptic eschatology--that
is, challenging a linear, chronicle understanding of the past,
present, and future and anticipating its integral relationship
among these three parts of time in order to create a space
with eternally open-ended possibilities. In his book The
Politics of Friendship, Jacques Derrida calls for a "commu-
nity without community of thinkers to come" (p. 62). He
develops this idea of community without community with an
analogy of friendship politics. Conventionally, "good"
friendship derives from a certain form of intimacy among
friends; these friends supporting each other because of their
established genuine intimacy. Derrida, on the other hand,
argues that actual and genuine intimacy of friendship is
intangible, and the singularities between two friends are per-
mutated without predictable, stable anticipation. The notion
of "good" friendship is deferred in that relationship and is
not predetermined before these interactions have happened.
According to Derrida, friendship (or enmity) operates inter-
dependently and "letting the other come" for friendship is
perhaps possible "only if the other precedes and informs
me--only if the other is the condition of my immanence" (p.
42). The predetermined understanding of friends (or enmi-
ties) becomes dangerously unstable in that good friendship
does not operate by encouraging a typical understanding of a
true friendship. Derrida paradoxically articulates that "the
friends of truth are not in the truth" (p. 43). He continues, it
is not true friendship if friends are "installed there as in the
padlocked security of a dogma and the stable reliability of an
opinion" (p. 43). Due to its danger of establishing "true"
friendship with a dogma or stable prediction, the apex of
"good friendship" is never reached, nor can its definition be
confined within a monolithic, universal meaning. Rather, the
meaning of "friendship" is always deliberately withheld and
delayed because actual interactions between friends, operat-
ing within a very particular sociocultural context, influence
the very construction of such unpredictable meanings.
Furthermore, in the articulation of "to-come," Derrida
explicates the notion of community yet to come [à venir]. In
different writings, Derrida (2005) uses the term of "yet to
come," such as "democracy yet to come" (p. 62). This pro-
leptic component of hope resides in his expression of democ-
racy as never existing as its current existing form; rather,
democracy always remains aporias in its structure--aporias
of uncertainty and mismatches between language and its
meaning. In other words, the democracy we experience is not
yet democracy at all because it exists as a futuristic "future"
hope relating from desire in the present. No fixed meaning is
possible due to democracy's apophatic characteristics.
Similar to the elaboration on democracy yet to come, Derrida
imagines the ontological meaning of community without
closing its "is-ness" within a fixed format. Thus, community
without community imagines a community yet to come with-
out normalizing it within the existing community (Derrida,
1997). As democracy exists only by differing its meaning
from a universalized definition of it, so does community in a
structure that community itself is kept open "to the yet to
come" (Rebentisch, 2005, p. 929).
Indeed, community without community is paradoxical
and confusing. How can a community exist if it does not pre-
sume its essential existence? In what ways does a community
possibly exist, if any, when ontological negativism precludes
the being of community? Despite this ontological paradox, I
elaborate upon this concept as a means to examine "open"
spaces for creating community with unimagined possibili-
ties. I interpret taken-for-granted-ness about community and
Moon 3
citizens'roles in the community while reflecting on the ARtS
activities. What are the epistemology and practical implica-
tions of community without community in current multicul-
tural discourses? This question originates from ontological
concerns about current practice in mainstream multicultural-
ism drawn from establishing collective solidarity and nor-
malizing identity within the predetermined community. A
cultural group cohesively advocates for its political rights,
yet it ostracizes the "other" within the group that does not
follow a set of existing social norms. Butler (1999), for
example, argues that a universalized concept of "women"
excludes women of color, the lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans-
gender, and questioning (LGBTQ) community, and those
experiencing ability issues. In this article, I offer two salient
learning moments that emerged throughout my data analysis
in articulating counternarratives about community. Drawing
from children's activities, I theorize the meanings of com-
munity without community that emerged from the ARtS ini-
tiative and outline the resultant implications promoting the
positive advancement of multicultural education discourses.
Methodology
This current article is part of a larger, funded project to exam-
ine children's understanding of active citizenship and com-
munity through the use of art. The ARtS initiative supports
existing learning communities that place an emphasis on art-
based inquiry and the aesthetic experience through an after-
school curriculum. In 2013-2014, 40 fourth to sixth graders
living in underrepresented communities in the United States
participated in poetry, dance, and clay art classes. In 2014-
2015, 20 fourth to sixth graders continued their participation
in this initiative. We implemented the same program in three
instances over the 2 years. Painting was substituted for the
dance component during the second year of implementation.
The participants in this initiative were from two elementary
schools: 100% of the school population from Freedom
Elementary School received reduced/free lunch rates and
84% of the school population were students of color; 98% of
the school population from Independent Elementary School
received free/reduced lunch rates and 52% of the school pop-
ulation were students of color. University professors, teach-
ers from urban schools, and local artists collaborated to
design an innovative afterschool curriculum that explored
active citizenship and children's participation in a commu-
nity. Table 1 indicates cultural backgrounds and major roles
of teaching artists, teachers, and professors during the ARtS
initiative.
The ARtS initiative was a 9-week afterschool program
composed of biweekly sessions (3:30-4:30 p.m. on Tuesday
and Thursday). Each art genre was covered during a 3-week
period. A total of 18 sessions were provided for children, and
the program concluded with a gallery night to display chil-
dren's artwork and to celebrate their achievement with the
community members. In addition, clay artists, poets, paint-
ers, and a dancer participated in 6-hr professional develop-
ment for the ARtS initiatives and collaboratively developed
a curriculum with the support of classroom teachers and uni-
versity professors.
Data Sources and Analysis
The implementation of the ARtS initiative was completed in
June 2015. The project team transcribed the whole class dis-
cussion during the 2013-2014 academic year. The amount of
transcripts for poetry, clay art, and dance classes comprised
156, 130, and 93 pages, respectively. All teaching artists par-
ticipated in a 1-hr interview during the program in order to
reflect on their teaching and children's engagement with the
project. As a project director, I developed and conducted

these semistructured interviews. They were audio-taped and
fully transcribed (60 pages). We also videotaped the gallery
night event in April 2014, an activity that ran for approxi-
mately 2.5 hr. The data sources included the class discus-
sions, student artifacts, semistructured teacher and artist
interviews, and videos from the gallery night and class
activities.
Highly influenced by poststructuralist theories, I gener-
ally do not follow a linear approach to analyze qualitative
data: generating themes, testing emerging hypothesis,
searching for alternative explanations, and then writing a
report (Marshall & Rossman, 2006). Informed by Wolcott's
(2008) qualitative research analytic tools, I instead describe,
analyze, and interpret research participants' discussions,
artifacts, and interview data. With this project, I first ana-
lyzed the written and visual texts that contained the chil-
dren's experiences during the ARtS initiative. Reviewing
children's lived experience formed the core of this analysis.
The frames of investigation included examining children's
experiences when the activities focused on the notions of
community and active citizenship. I inquired about the
nature of the meanings created and interpreted by children
during the activities.
In addition to noting Wolcott's guidance for the data anal-
ysis, I partially adopted research strategies developed by
Corbin and Strauss (2015). I categorized the data, applying
coding procedures in order to examine salient themes regard-
ing children's understanding of active citizenship and com-
munity (Corbin & Strauss, 2015). The children's artifacts
represented the major portion of the analysis, which focused
on their interpretation of these important concepts. Rather
than reference coherent emerging themes to describe what
happened in these children's conceptualization of active citi-
zenship and community, I examined the ways in which data
sources are discursively generated within a specific sociopo-
litical, economic, and historical context, especially during
this afterschool program (Foucault, 1978). I investigated
how power operated, both in data representation and
my interpretation about data. This approach pushed the
boundaries of not only "what is included" but also "what is
not included" in children's and educators' narratives.
Furthermore, I asked myself in what ways were the ARtS
children required to represent their learning and artifacts as
part of their afterschool program. Some children were adept
at "pleasing" educators by sharing knowledge that the educa-
tors expected to hear, including positive elements focused on
community and personal actions that would change a com-
munity. Pitt and Britzman (2003) write, "[w]hile a narrative
is made from a specific context, the affective force of what
precisely is represented in narrative may derive from other
scenes and from unresolved psychical conflicts" (p. 759). By
accepting Pitt and Britzman's methodological concerns, I
acknowledged the possibility of psychological conflicts that
the ARtS children might experience throughout the after-
school program and data analysis.
During the data analysis, I coded initial concepts that the
children used to share their ideas about active citizenship and
community. Coding (Corbin & Strauss, 2015) and "thematic
analysis" (Riessmann, 2008) of brief, bound segments of
children's artifacts, discussion notes, and interview data
were sources necessary to review data and to organize famil-
iar unfamiliar data. Delineated concepts encompassed (a)
children's notions of active citizenship, (b) understanding of
community, (c) urgent issues in the community, and (d)
actions that children take. Table 2 shows major themes gen-
erated through data analysis.
Among these four major themes of (a) children's meta-
phors of active citizenship and community, (b) understand-
ing of community, (c) urgent issues in the community, and
(d) actions that children take, this article mainly focuses on
the second theme, "understanding of community." This
theme demonstrates the complexity of community dis-
cussed by children and educators. I selected the stories and
examples narrating the issue of "community" from multi-
ple perspectives. Grounded in the narratives, I include
more discussion of the theory, outcomes, and my reflec-
tions on the children's lived experiences in their own com-
munities and actual class discussions about the issue of
community. During the data analysis process, I recognized
my subjectivity embedded in categorizing salient themes. I
challenged myself during the data analysis in order to
rethink any foregone conclusions about the "proper" or
"romantic" way of understanding community and teaching
this concept to children. I narrated children's engagement
and/or disengagement with community, anchored in the
conceptual framework of community without community.
Thus, I analyzed and represented two vignettes of rethink-
ing community highlighted during the ARtS activities: (a)
community of interrelationality and (b) multiplicities of
community.
Two vignettes represent the ways in which children dis-
mantle preexisting notions of citizenship and active citizen-
ship,drawingfromcreativeideasandtheirownunderstanding
of community. Many potentially meaningful discourses were
also generated during the project regarding leadership, loss
and mourning, and collaboration with the community.
Paralleled with class engagement in the process of data anal-
ysis, I focused on two vignettes which provided circum-
stances that aided both the production and the interpretation
of ethnographic and narrative data (Riessmann, 2008). All
the names appearing in this article are pseudonyms, and I
also collected informed consents from children's parents/
guardians and from all adults. Overall, by examining chil-
dren's very specific learning moments to imagine different
approaches to community, this article examines the ways in
which children develop their views on active citizenship and
community. In the next section, I describe and analyze two
salient teaching-learning moments during which children
were active in learning and demonstrated their concepts of
active citizenship and community.

Vignettes of Rethinking Community 1:
Community of Interrelationality
The ARtS team discussed the importance of community
leadership by introducing citizenship and civic engagement
in a community. Dance activities played major roles in artic-
ulating leadership and community. Most discussions during
the activity reiterated a conventional approach to leadership:
that is, a leader has a vision and community members follow
his or her guidance, although conventionally people high-
light "shared" leadership for those decisions that involve dis-
tribution or allocation of resources. Unexpectedly, an
interesting conversation emerged during the leader­follower
activity and the subsequent shared reflection. The ARtS chil-
dren and the team examined a complicated meaning of
leader­follower during the activity. We challenged the
leader­follower relationship as a predetermined concept
when understanding different roles in a community. Below is
a brief overview of the activity.
Angie, the dancer, grouped children in pairs and told them
to decide who would lead movement. Then, the "leader"
started gestures describing what leadership in a community
would look like. The basic rule was to be quiet when each
person initiated and the other person followed the gestures.
After listening to this guidance, the two children in each group
looked at each other and one child slowly initiated a gesture
and the partner followed the movement. Each child took turns
to invent and follow the movements. After the activity, the
children and teachers exchanged their reflections, an exercise
that exposed the children to a different version of leadership­
followership. Having indicated the leader and the follower in
each group, Peggy, a classroom teacher, reported what chil-
dren in her group shared concerning an outstanding insight
about the leader­follower relationship. A child in her group
discussed the notion that no leader existed in this activity.
Ms. Angie: The leaders! Did you guys notice if you move
too fast then the person who's following steps behind?
Ms. Peggy: They told us there's no leader . . . It is hysteri-
cal because we learn together where we're going . . .
It's actually a lot of fun where you stand and no one is
leading. You do it as a group. You feel like you're con-
necting with the person standing in front of you.
Ms. Angie: I see. Did you hear what Ms. Peggy said?
When you really get to do this, and you're really doing
it correctly, and the signal is so clear: There is no leader
any more. You give up control to be part of a group . .
. When it works really well, you can't tell who the
leader is . . . because if the follower doesn't follow, the
leader stops leading, and then the leader starts follow-
ing the person.
Eva: When I was doing this . . . I felt like I knew what she
was going to do next . . . so I was like, following she
was doing something next.

"Community is like a mood ring. There are broken mood rings
because there are people who have no money but the pink
mood ring can help if people love to show love to others. When
you are angry, you can help, calm them down and make them
happy" (fifth grader).
Understanding of

Ms. Foster (teacher): "For me community is a safe place where
you feel safe, where you can take risks, all of these other things
too, but in addition, like a place where you feel comfortable."
Angel (fifth grader): "What if your community is not safe?"
Urgent issues in

Bullying issues; cyberbullying; lack of

"[The bully] was kind of racist like, `You shouldn't be going to this
school any more. This is only for the White and Black' . . . and
we [Hispanics] were like, `We have this freedom, too. If you
have read history books, you should have known that Hispanics
have freedom, too. And the White people and the Black people
have the same freedom'" (fifth grader).
Actions for the
community
Requesting more police; supporting
friends, helping each other; celebrating
differences; openness to others;
standing up for yourself and others;
solving problems together; taking a risk
"Sometimes when you're being an active citizen, you may be
standing up for something or helping in a way where it's the
minority, and not the majority . . . Were there some good things
about being an active citizen? But then there can be some things
that might be a little bit scary or even seems challenging" (a
poet).
6 SAGE Open
The above conversation among the dancer, classroom
teacher, and a student illustrates the blurred boundaries that
exist between leader­follower while taking actions and fol-
lowing directions. While a space exists between these con-
cepts, the division between leader and follower is conflated
through taking actions and achieving close connectivity
between the "two" parties. No leader exists without the fol-
lower, and vice versa. Even the border between leader and
follower disappears when the leader does not have to con-
trol the others out of self-interest. This leader­follower
movement provided the insight that the bifurcation or hier-
archy of leader­follower is irrelevant when each person
feels connected. No control is necessary when two suppos-
edly different parties merge as one. As Angie indicated, this
is the point when the leader stops leading, yet continues to
collaborate with other people. Shared leadership goes
beyond distributing different leadership roles in the com-
munity. Rather, the community members consider the
importance of active collaboration without requiring con-
trol, guaranteeing that no vertical hierarchy exists in creat-
ing a supportive community.
Vignettes of Rethinking Community 2:
Multiplicities of Community
During the ARtS initiative, the team learned that it was of
benefit to children to address the safety issues of living in a
challenging community. Most of the class discussions
focused on maintaining a safe community by illustrating the
positive aspects of sustaining a caring, safe, and healthy
community. The grand narrative during the activity seemed
to support an equity-oriented, multicultural curriculum that
encourages children to enhance their critical consciousness
for addressing injustices and inequities in their community
(Murray & Milner, 2015).Although I valued awakening chil-
dren's consciousness toward social inequity and safety, I
hoped to encourage children to think beyond a romanticized
notion of community, such as simply "helping each other" or
"keeping our community health." The poetry class provided
students with a seminal moment in which to examine the
space between safe and unsafe while acknowledging the vio-
lence and danger existing within their own community.
Children were realistic about violence and safety issues in
their community, and the team used this aesthetic-inspired
afterschool curriculum to discuss these issues within a safe,
supportive environment.
During the poetry activities, the ARtS team maximized
the brainstorming process by having children imagine mul-
tiple metaphors for representing active citizenship. Children
wrote poetry and shared their ideas about community and
active citizenship. They used magazines to imagine and
visually express what active citizenship looks like in a
collage format, before completing an individual poem for
the gallery night. On Day 1 of the poetry activity, a poet
invited children to share what images they visualized when
pondering the concept of community. The poetry teacher
encouraged children to start from a notion of friendship as
the beginning of the deeper conversation on community. A
poet and classroom teacher, Chris, used the following
example: "I usually think of friendship as two halves of a
whole. So, sometimes I think about twins, or conjoining
people . . . I just see friendship as being connected."
Children designed their name tags by using the images of a
heart, a tree, a dog, a puzzle, a rainbow, and other objects to
display their notions of friendship.
Creating a name tag was an opening exercise in order to
practice metaphors in representing community with the use
of poetry. Children were asked to interpret their chosen
image of friendship and specifically describe how it concep-
tualized their notions of community. Tim, for example, con-
nected the image of a tree and its leaves with citizens,
explaining that the leaves are like active members in a com-
munity. Another fourth grader, Keith, also used a tree meta-
phor to emphasize that friendship which lasts forever is
reminiscent of an evergreen tree. After the name tag activity,
the team asked the children to think about the core question:
"What does community mean to me?" Below is a brief
excerpt from the class discussion:
Ms. Foster (a poetry teacher): What is the definition of
community to you?
Daniella: Like a bunch of people come together to make a
big town . . .
Isabelle: A community to me is like when people are
working together and actually making something.
Ms. Foster: Anybody else? For me community is a safe
place where you feel safe, where you can take risks, all
of these other things too, but in addition, like a place
where you feel comfortable.
During the ARtS initiative, the team had time to share the
idea of creating a much safer community in both schools
and neighborhoods. While discussing the notion of commu-
nity, educators have a tendency to imagine a romantic com-
munity that emphasizes collaboration and a supportive
environment. However, the direction was shifted when
Angel, a fifth grader, raised the issue of an "unsafe" envi-
ronment in her neighborhood.
Angel: What if your community is not safe?
Ms. Foster: What if your community is not safe . . .
Dr. Letters (a professor): That is a great question. What if
your community is not safe?
Angel: I have experience, I got chased by pit bulls.
Isabelle: Somebody shot a house.
Ms. Foster: In your community?
Isabelle: Yeah, it was my house, then another house, then
it was the street lamp near the house.
Ms. Foster: Some people shot at it?
Isabelle: Yeah, it's pretty dangerous.
Moon 7
Dannie: And what else you could do is that if there was
something dangerous like a fire, you could call the
police or 911.
Isabelle: And then you would help your community . . .
Ms. Foster: So, there are lots of people that can help out in
a community too when a community isn't necessarily
safe, right?
The ARtS children delved into the multiple aspects of
community through the various activities. Children raised
their concerns about their own neighborhood's experience of
violence, safety, and lack of police presence. Angel's real
concern about the "unsafe" community made the conversa-
tion multifaceted and authentic. Her question "what if our
community is not safe?" was supported by the poet and the
professor, who shifted the class discussion to explore safety
issues in the children's own communities.
As the poetry activities continued, the ARtS children
shared their experiences of their school community, which
included a cyberbullying issue. Included below is the tran-
script of the part of the class discussion when children
described taking a risk in their community and its costs in
order to sustain a healthy community:
Joan: Like this year, there was a situation like cyber-bully-
ing in our classroom. I was included like a suspect and
three other people were suspects. It was like a cyber-
bullying on Facebook.Anthony [pseudonym] was cyber-
bullying about [racism] . . . He was going to be telling
about us . . . , "You shouldn't be going to this school any
more. This is only for the White and Black" . . . [Oh . . .]
and we [Hispanics] were like, "We have this freedom,
too. If you have read history books, you should have
known that Hispanics have freedom, too. And the White
people and the Black people have the same freedom."
Dr. Letters: Everybody has the equal right, no matter what
skin color you have.
Beth: I can't stand, when people get judged, because
they're White or they're Black, or like it doesn't really
matter if you're White or Black. Sometimes kids get
judged because they don't have a phone, or their par-
ents don't have much money, or they don't have a
Facebook [page] . . .
Dr. Letters: I wonder what we can do, when so many bad
things happen in our community.
Daniella: Yeah, I was related to when people are cyber-
bullied. When someone gets bullied right in front of
you, some people you just don't want to listen because
you feel like bad about not wanting to leave anybody
who is still getting bullied . . .
Addressing the bullying particularly cyberbullying is cru-
cial in order to gauge children's experience in schools and
the community. The poet, Foster, connects this issue with the
discussion of active citizenship and our action plans for
creating a safe environment. When the idea of community
becomes vague and idealistic, as in "a place where citizens
feel comfortable," it is important to explore the subtle border
between safe and unsafe, just as Angel did when she shared
her daily experiences in her own community. Angel wanted
to explore how her community is neither absolutely safe nor
unsafe. Rather, the community is a space and place where
Angel and other children endeavor every day to feel at ease.
Similarly, as the above brief conversation indicates, cyber-
bullying becomes an urgent issue for children when such
bullying is racially motivated in a racially and ethnically
diverse community. Using media input and actual conversa-
tions in schools, children can politically and discursively
construct their personal understandings of what it means to
inhabit a liminal space that is both safe and unsafe.
Angel's curiosity, Joan's concern with cyberbullying, and
the ARtS team's elaboration on the safety issue provided an
opportunity to review the meaning of community without
community. The poetry activity followed by sharing chil-
dren's ideas became a launching pad for the children to chal-
lenge a normalized approach to safe­unsafe community,
which has been particularly assigned to them by mainstream
media using the term "urban" school to assuage fear of living
within a city. The term of "urban school," thus, is normalized
by applying a populational reasoning to associate "urban"
with an unsafe and dangerous community (Popkewitz, 1998).
The idea of community without community avoids such ste-
reotypical understanding about community. For example, the
ARtS team challenges the normalized understanding of
"urban" community with the use of the safe­unsafe dichot-
omy. Multicultural educators encounter a plethora of issues
when attempting to promote social justice and deal with
safety issues in the community. While working on these
social justice issues, I argue that they should challenge any
normalized understanding of "urban" that reinforces nega-
tive stereotypical images about children living in an under-
resourced community. At the same time, educators should
consider creating an emotionally, intellectually, and spiritu-
ally "safe" environment when articulating the notion of com-
munity and active citizenship within the community. Drawing
from the notion of community without community, I argue
for creating an in-between space of safety­unsafety that
challenges a generalized understanding of an urban area as
an "unsafe" place. In-between is the space where children
actually imagine a different aspect of community, both over-
coming a negative image about "urban" community and rec-
ognizing the multiplicity of community as an ongoing
process of creating a healthier environment.
Community Without Community:
Where Our Conversation Is to Come
Reflecting on children's counternarratives, I further develop
the notion of community without community. Rather than
pursue the right answer, this community without community
8 SAGE Open
aims to invoke more questions about the purpose of collabo-
ration, the practice of democratic values, and pursuit of
education advancement. Most notably, I emphasize the inter-
relationality of self­other and the multiplicities of commu-
nity in theorizing about community without community.
I introduced Derrida's notion of community without com-
munity as a theoretical foregrounding for this article. I elabo-
rate on this notion by drawing from other philosophers and
discourse concerning politics. For example, in his book The
Inoperative Community, Nancy (1991) articulates the notion
of community without community, clearly highly influenced
by Derrida's ideas. He states,
Community without community is to come, in the sense that it is
always coming, endlessly, at the heart of every collectivity . . . It
is no more than this: to come to the limit of compearance, to that
limit to which we are in effect convoked, called, and sent . . . Its
essence is composed only in the act that interrupts, with a single
stroke--by an incision and/or an inscription--the shaping of the
scene of myth (pp. 71-72, emphasis in original).
In this excerpt, Nancy (1991) underscores that commu-
nity does not exist in the predetermined form of a common
being. Rather, community exists as a provisionary form--a
form that resides "at the limit of the other" where the subjects
pivot over one another (p. 76). Drawing from Derridian con-
cepts, Nancy eloquently articulates this provisional and dif-
férance aspect of community. He said, "we communicate to
each other not the meaning of community, but an infinite
reserve of common and singular meanings" (p. 79, emphasis
in original). Community is important not because we create
solidarity within the community but because of its eternal
openness through not creating a universal agreement. This
open-ended, provisional element of community opens up
discussion about subjectivity within the group. Like Nancy, I
challenge the danger of universalized solidarity and public
uniting that highlights collective, monolithic identity without
considering the multiplicity of community and community
members. While underscoring community as a "common"
entity, multicultural educators have a tendency to close the
possibility to imagine multiple meanings of community and
thus limit political actions responding to diverse needs within
the community.
Nancy's argument about community is often cited by
other theorists, including Devadas and Mummery. In their
article "Community Without Community," Devadas and
Mummery (2007) provide an overview of this concept,
mainly drawing from Nancy. They argue that traditional
understanding of community, which is a romanticized view
of community, "reproduces a collectivity that is built upon,
engenders and fosters a sense of closure, continuity, unity
and universalism" (p. 1). In the critical theory tradition, soli-
darity among the "underprivileged" is considered to be a pre-
requisite in the fight against social injustice toward the
"oppressed" group. Devadas and Mummery explicate the
potential violence of an exclusionary community, borrowing
from Nancy's notion of community without unity. An exclu-
sion/inclusion version of community normalizes its citizen-
ship and ostracizes a community member who does not
follow such a set of social norms. They reject a community
with exclusionary solidarity, yet propose "an alternative con-
cept of community that produces new constitutions and net-
works of relationships that are not hinged upon predisposed
notions of community and identity" (p. 2). Now new ques-
tions emerge regarding this ontological confusion. How can
the community without essence (the community that is nei-
ther "people" nor "nation," . . . etc.) be presented as such?
That is, what might the politics be that does not stem from
the will to realize this essence? These questions are crucial
starting points from which to rethink humanistic, enlighten-
ment versions of identity and community.
Other philosophers and educators have participated in
similar epistemological approaches to articulate community
from multiple angles. By using the concepts of "community
without consensus" and "community with dissensus," Miller
(2010) and Rancière (2011), respectively, emphasize the mul-
tiplicity of community and the impossibility of creating a uni-
versalized community. Drawing from a feminist,
poststructuralist tradition, Miller argues for a community that
"possibly enables representations of self, other, and the [edu-
cational] field to be unfixed, mobilized, destabilized, and
released as forces capable of recombining in as yet unimag-
ined and perhaps untraceable ways" (Miller, 2010, pp.
99-100). Communities without consensus are always in-the-
making, where any boundaries are reconceived as contingent
and yet intricately intertwined (Miller, 2010). When the soli-
darity of stable, collective community is mainly highlighted
in the discussion of equity and diversity, Miller and other
poststructuralists endeavor to minimize any normalized vio-
lence by universalizing cultural identity in a collective man-
ner and ignoring the multiplicity of identities that constitute a
community member. Similarly, in his article "The Thinking
of Dissensus: Politics and Aesthetics," Rancière (2011) con-
ceptualizes "dissensus" as political, aesthetic discourse.
Namely, politics cannot be reduced to a collective, essential-
ized version of community. "Community with dissensus" cre-
ates a space for making "a difference within the same, a
sameness of the opposite" (p. 1). Similarly, Gere (2012) uti-
lizes the notion of community without community by high-
lighting a new community and relationality brought in by
technology of the digital age. In his book Community Without
Community in Digital Culture, Gere paradoxically under-
scores the situation that technologies "effect non-relation-
ships, and non-communities, community without community"
(p. 1). This idea dismisses an overarching, grand framework
that connects community members. Gere's argument is con-
sistent with my articulation of community without commu-
nity, although I do not apply it to digital technology, per se.
By subscribing to these notions of community without
consensus and community with dissensus, I theorize
Moon 9
communities without communities as those in which multi-
cultural educators challenge universalized "solidarity" in
order to open up in-between spaces for imagining "unex-
plored" possibilities about self, other, and the community.
My support of a "just" community stems from recognizing
the value of community without community in that it gener-
ously emphasizes the multiplicities of community and
diverse voices within a given community without bias. The
"emancipation" project from mainstream multiculturalism
unintentionally and unconsciously creates exclusivism in the
pursuit of social justice. Group solidarity, ironically, gener-
ates exclusionism of community, although such collective-
ness is a prerequisite for taking actions. Yet I argue that blind
solidarity is problematic in that it normalizes membership
and belonging. Furthermore, the absolute duty of a citizen is
to inflict violence upon the "Other"--which causes unethical
consequences in terms of fairness and justice. Because of
this potential problem of solidarity, poststructuralist theories
pay attention to subject construction as the effect of political,
active interactions among people. This new idea about inter-
relationality further encourages us to imagine community
that goes beyond, "already constituted communities, already
established subjects" (Butler, 2009, p. 31). New epistemo-
logical groundings invite us to rethink the concepts of "closed
community" and "solidarity in the pursuit of justice" and the
creation of a new community.
The two themes articulated in this article indicate the pos-
sibility of exploring "openness" in a community in which
any binary opposition is not sufficient to fight against social
injustice and create a "safe" community. The leader­follower
activity shows the ways in which children rethink the bifur-
cated notion of leader­follower. The blurred division
between the leader­follower in the activity emphasizes that
roles and responsibilities are operated by a power operation
occurring between the leader­follower. No singular, univer-
sal, or agreed-upon notions of selves, collectivity, or solidar-
ity exist. Nor does stable subjectivity exist before the subjects
interact with each other; instead, the self­other or leader­
follower relation is linguistically and materially constructed
within the proximity of self and other where power operates
through multiple directions, depending on a very specific
sociopolitical context (Todd, 2009). This structure is not pre-
determined but it is constantly evolving, depending on spe-
cific circumstances of the community. No dichotomous
understanding is possible in understanding self­other or
leader­follower.
Similarly,Angel's crucial concern "what if our community
is not safe?" initiated an important issue in sustaining a "safe"
environment in an urban context while minimizing any ste-
reotypical images discursively generated by urban/suburban
and unsafe/safe dichotomies. Community without commu-
nity requests examine the power operation in articulating
such division and imagine the subjectivity and community
from these in-between spaces that cannot be essentialized
or normalized with the use of any dichotomous terms. By
raising the concept of community without community, I
argue for creating an open space of "safe" community where
educators challenge existing normalized practice of urban
education, particularly informed by this "unsafe" rhetoric.
Community without community is theoretically and peda-
gogically in-the-making by highlighting interrelationality
among the subjects rather than imposing existing, normalized
understandings of "urban" community upon them. Overall,
the notion of community without community is a sociopoliti-
cal and discursive endeavor that can be used to create an
emotionally, intellectually, and spiritually "safe" environment
and encourage children to imagine an "open" space while
looking beyond any closed space (Greene, 1995).
Toward Community Without
Community and Social Transformation
According to critical ethnography tradition, making the dis-
tinction between the "haves and have nots" or "leader and
follower" is imperative in order to combat social injustice in
a racialized, classed, gendered, abled, and sexualized society.
The rhetoric of emancipation argues that power should be
shared within a community and that shared leadership is a
meaningful democratic practice in decision making. In con-
ceptualizing the open-ness of community without commu-
nity, Butler's (2009) challenge to current multiculturalism
discourse is pertinent. Central to Butler's theory of recogni-
tion is the claim that war and globalization construct a dif-
ferential apprehension and recognition of life. She calls for
interrogating the "frames" of recognition as an urgent task:
"The problem is not merely how to include more people
within existing norms, but to consider how existing norms
allocate recognition differentially" (p. 6). What to put "in" or
"outside" the frame is not the major concern. Rather, what
matters is to investigate a very specific frame in order to
make visible the rationale for recognizing a subject as griev-
able or not, although the subject lost his or her life (Butler,
2009). She also emphasizes analyzing social norms because
subjects are discursively constructed within and through a
set of social norms. Butler (2015) conceptualizes the notion
of "subject" from a different ontology. No subject exists with
a free will without actual interactions with others. It is inter-
relationality among subjects that constructs self and other. In
her book Senses of the Subject, Butler (2015) argues,
I do not arrive in the world separate from a set of norms that are
lying in wait for me, already orchestrating my gender, race, and
status, working on me, even as a pure potential, prior to my first
wail. So norms, conventions, institutional forms of power, are
already acting prior to any action I may undertake, prior to there
being an "I" who thinks of itself from time to time as the seat or
source of our actions (p. 6).
According to Butler, identity is not the collection of an
autonomous individual's choice and conscious performance
10 SAGE Open
in front of other people. Rather, Butler highlights a set of
social norms that constructs the subject by reiterating such
norms constantly. The subject is not an agent with free will;
rather, power-knowledge operating within a community dis-
cursively constructs gender identity. Similar to Butler, Todd
(2009) challenges existing understanding about cultural self
and other without considering the discursive interactions
among the subjects and its consequences for the subjectivity
construction. Drawing from Levinas's notion of human and
humanity, Todd theorizes humanity that occurs as the conse-
quence of interactions. Humanity is not a predetermined
ideal or a virtue of a shared value in humanity. Rather,
humanity is "located in the proximity where self and other
meet" impacted by the threat of violence (p. 19). Exploring
the power operation between self and other as well as the
explication of specific sociopolitical, economic contexts
becomes the crucial point for understanding supposedly dif-
ferent roles and power structures in a community. According
to Butler (2015) and Todd (2009), actual interactions among
the subjects construct the very meaning of self­other, rather
than imposing predetermined meanings on cultural sameness
and difference.
Using feminist politics as an example, Butler (1999) asks,
"To what extent does the effort to locate a common identity
as the foundation for a feminist politics preclude a radical
inquiry into the political construction and regulation of iden-
tity itself?" (p. xxxii). In this context, Butler is concerned
with how feminist politics based on heterosexual normalcy
hinders an open-ended search for a "politics of recognition"
(Lloyd, 2005, p. 143)--which is, finding ways in which all
citizens are recognized as equal to all others. Butler (2004)
continues to challenge the single epistemological approach
to gender that predominantly exists in identity politics,
including an emphasis on "women's ways" of knowing,
thinking, or behaving. She argues that these notions of
women are already "orchestrated by power precisely at that
moment in which the terms of `acceptable'categorization are
instituted" (p. 215). In other words, the very ideas of wom-
en's ways of knowing, thinking, or behaving are constructed
by power and historical discourses.
Informed by Butler's (1999, 2004) argument for against a
normalized version of identity politics, I revisit the commu-
nal effort to universalize collective cultural identity, or what
Dolby (2000) labeled as "blind identity politics" (p. 909).
Educators mainly influenced by identity politics assume
seamless "we-ness" among a specific cultural group (e.g.,
ethnicity/race, gender, and class) before considering its dis-
cursive and political constructions of identities (Moon,
2011). Community without community encourages multicul-
tural educators to examine the ways in which such concepts
as race, gender, or class are discursively circulated, repro-
duced, and changed with/in specific sociopolitical, cultural,
economic, and historical contexts. The point is that educators
need to explicate the ways in which such identity categories
are discursively naturalized within a community. I challenge
the coherence of the categories, or collective "we-ness" of a
community with unanimous voice, in order to minimize any
normalization of people. The recognition of diverse voices
within a community is a project of creating new vocabulary
to specifically articulate what we mean by "we" in fighting
against social injustice (Moon, 2011).
The ARtS Community Without
Community: Questions for Further
Inquiry
I utilized the concept of community without community as a
means to rethink a potential problem of solidarity in defining
"normative" community without considering the "Other"
within the community. A normative version of community
reproduces "violence" that applies the binary of "us and them"
if the subject does not reiterate norms given to him or her.
Rather than confining identity within normative categories, I
argue for community without community that underscores the
interrelationality of self­other in considering cultural identity
and its construction within a sociopolitical context. The learn-
ing moments illustrated in this article addressed the complex-
ity of leader­follower and safe­unsafe issues.
I raise questions about the notions of community, solidar-
ity, and collective identity in order to explore multiple aspects
of community and active citizenship within the community. I
explicate children's rethinking about their community draw-
ing from their experience. There is no taken-for-grantedness
in this learning and experimental space: Children revisit,
rethink, and always reconsider their habitual ways of think-
ing about a community and their roles in the community.
Rather than affirming community with solidarity, commu-
nity without community challenges the current practices in
multiculturalism--multiculturalism that normalizes cultural
identity with the use of collective "we"-ness and provides
little space for examining a specific sociocultural, political,
and economic context in subjectivity construction. The labels
of "marginalized," "at-risk," or "underrepresented" are polit-
ical, strategic terms to fight against social oppressions recur-
ring historically toward people of color, women, and the
poor. Yet the request to think of the ARtS initiative as a
"community without community" shifts the major discourse
in multicultural education. It challenges the reproduction of
stereotypical images of a community by investigating power
operations which construct the self­other relationship.
Thus, community without community invites multicul-
tural educators to investigate the complexities of identities
that move beyond highlighting the essence of cultural differ-
ence and solid "we-ness" (Butler, 1999; Lloyd, 2005). This
invitation can lead multicultural educators toward a di777f-
ferent way of looking at and thinking about racial/ethnic
identity and racism more broadly than would result from
exploring social inequity based on the simple binary of
oppressor/oppressed, male/female, and us/them. As the ARtS
Moon 11
initiative implies through multiple constructions about self­
other, I argue for creating and sustaining diverse epistemolo-
gies in order to release children's imagination for the
purposes of social transformation (Greene, 1995). Most
notably, the notion of community without community could
allow for the possibility of reconceptualizing existing com-
munities and their vision for promoting justice in education
by minimizing any normalized practices for children "at
risk" or "underprivileged" communities.
