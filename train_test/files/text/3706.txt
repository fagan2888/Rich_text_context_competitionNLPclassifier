Introduction
Pathogenesis of the renal complications in diabetes is
multifaceted and not completely understood.1­3 Evidence
supports a critical role for renin­angiotensin system
(RAS) activation in the diabetes-related disturbances in
renal microcirculation, inflammation and salt bal-
ance.4­10 Inappropriate and uncontrolled activation of
the local paracrine RAS sets in motion a series of turbu-
lences in several critical cellular processes which can
contribute to the pro-inflammatory changes seen in dia-
betes.9 One of these cellular processes affected by hyper-
glycemia and RAS activation is the COX-derived
prostaglandins generation.3,11­13 Among prostaglandins,
prostaglandin E2
(PGE2
) in particular has a powerful
pro-inflammatory effect and has been tightly linked to
RAS activation.5,14­25
Previous studies demonstrated that under normal condi-
tions (normal salt and no diabetes), the activity of RAS is
minimal, with no effects for angiotensin receptor blockers
on basal prostaglandins generation.22,23,25 However, under
low salt condition, we demonstrated that AT1
R mediates
PGE2
generation22,26 and, in turn, PGE2

Abstract
Introduction: Previous studies demonstrated that stimulation of angiotensin subtype 1 receptor (AT1
R) led to
increased renal generation of prostaglandins E2
(PGE2
) and renal inflammation. In turn, PGE2
increases AT1
R activity.
The conversion of PGE2
to the less active metabolite prostaglandin F2
(PGF2
) via 9-ketoreductase interrupts this
feedback loop. The effects of diabetes on the interface between AT1
R, PGE2
and PGF2
are not well established. We
hypothesized that in diabetes, an aberrant AT1
R activity enhances the biosynthesis of PGE2
and impairs the activity of
PGE 9-ketoreductase, leading to accumulation of PGE2
.
Materials and methods: Using microdialysis technique, we monitored renal interstitial fluid levels of angiotensin II
(Ang II), PGE2
and PGF2
in control and AT1
R blocker, valsartan, treated diabetic rats (N=8 each). We utilized the PGF2
to PGE2
ratio as indirect measure of PGE 9-ketoreductase activity.
Results: Diabetes increased renal interstitial fluid levels of Ang II, PGE2
and PGF2
. PGF2
/PGE2
ratio increased by the
third week, but declined by the sixth week of diabetes. Valsartan reduced PGE2
and PGF2
levels and increased Ang II
and the conversion of PGE2
to PGF2
.
Conclusion: Our results suggest that in diabetes, AT1
R increases PGE2
generation and reduces conversion of PGE2
to
PGF2
with the progression of diabetes.

between AT1
R and PGE2
is buffered by the enzyme 9-keto
reductase, which increases the conversion of PGE2
to pros-
taglandins F2
(PGF2
), a prostaglandin metabolite that has
an inhibitory effect on RAS.22­26,30,31 The effects of chronic
hyperglycemia on the interaction between RAS and pros-
taglandins E2
and F2
have not been described. We hypoth-
esized that in diabetes, an aberrant AT1
R activity enhances
the biosynthesis of PGE2
and impairs the activity of the
enzyme PGE2
9-ketoreductase, leading to reduction in the
inactivation of PGE2
to PGF2
.
Materials and methods
Renal microdialysis technique
To determine the levels of renal interstitial fluid (RIF)
angiotensin II (Ang II), PGE2
and PGF2
, we constructed a
microdialysis probe as described previously.22,26,32 Each
end of a single hollow-fiber dialysis tube (5.0 mm long,
0.1 mm inner diameter) with a 10,000-Da molecular mass
cutoff (Hospal, France) was inserted into the manually
dilated ends of two 300 mm long (inflow and outflow) hol-
low polyethylene tubes with 0.12 mm inner diameter and
0.65 mm outer diameter. In vitro recoveries of PGE2
and
PGF2
by the dialysis probes were 63% and 60% respec-
tively. Negligible amounts of prostaglandins stick to the
polyethylene tubes of the dialysis probes as demonstrated
by recovery of 99.5% of PGE2
and 99.7 % PGF2
 in the in
vitro perfusate.
Animal preparation
Eight four-week-old male Sprague-Dawley rats (Hilltop Lab
Animals, Inc., Scottsdale, Pennsylvania) weighing 245­255g
were studied. All studies were approved by the University of
VirginiaAnimal Care and Use Committee. For in vivo deter-
minations of PGE2
and PGF2
, the rats were placed under
general anesthesia with ketamine (80 mg/kg IM) and xyla-
zine (8 mg/kg IM), and the left kidney was exposed by a left
lateral abdominal incision. The microdialysis probes were
placed in the cortices of the kidneys while rats were under
general anesthesia. Opioid analgesia with buprenorphine
(0.01­0.05 mg/kg subcutaneous, administered every 12 h for
one day after surgery) was used as our pre-emptive analge-
sia. No non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)
were used, given the impact of NSAIDs on prostaglandin
release. All RIF measurements were made four days after
implanting the probes. For collection of RIF, the inflow tubes
of the dialysis probes were connected to gas-tight syringes
filled with lactated Ringer's solution and perfused at 3 µl/
min. The effluent was collected from the outflow tubes of the
dialysis probes for 60-min sample periods in plastic non-
heparinized tubes and stored in ­80ºC until assayed for PGE2
and PGF2
. The animals were rendered diabetic using a single
injection of streptozotocin (30mg/kg, Sigma Co., St. Louis,
Missouri) 14 days after insertion of the microdialysis tubes.
Blood glucose from tail vein was monitored five days after
STZ injection (Accu-Check, Boehringer Mannheim
Corporation). RIF samples were collected before STZ treat-
ment, and three and six weeks after induction of diabetes.
Experiments were started every day at the same time (08:00)
to avoid any diurnal variation of the measured substances.
RIF samples were collected from conscious rats (N=8) prior
to and five hours after receiving the AT1
R antagonist valsar-
tan (Novartis Pharma, Basel, Switzerland). Valsartan (10
mg/kg) was administered orally by gavage. Kidneys were
examined for fibrosis or inflammatory response surrounding
the inserted dialysis probes.32
Analytical methods
RIF PGE2
and PGF2
levels in dialysate samples were
measured by using an enzyme immunoassay kit (Cayman
Chemical, Ann Arbor, Michigan). The sensitivity is 50 pg/
ml and 40 pg/ml for PGE2
and PGF2
, respectively, and the
specificity is 100% for both. The intra-assay and inter-
assay cross-reactivity with arachidonic acid or other eicos-
anoids was <10%. RIF Ang II levels in dialysate samples
were measured by using an enzyme immunoassay kit (SPI-
BIO, France). The sensitivity is 1 pg/ml and the specificity
is 100%. PGF2
to PGE2
ratio is used as an indicator of the
9-keto reductase enzyme activity.22,33­35
Calculations and statistical analysis
All values are expressed as a mean ± standard error of
mean. Significance was set at p<0.05 and determined by
either unpaired Student's t-test or one-way analysis of var-
iance (ANOVA) followed by the Tukey test.
Results
Blood glucose at baseline was 86±4.5mg/dl and increased
to 362±38 mg/dl five days after receiving STZ (p<0.001).
After the induction of diabetes, RIF Ang II recovery levels
increased significantly from 0.3±0.02 pg/min to 0.4 ± 0.02
pg/min (p=0.013 vs. baseline) at the third week and to
0.5±0.01 pg/min (p< 0.001 vs. baseline) at the sixth week
(Figure 1). There were significant increases in the levels of
RIF PGE2
, from 17.5±1.4 pg/min to 76.3±14.5 pg/min at
three weeks (p< 0.01) and to 133.2±13.1 pg/min (p<0.001
vs. baseline, p<0.01 vs. three weeks of diabetes) at six
weeks after the onset of diabetes (Figure 2). Similarly,
PGF2
increased from 5.7±0.9 pg/min under normoglyce-
mia to 51.7±3.8 pg/min at three weeks (p< 0.001) and to
60.5±12.4 pg/min at six weeks (p< 0.001 vs. baseline) after
the onset of diabetes (Figure 3). RIF PGE2
and PGF2
increased 3- and 9-fold respectively by the third week, and
6- and 11-fold by the sixth week respectively. The ratio of
776 Journal of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System 16(4)
PGF2
/PGE2
ratio (Figure 4) initially increased from 0.3 at
baseline to 0.7 by the third week of diabetes. At six weeks
of diabetes, the PGF2
/PGE2
ratio was reduced to 0.4, sug-
gesting a decline in activity of the enzyme PGE
9-ketoreductase.
Under normal glycemic conditions, treatment with vals-
artan did not significantly affect the RIF Ang II, PGE2
and
PGF2
levels. The administration of valsartan to the dia-
betic animals led to a significant increase in the level of
Ang II, to 0.5 ± 0.03 pg/min (p< 0.001 vs. untreated three
weeks of diabetes) at the third week, and to 0.7±0.05 pg/
min (p< 0.01 vs. untreated six weeks of diabetes) at the
sixth week. Valsartan treatment also led to a significant
decrease in the levels of RIF PGE2
, to 35.4±6.8 pg/min at
the third week (p< 0.05 vs. untreated three weeks of diabe-
tes) and to 32.6±8.4 pg/min at the sixth week (p< 0.001 vs.
untreated six weeks of diabetes) of diabetes (53%, 75%
respectively). Similarly, valsartan led to a significant
decrease in the level of RIF PGF2
, to 21.1 + 4.1 pg/min at
the third week (p< 0.05 vs. untreated three weeks of diabe-
tes) and to 23.2±5.0 at the sixth week (p< 0.01 vs. untreated
six weeks of diabetes) of diabetes (59.3%, 61.6% respec-
tively). Valsartan increased the PGF2
/PGE2
ratio from 0.4
to 0.7 at week 6 of diabetes.

Discussion
Accumulating evidence supports a close relationship
between the prostaglandin system and the RAS in the
kidney. Both systems are also strongly linked to the
development of inflammation and the pathogenesis of
diabetes complications. However, the interface between
prostaglandin and RAS in diabetes remained unclear and
mechanistically vague. Prior studies have been hindered
by the difficulty in continuous monitoring of early and
late paracrine changes in tissues of diabetic animals. The
use of the microdialysis technique allowed us to sample
in real time and longitudinally in the same, live, and con-
scious animals the interaction between renal cortical
angiotensin II, PGE2
and PGF2
before and after induc-
tion of diabetes and in response to AT1
R blockade. Here,
we demonstrate a role for AT1
R in the increased biosyn-
thesis of PGE2
and PGF2
in diabetes and on the conver-
sion of PGE2
to PGF2
.
In alignment with previous reports22,26 under normal
conditions, RAS activity is minimal with no effects of
AT1
R blockade on Ang II, PGE2
or PGF2
levels. Also
analogous to our previous report under low salt conditions,
we have seen activation of the RAS in early diabetes with
a rise in Ang II generation and signaling through AT1
R that
mediated the increase in prostaglandins generation. Our
current study further clarified the effects of chronic activa-
tion of RAS on prostaglandins release and the impact of
this on the regulation of prostaglandins­RAS crosstalk.
The observed increased generation of PGE2
and reduction
in conversion rate of PGE2
to PGF2
in diabetes provides a
mechanistic explanation of previous reports that suggested
an interaction between renin and prostaglandins36­38 and
reveals a pathological positive feedback loop with the
RAS (increased biosynthesis of prostaglandins and
reduced conversion of the RAS-enhancer PGE2
to the RAS
inhibitor PGF2
) in diabetes. The increase in the level of
PGE2
by the third week of diabetes was associated with a
concordant increase in the level of PGF2
in the kidney.
Interestingly, while the conversion of PGE2
to PGF2
was
initially enhanced by hyperglycemia, this rate of conver-
sion declined by the sixth week of diabetes despite increas-
ing levels of PGE2
. This paradoxical early increase in the
conversion rate may result from either the increase in
PGE2
synthesis or alteration in PGE2
metabolism by
9-ketoreductase or both. A reduction in PGE2
9-ketoreduc-
tase activity, however, could only explain the later decline
in the rate of conversion of the powerful pro-inflammatory,
renin enhancer PGE2
to the less active PGF2
in diabetes,
despite increased generation of PGE2.
The restoration of
this conversion rate with valsartan treatment supports the
notion that in diabetes, AT1
R has an inhibitory effect on
PGE2
9-ketoreductase activity.
In the present study we observed a counter regulatory
upregulation of RIF Ang II with valsartan treatment in dia-
betes. Previous studies suggested that treatment with AT1
R
antagonists are associated with a rise in plasmaAng II con-
centration as the result of inhibition of the AT1
R-mediated
negative feedback on renin release.39­42 Previous studies
have also suggested that the resultant increased Ang II
stimulates AT2
R.43 Our current study suggests a role for
AT1
R in reducing the activity of PGE2
9-ketoreductase
with the progression of diabetes. We have observed an ini-
tial increase in PGE2
9-ketoreductase activity that was fol-
lowed by decline as diabetes progressed; a potential role
for the anti-inflammatory AT2
R cannot be excluded and
may explain the initial increase in the rate of conversion of
PGE2
to PGF2
at three weeks of diabetes (through an
intact AT2
R). With the progression of diabetes, increase in
Ang II and AT1
R activity, a failure in AT2
R may propagate
the reduced activity of PGE2
9-ketoreductase. It is tempt-
ing also to speculate that the increased rate of conversion
of PGE2
to PGF2
observed with valsartan treatment dur-
ing the third week of diabetes is mediated through enhanc-
ing the activity of the unopposed and functional AT2
R. We
previously reported a direct role for AT2
R in modulating
the activity of PGE 9-ketoreductase.22,26 It is possible that
the use of AT1
R blockade enhances the AT2
R function in
diabetes.44 In addition, the observed increase in Ang II lev-
els in diabetes could result from the less opposed inhibi-
tory action of PGF2 on renin release.30,31
Conclusion
The current study suggests that in diabetes,Ang II, through
AT1
R, plays a critical role in generation and conversion of
PGE2
to PGF2
. With progression of diabetes, PGE2
to
PGF2
conversion is impaired, leading to further accumu-
lation of the potent pro-inflammatory, renin enhancer
PGE2
and the establishment of a vicious cycle between
RAS and prostaglandins systems. Given the strong link
between RAS, prostaglandins and their downstream sign-
aling pathways mediating angiogenesis, cell adhesion,
