Abstract -- Aims: To test whether survey respondents who report alcohol misuse in the past year are more likely to be abstinent or
binge-free in the past 30 days if they have used treatment, than if they have not. Methods: Analysis of data from the 2002 US National
Survey on Drug Use and Health was obtained. Results: A total of 5730 respondents scored positive for alcohol abuse or dependence
in the preceding year. Fewer than 10% had used any treatment for alcohol or drugs in this period, but this was associated with a 10%
increase in the past-month abstinence and past-month binge-free drinking compared with respondents who did not access treatment.
Such an apparent short-term recovery appeared greater in those whose treatment had been received in a formal treatment setting, a
doctor's office, or in self-help groups than in the emergency room or in prison. Conclusions: Even if part of the association between
treatment and recent abstinence and non-binge drinking was causal, indicating that treatment has some impact, it is a pathway chosen
only by the minority.

INTRODUCTION
What can be learnt about the efficacy of treatment for alcohol
problems from population survey data? First, it is possible to
demonstrate that treatment has some impact. As an example,
using longitudinal data from representative samples, Weisner
et al. (2003a, b) have shown that problem drinkers who access
treatment are more likely to resolve their concerns than those
who do not access treatment. While the impact of treatment is
modest, these findings are an important adjunct to clinical trial
efficacy research (see reviews Miller et al., 1995; Moyer et al.,
2002) because it demonstrates what happens to the population
of individuals with alcohol problems as opposed to just those
few individuals who enter treatment trials. In contrast to this
finding, population research also demonstrates the fact that
the majority of people with alcohol problems deal with their
drinking concerns without treatment (Dawson, 1996;
Cunningham, 1999). Hence, while treatment effectiveness
research employing representative population samples can
indicate that attending treatment accrues some advantages as
far as increasing the chances of recovery, such research also
demonstrates that this pathway is the less chosen one and that
most people with alcohol problems deal with their concerns
without ever using treatment.
What else can be learnt about treatment from population
samples? Is it possible to find any indication whether some
types of treatment might be more effective than others? There
are limitations to which population surveys can be used to
address this question. Such surveys are often cross-sectional,
hence any findings are limited by the lack of longitudinal data.
The incidence of treatment use in the general population of
problem drinkers is also low (e.g. Cunningham and Breslin,
2004), hence sample sizes are often not large enough to
compare different treatment modalities. Finally, population
surveys are usually not designed to explore this question, so the
items contained in these surveys are often not detailed enough
to be of any use for this purpose. One possible approach to
take, however, is to explore the short-term impact of treatment
using population survey data. Population surveys usually have
their focus on drinking and service use in the last year so it
should be possible, given a large enough sample, to explore
whether different treatment modalities are associated with
short-term resolutions from alcohol problems in the last year.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS
Data from the 2002 National Survey on Drug Use and Health
(NSDUH; US Department of Health and Human Services,
2004) were used to explore whether treatment use was
associated with short-term recoveries. The 2002 NSDUH
comprises a large (n = 54 079) representative sample of the
US population. The NSDUH is a yearly survey that employs a
stratified, multistage area probability sample of the US. The
target population for the survey is civilians, 12 years or older.
The interviews for the 2002 survey were conducted face-to-face
and the overall response rate was 79%.
The 2002 NSDUH assessed the past-year alcohol
dependence or abuse using items from DSM-IV (American
Psychiatric Association, 1994) and asked about treatment use
as well. Questions about treatment use were asked after all the
sections assessed the use of different illicit drugs. Treatment
was defined as accessing any treatment services for either
illicit drug use or alcohol use in the past year, i.e. `These next
questions deal with treatment for alcohol and drug problems,
not including cigarettes. Please report treatment or counseling
designed to help you reduce or stop your alcohol or drug use.
Please include detoxification and any other treatment for
medical problems associated with your alcohol or drug use.
Have you ever received treatment or counseling for your use
of alcohol or any drug, not counting cigarettes?' Respondents
agreeing to this item were then asked, `During the last
12 months, have you received treatment or counseling for your
use of alcohol or any drug, not counting cigarettes?' Both
alcohol and drug treatment were included because there is
some overlap in treatment modalities for all substance abuse
problems (Rotgers et al., 1996). If respondents answered yes

to these screener questions, they were asked about use of the
specific treatment options identified on Table 1. For the
purposes of this study, short-term recoveries were assessed in
two ways. First, respondents were asked if they had ever
consumed 5 drinks on one occasion in the past 30 days.
Second, respondents were asked if they had consumed any
alcohol in the past 30 days. A standard drink was defined for
the respondent at the time these questions were asked.
Prevalence estimates were calculated using weighted data on
the online data analysis system of the Substance Abuse and
Mental Health Data Archive. Sample sizes are presented as
unweighted data.
RESULTS
Table 1 displays the treatment use and past-month drinking of
the 5730 respondents with alcohol abuse or dependence in the
past year. Less than 10% of these respondents had accessed any
type of treatment for alcohol or drug concerns in the past year.
Of all 5730 respondents, 10% were abstinent in the past month
and 22.5% had not consumed 5 drinks on one occasion on any
day in the past month. Inspection of the proportions of
respondents who accessed treatment and displayed reduced
drinking in the past month also indicated that: (i) respondents
who accessed some type of treatment were more likely to be
abstinent and to have not binged in the past month compared
with respondents who had not accessed treatment [Abstinent
(n = 5730): No treatment = 8.8%, Treatment = 22.1%; No binge
(n = 5730): No treatment = 21.7%, Treatment = 29.7%; both
P < 0.01]; and (ii) there was variation in the proportion of
respondents who reported abstinence and binge-free drinking in
the past month depending on the type of treatment they had
accessed (Abstinent: proportions ranged from 18% for treatment
in prison to 36% for treatment in a hospital; No binge:
proportions ranged from 23% for treatment in prison to 41% for
treatment at a doctor's office).
DISCUSSION
In line with the findings of Weisner et al. (2003a, b), the
present study provides evidence that people who access
treatment do better on an average compared with those who do
not seek help for their alcohol concerns. This finding should
be tempered by the facts that <10% of people with alcohol
dependence or abuse actually sought treatment and that there
was also evidence of short-term recoveries among respondents
who did not seek treatment (albeit a lower proportion).
Finally, there was a variation in the proportion of short-term
recoveries among the subsets of treated respondents who
accessed different types of services.
What can be concluded from these findings? First, it is
probably true that people with alcohol dependence or abuse
will do better if they seek treatment, as the present study
demonstrated an 10% increase in the past-month abstinence
and binge-free rates between respondents who sought
treatment compared with those who did not. However, this
conclusion should be viewed with some caution because
respondents were not randomly assigned to treatment, so
causal statements cannot be made and it is possible that some
systematic difference that covaried with treatment access
could be the true explanation as to why these respondents did
better as opposed to this improvement being the result of
treatment use. Another alternative explanation is that the
association of no binge or abstinence in the past month with
treatment could occur because alcohol abusers who were
formerly continuous drinkers and are now episodic heavy
drinkers may be more likely to seek treatment than those who
remain as continuous heavy drinkers. This might happen if the
continuous abuser tried to abstain using his or her own
resources, then finds he or she can only do so for periods
(becomes `episodic') and then, seeks help.
Caution should also be used in interpreting the results for
several other reasons. First, the present study only investigated
past-month drinking and provided no evidence regarding
sustained recoveries from alcohol abuse or dependence.
Second, while it is justified to ask about use of alcohol and
drug treatment because there is overlap in the content and
target population of these services, this analytic choice should
be taken into consideration when interpreting the findings.
Third, while the results of this study can probably be used to
indicate that there is variation in the impact of different
treatment modalities, it would be inappropriate to use the
findings to state that one treatment modality is superior to the
other. This type of analysis does not offer any information
about the type of person that ends up in different treatment
services. How do their characteristics vary and what impact
does this variation have on drinking outcome, irrespective of
the treatment used?
Moreover, these treatment sub-samples were partially
overlapping because the sum of respondents who used each of
the treatment modalities exceeded the total number of
respondents who accessed any of the treatments. Despite these
limitations, the final conclusion that can be drawn from these
findings is that, while the provision of treatment services is a
laudable effort that has some impact, it is still the pathway
chosen by the minority of respondents in their drinking
careers (Burton and Williamson, 1995; Cunningham and
Breslin, 2004).
