The study of party youth in Europe
In a study of young party members, Bruter and Harrison
made a laudable effort to understand their motivations and
behaviour by running an original online survey of 2919
members aged 18­25 belonging to 15 parties in six
European democracies. The questionnaire comprised 13
topics covering multiple items that asked about the respond-
ent's socio-economic characteristics and their perceptions,
preferences, behaviour and expected future involvement in
the party (Bruter and Harrison, 2009: 1286­1287). Bruter
and Harrison first hypothesized that young party members
could be primarily designated as being either morally,
socially or professionally minded. Morally oriented mem-
bers serve a moral duty by getting engaged in a party; pro-
fessionally oriented members are focused on office and
think and behave like political leaders; socially oriented
members use their party as a source of social interaction
and stimulation (Bruter and Harrison, 2009: 1264­1266);
an exploratory factor analysis confirmed the hypothesis
about the presence of three types of members (2009: 1271).
Building on this finding, Bruter and Harrison (2009)
tested four hypotheses on how the three member types dif-
fer in terms of i) membership objectives, ii) levels and
forms of activism, iii) efficacy and democratic perceptions,
and iv) self-perceived political future and membership in
the party.1 Each of the four hypotheses is a compound or

Abstract
Based on the statistical analysis of an original survey of young party members from six European democracies, a study
concluded that three types of young members differed systematically regarding their membership objectives, activism,
efficacy and perceptions of the party and self-perceived political future. We performed a technical replication of the
original study, correcting four deficiencies, which led us to a different conclusion. First, we discuss substantive significance
in addition to statistical significance. Second, we ran significance tests on all comparisons instead of limiting them to an
arbitrary subset. Third, we performed pairwise comparisons between the three types of members instead of using
pooled groups. Fourth, we avoided the inflation of the type-I error rate due to multiple testing by using the Bonferroni­
Holm correction. We found that most of the differences between the types lacked substantive significance, and that
statistical significance only coherently distinguished the types of members in their future membership, but not in their
present behaviour and attitudes.

composite hypothesis covering two to six theoretical expec-
tations, yielding 19 expectations in total (Bruter and
Harrison, 2009: 1267; see Tables A.3­A.6 in the online
appendix). We have reproduced the hypothesis on member
attitudes as an example of a composite hypothesis. The
numbers in brackets highlight the individual expectations:
Professional-minded members are the most efficacious [1], the
most positive about the party's organization [2], and the most
likely to think of politics as a profession [3]. Social-minded
members are the most critical [4] and least efficacious [5];
moral-minded members are least likely to think of politics as a
profession [6]. (Bruter and Harrison, 2009: 1267)
Each individual expectation was tested by running an
`ANOVA test of difference' between the mean responses
of party members belonging to different groups (Bruter
and Harrison, 2009: 1279). Some expectations were tested
with one item, while others were linked to up to six items
(see Tables A.3­A.6 in the online appendix). For example,
the expectation that socially minded members are most
critical means that this member type would show the low-
est mean response across six items measuring different
attitudes towards their own party (Bruter and Harrison,
2009: 1279­1281). Bruter and Harrison concluded that the
results confirmed the hypotheses, and stated that `Each
type of young party member is characterized by different
patterns of perceptions, attitudes, activities, preferences,
and hopes and expectations about their own future' (Bruter
and Harrison, 2009: 1284).
In this paper, we point to four deficiencies in the original
empirical analysis and remedy them in a technical replica-
tion. Our results qualify the original conclusion. Young party
members only show statistically significant differences in
their long-run expectations and display an incoherent picture
when it comes to present perceptions, attitudes and activities.
We further show that most differences in mean responses are
marginal and lack substantive significance.
Four problems with the analysis
We admire the effort that Bruter and Harrison put into col-
lecting the data to answer a relevant research question.
However, we argue that the analysis suffers from four prob-
lems. The shortcomings we have corrected are, first, a
neglect of substantive significance. Since the number of
observations ­ about 3000 ­ is large, it is particularly
important to consider substantive significance because sta-
tistical significance should not be difficult to achieve.
Second, some comparisons of means were excluded from
significance testing for no obvious reason. For the 22 items
that we reanalyse below, the original analysis contains sig-
nificance tests for only 11 of them.
Third, the test of differences between the three types of
young members assessed whether one group `differ[s] ...
significantly from the rest of the sample' (Bruter and
Harrison, 2009: 1279). The comparison of a group's mean
to the pooled mean response of the two other groups is
inconsistent with the valuable idea of distinguishing three
groups of young members. A test of one group against the
pooled mean response of the other two groups does not
allow one to say that the three groups differ from each
other, because this is not what is being tested. One can eas-
ily conceive of constellations in which a test of one group
against two pooled groups masks interesting findings. It is
possible that one group differs from the pooled group, but
not from one or even both groups if we run separate signifi-
cance tests. Similarly, one group of young members might
not differ from a pooled sample, but differ from one or both
of the other two groups in pairwise comparisons.2
The fourth problem is significance testing without taking
into account that multiple comparisons inflate the probability
of making a type-I error (Abdi, 2010: 573). Multiple compari-
sons require controlling the family-wise error rate (FWER)
by using an appropriate error correction technique. In the
original study, multiple testing was an issue because 12 tests
related to both the objectives of young members and the
expected future involvement in the party; 21 tests were tied to
both activism and democratic perceptions.3 Figure 1 shows
how the FWER depends on the number of tests. The uncor-
rected FWER increases to 0.46 for 12 tests and to 0.66 for 21
tests, demonstrating that the original analysis ran a consider-
ably increased risk of falsely rejecting the null hypothesis of
no significant mean differences.
A technical replication and its results
We performed a technical replication that remedied the four
deficiencies of the original analysis. Since the original data
is lost (see Note 2), we had to rely on the summary statistics
reported in the article ­ mean, standard deviation and num-
ber of responses per type ­ to replicate the analysis of the

tests.

four hypotheses. First, our replication ran analyses on all 22
items instead of a subset of them. Second, we aligned
design and theory by comparing one group of young mem-
bers with another group instead of a pooled sample, yield-
ing 66 tests in total because we had to perform three
pairwise comparisons per item.4 Third, for each hypothesis
we established a FWER of 0.05 by using the Bonferroni­
Holm (1979) error correction, which is widely applied and
has more power than the Bonferroni correction (Abdi,
2010). Fourth, we discuss the substantive significance of
the findings and how large the mean differences were.
We re-evaluated the hypotheses by cross-tabulating the
aggregate results of the significance tests with and without
error correction.5 Table 1 aggregates the results across all
hypotheses. Table 2 summarizes the results separately for
each hypothesis.
Twenty-one tests out of 66 did not allow us to reject
the null of no mean difference without error correction.
This number increased to 32 when we controlled for mul-
tiple testing, and means we failed to reject the null
hypothesis almost as many times as we rejected it. The
aggregate perspective showed that the three types of
young members can hardly be considered to `have their
own "story"' (Bruter and Harrison, 2009: 1284). There
are some differences between young party members, but
only half of their story is unique while the other half of
the story is shared.
This conclusion was supported by a disaggregated
analysis because none of the four hypotheses was fully
confirmed. We failed to reject the null hypothesis of no
mean difference in the majority of tests for three hypoth-
eses: seven out of 12 for party objectives, 13 out of 21 for
party activism and 10 out of 21 for democratic percep-
tions. The only dimension for which we could reject
the null hypothesis most of the time concerned expected
future involvement, displaying 10 significant compari-
sons out of 12. This dimension was also the only one for
which error correction did not affect the results.
When we further disaggregated the perspective and looked
at individual comparisons between groups (TablesA.3­A.6 in
the online appendix), we found that less than one-third of all
comparisons allowed us to reject the null hypothesis for both
pairwise comparisons implied by a specific expectation in a
hypothesis (10 items out of 36).6 For 16 items, one test was
significant and the second one not, and 10 items failed to
reject the null hypothesis for both comparisons.
In the last step of our reanalysis, we focused on the sub-
stantive significance of the mean differences. This is based
on the premise that an assessment of statistical and substan-
tive significance should go hand in hand. Figure 2 plots the

mean differences separately for each hypothesis and pair-
wise comparison of types of members. On a five-point
scale, we considered differences of less than 10% of the
scale to be of little significance (equivalent to 0.5 points).7
Of all 66 comparisons, only 5% involved a difference in
means of 0.5 or more. Even if we reduce the definition of
substantive significance to 5% of the 0­4 scale (0.25
points), only 25% of all comparisons reach this threshold.
Most of the mean comparisons therefore lacked substantive
significance.8
Conclusion
We identified four deficiencies in the statistical analysis of
an original survey of young party members and corrected
them in a technical replication. In contrast to the original
conclusion that `Each type of young party member is ...
different' (Bruter and Harrison, 2009: 1284), our analysis
suggests that the picture is much more nuanced. We argue
that young party members do not display relevant differ-
ences in their membership objectives, levels of activism or
democratic perceptions, because half of the comparisons
were not significant and most of them lacked substantive
significance. The only statistically significant mean differ-
ences we found related to the party members' self-per-
ceived political future. Most of these differences, however,
also displayed low substantive significance.
The replication results provide crucial insights into
`who exactly young party members are, what they seek,
and how they perceive their involvement and future role'
(Bruter and Harrison, 2009: 1260). Our findings indicate
that the differences in future aspirations are not strongly
grounded in present differences in young party members'
attitudes and behaviour. Given that professionally
minded, socially minded and morally minded members
do not differ coherently in their current opinions and
behaviour, it is puzzling that they believe their future
engagement in the party and politics more generally will
be different. We cannot explore the reasons for this dis-
crepancy, but consider this an insight worth exploring in
follow-up research on the party youth.

Notes
1. The study also looks at individual countries and types of par-
ties. We do not have the data to replicate it and the analysis is
primarily exploratory.
2. We cannot assess whether one of these constellations holds,
because the original data is lost (email from Michael Bruter,
12 June 2015). We illustrate these constellations with hypo-
thetical data in the reproduction material for our paper.
3. Bruter and Harrison evaluated the hypotheses singly, requir-
ing a correction for the total number of tests per hypothesis.
4. We performed pairwise t-tests assuming equal variances.
5. A breakdown of the results for each hypothesis and individ-
ual item is presented in the online appendix in Tables A.7 and
A.10. We ignored the fact that three significant tests in the
original analysis had the wrong sign.
6. For example, saying that a member type is most active means
it is more active in comparison with each of the other two
types. `Handing out flyers' would be used twice and yield
more than two comparisons if one type of member was said to
be most active and the other was expected to be least active.
7. We could not calculate Cohen's d because of the data
constraints.
8. If we limit the analysis of substantive significance to the sta-
tistically significant comparisons, only 9% of the compari-
sons attain a difference of 0.5, and 50% a threshold of 0.25.
